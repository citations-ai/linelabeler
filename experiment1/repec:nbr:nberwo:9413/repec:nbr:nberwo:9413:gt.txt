3:43:2408:0:27:71:150:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:I. Introduction 
3:44:2424:27:28:107:516:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:High-stakes testing has become an increasingly prominent feature of the educational 
3:45:2508:28:27:71:490:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:landscape.  Every state in the country except for Iowa currently administers state-wide 
3:46:2596:27:28:71:518:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:assessment tests to students in elementary and secondary school.  Twenty-four states require 
3:47:2689:28:28:71:528:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:students to pass an exit examination to graduate high school.  Twenty states reward schools on 
3:48:2784:28:27:71:524:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the basis of exemplary or improved student performance on standardized exams and 32 states 
3:49:2875:27:28:71:503:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sanction schools on the basis of poor student performance on these exams.  In the state of 
3:50:2966:28:27:71:543:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:California, a policy providing for merit pay bonuses of as much as $25,000 per teacher in schools 
3:51:3064:27:28:71:521:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with large test score gains was recently put into place.  Recent federal legislation promises to 
3:52:3161:28:27:71:509:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:accelerate this trend.  The reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act 
3:53:3251:27:28:71:529:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(ESEA) requires states to test students in third through eighth grade each year and to judge the 
3:54:3348:28:28:71:375:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:performance of schools based on student achievement scores.   
3:55:3410:28:27:107:542:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:?:Proponents of high-stakes testing argue that requiring students to demonstrate proficiency 
3:56:3501:27:28:71:508:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in basic skills provides increased incentives for learning, as well as preventing unqualified 
3:57:3595:28:27:71:520:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:students from being promoted to higher-level grades where their inadequate preparation may 
3:58:3686:27:28:71:538:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:interfere with other students’ learning.  By linking teacher salary and employment to student test 
3:59:3785:28:28:71:526:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:scores, schools are held accountable for their students’ performance.  Opponents of test-based 
3:60:3880:28:27:71:529:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:accountability, on the other hand, argue that linking incentives to performance on standardized 
3:61:3976:27:28:71:533:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:tests may unfairly penalize certain students and will lead teachers to substitute away from other 
3:62:4074:28:27:71:537:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:teaching skills or topics not directly tested on the accountability exam (Holmstrom and Milgrom 
3:63:4170:27:0:71:500:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:1991).  Studies of districts that have implemented such policies provide mixed evidence, 
4:64:4261:0:27:71:510:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:suggesting some improvements in student performance along with indications of increased 
4:65:4349:27:28:71:360:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:teaching to the test and shifts away from non-tested areas.1  
4:66:4411:28:27:107:542:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:In this paper, we explore a very different concern regarding high-stakes testing—cheating 
4:67:4501:27:472:71:445:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:on the part of teachers and administrators.2  As incentives for high test scores 
4:68:4582:472:7:215:218:154:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:?:                                                           
4:69:4640:7:16:71:525:147:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:1 See, for example, Deere and Strayer (2001), Grissmer et. al. (2000), Heubert and Hauser (1999), Jacob (2001a, 
4:70:4752:16:7:71:495:131:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:2001b), Klein et. al. (2000),Richards and Sheu (1992), Smith and Mickelson (2000), and  Tepper (2001). 
4:71:4855:7:0:71:539:124:42:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:F:2  Hereafter, we uses the phrase “teacher cheating” to encompass cheating done by either teachers or administrators. 
4:72:4971:0:28:71:512:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:increase, unscrupulous teachers may be more likely to engage in a range of illicit activities, 
4:73:5066:28:27:71:537:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:including changing student responses on answer sheets, filling in the blanks when a student fails 
4:74:5164:27:28:71:532:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to complete a section, allowing students extra time to complete tests, providing correct answers 
4:75:5261:28:27:71:511:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to students, or obtaining copies of an exam illegitimately prior to the test date and teaching 
4:76:5356:27:28:71:530:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:students using knowledge of the precise exam questions.  While such allegations may seem far-
4:77:5449:28:27:71:523:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:fetched, documented cases of such cheating have recently been uncovered in California (May 
4:78:5540:27:28:71:502:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:2000), Massachusetts (Marcus 2000), New York (Loughran and Comiskey  1999), Texas 
4:79:5622:28:28:71:383:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(Kolker 1999), and Great Britain (Hofkins 1995, Tysome 1994). 
4:80:5684:28:27:107:513:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Although the absolute number of teachers and administrators who have been caught 
4:81:5765:27:28:71:523:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheating to date is very small, there are indications that the prevalence of cheating may be far 
4:82:5862:28:27:71:522:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:more widespread.  A survey of elementary school teachers in two large school districts asked 
4:83:5955:27:28:71:539:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:teachers to what extent they believed an array of questionable actions were practiced by teachers 
4:84:6053:28:28:71:533:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in their school.  Almost ten percent of the teachers responded that they believed that teachers in 
4:85:6152:28:27:71:527:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:their school “often” or “frequently” give students answers to test questions.  Six percent of the 
4:86:6250:27:28:71:508:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:respondents believed that teachers “often” or “frequently” changed answers on a student’s 
4:87:6340:28:0:71:526:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:answer sheet (Shephard and Doughtery 1991).  In another study, 35 percent of North Carolina 
5:88:6433:0:27:71:538:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:teachers in grades 3, 6, 8 and 10 reported having witnessed cheating, including giving extra time 
5:89:6531:27:28:71:506:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:on tests, changing students’ answers, suggesting answers to students and directly teaching 
5:90:6622:28:27:71:227:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sections of the test (Gay 1990).  
5:91:6656:27:28:107:532:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Nonetheless, there has been very little previous empirical analysis of teacher cheating.3  
5:92:6747:28:28:71:498:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The few studies that do exist involve investigations of specific instances of cheating and 
5:93:6838:28:27:71:542:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:generally rely on the analysis of erasure patterns and the controlled re-testing of students.4  While 
5:94:6940:27:28:71:510:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:this earlier research provides convincing evidence of isolated cheating incidents, our paper 
5:95:7033:28:27:71:529:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:represents the first systematic attempt to (1) identify the overall prevalence of teacher cheating 
5:96:7132:27:28:71:537:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:empirically and (2) analyze the factors that predict cheating.  To address these questions, we use 
5:97:7231:28:27:71:535:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:detailed administrative data from the Chicago Public Schools (CPS).  In particular, for the years 
5:98:7329:27:28:71:513:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:1993-2000, we have the question-by-question answers given by every student in grades 3-7 
5:99:7418:28:28:71:529:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:taking the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS).5  This test is administered annually to virtually all 
5:100:7517:28:48:71:533:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:elementary school students in the CPS.  In addition to the test responses, we also have access to 
5:101:7615:48:7:215:218:329:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:?:                                                           
5:102:7673:7:16:71:531:322:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:3  In contrast, there is a well-developed statistics literature for identifying whether one student has copied answers 
5:103:7792:16:11:71:527:306:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:from another student (Wollack 1997; Holland 1996; Frary 1993; Bellezza and Bellezza 1989; Fray, Tideman and 
5:104:7900:11:12:71:527:295:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:Watts 1977; Angoff 1974).  These methods involve the identification of unusual patterns of agreement in student 
5:105:8012:12:11:71:536:283:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:responses and, for the most part, are only effective in identifying the most egregious cases of copying.  Educational 
5:106:8130:11:12:71:534:272:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:Testing Services (ETS), the company that administers national tests such as the SAT, LSAT, and GRE, has funded 
5:107:8241:12:9:71:223:260:100:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:F:much of this research (Cizek 1999).   
5:108:8278:9:16:71:518:251:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:4 .  In the mid-eighties, Perlman (1985) investigated suspected cheating in a number of Chicago public schools 
5:109:8388:16:12:71:527:235:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:(CPS).  The study included 23 suspect schools— identified on the basis of a high percentage of erasures, unusual 
5:110:8501:12:11:71:516:223:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:patterns of score increases, unnecessarily large orders of blank answer sheets for the ITBS and tips to the CPS 
5:111:8613:11:12:71:541:212:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:Office of Research—along with 17 comparison schools.   When a second form of the test was administered to the 40 
5:112:8726:12:11:71:525:200:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:schools under more controlled conditions, the suspect schools did much worse than the comparison schools.  An 
5:113:8836:11:12:71:504:189:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:analysis of several dozen Los Angeles schools where the percentage of erasures and changed answers were 
5:114:8940:12:11:71:524:177:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:unusually high revealed evidence of teacher cheating (Aiken 1991).  One of the most highly publicized cheating 
5:115:9051:11:12:71:537:166:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:scandals involved Stratfield elementary, an award-winning school in Connecticut.  In 1996, the firm that developed 
5:116:9166:12:11:71:542:154:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:and scored the exam found that the rate of erasures at Stratfield was up to five times greater than other schools in the 
5:117:9287:11:12:71:533:143:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:same district and that 89 percent of erasures at Stratfield were from an incorrect to a correct response.  Subsequent 
5:118:9405:12:7:71:328:131:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:re-testing resulted in significantly lower scores (Lindsay 1996). 
5:119:9471:7:16:71:538:124:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:5  We do not, however, have access to the actual test forms that students filled out so we are unable to analyze these 
5:120:9590:16:0:71:283:108:100:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:F:tests for evidence of suspicious patterns of erasures. 
6:121:9645:0:27:71:527:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:each student’s full academic record, including past test scores, the school and room to which a 
6:122:9741:27:28:71:511:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:student was assigned, special education status, free-lunch eligibility, race, gender, and age. 
6:123:9836:28:27:107:529:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Our approach to detecting classroom cheating uses two types of indicators: unexpected 
6:124:9922:27:28:71:536:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:test score fluctuations and unusual patterns of answers for students within a classroom.  Teacher 
6:125:10020:28:28:71:532:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheating increases the likelihood that students in a classroom will experience large, unexpected 
6:126:10117:28:27:71:528:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:increases in test scores one year, followed by very small test score gains (or even declines) the 
6:127:10215:27:28:71:537:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:following year.  Teacher cheating, especially if done in an unsophisticated manner, is also likely 
6:128:10314:28:27:71:539:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to leave tell-tale signs in the form of blocks of identical answers, unusual patterns of correlations 
6:129:10416:27:28:71:518:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:across student answers within the classroom, or unusual response patterns within a student’s 
6:130:10509:28:27:71:530:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:exam (e.g., a student who answers a number of very difficult questions correctly while missing 
6:131:10604:27:28:71:197:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:many simple questions).   
6:132:10630:28:28:107:523:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Empirically, however, not every classroom with test score fluctuations and suspicious 
6:133:10716:28:27:71:536:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:answer strings is cheating.  Sometimes such patterns arise by chance.  To identify the number of 
6:134:10813:27:28:71:485:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheating classrooms, we would like to compare the observed distribution of test score 
6:135:10899:28:27:71:513:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:fluctuations and suspicious answer strings to a counterfactual in which no cheating occurs.  
6:136:10992:27:28:71:510:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Because we do not have the luxury of observing this counterfactual, we must instead make 
6:137:11081:28:28:71:540:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:assumptions about what the patterns would look like absent cheating.  Our identification strategy 
6:138:11179:28:27:71:540:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:hinges on three key assumptions: (1) cheating increases the likelihood a class will have large test 
6:139:11279:27:28:71:542:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:score fluctuations and suspicious answer strings, (2) if cheating classrooms had not cheated, their 
6:140:11379:28:27:71:513:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:distribution of test score fluctuations and answer strings would be identical to non-cheating 
6:141:11473:27:28:71:542:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:classrooms, and (3) the same pattern of correlation between test score fluctuations and suspicious 
6:142:11572:28:0:71:536:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:answers observed for non-cheating classrooms in other parts of the distribution also holds in the 
7:143:11671:0:27:71:521:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:upper tail of the distribution.  If these assumptions hold, then we can use part of the observed 
7:144:11768:27:28:71:538:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:distribution of outcomes that is unlikely to contain many cheaters (e.g. the 50th-75th percentile of 
7:145:11869:28:27:71:524:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:suspicious answer strings) to determine the natural correlation between test score fluctuations 
7:146:11965:27:28:71:538:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and suspicious answer strings in non-cheating classrooms.  That allows us to predict the patterns 
7:147:12063:28:28:71:508:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:we would expect to observe in the tail of the distribution if no cheating occurred.  The gap 
7:148:12156:28:27:71:524:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:between the predicted and observed frequency of classrooms that are extreme on both the test 
7:149:12249:27:28:71:512:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:score fluctuation and suspicious answer string measures provides our estimate of cheating.  
7:150:12341:28:27:71:536:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Because this identification strategy is necessarily indirect, we devote a great deal of space in the 
7:151:12442:27:28:71:539:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:paper to presenting a wide variety of tests attempting to confirm the validity of our approach, the 
7:152:12542:28:27:71:496:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sensitivity of the results to alternative assumptions, and the plausibility of our findings.  
7:153:12636:27:28:107:536:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:?:Figure 1 provides a simple visual means of demonstrating the empirical approach taken.  
7:154:12724:28:28:71:515:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The horizontal axis in the figure ranks classrooms according to how suspicious their answer 
7:155:12816:28:27:71:524:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:strings are according to our measures.6  The vertical axis is the fraction of the classrooms that 
7:156:12914:27:28:71:523:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:have unusually large test score increases one year followed by especially small gains the next 
7:157:13009:28:27:71:512:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:year.  The graph combines all classrooms and all subjects in our data.7  Consistent with our 
7:158:13102:27:28:71:528:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:assumptions, for most of the range, there is virtually no relationship between how suspicious a 
7:159:13198:28:28:71:501:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:classroom’s answer strings are and the likelihood of large test score fluctuations.  As one 
7:160:13290:28:27:71:527:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:approaches the extreme right tail of the distribution of suspicious answer strings, however, the 
7:161:13387:27:28:71:534:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:probability of large test score fluctuations rises dramatically, consistent with our conjecture that 
7:162:13488:28:30:71:532:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheating classrooms should be extreme on both of our measures.  To estimate the prevalence of 
7:163:13582:30:7:215:218:154:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:?:                                                           
7:164:13640:7:11:71:438:147:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:6  We defer a precise discussion of how we construct our cheating indicators to Section III. 
7:165:13733:11:16:71:532:136:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:7 To construct the figure, classes were rank ordered according to their answer strings and divided into 200 equally-
7:166:13849:16:12:71:526:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:sized segments.   The circles in the figure represent these 200 local means.  The line displayed in the graph is the 
7:167:13966:12:0:71:544:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:fitted value of a regression with a seventh-order polynomial in a classroom’s rank on the suspicious strings measure.  
8:168:14086:0:27:71:543:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheating, we will essentially compare the actual area under the curve in the far right tail of Figure 
8:169:14188:27:28:71:531:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:1 to the predicted area under the curve in the right tail under our maintained assumptions about 
8:170:14285:28:27:71:524:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:how the two measures co-vary in non-cheating classrooms.  Essentially, we predict that in the 
8:171:14379:27:28:71:513:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:absence of cheating, the relationship between suspicious answer strings and large test score 
8:172:14472:28:28:71:517:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:fluctuations would be linear over the entire range, rather than rising sharply in the tail.  That 
8:173:14570:28:27:71:317:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sharp rise, we argue, is a consequence of cheating. 
8:174:14622:27:28:107:531:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A: Empirically, we find evidence of cheating in approximately 200 classrooms per year in 
8:175:14709:28:27:71:540:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:our data, or four to five percent of the classes in our sample.  This estimate is likely to be a lower 
8:176:14812:27:28:71:505:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:bound on the true incidence of cheating for two reasons.  First, we focus only on the most 
8:177:14903:28:27:71:534:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:egregious type of cheating, where teachers systematically altering student test forms.  There are 
8:178:15001:27:28:71:542:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:other more subtle ways in which teachers can cheat, such as providing extra time to students, that 
8:179:15100:28:28:71:523:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:our algorithm is unlikely to detect.  Second, even when test forms are altered, our approach is 
8:180:15196:28:27:71:529:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:only partially successful in detecting illicit behavior.  When we ourselves simulate cheating by 
8:181:15293:27:28:71:506:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:altering student answer strings and then testing for cheating in the artificially manipulated 
8:182:15387:28:27:71:522:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:classrooms, many instances of moderate cheating go undetected.  This is particularly true if a 
8:183:15482:27:28:71:537:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:teacher employs a limited amount of sophistication in the cheating (e.g. avoiding changing large 
8:184:15579:28:28:71:322:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:blocks of consecutive questions for many students). 
8:185:15631:28:27:107:516:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:A number of patterns in the results reinforce our confidence that what we measure is 
8:186:15716:27:28:71:505:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:indeed cheating.  First, cheating on one part of the test (e.g., math) is a strong predictor of 
8:187:15812:28:27:71:507:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheating on other sections of the test (e.g., reading).  Second, cheating is correlated within 
8:188:15907:27:28:71:501:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:classrooms over time and across classrooms in a particular school.  Third, the students in 
8:189:15998:28:0:71:526:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:classrooms with large test score gains that are most likely attributable to cheating lose most of 
9:190:16097:0:27:71:540:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:their gains the following year.  In contrast, students in classrooms with large test-score gains that 
9:191:16199:27:28:71:518:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:do not have suspicious answer string patterns retain the majority of their gains the next year, 
9:192:16295:28:27:71:520:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:despite some loss due to mean reversion.  Fourth, simulation results demonstrate that there is 
9:193:16390:27:28:71:531:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:nothing mechanical about our identification approach that automatically generates patterns like 
9:194:16486:28:28:71:517:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:those observed in the data.  When we randomly assign students to classrooms and search for 
9:195:16577:28:27:71:540:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheating in these simulated classes, our methods find little evidence of cheating.  Finally, there is 
9:196:16679:27:28:71:541:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:no evidence that we are mistaking teachers focusing effort on specific subject areas (e.g. algebra, 
9:197:16779:28:27:71:517:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:fractions) for cheating.  The classrooms we label as cheaters are no more likely to have their 
9:198:16874:27:28:71:419:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:most suspicious answers cluster within a single topic than other classes. 
9:199:16948:28:27:107:537:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A: In addition, the prevalence of cheating appears to respond to relatively minor changes in 
9:200:17039:27:28:71:542:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:teacher incentives.  The importance of standardized tests in the Chicago Public Schools increased 
9:201:17137:28:28:71:537:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:substantially with a change in leadership in 1996.  Schools that scored low on reading tests were 
9:202:17235:28:27:71:523:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:placed on probation and faced the threat of reconstitution (although no elementary school has 
9:203:17329:27:28:71:504:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:actually been reconstituted).  In addition, students in certain grades were required to meet 
9:204:17422:28:27:71:493:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:minimum test scores cutoffs in math and reading in order to advance to the next grade.  
9:205:17510:27:28:71:490:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Following the introduction of these policies, the prevalence of cheating rose sharply in 
9:206:17599:28:28:71:534:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:classrooms with large numbers of low-achieving students.  In contrast, classrooms with average 
9:207:17694:28:27:71:509:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:or higher-achieving students showed no increase in cheating.  Finally, cheating prevalence 
9:208:17785:27:28:71:536:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:appears to be systematically lower in cases where the costs of cheating are higher (e.g. in mixed-
9:209:17883:28:27:71:535:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:grade classrooms in which two different exams are administered simultaneously) or the benefits 
9:210:17978:27:28:71:532:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of cheating are lower (e.g. in classrooms with more special education or bilingual students who 
9:211:18074:28:0:71:483:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:take the standardized tests, but whose scores are excluded from official calculations). 
10:212:18163:0:27:107:497:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.  Section II presents a simple 
10:213:18246:27:28:71:529:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:statistical model for detecting teacher cheating.  Section III introduces the particular indicators 
10:214:18346:28:27:71:491:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:we employ for detecting teacher cheating.  Section IV provides a brief overview of the 
10:215:18433:27:28:71:506:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:institutional details of the Chicago Public Schools and the data set that we use.  Section V 
10:216:18526:28:28:71:540:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:presents the basic empirical results on the prevalence of cheating.  Section VI analyzes in greater 
10:217:18626:28:27:71:541:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:detail the factors that influence which teachers cheat and for which students within the classroom 
10:218:18725:27:28:71:535:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the teachers cheat.  Section VII discusses the results and the implications for increasing reliance 
10:219:18825:28:27:71:537:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:on high-stakes testing.  The appendix provides precise details of the construction of the cheating 
10:220:18924:27:28:71:221:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:indicators used in the analysis.

10:223:19000:27:28:107:520:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Assume that we have two measures of a classroom’s outcome on a standardized test.  
10:224:19083:28:27:71:517:377:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f3:B:SCOREc captures how well class c scores on the test, relative to how the same students have 
10:225:19175:27:28:71:528:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:done on past standardized tests and will do on future tests.  ANSWERSc measures how unusual 
10:226:19267:28:27:71:507:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:are the pattern of answers given by students in class c (e.g. are there are unusual blocks of 
10:227:19361:27:28:71:535:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:answers, or an especially high degree of correlation across student responses).  For simplicity in 
10:228:19460:28:28:71:536:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:presenting the model, we assume that these two measures take on one of two values:  SCOREc = 
10:229:19552:28:27:71:498:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:{low,high} and ANSWERSc = {typical,unusual}.  Further suppose there are two types of 
10:230:19636:27:28:71:518:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:classrooms:  those in which teachers cheat, and those in which they do not.  Define CHEATc 
10:231:19726:28:27:71:529:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:equal to one if cheating occurs, and zero otherwise.  Our first critical assumption is as follows: 
10:232:19825:27:28:71:524:157:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:?:(A1)     Had cheating classrooms not cheated, their distribution of the two outcome measures, 
10:233:19919:28:0:107:491:129:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f3:?:SCORE and ANSWERS, would be identical to that of non-cheating classrooms. 
11:234:19993:0:27:71:74:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: 
11:235:19993:27:28:71:532:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Second, we assume that although cheating behavior is not directly observed, cheating increases 
11:236:20088:28:27:71:519:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the probability that a classroom will have a high average test score and an unusual pattern of

11:251:20488:28:27:71:502:475:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:purposes of exposition, let us assume that for non-cheating classrooms, the two measures 
11:252:20577:27:28:71:499:448:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f3:B:SCORE and ANSWERS are uncorrelated (although this assumption will be relaxed in the

11:287:21067:50:27:71:522:189:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Lemma 1 says that the average fraction of high test scores among classes with typical answer 
11:288:21160:27:28:71:532:162:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:strings provides an upper bound on the probability that non-cheating classrooms will have high 
11:289:21255:28:0:71:528:134:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:test scores.  Similarly, the observed fraction of unusual answer strings among classes with low 
12:290:21353:0:27:71:521:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:test score fluctuations is an upper bound on the probability that non-cheating classrooms will 
12:291:21448:27:28:71:499:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:have unusual answer strings.  The reason these values are upper bounds is because some 
12:292:21535:28:27:71:533:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:classrooms that have “low” test scores or “typical” answer strings may actually be cheaters that 
12:293:21632:27:28:71:498:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:our methods fail to detect.  Even if cheaters are low on one dimension (either SCORE or 
12:294:21720:28:28:71:540:598:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f3:B:ANSWERS), they are still more likely to be elevated on the other measure, leading us to overstate 
12:295:21818:28:27:71:526:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the baseline rate of high test scores or unusual answer strings among non-cheaters.  Only if all

12:304:22508:28:27:71:540:307:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:some cheating classrooms will not be detected by our measures and so will not register as having 
12:305:22605:27:28:71:542:280:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:high test scores and unusual strings.  Second, by Lemma 1, the probabilities of high test scores or 
12:306:22705:28:28:71:501:252:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:unusual answer strings among non-cheating classes are upper bounds on the true values.  
12:307:22793:28:27:107:537:224:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Calculations like those in equation (1) provide the basis for our estimation of the number 
12:308:22884:27:28:71:520:197:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of cheating classrooms.  In our empirical work, we generalize (1) by allowing for correlation 
12:309:22978:28:27:71:507:169:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:between test scores and answer string patterns in non-cheating classrooms, but the logic is

13:327:23779:28:27:107:538:407:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:We employ two types of measures to detect cheating.  One indicator captures predictable 
13:328:23867:27:28:71:514:380:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:fluctuations in test scores that are likely to be associated with cheating.  The other indicator 
13:329:23964:28:28:71:531:352:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:summarizes the extent to which answer strings in a classroom appear unusual or suspicious.  In 
13:330:24059:28:27:71:527:324:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:this section, we discuss informally the indicators we use to detect cheating, and then provide a 
13:331:24156:27:28:71:534:297:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:concrete example that compares data from two actual classrooms: one in which there appears to 
13:332:24250:28:27:71:530:269:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:be cheating and one in which there does not.  Readers interested in a more rigorous description 
13:333:24346:27:28:71:395:242:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of how the indicators are constructed are directed to the Appendix. 
13:334:24414:28:28:107:532:214:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:In selecting our measures of cheating, we focus on detecting teacher actions that lead to 
13:335:24504:28:32:71:532:186:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:large, artificial increases in test scores for a large number of students in the class.8  By focusing

13:337:24664:7:16:71:523:147:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:8We have no way of knowing whether the patterns we observe arise because a teacher explicitly alters students’ 
13:338:24775:16:11:71:515:131:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:answer sheets, directly provides answers to students during a test, or perhaps makes test materials available to 
13:339:24888:11:12:71:538:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:students in advance of the exam (for instance, by teaching a reading passage that is on the test).  If we had access to 
13:340:25008:12:0:71:540:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:the actual exams, it might be possible to distinguish between these scenarios through an analysis of erasure patterns. 
14:341:25129:0:27:71:539:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:on the entire classroom, we are unlikely to misclassify cheating by individual students as teacher 
14:342:25228:27:28:71:506:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheating.  Teacher actions such as “teaching to the test” or allowing students extra time to 
14:343:25321:28:27:71:507:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:complete exams are not likely to be detected by our measures because they are unlikely to 
14:344:25411:27:28:71:405:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f4:B:generate sufficiently unusual response patterns in the answer strings. 
14:345:25481:28:28:107:528:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Within this already restrictive definition of teacher cheating, we narrow our focus even 
14:346:25570:28:27:71:531:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:further by excluding a particular form of cheating that appears to be quite prevalent in the data: 
14:347:25669:27:28:71:527:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:teachers randomly filling in answers left blank by students.  For example, in some classrooms, 
14:348:25764:28:27:71:537:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:almost every student will end the test with a long string of “B’s” or an alternating pattern of “B” 
14:349:25864:27:28:71:527:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and “C.”   The fact that almost all students in the class coordinate on the same pattern strongly 
14:350:25962:28:27:71:541:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:suggests that the students themselves did not fill in the blanks, or were under explicit instructions 
14:351:26064:27:28:71:524:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:by the teacher to do so.  Since there is no penalty for guessing on the test, filling in the blanks 
14:352:26164:28:28:71:532:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:can only increase student test scores.  While this type of teacher behavior is likely to be viewed 
14:353:26263:28:27:71:521:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:by many as unethical, we do not make it the focus of our analysis because (1) it is difficult to 
14:354:26360:27:28:71:516:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:provide definitive evidence of such behavior (a teacher could argue that he or she instructed 
14:355:26454:28:27:71:521:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:students well in advance of the test to fill in all blanks with the letter “C” as part of good test-
14:356:26554:27:28:71:477:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:taking strategy), and (2) in our minds it is categorically different than a teacher who 
14:357:26642:28:28:71:378:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:systematically changes student responses to the correct answer.

14:360:26764:28:27:107:520:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Given that the aim of cheating is to raise test scores, an obvious potential indicator of 
14:361:26854:27:28:71:531:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:teacher cheating is a classroom that experiences unexpectedly large gains in test scores relative 
14:362:26952:28:0:71:524:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to how those same students tested in the previous year.  Since test score gains that result from 
15:363:27051:0:27:71:523:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheating do not represent real gains in knowledge, there is no reason to expect the gains to be 
15:364:27147:27:28:71:525:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sustained on future exams taken by these students (unless, of course, next year’s teachers also 
15:365:27243:28:27:71:541:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheat on behalf of the students).  Thus, large gains due to cheating should be followed by smaller 
15:366:27342:27:28:71:539:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:than usual test score gains for these students in the following year.  In contrast, if large test score 
15:367:27446:28:28:71:508:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:gains are due to a talented teacher, the student gains are likely to have a greater permanent 
15:368:27540:28:27:71:343:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:component, even if some regression to the mean occurs. 
15:369:27595:27:28:107:531:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:In practice, the choice of a cutoff for what represents an “unexpectedly” large test score 
15:370:27686:28:27:71:533:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:gain or loss is somewhat arbitrary.  Our admittedly simple approach is to rank each classroom’s 
15:371:27782:27:28:71:524:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:average test score gains relative to all other classrooms in that same subject, grade, and year,9 
15:372:27879:28:29:71:249:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and construct the following statistic: 
15:373:27918:29:32:107:417:431:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:?:(3) 21,,2,,)_1()_(+−+=tbctbccbtgainrankgainrankSCORE 
15:374:27970:32:28:71:540:399:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:where rank_gaincbt is the percentile rank for class c in subject b in year t.  Classes with relatively 
15:375:28073:28:27:71:541:371:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:big gains on this year’s test and relatively small gains on next year’s test will have high values of 
15:376:28175:27:28:71:538:344:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f3:B:SCORE.  Squaring the individual terms gives more relatively more weight to big test score gains 
15:377:28271:28:28:71:534:316:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:this year and big test score declines the following year.10  In the empirical analysis, we consider 
15:378:28371:28:27:71:535:288:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:three possible cutoffs for what it means to have a “high” value on SCORE, corresponding to the 
15:379:28466:27:28:71:394:261:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:80th, 90th, and 95th percentiles among all classrooms in the sample. 
15:380:28535:28:33:107:110:233:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:?: 
15:381:28535:33:7:215:218:200:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:?:                                                           
15:382:28593:7:16:71:513:193:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:9 We also experimented with more complicated mechanisms for defining large or small test score gains  (e.g., 
15:383:28702:16:11:71:542:177:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:predicting each student’s expected test score gain as a function of past test scores and background characteristics and 
15:384:28822:11:12:71:538:166:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:computing a deviation measure for each student which was then aggregated to the classroom level), but because the 
15:385:28936:12:11:71:537:154:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:results were similar we elected to use the simpler method.  We have also defined gains and losses using an absolute 
15:386:29052:11:12:71:504:143:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:metric (e.g., where gains in excess of 1.5 or 2 grade equivalents are considered unusually large), and obtain 
15:387:29162:12:7:71:151:131:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:comparable results. 
15:388:29182:7:16:71:517:124:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:10  In the following year the students who were in a particular classroom are typically scattered across multiple 
15:389:29296:16:0:71:394:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:classrooms.  We base all calculations off of the composition of this year’s class. 
16:390:29381:0:27:71:318:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:Cheating Indicator #2:  Suspicious Answer Strings 
16:391:29430:27:28:107:533:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Teacher cheating, particularly if accomplished by the teacher actually changing answers 
16:392:29518:28:27:71:522:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:on test forms, is likely to leave a discernible trail in student answer strings.  The quickest and 
16:393:29617:27:28:71:502:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:easiest way for a teacher to cheat is to alter the same block of consecutive questions for a 
16:394:29710:28:28:71:512:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:substantial portion of students in the class.  More sophisticated interventions might involve 
16:395:29804:28:27:71:526:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:skipping some questions so as to avoid a large block of identical answers, or altering different 
16:396:29901:27:28:71:279:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:blocks of questions for different students.   
16:397:29947:28:27:107:535:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:We combine four different measures of how suspicious a classroom’s answer strings are 
16:398:30033:27:28:71:519:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in determining whether a classroom may be cheating.  The first measure focuses on the most 
16:399:30124:28:27:71:534:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:unlikely block of identical answers given by students on consecutive questions.  Using past test 
16:400:30221:27:28:71:518:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:scores, future test scores, and background characteristics, we predict the likelihood that each 
16:401:30317:28:28:71:519:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:student will give each possible answer (A, B, C or D) on every question using a multinomial 
16:402:30409:28:27:71:529:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:logit.  This means that each student’s predicted probability of choosing a particular response is 
16:403:30507:27:28:71:536:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:identified by the likelihood that other students (in the same year, grade and subject) with similar 
16:404:30607:28:27:71:530:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:background characteristics will choose that response.  We then search over all combinations of 
16:405:30702:27:28:71:531:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:students and consecutive questions to find the block of identical answers given by students in a 
16:406:30799:28:28:71:542:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:classroom least likely to have arisen by chance.11  The more unusual is the most unusual block of 
16:407:30897:28:27:71:530:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:test responses (adjusting for class size and the number of questions on the exam, both of which 
16:408:30993:27:35:71:517:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:increase the possible combinations over which we search), the more likely it is that cheating 
16:409:31087:35:7:215:218:177:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:?:                                                           
16:410:31145:7:16:71:520:170:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:11  Note that we do not require the answers to be correct.  Indeed, in many classrooms, the most unusual strings 
16:411:31258:16:11:71:511:154:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:include some incorrect answers.  Note also that these calculations are done under the assumption that a given 
16:412:31368:11:12:71:535:143:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:student’s answers are uncorrelated (conditional on observables) across questions on the exam, and that answers are 
16:413:31483:12:11:71:540:131:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:uncorrelated across students.  Of course, this assumption is unlikely to be true.  Since all of our comparisons rely on 
16:414:31603:11:12:71:541:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:the relative unusualness of the answers given in different classrooms, this simplifying assumption is not problematic 
16:415:31721:12:0:71:352:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:unless the correlation within and across students varies by classroom. 
17:416:31794:0:27:71:540:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:occurred.  Thus, if ten very bright students in a class of thirty give the correct answers to the first 
17:417:31898:27:28:71:542:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:five questions on the exam (typically the easier questions), the block of identical answers will not 
17:418:31999:28:27:71:525:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:appear unusual.  In contrast, if all fifteen students in a low-achieving classroom give the same 
17:419:32096:27:28:71:540:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:correct answers to the last five questions on the exam (typically the harder questions), this would 
17:420:32196:28:28:71:174:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:appear quite suspect. 
17:421:32218:28:27:107:492:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The second measure of suspicious answer strings involves the overall degree of 
17:422:32297:27:28:71:534:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:correlation in student answers across the test.  When a teacher changes answers on test forms, it 
17:423:32395:28:27:71:513:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:presumably increases the uniformity of student test forms across students in the class.  This 
17:424:32489:27:28:71:523:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:measure is meant to capture more general patterns of similarity in student responses that goes 
17:425:32584:28:27:71:535:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:beyond just identical blocks of answers.  Based on the results of the multinomial logit described 
17:426:32682:27:28:71:533:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:above, for each question and each student we create a measure of how unexpected the student’s 
17:427:32776:28:28:71:514:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:response was.  We then combine the information for each student in the classroom to create 
17:428:32867:28:27:71:528:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:something akin to the within-classroom correlation in student responses.  This measure will be 
17:429:32962:27:28:71:542:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:high if students in a classroom tend to give the same answers on many questions, especially if the 
17:430:33061:28:27:71:531:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:answers given are unexpected, i.e. correct answers on hard questions or systematic mistakes on 
17:431:33156:27:28:71:150:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:easy questions.  
17:432:33173:28:28:107:532:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Of course, within-classroom correlation may arise for many reasons other than cheating 
17:433:33260:28:27:71:506:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(e.g., the teacher may emphasize certain topics during the school year).  Therefore, a third 
17:434:33353:27:28:71:529:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:indicator of potential cheating is a high variance in the degree of correlation across questions.  
17:435:33452:28:27:71:529:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:That is, on some questions students’ answers are highly correlated, but on other questions they 
17:436:33548:27:28:71:526:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:are not.  If the teacher changes answers for multiple students on selected questions, the within-
17:437:33645:28:0:71:538:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:class correlation on those particular questions will be extremely high, while the degree of within-
18:438:33746:0:27:71:539:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:class correlation on other questions is likely to be typical.  This leads the cross-question variance 
18:439:33848:27:28:71:380:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in correlations to be larger than normal in cheating classrooms.  
18:440:33914:28:27:107:542:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Our final indicator compares the answers that students in one classroom give compared to 
18:441:34003:27:28:71:533:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:other students in the system who take the identical test and get the exact same score.  Questions 
18:442:34101:28:28:71:508:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:vary significantly in difficulty.  The typical student will answer most of the easy questions 
18:443:34195:28:27:71:532:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:correctly and get most of the hard questions wrong (where “easy” and “hard” are based on how 
18:444:34288:27:28:71:536:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:well students of similar ability do on the question).  If students in a class systematically miss the 
18:445:34390:28:27:71:502:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:easy questions while correctly answering the hard questions, this may be an indication of 
18:446:34480:27:28:71:118:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheating. 
18:447:34490:28:27:107:527:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Our overall measure of suspicious answer strings is constructed in a manner parallel to 
18:448:34578:27:28:71:536:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:our measure of unusual test score fluctuations.  Within a given subject, grade, and year, we rank 
18:449:34676:28:28:71:525:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:classrooms on each of these four indicators, and then take the sum of squared ranks across the

18:456:35021:27:28:107:533:206:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Figure 2, which presents student answer strings test scores for two classrooms, provides 
18:457:35110:28:28:71:529:178:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:an example of how our cheating indicators work in practice.  The top panel of data is a class in 
18:458:35207:28:0:71:497:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:which we suspect teacher cheating took place; the bottom panel corresponds to a typical 
19:459:35297:0:27:71:513:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:classroom.  Each row in Figure 2 represents one student’s answers to each item on the test.  
19:460:35390:27:28:71:534:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Columns correspond to the different questions asked.  The letter “A,” “B,” “C,” or “D” means a 
19:461:35485:28:27:71:528:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:student provided the correct answer.  If a number is entered, the student answered the question 
19:462:35581:27:28:71:520:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:incorrectly, with “1” corresponding to a wrong answer of “A,” “2" corresponding to a wrong 
19:463:35672:28:28:71:543:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:answer of “B,” etc.  On the right-hand side of the table, we also present student test scores for the 
19:464:35774:28:27:71:261:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:preceding, current, and following year. 
19:465:35814:27:28:107:541:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Focusing first on the patterns in the answer strings in Figure 2, we see that for most of the 
19:466:35908:28:27:71:529:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:test, correct and incorrect answers are sporadically interspersed with no discernible pattern.  In 
19:467:36007:27:28:71:509:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the top panel of the figure, however, over half of the students in the class provide the same 
19:468:36101:28:27:71:531:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:answers to nine consecutive questions towards the end of the test, suggesting teacher cheating.  
19:469:36198:27:28:71:533:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:That places the classroom in the 99th percentile on our first measure of suspicious strings which 
19:470:36296:28:28:71:536:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:focuses on blocks of identical answers.   In the bottom panel, the most unusual block of answers 
19:471:36393:28:27:71:533:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is the “2CAD2C” given by two students (the fifth and sixth students listed) starting on question 
19:472:36490:27:28:71:469:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:23 of the test.  The bottom classroom ranks in the 43rd percentile on this measure. 
19:473:36574:28:27:107:514:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Questions on which students in our two sample classrooms have somewhat elevated 
19:474:36654:27:28:71:537:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:within-class correlations are demarcated by an “*” at the bottom of the column corresponding to 
19:475:36750:28:28:71:488:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that question.  For cases of extreme correlations, an “!” is given.  Not surprisingly, the 
19:476:36841:28:27:71:498:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:correlation is very high on the questions that are part of the suspicious string in the class 
19:477:36935:27:28:71:506:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:suspected of cheating.  It is also somewhat elevated on the block of questions with similar 
19:478:37027:28:27:71:519:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:answers in the non-cheating classroom.  For the remaining parts of the exam, the indicator is 
19:479:37121:27:26:71:527:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:similar across the two classrooms.  The within-class degree of correlation in the top classroom

19:481:37403:7:0:71:521:124:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:12  Because different subjects and grades have differing numbers of questions, it is difficult to make meaningful 
20:482:37519:0:27:71:526:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:places it at the 99th percentile among classrooms.  The bottom class, in contrast, is in the 49th 
20:483:37617:27:28:71:505:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percentile on this measure.  With respect to the variance in within-class correlation across 
20:484:37710:28:27:71:455:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:questions, the top class is at the 99th percentile; the bottom class is at the 32nd.

20:486:37885:28:28:71:522:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:measure of suspicious strings – the degree to which students in this class tend to get the same 
20:487:37981:28:27:71:539:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:questions right and wrong as students in other classes.  Because the questions near the end of the

20:489:38179:28:27:71:526:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:students in this first class look very unusual relative to other students in the system.  The class 
20:490:38279:27:28:71:532:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:once again ranks near the 99th percentile on this measure, compared to only the 17th percentile 
20:491:38375:28:27:71:231:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for the class in the bottom panel.

20:493:38497:28:28:71:531:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:scores in the previous year are similar for the two classes.  On that year’s test, however, the top 
20:494:38597:28:27:71:499:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:classroom suspected of cheating experienced an enormous jump in test scores (1.7 grade

20:496:38781:28:27:71:533:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:year).  The bottom classroom had a typical gain.  In the following year, students in the top class 
20:497:38880:27:28:71:517:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:actually see test score declines on average, whereas students in the bottom panel continue to 
20:498:38974:28:28:71:527:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:progress at a normal rate.  Note also that it is only the students in the top panel who are part of 
20:499:39074:28:27:71:521:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the unusual answer strings that exhibit enormous test score gains followed by large declines.

21:508:39819:28:28:107:512:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Elementary students in Chicago public schools take a standardized, multiple-choice 
21:509:39902:28:27:71:511:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:achievement exam known as the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS).  The ITBS is a national, 
21:510:39991:27:28:71:541:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:norm-referenced exam with a reading comprehension section and three separate math sections.13

21:512:40181:27:28:71:521:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:schools administer the exams to first and second grade students as well, although this is not a 
21:513:40277:28:27:71:157:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:district mandate.

21:515:40387:28:28:71:509:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:each student, we have the question-by-question answer string on each year’s ITBS reading

21:517:40573:27:28:71:503:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and future test scores, and demographic variables including age, sex, race, and free lunch 
21:518:40664:28:27:71:509:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:eligibility. We also have information about school-level characteristics including mobility, 
21:519:40757:27:28:71:525:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:poverty and attendance rates, racial composition and average teacher characteristics including

21:522:41030:27:35:71:327:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:classrooms or to track a particular teacher over time.

21:524:41143:7:16:71:497:170:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:13 There are also other parts of the test which are either not included in official school reporting (spelling, 
21:525:41255:16:11:71:520:154:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:punctuation, grammar) or are given only in select grades (science and social studies), for which we do not have 
21:526:41367:11:7:71:123:143:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:information. 
21:527:41380:7:16:71:542:136:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:14  We exclude eighth graders because our algorithm requires test score data for the following year and the ITBS test 
21:528:41498:16:12:71:540:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:is not administered to ninth graders.  Another standardized test is given to ninth graders, but a substantial fraction of 
21:529:41620:12:0:71:435:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:the students fail to take that test and it is not directly comparable to the elementary exams. 
22:530:41717:0:27:107:536:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Because our cheating proxies rely on comparisons to past and future test scores, we drop

22:535:42185:28:27:71:510:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Consequently, we drop all classrooms for which we have fewer than ten valid students in a

22:544:42988:28:27:71:528:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:classrooms we classify as likely to have cheated.  Classrooms we suspect of cheating are more 
22:545:43082:27:28:71:464:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:likely to be subject to the accountability policies and students in these classes are

22:547:43266:28:27:71:427:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:do not differ much between the whole sample and the suspected cheaters. 
22:548:43338:27:28:107:523:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The ITBS exams are administered over a week long period in early May.  Third grade

23:562:44636:28:27:71:541:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:copies of the actual exams, although school officials acknowledge that a number of teachers each 
23:563:44733:27:28:71:524:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:year do so.  The CPS has administered three different versions of the ITBS between 1993 and

23:567:45039:28:27:71:542:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:guessing, so that a student’s raw score is simply calculated as the sum of correct responses on the 
23:568:45139:27:28:71:514:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:exam.  The raw score is then translated into a metric known as grade equivalents, which are 
23:569:45231:28:55:71:517:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:normed so that a student at the 50th percentile in the nation scores at the eighth month of her 
23:570:45327:55:12:539:542:212:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:?:                                                                                                                                                                                           
23:571:45513:12:7:71:509:200:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:student transferred into the CPS system in the current year or left the system prior to the next year of testing. 
23:572:45627:7:16:71:523:193:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:16The mathematics and reading tests measure basic skills.  The reading comprehension exam consists of three to 
23:573:45738:16:11:71:539:177:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:eight short passages followed by up to nine questions relating to the passage.  The passages include poetry, fictional 
23:574:45857:11:12:71:533:166:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:stories, and narratives on historical, scientific or literary topics.  The questions assess factual recall (e.g., Who was 
23:575:45979:12:11:71:516:154:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:the main character in the story?) as well as critical analysis (e.g., What was the main idea of the passage?) and 
23:576:46093:11:12:71:532:143:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:interpretation (e.g., How do you think Jose felt at the end of the story?).  The math exam consists of three sections 
23:577:46211:12:7:71:330:131:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:that assess number concepts, problem-solving and computation. 
23:578:46273:7:16:71:533:124:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:17 These three forms are used for re-testing, summer school testing, and mid-year testing as well, so that it is likely 
23:579:46393:16:0:71:399:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:that over the years, teachers have seen the same exam on a number of occasions.  
24:580:46476:0:27:71:530:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:current grade.  For example, an average third grader taking the test in the eighth month of third 
24:581:46574:27:28:71:536:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:grade will score a 3.8.  Similarly, a sixth grader that scores a 5.8 is one year behind grade level.

24:583:46676:27:28:71:285:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:V. Estimating the Prevalence of Cheating 
24:584:46717:28:28:107:515:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:We undertake a determination of the prevalence of cheating in three steps.  First, we 
24:585:46803:28:27:71:530:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:analyze whether our cheating measures are actually effective at detecting cheating.  To do this, 
24:586:46900:27:28:71:542:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:we artificially alter student answers in ways that might mimic teacher cheating and then see if we 
24:587:46999:28:27:71:519:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:catch the classrooms for which we ourselves have cheated.  In addition, we also alter student 
24:588:47093:27:28:71:514:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:answers in a way that may reflect a class that has large, legitimate test score gains due to an 
24:589:47189:28:27:71:537:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:outstanding teacher, demonstrating that our measures are much less likely to mistakenly classify 
24:590:47286:27:28:71:537:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:such gains as cheating.  Second, we examine the empirical distribution of our cheating measures 
24:591:47382:28:28:71:533:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in the portion of the sample unlikely to be heavily contaminated by cheating.  This provides the 
24:592:47479:28:27:71:533:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:basis for constructing a non-cheating counterfactual against which the actual data is compared.  
24:593:47576:27:28:71:462:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Finally, we present the basic findings with respect to the estimated cheating rate. 
24:594:47660:28:27:71:74:322:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:F: 
24:595:47660:27:28:71:393:295:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:C:a) Do the cheating measures actually detect cheating classrooms? 
24:596:47725:28:28:107:507:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Because we do not know which classrooms are cheating, we have no direct way of 
24:597:47804:28:27:71:502:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:knowing whether our measures actually detect cheating.  One indirect way of testing this 
24:598:47893:27:28:71:537:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:hypothesis, however, is to simulate cheating and then ascertain whether our measures detect this 
24:599:47990:28:27:71:537:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:artificial cheating.  In this section, we simulate two different types of teacher cheating.  The first 
24:600:48093:27:28:71:527:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is a very naive version, in which a teacher starts cheating at the same question for a number of 
24:601:48190:28:0:71:521:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:students and changes consecutive questions to the right answers for these students, creating a 
25:602:48287:0:27:71:477:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:block of identical and correct responses.  The second type of cheating is much more 
25:603:48371:27:28:71:528:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sophisticated: we randomly change answers from incorrect to correct for selected students in a 
25:604:48466:28:27:71:510:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:class.18  For the purposes of comparison, we also present results attempting to simulate the 
25:605:48559:27:28:71:525:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:effects of a good teacher inducing the same gain among students in the class.  The impact of a 
25:606:48654:28:28:71:508:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:good teacher will differ in two ways from a cheating teacher: (1) some of the gains will be 
25:607:48746:28:27:71:521:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:preserved in the following year, and (2) the students will not get random answers correct, but 
25:608:48841:27:28:71:540:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:rather, will tend to show the greatest improvement on the easiest questions that the students were 
25:609:48940:28:27:71:520:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:getting wrong.  For both types of cheating and the good teacher scenario, we run simulations 
25:610:49033:27:28:71:537:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:changing 3, 6 or 9 questions for 25, 50 or 100 percent of the students in the classroom.  We alter 
25:611:49132:28:27:71:538:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the answer strings for every classroom, one classroom at a time, tallying the fraction of the cases 
25:612:49232:27:28:71:525:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in which the artificially cheating classroom exceeds our strictest threshold (95th percentile) on 
25:613:49330:28:28:71:527:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:both ANSWERS and SCORE.  We present the results for 5th grade reading in 1993.  This grade 
25:614:49421:28:27:71:541:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and year was selected because we want our baseline sample to be as free of cheating as possible.  
25:615:49519:27:28:71:543:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:In theory, the incentives for teachers to cheat in that grade and year are low because this is before 
25:616:49621:28:27:71:522:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:accountability reforms and fifth-grade test outcomes were not widely publicized at that time.  
25:617:49716:27:28:107:534:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Table 2 reports the results of the simulation.  As a point of reference, 1.13 percent of the 
25:618:49809:28:28:71:530:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:classrooms in the actual data exceed the thresholds we use in the table for labeling a classroom 
25:619:49906:28:27:71:524:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:as cheating.  For the most minor case of cheating (3 questions for 25 percent of the class), our 
25:620:50003:27:28:71:515:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheating indicator picks up less than 4 and 2 percent respectively of the unsophisticated and 
25:621:50097:28:27:71:521:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sophisticated cheating. The good teacher is no more likely to be labeled a cheater in this case 
25:622:50193:27:26:71:518:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:than is a randomly drawn classroom in the actual data.  As the extent of cheating increases – 
25:623:50287:26:7:215:218:131:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:?:                                                           
25:624:50345:7:0:71:541:124:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:18  We have also experimented with forms of cheating with intermediate degrees of sophistication.  Not surprisingly, 
26:625:50464:0:27:71:528:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:either by increasing the number of students or the number of questions altered – the success of 
26:626:50560:27:28:71:539:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the algorithm improves greatly, but it is still far from perfect.  If six questions are altered for half 
26:627:50665:28:27:71:538:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the class, more than 50 percent of the unsophisticated cheaters are detected, as well as more than 
26:628:50764:27:28:71:538:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:one-third of the sophisticated cheaters.  The likelihood that a good teacher is labeled as a cheater 
26:629:50865:28:28:71:531:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is still less than 3 percent.  By the most extreme cases we examine (9 questions for 100 percent 
26:630:50962:28:27:71:522:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of the class), roughly 90 percent of classrooms are categorized as cheating.  In the case, good 
26:631:51058:27:28:71:532:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:teachers will be identified as cheating nearly 40 percent of the time as well.  Thus, to the extent 
26:632:51158:28:27:71:531:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that there are teachers capable of such remarkable feats (it implies that the mean test score gain 
26:633:51257:27:28:71:533:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in the classroom in one year is well over two grade-equivalents, something observed in roughly 
26:634:51352:28:27:71:506:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:one in 1,000 classrooms in our sample, even with cheaters included), there is a substantial 
26:635:51444:27:28:71:343:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:likelihood we will mistakenly label them as cheaters.19   
26:636:51502:28:28:107:534:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:In summary, our cheating indicators are quite effective at detecting extreme instances of 
26:637:51592:28:27:71:519:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheating, even if done in a sophisticated manner by the teacher.  Many more limited cases of 
26:638:51685:27:28:71:515:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheating will not be detected by our measures, particularly if the cheating is done cleverly.   
26:639:51781:28:27:71:505:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Thus, to the extent that actual cheating done by teachers is moderate in degree and/or of a 
26:640:51873:27:28:71:491:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sophisticated kind, many cheaters will slip through the cracks, and our estimates of the 
26:641:51962:28:28:71:538:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:prevalence of cheating classrooms are likely to be (perhaps very loose) lower bounds on the true 
26:642:52059:28:27:71:518:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:values. On the other hand, our algorithm does yield some false positives, which works in the 
26:643:52152:27:35:71:164:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:opposite direction. 
26:644:52172:35:11:539:542:177:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:?:                                                                                                                                                                                           
26:645:52358:11:12:71:541:166:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:the effectiveness of our measures in detecting moderately sophisticated types of cheating falls in between our ability 
26:646:52477:12:7:71:282:154:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:to detect cheating in the two polar cases we present. 
26:647:52531:7:16:71:540:147:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:19  To the extent this is a major concern (e.g., if these results were going to be used in disciplinary actions), there are 
26:648:52655:16:11:71:521:131:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:alternative measures that could be employed which are less likely to catch actual cheaters, but also dramatically 
26:649:52769:11:12:71:519:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:reduce the likelihood that a good teacher would falsely be accused of cheating.  One such measure would be to 
26:650:52879:12:0:71:383:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:require that most or all of the current year’s gain is lost in the following year. 
27:651:52964:0:27:71:74:708:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:F: 
27:652:52964:27:28:71:518:681:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:C:b) Projecting the distribution of the cheating measures in a counterfactual with no cheating  
27:653:53058:28:27:107:533:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:If we knew with certainty the classrooms that were cheating, then the distribution of our 
27:654:53148:27:28:71:515:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheating measures in non-cheating classrooms would be directly observable.20  Our sample, 
27:655:53238:28:28:71:503:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:however, is made up of an unknown mixture of cheating and non-cheating classes.  Since 
27:656:53325:28:27:71:528:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheating classrooms are likely to have large test score fluctuations and unusual answer strings, 
27:657:53422:27:28:71:517:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:they are likely to be concentrated in the upper tails, leaving the remainder of the distribution 
27:658:53519:28:27:71:536:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:relatively free of cheating. By observing patterns in that portion of the distribution, it is possible 
27:659:53622:27:28:71:509:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to make reasonable predictions as to what the upper tail might look like absent cheating. 21 
27:660:53714:28:27:107:533:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A: The top panel of Table 3 presents breakdowns of the fraction of cases in which SCORE 
27:661:53799:27:28:71:531:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is above each of our cutoffs, as a function of the quartile that ANSWERS falls into, omitting the 
27:662:53897:28:28:71:541:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:top quartile of ANSWERS because that is where the cheating classrooms are likely to be.  Among 
27:663:53992:28:27:71:526:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:classrooms with ANSWERS are in the 0-25th percentile (i.e. not suspicious at all), 16.3 percent 
27:664:54088:27:28:71:534:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:have test score gains above the 80th percentile, 6.2 percent are above the 90th percentile, and 2.3 
27:665:54188:28:27:71:530:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percent are above the 95th percentile.  As one moves to the right in the table, the answer strings 
27:666:54287:27:28:71:539:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:are becoming more suspicious.  The frequency of high values of SCORE rises slightly moving to 
27:667:54381:28:32:71:517:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the right, but the relationship is weak.  This mirrors the pattern presented earlier in Figure 1. 
27:668:54479:32:7:215:218:235:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:?:                                                           
27:669:54537:7:16:71:529:228:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:20Of course, if we knew which classrooms were cheating, then this assumption would not be necessary in the first 
27:670:54650:16:7:71:97:212:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:place. 
27:671:54657:7:16:71:538:205:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:21 There are two potential biases at work in this sort of analysis.  First, some cheating classrooms are likely to evade 
27:672:54778:16:12:71:522:189:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:our measures and slip into the sample we are describing as non-cheaters.  Cheating classrooms will probably be 
27:673:54889:12:11:71:529:177:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:especially prevalent in the 50-75th quartile – classes that are somewhat above average in terms of suspiciousness.  
27:674:55005:11:12:71:532:166:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:Thus, one might observe a spurious rise in the frequency of extreme values as one moves from classrooms that are 
27:675:55118:12:11:71:530:154:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:not all suspicious to those that are somewhat suspicious, simply because the fraction of undetected cheaters rises.  
27:676:55235:11:12:71:534:143:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:On the other hand, it may be the case that the degree of correlation between ANSWERS and SCORE may vary over 
27:677:55344:12:11:71:540:131:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:the distribution.  In particular, there may be a positive correlation between those two variables in the right-tail of the 
27:678:55467:11:12:71:486:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:distribution, even if teachers are not cheating.  This would lead us to overstate the number of cheaters..

28:680:55576:0:27:107:538:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The bottom panel of Table 3 reverses the exercise, showing how the likelihood of having 
28:681:55664:27:28:71:538:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:suspicious answer strings changes as one moves from low quartiles of SCORE to high quartiles.  
28:682:55759:28:27:71:511:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Note that the patterns are reversed.  Classes that are in the bottom quartile on SCORE have 
28:683:55851:27:28:71:526:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:relatively high rates of suspicious strings. The probabilities of suspicious strings for classes in 
28:684:55951:28:28:71:526:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the second and third quartile are nearly identical to one another, and much lower than those of 
28:685:56047:28:27:71:160:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the first quartile.   
28:686:56069:27:28:107:535:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The key question here is the frequency with which one would observe extreme values of 
28:687:56155:28:27:71:523:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:one of the cheating measures when the other cheating measure is also an outlier, assuming no 
28:688:56248:27:28:71:537:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheating occurred.  One can imagine a variety of sensible approaches to predicting the upper tail 
28:689:56346:28:27:71:528:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:using the information in Table 3.  For example, one could fit a linear or quadratic model to the 
28:690:56443:27:28:71:507:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:patterns observed in the lower portion of the distribution and extrapolate the estimates.  In 
28:691:56537:28:28:71:512:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:practice, however, the trends in the 0-75th percentile of the distribution are so weak that the 
28:692:56633:28:27:71:531:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:results we obtain are not sensitive to the precise formulation.  Consequently, we simply use the 
28:693:56730:27:28:71:526:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:values in the 50-75th percentile as our estimate of what would have happened in the upper tail, 
28:694:56826:28:27:71:160:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:absent cheating.

29:701:57120:27:28:71:539:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that are outliers on both the cheating measures, minus the number of classes we would expect by

29:703:57309:30:28:71:525:623:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:classrooms.  Guided by the results presented above, we compute ncS as the fraction of classes 
29:704:57403:28:31:71:542:595:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with SCORE above a certain threshold, conditional on being in the 50-75th percentile on answers, 
29:705:57500:31:27:71:186:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and vice-versa for ncA. 
29:706:57524:27:28:107:534:537:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A: The top panel of Table 4 presents our estimates of the percentage of classrooms that are 
29:707:57614:28:28:71:535:509:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheating on average on a given subject test (i.e. reading comprehension or one of the three math 
29:708:57711:28:27:71:538:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:tests) in a given year.  We present a 3 x 3 matrix of estimates corresponding to how stringent the 
29:709:57810:27:28:71:505:454:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:thresholds are for judging whether a classroom’s test score fluctuations and answer string 
29:710:57901:28:27:71:532:426:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:patterns qualify as suspicious.  The estimated prevalence of cheaters ranges from 1.1 percent to 
29:711:57998:27:28:71:532:399:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:2.1 percent, depending on the particular set of cutoffs used.  As would be expected, the number 
29:712:58094:28:28:71:492:371:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of cheaters is generally declining as higher thresholds are employed.  Nonetheless, it is 
29:713:58184:28:27:71:516:343:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:encouraging that over such a wide range of cutoffs, the range of estimates is relatively tight. 
29:714:58280:27:28:107:531:316:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The bottom panel of Table 4 presents estimates of the percentage of classrooms that are 
29:715:58368:28:27:71:536:288:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheating on any of the four subject tests in a particular year.  If every classroom that cheated did 
29:716:58469:27:28:71:529:261:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:so only on one subject test, than the results in the bottom panel would simply be four times the 
29:717:58566:28:28:71:519:233:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:results in the top panel.  In many instances, however, classrooms appear to cheat on multiple 
29:718:58660:28:62:71:474:205:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:subjects.  Thus, the prevalence rates range from 3.4-5.6 percent of all classrooms.22

29:720:58803:7:16:71:521:136:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:22  Computation of the overall prevalence is relatively complicated because it involves calculating not only how 
29:721:58916:16:12:71:521:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:many classrooms are actually above the thresholds on multiple subject tests, but also how frequently this would 
29:722:59028:12:0:71:519:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:occur in the absence of cheating.  The full programming solution to this problem is available from the authors.  
30:723:59143:0:27:107:501:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Table 5 presents breakdowns of cheating by grade and subject.  Rows in the table 
30:724:59224:27:28:71:532:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:correspond to grades and columns represent different subject tests.  Several interesting findings 
30:725:59322:28:27:71:534:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stand out.  The third grade has the highest cheating rates, which is likely due to the fact that this 
30:726:59424:27:28:71:506:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:grade is the only one in which teachers are permitted to administer the exams to their own 
30:727:59515:28:28:71:532:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:students.  Cheating rates also tend to be higher in sixth grade, which may be due to the fact that 
30:728:59614:28:27:71:490:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:this grade has traditionally been a focus of greater attention on the part of teachers and 
30:729:59705:27:28:71:534:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:administrators because statewide achievement exams are also administered in this grade.  If one 
30:730:59801:28:27:71:528:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:looks at specific subject tests, cheating rates are slightly higher on reading comprehension and 
30:731:59898:27:28:71:527:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the first and third math exams, while noticeably lower on the second math exam.  This may be 
30:732:59991:28:27:71:504:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:because the second math exam is located in the middle of the answer key, making it more 
30:733:60079:27:28:71:503:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:difficult to quickly change student answers.   In addition, in the upper grades, this section 
30:734:60173:28:28:71:519:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:consists largely of questions that ask students to interpret graphs, charts and tables, and most 
30:735:60270:28:27:71:541:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:students do relatively well on this section, so it is possible that teachers do not feel that they need 
30:736:60374:27:28:71:268:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to artificially inflate scores in this area.

30:739:60459:27:28:107:505:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:If accurate, the results above suggest cheating rates of 4-5 percent among Chicago

30:741:60637:27:28:71:518:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:strategy, a healthy skepticism towards our conclusions may be warranted. In this section, we

31:746:60983:27:28:107:523:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Our identification relies on assumptions about how variables will be distributed in the 
31:747:61071:28:27:71:522:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:tails of a distribution that is not directly observed.   It is conceivable that our assumptions are 
31:748:61171:27:28:71:508:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:inaccurate, falsely generating what appears to be evidence of cheating, even when no such 
31:749:61261:28:28:71:163:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheating occurred. 
31:750:61280:28:27:89:519:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:  As a test of this possibility, we randomly assigned students to hypothetical classrooms.  
31:751:61372:27:28:71:496:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:These synthetic classrooms thus consisted of groups of students who in actuality had no 
31:752:61460:28:27:71:514:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:connection to one another.  We then analyzed these hypothetical classrooms using the same 
31:753:61550:27:28:71:531:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:algorithm applied to the actual data.  As one would hope, no evidence of cheating was found in 
31:754:61645:28:27:71:532:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the simulated classes.  Indeed, the estimated prevalence of cheating was slightly negatve in this 
31:755:61743:27:28:71:518:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:simulation, i.e. classrooms with large test score increases in the current year followed by big 
31:756:61839:28:28:71:536:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:declines the next year were slightly less likely to have unusual patterns of answer strings.  Thus, 
31:757:61939:28:27:71:534:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:we conclude that there is no evidence that our identification approach finds cheating even when

31:763:62349:27:28:71:518:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:a cheating teacher this year.  In contrast, while there might be substantial mean reversion for

32:767:62663:27:28:71:523:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:year’s test score as a basis for labeling a classroom a likely cheater (as we generally do in our 
32:768:62761:28:27:71:535:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheating classification, see equation (2)).  We can, however, compare classrooms with large test 
32:769:62858:27:28:71:542:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:score gains this year that either do or do not have suspicious patterns of answer strings. The more 
32:770:62958:28:28:71:517:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:suspicious the answer strings, the more likely is cheating, and the greater the expected mean 
32:771:63052:28:27:71:287:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:reversion in the following year’s test scores. 
32:772:63099:27:28:107:513:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:  Table 6 presents the results of this analysis.  The top panel of the table restricts the 
32:773:63190:28:27:71:541:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sample to the ten percent of classrooms with the greatest test score gains in reading in the current 
32:774:63291:27:28:71:536:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:year, relative to other classes in that grade and year.  The middle panel and bottom panel look at 
32:775:63390:28:27:71:531:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the top 5 percent and top 1 percent respectively of classroom test score gains.23 Reported in the 
32:776:63488:27:28:71:536:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:table are the mean excess gain in these classes in the base year (i.e., the gains above and beyond 
32:777:63587:28:28:71:531:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the mean gain for all classrooms in the system on a given subject, grade, and test that year), the 
32:778:63686:28:27:71:541:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:excess gain for the same students the following year, and the percent of the base year excess gain 
32:779:63785:27:28:71:529:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that is maintained.  Columns in the table correspond to how suspicious the classroom’s answer 
32:780:63879:28:27:71:529:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:string patterns were: below the 50th percentile, 50th-80th percentile, 80th-95th percentile, 95th-
32:781:63977:27:28:71:512:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:99th, and greater than the 99th percentile.  We expect the fraction of cheating classrooms to 
32:782:64071:28:28:71:541:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:increase as the answer strings become more suspicious.  Consequently, the fraction of the current 
32:783:64169:28:27:71:542:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:year’s excess test score gain relative to the mean classroom in that subject, grade, and year that is 
32:784:64271:27:28:71:480:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:maintained the following year should decrease moving from left to right in the table. 
32:785:64357:28:27:107:506:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Looking first at the top panel of Table 6, among the ten percent of classes with the 
32:786:64442:27:26:71:517:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:greatest test score gains, those whose answer strings are not at all suspicious (below the 50th 
32:787:64537:26:7:215:218:131:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:?:                                                           
32:788:64595:7:0:71:519:124:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:23 Reiterating what was written above, it cannot be emphasized enough that this table differs from our previous 
33:789:64709:0:27:71:542:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percentile on ANSWERS) gain on average .59 grade equivalents more than the system-wide mean 
33:790:64801:27:28:71:510:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in the base year.  Students in these classrooms do perform slightly worse than expected the 
33:791:64893:28:27:71:534:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:following year (-.11 grade equivalents).  Nonetheless, at the end of the next year, these students 
33:792:64992:27:28:71:485:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:maintain 81 percent of the base year excess gain through the following year (i.e., (.59-
33:793:65080:28:28:71:536:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:.11)/.59=.81).  As one moves from left to right in the table towards classrooms more likely to be 
33:794:65178:28:27:71:518:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheating, an increasing fraction of the current year’s gains are lost, as predicted.  In the most 
33:795:65276:27:28:71:514:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:extreme cases of the one percent of the answer strings that are most suspicious, less than 13 
33:796:65370:28:27:71:523:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percent of the apparent gains in the current year evaporate in the next year’s test.24  Note also 
33:797:65468:27:28:71:530:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that classes with suspicious answer strings are greatly over-represented among those achieving 
33:798:65563:28:27:71:514:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:large test score gains, consistent with the prediction that our two cheating indicators will be 
33:799:65659:27:28:71:288:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:highly positively correlated in the upper tail. 
33:800:65707:28:28:107:513:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:One possible concern that arises from the top panel of the table is whether the mean 
33:801:65792:28:27:71:519:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:reversion is greater on the right-hand-side columns of the table simply because the base-year 
33:802:65886:27:28:71:531:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:gains are larger.  The bottom two panels of Table 6 demonstrate that this is not the case.  When 
33:803:65983:28:27:71:541:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the sample is restricted to classrooms whose test score gains are in the top five percent or top one 
33:804:66084:27:28:71:512:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percent of all classes, very similar patterns appear.  Classrooms that do not have suspicious 
33:805:66178:28:28:71:530:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:answer strings continue to exhibit little mean reversion, even though the base year gains in this 
33:806:66276:28:27:71:518:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:subset are even greater than the base year gains in the far right column of the top panel.  The 
33:807:66372:27:58:71:509:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:more suspicious the answer strings, the greater the mean reversion.  Thus, these results are 
33:808:66465:58:11:539:542:154:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:?:                                                                                                                                                                                           
33:809:66651:11:12:71:522:143:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:analysis in that we are in no way conditioning on the following year’s test scores, unlike when we construct our 
33:810:66764:12:7:71:150:131:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:cheating estimates. 
33:811:66784:7:16:71:504:124:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:24  We do not expect the test score gains to completely disappear because even among the classes with very 
33:812:66891:16:0:71:332:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:suspicious answer strings, not all of the classrooms are cheating. 
34:813:66960:0:27:71:522:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:consistent with the hypothesis that cheating is the explanation for the large number of classes 
34:814:67056:27:28:71:372:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with both suspicious answer strings and large test score gains. 
34:815:67120:28:27:107:110:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:?: 
34:816:67120:27:28:71:375:626:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:C:c) Do the same teachers and schools tend to cheat repeatedly? 
34:817:67182:28:28:107:512:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:If what we are detecting is truly cheating, then one would expect that a teacher who 
34:818:67267:28:27:71:520:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheats on one part of the test would be more likely to cheat on other parts of the test.  Also, a 
34:819:67365:27:28:71:523:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:teacher who cheats one year would be more likely to cheat the following year.  Finally, to the 
34:820:67460:28:27:71:540:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:extent that cheating is either condoned by the principal or carried out by the test coordinator, one 
34:821:67561:27:28:71:527:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:would expect to find multiple classes in a school cheating in any given year, and perhaps even 
34:822:67656:28:27:71:525:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that cheating in a school one year predicts cheating in future years. If what we are detecting is 
34:823:67754:27:28:71:521:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:not cheating, then one would not necessarily expect to find strong correlation in our cheating 
34:824:67849:28:28:71:490:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:indicators across exams for a specific classroom, across classrooms, or across years.25  
34:825:67938:28:27:107:536:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Table 7 reports regression results testing these predictions.  The dependent variable is an 
34:826:68030:27:28:71:531:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:indicator for whether we believe a classroom is likely to be cheating on a particular subject test 
34:827:68129:28:27:71:534:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:using our most stringent definition (above the 95th percentile on both cheating indicators).   The 
34:828:68228:27:28:71:530:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:baseline probability of qualifying as a cheater for this cutoff is 1.1 percent.  To fully appreciate 
34:829:68329:28:28:71:531:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the enormity of the effects implied by the table, it is important to keep this very low baseline in 
34:830:68429:28:27:71:503:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:mind.  We report estimates from linear probability models (probits yield similar marginal 
34:831:68519:27:46:71:355:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:effects), with standard errors clustered at the school level.  
34:832:68582:46:7:215:218:166:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:?:                                                           
34:833:68640:7:16:71:519:159:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:25 Alternatively, if one thought that cheating were an individual teacher phenomenon, but school improvement, 
34:834:68750:16:12:71:519:143:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:instructional quality or curricular content were a school-wide phenomena, then one might construe correlations 
34:835:68861:12:11:71:528:131:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:within schools and over time as evidence against cheating.  Given the fact that most teachers do not monitor their 
34:836:68976:11:12:71:540:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:own exams, and that the test coordinator plays such a large role in the testing process within each school, we tend to 
34:837:69095:12:0:71:220:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:think this scenario is less plausible.   
35:838:69138:0:27:107:533:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Column 1 of Table 7 shows that cheating on other tests in the same year is an extremely 
35:839:69226:27:28:71:534:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:powerful predictor of cheating in a different subject.  If a classroom cheats on exactly one other 
35:840:69325:28:27:71:523:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:subject test, the predicted probability of cheating on this test increases by over ten percentage 
35:841:69423:27:28:71:523:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:points.  Since the baseline cheating rates are only 1.1 percent, classrooms cheating on exactly 
35:842:69519:28:28:71:530:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:one other test are ten times more likely to have cheated on this subject than are classrooms that 
35:843:69617:28:27:71:539:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:did not cheat on any of the other subjects (which is the omitted category).  Classrooms that cheat 
35:844:69716:27:28:71:528:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:on two other subjects are almost 30 times more likely to cheat on this test, relative to those not 
35:845:69815:28:27:71:531:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheating on other tests.  If a class cheats on all three other subjects, it is 50 times more likely to 
35:846:69918:27:28:71:180:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:also cheat on this test. 
35:847:69943:28:27:107:533:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:There also is evidence of correlation in cheating within schools.  A ten percentage-point 
35:848:70033:27:28:71:525:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:increase in cheating classrooms in a school (excluding the classroom in question) on the same 
35:849:70127:28:28:71:505:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:subject test raises the likelihood this class cheats by roughly .016 percentage points.  This 
35:850:70221:28:27:71:537:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:potentially suggests some role for centralized cheating by a school counselor, test coordinator or 
35:851:70320:27:28:71:509:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the principal, rather than by teachers operating independently.  There is little evidence that 
35:852:70415:28:27:71:473:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheating rates within the school on other subject tests affects cheating on this test.   
35:853:70504:27:28:107:540:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:When making comparisons across years (columns 3 and 4), it is important to note that we 
35:854:70592:28:28:71:516:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:do not actually have teacher identifiers.  We do, however, know what classroom a student is 
35:855:70684:28:27:71:529:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:assigned to.  Thus, we can only compare the correlation between past and current cheating in a 
35:856:70779:27:28:71:533:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:given classroom.  To the extent that teacher turnover occurs or teachers switch classrooms, this 
35:857:70876:28:27:71:537:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:proxy will be contaminated by serious measurement error.  Even given this important limitation, 
35:858:70972:27:28:71:538:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheating in the classroom last year predicts cheating this year.  In column 3, for example, we see 
35:859:71071:28:0:71:532:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that classroom’s that cheated in the same subject last year are 9.6 percentage points more likely 
36:860:71171:0:27:71:510:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to cheat this year, even after we control for cheating on other subjects in the same year and 
36:861:71265:27:28:71:501:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheating in other classes in the school.  Column 4 shows that prior cheating in the school 
36:862:71356:28:27:71:408:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:strongly predicts the likelihood that a classroom will cheat this year.   
36:863:71430:27:28:107:110:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:?: 
36:864:71430:28:28:71:472:598:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:C:d) Is it really student cheating rather than teacher cheating that we are detecting?  
36:865:71516:28:27:107:495:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Although our explanation focuses on teachers, it is also conceivable that there is 
36:866:71599:27:28:71:520:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:something unusual about students in classes that we label as cheating (e.g., a particular set of 
36:867:71696:28:27:71:516:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:student skills, high effort at the beginning of the test but not at the end, students copying off 
36:868:71794:27:28:71:524:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:other student exams) that might lead to suspicious answer strings.  If that is the case, then one 
36:869:71892:28:27:71:538:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:would predict that the same students who have suspicious answer strings one year would also be 
36:870:71987:27:28:71:542:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:likely to have suspicious answer strings the next year – much as we observed above that cheating 
36:871:72084:28:28:71:539:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in a classroom one year predicts cheating in a classroom the next year. We test this hypothesis in 
36:872:72183:28:27:71:527:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:two ways.  First, for each student in a given subject and year, we compute how unlikely it was 
36:873:72278:27:28:71:529:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for the most unusual block of answers that student was part of to occur (this corresponds to the 
36:874:72375:28:27:71:510:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:first of the suspicious string measures we introduced in Section III).  We then calculate the 
36:875:72469:27:28:71:488:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:student-level correlation from one year to the next on that measure.  The correlation is 
36:876:72558:28:28:71:521:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:approximately .01, suggesting that students who are part of suspicious blocks of answers one 
36:877:72651:28:27:71:526:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:year are not especially likely to be part of suspicious blocks the following year.  Similarly, we 
36:878:72749:27:28:71:472:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:compare the same student across years to determine whether some students tend to 
36:879:72830:28:27:71:522:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:systematically get hard questions correct and easy questions wrong (the last of the suspicious 
36:880:72925:27:28:71:502:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:string measures we introduced).  The year-to-year correlation in that measure is .07.  The 
36:881:73016:28:0:71:509:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:absence in persistence in suspicious answer patterns over time for a given student makes it 
37:882:73110:0:27:71:506:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:unlikely that our results are being driven by student cheating, since one would expect that 
37:883:73202:27:28:71:537:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:students who cheat one year would be likely to cheat with high probability the next year as well. 
37:884:73300:28:27:107:110:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:?: 
37:885:73300:27:28:71:418:626:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:C:e) Are we mistaking emphasis on certain subject material for cheating? 
37:886:73371:28:28:107:527:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:If a math teacher spends several months on fractions with a particular class, one would 
37:887:73459:28:27:71:513:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:expect the class to do particularly well on all of the math questions relating to fractions and 
37:888:73555:27:28:71:531:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:perhaps worse than average on other math questions.26  Such patterns might wrongly lead us to 
37:889:73649:28:27:71:353:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:deem a classroom’s answer strings to be suspicious.27        
37:890:73710:27:28:107:499:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Table 8 shows OLS estimates of the relationship between whether a classroom is 
37:891:73789:28:27:71:542:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:categorized as a cheater and the nature of the across-question correlations in the classroom on the 
37:892:73889:27:28:71:541:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:first math exam.  Seven different math skills/areas are tested in this exam: numeration, geometry, 
37:893:73988:28:28:71:522:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:measurement, fractions, algebra, statistics and estimation.  The dependent variable in the first 
37:894:74085:28:27:71:513:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and third columns is the number of different item-types for the three and five questions in a 
37:895:74179:27:28:71:531:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:particular classroom that are most suspicious.  The dependent variable in the second and fourth 
37:896:74275:28:27:71:537:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:columns is a binary indicator of whether the three (five) most suspicious questions all fell in one 
37:897:74375:27:28:71:539:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:area.  Note first that the mean values, reported in brackets, show that there is generally very little 
37:898:74478:28:44:71:543:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:concentration in the types of questions that are most suspicious within a classroom.  For instance, 
37:899:74578:44:7:215:218:223:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:?:                                                           
37:900:74636:7:16:71:524:216:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:26 One might imagine a similar scenario on the reading exam. If a teacher spends an entire semester studying the 
37:901:74749:16:11:71:529:200:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:Underground Railroad, and the reading exam that year happens to include a passage on this topic, it would not be 
37:902:74862:11:12:71:536:189:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:surprising to find that an extremely high number of students in the class correctly answer all of the items relating to 
37:903:74982:12:11:71:533:177:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:this passage, which may appear as a highly suspicious answer string.  However, it is also likely that when teachers 
37:904:75098:11:12:71:530:166:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:cheat on the reading comprehension exam, they focus on a specific passage since each passage and the associated 
37:905:75210:12:11:71:539:154:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:questions are generally on the same page.  Thus, on the reading exam, it is difficult to distinguish between instances 
37:906:75329:11:7:71:320:143:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:of cheating and honest passage knowledge by the students.     
37:907:75391:7:16:71:535:136:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:27 Although there is no reason for such classrooms to have elevated test score gains or especially large losses in the 
37:908:75510:16:12:71:536:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:following year, which reduces concern that teacher emphasis on specific subject material will lead us to exaggerate 
37:909:75626:12:0:71:173:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:the degree of cheating.    
38:910:75655:0:27:71:537:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in the typical classroom the three most suspicious questions were spread over 2.4 different types 
38:911:75753:27:28:71:538:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of items, and in only 7.7 percent of classrooms did all three questions fall within the same type.   
38:912:75854:28:27:107:542:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The coefficient estimates in Table 8 suggest that the patterns in classrooms categorized as 
38:913:75946:27:28:71:481:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheaters were only slightly different than in other classrooms.  Focusing on the basic 
38:914:76033:28:28:71:536:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:specification in the top row of the table, the point estimates in columns (1) and (3) are small and 
38:915:76133:28:27:71:524:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:statistically insignificant.  The coefficient in column (4) is significantly higher in the cheating 
38:916:76233:27:28:71:541:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:classrooms.  That result, however, appears to be an artifact of the particular classification of item 
38:917:76335:28:27:71:538:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:types.  When one uses a more disaggregated classification scheme (the second row), or excludes 
38:918:76430:27:28:71:522:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the very broad category of numeration (the third row), any evidence that cheating classrooms 
38:919:76523:28:27:71:520:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:tend to have more concentration in their suspicious answers disappears. These results are not 
38:920:76617:27:28:71:425:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sensitive to the inclusion of a variety of classroom and school covariates.

38:923:76743:27:28:107:512:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:From the perspective of economics, perhaps the most interesting question related to 
38:924:76827:28:27:71:538:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:teacher cheating is the degree to which it is sensitive to incentives.  As noted in the introduction, 
38:925:76929:27:28:71:529:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:there were two major changes in the incentives faced by teachers and students over our sample 
38:926:77023:28:28:71:527:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:period.  Prior to 1996, ITBS scores were primarily used to provide teachers and parents with a 
38:927:77118:28:27:71:536:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sense of how a child was progressing academically.  Beginning in 1996 with the appointment of 
38:928:77212:27:28:71:520:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Paul Vallas as CEO of Schools, the CPS launched an initiative designed to hold students and 
38:929:77304:28:0:71:280:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:teachers accountable for student learning.   
39:930:77351:0:27:107:532:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The reform had two main elements.  The first was putting schools “on probation” if less 
39:931:77439:27:28:71:518:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:than 15 percent of students scored at or above national norms on the ITBS reading exams.28  
39:932:77531:28:27:71:531:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Probation schools that do not exhibit sufficient improvement may be reconstituted, a procedure 
39:933:77626:27:28:71:538:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that involves closing the school and dismissing or reassigning all of the school staff.29  It is clear 
39:934:77729:28:28:71:524:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:from our discussions with teachers and administrators that being on probation is viewed as an 
39:935:77823:28:27:71:533:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:extremely undesirable circumstance.  The second piece of the accountability reform was an end 
39:936:77917:27:28:71:503:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to social promotion – the practice of passing students to the next grade regardless of their 
39:937:78010:28:27:71:538:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:academic skills or school performance.  Under the new policy, students in third, sixth and eighth 
39:938:78108:27:28:71:540:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:grade must meet minimum standards on the ITBS in both reading and mathematics in order to be 
39:939:78201:28:27:71:516:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:promoted to the next grade.  The promotion standards were implemented in Spring 1996 for 
39:940:78290:27:28:71:524:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:eighth grade students and in Spring 1997 for third and sixth graders.  Promotion decisions are 
39:941:78385:28:28:71:404:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f4:B:based solely on scores in reading comprehension and mathematics.30 
39:942:78451:28:27:107:542:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Table 9 presents OLS estimates of the relationship between teacher cheating and a variety 
39:943:78541:27:28:71:412:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of classroom and school characteristics.31  The unit of observation is a 
39:944:78614:28:27:71:540:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:classroom*subject*grade*year.  The dependent variable is an indicator of whether the classroom 
39:945:78709:27:37:71:504:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheated.  Here we define cheating using our 95th percentile cutoff—that is, a classroom is 
39:946:78800:37:7:215:218:258:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:?:                                                           
39:947:78858:7:12:71:360:251:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:28The CPS did not use math performance to determine probation status. 
39:948:78928:12:16:71:542:239:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:29  Seven high schools have been reconstituted to date, although no elementary schools have suffered this fate.  For a 
39:949:79047:16:7:71:466:223:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:more detailed analysis of the probation policy, see Jacob (2001) and Jacob and Lefgren (2001b).   
39:950:79145:7:16:71:516:216:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:30 In 1997, the promotion standards for third, sixth and eighth grade were 2.8, 5.3, and 7.0 respectively, which 
39:951:79258:16:11:71:535:200:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:roughly corresponded to the 20th percentile in the national achievement distribution.  Students who do not meet the 
39:952:79374:11:12:71:517:189:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:standard in June are required to attend a six-week summer school program, after which they retake the exams.  
39:953:79484:12:11:71:518:177:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:Those students who pass the August exams move on to the next grade.  Students who again fail are required to 
39:954:79593:11:12:71:541:166:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:repeat the grade, with the exception of 15-year-olds who attend newly created “transition” centers.  In 1997, roughly 
39:955:79711:12:11:71:540:154:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:30-40 percent of the students in these grades attended summer school and 20 percent of third graders and 12 percent 
39:956:79827:11:12:71:525:143:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:of sixth and eighth graders were retained.  For a more detailed analysis of the social promotion policy, see Jacob 
39:957:79942:12:7:71:231:131:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:(2001) and Jacob and Lefgren (2001a). 
39:958:79980:7:16:71:538:124:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:31 Logit models evaluated at the mean yield comparable results, so the estimates from a linear probability model are 
39:959:80097:16:0:71:219:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:presented for ease of interpretation.  
40:960:80138:0:27:71:524:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:designated a cheater if its SCORE and ANSWERS are above the 95th percentile in that grade, 
40:961:80229:27:28:71:514:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:subject and year.32  In column 1, the policy changes are restricted to have a constant impact 
40:962:80323:28:27:71:504:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:across all classrooms.  We see that the introduction of the social promotion and probation 
40:963:80414:27:28:71:520:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:policies is positively correlated with the likelihood of classroom cheating, although the point 
40:964:80510:28:28:71:534:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:estimates are not statistically significant at conventional levels.  However, cheating does appear 
40:965:80609:28:27:71:523:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to be responsive to other costs and benefits.  Classrooms that tested poorly last year are much 
40:966:80705:27:28:71:515:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:more likely to cheat.  For example, a classroom with average student prior achievement one 
40:967:80796:28:27:71:521:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:classroom standard deviation below the mean is 23 percent more likely to cheat.  Classrooms 
40:968:80888:27:28:71:518:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with students in multiple grades are 65 percent less likely to cheat than classrooms where all 
40:969:80983:28:27:71:532:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:students are in the same grade.  This is consistent with the fact that it is likely more difficult for 
40:970:81086:27:28:71:511:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:teachers in such classrooms to cheat, since they must administer two different test forms to 
40:971:81179:28:28:71:540:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:students, which will necessarily have different correct answers.   Moreover, classes with a higher 
40:972:81278:28:27:71:535:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:proportion of students who are included in the official test reporting are more likely to cheat—a 
40:973:81376:27:28:71:536:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:10 percentage point increase in the proportion of students in a class who test scores “count” will 
40:974:81475:28:27:71:537:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:increase the likelihood of cheating by roughly 20 percent.  Teachers who administer the exam to 
40:975:81571:27:28:71:540:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:their own students are 0.67 percentage points—approximately 50 percent—more likely to cheat.  
40:976:81665:28:28:71:541:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Finally, there is no statistically significant impact on cheating of reusing a test form that has been 
40:977:81768:28:27:71:514:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:administered in a previous year.  That finding is of interest because it suggests that teachers 
40:978:81864:27:28:71:541:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:taking old exams and teaching the precise questions to students is not an important component of 
40:979:81961:28:41:71:522:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:what we are detecting as cheating (although anecdotal evidence suggests this practice exists). 
40:980:82056:41:7:215:218:143:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:?:                                                           
40:981:82114:7:16:71:523:136:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:32 The results are not sensitive to the cheating cutoff used.  Note that this measure may include error due to both 
40:982:82230:16:12:71:533:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:false positives and negatives.  Since the measurement error is in the dependent variable, it will simply decrease the 
40:983:82348:12:0:71:182:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:precision of our estimates.  
41:984:82379:0:27:107:512:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Much more interesting results emerge when we interact the policy changes with the 
41:985:82461:27:28:71:537:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:previous year’s test scores for the classroom.  For both probation and social promotion, cheating 
41:986:82559:28:27:71:541:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:rates in the lowest performing classrooms prove to be quite sensitive to the change in incentives.  
41:987:82659:27:28:71:516:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:In column 2, a classroom one-standard deviation below the mean increases cheating by 0.43 
41:988:82749:28:28:71:535:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percentage points in response to the school probation policy and roughly 0.65 percentage points 
41:989:82845:28:27:71:517:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:due to the ending of social promotion.  Given the baseline cheating rate of 1.1 percent, these 
41:990:82940:27:28:71:540:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:effects are substantial.  The magnitude of these changes are particularly large considering that no 
41:991:83040:28:27:71:534:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:elementary school on probation has ever been reconstituted since this policy was put into place, 
41:992:83137:27:28:71:479:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and that the social promotion policy has a direct impact on students, but not obvious 
41:993:83223:28:27:71:534:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:ramifications for teacher pay or rewards.33  A classroom one standard deviation above the mean 
41:994:83318:27:28:71:528:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:does not see any significant change in cheating in response to these two policies.  Such classes 
41:995:83415:28:28:71:540:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:are very unlikely to be located in schools at risk for being put on probation, and also are likely to 
41:996:83517:28:27:71:523:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:have few students at risk for being retained.   The specification shown in column 3 includes a 
41:997:83612:27:28:71:532:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:number of classroom and school characteristics, which do not appear to change the coefficients 
41:998:83707:28:27:71:523:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:on the policy variables.   Consistent with the prior achievement results, classrooms in schools 
41:999:83803:27:28:71:535:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with lower achievement, higher poverty rates and more Black students are more likely to cheat.  
41:1000:83899:28:67:71:522:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Interestingly, classrooms in schools with higher quality teachers are less likely to cheat while 
41:1001:83996:67:7:215:218:200:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:?:                                                           
41:1002:84054:7:16:71:540:193:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:33 While this trend is particularly disturbing due to the relatively minor incentives, given the relatively small number 
41:1003:84175:16:11:71:529:177:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:of classrooms engaged in cheating, it is unlikely that such explicit test manipulation has had a large impact on the 
41:1004:84292:11:12:71:517:166:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:average achievement levels in Chicago, or the observed increase in achievement since the introduction of high-
41:1005:84402:12:11:71:518:154:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:stakes testing.  Table 8 suggests that the accountability policies increased the likelihood of cheating in any one 
41:1006:84517:11:12:71:540:143:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:subject by roughly 0.5 to 1.0 percentage points (depending on whether the effects of social promotion and probation 
41:1007:84633:12:11:71:540:131:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:are additive and which grade/subject one considers).  Now suppose that a teacher manipulates the reading exams for 
41:1008:84748:11:12:71:528:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:his or her students in a manner that artificially raises their test scores by 2 grade equivalent (which is much larger 
41:1009:84867:12:0:71:553:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:than we actually observe in the data).  This would inflate the system-wide average reading levels by only 0.01 GEs.       
42:1010:84991:0:27:71:532:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:classrooms in schools with younger teachers are more likely to cheat.  Column 4 illustrates that 
42:1011:85088:27:28:71:483:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the effects on the policy variables are robust to including school*year fixed effects.34 
42:1012:85176:28:27:107:541:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:It is also interesting to examine for which students teachers change answers when they do 
42:1013:85266:27:28:71:535:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheat.  One might imagine that teachers would cheat for lower-achieving students, or those who 
42:1014:85361:28:28:71:537:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the teacher believed could or should have done better on the exam.  However, it is not clear how 
42:1015:85458:28:27:71:524:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:precisely teachers are able to target their cheating behavior.  It is likely that time pressure and 
42:1016:85558:27:28:71:538:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:concerns about detection will limit the time teachers spend on cheating, and a brief inspection of 
42:1017:85657:28:27:71:484:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:an answer key will only provide a rough idea of how the student would score without 
42:1018:85741:27:28:71:515:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:manipulation of his or her answers.  Table 10 presents estimates of the relationship between 
42:1019:85834:28:27:71:536:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:observable student characteristics and cheating.  The unit of analysis is a student and the sample 
42:1020:85933:27:28:71:534:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is restricted to students in classrooms that were categorized as cheating using the 95th percentile 
42:1021:86033:28:28:71:538:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cutoff.  The dependent variable takes on the value of one if an individual student’s answer string 
42:1022:86132:28:27:71:533:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and test score pattern was suspicious at the 95th percentile level, suggesting that the teacher had 
42:1023:86232:27:28:71:520:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheated for that student in the particular subject and year.  The results are not sensitive to the 
42:1024:86331:28:27:71:499:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:particular cutoffs used.  The first two columns include all cheating schools; the final two 
42:1025:86423:27:28:71:493:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:columns narrow the sample to low-achieving schools, where the cheating appears to be 
42:1026:86508:28:28:71:508:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:concentrated.  All of the specifications include fixed effects for classroom*year so that the 
42:1027:86602:28:27:71:540:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:coefficients are estimated off of variation across students within a particular classroom.  Because 
42:1028:86702:27:46:71:523:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:a student’s test score at t-1 is highly correlated with the cheating indicator (by definition), the 
42:1029:86802:46:7:215:218:166:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:?:                                                           
42:1030:86860:7:16:71:510:159:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:34 Another possible incentive that teachers might respond to is the likelihood of punishment.  Punishment for 
42:1031:86970:16:12:71:509:143:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:cheating, however, is extremely rare, with only two known instances of cheating teachers being disciplined.  
42:1032:87079:12:11:71:522:131:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:Beginning in 1996, CPS began doing audits of test scores.  Initially, these were mostly random in nature.  More 
42:1033:87191:11:12:71:533:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:recently, they have focused on classrooms with large test score gains.  Our data on audits is incomplete, however.  
42:1034:87307:12:0:71:529:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:When we included information on audits in the regressions, no statistically significant coefficients were obtained. 
43:1035:87425:0:27:71:540:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:equations are estimated using 2SLS where a student’s test scores at t-2 are used to instrument for 
43:1036:87524:27:28:71:245:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f4:B:the student’s t-1 achievement level. 
43:1037:87560:28:27:107:526:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:In column 1, teachers are roughly 6 percentage points more likely to cheat for students 
43:1038:87648:27:28:71:514:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:who scored in the second quartile (between the 25th and 50th percentile) in the prior year, as 
43:1039:87743:28:28:71:535:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:compared to students scoring at the third or fourth quartiles.  Interestingly, teachers appear least 
43:1040:87844:28:27:71:536:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:likely to cheat for the lowest-achieving students (the coefficient on the bottom quartile indicator 
43:1041:87944:27:28:71:506:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is negative although not statistically significant).  Teachers are also less likely to cheat for 
43:1042:88041:28:27:71:523:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:students who are excluded from test reporting, as would be expected. Teachers also appear to 
43:1043:88134:27:28:71:326:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:less frequently cheat for boys and for older students. 
43:1044:88189:28:27:107:509:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Column 2 presents an alternative specification that includes a linear measure of the 
43:1045:88274:27:28:71:501:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:student’s prior achievement along with the interaction between prior achievement and an 
43:1046:88362:28:28:71:499:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:indicator for the high-stakes testing regime (encompassing both the probation and social 
43:1047:88451:28:27:71:527:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:promotion policies). 35  Here we see that, prior to the introduction of the accountability policy, 
43:1048:88550:27:28:71:503:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:teachers were more likely to cheat for higher achieving students.  The shift by teachers to 
43:1049:88642:28:27:71:542:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cheating for lower-achieving students after accountability measures were introduced is consistent 
43:1050:88740:27:28:71:535:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with the change in incentives.  School probation is based on the fraction of students exceeding a 
43:1051:88838:28:28:71:536:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:minimum threshold of competence.  Student promotion requires a student meeting a hurdle well 
43:1052:88931:28:27:71:510:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:below the median student in the system.  Columns 3 and 4 demonstrate that the same basic 
43:1053:89020:27:28:71:364:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:relationships hold for the subset of lower-achieving schools.

43:1055:89082:41:7:215:218:143:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:?:                                                           
43:1056:89140:7:16:71:530:136:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:35 Ideally, one would also like to include interactions between prior student achievement and the social promotion 
43:1057:89255:16:12:71:541:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:and school probation policies in specifications that parallel Column 1.  Unfortunately, the standard errors become so 
43:1058:89373:12:0:71:259:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:large that no useful conclusions can be drawn. 
44:1059:89422:0:27:71:163:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f3:B:VIII.  Conclusion 
44:1060:89439:27:28:107:531:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:This paper develops an algorithm for determining the prevalence of teacher cheating on 
44:1061:89526:28:27:71:537:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:standardized tests and applies the results to data from the Chicago Public Schools.  Our methods 
44:1062:89623:27:28:71:509:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:reveal over 1,000 separate instances of classroom cheating, representing 4-5 percent of the 
44:1063:89715:28:28:71:542:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:classrooms.  Moreover, we find that teacher cheating appears quite responsive to relatively minor 
44:1064:89813:28:27:71:180:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:changes in incentives. 
44:1065:89836:27:28:107:532:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Our results suggest that the implementation of test-based accountability in schools must 
44:1066:89925:28:27:71:492:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:be approached with caution.  If accountability policies create strong incentives without 
44:1067:90014:27:28:71:516:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:instituting safeguards against cheating, we would predict substantial increases in teacher (or 
44:1068:90109:28:27:71:487:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:administrator) cheating.  This will not only decrease the effectiveness of the reform in 
44:1069:90198:27:28:71:510:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:identifying struggling schools or highlighting effective pedagogical practices, but will also 
44:1070:90292:28:28:71:518:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:undermine public confidence in school reform.  As high-stakes testing becomes increasingly 
44:1071:90383:28:27:71:516:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:widespread, these concerns will grow.  Fortunately, there are several, relatively inexpensive 
44:1072:90477:27:28:71:541:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:ways in which schools systems might prevent cheating.  Districts could hire an outside agency to 
44:1073:90574:28:27:71:520:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:proctor the exams rather than having teachers administer the tests.  Similarly, teachers in one 
44:1074:90670:27:28:71:390:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:school might be required to administer exams at another school.    
44:1075:90737:28:28:107:514:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:More generally, this paper fits into a small but growing body of research focused on 
44:1076:90822:28:27:71:534:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:identifying corrupt or illicit behavior on the part of economic actors (e.g. Porter and Zona 1993, 
44:1077:90921:27:28:71:513:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Fisman 2000, Di Tella and Schargrodsky 2001, Duggan and Levitt, forthcoming).  Because 
44:1078:91008:28:27:71:504:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:individuals engaged in such behavior actively attempt to cover their trails, the intellectual 
44:1079:91102:27:28:71:498:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:exercise associated with uncovering their misdeeds differs substantially from the typical 
44:1080:91192:28:0:71:534:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:economic application in which the researcher starts with a well defined measure of the outcome 
45:1081:91289:0:27:71:536:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:variable (e.g. earnings, economic growth, profits) and then attempts to uncover the determinants 
45:1082:91386:27:28:71:504:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of these outcomes.  In the case of corruption, there is typically no clear outcome variable, 
45:1083:91479:28:27:71:530:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:making it necessary for the researcher to employ non-standard approaches in generating such a 
45:1084:91573:27:28:71:505:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:measure.  We hope that the methods utilized in this paper provide some guidance to those 
45:1085:91662:28:0:71:303:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:seeking to identify corruption in other domains.
