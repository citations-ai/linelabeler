2:33:1726:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:Drugs like bevacizumab ($50,000 per treatment episode) and ipilimumab ($120,000 per episode) have
2:34:1823:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:fueled the perception that the launch prices of anticancer drugs are increasing over time. Using an
2:35:1922:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:original dataset of 58 anticancer drugs approved between 1995 and 2013, we find that launch prices,
2:36:2021:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:adjusted for inflation and drugs’ survival benefits, increased by 10%, or about $8,500, per year. Although
2:37:2127:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:physicians are not penalized for prescribing costly drugs, they may be reluctant to prescribe drugs
2:38:2226:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:with prices that exceed subjective standards of fairness. Manufacturers may set higher launch prices
2:39:2326:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:over time as standards evolve. Pricing trends may also reflect manufacturers’ response to expansions
2:40:2426:14:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:in the 340B Drug Pricing Program, which requires manufacturers to provide steep discounts to eligible

3:67:3191:0:20:72:140:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:Introduction 
3:68:3204:20:21:72:75:688:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
3:69:3204:21:21:108:503:667:144:Times:144:Times:?:In 2004, Genentech introduced the drug bevacizumab—brand name Avastin—for 
3:70:3278:21:20:72:531:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:patients with late stage colorectal cancer. The drug cost $50,000 per treatment episode and was 
3:71:3374:20:21:72:481:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:associated with an incremental increase in life expectancy of five months. Following 
3:72:3459:21:21:72:524:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:Genentech’s pricing announcement, newspapers ran stories with titles like “Cancer Weapons, 
3:73:3550:21:20:72:531:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:Out of Reach” in the Washington Post (Wittes 2004) and “Price of Cancer Drugs Called ‘Mind-
3:74:3641:20:21:72:535:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:Boggling’” in USA Today (Szabo 2004). Some Wall Street analysts worried that bevacizumab’s 
3:75:3732:21:21:72:520:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:pricing would prompt Congress to regulate drug prices (Anand 2007). By 2011, the backlash 
3:76:3822:21:21:72:515:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:against bevacizumab was a distant memory. Bristol-Myers Squibb set the price of its newly-
3:77:3912:21:20:72:504:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:approved melanoma drug ipilimumab—brand name Yervoy—at $120,000 for a course of 
3:78:3992:20:21:72:540:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:therapy. The drug was associated with an incremental increase in life expectancy of four months. 
3:79:4089:21:21:108:541:460:144:Times:144:Times:?:Drugs like bevacizumab and ipilimumab have fueled the perception that the launch prices 
3:80:4177:21:20:72:538:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:of new anticancer drugs and other drugs in the so-called “specialty” pharmaceutical market have 
3:81:4273:20:21:72:512:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:been increasing over time and that increases are unrelated to the magnitude of the expected 
3:82:4365:21:21:72:536:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:benefits (Experts in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia 2013; Kantarjian et al. 2013; Schrag 2004; Hall 
3:83:4459:21:20:72:495:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:2013). A commentary in The Lancet, a leading British medical journal, summarized the 
3:84:4544:20:21:72:535:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:conventional wisdom: “[T]he cost of the new generation of drugs is getting out of all proportion 
3:85:4641:21:21:72:535:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:to the added benefit” (Cavalli 2013). The public debate has focused on a handful of high-profile 
3:86:4738:21:20:72:524:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:drugs like bevacizumab. It is unclear if these drugs are outliers or reflect broader trends in the 
3:87:4837:20:21:72:117:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:industry. 
3:88:4847:21:21:108:539:274:144:Times:144:Times:?:In this paper we discuss the unique features of the market for anticancer drugs and assess 
3:89:4938:21:21:72:531:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:trends in the launch prices for 58 anticancer drugs approved between 1995 and 2013 in the US. 
3:90:5032:21:20:72:507:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:Drugs used to treat other conditions have also been closely scrutinized – most recently the 
3:91:5124:20:21:72:535:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:$84,000 hepatitis C treatment Sovaldi – but we restrict attention to anticancer drugs because the 
3:92:5222:21:21:72:511:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:use of survival time as a primary outcome measure provides a common, objective scale for 
3:93:5311:21:20:72:329:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:quantifying the incremental benefit of new products.  
3:94:5365:20:21:108:507:150:144:Times:144:Times:?:The market for anticancer drugs is economically significant. Within the market for 
3:95:5448:21:21:72:541:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:pharmaceuticals, anticancer drugs rank first in terms of global spending by therapeutic class: $91 
3:96:5547:21:0:72:534:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:billion in 2013, up from $71 billion in 2008 (IMS 2014). The US market size was $37 billion in 
4:97:5645:0:20:72:541:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:2013, of which one-third was spent on 10 patent-protected cancer drugs alone (Conti et al. 2013). 
4:98:5743:20:21:71:525:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:The market is also politically salient. Anticancer drugs figure prominently in discussions over 
4:99:5839:21:21:71:513:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:health reform, alternately symbolizing wasteful spending and biomedical progress. benefits 
4:100:5930:21:20:107:511:646:144:Times:144:Times:?:We find that anticancer drugs’ average benefit- and inflation-adjusted launch prices 
4:101:6015:20:21:71:512:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:increased by 10 percent annually, or an average of $8,500 per year, from 1995 to 2013. We 
4:102:6105:21:21:71:516:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:review the institutional features of the market for anticancer drugs, including generous third-
4:103:6200:21:20:71:491:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:party coverage that insulates patients from drug prices, the presence of strong financial 
4:104:6290:20:21:71:498:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:incentives for physicians and hospitals to use novel products, and the lack of therapeutic 
4:105:6381:21:21:71:539:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:substitutes. We argue that under these conditions, manufacturers are able to set the prices of new 
4:106:6480:21:21:71:523:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:products at or slightly above the prices of existing therapies, giving rise to an upward trend in 
4:107:6578:21:20:71:538:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:launch prices. Government-mandated price discounts for certain classes of buyers may have also 
4:108:6673:20:21:71:541:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:contributed to launch price increases as firms sought to offset the growth in the discount segment 
4:109:6772:21:21:71:346:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:by setting higher prices for the remainder of the market.

4:113:6855:21:20:107:520:377:144:Times:144:Times:?:The process by which firms establish the “launch prices” of new, branded drugs – the 
4:114:6940:20:21:71:530:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:prices firms set immediately following US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval – is 
4:115:7031:21:21:71:526:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:opaque, and relatively little work has been done on the subject.1 At the time of FDA approval, 
4:116:7126:21:20:72:517:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:most drugs are on-patent, and so manufacturers are temporary monopolists. They have wide 
4:117:7215:20:21:72:317:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:leeway, though not unlimited power, to set prices.  
4:118:7267:21:21:108:521:274:144:Times:144:Times:?:Reekie (1978) and Lu and Comanor (1998) studied the determinants of drugs’ launch 
4:119:7349:21:21:72:516:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:prices for drugs across multiple therapeutic categories. They found that prices are higher for 
4:120:7444:21:20:72:524:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:drugs that offer significant benefits compared to existing products. Hedonic pricing studies of

5:136:8515:20:21:72:532:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:with metastatic tumors, which means that the tumor has spread beyond its original site to a non-
5:137:8611:21:21:72:533:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:adjacent location. The vast majority of patients with metastatic disease will die of cancer. It has

5:139:8806:21:20:72:520:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:after they have undergone surgery or radiotherapy. Because most newly approved anticancer

5:143:9125:20:21:72:533:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:development of a number of new anticancer drugs. Almost 1,000 anticancer drugs are currently 
5:144:9218:21:21:72:521:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:in various phases of pre-approval testing, more than the number for heart disease, stroke, and 
5:145:9313:21:20:72:514:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:mental illness combined (IMS 2014; PhRMA 2014).  Many new drugs are approved for the 
5:146:9398:20:21:72:483:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:treatment of tumors with particular genetic markers. For example, the FDA approved 
5:147:9481:21:21:72:532:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:pertuzumab in 2012 for patients with metastatic breast cancer linked to a defective HER2 gene.

5:152:9916:21:20:71:540:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:Gains in survival time associated with recently approved anticancer drugs are typically measured 
5:153:10013:20:21:71:177:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:in months, not years.  
5:154:10036:21:21:107:535:191:144:Times:144:Times:?:Most anticancer drugs are approved by the FDA on the basis of one or more randomized 
5:155:10121:21:20:71:541:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:controlled trials. Some trials have an “active control”; patients are randomized to receive the new 
5:156:10221:20:21:71:542:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:drug or an alternative therapy. When a drug is sufficiently novel that it has no close substitutes or 
5:157:10323:21:0:71:542:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:it will be used in combination with existing drugs, patients in the control arm may be randomized 
6:158:10424:0:20:72:494:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:to receive the new drug or a placebo. Trials of anticancer drugs usually measure patient 
6:159:10513:20:21:72:494:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:outcomes in terms of the difference in survival between the treatment and control arms. 
6:160:10601:21:21:107:542:667:144:Times:144:Times:?:Some drugs are approved on the basis of single-arm trials. In single-arm trials, all patients 
6:161:10695:21:20:72:535:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:receive the new drug and there is no control group. Single-arm trials focus on short-term patient 
6:162:10793:20:21:72:502:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:safety rather than patient survival, and so they have a much shorter duration compared to 
6:163:10883:21:21:72:537:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:randomized control trials. The FDA grants approval for many leukemia and lymphoma drugs on 
6:164:10974:21:20:72:535:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:the basis of single-arm trials. Median survival among patients with these types of cancers is two 
6:165:11072:20:21:72:484:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:or more years. Requiring manufacturers of leukemia and lymphoma drugs to conduct 
6:166:11153:21:21:71:510:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:randomized trials to measure survival benefits could significantly delay the introduction of 
6:167:11246:21:21:71:532:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:potentially beneficial drugs. Single-arm trials can show that a drug is safe but cannot determine 
6:168:11344:21:20:71:535:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:whether the drug improves life expectancy. Physicians can observe survival in their own patient 
6:169:11440:20:21:71:535:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:populations, but it is probably difficult for individual physicians to draw sound inferences about 
6:170:11539:21:21:71:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:the quality of a new drug because their patient panels are not sufficiently large. Unlike single-
6:171:11636:21:20:71:425:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:arm studies, randomized trials establish efficacy as common knowledge.

6:174:11888:21:20:71:497:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:Woodward et al. 2007) or measuring patients’ willingness-to-pay (Goldman et al. 2010; 
6:175:11974:20:21:71:532:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:Lakdawalla et al 2012; Romley et al. 2012; Seabury et al. 2012; Snider et al. 2012). A common 
6:176:12068:21:21:71:536:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:finding is that that the dollar-denominated benefits associated with anticancer drugs are equal to 
6:177:12167:21:20:71:526:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:or exceed the cost of an episode of treatment.  However, willingness-to-pay estimates must be 
6:178:12261:20:21:71:522:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:interpreted cautiously in light of the fact that most patients mistakenly believe that anticancer 
6:179:12359:21:21:71:520:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:drugs cure cancer (Weeks et al. 2012). In addition, these past studies do not address trends in 
6:180:12455:21:21:71:537:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:launch prices. If new drugs have higher prices per unit of benefit, then we cannot assess the cost-

7:203:14260:21:21:72:518:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurers refused to cover a breast cancer treatment consisting of higher than normal doses of 
7:204:14354:21:20:72:530:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:anticancer drugs followed by a bone marrow transplant. Breast cancer patient advocacy groups 
7:205:14447:20:21:72:512:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:waged a high-profile campaign to secure coverage, and most insurers started paying for the 
7:206:14538:21:21:71:515:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:treatment. Randomized trials later found that it did not prolong survival, and physicians and 
7:207:14632:21:20:71:344:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:patients abandoned the procedure (Howard et al. 2011).

7:214:15183:21:20:72:536:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:approved the drug for the treatment of colorectal cancer in 2004 and then for treatment of breast 
7:215:15281:20:21:71:485:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:cancer in 2008 based on the results of a randomized trial. Results from two additional 
7:216:15368:21:21:71:482:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:randomized trials were later released in 2009. The trials found that patients receiving 
7:217:15456:21:0:71:524:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:bevacizumab experienced a statistically significant gain in “progression-free survival,” which 
8:218:15554:0:20:72:539:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:measures the period of time where the cancer is under control, but differences in overall survival 
8:219:15653:20:21:72:533:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:were small and not statistically significant. Based on these findings, the FDA revoked coverage 
8:220:15749:21:21:72:522:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:for bevacizuab’s breast cancer indication in 2011. However, an expert panel convened by the

8:222:15931:20:21:72:535:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:against removing bevacizumab from its list of appropriate breast cancer drugs. Faced with these

8:241:17584:21:20:72:542:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:drugs (Malin et al. 2013). Oncologists’ drug choices are responsive to profit margins (Conti et al.

9:251:18463:21:21:72:474:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurer bears the full cost of anticancer drugs for the remainder of the benefit year.2 
9:252:18550:21:20:72:531:625:144:Times:144:Times:B:Consequently, patients may be indifferent between a drug that costs $20,000 and one that costs 
9:253:18645:20:21:72:126:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:$100,000.  
9:254:18656:21:21:108:519:584:144:Times:144:Times:?:An analysis of private insurance claims data from 1997 to 2005 found that the annual 
9:255:18741:21:20:72:537:563:144:Times:144:Times:B:median out-of-pocket cost for the intravenous drug rituximab was $431 per year (Goldman et al. 
9:256:18836:20:21:72:525:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:2010). Patients’ costs were less than 2 percent of total spending on rituximab. Patients’ out-of-
9:257:18933:21:21:72:519:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:pocket costs for oral agents, which are covered under insurers’ pharmacy benefit, are higher. 
9:258:19027:21:21:71:537:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:Still, a separate analysis of claims found that cancer patients’ out-of-pocket costs were 5 percent 
9:259:19127:21:20:72:534:480:144:Times:144:Times:B:of total drug costs, and only 34 percent of patients faced per claim copayments in excess of $50 
9:260:19224:20:21:72:173:460:144:Times:64:Times:B:(Raborn et al. 2012). 
9:261:19245:21:21:108:538:439:144:Times:144:Times:?:Even when patients face large out-of-pocket costs for anticancer drugs, they have several 
9:262:19335:21:20:72:534:418:144:Times:144:Times:B:options for reducing their liabilities. Patients with private insurance can apply for aid from drug 
9:263:19435:20:21:71:534:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:manufacturers’ co-pay assistance programs, which offset patients’ out of-pocket costs, typically 
9:264:19532:21:21:71:531:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:on generous terms. For example, Dendreon’s patient assistance program covers up to $6,000 of 
9:265:19625:21:20:71:540:356:144:Times:144:Times:B:patients’ copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles for its $93,000 prostate therapy sipuleucel-T, 
9:266:19723:20:21:71:503:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:boasting “75 percent of patients receiving Provenge [the trade name for sipuleucel-T] are 
9:267:19813:21:21:71:508:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:expected to have minimal to no out-of-pocket costs.” (Dendreon 2014). The program even 
9:268:19900:21:21:71:529:294:144:Times:144:Times:B:reimburses patients for the costs they incur during travel to oncology clinics. These funds flow 
9:269:19997:21:20:71:520:273:144:Times:144:Times:B:directly from pharmaceutical companies to patients and are not captured in insurers’ records. 
9:270:20091:20:21:71:538:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:Patient assistance programs lower the elasticity of patient demand, enabling manufacturers to set 
9:271:20189:21:21:71:506:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher prices (Howard 2014). The federal government does not allow assistance programs

9:273:20368:20:21:71:505:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:grounds that these programs provide an illegal inducement for patients to receive care, but 
9:274:20460:21:21:72:494:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:manufacturers are allowed to donate funds and steer Medicare and Medicaid patients to 
9:275:20546:21:33:72:539:149:144:Times:144:Times:B:programs operated by independent foundations. Patients can also use death as a backstop against

9:277:20702:8:20:72:542:108:64:Times:144:Times:B:2 Some plans do not count spending on prescription drugs towards the out-of-pocket maximum, a

10:279:20866:0:20:72:492:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:medical debt. Most patients considering whether to use anticancer drugs have short life 
10:280:20954:20:21:72:523:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:expectancies. They may be willing to exhaust their assets to buy small gains in health. Health 
10:281:21049:21:21:71:406:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:care providers must write-off debt in excess of the decedent’s estate.  
10:282:21121:21:20:107:534:646:144:Times:144:Times:?:Not surprisingly, the elasticity of demand with respect to patients’ out-of-pocket costs is 
10:283:21213:20:21:71:520:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:low. Goldman et al. (2006) estimate that spending on cancer drugs declines by 0.1 percent in 
10:284:21306:21:21:71:542:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:response to a 10 percent increase in patient coinsurance. For the sake of comparison, spending on 
10:285:21404:21:20:71:525:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:drugs used to treat arthritis declines by 2.1 percent and spending on drugs used to treat kidney 
10:286:21501:20:21:71:468:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:failure declines by 0.7 percent when patient coinsurance increases by 10 percent.

10:290:21609:20:21:107:540:481:144:Times:144:Times:?:We evaluate pricing trends for 58 anticancer drugs approved in the US between 1995 and 
10:291:21696:21:21:71:537:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:2013 (CenterWatch 2014). We restrict attention to drugs administered with the primary intent of

10:293:21884:20:21:71:525:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimated in trials or modeling studies. We do not consider drugs administered to treat pain or 
10:294:21980:21:21:71:524:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:drugs that are administered to alleviate the side effects of cancer treatments. Details about the

10:297:22239:21:21:108:524:336:144:Times:144:Times:?:The FDA approves drugs for specific uses, or indications, which are described in each 
10:298:22325:21:20:72:540:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:drug’s “product label.” We focus on the benefits associated with each drug’s first FDA-approved 
10:299:22421:20:21:72:542:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:indication. Once a drug is FDA-approved, physicians are free to use the drug for any patient with 
10:300:22519:21:21:72:528:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:any condition, but manufacturers may not promote the drug for “off label” indications. We did 
10:301:22613:21:21:72:516:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:not consider the survival benefits associated with indications approved by the FDA after the 
10:302:22706:21:20:72:513:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:initial approval of the drug. In most cases, the benefits associated with these indications are 
10:303:22802:20:21:72:524:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:unknown to manufacturers at the time of launch and are thus difficult to incorporate into their 
10:304:22898:21:21:72:191:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:initial pricing decisions. 
10:305:22925:21:20:108:508:170:144:Times:144:Times:?:Forty-one of the 58 drugs in our sample were approved on the basis of randomized 
10:306:23006:20:21:72:523:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:controlled trials. We obtained information on the incremental survival benefits of these drugs 
10:307:23101:21:21:72:532:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:from the results of these trials. Drugs are typically tested against the next best therapy available 
10:308:23202:21:0:72:503:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:at the time the trial was initiated. In some cases the next best therapy is “nothing”, and so 
11:309:23300:0:20:72:529:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:patients receive a placebo. We measured benefits by subtracting median overall survival in the 
11:310:23395:20:21:72:502:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:control arm from median overall survival in the treatment arm. We used progression-free 
11:311:23483:21:21:72:501:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:survival (the period of time the cancer is under control) when trials did not report overall 
11:312:23576:21:20:72:513:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:survival.3 Survival benefits equal the gain in median overall survival or, when trials did not 
11:313:23671:20:21:71:530:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:report overall survival or when overall survival was higher in the control arm, progression-free 
11:314:23768:21:21:71:531:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:survival (the period of time where the cancer is under control).4 Drug manufacturers may focus 
11:315:23863:21:20:72:503:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:on progression-free survival for practical reasons. Trials designed to detect differences in 
11:316:23956:20:21:72:531:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:progression-free survival are shorter (progression precedes death) and require a smaller sample 
11:317:24052:21:21:72:519:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:size because the variation in progression-free survival is typically lower than the variation in 
11:318:24149:21:21:72:499:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:overall survival. There is considerable debate in the oncology community about whether 
11:319:24236:21:20:72:486:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:progression-free survival is a good proxy for overall survival. Our view is that even if 
11:320:24325:20:21:72:536:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:progression-free survival benefits are only weakly correlated with overall survival benefits, data 
11:321:24424:21:21:71:540:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:on progression-free survival benefits provide a useful signal of product quality to a manufacturer 
11:322:24523:21:20:71:524:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:who must set a price for a new drug in the absence of information on overall survival benefits 
11:323:24618:20:21:71:519:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:and to practicing physicians who must decide whether to use it. In our data, we observe both 
11:324:24711:21:21:71:515:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:overall survival and progression-free survival for 20 drugs. The average absolute difference 
11:325:24804:21:20:71:533:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:between overall and progression-free survival is less than one month for five of these drugs and 
11:326:24901:20:21:71:279:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:less than two months for 13 of the drugs.    
11:327:24946:21:21:107:502:336:144:Times:144:Times:?:For the 17 drugs that were approved on the basis of single-arm trials, we obtained 
11:328:25029:21:20:71:543:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates of survival benefits from post-approval trials (N = 6) and cost-effectiveness studies that 
11:329:25130:20:21:71:521:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:use simulation models to project survival (N =11). Cost-effectiveness studies typically report 
11:330:25225:21:21:71:515:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:benefits in terms of mean life expectancy or mean quality-adjusted life years. We converted 
11:331:25317:21:40:71:529:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:these quantities to median survival gains assuming survival time is distributed exponentially. 5

11:333:25475:9:19:72:530:204:64:Times:144:Times:B:3 Trials report medians, because measurement of means is possible only after all patients in the 
11:334:25572:19:14:72:516:185:144:Times:144:Times:B:trial are dead. Some trials are not powered to detect changes in overall survival, but report it 
11:335:25669:14:8:71:114:171:144:Times:144:Times:B:anyway. 
11:336:25677:8:20:72:530:163:64:Times:144:Times:B:4 Trials report medians, because measurement of means is possible only after all patients in the 
11:337:25774:20:13:72:516:143:144:Times:144:Times:B:trial are dead. Some trials are not powered to detect changes in overall survival, but report it 
11:338:25871:13:9:71:114:130:144:Times:144:Times:B:anyway. 
11:339:25879:9:19:72:508:121:64:Times:144:Times:B:5 If we assume survival time is distributed exponentially, it is possible to convert means to 
11:340:25973:19:14:72:503:102:144:Times:144:Times:B:medians without estimating ancillary shape parameters. Median survival is equal to mean 
11:341:26061:14:0:72:213:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:survival multiplied by ln(2).  
12:342:26096:0:20:108:517:708:144:Times:144:Times:?:We calculated the “episode treatment price” for each drug, which equals each drug’s 
12:343:26180:20:21:72:533:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:monthly cost to the Medicare program in 2013 dollars (see Bach 2009 for details) multiplied by 
12:344:26275:21:21:72:529:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:the typical duration of treatment in months. Medicare costs represent the actual dollar amounts 
12:345:26371:21:20:72:495:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:Medicare, the largest public insurance program, pays for drugs. In most cases Medicare 
12:346:26458:20:21:72:509:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:reimbursements will be greater than the prices hospitals, physicians and pharmacies pay to 
12:347:26549:21:21:72:490:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:wholesalers. We do not believe that rebates – refunds from manufacturers to hospitals, 
12:348:26636:21:20:72:512:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:physicians, pharmacies and third party insurers – are large in the market for new anticancer 
12:349:26729:20:21:72:538:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:drugs, but pricing is opaque and rebate arrangements are closely guarded. Medicare has adjusted 
12:350:26825:21:21:72:516:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:its payment formulae over time to better align reimbursement and wholesale prices. For this 
12:351:26917:21:21:72:540:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:reason, our price series may understate increases in providers’ acquisition prices. As we describe 
12:352:27016:21:20:72:524:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:below, drug acquisition costs vary between providers and pharmacies, and Medicare payment 
12:353:27106:20:21:72:513:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:rates do not account for differences in acquisition costs across various categories of buyers. 
12:354:27201:21:21:108:523:460:144:Times:144:Times:?:Our approach accounts for differences in the duration of treatment across drugs and is 
12:355:27288:21:20:72:536:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:consistent with the notion of measuring the price of a treatment episode, as advocated by Berndt 
12:356:27385:20:21:72:495:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:et al. (2000) and Busch et al. (2001). However, a drug’s treatment episode price is not a 
12:357:27475:21:21:72:535:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:comprehensive measure of the impact of that drug on health care costs. The impact of a drug on 
12:358:27570:21:20:72:502:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:total costs depends on whether it is a substitute or complement to existing treatments and 
12:359:27661:20:21:72:538:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:whether it increases or decreases the incidence of side effects, some of which can be quite costly

13:377:28915:21:21:72:536:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:explanatory variable yields a small and insignificant coefficient (0.005 years of life gained, with 
13:378:29015:21:20:72:434:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:a 95 percent confidence interval from -0.024 to 0.034 years of life gained).

13:380:29175:21:21:72:487:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:approval year indicates that prices increased by 12 percent per year (with a 95 percent 
13:381:29263:21:21:72:522:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:confidence interval from 7 to 17 percent). The result is robust to the inclusion of a control for 
13:382:29361:21:20:71:160:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:survival benefits.  
13:383:29381:20:21:107:539:481:144:Times:144:Times:?:For the remainder of the paper we focus on trends in the price per life year gained, which 
13:384:29472:21:21:72:527:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:equals the price per treatment episode (in 2013 dollars) divided by survival benefits. The price 
13:385:29569:21:20:72:506:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:per life year gained can be thought of as a “benefit-adjusted” price. The sample average is 
13:386:29661:20:21:72:519:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:$150,100 per year of life gained (with a standard deviation of $130,500). This value is in the 
13:387:29756:21:21:71:526:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:range of estimates of the willingness-to-pay for a quality-adjusted life year (Hirth et al. 2000). 
13:388:29855:21:20:71:535:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:Figure 2 plots drugs’ price per life year gained against drugs’ approval date. There is an upward 
13:389:29953:20:21:71:531:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:trend. A regression of the price per life year gained on approval year indicates that benefit- and 
13:390:30052:21:21:71:537:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:inflation-adjusted launch prices increased by $8,500 (with a 95 percent confidence interval from 
13:391:30149:21:20:71:527:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:$2,900 to $14,100) per year.6 The intercept (1995 is zero on the x-axis) is $54,100 (95 percent 
13:392:30245:20:21:72:533:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:confidence interval: -$16,700 to $124,900). Put another way, in 1995 patients and their insurers 
13:393:30342:21:21:72:540:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:paid $54,100 for a year of life. A decade later, 2005, they paid $139,100 for the same benefit. By 
13:394:30441:21:21:72:200:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:2013, they paid $207,000.

14:407:31198:20:21:72:499:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:drug attributes. Table 1 presents regression estimates (sample means and other summary 
14:408:31285:21:21:72:524:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:statistics for the drug attributes are presented in the appendix, available upon request from the 
14:409:31383:21:20:72:523:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:lead author).  We used the natural logarithm of the price per life year gained as the dependent 
14:410:31479:20:21:72:531:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:variable because the price per life year gained is skewed. Results are qualitatively similar if we 
14:411:31578:21:21:72:531:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:use untransformed prices as the dependent variable. Because of the modest sample size, we did 
14:412:31672:21:21:72:364:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:not attempt to control for all drug attributes simultaneously.  
14:413:31736:21:20:108:530:501:144:Times:144:Times:?:The model in Column A, the baseline specification, indicates that benefit- and inflation-
14:414:31825:20:21:72:541:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:adjusted launch prices increased 10 percent per year over the study period. The model in Column 
14:415:31921:21:21:72:532:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:B adds controls for the gastrointestinal complication and neutropenia rates. The gastrointestinal 
14:416:32019:21:20:72:510:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:complication rate is the average of the nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea rates experienced by 
14:417:32111:20:21:72:514:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:patients on the drug. The neutropenia rate is the proportion of patients who experience high-
14:418:32204:21:21:72:530:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:grade neutropenia, a deficit of white blood cells which puts patients at risk of infection. We set 
14:419:32303:21:20:72:519:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:missing values to “0”. Data on the side effects experienced by patients in the control arms of 
14:420:32398:20:21:72:538:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:trials are inconsistently reported. We controlled for absolute rather than relative side effect rates, 
14:421:32501:21:21:72:539:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:which may be why the coefficient on the gastrointestinal complication rate is “wrong signed.” In 
14:422:32598:21:20:72:475:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:general, side effect rates are similar for newer and older drugs (Niraula et al. 2012). 
14:423:32686:20:21:111:531:295:144:Times:144:Times:?: The model in Column C includes a control for administration route: intravenous versus 
14:424:32772:21:21:72:538:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:oral. Oral drugs are more convenient for patients than physician-administered intravenous drugs, 
14:425:32869:21:21:71:529:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:but patients’ out-of-pocket costs are typically higher for oral drugs. The positive coefficient on 
14:426:32968:21:20:71:329:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:the intravenous administration route is insignificant.  
14:427:33024:20:21:107:537:212:144:Times:144:Times:?:The model in Column D explores the hypothesis that increases in prices reflect increased 
14:428:33113:21:21:71:507:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:production costs. We test this hypothesis indirectly by examining the link between several 
14:429:33204:21:20:71:533:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:proxies for production costs and prices. Biologic drugs are typically more expensive to develop 
14:430:33300:20:21:71:528:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:and produce than traditional anticancer drugs. Multiproduct firms – firms that sell two or more 
14:431:33396:21:21:71:527:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:anticancer drugs – are able to spread the fixed costs associated with marketing oncology drugs 
14:432:33491:21:0:71:536:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:across products and may have equipment that can be used to manufacture two or more products. 
15:433:33588:0:20:72:515:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:The coefficients on the cost-shifters are insignificant. These findings are consistent with the 
15:434:33684:20:21:72:527:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:observation that there is a large gap between the generic and brand launch prices of anticancer 
15:435:33780:21:21:72:536:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:drugs: for example, over 80 percent in the case of irinotecan (Conti et al 2012). The prices of on-
15:436:33879:21:20:72:496:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:patent anticancer drugs do not appear to be closely related to marginal production costs. 
15:437:33969:20:21:108:519:626:144:Times:144:Times:?:The model in Column E examines the relationship between the source of information 
15:438:34051:21:21:72:525:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:about survival benefits and prices. We would expect that physicians would be more willing to 
15:439:34144:21:20:72:528:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:prescribe drugs about which they have more information. This regression includes controls for 
15:440:34238:20:21:72:519:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:whether the drug was approved on the basis of a randomized trial and if survival benefits are 
15:441:34332:21:21:72:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:measured in terms of progression-free rather than overall survival. The coefficients are of the 
15:442:34428:21:21:72:255:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:expected sign but are not significant.  
15:443:34468:21:20:108:537:501:144:Times:144:Times:?:The models in columns F-H consider whether drugs with few close substitutes command 
15:444:34552:20:21:72:520:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher prices. Characterizing the degree of competition between anticancer drugs is difficult. 
15:445:34647:21:21:72:508:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:Some compete, but most are used in a complementary manner, either in a co-administered 
15:446:34734:21:20:72:523:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:multidrug “cocktail” regimen or in a sequence of therapy lines (first-line therapy, second-line 
15:447:34830:20:21:71:534:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:therapy, etc.) Some drugs are approved to treat all patients diagnosed with late-stage cancer in a 
15:448:34929:21:21:71:543:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:specific body part, while other drugs have narrower indications. The model in Column F includes 
15:449:35025:21:20:71:519:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:a control for whether the drug was compared against a placebo (or “best supportive care”) or 
15:450:35118:20:21:71:527:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:against another drug. Drugs tested against placebos occupy unique niches in the product space 
15:451:35212:21:21:71:514:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:compared to drugs tested against “active” controls. Presumably the FDA and ethical review 
15:452:35302:21:20:71:523:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:boards would not allow a manufacturer to test an anticancer drug against a placebo unless the 
15:453:35396:20:21:71:533:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:drug had no direct substitutes. The coefficient is positive and significant at the 10 percent level. 
15:454:35497:21:21:71:541:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:The model in column G includes controls for whether the drug was granted priority review status 
15:455:35593:21:21:72:528:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:by the FDA. Priority review is granted to drugs that demonstrate “significant improvements in 
15:456:35687:21:20:72:532:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions when 
15:457:35785:20:21:72:516:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:compared to standard applications.” The model indicates that drugs awarded priority review 
15:458:35876:21:21:72:535:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:status command significantly higher prices. The model in column H includes a variable equal to 
15:459:35971:21:20:72:524:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:the natural logarithm of the number of drugs previously approved for the tumor site (National 
15:460:36065:20:21:72:532:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:Cancer Institute 2014). The coefficient is negative and significant. It is unclear if this result can 
15:461:36167:21:0:72:500:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:be interpreted as a purely competitive effect because anticancer drugs are often used in a 
16:462:36262:0:20:72:490:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:complementary manner. The FDA grants orphan drug status to drugs used to treat rare 
16:463:36346:20:21:72:450:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:conditions. The coefficient on orphan drug status (Model G) is not significant. 
16:464:36426:21:21:108:515:667:144:Times:144:Times:?:The model in column I includes controls for whether a drug was approved for use in 
16:465:36509:21:20:72:510:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:patients with specific genetic biomarkers (US Food and Drug Administration 2014) or as a 
16:466:36598:20:21:72:509:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:second-line drug, for use in patients whose disease has progressed after an initial course of 
16:467:36692:21:21:72:524:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:treatment. Demand may be less elastic, and prices higher, for drugs targeted at narrow patient 
16:468:36787:21:20:72:518:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:subgroups. The coefficient on the gene test variable is negative, contrary to our expectation.  
16:469:36883:20:21:72:532:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:The discussion up until this point has implicitly assumed that patients’ valuation of gains in life 
16:470:36983:21:21:72:534:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:expectancy from a new anticancer drug is independent of its clinical context. It does not depend 
16:471:37080:21:21:72:533:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:on the type of cancer or how long patients expect to live if they do not receive a new drug. This 
16:472:37178:21:20:72:519:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:approach treats anticancer drugs as bundles of comparable attributes. The model in column J 
16:473:37270:20:21:72:517:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:includes a control for baseline survival (i.e., survival in the control or comparator arm of the 
16:474:37367:21:21:72:507:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:study we used to assess survival benefits). Results indicate that the longer patients survive 
16:475:37461:21:20:72:516:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:without the drug, the lower the drug price. Patients’ and physicians’ willingness-to-pay may 
16:476:37554:20:21:72:536:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:depend on absolute survival as well as relative survival gains. They may place a higher value on 
16:477:37651:21:21:72:518:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:a drug that extends survival time by 6 months from a base of 8 months than one that extends 
16:478:37743:21:20:72:535:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:survival time by 6 months from a base of 12 months. The model in column K includes a control 
16:479:37836:20:21:72:513:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:for the tumor-specific mortality rate, which we calculated by dividing the number of deaths 
16:480:37928:21:21:72:533:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:attributed to the tumor by disease incidence. The coefficient on the mortality rate is positive but 
16:481:38028:21:20:72:162:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:is not significant.7 
16:482:38048:20:21:108:520:295:144:Times:144:Times:?:The coefficient on approval year is economically and statistically significant in all 11 
16:483:38137:21:21:72:514:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:specifications in Table 1. Thus, our basic finding that benefit- and inflation-adjusted launch 
16:484:38232:21:21:71:532:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:prices increased by about 10 percent annually appears robust to the inclusion of controls for the 
16:485:38330:21:20:71:269:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:various drug attributes described above.

17:498:39038:21:20:72:516:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:results to extreme values. In both cases the coefficients on approval date indicate that prices 
17:499:39134:20:21:72:520:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:increased by about 10 percent annually and were significant at the 1 percent level, consistent 
17:500:39229:21:21:72:271:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:with the results from the baseline model.

17:504:39299:21:21:108:509:460:144:Times:144:Times:?:Our empirical results suggest that the launch prices of anticancer drugs, even when 
17:505:39383:21:20:72:538:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:adjusted for inflation and survival benefits, have increased substantially over time. We offer two 
17:506:39482:20:21:72:520:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:explanations grounded in our observations of market behavior, economic theory, and current 
17:507:39573:21:21:72:163:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:regulatory policy.  
17:508:39593:21:20:108:519:377:144:Times:144:Times:?:Our discussion focuses on branded drugs’ launch prices. If manufacturers make large 
17:509:39677:20:21:72:497:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:changes to drugs’ prices in the years following launch, our focus may be misplaced. We 
17:510:39764:21:21:72:533:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:analyzed the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ Average Sales Price files for a subset 
17:511:39859:21:20:72:531:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the drugs in our sample to determine if launch prices are a sufficient statistic for post-launch 
17:512:39959:20:21:72:525:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:prices. The files capture prices for the mostly intravenous drugs reimbursed under Medicare’s 
17:513:40053:21:21:72:507:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:Part B outpatient medical benefit. We excluded three drugs – gemcitabine, irinotecan, and 
17:514:40143:21:21:72:518:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:oxaliplatin – that experienced large declines in price following patent expiration and generic 
17:515:40238:21:20:72:532:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:entry. We calculated annualized growth rates in the remaining sample of 19 drugs. The average 
17:516:40332:20:21:72:502:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:annualized growth rate in real prices after launch was 1 percent. The 25th, 50th, and 75th 
17:517:40423:21:21:72:532:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:percentiles were -0.7 percent, 0.9 percent, and 4 percent. The results are consistent with Lu and 
17:518:40521:21:20:72:531:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:Comanor’s (1998) finding that the prices of innovative drugs do not change much after launch. 
17:519:40615:20:21:72:257:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:Launch prices are where the action is.

18:524:40678:21:21:108:500:667:144:Times:144:Times:?:Writing to criticize the “astronomical” prices of new anticancer drugs, a group of 
18:525:40761:21:20:71:497:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:over 100 prominent oncologists (Experts in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia 2013) proposed 
18:526:40844:20:21:71:483:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:the following model of manufacturers’ price setting behavior: “How are the prices of 
18:527:40929:21:21:71:505:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:cancer drugs decided? Of the many complex factors involved, price often seems to follow 
18:528:41017:21:20:71:496:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:a simple formula: start with the price for the most recent similar drug on the market and 
18:529:41107:20:21:71:495:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:price the new one within 10-20 percent of that price (usually higher).” Industry insiders 
18:530:41197:21:21:71:490:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:echo this theory of price setting behavior. For example, from Hutchison (2010): “Gold 
18:531:41283:21:21:71:495:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:[CEO of Dendreon] says that the cost of Provenge was based on the `overall landscape’ 
18:532:41369:21:20:71:499:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:of treatment prices for cancer.” From Marcus (2004): “A spokeswoman for AstraZeneca 
18:533:41453:20:21:71:503:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:justified the price of Iressa as ʽin line with other cancer treatments.’” From Silber (2005): 
18:534:41547:21:21:71:503:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:“The retail price of the drug will be $5,416 per month, an amount that Onyx said is in the 
18:535:41638:21:20:71:294:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:range of similarly specialized cancer drugs.”   
18:536:41686:20:21:107:535:419:144:Times:144:Times:?:The theory that manufacturers set the prices of new drugs based on the prices of existing 
18:537:41776:21:21:71:527:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:therapies (not necessarily competitors), rather than some intrinsic standard of product value, is 
18:538:41874:21:20:71:520:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:consistent with reference price models of demand. Reference pricing models depart from the 
18:539:41965:20:21:71:530:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:standard economic model of consumer behavior by allowing consumers’ purchase decisions to 
18:540:42055:21:21:71:542:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:depend on a pricing anchor, or reference price, rather than on an internal comparison of price and 
18:541:42154:21:20:71:538:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:willingness-to-pay (Thaler 1985). Consumers may determine reference prices based on observed 
18:542:42247:20:21:71:423:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:past prices or the prices of similar, but not necessarily substitute, goods.  
18:543:42325:21:21:107:521:274:144:Times:144:Times:?: Oncologists are in a strong position to influence the market share of anticancer drugs. 
18:544:42413:21:21:71:505:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:Although oncologists do not face direct incentives to avoid costly drugs, they may balk at 
18:545:42504:21:20:71:524:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:prescribing drugs with prices they perceive as exploitative — in the language of theory, drugs 
18:546:42599:20:21:71:531:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:with prices above the reference price level. An extensive literature in economics and marketing 
18:547:42695:21:21:72:533:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:describes how perceptions of fairness influence consumers’ attitudes towards prices and market 
18:548:42790:21:20:72:538:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:behavior (for example, Frey and Pommerehne 1993; Mas 2006; Maxwell 2002; Kahneman et al. 
18:549:42879:20:21:72:239:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:1986; Piron and Fernandez 1995). 
18:550:42912:21:21:108:522:129:144:Times:144:Times:?:There is a “zone of indifference” around a reference price such that consumers ignore 
18:551:42998:21:0:72:542:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:small deviations from the reference price (Kalyanaram and Little 1994). The zone of indifference 
19:552:43099:0:20:72:540:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:gives manufacturers the ability to set the prices of new drugs slightly above the prices of existing 
19:553:43200:20:21:72:506:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:drugs without reducing quantity demanded. As costlier drugs come to market, oncologists 
19:554:43288:21:21:72:538:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:become habituated to higher prices, giving manufacturers leeway to set even higher prices in the 
19:555:43385:21:20:71:522:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:future. The characteristics of the market for anticancer drugs, including patent protection that 
19:556:43482:20:21:71:542:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:protects producers from direct competition and generous third party payment, allow this dynamic 
19:557:43578:21:21:71:538:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:to persist. These characteristics are present in other medical product markets, but not to the same 
19:558:43678:21:20:71:269:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:degree as in the anticancer drug market.  
19:559:43720:20:21:107:531:564:144:Times:144:Times:?:Over time, the use of reference prices leads to forward-looking price complementarities 
19:560:43808:21:21:71:533:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:between manufacturers. When a new drug enters with a price in excess of the reference price, it 
19:561:43904:21:21:71:529:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:re-establishes price levels, freeing up the next entrant to set its price even higher. Kahneman et 
19:562:44003:21:20:71:507:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:al. (1986) write, “[P]rice increases that are not justified by increasing costs are judged less 
19:563:44099:20:21:71:540:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:objectionable when competitors have led the way.” Shortly after the FDA approved bevazicimab 
19:564:44192:21:21:71:529:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:and erlotinib, one Wall St. analyst noted: “Companies will be looking at these products to help 
19:565:44288:21:20:71:524:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:them determine the pricing of their own drugs...Tarceva and other drugs will likely take their 
19:566:44383:20:21:71:536:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:cue from Erbitux and Avastin” (Griffith 2004). According to textbook monopoly pricing theory, 
19:567:44477:21:21:71:534:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:the price of Erbitux (generic name cetuximab) should have had no direct bearing on the price of 
19:568:44573:21:20:71:537:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:Tarceva (generic name erlotinib), a lung and pancreatic cancer drug, because cetuximab was not 
19:569:44668:20:21:71:194:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:a competitor at the time.  
19:570:44695:21:21:107:532:336:144:Times:144:Times:?:If a manufacturer sets a price that is perceived as exploitative, in the sense that the price 
19:571:44789:21:20:71:514:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:exceeds the reference price to a large degree, it risks provoking a backlash. One example of 
19:572:44882:20:21:71:508:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:where this happened involved a second-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer, ziv-
19:573:44973:21:21:71:535:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:aflibercept (brand name Zaltrap). When approved by the FDA in 2012, its price was double that 
19:574:45067:21:21:71:537:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:of bevacizumab, its closest competitor, at bevacizumab’s common dosing level. Oncologists did 
19:575:45161:21:20:71:500:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:not view ziv-aflibercept as particularly innovative, and three prominent physicians at the 
19:576:45252:20:21:71:534:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:Memorial Sloan Kettering cancer center wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times (Bach et 
19:577:45345:21:21:71:531:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:al. 2012) stating that they would refrain from using ziv-aflibercept at their center because of its 
19:578:45445:21:20:71:520:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:price. One month later the manufacturer, Sanofi, announced that it would provide purchasers 
19:579:45537:20:21:71:289:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:with a 50 percent discount off the list price.   
19:580:45586:21:21:107:492:129:144:Times:144:Times:?:According to one Wall Street analyst, “market structure effectively provides no 
19:581:45666:21:0:71:509:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:mechanism for price control in oncology other than companies’ goodwill and tolerance for 
20:582:45759:0:20:72:489:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:adverse publicity” (Anand 2007). The observation begs the question: What is to stop a 
20:583:45845:20:21:72:526:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:manufacturer from setting the price of a drug at $1,000,000 or more? Drug manufacturers’ are 
20:584:45938:21:21:72:529:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:able to set higher prices for new drugs, but they must be mindful of physicians’ ability to exact 
20:585:46036:21:20:72:462:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:retribution when manufacturers’ violate physicians’ norms of fairness in pricing.

20:590:46215:21:21:72:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:consequence of policies to expand access to price discounts. The so-called 340B drug pricing 
20:591:46308:21:21:72:542:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:program, authorized by Congress in 1992, requires drug manufacturers to provide deep discounts 
20:592:46403:21:20:72:521:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:to 340B-qualified buyers. At the program’s inception, only federally qualified health centers, 
20:593:46498:20:21:72:525:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:specialized public health clinics, and disproportionate share hospitals (hospitals whose patient 
20:594:46595:21:21:72:516:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:population includes a high proportion of low-income patients) qualified for 340B discounts. 
20:595:46687:21:20:72:532:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:Discounts are set relative to the average price wholesalers, retail pharmacies, and providers pay 
20:596:46785:20:21:72:514:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:manufacturers to purchase drugs, called the “Average Manufacturer Price”. The 340B price 
20:597:46874:21:21:72:516:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:discount for branded drugs must be at least 23.1 percent of the Average Manufacturer Price. 
20:598:46966:21:20:72:496:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:Providers that purchase drugs through a government-designated distributor may receive 
20:599:47052:20:21:72:506:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:additional discounts, though these are relatively small, totaling $67 million in 2013 (Drug 
20:600:47144:21:21:72:540:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:Discount Monitor 2014). Participation in the 340B program is attractive for health care providers 
20:601:47242:21:20:72:532:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:because they do not have to pass the discount on to insurers. They profit on the spread between 
20:602:47338:20:21:72:448:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:third party payers’ drug reimbursement rates and the 340B discounted price.8  
20:603:47416:21:21:108:538:274:144:Times:144:Times:?:Since 1992, Congress and federal regulators have broadened eligibility to include critical 
20:604:47507:21:21:72:509:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:access hospitals, free-standing cancer hospitals, some community hospitals, and outpatient 
20:605:47598:21:20:71:519:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:clinics affiliated with disproportionate share hospitals. Mergers between 340B providers and 
20:606:47691:20:21:71:518:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:non-340B providers, a predictable effect of the incentives inherent in the program, have also 
20:607:47785:21:21:71:523:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:expanded the program’s reach. Due to changes in eligibility rules and mergers, the number of 
20:608:47878:21:26:71:518:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:providers in the 340B program increased from 8,605 in 2001 to 16,572 in 2011 (US General

20:610:48027:9:19:72:522:135:64:Times:144:Times:B:8 When calculating average sales prices for purposes of Medicare reimbursement, regulations 
20:611:48119:19:14:72:539:116:144:Times:144:Times:B:instruct manufacturers to exclude sales to 340B providers.  Hence Medicare reimbursement rates 
20:612:48214:14:14:72:540:102:144:Times:144:Times:B:are not affected by growth in the 340B discount program, though providers’ acquisition costs are 
20:613:48311:14:0:72:116:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:reduced. 
21:614:48324:0:20:72:536:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:Accounting Office 2011). Industry sources predict that the volume of drug sales under the 340B 
21:615:48419:20:21:72:522:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:program will increase from $6 billion in 2010 to $12 billion in 2016 (Biotechnology Industry

21:617:48534:21:20:108:514:646:144:Times:144:Times:?:Because the 340B discount is based on a drug’s average price, the program presents 
21:618:48617:20:21:72:529:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:manufacturers with an incentive to set higher launch prices to offset discounts. Increases in the 
21:619:48715:21:21:72:519:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:number of 340B-eliglble providers have magnified the incentive, possibly leading to upward 
21:620:48806:21:20:72:534:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:pressure in the prices paid by non-eligible providers (Conti and Bach 2013). The 340B program 
21:621:48900:20:21:72:503:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:also splits the market into price-elastic and price-inelastic segments. Just as branded drug 
21:622:48993:21:21:72:514:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:manufacturers increase prices following generic entry to capture revenues from brand-loyal 
21:623:49084:21:21:72:536:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:customers (Frank and Salkever 1997), manufacturers of recently launched drugs may cede large 
21:624:49177:21:20:72:480:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:discounts to their price-sensitive segment but increase prices to non-340B providers. 
21:625:49263:20:21:108:513:481:144:Times:144:Times:?:The federal Medicaid program has its own set of drug pricing rules. In exchange for 
21:626:49347:21:21:72:513:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:formulary coverage by state Medicaid programs, branded manufacturers give rebates to the 
21:627:49436:21:20:72:519:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:federal government on sales to Medicaid patients. Similar to the 340B program, the rebate is 
21:628:49529:20:21:72:528:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:based on the Average Manufacturer Price.  If a manufacturer increases the price of a drug over 
21:629:49624:21:21:72:529:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:and above the rate of inflation, it must pay a larger rebate. This aspect of the program provides 
21:630:49722:21:20:72:508:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:incentives for firms to set higher prices initially, rather than increasing prices after launch. 
21:631:49819:20:21:72:543:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:Although Medicaid accounts for less than 10 percent of spending on cancer treatment (Howard et 
21:632:49914:21:21:72:506:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:al. 2004), enrollment in the program is growing, presenting manufacturers with additional 
21:633:50004:21:20:72:335:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:incentives to increase prices to non-Medicaid patients. 
21:634:50060:20:21:108:484:295:144:Times:144:Times:?:The United Kingdom and other European countries negotiate drug prices with 
21:635:50135:21:21:72:541:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:manufacturers. Although negotiated discounts are not legislatively linked to the US price, the US 
21:636:50233:21:21:72:539:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:price may serve as an opening bid in negotiations, and discounts are often expressed as a percent 
21:637:50331:21:20:72:515:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the US list price in contracts. As pressure has mounted on governments to reign in health 
21:638:50424:20:96:72:542:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:spending, European health systems have adopted a more aggressive bargaining stance, backed by

21:640:50578:8:20:72:522:108:64:Times:144:Times:B:9 This figure includes anticancer and non-cancer drugs. Industry sources indicate that the two 
21:641:50673:20:0:72:502:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:therapeutic classes having the largest 340B sales are anticancer drugs and anti-infectives. 
22:642:50769:0:20:72:524:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:a credible threat of non-coverage, potentially leading manufacturers to set higher US prices.10 
22:643:50864:20:21:72:538:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:The United Kingdom and many other countries do not divulge negotiated drug prices, and so we 
22:644:50957:21:21:72:537:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:are unable to determine whether launch prices have increased outside the US. There is anecdotal 
22:645:51053:21:20:72:536:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:evidence that they have. For example, a number of signatories to a statement calling attention to 
22:646:51151:20:21:72:503:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:the “unsustainable” prices of new anticancer drugs were European physicians (Experts in 
22:647:51239:21:21:72:242:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:Chronic Myeloid Leukemia 2013).

22:651:51313:21:21:108:499:522:144:Times:144:Times:?: What about “obvious” explanations for pricing trends, such as shifts in patient or 
22:652:51396:21:20:72:533:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:physician demand? Changes on the demand side of the market seem inconsistent with observed 
22:653:51487:20:21:72:542:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:pricing trends. The income elasticity of the demand for health care is not large enough to account 
22:654:51586:21:21:72:517:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:for changes in prices or health care spending generally (Newhouse 1992). Moreover, patient 
22:655:51677:21:20:72:515:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:cost-sharing is higher now than it was in 1995 as consumers have shifted to high-deductible 
22:656:51769:20:21:72:487:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:plans (Berndt and Newhouse 2012; Kaiser Family Foundation and Health Research & 
22:657:51849:21:21:72:537:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:Educational Trust 2013). The structure of insurers’ payments to physicians has remained largely 
22:658:51945:21:20:72:506:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:unchanged, but payment levels for physician-administered anticancer drugs have declined 
22:659:52033:20:21:72:479:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:following passage of the Medicare Modernization Act (Jacobson et al. 2006; 2010).  
22:660:52116:21:21:108:537:336:144:Times:144:Times:?: On the supply side, it is unlikely that changes in development and production costs alone 
22:661:52206:21:20:72:525:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:can explain launch pricing trends. The FDA has reduced barriers to approval, and advances in 
22:662:52299:20:21:72:539:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:genetics have facilitated drug discovery. The generic versions of anticancer drugs cost much less 
22:663:52397:21:21:72:499:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:than the branded versions, suggesting that production costs are low relative to pre-patent 
22:664:52488:21:21:72:516:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:expiration price levels. Pharmaceutical manufactures often claim that they set drug prices to 
22:665:52582:21:20:72:521:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:recoup research and development costs. Manufacturers’ research and development costs may 
22:666:52671:20:21:72:533:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:have increased over time. As more drugs come to market, the number of unexploited targets for 
22:667:52765:21:21:72:502:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:anticancer therapy shrinks, requiring firms to invest more to develop new drugs. Lacking 
22:668:52854:21:16:72:524:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:measures of research and development costs, we are unable to evaluate the claim empirically.

22:670:53007:9:19:72:496:145:64:Times:144:Times:B:10 The British National Health Service and other national health systems do not disclose 
22:671:53096:19:14:72:500:126:144:Times:144:Times:B:negotiated prices, and so we cannot determine whether the spread between domestic and 
22:672:53182:14:12:72:265:112:144:Times:144:Times:B:international drug prices has increased.

23:674:53229:0:20:72:523:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:However, research and development costs are sunk at the time of product launch, and so they 
23:675:53321:20:21:72:526:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:ought not to factor into the pricing decisions of a profit-maximizing firm once the product has 
23:676:53417:21:21:72:495:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:been developed.  We believe the direction of causation runs from prices to research and 
23:677:53505:21:20:72:521:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:development costs – as prices increases, manufacturers are willing to spend more to discover 
23:678:53598:20:21:72:296:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:new drugs – rather than the other way around.

23:682:53655:21:21:108:517:543:144:Times:144:Times:?:We find that, controlling for inflation and survival benefits, the launch prices of new 
23:683:53743:21:21:72:524:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:anticancer drugs have increased over time. We do not anticipate that US payers and providers 
23:684:53836:21:20:72:529:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:will change their policies in a way that will fundamentally change pricing dynamics, at least in 
23:685:53933:20:21:72:513:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:the near term. The American Society of Clinical Oncology, the main professional group for 
23:686:54023:21:21:72:521:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:physicians who treat cancer patients, is encouraging its members to consider costs when they 
23:687:54116:21:20:72:527:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:choose drugs, but these efforts are mostly focused on costs to patients rather than system-wide 
23:688:54212:20:21:72:492:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:costs. Efforts to increase the sensitivity of physician demand to drug prices still rely on 
23:689:54304:21:21:72:536:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:physicians’ sense of fairness rather than their pocketbooks. A Congressional advisory board, the 
23:690:54401:21:20:72:533:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, recently held a hearing on reforming reimbursement 
23:691:54490:20:21:72:529:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:for physician-administered drugs. Many committee members voiced support for proposals that 
23:692:54581:21:21:72:531:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:would reduce Medicare reimbursement for drugs if there are less costly alternatives that have a 
23:693:54677:21:20:72:527:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:“similar health effect” (InsideHealthPolicy 2014). However, newly-approved anticancer drugs 
23:694:54769:20:21:72:526:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:are, by definition, unique, and will probably be unaffected if Medicare implements the policy. 
23:695:54864:21:21:108:535:274:144:Times:144:Times:?:To supporters of the US health care system, new anticancer drugs are a potent symbol of 
23:696:54952:21:21:72:535:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:progress and represent the type of innovation that would be squelched if Medicare and other US 
23:697:55047:21:20:72:507:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurers denied coverage to costly treatments (for example, Gingrich 2009). To critics, the 
23:698:55139:20:21:72:514:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:pricing of new anticancer drugs represents the worst excesses of a system that provides few 
23:699:55231:21:21:72:525:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:checks on drug companies’ pricing power and prioritizes gains in health, however small, over 
23:700:55324:21:20:72:520:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:cost control. Policymakers are quick to agree that the health system should discourage use of 
23:701:55418:20:21:72:537:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:ineffective treatments, but it is unclear how regulators, insurers, and physicians should approach 
23:702:55517:21:0:72:426:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:treatments that are more costly but also offer small incremental benefits.  
24:703:55597:0:20:108:498:708:144:Times:144:Times:?:The optimistic view of recent trends in cancer drug development is that although 
24:704:55678:20:21:72:518:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:individual drugs many not be associated with large gains in survival, the work that goes into 
24:705:55772:21:21:71:532:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:developing a new drug contributes to the stock of knowledge about cancer biology. Eventually, 
24:706:55866:21:20:72:523:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:scientists will use the information gleaned from the development of existing drugs to develop 
24:707:55960:20:21:72:481:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:new drugs with much greater benefits. The pessimistic view is that current coverage, 
24:708:56045:21:21:72:467:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:reimbursement, and patent policies (Budish, Roin and Williams 2013) divert drug 
24:709:56125:21:20:72:505:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:manufacturers’ attention away from developing drugs that yield truly meaningful survival 
24:710:56214:20:21:72:536:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:benefits. If insurers restricted coverage to drugs that improved survival time by an economically 
24:711:56312:21:21:72:352:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:significant amount, perhaps there would be more of them.
