2:31:1669:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:?:The average price of treating a colorectal cancer patient with chemotherapy increased from about $100
2:32:1770:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:?:in 1993 to $36,000 in 2005, due largely to the approval and widespread use of five new drugs between
2:33:1870:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:?:1996 and 2004. We examine whether the substantial increase in spending has been worth it. Using
2:34:1965:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:?:discrete choice methods to estimate demand, we construct a price index for colorectal cancer drugs
2:35:2063:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:?:for each quarter between 1993 and 2005 that takes into consideration the quality (i.e., the efficacy
2:36:2163:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:?:and side effects in randomized clinical trials) of each drug on the market and the value that oncologists
2:37:2268:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:?:place on drug quality. A naive price index, which makes no adjustments for the changing attributes
2:38:2366:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:?:of drugs on the market, greatly overstates the true price increase. By contrast, a hedonic price index
2:39:2468:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:?:and two quality-adjusted price indices show that prices have actually remained fairly constant over
2:40:2567:14:14:72:512:462:12:Times:12:Times:F:this 13-year period, with slight increases or decreases depending on a model’s assumptions.

3:59:2982:34:22:100:512:661:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:Medical technology, broadly defined as the products and services patients receive
3:60:3063:22:21:100:512:639:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:when treated,  is the engine behind increases in medical spending.   Newhouse
3:61:3140:21:22:100:512:618:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:(1992) concludes that approximately two-thirds of the growth in medical costs in
3:62:3220:22:22:100:512:596:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:the United States between 1950 and 1987 was due to changing medical technolo-
3:63:3297:22:21:100:511:574:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:gies.1There is also evidence that medicalcare in the US has improved substan-
3:64:3374:21:22:100:512:553:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:tially over the past 30 years for certain health conditions such as cardiovascular
3:65:3456:22:22:100:512:531:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:disease. For example, the life expectancy of a 45-year old today is 4.4 years longer
3:66:3540:22:21:100:512:509:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:than it was in 1950 (Cutler (2004)).2Murphy and Topel (2006) estimate that the
3:67:3618:21:22:100:512:488:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:total rise in life expectancy in the US between 1970 and 2000 increased national
3:68:3698:22:22:100:512:466:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:wealth by $3.2 trillion per year, which is approximately equal in value to one-half
3:69:3781:22:21:100:142:444:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:of GDP.
3:70:3788:21:22:116:511:423:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:An important policy issue, therefore, is whether the value of new medical tech-
3:71:3867:22:22:100:512:401:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:nology exceeds its cost. More generally, if new technologies are priced higher than
3:72:3950:22:21:100:511:379:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:the technologies they replace and consumers value the superior health outcomes
3:73:4028:21:22:100:512:358:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:that can now be produced, are medical prices rising or falling once one correctly
3:74:4109:22:22:100:511:336:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:accounts for quality?  If the government and private health insurers believe new
3:75:4189:22:21:100:512:314:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:medical technologies are causing quality-adjusted prices to increase, on average,
3:76:4270:21:22:100:512:293:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:they may make it more difficult for new products to reach the market and/or
3:77:4345:22:18:100:511:271:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:reduce payment for new products, which would dampen the financial incentives
3:78:4421:18:21:84:541:253:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:?:1Newhouse estimates the proportion of the growth in medical spending accounted for by the aging of the
3:79:4523:21:18:70:541:232:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:?:population, improved health insurance based upon the RAND health insurance experiment price elasticity,
3:80:4626:18:18:70:541:214:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:?:and rising income based on the RAND income elasticity. Medical technology is the residual once the factors
3:81:4732:18:18:70:540:196:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:?:above have been accounted for.  Finkelstein (2007) argues that the aggregate, market-wide effects of health
3:82:4839:18:18:70:540:178:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:?:insurance on spending are larger than those derived from individual choices in the RAND experiment.  She
3:83:4943:18:18:70:540:160:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:?:estimates that about one-half of the growth in US hospital spending between 1950 and 1990 was due to the
3:84:5047:18:18:70:540:142:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:?:spread of health insurance, which may indicate that medical technology accounts for less than one-half of the
3:85:5156:18:10:70:190:124:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:?:growth in medical spending
3:86:5182:10:22:84:541:114:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:?:2Cutler (2004) estimates that two-thirds of this increase was due to changing medical technologies, pri-
3:87:5286:22:0:70:539:92:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:?:marily for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. The remaining one-third was due to behavioral changes.
4:88:5393:0:22:100:512:695:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:to innovate.  Conversely, if public and private payers believe technology is help-
4:89:5475:22:22:100:512:673:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:ing drive down quality-adjusted prices, they are likely to maintain or enhance
4:90:5553:22:22:100:214:651:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:incentives to innovate.
4:91:5576:22:21:116:511:629:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:Berndt et al. (2000) highlight several empirical challenges of measuring a medi-
4:92:5656:21:22:100:512:608:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:cal price index. Due to health insurance, most consumers do not face the full price
4:93:5739:22:22:100:512:586:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:of medical care and will seek to consume beyond the point where the marginal
4:94:5815:22:21:100:512:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:value is equal to the full price.  Patients also rely on physicians to provide in-
4:95:5897:21:22:100:512:543:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:formation regarding the value of medical goods and services.  The implication is
4:96:5977:22:21:100:512:521:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:that consumer purchases in the medical market will not necessarily reveal their
4:97:6056:21:22:100:512:500:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:marginal valuation of a good or service. Perhaps the greatest empirical challenge
4:98:6137:22:22:100:512:478:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:for constructing meaningful price indexes in health care is how to account for the
4:99:6219:22:22:100:358:456:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:changing quality of medical products and services.
4:100:6269:22:21:116:511:434:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:Due to these considerable empirical challenges, there have been few studies
4:101:6344:21:22:100:512:413:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:of whether medical prices are rising or falling once one takes into consideration
4:102:6425:22:22:100:512:391:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:the attributes of the new products and consumers’ valuations of those attributes.
4:103:6506:22:21:100:512:369:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:Cutler et al. (1998) show that the life expectancy of heart attack patients increased
4:104:6591:21:22:100:512:348:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:by  eight  months  between  1984 and 1991.   The value of  per-patient  expected
4:105:6671:22:22:100:512:326:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:longevity  ($11,100) increased three times more than treatment  costs ($3,600)
4:106:6749:22:21:100:511:304:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:during this time period in real terms, which implies that the quality-adjusted
4:107:6827:21:22:100:512:283:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:price index fell by about one percent annually. Berndt et al. (2002) conclude that
4:108:6909:22:22:100:512:261:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:the real cost of treating major depression decreased by about two percent per
4:109:6986:22:21:100:512:239:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:year between 1991 and 1996 once one takes into account the probability that a
4:110:7063:21:22:100:305:218:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:patient’s depression goes into remission.
4:111:7104:22:22:116:511:196:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:The pharmaceutical industry is the source of considerable innovation in medi-
4:112:7181:22:21:100:512:174:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:cal care. The pharmaceutical industry invests over $40 billion per year in research
4:113:7264:21:22:100:512:153:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:and development, which represents about 16 percent of the industry’s revenue.
4:114:7341:22:22:100:512:131:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:Most new pharmaceuticals are priced higher than the treatment methods they
4:115:7415:22:21:100:512:109:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:replace, and this has certainly been the case with colorectal cancer drugs.  The
4:116:7495:21:0:100:512:88:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:average price of providing a colorectal cancer patient with a 24-week chemother-
5:117:7576:0:22:100:512:695:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:apy drug regimen increased from $127 in 1993 to $36,300 in 2005. There has been
5:118:7655:22:22:100:512:673:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:substantial innovation in the treatment of colorectal cancer patients over the last
5:119:7738:22:22:100:511:651:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:decade.3Five new drugs were approved by the Food and Drug Administration
5:120:7810:22:21:100:512:629:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:(FDA) for the treatment of colorectal cancer between 1996 and 2004, and these
5:121:7887:21:22:100:509:608:143:g_d0_f3:64:g_d0_f4:B:drugs collectively had an 86 percent market share by the third quarter of 2005.4
5:122:7967:22:22:116:512:586:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:We examine whether the substantial increase in spending associated with phar-
5:123:8044:22:21:100:512:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:maceutical innovation in the treatment of colorectal cancer has been worth it.
5:124:8122:21:22:100:512:543:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:Specifically, we estimate a price index for colorectal cancer drugs for each quarter
5:125:8206:22:21:100:512:521:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:between 1993 and the first half of 2005 that takes into consideration the quality
5:126:8287:21:22:100:512:500:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:(i.e., the efficacy and side effects as reported in clinical trials) of each drug on the
5:127:8375:22:22:100:413:478:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:market and the value that oncologists attach to drug quality.
5:128:8436:22:22:116:511:456:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:We estimate a quality-adjusted price index using methods developed by Berry
5:129:8511:22:21:100:512:434:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:(1994), Berry et al. (1995), Berry and Pakes (2007) and Nevo (2003). These tech-
5:130:8591:21:22:100:512:413:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:niques have been used to estimate the welfare effects of new automobiles (Petrin

5:132:8751:22:21:100:512:369:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:(Nevo (2003))), but few contributions apply them to medical markets.  Trajten-
5:133:8829:21:22:100:512:348:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:berg (1990) focused on the value of innovation on medical devices, specifically
5:134:8908:22:22:100:512:326:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:CT scanners, and provided various price indices.  Cleanthous (2004) and Conti
5:135:8985:22:21:100:512:304:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:(2006) study the value of innovation for anti-depressants,  however,  neither of
5:136:9065:21:22:100:255:283:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:them constructs a price index.
5:137:9095:22:22:116:512:261:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:The first step in constructing the price index is to estimate oncologists’ demand
5:138:9176:22:21:100:512:239:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:for colon cancer regimens,  which  we argue is a function of the observed  and
5:139:9254:21:22:100:512:218:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:unobserved quality of each regimen, as well as the price a physician must pay
5:140:9331:22:22:100:512:196:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:to acquire the regimen.  An observation in this estimation is the market share
5:141:9409:22:21:100:512:174:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:of each regimen for each quarter.  The second step is to calculate the equivalent
5:142:9490:21:19:100:512:153:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:variation (EV) between each adjacent pair of quarters.  The EV between period
5:143:9567:19:21:84:541:134:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:?:313.2 percent of drugs entering Phase 1 trials between 1998 and 2004 were targeting cancer according to
5:144:9670:21:10:70:205:113:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:?:the PharmaProjects data base.
5:145:9699:10:0:84:254:103:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:?:4Market share data are from IntrinsiQ.
6:146:9738:0:22:100:512:695:143:g_d0_f7:143:g_d0_f3:B:t−1 and t is the change in spending required to achieve physicians’ utility in
6:147:9816:22:22:100:512:673:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:periodtrelative tot−1, taking into consideration that both the quality of the
6:148:9893:22:22:100:512:651:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:drug regimens on the market and the prices of those regimens may have changed
6:149:9970:22:21:100:512:629:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:between these two periods.  Positive values imply that the value of the drugs is
6:150:10050:21:22:100:512:608:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:increasing over time by more than their prices, whereas negative values imply the
6:151:10131:22:22:100:512:586:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:opposite. The third step is to translate the EV into a quality-adjusted price index
6:152:10214:22:21:100:512:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:by calculating the change in drug prices that is consistent with the welfare effect
6:153:10297:21:22:100:205:543:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:captured by the EV.
6:154:10316:22:21:116:511:521:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:We generate four additional indices for purposes of comparison.   First, we
6:155:10391:21:22:100:512:500:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:estimate a “naive” price index that merely reports the mean price of colon can-
6:156:10470:22:22:100:512:478:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:cer regimens in each quarter, relative to the first quarter of 1993, without any
6:157:10550:22:22:100:512:456:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:adjustments for regimen attributes.  The naive index will be based on the price
6:158:10629:22:21:100:511:434:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:physicians pay to acquire each regimen and the market share of each regimen.
6:159:10705:21:22:100:512:413:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:Comparing the quality-adjusted price index to the naive index illustrates the
6:160:10782:22:22:100:512:391:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:importance of accounting for the changing quality of pharmaceutical products.
6:161:10859:22:21:100:512:369:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:Second,  we report the incremental spending per incremental expected quality
6:162:10935:21:22:100:512:348:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:adjusted life years (QALYs), where the reference regimen is the oldest one on
6:163:11012:22:22:100:512:326:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:the market.  This index does not depend on how much value oncologists place
6:164:11087:22:21:100:512:304:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:on various drug attributes, and can be compared to estimates in the literature
6:165:11165:21:22:100:512:283:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:on the value of a statistical life.  Third, we estimate a hedonic price index by
6:166:11245:22:22:100:511:261:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:regressing prices on product characteristics and quarter indicator variables. This
6:167:11327:22:21:100:512:239:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:regression, which controls for changing product attributes by means of a reduced
6:168:11407:21:22:100:512:218:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:form projection of markups on the characteristic space, is the traditional method
6:169:11488:22:22:100:512:196:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:traditionally used to account for changing attributes and the introduction of new
6:170:11569:22:21:100:512:174:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:goods.  Finally, to assess the implication of the logit assumption, we estimate a
6:171:11650:21:22:100:348:153:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:vertical model in the spirit of Bresnahan (1987).
6:172:11699:22:22:116:511:131:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:The naive price index,  which increased by 2600 percent between 1993 and
6:173:11771:22:21:100:512:109:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:2005, greatly overestimates the price increase.  The hedonic price index and the
6:174:11851:21:0:100:511:88:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:quality-adjusted price indices show thatprices have actually decreased slightly
7:175:11931:0:22:100:512:695:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:over the 13-year period we study. The hedonic and quality-adjusted price indices
7:176:12011:22:22:100:512:673:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:are similar during the period without innovation, and both exhibit a decrease
7:177:12088:22:22:100:512:651:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:when the first branded product is introduced in the market.  For the following
7:178:12166:22:21:100:512:629:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:period of innovation the two indices show opposite trends, with the hedonic price
7:179:12247:21:22:100:512:608:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:increasing and the quality-adjusted index decreasing.  This discrepancy may be
7:180:12325:22:22:100:512:586:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:due to the logit functional form assumption, which increases the dimensionality of
7:181:12407:22:21:100:512:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:the problem, and makes all innovation welfare enhancing.In contrast, the vertical
7:182:12488:21:22:100:512:543:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:model shows an increase in the prices due to innovation of about 28% over the
7:183:12565:22:21:100:512:521:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:13-year period.  This model is an extreme case, where there are no unobserved
7:184:12642:21:22:100:512:500:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:shocks to preferences, and the physicians are heterogeneous due to permanent
7:185:12718:22:22:100:512:478:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:components.  The levels of the quality-adjusted logit, vertical and hedonic price
7:186:12799:22:22:100:512:456:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:indices demonstrate that the pricing strategies of pharmaceutical firms allow them
7:187:12881:22:21:100:512:434:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:to appropriate most of the extra welfare they generate from improved product
7:188:12957:21:22:100:512:413:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:attributes.  For all the models the indices remain fairly constant over the period
7:189:13039:22:22:100:512:391:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:studied.  All of the new drugs in our sample period are still under patent pro-
7:190:13118:22:21:100:512:369:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:tection.  Presumably consumers would capture more of the surplus once generic
7:191:13195:21:51:100:221:348:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:drugs enter the market.
7:192:13218:51:34:100:390:297:296:g_d0_f2:296:g_d0_f2:C:2  Overview of Colorectal Cancer
7:193:13250:34:21:100:512:263:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:Colorectal cancer is a good health condition for studying the welfare effects of
7:194:13330:21:22:100:512:242:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:medical innovation because it is a common health condition, the majority of pa-
7:195:13409:22:22:100:512:220:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:tients today are treated with drugs that did not exist a decade ago, and treatment
7:196:13491:22:21:100:511:198:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:costs are rising rapidly.  According to the National Cancer Institute, approxi-
7:197:13570:21:22:100:512:177:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:mately 112,000 patients will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer in the United
7:198:13648:22:22:100:512:155:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:States in 2007, and 52,000 will die from the disease. This places colorectal cancer
7:199:13731:22:21:100:512:133:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:as the fourth most common cancer based on number of new patients, after breast,
7:200:13810:21:22:100:512:112:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:prostate, and lung. It is estimated that people born today will have a 5.4 percent
7:201:13892:22:0:100:511:90:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:chance of being diagnosed with colorectalcancer over their lifetime. The disease
8:202:13973:0:22:100:512:695:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:is treatable, however; between 1996 and 2003, colorectal cancer patients had a 64
8:203:14054:22:22:100:511:673:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:percent chance of surviving for five years.  The probability a patient will survive
8:204:14137:22:22:100:512:651:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:for five years ranges from 93 percent for those diagnosed with Stage I cancer to
8:205:14217:22:21:100:432:629:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:eight percent for those diagnosed with Stage IV cancer (NCCN).
8:206:14279:21:22:116:512:608:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:Colorectal cancer patients usually begin treatment by having the tumor sur-
8:207:14354:22:22:100:512:586:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:gically removed.  Most stage 3 and about half of stage 4 patients then receive
8:208:14432:22:21:100:512:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:chemotherapy treatment.  For male Medicare patients diagnosed with colorectal
8:209:14509:21:22:100:512:543:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:cancer between 1998 and 2002, total treatment costs in the first year following
8:210:14588:22:21:100:512:521:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:diagnosis averaged $29,600 (Yabroff et al. (2008)).  About 70 percent of these
8:211:14666:21:22:100:512:500:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:costs were due to hospital care, primarily from the initial surgery.  In this paper
8:212:14749:22:22:100:512:478:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:we present an index for chemotherapy drug prices only, not for the total cost
8:213:14826:22:22:100:511:456:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:of treating the disease.  We focus on chemotherapy costs because this is where
8:214:14904:22:21:100:512:434:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:the innovation has occurred since 1996, and is the likely driver of the increase in
8:215:14987:21:22:100:512:413:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:treatment costs and improvements in health outcomes.5Although chemotherapy
8:216:15061:22:22:100:512:391:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:costs accounted for about 25 percent of total treatment costs for Medicare col-

8:221:15383:21:22:100:512:283:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:ment. For most health conditions, if a physician writes a prescription for a drug,
8:222:15465:22:22:100:512:261:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:the patient takes the prescription to a pharmacy, the patient pays a co-payment or
8:223:15547:22:21:100:512:239:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:co-insurance rate, and the patient’s health insurance company pays the balance of
8:224:15628:21:22:100:512:218:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:the price. By observing the price (co-payment) patients face and their decisions,
8:225:15709:22:22:100:512:196:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:one could estimate patients’ demand for prescription drugs only for a portion of
8:226:15789:22:17:100:512:174:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:the demand curve, which would make it impossible to estimate consumers’ total
8:227:15866:17:22:84:541:157:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:?:5Total treatment costs for a Medicare colorectal cancer patient only increased by about $2,000 in real
8:228:15968:22:18:70:541:135:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:?:terms between 1991 and 2001 during a period where mostpatients were receiving generic chemotherapy
8:229:16066:18:10:70:97:117:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:?:drugs.
8:230:16072:10:22:84:541:107:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:?:6The 25 percent figure was reported by Joan Warren in a presentation at the International Health Eco-

9:236:16475:21:22:100:512:608:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:pitals on behalf of their physicians) purchase oncology drugs from wholesalers or
9:237:16556:22:22:100:512:586:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:distributors (who have previously purchased the drugs from the manufacturers),
9:238:16634:22:21:100:512:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:store the drugs, and administer them as needed to their patients. Physicians then
9:239:16715:21:22:100:511:543:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:bill the patient’s insurance company for an administration fee and the cost of the
9:240:16797:22:21:100:512:521:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:drug. Although physicians are eventually reimbursed by health insurers, they do
9:241:16876:21:22:100:512:500:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:take temporary ownership of oncology drugs.  As such, physicians face the pos-
9:242:16954:22:22:100:511:478:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:sible risk of not being reimbursed by health insurers and may incur substantial
9:243:17033:22:22:100:512:456:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:carrying costs.  For example, a physician who pays $50,000 for the drugs in a
9:244:17110:22:21:100:512:434:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:patient’s regimen and experiences a three-month delay between when he acquires
9:245:17188:21:22:100:512:413:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:the drugs and when he is reimbursed by a health insurer would incur an inventory
9:246:17268:22:22:100:512:391:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:carrying cost of $1,333 at an interest rate of eight percent.  Because we observe
9:247:17349:22:21:100:512:369:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:the full price that physicians pay for colorectal cancer drugs, we can estimate
9:248:17428:21:22:100:512:348:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:physicians’ demand for those drugs. If physicians act as agents for their patients,
9:249:17511:22:22:100:433:326:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:we indirectly observe patients’ willingness to pay for these drugs.
9:250:17578:22:21:116:511:304:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:Almost all colorectal cancer patients who are treated with pharmaceuticals
9:251:17652:21:22:100:512:283:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:receive multiple drugs in the form of a regimen rather than a single drug, simi-
9:252:17732:22:22:100:512:261:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:lar to anti-retroviral “cocktail” treatments for AIDS patients.  For example, the
9:253:17813:22:21:100:512:239:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:regimen with the greatest market share in 2005 contained four separate drugs:
9:254:17890:21:22:100:512:218:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, fluorororicil, and leucovorin.  The 12 regimens in our
9:255:17970:22:22:100:512:196:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:sample are reported in Table 1.  Most of our analysis, therefore, is conducted at
9:256:18051:22:17:100:313:174:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:the level of a regimen rather than a drug.
9:257:18093:17:22:84:541:157:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:?:7Based on data from IMS Health,  59% of colorectal cancer drugs in the third quarter of 2005 were
9:258:18190:22:18:70:541:135:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:?:purchased by physician offices/clinics and 28% by hospitals. The remainder was purchased by retail and mail
9:259:18297:18:0:70:427:117:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:?:order pharmacies, health maintenance organizations, and long-term care facilities.

10:261:18400:34:22:100:512:661:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:To account for changes in quality of new goods we use a hedonic price regression
10:262:18480:22:21:100:512:639:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:and the construction of two quality-adjusted price indices. The quality-adjusted
10:263:18560:21:22:100:512:618:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:price indices are constructed from the estimated benefits of innovation that were
10:264:18641:22:22:100:512:596:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:derived from the estimation of a discrete choice model of demand for colon cancer
10:265:18722:22:21:100:512:574:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:drugs under two extreme assumptions. The technical details of each approach are
10:266:18801:21:44:100:227:553:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:described in this section.
10:267:18827:44:29:100:318:509:206:g_d0_f2:206:g_d0_f2:C:3.1  Hedonic Price Regression
10:268:18856:29:22:100:512:480:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:Hedonic price regressions were introduced by Court (1939) and formalized by
10:269:18931:22:22:100:512:458:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:Griliches (1961) as a way to account for the new goods problem.  In essence,
10:270:19007:22:21:100:511:436:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:newer goods usually contain more desirablecharacteristics, and therefore, failing
10:271:19088:21:22:100:512:415:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:to account for the value of these characteristics will overestate the true change
10:272:19169:22:22:100:512:393:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:in prices.  The hedonic price regression is motivated by the “hedonic hypothe-
10:273:19247:22:21:100:512:371:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:sis,” which states that goods can be viewed as aggregations or bundles of lower
10:274:19326:21:22:100:512:350:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:order variables that the literature calls characteristics or attributes. These char-
10:275:19410:22:22:100:512:328:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:acteristics are the variables that consumers care about and that are present in
10:276:19489:22:21:100:512:306:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:their utility functions.  The hedonic function provides a dissaggregation of the
10:277:19569:21:22:100:512:285:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:observed transaction prices into the variables that affect the economic agents’
10:278:19648:22:22:100:512:263:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:behavior.  Court and Griliches proposed estimating a surface that relates prices
10:279:19728:22:21:100:512:241:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:to product characteristics and time, and then use the results to obtain estimates
10:280:19809:21:22:100:391:220:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:of the price changes keeping the characteristics constant.
10:281:19867:22:36:116:477:198:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:For our application, we estimate the following hedonic price regression

11:291:20374:22:22:100:512:651:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:and an indicator of whether the regiment contains a tablet or not.  The time
11:292:20450:22:21:100:481:629:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:dummies denote quarters and the base quarter is the first quarter of 1993.
11:293:20524:21:26:116:511:608:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:The change in prices is obtained from the parameters of the time dummies as

11:297:20628:33:22:100:171:541:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:and therefore,

11:300:20737:22:22:100:512:469:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:however, the theoretical foundations of the hedonic surface are not clear.  Pakes
11:301:20818:22:21:100:512:447:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:(2005) argues that in oligopolistic markets, price is a combination of marginal
11:302:20897:21:22:100:511:426:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:costs and markups, and therefore the hedonic price regression constitutes a re-
11:303:20976:22:22:100:511:404:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:duced form or projection of these markupson the characteristic space. In the in-
11:304:21056:22:21:100:512:382:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:dustry we study, given the high costs of R&D relative to marginal cost, markups
11:305:21135:21:22:100:511:361:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:should be large and Pakes’s insights are applicable. The parametersβdo not nec-

11:307:21295:22:21:100:512:317:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:may have the “wrong” sign. For example, if there is more entry of products into
11:308:21374:21:22:100:512:296:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:a particular region of the attribute space that has more desirable characteristics
11:309:21456:22:22:100:512:274:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:for the average consumer (e.g., survival), this will reduce the markups of these
11:310:21536:22:21:100:511:252:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:products, and allow the product with less desirable characteristics for the average
11:311:21619:21:22:100:512:231:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:consumer (e.g., worse side effects) to exploit monopoly power among the con-
11:312:21695:22:22:100:512:209:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:sumers who do not experience the strong side effects. The results of the hedonic

11:315:21875:30:21:100:512:114:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:We compute a second set of price indices that explicitly calculate the changes in

12:318:22116:22:22:100:512:673:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:(1990), who introduced the idea, proposed a two-stage method to construct a
12:319:22191:22:22:100:512:651:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:quality-adjusted price index.  In the first stage, the welfare gains from product
12:320:22272:22:21:100:512:629:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:innovation are obtained, and in the second stage the price index is built upon
12:321:22350:21:22:100:200:608:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:those welfare gains.

13:356:24206:15:22:116:511:551:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:We define the mean utility levelδjt=−αpjt+βxjt+ξj+Δξj, and therefore,
13:357:24275:22:22:100:511:529:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:the market shares can be written as the functionσjt(δt), withδtbeing the vector

13:364:24652:28:22:116:511:349:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:Because the unobserved drug regimen characteristics are likely to be correlated
13:365:24731:22:21:100:511:327:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:with price, the estimation of the equation above requires the use of instrumental
13:366:24812:21:22:100:512:306:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:variables. We obtain our instruments by using the supply side market equilibrium
13:367:24892:22:22:100:512:284:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:conditions. Because price is a function of marginal cost and markups, any exoge-
13:368:24972:22:21:100:512:262:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:nous variable that shifts marginal costs or markups should be a valid instrument.
13:369:25053:21:22:100:512:241:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:We follow Bresnahan et al. (1997) and use the number of products in the market
13:370:25131:22:22:100:512:219:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:and the sum of observed characteristics of the competitors (which the literature
13:371:25211:22:21:100:512:197:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:assumes as exogenous and provides a sense of how crowded is the product space)
13:372:25289:21:22:100:512:176:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:as our instruments. Both sets of instruments will shift markups through changes
13:373:25368:22:22:100:512:154:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:in the competitive environment, and therefore, will be correlated with price, but

13:375:25498:21:22:116:511:111:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:One concern with this model is that if physicians earn profits on chemotherapy
13:376:25576:22:0:100:512:89:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:drugs, profits are correlated with the observed price and/or the attributes, and
14:377:25658:0:22:100:511:695:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:profits influence physicians prescribing decisions, then theαandβcoefficients
14:378:25735:22:22:100:512:673:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:may be biased.  In a 2001 study, the federal government concluded that oncolo-
14:379:25813:22:22:100:512:651:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:gists could earn profits on most chemotherapy drugs by acquiring them for less
14:380:25891:22:21:100:512:629:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:than the Medicare reimbursement amount (GAO (2001)). This occurred because
14:381:25965:21:22:100:512:608:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:Medicare reimbursed oncologists 95 percent of a drugs listed average wholesale
14:382:26043:22:22:100:512:586:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:price (AWP), whereas physicians could usually acquire drugs from wholesalers for
14:383:26123:22:21:100:512:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:less than the AWP. For example, physicians were acquiring irinotecan in 2001 for
14:384:26203:21:22:100:512:543:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:23 percent less than AWP, on average, which allowed them to earn an approxi-
14:385:26279:22:21:100:512:521:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:mate 18 percent profit (GAO (2001)).9. Most of these profits were eliminated in
14:386:26358:21:22:100:512:500:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:2005 when Medicare started reimbursing oncologists based on the actual average
14:387:26436:22:22:100:512:478:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:selling price (ASP) of a drug rather than the list price (MedPAC (2006)). In the
14:388:26516:22:22:100:512:456:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:first quarter of 2005, for example, oncologists were acquiring three branded col-
14:389:26597:22:21:100:512:434:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:orectal cancer drugs (bevacizumab, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) for two or three
14:390:26677:21:22:100:512:413:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:percent less than the new Medicare reimbursement amount, on average.  Jacob-
14:391:26753:22:22:100:512:391:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:son et al. (2006) exploit exogenous variation between oncologists in the generosity
14:392:26836:22:21:100:512:369:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:of Medicare reimbursement for chemotherapy drugs to estimate the influence of
14:393:26913:21:22:100:512:348:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:physician profits on treatment decisions. Although they find that oncologists who
14:394:26994:22:22:100:512:326:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:were reimbursed relatively generously did prescribe more expensive chemotherapy
14:395:27073:22:21:100:512:304:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:drugs, the magnitude of the effect is small: a one-standard deviation increase in
14:396:27154:21:22:100:512:283:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:reimbursement generosity is associated with an increase of about five percent in
14:397:27234:22:22:100:436:261:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:the cost of chemotherapy prescribed to colorectal cancer patients.
14:398:27300:22:21:116:511:239:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:We estimate our models with and without the data from 2005 to see if the

14:402:27607:21:22:100:512:153:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:valuations of drug attributes.  The price index is built based on the changes in

17:520:31520:34:21:100:511:191:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:We use a number of different data sourcesto collect four types of information:
17:521:31598:21:22:100:512:170:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:drug prices, regimen market shares, typical drug dosage amounts for each regimen,
17:522:31679:22:22:100:512:148:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:and regimen attributes.  IMS Health collects information on the sales in dollars
17:523:31759:22:22:100:512:126:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:and the quantity of drugs purchased by 10 different types of customers (e.g.,
17:524:31836:22:21:100:512:104:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:hospitals, physician offices, retail pharmacies) from wholesalers in each quarter
17:525:31917:21:0:100:512:83:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:from 1993 through the third quarter of 2005. Prices and quantities are reported
18:526:31998:0:22:100:512:695:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:separately by National Drug Classification (NDC) code, which are unique for each

18:528:32157:22:22:100:512:651:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:per milligram of active ingredient of a drug by averaging across the different NDC
18:529:32239:22:21:100:512:629:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:codes for that drug.  IMS Health reports the invoice price a customer actually
18:530:32317:21:22:100:512:608:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:pays to a wholesaler, not the average wholesale price (AWP), which often differs
18:531:32397:22:22:100:512:586:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:substantially from the true transaction price.  We use nominal rather than real
18:532:32476:22:21:100:512:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:prices because any deflator would itself be a price index, and we do not want to
18:533:32556:21:22:100:512:543:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:build one index on top of another.  The price we calculate does not include any
18:534:32635:22:21:100:512:521:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:discounts or rebates a customer may receive from a manufacturer after purchasing
18:535:32715:21:22:100:512:500:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:the product from the wholesaler. Based on interviews with a few oncologists, we
18:536:32794:22:22:100:511:478:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:do not believe that manufacturers offered substantial rebates during this period.
18:537:32875:22:22:100:512:456:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:Although we have information on 10 different types of customers, we focus on the
18:538:32955:22:21:100:512:434:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:prices paid by the two largest customers - hospitals and physician offices. Because
18:539:33038:21:22:100:512:413:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:most oncology drugs are infused in a physician’s office or hospital clinic, nursing
18:540:33121:22:22:100:378:391:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:homes and retail pharmacies purchase relatively little.
18:541:33176:22:21:116:511:369:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:Most colon cancer patients are treated with regimens that combine two or
18:542:33248:21:22:100:512:348:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:more drugs. The IMS Health data contain information on market share by drug,
18:543:33324:22:22:100:511:326:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:but not market share for the combinations of drugs (regimens) actually used on
18:544:33402:22:21:100:512:304:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:patients. We rely, therefore, on two different sources for regimen-specific market

18:552:33967:16:21:80:540:137:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:?:11Because we observe the market shares of regimens among patients with colorectal cancer, we do not need
18:553:34071:21:18:70:540:116:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:?:to worry about off-label use.  Off-label use occurs when a physician treats a colorectal cancer patient with

19:577:35908:21:18:70:541:218:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:?:approved for colorectal cancer on a patient with a different type of cancer.  In October 2005, seventy-six
19:578:36014:18:18:70:541:200:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:?:percent of patients being treated with the four drugs approved solely for the treatment of colorectal cancer
19:579:36122:18:18:70:541:182:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:?:(irinotecan, oxaliplatin, cetuximab, and bevacizumab) actually had colorectal cancer.  That is, off-label use
19:580:36231:18:10:70:385:164:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:?:accounted for approximately 24 percent of the quantities of these drugs.

20:592:37098:21:22:100:512:543:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:that produces the same chemical response as 5-FU/LV, was approved for treat-
20:593:37174:22:21:100:512:521:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:ment of colorectal cancer in April of 2001 and was administered as a standalone
20:594:37253:21:22:100:512:500:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:therapy or combined with irinotecan. All other drugs for treating colorectal can-

20:597:37425:22:21:116:511:434:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:Oxaliplatin (Eloxatin) was introduced in August of 2002, followed by cetux-

20:601:37724:21:22:100:461:348:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:market share of 5-FU/LV, whose share had fallen to about 14 percent.
20:602:37792:22:22:116:511:326:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:The market shares of several regimens change sharply in the first quarter of
20:603:37868:22:21:100:512:304:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:2002 when we use market share data from IntrinsiQ rather than SEER. One
20:604:37939:21:22:100:512:283:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:explanation  for these  changes is that Medicare patients  may be treated  with
20:605:38018:22:22:100:512:261:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:different regimens than non-Medicare patients.  Another possible explanation is
20:606:38097:22:21:100:512:239:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:that the samples used  by IntrinsiQ  and/or SEER  may not be consistent.17In
20:607:38173:21:22:100:512:218:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:order to smooth market shares between the pre- and post-2002 periods, we apply
20:608:38251:22:22:100:512:196:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:a regimen-specific factor to adjust the pre-2002 market shares based on the ratio
20:609:38332:22:21:100:512:174:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:of total (from IntrinsiQ) to Medicare-only (from SEER) market shares for the
20:610:38408:21:18:100:377:153:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:four quarters of 2002, when the two data sets overlap.
20:611:38462:18:14:80:249:135:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:?:155-FU contains the drug fluorororacil.
20:612:38501:14:21:80:540:121:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:?:16Because it takes Medicare a while to code new drugs into their proper NDC code, for several quarters a
20:613:38605:21:11:70:259:100:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:?:new drug will appear in the outside option.
20:614:38648:11:0:80:482:89:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:?:17The SEER sample is drawn from locations representing 26 percent of the U.S. population.
21:615:38739:0:22:116:511:695:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:In order to calculate the price per regimen,  we require information on the
21:616:38814:22:22:100:512:673:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:quantity of each drug in a regimen. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network
21:617:38891:22:22:100:512:651:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:(NCCN) reports the typical amount of active ingredient used by physicians for the
21:618:38972:22:21:100:512:629:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:major regimens.  We supplement this where necessary with dosage information
21:619:39047:21:22:100:512:608:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:from drug package inserts,  conference abstracts,  and journal articles.   Dosage
21:620:39128:22:22:100:512:586:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:information is reported in Appendix 1. For example, the standard dosage schedule
21:621:39208:22:21:100:512:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:for the regimen with the second largest market share in 2005 is 85 milligrams (mg)
21:622:39290:21:22:100:512:543:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:of oxaliplatin per meter squared of a patient’s surface area infused by IV on the
21:623:39371:22:21:100:512:521:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:first day of treatment, followed by a 1,000 mg infusion of 5-FU per meter squared
21:624:39452:21:22:100:512:500:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:of surface area on the first and second treatment days, and a 200 mg infusion of
21:625:39532:22:22:100:512:478:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:leucovorin per meter squared on the first and second treatment days. This process
21:626:39613:22:22:100:512:456:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:is repeated every two weeks.  We price the regimens for a representative patient
21:627:39693:22:21:100:512:434:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:who has 1.7 meters squared of surface area (Jacobson et al., 2006) weighs 80
21:628:39769:21:22:100:512:413:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:kilograms, and is treated for 24 weeks. Regimen prices are derived by multiplying
21:629:39850:22:22:100:512:391:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:the average price a customer paid per milligram of active ingredient in a quarter
21:630:39931:22:21:100:512:369:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:by the recommended dosage amounts for each drug in the regimen over a 24-week

21:632:40017:22:22:116:511:326:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:We obtain most of the attribute information for each regimen from the FDA-
21:633:40091:22:21:100:512:304:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:approved package inserts that accompany each drug.  These inserts describe the
21:634:40169:21:22:100:512:283:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:phase 3 clinical trials that were conducted, including the number and types of
21:635:40247:22:22:100:512:261:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:patients enrolled in the trials, the health outcomes for patients in the treatment
21:636:40329:22:21:100:512:239:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:and control groups, and the side effects experienced by those patients. Often there
21:637:40412:21:22:100:511:218:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:are multiple observations for a regimen, either because a manufacturer conducted
21:638:40492:22:22:100:512:196:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:separate trials of the same regimen, or because a regimen may have been the
21:639:40567:22:21:100:512:174:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:treatment group in one clinical trial and the control group in a subsequent trial
21:640:40648:21:22:100:512:153:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:run by a different firm.  In these cases we calculate the mean attributes across
21:641:40728:22:22:100:512:131:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:the separate observations.  Where necessary, we supplement the package insert
21:642:40805:22:17:100:512:109:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:information with abstracts presented at oncology conferences and journal articles.
21:643:40887:17:0:80:412:92:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:?:18The regimens are priced using data for the contemporaneous quarter only.
22:644:40963:0:22:116:511:695:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:The attribute information is summarized in Table 1, organized according to
22:645:41037:22:22:100:512:673:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:the year when each regimen was introduced.   We record three measures of a
22:646:41111:22:22:100:512:651:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:regimen’s efficacy: the median number of months patients survive after initiating
22:647:41192:22:21:100:512:629:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:therapy; the percentage of patients who experience a complete or partial reduction
22:648:41274:21:22:100:512:608:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:in  the size of their tumor (i.e.,  the response rate);  and the mean  number  of
22:649:41355:22:22:100:512:586:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:months  (across patients  in  the trial)  before their  cancer  advanced  to a more
22:650:41438:22:21:100:511:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:serious  state.19For all three of these  measures,  higher  values are associated
22:651:41519:21:22:100:512:543:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:with superior health outcomes.  We also record whether a regimen contains the
22:652:41596:22:21:100:512:521:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:capecitabine tablet, which should make the administration of the regimen more
22:653:41673:21:22:100:512:500:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:convenient for a patient, and whether the regimen is approved (and was tested) as
22:654:41754:22:22:100:512:478:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:a second-line treatment. Efficacy measures for second-line regimens will generally
22:655:41836:22:22:100:512:456:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:be worse than those for first-line regimens because the patients’ cancer is likely
22:656:41918:22:21:100:512:434:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:to be more advanced at the beginning of the clinical trial and the first treatment
22:657:42000:21:22:100:255:413:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:was not completely successful.
22:658:42030:22:22:116:511:391:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:We also collected data on the percentage of patients in phase 3 trials who
22:659:42104:22:21:100:512:369:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:experienced either a grade 3 or a grade 4 side effect for five separate conditions:
22:660:42187:21:22:100:512:348:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and neutropenia.  Although many
22:661:42262:22:22:100:512:326:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:more side effects are recorded for most regimens,  these five  were consistently
22:662:42342:22:21:100:512:304:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:recorded across the 12 regimens in the sample.  Side effects are classified on a
22:663:42422:21:22:100:512:283:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:standard one to four scale, with four being the most severe. Higher values for the
22:664:42504:22:22:100:511:261:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:side effect attributes should be associatedwith worse health outcomes although,
22:665:42583:22:21:100:512:239:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:as we will show later, regimens that are more toxic are likely to be both more
22:666:42661:21:22:100:317:218:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:effective and have more severe side effects.
22:667:42705:22:22:116:511:196:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:New colorectal cancer regimens tend to be more efficacious than the existing
22:668:42781:22:21:100:511:174:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:regimens, with side effect profiles that are sometimes more and sometimes less
22:669:42859:21:22:100:512:153:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:severe than earlier regimens.  Consider the new entrant in 1996, irinotecan +

24:699:44997:34:22:100:512:661:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:In Figure 2 we plot the mean regimen price by quarter by multiplying the market
24:700:45076:22:21:100:512:639:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:share of each regimen by the price physicians paid for that regimen.  Since we
24:701:45154:21:22:100:512:618:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:do not observe prices for the outside option, regimen market shares are rescaled
24:702:45234:22:22:100:512:596:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:to equal one once the outside option is omitted.  The price to physicians of a

24:704:45389:21:22:100:512:553:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:of colorectal cancer drugs increased to $597 in the first quarter of 1998 when two

24:708:45710:22:22:100:512:466:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:between 1998 and 2001 as the market share of the irinotecan-based regimens
24:709:45784:22:21:100:512:444:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:increased and capecitabine was launched (see Figure 1).  Most of the increase
24:710:45861:21:22:100:512:423:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:was due to patients being shifted to the irinotecan-based regimens (see Figure 1)
24:711:45942:22:22:100:512:401:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:rather than increases in the prices of the new regimens once they were launched.
24:712:46022:22:21:100:512:379:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:The mean regimen price increased by 848 percent between the first quarter of

24:718:46491:22:21:100:512:249:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:in the third quarter of 2005 (a 35 percent increase from 2004). The prices of the
24:719:46572:21:22:100:512:228:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:three regimens with the largest market shares in the third quarter of 2005 were

24:723:46861:22:18:116:511:141:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:To derive a naive price index that does not account for the changing attributes
24:724:46940:18:21:80:541:123:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:?:21Irinotecan began generating sales in the IMS Health data set in the second quarter of 1996.  However,
24:725:47043:21:0:70:463:102:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:?:Medicare claims recorded irinotecan in an ”other” category until the first quarter of 1998.
25:726:47136:0:22:100:512:695:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:of the regimens, one would divide the mean prices in Figure 2 by $127, the mean
25:727:47215:22:22:100:512:673:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:price in the first quarter of 1993. The shape of the naive index is identical to that
25:728:47300:22:22:100:512:651:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:of Figure 2, with the only difference that it is indexed to one in the first quarter

26:773:50776:22:22:100:512:326:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:value rises 43 percent by 2002 due to the increasing price of irinotecan and the
26:774:50856:22:21:100:512:304:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:launch of capecitabine in 2001.  The incremental cost then falls with the intro-
26:775:50936:21:22:100:512:283:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:duction of oxaliplatin- and bevacizumab-based regimens and is 20 percent higher
26:776:51015:22:22:100:512:261:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:in the third quarter of 2005 than the first quarter of 1998.  By comparison, the
26:777:51095:22:21:100:468:239:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:consumer price index increased by 19.8 percent during this time period.
26:778:51166:21:22:116:511:218:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:The mean incremental cost per incremental QALY displays a similar pattern,
26:779:51240:22:22:100:512:196:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:with a slightly higher peak in 2002.   Recall that we use nominal rather than
26:780:51317:22:21:100:512:174:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:real prices when constructing the indices to avoid building one index on top of
26:781:51396:21:22:100:511:153:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:another.  As a point of reference, however, the consumer price index increased
26:782:51474:22:22:100:512:131:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:by 35.2 percent between 1993 and 2005.  Coefficient estimates from the hedonic
26:783:51552:22:17:100:512:109:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:regression are reported in Table 3. The dependent variable is the logarithm of the
26:784:51634:17:0:80:495:92:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:?:24Because we omit 5-FU and the second-line regimens, the weights sum to one in each quarter.
27:785:51728:0:22:100:512:695:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:price a customer paid for regimen j in quarter t. Regimen attributes are included
27:786:51809:22:22:100:512:673:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:as well as a full set of quarter indicator variables.  We also interact the second
27:787:51891:22:22:100:381:651:143:g_d0_f3:64:g_d0_f4:B:line therapy indicator with a regimen’s response rate.25
27:788:51947:22:21:116:511:629:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:The coefficients on two of the three efficacy measures are positive and signifi-
27:789:52027:21:22:100:512:608:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:cant. An increase of one month in the median patient survival is associated with
27:790:52107:22:22:100:512:586:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:a 64.2 percent increase in the price of a regimen.26Evaluated at the mean regi-
27:791:52186:22:21:100:512:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:men price in the sample ($21,113), this implies an increase of $13,555. Physicians
27:792:52268:21:22:100:512:543:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:are implicitly valuing an expected year of life saved at $162,700. Regimens with
27:793:52348:22:21:100:512:521:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:relatively high response rates are also priced higher, with the effect smaller for
27:794:52430:21:22:100:209:500:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:second-line therapies.
27:795:52452:22:22:116:511:478:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:The coefficient on time to progression is negative, which seems to indicate that
27:796:52532:22:22:100:512:456:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:physicians assign a negative valuation to that attribute. Pakes (2005) shows that
27:797:52613:22:21:100:512:434:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:coefficients in hedonic regressions will not necessarily have their expected signs.
27:798:52696:21:22:100:512:413:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:His insight is that the degree of competition will differ across the attribute space.
27:799:52781:22:22:100:511:391:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:In the situation of colorectal cancer, forexample, there may be greater differenti-
27:800:52864:22:21:100:512:369:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:ation and less competition with the survival and response rate attributes relative
27:801:52946:21:22:100:512:348:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:to time to progression.  Pharmaceutical and biotech firms design their products
27:802:53025:22:22:100:512:326:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:and construct the clinical trials that will define the attributes years before the
27:803:53107:22:21:100:511:304:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:products are approved and marketed. It isquite plausible, therefore, that at any
27:804:53187:21:22:100:512:283:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:given point in time there could more differentiation on certain attributes than
27:805:53266:22:22:100:134:261:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:others.
27:806:53273:22:21:116:511:239:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:Two of the side effect attributes have negative coefficients and three have
27:807:53348:21:22:100:512:218:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:positive coefficients in Table 3. Cancer patients often take drugs that ameliorate
27:808:53430:22:22:100:512:196:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:the impact of certain side effects, such as pain, nausea, and vomiting. In addition
27:809:53513:22:21:100:512:174:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:to the explanation above, this may be another reason why physicians seem to
27:810:53588:21:22:100:512:153:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:assign a positive value to the abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting side effects.
27:811:53669:22:18:100:512:131:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:If a physician prescribes anti-pain and antiemetic drugs in conjunction with the
27:812:53749:18:13:80:453:113:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:?:25We did not include other second-line attribute interactions due to multi-colinearity.
27:813:53836:13:0:80:189:100:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:?:260.642 = exp(0.496) - 1.
28:814:53863:0:22:100:512:695:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:anti-cancer drugs, she may downgrade the importance of these side effects when
28:815:53941:22:22:100:512:673:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:choosing a regimen.  A third possible explanation for the positive coefficients on
28:816:54023:22:22:100:512:651:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:three of the side effect attributes is that physicians may believe that the efficacy
28:817:54107:22:21:100:512:629:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:of the newer drugs are better than the measures reported in phase 3 clinical trials.
28:818:54191:21:22:100:512:608:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:This could occur, for example, if physicians use the drugs differently in practice
28:819:54273:22:22:100:512:586:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:than as they were used in the trials due to learning about patient-drug matching.
28:820:54354:22:21:100:512:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:Because the newer drugs are more toxic and generally have greater side effects,
28:821:54433:21:22:100:512:543:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:the physician beliefs would be captured as positive coefficients on the side effect
28:822:54516:22:21:100:149:521:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:measures.
28:823:54525:21:22:116:511:500:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:The very large positive coefficient on the second-line indicator variable con-
28:824:54603:22:22:100:512:478:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:firms that these therapies are priced much higher than first-line therapies, con-
28:825:54684:22:22:100:512:456:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:trolling for the attributes of each. This implies there is a much higher willingness
28:826:54768:22:21:100:512:434:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:to pay for an extra life year for the very sick relative to the less sick. Finally, reg-
28:827:54856:21:22:100:512:413:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:imens containing the capecitabine tablet are priced slightly lower than regimens
28:828:54936:22:22:100:512:391:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:that use 5-FU/LV instead.  This does not necessarily imply that physicians do
28:829:55013:22:21:100:512:369:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:not value the convenience associated with the tablet but also less dosage of other
28:830:55095:21:22:100:511:348:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:drugs.  As indicated in Appendix 1, the dosages of certain branded drugs (e.g.,
28:831:55174:22:22:100:450:326:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:irinotecan) are lower when capecitabine is used instead of 5-FU/LV.
28:832:55241:22:21:116:511:304:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:We exponentiate the coefficients on the quarter indicator variables (the first
28:833:55319:21:22:100:512:283:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:quarter of 1993 is omitted) and plot the hedonic price index in Figure 4.  The
28:834:55397:22:22:100:512:261:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:pattern of prices for the hedonic index (the lower line) in Figure 4 is dramatically
28:835:55481:22:21:100:512:239:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:different from Figure 2, which emphasizes the importance of controlling for prod-
28:836:55562:21:22:100:512:218:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:uct attributes. Prices were stable in nominal terms between 1993 and the second
28:837:55641:22:22:100:512:196:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:quarter of 1996 when the only regimen approved for colorectal cancer treatment
28:838:55719:22:21:100:512:174:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:was 5-FU/LV and the components of this regimen were no longer patent pro-
28:839:55792:21:22:100:512:153:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:tected. The hedonic index drops by about 25 points with the introduction of the
28:840:55871:22:22:100:512:131:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:two irinotecan-based therapies, which were priced at about $16,000. Controlling
28:841:55950:22:21:100:512:109:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:for the attributes of these new regimens and physicians’ valuations of those at-
28:842:56030:21:0:100:512:88:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:tributes, prices fell by about 25 percent.  Over the next six years, including the
29:843:56114:0:22:100:512:695:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:period when capecitabine was introduced, the index increased from 0.71 to 0.85.
29:844:56193:22:22:100:512:673:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:The price index jumped by six points with the introduction of the oxaliplatin-
29:845:56271:22:22:100:512:651:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:based regimens in 2002, and has remained fairly constant since then during the
29:846:56349:22:21:100:382:629:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:time when cetuximab and bevacizumab were launched.
29:847:56399:21:22:116:511:608:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:A:In the same figure we show the quality-adjusted price index.  The quality-
29:848:56473:22:22:100:512:586:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:adjusted index is very similar to the hedonic price index during the period where
29:849:56554:22:21:100:512:564:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:only 5-FU/LV was present.  There is a decrease of 28 points during 1998, when
29:850:56631:21:22:100:511:543:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:irinotecan started showing positive market shares.27That decrease after the intro-
29:851:56713:22:21:100:512:521:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:duction of irinotecan was also present in the hedonic price index in 1996. During
29:852:56794:21:22:100:512:500:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:the period 1999 to 2001, the quality-adjusted price index slowly increases as does
29:853:56876:22:22:100:512:478:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:the hedonic price index, but in 2002 when oxaliplatin is introduced their pre-
29:854:56954:22:22:100:511:456:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:dictions differ.  The quality-adjusted index exhibits a decrease after oxaliplatin
29:855:57036:22:21:100:512:434:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:is introduced, which may provide evidence that the hedonic price index is not
29:856:57113:21:22:100:512:413:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:able to capture the extending the range or filling the spectrum type of innova-
29:857:57192:22:22:100:512:391:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:tion that occurred during this period.  The 8-percentage point decrease in the
29:858:57270:22:21:100:512:369:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:quality-adjusted price index after the introduction of oxaliplatin contrasts with
29:859:57351:21:22:100:512:348:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:the 6 percentage points increase in the hedonic price index. Finally, the quality-
29:860:57433:22:22:100:512:326:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:adjusted price index remains decreasing towards the end of our period of analysis.
29:861:57515:22:21:100:512:304:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:Contrasting with the previous two models, the vertical model shows that innova-
29:862:57594:21:22:100:512:283:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:tion results in moderate, but positive price increases.  The parameter estimates
29:863:57674:22:22:100:512:261:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:for this model are shown in Table 5, and the distribution of the random coefficient
29:864:57757:22:50:100:269:239:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:on price is presented in Figure 5.
29:865:57791:50:34:100:222:189:296:g_d0_f2:296:g_d0_f2:C:6  Conclusion
29:866:57804:34:22:100:512:155:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:This paper provides evidence to support the idea that new medical technology,
29:867:57881:22:17:100:512:133:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:in particular colon cancer drugs, provide welfare increases that justify their cost.
29:868:57965:17:22:80:541:116:49:g_d0_f5:99:g_d0_f6:?:27Although irinotecan was introduced in 1996, the SEER data set only shows positive market shares for
29:869:58066:22:0:70:147:94:99:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f6:?:this drug in 1998.
30:870:58086:0:22:100:512:695:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:We calculate a naive price index that does not adjust for improving attributes
30:871:58164:22:22:100:512:673:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:and compare it with a hedonic price index and two quality-adjusted price indices.
30:872:58245:22:22:100:512:651:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:The conclusions about the evolution of prices of new pharmaceutical developments
30:873:58325:22:21:100:512:629:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:differs substantially between the naive price index and the three methods that
30:874:58403:21:22:100:512:608:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:take into account changing product attributes. While the naive price index shows
30:875:58483:22:22:100:512:586:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:B:a dramatic increase in prices over the 13-year period we study, the hedonic price
