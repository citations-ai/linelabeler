2:31:1649:28:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:Medical   innovations   have   improved   survival   and   treatment   for   many   diseases   but   have 
2:32:1755:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:simultaneously raised spending on health care. Many health economists believe that technological 
2:33:1851:14:14:72:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:change  is  the  major factor  driving  the  growth  of  the  heath  care  sector.  Whether  quality  has 
2:34:1956:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:increased  as  much  as  spending is  a  central  question  for  both  positive  and  normative  analysis  of 
2:35:2065:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:this  sector.  This  is  a  question  of  the impact  of  new  innovations  on  quality-adjusted  prices  in 
2:36:2173:14:14:72:542:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:health care. We perform a systematic analysis of the impact of technological change on quality-
2:37:2267:14:14:71:545:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:adjusted  prices,  with  over  six  thousand  comparisons of  innovations  to  incumbent  technologies. 
2:38:2370:14:14:71:545:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:For  each  innovation  in  our  dataset,  we  observe  its  price and  quality,  as  well  as  the  price  and 
2:39:2480:14:14:71:546:462:12:Times:12:Times:C:quality  of  an  incumbent  technology  treating  the  same  disease. Our  main  finding  is  that  an 
2:40:2582:14:14:71:545:448:12:Times:12:Times:C:innovation’s quality-adjusted prices is higher than the incumbent’s for about two-thirds (68%) of 
2:41:2679:14:14:71:545:434:12:Times:12:Times:C:innovations. Despite this finding, we argue that quality-adjusted prices may fall or rise over time 
2:42:2778:14:14:71:546:420:12:Times:12:Times:C:depending  on  how  fast  prices  decline  for  a  given  treatment  over  time.  We  calibrate that  price 
2:43:2885:14:14:71:545:406:12:Times:12:Times:C:declines of 4% between the time when a treatment is a new innovation and the time when it has 
2:44:2978:14:14:71:545:392:12:Times:12:Times:C:become  the  incumbent  would  be  sufficient  to  offset  the  observed  price  difference  between 
2:45:3079:14:14:71:546:378:12:Times:12:Times:C:innovators and incumbents for a majority of indications. Using standard duopoly models of price 
2:46:3174:14:14:71:545:364:12:Times:12:Times:C:competition for  differentiated  products,  we  analyze  and  assess  empirically  the  conditions  under 
2:47:3279:14:14:71:545:350:12:Times:12:Times:C:which  quality-adjusted prices  will  be  higher  for  innovators  than  incumbents.  We  conclude  by 
2:48:3381:14:14:71:545:336:12:Times:12:Times:C:discussing  the  conditions  particular to  the  health  care  industry  that  may  result  in  less  rapid 
2:49:3488:14:45:71:378:322:12:Times:12:Times:C:declines, or even increases, in quality-adjusted prices over time.

3:69:3924:0:19:72:208:700:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:1    Introduction
3:70:3941:19:18:89:539:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Given the rapid expansion of spending on health care in most rich nations, there is an
3:71:4027:18:18:72:540:663:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ongoing debate about whether this spending growth is accompanied by greater value and
3:72:4112:18:18:72:540:645:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quality of care.  Rapid medical innovation that enables us to treat previously untreatable
3:73:4202:18:18:72:540:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:diseases and improve existing treatments is central to both spending growth and improve-
3:74:4290:18:18:72:540:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ments in care.  A central question of health economics is whether the increased spending is
3:75:4381:18:18:72:540:591:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:valuable – that is, whether it raises the benefits from health care more than it increases the
3:76:4475:18:17:72:540:573:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cost of care.  Whether quality-adjusted prices rise or fall with new innovations is central to
3:77:4569:17:18:72:132:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this debate.
3:78:4581:18:18:89:539:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In this paper we provide new systematic evidence on how quality-adjusted prices change
3:79:4667:18:18:72:540:520:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with new medical innovations by analyzing thousands of new innovations.  We obtain such a
3:80:4756:18:18:72:540:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:large set of technologies by recognizing the economic content of medical “cost-effectiveness”
3:81:4849:18:18:72:540:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:studies,  performed  over  the  course  of  at  least  half  a  century.   By  using  an  economic  lens
3:82:4953:18:18:72:540:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to reinterpret the cost-effectiveness literature, we can gain more systematic insight into the
3:83:5047:18:18:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:impact of technological change on quality-adjusted prices.  In particular, what this literature
3:84:5142:18:18:72:540:430:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:calls the “cost-effectiveness ratio” is the price of the technology divided by the quality of
3:85:5235:18:18:72:540:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  treatment.   It  is  a  quality-adjusted  price,  analogous  to  the  price  per  square  foot  of
3:86:5338:18:18:72:540:394:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:housing.  The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) compares the price and quality of
3:87:5429:18:18:72:540:376:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a new treatment with a “comparator” – usually the incumbent technology representing the
3:88:5516:18:18:72:540:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:standard of care prior to the arrival of the new treatment. The goal of the ICER is to measure
3:89:5610:18:18:72:540:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the marginal quality-adjusted price of the added quality provided by the new innovation.
3:90:5698:18:17:72:540:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Therefore, studies reporting ICER levels often offer measures of both the quality and price
3:91:5789:17:18:72:540:305:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of innovators and incumbents.  We use a database of cost-effectiveness studies from Tufts
3:92:5878:18:18:72:540:287:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Medical Center called the Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry (CEAR) which contains over
3:93:5967:18:18:72:540:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:four thousand cost-effectiveness studies. This is a comprehensive data set of cost-effectiveness
3:94:6063:18:18:72:479:251:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:articles published in the peer-reviewed medical literature over the last 40 years.
3:95:6145:18:18:89:539:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Using these data, our main finding concerns the cross-sectional relationship between new
3:96:6233:18:18:72:540:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:innovations and incumbent technologies; that is, how the quality-adjusted price between the
3:97:6324:18:18:72:540:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:two compare at a given point in time.  We find that, for the median innovation, the entrant
3:98:6415:18:18:72:540:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:has a quality-adjusted price that is four percent higher than that of the incumbent,  with
3:99:6505:18:18:72:540:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:68  percent  of  new  technologies  having  higher  quality-adjusted  prices.   This  comes  from  a
3:100:6605:18:18:72:540:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:combination  of  slightly  higher  quality  (median  1%)  and  moderately  higher  price  (median
3:101:6702:18:18:72:540:125:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:8%).  We interpret these data in a standard differentiated duopoly model and analyze its
3:102:6790:18:18:72:540:107:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:implications for differences between innovators and incumbents in quality-adjusted prices.  In
3:103:6884:18:18:72:540:89:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:particular, we analyze how these differences reflect the impact of breakthrough innovations,
3:104:6976:18:0:72:335:71:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:production costs, and third-party payment policies.
4:105:7028:0:18:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:It is often argued that health care differs from other industries in that quality-adjusted
4:106:7118:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prices rise over time instead of falling as they do in other industries, such as telecommunica-
4:107:7213:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tions.  At first glance, our findings seem consistent with that pattern.  However, this ignores
4:108:7308:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the time series behavior of prices of a given technology due to competition.  In particular,
4:109:7400:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:new therapeutic competition from related innovations and generic competition due to patent
4:110:7490:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expiration often cause prices of a given treatment to fall overtime.  Therefore,  the overall
4:111:7583:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price  of  treating  a  disease  may  fall  over  time,  even  though  new  innovations  have  higher
4:112:7684:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prices in the cross section.  In other words, a new innovation can be more expensive than the
4:113:7777:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:incumbent after entry and still be cheaper than the incumbent innovation was before entry.
4:114:7867:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We calibrate that if competition caused innovations to cut prices by at least 4.2% before the
4:115:7960:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:entry of subsequent new technologies then overall quality-adjusted prices would fall for half
4:116:8053:18:18:72:474:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the markets, despite new innovations being more costly in the cross section.
4:117:8132:18:18:89:539:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This paper relates to several strands of work.  Aggregate growth accounting attributes
4:118:8218:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the residual from health care spending regression to the impact of technological change, but
4:119:8310:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:does not measure innovation directly (Newhouse, 1992).  Jena and Philipson (2008) used the
4:120:8400:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:CEAR data to address topics of a broader nature than the product-specific evaluations for
4:121:8489:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which it was designed by analyzing the relationship between cost-effectiveness thresholds and
4:122:8582:18:18:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:innovation incentives.  The paper also relates to existing case studies that look at quality-
4:123:8675:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:adjusted price trends within a given indication, such as Cutler et al. (1998) for heart disease
4:124:8770:18:18:72:269:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and Frank et al. (1999) for depression.

4:126:8896:18:18:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:studies.   Section  3  considers  the  cross-sectional  findings  of  the  relationship  between  price
4:127:8999:18:18:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and quality of new innovations and incumbent technologies.  Section 4 interprets the data

4:129:9181:18:18:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in  quality-adjusted  prices.   Section  5  discusses  time  trends  of  quality-adjusted  prices  and
4:130:9283:18:18:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:potential explanations for the discussed findings.  Finally, Section 6 summarizes the findings

4:133:9407:21:18:89:539:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We use data from the Tufts Medical Center Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry (CEAR).
4:134:9493:18:18:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:CEAR is a dataset of the methods and findings of about 4,800 published cost-utility analysis
4:135:9585:18:17:72:540:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:articles some of which cover multiple treatments.  The database is intended to be a compre-

4:137:9771:18:18:72:540:117:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:registry uses two trained reviewers to independently review each article and collect a wide

4:139:9926:18:0:89:539:81:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Each article compares a newer treatment option to one or more standards of care (SOC).
5:140:10013:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The registry collects and organizes data on article information, disease classification, methods
5:141:10109:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the study, and measurement details.  The data set covers articles published between 1976
5:142:10200:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and 2014 with the number of articles increasing from an average of one per year during the
5:143:10290:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:first 10 years, to an average of about 475 articles per year during the last five years.  As a
5:144:10384:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:result, 85% of the data comes from papers published between 2004 and 2014.  About half

5:146:10565:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the standard of care.  The other articles have only a single measure of the incremental
5:147:10656:18:27:72:526:582:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:cost efficiency ratio (ICER) – the difference in price divided by the difference in quality.1

5:173:12249:18:19:72:540:112:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The price of an intervention (either the innovation or the standard of care) includes all the

5:175:12444:15:0:72:415:78:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:additional quality gained from the innovation, relative to the standard of care.
6:176:12525:0:18:72:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:costs that the article was able to measure – both direct costs and non-health care costs.2
6:177:12615:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Since the total cost is the full price of the treatment, we simply refer to it as the price of
6:178:12709:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the treatment.  The price for both the new treatment and the SOC are measured per person
6:179:12797:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:treated.  We convert them to 2014 US dollars using the medical CPI and yearly exchange

6:181:12890:18:18:89:539:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Effectiveness is measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALY), which is a combination
6:182:12977:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  the  length  of  life  and  quality  of  life  added  by  the  treatment.   A  year  of  perfect  health
6:183:13085:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is equal to one QALY and a year of death is zero QALY, with different levels of health in

6:185:13258:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:year at perfect health.  The effectiveness of a treatment is how many QALYs it adds to a
6:186:13346:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:patient,  which we refer to as quality.  Similar to costs,  both the innovation and the SOC
6:187:13437:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have quality measures.  We omit observations with quality values greater than 100, since it
6:188:13528:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:does not make sense for a treatment to add more than 100 years to someone’s life.  We also
6:189:13618:18:17:72:285:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:omit studies with negative quality values.
6:190:13660:17:18:89:539:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Prices of the innovations range dramatically, from around $282 to $315,324 between the
6:191:13746:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:5th  and  95th  percentile  since  a  wide  variety  of  treatments  are  included.   The  median  is
6:192:13847:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:around  $22,000.   Quality  also  has  a  large  range,  roughly  between  0.26  and  27  QALY  for
6:193:13946:18:18:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the 5th and 95th percentile, with a median of 7.8 QALY. The treatments with large prices
6:194:14034:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and qualities include surgeries such as prophylactic oophorectomy,  a surgery that reduces

6:198:14357:18:18:89:539:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:One potential concern about using CEAR is that there may be great heterogeneity in

6:200:14533:18:18:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that each study in the registry has been evaluated in terms of its quality through a scoring
6:201:14625:18:18:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:system.  In compiling the dataset, the readers of the registry rate each article on a scale from
6:202:14721:18:17:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1 to 7, based on perceived correctness and comprehensiveness.  This is a nice feature because
6:203:14814:17:18:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:it tells us which observations we should rely on more.  We report our findings for the overall

7:231:17403:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which would bias our attempts to understand how the average new innovation affects quality-
7:232:17494:18:18:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:adjusted prices.  For instance, if only the most cost-effective new treatments get studied or
7:233:17587:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:there is a publication bias in favor of findings of high cost-effectiveness, that would bias our
7:234:17683:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimates.  For selection to be an issue it would need to occur independent of the intervention
7:235:17778:18:18:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:type, disease, country, and sponsor type since we control for these.  We do not have data on
7:236:17870:18:18:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:market share, so we are comparing product level differences in price and quality between the

8:256:19705:17:18:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:incumbent technology corresponds to the standard of care and has quality and price (qs, ps),
8:257:19797:18:18:72:540:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:while the new innovation has quality and price (q, p).  The slopes from the origin represent
8:258:19889:18:18:72:540:563:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the quality-adjusted prices; the slope between the incumbent and the innovators quality price

8:260:20075:18:18:72:540:527:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:adjusted price) of the innovator is larger than that of the incumbent when the marginal price

8:262:20259:18:28:72:448:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rises if and only if the marginal price is higher than the previous average.

8:273:20396:34:18:89:539:223:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:If one imagines centering a graph around the incumbents price and quality, (qs, ps), the
8:274:20484:18:18:71:539:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quadrants  represent  combinations  of  price  and  quality  differences  that  the  new  innovator
8:275:20583:18:18:71:539:187:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:can represent.  For example in the northwest quadrant the innovator has both higher quality
8:276:20674:18:18:71:539:169:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  price;  within  that  quadrant,  quality-adjusted  prices  rise  if  price  differences  dominate

8:279:20967:18:18:71:539:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:represents an incumbent’s quality and price and the axes reflect the percentage difference in

9:285:21452:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:incumbent.  There is a price increase in 78% of observations and a quality increase in 85%.

9:288:21725:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is  26%,  but  the  median  is  1%.   The  percentage  change  in  price  has  a  much  wider  range
9:289:21825:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:than the percentage change in quality.  The 31% of innovations below the 45◦line (green) in
9:290:21916:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Figure 2 have lower quality-adjusted prices.  The innovations with higher quality-adjusted
9:291:22006:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prices than the incumbent are split into the 11% that lower quality (red) and the 56% that

9:293:22187:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:those that improve quality can be better for consumers because they offer more quality than
9:294:22278:18:342:72:414:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:what was available to purchase at the lower quality-adjusted price.

9:298:22603:15:14:72:540:106:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:of observations that fall in that quadrant or octant, including the outliers that are censored from the graph.

9:300:22816:15:0:72:511:77:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:parentheses are the average percent difference in quality and price for observations in that quadrant.
10:301:22919:0:18:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Under  extreme  substitutability  of  demand  across  treatments,  off-diagonal  elements  in

10:303:23102:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the data, as 69% of the innovations lie on the diagonal quadrants where higher quality
10:304:23191:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:treatments  command  higher  prices.   However,  note  that  there  is  a  non-trivial  fraction  of
10:305:23291:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:innovations with higher quality and lower price (19%), but nevertheless do not destroy the
10:306:23381:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:market for the SOC. There are also some innovations with that enter with a higher price
10:307:23468:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and lower quality (10%).  This may be due to heterogeneity in treatment effects.  Another
10:308:23557:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:explanation is that the first type of innovation will eventually replace the SOC after being
10:309:23649:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shown to be of higher value and the latter will exit after it becomes evident they are of lower

10:313:23923:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f8:B:ratio of the quality-adjusted prices of the new innovation and the SOC,pq/psqs.If thisquality-
10:314:24017:18:17:72:539:474:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:B:adjusted price ratiois above one, it means the new innovation had a higher quality-adjusted
10:315:24108:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price than the SOC. The histogram indicates that a high fraction of new technologies do not
10:316:24199:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:change quality-adjusted prices much, but new innovations do tend to have higher quality-
10:317:24287:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:adjusted prices than the SOCs.  The median ratio is 1.04, meaning the quality-adjusted price
10:318:24379:18:18:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the innovation is 4% higher than the standard of care; the distribution is very right skewed
10:319:24474:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with a standard deviation of 32, so only 2.4% of innovations have cost effectiveness ratios
10:320:24565:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that are statistically larger than one.  If we focus on highly scored studies,  the median is
10:321:24658:18:18:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:about the same, but the standard deviation is even higher.  Only 0.9% of those studies are
10:322:24748:18:18:72:230:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:statistically different from one.
10:323:24781:18:18:89:539:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:These are the overall effects for all disease categories and modes of intervention.  Table
10:324:24871:18:18:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2 breaks down the change in quality-adjusted-price for the most common disease categories.
10:325:24961:18:18:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Infectious disease, malignant neoplasms, and breast cancer have the highest quality-adjusted
10:326:25053:18:18:72:539:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prices relative to the incumbents.  Table 3 does the same for intervention types.5Pharma-
10:327:25142:18:17:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ceuticals are the intervention type with the highest relative price.  Educational interventions
10:328:25237:17:18:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tend to be less expensive relative to the incumbent and also vary less.  The differences across
10:329:25332:18:18:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intervention type are not as robust to the exclusion of low-scored studies as the disease cat-
10:330:25426:18:18:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:egories.  These tables indicate that the large variation we see in relative cost effectiveness
10:331:25520:18:18:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of an innovation is not due primarily to differences across disease categories or treatment
10:332:25611:18:18:72:437:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:types.  There is more variation within categories than across categories.
10:333:25684:18:18:89:539:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:One  reason  one  may  suspect  innovators  to  command  high  quality-adjusted  prices  is  if
10:334:25779:18:18:72:540:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:they  offer  “breakthrough”  innovations.   To  investigate  this  we  examine  the  impact  of  the

15:454:32372:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Pharmaceutical innovations have somewhat higher prices than others, with the effect being

16:506:34803:19:18:89:539:396:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Figure 4 illustrates two typical increasing best response functionsp(ps) andps(p), where
16:507:34891:18:18:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the intersection is the equilibrium.  Consider now the effects of costs and quality levels on the
16:508:34988:18:17:72:540:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equilibrium difference in quality-adjusted prices between the innovator and the incumbent.
16:509:35078:17:18:72:540:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:For the effects of costs, note that the best response function of one party does not depend on
16:510:35172:18:18:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the costs of the other party.  Therefore, an increase in cost of the innovator simply raises its
16:511:35268:18:18:72:540:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price for each price of the incumbent and corresponds to an upward shift in its best response

17:552:36409:19:18:89:539:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:One argument that is often made is that breakthrough innovations are responsible for

17:556:36780:18:18:72:540:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:indirectly through the effect on price.  These effects will tend to be offsetting, so the size of
17:557:36877:18:17:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the quality difference has an indeterminate effect on the difference in quality-adjusted prices;
17:558:36973:17:18:72:381:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:breakthrough innovations may lower quality-adjusted prices.

17:577:37279:18:18:72:540:168:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:raise quality-adjusted prices, the price difference must dominate the quality difference.  The
17:578:37373:18:18:72:540:150:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price ratio is made up of markup differences and cost differences.  An increase in quality-
17:579:37464:18:18:72:540:132:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:adjusted prices is therefore more likely if there is a large markup difference (e.g., when the
17:580:37558:18:18:72:540:114:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:incumbent standard of care has gone generic) or large cost differences (e.g,  injected large

18:583:37743:19:18:89:539:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:It is often argued that in countries with price controls on medical innovations such as in
18:584:37833:18:18:72:540:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the United Kingdom, changes in quality-adjusted prices will be lower than for countries with
18:585:37925:18:18:72:540:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:market based pricing such as the United States.  However, this is not necessarily implied by
18:586:38017:18:18:72:540:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:standard duopoly models.  First consider when there is cost-based pricing of the incumbent
18:587:38107:18:18:72:540:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:technology due to competition.  With “cost-effectiveness threshold” policies, price controls
18:588:38199:18:18:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are  imposed  in  terms  of  reservation  prices  above  which  the  single-payer  system  does  not
18:589:38299:18:17:72:540:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reimburse for new technologies.  Such policies restrict the marginal price of quality (ICER)
18:590:38391:17:18:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:charged  for  new  innovations  to  be  below  a  given  threshold  levelT.   The  resulting  upper
18:591:38490:18:18:72:540:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bound on the monopoly price depends on the price of the incumbent and the qualities of the
18:592:38580:18:22:72:221:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:incumbent and the innovator

18:596:38632:32:18:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Such  thresholds  imply  that  the  innovator  cannot  price  higher  than  the  incumbent’s  price
18:597:38731:18:18:72:540:444:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:after it is adjusted for any difference in the quality.  However, the innovation may still have
18:598:38826:18:18:72:540:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a  higher  quality-adjusted  price.   If  the  innovator  prices  at  the  price  ceiling,  then  quality-

18:610:39086:18:18:71:539:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quality (the threshold) is larger than the quality-adjusted price of the incumbent (i.e. the
18:611:39178:18:18:71:540:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:incumbent has not priced up to the threshold).  Put simply, the average new price,p/q, is
18:612:39267:18:18:71:539:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:above the incumbent price,ps/qs, only if the marginal price,T, is above the incumbent price.

18:615:39544:17:18:71:539:237:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:optimal price given the elasticity of demand in a private market.  If the public sector sets
18:616:39636:18:18:71:539:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:‘too generous’ a reservation price (threshold), the resulting demand curve (which is a step-
18:617:39728:18:18:71:539:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:function)  may  lead  to  a  higher  price  than  the  monopoly  price  in  a  market  with  multiple
18:618:39829:18:18:71:539:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:buyers.  Public price controls per se do not mean smaller changes in quality-adjusted prices,
18:619:39922:18:18:71:539:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:because their ceilings apply to a market with only one buyer as opposed to the unregulated
18:620:40012:18:18:71:539:147:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price that occurs under several buyers.  The imposition of a single payer price ceiling does
18:621:40104:18:18:71:254:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not hold market structure constant.
18:622:40139:18:18:89:539:111:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:When innovators price at the price ceiling, this determines not only the price of the new
18:623:40228:18:18:71:539:93:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:innovation, but also the reference point for price of future care.  If the price has not decreased
18:624:40326:18:0:71:539:75:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:over time and the next generation innovation prices up to the limit, a monopolist setting the
19:625:40421:0:30:72:266:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ICER equal to the threshold T means

19:627:40475:30:18:72:141:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which implies
19:628:40488:18:25:253:357:630:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:?:pt=p0+T(qt−q0).
19:629:40503:25:17:72:540:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The marginal prices of quality for each subsequent innovation are equal over time; therefore
19:630:40595:17:18:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the average price of quality is equal to this constant marginal price.  In this extreme case,
19:631:40688:18:18:72:536:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:under price controls both the marginal and average price do not change due to innovation.
19:632:40777:18:18:89:539:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:If the incumbent has market power, rather than setting price exogenously equal to cost, it
19:633:40867:18:18:72:539:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:setspsaccording to a best response function, as depicted earlier in Figure 4.  If the innovator
19:634:40962:18:18:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:has a higher quality the best response functionp(ps) of the innovator will generally start
19:635:41052:18:18:72:540:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:above  the  origin  and  never  cross  over  the  45  degree  line.   The  restriction  ICER≤Tis

19:637:41225:18:18:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:45 degree line.  The logic is the same as when the incumbent technology is competitively
19:638:41313:18:18:72:540:444:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:supplied. If the ICER constraint is binding, the regulated difference in quality-adjusted prices
19:639:41409:18:18:72:540:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:between the innovator and incumbent is smaller than the unregulated onep=ps+T(q−qs).
19:640:41493:18:18:72:540:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:If  the  constraint  would  not  be  binding  in  a  competitive  market,  the  regulated  price  may
19:641:41594:18:18:72:540:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be higher because the innovator can price up to the constraint, without facing the loss in
19:642:41684:18:18:72:355:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:demand that they would have in a competitive market.
19:643:41736:18:17:89:539:354:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This implies that differences in quality-adjusted prices between innovators and incum-
19:644:41822:17:18:72:540:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bents may not differ between places such as the United States and European Union, though
19:645:41910:18:18:72:540:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:differences in price levels may exist.  For example, if the United States has market-based pric-

19:647:42096:18:18:72:540:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prices may be lower in the United Kingdom, but differences in quality-adjusted prices be-

20:671:43230:36:18:72:540:496:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:product enters with a higher quality and the prices of the incumbents fall.  In both cases, the
20:672:43325:18:18:72:540:478:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price-quality relationship is convex within a year; the entrant has a higher quality-adjusted-
20:673:43419:18:18:72:540:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price than existing products, so quality-adjusted-price is increasing in quality.  However, the

20:679:43996:18:17:72:540:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:particularly when a new entry occurs, but the higher prices of new products cause an overall
20:680:44088:17:18:72:540:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:upward trend in quality-adjusted prices.  Figure 6b shows a market where the fall in prices
20:681:44179:18:18:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:upon entry is large relative to the cross-sectional difference between the incumbent and the
20:682:44271:18:18:72:540:299:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:entrant, so there is an overall downward trend.  Innovators having a higher price at a given

22:796:47464:18:18:72:540:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:adjusted prices than the incumbent, they do not require a price drop.  For the other 68%

22:798:47651:18:18:72:540:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  innovations  would  have  prices  lower  than  the  incumbent’s  pre-entry  price.   If  the  new
22:799:47752:18:18:72:540:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:innovation only gets 60% marketshare, then the median of those requiring a price drop is
22:800:47840:18:18:72:540:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:10%; a price drop of only 64% is needed for 95% of all innovations to have prices lower than

23:811:48494:19:18:89:539:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Much of the policy discussion of pharmaceutical pricing in the last few years has been
23:812:48580:18:18:72:540:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:centered on new ‘specialty drugs’ and whether their incremental benefits justify their larger
23:813:48673:18:18:72:540:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prices,  i.e. whether they have higher or lower quality-adjusted prices.  We use two salient
23:814:48765:18:18:72:540:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:specialty  drug  classes:  treatments  for  the  hepatitis  C  virus  (HCV)  and  multiple  sclerosis
23:815:48866:18:18:72:540:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(MS) to illustrate potential differences  in time series and cross sectional pricing patterns.
23:816:48960:18:18:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:These two drug classes have received much policy attention, the former for providing truly
23:817:49050:18:17:72:540:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:new innovations through cures and the latter because of rapidly rising prices of the same
23:818:49139:17:18:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:product  over  time.   This  analysis  is  the  empirical  analogue  to  Figure  6,  which  illustrated
23:819:49242:18:18:72:540:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the theoretical possibility of prices falling or rising over time, depending on whether or not

23:824:49585:14:15:72:540:233:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:data are from two studies in the CEAR. For Sovaldi the prices come from Beasley (2015) and the the QALY
23:825:49688:15:14:72:540:218:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:is from a 2013 CEAR study.  For Harvoni, the QALY and initial price are from Zhang et al. (2015) and the
23:826:49792:14:35:72:313:204:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:2014 and 2015 price discounts are from Beasley (2015).
23:827:49846:35:18:89:539:169:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the case of hepatitis C, Figure 8 shows the price patterns for the different products
23:828:49934:18:18:72:540:151:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:over time, with the entry date defined as the start of the series.  Because the HCV drugs are
23:829:50027:18:17:72:540:133:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fairly new, there are relatively few observations in the CEAR data, so we supplement from
23:830:50116:17:18:72:540:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:other sources.  For Victrelis, CEAR has price and QALY estimates in 2012 and 2014, from
23:831:50203:18:18:72:540:98:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which  we  calculate  quality-adjusted  prices.   For  Sovaldi  we  use  the  company’s  prices  and
23:832:50303:18:0:72:540:80:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:announced discounts for 2014 and 2015 (Beasley, 2015), combined with the QALY estimate
24:833:50391:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from a 2013 CEAR study.  We get the QALY and initial price for Harvoni from Zhang et al.
24:834:50479:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(2015), which is the same type of study as the articles in CEAR, just published more recently.
24:835:50573:18:18:72:427:672:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:We again use the announced discounts to adjust the price over time.6
24:836:50641:18:18:89:539:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Sovaldi was the first innovation which offered a major increase in quality through essen-
24:837:50730:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tially  curing  HCV  through  a  3  month  treatment.   As  the  graph  indicates,  the  incumbent
24:838:50828:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Victrelis  dropped  its  price  dramatically  around  Solvaldi’s  entry.   Thus  even  though  com-
24:839:50927:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:paring their quality-adjusted prices in 2014, just after this entry occurred, would show the
24:840:51019:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:new  innovation  was  more  expensive,  there  was  a  substantial  decrease  in  quality-adjusted
24:841:51117:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prices.  The HCV case is illustrative of the more general idea that when therapeutic price

24:847:51556:32:18:89:539:125:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The price patterns for multiple sclerosis drugs show a very different story.  Figure 9 shows

24:850:51853:12:0:72:254:80:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:46% discount reported by Beasley (2015).
25:851:51895:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quality-adjusted prices for MS drugs over time.  These drugs have been around longer,  so
25:852:51984:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:there  are  more  observations  in  CEAR,  but  none  of  the  drugs  appear  yearly.   We  use  the
25:853:52084:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(average) QALY estimate from the CEAR and yearly prices from Hartung et al. (2015) to
25:854:52169:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:get yearly quality-adjusted prices.  If anything, the entry of Rebif in 2002 coincides with the
25:855:52264:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:incumbents  raising  prices  and  the prices  for all drugs are increasing  overtime.   Therefore,
25:856:52362:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the difference in quality-adjusted price between the new innovation Rebif and the incumbent

25:858:52525:18:18:89:539:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:There are three reasonas that MS treatments are less substitutable than treatments for
25:859:52611:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:some other diseases.  First, there is enormous heterogeneity in the MS population and treat-
25:860:52703:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ment response, so chemically-similar drugs may have very different outcomes for the same
25:861:52791:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:patient (Lucchinetti et al., 2000).  Second, MS is managed and not cured by treatments, so
25:862:52881:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:patients often need take a range of MS drugs over their course of therapy.  Third, there are
25:863:52973:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:significant differences across MS drugs in their efficacy, tolerability, and mode of administra-
25:864:53069:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tion.  For example, Avonex is an injection treatment that is often used a first line treatment
25:865:53163:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:because it has mild side effects though low efficacy.  Tysabri, which is administered through
25:866:53256:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:infusion, is often used as a later line treatment because it has high efficacy and potentially
25:867:53350:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:serious side effects (Smith et al., 2010).  Since the drugs are less good substitutes, they do
25:868:53444:18:18:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not compete as much, so new drugs are less likely to cause incumbents to lower their prices.
25:869:53536:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The MS case is illustrative of the more general idea that absent therapeutic price competi-
25:870:53627:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tion, prices for a given product may increase over time, so the cross sectional and time series
25:871:53722:18:32:72:277:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:differences may be mutually reinforcing.
25:872:53762:32:21:72:194:317:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:6    Conclusion
25:873:53777:21:18:89:539:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Using the medical cost effectiveness literature to compare quality-adjusted prices of inno-
25:874:53868:18:18:72:540:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:vators and incumbents, we found that two-thirds of innovators had a higher quality-adjusted
25:875:53959:18:18:72:540:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price than that of the incumbent; the median difference in quality-adjusted price was 4%.
25:876:54048:18:18:72:540:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:There are not systematic differences by disease type, though pharmaceuticals have somewhat
25:877:54138:18:18:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:larger  differences,  especially  in  recent  years.   There  is  some  evidence  that  an  innovator’s
25:878:54241:18:18:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quality-adjusted price is particularly likely to be high relative to that of the incumbent when
25:879:54336:18:18:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:there is a large difference in quality between the two.  Studies done in the European Union
25:880:54427:18:18:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the United States have somewhat smaller quality-adjusted price ratios than studies done
25:881:54518:18:17:72:540:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:elsewhere, but innovations still tend to be more expensive than the incumbent technologies.
25:882:54609:17:18:72:540:135:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We showed how prices may still fall over time, depending on the price trends of the incum-
25:883:54699:18:18:72:540:117:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bents:  a  price  decline  of  4%  between  a  product’s  entry  and  the  entry  of  the  subsequent
25:884:54800:18:18:72:540:99:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:innovation would be sufficient to generate a net decrease in quality-adjusted prices over time
25:885:54894:18:0:72:215:81:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the majority of products.
26:886:54924:0:18:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We  end  by  discussing  some  reasons  why  innovation  may  affect  quality-adjusted  prices
26:887:55018:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:differently in health care than in other industries, such as telecommunications, where next
26:888:55109:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:generation technologies often reduce quality-adjusted prices.  Health care innovations may
26:889:55199:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have fewer substitutes than those in other industries:  a “first in class” designation can give
26:890:55294:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a firm substantial market power, which may persist longer than in other industries because
26:891:55384:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  the  delay  of  new  entrants  due  to  the  FDA  approval  process.   Even  average  levels  of
26:892:55484:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:market  power  may  enable  innovators  to  capture  increased  consumer  value  for  treatments
26:893:55580:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with an increased price; in this case, unmeasured cost offsets and complementarity between
26:894:55670:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a treatment and income or the prevailing level of health can lead to price increases over time.
26:895:55765:18:18:89:539:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:If  a  new  innovation  is  only  one  component  of  the  full  set  of  costs  associated  with  a
26:896:55865:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:diagnosis, then its impact on the other episode costs – ‘cost offsets’ – may be an important
26:897:55957:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:part of the value of the innovation.  Drugs are usually a small fraction of the total episode
26:898:56050:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cost but may generate cost offsets by preventing future doctor or hospital visits.  If monopoly
26:899:56145:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:power allows the entrant to capture these cost offsets in a higher price for the innovation, then
26:900:56242:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the quality-adjusted price may seem higher if the cost savings are not measured (though true
26:901:56334:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:total costs per quality may be lower).  This explanation for larger quality-adjusted prices of
26:902:56428:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:innovators could be tested empirically if total costs and treatment costs could be separated,
26:903:56521:18:18:72:500:403:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:in which case cost offsets should have a positive effect on the innovator’s premium.7
26:904:56606:18:18:89:539:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Two  forms  of  health-related  complementarities  may  raise  quality-adjusted  prices  over
26:905:56699:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time.  One is the complementarity between health and more health care:  a greater level of
26:906:56789:18:18:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:health over time raises the value of additional health going forward.  For example, the value
26:907:56882:18:18:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of treating a life-threatening disease is larger the longer you live in absence of the disease.
26:908:56977:18:18:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:As discussed by Dow et al. (1999), such complementarities are implied by competing risks
26:909:57065:18:18:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:models of mortality, which essentially involve a Leontief production function of overall length
26:910:57160:18:18:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of lifetime from competing cause-specific lifetimes.  If a healthier population values health
26:911:57253:18:18:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:improvements  from  a  given  disease  more  and  this  can  be  priced  out  by  new  innovators,
26:912:57351:18:17:72:392:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quality-adjusted prices may rise with the baseline health level.
26:913:57415:17:18:89:539:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The  second  health  related  complementarity  is  between  health  and  consumption  (Hall
26:914:57506:18:18:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and Jones, 2007).  The willingness to pay for increased longevity rises with economic growth
26:915:57598:18:18:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:because  the  wealthier  one  is,  the  lower  is  the  utility  loss  from  foregoing  consumption  to
26:916:57701:18:18:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:extend  life.   Patent-protected  monopolies  may  be  able  to  extract  this  increased  value  of
26:917:57801:18:18:72:499:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:health and raise prices more and more for the same gains in health as incomes rise.
26:918:57884:18:18:89:539:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Another proposed explanation for increasing quality-adjusted prices in health care is the
26:919:57973:18:18:72:540:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fact  that  a  large  portion  of  care  is  paid  for  by  third-party  payers  –  either  public  or  pri-
26:920:58081:18:15:85:539:98:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f5:F:7The price variable that we use is the most inclusive one available, but non-health costs were recorded
26:921:58184:15:0:72:419:83:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:for only a fraction of the studies; they may not have captured all indirect costs.
27:922:58268:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:vate  –  so  demand  is  not  sensitive  to  price.   However,  this  is  more  of  an  explanation  for
27:923:58372:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:why  markups  in  health  care  may  be  high  than  for  why  they  would  be  increasing  (with-
27:924:58470:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:out an increase in health insurance coverage).  Others have argued that third-party payers
27:925:58560:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decrease  the  incentive  for  cost-reducing  innovations  (Weisbrod,  1991).   However,  patients
27:926:58658:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ultimately have to demand and pay the resulting higher premiums.  Moreover, third-party
27:927:58745:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:payers seem almost “hyper-rational” in their purchasing decisions in that they use the very
27:928:58836:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:same  cost-effectiveness  studies  analyzed  here.   In  very  few  other  industries  do  buyers  use
27:929:58938:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:explicit quantitative metrics like these to quantify the costs and quality of products before
27:930:59031:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:purchasing.   Though  reimbursement  by  payers  based  on  cost  effectiveness  is  less  institu-
27:931:59130:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tionalized in the more privately financed US market than in Europe,  the majority of cost
27:932:59219:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effectiveness studies are actually done for the US market and funded by US manufacturers
27:933:59307:18:18:72:433:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that would be unlikely to fund them unless they influenced US payers.
27:934:59376:18:18:89:539:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In summary, we believe that more systematic inquiry is needed on the impact of tech-
27:935:59460:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nological  change  on  quality-adjusted  prices  in  health  care.   The  central  debate  is  around
27:936:59561:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:whether increased spending is justified by larger health benefits.  We have argued that the
27:937:59652:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cost-effectiveness literature has implicitly analyzed such quality-adjusted prices over the last
27:938:59748:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:half century, but the analysis of quality adjusted prices by economists has not incorporated
27:939:59840:18:0:72:236:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this useful, systematic evidence.
