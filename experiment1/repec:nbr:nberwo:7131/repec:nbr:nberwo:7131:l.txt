2:34:1832:37:20:131:564:572:13:Times:13:Times:C:The regression discontinuity (RD) data design is a quasi-experimental design with the
2:35:1917:20:22:95:566:552:13:Times:13:Times:F:defining characteristic that the probability of receiving treatment changes discontinuously as a
2:36:2013:22:21:95:564:530:12:Times:12:Times:B:function of one or more individual characteristics. This data design occasionally arises in economic
2:37:2113:21:21:95:566:509:12:Times:12:Times:B:and other applications but is only infrequently exploited in evaluating the effects of a treatment. We
2:38:2215:21:22:95:565:488:12:Times:12:Times:B:consider the problem of identification and estimation of treatment effects under a RD data design.
2:39:2313:22:21:95:564:466:13:Times:13:Times:F:We offer an interpretation of the IV or so-called Wald estimator as a regression discontinuity
2:40:2407:21:21:95:567:445:12:Times:12:Times:B:estimator. We propose nonparametric estimators of treatment effects and present their asymptotic
2:41:2503:21:22:95:565:424:12:Times:12:Times:B:distribution theory. Then we apply the estimation method to evaluate the effect of EEOC-coverage

3:54:2988:0:31:97:211:709:20:Times:20:Times:C:1 Introduction
3:55:3002:31:17:97:568:678:12:Times:12:Times:B:Quasi-experimental methods, like the regression-discontinuity method, are only infrequently consid-
3:56:3101:17:18:97:567:661:12:Times:12:Times:B:ered in the evaluation literature as a separate method of evaluation. The focus is usually either on
3:57:3201:18:17:97:568:643:12:Times:12:Times:B:purely experimental or purely observational methods. Data generated by a regression-discontinuity
3:58:3298:17:18:96:568:626:13:Times:13:Times:F:design shares features with both experimental and observational data. In an experiment, treat-
3:59:3392:18:18:96:567:608:12:Times:12:Times:B:ment is assigned by a randomization device, which guarantees that persons in the treated group
3:60:3486:18:16:96:569:590:12:Times:12:Times:B:and in the control group are comparable. A regression-discontinuity (RD) design is similar to an
3:61:3582:16:18:96:567:574:13:Times:13:Times:F:experiment in that there is also a known rule that influences how persons are assigned to treat-
3:62:3678:18:17:96:568:556:12:Times:12:Times:B:ment. However, assignment to treatment is not random and persons who receive treatment may
3:63:3768:17:17:95:570:539:13:Times:13:Times:F:differ systematically from those who do not. In this sense, data from a RD design are similar to
3:64:3864:17:18:95:187:522:12:Times:12:Times:B:observational data.
3:65:3883:18:18:112:570:504:13:Times:13:Times:A:In one of the first applications of the RD method and the first paper to introduce the design,
3:66:3977:18:18:95:570:486:12:Times:12:Times:B:Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960) estimate the effect that receipt of a National Merit Award has
3:67:4074:18:17:95:568:468:12:Times:12:Times:B:on students' success in obtaining additional college scholarships and on their career aspirations.
3:68:4172:17:18:95:567:451:12:Times:12:Times:B:They observe that the awards are given on the basis of whether a test score exceeds a threshold, so
3:69:4271:18:17:95:566:433:12:Times:12:Times:B:one can take advantage of knowing the cut-off point to learn about treatment effects for persons near
3:70:4372:17:19:95:570:416:12:Times:12:Times:B:the cut-off. Berk and Rauma (1983) take a similar approach in analyzing the effect of extending
3:71:4467:19:17:95:568:397:12:Times:12:Times:B:unemployment benefits to released prisoners on recidivism rates, where benefits are given only to
3:72:4564:17:17:95:569:380:12:Times:12:Times:B:prisoners who worked a minimum number of hours while in prison. Van der Klaauw (1996) examines
3:73:4658:17:18:95:567:363:12:Times:12:Times:B:the effect that college scholarships awarded at the time of admission have on students' decisions
3:74:4755:18:18:95:567:345:12:Times:12:Times:B:to attend a particular college. He uses the fact that the value of an index based on a combination
3:75:4853:18:17:94:567:327:12:Times:12:Times:B:of the student's grade-point average and SAT score partly determines in a discontinuous manner
3:76:4947:17:18:94:569:310:12:Times:12:Times:B:whether a fellowship is awarded as well as the amount of fellowship. In another recent application,
3:77:5046:18:17:94:568:292:12:Times:12:Times:B:Angrist and Lavy (1996) estimate the effect of classroom size on student test scores. One of the
3:78:5142:17:18:94:567:275:13:Times:13:Times:F:factors determining class size in their data is a rule stipulating that another classroom be added
3:79:5240:18:19:94:566:257:12:Times:12:Times:B:whenever the average classroom size crosses a threshold level. Finally, Black (1996) uses an RD
3:80:5335:19:16:94:568:238:12:Times:12:Times:B:approach to estimate parents' willingness to pay for higher quality schools by comparing housing
3:81:5431:16:18:94:568:222:12:Times:12:Times:B:prices near geographic school attendance boundaries. In all these examples, the treatment variable
3:82:5529:18:18:94:566:204:12:Times:12:Times:B:changes discontinuously as a function of one or more underlying variables, which is the defining
3:83:5625:18:19:94:354:186:12:Times:12:Times:B:characteristic of regression discontinuity data designs.
3:84:5681:19:16:111:569:167:12:Times:12:Times:A:Although there have already been many applications of RD methods, important questions still
3:85:5772:16:18:93:568:151:12:Times:12:Times:B:remain concerning sources of identification and ways of estimating treatment effects under minimal
3:86:5870:18:17:93:567:133:12:Times:12:Times:B:parametric restrictions. Trochim (1984) discusses alternative parametric and semiparametric RD
3:87:5964:17:21:93:568:116:12:Times:12:Times:B:estimators that have been proposed in the statistics literature.' Van der Klaauw (1996) considers
3:88:6061:21:36:106:486:95:10:Times:10:Times:A:'Trochim (1984) also discusses several applications of these methods in educational research.

4:91:6251:18:17:99:570:693:12:Times:12:Times:B:tion. In this paper, we consider the more general case which allows for variable treatment effects.
4:92:6350:17:18:99:572:676:12:Times:12:Times:B:We demonstrate that treatment effects are typically nonparametrically unidentified in regression
4:93:6446:18:17:99:569:658:12:Times:12:Times:B:discontinuity models but that a weak form of identification can be achieved through a functional
4:94:6542:17:18:99:572:641:12:Times:12:Times:B:form restriction. The restriction is unusual in that it requires imposing continuity assumptions in
4:95:6641:18:18:98:572:623:12:Times:12:Times:B:order to take advantage of the known discontinuity in the treatment assignment mechanism.2 We
4:96:6734:18:18:98:535:605:12:Times:12:Times:B:propose two estimators and apply these to evaluate the effect of an antidiscrimination law.
4:97:6825:18:17:115:572:587:12:Times:12:Times:A:The paper develops as follows. Section 2 discusses the model, the parameters of interest, and
4:98:6918:17:17:98:571:570:12:Times:12:Times:B:different types of RD designs. Sections 3 considers alternative sources of identifying information.
4:99:7017:17:18:98:572:553:13:Times:13:Times:C:Section 4 proposes consistent estimators and provides the distribution theory. This section also
4:100:7113:18:17:98:572:535:13:Times:13:Times:C:draws a comparison between IV estimators and RD estimators by observing that under certain
4:101:7203:17:18:98:571:518:12:Times:12:Times:B:conditions a kernel-based RD estimator is numerically equivalent to a standard IV estimator. Sec-
4:102:7300:18:19:98:570:500:12:Times:12:Times:B:tion 5 applies the methods to study the relationship between firm size and minority employment
4:103:7394:19:16:98:571:481:13:Times:13:Times:F:patterns using data from the NLSY (National Longitudinal Survey of Youth). In the U.S., only
4:104:7486:16:18:98:571:465:12:Times:12:Times:B:firms with 15 or more employees are subject to federal antidiscrimination laws.3 We can therefore
4:105:7583:18:18:97:571:447:12:Times:12:Times:B:exploit the discontinuity of this rule to analyze whether smaller firms that are not subject to these
4:106:7684:18:19:97:573:429:12:Times:12:Times:B:regulations tend to hire smaller proportions of minority workers. Section 6 summarizes our main
4:107:7779:19:39:97:137:410:11:Times:11:Times:F:findings.
4:108:7788:39:27:97:386:371:18:Times:18:Times:C:2 The Regression-Discontinuity Design
4:109:7825:27:18:97:573:344:13:Times:13:Times:C:The goal of an evaluation is to determine the effect that some binary treatment variable x has
4:110:7919:18:18:97:570:326:12:Times:12:Times:B:on an outcome y1. The evaluation problem arises because persons either receive or do not receive
4:111:8015:18:17:97:572:308:12:Times:12:Times:B:treatment and no individual is observed in both states at the same time. Let Yli denote the outcome
4:112:8114:17:16:96:569:291:12:Times:12:Times:B:with treatment and YOi that in the absence of treatment, and let x =1if treatment is received and
4:113:8211:16:34:109:449:275:16:Times:12:Times:A:=0otherwise. The model for the observed outcome can be written as
4:114:8276:34:25:555:568:241:11:Times:11:Times:F:(1)
4:115:8279:25:17:96:570:216:12:Times:13:Times:B:where a1yçjj,Yiz —YOi.The entire distribution of treatment impacts may be of interest
4:116:8364:17:18:96:568:199:13:Times:12:Times:B:in an evaluation, but because a2 is not observed for any x2 =1person it may only be possible
4:117:8456:18:18:96:569:181:13:Times:13:Times:F:to reliably estimate limited aspects of the impact distribution. Two parameters of interest that
4:118:8552:18:19:96:570:163:12:Times:12:Times:B:receive much attention in the evaluation literature are the mean effect of treatment on the treated
4:119:8651:19:19:142:568:144:12:Times:14:Times:A:E [31x=1]and the mean effect of treatment on randomly assigned individual=
4:120:8725:19:14:108:571:125:10:Helvetica:10:Times:F:2Whileour approach is unusual in its reliance on a continuity assumption for identification, the type of assumption
4:121:8840:14:12:95:365:111:10:Times:10:Times:F:we make is commonly invoked under other estimation approaches.

5:125:9019:19:17:113:566:690:12:Times:12:Times:A:If the data are purely observational, then little may be known a priori about the selection into
5:126:9115:17:18:96:567:673:13:Times:13:Times:F:treatment process. With data from a RD design, the analyst has some information about the
5:127:9204:18:16:96:569:655:12:Times:12:Times:B:treatment assignment mechanism. There are two main types of discontinuity designs considered in
5:128:9299:16:19:96:566:639:13:Times:12:Times:B:the literature -thesharp design and the so-called fuzzy design (see e.g. Trochim, 1984). With a
5:129:9394:19:18:96:566:620:12:Times:12:Times:B:sharp design, treatment x is known to depend in a deterministic way on some observable variable
5:130:9489:18:17:96:567:602:16:Times:12:Times:B:z, x =f(z), where z takes on a continuum of values and the point z0 where the function f (z) is
5:131:9584:17:19:96:570:585:12:Times:12:Times:B:discontinuous is assumed to be known. In the empirical work of section 6, we consider data from
5:132:9679:19:17:96:168:566:12:Times:12:Times:B:a sharp design.
5:133:9694:17:17:113:555:549:12:Times:12:Times:A:With a fuzzy design, x2 is a random variable given z, but the conditional probability f (z)
5:134:9785:17:17:95:568:532:14:Times:13:Times:F:E [xI z =z]=Pr[x =1z =z]is known to be discontinuous at zo. For example, in the ap-
5:135:9868:17:17:95:568:515:12:Times:12:Times:B:plication of Van der Klaauw (1996), the probability that a student receives financial aid changes
5:136:9965:17:18:95:567:498:12:Times:12:Times:B:discontinuously as a function of a known index of the student's CPA and SAT scores. However,
5:137:10057:18:17:95:570:480:12:Times:12:Times:B:there are other factors, some of which are unobserved, which affect the financial aid decision, so
5:138:10155:17:19:95:330:463:12:Times:12:Times:B:the data fits a fuzzy rather than a sharp design.5
5:139:10205:19:17:112:567:444:12:Times:12:Times:A:Next we consider formally why knowing that the probability of receiving treatment changes dis-

5:142:10427:29:26:95:206:359:13:Times:15:Times:C:3.1SharpDesign
5:143:10441:26:16:94:566:333:12:Times:12:Times:B:To simplify the exposition of ideas, consider the special case of a simple sharp discontinuity design.
5:144:10543:16:25:94:438:317:12:Times:12:Times:B:Treatment is assigned based on whether zj crosses a threshold value z0:
5:145:10614:25:21:304:367:292:14:Times:12:Times:C:=1if z > zO
5:146:10625:21:28:304:370:271:14:Times:12:Times:C:=0if z2 <z0.
5:147:10637:28:17:94:569:243:12:Times:12:Times:B:As z may be correlated with the outcome variable, the assignment mechanism is clearly not random
5:148:10733:17:18:94:567:226:12:Times:12:Times:B:and a comparison of outcomes between persons who received and did not receive treatment will
5:149:10825:18:18:94:570:208:12:Times:12:Times:B:generally be a biased estimator of treatment impacts.° However, we may have reason to believe that
5:150:10923:18:18:94:568:190:12:Times:12:Times:B:persons close to the threshold z0 are similar. If so, we may view the design as almost experimental
5:151:11022:18:20:94:131:172:14:Times:14:Times:C:near z.
5:152:11029:20:10:106:520:152:10:Times:10:Times:A:4See, e.g.,Peters(1941), Belson (1956), Rosenbaum and Rubin (1985) or Beckman and Robb (1985).
5:153:11123:10:14:106:567:142:10:Times:10:Times:F:5The model of Angrist and Lavy (1996) also falls under the fuzzy design. Both Angrist and Lavy, and Van der
5:154:11230:14:14:93:567:128:10:Times:10:Times:F:Klaauw (1996) analyze the case of multiple treatment dose levels, which can be viewed as an extension of the uniform
5:155:11346:14:12:93:177:114:10:Times:10:Times:F:treatment dose case.
5:156:11366:12:14:106:569:102:11:Times:10:Times:F:5Note that, as zisassumed to be observed, assignment in the sharp RD design is a special case of selection on
5:157:11475:14:29:93:142:88:10:Times:10:Times:F:observables.

6:159:11488:0:17:115:569:708:13:Times:13:Times:A:To make this argument rigorous, let e> 0denote an arbitrary small number. Comparing
6:160:11571:17:29:97:480:691:12:Times:12:Times:B:conditional means for persons who received and did not receive treatment gives

6:164:11825:17:27:98:344:600:11:Helvetica:12:Times:B:Thisintuition motivates the following assumptions:

6:167:12002:25:28:98:359:523:12:Times:12:Times:B:Under Conditions (Cl) and (C2), it is easy to see that
6:168:12056:28:22:199:568:495:16:Times:11:Times:F:lim {E[yz =zo+e] —E[yz =zo—e]}=E[flIzoI.(2)
6:169:12099:22:19:98:569:473:12:Times:12:Times:B:By comparing persons arbitrarily close to the point z0 who did and did not receive treatment, we
6:170:12195:19:16:98:569:454:12:Times:12:Times:B:can in the limit identify E [/1j1 z =zo].Without further assumptions such as the "common effect"
6:171:12291:16:19:98:569:438:12:Times:12:Times:B:assumption, treatment effects can only be identified at z =z0.8Conditions (Cl) and (C2) are all
6:172:12386:19:17:97:259:419:12:Times:12:Times:B:that is required for identification.
6:173:12422:17:17:115:570:402:12:Times:12:Times:A:It is a limitation of a RD design that we can only learn about treatment effects for persons with
6:174:12519:17:18:98:572:385:12:Times:12:Times:B:z values near the point of discontinuity. An advantage of randomized data is that randomization
6:175:12614:18:17:98:572:367:13:Times:13:Times:C:identifies treatment impacts over the full support of z. With data from a RD design, treatment
6:176:12708:17:19:98:570:350:12:Times:12:Times:B:effects can only be identified over a wider range of the support of z by increasing the number of
6:177:12805:19:17:98:569:331:12:Times:12:Times:B:discontinuity points. As the number of points approaches infinity, a discontinuity design approxi-
6:178:12903:17:18:98:573:314:12:Times:12:Times:B:mates the conditions of a randomized experiment.9 If treatment effects were locally constant, say
6:179:13000:18:17:98:572:296:12:Times:12:Times:B:within quintiles of z, then a RD design with a fixed number of discontinuity points would allow
6:180:13095:17:18:98:570:279:12:Times:12:Times:B:identification of the range of treatment impacts. Multiple discontinuity points also allow a test of
6:181:13195:18:35:98:249:261:12:Times:12:Times:B:the common effect assumption.
6:182:13224:35:22:98:209:226:16:Times:16:Times:C:3.2 Fuzzy Design
6:183:13240:22:18:98:573:204:13:Times:13:Times:C:The fuzzy design differs from the sharp design in that the treatment assignment is not a deter-
6:184:13335:18:19:98:571:186:12:Times:12:Times:B:ministic function of z; there are additional variables which are unobserved by the evaluator that
6:185:13432:19:12:111:553:167:11:Times:10:Times:A:7Throughout this paper, we also assume that the density of zispositive in the neighborhood containing zO.
6:186:13537:12:14:111:571:155:9:Helvetica:10:Times:F:8Thisnotion of identification is similar to the "identification at infinity" idea put forth in Heckman (1990), although
6:187:13656:14:14:98:571:141:11:Times:10:Times:F:it differs from his case in that we do not require that zhassupport over the whole real line. Because of the local
6:188:13770:14:15:98:572:127:10:Times:10:Times:F:nature of our source of identification, the semiparametric information bound is by definition zero: a root-n estimator
6:189:13888:15:11:98:150:112:10:Times:10:Times:F:cannot exist.
6:190:13901:11:15:111:574:101:11:Times:11:Times:A:9The number of points has to go to infinity in such a way that the limit densely covers the range of values of z
6:191:14013:15:27:98:292:86:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:F:forwhich the treatment effect is of interest.

7:197:14362:30:24:97:289:623:14:Times:14:Times:C:3.2.1 Common Treatment Effects
7:198:14392:24:18:97:568:599:12:Times:12:Times:B:Suppose that the treatment effect is constant across different individuals. Write 3 for the common
7:199:14490:18:28:96:552:581:12:Times:12:Times:B:value. The mean difference in outcomes for persons above and below the discontinuity point is
7:200:14583:28:24:128:536:553:48:Times:14:Helvetica:C:.{E{xjz=z0 +e]— E[xjlzj = z0 — e]} +E[cjIzj= z0 +e] —E[Iz = z0 — e].
7:201:14651:24:27:96:197:529:11:Helvetica:12:Times:B:Under(Cl), we have
7:202:14669:27:26:102:565:502:15:Times:14:Helvetica:A:lim {E[yIz=zo+e]—E[yIz =zo—e]}3. lim{E[xjIz=zo+e] —E[xIz =zo—e]}.
7:203:14734:26:20:96:227:476:11:Helvetica:12:Times:B:Thus,we can identify /3 by

7:206:14849:20:18:96:567:423:12:Times:11:Times:B:The denominator is nonzero because the fuzzy RD design ensures that Pr [x. =izj= zis discon-
7:207:14941:18:32:96:161:405:12:Times:12:Times:B:tinuous at zO.
7:208:14955:32:24:96:285:373:14:Times:14:Times:C:3.2.2 Variable Treatment Effects
7:209:14987:24:19:96:570:349:12:Times:12:Times:B:Now consider the question of identification when treatment effects are heterogeneous. To identify
7:210:15084:19:16:96:569:330:13:Times:13:Times:F:E [j31 z =zo]using the same strategy as in the constant treatment effect case, we assume that
7:211:15177:16:18:96:569:314:12:Times:12:Times:B:conditional on z the other variables affecting whether a person receives treatment are independent
7:212:15275:18:28:96:207:296:12:Times:12:Times:B:of the treatment effect:
7:213:15299:28:26:100:482:268:13:Times:13:Times:C:Condition (C3) x is independent of 13 conditional on z, near z0: x I /3 z.
7:214:15373:26:18:96:570:242:12:Times:12:Times:B:Although (C3) allows for more generality than the common treatment impact assumption, it still
7:215:15467:18:18:96:571:224:12:Times:12:Times:B:restricts the form of the heterogeneity in a way that may not be acceptable in application.1' On the
7:216:15567:18:17:96:569:206:12:Times:12:Times:B:other hand, the condition is slightly weaker than the conditional ignorability assumption commonly
7:217:15665:17:19:96:569:189:12:Times:12:Times:B:invoked in the statistics literature on matching (e.g. Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983) in that we do
7:218:15760:19:17:96:413:170:12:Times:12:Times:B:not require that YOi and Yli are conditionally independent of x.'2
7:219:15826:17:16:105:569:153:10:Times:10:Times:F:'°This probability is often referred to as the propensity score in the statistics literature. See e.g., Rosenbaum and
7:220:15943:16:10:96:152:137:10:Times:10:Times:F:Rubin (1983).
7:221:15956:10:15:105:571:127:10:Times:10:Times:F:"Condition (03) maintains that individuals do not select into treatment on the basis of anticipated gains from the
7:222:16070:15:12:96:398:112:10:Times:10:Times:F:treatment, an assumption that is criticized in Heckrnan and Smith (1997).
7:223:16143:12:15:105:572:100:11:Times:11:Times:A:'2To some extent, this technicality is substantive. For example, the common effect model satisfies (03) trivially
7:224:16256:15:28:96:279:85:10:Times:10:Times:F:but not necessarily the stronger assumption.
7:225:16300:28:0:330:335:57:10:Times:10:Times:?:5
8:226:16301:0:31:115:250:710:12:Times:12:Times:A:Condition (C3) implies that
8:227:16328:31:25:193:471:679:16:Times:13:Helvetica:C:E[x .I3Iz= z±e]=E[/3Iz = z±eI E[xI zi=z±e}
8:228:16370:25:32:97:298:654:12:Times:12:Times:B:Combined with (Cl) and (C2), we obtain
8:229:16408:32:24:113:324:622:11:Times:11:Helvetica:A:urn{E{yj z z0 + e] —E[yj z =z0—e]}

8:231:16489:30:17:97:353:568:12:Times:12:Times:B:We can therefore again identify E [/3j z =zo]by (3).
8:232:16541:17:18:114:571:551:12:Times:12:Times:A:To examine the consequence of dropping (C3), we examine an alternative case that is sometimes
8:233:16634:18:18:97:571:533:13:Times:13:Times:F:considered in the evaluation literature. Suppose, as in Imbens and Angrist (1994) or Angrist,
8:234:16727:18:17:97:570:515:13:Times:13:Times:F:Imbens, and Rubin (1994), that for each observation i, treatment assignment is a deterministic
8:235:16821:17:18:97:571:498:13:Times:13:Times:F:function of z, but that the function is different for different persons or groups of persons. For
8:236:16918:18:17:97:568:480:12:Times:12:Times:B:example, consider the case where college fellowships are awarded on the basis of SAT scores, but
8:237:17014:17:18:96:570:463:12:Times:12:Times:B:the threshold cutoffs for awarding fellowships are different for different ethnic groups. If the analyst
8:238:17118:18:17:96:571:445:13:Times:13:Times:F:does not have this information, the assignment mechanism may appear to be random. Consider
8:239:17208:17:32:96:439:428:12:Times:12:Times:B:the following set of assumptions on impacts and treatment assignment:
8:240:17277:32:26:102:341:396:12:Times:13:Times:A:(i)x (z)) is jointly independent of z near z0.
8:241:17323:26:28:102:364:370:12:Times:11:Times:A:(ii) x (zo + e) - x (zcj —e)for e >0sufficiently small.
8:242:17378:28:32:96:407:342:12:Times:12:Times:B:Invoking the reasoning in Imbens and Angrist (1994), we obtain
8:243:17440:32:16:96:313:310:14:Times:12:Helvetica:C:E[x .13.Iz=zo+e]—E[xi3Iz=zo—e]

9:257:18114:25:18:96:569:686:12:Times:12:Times:B:In all the above examples, we have shown how identification of treatment effects can be achieved
9:258:18210:18:17:96:568:668:13:Times:13:Times:F:through a local continuity restriction on E [au z,J and a known discontinuity in E [x z,]. In
9:259:18303:17:18:96:567:651:13:Times:13:Times:F:this section, we show that these restrictions are necessary and that without them the model is
9:260:18397:18:19:96:569:633:12:Times:12:Times:B:nonparametrically unidentified. We can put the model for outcomes in more familiar econometric
9:261:18491:19:29:96:190:614:12:Times:12:Times:B:notation by writing
9:262:18510:29:26:277:385:585:17:Times:17:Times:C:y =a(zu)+8.xj+v
9:263:18525:26:17:96:567:559:13:Times:13:Times:F:where a, is a function of the zj variable and of some other unobservables v, a, =a(z)+ v, and
9:264:18618:17:27:96:380:542:14:Times:12:Times:B:a (z) =E[au z,].'3 The selection model can be written as
9:265:18674:27:21:289:387:515:14:Times:16:Times:C:=1if f(z) +u >0
9:266:18689:21:30:289:329:494:14:Times:11:Times:?:=0else.
9:267:18696:30:18:95:567:464:13:Times:12:Times:B:We argue that the usual conditional mean independence restriction, E [v z] =0,is not sufficient
9:268:18791:18:17:95:568:446:13:Times:13:Times:F:for identification of the treatment effect, even for the common treatment effect case. For this
9:269:18886:17:31:95:321:429:12:Times:12:Times:B:purpose consider another DGP, where we have
9:270:18929:31:27:273:390:398:17:Times:17:Times:C:y =a*(zj)+0.xi+v,

9:273:19000:26:17:95:569:314:12:Times:12:Times:B:These two models are equivalent except that the treatment effect in the former case is 3 whereas in

9:276:19233:18:18:112:566:261:13:Times:13:Times:A:There are different types of restrictions that can be imposed to overcome this problem. If it
9:277:19326:18:17:95:568:243:13:Times:12:Times:B:is known that E [au z is continuous at a point zo but E [xIz}is discontinuous, then the models
9:278:19420:17:18:95:570:226:13:Times:13:Times:F:can be distinguished (a (z) is continuous but a* (z) is not). This is the strategy followed here.
9:279:19517:18:16:95:570:208:12:Times:12:Times:B:Alternative strategies not considered here could be based on standard types of exclusion restrictions

9:281:19709:19:17:95:569:173:12:Times:12:Times:B:would depend on the excluded variable whereas v would not.14 Still another possibility is to impose

10:289:20215:29:18:97:570:680:12:Times:12:Times:B:An estimation approach that has been adopted in the literature for the sharp design is to assume
10:290:20311:18:17:98:567:662:12:Times:13:Times:B:(in addition to continuity) a flexible parametric specification for g(z) =E [I z2]and add this as
10:291:20408:17:18:97:569:645:13:Times:13:Times:F:a 'control function' to the regression of y2 on x. Van der Klaauw (1996), for example, assumes
10:292:20502:18:17:97:568:627:12:Times:12:Times:B:the functional form of g to belong to the class of polynomial functions. For the fuzzy design he
10:293:20598:17:17:97:569:610:12:Times:12:Times:B:proposes a similar approach but where x in the control function-augmented regression equation
10:294:20691:17:18:97:567:593:13:Times:13:Times:F:is now replaced by a first stage estimate of E[xjz]. Although this would result in a consistent
10:295:20786:18:18:97:570:575:13:Times:13:Times:F:estimator of /3 under correct specification, it may be more fragile to misspecification. For this
10:296:20883:18:18:97:442:557:12:Times:12:Times:B:reason, we consider a more robust nonparametric strategy based on (3).
10:297:20953:18:17:114:567:539:13:Times:16:Helvetica:A:For both the sharp design and fuzzy design, (3) identifies the treatment effect at z =z.
10:298:21041:17:18:97:568:522:12:Times:12:Times:B:Thus, given consistent estimators of the four one-sided limits in (3), the treatment effect can be
10:299:21139:18:17:96:569:504:12:Times:12:Times:B:consistently estimated. In principle, we can use any nonparametric estimator to estimate the limits.
10:300:21239:17:18:96:568:487:12:Times:12:Times:B:We first consider one-sided kernel estimation and observe that under certain conditions an estimate
10:301:21338:18:18:96:572:469:12:Times:12:Times:B:based on kernel regression will be numerically equivalent to a standard Wald estimator. We then
10:302:21433:18:19:96:572:451:12:Times:12:Times:B:argue that such an estimator may have a poor finite sample property due to the boundary problem
10:303:21528:19:16:96:568:432:12:Times:12:Times:B:and propose to avoid the boundary problem by using local linear nonparametric regression (LLR)
10:304:21622:16:19:96:571:416:13:Times:13:Times:F:methods. We describe the asymptotic distribution theory for the estimator of (3) based on local

11:347:23200:17:18:95:569:386:13:Times:13:Times:F:the standard IV assumption that the instrument is uncorrelated with the error term is violated.
11:348:23295:18:27:95:463:368:12:Times:12:Times:B:To see this, put the model in more familiar econometric notation by writing
11:349:23370:27:30:285:391:341:14:Times:14:Times:C:=E[aj]+va+Vj.
11:350:23383:30:27:95:516:311:12:Times:12:Times:B:Under the common treatment assumption, this yields a model for outcomes of the form
11:351:23466:27:30:297:377:284:14:Times:14:Times:C:=a+ x2 ./3+ v.
11:352:23480:30:18:95:567:254:13:Times:13:Times:F:Identification of /3 does not require that the error term v be uncorrelated with z. All that is
11:353:23575:18:18:95:570:236:13:Times:13:Times:F:required is smoothness conditions Cl and C2. As long as the researcher is willing to change the
11:354:23670:18:18:95:567:218:12:Times:12:Times:B:bandwidths appropriately as a function of the sample size,is consistent. Thus the local Wald
11:355:23762:18:18:95:568:200:12:Times:12:Times:B:estimator is motivated by a different principle than is the usual Wald estimator, but for a particular
11:356:23864:18:33:95:401:182:12:Times:12:Times:B:choice of kernel and subsample they are numerically equivalent.

11:360:24136:17:30:95:568:90:12:Times:12:Times:B:nonparametric-regression-based estimators, whereas the Wald estimator itself is asymptotically
11:361:24230:30:0:329:335:60:12:Times:12:Times:C:9
12:362:24231:0:18:98:571:711:13:Times:13:Times:F:unbiased. The bias problem is exacerbated in the regression-discontinuity case due to the bad
12:363:24324:18:17:98:569:693:12:Times:12:Times:B:boundary behavior of the kernel regression estimator: at boundary points, the bias of the kernel
12:364:24420:17:18:98:571:676:12:Times:12:Times:B:regression estimator converges to zero at a slower rate than at interior points. The boundary bias
12:365:24518:18:17:98:571:658:12:Times:12:Times:B:problem arises because the kernel weighting becomes asymmetric near boundary points where there
12:366:24613:17:18:98:458:641:12:Times:12:Times:B:is only a one-sided interval over which to carry out the local averaging.1617
12:367:24690:18:19:115:570:623:12:Times:12:Times:A:For our problem, all the points of estimation are at boundaries. The bias could be substantial in
12:368:24787:19:16:98:569:604:12:Times:12:Times:B:finite samples, especially when the conditional expectations E [y z] and/or E [x z] have nonzero

12:386:26123:14:15:96:570:271:11:Times:11:Times:F:kernel function, the order of the bias of the standard kernel estimator is O(h) at boundary points and O(h) at
12:387:26233:15:14:97:569:256:10:Times:10:Times:F:interior points, where n is the sample size and h, is a bandwidth sequence that goes to 0 as n gets large. See H.rd1e
12:388:26350:14:12:97:457:242:10:Times:10:Times:F:(1990) or Härdle and Linton (1994) for further discussion of the boundary bias problem.
12:389:26437:12:15:106:573:230:10:Times:10:Times:A:7Porter (1998) recently proposed an alternative estimator for the sharp discontinuity design, common effect model
12:390:26550:15:14:96:571:215:11:Times:11:Times:F:for which the boundary bias problem does not exist. The estimator invokes slightly stronger regularity conditions
12:391:26663:14:11:96:138:201:11:Times:11:Times:F:than ours.
12:392:26673:11:17:106:571:190:11:Times:11:Times:F:15The boundary bias formula of the kernel estimator reveals that the bias is the smallest when the conditional

12:394:26895:12:14:96:570:161:10:Times:10:Times:F:score is approximately constant on either side of ZO,andc (z) is constant near zo. We thus obtain the not-so-surprising
12:395:27014:14:15:97:570:147:11:Times:11:Times:F:conclusion that the local Wald estimator has a small bias only for the case where a has no correlation with z, i.e.,
12:396:27130:15:12:97:542:132:10:Times:10:Times:F:the case where z is a proper instrument and the Wald assumption is exactly satisfied near the discontinuity.

13:405:27913:18:17:96:569:641:12:Times:12:Times:B:problem without any disadvantage.2' The smaller bias associated with the LLR estimator implies
13:406:28007:17:18:96:567:624:13:Times:13:Times:F:that it is more rate-efficient than the kernel-based estimator. Another advantage of odd-order
13:407:28101:18:17:95:566:606:12:Times:12:Times:B:estimators emphasized by Fan is that the bias does not depend on the design density of the data.

13:426:29281:20:14:104:570:185:10:Times:10:Times:F:2tThe advantage stems from the fact that local linear regression imposes an orthogonality condition between the
13:427:29392:14:12:95:456:171:10:Times:10:Times:F:regressors and the residuals that is not imposed under kernel regression. See Fan (1992).
13:428:29481:12:14:104:567:159:10:Times:10:Times:F:220ne case where they would not be a better choice is if the function being estimated cannot be assumed to have
13:429:29592:14:15:95:567:145:10:Times:10:Times:F:a first derivative, in which case the kernel regression estimator is feasible but the local linear estimator is not. For
13:430:29712:15:14:95:568:130:10:Times:10:Times:F:most well-behaved functions, a polynomial of degree one suffices for local estimation. For a highly variable function
13:431:29829:14:16:95:569:116:10:Times:10:Times:F:a higher order polynomial regression, like local cubic regression, may provide a better fit. (See Fan (1996) for further

15:494:32215:18:17:93:564:209:12:Times:12:Times:B:law on firm employment of minority workers. We use the fact that by U.S. law, firms with at least
15:495:32312:17:17:94:567:192:12:Times:12:Times:B:15 employees are covered by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and by the 1972 amendment

16:503:32963:0:17:97:570:711:12:Times:12:Times:B:consensus on this question probably stems in part from the difficulty of assessing the impact of laws
16:504:33064:17:19:97:567:694:12:Times:12:Times:B:that have near universal coverage. Two broad schools of thought have emerged from the literature.
16:505:33161:19:16:97:570:675:12:Times:12:Times:B:One emphasizes the importance of long-term secular trends in education, educational quality and
16:506:33256:16:20:97:566:659:12:Times:11:Times:B:migration as the predominant sources of black economic progress.(See e.g.Smithand Welch, 1986)
16:507:33350:20:17:97:567:639:12:Times:12:Times:B:The other assigns a greater role to government policies. (See e.g.Donohueand Heckman, 1991,
16:508:33441:17:17:97:501:622:12:Times:12:Times:B:Heckman and Payner, 1989, Chay, 1995, and Carrington, McCue, and Pierce, 1995.)
16:509:33520:17:17:114:568:605:12:Times:12:Times:A:Many of the existing empirical studies identify the effects of discrimination laws either through
16:510:33617:17:17:97:567:588:12:Times:12:Times:B:a "before-after" or a "difference-in-difference" approach. For example, some studies establish a re-
16:511:33717:17:19:97:568:571:12:Times:12:Times:B:lationship between the timing of the introduction of a law and the timing of changes in employment
16:512:33815:19:17:97:571:552:12:Times:12:Times:B:practices. A potential problem with this kind of approach is that of disentangling the effect of legis-
16:513:33918:17:17:96:567:535:12:Times:12:Times:B:lation from other year effects and demographic trends. When data are available on a control group
16:514:34015:17:19:96:567:518:12:Times:12:Times:B:that is not subject to the law, then it is possible to control for time effects though a difference-in-
16:515:34118:19:17:96:570:499:12:Times:12:Times:B:difference approach. However, the validity of a difference-in-differences strategy depends crucially
16:516:34218:17:17:96:570:482:12:Times:12:Times:B:on whether the experiences of the control group accurately represent how the treated group (the
16:517:34313:17:17:96:534:465:12:Times:12:Times:B:group subject to the law change) would have fared in the absence of the legal intervention.
16:518:34404:17:19:113:569:448:13:Times:13:Times:A:A recent study that examines a question of interest similar to ours using a difference-in-
16:519:34494:19:17:96:570:429:12:Times:12:Times:B:differences approach is that of Chay (1995). Chay analyzes the impact of the 1972 Amendment to
16:520:34588:17:18:96:569:412:12:Times:12:Times:B:the Civil Rights Act on minority employment and earnings outcomes in firms that were affected
16:521:34681:18:17:96:571:394:12:Times:12:Times:B:by the change in coverage (firms with 15-24 employees). Chay uses variation across industries in
16:522:34777:17:18:95:567:377:12:Times:12:Times:B:the fraction of employees in small establishments and across states in the employer coverage of Fair
16:523:34877:18:17:95:570:359:12:Times:12:Times:B:Employment Practice (FEP) laws to define treatment and control groups.25 Changes over time in
16:524:34970:17:18:95:569:342:12:Times:12:Times:B:employment and earnings outcomes are then compared in the treatment and control groups. Chay's
16:525:35064:18:17:95:566:324:12:Times:12:Times:B:study concludes that the change in the law led to annual increases in the percentage of black em-
16:526:35161:17:18:95:571:307:13:Times:13:Times:F:ployment in small firms of about 0.5 percentage points, resulting in an accumulated increase of
16:527:35256:18:18:95:385:289:12:Times:12:Times:B:about 3.5 percentage points in the 1980 employment shares.
16:528:35314:18:17:112:566:271:12:Times:12:Times:A:Another related study is that of Carrington, McCue, and Pierce (1995), which examines whether
16:529:35407:17:18:95:567:254:12:Times:12:Times:B:the introduction of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and of affirmative action led to a migration

16:531:35599:18:17:95:571:218:12:Times:12:Times:B:covered under the Act. Their study finds evidence that such migration did occur, leading over 10
16:532:35695:17:18:95:517:201:12:Times:12:Times:B:years to substantial changes in employment patterns in small and large establishments.

16:535:35982:14:14:95:569:149:10:Times:10:Times:F:be distinguished from those working in establishment with 15-24 employees, he simply compares small firms (defined
16:536:36096:14:14:95:567:135:11:Times:11:Times:F:as those with less than 25 employees) with larger firms. While most states in the South did not have FEP laws at
16:537:36208:14:15:95:569:121:10:Times:10:Times:F:the time of the 1972 Amendment, so that firms with less than 25 employees were not covered by any law before 1972,
16:538:36322:15:45:95:520:106:10:Times:10:Times:F:most other states already had FEP laws in place covering firms smaller than those subject to Title VII.

17:541:36523:19:16:98:570:692:12:Times:12:Times:B:Like Chay (1995) and Carrington, McCue, and Pierce (1995) we exploit variation in employment
17:542:36615:16:18:97:567:676:12:Times:12:Times:B:between employers covered and not covered by the law as determined by their number of employees.
17:543:36711:18:18:98:569:658:12:Times:12:Times:B:However, we use only cross-sectional variation. Because the law applies discontinuously as a function
17:544:36812:18:17:97:570:640:12:Times:12:Times:B:of firm size, an RD approach provides a straightforward way of evaluating the effect that coverage
17:545:36910:17:17:97:568:623:12:Times:12:Times:B:under the law has on minority employment. There are several advantages of using an RD estimator
17:546:37005:17:18:97:568:606:12:Times:12:Times:B:instead of a more traditional evaluation estimator. It can be justified under very weak assumptions
17:547:37104:18:32:97:539:588:12:Times:12:Times:B:and it bypasses many questions concerning model specification, as we discuss further below.
17:548:37195:32:25:98:276:556:16:Times:16:Times:C:3.1 The Model and the Data
17:549:37221:25:19:97:570:531:13:Times:13:Times:F:We obtain data on individuals and the sizes of the firms at which they work from the National
17:550:37314:19:17:97:570:512:12:Times:12:Times:B:Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY). This panel data set contains standard demographic infor-
17:551:37407:17:17:97:569:495:12:Times:12:Times:B:mation as well as information on employment, earnings and education histories. In most years, the
17:552:37504:17:17:97:571:478:12:Times:12:Times:B:NLSY survey asks about the size of the firm at which the individual is employed and asks whether
17:553:37600:17:19:96:282:461:12:Times:12:Times:B:the firm operated at other locations.26
17:554:37639:19:17:113:568:442:13:Times:13:Times:A:The variables that we use are the race/ethnicity of the individual and the size of the firm at
17:555:37733:17:18:96:569:425:12:Times:12:Times:B:which the individual is employed. We define "minority" as black or Hispanic and combine women
17:556:37826:18:17:96:570:407:13:Times:13:Times:F:and men in the analysis. Only working persons are included in our sample and individuals at
17:557:37917:17:18:96:571:390:12:Times:12:Times:B:firms with more than one location are excluded.27 The final sample consists of approximately 2000
17:558:38014:18:18:96:568:372:12:Times:12:Times:B:observations followed over the years 1979 to 1993,28 Table 1 provides descriptive statistics of the
17:559:38113:18:18:96:229:354:12:Times:12:Times:B:variables used in our study.
17:560:38141:18:17:113:569:336:12:Times:12:Times:A:In our application, treatment x is a dummy variable for whether a firm is covered by the law.
17:561:38234:17:18:96:567:319:12:Times:12:Times:B:The dependent variable yj is the fraction of minority workers hired by the firm. Let z2denotethe

17:565:38445:25:14:104:569:229:10:Times:10:Times:F:26We would have preferred a dataset with more observations than the moderate number available in the NLSY,
17:566:38551:14:15:95:567:215:10:Times:10:Times:F:but most other datasets report firm size in intervals, which precludes the application of an RD evaluation method.
17:567:38665:15:15:95:570:200:10:Times:10:Times:F:These include the CPS (Current Population Survey), PSID (Panel Survey of Income Dynamics) and NLS (National
17:568:38772:15:11:95:221:185:10:Times:10:Times:F:Longitudinal Survey) datasets.
17:569:38802:11:14:104:571:174:10:Times:10:Times:F:27The law applies to the total number of employees in all locations combined. We do not know the exact number
17:570:38911:14:14:95:567:160:10:Times:10:Times:F:of employees at all other locations, only whether there were more or less than 1000 employees at the other locations.
17:571:39028:14:12:95:423:146:10:Times:10:Times:F:Since we can not determine whether the law applies, we excluded these persons.
17:572:39106:12:15:104:569:134:10:Times:10:Times:F:28The number of observations varies slightly from year to year because of attrition and as a consequence of our
17:573:39217:15:14:95:567:119:10:Times:10:Times:F:sample selection criteria. The question about firm size was not asked in years 1981 through 1985. See Appendix B
17:574:39329:14:45:95:304:105:10:Times:10:Times:F:for additional information on omitted observations.

18:578:39479:18:18:114:567:675:12:Times:12:Times:A:We do not have data on individual firms but rather data on individual workers and the sizes
18:579:39570:18:17:97:569:657:13:Times:13:Times:F:of the firms at which they work.29 From the data set, however, we can infer the fraction of
18:580:39661:17:18:97:569:640:12:Times:12:Times:B:minorities in firms of a given size, and the number of firms of a given size. By using the number of
18:581:39761:18:17:97:570:622:12:Times:12:Times:B:observations of a given firm size as weights in the local linear regression of the fraction of minorities
18:582:39866:17:18:97:569:605:12:Times:12:Times:B:on the firm sizes, we can recover the estimates that would have been obtained had we had access
18:583:39961:18:19:97:569:587:12:Times:12:Times:B:to individual firm data. For example, the local linear regression estimator of limo+ E(yjlzo + e)

18:592:40379:18:18:96:568:411:12:Times:12:Times:B:estimators for the lower limit expression can be defined analogously. To estimate the treatment
18:593:40474:18:17:96:570:393:12:Times:12:Times:B:effect, we take the difference between the estimated conditional mean fraction of minorities employed
18:594:40575:17:18:96:388:376:12:Times:12:Times:B:at firms just above and just below the threshold value of 15.
18:595:40636:18:18:113:570:358:12:Times:12:Times:A:There are many different variables that one would expect to affect the proportion of minorities
18:596:40731:18:17:95:571:340:12:Times:12:Times:B:hired by a firm. For example, there may be differential costs with more selective hiring. The size
18:597:40829:17:18:95:571:323:12:Times:12:Times:B:of the firm may be correlated with other variables such as the industrial sector to which the firm
18:598:40927:18:20:95:567:305:12:Times:12:Times:B:belongs and the geographic region in which it is located, both of which may in turn be correlated
18:599:41024:20:15:95:571:285:13:Times:13:Times:F:with the demographic composition of the applicant pool (see Brown and Medoff, 1989, and/or
18:600:41114:15:18:95:570:270:13:Times:13:Times:F:Holzer, 1996). Furthermore, in 20 states (mostly northern states) firms are also subject to state
18:601:41211:18:17:95:380:252:12:Times:12:Times:B:fair employment laws which are similar to the federal laws.
18:602:41270:17:18:113:570:235:13:Times:13:Times:A:A key advantage of adopting an RD approach is that it does not require building a model of
18:603:41360:18:18:95:568:217:12:Times:12:Times:B:all the determinants of minority hirings. This is because the effects of all these other unobserved
18:604:41459:18:17:95:570:199:13:Times:13:Times:F:determinants are not discontinuous at 15 and so enter through c in (1). As long as their effect
18:605:41554:17:20:95:569:182:12:Times:12:Times:B:is continuous at 15, their effect differences out in estimation. In the case of state fair employment
18:606:41655:20:14:104:567:162:10:Times:10:Times:F:29This implies that our data set is subject to size-biased sampling, since it oversamples bigger firms and under-
18:607:41768:14:15:95:568:148:10:Times:10:Times:F:samples smaller ones. However, size-biased sampling does not pose any particular problem in our study since we are
18:608:41882:15:11:95:396:133:10:Times:10:Times:F:interested in the percentage of minorities conditional on a given firm size.
18:609:41958:11:15:104:567:122:10:Times:10:Times:F:30Sampling weights provided in the NLSY dataset to account for nonrandom sampling are used to reweig ht the
18:610:42065:15:14:95:571:107:11:Times:11:Times:F:data back to random proportions in constructing each of the y(z1) means. See Todd (1996) for discussion of local
18:611:42177:14:33:95:343:93:10:Times:10:Times:F:linear regression methods in nonrandom sampling situations.

19:613:42238:0:18:94:565:709:12:Times:12:Times:B:laws, it is worthwhile to note that the cut-off size, which varies across states (from 1 to 100), is
19:614:42338:18:34:95:188:691:11:Times:11:Times:F:never equal to 15.31

19:616:42379:24:17:95:567:633:12:Times:12:Times:B:We estimate the conditional means nonparametrically by local linear regression, which requires that
19:617:42478:17:17:95:566:616:12:Times:12:Times:B:we choose a kernel and bandwidth. Previous research has shown that nonparametric estimates can
19:618:42572:17:20:95:567:599:12:Times:12:Times:B:be particularly sensitive to the choice of bandwidth—more so than to the choice of kernel. (see e.g.
19:619:42672:20:15:95:566:579:11:Helvetica:12:Times:B:Silverman1982, or Hardle and Linton, 1994). We specify the kernel to be the biweight kernel and
19:620:42767:15:19:95:550:564:12:Times:12:Times:B:consider several alternative choices of the bandwidth to check the robustness of our findings.32

19:623:43051:18:18:95:567:511:12:Times:12:Times:B:percentage minorities conditional on the firm size are obtained by local linear regression weighted
19:624:43150:18:17:96:566:493:13:Times:13:Times:F:means, taken separately over the data sets defined by z<15 and zj>15. Figure 2 plots the
19:625:43238:17:18:96:569:476:12:Times:12:Times:B:estimates for each of the years in our panel. The estimated effect of the change in the law for firms
19:626:43339:18:17:96:567:458:12:Times:12:Times:B:of size 15 is the difference in the estimated conditional means evaluated atTable 2 reports
19:627:43430:17:21:96:566:441:12:Times:12:Times:B:the estimated treatment effect in each year, obtained under several different bandwidth choices.35
19:628:43528:21:18:113:570:420:13:Times:13:Times:A:Figure 2 and the estimates in Table 2 provide support for the hypothesis that the law has a
19:629:43619:18:18:96:569:402:12:Times:13:Times:B:positive effect on the percentage of minority workers employed at smallfirms.36 In most of the
19:630:43713:18:17:96:568:384:12:Times:12:Times:B:years, the figure shows a positive change in the conditional mean atfirm size equal to 15. However,
19:631:43812:17:18:96:571:367:12:Times:12:Times:B:the table reveals that often the estimated changes are not significantly different from zero, which
19:632:43911:18:17:96:567:349:12:Times:12:Times:B:we conjecture is due primarily to the moderate size samples available to us. For some ofthe years,
19:633:44009:17:19:97:568:332:12:Times:12:Times:B:the estimates are sensitive to the choice of bandwidth. In two of the years, 1987 and 1991, effects
19:634:44108:19:19:97:572:313:12:Times:12:Times:B:of a magnitude of around 10% (implying an increase of 10 percentage points in minorities' share
19:635:44203:19:14:105:571:294:10:Times:10:Times:F:311t may be, however, that the federal law may have a smaller effect in states with stringent fair employment laws.
19:636:44318:14:14:97:522:280:10:Times:10:Times:F:The treatment effect we estimate is the impact of the federal law conditional on any existing state laws.
19:637:44423:14:10:106:494:266:10:Times:10:Times:A:32The biweight kernel (also called the quartic kernel) is K(s) =(2 — 1)2for II <1,=0 else.
19:638:44513:10:16:106:573:256:10:Times:10:Times:A:331n our data, numbers such as 10, 15, 20, 25 and 50 tend to be reported more often, suggesting that individuals
19:639:44625:16:13:97:570:240:10:Times:10:Times:F:may round in reporting the firm size. It appears from the frequenciesof reported firm sizes that individuals at larger
19:640:44743:13:14:97:569:227:11:Times:11:Times:F:firms are more likely to round. If employees are rounding in reporting firm size, then this creates a measurement
19:641:44856:14:14:97:569:213:10:Times:11:Times:F:error problem: Some employees giving a size below 15 may still be at a firm that reported tothe EEOC and other
19:642:44966:14:16:97:572:199:11:Times:11:Times:F:individuals giving a size greater than 15 may be at firms that did not report. We do not yet know how to address
19:643:45078:16:11:97:383:183:10:Times:10:Times:F:the measurement error problem in the regression discontinuity design.
19:644:45147:11:12:106:357:172:10:Times:10:Times:A:34A bandwidth equal to 12 was used in generating the figure.
19:645:45207:12:14:107:571:160:10:Times:10:Times:F:35Estimation with bandwidths of size 7orless gave estimates with high variability and resulted in negative estimated
19:646:45323:14:14:98:569:146:10:Times:11:Times:F:percentages minority for at least one year. Therefore, 8 is the smallest bandwidth sizethat we report in the table.
19:647:45438:14:16:98:573:132:11:Times:11:Times:F:We report results for bandwidths equal to 8, 10, 12, and 14 but bandwidths equal to 9,11, and 13 yielded similar
19:648:45550:16:10:98:127:116:10:Times:10:Times:F:results.
19:649:45558:10:16:107:573:106:10:Times:10:Times:A:36Table B.2, which reports estimates omitting with exactly 15 employees from the sample firms, reveals that our
19:650:45669:16:30:98:244:90:10:Times:10:Times:F:point estimates are rather sensitive.

20:653:45806:18:18:92:564:692:13:Times:13:Times:F:At least for these two years, we can conclude that EEOC coverage had a positive effect of the
20:654:45899:18:18:92:563:674:12:Times:12:Times:B:percentage of minorities employed in small firms. The effect may be due to discrimination on the
20:655:45995:18:17:92:564:656:13:Times:13:Times:F:part of small flrms in hiring minorities or to greater efforts on the part of minority workers to
20:656:46092:17:18:92:565:639:12:Times:12:Times:B:seek employment at firms that are covered by the law. We cannot distinguish between these two
20:657:46185:18:17:92:563:621:12:Times:13:Times:B:sources, but because of the RD design we can at least be relativelyconfident that this estimated
20:658:46281:17:18:93:564:604:13:Times:13:Times:F:effect is due to the law and not to other factors. On the other hand, the use of 5% significance
20:659:46377:18:17:93:565:586:12:Times:12:Times:B:levels may be a little misleading given the number of years used. Such significance levels may result

20:661:46573:18:18:93:563:551:12:Times:12:Times:B:The law did not have any effect in any given year". It may well be the case that the significance
20:662:46670:18:18:93:566:533:12:Times:12:Times:B:of the two years, 1987 and 1991, is purely due to such problem. Bonferroni type modification then
20:663:46767:18:16:93:248:515:12:Times:12:Times:B:make it impossible to reject H0.
20:664:46799:16:17:110:566:499:12:Times:12:Times:A:The second to last row of the table reports the estimated treatment effect that would be obtained
20:665:46896:17:19:93:568:482:13:Times:13:Times:F:simply by taking the difference between the percentage of minorities for firms with 15 or more
20:666:46990:19:16:93:564:463:13:Times:13:Times:F:employees and for firms with fewer than 15 employees. This would correspond to a simple IV
20:667:47080:16:18:93:564:447:13:Times:13:Times:F:estimator using an indicator for size - 15 as the instrument. We find that such an estimator
20:668:47172:18:18:93:567:429:13:Times:13:Times:F:would lead to similar inference in terms of the signs of the estimates. On the other hand, the
20:669:47266:18:18:94:565:411:12:Times:12:Times:B:'reported' standard errors based on the usual IV asymptotics are much smaller for this estimator.
20:670:47363:18:18:94:568:393:12:Times:12:Times:B:If the Wald assumption is satisfied, the IV estimator uses all the data instead of only the ones near
20:671:47464:18:17:94:568:375:12:Times:12:Times:B:cut-off point and, hence, is more accurate—as reflected in the smaller 'reported' standard errors. If
20:672:47565:17:18:94:568:358:13:Times:13:Times:F:the Wald assumption is not satisfied, then the IV estimator, viewed as an RD estimator, uses a
20:673:47659:18:18:94:565:340:12:Times:12:Times:B:bandwidth large enough to encompass all the data, and is therefore likely to suffer from severe bias.
20:674:47760:18:17:94:567:322:12:Times:12:Times:B:The last row of the table considers a locaL IV estimator, that only uses data in a neighborhood of
20:675:47858:17:20:94:570:305:12:Times:12:Times:B:the cut-off (observations within a bandwidth equal to 12). Here the effects are also positive but of
20:676:47958:20:40:94:247:285:12:Times:12:Times:B:somewhat smaller magnitude.37
20:677:47987:40:26:95:188:245:20:Times:20:Times:C:6 Summary
20:678:47996:26:17:95:569:219:13:Times:13:Times:F:A RD evaluation provides an answer to a precise question: what is the treatment effect for a
20:679:48088:17:19:95:567:202:12:Times:13:Times:B:particular subgroup of individuals? The most attractive feature of the method isthat it is justified
20:680:48188:19:16:95:570:183:12:Times:12:Times:B:with very minimal assumptions and bypasses many of the questions concerning model specification:
20:681:48284:16:19:95:568:167:13:Times:13:Times:F:both the question of which variables to include in the model and of their functional forms. A
20:682:48377:19:18:95:571:148:13:Times:13:Times:F:limitation of the RD method is that there are many aspects of the treatment impact distribution
20:683:48472:18:18:96:570:130:13:Times:13:Times:F:that may be of interest in any evaluation. Estimating these other parameters usually requires
20:684:48565:18:19:96:295:112:12:Times:12:Times:B:imposing more structure on the problem.
20:685:48604:19:33:105:437:93:10:Times:10:Times:A:37The estimated effects are very similar to those reported in Chay's (1995) study.

21:687:48688:0:16:112:567:708:13:Times:13:Times:A:In this paper, we examine how the regression discontinuity (RD) data design can be used
21:688:48775:16:19:95:564:692:12:Times:12:Times:B:to nonparametrically estimate treatment effects. We consider the question of identification and
21:689:48870:19:18:95:567:673:13:Times:13:Times:F:estimation under two salient cases, the sharp design and the fuzzy design. The estimator we
21:690:48961:18:17:95:564:655:12:Times:12:Times:B:propose uses recently developed local linear nonparametric regression techniquesthat avoid the poor
21:691:49060:17:17:95:566:638:12:Times:12:Times:B:boundary behavior of the kernel regression estimator. We also demonstrate that the regression-
21:692:49154:17:18:95:567:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:discontinuity design sometimes provides a possible justification for the Wald estimator, even when
21:693:49252:18:17:95:292:603:12:Times:12:Times:B:the zero correlation condition is violated.
21:694:49295:17:16:113:565:586:13:Times:13:Times:A:We apply the proposed methods to estimate the effect that EEOC coverage has on firms'
21:695:49380:16:19:96:568:570:12:Times:12:Times:B:minority employment patterns. Our estimator takes advantage of the fact that firms with fewer than
21:696:49478:19:18:96:566:551:12:Times:12:Times:B:15 employees are not covered under the law. For two years in our panel, we find empirical support for
21:697:49579:18:18:96:567:533:12:Times:12:Times:B:a statistically significant positive effect of EEOC coverage on the employment of minority workers,
21:698:49678:18:455:96:532:515:12:Times:12:Times:B:although Bonferroni type consideration renders even such finding statistically insignificant.

25:787:55460:27:19:113:569:344:12:Times:12:Times:A:• The event x (z0 —e)=1is the same event that the ith individual belongs to Group A. Hence,

25:790:55719:17:18:124:569:291:12:Times:12:Times:A:A among those whose SAT score is zo —e.Therefore, (4) simply means that the proportion
25:791:55805:18:26:124:487:273:12:Times:12:Times:A:of Group A near the discontinuity is continuous as a function of SAT score.

25:793:55965:20:15:124:568:227:12:Times:12:Times:A:GroupC.Therefore, (5) simply means that the proportion of Group C among people with

27:831:57910:18:17:95:566:608:12:Times:12:Times:B:4.2.1. For simplicity of notation, we use the same bandwidth h in describing the distribution theory
27:832:58010:17:18:95:547:591:12:Times:12:Times:B:for all the limit estimators, although the bandwidth need not be the same in implementation.

35:1116:64489:18:18:97:568:657:12:Times:12:Times:B:sample was extracted that included all person-year observations for the years in which the question
35:1117:64588:18:17:97:567:639:12:Times:12:Times:B:on firm size was asked (1979, 1980 and 1986 to 1993). Only individuals who reported to be employed
35:1118:64686:17:18:97:570:622:12:Times:12:Times:B:at the time of each interview at a firm with only 1 location and who reported a positive number of
35:1119:64784:18:17:97:569:604:12:Times:12:Times:B:employees at this location were included, leaving 25059 person-year observations on 8151 different
35:1120:64882:17:18:97:152:587:12:Times:12:Times:B:individuals.
35:1121:64894:18:17:114:569:569:12:Times:12:Times:A:Subsequently all individuals with missing information on race and those who reported to be
35:1122:64984:17:18:96:570:552:13:Times:13:Times:F:self-employed or to be working without pay were excluded to result in a final sample of 21383
35:1123:65077:18:17:96:358:534:12:Times:12:Times:B:person-year observations on 8033 different individuals.
