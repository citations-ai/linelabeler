3:46:2706:14:28:72:75:694:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B: 
3:47:2706:28:29:108:535:666:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: Education is one of the most important avenues through which governments can address 
3:48:2791:29:28:72:541:637:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:concerns of economic growth and equity.  Human capital plays a substantial role in the economic 
3:49:2887:28:28:72:525:609:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:growth of nations (Topel 1999) and, in the past two decades, skill biased technical change has 
3:50:2982:28:29:72:514:581:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:increased the returns to schooling, exacerbating wage inequality between the most and least 
3:51:3074:29:28:72:530:552:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:educated members of our society (Katz and Murphy 1992).  At the same time, cognitive ability 
3:52:3167:28:28:72:504:524:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:has become an increasingly important determinant of labor market success in this country 
3:53:3256:28:28:72:188:496:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:(Murnane et al. 1995).   
3:54:3281:28:29:108:500:468:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: Aware of the importance of education, economists have spent considerable effort 
3:55:3361:29:28:72:491:439:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:examining what factors affect academic achievement.  There is a large literature on the 
3:56:3449:28:28:72:531:411:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:importance of financial resources in determining educational outcomes.1  However, researchers 
3:57:3543:28:29:72:538:383:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:have paid considerably less attention to remedial programs designed to improve the performance 
3:58:3638:29:28:72:521:354:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:of low achieving students, including summer school and grade retention (Eide and Showalter 
3:59:3729:28:28:72:140:326:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f4:B:forthcoming). 
3:60:3743:28:29:108:539:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Such policies, however, have become increasingly popular in recent years.  Sixteen states 
3:61:3833:29:28:72:532:269:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:provide funding for districts that institute summer programs, require summer school attendance 
3:62:3928:28:28:72:531:241:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:for students who do not meet academic expectations or require districts to offer summer school 
3:63:4023:28:29:72:542:213:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:to low achieving students (ECS 2000).  In the summer of 1999, New York City provided summer 
3:64:4115:29:28:72:516:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:help for 70,000 students and Chicago required over 30,000 low-achieving students to attend 
3:65:4206:28:28:72:511:156:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:summer classes.  Other urban districts with summer programs include Houston, with 8,000 
3:66:4294:28:0:72:530:128:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:students enrolled; Boston, with 6,500; Denver, with 6,000; Los Angeles, with 139,000; and the 
4:67:4388:0:28:72:541:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:District of Columbia, with 30,000 (Pipho 1999).  There is a growing interest in grade retention as 
4:68:4487:28:28:72:505:680:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:well.  Nineteen states explicitly tie student promotion to performance on a state or district 
4:69:4581:28:29:72:526:652:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:assessment (ECS 2000).  The largest school districts in the country, including New York City, 
4:70:4675:29:28:72:510:623:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington D.C., have recently implemented policies requiring 
4:71:4762:28:28:72:505:595:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:students to repeat a grade when they do not demonstrate sufficient mastery of basic skills. 
4:72:4854:28:29:108:488:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Despite their popularity, these practices—particularly grade retention—remain 
4:73:4932:29:28:72:521:538:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:controversial.  Prior research suggests that summer school has a substantial positive effect on 
4:74:5028:28:28:72:500:510:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:student learning in the short-run, but there is less evidence regarding the sustainability of 
4:75:5122:28:29:72:527:482:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:achievement gains made during the summer.  In contrast, the majority of retention studies find 
4:76:5217:29:28:72:538:453:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:that the practice of requiring students to repeat a grade decreases self-esteem, school adjustment, 
4:77:5317:28:28:72:530:425:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and academic achievement, and increases dropout rates.  However, prior studies fail to account 
4:78:5412:28:29:72:513:397:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:for the selection of students into these programs, thus potentially overstating the benefits of 
4:79:5508:29:28:72:339:368:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f5:B:summer school and exaggerating the harm of retention. 
4:80:5561:28:28:108:519:340:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:In this paper, we use a regression discontinuity design to examine the causal effect of 
4:81:5649:28:29:72:502:312:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:summer school and grade retention on student achievement.  In 1996, the Chicago Public 
4:82:5736:29:28:72:503:283:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Schools (CPS) instituted an accountability policy that tied summer school attendance and 
4:83:5825:28:28:72:542:255:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:promotional decisions to performance on standardized tests, which resulted in a highly non-linear 
4:84:5923:28:28:72:517:227:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:relationship between current achievement and the probability of attending summer school or 
4:85:6014:28:29:72:525:199:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:being retained.2  We use the exogenous variation generated by the decision rule to identify the 
4:86:6110:29:37:72:244:170:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:impact of these remedial programs. 
4:87:6145:37:7:539:542:133:122:g_d0_f8:122:g_d0_f8:?:                                                                                                                                                                           
4:88:6315:7:17:72:514:126:42:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f10:F:1 Hanushek (1996) and Hedges and Greenwald (1996) present contrasting views regarding the effectiveness of 
4:89:6422:17:12:72:506:109:99:g_d0_f10:99:g_d0_f10:F:resources on student achievement.  Many researchers have also focused on the effect of class size on student 
4:90:6531:12:7:72:494:97:99:g_d0_f10:99:g_d0_f10:F:outcomes.  These studies include works by Angrist and Lavy (1999), Krueger (1999), and Hoxby (2000). 
4:91:6632:7:16:72:536:90:42:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f10:F:2 In prior work, we have examined the potential motivational effects of these requirements and found that the policy 
4:92:6749:16:0:72:530:74:99:g_d0_f10:99:g_d0_f10:F:increased achievement, particularly among older students (Jacob 2001; Roderick et. al. 2000).  In this analysis, we 
5:93:6865:0:28:108:542:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:We find that summer school increased academic achievement in reading and mathematics 
5:94:6950:28:28:72:530:680:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and that these positive effects remain substantial at least two years following the completion of 
5:95:7048:28:29:72:538:652:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the program.  In contrast to prior studies, we find that retention has no negative consequences on 
5:96:7147:29:28:72:543:623:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the academic achievement of students retained in the third grade—indeed it appears that retention 
5:97:7245:28:28:72:535:595:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:may actually increase performance in the short run.  The impact of retention on older students is 
5:98:7343:28:29:72:394:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:mixed, with no impact on math and a negative effect on reading.3   
5:99:7410:29:28:108:513:538:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.  Section 2 reviews the previous 
5:100:7495:28:28:72:538:510:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:literature on summer school and grade retention.  Section 3 provides background on the Chicago 
5:101:7590:28:29:72:521:482:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:policy.  Section 4 describes our data and Section 5 explains our empirical strategy.  Section 6 
5:102:7686:29:28:72:530:453:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:presents findings on the net effect of summer school and retention.  Section 7 presents findings 
5:103:7783:28:28:72:531:425:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:on the separate effect of grade retention.  Section 8 examines the independent effect of summer 
5:104:7879:28:29:72:358:397:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:school.  Section 9 discusses these findings and concludes.

5:106:7940:28:28:72:404:340:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:C:2.  Previous Literature on Summer School and Grade Retention  
5:107:8002:28:29:108:536:312:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Both summer school and grade retention have a long history within American education, 
5:108:8088:29:28:72:535:283:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:dating back to the introduction of mass public education in the mid-nineteenth century (Shepard 
5:109:8184:28:28:72:538:255:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and Smith 1989).  Both practices have been widely implemented and have received considerable 
5:110:8277:28:28:72:540:227:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:attention from researchers.  However, prior studies do not adequately address the potential biases 
5:111:8376:28:29:72:432:199:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:introduced by the non-random selection into summer school and retention. 
5:112:8449:29:28:108:536:170:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:In a detailed synthesis of 93 summer school evaluations, Cooper et. al. (2000) concluded 
5:113:8538:28:27:72:514:142:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:that remedial summer programs increased achievement by roughly .25 standard deviations.  
5:114:8627:27:13:539:542:115:122:g_d0_f8:122:g_d0_f8:?:                                                                                                                                                                           
5:115:8797:13:12:72:538:102:99:g_d0_f10:99:g_d0_f10:F:set aside the incentives associated with the policy and instead focus on the direct academic consequences of summer 
5:116:8913:12:0:72:434:90:99:g_d0_f10:99:g_d0_f10:F:school and grade retention for those students who fail to meet the promotional standards.   
6:117:9005:0:28:72:522:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:However, even the most careful of these studies relied on comparisons between students who 
6:118:9096:28:28:72:504:680:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:chose to attend summer school with those who chose not to attend.  If the most motivated 
6:119:9185:28:29:72:530:652:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:students (or those with the most motivated, supportive parents) attend summer school, then the 
6:120:9280:29:28:72:527:623:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:estimated summer school treatment effect will be biased upward.  In addition, these studies do 
6:121:9375:28:28:72:415:595:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:not examine whether these benefits are sustained in subsequent years.   
6:122:9447:28:29:108:529:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:While less consistent than the summer school literature, studies of grade retention have 
6:123:9536:29:28:72:542:538:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:generally found that repeating a grade has a negative impact on student outcomes.4  In a survey of 
6:124:9635:28:28:72:542:510:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:47 empirical studies with a variety of academic achievement measures, Holmes (1989) found that 
6:125:9730:28:29:72:542:482:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:retained students scored 0.19 to 0.31 standard deviations below comparable students who had not 
6:126:9826:29:28:72:517:453:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:been retained.  Moreover, a variety of studies have found that retention is associated with an 
6:127:9921:28:28:72:529:425:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:increased likelihood of dropping out (Schulz, Toles et al. 1986; Rumberger 1987; Grissom and 
6:128:10014:28:29:72:505:397:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Shepard 1989; Fine 1991; Roderick 1994).  However, selection issues cast doubt on these 
6:129:10102:29:28:72:541:368:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:findings as well.  In contrast to summer school, students are not generally given a choice whether 
6:130:10201:28:28:72:532:340:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:to repeat a grade, but rather this decision is made by the teacher or school principal on the basis 
6:131:10301:28:29:72:517:312:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:of unobservable characteristics (e.g., motivation, maturity, parental involvement, etc.).  This 
6:132:10397:29:49:72:424:283:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:suggests that OLS estimates of grade retention will be biased downward.

6:134:10521:28:29:108:520:206:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:An accountability policy recently implemented in Chicago provides an opportunity to 
6:135:10605:29:28:72:531:177:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:more carefully examine the impacts of these programs.  In 1996-97, Chicago instituted a policy 
6:136:10700:28:27:72:523:149:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:to end social promotion – the practice of passing students to the next grade regardless of their

6:138:10967:8:17:72:501:114:42:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f10:F:3 However, as we discuss below, the negative effects for sixth grade students may be due to differential test 
6:139:11077:17:7:72:281:97:99:g_d0_f10:99:g_d0_f10:F:incentives faced by retained and promoted students. 
6:140:11129:7:16:72:542:90:42:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f10:F:4 Several recent studies have found moderate, positive effects of retention  (Karweit 1991; Pierson and Connell 1992; 
6:141:11247:16:0:72:463:74:99:g_d0_f10:99:g_d0_f10:F:Alexander, Entwisle et al. 1994; Eide and Showalter forthcoming; Dworkin, Lorence et al. 1999). 
7:142:11343:0:28:72:514:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:academic skills or school performance.  Under the policy, students in third, sixth and eighth 
7:143:11437:28:28:72:539:680:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:grade are required to perform at predefined levels in both reading and mathematics in order to be 
7:144:11535:28:29:72:517:652:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:promoted to the next grade.  For example, third graders must obtain a minimum score of 2.8

7:147:11821:28:29:72:507:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:5.3, and 7.0 respectively, which roughly corresponded to the 20th percentile in the national 
7:148:11914:29:28:72:535:538:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:achievement distribution.6  Students who do not meet the standard in June are required to attend 
7:149:12011:28:28:72:536:510:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:a six-week summer school program, after which they can retake the exams.  Those who pass the 
7:150:12104:28:29:72:515:482:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:August exams move on to the next grade.  Students who again fail are required to repeat the

7:152:12295:28:28:72:503:425:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:June and August test performance.  The policy impacted a large proportion of elementary 
7:153:12383:28:29:72:539:397:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:students.  From 1997 to 1999, over 30,000 third graders and over 21,000 sixth graders attended a 
7:154:12480:29:28:72:524:368:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:mandatory summer school program and roughly 10 to 20 percent of the eligible students were 
7:155:12571:28:28:72:177:340:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:eventually held back. 
7:156:12593:28:29:108:540:312:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:There are several reasons to believe that the summer school and grade retention programs 
7:157:12682:29:28:72:524:283:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:in Chicago might influence academic achievement.  Classes in summer school were generally 
7:158:12772:28:28:72:517:255:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:quite small, often with fewer than 15 students per class.  Principals hand-picked teachers for 
7:159:12867:28:28:72:500:227:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:summer school and the CPS provided a highly structured curriculum (including resource 
7:160:12953:28:66:72:518:199:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:materials) that teachers were required to follow.  Retention was intended to provide students

7:162:13100:7:17:72:535:126:42:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f10:F:5 Grade equivalents are normed so that a student at the 50th percentile in the nation scores at the eighth month of her

7:164:13284:7:16:72:535:102:42:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f10:F:6 The CPS has raised the promotional cutoffs several times since 1997.  The eighth grade cutoff was raised to 7.2 in 
7:165:13401:16:7:72:426:86:99:g_d0_f10:99:g_d0_f10:F:1998, 7.4 in 1999 and 7.7 in 2000.  The sixth grade cutoff was raised to 5.5 in 2000.       
7:166:13493:7:0:72:453:79:42:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f10:F:7 Students over the age of fifteen who were retained were placed in special “transition” centers.

8:168:13689:28:29:72:388:680:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:with additional resources to meet the needs of retained students.

8:176:14227:29:28:72:537:453:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:provides demographic and school resource information, including the racial and socio-economic 
8:177:14321:28:28:72:510:425:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:composition at the school.  The outcome measure we use is student scores on the math and

8:179:14504:29:28:72:361:368:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:administered annually to students in grades three to eight.8   
8:180:14567:28:28:108:523:340:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:The base sample for this study consists of the cohort of students who were in the third 
8:181:14655:28:34:72:542:312:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and sixth grade from the 1993-1994 school year to the 1998-1999 school years, a total of 402,924

8:183:14805:8:16:72:521:270:42:g_d0_f9:99:g_d0_f10:F:8 ITBS scores are typically reported in terms of grade equivalents, which are normed so that a student at the 50th 
8:184:14919:16:12:72:542:254:99:g_d0_f10:99:g_d0_f10:F:percentile in the nation scores at the eighth month of her current grade – i.e., an average third grader will score a 3.8.  
8:185:15043:12:12:72:522:242:99:g_d0_f10:99:g_d0_f10:F:Grade equivalents, however, present a number of well-know shortcomings for comparisons over time and across 
8:186:15151:12:12:72:541:230:99:g_d0_f10:99:g_d0_f10:F:grade: (1) different forms of the exam are administered each year and can vary in difficulty; (2) grade equivalents are 
8:187:15271:12:11:72:534:218:99:g_d0_f10:99:g_d0_f10:F:not a linear metric, so that a score of 5.3 on level 12 of the exam does not represent the same thing as a score of 5.3 
8:188:15391:11:12:72:542:207:99:g_d0_f10:99:g_d0_f10:F:at level 13; (3) grade equivalents are not linear within test level because the scale spreads out more at the extremes of 
8:189:15513:12:12:72:527:195:99:g_d0_f10:99:g_d0_f10:F:the score distribution.  To mitigate some of these concerns, we use an alternative outcome metric derived from an 
8:190:15627:12:12:72:508:183:99:g_d0_f10:99:g_d0_f10:F:item-response model.  This model assume that the probability that student i answers questions j correctly is a 
8:191:15738:12:12:72:527:171:99:g_d0_f10:99:g_d0_f10:F:function of the student ability and the item difficulty.  In practice, one estimates a simple logit model in which the 
8:192:15857:12:14:72:532:159:99:g_d0_f10:99:g_d0_f10:F:outcome is whether or not student i correctly answers question j.  The explanatory variables include an indicator 
8:193:15971:14:12:72:503:145:99:g_d0_f10:99:g_d0_f10:F:variable for each question and each student.  The difficulty of the question is given by the coefficient on the 
8:194:16083:12:12:72:541:133:99:g_d0_f10:99:g_d0_f10:F:appropriate indicator variable and the student ability is measured by the coefficient on the student indicator variable.  
8:195:16205:12:12:72:542:121:99:g_d0_f10:99:g_d0_f10:F:The resulting metric is calibrated in terms of logits.  By taking advantage of the common items across different forms 
8:196:16324:12:12:72:520:109:99:g_d0_f10:99:g_d0_f10:F:and levels of the exam, these measures provide an effective way to compare students in different grade levels or

9:204:16984:28:28:72:514:595:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:left the system or were placed in self-contained special education classes the following year

9:209:17363:29:28:72:515:453:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:disproportionately minority and extremely low achieving compared with a national sample.

9:211:17550:28:29:72:523:397:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:or reduced price lunches.  Students who are retained are even more likely to be from minority 
9:212:17644:29:28:72:273:368:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:backgrounds and low-income families.     
9:213:17685:28:28:108:502:340:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: Given the low achievement levels in the CPS, the promotional policy applied to a 
9:214:17766:28:29:72:485:312:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:substantial proportion of students.  Over 40 percent of third graders failed to meet the 
9:215:17855:29:28:72:533:283:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:promotional standards from 1997 to 1999 as did about 30 percent of sixth graders.  The reading 
9:216:17950:28:28:72:524:255:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:exam proved to be a more difficult hurdle than the math exam, with nearly all students failing 
9:217:18045:28:28:72:510:227:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:reading alone or both reading and math.  Even after five to ten percent of students received

10:234:19200:29:28:108:508:390:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:However, by tying promotional decisions to performance on standardized tests, the 
10:235:19282:28:28:72:536:362:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Chicago policy created a highly non-linear relationship between a student’s current achievement 
10:236:19378:28:29:72:535:334:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and his or her probability of attending summer school or being retained.  Figure 2 illustrates this 
10:237:19478:29:28:72:534:305:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:relationship for third and sixth graders from 1997 to 1999.  Roughly 90 percent of students who 
10:238:19574:28:28:72:534:277:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:passed math but scored just below the cutoff in reading received some remedial treatment while 
10:239:19669:28:29:72:524:249:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:almost no one who passed math and scored at or above the cutoff in reading attended summer

10:241:19786:28:28:108:509:192:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Assuming that unobservable characteristics do not vary discontinuously around the 
10:242:19868:28:29:72:522:164:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:cutoff, the promotional decision rule provides exogenous variation in the treatment.  Because 
10:243:19962:29:28:72:515:135:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:treatment is perfectly correlated to observable characteristics, it is orthogonal to unobserved 
10:244:20058:28:28:72:501:107:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:characteristics.  One can thus identify the impact of these programs by simply comparing 
10:245:20147:28:0:72:533:79:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:students who scored just below and just above the promotional cutoff.  For example, if students 
11:246:20243:0:28:72:541:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:who missed the cutoff (and were thus required to attend summer school) learned much more than 
11:247:20337:28:28:72:529:680:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:students who just made the cutoff (and thus avoided summer school), then one might conclude 
11:248:20429:28:29:72:399:652:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:that summer school had a positive impact on student achievement.   
11:249:20496:29:28:108:529:623:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:This strategy is often referred to as a regression discontinuity design.  In one of the first 
11:250:20590:28:28:72:500:595:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:papers to introduce this design, Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960) utilized the fact that 
11:251:20681:28:29:72:513:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:National Merit Awards are given on the basis of whether a test score exceeds a threshold to 
11:252:20773:29:28:72:535:538:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:estimate the effect of the award on a student’s other scholarship receipt and college aspirations.  
11:253:20873:28:28:72:535:510:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Others that have utilized this technique include Berk and Rauma (1983), Trochim (1984), Black 
11:254:20967:28:29:72:428:482:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:(1999), Angrist and Lavy (1999), Hahn et. al. (1999), and Guryon (2000). 
11:255:21040:29:28:108:490:453:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:The fundamental assumption behind regression discontinuity techniques is that 
11:256:21118:28:28:72:539:425:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:unobserved characteristics vary continuously (around the point of the cutoff) with the observable 
11:257:21216:28:29:72:516:397:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:characteristic used to determine treatment.  This assumption may not hold if individuals can 
11:258:21309:29:28:72:529:368:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:influence their position relative to the cutoff.  However, we believe that this type of intentional 
11:259:21409:28:28:72:534:340:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:manipulation is implausible in our case.  While a student may purposely miss many or all of the 
11:260:21505:28:29:72:519:312:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:exam questions, it is unlikely that he or she would have the incentive or ability to marginally 
11:261:21601:29:28:72:534:283:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:change her score near the cutoff (e.g., intentionally scoring a 2.7 instead of a 2.8) because of the 
11:262:21702:28:28:72:386:255:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:uncertainty regarding both performance and the grading metric.10 
11:263:21766:28:28:108:508:227:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:In the case of a sharp discontinuity, where performance exceeding a predetermined 
11:264:21848:28:29:72:523:199:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:threshold perfectly predicts treatment, continuity of unobserved characteristics is sufficient to 
11:265:21946:29:27:72:510:170:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:allow identification.  In some cases, however, treatment may be partly determined by other 
11:266:22037:27:8:216:219:143:122:g_d0_f8:122:g_d0_f8:?:                                                      
11:267:22090:8:16:72:523:135:42:g_d0_f24:99:g_d0_f25:F:10 Teacher cheating is a more plausible candidate for such intentional manipulation.  There is some evidence that 
11:268:22204:16:12:72:507:119:99:g_d0_f25:99:g_d0_f25:F:cheating has increased as a result of the accountability policies instituted in 1996 and is more common in the 
11:269:22315:12:12:72:536:107:99:g_d0_f25:99:g_d0_f25:F:promotional gate grades (Jacob and Levitt 2001).  As a check on this, we estimated kernel densities of the test score 
11:270:22433:12:0:72:521:95:99:g_d0_f25:99:g_d0_f25:F:distribution pre- and post-policy.  If students could (and chose to) strategically influence their scores or teachers 
12:271:22551:0:28:72:513:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:factors, leading to a “fuzzy” discontinuity.  For example, roughly 3 percent of students who 
12:272:22644:28:28:72:532:680:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:scored below the cutoffs in June received waivers from summer school and about 14 percent of 
12:273:22737:28:29:72:505:652:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:students in summer school received waivers in August.  In addition, a small percentage of 
12:274:22827:29:28:72:523:623:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:students who passed the exams were retained because of course failure or poor attendance.  If 
12:275:22921:28:28:72:529:595:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:waivers were distributed randomly, or on the basis of factors that are not correlated with future 
12:276:23019:28:29:72:514:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:outcomes, then this would not present a problem.  However, students who received waivers 
12:277:23108:29:28:72:505:538:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:differ from their peers over several observable characteristics, raising a concern that these 
12:278:23202:28:28:72:349:510:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:students differed along unobservable dimensions as well. 
12:279:23259:28:29:108:537:482:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Even with waivers, as long as the probability of treatment changes discontinuously at the 
12:280:23349:29:28:72:489:453:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:cutoff, it is possible to determine the treatment effect by comparing mean outcomes of 
12:281:23436:28:28:72:497:425:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:individuals in a narrow range on either side of the cutoff.  One merely needs to scale the 
12:282:23527:28:29:72:499:397:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:difference in outcomes by the difference in the probability of treatment.  If, however, the 
12:283:23619:29:28:72:530:368:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:probability of treatment drops over a range around the cutoff, it may not be possible to identify 
12:284:23717:28:28:72:529:340:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the treatment effect by simply comparing individuals to the left and the right of the cutoff.  We 
12:285:23815:28:29:72:515:312:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:can, however, use a broader range of data to identify the effect.  In essence, we can examine 
12:286:23909:29:28:72:542:283:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:whether performance drops (rises) in the range of performance where the probability of treatment 
12:287:24006:28:28:72:533:255:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:is rapidly changing.  To do so, we need to use data outside of this range to estimate the baseline 
12:288:24105:28:28:72:530:227:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:relationship between initial performance and subsequent outcomes.  In this case, we can use an 
12:289:24200:28:29:72:513:199:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:instrumental variables strategy in which our instruments are non-linear terms of current test 
12:290:24294:29:28:72:533:170:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:scores.  These terms are highly correlated with the probability of treatment (as seen in Figure 1) 
12:291:24393:28:44:72:540:142:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:but may not be directly correlated with future achievement.  Because we use only the variation in 
12:292:24491:44:12:539:542:98:122:g_d0_f8:122:g_d0_f8:?:                                                                                                                                                                           
12:293:24661:12:12:72:544:86:99:g_d0_f25:99:g_d0_f25:F:cheated in order to get their students above the cutoff, we would expect a discontinuity around the cutoff post-policy.  
12:294:24782:12:0:72:187:74:99:g_d0_f25:99:g_d0_f25:F:We find no evidence of this. 
13:295:24811:0:28:72:530:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:treatment associated with observable performance, our point estimates should be unaffected by 
13:296:24905:28:28:72:388:680:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the correlation between treatment and unobserved characteristics. 
13:297:24971:28:29:108:502:652:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:One drawback of the IV approach described above is that it relies on knowing the 
13:298:25052:29:28:72:542:623:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:functional form of the relationship between the outcome variable and the variable that determines 
13:299:25150:28:28:72:542:595:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:treatment.  In our case, this is the relationship between current test score and future performance.  
13:300:25252:28:29:72:521:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:If, for example, the relationship is non-linear around the cutoff but we specify the function as 
13:301:25349:29:28:72:540:538:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:linear, then the estimated treatment effect may simply pick up any underlying non-linearity in the 
13:302:25448:28:28:72:524:510:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:achievement relationship.  If the discontinuity is relatively sharp, then one can use a relatively 
13:303:25547:28:29:72:536:482:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:narrow range of data so that a linear approximation is quite good.  If the probability of treatment 
13:304:25647:29:28:72:537:453:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:declines more slowly with observed test score, then we must rely more heavily on our functional 
13:305:25743:28:28:72:165:425:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:form assumption.   
13:306:25762:28:29:108:528:397:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:We test the validity of this assumption in two ways.  First, we examine the relationship 
13:307:25851:29:28:72:486:368:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:between current test scores and future performance prior to the implementation of the 
13:308:25937:28:28:72:540:340:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:accountability policy.  Figure 3 shows that this relationship is indeed nearly linear, particularly in 
13:309:26040:28:29:72:535:312:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the range around the promotional cutoff.  Second, we can test the robustness of our estimates by 
13:310:26137:29:28:72:509:283:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:including second and third order polynomials of current test scores, in order to capture any 
13:311:26230:28:28:72:534:255:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:underlying non-linearity in the functional form.  As we see in the next section, our estimates are 
13:312:26329:28:28:72:292:227:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:robust to the inclusion of non-linear terms.     
13:313:26378:28:29:72:75:199:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B: 
13:314:26378:29:28:72:148:170:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:C:5.2. Estimation 
13:315:26394:28:28:108:518:142:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:A simple way to implement a regression discontinuity design is to compare the mean 
13:316:26477:28:31:72:529:114:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:achievement gains of students just below the cutoff to those students at the cutoff.  This can be 
13:317:26575:31:0:72:538:83:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:represented mathematically with the following expression: ()()tCtCtCtCYYYY,11,1,1,−+−+−−−, where 
14:318:26672:0:29:72:531:707:144:g_d0_f29:144:g_d0_f4:B:Y represents mean achievement, the first subscript denotes performance relative to the reading 
14:319:26767:29:28:72:529:678:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:cutoff (c indicates students at the cutoff and c-1 denotes students just below the cutoff) and the 
14:320:26866:28:28:72:525:650:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:second subscript denotes timing.  Because every individual below the cutoff is not treated and 
14:321:26961:28:29:72:537:622:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:some students above the cutoff are treated, we must scale the expression above by the difference 
14:322:27058:29:28:72:537:593:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:in the probability of treatment associated with meeting the cutoff.  Doing so yields the following

14:339:27344:29:28:72:523:456:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:equivalent to an IV estimate in which the only instrument is a dummy that takes on a value of 
14:340:27438:28:28:72:282:428:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:one if the student passes the reading cutoff.

14:342:27576:29:28:72:498:371:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:might be worried that any difference in achievement gains between these groups reflects 
14:343:27664:28:28:72:536:343:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:differences in initial ability rather than the influence of the treatment.11  To address this concern, 
14:344:27767:28:29:72:514:315:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:we can examine the performance of individuals just above the cutoff.  If we assume that the

14:346:27953:28:28:72:516:258:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:similar to the difference in achievement between those just above the cutoff and those at the

15:363:28396:0:28:72:514:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:The third difference is equivalent to an IV estimate in which we control for a linear trend of 
15:364:28491:28:28:72:511:680:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:reading ability and instrument for treatment using a dummy that takes on a value of one for

15:368:28676:28:29:108:527:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:As we mentioned previously, the second and third difference approaches are simply IV 
15:369:28761:29:28:72:532:538:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:strategies for estimating the treatment effect.  We will implement the three-difference estimator 
15:370:28859:28:29:72:511:510:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4::in the following way.  We will assume that our learning equation takes the following form: 
15:371:28950:29:32:72:375:481:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:?:(4)        tiititititiuTreatrdgeBXY,,2,1,1,)(εββ++++=+, 
15:372:29006:32:29:72:534:449:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:where Y is the academic outcome of interest, X is a vector of demographic characteristics, rdge 
15:373:29101:29:28:72:541:420:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:is the ITBS reading score, u is unobserved ability, and ε is an error term.  The first stage is given 
15:374:29203:28:30:72:157:392:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:by the following:

15:376:29276:34:31:72:531:328:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:where p1 is a dummy variable that indicates that the reading score is above the cutoff, and η is 
15:377:29373:31:28:72:533:297:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:an error term.  If we included no individual level covariates, this approach would be completely 
15:378:29470:28:28:72:509:269:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:equivalent to the three-difference strategy summarized by equation (3).  Implementing this 
15:379:29561:28:29:72:525:241:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:approach using IV gives us the flexibility to include student level covariates as a check for the 
15:380:29659:29:28:72:208:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:robustness of our estimates. 
15:381:29688:28:28:108:542:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: For students who passed math and failed reading in June, the probability of being retained 
15:382:29779:28:29:72:514:156:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:does not change discontinuously at the cutoff as a function of August reading performance.  
15:383:29871:29:28:72:529:127:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Instead it drops off sharply in a range just below the cutoff that we will refer to as the marginal 
15:384:29971:28:0:72:539:99:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:area.  This can be observed in Figures 5 and 6.  The fact that the probability of retention does not 
16:385:30072:0:28:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:change discontinuously prevents us from using the same first stage relationship given by equation 
16:386:30170:28:28:72:532:680:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:(5).  Instead, while examining the retention treatment, we will estimate a first stage relationship 
16:387:30270:28:31:72:182:652:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:of the following form: 
16:388:30293:31:34:72:523:621:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:?:(6)        tiitiptiptitimitmtitititiurdgerdgerdgeXTreat,5,,5,4,3,2,1,,1111ηγγγγγγ+++++++Γ=, 
16:389:30385:34:28:72:526:587:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:where m1 is a dummy variable that takes on a value of 1 if the student’s reading score is in the 
16:390:30482:28:28:72:534:559:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:marginal area and 0 otherwise.  The other variables are as previously described.  Away from the 
16:391:30578:28:29:72:497:531:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:cutoff, increases in reading performance appear to have little effect on the probability of 
16:392:30670:29:32:72:541:502:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:retention.  This suggests that 1γand5γ are likely to be small.  We interact the dummy variable for 
16:393:30769:32:28:72:532:470:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the marginal area with reading performance to take into account that for students just below the 
16:394:30866:28:29:72:544:442:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:cutoff, small increases in performance lead to large reduction in the probability of being retained.  
16:395:30968:29:32:72:532:413:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:If this is the case, 3γ should be strongly negative.  The learning equation is equivalent to that in 
16:396:31069:32:28:72:136:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:equation (4).

16:399:31162:28:29:108:502:297:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Our analysis proceeds as follows.  We first utilize the discontinuity created by the 
16:400:31247:29:28:72:529:268:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:promotional cutoff associated with the June testing to estimate the net effect of summer school 
16:401:31343:28:28:72:534:240:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and grade retention.  We next take advantage of the August cutoff to estimate the separate effect 
16:402:31441:28:29:72:530:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:of grade retention, using the sample of students who were assigned to summer school solely on 
16:403:31535:29:28:72:536:183:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the basis of their June reading scores.  For these students, the retention decision depended solely 
16:404:31635:28:28:72:522:155:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:on their August reading scores.  Finally, we derive estimates of the separate effect of summer 
16:405:31730:28:0:72:458:127:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:school, relying on the estimates of the net and retention effects described above. 
17:406:31813:0:28:108:521:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:The relatively sharp discontinuity between current achievement and the probability of 
17:407:31899:28:28:72:499:680:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:attending summer school and possibly being retained permits one to visually identify the 
17:408:31988:28:29:72:498:652:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:treatment effect.  If these programs had a substantial net impact on subsequent academic 
17:409:32077:29:28:72:503:623:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:achievement, we would expect to see a discontinuous or non-linear change in the average 
17:410:32165:28:28:72:538:595:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:achievement level around the promotional policy cutoff.  By plotting the probability of receiving 
17:411:32263:28:29:72:532:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:some remedial treatment (summer school and retention) and future achievement against current 
17:412:32356:29:28:72:515:538:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:test performance, Figures 4 and 5 allow this visual identification.12  Each figure shows three 
17:413:32451:28:28:72:528:510:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:relationships: (a) the probability of receiving remedial treatment (summer school or retention); 
17:414:32548:28:29:72:527:482:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:(b) the reading performance of students in the following year; and (c) the math performance in 
17:415:32643:29:28:72:171:453:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the following year.   
17:416:32665:28:28:108:519:425:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: For example, in Figure 4, we see that the probability of attending summer school and 
17:417:32750:28:29:72:520:397:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:being retained drops sharply at the cutoff for promotion in the third grade.  At the same time, 
17:418:32846:29:28:72:536:368:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:next year reading and math achievement drop sharply around the cutoff, suggesting that summer 
17:419:32940:28:28:72:518:340:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:school and retention had a net positive effect for third graders.  In contrast to third grade, the 
17:420:33039:28:29:72:538:312:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:continuous linear trends in future performance among sixth graders (in Figure 5) suggest that the 
17:421:33137:29:28:72:526:283:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:summer school and retention had no substantial effect on the performance of students near the 
17:422:33231:28:28:72:107:255:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:cutoff. 
17:423:33239:28:28:108:505:227:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: Though the graphs lend transparency to the analysis, it is important to quantify the 
17:424:33324:28:29:72:525:199:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:magnitude and the statistical precision of the estimates.  We examine the subset of the student 
17:425:33420:29:60:72:535:170:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:population for which only the reading cutoff is binding (i.e., students who passed math and only 
17:426:33517:60:8:216:219:110:122:g_d0_f63:122:g_d0_f63:?:                                                      
17:427:33570:8:16:72:538:102:42:g_d0_f64:99:g_d0_f65:F:12 Note that these graphs reduce the dimensionality of the problem by limiting the sample to students who passed the 
17:428:33687:16:12:72:521:86:99:g_d0_f65:99:g_d0_f65:F:standards in math.  The thinness of data in some cells makes identification off of three-dimensional graphs quite 
17:429:33801:12:0:72:109:74:99:g_d0_f65:99:g_d0_f65:F:difficult. 
18:430:33812:0:28:72:519:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:need to pass reading to avoid treatment).13  Unless otherwise mentioned, the sample includes 
18:431:33905:28:28:72:535:680:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:students who were in the third or sixth grades in 1997, 1998, or 1999.  For all specifications, we 
18:432:34004:28:29:72:199:652:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:include year fixed effects. 
18:433:34032:29:28:108:524:623:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: The results in Table 2 correspond to the effects displayed in Figures 4 and 5.  The first 
18:434:34122:28:28:72:521:595:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:column presents OLS results and the second column shows the IV results associated with the 
18:435:34213:28:29:72:531:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:third difference specification described earlier.  We see that there are no statistically significant 
18:436:34315:29:28:72:504:538:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:differences between the OLS and IV estimates, although the IV point estimates tend to be 
18:437:34404:28:28:72:533:510:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:somewhat larger than the OLS estimates.  This suggests that June waivers were given randomly 
18:438:34497:28:29:72:525:482:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:or on the basis of characteristics that were uncorrelated with future performance (to the extent 
18:439:34594:29:28:72:529:453:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:that the IV estimates are in fact larger, one would conclude that waivers were given to students 
18:440:34691:28:28:72:516:425:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:with positive unobservable characteristics).  Column 3 shows IV estimates that control for a 
18:441:34784:28:29:72:532:397:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:detailed set of student characteristics, including prior math and reading test scores, race gender, 
18:442:34884:29:28:72:542:368:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:special education status, neighborhood poverty and free lunch status.  The estimates in columns 2 
18:443:34982:28:28:72:543:340:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and 3 are virtually identical, providing additional evidence that our instruments may be valid.        
18:444:35085:28:29:108:486:312:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:  Summer school and grade retention have a positive net impact on third grade 
18:445:35163:29:28:72:539:283:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:achievement in math as well as reading.  In the first year, this effect was roughly 0.11-0.13 logits 
18:446:35264:28:28:72:511:255:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:in the context of average third grade achievement gains of 0.68 and 0.42 logits in math and 
18:447:35356:28:28:72:513:227:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:reading respectively.  This means that summer school and grade retention increased student 
18:448:35447:28:29:72:510:199:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:achievement roughly 20 percent of a year’s worth of learning.  By the second year after the 
18:449:35539:29:28:72:541:170:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:program, the effects had faded by roughly 25 to 40 percent, but were still statistically significant.  
18:450:35642:28:32:72:538:142:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:This is consistent with the fadeout of program effects found in other evaluations (Barnett 1995).  
18:451:35741:32:8:216:219:110:122:g_d0_f63:122:g_d0_f63:?:                                                      
18:452:35794:8:16:72:535:102:42:g_d0_f64:99:g_d0_f65:F:13 We focus on students for whom the reading cutoff was binding because many more students failed on the account 
18:453:35907:16:12:72:529:86:99:g_d0_f65:99:g_d0_f65:F:of reading than mathematics.  In Table 3, we show results for students who passed reading and for whom the math 
18:454:36019:12:0:72:151:74:99:g_d0_f65:99:g_d0_f65:F:cutoff was binding. 
19:455:36039:0:28:72:534:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:In sixth grade, the picture is much different.  It appears that the net effect of summer school and 
19:456:36139:28:28:72:510:680:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:grade retention for these older students was essentially zero in reading, and close to zero in 
19:457:36234:28:29:72:264:652:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:mathematics, particularly by year two.   
19:458:36275:29:28:108:537:623:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: Table 3 examines the robustness of these estimates to specification and sample choices.  
19:459:36365:28:28:72:542:595:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:The first robustness checks are designed to ensure that our findings are not sensitive to functional 
19:460:36466:28:29:72:480:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:form assumptions.  In the second row we control for third order polynomials in prior 
19:461:36551:29:28:72:542:538:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:achievement.  In the third row, we take advantage of data from pre-policy years to ensure that our 
19:462:36650:28:28:72:510:510:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:findings are not driven by non-linearity in the relationship between initial performance and 
19:463:36743:28:29:72:531:482:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:subsequent achievement.  Intuitively, we subtract the pre-policy third difference estimate of the 
19:464:36841:29:28:72:527:453:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:effect of surpassing the cutoff from the corresponding post-policy estimate.  If the relationship 
19:465:36939:28:28:72:539:425:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:between initial and subsequent performance is stable over time, this fourth difference will ensure 
19:466:37038:28:29:72:521:397:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:that our findings are not driven by non-linearity.14  The fourth row shows estimates using pre-
19:467:37133:29:28:72:537:368:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:policy data and controlling for polynomials of prior ability.  While these estimates differ slightly 
19:468:37234:28:28:72:541:340:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:from the baseline findings, the differences are not significant.  Furthermore, the overall pattern of 
19:469:37336:28:29:72:181:312:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:results stays the same. 
19:470:37360:29:28:108:521:283:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:The final three rows of Table 3 show net effect estimates when we modify the sample 
19:471:37444:28:28:72:529:255:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:under examination.  First, we include only those students with the same test forms to eliminate 
19:472:37540:28:28:72:507:227:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:problems associated with initial performance measures that may not be comparable across 
19:473:37628:28:29:72:537:199:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:students.15  Next, we examine only those students with consistent grade patterns.  This addresses 
19:474:37726:29:37:72:530:170:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:problems of measurement error that may be attributable to the miscoding of grades.  Neither of 
19:475:37821:37:7:216:219:133:122:g_d0_f63:122:g_d0_f63:?:                                                      
19:476:37874:7:17:72:536:126:42:g_d0_f64:99:g_d0_f65:F:14 We implement this strategy by performing IV in which we control for the dummy variable that indicates a student 
19:477:37989:17:12:72:536:109:99:g_d0_f65:99:g_d0_f65:F:surpassed the cutoff and the interaction of this term with reading performance.  Our instruments become the dummy 
19:478:38103:12:11:72:522:97:99:g_d0_f65:99:g_d0_f65:F:variable and interaction term multiplied by another variable that indicates whether the cohort was exposed to the 
19:479:38217:11:7:72:161:86:99:g_d0_f65:99:g_d0_f65:F:accountability policy. 
19:480:38240:7:0:72:509:79:42:g_d0_f64:99:g_d0_f65:F:15 Different test forms are used for different years.  The inclusion of year fixed effects addresses this concern. 
20:481:38355:0:28:72:529:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:these two sample restrictions has any substantive effects on the estimated net effect.  As a final 
20:482:38454:28:28:72:530:680:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:robustness check, we examine those students who passed reading in June and were marginal in 
20:483:38546:28:29:72:530:652:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:math.16  The effect size is slightly larger for third grade reading and somewhat smaller for third 
20:484:38645:29:28:72:463:623:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and sixth grade math.  Overall, these results are similar to our baseline estimates. 
20:485:38730:28:28:108:510:595:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Table 4 examines the heterogeneity of two-year net effects across years and student 
20:486:38814:28:29:72:504:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:subgroups.  The first row shows the aggregate estimates taken from column 3 of Table 2.  
20:487:38903:29:28:72:543:538:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Examining the three cohorts of student to experience the policy, it appears that the 1997 cohort of 
20:488:39003:28:28:72:536:510:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:third graders appears to have experienced somewhat larger positive effects than the later groups, 
20:489:39101:28:29:72:540:482:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:although these differences are not statistically significant.  Top achieving students appear to have 
20:490:39202:29:28:72:534:453:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the experienced the largest gains, although these estimates also have large standard errors.  This 
20:491:39301:28:28:72:535:425:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:may be due to the fact that these students attended summer school, but were not retained.  There 
20:492:39398:28:29:72:499:397:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:are no significant and consistent differences across race, gender or SES.  Overall, the net 
20:493:39490:29:28:72:465:368:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:treatment effect of summer school and grade retention appear fairly homogenous. 
20:494:39570:28:28:72:75:340:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B: 
20:495:39570:28:29:72:254:312:144:g_d0_f60:144:g_d0_f60:C:7.  The Effect of Grade Retention   
20:496:39606:29:28:108:512:283:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:While the June discontinuity allows us to estimate the net treatment effect, the prior 
20:497:39693:28:28:72:505:255:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:literature suggests that the effects of summer school and retention may be quite different.  
20:498:39786:28:28:72:525:227:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Fortunately, the structure of the accountability program in Chicago provides an opportunity to 
20:499:39881:28:29:72:537:199:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:separately identify the causal effect of grade retention.  In order to advance to the next grade, the 
20:500:39983:29:60:72:519:170:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:maximum of a student’s June and August scores must exceed a predetermined cutoff in both 
20:501:40072:60:8:216:219:110:122:g_d0_f63:122:g_d0_f63:?:                                                      
20:502:40125:8:16:72:529:102:42:g_d0_f64:99:g_d0_f65:F:16 We can do this because of the two-dimensional nature of the cutoff.  We do not emphasize these results because 
20:503:40239:16:12:72:527:86:99:g_d0_f65:99:g_d0_f65:F:few students were treated on the basis of math—this reduces our sample size and the precision with which we can 
20:504:40351:12:0:72:194:74:99:g_d0_f65:99:g_d0_f65:F:estimate the treatment effects. 
21:505:40383:0:28:72:523:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:reading and math.  The discontinuity generated by the August cutoff allows us to estimate the 
21:506:40477:28:28:72:468:680:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:impact of grade retention for the group of students who attended summer school.   
21:507:40559:28:29:108:510:652:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Just as we did in estimating the net effects, we can reduce the dimensionality of the 
21:508:40645:29:28:72:532:623:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:problem by considering only students who passed one subject in June and thus only had to pass 
21:509:40739:28:28:72:526:595:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the other subject in August.  This is even more important in the case of the retention estimates 
21:510:40836:28:29:72:508:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:because it allows us to focus on a student’s August score alone.  If we instead focus on the 
21:511:40929:29:28:72:517:538:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:maximum of June and August test scores, it is likely that students who scored just above the 
21:512:41022:28:28:72:508:510:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:cutoff will differ from students who scored just below the cutoff, thus violating the central 
21:513:41116:28:29:72:540:482:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:assumption of a regression discontinuity design.  This is true because students whose June scores 
21:514:41214:29:28:72:526:453:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:exceeded the cutoff never attended summer school, which means that summer school students 
21:515:41304:28:28:72:516:425:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:whose maximum (June and August) score exceeded the cutoff must have improved over the 
21:516:41390:28:29:72:494:397:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:summer.  It is likely that these students were more motivated than those students whose 
21:517:41478:29:28:72:520:368:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:maximum score did not exceed the cutoff.  For this reason, the analysis below focuses on the 
21:518:41571:28:28:72:389:340:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:subset of students who passed math and failed reading in June.17   
21:519:41638:28:29:108:515:312:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: Figures 6 and 7 show the probability of retention and future academic outcomes as a 
21:520:41722:29:28:72:543:283:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:function of August reading scores.  While the probability of retention does not drop sharply at the 
21:521:41822:28:28:72:530:255:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:exact point of the cutoff, we can see that it rapidly decreases over a narrow range of values just 
21:522:41921:28:28:72:536:227:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:below the cutoff.  We will refer to this range as the marginal area.  Figure 6 shows that, for third 
21:523:42022:28:29:72:524:199:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:grade students, future performance is flat or decreasing in the marginal area, consistent with a 
21:524:42119:29:28:72:535:170:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:positive effect of grade retention.  In contrast, Figure 7 presents little evidence that retention has 
21:525:42222:28:44:72:246:142:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:any benefit for sixth grade students. 
21:526:42260:44:8:216:219:98:122:g_d0_f63:122:g_d0_f63:?:                                                      
21:527:42313:8:16:72:539:90:42:g_d0_f64:99:g_d0_f65:F:17 We could also examine individuals who passed reading and failed math in June.  In practice, however, very few of 
21:528:42429:16:0:72:263:74:99:g_d0_f65:99:g_d0_f65:F:these students end up near the cutoff in August. 
22:529:42478:0:28:108:534:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: Because of the fuzzy discontinuity, we cannot limit our analysis to students immediately 
22:530:42567:28:28:72:504:680:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:above and below the cutoff.  However, if we use too broad a range of data, students at the 
22:531:42658:28:29:72:532:652:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:extreme ends of the distribution are unlikely to be comparable, forcing us to rely heavily on our 
22:532:42756:29:28:72:514:623:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:covariates to control for the differences between students.  As a compromise, we focus on a 
22:533:42848:28:28:72:506:595:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:subset of children who scored relatively close to the cutoff on the August exam, including 
22:534:42939:28:29:72:514:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:children who scored from 1 GE below the cutoff to 0.5 GE above the cutoff.18  To ascertain 
22:535:43030:29:28:72:537:538:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:whether students are comparable (conditional on August reading performance), we first estimate 
22:536:43125:28:28:72:525:510:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the retention treatment effect without using additional covariates.  We then estimate the effect 
22:537:43222:28:29:72:532:482:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:controlling for a rich set of prior achievement measures and demographic characteristics.  If the 
22:538:43320:29:28:72:531:453:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:results are insensitive to the inclusion of these covariates, it is likely that the students to the left 
22:539:43425:28:28:72:528:425:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and right of the cutoff are comparable.  In addition, we test whether our estimates are robust to 
22:540:43523:28:29:72:298:397:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:changes in the range of students in the sample. 
22:541:43571:29:28:108:536:368:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: Table 5 reports the coefficients from the first stage, which are as expected.  In particular, 
22:542:43665:28:28:72:521:340:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the coefficient of the marginal reading interaction term is strongly negative for both third and 
22:543:43762:28:29:72:530:312:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:sixth grades.  This confirms that small changes in reading performance in the marginal area are 
22:544:43858:29:28:72:532:283:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:associated with large reductions in the probability of being retained.  The instruments also have 
22:545:43956:28:28:72:530:255:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:strong predictive power; the F-statistic of the instruments is 236 for the third grade cohorts and 
22:546:44055:28:28:72:224:227:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f61:B:150 for the sixth grade cohorts. 
22:547:44087:28:29:108:521:199:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: Table 6 contains the estimated retention treatment effects for students in the third and 
22:548:44176:29:28:72:528:170:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:sixth grades respectively.  We see many of the same patterns as we did for the net effects.  The 
22:549:44273:28:28:72:530:142:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:IV point estimates (shown in column 2) are somewhat larger than the OLS estimates (shown in 
22:550:44365:28:28:72:485:114:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:column 1), suggesting that waivers were given to students with positive unobservable 
22:551:44450:28:8:216:219:86:122:g_d0_f63:122:g_d0_f63:?:                                                      
22:552:44503:8:0:72:499:78:42:g_d0_f64:99:g_d0_f65:F:18 We include a broader range of data below the cutoff in order to effectively estimate the effect of reading 
23:553:44613:0:28:72:519:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:characteristics (note that these differences are not statistically significant.)  The third column 
23:554:44712:28:28:72:532:680:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:shows IV estimates that control for student characteristics.  These estimates are similar to those 
23:555:44811:28:29:72:516:652:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:in column 2, suggesting that the students in our analysis are comparable once we control for 
23:556:44904:29:28:72:194:623:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:August reading ability.    
23:557:44931:28:28:108:540:595:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: The point estimates in Table 6 suggest that retention may not have as powerful a negative 
23:558:45021:28:29:72:530:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:effect on academic achievement as commonly cited in the literature.  The IV estimates indicate 
23:559:45116:29:28:72:529:538:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:that being retained in the third grade actually increases performance the following year by 0.17 
23:560:45213:28:28:72:514:510:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:logits in reading and 0.23 logits in math.  These treatment effects correspond to increases in 
23:561:45308:28:29:72:515:482:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:achievement of 41 and 33 percent of the average annual gain.  By the second year following 
23:562:45399:29:28:72:507:453:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:retention, the math effect has decreased substantially, but is still significant.  The two-year 
23:563:45495:28:28:72:399:425:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:reading effect, however, is not statistically different than zero.          
23:564:45571:28:29:108:540:397:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: While it appears that the retention effects have become more negative by the second year, 
23:565:45661:29:28:72:533:368:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:changes in the policy effect over time are confounded by the changes in student incentives from 
23:566:45757:28:28:72:521:340:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:grade to grade.  One year after third grade, retained students (i.e., those who are repeating the 
23:567:45855:28:29:72:533:312:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:third grade) face high stakes testing again while promoted students (now in the fourth grade) do 
23:568:45952:29:28:72:523:283:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:not.  Two years later, the majority of retained students as well as promoted students face little 
23:569:46050:28:28:72:542:255:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:incentive to perform well on the ITBS exams.  For this reason, the two-year estimates provide the 
23:570:46148:28:28:72:362:227:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:most accurate view of the retention effects for third graders. 
23:571:46211:28:29:108:535:199:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:When we compare sixth grade students one year later, we find no statistically significant 
23:572:46301:29:28:72:538:170:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:differences between the performance of retained and promoted students, despite the fact retained 
23:573:46398:28:28:72:517:142:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:students faced high-stakes testing and the promoted students did not.  It may be the case that 
23:574:46493:28:28:72:534:114:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:negative retention effects were offset by the positive incentive effects.  When we compare these 
23:575:46590:28:12:539:542:86:122:g_d0_f63:122:g_d0_f63:?:                                                                                                                                                                           
23:576:46760:12:0:72:377:74:99:g_d0_f65:99:g_d0_f65:F:performance on the probability of retention at and below the marginal area.  
24:577:46837:0:28:72:529:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:students after two years, the incentives are reversed.  Students who had been promoted in sixth 
24:578:46933:28:28:72:522:680:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:grade are most likely in eighth grade, facing a high-stakes exam once again, whereas retained 
24:579:47027:28:29:72:543:652:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:students are most likely in seventh grade, facing a low-stakes exam.  For this reason, the two-year 
24:580:47127:29:28:72:523:623:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:effects probably reflect an upper bound on any negative retention effects.  And, in fact, we do 
24:581:47223:28:28:72:540:595:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:find that retained students score roughly 0.15 logits (27 percent of an annual learning gain) lower 
24:582:47323:28:29:72:488:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:than promoted students.  However, there is no significant difference between the math 
24:583:47409:29:28:72:305:538:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:achievement of retained and promoted students. 
24:584:47456:28:28:108:536:510:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Table 7 shows the sensitivity of our results to functional form assumptions and choice of 
24:585:47546:28:29:72:525:482:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:samples.  Rows 2 and 3 show how our estimates vary as we control for second and third order 
24:586:47638:29:28:72:534:453:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:polynomials of initial performance.  Our estimates appear robust to these changes.19  Rows 4, 5, 
24:587:47735:28:28:72:531:425:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and 6 show how our estimates change as we use data from broader and narrower ranges around 
24:588:47826:28:29:72:525:397:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the cutoff.  The results do vary somewhat depending on our sample but the differences are not 
24:589:47920:29:28:72:502:368:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:significant and do not change the pattern of results.  The final row shows estimates of the 
24:590:48012:28:28:72:515:340:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:retention treatment effect when we examine students who passed reading and failed math in 
24:591:48102:28:29:72:499:312:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:June.  Our findings in some cases are quite different when we examine this sample.  The 
24:592:48190:29:28:72:528:283:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:difference is significant only for third grade math, however.  In all cases, the standard errors of 
24:593:48290:28:28:72:443:255:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:these estimates are quite large making it difficult to draw strong conclusions. 
24:594:48370:28:28:108:509:227:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:  Table 8 reports the two-year retention effects for various cohorts and sub-samples.  
24:595:48457:28:29:72:520:199:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Several interesting patterns are evident.  First, it appears that the effect of grade retention has 
24:596:48557:29:28:72:528:170:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:improved for later cohorts, although relatively large standard errors make it impossible to state 
24:597:48655:28:28:72:539:142:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:this with a high level of confidence.  This pattern, however, is consistent with the introduction of 
24:598:48756:28:0:72:530:114:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:an after-school tutoring program for retained students starting in 1998.  There are no consistent 
25:599:48854:0:28:72:528:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:or statistically significant differences in the magnitude of the treatment effects by race, gender, 
25:600:48954:28:28:72:210:680:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:SES, or prior achievement.   
25:601:48983:28:29:108:111:652:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: 
25:602:48983:29:29:72:244:623:144:g_d0_f60:144:g_d0_f60:C:8.  The Effect of Summer School  
25:603:49016:29:31:108:518:594:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: In Section 6 we estimated the net effect (Nβ) of summer school and grade retention.  
25:604:49101:31:29:72:530:563:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Using information on the magnitude of the retention treatment effects, we can now back out an 
25:605:49195:29:28:72:514:534:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:estimate of the summer school treatment effect.  Assuming homogeneous treatment, the net 
25:606:49284:28:29:72:300:506:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:effect can be represented in the following way: 
25:607:49332:29:32:72:197:477:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:?:(7) RRSNPβββ+=, 
25:608:49348:32:31:72:533:445:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:where Sβ and Rβ are the summer school and retention treatment effects respectively and RP is 
25:609:49441:31:29:72:530:414:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the probability of being retained conditional on attending summer school.  Hence, to determine 
25:610:49536:29:29:72:511:385:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the separate effect of summer school, we must obtain estimates of the net effect of summer 
25:611:49627:29:32:72:524:356:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:school and grade retention (Sβ), the probability of retention conditional on attending summer 
25:612:49721:32:30:72:367:324:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:school (RP), and the separate effect of grade retention (Rβ).  
25:613:49784:30:29:108:539:294:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: For the net effects, we will use the third difference estimates presented in Table 2.  While 
25:614:49877:29:28:72:515:265:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the probability of retention is simple to calculate empirically, it is important to use the same 
25:615:49974:28:28:72:529:237:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:population that was used to estimate the net effect.  Recall that this group consisted of students 
25:616:50073:28:29:72:508:209:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:who in June passed the promotional cutoff in math and scored just below or just above the 
25:617:50163:29:28:72:534:180:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:promotional cutoff in reading (which we therefore refer to as the June sample).  It can be shown 
25:618:50260:28:28:72:527:152:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:that the conditional probability of retention consistent with our third difference estimate of the 
25:619:50359:28:28:72:201:124:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:net effect is the following: 
25:620:50388:28:8:539:542:96:122:g_d0_f73:122:g_d0_f73:?:                                                                                                                                                                           
25:621:50558:8:0:72:484:88:42:g_d0_f74:99:g_d0_f75:F:19 Because the ITBS exam was not given in August prior to 1997, there it is not possible to observe the

26:638:50802:28:28:72:509:628:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:estimate is the probability of being retained for those students who went to summer school 
26:639:50893:28:29:72:225:600:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:because they missed the cutoff. 
26:640:50925:29:28:108:532:571:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: Finally, we must obtain an estimate of the retention effect, once again taking care to use 
26:641:51016:28:28:72:539:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the same population that was used to determine the net effect.  Unfortunately, the sample used to 
26:642:51114:28:29:72:511:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:estimate the retention effects in Section 7 is somewhat different than the June sample.  The 
26:643:51207:29:28:72:527:486:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:retention effects were estimated using the sample of students who passed the math, but not the 
26:644:51302:28:28:72:525:458:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:reading, cutoff in June, and then scored within a limited range around the reading cutoff (both 
26:645:51398:28:28:72:540:430:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:above and below) in August (which we refer to as the August sample).  In general, this is a lower 
26:646:51496:28:29:72:536:402:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:ability group than the population used to estimate the net effects.  To the extent that the effect of 
26:647:51598:29:28:72:522:373:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:retention is different across the two groups, our estimates of the summer school effect will be 
26:648:51694:28:28:72:541:345:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:biased.  While the nature of our identification strategy prevents us from using the same sample to 
26:649:51793:28:29:72:536:317:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:estimate the net and retention effects, we can attempt to place reasonable bounds on the summer 
26:650:51889:29:28:72:145:288:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:school effect.   
26:651:51906:28:28:108:528:260:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: The middle column in Table 9 presents the summer school effect under the assumption 
26:652:51990:28:29:72:536:232:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:that the retention effect is identical for the June and August samples.  Using the retention effects 
26:653:52091:29:28:72:529:203:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:presented in Table 6, the implied two-year summer school treatment effects range from 0.03 to 
26:654:52185:28:28:72:524:175:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:0.07 logits.  For third grade students, summer school increases reading and math achievement 
26:655:52278:28:29:72:530:147:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:two year later by roughly 12 percent of the average annual learning gain.  For sixth graders, the 
26:656:52376:29:32:72:228:118:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:effects are roughly half as large.

27:661:52840:28:29:72:511:652:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:reasonable bounds on the potential summer school effects, we subtract 0.25 logits from the 
27:662:52931:29:28:72:521:623:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:retention treatment effect for the upper estimates and add 0.25 logits for the lower estimates.  
27:663:53028:28:28:72:514:595:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Depending on our assumption regarding the magnitude of the retention treatment effect, the 
27:664:53119:28:29:72:524:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:implied summer school effects can vary substantially.  Despite this, it appears that even under 
27:665:53215:29:28:72:541:538:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:very pessimistic assumptions, summer school improves performance in mathematics.  In reading, 
27:666:53309:28:28:72:494:510:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the lower bound estimates are close to zero.  Conversely, the upper bound estimates are 
27:667:53397:28:29:72:286:482:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:substantial for reading and for mathematics.

27:669:53442:28:28:72:211:425:144:g_d0_f81:144:g_d0_f4:B:9.  Conclusions   
27:670:53460:28:29:108:527:397:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: As school districts impose tougher standards on students and increasingly hold schools 
27:671:53547:29:28:72:504:368:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:accountable for their performance, there will be a growing need to find effective remedial 
27:672:53638:28:28:72:504:340:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:education programs to help low-achieving students.  The evidence presented in this paper 
27:673:53727:28:29:72:507:312:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:suggests that summer school and grade retention have a modest but positive net impact on 
27:674:53816:29:28:72:533:283:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:achievement scores for third grade students, but little if any effect on academic achievement for 
27:675:53914:28:28:72:524:255:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:sixth grade students.  These findings are robust to various specifications, and do not appear to 
27:676:54011:28:28:72:533:227:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:vary substantially across different groups.   However, these programs do appear to have a larger 
27:677:54108:28:29:72:279:199:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:effect on math than reading achievement.   
27:678:54151:29:28:108:522:170:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: For third grade students, the net effect is a combination of benefits from both summer 
27:679:54238:28:28:72:524:142:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:school and grade retention.  Contrary to conventional wisdom and prior research, we find that 
27:680:54332:28:29:72:539:114:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:retention may actually increase academic achievement for low-achieving third graders.  For sixth 
27:681:54429:29:0:72:529:85:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:grade students, the zero net effects appear to mask a small positive summer school effect and a 
28:682:54525:0:28:72:531:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:negative retention effect.  However, it is also possible that the negative effects for sixth graders 
28:683:54626:28:28:72:458:680:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:are driven by the higher incentives that promoted students face two years later.   
28:684:54709:28:29:108:524:652:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: These finding suggest that school districts that implement policies aimed at increasing 
28:685:54797:29:28:72:539:623:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:standards and accountability can utilize summer school and (to a lesser extent) grade retention to 
28:686:54896:28:28:72:531:595:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:support students who cannot initially meet the new standards.  One limitation of this analysis is 
28:687:54994:28:29:72:513:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:that we were only able to follow students for several years following summer school and/or 
28:688:55085:29:28:72:531:538:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:retention.  It is possible that the summer school benefits will fade and that the long term effects 
28:689:55185:28:28:72:478:510:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:of retention will be worse than the short term effects.  As more time passes from the 
28:690:55271:28:29:72:541:482:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:implementation of the program, it will be possible to examine these possibilities in greater detail.
