3:59:2693:20:21:90:168:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:C:I. Introduction 
3:60:2708:21:20:126:525:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: Thanks  to  extraordinary  and  exponential  improvements  in  data  storage  and 
3:61:2790:20:21:90:525:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:computing  capacities,  it  is  now  possible  to  collect,  manage,  and  analyze  data  in 
3:62:2883:21:21:90:525:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:magnitudes  and  in  manners  that  would  have  been  inconceivable  just  a  short  time  ago. 
3:63:2980:21:21:90:524:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:From 1986 to 2007, the world’s capacity to store data increased from 539 MB per capita 
3:64:3066:21:20:90:525:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to  44,716  MB  per  capita,  with  81  percent  of  that  growth  occurring  over  the  last  seven 
3:65:3167:20:21:90:525:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:years  of  that  time  period  (Hilbert  and  Lopez,  2011).  Over  the  same  time  period, 
3:66:3260:21:21:90:525:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:computing  speed  increased  at  an  even  faster  pace – from  0.09  million  instructions  per 
3:67:3356:21:20:90:524:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:second  on  general-purpose  computers  in  1986  to  239  million  instructions  per  second  in 
3:68:3454:20:21:90:525:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2000  to  28,620  million  instructions  per  second  in  2007  (Hilbert  and  Lopez,  2011).  And 
3:69:3553:21:21:90:524:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:while we do not have comparable statistics for the past seven years, computing speed and 
3:70:3642:21:21:90:323:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:capacity growth has surely continued unabated.  
3:71:3689:21:20:126:525:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: As the world has developed this remarkable capacity to store and analyze data, so 
3:72:3771:20:21:90:524:419:12:g_d0_f3:12:Times New Roman:B:have the world’s governments developed large-scale,  comprehensive  data  files  on  tax 
3:73:3860:21:21:90:525:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:programs,  workforce  information,  benefit  programs,  health,  and  education.  Today,  in 
3:74:3953:21:20:90:525:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:many countries around the world, governments collect, maintain, and store an archive of 
3:75:4041:20:21:90:524:357:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f3:B:information regarding a vast range of behaviors and outcomes over an individual’s entire 
3:76:4130:21:21:90:524:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:lifetime  (Card  et  al,  2010).  Governments have  established  statistical  offices  to  maintain 
3:77:4230:21:20:90:525:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and use  these  data  to  produce official  statistics  about  their  populations. In  the  education 
3:78:4331:20:21:90:524:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:sector,  governments  have  invested  large sums  of  funds  to  develop  longitudinal  data 
3:79:4424:21:21:90:525:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:systems.  For  example,  in  the  United  States,  the  federal  Department  of  Education  has 
3:80:4520:21:21:90:525:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:invested  over  $750  million  to  help  states  build,  populate,  and  maintain  these  data 
3:81:4615:21:20:90:524:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:systems. Much  of  this  innovation  in  the  United States  came  about  as  part  of  school 
3:82:4709:20:21:90:525:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:accountability  systems,  and  accountability  systems  still  provide  the  backbone  for  the 
3:83:4805:21:21:90:294:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:Times New Roman:B:country’s most frequently used databases. 
3:84:4846:21:20:126:525:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:At   the   same   time,   because   administrative data   sets   are   established   for 
3:85:4935:20:21:90:525:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:administrative  purposes,  they  are  not  designed  in  a  manner  that  makes  them  readily 
3:86:5030:21:21:90:524:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:available  for  scholarly  activity. In  many  locations,  the data  sets  are  administered  by 
3:87:5127:21:21:90:525:108:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:officials who also implement the policies for which these data were collected, and those 
3:88:5214:21:0:90:524:87:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:who  control  access  to  the  data  may  not  be  interested  in  evaluation  of  the  policies  they 
4:89:5318:0:21:90:525:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:oversee.  Moreover,  the  structure  of  administrative  data – with  a  set  of  records  for  each 
4:90:5418:21:21:90:525:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:administrative  event,  be  it  a  point  in  time  record  about  school  attendance  or  workforce 
4:91:5519:21:20:90:525:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:participation, a test score, a disciplinary infraction, a residential move, or a class taken – 
4:92:5613:20:21:90:525:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:offers both complications and new opportunities of statistical analysis along a vast range 
4:93:5704:21:21:90:193:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of substantive areas.  
4:94:5726:21:21:126:525:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:While  these  data  are  collected  for  purely administrative  purposes,  they  represent 
4:95:5816:21:20:90:524:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:remarkable new opportunities for expanding our knowledge and, through the conduct of 
4:96:5901:20:21:90:525:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:analyses  with  more  comprehensive  data  and  better  sources  of  exogenous  variation  than 
4:97:5997:21:21:90:525:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:could  typically  be  used  in  times  past, challenging conventional  wisdom  in  many  areas 
4:98:6090:21:20:90:525:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:based on previous research utilizing other sources like surveys. Administrative data also 
4:99:6179:20:21:90:525:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:facilitate  study  of  research  questions  that  have  heretofore  not  been  possible  to  study 
4:100:6278:21:21:90:524:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:credibly at all. Researchers who are able to access these data, especially those able to link 
4:101:6372:21:21:90:525:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:data  across  administrative  domains,  have  the  ability  to  make  extraordinary  scientific 
4:102:6468:21:20:90:525:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:advances by  exploiting  the  population-wide  data  sets  combined  with  the increased 
4:103:6556:20:21:90:525:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:opportunity for  identification  of  causal  effects  through  exogenous  variation  by, for 
4:104:6648:21:21:90:524:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:instance, policy  changes,  natural  disasters,  and  other  shocks  that  affect  some  groups  of 
4:105:6747:21:20:90:525:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:people  but  not  others. In  addition  to  natural  experiments,  these  data  can  facilitate  the 
4:106:6848:20:21:90:525:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:conduct  of  field  experiments,  where  the  subjects  of  short-term  experiments  can  be 
4:107:6941:21:21:90:525:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:followed  administratively  for  a  longer  period  of  time  in  manners  that  would  have  been 
4:108:7040:21:20:90:524:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:impossible or prohibitively expensive to do absent large-scale administratively-collected 
4:109:7130:20:21:90:525:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:data. The  new  insights  from  these  studies  have extraordinary potential  to inform 
4:110:7217:21:21:90:525:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:education  policy  and  practice,  and  we  document  some  cases  where  new  policies have 
4:111:7310:21:21:90:525:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:been based upon  insights  from  these  studies. Indeed,  the  massive  growth  in  the  quality 
4:112:7407:21:20:90:525:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  diversity  of  economic  research  on  educational  topics  is  certainly  related  to  the 
4:113:7504:20:21:90:333:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:increased availability of good administrative data. 
4:114:7555:21:21:126:524:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:This chapter describes some of the benefits and challenges associated with the use 
4:115:7638:21:20:90:525:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of  administrative  data  in  education  research. We  also  offer  specific  case  studies  of  data 
4:116:7739:20:21:90:525:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that have been developed in both the Nordic countries and the United States, and offer an 
4:117:7829:21:21:90:525:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(incomplete)  inventory  of  data  sets  used  by  economists  to  study  education  questions  on 
4:118:7928:21:21:90:259:108:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:every inhabited continent on earth. 
4:119:7963:21:0:126:129:87:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: 
5:120:7964:0:20:90:431:708:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:C:II. The benefits of using administrative data in education research 
5:121:8031:20:21:126:525:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: Administrative  data  sets  are  not  a  panacea.  They  are  limited  to  certain  locations, 
5:122:8126:21:20:90:524:667:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f3:B:which  can decrease generalizability. It’s hard to know whether a research study from 
5:123:8211:20:21:90:525:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Colombia or North Carolina or Norway or Romania will translate into different contexts. 
5:124:8299:21:21:90:525:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Administrative  data  sets  often  measure  variables  in  a  manner  that  is  conducive  to 
5:125:8393:21:21:90:525:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:administration of programs, say, but are not necessarily ideal for research purposes. And 
5:126:8483:21:20:90:524:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:administrative  data  sets  are  not  necessarily  structured  in  a  manner  that  ensures  data 
5:127:8581:20:21:90:385:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:quality similar to the one in purpose-built research data sets.  
5:128:8645:21:21:126:524:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:That   said,   while   traditional   purpose-built data   sets   have   many   strengths, 
5:129:8735:21:20:90:524:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:administrative data  sets  offer  a  number  of  clear  advantages  for  empirical  research  in 
5:130:8832:20:21:90:524:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:education.  One  clear  advantage  involves  the  ability  to  study  population-level  data.  This 
5:131:8932:21:21:90:525:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:ability  offers  a  number  of  remarkable  new  possibilities.  Perhaps  the  most  obvious 
5:132:9025:21:21:90:524:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:involves  statistical  power – in  contrast  to data  sets  with  hundreds  or  thousands  of 
5:133:9118:21:20:90:524:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:observations, administrative data sets with many times that number of observations mean 
5:134:9206:20:21:90:525:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that  it  is  often  (depending  on  research  design)  possible  to  detect  modest  but  meaningful 
5:135:9308:21:21:90:524:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:relationships  with  much  greater  precision  than  was  previously  possible.  But  there  are  at 
5:136:9409:21:20:90:525:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:least  two  other  distinct  advantages  of  administrative  data  that  are  afforded  by  the  large 
5:137:9512:20:21:90:525:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:magnitudes  of  observations.  One  involves  the  ability  to  detect  rare  events  that  might  be 
5:138:9614:21:21:90:525:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:useful  for  identification: In  administrative data  sets,  it  is  often  possible  to  make  twin 
5:139:9715:21:20:90:524:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:comparisons  or  study  children  from  three-child  families;  to  investigate  the  effects  of 
5:140:9813:20:21:90:525:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:extremely rare climatic or seismic events; or to study specific economic events like plant 
5:141:9903:21:21:90:525:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:closures (Card et al, 2010; Roed and Raaum, 2003). In traditional purpose-built data sets, 
5:142:9994:21:21:90:525:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:it  is  rare  to  have  sufficient  numbers  of  observations  to  be  able  to  carry  out  analyses  of 
5:143:10100:21:20:90:525:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:these  types.  Another  major  advantage  of  having  large-scale  administrative  data  is  the 
5:144:10197:20:21:90:525:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:ability  to  study  heterogeneous  effects  of  educational  policies  and  practice:  With  very 
5:145:10295:21:21:90:525:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:large numbers of observations, it becomes possible to see whether the effects are similar 
5:146:10385:21:20:90:525:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:across wildly different  groups of individuals, and if they differ, how they  differ, and for 
5:147:10479:20:21:90:129:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:whom.  
5:148:10485:21:21:126:525:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Allowing   for   new   identification   strategies   and   for   the   ability   to   see   how 
5:149:10581:21:21:90:524:108:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:generalizable results are  across  groups are two major advantages of the population-level 
5:150:10672:21:0:90:524:87:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:nature of administrative data, but they are not the only benefits. Because data coverage is 
6:151:10765:0:21:90:525:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:universal,  it  becomes  feasible  that  one  can  link  administrative  data  from  one  domain 
6:152:10862:21:21:90:524:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(e.g.,  education)  to  data  from  another  domain  (e.g.,  workforce  or  health). While  it  is 
6:153:10961:21:20:90:524:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:certainly  possible  to  compare  across  domains  in non-administrative  settings,  doing  so  is 
6:154:11059:20:21:90:525:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:considerably more difficult because people would have to be purposefully longitudinally 
6:155:11147:21:21:90:525:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:followed,  and  because  a  cross-section  of  educational  data,  say,  and  a  cross-section  of 
6:156:11246:21:21:90:524:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:health   data   may   only   include   some   of   the   same   individuals   by   happenstance. 
6:157:11343:21:20:90:524:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Administrative data, by  virtue of their population-level nature and the  frequency of data 
6:158:11435:20:21:90:525:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:observation, allow the researcher to follow individuals or entities over time, so that there 
6:159:11528:21:21:90:242:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:is a panel structure to the data.  
6:160:11561:21:20:126:524:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Administrative data sets also provide novel types of variables typically not found 
6:161:11644:20:21:90:524:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in  non-administrative  data  (Einav  and  Levin,  2013).  They  can  offer  new  opportunities, 
6:162:11741:21:21:90:525:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:for  instance,  to  look  at  measures  of  delinquency,  of  changing  geographical  location,  of 
6:163:11841:21:21:90:524:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:social  networks,  and  of  health  instances  that  are  nearly  impossible  to  study  in  any  other 
6:164:11945:21:20:90:525:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:manner. The  real-time  nature  of  administrative  data  also  provides new  opportunities  to 
6:165:12040:20:21:90:525:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:study the effects of educational policies and practices that are very recent; and offers the 
6:166:12132:21:21:90:525:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:chance  for  researchers  to  make  their  scholarship  much  more  relevant  to  the  specific 
6:167:12228:21:20:90:525:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:policy decisions that policymakers must make right away than are studies that make use 
6:168:12315:20:21:90:524:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of retrospective information (Einav and Levin, 2013). And of course, natural experiments 
6:169:12403:21:21:90:525:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:need  not  be  rare  events  to  be  better-studied  using  administrative data  sets:  Because 
6:170:12499:21:20:90:525:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:natural  experiments  are  unannounced,  and  often  occur  via  chance  or  quirks,  it  is  very 
6:171:12598:20:21:90:524:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:difficult  to  set  up  a  prospective  study  that  will  permit  the  evaluation  of  a  natural 
6:172:12697:21:21:90:525:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:experiment;  with  administrative  data  that  cover  a  population  and  that  are  recorded 
6:173:12791:21:21:90:525:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regularly, it is much more feasible to ex post identify and study these natural experiments 
6:174:12883:21:20:90:216:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(Roed and Raaum, 2003). 
6:175:12906:20:21:126:525:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The  preceding  description  of  advantages  of  administrative  data  makes  clear  the 
6:176:12995:21:21:90:525:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:benefits  of  these  data  for  identifying  causal  effects.  But  these  data  are  also  highly 
6:177:13094:21:20:90:524:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:beneficial  for  the  identification  of  structural  parameters  of  human  behavior for  multiple 
6:178:13194:20:21:90:525:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reasons.  First  of  all, the  population-level  nature  of  administrative  data  means  that  these 
6:179:13296:21:21:90:525:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:data are representative of a given population. In addition, the administrative data, through 
6:180:13389:21:21:90:525:108:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the variety of records across a set of domains, both simultaneously and over-time, allows 
6:181:13479:21:0:90:525:87:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  structural  analyst  with  the  opportunity  to  simultaneously  model  a  set  of  complex 
7:182:13577:0:21:90:522:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:relationships  that  would  almost  surely  not  be  possible  to  uncover  using  retrospectively-
7:183:13676:21:21:90:524:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:collected data (Roed and Raaum, 2003). The lack of a specific structure of administrative 
7:184:13766:21:20:90:525:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:data can  also facilitate reduced-form analyses, because data that are recorded as a series 
7:185:13858:20:21:90:525:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of  observations  but  without  a  distinct  structure  can  be  rearranged  to  build  rectangular 
7:186:13958:21:21:90:524:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:panel  data  sets  that  have  precisely  the  properties  that  are more ideal  for  the  specific 
7:187:14057:21:21:90:322:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:empirical task at hand (Eivan and Levin, 2013). 
7:188:14104:21:20:126:525:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Another  benefit  of  administrative  data  is  that  data  quality  is  likely  to  be  simply 
7:189:14200:20:21:90:524:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:better than retrospective data collection. Rather than ask people whether they participated 
7:190:14292:21:21:90:525:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in a  given program twenty  years ago, scholars who make use of administrative data can 
7:191:14380:21:20:90:524:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:observe  directly  whether  the  individuals  participated – according  to  the  authorities  who 
7:192:14477:20:21:90:525:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:paid  for  the  participation  and  therefore  had  a  strong  interest  in  correctly  recording  the 
7:193:14580:21:21:90:525:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:occurrence!  Also  because  of  the  mandatory  nature  of  participation  in  the  activities  that 
7:194:14681:21:21:90:525:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:generate  administrative  data,  these  data  are  much  less  likely  to  suffer  from  attrition 
7:195:14780:21:20:90:525:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:problems  or  non-response  problems  than  are  data  collected  through  voluntary  means 
7:196:14872:20:21:90:522:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(Card  et  al.,  2010).  Likewise,  administrative  data  are  likely  to  be  less  subject  to  over-
7:197:14975:21:21:90:310:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reporting or under-reporting of key variables. 
7:198:15021:21:20:126:525:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Administrative  data  also  facilitate  the  study  of  intergenerational  issues.  It  is 
7:199:15112:20:21:90:525:357:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f3:B:possible,  at  least  in  some contexts, to match children’s administrative records to that of 
7:200:15206:21:21:90:525:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:their parents, and even grandparents. While it is certainly possible to purposefully follow 
7:201:15298:21:20:90:525:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:families  longitudinally,  the  risk  of  attrition  is  surely  greater  when  attempting  to  move 
7:202:15399:20:21:90:525:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:from  one generation to  the  next  than  if  it  is  possible  to  directly  match  individuals  using 
7:203:15502:21:21:90:524:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:administrative means (Roed and Raaum, 2003). And, in the case of questions that require 
7:204:15590:21:21:90:525:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:a  long  amount  of  time  to  study  in  real  time  (e.g.,  intergenerational  isssues), the  time 
7:205:15690:21:20:90:525:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:horizon   over   which   intergenerational   questions   may   be   studied   can   be   shrunk 
7:206:15786:20:21:90:276:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:considerably with administrative data. 
7:207:15823:21:21:126:525:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Using administrative data has major practical value as well. Importantly, different 
7:208:15906:21:20:90:525:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:countries have extremely different policy environments. While it is possible that in some 
7:209:15996:20:21:90:525:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:circumstances, a study conducted in Denmark would be just as relevant to Chile as would 
7:210:16084:21:21:90:524:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:be a study conducted in Chile, or vice versa, there are many cases – because of different 
7:211:16173:21:21:90:524:108:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:institutions and different populations – where it makes the most sense to study a specific 
7:212:16263:21:0:90:525:87:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:question in the location where the policy environment is what the researcher most wishes 
8:213:16353:0:21:90:525:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to  study.  And,  of  course,  this  demonstrates  the  real  benefit  of  comparative  work  across 
8:214:16454:21:21:90:524:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:jurisdictions:  If  a  result  is  similar  across  very  different  populations  or  very  different 
8:215:16556:21:20:90:525:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:policy  environments,  this  lends  additional  credence  to  the  idea  that  the  result  is  general. 
8:216:16661:20:21:90:525:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Likewise,   we   can   learn   a   lot   from   studying   how   different are the   outcomes   in 
8:217:16758:21:21:90:525:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:jurisdictions  where  the  policy  environment  is  very  different  from  one  another.  In  sum, 
8:218:16857:21:21:90:525:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:some research is transferrable and we can learn a lot from work done in other countries, 
8:219:16946:21:20:90:525:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:but  other  research  is  best  conducted  locally,  suggesting  a  benefit  to  many  countries 
8:220:17043:20:21:90:524:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:developing,  maintaining, and  sharing  with  researchers  their  administrative  data  (Card  et 
8:221:17140:21:21:90:144:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:al., 2010).  
8:222:17152:21:20:126:525:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:In  summary,  administrative  data  are  more  comprehensive  than  are  purpose-built 
8:223:17239:20:21:90:525:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:survey  data,  and  can  be  collected  with  frequently  far  more  accurate  information. 
8:224:17331:21:21:90:524:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Furthermore, the costs of conducting research with administrative data are much lower as 
8:225:17420:21:21:90:525:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:well,  at  least  once  the  data  systems  are  developed.  Once  data  structures  are  established, 
8:226:17523:21:20:90:525:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:linking  and  extracting  more  records  from  administrative  data  cost  only  the  time  of  the 
8:227:17623:20:21:90:525:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:programmer, and the marginal cost of adding additional individuals or periods of data to 
8:228:17712:21:21:90:525:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the analytical sample is extremely small, suggesting remarkably large economies of scale 
8:229:17801:21:20:90:525:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:associated  with administrative data (Roed and Raaum, 2003). While there are obviously 
8:230:17888:20:21:90:524:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:many  important  roles  for  purpose-built  survey  data – not  least  the  fact  that  only  with 
8:231:17986:21:21:90:524:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:purpose-built data it is possible to study precisely the questions that one wishes to study 
8:232:18078:21:20:90:524:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in exactly the  manner  in  which  one  wishes  to  study  them – it  is  also  evident  that 
8:233:18171:20:21:90:525:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:administrative  data  offer  numerous  new  opportunities  to  conduct  research  on  questions 
8:234:18267:21:21:90:524:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that   were   previously   impossible   to   study,   or   at   least   to   study so well.   Indeed, 
8:235:18369:21:21:90:525:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:administrative  data and  survey  data,  while  sometimes  substitutes,  can  frequently  be 
8:236:18461:21:20:90:525:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:considered complements, as when administrative data can reduce the set of questions that 
8:237:18550:20:21:90:525:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:need  to  be  answered  via  surveys,  or  when  administrative  data  can  be  used  to  serve  as  a 
8:238:18653:21:21:90:524:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:check  on  the  reliability  of  retrospective  information  collected  via  surveys  (Roed  and 
8:239:18750:21:20:90:525:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Raaum,  2003).  Administrative  data  can  also  be  thought  of  as  complementary  to  the 
8:240:18843:20:21:90:525:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:conduct  of  field  experiments,  as  the  costs  of  tracking  and  following  up  with  field 
8:241:18939:21:21:90:525:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:experiment  participants  are  much  lower,  and  the  data  frequently  much  better,  when  the 
8:242:19037:21:21:90:524:108:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:field  experiments  can  be  linked  with  data  collected by governments  for  administrative 
8:243:19131:21:0:90:525:87:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:purposes (Card et al., 2010). For all of these purposes, having a high degree of access to 
9:244:19223:0:21:90:524:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:administrative data  makes  a  wide  range  of  empirical  studies  in  education  more  feasible 
9:245:19320:21:21:90:193:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and more believable. 
9:246:19340:21:14:90:93:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
9:247:19340:14:13:90:176:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:C:III. Case studies 
9:248:19357:13:21:126:129:640:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: 
9:249:19357:21:21:126:524:619:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The  Nordic  countries,  notably  Denmark, Sweden,  Norway, Finland  and  to  some 
9:250:19439:21:20:90:522:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:extent  Iceland, established  administrative  registers  in  the  mid-1960s.  When  population-
9:251:19533:20:21:90:524:578:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:wide  social  security  systems  were established,  there  was  a  need  for  a  unique  personal 
9:252:19630:21:21:90:525:557:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:identifier  in  order  to  follow people across  jobs  and  other  labor  market  states and collect 
9:253:19729:21:21:90:525:536:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:information  on  earned  pension  points.  These population-wide  identifiers  were  then 
9:254:19817:21:20:90:524:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:adopted for all administrative registers from birth registers to cause of death registers, and 
9:255:19911:20:21:90:525:495:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:included in  registers  covering education and labor  market  participation, as  well  as for 
9:256:20003:21:21:90:524:474:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:linking  members  of  families  together.  The  core  of  these  registers  is  thus  the  universal 
9:257:20104:21:20:90:524:453:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:system for identification numbers covering everybody from date of birth (or immigration) 
9:258:20193:20:21:90:525:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and identical across all administrative units. The identification number system was based 
9:259:20283:21:21:90:525:412:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:on the 1960 census and for some of the countries also local (municipality level) registries 
9:260:20375:21:21:90:525:391:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of populations. This also implies then that people born several decades prior to 1960 are 
9:261:20464:21:20:90:524:370:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:covered. And for instance for Norway, a job has been done more recently to uncover time 
9:262:20552:20:21:90:477:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and place of birth, and for some registers and cohorts also parental background.  
9:263:20633:21:21:126:525:329:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The  Nordic  countries  have  established  mechanisms  to  share  these  data  with 
9:264:20717:21:20:90:524:308:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:members  of  the  research  community  for  specific  research  projects,  and  several  research 
9:265:20815:20:21:90:524:288:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:groups  in  each  country  have  now  access  to portions  of  the  register data  linking  some  of 
9:266:20915:21:21:90:524:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:these data sets depending on the focus of research.1 In the case of each research project, 
9:267:21005:21:20:90:525:246:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:both  the  administrative  units  who  administer  the  data  as  well as  the  national Data 
9:268:21098:20:21:90:525:226:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Inspection  Authority must consent  to  the  use  and  matching  of  registers  based  on  a 
9:269:21190:21:21:90:524:205:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:detailed  application  procedure. Since  the  registers  contain  sensitive  and  very  private 
9:270:21286:21:21:90:525:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:information,  the  national  statistical  offices  link  the  registers for  research  purposes  and 
9:271:21387:21:20:90:524:163:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:provide   identification numbers   for   researchers   that   are   different   from   the   actual 
9:272:21487:20:32:90:279:143:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:administrative identification numbers.  
9:273:21526:32:11:234:237:111:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:                                                        
9:274:21581:11:15:90:510:100:8:g_d0_f4:10:Times New Roman:?:1 This overview focus on registers used for research with a focus on education in wide sense and a lot of 
9:275:21686:15:11:90:492:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:register based research using Norwegian data is not included. For instance, Roed and Raaum (2003) 
9:276:21784:11:0:90:501:74:10:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f4:?:describe the collection of registers for one research group focusing mainly on labor market outcomes.  
10:277:21887:0:21:126:524:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:There are some common core data sets in all the Nordic countries such as family 
10:278:21967:21:21:90:524:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:links,  several  education  registers  for  test  scores  at  different  levels,  completed  education 
10:279:22070:21:20:90:525:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:etc.,  and  labor  market  outcomes  and  income.  The  countries do,  however,  differ  to  some 
10:280:22168:20:21:90:524:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:degree when  it  comes  to, for  instance, availability  and  access  to  health  data,  vital 
10:281:22261:21:21:90:524:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:statistics, etc. The Nordic countries also differ in terms of how far back in time data sets 
10:282:22352:21:21:90:525:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:are  linked  and  available  for  potential  research  use.  Of  course,  being  data  collected  for 
10:283:22454:21:20:90:525:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:administrative  purposes,  when  data  are  available  to  study  the  introduction  of  a  given 
10:284:22552:20:21:90:524:564:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f3:B:program or policy, it is generally by good fortune rather than prospective design, and it’s 
10:285:22644:21:21:90:422:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:also the case that many policy programs are unique to each country.  
10:286:22712:21:20:126:525:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:In this section we offer three case studies of some of the data potentially available 
10:287:22798:20:21:90:524:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to  researchers  in  different  jurisdictions,  and  how  they  have  been  used.  Our  case  studies 
10:288:22900:21:21:90:525:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:are  two  Nordic  countries – Norway  and  Sweden – as  well  as  the  state  of Florida.  These 
10:289:22995:21:21:90:525:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:are   not   intended   to   be   complete   overviews,   but   are   rather   examples   of   some 
10:290:23094:21:20:90:524:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:representative uses of administrative registers. When appropriate, we also mention some 
10:291:23181:20:21:90:498:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:complementary work conducted outside of the countries featured in the case studies.

10:294:23273:20:21:125:524:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Most of the research using register based data sets in Norway have exploited the 
10:295:23354:21:21:90:525:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:joint advantages of access to long panels of data combined with parental background and 
10:296:23442:21:20:90:524:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:child  outcomes  along  many  dimensions,  and  the  fact  that  population-wide  data  provides 
10:297:23539:20:21:90:525:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  opportunity  of  using  policy  reforms  back  in  time  for  identifying  causal  effects.  In 
10:298:23640:21:21:90:524:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:education research, one example of this strategy is assessing the causal effect of parental 
10:299:23732:21:21:90:525:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:education on children education exploiting a mandatory school reform for parents (Black, 
10:300:23821:21:20:90:525:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Devereux and Salvanes, 2005a). In this paper, a parent cohort from the late 1940s to the 
10:301:23909:20:21:90:525:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:late  1950s  and  their  children  are  used  to  estimate  the  intergenerational  transmission  of 
10:302:24010:21:21:90:525:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:education, using the panel structure of the data as well as the family links. In addition, a 
10:303:24103:21:20:90:524:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:mandatory school reform rolled out across 700 municipalities in a period of ten years for 
10:304:24192:20:21:90:524:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  parental  generation, which is  used  to  identify  the  causal  effect  of  the  educational 
10:305:24289:21:0:90:525:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:transmission  across  generations.  Due  to  the  population  wide  data  set,  the  analysis  could 
11:306:24391:0:21:90:524:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:also  be  undertaken  for  different  education  subgroups, for  instance  whether  mothers  or 
11:307:24487:21:21:90:474:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:fathers or both were affected by the reform, and for different education levels.2

11:309:24651:20:21:90:524:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:structure following people from birth to adulthood have also been essential in the recent 
11:310:24740:21:21:90:525:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:research using register data in Norway  and the other Nordic countries. Examples of this 
11:311:24829:21:21:90:524:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:line of research is Black, Devereux and Salvanes (2005b, 2007). Both these papers study 
11:312:24917:21:20:90:524:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:family dynamics in the sense of the effect of  family size and birth order,  or child health 
11:313:25010:20:21:90:525:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:on  a  set  of  long  term  outcomes  in  education  and  the  labor  market..  Both  papers  need  to 
11:314:25113:21:21:90:525:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:match  long  term  outcomes  from  a  large  set  of  registers  measuring  adult  outcomes,  such 
11:315:25212:21:20:90:525:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:as  several  measures  of  education  (years  of  education,  completing  high  school,  college 
11:316:25309:20:21:90:525:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:attendance),  as  well  as  outcomes  in  the  labor  market  including  working  and  annual 
11:317:25403:21:21:90:524:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:earnings. In  Norway,  a  person  register  that  links  family  members  to  one  another  by 
11:318:25498:21:21:90:525:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:relationship  facilitates  the  study  of  questions  such  as birth  order  effects  by  family  size

11:320:25691:20:21:90:524:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:use  a  register  of  twins,  including monozygotic  twins,  to  identify  the  effects child  health 
11:321:25793:21:21:90:525:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:on long term outcomes. For child health birth weight was used which required merging in 
11:322:25881:21:20:90:525:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  Norwegian  birth  registry.  Bharadwaj,  Loken  and  Neilson  (2013)  use  a  very  similar 
11:323:25978:20:21:90:524:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:data  set  to  assess  the  effect  on  test  scores  in  school  of  medical  treatment  just  after  birth 
11:324:26087:21:21:90:342:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:for just above or just below very low birth weights.  
11:325:26140:21:20:126:525:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: Early investment and long term outcomes has been another important part of the 
11:326:26219:20:21:90:524:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:agenda for Norwegian researchers using these data sets – especially using family policies 
11:327:26307:21:21:90:524:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:for  identification.  One  of  the  obvious  advantages of using  the  Norwegian  data  register 
11:328:26402:21:21:90:525:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:data  is  that  since  the  data  goes  long  back,  many  of  the  family  policies  and  education 
11:329:26503:21:20:90:524:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:policies  which were part  of the developing  welfare  state  can  be  analyzed. A  notable 
11:330:26594:20:21:90:525:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:example of this approach is Havnes  and Mogstad (2011) who study the long  run effects 
11:331:26680:21:21:90:525:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:Times New Roman:B:on children’s education and labor market outcomes by exploiting the fact that a day care 
11:332:26769:21:20:90:525:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reform was rolled out across municipalities in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Similarly,

11:334:26948:21:29:90:525:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:incentives  to  stay  home  with  children  under  the  age  of  three.  They  assess  the  effect  on

12:339:27375:21:21:90:524:688:12:g_d0_f3:12:Times New Roman:B:driven by mother’s reduced labor force participation. Another reform used for identifying 
12:340:27464:21:20:90:524:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  effect  of  even  earlier  investment  in  children  on  adult  outcomes,  is an extension  of a 
12:341:27564:20:21:90:525:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:maternity  leave  program  that  came  into  force  on  July  1,  1977.  This  sharp cutoff  in 
12:342:27660:21:21:90:524:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:eligibility   depending   on   the   exact   date   of   birth   is   well-suited   for   a   regression 
12:343:27765:21:21:90:524:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:discontinuity design approach (Carneiro, Loken and Salvanes, 2014), and here especially 
12:344:27853:21:20:90:525:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the value of large population-level data is on display, as one requires very large data sets 
12:345:27946:20:21:90:525:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in  order  to  execute very  data  intensive  non-parametric  approaches.  Interestingly,  fairly 
12:346:28044:21:21:90:524:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:Times New Roman:B:strong effects on children’s medium and long term outcomes were found  for  staying 
12:347:28127:21:20:90:524:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:longer  home  after  birth  with  the  mother.  On  the other  hand,  analyzing extensions  of  the 
12:348:28226:20:21:90:524:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:maternity  leave  reform of up  to  one  year  fully  covered  leave,  and  using  the  same 
12:349:28319:21:21:90:524:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:estimating strategy does not seem to give a positive effect on children’s outcomes (Dahl, 
12:350:28407:21:21:90:525:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Loken, Mogstad and Salvanes, 2013). There clearly seem to be decreasing returns also to 
12:351:28495:21:20:90:327:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:this input in the production function of children.  
12:352:28546:20:21:126:524:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: Several   other   strategies have been   exploited   to   assess   the   effect   of   early 
12:353:28638:21:21:90:525:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:investment, especially  related  to  the  effect  of  parental  income, on  in-school  education 
12:354:28733:21:20:90:525:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:outcomes, and a variety  of long-run outcomes. Rege, Telle and Votruba (2011) evaluate 
12:355:28820:20:21:90:524:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the effect on children’s test score in middle school using job loss from mass lay-offs for 
12:356:28910:21:21:90:524:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:identification. They find an asymmetry in the effect of father’s and mother’s job loss – a 
12:357:29000:21:20:90:524:315:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f3:B:negative  effect  on  grade  point  average  in  9th grade for father’s job loss and a positive 
12:358:29095:20:21:90:525:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:effect  of  mothers.  The  authors  interpret  their  results  as  not  an  effect  of  income  but  of 
12:359:29199:21:21:90:524:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:distress  form  job  loss  which  is  strongly  negative  for  men. Black,  Devereux,  Loken  and 
12:360:29297:21:21:90:525:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Salvanes  (2013)  analyze  the  effect  of  child  care  subsidies  on  children’s  long  term 
12:361:29392:21:20:90:525:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:education using a  sharp  discontinuity  in  the  price  of  childcare  in  Norway.  They  find 
12:362:29486:20:21:90:525:212:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f3:B:significant positive effect of the subsidies on children’s middle school performance. This 
12:363:29577:21:21:90:525:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:suggest  a  positive  shock  of  disposable  income  on  children’s  school  performance. 
12:364:29667:21:20:90:524:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Carneiro, Lopez-Garcia, Salvanes and Tominey (2014) use very similar data to assess the 
12:365:29755:20:21:90:524:150:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f3:B:effect of timing and possible dynamic complementarities of parents income on children’s 
12:366:29842:21:21:90:524:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:short   term   and   long   term   outcomes   both   in   completed years   of education   and 
12:367:29937:21:0:90:522:108:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:performance  in  the  labor  market.  The  rich  data  provides  an  opportunity  to  use  non-
13:368:30034:0:21:90:525:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:parametric methods, and supports findings that not only the discounted life time income 
13:369:30120:21:21:90:494:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:but also timing matter, which supports the dynamic complementarities hypothesis.   
13:370:30198:21:20:126:525:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Since  the  early  2000s  grades  in  high  school  and  middle  school have been 
13:371:30279:20:21:90:524:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:available as well as national tests for some years in primary school. The register of school 
13:372:30372:21:21:90:525:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:grades combined with school resources and information on teachers have been exploited 
13:373:30455:21:21:90:525:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to  answer a more  traditional  questions in  the  literature  on  the  economics  of  education. 
13:374:30550:21:20:90:524:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Leuven and Ronning (2011) use grades in middle school to study the effect of class size

13:376:30725:21:21:90:524:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Kirkeboen,  Raaum  and  Salvanes (2011)  use  the  same  pupil  performance  register,  but  a 
13:377:30820:21:20:90:524:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:wider school resource measure and different identification strategy – a local hydro power 
13:378:30909:20:21:90:525:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:plant  tax.  Both  find  small  effects of  resource  use on  children’s  school performance. 
13:379:31002:21:21:90:524:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Thanks to the  population-wide  register  data  comprising  all  pupils  at  a  grade  level,  peer 
13:380:31101:21:21:90:525:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:effects may be identified. Leuven and Ronning (2014) use the same performance register 
13:381:31188:21:20:90:525:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:but  add  in  detailed  information  on  school  grade  mixing.  They  find  positive  effects  on 
13:382:31287:20:21:90:524:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:pupils  mixed  with  older  peers.  Black,  Devereux  and  Salvanes  (2011)  exploit  this  and 
13:383:31383:21:21:90:525:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:assess  the  effect  of  the  quality  of  peers  using  within  school  changes  across  years  in  the 
13:384:31488:21:20:90:525:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:composition  of  pupils.  Using  data  going  longer  back  in  time,  they  are  able  to  assess  the 
13:385:31592:20:21:90:525:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:long  term  peer  effects.  In  another  paper,  Black,  Devereux  and  Salvanes  (2013)  analyze 
13:386:31690:21:21:90:525:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the role of school starting age on cognitive outcomes such as IQ tests for boys at age 18, 
13:387:31781:21:20:90:525:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  for  longer-run  outcomes  such  as  educational  attainment,  teenage  pregnancy,  and 
13:388:31874:20:21:90:524:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:earnings. The important issue in this literature is to separate school starting age from test 
13:389:31968:21:21:90:525:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:age.  Exploiting  variation  in  the  mapping  between  year  and  month  of  birth  and  the  year 
13:390:32068:21:21:90:525:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the military test is taken, allowed the analysis to distinguish the effects of school starting 
13:391:32163:21:20:90:524:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:age  from  pure  age  effects. Findings provide evidence  for  a  very  small  positive  effect  of 
13:392:32262:20:21:90:525:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:starting school younger on IQ scores measured at age 18. In contrast, they find evidence 
13:393:32351:21:21:90:473:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of much larger positive effects of age at test, and these results are very robust.

13:395:32521:20:21:90:525:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:register  data  may  be  helpful  in  making  progress  is  in  answering  the  seemingly  simple 
13:396:32619:21:21:90:525:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:question  of  what are the  returns  to  education?  Exploiting Norwegian  population  panel 
13:397:32711:21:21:90:525:108:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:data   with   nearly   career   long   earnings   histories,   a   detailed   picture   of   the   causal 
13:398:32817:21:0:90:525:87:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:relationship between schooling and earnings over the life cycle can be analyzed (Bhuller, 
14:399:32909:0:21:90:522:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Mogstad, and Salvanes, 2013). These authors estimate internal rates of returns over life-
14:400:32998:21:21:90:524:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:time  earnings  from  age  17  to the mid-60s  for  many  cohorts, and  make  use  of a  direct 
14:401:33093:21:20:90:524:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:measure of life-time earnings instead of approximating earnings using one year or an age 
14:402:33182:20:21:90:525:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:groups,  and  thus, avoiding  the  problems  of Mincer life-cycle  bias.  When  doing  so,  they 
14:403:33278:21:21:90:455:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:find evidence that the estimated returns to schooling are biased downward.  
14:404:33353:21:21:126:525:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Administrative  data  have already  been  in  use, in  particular in the  Scandinavian 
14:405:33438:21:20:90:524:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:countries, for  some  years,  and  the  enhanced  knowledge  from  these  studies  have  already 
14:406:33534:20:21:90:525:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:informed  policies  and  we  are  starting  to  see  the  fruits  of  these  new  insights  in  active 
14:407:33637:21:21:90:524:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:policies.  In  Norway,  the  most  striking  example  is a strong  focus that politicians  have 
14:408:33731:21:20:90:525:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:recently put  on  pre-school  or  early  investment  in  children.  As  a  part  of  a  surge  in the 
14:409:33833:20:21:90:525:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:interest   in   early   investment   in   children   and   children   outcomes,   the   focus   among 
14:410:33935:21:21:90:525:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:researchers  in  Norway  has  been  to  exploit  the  possibility  for  assessing  long-term 
14:411:34028:21:21:90:525:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:outcomes in education and the labor market. Both the effect of maternity leave, a daycare 
14:412:34118:21:20:90:525:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:roll  out  for  preschool  children  as  well  as  other  programs  increasing  for  instance  parents 
14:413:34221:20:21:90:524:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:time use in preschool children, have painted quite a consistent picture of the importance 
14:414:34311:21:21:90:525:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of  early  investment  for  medium  and  long  term  cognitive  outcomes.  These  findings – 
14:415:34403:21:20:90:524:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:together with the international evidence – have informed the public debate and later led to 
14:416:34494:20:21:90:524:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:policy  proving  stronger  incentives  for  more  resource  use  in  for  instance  preschools in 
14:417:34591:21:21:90:525:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Norway. Different from the system in the United States, in the Scandinavian countries the 
14:418:34681:21:20:90:524:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:way  that this  type  of  research  may  penetrate  the  public  debate  and  also  inform  the 
14:419:34776:20:21:90:524:295:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f3:B:ministries  and  politicians,  is  mainly  through  forming  groups  of academic “experts” in a 
14:420:34872:21:21:90:524:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:Times New Roman:B:particular area. The “experts” document the new insights from research in the area,  and 
14:421:34959:21:21:90:525:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:write  a  report  to  the  Government.  In  this  case  a  group  of  experts,  including  economists 
14:422:35061:21:20:90:525:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:who  do  research  on  early  investment  using  administrative  data,  drafted a  review  of  the 
14:423:35160:20:21:90:525:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:findings  and  also  came  up  with  concrete  suggestions  for  how  to  improve  both  the 
14:424:35253:21:21:90:524:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:coverage and quality of preschools in Norway (NOU 2010:8). Based on reports like this a 
14:425:35340:21:20:90:525:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:white  paper  will  be  written  to  the  Parliament  with  suggestion  of  a  law  change  or 
14:426:35435:20:21:90:525:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:suggestion for reallocation of money to preschools. There are also several other examples 
14:427:35525:21:21:90:525:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:for  Norway  of how new  research  based  on  administrative  data  informs politicians and 
14:428:35614:21:21:90:524:108:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:leads to  law  changes  outside  the  area  of  education,  for  instance  from  newly  gained 
14:429:35708:21:0:90:323:87:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:information on how the labor market functions.

15:432:35766:21:20:126:524:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The Swedish data infrastructure is constructed in a very similar way to Norwegian 
15:433:35848:20:21:90:524:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:data described in the section above. The data comes from local and national registers and 
15:434:35936:21:21:90:525:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:is maintained by municipalities and Statistics Sweden. Each Swedish resident is assigned 
15:435:36024:21:21:90:525:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:a  unique  and  permanent  identification  number  at  the  time  of  their  birth  and  each 
15:436:36118:21:20:90:525:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:immigrant  is  assigned  a  similar  number  if  they immigrate  to  Sweden  for  more  than  6 
15:437:36214:20:21:90:524:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:months.3 These unique numbers are recorded in every administrative database, be it local 
15:438:36302:21:21:90:525:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:or national, and allow merging different registers together. They are also used in surveys 
15:439:36392:21:20:90:524:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and experimental studies (Meghir and Palme, 2005; Hinnerich, Hoglin and Johannesson, 
15:440:36476:20:21:90:524:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2011; Fredriksson, Ockert and Oosterbeek, 2013; Golsteyn, Gronqvist and Lindahl, 2014; 
15:441:36563:21:21:90:260:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Jalava, Joensen and Pellas, 2015)4. 
15:442:36597:21:21:126:524:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Historically  Sweden  conducted  only  population  censuses  at  national  level and 
15:443:36681:21:20:90:525:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:maintained birth and death records at parish level. Similar to Norway, this changed in the 
15:444:36772:20:21:90:525:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:1960s  when  Statistics  Sweden  (SCB)  started  building  their  registry  data.  Today  SCB 
15:445:36866:21:21:90:525:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:maintains  four  core  registers  that  together  contain  more  than  50  different  thematically 
15:446:36965:21:20:90:524:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:focused  sub-registers.  These  four  core  data  sets  cover  population  (e.g.  employment  or 
15:447:37062:20:21:90:525:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:education  registers),  activity  (e.g.  earnings  or  pupils  registers),  real  estate  (e.g.  prices  or 
15:448:37170:21:21:90:524:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:GIS  registers)  and  business  (e.g.  patent  or  schools  registers). In  addition  to  these  SCB 
15:449:37270:21:20:90:525:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:registers, the National Board of Health and Welfare maintains more than 70 registers with 
15:450:37360:20:21:90:524:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:individual  level  medical  diagnoses5.  The  registers  are  accessible  to  research  community 
15:451:37458:21:21:90:524:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:through Statistics  Sweden,  various  research  institutes  (e.g.,  the  Research  Institute  in 
15:452:37555:21:21:90:525:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Industrial Economics, or IFN) or governmental agencies (e.g., the Institute for Evaluation 
15:453:37645:21:20:90:524:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of Labour Market in Education Policy, or IFAU). Access is granted on project-by-project 
15:454:37732:20:21:90:525:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:basis  and  each  application  undergoes  detailed  investigation.  Different  registers  are 
15:455:37826:21:21:90:525:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:merged  by  SCB  and  researchers  obtain  data  sets  with  a  new  unique,  but  randomly 
15:456:37918:21:27:90:251:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:generated, individual identifiers.

15:458:38008:7:16:90:503:136:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:3 When the system was created in the 1960s all the living Swedes were also assigned unique identifiers 
15:459:38110:16:7:90:156:120:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:retrospectively.  
15:460:38127:7:16:90:512:113:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:4 Jalava, Joensen and Pellas (2015) evaluate short term effects of experimental intervention in Stockholm 
15:461:38232:16:7:90:478:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:schools, and their subsequent research will merge in registry data to study longer-run outcomes.  
15:462:38328:7:16:90:486:90:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:5 Similar data exist in a number of locations including Manitoba (Currie et al., 2010) and Denmark 
15:463:38423:16:0:90:262:74:10:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:?:(Dalsgaard, Nielsen and Simonsen, 2014). 
16:464:38465:0:21:126:525:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Due   to   security   and   data   management   reasons   SCB   maintains   different 
16:465:38551:21:21:90:524:688:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f3:B:educational databases under different “big registers”, and hence for a given project these 
16:466:38642:21:20:90:525:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:need  to  be  merged  with  one  another.  For  instance,  Fredriksson,  Ockert  and  Oosterbeek 
16:467:38739:20:21:90:525:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(2013) investigate the long-run effects of class size, and their baseline data set is actually 
16:468:38833:21:21:90:524:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:a purpose-built  longitudinal  survey  run  by  the  Department  of  Education  at  Gothenburg 
16:469:38927:21:21:90:524:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:University.  However,  since  the  subjects in this  survey  all  have  unique  identification 
16:470:39021:21:20:90:525:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:numbers  it  is  possible  to  link  them  back  to  other  administrative  data  sources.  In 
16:471:39116:20:21:90:525:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:particular,  the  authors  add  data  on  class  size  from  class  registers,  parental  information 
16:472:39218:21:21:90:525:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:from  multigenerational  registers,  medium-term  achievement  from  compulsory  school 
16:473:39306:21:20:90:524:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:pupil registers and military draft registers, completed education from education registers, 
16:474:39397:20:21:90:525:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:earnings from statement of earnings registers and wages from wages and staff for public 
16:475:39484:21:21:90:524:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and   private   sector registers.   On   the   one   hand,   this   decomposition   illustrates   the 
16:476:39585:21:21:90:525:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:complexity  of  the  data  structure  and  emphasizes  the  crucial  role  of  unique  personal 
16:477:39681:21:20:90:524:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:identifier. On the other hand, such a complex structure enhances the security of the very 
16:478:39771:20:21:90:448:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:sensitive personal information and improves the management of the data.  
16:479:39843:21:21:126:525:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The  long  panels  and  retrospective  assignment  of  unique  individual  identifiers 
16:480:39930:21:20:90:525:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:allow studying lifecycle and multigenerational effects also in the case of Sweden. Meghir 
16:481:40020:20:21:90:525:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and Palme (2005) study the effects of comprehensive schooling reform that among other 
16:482:40106:21:21:90:525:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:elements  increased  the  length  of  compulsory  schooling,  and  was  introduced  in  the  late 
16:483:40204:21:20:90:525:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:1940s. They utilize survey data on two cohorts that are then linked to registry data which 
16:484:40294:20:21:90:525:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:provide  individual  educational  attainment  and  earnings.  Meghir,  Palme  and  Schnabel 
16:485:40386:21:21:90:525:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(2012)  utilize  the  same  reform,  richer  data  set and  show  that  it  not  only  reduces  the 
16:486:40485:21:21:90:524:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:criminal  activity of  the  treated  generation  but  also  of  their  children.  Even  more  data 
16:487:40583:21:20:90:525:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:demanding  endeavor  is  undertaken  by  Palme  et  al.  (2015)  where  they  combine  Swedish 
16:488:40678:20:21:90:525:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:registers  and  historical  survey  records  to  estimate  the  intergenerational  persistence  of 
16:489:40777:21:21:90:465:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:human capital, measured by educational attainment, across four generations.   
16:490:40854:21:20:126:524:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Both  Norway  and  Sweden  share  two  very  unique  and  purpose  built  data  sets: 
16:491:40940:20:21:90:522:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:military assessment and adoptions. The former one provides physical, cognitive and non-
16:492:41027:21:0:90:525:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:cognitive  assessment  of  all  males  at  the  age  of  18-19  (Lundborg,  Nilsson  and  Rooth, 
17:493:41126:0:21:90:524:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2014)6. The latter one contains all persons who were born in Sweden between 1962 and 
17:494:41211:21:21:90:524:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:1996  and  adopted  by  both  parents  (Bjorklund,  Lindahl  and  Plug,  2006;  Holmlund, 
17:495:41301:21:20:90:525:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Lindahl  and  Plug,  2011)7.  Together  with  the  ability  to  link  these  data  to  population 
17:496:41399:20:21:90:525:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:registers they provide social scientists with extremely powerful analytical tool. There are 
17:497:41491:21:21:90:525:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:also  several  other  purpose  built  survey  data  sets  in  Sweden.  Fredriksson,  Ockert  and 
17:498:41588:21:21:90:525:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Oosterbeek  (2013)  use the Gothenburg  University panel  mentioned  above containing 
17:499:41672:21:20:90:525:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:cognitive  test  scores  for  13  year  olds.  Golsteyn,  Gronqvist  and  Lindahl  (2014)  use the

17:502:41950:21:20:90:524:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:conclude  that  adolescent  time  preferences  predict  outcomes  up  to  five  decades later  in

17:505:42129:21:21:90:524:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:empirical studies on the intersection of family, health, education and labor markets, there 
17:506:42221:21:20:90:525:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:are still many challenges in carrying out this research in reality. The two main obstacles 
17:507:42311:20:21:90:525:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in  educational  research are  that  authorities  tend  to  be  reluctant  to  allow  the  conduct  of 
17:508:42414:21:21:90:524:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:field  experiments,  as  well  as  the  lack  of  longitudinal  assessment  data.  Scandinavia, 
17:509:42510:21:20:90:525:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:including  Sweden, lags  far  behind the  United  States in  the  implementation  of  the  field 
17:510:42604:20:21:90:525:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:experiments  related  to  student  incentives  (Fryer,  2014),  student  support  (Cook  et  al., 
17:511:42702:21:21:90:525:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2014),  teacher  incentives  (Imberman  and  Lovenheim, 2015),  school  choice  (Deming  et 
17:512:42794:21:20:90:525:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:al.,  2014)  or  school  management  (Fryer, 2014).  Given  the  problems  with  tracking 
17:513:42884:20:21:90:524:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:students   over   time   in   the   United   States,   the   Scandinavian   administrative   data 
17:514:42982:21:21:90:524:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:infrastructure is ideal to study long-run consequences and potential positive and negative 
17:515:43073:21:21:90:525:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:spillovers  of  policy  interventions,  and  field  experiments  are  current  gold  standard  in 
17:516:43171:21:20:90:182:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:policy evaluation.  
17:517:43190:20:21:126:525:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:That said, the Scandinavian countries do have a fair degree of assessment data of 
17:518:43272:21:21:90:525:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:late. Sweden, similar to  Denmark  and Norway, introduced in  recent  years some form of 
17:519:43361:21:20:90:524:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:longitudinal  assessments  in  their  compulsory  schools.  The  longitudinal  assessment  data 
17:520:43457:20:30:90:525:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in Sweden began in 2009 and comprise of tests  given in  grades three, six and nine. The 
17:521:43546:30:7:234:237:120:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:                                                        
17:522:43601:7:16:90:519:113:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:6 Since the mid 2000s the draft is no longer mandatory in Sweden so the data does not provide information 
17:523:43705:16:12:90:499:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:on the whole population. The draft continues to be mandatory in Norway. Finland has also mandatory 
17:524:43804:12:7:90:303:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:military draft (Kerr, Pekkarinen and Uusitalo, 2013). 
17:525:43857:7:0:90:356:78:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:7 The register is now expanded to cover more recent birth cohorts. 
18:526:43924:0:21:90:525:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:assessment data in grades 3 and 6 have not been widely used in research thus far8. Before 
18:527:44014:21:21:90:524:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:this reform Swedish students were only assessed at the age 16. These data on compulsory 
18:528:44102:21:20:90:525:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:school  exit  exams  are  available  since  1988,  and  have  been  often  used,  for  example  by 
18:529:44201:20:21:90:525:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Almond,  Edlund  and  Palme  (2009)  who  study  the  effects  of  prenatal  exposure  to 
18:530:44291:21:21:90:525:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:radioactive fallout on school outcomes. It is worth noting that unlike in the United States 
18:531:44382:21:21:90:525:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:all  tests  in  Scandinavian  countries  are  low  stakes  and  the  Swedish  Education  Agency 
18:532:44478:21:20:90:525:584:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:explicitly states that they “... are not examination, but should be part of the teacher 
18:533:44566:20:21:90:524:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:Times New Roman:B:information about student’s knowledge...” In  fact,  except  for  Stockholm  and  Malmo, 
18:534:44655:21:21:90:525:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:these  virtually  do  not  matter  for  high  school  admissions  as  children  are  guaranteed  a 
18:535:44754:21:20:90:347:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:place in their closest high school (Karbownik, 2014). 
18:536:44807:20:21:126:524:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Sweden  and  Denmark,  unlike  Norway,  have  also  implemented  a  large-scale 
18:537:44887:21:21:90:524:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:refugee  placement  policy  in  a  nearly  random  way.  The  placement  assignment  could  be 
18:538:44982:21:21:90:525:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:seen as random conditional on observables because the individual could not choose their 
18:539:45070:21:20:90:525:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:first  place  of  residence  and  there  was  no  direct  interaction  between  a  refugee  and 
18:540:45166:20:21:90:524:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:placement  officers.  This  does  not  guarantee  that  immigrants  were  randomly  assigned  to 
18:541:45263:21:21:90:525:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:neighborhoods,  in  fact  they  were  not,  but  the  placement  selection  was  based  on 
18:542:45354:21:20:90:525:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:observable attributes of immigrants and these are all available in administrative data. This 
18:543:45447:20:21:90:524:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:policy  has  been  extensively  studied  not  only  for  its  labor  market  consequences  for 
18:544:45542:21:21:90:525:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:immigrants themselves (Edin, Fredriksson and Aslund, 2003) but also for the educational 
18:545:45630:21:20:90:348:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:consequences of their children (Aslund et al., 2011)9. 
18:546:45684:20:21:126:525:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Sweden  is  also  the  only  one  of  the Scandinavian  countries  that  introduced  some 
18:547:45773:21:21:90:525:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:form of charter schools. Unlike in the US these have not been introduced with a random 
18:548:45860:21:21:90:524:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:component   and   allow   only   for   differences-in-differences   type   of   identification. 
18:549:45956:21:20:90:525:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Sandstrom  and  Bergsrton  (2005)  study  the  effects  of  the  reform,  and  the  competition  it 
18:550:46056:20:21:90:525:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:induces,  on  quality  of  public  schools.  Bohlmark  and  Lindahl  (2015)  study  its  long-run 
18:551:46154:21:21:90:525:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:consequences.  Hensvik  (2012)  utilized  the  same  reform  to  understand  how  competition 
18:552:46248:21:27:90:525:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:affects  teacher  mobility  and  wages.  Wikstrom  and  Wikstrom  (2005)  document  that 
18:553:46337:27:7:234:237:143:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:                                                        
18:554:46392:7:16:90:523:136:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:8 Raw scores are not kept by the authorities and for the early schooling test it is only the pass/fail indicator 
18:555:46504:16:12:90:524:120:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:that is recorded in the registers. Although, from research perspective the more continuous score measure is 
18:556:46611:12:11:90:524:108:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:very valuable this is a clear example  where the research needs do not cross with the administrative  needs, 
18:557:46720:11:7:90:496:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:and indeed this data serves primarily administrative purposes for which a binary coding is sufficient.  
18:558:46821:7:16:90:517:90:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:9 The Danish study uses the placement policy to study the effects of early exposure to neighborhood crime 
18:559:46926:16:0:90:395:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:on subsequent criminal behavior of the youth (Damm and Dustmann, 2014) 
19:560:46998:0:21:90:525:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:school  competition  leads  to  grade  inflation,  and  that  voucher  schools  inflate  their 
19:561:47093:21:21:90:525:688:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:students’ grades more heavily. Sweden has also introduced two other market oriented 
19:562:47177:21:20:90:525:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:educational  reforms  that  have  been  evaluated  by  researchers.  The  first  transferred  the 
19:563:47275:20:21:90:525:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:funding responsibilities from central government to local municipalities (Fredriksson and 
19:564:47365:21:21:90:525:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Ockert,  2008).  The  second  allowed  individual  level  wage  bargaining  between  teachers 
19:565:47459:21:21:90:525:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  principals  (Bohlmark,  Gronqvist  and  Vlachos, 2012).  Yet  another  school  choice 
19:566:47549:21:20:90:525:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reform  was  introduced  in  Stockholm  in  2000,  and  changed  the  high  school  admission 
19:567:47643:20:21:90:525:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:system  from  one  largely  based  on  place  of  residence  to  another  entirely  based  on 
19:568:47737:21:21:90:525:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:compulsory school performance i.e. change from zoning to open enrollment. Soderstrom 
19:569:47822:21:20:90:525:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and   Uusitalo   (2010)   document   that   the   reform   lead   to   sharp   changes   in   student 
19:570:47924:20:21:90:525:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:composition in Stockholm schools, while Karbownik (2014) shows that these changes in 
19:571:48009:21:21:90:356:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:student quality lead to changes in teacher labor supply. 
19:572:48065:21:21:90:93:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
19:573:48065:21:20:90:143:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:C:C. Florida 
19:574:48075:20:21:126:525:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Due to the decentralized nature of education in the United States, there exists no 
19:575:48158:21:21:90:525:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:prospect of national educational data records, at least in the foreseeable future. However, 
19:576:48250:21:20:90:525:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:a number of states and school districts have established systems in which students can be 
19:577:48340:20:21:90:525:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:followed  longitudinally  and  matched  to  schools  and,  in  some  cases,  their  teachers  over 
19:578:48439:21:21:90:524:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:time.  The  three  states  with  the  longest-standing  state  level  student  longitudinal  data 
19:579:48537:21:20:90:525:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:systems  that  have  been  widely  available  for  researchers  are  Florida,  North  Carolina  and 
19:580:48637:20:21:90:124:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Texas. 
19:581:48643:21:21:126:525:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: Florida   has   maintained   statewide   records   of   student   test   scores   that   are 
19:582:48736:21:21:90:525:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:longitudinally  comparable  (initially  in  grades  4,  5,  8,  and  10,  and  soon  thereafter 
19:583:48832:21:20:90:525:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:expanded  to  grades  3  through  10)  since  the  1997-98  school  year  within  its Education 
19:584:48928:20:21:90:525:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Data Warehouse (EDW). The EDW also includes information on high school graduation, 
19:585:49011:21:21:90:525:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:grade  retention,  student  attendance,  disciplinary  infractions,  school  assignments,  home 
19:586:49107:21:20:90:524:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:language,  immigrant  status,  disability,  race/ethnicity,  gender,  school  transcripts,  and  a 
19:587:49206:20:21:90:525:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:measure  of  student  poverty,  along  with  other  measures.  Florida  assigns  a  unique 
19:588:49297:21:21:90:525:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:identification number that remains with the student no matter which school district he or 
19:589:49387:21:0:90:524:108:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:she attends within the state. Since 2001-02, Florida has linked students with their teachers 
20:590:49482:0:21:90:524:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in each class – permitting the matching of staff databases that include teacher credentials 
20:591:49573:21:21:90:172:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to their students. 
20:592:49591:21:20:126:524:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: A large number of papers have made use of these student-level longitudinal data 
20:593:49671:20:21:90:525:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to  study  a  wide  range  of  research  questions.  For  example,  Chiang  (2009),  Figlio  and 
20:594:49768:21:21:90:525:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Rouse  (2006),  Rouse  et  al.  (2013),  and  West  and  Peterson  (2006)  identify  the  effects  of 
20:595:49870:21:21:90:524:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:changing  school-level  accountability  pressure  on  student  test  performance  in  public 
20:596:49963:21:20:90:525:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:schools,   and   Figlio   and   Lucas   (2004)   investigate   the   degree   to   which   school 
20:597:50061:20:21:90:525:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:accountability policies affect student sorting across schools. Sass (2006) and Booker et al. 
20:598:50154:21:21:90:525:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(2011)  study  the  effects  of  charter  schools  on  test  scores  and  later  outcomes.  Figlio  and 
20:599:50258:21:20:90:524:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Hart  (2014)  measure  the  degree  to  which public  schools  respond  to  the  competitive 
20:600:50350:20:21:90:525:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:pressure associated with school voucher systems. Harris and Sass (2011) study the effects 
20:601:50440:21:21:90:524:481:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f3:B:of a variety of teacher qualifications and in-service training on teachers’ contributions to 
20:602:50533:21:21:90:524:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:student   achievement,   while   Chingos   and   West   (2012)   investigate   the   relationship 
20:603:50631:21:20:90:525:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:between  measured  teacher  value  added  and  labor  market  returns  when  those  teachers 
20:604:50724:20:21:90:524:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:leave  teaching.  Winters  and  Greene  (2012)  study  the  effects  of  a  test-based  promotion 
20:605:50822:21:21:90:524:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:policy.  Schwerdt  and  West  (2013)  evaluate  the  role  of  grade  configuration  on  student 
20:606:50919:21:20:90:467:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:outcomes. Burke and Sass (2013) identify classroom peer effect relationships. 
20:607:50996:20:21:126:525:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: The  Florida  Department  of  Education,  in  conjunction  with  other  state  of  Florida 
20:608:51087:21:21:90:525:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:agencies, has successfully linked K-12 data with a variety of post-secondary data sources, 
20:609:51177:21:20:90:524:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:including   information   on post-secondary   education   and   training,   employment   and 
20:610:51269:20:21:90:525:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:earnings  records,  military  service  and  criminal  justice  records.  These  matched data  sets, 
20:611:51369:21:21:90:525:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:known as the Florida Education and Training Placement Information Program (FETPIP),

20:613:51548:21:20:90:522:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:cohort,  so  earnings  data  are  now  available  for  individuals  as  late  as  their  early  mid-
20:614:51648:20:21:90:524:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:careers. A number of important papers have been written that have linked FETPIP data to 
20:615:51736:21:21:90:525:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:K-12 education records.  For instance, Clark and  Martorell (2014)  compare labor market 
20:616:51825:21:20:90:525:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:outcomes  of  students  who  barely  passed  high  school  graduation  examinations  to  those 
20:617:51920:20:21:90:525:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:who  barely  failed  these  examinations  to  identify  the  degree  to  which  a  high  school 
20:618:52016:21:21:90:525:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:diploma  has  signaling  value  in  the  labor  market.10 Other  papers  follow  people  from  the 
20:619:52114:21:22:90:525:108:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:education data  sets  into  the  labor  market.  In  a  particularly  inventive  use  of  these  data, 
20:620:52217:22:8:234:237:86:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:                                                        
20:621:52272:8:0:90:517:78:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:10 Clark and Martorell (2014) also make use of data from Texas to perform a parallel exercise in that state. 
21:622:52381:0:21:90:524:709:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f3:B:Chingos  and  West  (2012)  relate  teachers  to students’ test scores to obtain measures of 
21:623:52474:21:21:90:525:688:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:teacher “value added”, and then observe whether teachers with higher measured value 
21:624:52558:21:20:90:525:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:added  command  higher  labor  market  earnings  in  the  event  in  which  they  leave  public 
21:625:52654:20:21:90:525:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:school  teaching.  Both  of  these  papers  offer  glimpses  into  the  types  of  analyses  that  are 
21:626:52757:21:21:90:524:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:possible when it is feasible to link education records – both those of students and those of 
21:627:52849:21:21:90:259:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:teachers – to labor market records. 
21:628:52883:21:20:126:525:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: In  recent  years,  it  has  become  possible  to  track  Florida  students  not  just  forward 
21:629:52978:20:21:90:525:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:into  the  labor  market  but  also  backward  to  early  childhood  program  participation  and 
21:630:53075:21:21:90:525:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:birth  records.  For  a  series  of  projects  by  Figlio,  Roth  and  co-authors,  the  Florida 
21:631:53172:21:20:90:524:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Departments of Education and Health have matched the birth records of all children born 
21:632:53260:20:21:90:525:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in  Florida  between  1992  and  2002  to  the  school  records  observed  by  the  Department  of 
21:633:53359:21:21:90:525:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Education. To date, over 1.6 million children’s administrative records have been matched 
21:634:53448:21:21:90:525:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:between  agencies  for  these  research  purposes.11 These  matched  data  have  made  it 
21:635:53537:21:20:90:525:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:possible  to  study  questions  ranging  from  the  educational  consequences  of  poor  neonatal 
21:636:53635:20:21:90:524:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:health (Figlio et al., 2014) through the effects of early interventions for autism spectrum 
21:637:53726:21:21:90:524:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:Times New Roman:B:disorders on children’s educational outcomes (Currie et al., 2014) to the spillover effects 
21:638:53818:21:20:90:525:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of having disabled siblings on children’s cognitive development (Black et al., 2014). The 
21:639:53908:20:21:90:525:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:earliest  of  these  birth  cohorts  are,  at  the  time  of  writing,  old  enough  to  have  graduated 
21:640:54013:21:21:90:525:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:from  high  school,  so  soon  it  will  be  possible  to  follow  children  born  in  Florida  through 
21:641:54117:21:20:90:524:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:their  K-12  schooling  career  and,  thanks  to  the  FETPIP  data,  into  post-secondary 
21:642:54208:20:21:90:443:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:education, the labor market, the military, and the criminal justice system. 
21:643:54283:21:21:126:524:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: These  matched  administrative  data  from  Florida  highlight  some  major  benefits 
21:644:54369:21:21:90:525:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:possible  by  virtue  of  the  fact  that  they  are  drawn  from  population-level  data.  Consider, 
21:645:54471:21:20:90:525:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:for  instance,  the  three  papers  described  in  the  preceding  paragraph:  None  of  these 
21:646:54566:20:21:90:525:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:research projects could have been carried out without the benefit of population-level data 
21:647:54657:21:21:90:525:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:because  they  each  require  large-scale  data  to  study  relatively  rare  events.  Figlio  et  al. 
21:648:54760:21:20:90:524:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(2014)  compare  twin  pairs  with  discordant  birth  weights;  Currie  et  al.  (2014)  study 
21:649:54856:20:30:90:524:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:children  with  autism  spectrum  disorders,  accounting  for  fewer  than  one percent  of  the 
21:650:54952:30:7:234:237:120:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:                                                        
21:651:55007:7:16:90:507:113:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:11 These data sets are linked by name, date of birth, and social security number (a national identification 
21:652:55114:16:12:90:513:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:number). This three-factor linkage allows for much more accurate matching of data across administrative 
21:653:55218:12:11:90:519:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:data domains than would have occurred with fewer linking factors (e.g., name and data of birth alone). See 
21:654:55325:11:0:90:212:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:Figlio et al. (2014) for details. 
22:655:55360:0:21:90:525:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:population; and Black et al. (2014) identify the effects of disabled siblings by comparing 
22:656:55451:21:21:90:524:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the outcomes of first and second-born children in three-plus-sibling families. Traditional 
22:657:55542:21:20:90:525:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:surveys  that  follow  children  and  families  longitudinally  are  not  equipped  to  study  rare 
22:658:55642:20:21:90:524:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:occurrences such as these. With population-level data, many new research programs can 
22:659:55728:21:21:90:525:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:be  launched  at  a  fraction  of  the  cost  of  purpose-built  survey-based  databases,  and  still 
22:660:55830:21:21:90:525:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:more  research  programs  that  were  previously  infeasible  or  impossible  to  undertake  are 
22:661:55927:21:20:90:217:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:now possible to carry out. 
22:662:55953:20:21:126:525:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: These  Florida  data  provide  some  distinct  advantages  over data  sets  observed  in 
22:663:56042:21:21:90:525:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:other  jurisdictions.  The  ability  to  follow  students  longitudinally,  to  observe  frequent 
22:664:56140:21:20:90:525:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:assessment data and other student outcomes, and to link students to teachers – attributes 
22:665:56229:20:21:90:525:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:not found except for very recently in some European registry data – allows researchers to 
22:666:56318:21:21:90:525:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:study  certain  questions  in  the  United  States  that  are  difficult  to  study  in  many  other 
22:667:56419:21:21:90:524:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:jurisdictions. Now that it is possible to link school records to later labor market data, and 
22:668:56513:21:20:90:525:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:backward  to  birth  and  early  childhood  records,  Florida  is  developing  some  attributes  of 
22:669:56613:20:21:90:525:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  registries  found  in  northern  European  countries.  On  the  other  hand,  linked  data  for 
22:670:56714:21:21:90:525:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Florida   children   are   only   available   for   relatively   recently-born   children,   and   no 
22:671:56816:21:20:90:525:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:information about parents, except that observed on a child’s birth records, are currently 
22:672:56906:20:21:90:524:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:linkable to children in Florida. In addition, given the fact that the United States is an open 
22:673:57001:21:21:90:525:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economy  with  high  degrees  of  mobility  across  states,  it  is  natural  that  there  would  be 
22:674:57102:21:20:90:525:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:considerable  attrition  from  even  the  most  complete  records.  For  instance,  the  birth 
22:675:57197:20:21:90:524:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:records-school  records  linked  data  employed  by  Figlio  et  al.  (2014)  and  others  include 
22:676:57296:21:21:90:525:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:only  81  percent  of  the  children  born  in  Florida  between  1992  and  2002;  the  remaining 
22:677:57395:21:21:90:525:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:children  either  left  the  state  of  Florida  or  enrolled  in  private  schools  and  never  were 
22:678:57497:21:20:90:524:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:included  in  the  public  school  records.  While  careful  checks  of other  data  sources  make 
22:679:57595:20:21:90:525:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:clear  that  virtually  all  of  the  children  whom  one  would  have  expected  to  have  been 
22:680:57692:21:21:90:524:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:matched   between   these data   sets   were   ultimately   matched,   this   highlights   the 
22:681:57787:21:20:90:525:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:shortcomings   of   matched   birth   and   school   records   in   the   United   States   context. 
22:682:57888:20:21:90:522:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Nonetheless,  the  data  from  Florida  highlight  some  of  the  limitless  possible  population-
22:683:57986:21:21:90:524:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:level  research  programs  that  matched  administrative data  sets  could  facilitate  in  the 
22:684:58082:21:0:90:265:108:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:United States and around the world. 
23:685:58119:0:21:126:524:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: As  in  the  Scandinavian  context,  research  using  administrative  data  from  Florida 
23:686:58209:21:21:90:525:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:has led to substantial policy changes. Noteworthy examples include how school voucher 
23:687:58295:21:20:90:525:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:policy in Florida (and in several other states in the United States) has been influenced by 
23:688:58387:20:21:90:525:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:research  documenting  the  effects  of school  vouchers  on  selection,  participation,  and 
23:689:58481:21:21:90:525:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:competition;   and   how   the   state   changed   its   compensation   policies   regarding   the 
23:690:58580:21:21:90:525:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:accumulation  of  teacher  credentials  (in  particular,  National  Board  Certification)  once 
23:691:58676:21:20:90:525:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:research  identified  the  degree  to  which  the  attainment  of  this  credential  influenced – or 
23:692:58776:20:21:90:524:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:failed to influence – teacher performance in the classroom. These examples, coupled with 
23:693:58864:21:21:90:525:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:other  cases  both  in  Florida  as  well  as  around  the  country,  such  as  how  North  Carolina 
23:694:58965:21:20:90:524:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:maintained  an  early  childhood  enrichment  program  when  presented   with  research 
23:695:59053:20:21:90:524:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:evidence  documenting  its  efficacy (Cite,  XX),  or  how  Washington  changed  its  teacher 
23:696:59146:21:21:90:525:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:retention  policies  after  research  showed  the  relatively  limited  relationship  between 
23:697:59240:21:21:90:524:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:teacher experience and value added in the classroom (Cite, XX), demonstrate the ways in 
23:698:59326:21:20:90:525:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:which  administrative  data  in  education  have  not  only  led  to  scholarly  advances  but  also 
23:699:59427:20:21:90:429:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:are beginning to result in research-driven policy and practice changes. 
23:700:59498:21:21:90:93:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
23:701:59498:21:20:90:406:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:C:IV. Challenges associated with the use of administrative data  
23:702:59559:20:21:125:525:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:We  have  so  far  stressed  the  important  advantages of administrative  registers as 
23:703:59644:21:21:90:525:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:compared  to  survey  data - fewer  issues  with  recall  and  other  measurement problems; 
23:704:59733:21:20:90:525:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:since  its population-wide  the  data  set  is  representative; less  problems  with  attrition 
23:705:59827:20:21:90:525:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:compared  to surveys  that  follow  the  sampled  populations  over  time; less  problems  with 
23:706:59921:21:21:90:524:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:non-response;  and  the  ability  to  study  heterogeneous  effects  and  rare  and  infrequent 
23:707:60017:21:21:90:525:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:events.  Combined  with  data  for  public  policies  in  the  past,  many  credible  policy 
23:708:60110:21:20:90:525:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:evaluations  such  as  education  policies  and  family  policies  as  described  above  can  be 
23:709:60207:20:21:90:525:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:analyzed. Complete family links makes it possible to exploit other “experiments” for 
23:710:60292:21:21:90:524:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:identification  such  as  comparing  siblings  and  twins  as  well as  the  use  of  adoptees.  The 
23:711:60393:21:20:90:525:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:long  panel  structure  of  administrative  registers  makes  it  possible  to  assess  the  effects of 
23:712:60496:20:21:90:525:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:policy  programs  both  for  short  and  long  terms  outcomes  across  a  large  number  of 
23:713:60589:21:0:90:331:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:outcomes and across many administrative unites.  
24:714:60638:0:21:125:524:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:However,  there  are  certain  limitations  or  restrictions  related  to  the  use  of 
24:715:60726:21:21:90:525:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:administrative  register  data,  and  we  try  to  distinguish  between  three  different  aspects  of 
24:716:60829:21:20:90:470:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:restrictions as compared to surveys designed for particular research questions.  
24:717:60909:20:21:125:128:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: 
24:718:60909:21:21:108:449:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:C:A. Limited information/less flexibility than with purpose-built surveys 
24:719:60979:21:21:108:525:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Administrative  registers  are  collected  for  different  reasons  than  research,  and  in 
24:720:61072:21:20:90:524:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:particular in one  area they have limitations  as  compared  to  purpose-built  surveys.  Very 
24:721:61165:20:21:90:525:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:little information on cognitive skills other than achievement and attainment or social and 
24:722:61255:21:21:90:525:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:behavioral skills  are  available  in  most  register  data.  Variables  that  potentially  are  very 
24:723:61356:21:20:90:525:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:important  in  understanding  for  instance  school  choices  such  as  motivation  and  attitudes 
24:724:61455:20:21:90:525:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  more general  psychological  traits  for  instance  as  measured  by  Big  five  components 
24:725:61551:21:21:90:524:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:are not available. Some of these questions are available in some countries in military data 
24:726:61643:21:21:90:366:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:for men, but usually only for a limited number of years.   
24:727:61701:21:20:125:525:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:This lack of important information on, for instance, reasons for education choices 
24:728:61782:20:21:90:525:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:or  effort  is  a  challenge,  but  several  new  strategies  are  being  used  to  mediate  this 
24:729:61880:21:21:90:525:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:limitation.  Several  research  groups  in  the  Nordic  countries  are  now  combining  surveys 
24:730:61977:21:20:90:524:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:with  registers  data,  as  well  as  lab  experiments  and  randomized  field  experiments  with 
24:731:62075:20:21:90:157:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:register data.  
24:732:62090:21:21:125:525:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:One  example  connected  to  the  economics  of  education  undertaken is in  Norway, 
24:733:62175:21:20:90:524:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:where pupils just prior to the decision to attend  high school, were surveyed on the “Big 
24:734:62262:20:21:90:525:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:five” personality traits and on the information about the labor market (Almas, Cappelen, 
24:735:62349:21:21:90:524:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Salvanes,  Sorensen,  Tungodden,  2014). The  idea  in  the  project  was  to  use  incentivized 
24:736:62445:21:21:90:525:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:lab experiments to tease out preferences for willingness to compete, risk taking, patience 
24:737:62536:21:20:90:525:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:etc., together  with  an  ability  test,  a  survey  regarding the “big  five”,  time  use  on 
24:738:62631:20:21:90:524:212:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f3:B:homework  etc., and a quite intensive survey on the students’ knowledge of the labor 
24:739:62715:21:21:90:525:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:market  and  the  returns  to  education.  Parents  and  students  provided  consent to  follow 
24:740:62810:21:20:90:524:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:these  students  through  the  education  system  and  into  the  labor  market,  and  to  match  to 
24:741:62911:20:21:90:524:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:parental background from register data. Many research questions may be analyzed using 
24:742:62997:21:21:90:525:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:this  resource, for  instance  to  better  understand  high  drop-out  rates.  These  type  of 
24:743:63092:21:0:90:524:108:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:approach  also facilitates field  experiments  in  school,  and  then allows following pupils 
25:744:63186:0:21:90:525:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:through the education system, into the labor market. Hence, the lack of information in the 
25:745:63277:21:21:90:396:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:administrative data sets may be compensated in different ways. 
25:746:63339:21:20:125:128:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: 
25:747:63339:20:21:108:398:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:C:B. Technical issues with the use of administrative registers 
25:748:63398:21:21:125:525:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Depending on the country, issues of a more technical nature might be an obstacle 
25:749:63478:21:21:90:525:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in  the  use  of  administrative  registers.  One  such obstacle is  the  ability  to  match 
25:750:63570:21:20:90:524:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:administrative  registers  across  administrative units.  For  instance,  important  research 
25:751:63663:20:21:90:524:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:topics  can  be  analyzed by connecting school  outcomes  to  long  term  outcomes  such  as 
25:752:63753:21:21:90:525:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:income and completed education, or even outcomes such as fertility, crime, and marriage. 
25:753:63842:21:20:90:525:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:In  many  countries,  and  notably  the  Nordic  countries  a  common identification number  is 
25:754:63936:20:21:90:525:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:utilized  across  all  administrative  units  and  across  all  registers.  Furthermore,  even  if  the 
25:755:64040:21:21:90:525:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:different  administrative  registers  are  collected  and  owned  in  principle  by  the  different 
25:756:64140:21:21:90:524:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:units, a law for statistical usage for research purposes enables researchers to use merged 
25:757:64231:21:20:90:525:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:registers  across  administrative  units.  De-identified  and  merged  data are made  available 
25:758:64326:20:21:90:525:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:through   the   national statistical   offices. But   in many   countries   a   unique   personal 
25:759:64423:21:21:90:525:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:identification number either does not exist, or there are legal restrictions to merge across 
25:760:64516:21:20:90:524:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:administrative  units12. For  example,  in  the  United  States  only  a  few  states  have  linked 
25:761:64616:20:21:90:525:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:children’s social security numbers, which are used for all labor market and benefits data, 
25:762:64707:21:21:90:524:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to  their  birth  records,  and  in  many  states  it  is  actually  illegal  to  link  social  security 
25:763:64812:21:20:90:525:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:numbers  to  education  records.  In  cases  like  these,  it  becomes  extremely  difficult  to  link 
25:764:64915:20:21:90:525:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:data  across  administrative  data  domains.  While  many  states  in  the  United  States  are 
25:765:65011:21:21:90:525:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:making strong progress in linking education and workforce data, thanks to the leadership 
25:766:65100:21:21:90:524:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of  the  Data  Quality  Campaign,  a  national  organization  dedicated  to  promoting  the 
25:767:65192:21:20:90:525:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:development, implementation, and use of high-quality administrative education data sets, 
25:768:65279:20:21:90:409:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and other allied groups, this is a difficult and slow-going process.  
25:769:65348:21:21:125:524:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Another  issue  is, of  course, that  it  is  hard  to  follow people moving  to  other 
25:770:65433:21:20:90:524:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:countries since they may change citizenship, or even if people are studying and working 
25:771:65520:20:21:90:524:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:abroad  it  is  hard  to follow  them  in  terms  of  income  or  graduation.  Hence,  attrition  of 
25:772:65621:21:32:90:525:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:samples might be an issue. One will be able to identify which country they move to and 
25:773:65708:32:7:234:237:97:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:                                                        
25:774:65763:7:16:90:484:90:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:12 Another legal restriction was in place, until recently, in Finland where the possibility of indirect 
25:775:65866:16:0:90:522:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:identification of individuals in small groups prevented researchers from using registry data in full capacity.  
26:776:65979:0:21:90:525:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  reason  for  moving,  but  not  outcomes.  This  is  of  course  a  limitation,  but  the  same 
26:777:66080:21:21:90:524:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:limitation is shared by standard surveys. This issue is certainly compounded in countries 
26:778:66169:21:20:90:525:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:like the United States where people move freely  and often between states but individual 
26:779:66258:20:21:90:525:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:states maintain their own birth records, health records, education records, and workforce 
26:780:66348:21:21:90:524:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:data. In  recent  years,  it  has  become  possible  in  rare  circumstances  to  match  school 
26:781:66443:21:21:90:525:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:records to tax data from the Internal Revenue Service in order to follow children living in 
26:782:66535:21:20:90:525:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:one  state  to  adult  outcomes  in  another  state  (see,  e.g.,  Chetty  et  al.,  2014),  and  we are 
26:783:66639:20:21:90:364:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:hopeful that more cases like that will occur in the future. 
26:784:66698:21:21:125:524:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Since the administrative  data sets  are not designed for  research in the  first place, 
26:785:66787:21:20:90:524:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:they  are  not particularly well-documented  (with  some  exceptions).  This  also  means  that 
26:786:66882:20:21:90:524:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:there  is  a  big  investment  aspect  of  using  these  data  sets  as  compared  to  more  standard 
26:787:66984:21:21:90:525:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:surveys, for instance in the United States some of the surveys are publicly available and 
26:788:67071:21:21:90:525:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:very  well  documented.  The  larger  research  groups  in  the  Nordic  countries  using  several 
26:789:67170:21:20:90:525:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:matched  registers  have  used  the  data  sets  over  a  long  time  and  spent  a  considerable 
26:790:67268:20:21:90:525:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:amount  of  resources  in  checking  the  data  and  understanding its structure,  the  content  of 
26:791:67366:21:21:90:525:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the variables, and the changing definitions of these variables over time. Due to changes in 
26:792:67458:21:20:90:525:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:tax  laws  for  instance,  also  the  definition  of  earnings  provided  in  these  data  sets  may 
26:793:67559:20:21:90:525:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:change.  These  changes  are  not  always  easily  available  to  outsiders  of  the administrative 
26:794:67659:21:21:90:524:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:units collecting the data. And of course, it is always possible that the administrative data 
26:795:67752:21:20:90:525:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:sets  are  incomplete  or  have  other  errors  in  them,  because  their  purpose  was  never  for 
26:796:67852:20:21:90:524:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:research  quality  but  rather  for  recording  activities  such  as  governmental  program 
26:797:67944:21:21:90:525:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:participation and compliance. As a consequence, these data may not have been subjected 
26:798:68031:21:21:90:525:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to  the  same  type  of  quality  assurance/quality  control  that  is  standard  in  the  case  of  data 
26:799:68137:21:20:90:324:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:sets collected specifically for research purposes. 
26:800:68187:20:21:125:128:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: 
26:801:68187:21:21:90:282:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:C:C. Political issues related to anonymity 
26:802:68227:21:20:125:525:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:An important issue with using administrative registers is that they cannot be made 
26:803:68308:20:21:90:525:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:available  publicly,  due  to  security  and  confidentiality  concerns.  Given  that  unique 
26:804:68402:21:21:90:524:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:personal  identifiers  exist,  most  countries  with  these  data  sets  have  developed  secure 
26:805:68499:21:21:90:525:108:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:systems  for  making  them  available  to  researchers  or  research  groups.  In  the  Nordic 
26:806:68594:21:0:90:525:87:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:countries  (with  the  exception  of  Finland  where  a  slightly  different  system  is  in  place), 
27:807:68698:0:21:90:524:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:very similar system have been developed over time where the Statistical agencies play an 
27:808:68786:21:21:90:524:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:important  role  in  merging  and  de-identifying  data  for  researchers, generally through 
27:809:68879:21:20:90:525:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:research centers that have been through a quite extensive application procedure with data 
27:810:68967:20:21:90:389:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:authorities, owners of data and the national statistical offices.  
27:811:69033:21:21:125:524:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:For all of the Nordic countries there are several research groups with access to the 
27:812:69118:21:21:90:525:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:same  or  very  overlapping  collection  of  administrative  data  sets,  and  no  research  group 
27:813:69217:21:20:90:524:584:12:g_d0_f3:12:Times New Roman:B:has the “monopoly” to certain registers. The advantage is, of course, that research can be 
27:814:69306:20:21:90:524:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:replicated by other researchers. This is true to an increasing degree in a number of other 
27:815:69397:21:21:90:524:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:countries,  such  as  the  United  Kingdom,  Chile,  the  Netherlands,  and  numerous states  in 
27:816:69494:21:20:90:525:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the US,  to  name  a  few.  Governments  must  balance  the  costs  associated  with  potential 
27:817:69590:20:21:90:525:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:security breaches against the very large benefits of making data available to a wide range 
27:818:69681:21:21:90:525:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of  researchers,  who  have  insights  and  expertise  in  a  larger  set  of  substantive  research 
27:819:69782:21:21:90:524:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:issues. It   is imperative   that   researchers   work   diligently   to   ensure   that   they   treat 
27:820:69885:21:20:90:525:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:administrative  data  with  care  and  maintain  high  degree  of  security  so  that  justifiably 
27:821:69984:20:21:90:525:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:worried  stewards  of  administrative  data  can  feel  more  confident  that  sharing  data  with 
27:822:70083:21:21:90:525:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:scholars provides high benefits to citizens with extremely low risks of security breaches 
27:823:70173:21:20:90:270:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:or other forms of negligent behavior.

27:825:70210:21:21:90:359:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:C:V. The use of administrative data around the world  
27:826:70260:21:20:126:525:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:We begin this section by specifying different types of administrative data used in 
27:827:70343:20:21:90:524:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:educational  research.  In  tables 1 through  4 we  mostly  focus  on  student  or  teacher 
27:828:70433:21:21:90:525:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:registries; however, we also consider principals, pre-formal schooling children and other 
27:829:70522:21:21:90:525:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:individuals  for  whom  we  observe  administrative  educational  records. These  tables  are 
27:830:70615:21:20:90:525:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:divided by whether the data sets are matched or unmatched to other records, and whether 
27:831:70703:20:21:90:524:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:or  not  they  are  linked  to surveys  or experiments. Table  1  lists  papers  that  use  a  single

27:833:70905:21:20:90:525:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:administrative  data  sources;  table  3  lists  papers  that  use  a  single  administrative  data 
27:834:71005:20:21:90:525:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:source  which  is  matched  to  either  survey  or  experimental  data;  table  4  lists  papers  that 
27:835:71108:21:21:90:524:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:matches individuals both across various administrative data sources and to either survey 
27:836:71197:21:21:90:525:108:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:or  experiment. We  group  the  papers  by  continent,  country,  region  (state)  and  provide 
27:837:71293:21:0:90:281:87:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:abbreviated bibliographic information.  
28:838:71334:0:21:126:525:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:It is not our purpose to provide an encyclopedic review of all papers making use 
28:839:71415:21:21:90:525:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of  administrative  data  around the  world,  but  we  wanted  to  offer  a  very  wide-ranging 
28:840:71510:21:20:90:525:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:sampling of the current state of the use of administrative data throughout the world. We 
28:841:71599:20:21:90:524:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:therefore  sought to  systematically  survey  a  large  number  of  leading  economics  outlets 
28:842:71695:21:21:90:525:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that  publish  papers  in  the economics  of  education.  Specifically,  we browsed  all  articles 
28:843:71793:21:21:90:524:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:published  or  accepted  for  publication  between January 1990  and  July  2014  in  the

28:850:72389:21:21:90:525:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:program published until the end of July 2014. Although we recognize that this list is far 
28:851:72479:21:20:90:525:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:from  being comprehensive,  we  covered  350  papers  from  28  countries  and  all  continents 
28:852:72575:20:21:90:200:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:except for Antarctica.  
28:853:72598:21:21:126:525:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:In  the  tables,  we organize  countries  by  regions  of  the  world -- Europe,  North 
28:854:72684:21:20:90:524:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:America,  South  America,  Asia, Africa,  and Oceania – and then  order  all  papers  within 
28:855:72775:20:21:90:525:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:country  and  state  (region)  by  publication  date13. It  is  clear  that  the  majority  of  research 
28:856:72880:21:21:90:525:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(published in these outlets at least) makes use of data from North America (253 papers), 
28:857:72969:21:20:90:524:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  in  particular the United  States  (240  papers). It  is  possible  that  this  is  a  substantial 
28:858:73073:20:21:90:524:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:overstatement  of the  North  American  share  of  education  economics  research  using 
28:859:73162:21:21:90:525:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:administrative data because of possible publication biases of the journals that we selected 
28:860:73254:21:21:90:525:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:for  inclusion,  but  again,  our  charge  is  not  to  be  comprehensive  in  our  survey.  A  large 
28:861:73356:21:20:90:525:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:fraction  of  papers  in  the  list  make  use  of  data  from Europe  (85 papers), while  smaller 
28:862:73454:20:21:90:525:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:shares  makes  use  of  data  from South  America  (18  papers), Africa  (6  papers), Asia  (4 
28:863:73548:21:21:90:525:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:papers), and  Oceania  (1  paper).  Within  Europe the majority  of  papers  come  from 
28:864:73635:21:20:90:525:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:England, Israel, Norway,  and  Sweden.  These four countries  comprise 77%  of European 
28:865:73720:20:21:90:525:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:output.  Within  United  States,  the majority  of  research  comes  from  North  Carolina, 
28:866:73811:21:21:90:525:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Florida,  Texas,  Chicago, and  New  York  City; however,  nearly  half  of  the  States  in  the 
28:867:73907:21:22:90:524:108:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Union  contributed  at least  one  paper  to  the  list,  and  given  the  large  investments  in  data 
28:868:74011:22:8:234:237:86:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:                                                        
28:869:74066:8:0:90:347:78:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:13 We treat Israel as part of Europe for our accounting purposes. 
29:870:74132:0:21:90:525:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:infrastructure  throughout  the  United  States  we  expect  the  geographic  spread  to  continue 
29:871:74231:21:21:90:525:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in the future. That said, it is not an accident that so many papers make use of data from 
29:872:74321:21:20:90:524:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:North  Carolina,  Florida,  Texas,  Chicago,  and  New  York  City,  as  these  are  major  U.S. 
29:873:74418:20:21:90:525:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:jurisdictions  that  facilitate  research  more  than  most.  Among  other  countries  Chile 
29:874:74511:21:21:90:524:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:contributed  11  papers, while Canada 9.  There  is  also  growing  output  based  on  Kenyan 
29:875:74603:21:21:90:524:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:data. It is also clear from tables 1 to 4 that majority of the research output utilizes only a 
29:876:74697:21:20:90:525:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:single  administrative  data  source  (e.g.  school  records)  which  could  be  related  to  both 
29:877:74796:20:21:90:525:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:limited data infrastructure and matching restrictions (e.g. in the US). At the same time it 
29:878:74886:21:21:90:525:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:is   relatively   rare   that   researchers   are   able   to   match   individuals   across   multiple 
29:879:74990:21:20:90:525:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:administrative data sets, say birth and school records, and also to survey or experiment – 
29:880:75080:20:21:90:464:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:only 10 out of 350 paper we identified and primarily from outside of the US.  
29:881:75157:21:21:126:525:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:As  stated  in  the  introduction,  the  use  of  administrative  data  is  a  rather  new 
29:882:75248:21:21:90:525:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:phenomenon and it has  been made possible due  to the increase in computational power, 
29:883:75335:21:20:90:525:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:decrease in storage prices and enhanced cooperation between governmental agencies and 
29:884:75421:20:21:90:525:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:researchers all over the world. The first papers from our list were published in Economics 
29:885:75512:21:21:90:524:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of Education Review (Theobald, 1990) and in the Journal of Human Resources (Murnane 
29:886:75594:21:20:90:524:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and Olsen, 1990). The former one used data from Washington, while the latter one from 
29:887:75679:20:21:90:524:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:North  Carolina,  and  both  papers  investigated  the  role  that  different  variables  play  in 
29:888:75778:21:21:90:525:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:teacher  retention.  In  fact  through  the  1990s  the  surveyed  journals  published  only  seven 
29:889:75878:21:20:90:524:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:papers using administrative data and six of these were studying the teacher labor market. 
29:890:75967:20:21:90:525:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:One reason for the focus on teachers in the early use of administrative data is the fact that 
29:891:76061:21:21:90:525:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:due to bureaucracy and budgeting the records of public school employees were compiled 
29:892:76147:21:21:90:525:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and stored centrally by state departments of education long before researchers expressed 
29:893:76236:21:20:90:524:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:interest  in  them,  while  few  countries  around  the  world  systematically  collected  student 
29:894:76335:20:21:90:216:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:achievement information. 
29:895:76359:21:21:126:525:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:In  the  2000s  there  was  a  rapid  increase  in  the  amount  of  scientific  output  using 
29:896:76454:21:20:90:524:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:administrative data with 114 papers published in our list. The diversity also increased and 
29:897:76545:20:21:90:525:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:papers used not only data on teachers and students but also on individuals pre- and post- 
29:898:76632:21:21:90:525:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:their  schooling  years.  Finally,  between  2010  and  July  2014  the  scientific  journals  we 
29:899:76730:21:21:90:524:108:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:surveyed have already  published  nearly  230  papers.  This  massive  increase  was  driven 
29:900:76823:21:0:90:525:87:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:mostly by the United States, but in every year more and more countries contribute to the 
30:901:76913:0:21:90:525:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:Times New Roman:B:global “data village”. The first papers in  our  list using  European  data  were  published  in 
30:902:77010:21:21:90:524:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2001 using  data from  Jerusalem,  from  South  America  in  2000  using  Chilean  data, from 
30:903:77102:21:20:90:489:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Asia in 2009 using data from Beijing, and from Africa in 2009 using Kenyan data. 
30:904:77181:20:21:126:525:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Akin to the examples provided in our Norway, Sweden, and Florida case studies, 
30:905:77260:21:21:90:524:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:we observe a substantial variation in the types of registry data used internationally. This 
30:906:77352:21:21:90:525:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:depends  both  on  data  infrastructure  itself  but  also  on  the  institutional  setting  in  a 
30:907:77451:21:20:90:525:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:particular country, state or region under investigation. For example, even though Norway 
30:908:77540:20:21:90:524:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:has  very  high-quality long  run  data  it  is difficult to  study  the  long-run  effects  of  school 
30:909:77642:21:21:90:525:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:competition in this country because there is no variation in the competitive pressure faced 
30:910:77733:21:20:90:524:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:by different schools. Similarly, although Sweden has introduced school competition to its 
30:911:77823:20:21:90:525:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:institutional  setting  and  hence  it  is  possible  to  study  whether  such  policies  have  long 
30:912:77924:21:21:90:525:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:lasting  effects,  it  is  actually  impossible  to  look  at  these  effects  in  a  short-run,  i.e., in  a 
30:913:78033:21:21:90:525:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:manner  comparable  to  the  United States,  because  Sweden  did  not  test  its  pupils  using 
30:914:78130:21:20:90:525:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:standardized  assessments.  Yet  another  problem  is  the  possibility  to  link  different  data 
30:915:78229:20:21:90:525:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:registers, and from this perspective in most states in the United States it is not possible to 
30:916:78323:21:21:90:525:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:study  the  effects  of,  for  example,  neonatal  health  on  schooling  outcomes (Table  2).  The 
30:917:78422:21:20:90:525:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:data simply do not allow a clean match between  birth records and school records due to 
30:918:78510:20:21:90:524:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:lack  of  unique personal  identifier.  Notable  exception  here  is  Florida  that  assigns  their 
30:919:78610:21:21:90:524:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:newborns social security numbers. Useful but not perfect way around this last problem is 
30:920:78698:21:20:90:525:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:widely used in historical research probabilistic matching of individuals (Ferrie and Long, 
30:921:78789:20:21:90:525:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2013).  This  method  has  been  applied  to  some  modern  data  sets  like  birth  and  school 
30:922:78886:21:21:90:524:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:records  in  North  Carolina  (Ladd  et  al.,  2012) but  the  match  rates  based  on  these 
30:923:78980:21:21:90:518:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:procedures are not ideal and they are sensitive to the type of populations under scrutiny.  
30:924:79070:21:20:126:525:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The  examples  in  the  paragraph  above  illustrate  the  complexity  behind  research 
30:925:79158:20:21:90:525:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:projects involving  registry  data but also point out to the need of both data infrastructure 
30:926:79251:21:21:90:524:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  credible  variation  in  studying  economic and  educational phenomena.  The  agenda 
30:927:79341:21:20:90:525:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:becomes  even  more  complex  when  the  research  objectives  involve  long-run  effects  of 
30:928:79435:20:21:90:525:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:particular interventions, their spillovers or understanding the mechanisms through which 
30:929:79524:21:21:90:525:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:these  interventions  operate.  In  this  case  population-level  administrative  registries  are 
30:930:79622:21:21:90:525:108:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:particularly  essential as  these  research  projects  often  involve  matching  subjects  in  field 
30:931:79722:21:0:90:525:87:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:experiments to themselves decades later (Aslund, et al., 2011) or to subjects’ siblings 
31:932:79812:0:21:90:525:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(Black  et  al.,  2014).  Furthermore,  when  the  goal  is  to  elicit  mechanisms  through  which 
31:933:79912:21:21:90:524:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  policies  operate  then  most  often  the  survey  instruments  need  to  be  applied to  the 
31:934:80011:21:20:90:525:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:studied  populations  and  then  matched  back  to  the  original  registers  (Burgess  et  al., 
31:935:80108:20:21:90:159:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:forthcoming). 
31:936:80121:21:21:126:525:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Due  to  the  institutional  issues  brought  up  in  the  paragraphs  above  researchers  in 
31:937:80215:21:21:90:524:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:different  countries  seem  to  specialize  in  studying  very  specific  questions  based  on  the 
31:938:80315:21:20:90:524:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:registers   that   are   available   to   them,   and   the   policy   environments   that   they   face. 
31:939:80421:20:21:90:525:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Scandinavian   countries   produce   mostly   studies   that   involve   rather   lower   quality 
31:940:80519:21:21:90:525:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:educational  measures  for  which  they  compensate  with  the  fact  that  individuals  can  be 
31:941:80616:21:20:90:525:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:tracked from their birth to their death and often also across generations14. These countries 
31:942:80709:20:21:90:525:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:do  not  have  longitudinal  student  assessment  data  but  are  the  only  locations  in  the  world 
31:943:80812:21:21:90:525:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:where  the  whole  population  of  males  undergoes  physical,  intellectual  and  emotional 
31:944:80905:21:21:90:524:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:evaluations  at  the  time  of  entering  adulthood15.  On  the  other  side  of  this  spectrum  are 
31:945:81007:21:20:90:524:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:countries  like  England  or the majority  of the U.S. states  that  have  regular  student 
31:946:81099:20:21:90:525:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:assessments  but  do  not  allow  merging  different  databases.  A  few  notable  exceptions  to 
31:947:81197:21:21:90:525:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that   rule   are   for   instance   Florida, Texas,   Chicago,   Charlotte-Mecklenburg (North 
31:948:81291:21:20:90:522:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Carolina), and  New  York  City  that  allow  linking  student  records  to  subsequent  post-
31:949:81385:20:21:90:524:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:secondary  education  (Booker  et  al.,  2011),  criminal  records  (Deming,  2011)  or  labor 
31:950:81480:21:21:90:525:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:market  outcomes  (Clark  and  Martorell,  2014).  These  are  generally  rare  because  they 
31:951:81574:21:20:90:524:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:require agreements and cooperation of multiple governmental agencies16. A longitudinal 
31:952:81661:20:21:90:524:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:data set that follows kids from birth through childhood, adolescence to adulthood is also 
31:953:81750:21:21:90:525:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:available  for  the  province  of  Manitoba,  Canada.  These  data  are  somewhat  in-between 
31:954:81844:21:21:90:524:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Scandinavian   and   United States registers   because   although   they   allow   tracking 
31:955:81935:21:20:90:525:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:individuals  longitudinally,  they  do  not  allow  for  more  complex  familial  linkages or 
31:956:82028:20:34:90:524:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:longitudinal   student   assessment.   There   are   also   few data   sets   with   longitudinal 
31:957:82126:34:8:234:237:178:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:                                                        
31:958:82181:8:16:90:512:170:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:14 A notable exception here is Finland where research community has not have until recently such a wide 
31:959:82283:16:7:90:344:154:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:access to national registers as in Denmark, Sweden or Norway. 
31:960:82344:7:16:90:513:147:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:15 The mandatory military draft has been revoked in Sweden in the mid 2000s but the data for the cohorts 
31:961:82447:16:11:90:524:131:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:1952 to 2002 can still be used. At the same time as discussed in our case studies Sweden is in the process of 
31:962:82554:11:7:90:503:120:10:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:?:rolling out longitudinal student assessments in their compulsory schooling system in grades 3, 6 and 9. 
31:963:82656:7:16:90:522:113:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:16 Note that in Scandinavia, unlike in the US, the multiple registers are handled by a single agency and even 
31:964:82764:16:12:90:518:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:though Department of Defense administers the military draft and Department of Education coordinates the 
31:965:82868:12:11:90:507:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:9th grade assessments the research proposal is submitted and processed through a single Data Inspection 
31:966:82971:11:0:90:133:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:Authority. 
32:967:82983:0:21:90:525:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:components outside of Scandinavia or North America. For instance, it is possible to link 
32:968:83072:21:21:90:524:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:birth  records  to  schooling  records  in  Chile  (Bharadwaj,  Loken  and  Neilson,  2013),  link 
32:969:83171:21:20:90:525:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:birth  records  to  death  records  to  schooling  records  in  Taiwan  (Gimenez  et  al.,  2013)  or 
32:970:83273:20:21:90:443:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:link schooling interventions to long-run outcomes in Israel (Lavy, 2014). 
32:971:83346:21:21:126:525:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The  growth  in  access  to  administrative  data  across  the  World  is  crucial  from  the 
32:972:83440:21:21:90:525:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:policy  point  of  view  because  it  allows  direct  testing  of  external  validity  of  particular 
32:973:83542:21:20:90:525:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economic  phenomena  in  different  institutional  setting.  In  fact  we  see  more  and  more 
32:974:83638:20:21:90:525:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:multi-state  or  multi-country  studies  in  recent  years, e.g.  Fryer  (2014)  or  Bharadwaj, 
32:975:83733:21:21:90:525:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Loken and  Neilson  (2013)17.  The  concern with  external  validity  and  ability  to  study  the 
32:976:83831:21:20:90:525:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:same  policies  in  multiple  locations  is  the  more  important  in  experimental  work  that 
32:977:83927:20:21:90:525:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:necessarily focuses on rather narrow populations, but is becoming a “gold standard” in 
32:978:84014:21:21:90:524:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:policy  evaluations.  The  single-country  multi-site  studies  are  important  from  national 
32:979:84109:21:21:90:525:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:policy point of view, especially in diverse countries like United States or France, because 
32:980:84201:21:20:90:525:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:it  is  not  obvious  that  intervention  which  works  in  Chicago  Public  Schools  or  East Paris 
32:981:84302:20:21:90:525:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:will  work  in  more  affluent  areas  like  Greenwich,  Connecticut  or  Neuilly-sur-Seine. 
32:982:84395:21:21:90:525:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Another  broader  question  is  whether  similar  policies  give  the  same  effects  in  culturally, 
32:983:84497:21:20:90:524:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economically or institutionally different environment. In this case researchers have to rely 
32:984:84590:20:21:90:525:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:on   rare   interventions   that   are   universal   across   many   countries,   like   for   example 
32:985:84693:21:21:90:525:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:standardized  treatment  of  low  birth  weight  babies. These  studies  are  extremely  valuable 
32:986:84790:21:20:90:524:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:because   they   often   allow   research   community   to   understand   a   more   fundamental 
32:987:84887:20:21:90:525:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:background of human social behavior. They also allow studying externalities of particular 
32:988:84977:21:21:90:387:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:policies interacting with different institutional environments.  
32:989:85041:21:21:126:525:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:In  the  remaining  part  of  this  section  we  focus  on  particular  questions  relevant  to 
32:990:85137:21:20:90:524:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:educational research agenda, and how these have been addressed in different countries or 
32:991:85226:20:21:90:525:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:states.  We  start  off  with  the  fundamental  question  of  how  early  childhood  environment 
32:992:85324:21:21:90:524:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:affects   educational,   and   potentially   long-run   outcomes.   Given   the   advantages   and 
32:993:85423:21:20:90:524:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:disadvantages of various administrative data sets described in the paragraphs above, it is 
32:994:85514:20:30:90:525:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:not  surprising  that  this  research  question  has  been  dominated  by  studies  based  on 
32:995:85608:30:7:234:237:120:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:                                                        
32:996:85663:7:16:90:515:113:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:17 There is fewer published cross-country than cross-state studies, however, we should see more and more 
32:997:85767:16:12:90:512:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:of the former ones coming in the next few years. Another notable example is study of Bedard and Dhuey 
32:998:85869:12:11:90:512:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:(2006) which combines results from Canada based on administrative data and from other countries based 
32:999:85971:11:0:90:184:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:on various survey data. 
33:1000:85996:0:21:90:524:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Scandinavian  data (Table  2).  The  excellent  data  infrastructure  in  Denmark,  Sweden  and 
33:1001:86091:21:21:90:525:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Norway allows tracking individuals not only from their birth to their death but also across 
33:1002:86183:21:20:90:525:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:multiple  generations  and  familial  connections  as  children  are  linked  to  their  biological 
33:1003:86283:20:21:90:524:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:parents using unique identifiers, and the parents are in turn linked to their siblings using 
33:1004:86376:21:21:90:525:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:unique  identifiers.  Except  for  the  three  aforementioned  Scandinavian  countries  early 
33:1005:86470:21:21:90:525:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:childhood  has  also  been  studied  in  two  other  European  countries:  England  (Almond, 
33:1006:86563:21:20:90:525:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Mazumder  and  Van  Ewijk,  2014)  and  Germany  (Dustmann  and  Schonberg,  2012).  In 
33:1007:86651:20:21:90:524:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:North America we have a birth order study from Indiana (Hanushek, 1992) which is the 
33:1008:86736:21:21:90:525:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:only  study  from  the  1990s  on  our  list  that  was  not  focused  specifically  on  teachers  but 
33:1009:86839:21:20:90:525:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:used an experimental population from Gary  Income Maintenance Experiment merged to 
33:1010:86922:20:21:90:525:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:children schooling records. The other papers include birth weight effects  estimates from 
33:1011:87012:21:21:90:524:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Canada  (Oreopoulos  et  al.,  2008)  and  Florida  (Figlio  et  al.,  2014),  in-utero  pollution 
33:1012:87111:21:21:90:525:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:exposure  study  from  Texas  (Sanders,  2012)  and  an  influential  foster  care  system 
33:1013:87202:21:20:90:524:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:evaluation  from  Illinois  (Doyle,  2007).  A  paper  from  Taiwan  investigates  the  effects  of 
33:1014:87302:20:21:90:524:419:12:g_d0_f3:12:Times New Roman:B:parental loss on children’s well-being  (Gimenez  et  al.,  2013)  while  a  paper  based  on 
33:1015:87396:21:21:90:525:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Chilean and Norwegian data studies the role of health interventions at birth (Bharadwaj, 
33:1016:87485:21:20:90:524:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Loken and Neilson, 2013). Some of these papers, due to their use of administrative data, 
33:1017:87573:20:21:90:524:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:documented new and important empirical phenomena. Figlio et al. (2014) are among the 
33:1018:87658:21:21:90:525:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:first  to  document  that  neonatal  health  and  parental  socioeconomic  status  are  likely 
33:1019:87753:21:20:90:524:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:complements  rather  than  substitutes – a  common  perception  was  rather  that  wealthier 
33:1020:87845:20:21:90:525:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:parents  can  better  compensate  for  lower  health  capital  of  their  children  than  poorer 
33:1021:87942:21:21:90:525:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:parents.  Bharadwaj,  Lokean  and  Neilson  (2013)  show  that  health  interventions  in 
33:1022:88032:21:21:90:524:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:countries  as  different  as  Chile  and  Norway  can  yield  fairly  similar  effects  which  boosts 
33:1023:88134:21:20:90:525:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the confidence that earl life interventions effectiveness is not necessarily tied to specific 
33:1024:88228:20:21:90:332:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:institutional environment or wealth of the society. 
33:1025:88279:21:21:126:525:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Across   different   countries   and   institutional   settings   the   most   often   studied 
33:1026:88374:21:20:90:525:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:question seems to be the role of school technology or the education production function. 
33:1027:88462:20:21:90:525:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:These  topics  range  from  the  questions  of  how  gender  composition  of  classrooms 
33:1028:88551:21:21:90:524:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:influences  female  school  choice  in  Austria  (Schneeweis  and  Zweimuller,  2012),  or  how 
33:1029:88647:21:0:90:525:108:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:ethnic and immigrant concentration in schools affects cognitive development of children 
34:1030:88737:0:21:90:524:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in  Denamrk  (Jensen  and  Rasmussen,  2011)18 and  England  (Dustmann,  Machin  and 
34:1031:88821:21:21:90:525:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Schonberg,   2010), through   mandatory   school   entry   and   exit   ages   in   Germany

34:1034:89094:21:21:90:525:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Payne  and  Chan,  2010)  and  New  York  City  (Rubenstein  et  al.,  2009). There  is  also  a 
34:1035:89190:21:21:90:525:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:substantial  variation  in  the  kind  of  inputs  that  are  investigated  in  different  states  within 
34:1036:89296:21:20:90:525:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  Union.  They  span  from  the  role  of  the  quantity  of  math  instruction  hours  in  Florida 
34:1037:89399:20:21:90:525:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(Taylor, 2014) through teacher cheating in Chicago (Jacob and Levitt, 2003) to the role of 
34:1038:89490:21:21:90:525:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:school  crowding  in  North  Carolina  (McMullen  and  Rouse,  2012)  or  paying  students  for 
34:1039:89586:21:20:90:307:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:grade completion in Ohio (Bettinger, 2012).  
34:1040:89630:20:21:126:524:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:There  are  also  multi-site  studies  within  the  US  that  explore  the  role  of  same 
34:1041:89721:21:21:90:525:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:school  inputs  in very  different  school  environments,  and  thus,  allow  for  assessment  of 
34:1042:89818:21:21:90:525:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:generalizability of the interventions. An example of such study  would be Fryer’s (2014) 
34:1043:89906:21:20:90:525:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:investigation  of the  role  of  importing  best  charter  school  practices  to  traditional  public 
34:1044:90007:20:21:90:525:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:schools  in  Chicago,  Denver  and  Houston.  His  results  are  remarkably  similar  across 
34:1045:90100:21:21:90:525:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Denver and Houston, the two experimental samples, and are smaller for Chicago, where 
34:1046:90185:21:20:90:525:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:only  quasi-experimental  variation  is  available.  Notably  Denver  and  Houston  differ  both 
34:1047:90282:20:21:90:525:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in  terms  of  demographics  and  institutional  setting  so  the  similarity  of  the  estimates  is 
34:1048:90384:21:21:90:525:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:noteworthy. It is also the case that Chicago implemented a slightly less intensive program 
34:1049:90475:21:20:90:525:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:which  could  account  for  the  difference  in  the  effects.  Another  example  of  this  kind  of 
34:1050:90576:20:21:90:524:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:cross-sites  within-country  research  is  Abdulkadiroglu,  Angrist  and  Pathak  (2014)  who 
34:1051:90670:21:21:90:525:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:investigate  the  role  of  school  composition  on  student  achievement  in  Boston  and  New 
34:1052:90766:21:21:90:524:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:York. In both cities they find little evidence that attending elite schools has a causal effect 
34:1053:90862:21:20:90:525:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:on test scores or college quality. Similar findings are confirmed in Kenyan setting (Lucas 
34:1054:90953:20:21:90:525:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  Mbiti,  2014)  but  Jackson  (2010)  finds  large  gains  from  attending  elite  schools  in 
34:1055:91052:21:48:90:524:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Trinidad and Tobago. This set of papers unlike the health interventions at birth suggests 
34:1056:91142:48:7:234:237:143:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:                                                        
34:1057:91197:7:16:90:493:136:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:18 The Danish study is the more important because it merges PISA data with registry data which in a 
34:1058:91296:16:12:90:510:120:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:longer-run will allow benchmarking the PISA test scores against economically meaningful variables like 
34:1059:91398:12:11:90:500:108:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:university graduation or income. Since PISA is used globally to compare the efficiency of educational 
34:1060:91500:11:12:90:496:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:systems it seems imperative to understand how PISA scores translate into long-run outcomes. To our 
34:1061:91599:12:11:90:504:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:knowledge Denmark is the only country that successfully merged their PISA samples to administrative 
34:1062:91699:11:0:90:126:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:?:records.  
35:1063:91710:0:21:90:525:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that  some  educational  policies  might  be  generalizable  with  country  but  not  across 
35:1064:91803:21:21:90:143:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:countires.  
35:1065:91813:21:20:126:525:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:One  particular  school  attribute  that  gained  a  lot  of  attention  in  the  educational 
35:1066:91907:20:21:90:524:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:research agenda involves class size (Angrist and Lavy, 1999; Chetty et al. 2011). Neither 
35:1067:91997:21:21:90:525:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of these two papers used administrative educational data sets, but there exists evidence on 
35:1068:92087:21:21:90:525:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:this  topic from at  least four  countries  and  two  states  using educational administrative 
35:1069:92181:21:20:90:525:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:data.  This  question  has  been  studied  in  Denmark  (Heinesen,  2010),  Italy  (Angrist, 
35:1070:92274:20:21:90:525:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Battisin and Vuri, 2014), Sweden (Fredriksson, Ockert and Oosterbeek, 2013), and in the 
35:1071:92362:21:21:90:525:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:United States in  Florida  (Chingos,  2012).  Using different  identification  strategies  and 
35:1072:92456:21:20:90:525:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:data  these  papers  generally  find  conflating  results.  Danish,  Italian  and  Swedish  studies 
35:1073:92556:20:21:90:525:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:confirm the previous results based on survey data that smaller classes generate significant 
35:1074:92648:21:21:90:525:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:advantages in later life schooling and labor market outcomes. On the contrary the Florida 
35:1075:92738:21:21:90:524:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:case-study  and  also  another  paper  using  Norwegian  registry  data  (Leuven,  Oosterbeek 
35:1076:92832:21:20:90:525:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  Ronning,  2008)  do  not  find  much  of  an  effect  of  a  reduction  in  class  size.  It  is 
35:1077:92934:20:21:90:524:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:particularly   interesting   that   the   Swedish   and   Norwegian   studies   use an identical 
35:1078:93031:21:21:90:524:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:identification strategy but find very different results. This point makes clear the value of 
35:1079:93124:21:20:90:271:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:cross-context replication and studies. 
35:1080:93162:20:21:126:525:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The  two  remaining  studies  of  class  size  in  our  list  are  somewhat  different. 
35:1081:93249:21:21:90:525:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Complementary  research  from  Kentucky  (Barrett  and  Toma,  2013)  documents  that 
35:1082:93335:21:20:90:525:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:principals  are  more  likely  to  assign  more  effective  teachers  to  larger  classes,  potentially 
35:1083:93439:20:21:90:525:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to  compensate  for  the  negative  class-size  effects.  Finally,  a  Chilean  (Urquiola  and 
35:1084:93534:21:21:90:524:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Verhoogen,   2009)   paper   makes   a   more   methodological   point   by   documenting   an 
35:1085:93629:21:21:90:525:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:inverted-U cross-sectional relationship between class-size and household income as well 
35:1086:93717:21:20:90:525:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:Times New Roman:B:as stacking of schools’ enrollments at multiples of the class-size cap. These two data facts 
35:1087:93810:20:21:90:525:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:could  invalidate  non-experimental  or regression  discontinuity estimates  of  the  class-size 
35:1088:93906:21:21:90:525:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in  liberalized  market  settings  where  schools  are  free  to  set  prices  and/or  turn  away 
35:1089:94004:21:20:90:522:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:students,  and  households  are  free  to  sort  between  schools.  The  manipulation  of a class-
35:1090:94102:20:21:90:525:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:size  rule  that  can  potentially  invalidate  the regression  discontinuity estimates  has  also 
35:1091:94200:21:21:90:524:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:been  documented  in  Israel  (Cohen-Zada,  Gradstein  and  Reuven,  2013). Comprehensive 
35:1092:94289:21:0:90:507:108:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:administrative data facilitated these studies that otherwise would be harder to conduct. 
36:1093:94379:0:21:126:525:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Another  hotly  debated  in  the  past  decades  educational  policy  topic  has  been  the 
36:1094:94471:21:21:90:525:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:role  of  school  choice  and  competition. Around  the  world, governments have  recently 
36:1095:94560:21:20:90:525:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:implemented and researchers evaluated various forms of choice and competition. Outside 
36:1096:94647:20:21:90:524:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the United States the countries that contributed to this broad research agenda are England, 
36:1097:94738:21:21:90:524:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Israel, and Sweden in Europe, Canada and United States in North America, Colombia and 
36:1098:94821:21:21:90:525:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Chile in South America, and China in Asia. However, not all of these countries study the 
36:1099:94910:21:20:90:524:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:same  phenomena  that  we  encapsulate  in  a  single  broad term of  school  choice.  For 
36:1100:95000:20:21:90:525:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:example, outside the United States, the effects of voucher and charter schools on student 
36:1101:95089:21:21:90:524:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:outcomes  are  examined  in  England  (Clark,  2009),  Sweden  (Sandstrom  and  Bergstrom, 
36:1102:95180:21:20:90:525:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2005),  Chile  (Mizala  and  Romaguera,  2000)  and  Colombia  (Angrist,  Bettinger  and 
36:1103:95269:20:21:90:525:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Kremer, 2006; Bettinger, Kremer and Saavedra, 2010). These papers, with the exception 
36:1104:95355:21:21:90:525:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of early Chilean descriptive work, point towards beneficial effects of vouchers on student 
36:1105:95445:21:21:90:525:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:achievement.  An  interesting  modification  of  the  voucher  system  type  of  competition  is 
36:1106:95542:21:20:90:524:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:studied  in  Ontario,  Canada (Card,  Dooley  and  Payne,  2010)  where  non-Catholics  are 
36:1107:95633:20:21:90:525:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:subject to monopoly of public schools while Catholics (40% of children in the province) 
36:1108:95721:21:21:90:525:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:can  choose  between  sending  their  kids  to  secular  public  schools  or  to  separate  schools. 
36:1109:95822:21:20:90:470:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The authors also find test score gains due to increased competition in Ontario.  
36:1110:95902:20:21:126:525:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:These effects have  also been investigated in the  United States for Florida (Figlio 
36:1111:95986:21:21:90:525:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  Hart,  2014),  Chicago  (Booker  et  al.,  2011),  Massachusetts  (Angrist,  Pathak  and 
36:1112:96080:21:20:90:524:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Walters,  2013),  New  York  City  (Winters,  2012),  Texas  (Booker  et  al.,  2007)  and  Utah 
36:1113:96177:20:21:90:525:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(Ni  and  Rorrer,  2012).  The  results  generally  suggest  heterogeneous  effects  of  charters 
36:1114:96275:21:21:90:525:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:which might be either due to the fact that they apply different identification strategies or 
36:1115:96368:21:21:90:525:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:due  to  differential  role of  institutional  settings.  Research  by  Zimmer  et  al.  (2012) 
36:1116:96464:21:20:90:525:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:examines the role of charter schools more comprehensively by looking simultaneously at 
36:1117:96551:20:21:90:525:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:seven  states  but  it  is  important  to  note  that  their  analysis  is  based  on  individual  fixed 
36:1118:96656:21:21:90:525:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:effects and not on random or quasi-random variation. They find mixed results for charter 
36:1119:96745:21:20:90:525:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:school effects and point out that their results rely heavily on the assumptions they make 
36:1120:96835:20:21:90:524:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:along  the  way. This  study  with  such  an  external  validity  would  not  be  possible  without 
36:1121:96935:21:21:90:524:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:administrative  data  available  in  multiple  sites  within  the  US. There  is  also  research  that 
36:1122:97038:21:21:90:525:108:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:considers lotteries and open enrollment to schools that are not necessarily private schools. 
36:1123:97131:21:0:90:524:87:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Cullen, Jacob and Levitt (2006) find little evidence for improvements of achievement of 
37:1124:97221:0:21:90:524:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:lottery  winners  in  Chicago,  while  Deming  et  al.  (2014)  find  increases  in  college 
37:1125:97314:21:21:90:525:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:attainment among lottery winners in Charlotte-Mecklenburg. Free school choice seems to 
37:1126:97401:21:20:90:524:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:also  benefit  students  in  Israel  (Lavy,  2010). Clearly,  more  work  is  needed  in  order  to 
37:1127:97501:20:21:90:525:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:gauge the degree to which specific programs and identification strategies are responsible 
37:1128:97591:21:21:90:240:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:for differing research findings. 
37:1129:97623:21:21:126:525:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Another  strand  of  this  agenda  considers  the  role  of  parents  in  school  choice  in 
37:1130:97716:21:20:90:524:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:England  (Burgess  et  al.,  forthcoming),  Beijing (Lai,  Sadoulet  and  de  Janvry,  2009)  and 
37:1131:97814:20:21:90:524:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Charlotte-Mecklenburg  (Hastings  and  Weinstein,  2008).  There  is  also  research  that 
37:1132:97905:21:21:90:525:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:considers the importance of accurate information on school quality when school choice is 
37:1133:97994:21:20:90:525:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:available in England (Allen and Burgess, 2013); and that examines the potential negative 
37:1134:98082:20:21:90:525:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:spillovers  from  school  choice, like  grade  inflation  in  Sweden  (Wikstrom and  Wikstrom, 
37:1135:98176:21:21:90:525:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2005). Finally, competition and school choice may affect not only students but also their 
37:1136:98266:21:21:90:524:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:teachers, and we discuss this research agenda below where we focus more broadly on the 
37:1137:98353:21:20:90:216:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:labor market for teachers. 
37:1138:98379:20:21:126:525:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Much of the early research using administrative data focused on the labor market 
37:1139:98460:21:21:90:524:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:for teachers but the interest in this topic did not decline over time. In fact other countries 
37:1140:98554:21:20:90:525:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and states started contributing papers studying teachers.  In the United States we observe 
37:1141:98644:20:21:90:524:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:researchers  in  a large  number  of  states  investigating  the  labor  market  for  teachers; 
37:1142:98740:21:21:90:524:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:specific  examples  include  the  use  of  administrative  data  in Alaska,  Arkansas,  Colorado, 
37:1143:98838:21:20:90:525:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Florida,  Illinois,  Georgia,  Kentucky,  Michigan,  Missouri,  North  Carolina,  New  York, 
37:1144:98931:20:21:90:525:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Ohio,  Pennsylvania,  Texas,  Washington, and  Wisconsin.  Outside  of  the  United States 
37:1145:99020:21:21:90:525:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:teachers  have  been  studied  in Israel, Italy,  Norway,  Sweden, and Venezuela.  The  most 
37:1146:99112:21:21:90:525:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:widely  studied  question  is  likely  the  teacher  labor  supply  and  mobility  that  has  been 
37:1147:99211:21:20:90:524:232:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:investigated within the United States in Florida  (Feng, 2010), Georgia (Scafidi, Sjoquist

37:1150:99469:21:20:90:525:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:York (Brewer, 1996), Texas (Hanushek, Kain and Rivkin, 2004), Washington (Theobald, 
37:1151:99553:20:21:90:524:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:1990),  Wisconsin  (Imezeki,  2005);  and  internationally  in  Italy  (Barbieri,  Rossetti and 
37:1152:99648:21:0:90:525:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Sestito,  2011),  Norway  (Falch  and  Strom,  2005),  Sweden  (Karbownik,  2014)  and 
38:1153:99737:0:21:90:524:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Venezuela  (Ortega,  2010)19. The  broad  conclusion  from  these  papers  is  that  school

38:1155:99928:21:20:90:524:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:those  of  higher  quality,  but  particular  factors  differ  across  sites  in  both  whether  they 
38:1156:100030:20:21:90:257:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:matter and how much they matter. 
38:1157:100062:21:21:126:524:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Another related topic that is present only in the United States research, to the best 
38:1158:100147:21:21:90:525:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of  our  knowledge, is  the  role  of  teacher  retirement and  the  retirement  benefits.  This 
38:1159:100242:21:20:90:525:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:particular  question  has  been  studied  in  Arkansas  (Costrell  and  McGee,  2010),  Illinois

38:1162:100521:21:20:90:525:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Goldhaber,  2010).  Some  other  studies  consider  the  role  of  incentives  in  improving 
38:1163:100614:20:21:90:525:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:teacher  performance  in  Denver  (Goldhaber  and  Walch,  2012),  Chicago  (Jacob,  2013),

38:1166:100857:21:20:126:524:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:A  lot  of  attention  in  the  United States has  also  been  given  to  the  interaction 
38:1167:100947:20:21:90:525:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:between  the  schools,  teachers  and  their  students.  School  accountability  was  introduced 
38:1168:101044:21:21:90:525:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:voluntarily by many states in the 1990s but with the introduction of the federal No Child

38:1170:101222:20:21:90:525:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:performance  of  their  students,  which  by  extension  allowed  calculations  of  value  added 
38:1171:101319:21:21:90:525:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:measures, assessment of teacher effectiveness and as an unintended side-effect produced

38:1178:101956:21:21:90:524:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:been   examined   in   two   other   English   speaking   countries,   mainly   England   (Ray,

38:1180:102107:20:21:126:525:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:There  are  many  other  research  themes  that  we  did  not  cover  in  this  brief  review 
38:1181:102201:21:32:90:524:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and which gained considerable attention in the research community. To name a few from

39:1196:103500:21:21:90:525:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:educational  data  sets  used  worldwide  to  address  very  specific  research  questions.  These 
39:1197:103599:21:21:90:525:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:would be GED takers in Florida and Texas (Tyler, Murnane and Willett, 2004), principals 
39:1198:103687:21:20:90:525:439:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in Illinois and North Carolina (Gates et al., 2006), college entry exam takers in Michigan

39:1201:103896:21:20:126:524:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:In  summary, there  is  a  growing  prevalence  in  the  use  of  administrative  data  in 
39:1202:103987:20:21:90:525:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:educational research and in this section we hoped to provide some brief overview of this 
39:1203:104076:21:21:90:524:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:phenomenon internationally. We did not and could not aim to be complete here, however, 
39:1204:104163:21:20:90:525:315:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:our  goal  was  to  provide  useful  examples  of  applications  and  data  types  utilized  in 
39:1205:104259:20:21:90:524:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:different countries. It is clear that there are many opportunities to study new questions in 
39:1206:104351:21:21:90:525:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:new environments, and  we expect that the explosion in the use of administrative data in 
39:1207:104440:21:21:90:362:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:education research will only continue to expand rapidly.

39:1209:104496:21:20:90:174:211:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:C:VI. Conclusions 
39:1210:104511:20:21:126:525:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: It  is  evident  that  administrative  data  present  a  world  of  opportunity,  and  while 
39:1211:104604:21:20:90:525:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:there are clearly challenges associated with the use of administrative data, the benefits of 
39:1212:104697:20:21:90:525:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:collecting these data and using them for research and policy purposes surely outweigh the 
39:1213:104787:21:21:90:525:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:costs  involved.  While  administrative  data  are  not  a  substitute  for  many  purpose-built 
39:1214:104884:21:21:90:524:108:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:survey  data,  in  the  cases  in  which  they  are  substitutes  they  have  the  potential  to  save 
39:1215:104987:21:0:90:525:87:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:taxpayers  considerable  amounts  of  money  while  delivering  better-quality  data,  and  of 
40:1216:105084:0:21:90:525:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:course  there  are  many  ways  in  which  administrative  data  can  make  survey  data  better, 
40:1217:105182:21:21:90:524:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:more  cost-effective,  and  more  flexible. The  availability  of  these  data  has  led  to  new 
40:1218:105280:21:20:90:525:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:research   questions   that   had   previously   not   been   addressable   being   studied;   the 
40:1219:105379:20:21:90:524:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:overturning  of  conventional  wisdom  through  higher-quality  research  designs  made 
40:1220:105467:21:21:90:525:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:possible by better data; and more data-driven policymaking in education. All of these are 
40:1221:105557:21:21:90:525:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:victories  for  both  research  and  policy. Given  the  remarkable  progress  of  computing 
40:1222:105650:21:20:90:525:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:power and capacity, it is in the best interest of both science and policy to make good use 
40:1223:105741:20:21:90:525:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of  these  administratively-collected  data  while  following  best  practices  in  data  security 
40:1224:105840:21:21:90:525:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and ethics. Furthering partnerships and trust relationships between the entities that collect 
40:1225:105934:21:20:90:525:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  administer  these  administrative  data  and  members  of  the  scholarly  community,  and 
40:1226:106030:20:21:90:524:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:developing  de-identified data  sets  that  will  protect  privacy  and  confidentiality  while 
40:1227:106126:21:21:90:459:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:furthering research will benefit taxpayers, policy makers and scholars alike.
