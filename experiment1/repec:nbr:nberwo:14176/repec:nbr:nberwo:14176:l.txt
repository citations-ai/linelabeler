2:32:1617:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:!:The province of Ontario has two publicly funded school systems: secular schools (known as public
2:33:1713:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:!:schools) that are open to all students, and separate schools that are open to children with Catholic backgrounds.
2:34:1826:14:14:72:539:560:12:Times:12:Times:!:The systems are administered independently and receive equal funding per student.  In this paper
2:35:1922:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:!:we use detailed school and student-level data to assess whether competition between the systems leads
2:36:2023:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:!:to improved efficiency.  Building on a simple model of school choice, we argue that incentives for
2:37:2121:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:!:effort will be greater in areas where there are more Catholic families, and where these families are
2:38:2221:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:!:less committed to a particular system. To measure the local determinants of cross-system competition
2:39:2321:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:!:we study the effects of school openings on enrollment growth at nearby elementary schools. We find
2:40:2419:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:!:significant cross-system responses to school openings, with a magnitude that is proportional to the
2:41:2518:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:!:fraction of Catholics in the area, and is higher in more rapidly growing areas. We then test whether
2:42:2618:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:!:schools that face greater cross-system competition have higher productivity, as measured by test score
2:43:2720:14:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:!:gains between 3rd and 6th grade.  We estimate a statistically significant but modest-sized impact of
2:44:2820:14:14:72:540:420:12:Times:12:Times:!:potential competition on the growth rate of student achievement.  The estimates suggest that extending
2:45:2922:14:42:72:540:406:12:Times:12:Times:!:competition to all students would raise average test scores in 6th grade by 6-8% of a standard deviation.

3:64:3367:0:27:107:528:708:144:Times:144:g_d0_f1:A: Faced with budgetary pressure and growing concerns over student achievement, policy 
3:65:3451:27:28:71:530:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:makers around the world are struggling to raise the efficiency of public schools.1  Starting with 
3:66:3549:28:27:72:540:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Friedman (1955) many economists have argued that a cost-effective way to boost performance is 
3:67:3643:27:28:72:518:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:to limit the monopoly power of local school districts.  For this prescription to work, families 
3:68:3739:28:28:72:518:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:have to be able to choose between schools, and be willing to switch schools to access higher 
3:69:3832:28:27:72:517:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:quality education.  School administrators also have to be rewarded for producing the quality 
3:70:3925:27:28:72:530:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:features that parents demand.  So far, choice initiatives enacted in the U.S. have gone only part 
3:71:4023:28:27:72:268:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:way toward satisfying these conditions.2 
3:72:4063:27:28:108:530:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Alternatives to the local monopoly model have a much longer history outside the U.S.3  
3:73:4150:28:28:71:543:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:In this paper we study competition among elementary schools in Ontario, Canada, which for over 
3:74:4245:28:27:71:522:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:Times:B:a century has operated two publicly funded school systems: secular schools (known as public 
3:75:4337:27:28:71:500:405:144:Times:144:g_d0_f1:B:schools) that are open to all students, and separate schools that are open to children with 
3:76:4429:28:27:71:514:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Catholic backgrounds.4  The two systems are administered independently and receive equal 
3:77:4518:27:28:72:171:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:funding per student. 
3:78:4539:28:27:108:534:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:For non-Catholics, the Ontario system functions like a typical public system in the U.S.  
3:79:4629:27:28:72:540:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:For the roughly 40% of children with Catholic backgrounds, however, the system is essentially a 
3:80:4725:28:28:72:495:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:voucher program with two competing suppliers.  Though choice is limited to Catholics, 
3:81:4811:28:27:72:542:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:Times:B:competition between the systems can potentially improve the quality of schooling available to all 
3:82:4909:27:34:72:536:212:144:Times:144:g_d0_f1:B:students.  Measuring the size of these potential gains is important not only for understanding the

3:85:5162:11:16:72:529:159:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:2 Two main initiatives to loosen the control of local school districts are charter schools and school vouchers.  See

3:88:5494:7:16:72:513:124:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:3 Clark (2005) studies the efficiency of English high schools that opt out of local school district control, while 
3:89:5609:16:11:71:530:108:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:Gibbons, Machin, and Silva (2006) analyze competition between public schools in England.  Ahlin (2003) studies 
3:90:5720:11:7:71:481:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:the effects of competition in Sweden.  Hsieh and Urquiola (2006) study the voucher system in Chile.   
3:91:5822:7:16:72:539:90:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:4 More precisely, we study the incentives for administrative effort and efficiency when students can choose between 
3:92:5938:16:0:71:413:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:school systems.  We follow the literature in referring to this as “school competition.” 
4:93:6028:0:27:71:541:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Ontario system, but also for analyzing proposed choice systems in other settings.  The impacts of 
4:94:6126:27:28:71:528:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:competition in the Ontario system presumably represent a lower bound on the efficiency gains 
4:95:6219:28:27:71:303:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:that could be realized in a more general system. 
4:96:6268:27:28:107:529:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:We begin by outlining a simple model of school choice and effort competition between 
4:97:6353:28:28:71:525:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:public and separate schools.  Assuming that Catholic enrollment in public schools depends on 
4:98:6446:28:27:71:509:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:the quality gap between the local public and separate schools, and that the managers of the 
4:99:6538:27:28:71:521:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:competing systems are rewarded for larger market shares, the model implies that equilibrium 
4:100:6630:28:27:71:532:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:effort will be higher in markets with a larger share of Catholics, and where Catholic parents are 
4:101:6728:27:28:71:432:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:less committed to a particular environment (religious or secular) at school. 
4:102:6805:28:28:107:514:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:To identify the neighborhood characteristics that lead to greater incentives for effort 
4:103:6893:28:27:71:516:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:competition, we study the effects of elementary school openings and closings on enrollment 
4:104:6984:27:28:71:531:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:trends at nearby schools.  We find that the opening of a new school by the rival system leads to 
4:105:7081:28:27:71:542:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:enrollment losses of 6-10% over the next three years.  The cross-system losses are approximately 
4:106:7178:27:28:71:521:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:proportional to the fraction of Catholic families in the area, and are larger in rapidly-growing 
4:107:7275:28:27:71:353:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:areas where families have weaker ties to specific schools.  
4:108:7335:27:28:107:511:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A: We then evaluate the effect of enhanced competition on student achievement, using 
4:109:7417:28:28:71:518:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:standardized tests that are administered province-wide to 3rd and 6th graders.  We develop an 
4:110:7511:28:27:72:536:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:econometric model for the test score gains of a cohort of students at a given school that depends 
4:111:7609:27:28:71:541:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:on student and local area characteristics, and on an indicator of cross-system competition derived 
4:112:7708:28:27:71:541:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:from our enrollment growth model.  A key identifying assumption is that variation in the fraction 
4:113:7806:27:28:71:529:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:of Catholic families in the surrounding neighborhood has no direct effect on test score gains of 
4:114:7903:28:28:72:524:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:students, though it affects the sensitivity of enrollment demand to relative school quality.  We 
4:115:8000:28:0:72:520:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:present evidence suggesting that Catholic parents and children have similar characteristics to 
5:116:8097:0:27:71:538:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Protestants, although both groups differ from those with no religious affiliation (who have lower 
5:117:8195:27:28:71:540:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:parental education and lower student test scores).  Thus, our preferred specifications measure the 
5:118:8294:28:27:71:521:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:effect of changes in the degree of cross-system competition, holding constant the fractions of 
5:119:8389:27:28:71:281:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:groups other than Catholics or Protestants.  
5:120:8434:28:28:107:529:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A: We estimate modest but statistically significant impacts of enhanced effort competition 
5:121:8522:28:27:71:518:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:on the growth rate of mathematics and reading achievement between 3rd and 6th grades.  The 
5:122:8613:27:28:72:525:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:estimates imply that extending choice to all students in the province would lead to gains in 6th 
5:123:8709:28:27:71:520:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:grade reading and mathematics scores on the order of 0.06-0.08 of a standard deviation, with 
5:124:8802:27:28:71:250:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:larger effects in fast-growing areas.

5:129:9038:27:28:72:525:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:competition in increasing public school performance. Couch et al. (1993) related district-wide 
5:130:9133:28:27:71:540:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:test scores at public schools to the fraction of local students in private schools and interpreted the 
5:131:9236:27:28:71:540:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:positive correlation as evidence of a competition effect.6  Hoxby (1994) noted that private school 
5:132:9335:28:28:72:515:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:enrollment will vary with the quality of local public schools, causing an endogeneity bias in 
5:133:9429:28:27:72:497:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Couch et al.’s specification.  Using the fraction of Catholics in a metropolitan area as an 
5:134:9521:27:28:72:487:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:instrument for private enrollment, Hoxby obtained a positive effect on test outcomes.  
5:135:9608:28:27:72:515:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Subsequent instrumental variables (IV) studies (e.g., Arum, 1996, Jepsen, 2003) have found 
5:136:9699:27:28:72:508:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:weaker effects, and an extensive re-analysis by Jepsen (2002) concludes that the effects of 
5:137:9791:28:20:72:505:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:private school competition in the U.S. are probably small.  Our research design is similar,

5:139:9931:28:11:72:541:101:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:5 See Belfield and Levin (2002) for a comprehensive review of studies of competition in public education in the U.S. 
5:140:10048:11:16:72:511:90:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:6 Subsequent studies using the same approach (Newmark, 1995; Sander, 1999; Geller et al. 2006) have found 
5:141:10154:16:0:71:525:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:generally insignificant effects.  An exception is Dee (1998), who estimates a positive effect on graduation rates.   
6:142:10273:0:27:71:484:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:although in our setting Catholic schools are free and readily accessible in virtually all 
6:143:10363:27:28:71:515:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:neighborhoods in the province.  Moreover, they have the same resources per pupil as public 
6:144:10454:28:27:71:539:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:schools, and follow the same curriculum.7  We conjecture that the competitive pressure posed by 
6:145:10550:27:28:72:536:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:the separate school system (which educates over one-quarter of Ontario students) is greater than 
6:146:10647:28:28:72:475:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:the pressure from private schools in the U.S. (which only educate 10% of students). 
6:147:10731:28:27:108:537:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A: A second group of studies examines Tiebout competition between public school districts 
6:148:10818:27:28:71:494:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:in the same geographic area.  Borland and Howsen (1992) used the Herfindahl index of 
6:149:10903:28:27:71:528:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:enrollment shares at different school districts as a measure of Tiebout competition and found a 
6:150:10999:27:28:71:511:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:slightly negative effect on public school test scores.8  Arguing that district fragmentation is 
6:151:11095:28:28:72:480:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:endogenous, Hoxby (2000) used the number of rivers and streams running through a 
6:152:11176:28:27:72:526:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:metropolitan area as an instrument for the Herfindahl index and obtained positive competition 
6:153:11270:27:28:72:534:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:effects.  Re-analyzing these results, Rothstein (2006a) found smaller and generally insignificant 
6:154:11368:28:27:72:538:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:effects from a range of alternative specifications.  Rothstein (2006b) found little effect of district 
6:155:11471:27:28:72:510:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:fragmentation on sorting between districts, suggesting that Tiebout competition is limited.  
6:156:11564:28:27:108:539:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A: Direct evidence on voucher-based competition comes from a study of Chilean schools by 
6:157:11650:27:28:72:525:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Hsieh and Urquiola (2006).  Using comparisons across different municipalities, they found no

6:159:11838:28:27:72:513:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:outcomes.  Consistent with theoretical analyses by Epple and Romano (1998) and Nechyba 
6:160:11925:27:28:72:528:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:(2000), however, they find that the introduction of vouchers leads to increased stratification of

6:163:12098:48:16:72:536:136:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:7 The Ministry of Education publishes detailed specifications for the performance expectations of students by grade 
6:164:12214:16:12:71:541:120:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:in all subjects (see Ontario Ministry of Education, 2005).  The standardized tests we use in this paper are designed to 
6:165:12334:12:7:71:242:108:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:measure progress toward these objectives. 
6:166:12376:7:16:72:540:101:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:8 In an interesting district-level analysis, Millimet and Rangaprasad (2006) test for strategic interactions between the 
6:167:12497:16:11:71:523:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:input choices of nearby school districts in Illinois, and report positive and generally significant effects of nearby 
6:168:12615:11:0:71:528:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:competitors’ choices on a district’s choices over pupil/teacher ratios, spending per pupil, and average school size. 
7:169:12734:0:27:107:512:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A: A third literature compares the test scores of students at private and public schools.  
7:170:12822:27:28:71:522:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Coleman, Hoffer and Kilgore (1982) documented that private school students in the U.S. (the 
7:171:12914:28:27:71:532:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:majority of whom attend Catholic schools) have higher test scores than public school students.  
7:172:13010:27:28:71:516:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Cain and Goldberger (1982) cautioned that selectivity biases could account for this gap, and 
7:173:13103:28:28:71:506:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:subsequent studies have used either Catholic religion, distance to a Catholic school, or the 
7:174:13196:28:27:71:510:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:interaction of Catholic religion and distance to a Catholic school as instruments for private 
7:175:13290:27:28:71:528:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:school choice (e.g., Evans and Schwab, 1995; Neal, 1997; Grogger and Neal, 2000; Figlio and 
7:176:13382:28:27:71:529:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Ludwig, 2000).  Recently, Altonji, Elder, and Taber (2005b) have shown that all three of these 
7:177:13477:27:28:71:527:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:instruments have a direct correlation with student graduation rates, potentially invalidating the 
7:178:13575:28:28:71:534:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:IV design.  As discussed below, our identification strategy relies on comparisons between areas 
7:179:13671:28:27:71:519:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:with different fractions of Catholic families to identify cross-system competition effects.  To 
7:180:13767:27:28:71:520:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:address the concern raised by Altonji et al.’s findings, we focus on comparisons that vary the 
7:181:13862:28:27:71:515:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:fraction of Catholics, while holding constant the fraction of groups other than Catholics and 
7:182:13956:27:28:71:517:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Protestants in an area.  We establish that in our data and in the sample used by Altonji et al., 
7:183:14053:28:27:71:530:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Catholics and Protestants have very similar parental education and test score outcomes, though 
7:184:14148:27:28:71:409:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:both have better outcomes than families with no religious affiliation.

7:187:14271:27:28:71:206:212:144:Times:144:Times:C:a. Institutional Background 
7:188:14299:28:27:107:514:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Two parallel publicly-funded school systems have co-existed in Ontario since 1841. 
7:189:14382:27:28:71:531:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Originally both systems were financed by local property taxes, with ratepayers choosing which 
7:190:14476:28:28:71:542:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:system to support.  A provincial equalization system was introduced in the 1930s, and since 1985 
7:191:14573:28:0:71:531:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:the Ontario government has provided (roughly) equal funding for all elementary and secondary 
8:192:14668:0:27:71:536:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:schools operated by the two systems.9  Today, Ontario public schools are secular and are legally 
8:193:14765:27:28:72:503:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:required to accept all students, whereas separate schools restrict enrollment to children of 
8:194:14858:28:27:71:502:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Catholic backgrounds.10  The province is partitioned into overlapping grids of public and 
8:195:14948:27:28:71:515:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:separate school “boards”.  As of 2003, there were 31 English speaking public school boards 
8:196:15039:28:28:71:537:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:(with an average enrollment of 44,000) and 29 English speaking separate school boards (with an 
8:197:15134:28:27:71:535:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:average enrollment of 18,000).  There were also 23 “school authorities” that operated schools in 
8:198:15231:27:28:71:409:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:remote rural areas, and a handful of French-language school boards.11 
8:199:15300:28:27:108:519:515:144:Times:144:g_d0_f1:A: Teachers in the two systems are covered by collective bargaining agreements and are 
8:200:15384:27:28:72:488:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:paid similar salaries.  As noted above, both systems also follow the same standardized 
8:201:15471:28:28:72:506:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:curriculum.  School construction costs for both systems are financed by a provincial grant 
8:202:15562:28:27:72:498:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:program that compares enrollment to capacity at the school board level.  Effectively, the 
8:203:15652:27:28:72:537:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:province operates two “public” school systems, one of which is only available to students with a 
8:204:15749:28:27:72:181:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Catholic background.

8:213:16343:12:16:72:524:124:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:10 Separate schools have some discretion in setting the degree of “Catholicism” required for admission, but most 
8:214:16456:16:11:72:538:108:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:limit enrollment to baptized Catholics, or the children of a baptized Catholic.  Separate schools can also in principle 
8:215:16576:11:7:72:310:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:deny admission to students for behavioral or other reasons. 
8:216:16636:7:16:72:534:90:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:11 About 5% of students attend private schools that receive no public funding.  We ignore these schools throughout

11:269:20469:27:28:72:532:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:where θ>0 reflects the relative weight on market share.15  The first order conditions for optimal 
11:270:20567:28:28:72:162:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:effort choices are:

11:273:20673:28:27:72:408:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:In equilibrium both managers supply the same level of effort e*, with

11:275:20788:28:28:71:516:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Since q′(e) is decreasing in e, equilibrium effort is increasing in (n2/n)s′(0), the derivative of

11:277:20979:27:28:71:533:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Catholic families have choice, equilibrium effort varies with the local fraction of Catholics, and

11:282:21259:27:28:107:503:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A: In the absence of direct information on school quality it is difficult to measure the 
11:283:21345:28:27:71:514:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:reaction of market shares to relative quality.  Assuming enrollment choice is generated by a 
11:284:21438:27:28:71:494:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:random utility model, however, useful insights can be gained by studying the change in 
11:285:21525:28:75:71:530:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:enrollment at a given school when the competing system opens or closes a nearby school.  The

11:287:21666:83:16:72:529:101:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:15 Equivalently one could assume that managers are rewarded for the number of students they attract.  Friedman’s 
11:288:21779:16:11:71:517:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:(1955) original voucher proposal was predicated on the idea that managers receive a payoff proportional to the 
11:289:21890:11:0:71:205:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:number of students they attract.   
12:290:21928:0:27:71:496:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:reason is that local demand responses to variation in quality and travel distance are both 
12:291:22019:27:28:71:446:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:governed by heterogeneity in tastes for a religious versus secular education.16 
12:292:22098:28:27:108:530:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:For example, suppose that a new separate school is opened with the same quality as the 
12:293:22185:27:28:72:480:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:existing separate school.  The predicted change in enrollment at the public school is: 
12:294:22272:28:28:108:418:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A: ∂Ep/∂Opens  =   n2 ∑k (n2k/n2)  ∂sk(ΔQ, Δtk)/∂Δtk × ∂Δtk/∂Opens   
12:295:22336:28:27:72:525:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:where ∂Δtk/∂Opens represents the relative change in travel costs in neighborhood k to attend a 
12:296:22431:27:28:72:539:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:public versus separate school.17  In neighborhoods that are closer to the new separate school than 
12:297:22530:28:27:72:536:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:the old one this expression is negative, leading some families to switch systems.  From equation 
12:298:22627:27:28:72:465:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:(2), however, the responses to change in travel costs and quality are proportional: 
12:299:22711:28:28:72:336:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:(7) ∂sk(ΔQ, Δtk)/∂Δtk =   − γ/β ∂sk(ΔQ, Δtk)/∂ΔQ  . 
12:300:22761:28:27:72:540:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Thus, the enrollment loss when a nearby school is opened can be expressed as a weighted sum of 
12:301:22856:27:28:72:465:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:the derivatives of the market shares in each neighborhood with respect to quality: 
12:302:22938:28:27:72:458:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:(8) ∂Ep/∂Opens  =   − γ/β   n2 ∑k (n2k/n2)  ∂sk(ΔQ, Δtk )/∂ΔQ × ∂Δtk/∂Opens , 
12:303:23014:27:28:72:522:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:where the weight, ∂Δtk/∂Opens, depends on the change in relative travel costs experienced by 
12:304:23107:28:28:71:520:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:families in each neighborhood.  Assuming that the travel cost changes are a function of local 
12:305:23201:28:27:71:497:294:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:geography and don’t covary with the distribution of tastes, we can use differences in the 
12:306:23291:27:28:72:537:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:observed changes in enrollment following nearby openings by the competing system to infer the 
12:307:23385:28:27:72:533:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:relative sensitivity of enrollment demand to quality.  In particular, neighborhood characteristics 
12:308:23484:27:28:72:516:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:that are associated with bigger enrollment losses when a competing school is opened nearby 
12:309:23575:28:28:72:541:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:would be expected to generate more elastic enrollment demand with respect to quality, leading to 
12:310:23672:28:36:72:239:156:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:more intensive effort competition.

12:312:23755:43:16:72:536:113:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:16 A similar idea is used by Bucklin, Russell, and Srinivasan (1998) to show that the cross-price elasticity of market 
12:313:23874:16:7:72:446:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:shares for competing brands is proportional to the probabilities of switching between brands. 
12:314:23968:7:16:72:502:90:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:17 For simplicity we are assuming that the changes in travel times dΔtk are small enough that the change in

13:317:24211:27:28:107:508:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Contrary to our simplified model, the public and separate systems operate multiple 
13:318:24294:28:27:71:529:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:schools.  Since both systems use attendance zones to assign neighborhoods to specific schools, 
13:319:24389:27:28:71:541:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:each family’s choice problem is the same as in the simplified two-school case.  The effort-setting 
13:320:24488:28:28:71:519:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:game is more complicated, however, because in general each school manager competes with 
13:321:24576:28:27:71:498:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:multiple managers in the opposing system. Nevertheless, as we show in Appendix 1, the 
13:322:24662:27:28:71:511:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:equilibrium has the same qualitative properties as in the two-school case.  In particular, the 
13:323:24757:28:27:71:535:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:incentives for effort depend on the local fraction of Catholic students, and on the degree of taste 
13:324:24857:27:28:71:515:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:heterogeneity among Catholic families for a secular versus Catholic education.  These same 
13:325:24948:28:28:71:516:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:characteristics also affect the magnitude of the enrollment losses experienced by an existing

13:327:25135:27:28:71:519:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:insight to develop measures of the cross-system competitive pressure in different geographic

13:332:25359:27:28:107:535:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:We obtained a file from the Province of Ontario with information on annual enrollments 
13:333:25446:28:27:71:517:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:by grade at all publicly-funded schools between 1990 and 2004.  Using this file, we define a 
13:334:25539:27:28:71:541:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:newly opened elementary school as one that has positive enrollment in grades 2-4 in a given year 
13:335:25636:28:27:71:519:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:(the “opening year”) and zero total enrollment in all previous years.18  Similarly, we define a 
13:336:25732:27:60:72:531:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:recently closed elementary school as one with positive enrollment in grades 2-4 in a given year

13:338:25876:67:16:72:530:90:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:18 We include “French Immersion” schools as they are offered by the English language school boards.  During the 
13:339:25988:16:0:72:503:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:1990s there were roughly 2300 public elementary schools and 1100 separate schools in operation in a year. 
14:340:26097:0:27:71:520:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:and zero enrollment in the next year (the “closing year”) and all subsequent years.19   Further 
14:341:26193:27:28:72:269:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:information is provided in Appendix 2.   
14:342:26234:28:27:108:532:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Panel A of Table 1 presents some descriptive information on the opening and closing of 
14:343:26321:27:28:72:507:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:elementary schools operated by English language school boards.  Over the 15 years of our 
14:344:26410:28:28:72:534:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:sample period there were 252 openings and 212 closings in the public system and 169 openings 
14:345:26503:28:27:72:531:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:and 102 closings in the separate school system.  As shown in the second column of the panel, a 
14:346:26598:27:28:72:542:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:disproportionate share of the events occurred in the second half of our sample period, reflecting a 
14:347:26698:28:27:71:533:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:major consolidation of school boards in 1998.  Geographically, elementary school openings are 
14:348:26792:27:28:71:540:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:concentrated in the rapidly growing ring of cities and suburbs around Toronto, while closings are 
14:349:26890:28:28:71:519:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:concentrated in slower growing rural areas and the inner-city areas of Toronto.  We matched 
14:350:26982:28:27:71:517:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:schools to Census information tabulated at the neighborhood level (defined by the first three 
14:351:27076:27:28:71:540:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:characters of the school’s postal code) to compare neighborhoods with openings and closings.  A 
14:352:27172:28:27:72:518:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:key difference is in the fraction of houses built in the neighborhood between 1991 and 2001, 
14:353:27265:27:28:72:521:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:which averages 33% for neighborhoods where there were only school openings versus 6% in 
14:354:27353:28:27:72:288:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:neighborhoods with only school closings.20   
14:355:27398:27:28:108:518:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Our next step is to identify existing schools that were potentially impacted by nearby 
14:356:27485:28:28:72:538:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:openings and/or closings.  For simplicity, we restrict attention to non-rural affected schools.  We 
14:357:27585:28:27:72:523:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:started by including all existing schools in a circle around the newly opened or closed school, 
14:358:27681:27:46:72:509:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:with radius equal to the average travel distance from home to school for students at nearby

14:360:27821:53:16:72:539:159:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:19 Schools are sometimes paired together for administrative purposes.  When this occurs both schools are listed as in 
14:361:27939:16:12:72:542:143:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:operation, though enrollment is only reported at one of the schools.  We identified “pairing events” and verified their 
14:362:28059:12:7:72:488:131:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:status with information from the Ministry of Education.  They are not counted as openings or closings.  
14:363:28163:7:16:72:525:124:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:20 See Appendix Table 1. There is also some variation in income and family structure.  Neighborhoods with only 
14:364:28274:16:11:72:529:108:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:openings have the highest average income and lowest fraction of single parents, whereas those with only closings 
14:365:28387:11:12:72:522:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:have the lowest family incomes and the most single parents.   Differences in religious affiliation, education, and 
14:366:28502:12:11:72:512:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:family size are smaller, although the fraction of immigrants tends to be lower in areas with both openings and 
14:367:28613:11:0:72:320:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:closings than in other areas, as does the fraction of Catholics. 
15:368:28681:0:27:71:535:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:elementary schools (typically around 1 kilometer).21  We then used satellite images and maps to 
15:369:28777:27:28:72:533:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:eliminate schools that were separated from the newly opened or closed school by a major travel 
15:370:28872:28:27:72:540:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:barrier (e.g., a controlled-access highway) – see Appendix 3.  We have checked the sensitivity of 
15:371:28970:27:28:72:539:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:our results to the inclusion of these “rejected” schools and find similar (though typically weaker) 
15:372:29070:28:28:72:405:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:evidence of cross-system enrollment flows when they are included.22 
15:373:29137:28:27:108:528:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A: The third column in Panel A of Table 1 reports the share of opening and closing events 
15:374:29224:27:28:71:538:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:for which we were able to identify at least one non-rural affected school.  This ranges from 45 to 
15:375:29323:28:27:72:537:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:75 percent.  In columns 4 and 5, we report the means and standard deviations of total enrollment 
15:376:29420:27:28:72:532:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:(for grades 1-6) at the opened and closed schools, classified by whether we can identify at least 
15:377:29518:28:28:72:528:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:one affected non-rural school.  Typically, a newly opened school has about 320 students in the 
15:378:29613:28:27:72:343:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:period after opening, while closing schools are smaller.  
15:379:29671:27:28:108:500:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A: Panel B of Table 1 shows the number of affected schools associated with various 
15:380:29751:28:27:72:521:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:opening/closing events, and the average distance between the opening/closing school and the 
15:381:29843:27:28:72:520:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:affected school(s).  Affected schools operated by the competing systems tend to be relatively 
15:382:29937:28:27:72:520:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:close to the opening/closing schools, suggesting that the opening and closing events have the 
15:383:30031:27:28:72:443:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:potential to induce at least some students to move between the rival systems. 
15:384:30109:28:28:108:539:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Panel C of Table 1 shows the distribution of the number of affected schools for each type 
15:385:30199:28:27:72:538:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:of opening or closing event.  On average, a school opening affects 2.6 nearby schools, whereas a 
15:386:30296:27:28:72:537:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:closing affects 3.6 nearby schools.  The smaller number for openings reflects their concentration 
15:387:30394:28:27:72:538:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:in growing suburban areas with a relatively low density of existing schools.  Closing schools, by 
15:388:30492:27:25:72:529:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:comparison, tend to be situated in older neighborhoods where schools are closer together.  The

15:390:30635:33:16:72:533:124:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:21 We obtained information for one year on the postal codes of all students attending each elementary school in the 
15:391:30751:16:7:72:513:108:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:province.  We use the centroids of the postal codes for the schools and the homes to compute travel distances. 
15:392:30862:7:16:72:524:101:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:22 We also created a data set that included only the schools near an opening or closing that are excluded from the 
15:393:30977:16:11:72:526:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:main analysis sample.  The estimated effects of openings and closings on these “excluded” schools are small and 
15:394:31089:11:0:72:178:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:statistically insignificant.  
16:395:31122:0:27:71:536:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:relatively smaller size of closing schools (Panel A) and the fact that each closing affects a larger 
16:396:31223:27:28:71:529:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:number of nearby schools suggests that the impact per affected school may be smaller than the 
16:397:31317:28:27:71:172:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:impact of openings.

16:401:31396:28:27:107:506:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A: Our third step is to estimate the effect of nearby openings and closings on affected 
16:402:31481:27:28:71:498:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:schools.  Of the roughly 2,600 non-rural elementary schools in the province that were in 
16:403:31570:28:27:71:504:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:operation for at least two years between 1990 and 2004, 945 were affected by at least one 
16:404:31660:27:28:71:539:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:opening or closing event and have enrollment data from both before and after the event.23  Using 
16:405:31757:28:28:71:341:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:this sample we estimate enrollment models of the form: 
16:406:31812:28:27:71:507:432:144:g_d0_f1:64:g_d0_f1:*:(9)    ∆Esat   =    Xsatb   +  ∑j=14  Eventjst × { Ds dj−pub + (1−Ds) dj−sep }   +   αs  +   ωt    +  esat , 
16:407:31920:27:28:72:526:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:where ∆Esat is a measure of enrollment growth at school s in area a in year t; Xsat is a vector of 
16:408:32019:28:27:71:473:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:time-varying school and area characteristics; Eventjst is a set of dummies for recent 
16:409:32105:27:28:72:521:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:opening/closing events at nearby schools that affect this school in year t, Ds is a dummy for a 
16:410:32201:28:28:71:526:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:public school, αs is a school fixed effect, ωt is a period fixed effect, and esat represents an error 
16:411:32303:28:27:72:524:294:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:term.  We identify four types of events -- public openings, separate openings, public closings, 
16:412:32399:27:28:72:524:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:and separate closings -- and allow separate coefficients (dj−pub and dj−sep) for the effect of each 
16:413:32499:28:27:72:518:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:event type on nearby public and separate schools.  Note that the models include school fixed 
16:414:32592:27:28:72:530:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:effects.  Thus, the coefficients measure gains or losses in enrollment in the period following an 
16:415:32690:28:52:72:424:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:opening or closing event, allowing for school-specific enrollment trends.

16:417:32812:60:16:72:531:124:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:23 We exclude middle schools that never had any enrollment below 6th grade during the sample period.  Combined 
16:418:32923:16:11:71:541:108:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:schools that have both grades 1-6 and 7-8 are included in our final sample in any year that they have grades 1 to 6. A 
16:419:33042:11:12:71:526:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:cross-classification of affected schools by the number of “affecting events” (i.e. nearby openings and closings) is 
16:420:33158:12:11:71:527:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:presented in Appendix Table 2.  Two-thirds were affected by only one event, and another quarter was affected by 
16:421:33270:11:0:71:444:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:Times:D:exactly two events.  Only about 10% were affected by three or more opening/closing events. 
17:422:33363:0:27:107:533:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A: Our primary measure of enrollment growth is the percentage change in enrollment from 
17:423:33448:27:28:71:524:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:grades 1-5 in the previous year to grades 2-6 in the current year.24  This measure captures any 
17:424:33544:28:27:72:529:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:systematic losses or gains in enrollment among students who are already attending the school.  
17:425:33639:27:28:72:531:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:As an alternative we use the change in grade 1 enrollment from the previous year to the current 
17:426:33735:28:28:72:510:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:year.  This measure is somewhat noisier than the average change in continuing enrollment, 
17:427:33825:28:27:72:523:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:reflecting fluctuations in the size of the grade 1 entry cohort.  On the other hand, to the extent 
17:428:33924:27:28:72:532:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:that parents make a “once for all” school choice when their children enter school, the growth in 
17:429:34021:28:27:72:539:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:first grade enrollment may be more sensitive to changes in the availability of alternative schools. 
17:430:34121:27:28:108:537:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Table 2 presents the means and standard deviations of these two measures.  The first row 
17:431:34210:28:28:72:532:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:also shows average first-grade enrollments.  A typical public school in our sample has about 50 
17:432:34306:28:27:72:542:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:first grade students (and similar enrollments at higher grades), while a typical separate school is a 
17:433:34408:27:28:72:524:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:little smaller (44 students).  Between consecutive years grade 1 enrollment rises at an average 
17:434:34504:28:27:72:537:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:rate of 1.9% in the public schools and 2.4% in separate schools.  Growth rates vary substantially 
17:435:34602:27:28:72:537:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:across schools, with a standard deviation of 26% for the public schools and 31% for the separate 
17:436:34699:28:27:72:536:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:schools.  Average enrollment growth from grades 1-5 to grades 2-6 is smaller (under 1% at both 
17:437:34794:27:28:72:299:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:public and separate schools), and less variable. 
17:438:34843:28:28:108:523:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:As explanatory variables in our enrollment growth models we include an indicator for 
17:439:34928:28:27:72:499:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:whether the school is paired with another school for administrative purposes and a set of 
17:440:35018:27:28:72:479:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:neighborhood-level characteristics.25  The latter are based on linear interpolations of 
17:441:35106:28:41:71:514:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:neighborhood-level Census tabulations from the 1991, 1996, 2001, and 2006 Censuses, and 
17:442:35194:41:7:216:219:143:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:                                                 
17:443:35242:48:16:72:523:136:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:24 Our school level database includes enrollment by grade for each school, as well as the enrollment of ungraded 
17:444:35355:16:12:71:530:120:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:students in special education and other programs.  We allocated these students uniformly across all grades offered 
17:445:35470:12:11:71:540:108:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:by the school.  For schools that do not offer all grades from 1 to 6, we modify the enrollment measure to reflect only 
17:446:35589:11:7:71:327:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:those grades for which the school consistently has enrollment.   
17:447:35654:7:16:72:543:90:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:25 We have explored specifications that also include whether the school has recently opened (within the last 6 years).  
17:448:35774:16:0:72:293:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:The results are similar to those reported in this paper.   
18:449:35836:0:27:71:542:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:include the shares of the population aged 5-9 and 10-14, the share of recently constructed houses, 
18:450:35935:27:28:71:528:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:and various demographic characteristics, including the fractions of residents who are Catholic, 
18:451:36031:28:27:71:534:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:and in different immigrant groups.26  In addition we use our enrollment database to estimate the 
18:452:36128:27:28:71:465:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:fractions of children enrolled in public Francophone schools and private schools.  
18:453:36211:28:28:107:474:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:A key issue for the specification of equation (9) is the lag structure between 
18:454:36290:28:27:71:486:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:opening/closing events and subsequent enrollment changes at nearby schools.  This is 
18:455:36375:27:28:71:505:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:particularly important for openings, since new schools often open at reduced capacity and 
18:456:36465:28:27:72:521:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:expand slowly as facilities are completed.  We investigated this by allowing the dummies for 
18:457:36558:27:28:72:516:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:nearby events to “turn on” for different lengths of time, and by considering specifications in 
18:458:36653:28:28:71:534:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:which nearby events cause a permanent shift in the growth rate of enrollment (i.e., the dummies 
18:459:36749:28:27:71:537:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:remain on indefinitely).  The results showed that the effects of openings and closings on schools 
18:460:36847:27:28:71:538:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:in the same system emerge quickly, whereas the effects on schools in the competing system take 
18:461:36942:28:27:71:526:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:at least 3 years to stabilize.  We therefore “turn on” the indicators for nearby events in each of 
18:462:37041:27:28:71:537:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:the three years following an event, and assume no impact before and after.  Our key findings are 
18:463:37138:28:27:71:265:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:similar if we allow 4 or 5 year impacts.  
18:464:37180:27:28:107:534:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Table 3 shows the estimated effects of school openings on enrollment changes at nearby 
18:465:37267:28:28:71:540:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:schools in the same and the opposing system from alternative specifications of equation (9).   All 
18:466:37366:28:27:71:516:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:of the models also include the effect of nearby closings.  As discussed in more detail below, 
18:467:37460:27:28:71:517:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:however, the cross-system effects of closings are never large, and in the interest of space we 
18:468:37555:28:18:72:395:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:report the coefficients for the closing effects in Appendix Table 3.

18:470:37673:25:16:72:540:159:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:26 Measures on religion were only collected in the 1991 and 2001 Censuses.  Neighborhood tabulations are available 
18:471:37788:16:12:72:530:143:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:by so-called “Forward Sortation Area” (FSA) which is based on the first 3 characters of the postal code, and has a 
18:472:37903:12:11:72:535:131:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:typical population of about 5,000 households.  In assigning FSA characteristics to schools, we use boundaries as of 
18:473:38019:11:12:72:502:120:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:1996, and link FSA’s across Census years using information provided by Statistics Canada.   1991 data are 
18:474:38125:12:11:72:525:108:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:unavailable for a few FSAs: in these cases we use data for 1996 to assign information to the period from 1990 to 
18:475:38238:11:12:72:514:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:1996.  Across 1996, 2001, 2006 there are a few FSAs that have suppressed information for one or more of the 
18:476:38346:12:11:72:538:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:censuses.  For these FSAs we used the values of measures for the closest FSA with consistent information across all 
18:477:38462:11:0:72:416:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:FSAs.  Summary statistics on the census measures are provided in Appendix Table 1. 
19:478:38548:0:27:107:501:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Columns 1 and 2 present models that include simple dummy variables for nearby 
19:479:38626:27:28:71:533:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:openings and closings.  The model in column1 is fit to changes in grade 1 enrollment, while the 
19:480:38722:28:27:71:529:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:model in column 2 is fit to changes in continuing enrollment between grades 1-5 and 2-6.  The 
19:481:38816:27:28:71:541:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:coefficients in column 1 suggest that nearby openings lead to first grade enrollment reductions of 
19:482:38915:28:28:71:542:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:8-9% per year at nearby schools in the same system in each of the three years after the event (i.e., 
19:483:39016:28:27:71:532:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:a cumulative impact of about 25%).  More important from our perspective are the cross-system 
19:484:39109:27:28:71:515:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:effects, which are also negative, but about one-third as large.  In particular, we estimate that 
19:485:39206:28:27:71:526:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:grade 1 enrollment is reduced by 2-3% in each of the following 3 years (or a 6-9% cumulative 
19:486:39299:27:28:71:527:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:loss) when a nearby school is opened by the competing system.  The opening effects using the 
19:487:39392:28:28:71:536:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:continuing-cohort enrollment change measure (column 2) are similar, although the cross-system 
19:488:39486:28:27:71:514:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:effects are a little smaller than for grade 1 students, potentially reflecting the “stickiness” of 
19:489:39585:27:28:71:305:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:system choice once a student has started school. 
19:490:39634:28:27:107:542:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Although not reported in the table, the estimated closing effects from the specifications in 
19:491:39727:27:28:71:535:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:columns 1 and 2 imply that enrollment rises by 13-20% over the next three years when a nearby 
19:492:39821:28:27:71:538:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:school in the same system closes.  Unlike openings, however, closings seem to have no effect on 
19:493:39917:27:28:71:531:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:enrollment at nearby schools in the competing system.   One explanation for this is that parents 
19:494:40014:28:28:71:540:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:prefer new schools.  In this case, more students will switch systems in response to an opening (to 
19:495:40113:28:27:71:533:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:access a new school) than to a closing.    To test this explanation we estimated the cross-system 
19:496:40211:27:28:71:539:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:responses to nearby openings, allowing different impacts at newer schools (less than 5 years old) 
19:497:40309:28:27:71:523:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:and older schools.  Contrary to our initial expectations the estimates showed somewhat larger 
19:498:40402:27:28:71:228:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:losses at relatively new schools. 
19:499:40436:28:28:107:522:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:An alternative explanation is that Catholic families in relatively new neighborhoods – 
19:500:40523:28:0:71:538:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:where social groups are still in flux, and few families have a connection to existing schools – are 
20:501:40626:0:27:71:516:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:most likely to consider switching between systems.  Since openings are concentrated in fast-
20:502:40718:27:28:71:513:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:growing areas with a higher fraction of new residents, whereas closings are concentrated in 
20:503:40810:28:27:71:538:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:urban neighborhoods with fewer recent arrivals, the cross-system response of enrollment growth 
20:504:40905:27:28:71:528:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:to nearby openings will be relatively large, while the cross-system response to closings will be 
20:505:41002:28:28:71:537:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:small.27  This hypothesis also explains the tendency for bigger cross-system enrollment losses at 
20:506:41100:28:27:72:435:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:relatively new schools, since these tend to be located in fast-growing areas. 
20:507:41178:27:28:108:530:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:To test this explanation we fit a model that allows the effect of nearby openings to vary 
20:508:41268:28:27:72:535:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:with a simple proxy for the newness of the neighborhood − the growth rate of the housing stock 
20:509:41363:27:28:71:522:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:over the 1990s, as measured by the fraction of units in 2001 that were built after 1991.28  The 
20:510:41459:28:28:71:522:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:results are presented in column 3 of Table 3.29   The interaction coefficients show that nearby 
20:511:41555:28:27:72:518:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:openings have larger (i.e., more negative) own-system effects in areas with faster population 
20:512:41649:27:28:72:518:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:growth, particularly for the public system.30   The cross-system opening interactions are also 
20:513:41744:28:27:72:514:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:strongly negative, suggesting that Catholic parents in fast-growing neighborhoods are more 
20:514:41835:27:28:72:504:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:willing to switch systems when the rival system opens a nearby school.  Interestingly, the 
20:515:41926:28:27:72:519:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:implied responses in slow-growth areas are essentially zero –comparable to the cross-system 
20:516:42018:27:28:72:292:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:enrollment flows following school closings.   
20:517:42064:28:28:108:506:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Since only Catholic students can switch between school systems, the cross-system 
20:518:42145:28:61:72:522:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:enrollment losses from nearby openings should also vary with the fraction of Catholics in the 
20:519:42239:61:8:216:219:178:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:                                                 
20:520:42287:69:11:72:492:170:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:27 An extreme version of this argument is that only newly arriving families consider switching systems.   
20:521:42393:11:16:72:500:159:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:28 We have also used an alternative based on local population growth.  This yields qualitatively similar but 
20:522:42502:16:7:72:334:143:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:somewhat less precise estimates for the models presented below. 
20:523:42566:7:16:72:538:136:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:29 Note that the estimated models in Table 4 include reactions to nearby closings, though for simplicity these are not 
20:524:42685:16:7:72:157:120:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:reported in the table. 
20:525:42708:7:16:72:539:113:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:30 The mean of the new housing share variable is 0.17, with a range between 0.01 and 0.98, and a standard deviation 
20:526:42824:16:12:72:540:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:of 0.18. Moreover, the mean new housing share in neighborhoods with school openings about 5 times bigger than in

20:528:43050:11:0:72:356:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:as the growth rate of the neighborhood rises from 0 to the mean value. 
21:529:43124:0:27:71:538:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:local area.31   To test this we include interactions of the cross-system opening indicators with the 
21:530:43225:27:28:72:504:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:fraction of Catholics in the Forward Sortation Area (FSA) in which the school is located.  
21:531:43316:28:27:71:488:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Results for four versions of this specification are reported in columns 4-7 of Table 3.   
21:532:43406:27:28:107:528:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:The specification in column 4 includes both the main effects of cross-system openings, 
21:533:43493:28:28:71:534:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:and their interactions with the local fraction of Catholics.  Judging by the sampling errors of the 
21:534:43593:28:27:71:537:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:estimates from this model we do not have enough power to separately identify the main opening 
21:535:43687:27:28:71:528:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:effects and the interaction terms.  To improve precision, we fit the restricted model reported in 
21:536:43785:28:27:71:503:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:column 5 that excludes the main effects.  This specification imposes the prediction of our 
21:537:43876:27:28:71:530:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:theoretical model that the opening responses are proportional to the fraction of Catholics in the 
21:538:43974:28:28:71:523:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:area, and fits as well as the less restrictive model.  The magnitudes of the coefficients suggest 
21:539:44072:28:27:71:518:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:that in very-high Catholic areas, the cross-system reactions to nearby openings are relatively 
21:540:44167:27:28:71:440:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:large – on the order of one-half the magnitude of the own-system responses. 
21:541:44243:28:27:107:519:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:The model in column 6 of Table 3 allows the cross effects to vary with both the local 
21:542:44329:27:28:71:530:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Catholic share and the growth rate of the local housing stock.  Echoing the results in column 3, 
21:543:44426:28:27:71:537:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:the triple interaction terms (in rows 8 and 12) are large in magnitude and statistically significant, 
21:544:44528:27:28:71:539:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:whereas the two-way interactions of the Catholic share with the opening indicator (in rows 7 and 
21:545:44625:28:28:71:531:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:11) are small.  Our final specification in column 7 therefore drops the Catholic interactions and 
21:546:44723:28:27:71:526:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:includes only the triple interactions of Opening×Catholic Share×Share of New Housing.  This 
21:547:44815:27:28:71:537:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:model fits as well as the preceding one, and implies that in a neighborhood with a growth rate of 
21:548:44913:28:27:71:537:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:0.33 (the mean for neighborhoods with only openings) and a 40% Catholic share, the opening of 
21:549:45007:27:28:71:531:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:a new school by the competing system leads to cumulative enrollment losses of 4-11 percent at 
21:550:45101:28:32:71:529:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:nearby existing schools.  In areas with a greater share of Catholics or faster population growth,

21:552:45247:39:16:72:527:90:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:31 Strictly speaking this is only true if the distribution of preferences for secular versus Catholic education among 
21:553:45365:16:0:72:344:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:Catholic families does not vary with the local fraction of Catholics. 
22:554:45438:0:27:71:537:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:the reactions are bigger, whereas in areas with few Catholics, or negligible growth, the reactions 
22:555:45537:27:28:71:528:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:are essentially 0.  Holding constant area characteristics, the measured cross-system enrollment 
22:556:45633:28:27:71:521:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:responses to a nearby opening are larger at public schools than separate schools, although we 
22:557:45727:27:28:71:352:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:cannot reject equality at conventional significance levels.

22:561:45907:28:27:107:531:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A: The second step in our empirical analysis is to relate the degree of competition between 
22:562:45996:27:28:71:511:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:systems to the academic achievement of students.  Our achievement measures are based on 
22:563:46084:28:28:71:494:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:standardized tests written by students in the 3rd and 6th grades.  Building on the existing

22:570:46743:28:27:72:534:265:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Note that in this specification local competitive pressure is a “market” characteristic that affects 
22:571:46844:27:28:72:543:238:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:the achievement of all students – not just those who attend a specific school or subset of schools.  
22:572:46945:28:28:72:538:210:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Note too that the coefficients in equation (10) are all grade-specific.  In particular, assuming that 
22:573:47047:28:27:71:523:182:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:learning depends on the duration of exposure to the school environment, and that competitive 
22:574:47140:27:28:71:376:155:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:pressure leads to a better environment, we expect that b6I>b3I.   
22:575:47206:28:27:108:535:127:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A: Because of neighborhood sorting, unobserved student abilities are likely to be correlated 
22:576:47296:27:0:72:542:100:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:with school and neighborhood characteristics, leading to biases in OLS estimation of (10).  When 
23:577:47396:0:27:71:533:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:longitudinal student data are available the conventional solution is to estimate the model in first 
23:578:47496:27:28:71:538:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:differences (e.g., Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain, 2005).  Since we cannot link 3rd and 6th grade test 
23:579:47595:28:27:72:512:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:takers in our data base, we follow an alternative approach of including school×cohort fixed 
23:580:47687:27:28:72:539:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:effects and entering the time-invariant school and neighborhood variables as interactions with an 
23:581:47785:28:28:71:282:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:indicator for test takers in 6th grade (Gr6ig):

23:584:48025:28:27:72:528:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:grade at school s at the same time as student i (or in 6th grade at the same school 3 years later), 
23:585:48125:27:28:72:532:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:and e′gisa represents the unexplained component of student i’s score in grade g.   In the presence 
23:586:48224:28:28:72:538:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:of cohort×school fixed effects, we can only identify the differential (or “value-added”) effects of 
23:587:48324:28:27:72:525:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:the time-invariant variables.  Thus, the coefficient on the competitive index is bI=b6I−b3I, with 
23:588:48422:27:28:71:237:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:similar expressions for bz and bw . 
23:589:48458:28:27:108:528:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A: If all students remain at the same school between 3rd and 6th grades, estimates based on 
23:590:48547:27:28:72:537:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:this approach are numerically identical to those from a model of test score gains between 3rd and 
23:591:48645:28:28:72:500:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:6th grades.32  In the presence of student mobility, however, the two approaches will yield 
23:592:48736:28:27:72:520:294:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:different estimates.  For consistent estimation of the value-added coefficients using (11), any 
23:593:48832:27:28:72:528:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:difference in average abilities between the leavers and joiners at a school must be uncorrelated 
23:594:48929:28:27:72:488:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:with the observed covariates.33  We maintain this assumption throughout our analysis. 
23:595:49015:27:28:108:533:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A: A second key assumption is that our measures of competitive pressure are orthogonal to 
23:596:49102:28:28:72:529:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:unobserved determinants of achievement growth.  Based on the analysis in Table 3 we use two 
23:597:49194:28:27:72:526:156:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:measures of local competitive pressure.  The first is just the fraction of Catholic families in an 
23:598:49293:27:20:72:541:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:area.   The second is the product of the local fraction of Catholics and the growth rate of the local 
23:599:49395:20:8:216:219:109:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:                                                 
23:600:49443:28:16:72:516:101:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:32 This assumes that the first differenced specification includes grade-specific coefficients for the time-varying 
23:601:49558:16:7:72:134:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:individual X’s. 
23:602:49574:7:0:72:481:78:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:33 A differenced model, by comparison, requires that school leavers are as good as randomly selected. 
24:603:49679:0:27:71:538:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:area.  Since we do not observe the religion of individual test takers, either of these choices poses 
24:604:49780:27:28:71:533:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:a potential problem if Catholic children have systematically different test score gains than other

25:630:51973:27:28:71:537:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Our final sample includes 65-70% of all public school test takers and a higher fraction (85-96%) 
25:631:52070:28:27:72:519:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:of all separate school test takers.  These students are drawn from approximately 9000 school-
25:632:52163:27:28:72:322:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:cohort groups who attended 2000 different schools. 
25:633:52214:28:28:108:511:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A: Summary statistics for the test outcomes of the analysis sample are presented in the 
25:634:52299:28:27:72:536:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:bottom rows of Table 4.36  We show mean test scores by grade and public/separate school status 
25:635:52394:27:28:72:510:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:for the three main test components: reading, mathematics, and writing.  The test results are 
25:636:52487:28:27:72:526:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:reported on a relatively coarse scale of 1-4, with 4 representing the top score.37  The mean test 
25:637:52585:27:28:72:514:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:score is typically around 2.6 while the standard deviation ranges from 0.6 to 0.8.  Mean test 
25:638:52679:28:28:72:533:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:scores are quite similar in the two systems.  This is quite different than the situation in the U.S., 
25:639:52781:28:27:72:538:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:where students at Catholic schools have substantially higher scores than those at public schools.  
25:640:52880:27:28:72:514:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:The difference is presumably attributable to the very different selectivity of Catholic school 
25:641:52975:28:27:72:517:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:attendees when the schools are free (as in Ontario) than not (as in the U.S.).   Reflecting this 
25:642:53072:27:28:72:505:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:difference, the fraction of Catholic children in Ontario who attend separate schools is also 
25:643:53165:28:27:72:236:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:relatively high (65% on average).

25:646:53260:28:27:108:530:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A: As noted above, a key assumption in our research design is that students in areas with a 
25:647:53349:27:28:72:520:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:higher or lower fraction of Catholics have similar unobserved factors that affect achievement 
25:648:53443:28:18:72:523:184:144:Times:144:g_d0_f1:B:growth.  While the similarity of the test outcomes in public and separate schools in Table 4 is

25:650:53587:25:16:72:525:159:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:35 We have estimated our main models using samples with different exclusion rules and find that the coefficients 
25:651:53700:16:12:72:536:143:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:estimates are similar, though typically a little smaller in absolute value, when we retain school-cohorts with a wider 
25:652:53819:12:7:72:265:131:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:range of variation in the number of test takers.   
25:653:53870:7:16:72:528:124:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:36 Appendix Table 4 shows the mean test score outcomes for the overall samples of test takers, and presents some 
25:654:53983:16:11:72:542:108:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:information on the fractions of students whose scores are missing.  Many of the missing observations are attributable 
25:655:54101:11:7:72:320:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:to exceptional students, who are not required to take the test.  
25:656:54166:7:16:72:502:90:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:37 This limited scale poses a potential attenuation problem, although the fraction of students coded with the 
25:657:54276:16:0:72:452:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:minimum score is less than 10% while the fraction coded with the top score is less than 15%.   
26:658:54374:0:27:71:537:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:broadly consistent with this assumption, we cannot directly test it because we do not observe the 
26:659:54472:27:28:71:520:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:religious affiliation of test-takers.  Instead, we turn to two other data sources.  The first is the 
26:660:54573:28:27:71:512:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:2001 Canadian Census, which includes information for a relatively large sample of Ontario 
26:661:54663:27:28:71:502:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:residents on education, earnings, and religious affiliation.38  Since parental education is a 
26:662:54757:28:28:72:514:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:powerful predictor of test scores (see e.g., Jencks and Phillips, 1998), any differences in the 
26:663:54853:28:27:72:519:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:education of Catholic versus non-Catholic parents would indicate a problem for our research 
26:664:54945:27:28:72:525:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:design.  Likewise, since wages are strongly affected by cognitive skills (Murnane, Willet, and 
26:665:55040:28:27:72:538:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Levy, 1995), comparisons of earnings potentially reveal differences in cognitive skills of parents 
26:666:55139:27:28:72:511:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:that may be correlated with those of their children.   Our second data source is the National 
26:667:55233:28:28:72:534:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS), which interviewed children in 8th grade in 1988 
26:668:55326:28:27:72:540:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:and followed them for the next two decades.  Although NELS is U.S.-based, it has the advantage 
26:669:55421:27:28:72:523:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:of including test score information at different ages, as well as detailed information on family 
26:670:55518:28:27:72:195:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:background and religion. 
26:671:55543:27:28:108:536:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A: Table 5 presents comparisons of education and wages by religious affiliation for Ontario

26:675:55915:28:27:72:529:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:The set of controls is relatively parsimonious, reflecting the controls that we include in our test 
26:676:56015:27:28:72:528:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:score models (see below).  The odd-numbered columns of Table 5 present models that include 
26:677:56106:28:27:72:541:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:only a dummy for Catholic religion.  In these models Catholics are compared to all other parents, 
26:678:56204:27:28:72:526:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:including Protestants (about 35% of parents), those with no religious affiliation (about 15% of 
26:679:56300:28:20:72:538:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:parents), and those with religious affiliations other than Protestant or Catholic (18% of parents).

26:682:56559:16:11:72:535:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:“parents” individuals between the ages of 24 and 62 who are either the head or spouse of the head of the household 
26:683:56674:11:0:72:309:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:for a household with at least one child under the age of 16. 
27:684:56738:0:27:71:521:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:The specifications in the even-numbered columns include dummies for people affiliated with 
27:685:56829:27:28:71:535:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:other religions and those with no affiliation.  In these models Catholics are directly compared to 
27:686:56928:28:27:71:504:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Protestants.  Looking across the columns, the estimates show that Catholic parents have a 
27:687:57018:27:28:71:534:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:(modest) education and wage advantage relative to other parents as a whole, but are statistically 
27:688:57116:28:28:71:275:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:indistinguishable from Protestant parents. 
27:689:57159:28:27:107:540:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A: A very similar pattern holds with respect to test score outcomes of children in the NELS.  
27:690:57250:27:28:71:523:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Table 6 presents models for 8th grade test score outcomes of NELS students, and for their test 
27:691:57345:28:27:72:524:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:score gains between 8th and 10th grade.39   We present results for all students (in columns 1-4) 
27:692:57442:27:28:72:513:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:and for the subset who were attending public schools in 8th grade (columns 5-8).  The latter 
27:693:57535:28:28:72:511:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:group is particularly interesting because few of them attend Catholic high schools (Altonji, 
27:694:57628:28:27:72:541:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Elder, and Taber, 2005a, 2005b).  Thus, differences in test score gains between 8th and 10th grade 
27:695:57727:27:28:71:531:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:arguably measure the direct impact of a Catholic family background, rather than a combination 
27:696:57821:28:27:71:368:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:of family background effects and Catholic schooling effects.  
27:697:57883:27:28:107:536:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A: As shown by the estimates in columns 1 and 5, when Catholics are compared to all other 
27:698:57970:28:27:71:537:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:children, they have significantly higher 8th grade test scores.  Likewise, the models in columns 3 
27:699:58069:27:28:71:521:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:and 7 show faster test score gains between 8th and 10th grade.  When the comparison group is 
27:700:58162:28:28:71:527:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:narrowed to Protestants, however, the differences are much smaller and uniformly statistically 
27:701:58257:28:27:71:534:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:insignificant.  Thus, it appears that Catholic and Protestant children in the NELS have about the 
27:702:58355:27:28:71:540:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:same test score levels and gains, whereas both groups do better than children with other religions 
27:703:58454:28:29:71:390:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:or no religious affiliation, or who fail to report their affiliation.40

27:705:58576:37:11:72:517:147:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:39 NELS also has test scores in 12th grade, but a much larger fraction of students (25%) have missing test data.  
27:706:58690:11:16:72:541:136:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:40 We have fit a wide variety of alternative models to the NELS data, including models that are fit by weighted OLS, 
27:707:58807:16:12:72:523:120:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:using cross-sectional or panel weights, and models for 10th grade scores that include 8th grade scores on the right 
27:708:58923:12:11:71:524:108:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:hand side.  These models yield very similar results to the specifications reported in Table 6.  Models for parental 
27:709:59039:11:12:71:530:97:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:education in the NELS sample yield results that are quite similar to those in Table 5, though Catholic fathers have 
27:710:59155:12:11:71:541:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:somewhat higher education than Protestant fathers.  One important difference between Protestants in Canada and the 
27:711:59270:11:0:71:515:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:U.S. is the higher fraction of “non-mainstream” Protestants in the U.S. When we fit models including separate 
28:712:59383:0:27:107:542:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A: Overall, we interpret the test score results from NELS as confirming the conclusions from 
28:713:59473:27:28:71:533:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Table 5.  In particular, Catholic children in Ontario and in the US appear to have similar family 
28:714:59571:28:27:71:538:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:background characteristics and similar test scores to Protestants.  Both groups have better family 
28:715:59670:27:28:71:499:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:characteristics and better test scores than children affiliated to other religions, or with no

28:734:61317:12:7:72:367:131:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:their parents have lower education than those of mainstream Protestants.  
28:735:61391:7:16:72:541:124:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:41 See Lehrer (2005) for a review of evidence from the U.S. which generally concludes that religious affiliation has a 
28:736:61510:16:7:72:229:108:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:positive effect on schooling outcomes. 
28:737:61549:7:16:72:533:101:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:42 As Canada is historically comprised of immigrants from the United Kingdom and France, we exclude ethnicities 
28:738:61661:16:11:72:517:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:affiliated with these countries from our European ethnic measures.  In addition, we include Southern European 
28:739:61771:11:0:72:419:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:D:countries previously aligned with Russia under the Eastern European ethnic grouping. 
29:740:61859:0:27:107:528:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A: Columns 1, 5 and 9 present a basic model that uses the local fraction of Catholics as an 
29:741:61948:27:28:71:517:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:indicator of competitive pressure.  The estimated coefficients are statistically significant and 
29:742:62045:28:27:71:525:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:suggest that 6th grade scores in reading and writing are about 0.06 points higher, and scores in 
29:743:62142:27:28:72:511:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:math are about 0.12 points higher, in a 60% Catholic neighborhood than in a 20% Catholic 
29:744:62231:28:28:72:537:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:neighborhood, holding all else constant.  Since the standard deviations of 6th grade scores across 
29:745:62330:28:27:72:532:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:students are approximately 0.75, these represent effect sizes of 7-16% of a standard deviation.   
29:746:62428:27:28:108:529:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A: The models in columns 2, 6, and 10 include both the local fraction of Catholics and the 
29:747:62516:28:27:72:534:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:fraction of Catholics interacted with the share of new housing in the neighborhood as indicators 
29:748:62613:27:28:71:506:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:of competitive pressure.  Consistent with the pattern in our enrollment growth models, the 
29:749:62704:28:28:71:523:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:estimates for the interaction term suggest that competitive pressure is much stronger in newer 
29:750:62799:28:27:71:538:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:neighborhoods.  The specifications in columns 3, 7, and 11 exclude the Catholic share variable – 
29:751:62896:27:28:71:516:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:a restriction that is not rejected at conventional significance levels for the reading or writing 
29:752:62994:28:27:71:528:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:models but is rejected in the mathematics model.  Again, all three estimates of the competition 
29:753:63090:27:28:71:520:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:effect are highly statistically significant.  To interpret the magnitude of the estimated effects, 
29:754:63189:28:27:71:531:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:consider the 0.39 coefficient estimate from the reading score model.  Comparing an area with a 
29:755:63284:27:28:71:531:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:60% Catholic share and a 20% new housing share (close to the sample average) to an area with 
29:756:63377:28:28:71:539:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:the same new housing share but only 20% Catholics, reading scores in 6th grade are increased by 
29:757:63473:28:27:72:521:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:0.03 points, or an effect size of 4% of a standard deviation.  The implied effect in a relatively 
29:758:63571:27:28:72:543:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:new neighborhood (35% new housing share) is 7% of a standard deviation.  The predicted effects 
29:759:63666:28:27:72:453:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:for writing scores are similar while the effects for mathematics are 75% larger. 
29:760:63747:27:28:108:516:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A: Our investigation of differences between Catholics and non-Catholics suggested that 
29:761:63831:28:28:72:518:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Catholic parents and children are very similar to Protestants, but both groups are advantaged 
29:762:63925:28:0:71:534:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:relative to families with other religious affiliations, or no affiliation.  In view of this finding, we 
30:763:64032:0:27:71:539:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:added two additional controls to the models in columns 4, 8, and 12: the fraction of people in the 
30:764:64131:27:28:71:518:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:FSA who express no religious affiliation, and the fraction affiliated with religions other than 
30:765:64227:28:27:71:534:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Protestant or Catholic (i.e., Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, etc.).  In these models, the effect of local 
30:766:64328:27:28:71:534:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:competition is identified by variation in the fraction of Catholics relative to Protestants, holding 
30:767:64429:28:28:72:533:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:constant the fractions with other religion and no religion.  Provided that Catholic and Protestant 
30:768:64528:28:27:72:532:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:children have similar unobserved determinants of test score growth (as appears to be true in the 
30:769:64625:27:28:72:538:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:NELS), estimates from these models will provide consistent estimates of any competition effect. 
30:770:64721:28:27:108:536:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A: The addition of these two controls attenuates the coefficient of our competition indicator 
30:771:64812:27:28:71:525:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:slightly in the models in reading and writing, and somewhat more for mathematics, though all 
30:772:64905:28:28:71:511:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:three coefficients remain significant at conventional levels.  Consistent with the models for 
30:773:64999:28:27:71:510:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:NELS test outcomes, a higher local fraction of people who report no religious affiliation is 
30:774:65092:27:28:71:531:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:associated with slower test score gains, particularly in mathematics.  By comparison the effects 
30:775:65189:28:27:71:525:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:of the share of families with religious affiliations other than Protestant or Catholic are slightly 
30:776:65289:27:28:71:542:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:positive, but not statistically significant.  Interpreting the magnitudes of the competition effects, a 
30:777:65393:28:27:71:504:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:rise of 40 percentage points in the fraction of children with choice between the systems is 
30:778:65485:27:28:71:496:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:associated with 6th grade test outcomes that are 4-5% of a standard deviation higher in a 
30:779:65575:28:28:72:324:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:neighborhood with an average share of new houses. 
30:780:65625:28:27:108:532:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A: In keeping with the simple symmetric model outlined in Section II, the specifications in 
30:781:65714:27:28:72:513:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Table 7 all assume that local competitive pressure has the same effect on test score gains of 
30:782:65808:28:27:72:520:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:students at public and separate schools.   In a more general model in which the incentives for 
30:783:65903:27:28:72:531:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:gaining market share are different in the two systems, however, the effects of local competitive 
30:784:66000:28:28:72:513:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:pressure could be different.  To test this possibility, we re-estimated the specifications from 
30:785:66096:28:0:72:534:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:columns 4, 8 and 12 of Table 7, allowing the impacts of local competitive to vary for test takers 
31:786:66197:0:27:71:535:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:at public and separate schools.   In the model for reading scores the coefficient of local Catholic 
31:787:66297:27:28:71:530:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:share×new housing share is 0.49 (standard error =0.18) for students at public schools, and 0.35 
31:788:66393:28:27:71:531:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:(standard error=0.15) for students at separate schools.  In the model for mathematics scores the 
31:789:66490:27:28:71:540:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:corresponding coefficients are 0.73 (standard error =0.27) for students at public schools and 0.50 
31:790:66589:28:28:71:497:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:(standard error=0.21) for students at separate schools, while in the model for writing the 
31:791:66680:28:27:71:500:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:coefficients are 0.33 (standard error =0.14) for public school students and 0.26 (standard 
31:792:66771:27:28:71:519:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:error=0.12) for separate school students.  In all three cases the implied effects of competitive 
31:793:66868:28:27:71:496:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:pressure are slightly larger at public schools, but in no case is the difference statistically 
31:794:66963:27:28:71:131:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:significant.

31:796:66977:56:27:71:153:432:144:Times:144:Times:C:e. Interpretation 
31:797:66995:27:28:107:523:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A: Most families in Ontario live within a short distance of competing public and separate 
31:798:67082:28:27:71:528:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:elementary schools.  Figure 1, for example, shows the locations of schools included in our test-
31:799:67178:27:28:71:532:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:taker data base from the area west of Toronto.  The density of the competing networks suggests 
31:800:67273:28:27:71:528:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:there is at least a potential for cross-system competition for children of Catholic backgrounds.  
31:801:67371:27:28:71:516:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:We interpret the results in Table 7 as suggesting that this competition leads to improved test 
31:802:67466:28:28:71:524:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:outcomes for students in both types of schools.  The pattern of competition effects – higher in 
31:803:67562:28:27:71:541:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:faster growing areas, and proportional to the local fraction of Catholics – is consistent with direct 
31:804:67664:27:28:71:523:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:evidence on the enrollment impacts of nearby school openings, suggesting that the effects are 
31:805:67758:28:27:71:492:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:driven by the incentives identified in our theoretical model.  Importantly, the estimated 
31:806:67848:27:28:71:492:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:competitive effects are robust to controlling for the fraction of people with no religious 
31:807:67939:28:28:71:536:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:affiliation, or affiliations other than Protestant or Catholic.  Nevertheless, the implied effects are 
31:808:68042:28:0:71:529:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:relatively modest: a shift between areas where 20% of students can choose between systems to 
32:809:68138:0:27:71:527:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:one where 60% can choose is associated with a gain in 6th grade test scores of about 4-5% of a 
32:810:68233:27:28:72:166:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:standard deviation. 
32:811:68253:28:27:108:535:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A: A limitation of our analysis is that we have no direct evidence on the actual mechanisms 
32:812:68342:27:28:72:515:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:through which competition affects test scores.  We note, however, that school-level average 
32:813:68434:28:28:72:531:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:scores are widely reported in the media, and available from real estate agents and other sources 
32:814:68531:28:27:72:499:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:(e.g., http://www.theschoolguy.com).  There is also anecdotal evidence that teachers and 
32:815:68620:27:28:72:541:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:principals are under pressure to raise scores.  One possible mechanism for improved efficiency is 
32:816:68718:28:27:72:517:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:through the allocation of principals and vice principals.  To examine this link we tracked the 
32:817:68813:27:28:72:520:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:identifiers for principals at each elementary school and tested whether principals tend to turn 
32:818:68909:28:28:72:511:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:over more at schools affected by a nearby opening by the competing system in areas with a 
32:819:68999:28:27:72:525:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:higher fraction of Catholic residents.  The results did not show any systematic pattern, though 
32:820:69095:27:28:72:415:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:clearly principal turnover is a very crude indicator of managerial input. 
32:821:69169:28:27:108:531:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A: It is also worth noting two other limitations of our analysis.  First, we can only measure 
32:822:69260:27:28:72:523:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:test score gains over 3 years, or one-quarter of the time that most students spend in school.  If 
32:823:69358:28:27:72:529:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:similar effects were present at all stages of elementary and secondary schooling the benefits of 
32:824:69455:27:28:72:528:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:competition would be commensurately greater.  Second, it is possible that in more competitive 
32:825:69549:28:28:72:535:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:markets teachers and principals spend more time and effort preparing for standardized tests, and 
32:826:69646:28:27:72:502:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:less on other aspects of learning.  If “test skills” have limited intellectual value, the effort 
32:827:69743:27:28:72:518:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:devoted to competing over test outcomes is socially wasteful, and the higher test score gains 
32:828:69837:28:28:72:400:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:Times:B:observed in more competitive markets may be counter-productive.

33:832:70023:28:27:71:531:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:publicly-funded education?  In this paper we try to answer this question by studying the effects 
33:833:70120:27:28:71:523:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:of school competition in Ontario, Canada, which for over a century has operated two publicly 
33:834:70213:28:28:71:540:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:funded school systems: “public schools” that are open to all students, and “separate schools” that 
33:835:70312:28:27:71:521:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:are limited to children with Catholic backgrounds.  The fraction of families who can exercise 
33:836:70406:27:28:71:512:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:choice between the competing systems varies widely across different areas of the province, 
33:837:70497:28:27:71:288:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:providing the basis for our research design.   
33:838:70544:27:28:107:533:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:We develop a simple model of school choice and effort competition between public and 
33:839:70629:28:28:71:501:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:separate schools.  In the model, the share of Catholic children enrolling in public schools 
33:840:70721:28:27:71:531:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:depends on the relative quality of local public and separate schools, on their relative proximity, 
33:841:70820:27:28:71:523:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:and on underlying tastes for a religious or secular school environment.  Assuming that school 
33:842:70914:28:27:71:542:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:managers are rewarded for larger market shares, equilibrium effort in both systems will be higher 
33:843:71012:27:28:71:524:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:in markets with a larger share of Catholics who are willing to switch systems to access higher 
33:844:71107:28:27:71:533:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:school quality.  The model also implies that we can infer the relative responsiveness of families 
33:845:71205:27:28:71:494:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:to school quality by measuring the fraction who “switch brands” (Bucklin, Russell, and 
33:846:71292:28:28:71:412:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Srinivasan, 1998) when a nearby school is opened by the rival system. 
33:847:71362:28:27:107:525:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:We use a comprehensive panel of elementary schools to measure the characteristics of 
33:848:71447:27:28:71:530:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:schools and areas that lead to greater sensitivity of enrollment to changes in the nearby schools 
33:849:71545:28:27:71:522:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:operated by the competing school system.  We find that enrollment losses following a nearby 
33:850:71637:27:28:71:537:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:school opening by the competing system are proportional to the share of Catholic families in the 
33:851:71734:28:28:71:514:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:area, and are higher in rapidly-growing areas, where families are arguably less attached to a 
33:852:71828:28:0:71:157:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:particular school. 
34:853:71850:0:27:107:535:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:We then analyze data for five cohorts of students who wrote province-wide standardized 
34:854:71937:27:28:71:525:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:tests in reading, mathematics, and writing in grades 3 and 6.  We model test outcomes using a 
34:855:72031:28:27:71:542:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:value-added framework that relates the gains in scores for a cohort of student in a given school to 
34:856:72131:27:28:71:511:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:characteristics of the students, the school, and the local area.  In particular, we focus on the 
34:857:72228:28:28:71:538:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:impact of cross-system competitive pressure, measured by the local fraction of Catholics and the 
34:858:72325:28:27:71:439:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:interaction of this with a measure of the growth rate of housing in the area.   
34:859:72405:27:28:107:512:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:A key concern is that changes in the local fraction of Catholic families may have an 
34:860:72490:28:27:71:531:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:independent effect on students’ academic achievement.  Since our test data lack information on 
34:861:72585:27:28:71:507:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:religious affiliation, we use two other data sets – the 2001 Census, which contains data on 
34:862:72677:28:28:71:512:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:educational attainment and earnings for a large sample of Ontario parents, and the National 
34:863:72769:28:27:71:525:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Education Longitudinal Study (NELS), which reports test score levels and changes for a large 
34:864:72862:27:28:71:519:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:sample of children in the U.S.  We find that Catholic parents and children are very similar to 
34:865:72957:28:27:71:531:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:Protestants, but both groups are advantaged relative to families with other religious affiliations, 
34:866:73057:27:28:71:541:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:or no affiliation.  Thus, in our preferred specifications we control for the local fractions of people 
34:867:73160:28:27:71:502:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:with no religious affiliation, or affiliations to religions other than Protestant or Catholic.   
34:868:73257:27:28:107:503:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Our models show statistically significant but relatively modest effect of enhanced 
34:869:73340:28:28:71:536:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:competition on the test score gains of local students.  Comparing markets where only 20 percent 
34:870:73436:28:27:71:529:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:of children have choice to markets where 60 percent can choose between systems, we estimate 
34:871:73528:27:28:71:515:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:that test scores in 6th grade are 0.04-0.05 of a standard deviation higher, relative to 3rd grade 
34:872:73626:28:27:72:518:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:scores.  The implied impacts are higher in rapidly growing areas and smaller in slow-growth 
34:873:73718:27:28:71:537:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:areas.  Consistent with a “market competition” effect, we find that test scores of students in both 
34:874:73818:28:28:71:499:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:the public and separate systems are higher in areas with more competitive pressure, with 
34:875:73907:28:0:71:325:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:somewhat larger impacts on public school students.  
35:876:73962:0:27:107:534:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:A:Our findings have at least three implications for education policy.  First, we have shown 
35:877:74052:27:28:71:520:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:that a significant fraction of families are willing to move between publicly-funded schools to 
35:878:74147:28:27:71:524:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:access a combination of higher quality or more convenient schools.  This willingness to move 
35:879:74240:27:28:71:529:626:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:provides the basis for cross-system competition that can lead, at least in principle, to improved 
35:880:74338:28:28:71:535:598:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:efficiency of publicly-funded schools.  Our estimates suggest competition has a modest positive 
35:881:74434:28:27:71:533:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:effect on student achievement:  extending choice to all students would lead to gains in 6th grade 
35:882:74532:27:28:71:488:543:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:test scores of 6-8% of a standard deviation.  Finally, our results underscore the critical 
35:883:74623:28:27:71:535:515:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:importance of further research on the links between parental choice decisions and the incentives 
35:884:74720:27:0:71:253:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:B:faced by competing school systems.

44:1156:92028:28:27:71:538:239:144:g_d0_f1:64:g_d0_f1:!:no test score and whether these test takers were identified as receiving special education status.46 
44:1157:92128:27:28:108:541:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:We compared the number of potential test takers by grade with the fall enrollment figures 
44:1158:92218:28:27:71:526:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:we had for the schools. Given the enrollment figures were obtained in the fall and the test was 
44:1159:92314:27:28:72:542:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:administered in the spring, we expected there to be some slippage in the enrollment and test taker 
44:1160:92413:28:20:72:528:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:counts. In instances where there was a substantial discrepancy in these counts, we investigated

45:1170:93353:28:27:71:342:570:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:excluded schools with a high number of non-test takers.

45:1173:93553:27:28:71:532:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:of the postal code to identify the “Forward Sortation Area” (FSA) of the school. Using the FSA 
45:1174:93648:28:28:71:529:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:we then matched census data from 1991, 1996, and 2001 to schools. If the current FSA did not 
45:1175:93741:28:27:71:530:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:exist for earlier years, we identified the FSA that most likely was covered historically and used 
45:1176:93839:27:28:71:534:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:census measures across all three periods that corresponded to the area covered by the school for 
45:1177:93936:28:27:71:542:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:all three census years. In some instances the FSA census data were suppressed and/or it was clear 
45:1178:94034:27:28:71:516:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:that the area covered by the FSA did not represent the area that was likely to be the school’s

48:1249:100666:27:28:71:544:488:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:separate  schools  depicted,  average  enrollment  in  grades  1  to  6  ranged  between  163  and  296  
48:1250:100771:28:28:71:235:460:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:students over the sample period.   
48:1251:100806:28:27:107:545:432:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:There  are  two  issues  that  caused  us  to  restrict  the  sample  of  schools  treated  as  being  
48:1252:100909:27:28:71:543:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:within a close distance of the opened school.  First, there is a major freeway (Highway 401) that 
48:1253:101007:28:27:71:543:377:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:is  located  south  of  Elkhorn.    This  resulted  the  in  the  exclusion  of  Dunlace  and  Harrison  Public  
48:1254:101120:27:28:71:544:350:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:Schools.    Second,  there  is  a  ravine.    This  excluded  two  of  the  three  separate  schools  (Blessed  
48:1255:101232:28:27:71:544:322:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:Trinity  and  St.  Mathias)  and  one  of  the  public  schools  (Lescon).    The  remaining  schools  are  
48:1256:101340:27:28:71:544:295:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:located  within  2  kilometers  of  Elkhorn.    Given  students  could  reside  in  areas  between  Elkhorn  
48:1257:101449:28:28:71:545:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:and  these  schools,  it  seems  reasonable  to  include  these  schools  as  ones  that  are  potentially  
48:1258:101557:28:27:71:196:239:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:affected by the opening.   
48:1259:101584:27:28:107:543:212:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:This leaves, however, only one potentially competing separate school.  Blessed Trinity is 
48:1260:101674:28:27:71:543:184:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:just beyond the ravine and is close to Finch Public School, a school that is treated as within the 
48:1261:101773:27:28:71:545:157:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:circle  of  the  opening.    Figure  2  provides  a  more  detailed  image  of  the  area  around  Blessed  
48:1262:101881:28:28:71:546:129:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:Trinity.  Figure 2 shows that Blessed Trinity and Finch schools are separated by two major roads.  
48:1263:101980:28:0:71:543:101:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:Moreover, there are few houses that lie in between these schools.  It appears that Blessed Trinity 
49:1264:102082:0:27:71:543:708:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:draws its students from the houses that are located north east of the school, an area that is farther 
49:1265:102184:27:28:71:545:681:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:away  from  Elkhorn.    Therefore,  we  decided  that  this  school  should  not  be  treated  as  being  
49:1266:102290:28:27:71:244:653:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:!:potentially affected by the opening.
