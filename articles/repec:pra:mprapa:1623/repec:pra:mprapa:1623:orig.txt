10:138:9803:40:15:90:504:520:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The Government has begun a major programme of pension reform. These reforms
10:139:9878:15:22:90:472:505:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:are based on an extensive, sound evidence base, contained, for example, in:
10:140:9953:22:22:90:332:483:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:•  The First Report of the Pensions Commission;
10:141:10000:22:23:90:349:461:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:•  The Second Report of the Pensions Commission;
10:142:10048:23:15:90:504:438:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:•Security in Retirement: towards a new pensions system and its accompanying
10:143:10123:15:22:102:261:423:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Regulatory Impact Assessment;
10:144:10152:22:25:90:454:401:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:•  The Pensions Bill and the accompanying documents published today.
10:145:10220:25:15:90:504:376:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Because of the scale and importance of these reforms, the Government is keen to
10:146:10299:15:15:90:504:361:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:continue to develop this evidence base. To contribute to this aim, the Government
10:147:10380:15:15:90:504:346:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:has undertaken, and continues to undertake, a range of innovative, exploratory
10:148:10458:15:15:90:504:331:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:analysis. This paper contains an exploration of method and early results from work
10:149:10540:15:15:90:504:316:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:which examines the macro-economic and social welfare impacts of elements of
10:150:10615:15:25:90:128:301:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:reform.
10:151:10622:25:15:90:504:276:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The analysis presented here is meant not as the conclusion of the work, but as an
10:152:10703:15:15:90:504:261:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:exposition of preliminary thinking. The Government would welcome the views of
10:153:10780:15:15:90:504:246:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:academics  and  other  experts  on  the  techniques  used  and  preliminary  findings

12:156:10990:0:40:90:218:561:1024:g_d0_f7:1024:g_d0_f7:Summary
12:157:10997:40:15:90:504:521:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:This paper examines the impact of two effects of the pension reform package that
12:158:11077:15:15:90:504:506:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f9:was put forward in the May White Paper Security in retirement: towards a new
12:159:11153:15:15:90:504:491:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f7:pensions system: the likely increase in the number of older people working due to a
12:160:11236:15:15:90:504:476:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:higher State Pension age and the likely rise in saving due to more people putting
12:161:11317:15:25:90:230:461:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:away money for retirement.
12:162:11343:25:15:90:504:436:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:State Pension age is currently 65 for men and 60 for women. There has been a long-
12:163:11425:15:15:90:504:421:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:planned increase in women’s pension age to 65, due to take place between 2010
12:164:11502:15:15:90:504:406:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:and  2020,  which  is  not  examined  in  this  paper.  However,  the  Government  has
12:165:11588:15:15:90:504:391:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:announced that State Pension age for men and women will then rise from 65 to 66
12:166:11667:15:15:90:504:376:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:by 2026, to 67 by 2036 and to 68 by 2046. Not everyone retires at State Pension age,
12:167:11751:15:15:90:504:361:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:but it is likely that this increase will lead to more people working.  This will result in an
12:168:11844:15:15:90:504:346:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:increase in the size of the economy. There is considerable uncertainty about people’s
12:169:11929:15:15:90:504:331:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:exact response to the reforms, so we present results as ranges. The paper explores
12:170:12011:15:15:90:504:316:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:different techniques to estimate the size of this impact. It finds that by 2050 the
12:171:12094:15:15:90:504:301:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:economy could be 1.4 – 1.7 per cent larger than it would be if reform had not taken
12:172:12177:15:25:90:120:286:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:place.
12:173:12183:25:15:90:504:261:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The introduction of personal accounts is thought likely to increase pension saving,
12:174:12266:15:15:90:504:246:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:although, again, individual responses are difficult to predict with certainty. Analysis
12:175:12353:15:15:90:504:231:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:suggests that the increase in saving for retirement could lead to a long-term growth
12:176:12437:15:15:90:504:216:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:in UK incomes of around 0.2 per cent. This would occur as UK residents increased
12:177:12517:15:15:90:504:201:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:their ownership of domestic and foreign companies and other assets that they invest
12:178:12600:15:15:90:504:186:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:in  through  their  pension  funds.  The  ownership  of  these  assets  would  generate
12:179:12687:15:25:90:443:171:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:returns which would ultimately allow people in the UK to spend more.
12:180:12755:25:15:90:504:146:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The overall effect of changes to State Pension age and the introduction of personal
12:181:12838:15:15:90:504:131:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:accounts on UK incomes is likely to be in the range of 0.9 – 3.1 per cent. Although
12:182:12921:15:15:90:504:116:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:these numbers are relatively small proportions of the total economy, they represent
12:183:13004:15:15:90:504:101:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:significant sums. In terms of today’s economy, they would be worth around £11 –
12:184:13083:15:0:90:140:86:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:38 billion.
13:185:13094:0:106:19:26:821:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:4
13:186:13095:106:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:In addition to the economic impact of reform, the paper also explores its impact on
13:187:13178:15:25:90:410:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:people’s wellbeing through improved consumption smoothing.
13:188:13236:25:15:90:504:675:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The Government provides a safety net to avoid pensioner poverty, and most people
13:189:13316:15:15:90:504:660:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:will achieve a basic level of pension through the State Pension system. However, it is
13:190:13402:15:15:90:504:645:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:in most people’s interest to save on top of this for their retirement to avoid a big fall
13:191:13491:15:15:90:504:630:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:in their income when they stop working. This is because many people prefer to
13:192:13568:15:15:90:504:615:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:maintain a reasonably smooth pattern of consumption throughout life, than to have
13:193:13649:15:15:90:504:600:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:a relatively high level of consumption while they are working and then a much lower
13:194:13732:15:25:90:197:585:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:level once they retire.
13:195:13755:25:15:90:504:560:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Whilst  many  people  would  recognise  the  desirability  of  saving  for  retirement,
13:196:13842:15:15:90:504:545:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:analysis, for example presented by the Pensions Commission, suggests many are not
13:197:13923:15:15:90:504:530:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:saving enough to smooth their consumption effectively. According to the latest
13:198:14001:15:15:90:504:515:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:estimates at least seven million people are currently not saving enough to avoid a
13:199:14083:15:15:90:504:500:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:significant fall in their standard of living at retirement. The introduction of personal
13:200:14171:15:15:90:504:485:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:accounts is expected to lead to a large increase in the number of people saving for
13:201:14254:15:15:90:504:470:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:their retirement, leading them to be able to maintain a more consistent standard of
13:202:14337:15:15:90:504:455:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:living over their lives. This will improve the wellbeing of these individuals and, as
13:203:14422:15:15:90:504:440:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:social welfare is the total of the wellbeing of individuals, it will increase welfare
13:204:14507:15:25:90:162:425:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:across society.
13:205:14522:25:15:90:504:400:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:This paper uses innovative economic analysis to examine the scale of this increase in
13:206:14607:15:15:90:504:385:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:people’s  wellbeing.  It  finds  that  if  people  save  for  retirement  through  personal
13:207:14698:15:15:90:504:370:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:accounts, then generally their wellbeing will be enhanced. As more people delay
13:208:14777:15:15:90:504:355:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:spending their income from when they are in work to when they are in retirement,
13:209:14857:15:0:90:496:340:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:we will feel better off as a society because of the increase in individual wellbeing.

14:213:15074:15:15:90:504:467:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f7:system1,  published  in  May  2006,  contained  a  pension  reform  package  that  is
14:214:15159:15:15:90:504:452:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:designed to provide a long-lasting framework. It also announced the intention to
14:215:15239:15:15:90:504:437:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:produce  this  technical  paper,  to  assess  in  more  detail  the  economic  and  social
14:216:15329:15:15:90:504:422:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:welfare  impacts  of  two  particular  aspects  of  the  reforms,  the  introduction  of
14:217:15417:15:15:90:504:407:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:personal accounts and measures to extend working life. This paper explores possible
14:218:15500:15:15:90:504:392:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:methodological approaches to how the economic and social welfare effects could
14:219:15578:15:15:90:504:377:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:be measured and using these methodologies provides quantitative estimates. This
14:220:15657:15:15:90:504:362:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:paper is not a definitive statement on the magnitude of outcomes from pension
14:221:15734:15:15:90:504:347:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:reform, about which there is substantial uncertainty, but suggests the direction and
14:222:15818:15:25:90:231:332:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:possible scale of the effects.
14:223:15848:25:15:90:504:307:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:A number of challenges to the current pension system were identified in the White
14:224:15929:15:15:90:504:292:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Paper. It concluded that pension reform is needed to address demographic and
14:225:16005:15:15:90:504:277:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:social change, the large number of people who are undersaving for retirement and
14:226:16085:15:15:90:504:262:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the complexity of and the inequalities inherent in the State Pension system. To cope
14:227:16169:15:15:90:504:247:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:with these challenges, as well as improve outcomes for individuals and society as a
14:228:16252:15:22:90:425:232:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:whole, the White Paper announced the following policy measures:
14:229:16315:22:15:90:504:210:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:•  The uprating of the basic State Pension with earnings rather than prices and the
14:230:16398:15:22:102:406:195:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:reform of the State Second Pension into a flat rate pension;
14:231:16458:22:15:90:504:173:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:•  The improvement of coverage by the basic State Pension by reducing the number
14:232:16538:15:15:102:505:158:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:of years of contributions necessary to qualify and the introduction of new credits

15:246:17322:37:21:90:483:585:256:g_d0_f7:256:g_d0_f7:1.2Increasing State Pension age and extending working
15:247:17375:21:25:133:153:564:256:g_d0_f7:256:g_d0_f7:life
15:248:17379:25:15:90:504:539:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Life expectancy has improved considerably since State retirement pensions were first
15:249:17463:15:15:90:504:524:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:introduced, and is projected to continue to do so into the future. Despite this trend,
15:250:17549:15:15:90:504:509:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the average age of exit from the labour market fell from the 1950s to the mid-1990s.
15:251:17633:15:15:90:504:494:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Although this trend has shown signs of reversal in recent years, the average age of
15:252:17716:15:15:90:504:479:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:retirement remains below historical levels. For example, in 1950 men retired at 67 on
15:253:17801:15:15:90:504:464:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:average and women at 64. By contrast, comparable figures for the present day show
15:254:17882:15:15:90:504:449:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:an  average  retirement  age  of  64  and  62  respectively  (see  Figure  1.1),  while  life
15:255:17975:15:33:90:436:434:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:expectancy at 65 in 2006 was almost nine years longer than in 1950.

16:257:18095:0:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Continuing increases in life expectancy mean that were State Pension age to remain
16:258:18177:15:15:90:504:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:fixed  at  its  present  level,  the  current  State  Pension  system  would  be  paying  for
16:259:18270:15:15:90:504:685:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:progressively  longer  retirements.  Increasing  State  Pension  age  in  response  to
16:260:18356:15:15:90:504:670:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:increasing longevity, as announced in the White Paper, is intended to ensure that
16:261:18437:15:15:90:504:655:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the state retirement pension system can provide a sound foundation for working
16:262:18515:15:25:90:308:640:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:and saving decisions on a sustainable basis.
16:263:18559:25:15:90:504:615:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The increase in State Pension age will, however, need to be accompanied by cultural
16:264:18642:15:15:90:504:600:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:and behavioural changes around retirement to produce an increase in the average
16:265:18721:15:15:90:504:585:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:retirement age. Working longer is the logical response to an ageing population. On
16:266:18803:15:15:90:504:570:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:an individual basis working longer enables individuals to build up greater savings for
16:267:18889:15:15:90:504:555:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:retirement and can stabilise the length of time spent in retirement. Additionally, the
16:268:18975:15:15:90:504:540:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:more people who are in work and contributing to the growth of the economy, the
16:269:19053:15:25:90:498:525:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:more funds there will be available to support those people who are in retirement.
16:270:19134:25:15:90:504:500:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:State Pension age may influence the retirement decision through two channels. The
16:271:19215:15:15:90:504:485:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:first is that the State Pension age is set at a specific age defined by the Government
16:272:19301:15:15:90:504:470:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:and, therefore, creates a culture of expectation of retiring at that age. The second is
16:273:19388:15:15:90:504:455:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:that  upon  reaching  State  Pension  age,  individuals  have  access  to  an  additional
16:274:19477:15:25:90:467:440:144:g_d0_f7:49:g_d0_f7:source of income, thus giving people the financial means to stop working.2
16:275:19551:25:15:90:504:415:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:While State Pension age is important in influencing people’s retirement decision it is
16:276:19637:15:15:90:504:400:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:only one factor determining the timing of retirement. The most common retirement
16:277:19717:15:15:90:504:385:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:ages are 60 for women and 65 for men – the current State Pension ages – (see Figure
16:278:19800:15:15:90:504:370:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:1.2) suggesting the importance of State Pension age in signalling or as a cultural
16:279:19882:15:15:90:504:355:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:reference  point  in  determining  retirement  behaviour.  But  labour  market  activity
16:280:19970:15:15:90:504:340:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:rates show a decline from age 55 onwards demonstrating that other factors are also
16:281:20052:15:15:90:504:325:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:important.  Almost  half  of  all  men  exit  the  labour  market  before  reaching  State
16:282:20142:15:25:90:234:310:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Pension age (see Figure 1.3).
16:283:20171:25:15:90:504:285:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The  Government  has  already  put  in  place  or  planned  a  number  of  measures
16:284:20254:15:15:90:504:270:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:intended  to  change  the  culture  and  behaviour  surrounding  retirement.  These

19:346:24335:15:15:102:505:476:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:charges on personal accounts would be lower than on most currently available
19:347:24411:15:15:102:505:461:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:personal pensions: the current charge cap for annual management charges for
19:348:24486:15:15:102:505:446:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:stakeholder pensions is 1.5 per cent in the first ten years falling to one per cent
19:349:24569:15:15:102:505:431:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:per  year  after  that.  Occupational  pension  schemes  and  some  group  personal
19:350:24652:15:15:102:505:416:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:pension schemes are able to achieve administrative charges equivalent to around
19:351:24731:15:15:102:505:401:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:0.3 to 0.5 per cent or less. Therefore, people automatically enrolled into these
19:352:24811:15:26:102:325:386:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:schemes will also benefit from low charges.
19:353:24854:26:22:90:285:360:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The key features of the scheme will be:
19:354:24893:22:15:90:504:338:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:•  An organisational structure that ensures low charges and good-quality service
19:355:24973:15:22:102:177:323:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:for individuals;
19:356:24989:22:15:90:504:301:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:•  Automatic  enrolment  for  all  eligible  employees,  but  with  the  freedom  to  opt
19:357:25078:15:23:102:123:286:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:out;
19:358:25082:23:15:90:504:263:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:•  A  minimum  overall  level  of  contribution  from  employers,  employees  and  the
19:359:25168:15:15:102:505:248:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Government,  to  promote  a  minimum  level  of  pension  saving,  with  people
19:360:25247:15:15:102:505:233:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:encouraged to contribute more. The minimum overall contribution is eight per
19:361:25323:15:15:102:505:218:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:cent of earnings between around £5,000 and £33,000, the split of contributions
19:362:25401:15:21:102:167:203:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:is as follows:
19:363:25415:21:22:102:310:182:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:–  employers contributing three per cent;
19:364:25456:22:21:102:329:160:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:–  employees contributing four per cent; and
19:365:25500:21:14:102:505:139:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:–  the State contributing one per cent as normal tax relief, as under the current
19:366:25581:14:40:113:144:125:144:g_d0_f7:49:g_d0_f7:rules;5
19:367:25588:40:18:90:505:85:49:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:5One per cent represents basic rate tax relief on individuals’ contributions – in
19:368:25669:18:14:102:504:67:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:addition, individuals may be entitled to higher-rate tax relief and neither employers
19:369:25754:14:15:102:505:53:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:nor  employees  pay  tax  or  National  Insurance  contributions  on  employer
19:370:25832:15:0:102:173:38:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:contributions.
20:371:25860:0:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:•  A national minimum employer contribution, increasing incentives to save. For all
20:372:25943:15:15:102:505:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:employees, whether they access pension saving through personal accounts or
20:373:26017:15:15:102:505:685:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:existing  pension  provision,  if  they  remain  in  the  scheme  they  will  receive  a
20:374:26105:15:15:102:505:670:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:minimum employer contribution of three per cent of earnings between around
20:375:26179:15:22:102:212:655:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:£5,000 and £33,000;
20:376:26198:22:15:90:504:633:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:•  Opt-in access available to those not automatically enrolled, including the self-
20:377:26281:15:23:102:178:618:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:employed; and
20:378:26294:23:15:90:504:595:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:•  Portable and flexible accounts, to fit in with modern life and the greater likelihood
20:379:26382:15:38:102:268:580:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:of people moving between jobs.
20:380:26412:38:25:90:332:542:256:g_d0_f7:256:g_d0_f7:1.4Measuring impacts of policies
20:381:26444:25:15:90:504:517:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:This report will look at two different ways of measuring the impact of the increase in
20:382:26530:15:15:90:504:502:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:State  Pension  age  and  the  introduction  of  personal  accounts.  We  first  consider
20:383:26619:15:15:90:504:487:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:economic effects, in the context of which two complementary approaches are used.
20:384:26699:15:15:90:504:472:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The first is a partial approach that can quickly provide estimates of the economic
20:385:26781:15:15:90:504:457:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:effects based on assumptions around changes in employment rates. The second
20:386:26856:15:15:90:504:442:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:method is more comprehensive and uses NiGEM, a macroeconomic model of the UK
20:387:26932:15:15:90:504:427:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:economy  developed  by  the  National  Institute  of  Economic  and  Social  Research
20:388:27017:15:15:90:504:412:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:(NIESR),  to  analyse  these  effects.  Finally  we  develop  an  innovative  method  to
20:389:27105:15:37:90:470:397:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:estimate the social welfare impact of the introduction of personal accounts.
20:390:27181:37:26:90:255:360:256:g_d0_f7:256:g_d0_f7:1.5Economic impacts
20:391:27200:26:15:90:504:334:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:In measuring the economic impacts we are looking at how the reform impacts on
20:392:27277:15:15:90:504:319:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the  size  of  the  economy  or  national  income,  as  either  measured  by  the  gross
20:393:27365:15:15:90:504:304:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:domestic product (GDP), which is a measure of the total value of final goods and
20:394:27445:15:15:90:504:289:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:services produced within a country’s borders in a year, or gross national product
20:395:27526:15:15:90:504:274:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:(GNP) which is the value of all goods and services produced in a country in one year,
20:396:27611:15:25:90:504:259:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:plus income earned by its residents abroad, minus income payable to non-residents.
20:397:27693:25:15:90:504:234:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:If total economic resources are increased, this means that more income is potentially
20:398:27778:15:15:90:504:219:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:available  to  individuals  for  consumption.  Chapter  2  looks  at  a  simple  partial
20:399:27866:15:15:90:504:204:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:equilibrium model to estimate the impact of increasing State Pension age, while
20:400:27945:15:15:90:504:189:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Chapter 3 uses a dynamic general equilibrium model of the economy to measure the
20:401:28025:15:15:90:504:174:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:impacts of both State Pension age changes and increases in saving on the size of the
20:402:28109:15:37:90:140:159:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:economy.
20:403:28117:37:26:90:241:122:256:g_d0_f7:256:g_d0_f7:1.6Welfare impacts
20:404:28135:26:15:90:504:96:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The aim of many reforms of public policy is to make society as a whole feel better off
20:405:28221:15:15:90:504:81:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:or, in other words, to increase social welfare. To gain insight into the aggregate
20:406:28303:15:15:90:504:66:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:concept of social welfare, analysing individual welfare, or utility (an economists’
20:407:28386:15:0:90:493:51:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:term for describing an individual’s or a society’s wellbeing), is a useful approach.
21:408:28470:0:106:16:29:821:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:12
21:409:28484:106:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Research6 suggests that, while utility is not identical to the more comprehensible
21:410:28566:15:15:90:504:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:term  happiness,  the  two  concepts  are  closely  related.  Utility  is  by  no  means
21:411:28654:15:15:90:504:685:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:straightforward to measure. It is influenced by a vast number of factors, some of
21:412:28735:15:15:90:504:670:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:them intangible. Furthermore, each individual attaches different values to certain
21:413:28817:15:15:90:504:655:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:things. For example, one person may accumulate as many goods as possible to
21:414:28892:15:15:90:504:640:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:maximise their wellbeing, while another’s happiness may derive from the knowledge
21:415:28973:15:15:90:504:625:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:that she lives in an environment where her rights are protected by sound institutions
21:416:29058:15:25:90:344:610:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:and she receives good healthcare when necessary.
21:417:29106:25:15:90:504:585:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:For  analytical  purposes,  consumption  of  goods  and  services  including  leisure  is
21:418:29195:15:15:90:504:570:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:usually the main component of utility. This is an abstraction from reality but it is
21:419:29279:15:15:90:504:555:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:useful  in  a  model  context.  Furthermore,  research  has  found  that  income  and
21:420:29364:15:15:90:504:540:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:happiness  are  correlated,  making  income  an  imperfect  yet  useful  indicator  for
21:421:29451:15:25:90:286:525:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:happiness and overall levels of welfare.
21:422:29491:25:15:90:504:500:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Our model estimates social welfare by aggregating the welfare of all individuals in
21:423:29574:15:15:90:504:485:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:society. In doing so, we assume a utilitarian point of view, that is, we do not attach
21:424:29660:15:15:90:504:470:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:different weights to different individuals, for example, according to their income
21:425:29742:15:15:90:504:455:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:before  reforms.  Instead  we  simply  add  all  changes  in  wellbeing  to  arrive  at  our
21:426:29834:15:25:90:196:440:144:g_d0_f7:49:g_d0_f7:aggregate measure.7
21:427:29853:25:15:90:504:415:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:According to standard economic theory individuals are best off making independent
21:428:29934:15:15:90:504:400:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:consumption choices. In other words, individuals, in theory, buy the goods and
21:429:30012:15:15:90:504:385:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:services that for them have the biggest impact on wellbeing, as well as accurately
21:430:30094:15:15:90:504:370:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:forecasting how much income they will earn, how much they will want to consume
21:431:30172:15:15:90:504:355:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:in  the  future  and  save  accordingly.  They  would  thereby  maximise  individual
21:432:30256:15:15:90:504:340:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:wellbeing,  and  with  it  social  welfare,  leaving  no  reason  for  the  government  to
21:433:30346:15:25:90:141:325:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:intervene.
21:434:30356:25:15:90:504:300:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:In  practice,  however,  the  government  will,  at  a  minimum,  find  justification  for
21:435:30446:15:15:90:504:285:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:intervening in the market due to the existence of public goods, for which there is a
21:436:30530:15:15:90:504:270:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:demand but which cannot be efficiently supplied by the private sector, for example
21:437:30612:15:15:90:504:255:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:national defence. Even beyond the provision of public goods, however, it takes a
21:438:30692:15:15:90:504:240:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:very specific set of circumstances in which the market and hence the individuals in it
21:439:30778:15:15:90:504:225:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:will  produce  welfare  maximising  results.  In  reality,  welfare  will  not  always  be
21:440:30868:15:22:90:422:210:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:maximised in a general sense due to one of the following reasons:
21:441:30933:22:15:90:504:188:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:•  Imperfect information: consumers are unable to fully compare all available goods
21:442:31016:15:15:102:505:173:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:in terms of their prices and quality, which may prevent them from making the
21:443:31092:15:15:102:505:158:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:most efficient consumption decisions. They also cannot fully predict their income
21:444:31173:15:15:102:505:143:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:and  prices  of  goods  in  the  future,  which  is  especially  relevant  for  retirement
21:445:31263:15:37:102:150:128:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:pensions.
21:446:31272:37:20:90:221:91:49:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:6Frey and Stutzer, 2002.
21:447:31296:20:18:90:505:71:49:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:7As opposed to, e.g. the Rawlsian view which regards an increase in income of
21:448:31373:18:15:102:505:53:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:one  individual  as  insignificant  for  social  welfare  if  the  worst  off  individual  of
21:449:31466:15:0:102:384:38:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:society does not also experience an increase in income.
22:450:31535:0:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:•  The development of behavioural economics is extending our understanding of
22:451:31612:15:15:102:505:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the cause of imperfect outcomes. For example, it suggests that even if perfect
22:452:31690:15:15:102:505:685:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:information exists many people do not make the right decisions due to complexity
22:453:31770:15:22:102:267:670:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:or short-sightedness and inertia.
22:454:31803:22:15:90:504:648:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:•  Imperfect competition: for example monopoly or collusion that lead to inefficiently

22:463:32382:25:15:90:504:480:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Due to one or more of these issues the government may choose to intervene so as to
22:464:32464:15:15:90:504:465:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:create an environment within which society as a whole can achieve a higher level of
22:465:32547:15:15:90:504:450:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:welfare. In the final chapter of this paper on social welfare estimates of personal
22:466:32630:15:15:90:504:435:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:accounts  we  show  how  these  issues  apply  in  the  case  of  pension  saving  and,
22:467:32717:15:37:90:366:420:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:therefore, estimate the welfare gain from intervention.

22:469:32799:26:15:90:504:357:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:As we will discuss in Chapter 4, accurately estimating the welfare impacts of longer
22:470:32883:15:15:90:504:342:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:working  lives  would  require  developing  a  model  to  take  account  of  individual
22:471:32970:15:15:90:504:327:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:preferences amongst those affected by the change, something which would be an
22:472:33047:15:15:90:504:312:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:extremely challenging project and beyond the scope of this paper. Neither do we
22:473:33126:15:15:90:504:297:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:estimate the welfare impacts of the overall increases in the size of the economy as a
22:474:33211:15:25:90:463:282:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:result of the changes in State Pension age and increases in pension saving.
22:475:33286:25:15:90:504:257:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:This paper does not look at the impact of the reforms to State Pensions. The White
22:476:33368:15:15:90:504:242:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Paper contained significant analysis of the impact on individuals and distributional
22:477:33452:15:15:90:504:227:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:effects. It is outside of the scope of this paper to attempt to analyse the state reform
22:478:33540:15:15:90:504:212:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:changes using the methods applied here. To measure the impact of changes in the
22:479:33619:15:15:90:504:197:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:State Pension a model would have to estimate the welfare effects of receiving a
22:480:33698:15:15:90:504:182:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:higher income, which is less means-tested, for a slightly shorter period, instead of
22:481:33782:15:15:90:504:167:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the current state system. This would require a different model and the evaluation of
22:482:33866:15:0:90:314:152:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:different factors affecting individual welfare.

23:485:33962:25:15:90:504:686:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:This paper is divided into three further chapters which explore a methodological
23:486:34042:15:15:90:504:671:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:approach to estimating the impact of pension reform. Each chapter takes a different
23:487:34125:15:15:90:504:656:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:approach  to  look  at  the  impact  of  the  increase  in  State  Pension  age  and  the
23:488:34214:15:15:90:504:641:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:introduction of personal accounts and then quantifies the size of the impact using
23:489:34296:15:25:90:357:626:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:this methodology and a plausible set of assumptions.
23:490:34348:25:15:90:504:601:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Our estimates of the impact should not be taken as definitive: If different methods
23:491:34431:15:15:90:504:586:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:were adopted it would be possible for a different range of results to be produced.

24:500:34912:15:15:90:504:392:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f7:system includes proposals to raise State Pension age from 65 to 68 between 2024
24:501:34991:15:15:90:504:377:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:and 2046. This chapter looks at how this policy change, combined with measures to
24:502:35072:15:25:90:376:362:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:extend working life, may contribute to economic output.
24:503:35127:25:15:90:504:337:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The general introduction provided some background to the proposed changes in

24:505:35290:15:15:90:504:307:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:chapter, the impact on GDP of the changes to State Pension age combined with
24:506:35366:15:15:90:504:292:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:measures  to  extend  working  life  are  estimated  from  the  possible  employment
24:507:35450:15:37:90:210:277:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:impacts of the changes.
24:508:35473:37:26:90:276:240:256:g_d0_f7:256:g_d0_f7:2.2Analytical framework
24:509:35496:26:15:90:504:214:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The general introduction set out the role working longer has in society’s response to
24:510:35581:15:15:90:504:199:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the  challenge  of  an  ageing  population.  There  are  also  likely  to  be  benefits  to
24:511:35672:15:25:90:331:184:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:individuals and employers from working longer.
24:512:35718:25:15:90:504:159:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:For employers, with 40 per cent of the workforce expected to be age 45 and over by
24:513:35800:15:15:90:504:144:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:2010,  business  productivity  and  competitiveness  is  increasingly  dependent  on
24:514:35884:15:15:90:504:129:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:maximising  the  contribution  of  older  people.  However,  many  employers  hold
24:515:35966:15:15:90:504:114:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:outdated beliefs that younger workers are more productive than older ones, and
24:516:36044:15:15:90:504:99:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:discriminate  against  older  people  in  recruitment  and  training.  This  means  that
24:517:36132:15:15:90:504:84:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:current  retirement  patterns  can  prematurely  disenfranchise  healthy  and  able
24:518:36215:15:15:90:504:69:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:people,  who  want  to  continue  working,  from  the  active  labour  market.  These
24:519:36300:15:15:90:504:54:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:people’s productive value to the economy is lost, and their skills and knowledge are
24:520:36384:15:0:90:179:39:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:lost to employers.
25:521:36402:0:106:16:29:821:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:16
25:522:36464:106:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Evidence on the productivity of older workers (based on those aged 50–69) suggests
25:523:36546:15:15:90:504:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:that they are no less productive than younger workers, except in a limited range of
25:524:36629:15:15:90:504:685:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:jobs requiring rapid reaction or physical strength that people tend to move out of as
25:525:36714:15:15:90:504:670:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:they become older. Reduction in physical capability and work ability is probably
25:526:36794:15:15:90:504:655:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:inevitable  with  age,  but  chronological  age  is  not  a  reliable  marker.  Many  older
25:527:36885:15:25:90:406:640:144:g_d0_f7:49:g_d0_f7:workers are capable of continuing to work and want to do so.8
25:528:36946:25:15:90:504:615:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Only  where  older  workers  do  not  receive  the  same  level  of  training  as  younger
25:529:37036:15:15:90:504:600:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:workers doing the same kind of work does their performance show differences.
25:530:37112:15:15:90:504:585:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Older  workers  receiving  appropriate  job-related  training  reach  the  same  skill
25:531:37198:15:15:90:504:570:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:standards  as  younger  workers.  Evidence  suggests  that  a  reduction  in  speed  or
25:532:37285:15:15:90:504:555:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:strength is offset by aspects of working that improve with experience, for instance,
25:533:37369:15:15:90:504:540:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:prioritisation, planning, troubleshooting and motivation. And, technological change
25:534:37452:15:15:90:504:525:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:is reducing the proportion of jobs involving heavy manual work, for example, in the
25:535:37535:15:15:90:504:510:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:distribution  sector  where  technology  and  automation  has  greatly  reduced  the
25:536:37619:15:25:90:283:495:144:g_d0_f7:49:g_d0_f7:amount of physical exertion required.9
25:537:37657:25:15:90:504:470:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:However, barriers still exist in terms of access to training for older workers. Evidence
25:538:37745:15:15:90:504:455:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:suggests that training is less likely to be offered to older individuals. The likelihood of
25:539:37836:15:15:90:504:440:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:someone aged over 55 participating in training is 50 per cent less than that for an
25:540:37919:15:15:90:504:425:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:adult aged 35-44 and for employed adults training decreases markedly beyond the
25:541:37998:15:15:90:504:410:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:age of 60.10 Other evidence shows that encouragement from employers to train
25:542:38074:15:25:90:246:395:144:g_d0_f7:49:g_d0_f7:tended to tail off after 50-54.11
25:543:38107:25:15:90:504:370:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:From the point of view of the individual, delaying their retirement affords them the
25:544:38191:15:15:90:504:355:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:opportunity to benefit from more earnings and from the opportunity to save more
25:545:38270:15:15:90:504:340:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:for when they do decide to retire. Increasing State Pension age may have a role to
25:546:38352:15:25:90:372:325:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:play in assisting the individual in realising these benefits.
25:547:38413:25:15:90:504:300:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:A relatively high number of individuals retire early with little consideration of the
25:548:38498:15:15:90:504:285:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:financial implications of their decision. For example, when asked about the factors
25:549:38581:15:15:90:504:270:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:they consider when retiring, just under a third (31 per cent) of those not forced into
25:550:38667:15:15:90:504:255:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:early retirement considered the immediate financial implications. A similarly low
25:551:38748:15:15:90:504:240:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:proportion considered the longer-term financial implications.12 This finding, combined
25:552:38834:15:15:90:504:225:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:with the extent of under-saving for retirement as discussed in Chapter 4 on personal
25:553:38918:15:30:90:504:210:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:accounts, suggests that, at present, some individuals may be making sub-optimal
25:554:38997:30:18:90:505:180:49:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:8Smeaton  and  McKay,  2003,  for  instance,  find  that  men  working  post-State
25:555:39079:18:15:102:505:162:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Pension age are under represented in the construction and manufacturing sectors.
25:556:39159:15:14:102:505:147:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:They  conclude  that,  as  many  of  the  jobs  in  these  sectors  require  a  degree  of
25:557:39249:14:16:102:503:133:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:physical strength, employers may regard them as unsuitable for older workers.

26:563:39562:15:15:90:504:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:earlier than they would if they had more information on the financial implications

26:565:39728:15:15:90:504:670:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:individuals tend to underestimate their life expectancy significantly. This point will

26:568:39965:15:15:90:504:615:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:people retire too early due to information failures then increasing State Pension age
26:569:40050:15:15:90:504:600:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:may help to overcome this by signalling to them that they need to work longer than
26:570:40132:15:15:90:504:585:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:they otherwise thought. The reduction in income from later access to a State Pension
26:571:40216:15:15:90:504:570:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:may also result in individuals working for longer. Table 2.1 provides some indication
26:572:40301:15:15:90:504:555:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:of the extent to which retirement decisions are driven by expectations and financial

26:583:40786:28:15:90:504:334:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:However,  estimating  the  social  welfare  effect  of  working  longer  would  require
26:584:40873:15:15:90:504:319:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:accounting for the cost of reduced leisure both for those making optimal and those
26:585:40955:15:15:90:504:304:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:making  sub-optimal  retirement  decisions.  Measuring  the  welfare  impact  of  the
26:586:41040:15:15:90:504:289:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:reform  would,  therefore,  require  some  estimation  of  the  utility/disutility  of
26:587:41126:15:15:90:504:274:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:employment  for  the  different  individuals  affected.  However,  no  estimates  are
26:588:41211:15:15:90:504:259:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:available, however, for the extent of the work/leisure trade-off or how to account for
26:589:41297:15:15:90:504:244:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:differing  preferences  across  the  affected  population.  Estimation  of  the  welfare
26:590:41385:15:15:90:504:229:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:impact  would  entail  developing  a  model  to  take  account  of  these  preferences,
26:591:41472:15:15:90:504:214:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:something that would be an extremely challenging project and beyond the scope of
26:592:41552:15:25:90:143:199:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:this paper.
26:593:41563:25:15:90:504:174:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:There may also be a number of non-financial benefits from working longer, which
26:594:41642:15:15:90:504:159:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:will generate welfare benefits that cannot be easily measured. Research suggests
26:595:41722:15:15:90:504:144:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:that personal relationships and social networks may be important considerations in
26:596:41804:15:15:90:504:129:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:decisions about whether or when to retire. Irving et al. (2005) found that work
26:597:41883:15:15:90:504:114:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:provided a social life and social contact for many respondents, particularly those
26:598:41965:15:15:90:504:99:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:who were single, widowed or divorced. This was particularly true for people with
26:599:42045:15:15:90:504:84:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:health conditions. The researchers also found that a number of respondents cited
26:600:42125:15:15:90:504:69:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the physical and psychological benefits to the individual of remaining in work. They
26:601:42209:15:0:90:504:54:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:included self-esteem and pride, and mental and physical stimulation and activity,
27:602:42352:0:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:which some respondents believed help them defer ageing.13 Studies also suggest
27:603:42430:15:15:90:504:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:that re-employment for older workers can improve physical functioning and mental

27:606:42533:26:22:90:409:622:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:It is proposed that State Pension age will be increased in stages:
27:607:42599:22:15:90:504:600:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:•  The first increase, from 65 to 66, to be phased in over two years, starting in April
27:608:42686:15:22:102:132:585:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:2024;
27:609:42691:22:15:90:504:563:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:•  The second increase, from 66 to 67, again phased in over two years, from April
27:610:42772:15:23:102:155:548:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:2034; and
27:611:42781:23:15:90:504:525:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:•  The third increase, from 67 to 68, also to be phased in over two years, from April
27:612:42866:15:25:102:132:510:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:2044.
27:613:42871:25:15:90:504:485:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The starting point for estimating the GDP impact of these increases in State Pension
27:614:42955:15:15:90:504:470:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:age alongside measures to enable people to extend their working lives is to estimate
27:615:43039:15:15:90:504:455:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the likely employment increases resulting from the change. The estimates of the
27:616:43118:15:15:90:504:440:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:increase in employment are then multiplied by assumptions about gross earnings to
27:617:43199:15:15:90:504:425:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:estimate the increase in labour income and a product market corrector is then used
27:618:43281:15:25:90:309:410:144:g_d0_f7:49:g_d0_f7:to scale this up to the full economic value.15
27:619:43327:25:15:90:504:385:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The  approach  developed  to  estimate  the  employment  impacts  of  the  proposed
27:620:43410:15:15:90:504:370:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:changes was to consider possible upper and lower bound estimates of the likely
27:621:43488:15:25:90:128:355:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:impact.
27:622:43495:25:15:90:504:330:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The lower bound estimate of the employment effect is based on the assumption that
27:623:43576:15:15:90:504:315:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:behaviour only changes at the ages affected by the State Pension age changes. That
27:624:43658:15:15:90:504:300:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:is, when State Pension age rises from 65 to 66, only the behaviour of people aged 65
27:625:43742:15:15:90:504:285:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:changes in response. It is assumed that, as a result of the change, the change in the
27:626:43827:15:15:90:504:270:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:employment rate between 64 and 65 is kept the same as between 63 and 64. This
27:627:43904:15:25:90:398:255:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:pattern is repeated for all age groups affected by the change.
27:628:43966:25:15:90:504:230:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The changes to State Pension age only impact on employment from 2024 when the
27:629:44043:15:15:90:504:215:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:first increase is introduced. Individuals do not alter their behaviour in anticipation of
27:630:44132:15:15:90:504:200:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the changes. When fully implemented (the State Pension age has increased to 68)
27:631:44211:15:15:90:504:185:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:only the behaviour of people aged 65, 66 and 67 is different to what it otherwise
27:632:44292:15:15:90:504:170:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:would have been. This is illustrated in Figures 2.1 and 2.2, where, under the lower
27:633:44375:15:23:90:380:155:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:bound estimate, employment only changes at these ages.
27:634:44429:23:20:90:221:132:49:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:13Humphrey et al., 2003.

27:636:44496:21:18:90:505:91:49:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:15Note that this approach differs to that used to project long-term GDP levels in
27:637:44577:18:14:102:505:73:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:HM  Treasury’s  long-term  public  finance  report.  In  particular,  the  latter  uses
27:638:44664:14:15:102:505:59:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:assumptions  concerning  aggregate  productivity  growth,  rather  than  gross
27:639:44742:15:14:102:505:44:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:earnings,  to  derive  projected  GDP  levels  from  long-term  projections  of
27:640:44821:14:0:102:169:30:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:employment.
28:641:44894:0:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:It is possible, however, that this lower bound underestimates the impact of the
28:642:44973:15:15:90:504:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:changes. Behaviour may change at other ages as a result of the financial incentives
28:643:45056:15:15:90:504:685:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:created by the changes, as well as possible changes in retirement expectations as
28:644:45137:15:15:90:504:670:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:discussed  in  the  introduction. People  who  would  otherwise  retire  before  State
28:645:45222:15:15:90:504:655:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Pension age may now do so a little later as the period of retirement before access to
28:646:45307:15:15:90:504:640:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the State Pension becomes possible is now longer, similarly many who would retire
28:647:45388:15:15:90:504:625:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:after  State  Pension  age  may  now  work  even  later  in  life  to  increase  retirement
28:648:45479:15:23:90:131:610:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:income.
28:649:45486:23:15:90:504:587:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The  upper  estimate  of  the  effect  reflects  these  wider  impacts,  based  on  the
28:650:45573:15:15:90:504:572:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:assumption that an individual’s exit from the labour market moves by the same
28:651:45650:15:15:90:504:557:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:amount as State Pension age. For estimation purposes, this assumption means that
28:652:45730:15:15:90:504:542:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the employment rates at a particular age are applied to the ages immediately above,
28:653:45813:15:15:90:504:527:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:as State Pension age increases. For example, in the case of the State Pension age
28:654:45894:15:15:90:504:512:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:increase to 66, the employment rate for those aged 55 will be the same as for those
28:655:45977:15:15:90:504:497:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:aged 54. Between the ages of 56 and 65, employment rates are the same as they
28:656:46054:15:15:90:504:482:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:would have been a year previously had State Pension age not been increased (see
28:657:46133:15:15:90:504:467:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Figures 2.1 and 2.2). For example, for an individual aged 60, the employment rate
28:658:46214:15:15:90:504:452:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:will be the same as for an individual aged 59 before the increase in State Pension age
28:659:46300:15:24:90:196:437:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:has been factored in.
28:660:46321:24:15:90:504:413:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Under the upper bound estimates, it is assumed that the minimum age at which
28:661:46397:15:15:90:504:398:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:behaviour is affected is 55. This is the age at which, based on trends in age-specific
28:662:46483:15:15:90:504:383:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:employment  rates,  the  trend  towards  early  retirement  tends  to  become  clearly
28:663:46569:15:15:90:504:368:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:visible  (see  Figure  1.3).  Similarly,  it  is  assumed  that  there  is  no  impact  on  the
28:664:46664:15:15:90:504:353:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:participation and employment of those aged 70 and above. Given the low rates of
28:665:46743:15:15:90:504:338:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:employment among this group at present (see Table 2.2), any impact of the change
28:666:46823:15:31:90:205:323:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:is likely to be marginal.

28:674:47110:28:15:90:504:149:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:One further aspect of this employment scenario is the timing of the behavioural
28:675:47189:15:15:90:504:134:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:changes.  While  the  first  change  to  State  Pension  age  is  not  proposed  to  be
28:676:47276:15:15:90:504:119:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:introduced until 2024, the estimates assume that people aged 55 and over will alter

28:678:47440:15:15:90:504:89:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:otherwise exited the labour market at 55, will alter their behaviour ahead of the
28:679:47521:15:24:90:190:74:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:anticipated change.
28:680:47540:24:15:90:504:50:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:This might be an overestimation of the impact of the changes. It assumes no exit
28:681:47620:15:0:90:504:35:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:from the labour market over a three-year age range (ages 55, 56 and 57) once the
29:682:47762:0:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:State Pension increase is fully implemented. A middle estimate based on an average
29:683:47844:15:15:90:504:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:of the two estimates described above has been produced to arrive at a potentially
29:684:47925:15:23:90:304:685:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:more realistic estimate of the likely impact.

29:686:48054:15:15:90:504:647:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:to have on the employment rate of men and women aged 55-69 once increased to
29:687:48130:15:27:90:386:632:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:68 in 2046 under each of the three employment scenarios.

30:690:48344:0:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:This  approach  gives  us  three  estimates  (upper,  middle  and  lower)  of  the  likely
30:691:48434:15:15:90:504:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:employment impact of the changes as shown in Figures 2.1 and 2.2. In estimating
30:692:48513:15:15:90:504:685:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the  employment  impacts,  the  estimates  use  the  HM  Treasury  projections  of
30:693:48595:15:15:90:504:670:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:employment, developed for the 2005 pre-budget report, as their base.16 Equalisation
30:694:48678:15:25:90:466:655:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:of State Pension age between 2010 and 2020 is factored into the baseline.
30:695:48751:25:15:90:504:630:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Under  each  of  the  three  scenarios  we  want  to  know  the  likely  contribution  to
30:696:48840:15:15:90:504:615:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:economic output that the estimated increases in employment will produce. To do
30:697:48918:15:15:90:504:600:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:so, we use the absolute increase in numbers employed combined with information
30:698:48996:15:15:90:504:585:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:on hours and earnings of the groups of workers affected by the change. Applying
30:699:49075:15:15:90:504:570:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:estimates of the annual gross earnings of workers affected under the estimates of
30:700:49156:15:15:90:504:555:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:employment change allows us to calculate an estimate of the annual aggregate
30:701:49232:15:25:90:393:540:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:increase in labour income under each of the three scenarios.
30:702:49292:25:15:90:504:515:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Data on earnings and hours was sourced from the Labour Force Survey and based on
30:703:49372:15:15:90:504:500:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:a four-quarter average (summer 2005 – spring 2006). Information on earnings and
30:704:49451:15:15:90:504:485:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:hours was obtained for the three age groups affected by the proposed changes;
30:705:49528:15:15:90:504:470:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:those aged 55-59, aged 60-64 and 65-69. To reflect the different earnings and
30:706:49605:15:15:90:504:455:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:working patterns of men and women, this information was further broken down by
30:707:49683:15:15:90:504:440:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:gender for each of the three age groups. Changes in hours and earnings are more
30:708:49762:15:15:90:504:425:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:visible over five-year age bands than at individual ages while still allowing us to
30:709:49845:15:15:90:504:410:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:reflect the changing earnings and working patterns of people as they approach
30:710:49922:15:25:90:496:395:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:State Pension age as well as those continuing to work beyond State Pension age.
30:711:50001:25:15:90:504:370:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The information on earnings and hours is, by its nature, retrospective. It is based on
30:712:50087:15:15:90:504:355:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the employment and working patterns of those aged 55-69 currently in the labour
30:713:50166:15:15:90:504:340:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:force. These may be subject to change in the future as working patterns change and
30:714:50248:15:15:90:504:325:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:older workers benefit from newly implemented extending working life measures
30:715:50324:15:15:90:504:310:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:such as age discrimination legislation. Therefore the estimates of hours and earnings
30:716:50409:15:15:90:504:295:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:contained in this analysis have the potential to either under or overestimate future
30:717:50493:15:25:90:125:280:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:trends.
30:718:50500:25:15:90:504:255:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:In  terms  of  underestimating  future  trends,  it  is  possible  that  the  older  workers
30:719:50592:15:15:90:504:240:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:affected by the changes to State Pension age may see an increase in gross earnings
30:720:50674:15:15:90:504:225:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:and hours in the future. At present, a large portion of this group has the option of
30:721:50758:15:15:90:504:210:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:gradually moving into retirement by continuing to work beyond State Pension age at
30:722:50840:15:15:90:504:195:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:reduced hours, but supplementing their income with State Pension income. After
30:723:50918:15:15:90:504:180:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the introduction of the proposed State Pension age increases the opportunity to
30:724:50997:15:15:90:504:165:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:supplement earnings with State Pension income will only be available to those aged
30:725:51079:15:15:90:504:150:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:68 and over. We may, therefore, see an increase in hours worked amongst the age
30:726:51158:15:78:90:298:135:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:group affected by the proposed changes.

31:729:51333:106:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:On the other hand, data on hours and earnings may be an overestimate of the future
31:730:51415:15:15:90:504:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:trends we are likely to see as a result of changes to State Pension age. The data on
31:731:51499:15:15:90:504:685:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:hours and earnings used in this analysis is based on those observed in the workplace
31:732:51583:15:15:90:504:670:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:and might not fully be representative of all older people. Those who remain in work
31:733:51666:15:15:90:504:655:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:at present might be more productive than those whose work capacity is adversely
31:734:51745:15:15:90:504:640:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:affected by illness or disability. It may be that the employment of older workers in the
31:735:51833:15:15:90:504:625:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:future may feature less productive workers who may work for fewer hours or lower
31:736:51913:15:15:90:504:610:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:earnings than those employed at present. It is also  conceivable that those who retire
31:737:51999:15:15:90:504:595:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:fully at present may not be able to do so in the future but may seek to retire gradually,
31:738:52088:15:25:90:371:580:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:reducing their hours as they reach their retirement date.
31:739:52145:25:15:90:504:555:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Both of these are plausible scenarios, but are difficult to predict with any great
31:740:52227:15:15:90:504:540:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:certainty. In the absence of reliable evidence or information on how these trends
31:741:52308:15:15:90:504:525:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:might evolve in the future, past patterns of earnings and hours represent the best
31:742:52390:15:25:90:330:510:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:estimate of future earnings and hours available.
31:743:52438:25:15:90:504:485:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:To estimate the future gross earnings of those affected by the increase in State
31:744:52518:15:15:90:504:470:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Pension  age,  average  earnings  for  each  group  are  up-rated  by  estimated  real
31:745:52604:15:15:90:504:455:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:earnings  growth  to  arrive  at  future  estimates  of  annual  gross  earnings.  For  the
31:746:52695:15:15:90:504:440:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:purpose  of  up-rating  earnings,  we  have  assumed  annual  real  wage  growth  of
31:747:52779:15:25:90:240:425:144:g_d0_f7:49:g_d0_f7:approximately two per cent.17
31:748:52808:25:15:90:504:400:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:To estimate the value of output produced by these additional workers, a product
31:749:52887:15:15:90:504:385:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:market corrector is used to scale up the increase in labour income resulting from the
31:750:52972:15:15:90:504:370:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:reforms to the full economic value. This variable, used in economic effectiveness
31:751:53053:15:15:90:504:355:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:calculations, accounts for the value of workers output being divided between wages
31:752:53135:15:15:90:504:340:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:and firms’ profits and is calculated as the inverse of the labour share of total factor
31:753:53222:15:25:90:480:325:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:income. For the purpose of the analysis contained here it is estimated at 1.26.
31:754:53301:25:15:90:504:300:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Results of this analysis are presented in the results section below. The methodology
31:755:53385:15:15:90:504:285:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:employed here is intended to estimate the impact on future GDP of increasing State
31:756:53467:15:15:90:504:270:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Pension age alongside measures to extend working life by estimating the employment
31:757:53549:15:15:90:504:255:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:increases from these changes and reflecting the earnings and productivity profile of
31:758:53633:15:37:90:198:240:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the workers affected.
31:759:53654:37:26:90:429:203:256:g_d0_f7:256:g_d0_f7:2.4Limitations and weaknesses in methodology
31:760:53698:26:15:90:504:177:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:There is major uncertainty surrounding both future labour market projections and
31:761:53778:15:15:90:504:162:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the behavioural responses we expect in response to raising State Pension age and
31:762:53858:15:62:90:504:147:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:accompanying measures to extend working life. In particular, forecasts of the likely
31:763:53942:62:18:90:505:85:49:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:17Given that baseline employment remains roughly constant between now and
31:764:54015:18:14:102:505:67:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:2050, this implies that the share of labour in GDP remains constant at today’s
31:765:54093:14:0:102:128:53:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:level.
32:766:54161:0:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:employment impact of increasing State Pension age are based on strong assumptions
32:767:54242:15:15:90:504:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:as to likely behavioural responses and, as we discuss elsewhere, may either under or
32:768:54326:15:25:90:414:685:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:over estimate the associated employment impacts of the reform.
32:769:54388:25:15:90:504:660:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:A major limitation of this analysis is that it can only capture first-round employment
32:770:54474:15:15:90:504:645:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:impacts of the proposed reform. The simple modelling used for this analysis does not
32:771:54558:15:15:90:504:630:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:include any interaction with other economic variables. For example, this excludes
32:772:54639:15:15:90:504:615:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:any  second-round  impacts  that  may  result  from  the  increases  in  employment
32:773:54722:15:25:90:311:600:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:brought about by raising State Pension age.
32:774:54765:25:15:90:504:575:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:To further understand the full impacts of the reform package under analysis here we
32:775:54848:15:15:90:504:560:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:have asked the NIESR to help model the impacts by using NiGEM, their macroeconomic
32:776:54930:15:15:90:504:545:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:model for the UK and world economy. The results of this are discussed further in

32:781:55206:15:15:90:504:437:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:approximately 300,000 under the lower bound estimate to 1.6 million under the
32:782:55283:15:15:90:504:422:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:upper bound estimate. The middle estimate based on an average of these two gives
32:783:55363:15:25:90:329:407:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:an estimated employment increase of 900,000.

32:798:56233:15:15:90:504:125:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:discussed earlier (see Section 2.3), the impact on GDP of the proposed increases in
32:799:56316:15:15:90:504:110:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:State Pension age are heavily driven by how individuals change their labour market

33:809:57008:15:15:90:504:622:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:and, as we have already outlined, contain a large degree of uncertainty. Here we
33:810:57088:15:25:90:333:607:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:look at the impact of varying these assumptions.
33:811:57136:25:15:90:504:582:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:One of the central assumptions made in producing our main results relates to the
33:812:57216:15:15:90:504:567:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:pattern of earnings for older workers. We have assumed that the future pattern of
33:813:57297:15:25:90:347:552:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:total earnings by age remain as they are at present.
33:814:57349:25:15:90:504:527:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:In describing the methodology behind our analysis we discussed the information we
33:815:57430:15:15:90:504:512:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:used to arrive at an assumption regarding earnings and how this assumption may
33:816:57508:15:15:90:504:497:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:either over or under estimate the total average earnings of older workers going
33:817:57587:15:15:90:504:482:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:forward. We relax this main assumption regarding the earnings of older worker and
33:818:57668:15:25:90:364:467:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:look at two alternative scenarios of their future trends.
33:819:57725:25:15:90:504:442:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:First we look at the case where total average earnings of those aged 55-69 remain at
33:820:57809:15:15:90:504:427:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the same level of those of younger workers (i.e. show no decline with age). This
33:821:57889:15:15:90:504:412:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:allows us to look at the scenario where the estimates of the future earnings of those
33:822:57974:15:15:90:504:397:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:affected by increases in State Pension age presented in our central results are too
33:823:58057:15:15:90:504:382:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:low. To account for this outcome we assume that average total wages for those
33:824:58134:15:25:90:453:367:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:aged 55-69 do not show any difference from those of younger workers.
33:825:58202:25:15:90:504:342:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Changing this assumption has the greatest impact on the average earnings figure
33:826:58281:15:15:90:504:327:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:assumed for the 65-69 age group – under our main assumption the average total
33:827:58358:15:15:90:504:312:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:earnings for this group is assumed to be approximately half that of younger workers.
33:828:58442:15:15:90:504:297:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:For the 55-59 and 60-64 age groups a significant difference is discernable but not as
33:829:58527:15:25:90:156:282:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:pronounced.
33:830:58538:25:15:90:504:257:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Changing our earnings assumption, therefore, impacts most significantly on our
33:831:58616:15:15:90:504:242:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:lower  bound  estimates.  Under  the  lower  bound  employment  assumption,  only
33:832:58697:15:15:90:504:227:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:those aged 65-69 are affected by the changes and so estimates of GDP impact based
33:833:58778:15:15:90:504:212:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:on the lower bound employment estimates are most sensitive to this change in our
33:834:58858:15:32:90:232:197:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:assumptions (see Table 2.4).

34:845:59445:15:15:90:504:685:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the results presented in Table 2.3. This is as expected given the group affected and
34:846:59529:15:25:90:471:670:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the impact of the altered assumption on the average earnings of this group.
34:847:59604:25:15:90:504:645:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The middle and upper bound GDP estimates are not as sensitive to changing our
34:848:59681:15:15:90:504:630:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:earnings assumption as the lower bound estimate. This is largely because the 65-69
34:849:59763:15:15:90:504:615:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:group forms a smaller proportion of the effected group under these scenarios so the
34:850:59846:15:15:90:504:600:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:impact of changing our assumption is dampened by the greater proportion of 55-64
34:851:59926:15:15:90:504:585:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:year olds affected by this change who do not see their earnings altered by as much

34:855:60206:15:15:90:504:515:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:assumed in our main results. This allows us to look at the possibility that we have
34:856:60289:15:25:90:445:500:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:overestimated the future earnings of older workers in our main results.
34:857:60360:25:15:90:504:475:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:In this case we look at the scenario where the average wage of older workers is equal
34:858:60445:15:15:90:504:460:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:to the average wage of the 65-69 year old group (approximately 50 per cent that of

34:872:61197:15:15:90:504:205:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:State Pension age. The main difference is to our central and upper estimates, due to
34:873:61281:15:15:90:504:190:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the more significant changes in the earnings assumptions for 55-64 year olds who
34:874:61361:15:25:90:431:175:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:are affected under these employment scenarios as discussed earlier.

36:900:63231:15:15:90:504:392:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:previous chapter, the measures to extend working life. In addition, it quantifies the
36:901:63316:15:15:90:504:377:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:impact of the introduction of personal accounts. It presents the results of policy
36:902:63398:15:15:90:504:362:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:simulations with a macroeconomic model of the UK economy. These help to assess
36:903:63476:15:15:90:504:347:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the likely effects of introducing personal accounts and extending working life on a
36:904:63559:15:15:90:504:332:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:number of macroeconomic variables, in particular on output and income, employment
36:905:63640:15:25:90:152:317:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:and savings.
36:906:63652:25:15:90:504:292:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The  remainder  of  this  chapter  is  organised  as  follows.  The  next  section  broadly
36:907:63743:15:15:90:504:277:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:describes the analytical framework and methodology to make clear how they differ
36:908:63823:15:15:90:504:262:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:from the previous chapter and what the underlying assumptions are. It also includes
36:909:63906:15:15:90:504:247:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:a discussion of the limitations of a macroeconomic modelling approach. The main
36:910:63985:15:15:90:504:232:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:sections present the results of the introduction of personal accounts and extending
36:911:64068:15:15:90:504:217:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:working life and some of the sensitivities around these results. The final section
36:912:64150:15:15:90:504:202:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:concludes by considering whether the results of the two sets of simulations are
36:913:64229:15:37:90:167:187:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:additive or not.
36:914:64245:37:26:90:276:150:256:g_d0_f7:256:g_d0_f7:3.2Analytical framework
36:915:64268:26:15:90:504:124:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The approach to estimating the economic effects of the reform proposals will be
36:916:64347:15:15:90:504:109:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:different from the one followed in the previous chapter. Instead of assessing the
36:917:64428:15:15:90:504:94:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:reform package by starting from a partial microeconomic perspective, this chapter
36:918:64509:15:15:90:504:79:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:follows  a  macroeconomic  general  equilibrium  approach.  Such  an  approach  has
36:919:64592:15:15:90:504:64:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:certain advantages and limitations and should, therefore, be seen as complementary
36:920:64674:15:15:90:504:49:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:to the results of the previous chapter. In particular, using a macroeconomic model
36:921:64756:15:0:90:504:34:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:makes  it  possible  to  investigate  the  effects  the  reforms  will  have  on  the  wider
37:922:64848:0:106:16:29:821:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:28
37:923:64913:106:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:economy, whilst allowing for relevant interactions between economic variables. On
37:924:64994:15:15:90:504:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the other hand, such an approach by its very nature makes it impossible to identify
37:925:65077:15:37:90:179:685:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:individual effects.
37:926:65096:37:26:90:224:648:256:g_d0_f7:256:g_d0_f7:3.3Methodology
37:927:65110:26:15:90:504:622:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The DWP asked the NIESR to help model the impact of the reform package by using
37:928:65189:15:25:90:435:607:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:NiGEM, their macroeconomic model for the UK and world economy.
37:929:65251:25:15:90:504:582:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:NiGEM is a large estimated quarterly model of the UK and the world that is intended
37:930:65334:15:15:90:504:567:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:to  capture  the  key  features  of  the  economy.  It  is  theoretically  coherent  and
37:931:65422:15:15:90:504:552:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:quantified by means of empirical estimation and calibration over recent historical
37:932:65504:15:15:90:504:537:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:experience.  It  provides  a  plausible  benchmark  for  estimating  the  effects  on  the
37:933:65594:15:25:90:312:522:144:g_d0_f7:49:g_d0_f7:economy of a range of different scenarios.19
37:934:65638:25:15:90:504:497:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:It is set in what is essentially a New-Keynesian framework where agents are forward
37:935:65721:15:15:90:504:482:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:looking,  but  nominal  rigidities,  namely  sticky  prices  and  adjustment  costs,  slow
37:936:65811:15:15:90:504:467:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:down the adjustment to the long-run equilibrium. It includes complete demand and
37:937:65891:15:15:90:504:452:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:supply sides, as well as extensive monetary and financial sectors. Domestic demand,
37:938:65974:15:15:90:504:437:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:aggregate supply, and the external sector are linked through the wage-price system,
37:939:66057:15:15:90:504:422:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:income and wealth, the financial sector, the Government sector, and competitiveness.
37:940:66141:15:15:90:504:407:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The external sector links the UK domestic economy to the rest of the world. The
37:941:66220:15:15:90:504:392:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:theoretical  structure  and  some  simulation  properties  of  NiGEM  are  described  in
37:942:66308:15:15:90:504:377:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Barrell et  al.  (2004).  A  brief  description  of  the  determination  of  savings  and
37:943:66397:15:37:90:413:362:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:investment within NiGEM is provided in the annex to this report.
37:944:66461:37:26:90:429:325:256:g_d0_f7:256:g_d0_f7:3.4Limitations and weaknesses in methodology
37:945:66505:26:15:90:504:299:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Using a macroeconomic model such as NiGEM results in a number of limitations. As
37:946:66585:15:25:90:499:284:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:mentioned above, such a model is not well suited to assess effects for individuals.
37:947:66668:25:15:90:504:259:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:A  model  such  as  NiGEM  does,  however,  make  it  possible  to  assess  the  impact
37:948:66755:15:15:90:504:244:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:different interventions have on aggregate consumption. Lifetime consumption is, in
37:949:66837:15:15:90:504:229:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:principle, the variable that any Government intervention could be seen to optimise
37:950:66919:15:15:90:505:214:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:with its pension policy.20 So one could argue that we should be able to calculate a
37:951:67002:15:15:90:504:199:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Net Present Value (NPV) of the Government’s pension reforms, as in a typical cost-
37:952:67084:15:15:90:504:184:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:benefit analysis such as presented in the Government ‘Green Book’.21 However,
37:953:67161:15:25:90:299:169:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:such a number would not be meaningful.
37:954:67199:25:15:90:504:144:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The main problem with such an approach is that an aggregate only makes sense if it
37:955:67281:15:38:90:504:129:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:has an individual basis. The reason is that in this case it is of crucial importance whose
37:956:67371:38:18:90:505:91:49:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:19It  is  important  to  note  that  the  specifics  of  the  baseline  are  not  important  in
37:957:67466:18:16:102:353:73:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:generating the simulation results presented here.
37:958:67515:16:21:90:452:57:49:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:20Or GDP or GNP if we would consider this is an appropriate measure.

38:960:67668:0:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:consumption  is  being  affected  at  what  point  in  time  to  be  able  to  calculate  an
38:961:67760:15:25:90:177:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:appropriate NPV.
38:962:67776:25:15:90:504:675:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:There is also a more general problem with using macroeconomic models such as
38:963:67852:15:15:90:504:660:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:NiGEM for evaluation purposes. NiGEM is a model that assumes individuals have full
38:964:67934:15:15:90:504:645:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:information,  that  markets  are  perfect  and  the  economic  agents  optimise  their
38:965:68020:15:15:90:504:630:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:behaviour. In contrast, the pension reform proposals are based on analysis that
38:966:68099:15:15:90:504:615:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:suggests  there  are  informational  problems,  pension  markets  are  imperfect,  and
38:967:68185:15:25:90:469:600:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:individuals do not seem to optimise consumption throughout their lifetime.
38:968:68259:25:15:90:504:575:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The issue of simulating the outcome of pension reforms in a model that reflects
38:969:68338:15:15:90:504:560:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:individuals maximising decisions using the information they have available to them
38:970:68420:15:15:90:504:545:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:is addressed directly when we model the impact of increasing State Pension age. As
38:971:68502:15:15:90:504:530:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:part of the modelling exercise, it is assumed that people currently underestimate
38:972:68583:15:15:90:504:515:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:their life expectancy and that they will gradually adjust their expectations as time
38:973:68667:15:25:90:459:500:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:goes on. We will address this issue in some more detail in the Section 3.6.
38:974:68742:25:15:90:504:475:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The issue of calculating a NPV of pension reform, in particular personal accounts, will
38:975:68829:15:37:90:219:460:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:be taken up in Chapter 4.
38:976:68854:37:26:90:220:423:256:g_d0_f7:256:g_d0_f7:3.5Assumptions
38:977:68868:26:15:90:504:397:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:For the purpose of the simulations described in this report, NIESR has constructed a
38:978:68952:15:15:90:504:382:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:new baseline economic scenario for NiGEM that runs until 2059, against which the
38:979:69032:15:15:90:504:367:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:impacts of the reform package are modelled. In this way it was possible to ensure
38:980:69113:15:15:90:504:352:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:robust assessment of the impact of the relevant policy interventions proposed in the
38:981:69197:15:15:90:504:337:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:White Paper, Security in retirement: towards a new pensions system (‘the White
38:982:69275:15:15:90:504:322:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Paper’ hereafter), up to 2050. Where possible, NiGEM has used the same assumptions
38:983:69357:15:15:90:504:307:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:as those that were used for the White Paper and in the previous chapter. However,
38:984:69438:15:15:90:504:292:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:where these assumptions differ, they generally have no significant impact on the
38:985:69518:15:25:90:205:277:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:results presented here.
38:986:69541:25:15:90:504:252:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:As  most  of  the  Government  interventions  considered  are  expected  to  have  an
38:987:69626:15:25:90:471:237:144:g_d0_f7:49:g_d0_f7:impact on consumption, we provide the relevant equation in NiGEM here:22
38:988:69698:25:24:147:326:212:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:C(t) = (    + ρ) * ( HUW(t) + NHW(t)),
38:989:69736:24:15:90:504:188:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:where HUW is human wealth and NHW is financial and housing and asset based
38:990:69810:15:15:90:504:173:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:wealth. The Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) is made up of the premium on
38:991:69887:15:15:90:504:158:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the future (     ) and the probability of death (ρ). The higher       and ρ, the less important
38:992:69982:15:25:90:435:143:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:is the future, and, therefore, the higher current consumption will be.
38:993:70052:25:15:90:504:118:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:As already noted in the introduction, personal accounts are intended to provide a
38:994:70133:15:15:90:504:103:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:new  low-cost  defined  contribution  pension  scheme  for  those  who  do  not  have
38:995:70218:15:32:90:504:88:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:access to an alternative employer scheme that meets certain minimum standards. It

39:997:70338:0:106:16:29:821:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:30
39:998:70403:106:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:is estimated that annual contributions will amount to £7-8 billion once the scheme
39:999:70485:15:15:90:504:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:is fully running. However, it is unlikely that all of the contributions into personal
39:1000:70570:15:15:90:504:685:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:accounts will be ‘new’ or additional savings, as a number of people will substitute
39:1001:70653:15:15:90:504:670:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:away from existing savings once they start contributing to personal accounts. As
39:1002:70733:15:15:90:504:655:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:mentioned in the chapter on personal accounts, the Government estimates that
39:1003:70809:15:15:90:504:640:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:around 60 per cent of savings in personal accounts will be new savings, resulting in
39:1004:70893:15:25:90:445:625:144:g_d0_f7:49:g_d0_f7:£4-5 billion of additional savings each year due to personal accounts.23
39:1005:70965:25:15:90:504:600:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:To simulate the introduction of personal accounts in NiGEM, we effectively lowered
39:1006:71047:15:15:90:504:585:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the  MPC,  a  variable  that  describes  what  proportion  of  income  is  spent  on
39:1007:71131:15:15:90:504:570:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:consumption, in the equation that determines consumption behaviour. This implies
39:1008:71211:15:15:90:504:555:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:that, all else being equal, individuals will save more at every level of income. The
39:1009:71295:15:15:90:504:540:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:rationale behind this from a modelling point of view is that introducing automatic
39:1010:71377:15:15:90:504:525:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:enrolment  and  personal  accounts  will  change  what  could  be  considered  a
39:1011:71457:15:15:90:504:510:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:sub-optimally high MPC. This change in the MPC would be the result of overcoming
39:1012:71537:15:15:90:504:495:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:some of the underlying psychological barriers to saving, such as inertia and myopia,

39:1016:71749:26:15:90:504:409:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Following the proposals in the White Paper, it is assumed that personal accounts will
39:1017:71834:15:15:90:504:394:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:be introduced in 2012 and that there will be a phasing-in period of three years. In
39:1018:71917:15:15:90:504:379:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:line with the estimate presented above, we have simulated a total savings increase
39:1019:71999:15:15:90:504:364:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:of  £4.5  billion  in  our  central  scenario.24  Figure  3.1  shows  what  happens  to  the
39:1020:72091:15:15:90:504:349:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:personal savings rate (as a percentage of disposable income) in the central scenario.
39:1021:72176:15:15:90:504:334:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:From 2012 the savings rate increases quickly in the first three years, in line with the
39:1022:72263:15:15:90:505:319:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:phasing-in.25 After this it settles around 0.5 percentage point above the base case
39:1023:72346:15:43:90:417:304:144:g_d0_f7:49:g_d0_f7:until the end of the forecasting period presented here, in 2050.26

39:1026:72557:16:18:90:505:226:49:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:24In 2006 earnings terms, i.e. the nominal numbers will be significantly higher in
39:1027:72639:18:16:102:445:208:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:2012 and onwards as they are uprated by economy-wide earnings.
39:1028:72701:16:19:90:505:192:49:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:25As is clear from the graph, the savings rates also move marginally in the run-up
39:1029:72783:19:14:102:505:173:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:to 2012; this has no direct connection with personal accounts, but is the result
39:1030:72863:14:14:102:505:159:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:of  endogenous  changes  in  the  model  that  result  from  economic  agents
39:1031:72940:14:17:102:294:145:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:anticipating the introduction in 2012.
39:1032:72978:17:18:90:505:128:49:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:26As noted, the MPC in NiGEM is changed permanently to simulate the possible
39:1033:73054:18:14:102:505:110:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:impact of personal accounts. This is based on the premise that personal accounts
39:1034:73134:14:15:102:505:96:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:will  be  instrumental  in  permanently  raising  the  personal  savings  rate,  as  was
39:1035:73222:15:14:102:505:81:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:supported by the evidence presented in Hawksworth, 2006. In practice, it might
39:1036:73300:14:14:102:505:67:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:be that, whatever the initial offset, there will be stronger (or weaker) substitution
39:1037:73385:14:0:102:227:53:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:effects throughout time.

40:1040:73539:295:15:90:504:407:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The savings increase associated with the introduction of personal accounts implies
40:1041:73621:15:15:90:504:392:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:lower  consumption  in  the  short-term,  which  initially  has  a  downward  effect  on
40:1042:73709:15:15:90:504:377:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:economic activity. Figure 3.2 plots the path that two different measures of economic
40:1043:73793:15:15:90:504:362:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:activity, GDP and GNP are forecast to follow between now and 2050 compared to
40:1044:73870:15:15:90:504:347:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the base case. GDP represents annual domestic production, whereas GNP also takes
40:1045:73950:15:25:90:333:332:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:into account (net) income received from abroad.
40:1046:73997:25:15:90:504:307:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Looking at GDP, the most commonly used indicator of economic activity, the graph
40:1047:74077:15:15:90:504:292:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:shows a very small increase in economic activity between now and 2012.27 This has
40:1048:74158:15:15:90:504:277:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:to do with the fact that individuals and financial markets are assumed to be forward
40:1049:74242:15:15:90:504:262:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:looking. Financial markets anticipate that future monetary policy will react to lower
40:1050:74327:15:15:90:504:247:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:consumption  by  lowering  interest  rates.  As  a  result  exchange  rates  will  react
40:1051:74415:15:15:90:504:232:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:immediately and will ‘jump’ down to a new equilibrium. In turn, the lower exchange
40:1052:74497:15:25:90:490:217:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:rate causes exports to rise, which results in a small increase in economic activity.
40:1053:74581:25:15:90:504:192:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The small decrease in GDP compared to the baseline from 2012 onwards is caused
40:1054:74659:15:34:90:504:177:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:by the initial savings increase, which results in lower consumption in the short run.
40:1055:74744:34:18:90:505:143:49:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:27It is important to keep in mind that here and in the remainder of this chapter any
40:1056:74828:18:15:102:505:125:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:effects are (level) differences compared to the base case. When economic activity
40:1057:74909:15:14:102:505:110:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:is concerned, this base case forecasts an average long-term growth rate of around
40:1058:74990:14:15:102:505:96:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:2¼ per cent. Therefore, if one would want to find the growth rate in any particular
40:1059:75073:15:14:102:504:81:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:year one should roughly add 2¼ per cent to the (level) difference in that particular
40:1060:75157:14:14:102:505:67:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:year and the previous year. For all scenarios concerned this implies that annual
40:1061:75237:14:0:102:351:53:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:growth rates are always projected to be positive.
41:1062:75351:0:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The economy then gradually reverts back to the original growth path as it adjusts to
41:1063:75435:15:15:90:504:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the new level of savings in the economy. It should be emphasised that all of the
41:1064:75515:15:15:90:504:685:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:changes  described  here  are  very  small.  For  example,  the  cumulative  downward
41:1065:75600:15:15:90:504:670:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:effect  does  not  go  beyond  0.15  per  cent,  and  the  largest  impact  on  economic
41:1066:75688:15:15:90:504:655:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:growth in any given year remains below 0.05 per cent, a magnitude that is not likely
41:1067:75772:15:33:90:230:640:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:to be detectable in practice.
41:1068:75801:33:14:90:479:607:169:g_d0_f6:169:g_d0_f6:Figure 3.2Impact of personal accounts on economic activity –
41:1069:75861:14:284:175:270:593:169:g_d0_f6:169:g_d0_f6:central scenario
41:1070:75877:284:15:90:504:309:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:It is immediately clear from comparing the paths of GDP and GNP that they produce
41:1071:75958:15:15:90:504:294:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:a very similar pattern. The main difference between the two is that GNP is higher at
41:1072:76042:15:15:90:504:279:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:any point in time; it settles around 0.2 per cent above the base case, still representing
41:1073:76131:15:25:90:168:264:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:a limited effect.
41:1074:76148:25:15:90:504:239:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The reason that GNP is higher than GDP in this scenario has to do with the fact that
41:1075:76232:15:15:90:504:224:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:it includes investment income received from abroad. NiGEM models the UK as a
41:1076:76308:15:15:90:504:209:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:small open economy in which investment decisions are taken independently from
41:1077:76385:15:15:90:504:194:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the domestic savings decisions. If, as in this case, the domestic supply of savings
41:1078:76468:15:15:90:504:179:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:increases without a fundamental change in the profitability of investment, most of
41:1079:76550:15:15:90:504:164:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:these savings will go abroad. This in turn leads to a build-up of foreign capital. The
41:1080:76636:15:15:90:504:149:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:associated investment returns that flow back do not show up in the GDP measure of
41:1081:76717:15:34:90:312:134:144:g_d0_f7:49:g_d0_f7:economic activity but are reflected in GNP.28
41:1082:76762:34:19:90:505:100:49:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:28As  an  aggregate  model,  NiGEM  is  not  designed  to  describe  the  investment
41:1083:76846:19:14:102:505:81:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:allocation  of  personal  accounts.  The  overall  portfolio  of  the  economy  has  to
41:1084:76933:14:14:102:505:67:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:adjust to contain more foreign assets, even if personal accounts do not, and in
41:1085:77012:14:15:102:505:53:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:competitive  financial  system  this  process  takes  place  through  very  minor
41:1086:77093:15:0:102:219:38:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:adjustments in returns.
42:1087:77181:0:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Given the inherent uncertainty around participation rates and the exact level of
42:1088:77261:15:15:90:504:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:additional savings, we have modelled two additional scenarios which, together with
42:1089:77343:15:15:90:504:685:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:our  central  scenario,  should  provide  a  realistic  range  of  outcomes  in  terms  of
42:1090:77433:15:15:90:504:670:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:additional  savings.  The  conservative  and  optimistic  scenarios  model  additional
42:1091:77519:15:15:90:504:655:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:savings of respectively £2.5 and £7 billion.29 The results of these analyses show the
42:1092:77604:15:15:90:504:640:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:same patterns in savings behaviour and economic activity as the central scenario.
42:1093:77685:15:15:90:504:625:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The long-term effect on GDP is again close to zero, whereas the long-term effect on
42:1094:77768:15:37:90:504:610:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:GNP is 0.1 and 0.3 per cent respectively in the conservative and optimistic scenarios.
42:1095:77854:37:26:90:344:573:256:g_d0_f7:256:g_d0_f7:3.7Personal accounts – sensitivities
42:1096:77890:26:15:90:504:547:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:As noted above, NiGEM is a model that assumes all economic actors are forward
42:1097:77967:15:15:90:504:532:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:looking, i.e. they adjust their behaviour today to events which they know will occur
42:1098:78051:15:15:90:504:517:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:in the future, though there are some frictions in the adjustment process. To test how
42:1099:78136:15:15:90:504:502:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:sensitive the results are to this assumption, the scenarios were also run in a model
42:1100:78220:15:15:90:504:487:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:with  financial  markets,  wages,  business  investment  and  consumers  who  are  all
42:1101:78306:15:15:90:504:472:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:backward  looking,  in  that  reactions  depend  only  on  past  events  and  not
42:1102:78387:15:25:90:224:457:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:expectations of the future.
42:1103:78414:25:15:90:504:432:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Unsurprisingly,  the  economy  shows  more  of  a  cycle  with  backward  looking
42:1104:78495:15:15:90:504:417:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:behaviour, as everybody acts as if they are totally surprised by the policy change.
42:1105:78578:15:15:90:504:402:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:However, even with backward looking agents, the short-term effect on GDP is still
42:1106:78659:15:15:90:504:387:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:relatively small (Figure 3.3). If only consumers are backward looking, the impact is
42:1107:78743:15:15:90:504:372:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:roughly the same as in the case with forward looking consumers. If other economic
42:1108:78824:15:15:90:504:357:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:agents, i.e. financial markets and businesses selling goods to consumers, are also
42:1109:78906:15:15:90:504:342:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:surprised by the new policy, the cumulative downward effect on output is magnified
42:1110:78988:15:15:90:504:327:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:about threefold. Compared to forward looking agents, there is also more of an
42:1111:79065:15:15:90:504:312:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:upswing after the initial shock, resulting in a cumulative positive effect for a number
42:1112:79152:15:15:90:504:297:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:of years after 2023, with a peak just around 0.25 per cent in 2032, after which GDP
42:1113:79235:15:226:90:356:282:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:gradually falls again in the direction of the base case.

43:1118:79512:25:15:90:504:394:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The introduction presented the rationale for working longer in a society in which
43:1119:79593:15:15:90:504:379:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:people on average live substantially longer than before. In the pension context, the
43:1120:79677:15:15:90:504:364:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:most important measure to extend working life is the increase of the State Pension
43:1121:79759:15:25:90:112:349:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:age.
43:1122:79763:25:15:90:504:324:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The  previous  chapter,  dealing  with  increasing  State  Pension  age  and  extending
43:1123:79850:15:15:90:504:309:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:working life, explains how raising State Pension age might increase employment in
43:1124:79931:15:15:90:504:294:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:a number of ways. If some people retire too early due to information failures then
43:1125:80013:15:15:90:504:279:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:increasing State Pension age may help to overcome this by signalling to them that
43:1126:80094:15:15:90:504:264:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:they need to work longer than they otherwise thought. The reduction in income
43:1127:80171:15:25:90:496:249:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:from later access to a State Pension may also result in individuals working longer.
43:1128:80254:25:15:90:504:224:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:As  the  Government  proposals  see  State  Pension  age  for  both  men  and  women
43:1129:80338:15:15:90:504:209:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:gradually  increase  by  three  years  –  from  65  to  6830  –  we  have  modelled  that
43:1130:80427:15:15:90:504:194:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:individuals adjust their estimates of their life expectancy by three years as well as a
43:1131:80514:15:15:90:504:179:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:result of the reform package. In other words, we have assumed that individuals see
43:1132:80596:15:15:90:504:164:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:an increase in State Pension age as a signal that their life expectancy has increased by
43:1133:80684:15:15:90:504:149:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the same amount. This might seem a somewhat simplistic behavioural assumption
43:1134:80761:15:15:90:504:134:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:at first, as we actually estimate life expectancy to increase by more than three years
43:1135:80847:15:15:90:504:119:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:between  now  and  2050,  but  fits  with  a  world  of  imperfect  information  and
43:1136:80931:15:24:90:504:104:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:individuals  that  can  be  considered  having  a  bounded  rationality.31  As  a  result,
43:1137:81021:24:19:90:505:80:49:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:30That  is,  after  the  equalisation  of  retirement  ages  for  men  and  women  to  65
43:1138:81110:19:16:102:233:61:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:between 2010 and 2020.
43:1139:81132:16:0:90:286:45:49:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:31See, for example, Kahneman, 2003.
44:1140:81232:0:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:individuals change their behaviour infrequently and often use rules of thumb to
44:1141:81311:15:15:90:504:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:drive their behaviour. It is assumed that the adjustment of life expectancy is a gradual
44:1142:81399:15:25:90:311:685:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:process that will take ten years to complete.
44:1143:81444:25:15:90:504:660:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The available evidence clearly suggests that most individuals do underestimate their
44:1144:81528:15:15:90:504:645:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:life expectancy, but that this declines with age. As is clear from Figure 3.4, even
44:1145:81611:15:15:90:504:630:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:those close to retirement on average appear to underestimate their life expectancy
44:1146:81693:15:33:90:469:615:144:g_d0_f7:49:g_d0_f7:by more than three years, which makes our assumption a reasonable one.32

44:1150:81982:14:14:102:505:67:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:evidence from a National Statistics Omnibus survey, which confirms the findings
44:1151:82061:14:0:102:284:53:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:of O’Brien, Fenn and Diacon, 2005.
45:1152:82160:0:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Figure 3.5 shows the increase in the level of employment in the central scenario,
45:1153:82241:15:15:90:504:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:which leads to about 900,000 extra workers by 2050, equivalent to an increase of
45:1154:82321:15:15:90:505:685:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:2.7 per cent.33 The underlying increase in labour supply is the same one that was
45:1155:82402:15:15:90:504:670:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:used  for  the  central  scenario  in  the  previous  chapter;  however,  the  increase  in
45:1156:82493:15:15:90:504:655:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:percentage terms differs slightly as NiGEM has its own labour market baseline that
45:1157:82575:15:33:90:454:640:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:shows marginal differences compared to the baseline used in Chapter 2.

45:1159:82702:14:284:175:252:593:169:g_d0_f6:169:g_d0_f6:employment
45:1160:82712:284:15:90:504:309:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Figure 3.6 shows that extending working life has a substantial impact on economic
45:1161:82793:15:15:90:504:294:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:activity, particularly if we compare it to the effect of introducing personal accounts.
45:1162:82880:15:15:90:504:279:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:GDP roughly rises in line with the increase in labour supply. However, the increase is
45:1163:82966:15:15:90:504:264:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:not one-for-one, which has to do with the fact that the employment increase does
45:1164:83046:15:15:90:504:249:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:not take account of the effective hours worked. As it is assumed that the additional
45:1165:83130:15:77:90:504:234:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:workers  on  average  will  work  fewer  hours  than  the  rest  of  the  working  age
45:1166:83216:77:18:90:505:157:49:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:33The graph shows some slight variation in employment in the run-up to the first
45:1167:83296:18:14:102:505:139:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:change in State Pension age in 2026. This has to do with the extra savings that
45:1168:83375:14:15:102:505:125:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:result from individuals adjusting their life expectancy. A fall in consumption that
45:1169:83458:15:14:102:505:110:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:follows form a change in the perception of the length of life and a reorientation
45:1170:83539:14:15:102:504:96:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:of production to exports may cause a slight reduction in the level of demand and
45:1171:83619:15:14:102:505:81:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:employment  as  the  economy  adjusts.  The  more  forward  looking  the  wage
45:1172:83697:14:14:102:505:67:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:bargaining  process  is,  the  smaller  the  impact  on  output  will  be  when  savings
45:1173:83785:14:0:102:449:53:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:rise. See Barrell and Dury, 2003, for further discussion on this point.
46:1174:83921:0:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:population, the effect on GDP will be correspondingly smaller. In this scenario, it is
46:1175:84007:15:25:90:472:700:144:g_d0_f7:49:g_d0_f7:estimated that GDP will be 1.7 per cent higher than the base case in 2050.34
46:1176:84083:25:15:90:504:675:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The impact of 1.7 per cent is higher than the 1.4 per cent in the central scenario of
46:1177:84168:15:15:90:504:660:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the previous chapter. This is partly explained by the fact that we are now introducing
46:1178:84254:15:15:90:504:645:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the labour supply changes in a fully specified model that takes account of relevant
46:1179:84337:15:15:90:504:630:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:interactions of economic variables. However, one underlying assumption in NiGEM
46:1180:84416:15:15:90:504:615:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:is also a relevant driver behind the result: NiGEM assumes that all labour supply is
46:1181:84500:15:15:90:504:600:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:equally productive. In contrast, the previous chapter assumed that the additional
46:1182:84581:15:15:90:504:585:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:labour supply would earn lower wages – i.e. be less productive – than the rest of the
46:1183:84666:15:33:90:140:570:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:economy.
46:1184:84674:33:14:90:503:537:169:g_d0_f6:169:g_d0_f6:Figure 3.6Impact of longer working and adjusted life expectancy
46:1185:84737:14:395:175:299:523:169:g_d0_f6:169:g_d0_f6:on economic activity
46:1186:84757:395:18:90:505:128:49:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:34Older workers work fewer hours. This simulation used the same assumption on
46:1187:84834:18:14:102:505:110:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:hours worked as the previous chapter, 74 per cent. This implies that the effective
46:1188:84916:14:15:102:505:96:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:increase in employment was 2.0 per cent. The main reason the GDP impact of
46:1189:84990:15:14:102:505:81:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:1.7 per cent is slightly lower has to due with the fact that not all economy wide
46:1190:85071:14:14:102:505:67:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:investments tend to move in line with changes in employment (e.g. Government
46:1191:85147:14:0:102:165:53:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:investment).
47:1192:85224:0:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:It is interesting to note what happens with the savings rate. Figure 3.7 shows a
47:1193:85304:15:15:90:504:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:substantial increase in the savings rate. As a result of the adjustment of their life
47:1194:85389:15:15:90:504:685:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:expectancy, individuals realise they will have a longer retirement than previously
47:1195:85471:15:15:90:504:670:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:expected. If they do not adjust their behaviour, they will end up with lower incomes
47:1196:85555:15:15:90:504:655:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:in retirement than desired. As part of our simulation, we assume that people will
47:1197:85636:15:15:90:504:640:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:work longer to make up for this potential shortfall. The result of our modelling
47:1198:85716:15:15:90:504:625:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:exercise shows that the increase in the length of the average working life that we
47:1199:85798:15:15:90:504:610:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:have modelled is not sufficient to bring income in retirement up to the desired level,
47:1200:85884:15:25:90:403:595:144:g_d0_f7:49:g_d0_f7:but that savings during working life will be increased as well.35
47:1201:85949:25:15:90:504:570:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The increase in savings associated with the upward adjustment of life expectancy
47:1202:86029:15:15:90:504:555:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:explains why the increase in GNP (2.0 per cent) is higher than that of GDP (1.7 per
47:1203:86112:15:15:90:504:540:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:cent), as part of the savings will be invested abroad. However, the difference is
47:1204:86193:15:15:90:504:525:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:limited to 0.3 percentage point because there is also a higher domestic demand for
47:1205:86275:15:15:90:504:510:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:savings. This is the result of the increased labour supply, which in turn will lead to a
47:1206:86363:15:25:90:496:495:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:higher demand for capital as the extra labour supply is absorbed in the economy.
47:1207:86443:25:15:90:504:470:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:There is uncertainty about the size of the impact of increasing State Pension age on
47:1208:86527:15:15:90:504:455:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:labour supply and thus on the economy as a whole. We have, therefore, also done
47:1209:86606:15:15:90:504:440:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:simulations using a smaller and larger labour market impact36. For these simulations,
47:1210:86691:15:15:90:504:425:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:we have used the same assumptions as those of the previous chapter. In the ‘low
47:1211:86770:15:15:90:504:410:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:participation’ scenario this leads to about 0.3 million additional workers in 2050,
47:1212:86853:15:25:90:485:395:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:with the number for the ‘high participation’ scenario being around 1.6 million.
47:1213:86932:25:15:90:504:370:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The two scenarios show broadly the same pattern in employment, GDP and GNP.
47:1214:87007:15:15:90:504:355:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The main difference is that the savings rate in the ‘high’ scenario shows more of a
47:1215:87090:15:15:90:504:340:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:decline  towards  the  end  of  the  simulation  period.  This  is  due  to  the  ‘trade-off’
47:1216:87183:15:15:90:504:325:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:between  longer  working  and  higher  saving  as  a  means  to  increase  retirement
47:1217:87268:15:15:90:504:310:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:income; the high participation scenario implies that individuals have to save less to
47:1218:87353:15:15:90:504:295:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:reach  their  desired  replacement  rate  in  retirement.  As  a  result,  the  difference
47:1219:87443:15:15:90:504:280:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:between GDP and GNP is smaller in the high participation scenario. The GDP impact
47:1220:87524:15:15:90:504:265:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:in  2050  in  the  high  and  low  participation  scenario  is  2.9  and  0.4  per  cent
47:1221:87612:15:44:90:504:250:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:respectively. The corresponding GNP impacts are 3.1 and 0.9 per cent respectively.
47:1222:87694:44:18:90:505:206:49:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:35If forward looking individuals know that they will be working longer, but do not
47:1223:87776:18:15:102:504:188:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:expect to die any later then their need for savings to use in their (shorter) retirement
47:1224:87864:15:14:102:505:173:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:is reduced, and hence they may save less as soon as they decide to work longer.
47:1225:87943:14:14:102:505:159:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:This  may  indeed  be  why  US  citizens,  who  work  significantly  longer  than  UK
47:1226:88028:14:15:102:505:145:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:citizens, save less, as Sefton and Kirsanova, 2006, discuss. Given that the model
47:1227:88109:15:14:102:505:130:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:has  forward  looking  consumers,  without  modelling  an  adjustment  of  life
47:1228:88188:14:15:102:505:116:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:expectancy,  NiGEM  would  show  a  decrease  in  savings  as  a  result  of  imposed
47:1229:88273:15:14:102:505:101:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:longer working lives, as optimising agents that work longer would need to put
47:1230:88350:14:16:102:385:87:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:less money aside to get the same income in retirement.
47:1231:88404:16:18:90:505:71:49:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:36The change in the expected life expectancy – three years – remains the same for
47:1232:88485:18:0:102:167:53:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:all scenarios.

48:1236:88613:26:15:90:504:369:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:To assess how sensitive our results are to the modelling assumption of forward
48:1237:88691:15:15:90:504:354:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:looking economic agents, we have also run a number of scenarios with backward
48:1238:88768:15:15:90:504:339:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:looking consumers and backward looking financial, labour and investment markets.
48:1239:88848:15:15:90:504:324:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:If  only  consumers  are  backward  looking,  i.e.  they  act  as  if  they  are  completely
48:1240:88940:15:15:90:504:309:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:surprised by the changes in State Pension age, the GDP effects are very similar to
48:1241:89022:15:15:90:504:294:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:those shown above.37 If not only consumers, but also other economic agents behave
48:1242:89103:15:194:90:502:279:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:in a backward looking fashion, effects differ and are more cyclical (see Figure 3.8).
48:1243:89188:194:18:90:505:85:49:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:37However,  it  is  perhaps  difficult  to  imagine  a  scenario  in  which  individuals  are
48:1244:89281:18:14:102:505:67:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:completely surprised by the changes in State Pension age, whilst at the same
48:1245:89357:14:15:102:505:53:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:time we consider them ‘forward looking’ enough to adjust their life expectancy
48:1246:89435:15:0:102:205:38:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:and act accordingly.

49:1251:89692:26:15:90:504:340:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Our final scenario puts the two parts of the reform package together. Figures 3.9
49:1252:89773:15:15:90:504:325:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:and 3.10 show what happens to savings and economic activity if we assume that we
49:1253:89853:15:15:90:504:310:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:can add together the two policies described in the previous sections. This exercise
49:1254:89936:15:15:90:504:295:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:shows that personal savings rates would increase by about 1.5 percentage points,
49:1255:90016:15:15:90:504:280:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:roughly the same as the sum of the separate increases. This higher savings rate is
49:1256:90098:15:15:90:504:265:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:reflected in a higher GNP, which is 2.3 per cent higher than the base case in 2050. On
49:1257:90184:15:15:90:504:250:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the other hand, GDP and employment are roughly the same as in the scenarios
49:1258:90259:15:15:90:504:235:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:presented  in  the  section  on  longer  working,  as  the  introduction  of  personal
49:1259:90345:15:25:90:426:220:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:accounts is unlikely to have a substantial impact on these variables.
49:1260:90414:25:15:90:504:195:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:One can debate whether the impacts of personal accounts and extending working
49:1261:90491:15:15:90:504:180:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:life should be assessed jointly or not. Contrary to the simulations we have presented
49:1262:90576:15:15:90:504:165:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:here, personal accounts could be seen as the vehicle that people will use when they
49:1263:90659:15:15:90:504:150:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:adjust their savings as they become more aware of the fact that they will live much
49:1264:90742:15:15:90:504:135:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:longer than previously anticipated. This seems a realistic assumption, as personal
49:1265:90824:15:15:90:504:120:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:accounts are primarily set up to help those who are currently under-saving. The
49:1266:90903:15:15:90:504:105:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:reason for this under-saving is of secondary importance. It is likely that there are
49:1267:90987:15:15:90:504:90:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:multiple  reasons  for  this.  In  practice,  both  the  behavioural  barriers  that  were
49:1268:91077:15:15:90:504:75:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:mentioned in the paragraphs on personal accounts and the adjustment of expectations
49:1269:91160:15:15:90:504:60:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:that  were  modelled  in  the  sections  on  longer  working,  are  likely  to  be  relevant
49:1270:91252:15:0:90:504:45:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:factors. However, as the size of the savings increase in the longer working scenarios
50:1271:91402:0:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:is  already  much  larger  than  that  in  personal  accounts,  it  seems  unlikely  that  in
50:1272:91495:15:33:90:482:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:practice there will be a savings impact as large as the one shown in Figure 3.9.

51:1277:91852:273:25:91:223:429:256:g_d0_f7:256:g_d0_f7:3.11Conclusion
51:1278:91866:25:15:91:505:404:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:This chapter has assessed the macroeconomic impact of two major parts of the
51:1279:91942:15:15:91:505:389:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:reform, the introduction of personal accounts and increasing State Pension age
51:1280:92020:15:15:91:505:374:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:which  is  expected  to  extend  working  lives.  The  results  show  that  the  impact  of
51:1281:92111:15:15:91:505:359:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:personal  accounts  is  mainly  on  incomes  (as  reflected  in  GNP)  and  is  small  but
51:1282:92201:15:15:91:505:344:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:positive. In our central scenario, incomes are 0.2 per cent higher in the long-term.
51:1283:92285:15:15:91:505:329:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The impact of longer working is both on GDP and incomes and is estimated to be
51:1284:92363:15:15:91:505:314:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:substantially larger. In our central scenario, GDP increases by 1.7 per cent, with
51:1285:92445:15:25:91:267:299:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:incomes being 2.0 per cent higher.
51:1286:92479:25:15:91:505:274:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Both sets of simulations were subjected to alternative scenarios and sensitivities. The
51:1287:92566:15:15:91:505:259:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:alternative scenarios show a relatively wide range of possible impacts, but they all
51:1288:92650:15:15:91:505:244:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:remain  clearly  positive.  Our  sensitivity  analysis  has  mainly  focused  on  when
51:1289:92736:15:15:91:505:229:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:economic agents (i.e. consumers, businesses) incorporate knowledge of the new
51:1290:92813:15:15:91:505:214:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:policies into their behaviour. If economic agents act as if they have absolutely no
51:1291:92896:15:15:91:505:199:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:prior knowledge, the short-term effects tend to be amplified, though long-term
51:1292:92974:15:15:91:505:184:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:effects tend to be roughly the same as in the case when economic agents anticipate
51:1293:93056:15:25:91:176:169:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the new policies.
51:1294:93073:25:15:91:505:144:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The final section showed what would happen if the effects of the two sets of policies
51:1295:93158:15:15:91:505:129:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:were additive. It was argued that in practice this would not be wholly the case, as
51:1296:93241:15:15:91:505:114:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:personal accounts would likely be an important vehicle for the additional savings
51:1297:93322:15:0:91:489:99:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:that would result from individuals adjusting their life expectancy by three years.

52:1304:93658:25:15:90:504:369:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The introduction of personal accounts, automatic enrolment and minimum employer
52:1305:93737:15:15:90:504:354:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:contributions (as outlined in the Introduction) will have a significant impact on those
52:1306:93824:15:15:90:504:339:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:who are currently not saving for retirement, but who will be once the reforms are
52:1307:93905:15:15:90:504:324:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:introduced. This may be a self-evident fact; however the purpose of this chapter is to
52:1308:93991:15:15:90:504:309:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:focus on these people and explore a method which allows us to quantify the size of
52:1309:94073:15:25:90:395:294:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the social welfare gain produced by these particular reforms.
52:1310:94134:25:15:90:504:269:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:However, we do not estimate the social welfare impacts of longer working lives, as
52:1311:94216:15:15:90:504:254:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:this would require developing a model to take account of individual preferences
52:1312:94295:15:15:90:504:239:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:amongst those affected by the change. This would involve estimating the losses or
52:1313:94376:15:15:90:504:224:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:(non-financial) gains individuals derive directly from working. There is no consensus
52:1314:94461:15:15:90:504:209:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:as to the disutility of work and to create a model to estimate it would be beyond the
52:1315:94546:15:15:90:504:194:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:scope  of  this  paper.  Neither  do  we  estimate  the  welfare  impacts  of  the  overall
52:1316:94637:15:15:90:504:179:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:increases in the size of the economy as a result of the changes in State Pension age
52:1317:94721:15:15:90:504:164:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:and  increases  in  pension  saving.  The  reason  we  focus  on  the  introduction  of
52:1318:94808:15:15:90:504:149:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:personal accounts in this chapter is that it is a relatively simple example to use to
52:1319:94893:15:0:90:423:134:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:explore how social welfare impacts of reforms could be measured.
53:1320:95028:0:93:59:160:804:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:personal accounts
53:1321:95045:93:25:90:276:711:256:g_d0_f7:256:g_d0_f7:4.2Analytical framework
53:1322:95068:25:15:90:504:686:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Saving for retirement is central to the economic concept of consumption smoothing
53:1323:95149:15:15:90:504:671:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:and, therefore, to maximising wellbeing throughout life. Individuals have varying
53:1324:95230:15:15:90:504:656:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:levels  of  income  in  different  periods  of  their  life.  For  example,  the  majority  of
53:1325:95324:15:15:90:504:641:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:individuals in full-time education generally have low incomes and jobs earlier in life
53:1326:95410:15:15:90:504:626:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:are likely to generate smaller incomes than those later in someone’s career. Most
53:1327:95491:15:15:90:504:611:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:people’s  consumption,  however,  does  not  follow  this  income  pattern  exactly;
53:1328:95575:15:15:90:504:596:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:broadly speaking most individuals borrow when they are younger and on relatively
53:1329:95655:15:15:90:504:581:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:low incomes and save throughout their working life to ensure a higher standard of
53:1330:95736:15:15:90:504:566:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:living in retirement than that afforded by their State Pension entitlement only. This
53:1331:95821:15:15:90:504:551:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:concept  implies  that  there  is  a  benefit  in  transferring  income  from  periods  of

53:1337:96248:15:15:90:505:451:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f9:are both demand and supply problems. In Security in Retirement: towards a new
53:1338:96325:15:15:90:504:436:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f7:pension system38, the White Paper published in May 2006, it was estimated that at
53:1339:96406:15:15:90:504:421:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:least seven million people are under-saving for retirement. This means that their
53:1340:96487:15:15:90:504:406:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:current savings behaviour and wealth holdings are such that they are at risk of a
53:1341:96568:15:15:90:504:391:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:significant  fall  in  living  standards  at  retirement  and  they  are  not  smoothing
53:1342:96656:15:15:90:504:376:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:consumption in a way to maximise utility over their lifetimes. There are a number of
53:1343:96740:15:15:90:504:361:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:different reasons why demand and supply do not live up to the perfect economic
53:1344:96818:15:22:90:286:346:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:standard as set out in the introduction:
53:1345:96858:22:15:90:504:324:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:•  Informational problems: there is widespread evidence that people have only a
53:1346:96937:15:15:102:505:309:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:limited understanding of pension issues. For example, a survey carried out on
53:1347:97014:15:15:102:505:294:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:behalf of the Pensions Commission in 2005 found that 20 per cent of people
53:1348:97088:15:15:102:504:279:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:felt that they knew little or nothing about pension issues.39 On National Pensions

53:1350:97245:15:15:102:505:249:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the start of the debate only 13 per cent of participants agreed with the statement
53:1351:97327:15:15:102:505:234:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:‘I know a lot about pensions.’ Even if individuals did understand the basics, it is
53:1352:97410:15:15:102:505:219:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:highly complex to work out how much they should be saving in pensions, or
53:1353:97483:15:127:102:418:204:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:other products, or to make detailed asset allocation decisions.

54:1357:97674:89:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:•  Behavioural economics suggests that there are inherent barriers for individuals
54:1358:97756:15:15:102:505:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:to save optimally even if the informational barriers were overcome. Inertia and
54:1359:97835:15:15:102:505:685:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:procrastination mean that individuals, even when they understand pensions and
54:1360:97912:15:15:102:505:670:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:realise that they need to be saving, find it hard to begin to save. Myopia means
54:1361:97992:15:15:102:505:655:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:that people are short-sighted, and are unable to clearly see the needs of their
54:1362:98071:15:15:102:505:640:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:future  self.  Even  though  they  would  like  to  save,  current  spending  pressures
54:1363:98158:15:15:102:505:625:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:often seem more important than saving for the future. In economic terms, this
54:1364:98235:15:15:102:505:610:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:implies that individuals have higher discount rates of future benefits the closer
54:1365:98316:15:15:102:505:595:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:they get to the point of receiving the benefit (e.g. hyperbolic discount rates).
54:1366:98396:15:15:102:505:580:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Individuals also fail to review savings behaviour over time and fail to account for
54:1367:98479:15:15:102:505:565:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:changes in circumstances, such as increases in life expectancy, changes in rates
54:1368:98559:15:22:102:211:550:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:of return or earnings.
54:1369:98581:22:15:90:504:528:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:•  The  problems  on  the  demand  side  for  pensions  also  create  problems  on  the
54:1370:98668:15:15:102:505:513:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:supply  side.  Firstly,  the  tendency  of  individuals  to  underestimate  their  future
54:1371:98757:15:15:102:505:498:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:needs  as  well  as  to  delay  relatively  complex  decisions,  individuals  need  to  be
54:1372:98847:15:15:102:505:483:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:actively persuaded by providers of the need to have a pension on an individual
54:1373:98925:15:15:102:505:468:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:basis. This is particularly true when their employers are disengaged from pension
54:1374:99006:15:15:102:505:453:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:provision. Secondly the complexity of pension products means that individuals
54:1375:99083:15:15:102:505:438:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:need to be protected by regulation that prevents misselling of pensions. Both of
54:1376:99163:15:15:102:505:423:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:these issues make the process of selling a pension expensive which leads to high
54:1377:99243:15:15:102:505:408:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:annual  management  charges  to  recoup  the  costs  to  the  provider  of  selling  a
54:1378:99329:15:15:102:505:393:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:pension,  this  will  have  a  significant  impact  on  fund  growth.  This  problem  is
54:1379:99417:15:15:102:505:378:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:exacerbated when employers are small because providers find it more difficult to
54:1380:99497:15:26:102:243:363:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:achieve economies of scale.
54:1381:99524:26:15:90:504:337:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The proposed package of reforms aims to overcome these barriers and enable more
54:1382:99603:15:22:90:166:322:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:people to save.
54:1383:99618:22:15:90:504:300:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:•  The  minimum  employer  contribution  helps  people  to  see  saving  is  valuable,
54:1384:99704:15:15:102:505:285:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:overcoming the informational problems of working out whether to save. The
54:1385:99777:15:15:102:505:270:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:proposed  balance  of  contribution  rates  means  that  the  contribution  by  the
54:1386:99860:15:15:102:505:255:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:individual  is  effectively  matched  by  the  combination  of  the  tax  relief  and  the
54:1387:99950:15:15:102:505:240:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:employer contribution, thus increasing the value of saving. The analysis presented
54:1388:100032:15:15:102:504:225:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:in Financial  incentives  to  save  for  retirement40  shows  that  the  employer
54:1389:100113:15:15:102:505:210:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:contribution  and  tax  relief  tends  to  improve  the  incentives  for  individuals  to
54:1390:100202:15:15:102:505:195:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:save. As the incentive to save is increased, the participation rate in pensions also
54:1391:100286:15:15:102:505:180:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:increases.  Evidence  shows  that  the  existence  of  an  employer  contribution
54:1392:100367:15:15:102:504:165:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:significantly increases participation in an employer pension41. The existence of
54:1393:100447:15:15:102:505:150:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:an employer contribution is a clear signal to the individual that saving in a pension
54:1394:100532:15:58:102:505:135:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:is a good idea, which may overcome some of the behavioural barriers to saving.

55:1398:100750:89:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:•  Automatic  enrolment  into  a  pension  will  contribute  towards  overcoming  the
55:1399:100835:15:15:102:505:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:informational problem of working out in which product the individual should
55:1400:100910:15:15:102:505:685:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:save. It also tackles behavioural barriers, such as inertia, that currently prevent
55:1401:100993:15:15:102:505:670:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:individuals from saving, even when they recognise that it is in their interests to
55:1402:101075:15:15:102:505:655:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:do so. Evidence suggests that automatic enrolment is one of the most effective
55:1403:101153:15:15:102:504:640:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:ways of combating people’s tendency not to act when faced with difficult financial
55:1404:101235:15:15:102:505:625:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:decisions. It will play a key role in achieving high participation rates for personal
55:1405:101320:15:15:102:505:610:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:accounts and existing employer schemes. The Employers’ Pension Provision 2005
55:1406:101397:15:15:102:505:595:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:survey findings show a strong link between automatic enrolment and increased
55:1407:101473:15:15:102:505:580:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:levels  of  pension  scheme  membership.  Within  private  firms  with  20  or  more
55:1408:101557:15:15:102:505:565:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:employees,  the  proportion  of  employees  who  were  in  a  pension  averaged
55:1409:101636:15:15:102:505:550:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:60 per cent where the firm used automatic enrolment. This compared to 41 per
55:1410:101712:15:15:102:504:535:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:cent for traditional opt-in pension schemes.42 In case studies of four private sector
55:1411:101797:15:15:102:504:520:144:g_d0_f7:49:g_d0_f7:schemes, automatic enrolment was associated with increased participation rates.43
55:1412:101878:15:15:102:505:505:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:For example, in one firm the participation rate went from 25 per cent for existing
55:1413:101960:15:22:102:489:490:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:employees, to 80 per cent for new joiners who were automatically enrolled.
55:1414:102034:22:15:90:504:468:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:•  The design of the personal accounts scheme will tackle the causes of high charges
55:1415:102118:15:15:102:504:453:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:in personal pensions, by minimising the reasons for individuals to stop contributing
55:1416:102202:15:15:102:505:438:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:to  a  given  pension  fund  and  the  up-front  marketing  and  distribution  costs.
55:1417:102287:15:15:102:505:423:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Through automatic enrolment the need for up-front marketing costs is reduced.
55:1418:102364:15:15:102:505:408:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Furthermore  the  clearing-house  allows  individuals  to  contribute  to  the  same
55:1419:102448:15:15:102:505:393:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:fund  when  they  change  jobs,  which  significantly  reduces  the  cost  and  hence
55:1420:102533:15:15:102:504:378:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:allows a lower annual management charge. This reduction in the charges increases
55:1421:102613:15:15:102:505:363:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the  potential  retirement  income  for  an  individual  producing  a  real  efficiency
55:1422:102700:15:26:102:127:348:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:gain.
55:1423:102705:26:15:90:504:322:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:By tackling these inherent problems personal accounts should better enable many
55:1424:102784:15:15:90:504:307:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:individuals  to  save  for  retirement.  Improved  income  and  hence  consumption
55:1425:102866:15:15:90:504:292:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:smoothing should increase individual welfare. The approach taken in this piece of
55:1426:102947:15:15:90:504:277:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:work is to focus on the welfare impacts of improved consumption smoothing across
55:1427:103027:15:25:90:153:262:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the lifecycle.
55:1428:103041:25:15:90:504:237:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:It is possible to look at the benefits of saving in other ways, for example looking just
55:1429:103129:15:15:90:504:222:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:at the financial returns. Financial incentives to save for retirement44 focuses on the
55:1430:103215:15:15:90:504:207:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:financial rewards of saving, but does not account for the relative value of that saving.
55:1431:103303:15:38:90:504:192:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:There  are  also  other  potential  sources  of  welfare  gain  through  the  creation  of

55:1433:103475:18:14:102:505:136:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:opt-in mechanisms is larger when looking at the median level of membership
55:1434:103549:14:17:102:215:122:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:rather than the mean.

56:1440:103879:15:15:90:504:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:welfare gain is that individuals saving in personal accounts who would not have
56:1441:103958:15:15:90:504:685:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:saved  otherwise  may  have  increased  confidence  about  retirement  as  they  have
56:1442:104043:15:37:90:294:670:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:started to make provision for retirement.
56:1443:104084:37:26:90:224:633:256:g_d0_f7:256:g_d0_f7:4.3Methodology
56:1444:104098:26:15:90:504:607:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:As  explained  in  the  previous  section,  the  approach  taken  to  measure  the  social
56:1445:104188:15:15:90:504:592:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:welfare impact of personal accounts is to consider the value of improved consumption
56:1446:104272:15:15:90:504:577:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:smoothing. Consumption is the economic focus, rather than income smoothing,
56:1447:104347:15:15:90:504:562:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:because it is the actual consumption that is assumed to generate utility not the
56:1448:104427:15:15:90:504:547:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:receipt of income in its own right. However, as consumption is difficult to measure
56:1449:104510:15:15:90:504:532:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:it is assumed that income measures consumption opportunities. Therefore, social
56:1450:104589:15:25:90:420:517:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:welfare changes are measured in this paper by looking at income.
56:1451:104653:25:15:90:504:492:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The methodology employed is relatively simple in outline. It involves estimating the
56:1452:104737:15:15:90:504:477:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:value  of  income  smoothing  for  the  individual  and  aggregating  this  up  to  the
56:1453:104824:15:15:90:504:462:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:population for a given year and then adding together the results over time (we are
56:1454:104906:15:15:90:504:447:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:looking at the period from the introduction of personal accounts in 2012 to 2050).
56:1455:104988:15:15:90:504:432:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The approach taken involves many simplifications and particular assumptions which
56:1456:105069:15:15:90:504:417:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:could have an impact on the results. However, as this paper is an exploration of how
56:1457:105153:15:15:90:504:402:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the welfare impacts could be assessed, using a simplified model allows the most
56:1458:105232:15:25:90:268:387:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:important factors to be considered.
56:1459:105267:25:22:90:187:362:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Outline of method:
56:1460:105285:22:22:90:404:340:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:1.    Divide population into groups based on income and age.
56:1461:105345:22:15:90:504:318:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:2.    Estimate the weighted NPV of the utility an individual derived from saving in
56:1462:105428:15:23:113:451:303:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:personal accounts, for representative individuals from each group.
56:1463:105494:23:15:90:504:280:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:3.    Aggregate NPV of saving to the number of people saving in personal accounts
56:1464:105575:15:15:113:504:265:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:in each given year (making an allowance for the proportions of saving that are
56:1465:105653:15:22:113:368:250:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:new and that are transferred from other vehicles).
56:1466:105703:22:15:90:504:228:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:4.    Estimate NPV of the gain over time by in turn discounting NPV for each year
56:1467:105784:15:25:113:376:213:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:and aggregating over the time period (2012-2050).
56:1468:105833:25:15:90:504:188:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f7:(1) Segmenting the population: The impact of personal accounts and the default
56:1469:105911:15:15:90:504:173:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:contribution level will differ depending on individual characteristics, most importantly
56:1470:105999:15:15:90:504:158:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:age and income level. This is firstly because the income that individuals will receive in
56:1471:106088:15:15:90:504:143:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:retirement from the state will vary over time as the State Pension system evolves.
56:1472:106170:15:15:90:504:128:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Secondly, the income an individual can receive from personal accounts will depend
56:1473:106251:15:15:90:504:113:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:on the length of time they save into personal accounts. To enable these aspects to be
56:1474:106336:15:15:90:504:98:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:captured we have split the population into a number of income groups and age
56:1475:106412:15:0:90:129:83:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:groups.
56:1476:106488:0:89:435:536:804:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:personal accounts
57:1477:106507:89:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:(2) Estimating the weighted NPV of the utility an individual derived from
57:1478:106580:15:15:90:505:700:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f7:saving  in  personal  accounts:  The  costs  of  pension  saving  occurs  significantly
57:1479:106667:15:15:90:504:685:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:before  the  benefits  are  realised  by  the  individual,  therefore,  we  need  to  use  a
57:1480:106759:15:15:90:504:670:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:technique to value costs and benefits that fall in different time periods. The NPV is
57:1481:106844:15:15:90:504:655:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:calculated by discounting future benefits and costs using an appropriate rate, and
57:1482:106926:15:15:90:504:640:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:subtracting  the  total  of  discounted  costs  from  the  total  of  discounted  benefits.
57:1483:107017:15:15:90:504:625:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Discounting takes into account the delay faced by the individual in receiving an
57:1484:107097:15:15:90:504:610:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:income stream, in this case the pension. The discount rate can include a variety of
57:1485:107180:15:15:90:504:595:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:different factors, such as the rate of time preference (which measures the desire to
57:1486:107264:15:15:90:504:580:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:consume now rather than in the future), the uncertainty of the income stream and
57:1487:107344:15:25:90:461:565:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the interest rate that could have been achieved on any investment option.
57:1488:107417:25:15:90:504:540:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:To estimate the value of the consumption smoothing across the lifecycle we attach
57:1489:107498:15:15:90:504:525:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:weights to different levels of consumption. In doing this we have taken a deliberately
57:1490:107584:15:15:90:504:510:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:simple approach. Instead of using an inter-temporal consumption function which
57:1491:107662:15:15:90:504:495:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:allows for the optimisation of consumption over time taking into account income,
57:1492:107742:15:15:90:504:480:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the rate of time preference, interest rates and so on, we have adopted a simple
57:1493:107821:15:15:90:504:465:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:approach drawing on the Green Book45. This simplified approach follows the Green
57:1494:107901:15:15:90:504:450:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Book’s approach to measuring the value of redistribution. This approach is based on
57:1495:107984:15:15:90:504:435:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the relative income levels of the individuals whose income is being redistributed. The
57:1496:108070:15:15:90:504:420:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:central assumption is the existence of diminishing marginal utility of consumption,
57:1497:108153:15:15:90:504:405:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:which  means  that  an  additional  £1  of  consumption  is  valued  less  as  income
57:1498:108238:15:15:90:504:390:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:increases. This assumption implies that individuals with different income levels will
57:1499:108323:15:15:90:504:375:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:have different levels of (marginal) utility. We have adapted this approach to examine
57:1500:108408:15:15:90:504:360:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the impact of redistributing income across the lifetime, in which the welfare impact
57:1501:108492:15:15:90:504:345:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:of saving is the value of the redistribution of income between the different time
57:1502:108573:15:25:90:138:330:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:periods46.
57:1503:108583:25:25:90:426:305:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The Green Book adopts a simple functional form to describe utility:
57:1504:108650:25:25:147:281:280:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Utility = log (consumption)
57:1505:108677:25:15:90:504:255:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:which means that the marginal utility of consumption is equal to the inverse of
57:1506:108756:15:25:90:177:240:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:consumption, or:
57:1507:108772:25:24:147:218:215:144:g_d0_f11:144:g_d0_f7:δU(c)/δc = 1/c,
57:1508:108787:24:57:90:444:191:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:so if consumption halves, the marginal utility of consumption doubles.

57:1510:108877:20:18:90:505:114:49:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:46An  underlying  simplifying  assumption  is  that  individuals  have  the  same  utility
57:1511:108967:18:15:102:505:96:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:function throughout their lifetime. We are not exploring redistribution between
57:1512:109046:15:14:102:505:81:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:individuals because this is not a major feature of personal accounts. An alternative
57:1513:109130:14:14:102:505:67:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:would  be  to  use  an  intertemporal  utility  function,  however,  the  Green  Book
57:1514:109215:14:0:102:454:53:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:framework adopted here would not be feasible under this approach.
57:1515:109349:0:89:59:160:804:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:personal accounts
58:1516:109368:89:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Thus to take a pension example, an individual, who earns £20,000 while working,
58:1517:109447:15:15:90:504:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:receives £10,000 in State Pensions. He/she contributes £1,000 to a private pension
58:1518:109529:15:25:90:285:685:144:g_d0_f7:49:g_d0_f7:which pays out £1,000 in retirement.47
58:1519:109567:25:25:147:458:660:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:utility gained = pension/retirement income = £1,000/£10,000
58:1520:109626:25:25:147:481:635:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:utility foregone = contribution/working income = £1,000/£20,000
58:1521:109689:25:25:90:357:610:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Net change in utility = utility gained – utility foregone
58:1522:109746:25:25:147:238:585:144:g_d0_f7:49:g_d0_f7:= 1,000/20,000 48
58:1523:109763:25:15:90:504:560:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Multiplying  this  abstract  gain  of  1,000/20,000  units  of  utility  with  working  life
58:1524:109855:15:24:90:301:545:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:income, we arrive at a net gain of £1,000.
58:1525:109897:24:15:90:504:521:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Although  individuals  seek  to  smooth  their  income  into  retirement,  evidence
58:1526:109980:15:15:90:504:506:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:suggests that unconstrained individuals do not seek to fully replace their in-work
58:1527:110062:15:15:90:504:491:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:income, and that gross replacement rates, the ratio of retirement income to in-work
58:1528:110145:15:15:90:504:476:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:income, of less than 100 per cent will deliver the same living standards in retirement
58:1529:110231:15:15:90:504:461:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:as they do in working life. This is due to the fact that individuals often face lower
58:1530:110316:15:15:90:504:446:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:expenditure in retirement, for example, because they no longer face work related
58:1531:110396:15:15:90:504:431:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:costs, they may have paid off their mortgage, they no longer have to pay pension or
58:1532:110479:15:15:90:504:416:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:national  insurance  contributions,  or  indeed  because  some  of  the  consumption
58:1533:110563:15:15:90:504:401:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:during their working lives is now compensated for by more State Pension age time.
58:1534:110644:15:15:90:504:386:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:We  have,  therefore,  adapted  the  weighting  approach  to  take  into  account  the
58:1535:110730:15:15:90:504:371:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:benchmark  replacement  rates  used  by  the  Pensions  Commission,  which  was
58:1536:110809:15:15:90:504:356:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:confirmed through a later survey which asked individuals about their desired income

58:1538:110973:15:15:90:504:326:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:according to income as it is assumed that individuals with higher earnings do not
58:1539:111054:15:200:90:501:311:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:need to replace as much income in retirement to maintain their standard of living.
58:1540:111136:200:18:90:505:111:49:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:47This example is simplified, so the impact of tax relief and investment growth is

59:1549:111671:15:15:90:504:392:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:closer to their target level of provision. The benchmark replacement rate for the
59:1550:111752:15:15:90:504:377:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:median earner according to the Pensions Commission is 67 per cent. To adapt the
59:1551:111831:15:15:90:504:362:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:marginal utility of consumption equation to account for individuals not wanting 100
59:1552:111914:15:15:90:504:347:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:per cent replacement rate we create a weighting function based on how close the
59:1553:111993:15:15:90:504:332:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:individual is to the benchmark replacement rate. The closer someone gets to the
59:1554:112072:15:15:90:504:317:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:benchmark  replacement  rate  the  smaller  the  weighting.  The  replacement  rate
59:1555:112155:15:15:90:504:302:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:measures income, but this is assumed to act as a proxy for levels of consumption
59:1556:112235:15:15:90:504:287:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:both in work and in retirement as consumption opportunities are based on income
59:1557:112314:15:15:90:504:272:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:over  an  individual’s  lifetime.  The  weighting  function,  W,  is  estimated  using  the
59:1558:112405:15:25:90:194:257:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:following equations:
59:1559:112425:25:15:90:435:232:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:W=  Benchmark consumption *(1/consumption in retirement)
59:1560:112481:15:15:133:464:217:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:=  Benchmark replacement rate * (1/achieved replacement rate in
59:1561:112544:15:15:147:203:202:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:retirement)
59:1562:112555:15:15:133:293:187:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:=Benchmark replacement rate
59:1563:112582:15:25:147:282:172:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Achieved replacement rate
59:1564:112607:25:15:90:504:147:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Therefore, if an individual were seeking to fully replace their income, the value of
59:1565:112691:15:15:90:504:132:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:redistributing  income  from  working  life  to  retirement  would  be  identical  to  the
59:1566:112781:15:15:90:504:117:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:original unweighted formula above. However, if the benchmark replacement rate is
59:1567:112861:15:15:90:504:102:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:less than full replacement of income, then the weight applied to the consumption
59:1568:112941:15:25:90:227:87:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:function will adjust for this.
59:1569:112971:25:15:90:504:62:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Table 4.1 sets out the range of weightings used for this analysis based on someone
59:1570:113053:15:15:90:504:47:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:with earnings just above the median. The high weighting is based on the replacement
59:1571:113136:15:0:90:504:32:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:rate  achieved  from  state  provision  alone.  The  first  pound  of  saving,  therefore,
59:1572:113295:0:89:59:160:804:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:personal accounts
60:1573:113314:89:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:increases  people’s  replacement  rate  from  this  point  and,  therefore,  is  the  most
60:1574:113404:15:15:90:504:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:valuable  slice  of  redistribution  given  our  assumed  shape  of  the  consumption
60:1575:113489:15:15:90:504:685:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:function. The low weighting is based on the replacement rate the median earner
60:1576:113567:15:15:90:504:670:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:would achieve if they saved in personal accounts at the minimum level throughout
60:1577:113647:15:15:90:504:655:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:working life.50 This approach measures the value of the final £1 put into personal
60:1578:113729:15:15:90:504:640:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:accounts, which is the least valuable slice of redistribution. The central assumption is
60:1579:113817:15:15:90:504:625:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the average of these two and can be seen as the weighting on the average pound
60:1580:113895:15:33:90:260:610:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:contributed to personal accounts.

60:1592:114526:25:15:90:504:372:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The next step in estimating the weighted NPV of pension saving is to estimate the
60:1593:114607:15:15:90:504:357:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:income stream produced by pension saving. This is estimated by calculating the
60:1594:114685:15:15:90:504:342:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:pension pot that an individual can accumulate over time from saving £1 in personal
60:1595:114767:15:15:90:504:327:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:accounts.  When  the  person  reaches  State  Pension  age,  it  is  assumed  that  they
60:1596:114855:15:15:90:504:312:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:annuitise this income which then produces a guaranteed income for each year of
60:1597:114933:15:15:90:504:297:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:their  retirement.  Then,  to  estimate  the  weighted  NPV  the  annuity  income  is
60:1598:115018:15:15:90:504:282:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:weighted by the appropriate factor and then discounted to account for the delay in
60:1599:115100:15:25:90:244:267:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:receiving this income stream52.

60:1602:115298:15:29:90:504:212:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:estimate  that  there  is  a  positive  value  to  this  transfer  of  saving,  because  if  an
60:1603:115393:29:18:90:505:183:49:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:50In this model we have simplified the contribution rate to be eight per cent for
60:1604:115474:18:15:102:505:165:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the  individual,  which  takes  into  account  the  individual’s  and  the  employer’s
60:1605:115560:15:14:102:505:150:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:contributions as well as tax relief. Our model does not consider possible second-

60:1607:115726:14:15:102:505:122:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:costs through wages or prices, which would change the impact on the gains to

61:1618:116593:15:15:90:504:655:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:and the gain from switching is the difference between the weighted NPV for other

61:1623:116971:15:15:90:504:570:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:no welfare gain for saving in a personal account; this is because we conservatively
61:1624:117054:15:15:90:504:555:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:assume that the discount rate applied to future income is greater than the net return

61:1637:117795:12:12:90:493:326:100:g_d0_f7:100:g_d0_f7:assumes that all contributions (eight per cent) are made by individuals. If this was calculated on
61:1638:117893:12:12:90:496:314:100:g_d0_f7:100:g_d0_f7:the share of contributions actually made by individuals (four per cent) this would be significantly

61:1642:118161:15:15:90:504:244:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Therefore, to estimate the social welfare gain we have to aggregate the individual
61:1643:118243:15:15:90:504:229:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:utility functions. Thus the approach is to aggregate the estimated weighted NPV for
61:1644:118326:15:15:90:504:214:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:each sub group weighted by the relative size of the group. This is based on estimates
61:1645:118411:15:25:90:440:199:144:g_d0_f7:49:g_d0_f7:by the DWP of the group likely to be in personal accounts over time.53

61:1647:118565:15:15:90:504:159:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Therefore, to be able to add each group together, we estimate the total contribution

61:1650:118812:15:58:90:471:114:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:multiplied by the weighted NPV of that group for that year of contributions.

62:1657:119323:15:15:90:504:655:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:accounts  will  be  new  saving.54  Therefore,  in  aggregating  the  results  we  have
62:1658:119410:15:15:90:504:640:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:assumed that a proportion (60 per cent) of the contributions made by each sub-
62:1659:119488:15:15:90:504:625:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:group each year is new saving, and has the weighted NPV of personal accounts
62:1660:119564:15:15:90:504:610:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:applied  to  the  contributions.  The  rest  of  the  saving  is  switched  saving,  so  that
62:1661:119657:15:15:90:504:595:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:proportion  of  contributions  (40  per  cent)  is  multiplied  by  the  weighted  NPV  of
62:1662:119747:15:25:90:173:580:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:switched saving.

62:1664:119839:15:15:90:504:540:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:each year has been calculated, as set out above, this can be used to estimate the
62:1665:119920:15:15:90:504:525:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:social  welfare  impact  over  time.  This  is  estimated  by  taking  the  estimate  of  the
62:1666:120013:15:15:90:504:510:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:benefit of contributions in each year and calculating the net present value of this
62:1667:120096:15:15:90:504:495:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:series. This has to be a discounted sum of the individual years’ benefits, because the
62:1668:120182:15:15:90:504:480:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:in-year estimate is estimating the value of the contributions in that year, and then we
62:1669:120269:15:15:90:504:465:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:need to discount that back to today to estimate the value of the increase in wellbeing
62:1670:120355:15:37:90:407:450:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:resulting from the introduction of personal accounts over time.
62:1671:120418:37:26:90:429:413:256:g_d0_f7:256:g_d0_f7:4.4Limitations and weaknesses in methodology
62:1672:120462:26:15:90:504:387:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:This approach and method to estimate the welfare gain from personal accounts is
62:1673:120541:15:15:90:504:372:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:simplified as it is an exploration of how the welfare impacts of personal accounts
62:1674:120623:15:15:90:504:357:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:could be estimated. There are a number of things that have been excluded from the
62:1675:120704:15:25:90:304:342:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:analysis which could impact on the results.
62:1676:120747:25:15:90:504:317:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The model is only including the impact of contributions made between 2012 and
62:1677:120824:15:15:90:504:302:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:2050. It is likely that the impact of personal accounts on savings behaviour will
62:1678:120905:15:15:90:504:287:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:continue past this point, therefore, the welfare impact will continue over time, and
62:1679:120989:15:25:90:228:272:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:potentially increase further.
62:1680:121018:25:15:90:504:247:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The analysis of what income individuals receive in retirement is based on constant
62:1681:121100:15:15:90:504:232:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:earnings profiles and there is no account taken of household size neither during
62:1682:121180:15:25:90:333:217:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:individuals’ working lives nor in their retirement.
62:1683:121231:25:15:90:504:192:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:This means that in retirement individuals’ welfare position is based only on their own
62:1684:121317:15:15:90:504:177:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:earnings  and  contributions  history,  not  on  the  position  of  their  household.  The
62:1685:121407:15:15:90:504:162:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:simplified consumption function does not account for whether individuals would
62:1686:121485:15:15:90:504:147:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:choose to save in a different pattern depending on their household size (such as
62:1687:121565:15:15:90:504:132:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:saving very little when they have young children and then saving more when the
62:1688:121643:15:61:90:198:117:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:children leave home).

63:1691:121771:89:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:However, in using an individual basis to consider savings decisions we are following
63:1692:121855:15:15:90:504:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the treatment by Kirsavnova and Sefton, (2006), which was informed by empirical
63:1693:121934:15:15:90:504:685:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:work showing that lifecycle savings patterns could be identified at the individual but
63:1694:122020:15:25:90:200:670:144:g_d0_f7:49:g_d0_f7:not household level.55
63:1695:122042:25:15:90:504:645:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:As mentioned above, our analysis uses a simple earnings function in which each
63:1696:122120:15:15:90:504:630:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:individual has constant earnings in earnings terms throughout their working life.
63:1697:122201:15:15:90:504:615:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The value of saving is measured relative to a replacement rate target and an estimate
63:1698:122286:15:15:90:504:600:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:of  State  Pension  entitlement  which  assumes  constant  earnings  over  time.  If
63:1699:122370:15:15:90:504:585:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:individuals benefit from earnings which vary in earnings terms over time, the value of
63:1700:122456:15:15:90:504:570:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:redistribution over their lifetime will have a different pattern. However, if individuals
63:1701:122545:15:15:90:504:555:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:retirement aspirations are based on their income towards the end of their working
63:1702:122626:15:15:90:504:540:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:life, the value of redistributing income from working life to retirement is likely to be
63:1703:122714:15:15:90:504:525:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:higher, which means the welfare gain could be larger. To fully account for this the
63:1704:122797:15:15:90:504:510:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:model would have to allow individuals to defer saving to later in working life when
63:1705:122880:15:15:90:504:495:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:their income is higher once discount rates and investment returns are taken into
63:1706:122960:15:25:90:412:480:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:account, which was beyond the scope of this exploratory paper.
63:1707:123022:25:15:90:504:455:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The log utility function as adopted by the Green Book has been chosen to be in line
63:1708:123105:15:15:90:504:440:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:with Government best practice in evaluating policy options, but is also supported by
63:1709:123189:15:15:90:504:425:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:a wide range of academic research and avoids having to make more assumptions
63:1710:123265:15:15:90:504:410:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:about parameters than is strictly necessary. This is a simplification, but it is precisely
63:1711:123355:15:15:90:504:395:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:for this reason that log utility is agreed in academic circles to be extremely useful for
63:1712:123444:15:15:90:504:380:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:modelling purposes.56 One assumption within the log utility function is that there is
63:1713:123529:15:15:90:504:365:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:no accounting for risk aversion. This means that the variation in investment returns
63:1714:123613:15:15:90:504:350:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:and the impact this could have on individuals, in affecting their final income, but also
63:1715:123701:15:15:90:504:335:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:in  creating  uncertainty  about  retirement  income  during  working  life  has  been
63:1716:123787:15:15:90:504:320:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:excluded. If the variation in investment returns was considerable, then this could
63:1717:123869:15:15:90:504:305:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:reduce any aggregate welfare benefit. However, if higher estimates of risk aversion
63:1718:123952:15:15:90:504:290:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:were included, this would increase the value of redistributing income to retirement
63:1719:124035:15:25:90:275:275:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:to avoid large drops in consumption.
63:1720:124071:25:15:90:504:250:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:In addition to these limitations of the adopted model, potential second best effects
63:1721:124155:15:15:90:504:235:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:on other related potentially distorted markets have not been quantified but we do
63:1722:124236:15:15:90:504:220:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:not expect them to be large. We have identified two markets which may both be
63:1723:124313:15:15:90:504:205:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:distorted  and  be  affected  by  the  introduction  of  personal  accounts:  the  labour
63:1724:124402:15:113:90:388:190:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:market for older workers and the market for personal debt.

63:1726:124490:21:0:90:264:56:49:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:56See, for example, Romer, 2001.

64:1728:124610:89:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:•  An alternative to saving more for retirement is to work for longer, and, as the
64:1729:124692:15:15:102:505:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:White Paper identifies, the labour market for older workers is currently distorted
64:1730:124774:15:15:102:505:685:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:and  older  workers  may  find  it  difficult  to  find  jobs  which  are  flexible  to  their
64:1731:124868:15:15:102:505:670:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:requirements. Therefore, the introduction of personal accounts, which will enable
64:1732:124949:15:15:102:505:655:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:more people to save more for retirement, may mean that the distortions of the
64:1733:125026:15:15:102:505:640:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:labour market become less significant to individuals, which will improve welfare.
64:1734:125107:15:15:102:505:625:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:However, the magnitude of this benefit is not possible to measure and would in
64:1735:125185:15:15:102:505:610:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:any event be reduced by policies on extending working life in the White Paper
64:1736:125262:15:15:102:505:595:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:since they should improve the efficiency of the labour market. Chapter 2 sets

64:1741:125583:15:15:102:505:513:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:consumption,  and  there  are  worries  that  the  market  for  short-term  debt  is
64:1742:125667:15:15:102:505:498:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:distorted by excessive marketing and some of the same behavioural economics
64:1743:125742:15:15:102:505:483:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:issues that impact on long-term saving. The introduction of automatic enrolment
64:1744:125821:15:15:102:505:468:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:is  intended  to  lead  to  more  individuals  saving  for  retirement,  but  it  may  also
64:1745:125912:15:15:102:505:453:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:encourage  some  individuals  to  take  out  short-term  loans  to  finance  current
64:1746:125996:15:15:102:505:438:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:consumption. This may then lead to a further distortion to individuals’ portfolios
64:1747:126078:15:15:102:505:423:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:as they find themselves with significant short-term debt and inaccessible long-
64:1748:126157:15:15:102:505:408:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:term savings with a lower rate of return, which reduces the welfare gains from
64:1749:126235:15:15:102:505:393:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:personal accounts. We believe that many people with expensive debts will opt
64:1750:126311:15:15:102:505:378:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:out of personal accounts (partly as a result of information products specifically
64:1751:126392:15:26:102:381:363:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:targeted at this group), and that the cost will be small.

65:1791:128708:15:15:90:504:215:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:used places a low value on redistribution of income over the lifetime, even the simple
65:1792:128794:15:15:90:504:200:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:method set out above produces an estimate of a welfare gain equivalent to £30

66:1805:129645:25:15:90:504:586:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:It is likely that the discount rate and the rate of return over time move in line, if there
66:1806:129736:15:15:90:504:571:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:is a significant difference between the discount rate and the rate of return then the
66:1807:129821:15:15:90:504:556:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:rate of return will change over time in response to the level of available capital. Table
66:1808:129910:15:15:90:504:541:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:2.3 sets out the impact of the discount rate and rate of return jointly varying while
66:1809:129995:15:15:90:504:526:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:holding the other assumptions constant. Reducing the discount rate and rate of
66:1810:130073:15:15:90:504:511:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:return increases the social welfare gain, because the impact of the discount rate
66:1811:130154:15:15:90:504:496:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:dominates. The lower discount rate significantly increases the benefits as individuals
66:1812:130240:15:33:90:324:481:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:become more willing to wait for consumption.

66:1819:130463:33:15:90:504:325:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:By varying replacement rates we change the weighting applied, which measure the
66:1820:130542:15:15:90:504:310:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:value  of  redistribution.  In  the  high  case,  benchmark  replacement  rates  are  ten

66:1824:130882:15:15:90:504:250:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:because although the weighted NPV of saving in personal accounts increases, the

66:1826:131039:15:15:90:504:220:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:because  the  value  of  switching  is  the  difference  between  the  weighted  NPV  of

67:1850:132210:15:15:90:504:432:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:smoothing across the lifecycle is substantial and positive. This estimate is subject to

68:1875:134158:15:15:90:504:228:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:analysed. Finally, an innovative method to estimate the social welfare impacts of
68:1876:134239:15:24:90:263:213:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:personal accounts was developed.
68:1877:134271:24:15:90:504:189:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:In measuring the economic impacts, two measures of the size of the economy were
68:1878:134350:15:15:90:504:174:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:used. Firstly, gross domestic product (GDP), which is a measure of the total value of
68:1879:134435:15:15:90:504:159:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:final goods and services produced within a country’s borders in a year. Secondly,
68:1880:134516:15:15:90:504:144:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:gross national product (GNP) which is the value of all goods and services produced
68:1881:134598:15:15:90:504:129:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:in a country in one year, plus income earned by its residents abroad, minus income
68:1882:134680:15:25:90:218:114:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:payable to non-residents.
68:1883:134705:25:15:90:504:89:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Chapter  2  used  a  simple  microeconomic  approach  to  estimate  the  impact  of
68:1884:134788:15:15:90:504:74:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:increasing  State  Pension  age.  The  analysis  suggests  that  the  changes  to  State
68:1885:134876:15:15:90:504:59:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Pension age and the associated polices to extend working lives will have a positive
68:1886:134959:15:0:90:504:44:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:economic impact through additional labour supplied by older workers. In the central
69:1887:135054:0:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:scenario, this would increase GDP by around 1.4 per cent. The chapter presents a
69:1888:135134:15:15:90:504:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:range of results to reflect the uncertainty surrounding the employment response. In
69:1889:135217:15:15:90:504:685:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the  analysis,  the  uncertainty  surrounding  future  trends  in  the  earnings  of  older
69:1890:135308:15:15:90:504:670:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:workers is also discussed and sensitivity analysis shows to what extent different
69:1891:135389:15:25:90:413:655:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:assumptions on earnings profiles would lead to different results.
69:1892:135454:25:15:90:504:630:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The subsequent chapter used a dynamic general equilibrium model to assess the
69:1893:135531:15:15:90:504:615:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:macroeconomic impact of increasing State Pension age as well as the introduction
69:1894:135611:15:15:90:504:600:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:of  personal  accounts.  The  results  show  that  the  impact  of  personal  accounts  is
69:1895:135701:15:15:90:504:585:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:mainly on incomes (as reflected in GNP) and is small but positive. In our central
69:1896:135782:15:15:90:504:570:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:scenario, incomes are 0.2 per cent higher in the long term. The impact of longer
69:1897:135862:15:15:90:504:555:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:working is both on GDP and incomes and is estimated to be substantially larger. In
69:1898:135944:15:15:90:504:540:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:our central scenario, GDP increases by 1.7 per cent, with incomes being 2.0 per cent
69:1899:136028:15:25:90:126:525:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:higher.
69:1900:136035:25:15:90:504:500:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Both sets of simulations were subjected to alternative scenarios and sensitivities. The
69:1901:136122:15:15:90:504:485:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:alternative scenarios show a relatively wide range of possible impacts, but they all
69:1902:136206:15:15:90:504:470:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:remain  clearly  positive.  Our  sensitivity  analysis  has  mainly  focussed  on  when
69:1903:136293:15:15:90:504:455:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:economic agents (i.e. consumers, businesses) incorporate knowledge of the new
69:1904:136370:15:15:90:504:440:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:policies into their behaviour. If economic agents act as if they have absolutely no
69:1905:136453:15:15:90:504:425:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:prior knowledge, the short-term effects tend to be amplified, though long-term
69:1906:136531:15:15:90:504:410:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:effects tend to be roughly the same as in the case when economic agents anticipate
69:1907:136613:15:25:90:175:395:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the new policies.
69:1908:136630:25:15:90:504:370:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The final section showed what would happen if the effects of the two sets of policies
69:1909:136715:15:15:90:504:355:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:were additive. It was argued that in practice this would not be wholly the case, as
69:1910:136798:15:15:90:504:340:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:personal accounts would likely be an important vehicle for the additional savings
69:1911:136879:15:15:90:504:325:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:that would result from individuals adjusting their life expectancy by three years. The
69:1912:136965:15:15:90:504:310:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:overall impact of changes to State Pension age and the introduction of personal
69:1913:137044:15:15:90:504:295:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:accounts on UK incomes is likely to be in the range of 0.9-3.1 per cent. In terms of
69:1914:137128:15:25:90:395:280:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:today’s economy, this is equivalent to around £11-38 billion.
69:1915:137189:25:15:90:504:255:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The  fourth  and  final  chapter  developed  a  methodology  to  estimate  the  social
69:1916:137275:15:15:90:504:240:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:welfare benefit of introducing personal accounts by aggregating the welfare of all
69:1917:137357:15:15:90:504:225:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:individuals in society. The results suggest that a conservative estimate of the social
69:1918:137443:15:15:90:504:210:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:welfare gain associated with the introduction of personal accounts - which enables
69:1919:137525:15:25:90:484:195:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:better consumption smoothing across the lifecycle - is substantial and positive.
69:1920:137605:25:15:90:504:170:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The estimates of the different impact presented in this paper should not be taken as
69:1921:137689:15:15:90:504:155:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:definitive; if different methods were adopted it would be possible for a different
69:1922:137771:15:15:90:504:140:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:range of results to be produced. The methodological approaches developed in this
69:1923:137851:15:15:90:504:125:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:paper are innovative and, as the nature of this paper should be seen as consultative,
69:1924:137936:15:0:90:339:110:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:we welcome other views on the issues presented.

70:1928:138084:39:15:90:504:446:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:For the scenarios we analyse here, the description within NiGEM of household sector
70:1929:138167:15:15:90:504:431:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:savings and of national savings and investment deserves some comment. Households
70:1930:138247:15:15:90:504:416:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:receive  income  from  employment,  transfer  income  from  the  public  sector,  and
70:1931:138332:15:15:90:504:401:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:income from households’ net financial assets. Households’ financial assets include
70:1932:138414:15:15:90:504:386:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:assets held overseas, government debt, deposits held in monetary institutions and
70:1933:138495:15:15:90:504:371:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:equity holdings. Of that income households pay tax, consume and save. In the long
70:1934:138576:15:15:90:504:356:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:run the household savings ratio, i.e. the share of households’ disposable income
70:1935:138656:15:15:90:504:341:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:that is not consumed, is determined by the ratio of household wealth to income.
70:1936:138735:15:15:90:504:326:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Household wealth includes financial assets less financial liabilities, the majority of
70:1937:138821:15:15:90:504:311:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:which is mortgage debt, and housing wealth. In the short run the savings ratio is
70:1938:138902:15:15:90:504:296:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:affected by different dynamics between consumption expenditure, the two wealth
70:1939:138980:15:15:90:504:281:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:components  and  disposable  income.  The  estimated  equation  for  household
70:1940:139058:15:15:90:504:266:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:consumption, embodying the long run savings ratio described here, is reported in
70:1941:139138:15:15:90:504:251:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Barrell et al. (2003), and in most scenarios we utilise the assumption that individuals
70:1942:139225:15:15:90:504:236:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:form  (correct)  expectations  about  their  future  incomes  when  making  their
70:1943:139306:15:25:90:381:221:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:consumption decisions in relation to ‘permanent income’.
70:1944:139362:25:15:90:504:196:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:By identity a change in household sector savings must be mirrored in a change in
70:1945:139442:15:15:90:504:181:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:investment  either  at  home  or  abroad,  unless  it  is  associated  with  an  offsetting
70:1946:139533:15:15:90:504:166:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:change  in  saving  elsewhere  in  the  economy.  Within  NiGEM  three  categories  of
70:1947:139619:15:15:90:504:151:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:domestic investment are modelled separately. The company sector invests in capital
70:1948:139701:15:15:90:504:136:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:so that in the long run the marginal rate of return to capital equals its real user cost.
70:1949:139790:15:15:90:504:121:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:The underlying production function is CES (constant elasticity of substitution) and
70:1950:139873:15:15:90:504:106:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:this means that it is the capital-output ratio that is determined by the real user cost
70:1951:139960:15:15:90:504:91:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:of capital. Government investment is determined by policy in the short run. In the
70:1952:140042:15:15:90:504:76:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:longer term, all else equal, it is expected to grow in relation to needs reflected in the
70:1953:140131:15:15:90:504:61:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:age structure of the population. Housing investment rises with household sector
70:1954:140210:15:0:90:470:46:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:personal incomes and is reduced by a rise in the long-term real interest rate.

71:1956:140337:106:15:90:504:715:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:Government saving is determined by tax revenues less public sector expenditures,
71:1957:140417:15:15:90:504:700:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:and these are determined endogenously within NiGEM, with targets set for the level
71:1958:140499:15:15:90:504:685:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:of government borrowing. Company sector savings are determined as the residual
71:1959:140577:15:15:90:504:670:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:category of the savings-investment identity. The excess of investment over saving for
71:1960:140662:15:15:90:504:655:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:the UK economy as a whole is represented by the current account deficit of the
71:1961:140740:15:15:90:504:640:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:balance of payments. Within NiGEM competitiveness, export and import demand
71:1962:140815:15:15:90:504:625:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:are  all  endogenously  determined  and  reflect  trade  with  a  broad  range  of  other
71:1963:140904:15:15:90:504:610:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:economies. Income derived from net foreign assets held abroad, or net property
71:1964:140982:15:15:90:504:595:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:income, is determined by rates of return on assets held abroad and on foreign held
71:1965:141064:15:15:90:504:580:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:assets in the UK. Net foreign assets reflect the cumulated surpluses on the current
