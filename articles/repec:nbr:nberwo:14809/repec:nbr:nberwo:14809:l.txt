2:26:1199:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:?:This paper studies the conditions under which the scarcity of a factor (in particular, labor) encourages
2:27:1303:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:?:technological progress and technology adoption. In standard endogenous growth models, which feature
2:28:1402:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:?:a strong scale effect, an increase in the supply of labor encourages technological progress. In contrast,
2:29:1507:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:?:the famous Habakkuk hypothesis in economic history claims that technological progress was more
2:30:1601:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:?:rapid in 19th-century United States than in Britain because of labor scarcity in the former country.
2:31:1701:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:?:Similar ideas are often suggested as possible reasons for why high wages might have encouraged rapid
2:32:1801:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:?:adoption of certain technologies in continental Europe over the past several decades, and as a potential
2:33:1905:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:?:reason for why environmental regulations can spur more rapid innovation. I present a general framework
2:34:2007:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:?:for the analysis of these questions. I define technology as strongly labor saving if the aggregate production
2:35:2116:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:?:function of the economy exhibits decreasing differences in the appropriate index of technology, theta,
2:36:2218:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:?:and labor. Conversely, technology is strongly labor complementary if the production function exhibits
2:37:2319:14:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:?:increasing differences in theta and labor. The main result of the paper shows that labor scarcity will
2:38:2421:14:14:72:540:420:12:Times:12:Times:?:encourage technological advances if technology is strongly labor saving. In contrast, labor scarcity
2:39:2521:14:14:72:540:406:12:Times:12:Times:?:will discourage technological advances if technology is strongly labor complementary. I provide examples
2:40:2625:14:14:72:540:392:12:Times:12:Times:?:of environments in which technology can be strongly labor saving and also show that such a result
2:41:2722:14:14:72:540:378:12:Times:12:Times:?:is not possible in certain canonical macroeconomic models. These results clarify the conditions under
2:42:2823:14:14:72:540:364:12:Times:12:Times:?:which labor scarcity and high wages encourage technological advances and the reason why such results
2:43:2923:14:14:72:540:350:12:Times:12:Times:?:were obtained or conjectured in certain settings, but do not always apply in many models used in the
2:44:3023:14:42:72:155:336:12:Times:12:Times:?:growth literature.

3:52:3154:0:30:82:195:700:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:1  Introduction
3:53:3169:30:20:82:528:670:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:There is widespread consensus that technological di§erences are a central determinant of pro-
3:54:3262:20:20:82:528:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ductivity di§erences across Örms, regions, and nations. Despite this consensus, determinants
3:55:3354:20:20:82:528:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of technological progress and adoption of new technologies are poorly understood. A basic
3:56:3443:20:20:82:528:610:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:question concerns the relationship between factor endowments and technology, for example,
3:57:3532:20:19:82:528:590:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:whether the scarcity of a factor, and the high factor prices that this leads to, will induce
3:58:3624:19:20:82:528:571:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:technological progress. There is currently no comprehensive answer to this question, though
3:59:3715:20:20:82:529:551:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:B:a large literature develops conjectures on this topic. In his pioneering work,The Theory of
3:60:3806:20:32:82:511:531:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:B:Wages, John Hicks was one of the Örst economists to consider this possibility and argued:
3:61:3895:32:20:126:501:499:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:?:ìA change in the relative prices of the factors of production is itself a spur to
3:62:3976:20:20:110:502:479:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:invention, and to invention of a particular kindó directed to economizing the use
3:63:4057:20:31:110:434:459:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:of a factor which has become relatively expensive...î(1932, p. 124).
3:64:4125:31:20:99:528:428:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Similarly, the famous Habakkuk hypothesis in economic history, proposed by Habakkuk
3:65:4208:20:20:82:528:408:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(1962), claims that technological progress was more rapid in 19th-century United States than
3:66:4300:20:20:82:528:388:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in Britain because of labor scarcity in the former country, which acted as a powerful induce-
3:67:4393:20:20:82:528:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ment for mechanization, for the adoption of labor-saving technologies, and more broadly for
3:68:4484:20:32:82:358:348:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:innovation.1For example, Habakkuk quotes from Pelling:
3:69:4538:32:19:126:501:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:?:ì... it was scarcity of labor ëwhich laid the foundation for the future continuous
3:70:4620:19:20:110:502:297:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:progress of American industry, by obliging manufacturers to take every opportunity
3:71:4702:20:32:110:423:277:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:of installing new types of labor-saving machinery.í î(1962, p. 6),
3:72:4768:32:32:82:147:245:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and continues
3:73:4781:32:20:126:501:213:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:?:ìIt seems obviousó it certainly seemed so to contemporariesó that the dearness
3:74:4859:20:19:110:502:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:and inelasticity of American, compared with British, labour gave the American
3:75:4936:19:20:110:502:174:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:entrepreneur ... a greater inducement than his British counterpart to replace labour
3:76:5020:20:17:110:245:154:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:by machines.î(1962, p. 17).
3:77:5047:17:15:95:529:137:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:1See Rothbart (1946), Salter (1966), David (1975), Stewart (1977) and Mokyr (1990) for related ides and
3:78:5150:15:0:82:244:122:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:discussions of the Habakkuk hypothesis.
4:79:5190:0:19:99:528:700:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Mantouxís (1961) classic history of the Industrial Revolution also echoes the same theme,
4:80:5279:19:20:82:528:681:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:emphasizing how the changes in labor costs in spinning and weaving have been a major impetus
4:81:5371:20:20:82:528:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to innovation in these industries. Robert Allen (2008) extends and strengthens this argument,
4:82:5464:20:20:82:528:641:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and proposes that the relatively high wages in 18th-century Britain were the main driver of
4:83:5555:20:20:82:528:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the Industrial Revolution. Allen, for example, starts his book with a quote from T. Bentley in
4:84:5649:20:32:82:412:601:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:1780 explaining the economic dynamism of British industrial centers:
4:85:5717:32:19:126:501:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:?:ì... Nottingham, Leicester, Birmingham, She¢ eld etc. must long ago have given
4:86:5795:19:20:110:502:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:up all hopes of foreign commerce, if they had not been constantly counteracting
4:87:5874:20:20:110:502:530:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:the advancing price of manual labor, by adopting every ingenious improvement the
4:88:5954:20:32:110:243:510:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:human mind could invent.î
4:89:5979:32:20:99:528:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Similar ideas are often suggested as possible reasons why high wages, for example induced
4:90:6068:20:20:82:528:458:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:by minimum wages or other regulations, might have encouraged faster adoption of certain
4:91:6155:20:19:82:528:438:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:technologies, particularly those complementary to unskilled labor, in continental Europe (see,
4:92:6249:19:20:82:487:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:among others, Beaudry and Collard, 2002, Acemoglu 2003, Alesina and Zeira, 2006).
4:93:6330:20:20:99:528:399:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:More recently, these ideas have become relevant in the context of environmental regulation.
4:94:6421:20:20:82:529:379:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The famousPorter hypothesisapplies Hicksís (1932) ideas to the development of environmen-
4:95:6510:20:20:82:528:359:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tal technologies and claims that tighter environmental regulations will spur faster innovation
4:96:6604:20:20:82:528:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and increase productivity.  While this hypothesis plays a major role in various discussions
4:97:6695:20:19:82:528:319:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of environmental policy, just like the Habakkuk hypothesis, its theoretical foundations are
4:98:6786:19:20:82:124:300:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:unclear.2
4:99:6795:20:20:99:528:280:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In contrast to these conjectures and hypotheses, most commonly-used macroeconomic mod-
4:100:6881:20:20:82:528:260:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:els imply that labor scarcity should discourage technological progress.  Neoclassical growth
4:101:6973:20:20:82:528:240:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:models, when new technologies are embodied in capital goods, predict that labor scarcity or
4:102:7064:20:20:82:529:220:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:high wages should discourage the adoption of new technologies.3Endogenous growth models
4:103:7151:20:19:82:528:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:also make the same prediction.  These models typically have a single factor of production,
4:104:7241:19:16:82:528:181:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:labor, and exhibit a strong scale e§ect. An increase in the size of the labor force will induce
4:105:7336:16:15:95:529:165:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:2See Porter (1991) and Porter and van der Linde (1995) for the formulation of this hypothesis. Ja§e, Peterson,
4:106:7446:15:11:82:528:150:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:Portney and Stavins (1995) review early empirical evidence on this topic and Newell, Ja§ee and Stavins (1999)
4:107:7555:11:11:82:528:139:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:provide evidence on the e§ects of energy prices on the direction of technological change. Recent work by Gans
4:108:7664:11:7:82:500:128:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:(2009) provides a theoretical explanation for the Porter hypothesis using the framework presented here.
4:109:7767:7:15:95:529:121:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:3See Ricardo (1951) for an early statement of this view.  In particular, with a constant returns to scale
4:110:7872:15:11:82:529:106:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:production functionF(L; K), an increase in the price ofLor a reduction in its supply, will reduce equilibrium
4:111:7981:11:0:82:472:95:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f2:F:K, and to the extent that technology is embedded in capital, it will reduce technology adoption.
5:112:8078:0:19:82:528:700:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:more rapid technological progress, and either increase the growth rate (in the Örst-generation
5:113:8172:19:20:82:528:681:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:models, such as Romer, 1986, 1990, Segerstrom, Anant and Dinopoulos, 1990, Aghion and
5:114:8257:20:20:82:528:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Howitt, 1992, Grossman and Helpman, 1991), or the level of output (in the semi-endogenous
5:115:8346:20:20:82:389:641:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:growth models such as Jones, 1995, Young, 1998, Howitt, 1999).
5:116:8408:20:20:99:528:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The directed technological change literature (e.g., Acemoglu, 1998, 2002, 2007) provides a
5:117:8498:20:20:82:528:601:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:characterization of how the bias of technology will change in response to changes in the supplies
5:118:8595:20:19:82:528:581:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of factors. In particular, Acemoglu (2007) establishes that, under weak regularity conditions,
5:119:8689:19:20:82:529:562:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:an increase in the supply of a factor always induces a change in technologybiasedtowards
5:120:8777:20:20:82:529:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that factor.4This result implies that labor scarcity will lead to technological changes biased
5:121:8871:20:20:82:528:522:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:against labor. Nevertheless, these results do not address the question of whether the scarcity
5:122:8965:20:20:82:529:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of a factor will lead totechnological advances(i.e., to changes in technology that increase
5:123:9056:20:20:82:528:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the level of output in the economy). Reviewing the intuition for previous results is useful to
5:124:9150:20:19:82:528:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:explain why this is.  In particular, suppose that technology can be represented by a single
5:125:9241:19:20:82:528:443:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:variable-and suppose that-and labor,L, are complements. Then, an increase in the supply
5:126:9328:20:20:82:529:423:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of labor induces an increase in-, and because of--Lcomplementarity, this induced change is
5:127:9418:20:20:82:529:403:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:biased towards labor. Conversely, if-andLare substitutes, an increase in the supply of labor
5:128:9510:20:20:82:529:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:leads to a decline in-, and now because of--Lsubstitutability, the decrease in-increases
5:129:9598:20:20:82:528:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the marginal product of labor and is again biased towards this factor. This discussion not
5:130:9688:20:20:82:528:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:only illustrates the robust logic of equilibrium bias in response to changes in supply, but also
5:131:9784:20:19:82:528:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:makes it clear that the induced changes in technology, though always biased towards the more
5:132:9876:19:20:82:528:304:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:abundant factor, could take the form of more or less advanced technologies; in other words,
5:133:9967:20:20:82:528:284:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:they may correspond to the choice of equilibrium technologies that increase or reduce output.5
5:134:10061:20:20:99:528:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The question of whether scarcity of a particular factor of production spurs technological
5:135:10150:20:20:82:528:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:advances is arguably more important than the implications of these induced changes on the bias
5:136:10244:20:20:82:528:224:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of technology. This paper investigates the impact of labor scarcity on technological advances
5:137:10337:20:19:82:528:204:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(innovation and adoption of technologies increasing output). I present a general framework
5:138:10427:19:17:82:529:185:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:B:and a comprehensive answer to this question. The key is the concept ofstrongly factor (labor)
5:139:10520:17:15:95:529:168:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:4A change in technology is biased towards a factor if it increases the marginal product of this factor at
5:140:10625:15:11:82:528:153:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:given factor proportions. Conversely, a change in technology is biased against a factor if it reduces its marginal
5:141:10739:11:7:82:227:142:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:product at given factor proportions.
5:142:10775:7:15:95:529:135:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:5In a dynamic framework, changes towards less advanced technologies would typically take the form of a
5:143:10877:15:0:82:398:120:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:slowdown in the adoption and invention of new, more productive technologies.
6:144:10954:0:19:82:529:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:B:saving technology.6Suppose aggregate output (or net output) can be expressed as a function
6:145:11044:19:20:82:529:681:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f2:B:Y(L; Z; -), whereLdenotes labor,Zis a vector of other factors of production, and-is a vector
6:146:11136:20:20:82:529:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of technologies. Suppose thatYissupermodularin-, so that changes in two components of

6:148:11308:20:20:82:529:621:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f3:F:-increases output. Then technology is strongly labor saving ifY(L; Z; -)exhibitsdecreasing
6:149:11398:20:20:82:529:601:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:B:di§erencesin-andL. Intuitively, this means that technological progress reduces the marginal
6:150:11489:20:19:82:528:581:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:product of labor. Conversely, technology isstrongly labor complementaryifY(L; Z; -)exhibits
6:151:11580:19:20:82:529:562:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:B:increasing di§erencesin-andL. The main result of the paper shows that labor scarcity induces
6:152:11672:20:20:82:528:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:technological advances if technology is strongly labor saving. In contrast, when technological
6:153:11766:20:20:82:528:522:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:change is strongly labor complementary, then labor scarcity discourages technological advances.
6:154:11861:20:20:99:528:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:This result can be interpreted both as a positive and a negative one. On the positive side,
6:155:11952:20:20:82:528:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:it characterizes a wide range of economic environments where labor scarcity can act as a force
6:156:12046:20:19:82:528:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:towards innovation and technology adoption, as claimed in various previous historical and
6:157:12135:19:20:82:528:443:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:economic analyses. On the negative side, most models used in the growth literature exhibit
6:158:12225:20:20:82:528:423:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:increasing rather than decreasing di§erences between technology and labor (though this is
6:159:12314:20:20:82:358:403:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:typically an implication of functional form assumptions).7
6:160:12372:20:20:99:528:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:To highlight what decreasing di§erences between technology and labor means in speciÖc
6:161:12457:20:20:82:528:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:settings, I consider several di§erent environments and production functions, and discuss when
6:162:12550:20:20:82:528:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the decreasing di§erences condition is satisÖed. An important class of models where techno-
6:163:12641:20:19:82:528:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:logical change can be strongly labor saving is developed by Champernowne (1963) and Zeira
6:164:12730:19:20:82:528:304:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(1998, 2006), and is also related to the endogenous growth model of Hellwig and Irmen (2001).
6:165:12823:20:20:82:528:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In these models, technological change takes the form of machines replacing tasks previously
6:166:12914:20:20:82:528:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:performed by labor. I show that there is indeed a tendency of technology to be strongly labor
6:167:13007:20:20:82:192:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:saving in these models.
6:168:13030:20:20:99:528:224:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Most of the analysis in this paper focuses on the implications of labor scarcity on technology
6:169:13124:20:19:82:528:204:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:choices. Nevertheless, these results are also directly applicable to the question of the impact
6:170:13219:19:16:82:528:185:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of wage push on technology choices in the context of a competitive labor market because, in
6:171:13310:16:15:95:529:169:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:6The adjective ìstronglyî is added here, since the term ìlabor savingî is often used in several di§erent
6:172:13414:15:7:82:477:154:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:contexts, and in most of these cases, the ìdecreasing di§erencesîconditions here are not satisÖed.
6:173:13512:7:15:95:529:147:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:7The fact that technological change has been the key driving force of the secular increase in wages also
6:174:13616:15:11:82:528:132:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:suggests that increasing di§erences may be more likely than decreasing di§erences. Nevertheless, it should be
6:175:13725:11:11:82:528:121:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:noted that in the context of a dynamic model, it is possible for the past technological changes to increase wage
6:176:13837:11:11:82:528:110:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:levels, while current technology adoption decisions, at the margin, reduce the marginal product of labor. This
6:177:13947:11:0:82:339:99:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:is illustrated by the dynamic model presented in subsection 5.1.
7:178:14012:0:19:82:528:700:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:this context, a minimum wage above the equilibrium wage is equivalent to a decline in labor
7:179:14103:19:20:82:529:681:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:supply.8However, I also show the conditions under which the implications of labor scarcity and
7:180:14197:20:20:82:528:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:wage push can be very di§erentó particularly because the long-run relationship between labor
7:181:14289:20:20:82:516:641:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:supply and wages could be upward sloping owing to general equilibrium technology e§ects.
7:182:14377:20:20:99:528:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Even though the investigation here is motivated by technological change and the study
7:183:14462:20:20:82:528:601:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of economic growth, the economic environment I use is static. A static framework is useful
7:184:14552:20:19:82:528:581:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:because it enables us to remove functional form restrictions that would be necessary to generate
7:185:14648:19:20:82:528:562:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:endogenous growth; it thus allows the appropriate level of generality to clarify the conditions
7:186:14743:20:20:82:528:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for labor scarcity to encourage innovation and technology adoption. This framework is based
7:187:14834:20:20:82:528:522:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on Acemoglu (2007). Section 2 adapts this framework for the current paper and also contains
7:188:14925:20:20:82:528:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a review of the results on equilibrium bias that are useful for later sections. The main results
7:189:15021:20:20:82:528:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are contained in Section 3. These results are applied to a number of familiar models in Section
7:190:15116:20:34:82:378:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:4. Section 5 discusses various extensions. Section 6 concludes.
7:191:15179:34:31:82:368:428:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:2  The Basic Environments and Review
7:192:15215:31:19:82:528:397:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:This section is based on, reviews, and extends some of the results in Acemoglu (2007). Its
7:193:15305:19:20:82:528:378:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:inclusion is necessary for the development of the main results in Section 3, but since many of
7:194:15399:20:20:82:528:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the results are already present in previous work, I provide only a brief review. Consider a static
7:195:15497:20:20:82:529:338:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:economy consisting of a unique Önal good andN+ 1factors of production. The Örst factor
7:196:15583:20:20:82:528:318:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f7:B:of production is labor, denoted byL, and the rest are denoted by the vectorZ= (Z1; :::; ZN)
7:197:15674:20:20:82:528:298:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and stand for land, capital, and other human or nonhuman factors. All agentsípreferences are
7:198:15766:20:20:82:528:278:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:deÖned over the consumption of the Önal good. To start with, let us assume that all factors
7:199:15857:20:19:82:528:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are supplied inelastically, with supplies denoted by-L2R+and-Z2RN+. Throughout I will
7:200:15942:19:20:82:528:239:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:focus on comparative statics with respect to changes in the supply of labor, while holding the
7:201:16036:20:20:82:529:219:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:supply of other factors,Z, constant at some level-Z(though, clearly, mathematically there
7:202:16125:20:20:82:529:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is nothing special about labor).9The economy consists of a continuum of Örms (Önal good
7:203:16212:20:16:82:529:179:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:producers) denoted by the setF, each with an identical production function. Without loss of
7:204:16303:16:15:95:529:163:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:8The implications of ìwage pushî in noncompetitive labor markets are more complex and depend on the
7:205:16402:15:11:82:528:148:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:speciÖc aspects of labor market imperfections and institutions. For example, Acemoglu (2003) shows that wage
7:206:16510:11:11:82:528:137:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:push resulting from a minimum wage or other labor market regulations can encourage technology adoption when
7:207:16617:11:7:82:252:126:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:there is wage bargaining and rent sharing.
7:208:16659:7:15:95:529:119:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:9Endogenous responses of the supply of labor and other factors, such as capital, are discussed in subsections
7:209:16768:15:0:82:129:104:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:5.2 and 5.3.
8:210:16781:0:19:82:529:700:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:any generality let us normalize the measure ofF,jFj, to 1. The price of the Önal good is also
8:211:16874:19:20:82:160:681:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:normalized to 1.
8:212:16890:20:32:99:504:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:I Örst describe technology choice in four di§erent economic environments. These are:
8:213:16974:32:20:96:529:629:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:1. Economy D (fordecentralized) is a decentralized competitive economy in which technolo-
8:214:17063:20:20:110:529:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:gies are chosen by Örms themselves. In this economy, technology choice can be interpreted
8:215:17152:20:20:110:529:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:as choice of just another set of factors and the entire analysis can be conducted in terms
8:216:17242:20:28:110:222:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:of technology adoption.
8:217:17265:28:20:96:528:541:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:2. Economy E (forexternality) is identical to Economy D, except for a technological exter-
8:218:17355:20:29:110:236:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:nality as in Romer (1986).
8:219:17381:29:20:96:528:492:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:3. Economy M (formonopoly) will be the main environment used for much of the analysis
8:220:17466:20:20:110:529:472:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:in the remainder of the paper. In this economy, technologies are created and supplied by
8:221:17554:20:20:110:529:452:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:a proÖt-maximizing monopolist. In this environment, technological progress enables the
8:222:17640:20:19:110:529:432:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:creation of ìbetter machines,îwhich can then be sold to several Örms in the Önal good
8:223:17725:19:20:110:529:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:sector. Thus, Economy M incorporates Romerís (1990) insight that the central aspect
8:224:17808:20:29:110:528:393:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:distinguishing ìtechnologyîfrom other factors of production is the non-rivalry of ideas.
8:225:17896:29:20:96:529:364:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:4. Economy O (foroligopoly) generalizes Economy M to an environment including oligopolis-
8:226:17985:20:20:110:529:344:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:tically (or monopolistically) competitive Örms supplying technologies to the rest of the
8:227:18073:20:29:110:506:324:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:economy. The main results for Economy M are then extended to this environment.

9:282:19900:19:30:82:239:317:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:below will relax this assumption.
9:283:19933:30:20:82:529:287:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f2:B:Proposition 1Suppose Assumption 1 holds. Then any equilibrium technology-in Economy

9:289:20119:30:19:99:528:191:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Proposition 1 implies that to analyze equilibrium technology choices, we can simply focus
9:290:20208:19:20:82:528:172:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on a simple maximization problem. An important implication of this proposition is that the

13:488:28205:19:31:82:285:279:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:have established the following proposition:

13:499:28454:30:20:99:528:152:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:This proposition shows that equilibrium technology in Economy M is a solution to a problem

13:501:28632:20:20:82:528:112:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Naturally, the presence of the monopoly markup introduces distortions in the equilibrium.
13:502:28721:20:0:82:528:92:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:These distortions are important in ensuring that equilibrium technology is not at the level that
14:503:28819:0:19:82:528:700:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:maximizes net output. In particular, let us use the fact that the proÖt-maximizing monopoly

15:599:32171:31:32:82:331:375:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:This argument establishes the following proposition:

15:606:32480:32:20:99:528:230:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:This proposition shows that the equilibrium corresponds to a Nash equilibrium and thus,
15:607:32567:20:20:82:528:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:as in Economy E, it is given by a Öxed point problem. Nevertheless, this has little e§ect on the

16:618:33579:26:20:82:528:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:I now brieáy review the previous results concerning the bias of technology in response to

17:775:37353:31:20:99:528:132:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:A number of implications of this theorem are worth noting.  First, in contrast to basic
17:776:37440:20:20:82:528:112:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:producer theory, where all demand curves are downward sloping, this result shows that en-
17:777:37529:20:0:82:528:92:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:dogenous technology choices in general equilibrium can easily lead to upward sloping demand
18:778:37622:0:19:82:529:700:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:curves for factors. In particular, the condition thatr2F(L;-)(L;-)is not negative semi-deÖnite
18:779:37716:19:20:82:528:681:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is not very restrictive, since technology and factors are being chosen by di§erent agents (mo-
18:780:37810:20:20:82:528:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:nopolists or oligopolists on the one hand and Önal good producers on the other). However, this
18:781:37904:20:20:82:528:641:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:result also highlights that there cannot be strong bias in a fully competitive economy such as
18:782:37998:20:20:82:528:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Economy D, because equilibrium existence in Economy D imposes convexity of the aggregate
18:783:38086:20:20:82:528:601:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:production possibilities set and thus ensures thatr2F(L;-)(L;-)must be negative semi-deÖnite.
18:784:38179:20:19:82:528:581:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Most importantly for our purposes here, this theorem implies that whenr2F(L;-)(L;-)is neg-
18:785:38269:19:20:82:528:562:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ative semi-deÖnite, then the equilibrium relationship (taking into account the endogeneity of
18:786:38362:20:20:82:529:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:technology) between wage and labor supply can be expressed by a diminishing functionw-L(L).
18:787:38453:20:20:82:331:522:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We will make use of this feature in the next section.
18:788:38506:20:20:99:528:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:What do the results presented in this subsection imply about the impact of labor scarcity
18:789:38595:20:20:82:529:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on technological progress? The answer isalmost nothing. These results imply that when labor
18:790:38686:20:19:82:528:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:becomes more scarce, either because labor supply declines or because some regulation increases
18:791:38780:19:18:82:529:443:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:wages above market clearing and we move along the curvew-L(L)to an employment level below
18:792:38869:18:22:84:529:425:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:B:-L, technology will change in a way that is biased against labor. But as already discussed in the
18:793:38966:22:20:82:528:403:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Introduction, this can take the form of ìtechnological regressî(meaning technology is now less
18:794:39060:20:20:82:528:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of a contributing factor to output) or ìtechnological advanceî(change in technology increasing
18:795:39154:20:20:82:528:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:output further). In a dynamic framework, these changes could take the form of the economy
18:796:39243:20:20:82:528:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:foregoing some of the technological advances that it would have made otherwise or making

18:798:39422:19:20:82:528:304:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:not informative on the question motivating the current paper. Answers to this question are

20:913:43515:20:20:82:528:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:permodularity, the ìdirect e§ectî of labor scarcity on each technology component would be
20:914:43604:20:20:82:528:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:positive, but because of lack of supermodularity, the advance in one component may then
20:915:43691:20:20:82:528:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:induce an even larger deterioration in some other component, thus a precise result becomes
20:916:43781:20:19:82:529:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:impossible. WhenGexhibits neither increasing or decreasing di§erences, then a change in

20:927:44350:19:20:82:528:185:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:this makes the results not readily generalizable to a dynamic framework, it is clear that there
20:928:44445:20:20:82:528:165:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are multiple ways of extending this framework to a dynamic environment and the main forces
20:929:44535:20:20:82:528:145:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:will continue to apply in this case (see subsection 5.1 for an illustration of this point using
20:930:44630:20:20:82:528:125:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:an extension to a growth model). The advantage of the static environment is that it enables
20:931:44721:20:0:82:528:105:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:us to develop these results at a fairly high level of generality, without being forced to make

21:935:44957:27:20:82:528:625:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The results of Theorem 3 apply to Economy M and under Assumption 3. These results can be
21:936:45045:20:20:82:528:605:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:generalized to Economies E and O and also hold without Assumption 3. Here I show how this
21:937:45134:20:19:82:528:585:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:can be done in the simplest possible way by focusing on global results (while simultaneously
21:938:45226:19:20:82:528:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:relaxing Assumption 3). The next theorem is a direct analog of Theorem 3, except that now
21:939:45315:20:20:82:528:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:equilibrium technology corresponds to the Nash equilibrium of the game among oligopolist
21:940:45403:20:20:82:528:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:technology suppliers. As a consequence, multiple equilibria (multiple equilibrium technologies)
21:941:45498:20:20:82:528:506:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are possible. As is well known (e.g., Milgrom and Roberts, 1994, Topkis, 1998), when there
21:942:45588:20:20:82:528:486:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are multiple equilibria, we can typically only provide unambiguous comparative statics for
21:943:45678:20:19:82:528:466:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ìextremal equilibriaî.  These extremal equilibria in the present context correspond to the

21:946:45949:20:28:82:477:407:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:now refers to an increase in the greatest and the smallest equilibrium technologies.

22:962:47286:0:19:99:528:700:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:This theorem therefore establishes the global counterparts of the results in Theorem 3

22:964:47461:20:20:82:528:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Similar global results also hold for Economy M and Economy E, and are stated in the next

22:982:48284:20:20:82:528:435:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The main reason for this is that, as already discussed in the previous section, in the neighbor-

22:992:48741:27:20:82:528:300:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Let us consider the same environments as in the previous subsections, and also suppose that

22:997:48899:9:20:408:529:280:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:, so that, from Theorem
22:998:48922:20:20:82:528:260:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:2, the (endogenous-technology) relationship between labor supply and wage is given by a
22:999:49009:20:20:82:528:240:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:decreasing functionw-L(L). This implies that we can equivalently talk of a decrease in labor
22:1000:49101:20:19:82:528:220:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:supply (corresponding to labor becoming more ìscarceî) or a ìwage push,î where a wage
22:1001:49186:19:20:82:528:201:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:above the market clearing level is imposed. In this light, we can generally think of equilibrium

22:1008:49455:20:29:82:528:141:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:all of the results presented in this section continue to hold. This is stated in the next corollary.
22:1009:49555:29:20:82:528:112:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f2:B:Corollary 3Suppose thatr2F(L;-)(L;-)is negative semi-deÖnite. Then under the same as-
22:1010:49640:20:0:82:528:92:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sumptions as in Theorems 3 and 4 or in Corollaries 1 and 2, a minimum wage above the market
23:1011:49733:0:19:82:528:700:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:clearing wage level induces technological advances when technology is strongly labor saving and
23:1012:49828:19:29:82:490:681:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:discourages technological advances when technology is strongly labor complementary.
23:1013:49911:29:20:99:528:652:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f2:A:Proof.This result follows immediately from the observation that, whenr2F(L;-)(L;-)is
23:1014:49995:20:20:82:528:632:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:negative semi-deÖnite, a wage above the market clearing level is equivalent to a decline in
23:1015:50086:20:19:82:143:612:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:employment.
23:1016:50097:19:20:99:528:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The close association between labor scarcity and wage push in this result relies on the
23:1017:50184:20:20:82:529:573:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:assumption thatr2F(L;-)(L;-)is negative semi-deÖnite, so that the endogenous-technology
23:1018:50271:20:20:82:528:553:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:demand curves are downward sloping (recall Theorem 2). When this is not the case, wage
23:1019:50357:20:20:82:377:533:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:push can have richer e§ects and this is discussed in Section 5.
23:1020:50420:20:20:99:528:513:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:While Corollary 3 shows that wage push can induce technological advances, it should
23:1021:50503:20:19:82:528:493:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:be noted that even when this is the case, net output may decline because of the reduction
23:1022:50592:19:20:82:528:474:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in employment. Nevertheless, when the e§ect of labor scarcity on technology is su¢ ciently
23:1023:50682:20:20:82:528:454:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:pronounced, overall output may increase even though employment declines.  Consider the
23:1024:50768:20:20:82:528:434:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:following example, which illustrates both this possibility and also gives a simple instance where
23:1025:50865:20:28:82:251:414:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:technology is strongly labor saving.
23:1026:50901:28:28:82:512:386:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f2:B:Example 1Let us focus on Economy M and suppose that theGfunction takes the form

23:1028:51013:27:20:82:527:331:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f6:B:and the cost of technology creation isC(-) = 3-2=2. Let us normalize the supply of theZ

24:1110:52822:30:20:82:528:356:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In this section, I investigate the conditions under which, in a range of standard models, tech-
24:1111:52917:20:20:82:528:336:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:nology is strongly labor saving. The results show that it is possible to construct a rich set of
24:1112:53013:20:20:82:528:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:economies in which this is the case, though in most models commonly used in macroeconomics
24:1113:53103:20:20:82:528:296:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and economic growth, technology turns out not to be strongly labor saving. Throughout, I
24:1114:53191:20:20:82:528:276:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:provide examples in which technology can be represented by a single-dimensional variable (thus
24:1115:53285:20:20:82:528:256:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:focus on Economy M). This is to simplify the expressions and communicate the basic ideas in
24:1116:53376:20:19:82:528:236:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the most transparent manner. As the analysis in the previous sections illustrated, none of the
24:1117:53470:19:30:82:326:217:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:results require technology to be single dimensional.
24:1118:53522:30:26:82:525:187:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:4.1  Cobb-Douglas Production Functions with Harrod Neutral Technology
24:1119:53591:26:20:82:529:161:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:As a Örst example, suppose that the functionG, and thus the aggregate production function
24:1120:53680:20:20:82:528:141:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of the economy, takes a ìCobb-Douglas formîwith Harrod-neutral technology. In particular,
24:1121:53769:20:20:82:213:121:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:let us write this function as
24:1122:53798:20:0:242:368:101:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:C:G(L; Z; -) =H(Z) (-L)-;
25:1123:53823:0:19:82:583:700:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:whereH:RN+!R+, and thus aggregate net output is given byY(L; Z; -) = (2--)H(Z) (-L)-=(1--),
25:1124:53914:19:20:82:529:681:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:where-2(0;1)is the parameter of the production function in (10), measuring the elasticity of
25:1125:54006:20:20:82:529:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:aggregate output to the subcomponentG. It is straightforward to verify that the cross-partial
25:1126:54099:20:26:82:288:641:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ofGwith respect toLand-in this case is
25:1127:54137:26:25:217:394:615:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:C:GL-(L; Z; -) =-2H(Z) (-L)--1>0:
25:1128:54168:25:20:82:528:590:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Therefore, technology is always strongly labor complementary in this case and labor scarcity
25:1129:54260:20:20:82:387:570:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:or wage push will necessarily discourage technological advances.
25:1130:54324:20:20:99:528:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:It is also straightforward to verify that the same conclusion holds if the production function
25:1131:54418:20:19:82:529:530:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is modiÖed toG(L; Z; -) =H(Z; -)L-. In this case, the assumptions imposed so far imply
25:1132:54504:19:20:82:529:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:thatHmust be strictly increasing in-.  Supposing that it is also di§erentiable, we have
25:1133:54591:20:29:82:444:491:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f2:B:GL-(L; Z; -) =-H-(Z; -)L--1>0, so that the same conclusion is reached.
25:1134:54661:29:27:82:309:462:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:4.2  Changes in Substitution Patterns
25:1135:54698:27:19:82:528:435:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Technological change that alters the substitution patterns across factors often turns out to be
25:1136:54793:19:20:82:528:416:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:strongly labor saving. The analysis in subsection 4.4 will illustrate this in detail, but a simple
25:1137:54891:20:20:82:528:396:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:example based on Cobb-Douglas production functions illustrates the intuition. Suppose that
25:1138:54981:20:26:82:225:376:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the functionGtakes the form
25:1139:55008:26:25:233:378:350:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:C:G(L; Z; -) =A(-)H(Z)L1--;
25:1140:55033:25:20:82:529:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:whereA(-)is a strictly increasing and di§erentiable function. From Proposition 3, equilibrium

26:1188:55777:26:20:82:528:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Let us next turn to constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production functions with factor-

26:1190:55960:20:20:82:528:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:will see below that the important restriction here is that technology is factor augmenting. To
26:1191:56054:20:20:82:528:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:simplify the discussion, let us continue to focus on cases in which technology is represented

31:1505:65089:20:20:82:528:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:technology. This is intuitive, since the process of machines replacing labor is closely connected
31:1506:65186:20:34:82:347:641:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to new technology substituting for and saving on labor.
31:1507:65241:34:30:82:292:607:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:5  Extensions and Discussion
31:1508:65269:30:20:82:528:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In this section, I discuss a number of issues raised by the analysis so far. First, I show that
31:1509:65364:20:20:82:528:557:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:technology being strongly labor saving does not contradict the positive impact of secular tech-
31:1510:65459:20:20:82:528:537:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:nological changes on wages. Second, I show how endogenous factor supplies can be incorporated
31:1511:65552:20:20:82:528:517:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:into this framework. Finally, I discuss how wage push can lead to very di§erent results than
31:1512:65644:20:20:82:528:497:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:labor scarcity when the endogenous-technology demand curve for labor is upward sloping (in
31:1513:65734:20:28:82:315:477:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:line with the conditions provided in Theorem 2).
31:1514:65782:28:27:82:361:449:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:5.1  Technological Change and Wage Increases
31:1515:65826:27:20:82:528:422:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:One objection to the plausibility of strongly labor saving technology is that the growth process
31:1516:65922:20:20:82:528:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is accompanied by a steady increase in the wage rate, while strongly labor saving technology
31:1517:66014:20:20:82:528:382:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:implies that further technological advances will tend to reduce the marginal product of labor.
31:1518:66108:20:20:82:528:362:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In this subsection, I show that a simple dynamic extension allows technological change to
31:1519:66197:20:19:82:436:342:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:increase wages while still maintaining technology as strongly labor saving.
31:1520:66272:19:20:99:528:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:My purpose here is not to develop a full dynamic general equilibrium model.  For this
31:1521:66357:20:20:82:528:303:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:reason, I only use a slight variant of Economy E and a simple demographic structure to
31:1522:66443:20:20:82:528:283:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:communicate the main ideas.  The exact form of the production function is motivated by
31:1523:66529:20:20:82:528:263:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the models in which machines replace labor such as those discussed in subsection 4.4, though
31:1524:66621:20:20:82:524:243:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:various di§erent alternative formulations could also have been used to obtain similar results.
31:1525:66715:20:19:99:528:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The economy is in discrete time and runs to inÖnite horizon.  It is inhabited by one-
31:1526:66800:19:20:82:528:204:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:period lived individuals, each operating a Örm. Therefore, each Örm maximizes static proÖts.
31:1527:66892:20:20:82:528:184:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The total measures of individuals and Örms are normalized to 1.  There are two factors of
31:1528:66981:20:17:82:529:164:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:production,LandZ, both inelastically supplied in each period with supplies equal to-Land
31:1529:67069:17:23:85:529:147:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:B:-Z. Past technology choices create an externality similar to that in Economy E. In particular,

32:1609:68478:19:0:82:474:327:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f14:B:and wages. This is despite the fact that, at the margin, labor scarcity increases--

32:1620:68754:20:20:82:528:267:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of wages, but this change will also increase the rate of wage and output growth. This result
32:1621:68846:20:20:82:528:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:highlights that in a dynamic framework with strongly labor saving technology, the short-run

32:1627:69229:27:20:82:528:112:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:To highlight the new results of the framework presented in this paper, the analysis so far has
32:1628:69323:20:0:82:528:92:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:treated the supply of all factors as exogenous. This ignores both the response of labor supply
33:1629:69419:0:19:82:528:700:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to changes in wages and also the adjustment of other factors, such as capital, to changes in
33:1630:69511:19:20:82:528:681:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:factor supplies or labor market regulations that create wage push. Endogenous labor supply
33:1631:69601:20:20:82:285:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is further discussed in the next subsection.
33:1632:69645:20:20:99:528:641:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Here let us focus on endogenous supply of other factors. For example, we can imagine a
33:1633:69731:20:20:82:528:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:situation in which one of the other factors of production is capital that is elastically supplied. In
33:1634:69832:20:20:82:528:601:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:this case, a change in labor supply will a§ect both technology and the supply of capital so that
33:1635:69928:20:19:82:528:581:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the rental rate of capital remains constant. Consequently, the overall impact on technology
33:1636:70019:19:20:82:528:562:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:will be a combination of the direct e§ect of labor supply and an indirect e§ect working through
33:1637:70114:20:20:82:528:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the induced changes in the capital stock of the economy. Although the details of the analysis
33:1638:70207:20:20:82:528:522:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are somewhat di§erent in this case, we can note that the essence of the main results presented
33:1639:70301:20:20:82:528:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in Section 3 remain unchanged. In particular, those results were stated in terms of strongly
33:1640:70393:20:20:82:528:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:labor saving [complementary] technology or decreasing [increasing] di§erences of the function
33:1641:70486:20:19:82:529:462:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f2:B:Gholding the supply of other factors Öxed. One can alternatively deÖne notions of labor saving
33:1642:70580:19:20:82:528:443:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:[complementary] technology (or decreasing [increasing] di§erences) holding the price of capital
33:1643:70675:20:20:82:528:423:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:constant. It is then straightforward that Theorems 3 and 4 would apply with these modiÖed
33:1644:70764:20:29:82:134:403:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:deÖnitions.

33:1646:70808:27:20:82:528:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Let us now suppose that the supply of labor is endogenous, given by a standard labor supply
33:1647:70899:20:20:82:529:327:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:functionLs(wL). From the analysis leading to Corollary 3, it is then clear that none of the
33:1648:70990:20:20:82:529:307:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:results will be a§ected ifr2F(L;-)(L;-)is negative semi-deÖnite andLs(wL)is increasing. In par-
33:1649:71085:20:20:82:529:287:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ticular, in this case, we can study the impact of a shift in labor supply fromLs(wL)to~Ls(wL),
33:1650:71179:20:19:82:528:267:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:where~Ls(wL)< Ls(wL), or the impact of a binding minimum wage. Sincer2F(L;-)(L;-)is
33:1651:71262:19:20:82:528:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:negative semi-deÖnite, the endogenous-technology relationship between employment and wages
33:1652:71352:20:20:82:528:228:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f7:B:is decreasing. Therefore, a leftwards shift of the labor supply schedule fromLs(wL)to~Ls(wL)
33:1653:71444:20:20:82:528:208:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:will reduce employment and increase wages. The implications for technology are determined
33:1654:71533:20:20:82:528:188:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:by whether technology is strongly labor saving or strongly labor complementary (according to
33:1655:71625:20:20:82:253:168:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Theorems 3 and 4; see Corollary 3).
33:1656:71660:20:20:99:528:148:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:However, the close connection between wage push and labor scarcity highlighted in Corol-

33:1658:71841:19:0:82:528:109:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:technology demand curve is upward sloping and thus a decrease in labor supply reduces wages,

34:1665:71988:43:20:82:528:475:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:whereas an increase in labor supply increases wages. This becomes particularly interesting
34:1666:72078:20:20:82:528:455:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:when labor supply is endogenous as discussed in the previous subsection. In this case, multi-
34:1667:72171:20:20:82:528:435:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ple equilibria, characterized by di§erent levels of labor supply, technology and wages, become
34:1668:72265:20:29:82:527:415:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:possible. The next example illustrates this possibility using a simple extension of Example 1.
34:1669:72359:29:20:82:529:386:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f2:B:Example 2Suppose that theGfunction takes a form similar to that in Example 1, except
34:1670:72443:20:19:82:529:366:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f7:B:for a slight variation in exponents.  In particular, suppose thatG(L; Z; -) = 3-Z2=3=2 +
34:1671:72531:19:20:82:528:347:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f2:B:3 (1--)L2=3=2, and the cost of technology creation isC(-) = 3-2=4. It can now be veriÖed
34:1672:72619:20:20:82:528:327:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:thatr2F(L;-)(L;-)is no longer negative semi-deÖnite (where as it was in Example 1). Therefore,
34:1673:72713:20:20:82:528:307:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from Theorem 2, we expect the endogenous-technology relationship between employment (labor
34:1674:72803:20:20:82:528:287:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:supply) and wage to be increasing. We will now see how this interacts with endogenous labor
34:1675:72894:20:20:82:115:267:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:supply.
34:1676:72901:20:19:99:529:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Let us again normalize the supply of theZfactor to-Z= 1and denote employment by

34:1681:73221:28:20:82:528:132:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:which illustrates the potentially upward-sloping endogenous-technology relationship between
34:1682:73312:20:20:82:528:112:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:employment and wages demonstrated more generally in Theorem 2. Now suppose that labor
34:1683:73397:20:0:82:528:92:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:supply is also responsive to wage and takes the formLs(w) = 6w2-11w+ 6.Now combining
35:1684:73483:0:19:82:528:700:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:this supply relationship with (27), we Önd that there are three equilibrium wages, with di§erent
35:1685:73579:19:20:82:528:681:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:levels of labor supply and technology,w= 1,2and3. Moreover, technology is most advanced
35:1686:73666:20:20:82:260:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:B:and labor supply is highest atw= 3.
35:1687:73701:20:20:99:529:641:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Next consider a minimum wage between2and3. This will typically destroy the Örst two
35:1688:73784:20:20:82:528:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:equilibria. Thus the implications of ìwage pushî are potentially very di§erent when it may
35:1689:73874:20:20:82:528:601:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:destroy the other equilibria. Figure 1 illustrates the situation diagrammatically. The minimum
35:1690:73968:20:19:82:529:581:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:wage indeed destroys the equilibria atw= 1andw= 2. Nevertheless, some caution is also
35:1691:74053:19:20:82:528:562:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:necessary. In certain situations it can also introduce an extreme no-activity equilibrium, where
35:1692:74149:20:20:82:528:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:there is no employment, or it may make such a no-activity equilibrium, which may have already
35:1693:74242:20:20:82:528:522:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:existed, more likely. When we are in Economy M, such a no-activity equilibrium does not exist,
35:1694:74336:20:20:82:528:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:because the monopolist acts as a ìStackleberg leaderîand chooses the technology anticipating
35:1695:74428:20:20:82:528:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:employment. However, in Economy O, such a no-activity equilibrium may arise if a high level
35:1696:74519:20:34:82:223:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of minimum wage is imposed.
35:1697:74546:34:31:82:184:428:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:6  Conclusion
35:1698:74559:31:19:82:528:397:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:This paper studied the conditions under which the scarcity of a factor encourages technological
35:1699:74654:19:20:82:528:378:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:progress (innovation or adoption of technologies increasing output). Despite a large literature
35:1700:74749:20:20:82:528:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on endogenous technological change and technology adoption, we do not yet have a compre-
35:1701:74837:20:20:82:528:338:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:hensive theoretical or empirical understanding of the determinants of innovation, technological
35:1702:74932:20:20:82:528:318:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:progress, and technology adoption. Most importantly, how factor proportions, for example,
35:1703:75021:20:20:82:419:298:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:abundance or scarcity of labor, a§ect technology is poorly understood.
35:1704:75091:20:20:99:528:278:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In standard endogenous growth models, which feature a strong scale e§ect, an increase in
35:1705:75179:20:19:82:528:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the supply of a factor encourages technological progress. In contrast, the famous Habakkuk
35:1706:75269:19:20:82:528:239:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:hypothesis in economic history claims that technological progress was more rapid in 19th-
35:1707:75358:20:20:82:528:219:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:century United States than in Britain because of labor scarcity in the former country. Related
35:1708:75452:20:20:82:528:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ideas are often suggested as possible reasons for why high wages might have encouraged more
35:1709:75543:20:20:82:528:179:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rapid adoption of certain technologies in continental Europe than in the United States over
35:1710:75634:20:20:82:528:159:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the past several decades. The famous Porter hypothesis has a similar logic and suggests that
35:1711:75726:20:19:82:476:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:environmental regulations can be a powerful inducement to technological progress.
35:1712:75807:19:20:99:528:120:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:This paper characterizes the conditions under which factor scarcity can induce technological
35:1713:75899:20:0:82:528:100:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:advances (innovation or adoption of more productive technologies). I introduced the concepts
36:1714:75993:0:19:82:528:700:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of strongly labor (factor) saving and strongly labor (factor) complementary technology.  In
36:1715:76084:19:20:82:528:681:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:particular, technology is strongly labor saving if the production function exhibits decreasing
36:1716:76178:20:20:82:529:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:di§erences in an index of technology,-, and labor. Conversely, technology is strongly labor
36:1717:76269:20:20:82:529:641:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:complementary if the production function exhibits increasing di§erences in-and labor. The
36:1718:76358:20:20:82:528:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:main result of the paper shows that labor scarcity induces technological advances if technology
36:1719:76453:20:20:82:528:601:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is strongly labor saving. In contrast, labor scarcity discourages technological advances if tech-
36:1720:76550:20:19:82:528:581:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:nology is strongly labor complementary. I also show that, under some additional conditions,
36:1721:76641:19:20:82:528:562:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:wage pushó an increase in wage levels above the competitive equilibriumó has similar e§ects
36:1722:76732:20:20:82:528:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to labor scarcity. I also provided examples of environments in which technology can be strongly
36:1723:76827:20:20:82:528:522:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:labor saving and showed that such a result is not possible in certain canonical models. These
36:1724:76920:20:20:82:528:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:results clarify the conditions under which labor scarcity and high wages are likely to encourage
36:1725:77016:20:20:82:528:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:innovation and adoption of more productive technologies, and the reason why such results were
36:1726:77109:20:19:82:528:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:obtained or conjectured in certain settings but do not always apply in many models used in
36:1727:77199:19:20:82:185:443:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the growth literature.
36:1728:77221:20:20:99:528:423:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:While the theoretical analysis provided here clariÖes the conditions under which factor
36:1729:77308:20:20:82:528:403:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:scarcity and wage (factor price) push may induce innovation and technology adoption, these
36:1730:77398:20:20:82:528:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:conditions may or may not hold depending on the speciÖc application (time period, institu-
36:1731:77488:20:20:82:528:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tional framework, the industry in question, etc.).  This suggests that empirical evidence is
36:1732:77580:20:20:82:528:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:necessary to shed light on when factor scarcities and various regulations a§ecting factor prices
36:1733:77676:20:19:82:528:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:may encourage innovation and technology adoption. Existing evidence suggests that this is
36:1734:77765:19:20:82:528:304:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a possibility, but is not conclusive. For example, Newell, Ja§ee and Stavins (1999) show an
36:1735:77856:20:20:82:528:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:e§ect of changes in energy prices on the direction of innovation and on the energy e¢ ciency
36:1736:77948:20:20:82:528:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of household durables and Popp (2002) provides similar evidence using patents.  Acemoglu
36:1737:78036:20:20:82:528:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and Finkelstein (2008) show that the Prospective Payment System reform of Medicare in the
36:1738:78125:20:20:82:528:224:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:United States, which increased the labor costs of hospitals with a signiÖcant share of Medicare
36:1739:78220:20:19:82:528:204:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:patients, appears to have induced signiÖcant technology adoption in the a§ected hospitals.
36:1740:78310:19:20:82:528:185:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In a di§erent context, Lewis (2007) shows that the skill mix in US metropolitan areas ap-
36:1741:78399:20:20:82:528:165:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:pears to have an important e§ect on the choice of technology of manufacturing Örms. Further
36:1742:78490:20:20:82:528:145:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:research might shed more systematic light on the empirical conditions under which we may
36:1743:78578:20:20:82:528:125:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:expect greater factor prices and factor scarcity to be an inducement, rather than a deterrent,
36:1744:78672:20:0:82:269:105:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to technology adoption and innovation.
