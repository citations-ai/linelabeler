2:35:1949:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:We propose a network model of firm volatility in which the customers’ growth rate shocks influence
2:36:2047:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:the growth rates of their suppliers, larger suppliers have more customers, and the strength of a customer-supplier
2:37:2161:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:link depends on the size of the customer firm. Even though all shocks are i.i.d., the network model
2:38:2260:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:produces firm-level volatility and size distribution dynamics that are consistent with the data. In the
2:39:2363:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:cross section, larger firms and firms with less concentrated customer networks display lower volatility.
2:40:2467:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:Over time, the volatilities of all firms co-move strongly, and their common factor is concentration
2:41:2566:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:of the economy-wide firm size distribution. Network effects are essential to explaining the joint evolution
2:42:2673:14:42:72:350:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:of the empirical firm size and firm volatility distributions.

3:63:3142:0:34:72:208:708:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:C:1    Introduction
3:64:3159:34:22:72:540:674:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Recent research has explored how the network structure and firm size distribution in an econ-
3:65:3252:22:21:72:540:652:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:omy can influence aggregate volatility. Acemoglu et al. (2012) and Carvalho (2010) show that
3:66:3344:21:22:72:540:631:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sparsity of inter-sector linkages inhibits diversification in an economy and raises aggregate
3:67:3437:22:22:72:540:609:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:volatility.  Gabaix (2011) points out that “granularity,” or extreme skewness in firm sizes,
3:68:3529:22:21:72:540:587:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:concentrates economic mass among a few very large firms, similarly stifling diversification
3:69:3620:21:22:72:250:566:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and increasing aggregate volatility.
3:70:3656:22:22:89:539:544:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:This research is silent about the impact of networks and size concentration on the volatil-
3:71:3747:22:21:72:540:522:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ity of the firm.  The volatility of firm-level stock returns and cash flows varies greatly over
3:72:3842:21:22:72:540:501:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:time (Lee and Engle (1993)) and across firms (Black (1976), Christie (1982), and Davis et
3:73:3931:22:22:72:540:479:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:al.  (2007)).   Such  fluctuations  in  uncertainty  have  important  implications  for  investment
3:74:4030:22:21:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and hiring decisions and firm value, as highlighted by Bloom (2009).1But the underlying
3:75:4117:21:22:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:determinants  of  firm  volatility  are  poorly  understood.   In  much  of  the  work  on  volatility
3:76:4219:22:22:72:540:414:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in economics and finance,  firms are modeled to have heteroscedastic shocks without spec-
3:77:4308:22:21:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ifying  the  source  of  heteroscedasticity.   Our  goal  is  to  understand,  both  theoretically  and
3:78:4411:21:22:72:540:371:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:empirically, how inter-firm linkages and size distributions interact to endogenously produce
3:79:4503:22:22:72:252:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:heteroscedasticity at the firm level.
3:80:4540:22:21:89:539:327:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We propose a simple model in which firms are connected to other firms in a customer-
3:81:4624:21:22:72:540:306:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:supplier  network.   Firms’  idiosyncratic  growth  rate  shocks,  which  are  homoscedastic,  are
3:82:4722:22:22:72:540:284:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:transmitted in part to their trading partners.  Differences in firms’ network connections, and
3:83:4816:22:21:72:540:262:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:evolution of the network over time, impart total firm volatility with cross section and time
3:84:4908:21:22:72:196:241:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:series heteroscedasticity.
3:85:4934:22:22:89:539:219:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Our model has three assumptions.  First, firms’ growth rates are influenced by the growth
3:86:5023:22:21:72:540:197:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rates of their customers.  As a result, the firm-specific shocks propagate through the network
3:87:5117:21:22:72:540:176:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:via connected firms.  Second, the probability of a customer-supplier link depends on the size
3:88:5210:22:22:72:540:154:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of the supplier so that large firms typically supply to a higher number of customers.  Third,
3:89:5303:22:21:72:540:132:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the  importance  of  a  customer-supplier  link  depends  on  the  size  of  the  customer.   Large
3:90:5402:21:18:72:540:111:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:customers have a stronger connection with their suppliers, presumably because they account

3:92:5591:16:0:72:130:77:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:cited therein.
4:93:5606:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for a large fraction of their suppliers’ sales.  We provide microeconomic evidence for all three
4:94:5702:22:22:72:526:686:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:assumptions based on the observed customer-supplier networks among Compustat firms.
4:95:5785:22:21:89:539:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In our model, firms are aggregators of their own idiosyncratic shocks and the shocks to
4:96:5872:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:connected firms.  The sparsity and granularity of a firm’s customer network, which in turn
4:97:5962:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:depend on the firm size distribution, determine how well a firm diversifies the shocks that it
4:98:6056:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is exposed to and thus determine its volatility.  By connecting the firm size distribution to
4:99:6149:21:22:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:network formation, our model generates a rich set of implications for volatility in the cross
4:100:6242:22:22:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:section and the time series, which we can test.  We study data on firm-level sizes, volatilities,
4:101:6339:22:21:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and customer-supplier linkages, establishing a new set of stylized facts about firm volatility
4:102:6433:21:22:72:281:513:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and confirming the model’s implications.
4:103:6473:22:22:89:539:491:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Firm-level  volatilities  exhibit  a  common  factor  structure  where  the  factor  is  firm  size
4:104:6572:22:21:72:540:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dispersion in the economy.  In the model, each supplier’s network is a random draw from the
4:105:6663:21:22:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:entire population of firms, so that any firm’s customer network inherits similar dispersion
4:106:6754:22:22:72:540:426:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to  that  of  the  entire  size  distribution.   An  increase  in  dispersion  slows  down  every  firm’s
4:107:6859:22:21:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:shock diversification and increases their volatility.  In the data, we find that firm volatilities
4:108:6957:21:22:72:540:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:possess  a  strong  factor  structure,  and  we  show  that  size  dispersion  explains  25%  of  the
4:109:7058:22:22:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:variation in (realized) firm volatilities, as much as is explained by average volatility, a natural
4:110:7157:22:21:72:135:339:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:benchmark.2
4:111:7168:21:22:89:539:318:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The factor structure implies strong time series correlations between moments of the size
4:112:7256:22:22:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and volatility distributions.  An increase in the size dispersion translates into higher average
4:113:7352:22:21:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:volatility  among  firms.   It  also  raises  the  cross  section  dispersion  in  volatilities.   In  the
4:114:7458:21:22:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:time series, size dispersion has a 72% correlation with mean firm volatility and 79% with the
4:115:7551:22:22:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dispersion of firm volatility.  Our paper is the first to provide an economic explanation for the
4:116:7648:22:22:72:540:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:factor structure in firm-level volatility by connecting it to firm concentration.  A persistent
4:117:7743:22:21:72:540:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:widening in the firm size dispersion should lead to a persistent rise in mean firm volatility.
4:118:7837:21:22:72:540:166:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We observe such a widening (increase in firm concentration) between the early 1960s and
4:119:7924:22:18:72:540:144:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the late 1990s, providing a new explanation for the trend in mean firm volatility studied by
4:120:8016:18:15:85:539:126:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:2Similarly,  Engle  and  Figlewski  (2012)  document  a  common  factor  in  option-implied  volatilities  since
4:121:8128:15:12:72:540:111:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:1996,  and  Barigozzi,  Brownlees,  Gallo,  and  Veredas  (2010)  and  Veredas  and  Luciani  (2012)  examine  the
4:122:8242:12:12:72:540:99:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:factor structure in realized volatilities of intra-daily returns since 2001.  Bloom, Floetotto, Jaimovich, and

5:127:8622:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the number of a customers and differences in customer size dispersion. First, large firms are
5:128:8718:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:less volatile than small firms because they are connected to more customers, which improves
5:129:8809:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:diversification  regardless  of  the  size  profile  of  its  customer  base.   This  effect  also  appears
5:130:8916:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the volatility factor structure in our model.  Smaller firms have larger exposures to the
5:131:9008:21:22:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:common volatility factor, implying that small firms have both higher levels of volatility and
5:132:9101:22:22:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:higher volatility of volatility.  In the data, doubling a firm’s size lowers its volatility by 32%,
5:133:9200:22:21:72:530:534:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and small firms indeed have higher volatility factor exposures, as predicted by the model.
5:134:9290:21:22:89:539:513:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Second, holding the number of connections fixed, a supplier’s customer network is less
5:135:9376:22:22:72:540:491:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:diversified  if  there  is  more  dispersion  in  the  size  of  its  customers.   Because  customer  size
5:136:9482:22:21:72:540:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:determines the strength of a link, severe customer size disparity means that shocks to the
5:137:9572:21:22:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:biggest  customers  exert  an  outsized  influence  on  the  supplier,  which  raises  the  supplier’s
5:138:9674:22:22:72:540:426:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:volatility.  Differences in customer size disparity arise from probabilistic network formation
5:139:9768:22:21:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:– some suppliers will link to a very large (or very small) customer by chance alone.  The
5:140:9857:21:22:72:540:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:data indeed show a strong negative cross-sectional relationship between firm size and firm
5:141:9947:22:22:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:volatility and a strong positive correlation between a firm’s “out-Herfindahl,” our measure
5:142:10038:22:21:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of concentration in a firm’s customer network,  and its volatility.  The dependence of firm
5:143:10129:21:22:72:540:318:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:volatility on firm size and firm out-Herfindahl survives the inclusion of other determinants
5:144:10221:22:22:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of volatility previously proposed in the empirical literature, including industry concentration
5:145:10316:22:21:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and competition, R&D intensity, equity ownership composition, firm age, and cohort effects.
5:146:10407:21:22:72:492:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Collectively, this evidence supports a network-based explanation of firm volatility.
5:147:10491:22:22:89:539:231:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:A calibrated version of our model matches the data not only qualitatively but also quan-
5:148:10579:22:22:72:540:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:titatively.  We target moments and cross-moments of data on firm size, firm volatility, and
5:149:10670:22:21:72:540:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:inter-firm business linkages.3A benchmark calibration with strong network effects is able to
5:150:10762:21:22:72:540:166:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:account quantitatively for most cross-sectional and aggregate features of the size, volatility,
5:151:10857:22:18:72:540:144:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and  linkage  distributions.   But  it  overstates  the  degree  of  concentration  in  customer  net-
5:152:10959:18:15:85:539:126:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:3While  we  are  able  to  analytically  characterize  volatility  behavior  in  the  large-firm  limit,  ascertaining
5:153:11077:15:12:72:540:111:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:certain  other  model  features  necessitates  a  numerical  simulation  due  to  the  inherent  non-linearity  of  the
5:154:11196:12:12:72:540:99:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:network  and  its  dynamics  (exit  and  entry  of  firms  and  persistence  in  connections).   The  calibration  also
5:155:11315:12:0:72:388:87:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:allows us to confront truncation and selection issues we face in the data.

6:157:11481:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model that allows for internal diversification, for example from operating multiple product
6:158:11572:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:lines, is able to match the observed dispersion in volatility and degree of customer network
6:159:11664:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:concentration, while continuing to match the other size and volatility moments.  We show
6:160:11752:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that to match the joint distribution of volatility and size, we need both internal and external
6:161:11847:22:21:72:268:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(network) diversification in the model.
6:162:11886:21:22:89:539:578:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The  model  displays  substantial  movement  in  aggregate  moments  of  size  and  volatility
6:163:11980:22:22:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:distributions, despite allowing for thousands of firms, because the granular network intro-
6:164:12071:22:21:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:duces strong feedback between the cross-sectional size distribution and firm-level volatility:
6:165:12165:21:22:72:540:513:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:even small shocks to size dispersion have large dynamic volatility effects.  The data display
6:166:12258:22:22:72:540:491:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:similarly  large  fluctuations  as  in  our  model.   Without  network  effects,  our  model  reduces
6:167:12359:22:21:72:540:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to a Gibrat model and implies that the cross-sectional size and volatility distributions are
6:168:12451:21:22:72:225:448:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effectively constant over time.
6:169:12482:22:22:89:539:426:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We build upon a rich literature exploring the role of input-output network linkages for
6:170:12569:22:21:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:aggregate fluctuations, exemplified by Long and Plosser (1987), Carvalho (2010), Foerster,
6:171:12659:21:22:72:540:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Sarte, and Watson (2011), Acemoglu et al. (2012), and Carvalho and Gabaix (2013).  Our
6:172:12745:22:22:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model ties the size distribution to network formation, and shows that network connectivity
6:173:12835:22:21:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is crucial for describing not only aggregate volatility, but the entire distribution of firm-level
6:174:12933:21:22:72:540:318:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:volatility.  We combine the network sparsity insights of Acemoglu et al. (2012) with Gabaix’s
6:175:13026:22:22:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(2011) notion of limited diversification through granularity.  The granularity of the network
6:176:13119:22:21:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is related to the idea that a few large firms account for a large part of aggregate output and
6:177:13213:21:22:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:hence of aggregate volatility.  Our granularity, by operating at the firm level, endogenously
6:178:13306:22:22:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:generates firm-level volatilities rather than taking those as given.  While consistent with the
6:179:13401:22:22:72:540:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:economic structure in these papers, our model differs from earlier work by directly specifying
6:180:13495:22:21:72:540:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the statistical mechanics of inter-firm linkages.  This approach allows us to derive tractable
6:181:13589:21:22:72:540:166:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:analytic statements about firm volatility in large economies while still allowing for rich size
6:182:13684:22:22:72:190:144:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and network dynamics.
6:183:13705:22:21:89:539:122:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The rest of the paper is organized as follows.  Section 2 sets up the network model and
6:184:13792:21:22:72:540:101:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:studies its volatility implications.  It also justifies the modeling assumptions based on micro
6:185:13887:22:0:72:540:79:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:data on firms’ networks.  Section 3 presents macro evidence on the link between the firm size
7:186:13981:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and the firm volatility distributions.  Section 4 calibrates the model and studies its ability to
7:187:14078:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:match the size, volatility, and network data.  The proofs of the theoretical results, auxiliary

7:209:15453:16:12:72:540:132:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:similar to those explored by Menzly, Santos, and Veronesi (2004) and Santos and Veronesi (2006).  In contrast

8:241:17882:12:12:72:540:199:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:emphasizes upstream supply shocks as the only drivers of firm-level volatility, while our model focuses on
8:242:17988:12:8:72:254:187:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:downstream demand shocks as the driver.
8:243:18027:8:16:85:539:179:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:7Since  we  focus  on  propagation  from  customer  to  supplier,  a  question  arises  about  retail  firms  whose
8:244:18142:16:12:72:540:163:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:customers are households.  Because households are not part of the model, this would appear to be a source of
8:245:18250:12:12:72:540:151:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:leakage.  In the data, we also consider retailers who do not have any customer connections with other firms,
8:246:18358:12:12:72:540:139:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:at least not in the standard sense.  Our simple model can be extended to include retailers.  If markets are
8:247:18465:12:11:72:540:127:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:incomplete, then some of the labor income risk that is specific to firms would show up in the consumption
8:248:18570:11:9:72:493:116:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:decisions of workers at these firms, which in turn would expose retail firms to the upstream risk.
8:249:18668:9:15:85:539:107:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:8Shock transmission in the economy is plausibly bi-directional.  We focus on uni-directional transmission
8:250:18773:15:12:72:540:92:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:to clearly highlight the network and size mechanisms of interest.  Our setup is easily generalized, but at the

9:272:19834:22:22:72:540:352:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:qualitative assumption is that the probability of a connection depends on the (relative) size

9:274:20022:21:22:72:436:309:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:have more connections on average.  This is the model’s first size effect.9

11:350:23077:22:21:72:540:333:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:higher  is  its  variance.   A  supplier’s  out-Herfindahl  (and  hence  firm  variance)  is  driven  by
11:351:23181:21:22:72:540:312:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:two features, the number of customers it has and the amount of dispersion in its customers’
11:352:23272:22:22:72:540:290:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sizes.  The supplier is more diversified when it has more customers and when the dispersion
11:353:23363:22:21:72:540:268:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in customer sizes is small.  Because all firms, large and small, draw their connections from the
11:354:23459:21:22:72:540:247:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:same economy-wide size distribution, their customer networks have equal size dispersion in
11:355:23549:22:22:72:540:225:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:expectation.  In our model, the key difference in the network structure across suppliers is the
11:356:23644:22:21:72:539:203:12:g_d0_f15:12:g_d0_f2:B:numberof customers they have, which depends on the supplier’s size through the Bernoulli
11:357:23732:21:22:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:probability function.  This commonality in network concentration naturally leads to a factor

13:438:26301:42:22:89:539:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:This proposition highlights the determinants of firm-level growth rate variance in a large
13:439:26391:22:21:71:539:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:economy.  First, firm variance depends on economy-wide firm size dispersionE[S2]/E[S]2,
13:440:26478:21:22:71:539:426:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:familiar from Lemma 1.  Overall size dispersion acts as a common factor across all volatilities,
13:441:26574:22:22:71:539:404:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:since more size dispersion makes every supplier less diversified,  and this has ripple effects
13:442:26668:22:21:71:539:382:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:through the higher order terms (customers’ customer networks are also less diversified, and
13:443:26759:21:22:71:525:361:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:so on).  Asγapproaches one, these higher order terms become quantitatively important.
13:444:26844:22:22:89:539:339:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Relative firm size, ̃Si, appears in two terms.  Its primary role is in the first coefficient on
13:445:26939:22:21:71:539:317:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f2:B:E[S2]/E[S]2.  Intuitively, larger firms have a lower exposure to the common size dispersion
13:446:27030:21:22:71:539:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:factor than do smaller firms because they typically connect to more customers, achieve better
13:447:27123:22:22:71:539:274:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:shock diversification, and display lower volatility.  Smaller factor exposure also makes large
13:448:27217:22:21:71:539:252:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:firms  less  sensitive  to  fluctuations  in  the  firm  size  dispersion;  that  is,  they  display  lower
13:449:27324:21:22:71:182:231:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:volatility of volatility.
13:450:27349:22:22:89:539:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The firm’s relative size also appears in the numerator of the last term.  Shocks to the
13:451:27436:22:21:71:539:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:largest firms are the most strongly propagated shocks in the model since these firms have the
13:452:27529:21:22:71:539:166:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:largest influence on their suppliers.  These shocks feed back into large firms’ own volatility
13:453:27623:22:22:71:539:144:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:while, in contrast, small firms’ shocks die out relatively quickly in the network.  Thus, the
13:454:27716:22:21:71:539:122:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:last term in Proposition 1 captures a countervailing increase in volatility for larger firms.  In
13:455:27813:21:22:71:496:101:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:all of our numerical results, we find that the effect of the first size term dominates.
13:456:27900:22:0:89:540:79:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, the variance of firm variance decays at rateN1−ζ, showing the dominance ofHi’s
14:457:27989:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effect on total volatility.  The dependence of volatility’s decay rate onζcaptures the effect of
14:458:28085:22:22:72:539:686:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:network sparsity.  Highζmeans that there are relatively few linkages compared to the size

14:460:28240:21:22:89:539:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Thus far we have assumed that the firm size distribution has finite variance, thus the slow
14:461:28331:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:volatility decay in Proposition 1 arises only due to network sparsity.  Gabaix (2011) empha-

14:464:28606:22:22:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:nism to further slow down volatility decay beyond Gabaix’s (2011) granularity mechanism,
14:465:28694:22:31:72:409:534:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:which depends on the power law behavior of the size distribution.

16:524:31719:29:22:72:540:635:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In the literature,  idiosyncratic volatility is typically constructed by first removing the ag-

16:527:31999:21:22:72:540:570:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ours, such a factor regression approach is misspecified.  There is no dimension-reducing com-

16:529:32183:22:21:72:540:526:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:firm’s shock may be systematic.  A sign of the misspecification of the factor model is that the
16:530:32278:21:22:72:540:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:residuals exhibit a volatility factor structure that looks very similar to the factor structure

16:537:32770:22:22:89:539:323:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Our data for annual firm-level linkages come from Compustat.  It includes the fraction of

16:548:33810:15:12:71:539:124:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:sales, and this is occasionally observed.  In our data, 23% of firms report at least one customer that accounts
16:549:33921:12:8:71:196:112:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:for less that 10% of its sales.

17:554:34309:22:22:72:436:686:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:B.1 provides more details and summary statistics on the network data.
17:555:34378:22:21:89:539:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The first size assumption in the model is that suppliers have stronger connections with
17:556:34465:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:their larger customers.  This is a prominent feature of the data.  Specifically, for each supplier
17:557:34563:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f2:B:iin the Compustat data, we calculate the correlation between its customers’ total sales (Sj,t)
17:558:34657:22:21:72:539:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and the fraction ofi’s revenue that is due to each customer (wi,j,t).  We then average across all
17:559:34754:21:22:72:539:578:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:suppliers in a given year, and finally average across all years.  We also compute at-statistic
17:560:34848:22:22:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:equal  to  the  ratio  of  the  time  series  mean  of  the  correlation  to  its  time-series  standard
17:561:34952:22:21:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:deviation.   In  an  average  year,  that  correlation  is  20%  (t=  3.6).   The  correlation  is  19%
17:562:35055:21:22:72:413:513:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:when we limit ourselves to only use links that exceed 10% of sales.
17:563:35122:22:22:89:539:491:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Our  second  size  assumption  is  that  larger  suppliers  are  connected  to  more  customers
17:564:35217:22:21:72:540:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on  average  (higherNi).   The  Compustat  data  cannot  speak  directly  to  this  assumption
17:565:35311:21:22:72:539:448:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:due to the truncation of all linkages whose weights fall below 10%.13To address this,  we
17:566:35400:22:22:72:540:426:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:simulate a calibrated version of our model and estimate the correlation between supplier size
17:567:35493:22:21:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and out-degree in both the full simulated sample and the simulated sample while imposing
17:568:35581:21:22:72:540:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the  10%  weight  truncation.   We  find  that  truncation  produces  a  downward  bias  in  the
17:569:35677:22:22:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:correlation estimate of 19 to 27 percentage points depending on the calibration.  Since the
17:570:35768:22:21:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:measured correlation in the actual (truncated) data is 3%, the bias-adjusted estimate is 22%

17:572:35948:22:22:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a connection is independent of customer size (the truncation-adjusted correlation between
17:573:36037:22:21:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:customer size and number of suppliers is 4% in the data).  We discuss these points further
17:574:36127:21:22:72:136:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in Section 4.

17:576:36228:22:22:72:539:209:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:so for comparison we test the correlation between size and out-degree at the industry level.14
17:577:36322:22:21:72:540:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We find a 61% correlation between the size of a supplier industry and the number of industries
17:578:36416:21:22:72:539:166:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f7:B:that it sells to.  We also find a 37% correlation between the size of the customer industrySj,t

17:580:36544:19:15:81:539:125:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:13For example, a small firm that has a single customer accounting for 100% of its revenue can show up as
17:581:36648:15:9:72:540:110:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:having more links than a firm with 11 equally important customers with weights of 9.1% due to truncation.
17:582:36753:9:15:81:539:101:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:14We use the BEA’s input-output tables for the 65-industry breakdown of the US economy between 1998

18:588:37045:30:21:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We  conduct  our  analysis  using  stock  market  data  from  CRSP  over  the  period  1926–2010
18:589:37141:21:22:72:540:558:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and using cash flow data from CRSP/Compustat over 1952–2010.  We consider market and
18:590:37225:22:22:72:540:536:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:fundamental  measures  of  firm  size  and  firm  volatility  calculated  at  the  annual  frequency.
18:591:37326:22:21:72:540:514:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:For size,  we use equity market value at the end of the calendar year or total sales within

18:593:37518:22:22:72:540:471:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:returns during the calendar year.  Fundamental volatility in yeartis defined as the standard

18:596:37718:22:22:89:540:406:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In the data, size and volatility are well approximated by a lognormal distribution.17As a
18:597:37807:22:21:72:540:384:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:result, the dynamics of each distribution may be summarized with two moments:  the cross
18:598:37895:21:22:72:540:363:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:section mean and standard deviation of the log quantities.  We now examine the dynamics
18:599:37982:22:44:72:211:341:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of these moments in detail.

18:603:38249:21:22:72:540:225:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The correlation between average volatility and the market-based measure of size dispersion is
18:604:38342:22:22:72:540:203:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:71.7%.  Mean firm volatility experienced several large swings in the past century, especially
18:605:38435:22:21:72:540:181:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in  the  1920s  and  1930s  and  again  in  the  last  two  decades  of  the  sample.   These  changes
18:606:38537:21:18:72:540:160:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are preceded by similar dynamics in the cross-sectional dispersion of firm size.  The close
18:607:38628:18:12:81:394:142:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:15All variables in our analysis are deflated by the consumer price index.
18:608:38701:12:16:81:539:130:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:16We also consider fundamental volatility measured by the standard deviation of quarterly sales growth
18:609:38803:16:12:72:540:114:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:within  a  single  calendar  year.   The  one-  and  five-year  fundamental  volatility  estimates  are  qualitatively
18:610:38921:12:8:72:453:102:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:identical, though the one-year measure is noisier because it uses only four observations.
18:611:39010:8:0:81:498:94:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:17Detailed distributional statistics for the CRSP/Compustat sample are available upon request.

19:629:39584:46:22:72:509:396:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:association between mean volatility and size dispersion is predicted by Proposition 1.
19:630:39670:22:22:89:539:374:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Proposition 1 links not only the mean volatility, but also dispersion in firms’ volatility, to
19:631:39764:22:21:72:540:352:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dispersion of log firm size.  Figure 2 shows a strong association between firm volatility and
19:632:39857:21:22:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:firm size dispersion, based on the market measures.  The correlation between the two time-
19:633:39947:22:22:72:540:309:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:series is 79.3%.  Appendix B.2 shows that the positive correlation between size dispersion and
19:634:40041:22:21:72:540:287:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:average volatility holds both at low and business cycle frequencies, based on HP filter trend
19:635:40134:21:22:72:540:266:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and cycle components of these time series.  Appendix B.3 reports formal Granger causality
19:636:40223:22:22:72:540:244:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tests showing that size dispersion leads mean and dispersion of the volatility distribution.
19:637:40315:22:21:72:540:222:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:These tests are useful for establishing that the time-series connection is statistically large
19:638:40409:21:22:72:263:201:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and not driven by trends in the data.
19:639:40446:22:22:89:539:179:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:It  is  important  to  note  that  the  same  relationship  between  the  moments  of  the  firm
19:640:40542:22:21:72:540:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:size and firm volatility distributions exists for our sales-based measures.  Figure 3 shows a
19:641:40635:21:22:72:540:136:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:correlation of 85.5% between mean volatility and lagged firm size dispersion.  Because the
19:642:40725:22:22:72:540:114:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sales-based data only start in the 1960s, their dynamics are more affected by the persistent

21:691:43194:22:22:72:540:374:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:firm size dispersion and the moments of the volatility distribution holds both among young
21:692:43284:22:21:72:540:352:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:firms and firms that have been publicly listed for decades.  It holds both before and after
21:693:43375:21:22:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:1980.   It  holds  within  all  industries  and  for  the  NASDAQ  subsample  (a  large  fraction  of
21:694:43476:22:22:72:540:309:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:post-1980 IPOs were on NASDAQ and/or in the technology sector).  Table 1 demonstrates
21:695:43561:22:21:72:540:287:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that the positive correlations between firm size dispersion and both the mean and dispersion
21:696:43653:21:22:72:540:266:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of firm variance are robust to sample composition.  These correlations hold across 10 broad
21:697:43744:22:22:72:540:244:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:industries,  across  size  terciles,  for  NYSE  firms  and  non-NYSE  firms,  for  firms  that  have
21:698:43845:22:21:72:540:222:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:been publicly listed at least 50 years,  and for random samples of 500 firms.  Hence,  these
21:699:43937:21:22:72:513:201:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:correlations are unlikely to be driven by changes in the nature of publicly listed firms.
21:700:44026:22:22:89:539:179:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We also find that the dynamics of both firm size dispersion and firm volatility dispersion
21:701:44116:22:21:72:540:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are similar for publicly listed and privately held firms.  We use three data sets to corroborate
21:702:44212:21:22:72:540:136:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this claim.  First, using Census data, we document that the dispersion in the log size distribu-
21:703:44308:22:22:72:540:114:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tion, where size is measured by number of employees, displays similar dynamics for publicly
21:704:44399:22:0:72:540:92:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:listed and privately held firms.  The two series have a correlation of 65%.  Second, using data

22:729:45249:10:9:72:540:294:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:based measure of size (market equity).  The first column reports the time series average of the cross section number of firms.
22:730:45375:9:10:72:540:285:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:The second column reports the time-series correlation between the size dispersion of the sub-cross section and the dispersion of

22:733:45757:47:22:72:540:219:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:provided by Bloom et al. (2012), we find a strong positive correlation between stock return
22:734:45848:22:22:72:540:197:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and sales growth volatility of publicly listed firms and the volatility of log productivity and

22:738:46218:22:21:72:540:110:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:firms, we again find strong positive correlations between the time series of size dispersion,
22:739:46311:21:0:72:540:89:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mean volatility, and volatility dispersion for public and for private firms.  The correlations
23:740:46407:0:22:72:493:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:range from 55% to 91%.  Appendix B.4 provides data sources and detailed results.
23:741:46487:22:22:89:539:686:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Our results focus on data for publicly listed firms because these are the firms for which
23:742:46576:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we observe customer-supplier network relationships.  The key stylized facts linking the size
23:743:46668:21:44:72:522:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and volatility distributions hold broadly and are not an artifact of public firm selection.
23:744:46759:44:29:72:297:599:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:3.4    Volatility Factor Structure
23:745:46793:29:22:72:540:570:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Recent research has documented a puzzling degree of common variation in the panel of firm-
23:746:46883:22:21:72:540:548:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:level volatilities.  Kelly, Lustig, and Nieuwerburgh (2012) show that firm-level stock return
23:747:46976:21:22:72:540:527:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:volatilities share a single common factor that explains roughly 35% of the variation in log
23:748:47067:22:22:72:539:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:volatilities  for  the  entire  panel  of  CRSP  stocks.   ThisR2is  nearly  twice  as  high  for  the
23:749:47169:22:21:72:540:483:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:100  Fama-French  portfolios.   They  also  show  that  this  strong  factor  structure  is  not  only
23:750:47271:21:22:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a feature of return volatilities, but also of sales growth volatilities.  The puzzling aspect of
23:751:47367:22:22:72:540:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:this result is that the factor structure remains nearly completely intact after removing all
23:752:47459:22:21:72:540:418:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:common variation in returns or sales growth rates.  Hence, common volatility dynamics are
23:753:47548:21:22:72:455:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:unlikely to be driven by an omitted common return or sales growth factor.
23:754:47621:22:22:89:539:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The  granular  network  model  predicts  a  high  degree  of  comovement  in  firm  volatility.
23:755:47716:22:21:72:540:353:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Proposition 1 shows an approximate factor structure among the volatilities of all firms, and
23:756:47808:21:22:72:540:332:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:suggests  that  concentration  of  the  lagged  economy-wide  size  distribution  is  the  appropri-
23:757:47908:22:22:72:540:310:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ate  factor.   Furthermore,  as  discussed  in  Section  2.5,  if  the  true  data  generating  process
23:758:48011:22:21:72:540:288:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is a network model,  then factor model residual volatilities will possess a similar degree of
23:759:48104:21:22:72:540:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:comovement as total volatilities, despite residual growth rates themselves being nearly un-
23:760:48195:22:22:72:126:245:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:correlated.
23:761:48206:22:21:89:539:223:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Panel A of Table 2 shows results of panel volatility regressions for three different factor
23:762:48297:21:22:72:540:202:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:models.  The left three columns use the volatility of total returns and total sales growth rates,
23:763:48394:22:22:72:540:180:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:while the right three columns use residual volatilities.  Residual volatilities are calculated in a
23:764:48493:22:21:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:one factor model regression of stock returns (sales growth rates) on the value-weighted market
23:765:48587:21:22:72:540:137:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:return (sales-weighted average growth rate).  In both cases, residuals have average pairwise
23:766:48679:22:22:72:540:115:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:correlations that are below 2% in absolute value, despite the original series having average
23:767:48771:22:21:72:540:93:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:correlations  over  25%  on  average.   Columns  (1)  and  (4)  consider  the  dispersion  of  lagged
23:768:48872:21:0:72:540:72:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:log market-based firm size as a factor.  Columns (2) and (5) consider the lagged weighted-
24:769:48964:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:average volatility.  This lagged cross-sectional average volatility is a natural benchmark for
24:770:49058:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:factor model comparison because it is essentially a first principal component of volatilities
24:771:49151:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and  because  the  lag  maintains  a  comparable  timing  with  the  conditioning  factor  implied
24:772:49249:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by our model.  The third column instead uses the contemporaneous average volatility as a
24:773:49337:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:factor.  Because it uses finer conditioning information, it can be considered an upper bound
24:774:49429:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on the explanatory power of a single factor.  We report panelR2values based on each factor.
24:775:49520:21:22:89:539:578:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Lagged size dispersion has the same degree of explanatory power as lagged average volatil-
24:776:49610:22:22:71:539:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ity.  Both factors capture about 25% of the panel variation in return volatility.  The contem-
24:777:49704:22:21:71:539:534:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:poraneous mean volatility explains closer to 40% of the variation.  The results for sales-based
24:778:49799:21:22:71:539:513:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:volatility are similar: our size dispersion factor explains about 22% of the panel variation,
24:779:49892:22:22:71:539:491:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:close to the 23% and 24% for the lagged and contemporaneous average volatility factor.  We
24:780:49982:22:21:71:398:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:find the same results using volatilities of factor model residuals.
24:781:50049:21:22:89:539:448:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The model also predicts that larger firms have lower loadings on the size dispersion factor,
24:782:50141:22:22:71:539:426:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:which lowers the level of their volatilities relative to small firms, and also lowers their time-
24:783:50238:22:21:71:539:404:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:series volatility of volatility.  Panel B of Table 2 shows the loading of firm volatility on each
24:784:50335:21:22:71:539:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:factor, averaged within each quintile of the firm size distribution.  Small firms have loadings
24:785:50430:22:22:71:539:361:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that are 50% larger on the factor than large firms.  Panel C shows that the common factor
24:786:50519:22:21:71:539:339:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:explains  a  larger  share  of  the  volatility  dynamics  of  small  firms  than  that  of  large  firms.
24:787:50625:21:22:71:539:318:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Large  firms  have  lower  levels  of  volatility  and  also  less  variation  in  volatility.   Table  2  is
24:788:50734:22:22:71:539:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:consistent with the model’s prediction that dispersion in firm sizes predicts the entire panel
24:789:50828:22:43:71:192:274:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of firm-level volatilities.

25:825:53336:21:22:71:539:207:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:our model, we find that the two most important determinants of volatility are size and out-
25:826:53427:22:22:71:539:185:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Herfindahl.  Doubling the size of a firm decreases its volatility by between 12% and 16%.
25:827:53516:22:21:71:539:163:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:An  increase  of  customer  Herfindahl  from  zero  to  one  increases  volatility  by  88%  without
25:828:53616:21:22:71:539:142:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:controlling  for  size;  the  effect  is  17%  when  we  control  for  size.   Note  that  in  our  model
25:829:53721:22:22:71:539:120:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:size  and  network  concentration  convey  similar  information  since  size  determines  network
25:830:53818:22:18:71:539:98:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:structure.   Within  our  network  model,  a  supplier’s  size  and  its  customer  Herfindahl  are

26:834:54209:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of the true network concentration effect.  Nevertheless,  the table provides strong evidence
26:835:54301:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that network concentration matters separately for firm volatility and survives the inclusion
26:836:54393:22:22:72:382:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of other well-known volatility determinants such as firm age.

26:842:54856:30:21:72:540:461:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In  an  influential  paper,  Campbell  et  al.  (2001)  highlight  the  rise  in  firm-level  volatility
26:843:54960:21:22:72:540:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:among publicly traded firms between the 1960s and 1990s.  Indeed, our data confirm that
26:844:55047:22:22:72:540:418:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the volatility of firm-level stock returns has increased from an average of 26% per year in
26:845:55138:22:21:72:540:396:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the 1950s to 63% per year since 1990.  This increase is also present in volatilities of residuals
26:846:55235:21:22:72:540:375:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from a factor model for returns.  The increase in total and residual firm volatility has puzzled
26:847:55331:22:22:72:540:353:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:financial economists, who have offered both “real” and “financial” explanations.  Our stylized
26:848:55425:22:22:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:facts about the joint distribution of volatility and size, which manifest themselves similarly
26:849:55519:22:21:72:540:309:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in both fundamental and market volatility measures, seem to point in the direction of a real
26:850:55611:21:22:72:275:288:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:explanation rather than a financial one.
26:851:55651:22:22:89:539:266:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Our model predicts that average volatility should trend upward if size dispersion is doing

28:858:57954:34:22:72:540:674:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Section  3  documents  a  strong  statistical  association  between  the  distributions  of  size  and
28:859:58056:22:21:72:540:652:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:volatility  that  matches  the  qualitative  predictions  of  our  model.   In  this  section  we  ask
28:860:58158:21:22:72:540:631:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:whether our model can provide a successful quantitative description of the joint distribu-

28:862:58342:22:21:72:540:587:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:calibration allows us to address certain limitations that we face in our data, such as biases
28:863:58435:21:22:72:540:566:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:arising from public firm selection or truncation of weights below 10%.  It also allows us to
28:864:58527:22:22:72:540:544:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:add further realism to the model by building in entry and exit and introducing persistence
28:865:58617:22:21:72:540:522:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in connections (each of these features introduces challenges for an analytical description of
28:866:58710:21:22:72:540:501:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:firm volatility).  The model starts from an initial firm size distribution, but both the firm
28:867:58803:22:22:72:420:479:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:size and firm volatility distributions evolve endogenously thereafter.
28:868:58873:22:21:89:539:457:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:We show that our simple model with purely homoscedastic shocks goes a long way towards
28:869:58959:21:22:72:540:436:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:matching the cross-sectional dispersion in firm size and volatility as well as matching the

28:871:59153:22:21:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of  the  model  are  also  informative:  the  benchmark  version  requires  more  concentration  in
28:872:59252:21:22:72:540:371:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:customer networks than we see in the data in order to fully match the volatility cross section
28:873:59346:22:22:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and the sensitivity of firm volatility to size.  Therefore, we also study a second model that
28:874:59439:22:21:72:540:327:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:allows for internal diversification within the boundaries of the firm, compared to the external

28:882:59941:22:22:72:540:100:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:while the latter corresponds to the full-sample growth rate in real market capitalization.  The

31:961:64860:30:21:71:539:490:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We  simulate  our  model  for  2,000  firms  and  1,300  periods  (years).   We  discard  the  first
31:962:64960:21:22:71:539:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:300 observations to let the network settle down to its long run distribution, and compute
31:963:65049:22:22:71:539:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model statistics by averaging over the last 1,000 years.  In each period, we report moments
31:964:65140:22:21:71:539:425:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:based on the sample of the largest 1,000 firms.  We focus on the largest firms to account
31:965:65229:21:22:71:539:404:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for selection:  our Compustat sample is the subset of public firms, which are typically the
31:966:65320:22:22:71:539:382:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:largest firms in the economy, and these firms are connected to a large number of unobserved
31:967:65411:22:21:71:539:360:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:smaller firms.  Our choice of a total number ofN= 2,000 firms is dictated by computational
31:968:65501:21:22:71:155:339:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:considerations.23
31:969:65518:22:22:89:539:317:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The number of public firms in our data sample fluctuates over time, but our calibration
31:970:65605:22:21:71:539:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:considers a constant sample of 1,000 public firms.  To further improve comparability between
31:971:65697:21:22:71:539:274:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the model and data, we focus on the top 33% of Compustat firms by size, which in our data
31:972:65786:22:22:71:539:252:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:contains 1,000 firms on average.  For completeness, we also report the empirical moments for
31:973:65878:22:21:71:426:230:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the entire distribution of public firms (about 3,000 firms on average).
31:974:65949:21:22:89:539:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Our simulated model is well suited to deal with truncation.  We implement the truncation
31:975:66037:22:22:71:540:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:inside the model to match the truncation of the data.  That is, we treatwi,j,tas unobserved

31:977:66214:21:22:71:539:144:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:untruncated moments of the model as calibrated to the data, we are able to make indirect
31:978:66302:22:18:71:396:122:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:inferences about the behavior of the full, untruncated economy.
31:979:66365:18:16:81:539:104:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:23The same random number generator seeds are used for each model so that,  when comparing models,
31:980:66462:16:0:72:540:88:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:differences in results are due only to differences in parameters rather than differences in random shock draws.

32:982:66670:22:44:72:421:686:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:account the fact that empirical variances are estimated with noise.24

32:984:66788:29:22:72:540:613:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Below,  we  outline  the  features  of  the  observed  size,  volatility,  and  network  data  that  we
32:985:66891:22:38:72:474:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:target in our calibration and discuss how well the benchmark model fits them.

32:987:66994:30:21:72:540:523:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Table 5 reports the target moments of the cross-sectional log size distribution.  All reported
32:988:67088:21:22:72:540:502:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:moments are time-series averages over the 1926-2010 sample for size and volatility data, and
32:989:67180:22:22:72:540:480:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:over 1980-2010 for sales network data.  The first column reports moments for the full cross
32:990:67271:22:21:72:540:458:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:section of firms observed in Compustat.  The second column reports results for the top 33%
32:991:67361:21:22:72:540:437:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of Compustat firms by size in each year.  Column (2) is the main column of interest in the
32:992:67451:22:22:72:540:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:data.  For example, 11.63 is the average log firm size of the large-firm cross section (this is
32:993:67546:22:21:72:540:393:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:naturally higher than the 9.61 mean for the full Compustat sample).  The dispersion of the
32:994:67636:21:22:72:540:372:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:log size distribution is 1.06 for the top-33% group and 1.79 for the full sample.  As can be
32:995:67728:22:22:72:540:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:seen from column (3), the benchmark model (M1) matches the main moments of the firm
32:996:67811:22:21:72:540:328:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:size distribution.  It matches the cross section mean and dispersion in size exactly, by virtue
32:997:67906:21:22:72:540:307:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of  the  calibration.   The  other  moments  of  the  size  distribution  constitute  over-identifying
32:998:68008:22:22:72:540:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:restrictions.  The inter-quartile range for log firm size is [10.79,12.25],  versus [10.78,12.25]
32:999:68105:22:21:72:540:263:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the top-33% sample.  At both extremes of the size distribution, the model also compares
32:1000:68195:21:22:72:540:242:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:favorably to the data.  Since the size distribution evolves endogenously, the network effects
32:1001:68288:22:22:72:540:220:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are crucial to generate enough heterogeneity in firm size. Firms with well-diversified customer

33:1014:69520:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:time.  In the benchmark model,  size dispersion also moves around substantially over time
33:1015:69609:21:22:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and is highly persistent.  The model produces the same high time-series variability in the

33:1028:70746:22:21:72:540:271:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:full cross-section.  Average sales-based volatility is 24% for the large-firm sample and 30%
33:1029:70838:21:22:72:540:250:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for the full sample.  The range of return-based (sales-based) volatilities goes from 17% (8%)

33:1032:71116:21:22:72:540:185:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reported in column (1).  Sales-based volatility has even larger dispersion of 152% and 142%

35:1102:75474:12:12:72:540:248:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:the square root.  Column (5) reports the corresponding moments for the benchmark model M1.  Column (6)
35:1103:75576:12:12:72:540:236:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:reports the moments for the extended model M2.  Log variances in the model are constructed with added
35:1104:75677:12:47:72:385:224:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:estimation noise to make them comparable to the moments in the data.

35:1109:76118:21:0:72:540:91:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:between variance and size is slightly smaller than that in the data (−18% versus−23% for
36:1110:76208:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the largest firms).  Given i.i.d.  shocks, the negative correlation arises endogenously from the
36:1111:76304:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:network effect:  smaller firms have fewer connections, hence a more concentrated network of
36:1112:76395:22:21:72:236:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:customers, and higher volatility.
36:1113:76428:21:22:89:539:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Panel C reports time series properties of aggregate moments of the volatility distribution
36:1114:76518:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and the joint size-volatility distribution.  The first row shows that the time-series standard
36:1115:76612:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:deviation of average firm variance is 64% in the top-33% sample and 69% in the full sample.
36:1116:76703:21:22:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Average variance is highly variable over time.  The second row shows that the cross-sectional
36:1117:76796:22:22:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dispersion of variance also moves substantially over time in both samples and for both ways
36:1118:76887:22:21:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of measuring volatility.  The time series standard deviation is 12% in the top-33% sample.
36:1119:76977:21:22:72:540:513:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The  model  also  generates  substantial  variability  over  time  in  the  cross-sectional  mean  of
36:1120:77078:22:22:72:540:491:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:firm variance (20%) and in its dispersion (5%).  The third and fourth rows report two key

36:1122:77259:21:22:72:539:448:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dispersion attand mean volatility at timet+ 1 are strongly positively correlated in the data
36:1123:77351:22:22:71:539:426:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(72% in the full sample and 55% in the large-firm sample) as well as in the model (95%).
36:1124:77439:22:21:71:539:404:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Second, size dispersion is strongly positively correlated with volatility dispersion in the data
36:1125:77535:21:22:71:539:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(79% in the full sample and 76% in the large-firm sample) as well as in the model (77%).
36:1126:77623:22:22:71:539:361:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The last row reports the volatility of aggregate growth, computed as the volatility of the size-
36:1127:77719:22:21:71:539:339:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:weighted average of the relevant firm sample, which is 21% for all public firms and 20% for
36:1128:77810:21:22:71:539:318:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the top-33% sample.  It also is 20% in the model.  The model produces substantial time series
36:1129:77903:22:22:71:539:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:volatility of the cross section moments, though it is somewhat understated in some cases.  All
36:1130:77997:22:21:71:539:274:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:fluctuations in the volatility distribution rely crucially on the network structure of the model.
36:1131:78094:21:22:71:539:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:As with the size distribution, shutting down network effects in the simulations produces a
36:1132:78184:22:22:71:539:231:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:volatility distribution whose moments are nearly constant over time.  Thus, our model with
36:1133:78274:22:22:71:539:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:only i.i.d. homoscedastic shocks endogenously generates periods with more uncertainty and
36:1134:78363:22:21:71:539:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:periods with less uncertainty.  “High uncertainty” periods are associated with a high level of
36:1135:78457:21:22:71:288:166:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:concentration in the firm size distribution.
36:1136:78501:22:22:89:539:144:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, we re-estimate the volatility factor regressions of Table 2 on simulated data from
36:1137:78592:22:21:71:540:122:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the model.  The correspondingR2statistics for panel regressions of total volatility are 36%,
36:1138:78684:21:22:71:539:101:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:37%,  and  40%  for  the  three  factors  considered  in  that  table  (from  left  to  right).   These
36:1139:78787:22:0:71:539:79:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:numbers are quite close to their empirical counterparts of 24%, 26%, and 39%.  Thus, the

38:1176:80892:22:21:71:539:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:supplier-customer relationships after truncation:  the median is 1.71 in the model and 1.00

38:1185:81729:22:21:72:540:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:data.  The reasons are that in M1 suppliers typically have a small number of connections
38:1186:81817:21:22:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and  the  weighting  function  is  linear  in  customer  size,  making  large  customers  extremely

38:1188:82017:22:21:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in a setting with only uncorrelated shocks,  the model requires too much concentration in
38:1189:82106:21:22:72:529:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:customer networks.  The extended model M2 discussed below addresses this shortcoming.
38:1190:82191:22:22:89:539:361:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The fifth row of Panel A reports the correlation between out-degree and supplier size.  As
38:1191:82281:22:21:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:discussed in Section 2.6, we find a nearly zero correlation between truncated out-degree and
38:1192:82373:21:22:72:540:318:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:size in the data.  Because of truncation in the network data, the zero correlation based on

38:1194:82558:22:21:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:out-degrees.  Our simulation results show that large firms have many more connections than
38:1195:82648:21:22:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:small firms, with a cross-sectional correlation of 34% between the truncated out-degree and

38:1202:83247:15:16:81:539:107:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:26To the extent the data permit, Appendix B.1 discusses the effect of truncation on the distributions of
38:1203:83351:16:0:72:300:91:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:the out-degrees and the out-Herfindahls in the data.
39:1204:83405:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:correlations of the out-Herfindahl with size and of the out-Herfindahl with variance.  The
39:1205:83495:22:22:72:539:686:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model generates a strong negative correlation between out-degree Herfindahl and size (−71%)
39:1206:83586:22:21:71:539:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and a positive correlation between out-degree Herfindahl and volatility (54%), arising because
39:1207:83680:21:22:71:539:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:large firms have better diversified and thus less concentrated customer bases.  In the data, we
39:1208:83775:22:22:71:539:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:find a−31% correlation between size and out-Herfindahl.  We also find a positive relationship
39:1209:83868:22:21:71:539:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:between supplier log variance and out-Herfindahl:  the correlation is 15% based on returns
39:1210:83958:21:22:71:539:578:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and  29%  based  on  sales.   That  is,  firms  with  a  more  diversified  customer  network  indeed
39:1211:84059:22:22:71:539:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:experience lower volatility because they are better insulated against a shock to any single
39:1212:84150:22:21:71:539:534:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:customer.  Appendix B.1 shows that these three correlations are statistically significant at
39:1213:84242:21:22:71:540:513:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the 1% level.  Similar to the firm-level evidence, it also finds a−39% correlation between an
39:1214:84335:22:22:71:539:491:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:industry’s log size and its out-Herfindahl and a 22% correlation between its out-Herfindahl
39:1215:84426:22:38:71:160:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and log volatility.

39:1217:84530:22:22:71:540:409:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in-degree, is 1 while the 99thpercentile is 17 or 32 depending on the data sample.  In the
39:1218:84620:22:21:71:540:387:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:benchmark model, the median in-degree is 1.90 and the 99thpercentile is between 6 and 8.
39:1219:84708:21:22:72:540:366:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Concentration  of  supplier  networks  is  lower  than  that  of  customer  networks,  but  still  too
39:1220:84810:22:22:72:200:344:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:high relative to the data.
39:1221:84836:22:21:89:539:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f6:A:In the model, the probability that a connection exists between supplieriand customerj
39:1222:84921:21:22:72:539:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:depends only oni’s size and is independent of firmj’s size.  Thus, the model predicts a zero
39:1223:85013:22:22:72:539:279:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:correlation between size and in-degree in theabsenceof link truncation.  While we assume
39:1224:85101:22:21:72:540:257:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:smaller  firms  are  equally  likely  to  be  customers  as  large  firms,  truncation  will  eliminate
39:1225:85204:21:22:72:540:236:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the  links  with  small  customers,  leaving  large  firms  counted  as  customers  far  more  often.
39:1226:85305:22:22:72:540:214:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Thus  we  expect  to  see  a  strong  association  between  size  and  in-degree  in  the  truncated
39:1227:85405:22:21:72:540:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:data  (we  find  a  correlation  of  37%).   Indeed,  the  benchmark  model  M1  produces  a  49%
39:1228:85502:21:22:72:540:171:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:correlation between size and in-degree when the simulated samples are truncated.  However,
39:1229:85592:22:22:72:539:149:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the correlation betweenuntruncatedin-degree and size is 4%, which implies that the 37%
39:1230:85678:22:21:72:540:127:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:correlation estimate in the data is severely upward biased by truncation.  The magnitude
39:1231:85766:21:22:72:539:106:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of  the  bias  is  such  that  the  bias-corrected  correlation  betweenuntruncatedin-degree  and
39:1232:85863:22:0:72:540:84:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:log size in the data is close to zero for both data samples, and provides evidence that the
40:1233:85956:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:likelihood of a connection between a supplier and a customer does not depend strongly on
40:1234:86044:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the customer’s size, as assumed in our model.  Finally, we find a modestly positive correlation
40:1235:86139:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:between in-Herfindahl and both measures of volatility, though these estimates are statistically
40:1236:86234:21:39:72:383:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:insignificant in the data (t-statistics shown in the appendix).

40:1238:86363:29:22:72:540:575:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The benchmark model calibration with only external (network) diversification implies too
40:1239:86451:22:22:72:540:553:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:much concentration and fails to generate enough dispersion in firm volatility.  The extended
40:1240:86543:22:21:72:539:531:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:model  (M2)  with  internal  diversification  jointly  matches  size,  volatility,andnetwork  mo-
40:1241:86640:21:22:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ments.  This model can generate a wider firm volatility spread than the benchmark model
40:1242:86727:22:22:72:540:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:while continuing to generate a firm size distribution that is similar to the data.  In partic-
40:1243:86821:22:21:72:540:466:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ular, M2 generates time-series correlations between firm size dispersion and the mean and
40:1244:86910:21:22:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dispersion of firm variance that are qualitatively similar to the data.  Average firm volatility
40:1245:87006:22:22:72:540:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:has a 52% standard deviation, compared to 20% in M1 and 64% in the data.  In general, M2
40:1246:87094:22:21:72:540:401:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:produces much more action in aggregate moments of the size and volatility distributions.
40:1247:87182:21:22:72:540:380:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Firm size and volatility are cross-sectionally more negatively correlated with each other in
40:1248:87274:22:22:72:540:358:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:M2 than in M1, bringing the model closer to the data, noting that part of this correlation is
40:1249:87367:22:21:72:207:336:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:now mechanically built in.
40:1250:87393:21:22:89:539:315:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Most importantly, the truncated network moments from M2 are much closer to the data
40:1251:87476:22:22:72:540:293:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:than  those  of  M1.   The  median  out-Herfindahl  is  0.12,  a  factor  of  5  smaller  than  in  M1,
40:1252:87579:22:21:72:540:271:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and  much  closer  to  the  data.   In  addition,  the  truncated  number  of  suppliers  (in-degree)
40:1253:87680:21:22:72:540:250:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and the supplier network concentration (in-Herfindahl) are a closer fit with the data than
40:1254:87770:22:22:72:540:228:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the benchmark model.27Thus, the model matches the key features of the size and volatility
40:1255:87859:22:21:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:distributions while respecting the observed degree of concentration in customer and supplier
40:1256:87951:21:22:72:121:185:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:networks.
40:1257:87960:22:22:89:539:163:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The internal diversification effect, modeled as an exogenous negative correlation between
40:1258:88049:22:17:72:540:141:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:shock volatility and firm size, cannot match the data in the absence of network effects.  In
40:1259:88141:17:16:81:539:124:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:27While  the  correlation  between  log  size  and  truncated  out-degree  (number  of  customers)  is−45%  in
40:1260:88251:16:12:72:540:108:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:M2 in row 5 of Panel A, the correlation between log size and untruncated out-degree is +74%.  Thus, the
40:1261:88354:12:12:72:540:96:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:truncation bias for this correlation is much larger in M2 than in M1.  The bias in the correlation between
40:1262:88460:12:12:72:540:84:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:log size and in-degree (number of suppliers) is smaller in M2 than in M1; the correlation between log size
40:1263:88566:12:0:72:432:72:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:and untruncated in-degrees is similar in both models (0.06 in M2 and 0.04 in M1).
41:1264:88649:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:particular, the correlation between firm size dispersion and mean firm volatility turns from
41:1265:88741:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:positive to negative once we shut down the network effects in M2 (settingγ= 0).  Without
41:1266:88829:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:network transmission, an increase in the firm size dispersion makes the firms in the top half
41:1267:88922:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of the distribution (public firms) larger, which lowers their average volatility by assumption.
41:1268:89017:22:22:72:539:621:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Hence, the network effects aresolelyresponsible for the strong positive correlation between
41:1269:89108:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:size dispersion and mean volatility,  our main moment of interest.  This result underscores
41:1270:89199:21:22:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the crucial role of network effects in accounting for the firm volatility facts, over and above
41:1271:89294:22:39:72:225:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:internal diversification effects.

41:1273:89359:29:22:72:540:488:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Our paper also raises an interesting question on the direction of shock propagation in eco-
41:1274:89450:22:21:72:540:466:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:nomic networks.  The literature studies how inter-sector trade networks influence aggregate
41:1275:89541:21:22:72:539:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:volatility and typically considersdownstreamtransmission of shocks from intermediate goods
41:1276:89631:22:22:72:540:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:producers to final goods producers.  Our results suggest that upstream shock propagation
41:1277:89719:22:21:72:540:401:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:provides  a  better  description  of  firm  volatility  data,  as  in  equilibrium  models  with  final
41:1278:89822:21:22:72:226:380:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:demand shocks (Shea (2002)).
41:1279:89850:22:22:89:539:358:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:To  better  understand  the  difference  in  predictions,  Appendix  C  studies  a  version  of
41:1280:89945:22:21:72:540:336:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:our model with downstream transmission of shocks instead of upstream transmission.  All
41:1281:90032:21:22:72:540:315:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:parameters  are  the  same  as  those  in  M1.   Interestingly,  the  downstream  model  delivers
41:1282:90129:22:22:72:540:293:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:identical size and volatility moments, highlighting the usefulness of network mechanisms for
41:1283:90221:22:21:72:526:271:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:describing joint size and volatility facts, regardless of the direction of shock propagation.
41:1284:90314:21:22:89:539:250:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The network moments, however, help identify the transmission direction.  The in-degree
41:1285:90400:22:22:72:539:228:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and  out-degree  moments  are  reversed  between  upstream  and  downstream  models.28The
41:1286:90489:22:21:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:downstream model matches the correlations between in-Herfindahl and size and volatility
41:1287:90576:21:22:72:540:185:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:better, but completely misses the correlation between out-Herfindahl on the one hand and
41:1288:90664:22:22:72:540:163:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:size  and  volatility  on  the  other  hand.   In  the  data,  the  correlation  between  volatility  and
41:1289:90769:22:21:72:540:141:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:out-Herfindahl is statistically much stronger than that with in-Herfindahl, as in the model
41:1290:90860:21:18:72:250:120:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with upstream shock transmission.
41:1291:90893:18:16:81:539:102:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:28The statement is true for untruncated in-degree and out-degree moments.  Truncation affects the network

42:1293:91048:0:34:72:194:708:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:C:5    Conclusion
42:1294:91063:34:22:72:540:674:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:We document new features of the joint evolution of the firm size and firm volatility distri-
42:1295:91155:22:21:72:540:652:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:bution  and  propose  a  new  model  to  account  for  these  features.   In  the  model,  shocks  are
42:1296:91257:21:22:72:540:631:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:transmitted upstream from customers to suppliers.  Firms sell products to an imperfectly
42:1297:91345:22:22:72:540:609:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:diversified portfolio of customers.  The larger the supplier, the more customer connections
42:1298:91436:22:21:72:540:587:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the supplier has, the better diversified it is and the lower its volatility.  Large customers have
42:1299:91534:21:22:72:540:566:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a relatively strong influence on their suppliers, so shocks to large firms have an important
42:1300:91626:22:22:72:231:544:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effect throughout the economy.
42:1301:91656:22:21:89:539:522:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:When the size dispersion increases in this economy, large firms become more important
42:1302:91741:21:22:72:540:501:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and many customer networks become less diversified.  In those times, average firm volatility

49:1810:101972:18:12:72:343:232:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:This appendix provides additional detail on the network data.
49:1811:102033:12:12:89:539:220:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:We find that the number of customers a Compustat firm has, the “out-degrees,” ranges between 1 and
49:1812:102131:12:12:72:540:208:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:24, while the number of suppliers a firm has, the “in-degrees,” ranges between 1 and 130.  Firms can but are
49:1813:102239:12:12:72:540:196:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:not required to report customers that represent less than 10% of their sales.  Out-degrees can reach 24 since
49:1814:102348:12:12:72:540:184:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:some suppliers (23%) voluntarily report customers that fall below the 10% sales threshold.  The maximum
49:1815:102451:12:12:72:540:172:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:out-degrees falls to 5 when we strictly impose the 10% sales truncation.  Figure 4 provides a summary of
49:1816:102555:12:12:72:540:160:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:network connections for customers and suppliers in the Compustat linkage data.  The left panel shows the

49:1818:102767:12:12:72:268:136:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:distribution of links by customer (in-degree).

50:1844:103494:10:46:72:440:468:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:strictly imposed the 10% sales threshold in our calibration.  Plots pool all firm-years for 1980–2009.
50:1845:103596:46:12:89:539:422:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:Table 8 reports some key moments of the network data.  We calculate cross-sectional correlations for
50:1846:103696:12:12:72:540:410:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:each yearly network realization in the Compustat linkage data and report the time series average of annual
50:1847:103802:12:12:72:540:398:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:correlations.  We also report a t-statistic, measured as the ratio of the time series mean of the correlation to
50:1848:103914:12:12:72:540:386:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:its time-series standard deviation.  In these calculations, size is defined as annual firm sales.  Columns (1)-(5)
50:1849:104028:12:12:72:540:374:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:take the perspective of the suppliers and the connections with their customers.  Instead, Columns (6)-(10)
50:1850:104134:12:12:72:540:362:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:focus on costumers’ connections to their suppliers.  In Panel A we consider all customer-supplier linkages,
50:1851:104241:12:12:72:540:350:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:while in Panel B we only keep those pairs where the customer represents at least 10% of the supplier’s sales.
50:1852:104350:12:12:72:540:338:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:Thus, Panel B imposes the truncation also on the firms that voluntarily report more customer data than
50:1853:104452:12:12:72:111:326:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:required.
50:1854:104461:12:12:89:539:314:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:Panel C adds moments obtained from industry data.  Industry input-output data are from the Bureau
50:1855:104558:12:12:72:540:302:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:of Economic Analysis (BEA). Because industry definitions vary quite dramatically over time, we focus on a
50:1856:104663:12:12:72:540:290:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:set of 65 industries we can track consistently over time between 1998 and 2011.  These data are informative
50:1857:104770:12:12:72:540:278:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:for  evaluating  cross-sectional  correlations  between  industry  size  and  network  structure  since  they  do  not
50:1858:104888:12:12:72:540:266:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:suffer the truncation issue that plagues the Compustat firm-level data.  In related work, Ahern and Harford
50:1859:104995:12:12:72:540:254:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:(forthcoming) use the network topography implied by the BEA industry data to show that the properties
50:1860:105096:12:12:72:540:242:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:of these networks have a bearing on the incidence of cross-industry mergers.  We do not have return-based

50:1862:105242:11:12:89:539:219:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:The moments reported in columns 1 and 2 are discussed in Section 2.6, and the moments reported in

50:1864:105447:12:32:72:469:195:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:identical to those reported in Panel B of Table 8.  Table 8 additionally provides t-statistics.

50:1866:105572:19:12:72:540:144:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:To study the trend and cycle in the size and volatility moments, we apply the Hodrick-Prescott filter with
50:1867:105678:12:12:72:540:132:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:a smoothing parameter of 50.  Figure 6 reports HP-detrended moments.  The top-left panel shows firm size

50:1869:105892:11:12:72:540:109:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:reports firm size dispersion and dispersion of firm volatility, also based on market data.  The bottom two
50:1870:105998:12:12:72:540:97:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:panels are the counter-parts where size and volatility are based on sales data.  The correlations between the

51:1893:107647:9:10:72:540:404:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:we impose a 10% truncation, which implies that we discard all customer-supplier pairs that represent less than 10% of supplier

51:1896:107971:12:12:72:540:336:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:results suggest that the correlations between the dispersion in the firm size distribution and moments of the

51:1899:108182:18:12:72:540:274:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:Our network model predicts that movements in the size distribution precede changes in the volatility distri-
51:1900:108290:12:12:72:540:262:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:bution. When the size distribution spreads out (contracts) at timet, the network structure for the subsequent
51:1901:108399:12:12:72:540:250:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:period adjusts, and diversification of growth rate shocks is hindered (enhanced).  We use Granger causality
51:1902:108506:12:12:72:540:238:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:tests to formally evaluate whether dispersion in firm sizes predicts the mean and standard deviation of the
51:1903:108613:12:12:72:540:226:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:volatility distribution, after controlling for own lags of the dependent variable.  Table 9 presents the results
51:1904:108725:12:12:72:540:214:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:from these tests.  We find that firm size dispersion (based on log market equity) has statistically significant
51:1905:108836:12:12:72:540:202:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:predictive power for mean firm volatility (based on returns), and dispersion in volatility.  The reverse is not
51:1906:108947:12:12:72:540:190:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:true.  After controlling for own lags of size moments, moments of the volatility distribution do not predict the
51:1907:109059:12:12:72:540:178:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:size distribution.  Lagged dispersion in log volatility appears to Granger-cause size dispersion, but the coef-
51:1908:109170:12:12:72:540:166:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f17:F:ficient has the wrong sign.  The hypothesis has the one-sided alternative that volatility dispersionpositively
51:1909:109280:12:12:72:540:154:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:predicts size dispersion; thus this negative result leads us to fail to reject the null.  This evidence suggests
51:1910:109392:12:12:72:540:142:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:that size dispersion leads the volatility distribution, consistent with the model.  This evidence should not be
51:1911:109503:12:0:72:450:130:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:interpreted as support for economic causality, but merely for time-series predictability.

52:1960:110523:12:12:89:539:274:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:First, we use the data set provided by Bloom et al. (2012), which allows us to compare measures of firm-

53:2007:114530:12:12:72:539:186:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:period 1977-2009.  The Census reports employment data in 12 employment bins ranging from 1−4 employees
53:2008:114632:12:12:72:539:174:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:at the low end to 10,000+ at the high end.  We construct the same bins using the Compustat employment
53:2009:114733:12:12:71:539:162:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:data.  We also create a spliced series that divides the 10,000+ bin into 25 sub-bins applying an imputation
53:2010:114840:12:12:71:539:150:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:that replicates the employment distribution in that bin in the Compustat employment data.  The evolution
53:2011:114944:12:12:71:539:138:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:of firm size dispersion when considering the entire universe of firms seems similar to the one in Compustat.
53:2012:115052:12:12:71:539:126:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:The correlation between the cross-sectional variance of log size in Compustat and the spliced series is 62%.
53:2013:115160:12:12:71:480:114:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:The correlation between the non-spliced Census measure and the Compustat measure is 65%.
53:2014:115248:12:12:89:539:102:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:As  an  aside,  we  note  that  at  the  start  of  the  sample,  the  Census  reports  728  firms  with  more  than
53:2015:115364:12:12:71:539:90:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:10,000 employees, while Compustat reports 677.  So, we have fairly comprehensive coverage at the start of
53:2016:115469:12:0:71:539:78:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:the  sample.   At  the  end  of  the  sample,  there  are  1,975  with  10,000+  firms,  only  1,016  of  which  show  up

54:2030:116295:10:9:72:540:465:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:Bloom, Floetotto, Jaimovich, and Terry (2012).  In Panel B, we compute time series for firm size dispersion, mean firm volatility,
54:2031:116425:9:9:72:540:456:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:and the dispersion of firm volatility for two non-overlapping samples of active (public) and inactive (private) Compustat firms.
54:2032:116553:9:10:72:540:447:8:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:F:We then report the correlation of those statistics between active and inactive firms.  The text of Appendix B.4 contains all the

54:2034:116689:45:12:72:540:392:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:in Compustat.  There are more large, private firms at the end of the sample.  This observation makes the
54:2035:116793:12:12:72:540:380:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:previous exercise, based on active and inactive Compustat firms, extra useful because Compustat captures
54:2036:116897:12:12:72:171:368:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:the large private firms.
54:2037:116921:12:12:89:539:356:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:In conclusion, the changes in the firm size and volatility distribution that we have documented do not
54:2038:117023:12:12:72:540:344:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:seem specific to the universe of publicly traded firms.  Combined with the evidence for the evidence of the
54:2039:117130:12:11:72:540:332:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:subgroups of publicly listed firms discussed in Section 3.3, the evidence suggests that the correlation between
54:2040:117241:11:12:72:540:321:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:firm size dispersion and the mean and dispersion of the firm volatility distribution are robust features of the

54:2043:117403:22:12:72:540:250:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:We study a version of our model where the direction of shock transmission is reversed from upstream to
54:2044:117505:12:12:72:540:238:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:downstream.  A firm’s growth rate now depends on its own shock and on the growth rate of its suppliers.  We
54:2045:117612:12:12:72:540:226:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:use the exact same calibration as in the benchmark model.  If we abstract from truncation, then reversing the
54:2046:117721:12:12:72:540:214:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:direction only changes the network moments reported in Table 7; the moments in the size and volatility tables
54:2047:117830:12:12:72:540:202:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:5 and 6 are identical.  In terms of network moments,  the untruncated in-degree and out-degree moments
54:2048:117932:12:12:72:540:190:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:are reversed.  However, after truncation (which operates at the level of suppliers), the results look different.
54:2049:118044:12:12:72:540:178:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:Table 11 reports results for the downstream transmission case.  This version of the model has more success
54:2050:118150:12:12:72:540:166:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:matching  the  in-degree  moments,  but  then  it  does  considerably  worse  matching  the  out-degree  moments
54:2051:118262:12:12:72:540:154:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:in  the  top  panel.   Most  importantly,  this  version  of  the  model  implies  counter-factually  that  there  is  no
54:2052:118383:12:12:72:540:142:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:correlation between out-Herfindahls and volatility.  In the data, we found that this relation is statistically
54:2053:118493:12:12:72:540:130:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:strong (see Table 8) unlike that between volatility and in-Herfindahl.  In addition, Table 3 showed that out-
54:2054:118602:12:12:72:540:118:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:Herfindahl is a robust determinant of firm volatility after controlling for other variables, while the relation
54:2055:118713:12:0:72:290:106:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:between supplier Herfindahls and volatility is not.
