3:51:446:13:25:76:79:582:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A: 
3:52:446:25:12:76:542:557:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A:The intention of the present article is to shed light on the heterogeneity of value of time among shippers. 
3:53:554:12:13:56:542:545:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:In  order  to  deal  with  this  issue,  we  first  look  at  the  reasons  for  which  different  shippers  may  value  a  time  
3:54:684:13:13:56:541:532:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:saving differently. This analysis makes use of a distinction between generic goods and specific (tailor made) 
3:55:794:13:12:56:542:519:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:goods.  Subsequently,  we  analyse  how  this  heterogeneity  could  be  represented  in  the  framework  of  Mixed  
3:56:911:12:13:56:542:507:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:Logit  which  is  increasingly  popular  among  the  Transport  Science  research  community.  We  concentrate  on  
3:57:1027:13:12:56:541:494:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:the issue of the selection of an adequate distribution for the random coefficients of time and costs attributes. 
3:58:1140:12:13:56:542:482:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:In the final part of this article, we make an estimate of the value of time heterogeneity using data collected 
3:59:1251:13:25:56:159:469:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:from shippers in Italy.

4:74:1743:13:14:74:160:746:144:Times:144:Times:C:1. Introduction 
4:75:1758:14:13:56:59:732:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C: 
4:76:1758:13:13:76:542:719:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A:During  recent  years,  the  development  of  Random  Parameter  Logit  models,  within  the  well-established  
4:77:1870:13:12:56:542:706:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:framework  of  Random  Utility  Maximisation,  has  offered  transport  modellers  a  set  of  powerful  and  flexible  
4:78:1990:12:13:56:543:694:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:tools  to  represent  and  measure  how  transport  behaviour  is  affected  by  the  heterogeneity  of  the  economic  
4:79:2110:13:12:56:541:681:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:agents' preferences. This has resulted in a parallel development of many formal specifications for the kernel 
4:80:2220:12:25:56:412:669:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:component of the random utility model and a number of empirical applications.  
4:81:2299:25:13:76:541:644:121:g_d0_f6:121:Times:A:However  this  renewal  has  scarcely  affected  the  understanding  of  firms’  preferences  for  freight 
4:82:2406:13:12:56:541:631:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:transportation. Indeed, similar to travellers, firms may value single attributes of a transport service differently 
4:83:2522:12:13:56:543:619:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:from  one  another.  Consequently,  the  understanding  of  heterogeneity  among  firms’  preferences  and  the  
4:84:2635:13:25:56:517:606:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:production of original quantitative results should be ranked high on the agenda of transport economists.  
4:85:2741:25:12:76:544:581:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A:In  this  article,  we  propose  to  investigate  the  reasons  for  the  differences  among  individual  firms'  
4:86:2855:12:13:56:541:569:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:valuations of transport attributes, and we propose a representation of this heterogeneity using some Random 
4:87:2963:13:13:56:542:556:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:Parameter Logit specifications. We concentrate on one single transport service attribute: transport time. This 
4:88:3074:13:12:56:541:543:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:choice is motivated by two reasons. First, in the field of public policy, this choice recognises the pre-eminent 
4:89:3187:12:13:56:542:531:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:share  that  time  savings  usually  represents  in  transport  project  benefits.  Second,  in  the  field  of  management  
4:90:3312:13:13:56:542:518:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:science, the role of time competition has been underlined by different works (Cachon e Harker 2002, Li and 
4:91:3419:13:12:56:541:505:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:Lee 1994, Stalk and Hout, 1990). Another peculiarity of our approach is that we concentrate on the demand 
4:92:3525:12:13:56:541:493:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:side of the transport market, that is shippers, companies that produce material goods and consume transport 
4:93:3632:13:13:56:541:480:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:services. We will not consider heterogeneity on the supply side: hauliers, that is, the producers of transport 
4:94:3743:13:12:56:541:467:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:services. Regarding the latter, we will only mention at this stage the works by Wynter (1995) and Kawamura 
4:95:3850:12:13:56:541:455:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:(1999) who investigated the heterogeneity of hauliers’ valuation and we will return briefly in the body of the 
4:96:3961:13:25:56:479:442:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:present article to the mechanisms that may link shippers’ preferences and hauliers’ preferences. 
4:97:4058:25:12:76:542:417:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A:In  short,  we  want  to  investigate  the  heterogeneity  in  shippers’  value  of  time.  Our  presentation  follows  
4:98:4178:12:13:56:543:405:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:three  steps:  understanding  where  heterogeneity  stems  from,  investigating  the  possibilities  to  model  this  
4:99:4296:13:12:56:541:392:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:heterogeneity; providing quantitative evidences of heterogeneity in freight values of time based on a shipper

4:102:4447:14:13:74:77:340:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C: 
4:103:4447:13:12:76:541:327:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A:In this section we investigate the causes of heterogeneity. The question is here why a certain company 
4:104:4550:12:13:56:542:315:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:would  be  prepared  to  pay  a  certain  amount  of  money  to  reduce  transport  time.  We  deal  with  this  question  
4:105:4673:13:13:56:541:302:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:introducing a distinction between two different types of goods that in turn relate to two distinct  relations to 
4:106:4786:13:25:56:84:289:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:time.  
4:107:4793:25:14:74:223:264:144:Times:144:Times:C:2.1 Definition and distinctions 
4:108:4824:14:13:74:77:250:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C: 
4:109:4824:13:13:76:543:237:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A:The  distinction  we  use  is  inspired  by  Salais  and  Storper  (1993),  and  already  commented  in  transport  
4:110:4940:13:12:56:542:224:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:economics  by  Burmeister  (2000).  The  first  category  of  goods  is  referred  to  as  "generic  goods"  and  to  the  
4:111:5063:12:13:56:543:212:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:second  type  as  "specific  goods".  Generic goods  are  undifferentiated  between  one  unit  and  another.  This  
4:112:5180:13:13:56:542:199:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:means that they can be produced in advance, whenever a firm considers that it is reasonable to forecast that 
4:113:5289:13:12:56:540:186:121:g_d0_f6:121:Times:B:some  units  of  these  goods  will  be  bought  in  the  subsequent  periods  of  time.  On  the  contrary,  the  specific 
4:114:5413:12:13:56:542:174:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:goods  are  tailor  made  for  each  client.  In  this  situation  it  is  not  feasible  for  a  firm  to  produce  a  unit  of  the  
4:115:5548:13:12:56:542:161:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:good  before  the  precise  specifications  of  its  features  have  been  agreed  with  the  client.  These  two  types  of  
4:116:5674:12:25:56:343:149:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:goods create a different relation with time as is discussed below. 
4:117:5741:25:13:76:541:124:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A:Dealing with generic goods, the question on how much time to spend in production and/or in transport 
4:118:5842:13:12:56:542:111:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:relates to the choice of an optimal stock policy, coping with the extra costs occurring when stock increases

4:120:6064:13:13:56:543:86:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:economic  and  logistic  science  and  has  given  rise  to  various  models  of  optimal  stock  policy,  such  as  the  
4:121:6186:13:12:56:544:73:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:model  of  Baumol  and  Vinod  (1970).  In  this  framework  the  value  of  time  for  the  shippers  has  two  
4:122:6299:12:0:56:542:61:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:components: the reduction of inventory costs occurring during transportation and the reduction of the costs

5:156:8443:12:13:56:543:380:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:ordered  and  delivered  to  the  producer;  second  the  inputs  are  processed  to  produce  the  outputs;  third,  the

7:224:12759:13:20:56:516:473:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:(7)                            r'ds - ci'dt =  r'dp - ci'dt =  r'dt - ci'dt = cs'ds - ci'dt  = cp'dp - ci'dt = ct'dt     
7:225:12880:20:13:56:543:453:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:Recalling  that  revenues  are  decreasing  with  duration:  (r'ds  =  r'dt  =  r'dp  <0)  and  that  generalized  
7:226:12995:13:14:56:541:440:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:immobilisation costs are increasing with transport duration (ci'dt>0), we can find: cs'ds < 0 , cp'dp <0, 
7:227:13101:14:14:56:542:426:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:ct'dt <  0.  These  latest  inequalities  mean  that  the  profit  maximising  durations  chosen  by  the  shipper  
7:228:13217:14:14:56:542:412:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:will  be  located  on  the  downard  slope  of  the  three  different  cost  curves.  In  other  words,  when  the  
7:229:13333:14:14:56:544:398:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:shipper  maximises  profit,  it  is  in  a  situation  where  costs  would  be  reduced  by  an  increase  in  
7:230:13444:14:13:56:542:384:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:duration. Also one can deduce from equation (1.7) that a profit maximising shipper will be prepared 
7:231:13544:13:14:56:542:371:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:to pay for a faster transportation as much as the extra cost it would incur in reducing the duration

7:238:14078:13:24:56:281:279:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:costs, as well as one of the following three effects: 
7:239:14132:24:19:76:349:255:121:g_d0_f12:121:g_d0_f6:A: the marginal increase in revenue due to a faster delivery,

8:277:16988:12:13:56:542:390:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:shippers. We have found that when the goods are generic, the shippers’ benefits are based on the reduction 
8:278:17095:13:13:56:542:377:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:of  inventory  costs  and  the  reduction  of  the  costs  of  holding  a  safety  stock.  When,  instead,  the  goods  are  
8:279:17220:13:12:56:542:364:121:Times:121:g_d0_f6:B:specific the  benefits  rely  on  the  reduction  of  generalised  immobilisation  costs  and  the  economies  (or  extra

8:288:17874:25:12:76:542:201:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A:First,  one  needs  to  recall,  that  several  ways  to  represent  heterogeneity  exist.  For  instance,  in  the  fixed

8:290:18110:13:13:56:543:176:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:represent  differences  in  the  utility  function  that  characterises  each  individual.  Other,  more  resourceful,  
8:291:18230:13:12:56:542:163:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:possibilities  are  the  use  of  interaction  terms  (for  instance  the  product  of  transport  time  by  the  value  of  the

10:371:21067:14:14:56:524:746:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:Logit is the selection of a distribution for the coefficients. The question can be considered in two 
10:372:21168:14:14:56:530:732:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:ways. As the value of time is the ratio of the time coefficient on the cost coefficient of the indirect 
10:373:21272:14:14:56:520:718:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:utility function, one may want to consider these two terms separately. The other alternative is to 
10:374:21371:14:13:56:369:704:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:consider directly the distribution of the ratio of these two terms.  
10:375:21440:13:14:56:59:691:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C: 
10:376:21440:14:14:77:487:677:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:The first solution is appealing as it is similar to the way in which the Random Utility 
10:377:21528:14:14:56:532:663:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:Maximisation is usually implemented, namely with one coefficient for cost and one coefficient for 
10:378:21626:14:14:56:538:649:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:the time attribute. Although there are some difficulties with the derivation of a statistical density for 
10:379:21732:14:13:56:534:635:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:the ratio of two densities2, such difficulties may not be an hurdle because one can also, making use 
10:380:21833:13:14:56:510:622:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:of Bayes formula, estimate individual values for each coefficient (as proposed in Hensher and 
10:381:21927:14:14:56:539:608:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:Greene, 2003). In this case, the distribution of the values of time will be provided by the ratio of the 
10:382:22032:14:14:56:534:594:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:individual estimates of the time and cost coefficients, without the need for the analytical derivation 
10:383:22135:14:14:56:539:580:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:of a density function. A more serious difficulty is that the elements that would provide insight about 
10:384:22238:14:13:56:536:566:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:the adequate density function for each single term of the ratio (time coefficient/cost coefficient) are 
10:385:22342:13:14:56:390:553:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:much less that the one regarding the distribution of the value of time.

10:388:22520:13:12:56:542:513:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:transportation  is  proposed  by  Hensher  et  al.  (2005).  These  are  namely:  normal,  Log-normal,  uniform  and  
10:389:22638:12:13:56:542:501:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:triangular. Recently, some other distributions have been proposed in the literature. The Raleygh distribution 
10:390:22748:13:13:56:542:488:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:or  the  Johnson  distribution  (Train  et  Sonnier  (2004))  offer  a  large  flexibility.  However  the  possibility  to  
10:391:22872:13:12:56:542:475:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:implement  such  distributions  is  still  very  limited  in  the  estimation  software  available  to  date 3.  Among  the  
10:392:22997:12:13:56:542:463:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:different  available  distributions  there  is  a  sharp  distinction  between  unbounded  distributions,  that  provide  
10:393:23119:13:13:56:541:450:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:non zero density for large absolute values of the coefficients, and bounded distributions that can be criticised 
10:394:23232:13:12:56:542:437:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:based  on  the  consideration  that  natura  non  fecit  saltum.  Second,  it  suggests  that  we  find  no  definite  choice  
10:395:23359:12:13:56:542:425:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:criteria  among  the  different  distributions.  If  we  come  back  to  formula  (8),  one  could  say  that  the  value  of  
10:396:23486:13:13:56:538:412:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:time for the producers of specific goods results of the addition of two phenomenon (the one represented by –
10:397:23594:13:12:56:541:399:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:r't and the other by ci't). Moreover, the second of these phenomenon, generalised immobilising costs, results 
10:398:23704:12:13:56:543:387:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:itself  of  several  additive  effects:  inventory  costs,  costs  of  damages  in  as  far  as  they  are  proportional  to  
10:399:23830:13:12:56:541:374:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:transport time, modification of the physical features of the goods (perishable goods). This additive feature is 
10:400:23942:12:13:56:541:362:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:consistent with the normal distribution (sum of additive phenomenon). However, although they are additive, 
10:401:24049:13:13:56:541:349:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:they are neither in a large number, nor independent, as a strict application of the central limit theorem would

11:422:25530:12:13:56:542:723:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:income. Considering that the distribution of income is empirically found to be represented by a log normal 
11:423:25637:13:13:56:543:710:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:density,  on  can  conjecture  that  the  coefficient  of  cost  in  a  linear  utility  is  the  inverse  of  a  function  of  a  
11:424:25768:13:12:56:542:697:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:variable  that  has  a  lognormal  distribution.  This  provides  thus  indications,  both  theoretical  and  empirical,  to

11:439:27229:12:13:56:542:484:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:and transport refers  to  the  bundle  of  operations  that  the  good  spends  in  all  transport  operations  (stocking,  
11:440:27353:13:13:56:541:471:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:cross docking, border crossing, etc.) The point here is that the trade-offs regarding travel time are usually an 
11:441:27466:13:12:56:543:458:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:internal  matter  for  the  haulier,  while  the  shipper  usually  only  knows  about  the  transport time.  For  this  
11:442:27587:12:13:56:542:446:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:reason, it is usually possible to know the willingness to pay of hauliers for a travel time saving (but not for 
11:443:27699:13:28:56:512:433:121:Times:121:g_d0_f6:B:transport time savings), and of the shippers for a transport time saving (but not for travel time saving).

11:459:29055:11:18:56:528:100:42:g_d0_f6:101:g_d0_f6:F:4 The notations μ  and μ corresponds to the distinction between metakinesic and ametakinesic, from the Greek word 
11:460:29169:18:7:56:143:82:101:g_d0_f6:101:g_d0_f6:F:metakinesis (travel).  
11:461:29192:7:16:56:540:75:42:g_d0_f6:101:g_d0_f6:F:5 This suppose that the cost of non travel operations does not depend on the duration of travel operation, and conversely. 
11:462:29315:16:0:56:376:59:101:g_d0_f6:101:g_d0_f6:F:The alternative, more complex situation is discussed in Massiani (2005, p. 313) 
12:463:29397:0:13:76:543:761:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A:This  multiplier  indicates  the  benefits  of  a  marginal  reduction  of  the  minimum  travel  time  or,  in  other  
12:464:29517:13:25:56:372:748:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:words, the willingness to pay of hauliers for a reduction in travel time.  
12:465:29592:25:25:76:215:723:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A:Thus, we can use the notation:

12:467:29826:25:14:76:542:673:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A:dμmin is the minimum travel time on a given corridor, cμ(dμmin) is the cost of producing a transportation 
12:468:29932:14:18:56:543:659:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:service  on  this  corridor,  rt(dμmin  +  dμ*)  are  the  revenues  of  the  hauliers  as  a  function  of  the  minimum

12:470:30184:13:12:56:541:628:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:change in transport duration is the sum of the marginal change in hauliers’ costs and the marginal increase in 
12:471:30295:12:13:56:542:616:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:hauliers’ revenues. The second effect, marginal increase in hauliers’ revenues, is only the counterpart of the 
12:472:30406:13:13:56:542:603:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:willingness to pay of hauliers clients, that is shippers, for a time saving. This feature proves to be useful in

12:481:30852:15:12:76:542:457:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A:where wtps is the willingness to pay of the shippers to reduce transport time, and cμ'dμ. is the marginal 
12:482:30958:12:13:56:542:445:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:cost of travel operations. The willingness to pay of the hauliers for a time saving reflects the willingness to 
12:483:31070:13:14:56:541:432:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:pay of the shippers plus the changes in travel costs. This latest element will depend in turn on two elements: 
12:484:31181:14:12:56:543:418:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:the  property  of  the  first  derivative  cμ'dμ,  and  the  point  of  this  function  where  hauliers  locate  in  current  
12:485:31307:12:25:56:107:406:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:conditions. 
12:486:31319:25:25:76:480:381:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A:Then, it is possible, based on equation (19) to isolate in the left end term wtps and to write:  
12:487:31416:25:19:56:513:356:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:(20)                                                             wtps = wtph - cμ'dμ,

12:489:31502:14:13:76:542:323:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A:Equation  (20)  indicates  that  the  willingness  to  pay  of  the  shippers  for  a  marginal  time  saving  can  be  
12:490:31622:13:12:56:541:310:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:deducted from hauliers' willingness to pay, net of the travel cost reduction due to this time saving. In terms of 
12:491:31736:12:13:56:542:298:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:distribution,  the  conclusion  of  this  retropolation  procedure  is  that  the  distribution  of  shippers  value  of  time  
12:492:31864:13:12:56:540:285:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:results from the addition of two distributions, the distribution of hauliers' willingness to pay for a time saving 
12:493:31979:12:25:56:254:273:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:and the distribution of marginal travel costs. 
12:494:32026:25:13:76:543:248:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A:It  then  becomes  possible  to  use  certain  empirical  evidence  such  as  that  collected  by  Wynter  (1995),  
12:495:32142:13:13:56:542:235:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:Kawamaru (1999) and Kawamaru (2000) that establish a log-normal distribution for hauliers’ value of time. 
12:496:32248:13:14:56:541:222:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:If we consider that cμ'dμ is fixed, it will then be possible to conclude that wtps is lognormally distributed, and 
12:497:32363:14:12:56:542:208:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:we  will  only  make  an  error  as  far  as  the  hypothesis  that  is  made  about  the  constancy  of  (cμ'dμ)  among  the  
12:498:32490:12:13:56:545:196:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:hauliers  being  restrictive.  This  suggests  that  the  retropolation  technique  provides  a  way  to  infer  the  
12:499:32608:13:13:56:545:183:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:distribution  of  shippers'  willingness  to  pay  based  on  the  information  that  is  available  regarding  the  
12:500:32725:13:12:56:541:170:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:distribution of hauliers willingness to pay. This can be useful in situations where the researcher has empirical 
12:501:32838:12:13:56:542:158:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:data that make it possible to derive conclusions on hauliers’ value of time distribution, but has no empirical 
12:502:32949:13:25:56:353:145:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:elements on the distribution of shippers’ value of time distribution. 
12:503:33019:25:12:76:543:120:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A:In  this  section,  we  have  discussed  the  choice  of  a  density  function  to  represent  the  distribution  of

12:506:33363:13:12:56:541:82:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:normal distribution, we have explored other indications based on economic analysis. We have found that the 
12:507:33470:12:0:56:545:70:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:empirical  evidences  regarding  the  distribution  of  households'  income  provide  no  useful  information

13:509:33710:13:13:56:542:748:121:Times:121:g_d0_f6:B:shippers'  value  of  time  distribution  based  on  hauliers'  value  of  time  distribution,  although  such  a  relation  
13:510:33835:13:12:56:542:735:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:provides  a  satisfactory  approximation  only  insofar  as  the  marginal  cost  of  travel time  saving  is  relatively  
13:511:33958:12:13:56:545:723:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:similar  among  the  different  hauliers  considered.  This  creates  a  conjecture  in  favour  of  log-normal  
13:512:34071:13:13:56:544:710:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:distribution.  As  a  conclusion,  we  consider  that  normal  distribution  and  log-normal  distribution  provide  
13:513:34188:13:25:56:318:697:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:interesting candidates for the distribution of value of time.

14:591:39012:13:13:56:543:315:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:interaction  terms.  Regarding  segmentation, the  results,  presented  in  the  appendix  (Table  3  and  Table  7),  
14:592:39131:13:12:56:545:302:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:show  that,  for  all  segmentations  based  on  firm  size,  shipment  value,  industrial  sector  and  logistics  
14:593:39247:12:13:56:541:290:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:management, the hypothesis of equality can be rejected with a risk lower than one percent. On the contrary, 
14:594:39355:13:13:56:544:277:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:we  cannot  reject  with  5%  probability  the  hypothesis  of  equality  of  coefficients  between  inbound  and  
14:595:39470:13:12:56:542:264:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:outbound flows. Interestingly, these results give some insight about the effects of two different logistics and 
14:596:39582:12:13:56:541:252:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:production policies. Although the information collected in the survey is not phrased in the same terms as the 
14:597:39692:13:13:56:542:239:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:distinction we proposed between "generic" and "specific" goods, it provides a satisfactory approximation so 
14:598:39800:13:12:56:543:226:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:that  it  can  be  used  to  investigate  whether  there  is  a  difference  between  these  two  categories.  The  log  
14:599:39921:12:13:56:543:214:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:likelihood  ratio  test  clearly  indicates  that  the  behaviour  of  the  two  different  firm  types  are  significantly  
14:600:40046:13:25:56:208:201:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:different based on their segments. 
14:601:40081:25:14:76:526:176:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:Models with interaction terms, are estimated introducing, in the MNL model, attributes that 
14:602:40173:14:14:56:510:162:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:correspond to the cross effect of certain transport attributes and shippers’ characteristics7. The 
14:603:40272:14:14:56:531:148:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:results are presented in appendix Table 8. They indicate, for instance, that the value of the damage 
14:604:40373:14:14:56:515:134:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:attribute is highly different for companies belonging to the mechanical industry compared with 
14:605:40468:14:26:56:523:120:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:other industries. Based on these results it can be observed that a major source of heterogeneity is 
14:606:40568:26:8:56:203:94:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:                                                 
14:607:40616:8:16:56:538:86:42:g_d0_f6:101:g_d0_f6:F:7 The selection process for the different variables was to introduce variables one by one (stepwise forward) based on the 
14:608:40738:16:11:56:531:70:101:g_d0_f6:101:g_d0_f6:F:relative difference of the coefficient obtained in the segmented estimates (Table 5 and Table 6). During this procedure 
14:609:40858:11:0:56:433:59:101:g_d0_f6:101:g_d0_f6:F:the significance of the coefficients, as well as the fitting statistics of the model are monitored. 
15:610:40960:0:14:56:536:760:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:constituted by the sector, and that the damage and punctuality attributes have effects that are highly 
15:611:41063:14:14:56:508:746:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:different depending on the characteristics of the companies and of the shipments. Moreover it 
15:612:41157:14:14:56:495:732:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:appears possible to introduce an important number of cross-variables before the adjunction 
15:613:41248:14:14:56:534:718:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:deteriorates the adjusted R² . These results suggest that the introduction of interaction variables is a 
15:614:41353:14:13:56:533:704:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:major source of amelioration for a RUM model. This still holds when taking care of the parsimony 
15:615:41450:13:14:56:126:691:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:of the model.

15:617:41465:14:14:76:514:663:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:These results raise the issue on whether other techniques, and in particular mixed logit, are 
15:618:41559:14:14:56:309:649:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:adequate to represent the heterogeneity of shippers.

17:719:47616:13:12:94:541:635:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A:the flow. Such a finding is not surprising as the variation in the cost and time coefficient can capture 
17:720:47721:12:25:94:208:623:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A:some of the cross effects.

19:787:51982:13:25:76:79:733:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A: 
19:788:51982:25:12:76:541:708:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A:The main finding of our paper is that, based on a micro-founded formulation of the shipper and hauliers 
19:789:52086:12:13:56:543:696:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:profit  maximisation,  and  introducing  the  relevant  distinctions,  it  is  possible  to  formulate  an  adequate  
19:790:52204:13:13:56:543:683:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:representation  of  the  value  placed  by  firms  on  the  reduction  of  transport  time  and  thus  to  explain  the  
19:791:52325:13:12:56:542:670:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:differences  in  the  valuation  of  transport  time  by  different  firms.  This  approach  can  be  summarized  in  three  
19:792:52450:12:24:56:91:658:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:phases.

19:795:52484:13:13:76:542:608:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A:From a theoretical point of view, we placed at the forefront of the analysis of freight value of time the 
19:796:52590:13:13:56:541:595:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:difference between specific and generic goods. The distribution of the freight value of time will then depend 
19:797:52700:13:24:56:73:582:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:on: 
19:798:52704:24:13:56:386:558:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:1   - the nature of each single shipment with regard to this distinction, and  
19:799:52783:13:12:56:532:545:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:2   - inside each of these categories, it will depend on the parameters that are determining the willingness to 
19:800:52895:12:13:56:80:533:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:pay.  
19:801:52901:13:13:56:59:520:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B: 
19:802:52901:13:12:76:541:507:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A:As far as generic goods are concerned, in the approach proposed by Baumol and Vinod (1970), shippers’ 
19:803:53003:12:13:56:541:495:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:willingness to pay will depend on the inventory costs accruing on the shipment during transportation, and on 
19:804:53112:13:26:56:193:482:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:the costs of the optimal stock.  
19:805:53145:26:13:76:452:456:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:As far as specific goods are concerned, the willingness to pay will depend on: 
19:806:53224:13:13:56:413:443:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:1   - an inventory cost based on the value of the good during its transport.  
19:807:53302:13:13:56:542:430:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:2   - another term that reflects, the sensitivity of the revenues to the duration of transportation, the sensitivity 
19:808:53419:13:13:56:542:417:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:of  production  costs  to  the  production  duration,  the  sensitivity  of  supplying  costs  to  the  supplying  duration,  
19:809:53545:13:12:56:541:404:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:these three different marginal costs being equal when the producer respects the marginal temporal conditions 
19:810:53654:12:25:56:217:392:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:resulting from profit maximisation.  
19:811:53691:25:13:56:542:367:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:      Once  an  analysis  of  the  cause  of  value  of  time  heterogeneity  is  available,  it  becomes  possible  to  model

19:816:53967:12:13:56:543:292:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:Compared  with  interaction  terms,  they  do  not  specify  the  source  of  heterogeneity.  This  feature  can  be  
19:817:54085:13:12:56:542:279:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:considered  as  an  advantage  or  a  drawback.  An  advantage  because  it  permits  us  to  represent  heterogeneity  
19:818:54205:12:13:56:542:267:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:even when there is no theoretical or no empirical element to specify it. A drawback, because it provides no 
19:819:54313:13:13:56:541:254:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:elements to understand the sources of heterogeneity. This uncertainty is however not a hindrance because the 
19:820:54422:13:12:56:543:241:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:two  approaches  RPL  and  interaction  terms  are  compatible,  with  the  only  drawback  that  some  degrees  of  
19:821:54539:12:25:56:248:229:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:freedom are lost in the estimation process.  
19:822:54584:25:13:76:542:204:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A:The  next  question  is  then  the  choice  of  a  relevant  probability  distribution  for  the  different  stochastic  
19:823:54705:13:12:56:541:191:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:coefficients.  Regarding  this  question  we  have  found  no  definite  selection  criteria  but  only  two  conjectures.  
19:824:54829:12:13:56:543:179:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:The  first  conjecture  is  that  the  willingness  to  pay  of  shippers  is  the  sum  of  different  components.  This  
19:825:54952:13:13:56:542:166:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:additive  feature  is  compatible  with  the  normal  distribution.  However  the  different  additive  components  are  
19:826:55073:13:12:56:542:153:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:not  numerous,  and  we  have  no  evidence  about  whether  they  are  of  similar  influence  and  independent,  as  a  
19:827:55195:12:13:56:543:141:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:rigorous  application  of  the  central  limit  theorem  would  require.  The  second  conjecture  is  based  on  a  
19:828:55312:13:13:56:541:128:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:retropolation procedure that permits us to retropolate the distribution of shippers’ willingness to pay based on 
19:829:55425:13:12:56:543:115:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:the  distribution  of  hauliers  willingness  to  pay.  It  then  becomes  possible  to  use  empirical  results  available  
19:830:55550:12:13:56:541:103:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:suggesting a lognormal distribution for hauliers’ willingness to pay, to assume that such a distribution would 
19:831:55661:13:13:56:541:90:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:also be suitable for the shippers’ value of time. However, this reasoning could be contested as the number of 
19:832:55771:13:12:56:542:77:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:results suggesting a log normal distribution for hauliers’ distribution is limited, and, more important, by the

20:834:55939:0:13:76:542:761:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A:Eventually we find only two conjectures in favour of a log normal distribution or a normal distribution 
20:835:56043:13:24:56:468:748:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:for the shippers’ value of time, these two conjectures being incompatible one with the other.

20:838:56163:13:13:76:542:698:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A:The  empirical  application  that  we  have  made  based  on  a  shipper  interview  in  three  Italian  regions  has  
20:839:56282:13:24:56:202:685:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:provided some empirical results. 
20:840:56315:24:13:76:541:661:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A: First, it underlines the importance of the survey design used for SP survey. With regard to this we find 
20:841:56421:13:13:56:543:648:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:that  the  range  of  value  proposed  for  the  "damage"  attribute  during  data  collection  has  been  the  cause  of  
20:842:56544:13:24:56:272:635:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:several difficulties in the processing of the data.  
20:843:56597:24:13:76:541:611:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A:Second, we note the low magnitude of the value of time that we obtain compared to some other results 
20:844:56698:13:13:56:541:598:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:that are present in the literature (see for instance de Jong 1996, de Jong et ali 1995, Wynter, 1995, Kawamura 
20:845:56809:13:12:56:542:585:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:1999).  This  low  value  of  time  can  be  explained,  beyond  the  idiosyncrasies  of  the  shippers  in  the  surveyed  
20:846:56933:12:13:56:542:573:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:regions, by empirical or by methodological reasons. First, from an empirical point of view, let recall that the 
20:847:57045:13:13:56:542:560:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:shipments  that  gave  rise  to  an  interview  were  selected  by  eliminating  the  ones  that  were  not  likely  to  use  
20:848:57171:13:12:56:544:547:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:intermodal  transportation.  One  should  then  recall  that  the  characteristics  of  intermodal  transportation,  
20:849:57288:12:13:56:543:535:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:especially  with  regard  to  the  weight  of  the  shipments,  are  negatively  correlated  with  the  value  of  time.  
20:850:57410:13:13:56:541:522:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:Second, from a methodological point of view, the weakness of the value of time measured in this study could 
20:851:57518:13:12:56:542:509:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:also  be  due  to  the  amplitude  of  the  variations  proposed  for  the  transport  time  variable:  such  durations  vary  
20:852:57645:12:13:56:542:497:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:form  12  to  48  hours.  In  the  area  of  travellers  transportation,  Widlert  (1994)  analyses  how  values  of  time  
20:853:57769:13:12:56:541:484:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:measured by SP survey are contingent to the elicitation process. its analysis underlines that the results vary 
20:854:57880:12:13:56:542:472:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:greatly  based  on  the  range  of  time  saving  value  proposed  during  the  survey.  This  could  shed  light  on  a  
20:855:58002:13:25:56:409:459:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:possible explanation for the low magnitude of the value of time that we obtain.  
20:856:58083:25:12:76:543:434:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A:The  next  observation  that  can  be  made  regards  the  dispersion  of  the  individual  values  of  time.  The  
20:857:58199:12:13:56:542:422:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:generality  of  the  results  is  relative  insofar  as  some  specification  could  not  be  estimated.  This  is  the  case  of  
20:858:58330:13:13:56:543:409:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:estimates  where  we  assume  a  lognormal  distribution  for  the  time  coefficient,  and  of  many  specifications  
20:859:58449:13:12:56:544:396:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:where  we  assumed  a  normal  distribution  of  those  coefficients.  One  estimate,  based  on  a  triangular  
20:860:58562:12:13:56:545:384:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:distribution  of  the  coefficients  provides  satisfactory  results.  The  fitting  criteria  are  clearly  improved  
20:861:58681:13:13:56:542:371:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:compared  with  the  fixed  coefficient  specification.  These  gains  appear  larger  than  the  ones  that  it  is  usually  
20:862:58808:13:12:56:543:358:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:possible  to  obtain  when  one  wants  to  improve  the  specification  of  a  model  in  the  framework  of  a  fixed  
20:863:58929:12:25:56:134:346:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:coefficient logit.  
20:864:58949:25:13:76:541:321:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A:Moreover the use of stochastic coefficients appears as a complement, rather than a substitute to the use 
20:865:59054:13:12:56:542:308:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:of  interaction  terms.  These  two  techniques,  used  together,  provide  better  results  than  those  obtained  when  
20:866:59176:12:13:56:538:296:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:using  only  one  of  the  methods.  This  observation,  that  was  already  made  in  travellers  transportation  (Ben-
20:867:59296:13:24:56:515:283:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:akiva and Gopinath, 1996),  should be consolidated by other results in the area of freight transportation.

20:870:59422:13:12:76:541:233:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:A:Eventually, our paper suggests two paths for the future research. First, our approach should be applied to 
20:871:59529:12:13:56:542:221:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:wider  data  sets.  This  deals  not  only  with  the  size  of  the  data  sample,  but  also  with  its  generality:  our  data  
20:872:59660:13:13:56:545:208:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:concentrate  only  on  a  few  sectors,  and  only  on  goods  that  are  admittedly  eligible  for  intermodal  
20:873:59773:13:12:56:542:195:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:transportation.  Second,  the  distinction  between  specific  goods  and  generic  goods  seems  to  deserve  further  
20:874:59893:12:13:56:542:183:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:investigation.  On  the  one  hand,  evidence  is  necessary  to  understand  how  these  categories  relate  to  more  
20:875:60013:13:13:56:542:170:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:familiar categories of freight transport analysis and in particular to different sectors. The information on the 
20:876:60126:13:12:56:542:157:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:speficicity/genericity of the different good categories may prove important as much of the data available for 
20:877:60236:12:13:56:541:145:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:the analysis of freight movement is usually classified based on sectors. For this reason, a questionnaire has 
20:878:60346:13:13:56:542:132:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:been  commissioned  to  obtain  complementary  data  on  specificity  and  genericity  of  the  goods.  The  results  
20:879:60464:13:24:56:367:119:121:g_d0_f6:121:g_d0_f6:B:based on this extra survey will be the object of other communications.
