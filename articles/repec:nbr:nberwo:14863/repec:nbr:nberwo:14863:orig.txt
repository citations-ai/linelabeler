2:31:1606:28:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:To identify disruptions in credit markets, research on the role of asset prices in economic fluctuations
2:32:1710:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:has focused on the information content of various corporate credit spreads. We re-examine this evidence
2:33:1813:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:using a broad array of credit spreads constructed directly from the secondary bond prices on outstanding
2:34:1917:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:senior unsecured debt issued by a large panel of nonfinancial firms. An advantage of our "ground-up''
2:35:2018:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:approach is that we are able to construct matched portfolios of equity returns, which allows us to examine
2:36:2124:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:the information content of bond spreads that is orthogonal to the information contained in stock prices
2:37:2227:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:of the same set of firms, as well as in macroeconomic variables measuring economic activity, inflation,
2:38:2330:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:interest rates, and other financial indicators. Our portfolio-based bond spreads contain substantial predictive
2:39:2441:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:power for economic activity and outperform—especially at longer horizons—standard default-risk
2:40:2535:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:indicators. Much of the predictive power of bond spreads for economic activity is embedded in securities
2:41:2639:14:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:issued by intermediate-risk rather than high-risk firms. According to impulse responses from a structural
2:42:2744:14:14:72:540:420:12:Times:12:Times:factor-augmented vector autoregression, unexpected increases in bond spreads cause large and persistent
2:43:2847:14:14:72:540:406:12:Times:12:Times:contractions in economic activity. Indeed, shocks emanating from the corporate bond market account
2:44:2945:14:14:72:539:392:12:Times:12:Times:for more than 30 percent of the forecast error variance in economic activity at the two- to four-year
2:45:3045:14:14:72:540:378:12:Times:12:Times:horizon. Overall, our results imply that credit market shocks have contributed significantly to U.S.
2:46:3145:14:42:72:324:364:12:Times:12:Times:economic fluctuations during the 1990–2008 period.

3:67:3570:28:16:90:521:664:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:After markets for securitized credit products collapsed dramatically in the second half of
3:68:3660:16:17:90:522:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:2007, growth in a number of industrialized economies slowedmarkedly, suggesting that
3:69:3744:17:16:90:521:631:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:disruptions in financial markets can have important macroeconomic consequences.  The
3:70:3828:16:16:90:522:615:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:fact that sharp and sudden deteriorations in financial conditions are typically followed by
3:71:3919:16:17:90:522:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a prolonged period of economic weakness is a feature of a growing number of economic
3:72:4003:17:16:90:521:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:downturns in the U.S. and abroad.  During periods of credit market turmoil, financial
3:73:4088:16:17:90:522:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:asset prices, owing to their forward-looking nature, are especially informative of linkages
3:74:4179:17:16:90:521:549:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:between the real and financial sides of economy: Movements inasset prices can provide
3:75:4264:16:17:90:521:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:early-warning signals for such economic downturns and can beused to gauge the degree of
3:76:4351:17:16:90:222:516:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:strains in financial markets.
3:77:4380:16:16:106:521:500:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Past research on the role of asset prices in signaling futureeconomic conditions and
3:78:4464:16:17:89:521:484:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in propagating economic fluctuations has emphasized the information content of default-
3:79:4551:17:16:89:521:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:risk indicators such as corporate credit spreads—the difference in yields between various
3:80:4640:16:17:89:522:451:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:corporate debt instruments and government securities of comparable maturity—for the state
3:81:4729:17:16:89:522:434:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the economy and risks to the economic outlook.1In a recent paper, Philippon [2008]
3:82:4814:16:17:89:521:418:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:provides a theoretical framework in which the predictive content of corporate bond spreads
3:83:4904:17:16:89:522:401:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for economic activity—absent any financial frictions—reflects a general decline in economic
3:84:4995:16:17:89:522:385:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:fundamentals stemming from a reduction in the expected present value of corporate cash
3:85:5081:17:16:89:521:368:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:flows prior to a cyclical downturn. Rising credit spreads canalso reflect disruptions in the
3:86:5173:16:16:89:522:352:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:supply of credit resulting from the worsening in the qualityof corporate balance sheets
3:87:5260:16:17:89:522:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:or from the deterioration in the health of financial intermediaries that supply credit—the
3:88:5350:17:16:89:522:319:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:financial accelerator mechanism emphasized by Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist [1999]. In
3:89:5439:16:17:89:521:303:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:this context, a contraction in credit supply causes asset values to fall, incentives to default to
3:90:5537:17:16:89:521:286:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:increase, and yield spreads on private debt instruments to widen before economic downturns,
3:91:5628:16:17:89:425:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as lenders demand compensation for the expected increase indefaults.
3:92:5696:17:16:106:521:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In terms of forecasting macroeconomic conditions, the empirical success of this vein of
3:93:5783:16:16:89:521:237:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:research is considerable. Nevertheless, results vary substantially across different financial
3:94:5876:16:15:102:522:221:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:1The predictive content of various corporate credit spreads for economicactivity has been analyzed,
3:95:5975:15:11:89:521:206:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:among other, by Stock and Watson [1989]; Friedman and Kuttner [1998]; Duca [1999]; Emery [1999]; Gertler
3:96:6079:11:11:89:521:195:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:and Lown [1999]; Ewing, Lynch, and Payne [2003]; Mody and Taylor [2004]; and Mueller [2007]. In addition,
3:97:6184:11:11:89:522:184:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:Stock and Watson [2002b] have pointed out the ability of credit spreads to forecast economic growth using
3:98:6289:11:11:89:521:173:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:dynamic factor analysis, and King, Levin, and Perli [2007] find that corporate bond spread indexes contain
3:99:6395:11:11:89:522:162:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:important information about the near-term likelihood of a recession. In a related vein, an extensive empirical
3:100:6505:11:10:89:522:151:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:literature has emphasized the extent to which the slope of the yield curve—the so-called term spread—
3:101:6606:10:11:89:522:141:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:provides a signal for forecasting economic growth or for assessing the near-term risk of recession; see, for

3:103:6816:11:11:89:521:119:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:Kim [2002]. More recent work on this topic includes Ang, Piazzesi, and Wei[2006] and Wright [2006]. A
3:104:6917:11:11:89:522:108:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:comprehensive review of the literature on the role of asset prices inforecasting macroeconomic outcomes is

4:106:7061:0:17:90:522:694:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:instruments underlying the credit spreads under consideration as well as across different
4:107:7150:17:16:90:522:677:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:time periods. For example, the spread of yields between nonfinancial commercial paper and
4:108:7239:16:16:90:521:661:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:comparable-maturity Treasury bills—the so-called paper-bill spread—has lost much of its
4:109:7326:16:17:90:521:645:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:forecasting power since the early 1990s.2In contrast, yield spreads based on indexes of high-
4:110:7419:17:16:89:522:628:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:yield corporate bonds, which contain information from markets that were not in existence
4:111:7507:16:17:89:522:612:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:prior to the mid-1980s, have done particularly well at forecasting output growth during the
4:112:7598:17:16:89:521:595:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:previous decade, according to Gertler and Lown [1999] and Mody and Taylor [2004]. Stock
4:113:7685:16:33:89:521:579:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and Watson [2003b], however, find mixed evidence for the high-yield spread as a leading
4:114:7866:33:16:89:522:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:autumn of 1998. This dichotomy of findings is perhaps not surprising, because as financial
4:115:7956:16:17:89:521:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:markets evolve, the information content of specific financial assets prices may change as
4:116:8045:17:16:89:522:513:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:well. The fragility of results may also reflect the fact that this research has generally relied
4:117:8141:16:17:89:522:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on a single credit spread index, rather than on multiple indexes reflecting a broad cross-
4:118:8231:17:16:89:480:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:section—in terms of both default risk and maturity—of private debt instruments.
4:119:8310:16:17:106:522:464:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In addition to focusing on a single credit spread index, researchers often ignore the in-
4:120:8399:17:16:90:522:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:formation content of other asset prices when evaluating theforecasting ability of different
4:121:8490:16:16:90:521:431:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:default-risk indicators.  Although it is straightforward tocontrol for the general level of
4:122:8581:16:17:90:521:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:equity prices in such analysis, it is usually not possible toobtain equity valuations of the
4:123:8673:17:16:90:521:398:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:borrowers whose debt securities are used to construct the credit spreads under considera-
4:124:8762:16:17:90:522:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tion.3Such information could potentially be used to distinguish movements in corporate
4:125:8848:17:16:90:521:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:credit spreads that are due to general trends in financial asset prices associated with a
4:126:8937:16:17:90:522:349:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:given class of borrowers from the movements in spreads that are specifically related to
4:127:9024:17:16:90:242:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:developments in credit markets.

4:130:9232:16:16:90:522:283:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:credit instruments. The widely used paper-bill spreads, forexample, are based on short

4:134:9577:17:16:90:522:217:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ments reflect near-term default risk, whereas longer-maturity instruments are likely better at
4:135:9671:16:17:90:521:201:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:capturing expectations about future economic conditions one to two years ahead, a forecast
4:136:9761:17:16:90:521:184:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:horizon typically associated with business cycle fluctuations. Thus, a correct assessment of
4:137:9853:16:16:90:522:168:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the ability of credit spreads to forecast at business cycle frequencies likely requires careful
4:138:9948:16:15:102:521:152:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:2Indeed, Thoma and Gray [1998] and Emery [1999] argue that the predictive content of the paper-bill
4:139:10047:15:7:90:232:137:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:spread may reflect one-time events.

4:141:10181:15:11:90:522:115:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:the predictive content of various stock price indexes for economic activity and compare it to other financial

5:144:10402:17:16:106:521:677:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This paper considers credit spreads constructed directly from monthly data on prices of
5:145:10489:16:16:90:521:661:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:senior unsecured corporate debt traded in the secondary market over the 1990–2008 period,
5:146:10578:16:17:90:522:645:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:issued by about 900 U.S. nonfinancial corporations. In contrast to many other corporate
5:147:10665:17:16:90:522:628:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:financial instruments, long-term senior unsecured bonds represent a class of securities with
5:148:10757:16:17:90:522:612:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a long history containing a number of business cycles, an attribute that is most useful in the
5:149:10851:17:16:90:521:595:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:valuation process of debt instruments. In addition, the rapid pace of financial innovation
5:150:10941:16:33:90:522:579:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:over the past twenty years has not affected the basic structure of these securities. Thus,
5:151:11118:33:16:90:522:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:bonds is likely to provide more consistent signals regarding economic outcomes relative to
5:152:11208:16:17:90:521:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:spreads based on securities with a shorter history or securities whose structure or relevant
5:153:11300:17:16:90:346:513:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:market has undergone a significant structural change.
5:154:11353:16:17:106:521:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We exploit the cross-sectional heterogeneity of our data by constructing an array of
5:155:11437:17:16:89:522:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:credit-spread portfolios sorted by the issuer’s ex-ante expected probability of default and
5:156:11528:16:17:89:522:464:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the bond’s remaining term-to-maturity. In the construction of these “bond portfolios,” we
5:157:11617:17:16:89:522:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rely on the monthly firm-specific expected default frequencies (EDFs) constructed by the
5:158:11705:16:16:89:522:431:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Moody’s/KMV corporation. Because they are based on observable information in equity
5:159:11788:16:17:89:522:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:markets, EDFs provide a more timely and potentially more objective assessment of credit
5:160:11875:17:16:89:522:398:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:risk compared with the issuer’s credit rating. Importantly, by building bond portfolios from
5:161:11967:16:17:89:522:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the “ground up,” we can also construct portfolios of stock returns—sorted by the same
5:162:12052:17:16:89:521:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:credit-risk categories—corresponding to the firms that issued those bonds. These matched
5:163:12140:16:17:89:521:349:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:portfolios of stock returns, in turn, serve as controls for news about firms’ future earnings
5:164:12233:17:16:89:437:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as these corporate borrowers experience shocks to their creditworthiness.
5:165:12306:16:17:106:521:316:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Two empirical methods are employed to assess the role of credit market factors in eco-
5:166:12392:17:16:90:522:299:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:nomic fluctuations. First, the analysis documents the predictive content of corporate bond
5:167:12482:16:16:90:522:283:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:spreads in our credit-risk portfolios for measures of economic activity such as the growth
5:168:12572:16:17:90:522:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of nonfarm payroll employment and industrial production, and we compare the forecasting
5:169:12659:17:16:90:521:250:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:power of credit spreads in our EDF-based bond portfolios to that of other default-risk indi-
5:170:12751:16:17:90:521:234:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cators emphasized in the literature. The results show that at shorter forecast horizons, the
5:171:12843:17:16:90:522:217:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:information content of credit spreads in our EDF-based bond portfolios for these monthly
5:172:12931:16:17:90:521:201:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:measures of economic activity is comparable to that of standard credit spread indexes. At
5:173:13020:17:16:90:522:184:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:longer forecast horizons, however, our portfolios of credit spreads outperform—both in-
5:174:13107:16:16:90:521:168:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sample and out-of-sample—standard default-risk indicators by almost a factor of two. The
5:175:13195:16:17:90:521:152:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:results from these forecasting exercises indicate that thepredictive power of corporate bond
5:176:13287:17:16:90:522:135:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:spreads comes from the middle of the credit-quality spectrum, a result also documented by
5:177:13376:16:17:90:521:119:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Mueller [2007] who examines the predictive content of corporate bond spread indexes across
5:178:13466:17:0:90:522:102:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:different rating categories. Our results also indicate thatat longer forecasting horizons, the
6:179:13561:0:17:90:521:694:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:predictive power of corporate bond spreads is concentratedat long maturities. At these fore-
6:180:13653:17:16:90:522:677:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:casting horizons, the predictive content of publicly-available long maturity investment-grade
6:181:13746:16:16:90:521:661:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:corporate bond spread indexes—such as those rated between BBB and AA—is comparable
6:182:13828:16:17:90:521:645:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to that of our low-risk long maturity EDF portfolios. All told, these results imply that the
6:183:13920:17:16:90:521:628:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:forecasting ability of credit spreads is well captured by a single index that measures credit
6:184:14013:16:17:90:521:612:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:spreads of long maturity bonds issued by firms with low to medium probability of default.
6:185:14102:17:16:106:522:595:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The second empirical approach assesses the impact on the macroeconomy of move-
6:186:14180:16:33:90:521:579:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ments in credit spreads in our EDF-based bond portfolios within a structural factor-
6:187:14345:33:16:90:521:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:[2003], Bernanke, Boivin, and Eliasz [2005], and Stock and Watson [2005], an approach
6:188:14430:16:17:90:522:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:particularly well-suited to our case given the large number of variables under consideration.
6:189:14523:17:16:90:522:513:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Within the FAVAR framework, we identify credit market shocks from the corporate bond
6:190:14607:16:17:90:521:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:spreads that are orthogonal to general measures of economicactivity, inflation, real interest
6:191:14700:17:16:90:521:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rates, and various financial indicators, as well as to equityreturns of firms whose outstand-
6:192:14793:16:17:90:522:464:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ing bonds were used to construct credit spreads in our EDF-based portfolios. According
6:193:14879:17:16:90:521:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to the results from our FAVAR analysis, an unanticipated worsening of business credit
6:194:14964:16:16:90:521:431:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:conditions—identified through the widening of corporate bond spreads that is orthogonal
6:195:15051:16:17:90:521:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to other contemporaneous information—predicts substantial and long-lasting declines in
6:196:15137:17:16:90:522:398:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:economic activity.  The decomposition of the forecast errorvariance implies that these
6:197:15223:16:17:90:521:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:credit market shocks account, on average, for more than 30 percent of the variation in
6:198:15309:17:16:90:521:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:economic activity (as measured by industrial production) at the two- to four-year horizon.
6:199:15399:16:17:90:521:349:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We also find that incorporating information from the stock market does not alter any of
6:200:15486:17:16:90:522:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:our conclusions. Thus to the extent that equity returns capture news about firms’ future
6:201:15574:16:17:90:522:316:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:earnings, our FAVAR specification identifies shocks to credit spreads that are orthogonal to
6:202:15666:17:16:90:521:299:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:such news and hence are specific to events that lead to disruptions in the corporate bond
6:203:15755:16:16:90:522:283:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:market.4Overall, our results suggest that disturbances specific to credit markets account
6:204:15844:16:17:90:522:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for a substantial fraction of the volatility in U.S. economic activity during the 1990–2008
6:205:15935:17:16:90:123:250:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:period.
6:206:15942:16:17:106:522:234:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2discusses the characteristics
6:207:16032:17:16:89:522:217:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of our underlying security-level data, the construction of portfolios based on expected default

6:209:16217:17:16:89:521:184:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:EDF-based financial indicators.  Section 3 presents our forecasting exercises.  Section 4
6:210:16306:16:16:89:380:168:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:contains results of our FAVAR analysis. Section 5 concludes.
6:211:16366:16:15:102:521:152:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:4By examining the joint behavior of stock prices and TFP, Beaudry and Portier [2006], identify a compo-
6:212:16469:15:11:89:522:137:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:nent in stock returns that captures news about future permanent changes in TFP; moreover, they show that
6:213:16573:11:11:89:521:126:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:movements in this component explains a significant portion of U.S. business cycle fluctuations. Jermann
6:214:16676:11:11:89:522:115:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:and Quadrini [2007] develop a theoretical framework in which news about future technological opportunities
6:215:16782:11:11:89:521:104:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:raises firms’ current equity valuations, which relax credit constraints, thereby boosting current investment
6:216:16890:11:0:89:137:93:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:and output.
7:217:16902:0:28:90:235:692:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:2  Data Description
7:218:16921:28:16:90:521:664:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The key information for our analysis comes from a large sample of fixed income securi-
7:219:17007:16:17:90:521:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ties issued by U.S. nonfinancial corporations.  Specifically, for a sample of 899 publicly-
7:220:17098:17:16:90:521:631:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:traded firms covered by the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP), month-end
7:221:17182:16:16:90:522:615:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:secondary market prices of their outstanding long-term corporate bonds were drawn from
7:222:17268:16:17:90:521:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the Lehman/Warga (LW) and Merrill Lynch (ML) databases. These two data sources in-
7:223:17350:17:16:90:522:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:clude secondary market prices for a significant fraction of dollar-denominated bonds publicly
7:224:17443:16:17:90:522:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:issued in the U.S. corporate cash market. The ML database is aproprietary data source of
7:225:17531:17:16:90:522:549:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f3:dailybond prices that starts in 1997. Focused on the most liquid securities in the secondary
7:226:17623:16:17:90:522:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:market, bonds in the ML database must have a remaining term-to-maturity of at least two
7:227:17710:17:16:90:522:516:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:years, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of $100 million for
7:228:17794:16:16:90:522:500:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:below investment-grade and $150 million for investment-grade issuers.  By contrast, the
7:229:17881:16:17:90:522:484:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:LW database ofmonth-endbond prices has a somewhat broader coverage and is available
7:230:17964:17:16:89:372:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from 1973 through mid-1998 (see Warga [1991] for details).
7:231:18022:16:17:106:522:451:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To ensure that the bonds yields used to construct portfoliosare obtained from com-
7:232:18104:17:16:89:521:434:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:parable securities, the analysis is restricted to senior unsecured issues only. For such se-
7:233:18196:16:17:89:522:418:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:curities with market prices in both the LW and LM databases, option-adjusted effective
7:234:18282:17:16:89:521:401:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:yields at month-end—a component of the bond’s yield that is not attributable to embedded
7:235:18370:16:17:89:522:385:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:options—are spliced across the two data sources. To calculate the credit spread at each
7:236:18457:17:16:89:522:368:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:point in time, the resulting yield oneachindividual security issued by the firm is matched
7:237:18547:16:16:89:521:352:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to the estimated yield on the Treasury coupon security of thesame maturity. The month-
7:238:18633:16:17:89:521:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:end Treasury coupon yields were taken from the daily estimates of the U.S. Treasury yield
7:239:18722:17:16:89:521:319:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:curve reported in G ̈urkaynak, Sack, and Wright [2006]. To mitigate the effect of outliers,
7:240:18813:16:17:89:522:303:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the analysis eliminates all observations with credit spreads smaller than 10 basis points and
7:241:18906:17:16:89:522:286:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with spreads greater than 5,000 basis points; in addition, eliminated were issues with a par
7:242:18998:16:17:89:521:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:value of less than $1 million, as such small issues are likelyplagued by significant liquidity
7:243:19092:17:16:89:521:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:concerns. These selection criteria yielded a sample of 5,045 individual securities, covering
7:244:19184:16:16:89:327:237:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the period from January 1990 to September 2008.

7:246:19315:17:16:89:522:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sample. Note that a typical firm has only a few senior unsecured issues outstanding at any

7:248:19493:17:16:89:522:171:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:market at any given month. This distribution, however, exhibits a significant positive skew,
7:249:19585:16:17:89:521:155:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as the average firm has almost six different senior unsecured bond issues trading in the
7:250:19673:17:16:89:522:138:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:market at a point in time. The distribution of the market values of these issues is similarly
7:251:19766:16:16:89:521:122:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:skewed, with the range running from $1.1 million to nearly $6.7 billion. Not surprisingly,
7:252:19856:16:0:89:522:106:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the maturity of these debt instruments is fairly long, with the average maturity at issue

8:273:20989:16:17:90:522:353:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:bonds typically generate significant cash flow in the form of regular coupon payments, the

8:278:21359:16:17:106:521:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The coupon rate on our sample of bonds averaged 7.60 percent during the sample period,

8:280:21535:16:17:89:522:238:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:per annum. Reflecting the wide range of credit quality, the distribution of yields is quite
8:281:21626:17:16:89:522:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:wide, with the minimum of about 1.2 percent and the maximum ofmore than 57 percent.

8:285:21898:16:17:106:521:156:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A portion of observed credit spreads reflects compensation demanded by investors for
8:286:21982:17:16:90:522:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:bearing the risk that a firm who issued the bonds will default on its payment obligations.
8:287:22072:16:17:90:521:123:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To measures this firm-specific likelihood of default at each point in time, we employ a
8:288:22159:17:16:90:521:106:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:monthly indicator that is widely used by financial market participants—the “Expected
8:289:22243:16:0:90:522:90:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Default Frequency” (EDF). This measure of default risk is constructed and marketed by
9:290:22329:0:16:90:522:693:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the Moody’s/KMV Corporation (MKMV). It measures the probability of default over the
9:291:22412:16:17:90:522:677:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:subsequent twelve-month period. The theoretical underpinnings to these probabilities of
9:292:22499:17:16:90:522:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:default are provided by the seminal work of Merton [1973, 1974]. According to this option-
9:293:22589:16:16:90:522:644:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:theoretic approach, the probability that a firm will defaulton its debt obligations at any
9:294:22679:16:17:90:522:628:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:point in the future is determined by three major factors: themarket value of the firm’s
9:295:22766:17:16:90:521:611:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:assets; asset volatility; the risk-free interest rate and the firm’s leverage.5These factors are
9:296:22862:16:25:89:484:595:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:combined into a single measure of default risk calleddistance to default, defined as

9:317:23043:41:16:106:521:514:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Because the market value of assets and the volatility of assets are not directly observable,
9:318:23135:16:17:89:522:498:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:they have to be computed in order to calculate the distance todefault. Assuming that the
9:319:23223:17:16:89:522:481:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:firm’s assets are traded, the market value of the firm’s equitycan be viewed as a call option

9:321:23409:17:16:89:522:448:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:debt.6Using this insight, MKMV “backs out” the market value and thevolatility of assets
9:322:23496:16:17:89:522:432:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from a proprietary variant of the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, employing the
9:323:23586:17:16:89:522:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:observed book value of liabilities and the market value of equity as inputs (see Crosbie and
9:324:23678:16:16:89:522:399:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Bohn [2003] for details). In the final step, MKMV transforms the distance to default into
9:325:23767:16:17:89:522:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:an expected probability of default—the so-called EDF—usingan empirical distribution of

9:330:24071:16:16:90:522:278:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:default-risk portfolios are constructed by sorting credit spreads and excess equity returns in
9:331:24165:16:15:102:521:262:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:5In the original work of Merton [1974], the default point is equal to the book value of liabilities. Later
9:332:24271:15:11:90:521:247:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:structural default models relax this assumptions and allow for endogenous capital structure as well as
9:333:24373:11:11:90:521:236:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:strategic default. In these models, both the default time and default boundary are determined endogenously
9:334:24479:11:11:90:522:225:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:and depend on firm-specific as well as aggregate factors; the voluminous literature on structural default
9:335:24584:11:11:90:521:214:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:models is summarized by Duffie and Singleton [2003]. Recent theoretical work has examined the importance
9:336:24688:11:11:90:522:203:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:of aggregate risk and different specifications of investors’ preferencesfor generating default-risk premiums
9:337:24796:11:11:90:522:192:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:and matching historical credit spreads; see, for example, Chen, Collin-Dufresne, and Goldstein [2008] and
9:338:24901:11:11:90:522:181:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:Chen [2008]. Empirically, however, MKMV has found that most defaults occur when the market value of
9:339:25000:11:11:90:521:170:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:the firm’s assets drops to the value equal to the sum of the firm’s current liabilities and one-half of long-term
9:340:25113:11:11:90:521:159:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:liabilities (i.e., Default Point = Current Liabilities + 0.5×Long-Term Liabilities), and the default point is
9:341:25222:11:7:90:181:148:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:calibrated accordingly.
9:342:25245:7:15:102:521:141:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:6The assumption that all of the firm’s assets are traded is clearly inappropriate in most cases. Neverthe-
9:343:25351:15:11:90:522:126:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:less, as shown by Ericsson and Reneby [2004], this approach is still validprovided that at least one of the
9:344:25458:11:7:90:248:115:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:firm’s securities (e.g., equity) is traded.
9:345:25501:7:15:102:522:108:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:7Excess equity returns, which include dividends and capital gains, are measured relative to the yield on

10:348:25718:17:16:89:521:677:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:maturity, we split each EDF-based quintile of credit spreadsinto four maturity categories:
10:349:25808:16:16:89:521:661:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(1)short maturity: credit spreads of bonds with the remaining term-to-maturityof less
10:350:25893:16:17:89:521:645:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:than (or equal) to 3 years; (2)intermediate maturity: credit spreads of bonds with the
10:351:25979:17:16:89:522:628:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f7:remaining term-to-maturity of more than 3 years but less than (or equal) 7 years; (3)long
10:352:26068:16:17:89:521:612:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f3:maturity: credit spreads of bonds with the remaining term-to-maturityof more than 7 years
10:353:26157:17:16:89:522:595:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:but less than (or equal) to 15 years; (4)very long maturity: credit spreads of bonds with
10:354:26246:16:33:89:522:579:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the remaining term-to-maturity of more than 15 years. We then compute an arithmetic
10:355:26413:33:16:89:522:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:average of excess equity returns in monthtfor each EDF portfolio. This procedure yields
10:356:26500:16:17:89:522:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:20 bond portfolios of credit spreads (five EDF quintiles and four maturity categories) and

12:473:33588:11:11:90:522:102:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:correctly specified, iterated forecasts are more efficient, whereas the directh-step ahead forecasts are more

13:481:34261:23:17:89:522:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This section examines the in-sample predictive power of various credit spreads for our two
13:482:34351:17:16:89:521:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:measures of economic activity. The upper panel of Table 3 contains the results of this exer-
13:483:34443:16:16:89:521:539:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cise for the short-run forecast horizon (3 months), whereas the lower panel contains results
13:484:34535:16:17:89:521:523:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for the long-run forecast horizon (12 months). In both cases,we reportp-values associated
13:485:34624:17:16:89:521:506:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with the exclusion tests on the two sets of credit spreads along with the explanatory power
13:486:34715:16:17:89:521:490:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f7:of each forecasting equation as measured by the adjustedR2. As a benchmark, theMemo
13:487:34798:17:16:89:521:473:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:item in both panels contains the in-sample fit from the VAR specification that excludes all
13:488:34889:16:17:89:158:457:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:credit spreads.
13:489:34904:17:16:106:521:440:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:When forecasting employment growth, the inclusion of credit spreads leads only to a
13:490:34987:16:16:89:521:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:modest improvement in the in-sample fit at the 3-month forecasthorizon. As evidenced by
13:491:35074:16:17:89:522:408:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:thep-values reported in the upper panel of Table 3, both the standard credit spread indexes
13:492:35165:17:16:89:522:391:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and credit spreads in each EDF quintile are statistically significant predictors of employment
13:493:35259:16:17:89:521:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:growth three months ahead. Moreover, when both sets of credit spreads are included in
13:494:35344:17:16:89:521:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the forecasting VAR, they all tend to remain statistically significant. Nevertheless, adding
13:495:35436:16:17:89:522:342:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:either set of credit spreads to the VAR results only in a relatively modest improvement in the
13:496:35530:17:16:89:522:325:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:explanatory power of the equation for employment growth. For example, the specification
13:497:35617:16:16:89:522:309:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that excludes all credit spreads yields an adjustedR2of 69 percent, only about 9 percentage
13:498:35708:16:17:89:522:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:points below the adjustedR2from a specification that includes standard credit spread
13:499:35792:17:16:89:351:276:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:indexes and credit spreads in the second EDF quintile.
13:500:35846:16:17:106:522:260:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The inclusion of credit spreads in the equation for industrial production, in contrast,
13:501:35933:17:16:89:522:243:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:leads to a substantial increase in predictive accuracy at the 3-month forecast horizon. Ac-
13:502:36024:16:15:98:522:227:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:10Commercial paper rates are taken from the “Commercial Paper Rates and Outstanding” Federal Reserve
13:503:36124:15:10:90:522:212:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:statistical release.  The source of Treasury yields and yields on Aaa- andBaa-rated corporate bonds is
13:504:36226:10:11:90:522:202:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:“Selected Interest Rates” (H.15) Federal Reserve statistical release.  To construct the high-yield spread,
13:505:36332:11:11:90:522:191:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:we use the High-Yield Master II index, a commonly used benchmark index for long-term speculative-grade
13:506:36434:11:8:90:284:180:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:corporate bonds administered by Merrill Lynch.
13:507:36480:8:14:98:522:172:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:11Note that we construct our standard corporate bond spread indexes using the ten-year Treasury yield.
13:508:36582:14:11:90:521:158:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:As emphasized by Duffee [1998], the corporate-Treasury yield spreads canbe influenced significantly by
13:509:36684:11:11:90:521:147:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:time-varying prepayment risk premiums, reflecting the call provisions on corporate issues.  According to
13:510:36788:11:11:90:522:136:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:Duca [1999], corporate bond spreads measured relative to the yield on Aaa-rated bonds are more reflective
13:511:36893:11:11:90:521:125:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:of default risk than those measured relative to comparable-maturity Treasuries, which makes the former
13:512:36995:11:11:90:521:114:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:spreads more correlated with economic downturns. For comparison, we computed the Baa and the high-
13:513:37093:11:0:90:427:103:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:yield bond spread relative to the Aaa yield, and our results were virtually identical.

15:559:39829:16:17:90:522:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:employment, for example, standard credit spread indexes explain 66 percent of the variation
15:560:39920:17:16:90:521:513:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the 12-month ahead growth rate, a significant increases in the goodness-of-fit relative to

15:570:40810:16:17:90:522:349:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:associated with the first three EDF quintiles (EDF-Q1–EDF-Q3)explain over 50 percent
15:571:40894:17:16:90:434:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the variation in the 12-month ahead growth rate of industrial output.
15:572:40966:16:17:106:521:316:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The results in Table 3 highlight the gains in in-sample predictive accuracy for employ-

15:574:41140:16:16:90:521:283:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on credit spreads in our EDF-based bond portfolios. The results of these forecasting exer-
15:575:41230:16:17:90:521:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cises indicate that the information content of credit spreads is concentrated in the low to
15:576:41321:17:16:90:522:250:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:medium risk categories. As we show below, the predictive content of credit spreads is also
15:577:41411:16:17:90:522:234:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:concentrated at the long end of the maturity spectrum. This result is shown graphically in
15:578:41501:17:16:90:522:217:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 1, where the two panels depict the actual 12-month ahead growth of employment

15:581:41760:16:16:90:522:168:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Q2 portfolio—that is, the portfolio with the highest overall predictive content, according
15:582:41850:16:17:90:521:152:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to the results in Table 3.  Note that these fitted values are a simple renormalization of
15:583:41939:17:16:90:522:135:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the credit spread dated 12 months before the time period overwhich the growth in em-
15:584:42023:16:17:90:521:119:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ployment and industrial production was computed. Remarkably, this single credit spread

16:618:43340:23:17:90:522:130:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This section examines the predictive content of credit spreads for our two measures of eco-
16:619:43431:17:16:90:521:113:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:nomic activity using pseudo out-of-sample forecasts. Specifically, for each forecast horizon
16:620:43523:16:0:90:522:97:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f3:h, the forecasting VAR given in equations 1–2 is estimated using all available data through,
17:621:43617:0:16:90:521:693:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and including, November 1999. We then calculate the (annualized)h-month ahead growth
17:622:43701:16:17:89:522:677:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rates of nonfarm payroll employment and industrial production and the associated forecast
17:623:43790:17:16:89:521:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:errors. The forecast origin—that is, November 1999—is thenupdated with an additional

17:625:43957:16:17:89:522:628:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:window, and new forecasts are generated. This procedure is repeated through the end of
17:626:44043:17:16:89:522:611:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the sample, thereby generating a sequence of pseudo out-of-sample forecasts for the two
17:627:44130:16:17:89:234:595:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:measures of economic activity.
17:628:44160:17:33:106:521:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Tables 4 contains the results of this exercise.  To quantify the pseudo out-of-sample
17:629:44338:33:16:89:522:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:mean squared forecast error in annualized percentage points (RMSFE) for each specification.

17:631:44519:16:17:89:521:513:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that of standard default-risk indicators, we then compute the ratio of the mean squared
17:632:44606:17:16:89:521:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:forecast error (MSFE) of the VAR specification augmented with EDF-based credit spreads

17:638:45058:17:16:89:522:397:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in our EDF-based bond portfolios yield lower MSFEs at short-run forecast horizons than
17:639:45144:16:16:89:521:381:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the specification augmented with standard credit spread indexes. At the 3-month forecast
17:640:45232:16:17:89:522:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:horizon, the out-of-sample forecasting performance of credit spreads in the first three EDF

17:642:45409:16:17:89:521:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:indexes by 20 to 25 percent, and these improvements in predictive accuracy are statistically
17:643:45501:17:16:89:521:315:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:significant at the 10 to 15 percent level.  The out-of-sample forecasting performance of
17:644:45589:16:17:89:522:299:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:credit spreads in our EDF-based bond portfolios for the growth of industrial production also
17:645:45681:17:16:89:521:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:exceeds that of standard default-risk indicators at the 3-month forecast horizon, although
17:646:45771:16:16:89:522:266:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the differences in predictive accuracy are not statistically significant at conventional levels.
17:647:45867:16:17:106:521:250:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The gain in out-of-sample predictive accuracy at the 12-month forecast horizon is espe-
17:648:45954:17:16:89:521:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cially striking, a result consistent with the in-sample analysis of the previous section. The

17:651:46225:16:17:89:522:184:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the MSFEs on the order of 60 percent relative to the specification that includes the standard
17:652:46318:17:16:89:522:167:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:set of credit spread indexes. Moreover, these improvementsin predictive accuract are also
17:653:46407:16:16:89:419:151:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:highly statistically significant according to the Diebold-Mariano test.
17:654:46478:16:20:106:519:135:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The results reported in Table 4 point to significant improvements in the out-of-sample
17:655:46564:20:15:98:521:115:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:12Because the data in our forecasting VAR specification are overlapping, the asymptotic (long-run) vari-

20:764:51402:17:16:90:521:628:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:based forecasts capture the slowdown in economic activity associated with the 2001 recession
20:765:51494:16:17:90:522:612:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as well as the subsequent recovery. These EDF-based forecasts also predict the slowdown
20:766:51581:17:16:90:497:595:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in economic activity that has emerged since late 2006 with a high degree of accuracy.

20:770:52019:17:16:90:521:513:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:nonfarm payrolls will fall about 7.5 percent, while industrial production is projected to drop
20:771:52113:16:17:90:522:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:around 20 percent, declines that are four times greater thanthose experienced during the

20:775:52349:17:16:90:522:408:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In the FAVAR analysis below, real economic activity is summarized by a factor that relies,
20:776:52439:16:17:90:522:392:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in addition to the growth in employment and industrial production, on nine additional
20:777:52524:17:16:90:522:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:macroeconomic indicators that measure economic activity.Some of these series are leading
20:778:52612:16:17:90:522:359:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:indicators, or forward-looking variables such as new manufacturing orders, whereas other
20:779:52700:17:16:90:521:342:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:series such as unemployment are relatively sluggish. To assess the ability of credit spreads to
20:780:52795:16:16:90:522:326:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:forecast this broader set of economic indicators, we construct an index of economic activity,
20:781:52888:16:17:90:391:310:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:defined as the first principal component of these 11 time-series.
20:782:52953:17:16:106:521:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Table 5 reports both the in-sample and out-of-sample results obtained from univariate

20:784:53130:17:16:90:521:260:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the economic activity index. These results are very similar to those obtained using growth

20:786:53314:17:16:90:522:227:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the lowest three EDF quintiles provide modest improvements in out-of-sample forecasting
20:787:53404:16:16:90:521:211:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:performance at the 3-month horizon, and quantitatively large and statistically significant
20:788:53494:16:17:90:415:195:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:gains—both in-sample and out-of-sample—at the 12-month horizon.
20:789:53557:17:16:106:522:178:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:As a final exercise, we explore the extent to which the predictive content of credit
20:790:53641:16:17:90:522:162:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:spreads depends on the maturity structure of the underlyingsecurities. Because our credit
20:791:53730:17:16:90:522:145:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:spreads rely on proprietary measures of default risk and issue-specific bond yields, we are
20:792:53821:16:25:90:521:129:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:also interested in determining whether ratings-based credit spreads yield similar forecasting
20:793:53914:25:15:98:522:104:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:13The year-over-year forecasts for December 2009 are based on the realized values of the two forecasting
20:794:54018:15:0:90:521:89:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:variables through December 2008, but we only use data through September 2008 to compute these forecasts.

23:900:60361:16:17:89:521:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:financial time series by a small number of unobservable (latent) factors. This methodology
23:901:60451:17:16:89:522:250:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is then used to identify shocks to corporate bond spreads andtrace out their dynamic effect
23:902:60542:16:16:89:196:234:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on the macroeconomy.
23:903:60562:16:15:98:521:218:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:14The BFV model provides daily estimates of the corporate bond yield curve utilizing prices of bonds
23:904:60662:15:11:90:522:203:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:with similar characteristics (i.e., currency, market type, industry, and credit rating). For comparability with
23:905:60773:11:11:90:522:192:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:our bond-level data, the sample is restricted to dollar-denominated bonds issued by industrial firms. For
23:906:60878:11:11:90:521:181:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:this segment of the corporate bond market, zero-coupon yields for AA- and BBB-rating categories at the
23:907:60980:11:10:90:521:170:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:maturities of 3-month, 6-month, 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 4-year, 5-year, 7-year, 10-year, 15-year, 20-year, and
23:908:61090:10:11:90:522:160:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:30-year were obtained from the Bloomberg BFV data base. These two ratingcategories represent the highest
23:909:61194:11:11:90:522:149:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:and lowest ratings for which spreads at all maturities are available since April 1991, the starting date of
23:910:61301:11:11:90:522:138:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:the Bloomberg data. Credit spreads at all maturities are computed by utilizing daily Treasury yields of the
23:911:61408:11:11:90:521:127:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:same maturities, derived from the estimates of the zero-coupon Treasury yield curve (see G ̈urkaynak, Sack,
23:912:61515:11:11:90:522:116:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:and Wright [2006]). For each rating categories, we then constructed the samefour maturity categories as
23:913:61618:11:0:90:416:105:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:for our EDF-based portfolio and averaged the spreads in each maturity category.

24:920:62190:16:17:89:521:588:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:assume that the information in the vector of observable variablesXtcan be summarized by a

24:967:63397:16:17:89:521:246:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:errors are uncorrelated with VAR innovations—that is,E[νitǫjt] = 0, fort= 1, . . . , T;

24:969:63520:16:16:106:522:213:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To identify the vector of credit factorsF2t, we impose the following restrictions on
24:970:63604:16:17:90:522:197:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the system of equation 3 and 4.  First, we assume thatΛ12=0in equation 3.  This
24:971:63683:17:16:90:521:180:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:restriction on the factor loadings implies that once we haveconditioned on the factors

24:973:63854:16:15:98:521:148:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:15Consistent with the assumptions underlying approximate factor models, the process for the vector of
24:974:63955:15:11:90:522:133:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:measurement errorsνtcan be weakly serially correlated and exhibit some degree of cross-sectional dependence
24:975:64062:11:11:89:522:122:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:(see, for example, Bai and Ng [2002]). Because the latent factors enter equation 3 without lags, the above
24:976:64168:11:11:89:522:111:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:specification corresponds to the static form of a dynamic factor model. However, as discussed by Stock and
24:977:64274:11:11:89:522:100:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:Watson [2005], this is not a restrictive assumption, because the static factors can, in principle, contain an
24:978:64383:11:0:89:337:89:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:arbitrary number of lags of some underlying dynamic factors.
25:979:64445:0:17:90:522:694:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:has a systematic component specific to the corporate bond market that is reflected in
25:980:64530:17:16:90:521:677:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:its own factor structure.  Although the credit factors inF2thave no contemporaneous
25:981:64613:16:16:90:521:661:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:effect on the vectorX1t, they affect the factors inF1t—and, by extension, the vector of

25:983:64787:17:16:90:521:628:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:identifying assumption is that the factors inF1tandF2tare orthogonal, an assumption that
25:984:64875:16:17:90:521:612:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:separates the residual information content from the corporate bond market from the factors

25:1014:67430:11:11:90:521:109:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:from the second step, by construction, orthogonal toF1, implying that the estimated factorsF2are also
25:1015:67531:11:0:89:161:98:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:orthogonal toF1.

26:1023:68132:17:33:106:521:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Price developments are summarized by the following six inflation indicators: (1) the
26:1024:68309:33:16:89:522:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the log-difference of the Producer Price index (PPI); (4) the log-difference of the core PPI;
26:1025:68402:16:16:89:521:529:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(5) the log-difference of the Journal of Commerce index of (spot) commodity prices; (6) the
26:1026:68493:16:17:89:522:513:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:log-difference of the price of oil as measured by price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate
26:1027:68587:17:16:89:153:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(WTI) crude.
26:1028:68599:16:17:106:522:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Our FAVAR specification also includes the entire term structure of interest rates, starting
26:1029:68690:17:16:89:521:463:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:at the short end with the effective federal funds rate and continuing with the constant
26:1030:68777:16:17:89:522:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:maturity Treasury yields at 6-month, 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year horizons,
26:1031:68867:17:16:89:521:430:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for a total of seven interest rates. Because nominal yields exhibit a discernible downward
26:1032:68957:16:17:89:522:414:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:trend over our sample period (1990–2008), they are converted into real terms to ensure their
26:1033:69049:17:16:89:218:397:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:approximate stationarity.17
26:1034:69076:16:16:106:522:381:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Developments in equity markets are summarized by the following eight series: (1) the
26:1035:69160:16:17:89:522:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:total value-weighted excess market return from CRSP; (2) theexcess equity returns of
26:1036:69244:17:16:89:522:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:firms in our five EDF-based stock portfolios; and (3) the Fama-French “SMB” and “HML”
26:1037:69329:16:17:89:521:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:factors to account for the different dynamics of equity returns in our EDF-based stock port-
26:1038:69421:17:16:89:521:315:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:folios. The final group of variables in the vectorX1t—six series—includes: (1) the implied
26:1039:69511:16:17:90:522:299:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:volatility on the S&P 500 index options (VIX) to capture uncertainty in the equity market;
26:1040:69601:17:16:90:522:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(2) the implied volatilities on Eurodollar and ten-year Treasury note futures, measures of
26:1041:69691:16:16:90:521:266:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:uncertainty associated with movements in short- and long-term interest rates, respectively;
26:1042:69782:16:17:90:522:250:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(3) the log-difference of the trade-weighted exchange value ofthe dollar against major cur-
26:1043:69873:17:15:98:522:233:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:17To do so, we utilize both the realized inflation and survey measures of inflation expectations reported
26:1044:69978:15:11:90:522:218:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:by the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF). Because the SPF is conducted at a quarterly frequency,
26:1045:70081:11:11:90:521:207:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:monthly estimates of inflation expectations are obtained from a linear interpolation of quarterly values.
26:1046:70186:11:11:90:521:196:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:Specifically, the real federal funds rate is measured as the difference between the nominal rate and realized
26:1047:70295:11:11:90:522:185:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:inflation, where the realized inflation is given by the the differencebetween the log of the core CPI price
26:1048:70402:11:11:90:522:174:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:index and its lagged value 12 months earlier. The real 6-month Treasury yield is measured as the difference
26:1049:70509:11:10:90:522:163:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:between the nominal yield and the equally-weighted average of the realized inflation given above and the one-
26:1050:70618:10:11:90:522:153:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:year ahead expected CPI inflation as reported in the SPF. For the remaining Treasury yields, the expected
26:1051:70723:11:11:90:522:142:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:inflation at each specific horizon is constructed by calculating the appropriately weighted average of the one-
26:1052:70834:11:11:90:521:131:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:year ahead and the ten-year ahead expected CPI inflation reported in the SPF. For example, in calculating
26:1053:70939:11:11:90:522:120:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:the 5-year real Treasury yield, we employ a simplifying assumptionthat the expected inflation over the next
26:1054:71046:11:11:90:521:109:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:five years is equal to an equally-weighted average of one-year ahead and ten-year ahead expected inflation
26:1055:71152:11:0:90:185:98:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:as reported in the SPF.
27:1056:71177:0:16:90:522:693:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rencies to control for the international dimension of the U.S. financial system; and (4) two
27:1057:71269:16:17:90:522:677:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:standard measures of liquidity—namely, the difference in the yields between the “off-the-
27:1058:71358:17:16:90:521:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:run” and “on-the-run” 10-year Treasury note and the difference between the 5-year swap
27:1059:71444:16:16:90:315:644:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rate and the yield on the 5-year Treasury note.
27:1060:71491:16:17:106:521:628:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Thus in our baseline specification, the vectorX1tcontains 38 monthly macroeconomic
27:1061:71573:17:16:90:522:611:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and financial time series, and the 20 elements of vectorX2tcorrespond to the average credit
27:1062:71664:16:17:90:522:595:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:spreads in the 20 corporate bond portfolios classified by maturity and default risk. With
27:1063:71753:17:33:90:521:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:this specification, our assumptions identify credit marketshocks that are orthogonal to the
27:1064:71929:33:16:90:521:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:based bond portfolios underlying the information content of the vectorX2t. Hence, the
27:1065:72014:16:16:90:522:529:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:FAVAR traces out the effect of a shock to corporate bond spreads that is unrelated to news
27:1066:72104:16:17:90:333:513:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:contained in stock returns of the same set of firms.
27:1067:72156:17:16:106:521:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The remaining question concerns the number of latent factors (k1andk2) and the order
27:1068:72240:16:17:90:521:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the VAR systemp.  In our baseline specification,k1= 4 andk2= 2.18Under this
27:1069:72318:17:16:90:522:463:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:parametrization, four common factors—denoted byF1t= [F11tF21tF31tF41t]′—are assumed
27:1070:72401:16:17:90:521:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to summarize the information contained in the vectorX1t, whereas the residual component
27:1071:72488:17:16:90:521:430:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of credit spreads in our EDF-based bond portfolios can be represented by two factors,
27:1072:72573:16:17:90:521:414:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:denoted byF2t= [F12tF22t]′. The order of the VAR system is set top= 6, a lag length
27:1073:72656:17:32:90:376:397:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:chosen according to the Akaike information criterion (AIC).

27:1075:72752:23:17:90:521:342:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Before turning to our main results, we briefly discuss the estimates of the factorsF1t=
27:1076:72839:17:16:90:521:325:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:[F11tF21tF31tF41t]′and credit factorsF2t= [F11tF21t]′from the baseline specification. The first
27:1077:72934:16:16:90:522:309:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:four panels of Figure 3 depict the four factors associated with macroeconomic and financial
27:1078:73025:16:17:90:522:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:variables contained in the vectorX1t, and the bottom two panels show the estimates of the
27:1079:73114:17:16:90:521:276:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:two credit factors identified using the information from thecorporate bond market. (Tables

27:1082:73303:16:17:106:521:227:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:According to the correlations between the estimated factors and macroeconomic vari-

27:1084:73480:16:14:98:521:194:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:18Recently, Bai and Ng [2002, 2007] and Stock and Watson [2005] have proposed several methods of how
27:1085:73580:14:11:90:522:180:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:to select formally the number of factors in such models. Because of the added complexity reflecting our
27:1086:73683:11:11:90:521:169:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:identification procedure, we adopted a more informal approach. Specifically, employing reasoning similar to
27:1087:73790:11:11:90:521:158:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:that of Forni, Giannone, Lippi, and Reichlin [2005] and Giannone, Reichlin, and Sala [2005],k1was chosen
27:1088:73894:11:11:89:521:147:9:g_d0_f6:6:g_d0_f18:by looking at the increase in the explained variation of the 38 macroeconomic and financial series inX1t
27:1089:73998:11:11:89:521:136:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:that resulted from increasing the number of factors inF1t. Given our choice ofk1, the number of credit
27:1090:74100:11:11:90:522:125:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:factorsk2was selected using the same approach. As a robustness check, we increased the number of factors
27:1091:74204:11:11:90:522:114:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:extracted from the data matrixX1from four to five, and to six, and we increased the number of factors
27:1092:74305:11:11:90:521:103:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:extracted from the data matrixX2to three. None of the resulting FAVAR specifications yielded materially

30:1225:77590:0:16:90:521:692:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:intervals, are shown in Appendix B.19) This credit market shock widens corporate bond
30:1226:77675:16:16:90:521:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:spreads across the entire spectrum of credit quality and across all maturities. The response
30:1227:77767:16:17:90:521:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of credit spreads associated with riskier bond portfolios is significantly greater than that of
30:1228:77862:17:16:90:522:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the less risky portfolios and is also more persistent. Furthermore, the jump in the riskiest
30:1229:77954:16:17:90:522:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:corporate bond spreads is somewhat more pronounced at the short end of the maturity
30:1230:78037:17:16:90:137:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:spectrum.
30:1231:78046:16:17:106:521:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The impact of this credit shock on selected macroeconomic variables is shown in Fig-
30:1232:78130:17:16:89:521:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ure 5. A shock to the first credit factor is clearly contractionary, as evidenced by the fact
30:1233:78223:16:17:89:522:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that industrial production declines about 1 percentage points over a 24-month period.20In
30:1234:78312:17:16:89:522:544:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:addition to being statistically significant, the cumulative contraction in industrial output
30:1235:78404:16:16:89:522:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in response to a credit shock is economically significant, especially given that the response
30:1236:78497:16:17:89:521:512:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of credit spreads is in the order of only 10-50 basis points formost of the credit-risk distri-
30:1237:78592:17:16:89:522:495:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:bution. The increasing slack in resource utilization following a shock to the corporate bond
30:1238:78684:16:17:89:522:479:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:market is associated with a modest decline in the level of core CPI prices. These macroe-
30:1239:78773:17:16:89:521:462:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:conomic developments, in turn, lead to a fall in the general level of real interest rates. In
30:1240:78866:16:17:89:522:446:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:particular, real short-term interest rates decline about 15basis points at the trough, but
30:1241:78956:17:16:89:521:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:longer-term real Treasury yields fall somewhat less along the path, implying a steepening of
30:1242:79048:16:16:89:519:413:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the real Treasury yield curve in response to the innovation in the corporate bond spreads.
30:1243:79138:16:17:106:521:397:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The contractionary effects of this credit market shock implies a cumulative decline in
30:1244:79224:17:16:89:522:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the excess stock market return of about 2 percentage points over the horizon shown. The
30:1245:79311:16:17:89:522:364:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cumulative excess equity returns of the least and the most risky firms also fall initially,
30:1246:79402:17:16:89:521:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:though the latter effect is statistically indistinguishable from zero.  The impact of this
30:1247:79492:16:17:89:522:331:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:adverse credit market shock is also reflected in stock marketuncertainty, as the option-
30:1248:79580:17:16:89:521:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:implied volatility on the S&P 500 (VIX) increases notably inthe first six months after the
30:1249:79670:16:16:89:521:298:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:shock. In summary, a shock to the first credit factor implies amodest increase in the overall
30:1250:79763:16:17:89:521:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:level of corporate bond spreads that leads to a sizable contraction in industrial output, a
30:1251:79854:17:18:89:519:265:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:deceleration in core prices, lower real interest rates and equity returns, and a rise in stock
30:1252:79948:18:15:98:521:247:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:19The confidence intervals of the impulse response functions are basedon a two-stage bootstrap procedure
30:1253:80052:15:11:90:521:232:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:that takes into account both the serial correlation and cross-sectional dependence of the measurement errors
30:1254:80160:11:11:90:521:221:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:in equation 3.  In particular, we first estimate the factors and factor loadings following the estimation
30:1255:80265:11:11:90:522:210:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:procedure described above. We then perform a sieve bootstrap on the residuals of the observation equation 3.
30:1256:80373:11:11:90:522:199:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:For each bootstrapped sample, we also re-estimate the factorsF1andF2, thereby taking into account that
30:1257:80475:11:11:90:521:188:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:the factors appear as generated regressors in equation 4. Second, for each bootstrap loop of the observation
30:1258:80583:11:11:90:522:177:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:equation, we apply the “bootstrap-after-bootstrap” procedure of Kilian [1998] to the state-space equation 4
30:1259:80690:11:11:90:522:166:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:using the bootstrapped factors. This procedure is designed to takeinto account the small sample bias, the
30:1260:80795:11:11:90:521:155:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:lack of scale invariance, and the skewness of the distribution of the impulse response functions of the VAR
30:1261:80902:11:7:90:120:144:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:system.
30:1262:80909:7:15:98:522:137:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:20As discussed above, the macroeconomic and financial variables containedin the vectorX1twere, if
30:1263:81006:15:11:90:522:122:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:necessary, transformed using log or simple differencing to ensuretheir stationarity.  In such a case, we
30:1264:81110:11:11:90:522:111:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:cumulate their impulse responses to depict the impact of the credit market shock on levels of these variables;
30:1265:81220:11:10:90:521:100:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:similarly, we compute and show the cumulative responses of both the excess market return and the excess
30:1266:81323:10:0:90:286:90:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:equity returns of firms in the five EDF quintiles.

33:1639:84876:16:16:106:522:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To examine the economic importance of credit market shocks,we calculate the propor-
33:1640:84959:16:17:89:522:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tion of the forecast error variance attributable to the innovations associated with the first
33:1641:85052:17:16:89:522:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:credit market factor. Figure 6 reports the average proportion of the forecast error variance
33:1642:85144:16:17:89:522:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:at different horizons for selected variables in our FAVAR specification that is explained by
33:1643:85236:17:16:89:521:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:our identified credit market shock, along with the respective 95-percent confidence intervals.
33:1644:85330:16:17:89:521:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:According to results in Figure 6, shocks to corporate bond spreads account, on average, for
33:1645:85421:17:16:89:521:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:more than 30 percent of the variation in the growth of industrial production at the two-
33:1646:85509:16:17:89:521:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to four-year forecast horizon. The shock to the first credit factor also explains a significant
33:1647:85604:17:16:89:521:544:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:fraction of the variation in both short- and long-term real interest rates and accounts for
33:1648:85695:16:16:89:521:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:30 percent of the forecast error variance in the excess equity returns. This credit market
33:1649:85785:16:17:89:522:512:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:shock also accounts for a large fraction of the variation in corporate bond spreads but at a
33:1650:85877:17:16:89:522:495:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:higher frequency. Thus, variation in corporate bond spreads at the one- to two-year horizon
33:1651:85968:16:17:89:521:479:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:appears to explain a substantial fraction of the variation in both real activity and real in-
33:1652:86061:17:16:89:522:462:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:terest rates at the two- to four-year forecast horizon, a result consistent with the predictive
33:1653:86156:16:32:89:489:446:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:power for economic activity of corporate bond spread at long-run forecast horizons.

33:1655:86275:24:16:89:522:390:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The baseline FAVAR specification analyzed the information content of corporate bond
33:1656:86358:16:17:89:522:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:spreads that is orthogonal to both the aggregate stock market return and the average
33:1657:86442:17:16:89:521:357:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of excess returns of firms in our EDF-based stock portfolios. As a point of comparison,
33:1658:86529:16:17:89:521:341:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:this section examines whether excess equity returns in our EDF-based stock portfolios also
33:1659:86619:17:16:89:522:324:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:contain information regarding economic activity that is not captured by either standard
33:1660:86706:16:16:89:395:308:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:macroeconomic indicators or the aggregate stock market return.
33:1661:86768:16:17:106:522:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To do so, we consider an alternative FAVAR specification thatrelies only on excess
33:1662:86850:17:16:89:522:275:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:equity returns in our EDF-based stock portfolios to identifya shock to financial markets.
33:1663:86939:16:17:89:522:259:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Specifically, instead of the 20 credit spreads associated with our EDF-based bond portfolios,
33:1664:87032:17:16:89:521:242:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the elements of the vectorX2tin this alternative specification correspond to the (average)
33:1665:87122:16:17:90:521:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:excess equity returns in our five EDF-based stock portfolios.The elements of the vector
33:1666:87209:17:16:90:521:209:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f3:X1t, except for removing the excess equity returns in the five EDF-based portfolios, are left
33:1667:87302:16:16:90:521:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:unchanged.22This alternative FAVAR specification thus identifies shocksto firms’ earnings
33:1668:87391:16:17:90:521:177:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:contained in our EDF-based stock portfolios that are orthogonal to indicators of economic
33:1669:87480:17:16:90:497:160:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:activity and inflation, real interest rates, and aggregate stock market developments.23
33:1670:87567:16:15:98:521:144:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:21In contrast, the orthogonalized shock to the second credit factor has a statistically and economically
33:1671:87671:15:7:90:269:129:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:insignificant effect on real economic activity.
33:1672:87718:7:15:98:521:122:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:22The same identification scheme as in the baseline specification is employed to identify credit shocks; in
33:1673:87825:15:7:90:398:107:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:addition,k1= 4,k2= 2, andp= 6, exactly the same as in the baseline case.
33:1674:87897:7:0:98:522:100:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:23We have also considered a specification that that includes both the stock returns and the corporate bond

34:1697:88713:17:16:90:521:285:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for stock returns of firms across the spectrum of credit quality. Upon its impact, excess
34:1698:88802:16:17:90:521:269:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:stock returns in our EDF-based stock portfolios fall between2 and 4 percentage points,
34:1699:88888:17:16:90:521:252:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with returns of the riskiest firms registering the largest decline. As shown in Figure 8, the
34:1700:88981:16:17:90:522:236:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:macroeconomic implications of this shock—given the width of the 95-percent confidence
34:1701:89066:17:16:90:522:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:intervals—are ambiguous, a result suggesting that the two factors extracted from the resid-
34:1702:89157:16:16:90:522:203:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ual component of excess equity returns have little systematic component and largely reflect

34:1704:89289:22:11:90:521:165:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:spreads in the vectorX2t. These results are very similar to our baseline specification, a result that provides
34:1705:89399:11:11:90:522:154:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:further evidence that corporate bond spreads contain unique information not captured by other financial

35:1839:90971:45:27:90:191:191:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:5  Conclusion
35:1840:90984:27:17:90:521:164:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Our results indicate that credit spreads on senior unsecured corporate debt have a sub-
35:1841:91071:17:16:90:522:147:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:stantial predictive power for future economic activity relative to that of previously used
35:1842:91161:16:17:90:521:131:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:default-risk indicators such as the paper-bill spread or the high-yield credit spread. This im-
35:1843:91256:17:16:90:521:114:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:provement in forecasting performance reflects the information content of spreads on longer-
35:1844:91347:16:0:90:522:98:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:maturity bonds issued by firms at the high-end and middle of thecredit-quality spectrum.
36:1845:91437:0:17:90:521:694:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:According to our FAVAR results, shocks to corporate bond spreads lead to quantitatively
36:1846:91524:17:16:90:521:677:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:large swings in economic activity and real interest rates. Such credit market shocks explain
36:1847:91616:16:16:90:521:661:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a sizable fraction of the variance in economic activity at the two- to four-year horizon.
36:1848:91705:16:17:90:522:645:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:These findings are consistent with the notion that an unexpected worsening of conditions
36:1849:91793:17:16:90:521:628:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in credit markets can cause a long-lasting economic downturnand that shocks to credit
36:1850:91878:16:17:90:522:612:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:markets have played an important role in business cycle fluctuations during the previous
36:1851:91966:17:16:90:177:595:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:decade and a half.
36:1852:91984:16:33:106:522:579:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The fact that credit market shocks generate such large effects may come as a bit of
36:1853:92156:33:16:89:522:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:prospects of firms than does the stock market. In that case, a shock to credit markets may
36:1854:92246:16:17:89:521:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:still reflect news regarding underlying cash flows rather than a disruption in the supply of
36:1855:92338:17:16:89:521:513:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:credit. But we are then left with the puzzle as to why stock prices do not incorporate all
36:1856:92428:16:17:89:522:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the relevant information about the firms’ profit opportunities? Although various theories
36:1857:92517:17:16:89:522:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of stock market behavior that emphasize departures from thestandard efficient markets
36:1858:92602:16:17:89:522:464:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:paradigm may help justify these findings, our results imply developments in corporate credit
36:1859:92694:17:16:89:519:447:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:markets provide important information regarding the future course of economic activity.24
36:1860:92783:16:16:106:521:431:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We offer two alternative explanations for our results. First, the recent empirical and
36:1861:92869:16:17:90:522:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:theoretical asset pricing literature has emphasized the inability of standard structural mod-
36:1862:92962:17:16:90:521:398:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:els of default to explain both the level and movements in credit spreads (see, for example,
36:1863:93053:16:17:90:521:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Collin-Dufresne, Goldstein, and Martin [2001]). Accordingto this literature, a large part
36:1864:93142:17:16:90:522:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the variation in credit spreads is due to macroeconomic factors, particularly to liquidity
36:1865:93235:16:17:90:522:349:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and risk premiums. In the corporate bond market, the key investors are banks, insurance
36:1866:93322:17:16:90:521:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:companies, and other financial intermediaries.  To the extent that financial markets are
36:1867:93410:16:17:90:521:316:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:segmented, the risk attitude of the marginal corporate bondinvestor may reflect the will-
36:1868:93499:17:16:90:522:299:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ingness or ability of these institutions to bear risk. Thus,as conditions in the financial
36:1869:93589:16:16:90:522:283:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sector deteriorate, the premium on the risk of default rises, which causes a drop in invest-
36:1870:93681:16:17:90:522:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ment spending and a contraction in future economic activity, an argument consistent with
36:1871:93769:17:16:90:522:250:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the results of Philippon [2008] who finds that corporate bondspreads do particularly well
36:1872:93858:16:17:90:282:234:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:at forecasting business fixed investment.
36:1873:93899:17:16:106:521:217:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Second, the financial sector creates direct linkages between the banking sector and non-
36:1874:93987:16:17:90:521:201:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:bank financial activity.  For example, the ability of nonfinancial corporations to finance
36:1875:94077:17:16:90:521:184:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:short-term liquidity needs by issuing commercial paper relies importantly on the ability of
36:1876:94168:16:16:90:521:168:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:these firms to obtain back-up lines of credit from banks. As monetary policy tightens, or
36:1877:94257:16:17:90:522:152:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:financial conditions in the banking sector deteriorate, banks may be forced to cut back on
36:1878:94347:17:16:90:522:135:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:their lines of credit. More generally, the process of creditdisintermediation may increase
36:1879:94437:16:15:98:521:119:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:24See Philippon [2008] for an overview of such theories and their potential implications for the information
36:1880:94545:15:0:90:230:104:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:content of stock and bond returns.
37:1881:94581:0:17:90:521:694:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:liquidity risk for nonfinancial firms, which, in the case of a severe deterioration in economic
37:1882:94676:17:16:90:522:677:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and financial conditions, may turn into insolvency risk.  Again, disturbances emanating
37:1883:94763:16:16:90:521:661:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from the financial sector would cause a rise in the cost of credit for nonfinancial firms. In
37:1884:94856:16:17:90:522:645:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:addition, to the extent that monetary policy shocks are not fully summarized by movements
37:1885:94945:17:16:90:521:628:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the Federal funds rate, these credit market disturbancesmay also reflect the anticipated
37:1886:95036:16:17:90:521:612:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tightening of monetary policy, which manifests itself in the disintermediation process sooner
37:1887:95129:17:16:90:521:595:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:than it is reflected in the observable movements in standard indicators of monetary policy.
37:1888:95220:16:33:90:521:579:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This alternative is consistent with the findings of Gertler and Lown [1999] and Mueller
37:1889:95392:33:16:90:385:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:credit market conditions over the course of the business cycle.
37:1890:95455:16:17:106:522:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:As emphasized by Primiceri, Schaumburg, and Tambalotti [2006], there is strong empir-
37:1891:95540:17:16:90:521:513:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ical evidence supporting the notion that “intertemporal disturbances” are a major source
37:1892:95628:16:17:90:521:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of business cycle fluctuations. In dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models that allow
37:1893:95719:17:16:90:521:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for financial accelerator mechanisms, such as those developed by Kiyotaki and Moore [1997]
37:1894:95809:16:17:90:522:464:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist [1999], these disturbances may be linked directly to
37:1895:95898:17:16:90:521:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:changes in credit conditions. The rich amount of information contained in corporate bond
37:1896:95986:16:16:90:521:431:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:spreads may be particularly useful for measuring and identifying the importance of these
37:1897:96074:16:17:90:522:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:financial mechanisms. To understand the inter-related effects of movements in risk premi-
37:1898:96163:17:16:90:521:398:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ums, changes in the health of financial institutions, and economic activity would require
37:1899:96252:16:17:90:521:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:extending these models to include financial market participants and changing risk attitudes
