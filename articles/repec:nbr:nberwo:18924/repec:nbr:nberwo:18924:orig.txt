2:25:1131:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:Government policies that are not intended to address environmental concerns can nonetheless distort
2:26:1230:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:prices and affect firms' emissions.  We present an analytical general equilibrium model to study the
2:27:1330:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:effect of distortionary subsidies on factor prices and on environmental outcomes.  We model an output
2:28:1431:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:subsidy, a capital subsidy, relief from environmental regulation, and a direct cash subsidy.  In exchange
2:29:1536:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:for receiving subsidies, firms must agree to a minimum level of labor employment.  Each type of subsidy
2:30:1639:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:and the employment constraint create both output effects and substitution effects on input prices and
2:31:1740:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:emissions.  We calibrate the model to the Chinese economy, where government involvement affects
2:32:1835:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:emissions from both state-owned enterprises and private firms.  Variation in production substitution
2:33:1935:14:42:72:523:476:12:Times:12:Times:elasticities does not substantially affect input prices, but it does substantially affect emissions.

3:47:2293:0:20:72:150:708:144:Times:144:Times:I. Introduction 
3:48:2308:20:21:108:542:688:144:Times:144:Times:Nearly  all  governments  support  particular  firms  or  sectors  by  granting  low-interest 
3:49:2402:21:20:72:544:667:144:Times:144:Times:financing, reduced regulation, tax relief, price supports, monopoly rights, and a variety of other 
3:50:2501:20:21:72:544:647:144:Times:144:Times:subsidies.    Subsidies are  not  lump  sum,  but  instead  introduce  distortions  by  favoring  particular  
3:51:2611:21:21:72:543:626:144:Times:144:Times:firms, sectors, and/or inputs.  This paper determines the incidence and environmental effects of 
3:52:2708:21:21:71:539:605:144:Times:144:Times:distortions  induced  by  these subsidies,  which  are  particularly common  in  environmentally-
3:53:2805:21:20:72:509:584:144:Times:144:Times:sensitive industries.  The model is calibrated and simulated to study the Chinese economy. 
3:54:2895:20:21:108:545:564:144:Times:144:Times:Many  studies  in  environmental  economics  examine  the  effect  of  some  environmental  
3:55:2987:21:21:72:546:543:144:Times:144:Times:regulation  on  the  environment,  e.g.  how  efficient  a  cap-and-trade  scheme  is  at  reducing  
3:56:3088:21:20:71:548:522:144:Times:144:Times:emissions   relative   to   a   command-and-control   standard.      Others   examine   the   effects   of   
3:57:3197:20:21:71:545:502:144:Times:144:Times:environmental  regulations  on  non-environmental  outcomes,  e.g.  if  strict  emissions  regulations  
3:58:3301:21:21:71:548:481:144:Times:144:Times:reduce   employment   or   capital   investment.   These   are   often   referred   to   as   unintended   
3:59:3408:21:20:71:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:consequences of environmental regulations.  Conversely, this model examines a different type of 
3:60:3504:20:21:71:544:440:144:Times:144:Times:unintended  consequences:  the  effects  of  non-environmental  policies  on  the  environment.    The  
3:61:3608:21:21:71:545:419:144:Times:144:Times:subsidies  that  we  model  are  not  necessarily  intended  to  address  environmental  issues,  but  
3:62:3711:21:21:71:504:398:144:Times:144:Times:because they affect prices and firms’ decisions in general equilibrium, such effects occur. 
3:63:3803:21:20:107:543:377:144:Times:144:Times:We  present  a  two-sector  general  equilibrium  model  of  an  economy  in  which  one  sector  
3:64:3901:20:21:71:543:357:144:Times:144:Times:receives  subsidies  and  the  other  does  not.    Our  motivating  example  is  the  Chinese  economy,  in  
3:65:4011:21:21:71:543:336:144:Times:144:Times:which a large fraction of the economy is composed of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), receiving 
3:66:4106:21:20:71:546:315:144:Times:144:Times:subsidies from  the  government  and  coexisting  alongside  private  firms.    We  consider  four  
3:67:4206:20:21:71:543:295:144:Times:144:Times:different  ways  in  which  regulators  interfere  with  the  subsidized  sector.    First,  SOEs  may  have  
3:68:4316:21:21:71:540:274:144:Times:144:Times:easier  or  cheaper  access  to  capital  or  to  loans,  modeled here as  an  interest  subsidy.    Fisher-
3:69:4424:21:20:71:547:253:144:Times:144:Times:Vanden   and   Ho   (2007) documents   and   studies   substantial   interest subsidies   to   Chinese   
3:70:4529:20:21:71:548:233:144:Times:144:Times:industries, including energy-intensive industries.  Second, SOEs may receive an output subsidy.   
3:71:4626:21:21:71:546:212:144:Times:144:Times:Hsieh  and  Klenow  (2009) model  the  Chinese  economy  where  subsidies  to  output  play  a  
3:72:4722:21:21:71:545:191:144:Times:144:Times:prominent  role.    Third,  SOEs  may  face  less  stringent  environmental  standards,  modeled  as  a  
3:73:4827:21:20:71:545:170:144:Times:144:Times:subsidy  to  an  emissions  tax.    Dasgupta  et.  al.  (2001) show  that  Chinese  SOEs  have  more  
3:74:4929:20:21:71:544:150:144:Times:144:Times:bargaining  power  and  are  therefore  their  pollution  is  monitored  less  intensively.    Fourth  and  
3:75:5037:21:21:71:544:129:144:Times:144:Times:lastly,  SOEs  incur  extra  costs  along  with  the  subsidies.    In  particular,  SOEs  are  subject  to  a  
3:76:5149:21:20:71:542:108:144:Times:144:Times:regulation  on  the  amount  of  labor  that  must  be  employed  by  them.    Yin  (2001)  models 
3:77:5248:20:0:71:454:88:144:Times:144:Times:overstaffing among Chinese SOEs and argues that overstaffing is widespread.   
4:78:5328:0:21:108:544:709:144:Times:144:Times:While  our  motivating  example  is  the  Chinese  economy,  our  analytical  model  is  general  
4:79:5426:21:21:72:544:688:144:Times:144:Times:enough  to  apply  to  several  other  examples.    Other  nations  besides  China  exhibit  these  types  of  
4:80:5537:21:20:72:544:667:144:Times:144:Times:economy-wide  subsidies.    Bergoeing  et.  al.  (2002) study  output  and  interest subsidies  in  Chile  
4:81:5644:20:21:71:543:647:144:Times:144:Times:and Mexico.  Barde and Honkatukia (2004) list subsidies among various OECD countries.  The 
4:82:5735:21:21:71:543:626:144:Times:144:Times:model  also  applies to  policies  within  a  country  targeted  at  a  single  industry.    For  instance,  the  
4:83:5849:21:21:71:544:605:144:Times:144:Times:U.S.  auto  bailout  in  2008-2009 fits  this  model,  since  the  subsidies  implicit  in  the  bailout  were  
4:84:5961:21:20:71:546:584:144:Times:144:Times:aimed  at  only  at  some  domestic,  not  foreign,  manufacturers  operating  in  the  US.    In  this  
4:85:6066:20:21:71:546:564:144:Times:144:Times:application,  the  labor  constraint  could  be  due  to  union  contracts  rather  than  government  
4:86:6168:21:21:71:545:543:144:Times:144:Times:regulation.  Similarly,  the  airline  industry  could  be  modeled  where  the  distinction  between  
4:87:6271:21:20:71:542:522:144:Times:144:Times:subsidized  and  non-subsidized  firms  follows  the  distinction  between  legacy  and  low-cost 
4:88:6369:20:21:71:543:502:144:Times:144:Times:carriers.    Lastly,  the  model  could  be  applied  to  subsidization  of  a  particular  industry  within  an  
4:89:6483:21:21:71:405:481:144:Times:144:Times:economy; for instance agricultural subsidies within OECD countries. 
4:90:6551:21:20:107:544:460:144:Times:144:Times:Our  subsidies  differ  from  typical  analysis  of  the  incidence  of  subsidies  or  taxes  in  the  
4:91:6655:20:21:71:540:440:144:Times:144:Times:literature  in  that  only  some  firms  receive  subsidies.    In our equilibrium, subsidized  and  non-
4:92:6760:21:21:71:543:419:144:Times:144:Times:subsidized  (hereafter  private)  firms  coexist  only  if  subsidized  firms  are  less  productive.  This 
4:93:6868:21:21:72:543:398:144:Times:144:Times:matches the empirical observation that subsidies tend to go to firms to prevent bankruptcy or to 
4:94:6965:21:20:72:386:377:144:Times:144:Times:support distressed firms facing foreign or domestic competition.  
4:95:7031:20:21:108:543:357:144:Times:144:Times:We find that subsidies tied to the use of a particular input (e.g. low interest loans, relief 
4:96:7125:21:21:71:543:336:144:Times:144:Times:from  environmental  regulation)  have  three effects.    First,  subsidized  firms  tend  to  increase 
4:97:7229:21:20:71:544:315:144:Times:144:Times:demand  for  the subsidized input  (capital,  emissions)  at  the  expense  of  substitute  inputs.  This  
4:98:7336:20:21:71:546:295:144:Times:144:Times:substitution  effect  increases  economy-wide demand  for  the  subsidized  input. Second,  the  
4:99:7433:21:21:72:544:274:144:Times:144:Times:subsidized  firm  tends  to  produce  more,  increasing  demand  by  the  subsidized  firm  for  all  inputs  
4:100:7543:21:20:72:542:253:144:Times:144:Times:(an  output  effect).    Third,  in  general  equilibrium,  as  input  prices  change, the  private  and 
4:101:7648:20:21:72:542:233:144:Times:144:Times:subsidized firms alter  their usage  of  inputs. Overall,  the  price  of  the  subsidized  input  and 
4:102:7751:21:21:71:544:212:144:Times:144:Times:complementary  inputs  increase at  the  expense  of  substitute  inputs,  and  the  subsidized  sector  
4:103:7856:21:21:71:545:191:144:Times:144:Times:grows  in  size.  Output  subsidies  can  be  viewed  as  a  subsidy  to  all  inputs,  and  therefore  the  
4:104:7965:21:20:71:449:170:144:Times:144:Times:substitution effect described above is not present, though the output effect is.   
4:105:8048:20:21:107:544:150:144:Times:144:Times:In  our  model,  firms  must  use  a  minimum quantity  of  labor  in  exchange  for  receiving  
4:106:8145:21:21:71:543:129:144:Times:144:Times:subsidies.  If the minimum labor constraint binds, the marginal product of labor in the subsidized 
4:107:8244:21:20:71:544:108:144:Times:144:Times:sector  falls  below  the  wage  and  subsidized  firms  earn  negative  profits.    The  government  then  
4:108:8352:20:0:71:543:88:144:Times:144:Times:provides a cash subsidy (hereafter a direct subsidy) to prevent subsidized firms from exiting the 
5:109:8452:0:21:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:market. Increasing the minimum labor constraint moves labor from the private to the subsidized 
5:110:8547:21:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:sector.  The demand for capital therefore increases in the subsidized sector but decreases in the 
5:111:8645:21:20:72:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:private  sector.    The  interest  rate  rises  if  the  subsidized  sector  is  more  capital  intensive  than  the  
5:112:8763:20:21:71:142:647:144:Times:144:Times:private sector. 
5:113:8778:21:21:107:543:626:144:Times:144:Times:To gauge the magnitude of the effects, we calibrate our model to the Chinese economy, 
5:114:8864:21:21:71:543:605:144:Times:144:Times:where the distinction between subsidized and private firms is clear in our data.  We simulate for 
5:115:8962:21:20:72:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:base-case parameter values and conduct sensitivity analysis over the parameters describing each 
5:116:9058:20:21:72:543:564:144:Times:144:Times:sector's substitution elasticities in production.  The key determinant of the incidence (the changes 
5:117:9159:21:21:71:544:543:144:Times:144:Times:in  factor  prices)  of  the  policies  is  the  factor  intensities;  in  our  simulation  where  the  subsidized  
5:118:9275:21:20:71:546:522:144:Times:144:Times:sector  is  relatively  capital-intensive,  subsidies  hurt  labor  more  than  they  hurt  capital.    This  
5:119:9385:20:21:71:543:502:144:Times:144:Times:pattern  is  unaffected  by  the  substitution  elasticity  values.    In  contrast,  the  effects  on  emissions  
5:120:9500:21:21:71:544:481:144:Times:144:Times:depend  crucially  on  the  substitution  elasticity  values.    The  greater  the  ability  of  one  sector  to  
5:121:9614:21:20:71:545:460:144:Times:144:Times:substitute into  emissions  away  from  an  alternate  input  whose  price  increases,  the  larger  that  
5:122:9721:20:21:71:211:440:144:Times:144:Times:sector's emissions increase.   
5:123:9752:21:21:107:542:419:144:Times:144:Times:In many developing countries, subsidies of the type we study are a significant fraction of 
5:124:9843:21:21:71:544:398:144:Times:144:Times:GDP.    For  example,  Brandt  and  Zhu  (2000) report  that  subsidies  in  China  amount  to  6.8%  of  
5:125:9949:21:20:71:543:377:144:Times:144:Times:GDP  in  1993.    Further,  van  Beers  and  van  den  Bergh  (2001) estimate  worldwide  subsidies  are  
5:126:10055:20:21:71:543:357:144:Times:144:Times:3.6% of world GDP in the mid-1990s.  Barde and Honkatukia (2004), report agriculture, fishing, 
5:127:10150:21:21:71:547:336:144:Times:144:Times:energy   (especially   coal),   manufacturing,   transport,   and   water   are   all   heavily   subsidized,

5:129:10300:20:21:107:546:295:144:Times:144:Times:  Despite  the  prevalence  of  subsidies, little  is  known  about their  general  equilibrium  
5:130:10397:21:21:71:545:274:144:Times:144:Times:effect  on  factor  prices  and  the  environment.    Barde  and  Honkatukia  (2004) discuss  a  few  
5:131:10499:21:20:71:545:253:144:Times:144:Times:channels  by  which  subsidies  may  affect  the  quality  of  the  environment.    Input  and  output  
5:132:10603:20:21:71:545:233:144:Times:144:Times:subsidies,  especially  in  environmentally  sensitive  industries,  encourage  the  overuse  of  dirty  
5:133:10708:21:21:71:542:212:144:Times:144:Times:inputs.  Bailouts, tax relief, and other cash subsidies prevent the exit from the market of the least 
5:134:10809:21:21:71:546:191:144:Times:144:Times:efficient  producers,  which  are  likely  to  be  the  most  emissions  intensive,  which  they  call  a  
5:135:10916:21:20:71:544:170:144:Times:144:Times:“technology  lock-in”   effect.  Subsidies  in  the  form  of  regulatory  relief  include  exemptions  from  
5:136:11026:20:21:71:544:150:144:Times:144:Times:environmental  regulation,  which  directly  increase  the  incentive  to  emit.    Still,  their  analysis  is  
5:137:11139:21:21:71:543:129:144:Times:144:Times:largely informal.  Indeed, they note that "a thorough assessment would require a complex set of 
5:138:11235:21:22:71:543:108:144:Times:144:Times:general  equilibrium  analysis  (to  evaluate  the  rebound  effect  on  the  economy).''1  This  paper

6:141:11429:0:21:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:provides such a general equilibrium analysis, including all of the above channels.  Fullerton and 
6:142:11527:21:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:Heutel (2010), (2007) use similar analytical methods to study the incidence of taxes (2007 paper) 
6:143:11625:21:20:72:526:667:144:Times:144:Times:and environmental mandates (2010 paper) but not non-environmental policies like subsidies.   
6:144:11718:20:21:108:549:647:144:Times:144:Times:Subsidies  can  also  be  used  to  protect  favored  industries  against  foreign  competition.    
6:145:11818:21:21:72:543:626:144:Times:144:Times:Indeed, many trade agreements explicitly call for a reduction in subsidies.  For example, Bajona 
6:146:11915:21:21:71:543:605:144:Times:144:Times:and Kelly (2012) examine the effect on the environment of eliminating the subsidies required for 
6:147:12012:21:20:71:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:China to enter the WTO and find that elimination of subsidies reduces steady state emissions of 
6:148:12108:20:21:71:544:564:144:Times:144:Times:three  of  four  pollutants  studied. van  Beers  and  van  den  Bergh  (2001) show  in  a  static,  partial  
6:149:12218:21:21:71:546:543:144:Times:144:Times:equilibrium  setting  how  subsidies  increase  output  and  therefore  emissions  in  a  small  open  
6:150:12321:21:20:71:543:522:144:Times:144:Times:economy.  For example, if subsidies are sufficiently large, a country may move from importing 
6:151:12415:20:21:71:545:502:144:Times:144:Times:to  exporting  an  environmentally  sensitive  good.    The  increase  in  output  in  turn  increases  
6:152:12519:21:21:71:125:481:144:Times:144:Times:emissions. 
6:153:12529:21:20:107:542:460:144:Times:144:Times:A number of authors study the effect of agricultural subsidies on the environment  (Antle, 
6:154:12620:20:21:72:545:440:144:Times:144:Times:Lekakis  and  Zanias  1998),  (Pasour  and  Rucker  2005).    Price  supports  and  output  and  input  
6:155:12724:21:21:72:545:419:144:Times:144:Times:subsidies  encourage  the  use  of  dirty  inputs  such  as  fertilizer  and  pesticides,  and  encourage  
6:156:12831:21:21:72:543:398:144:Times:144:Times:marginal  land  to  be  converted  from  conservation  to  farming.    On  the  other  hand,  the  USDA  in 
6:157:12939:21:20:72:545:377:144:Times:144:Times:2003 had  over  17  agricultural  subsidy  programs  ($1.9  billion)  designed  in  part  to  improve  
6:158:13042:20:21:72:543:357:144:Times:144:Times:environmental  quality, primarily  by  paying  farmers  to  remove  environmentally  sensitive  land 
6:159:13143:21:21:72:545:336:144:Times:144:Times:from  production (Pasour  and  Rucker  2005).    However,  such  restrictions  have  an  ambiguous  
6:160:13243:21:20:72:543:315:144:Times:144:Times:effect on erosion and on fertilizer and pesticide use, since such restrictions encourage farmers to 
6:161:13343:20:21:72:543:295:144:Times:144:Times:farm the remaining land more intensively (Pasour and Rucker 2005, 110).  Other subsidies, such 
6:162:13438:21:21:72:543:274:144:Times:144:Times:as output subsidies, magnify this effect.  It is therefore important to analyze all subsidies together 
6:163:13540:21:20:72:424:253:144:Times:144:Times:in general equilibrium, as they can have offsetting or magnifying effects. 
6:164:13614:20:21:108:544:233:144:Times:144:Times:Previous work has provided an important first step in identifying the extent of subsidies 
6:165:13704:21:21:72:543:212:144:Times:144:Times:and likely channels by which they effect the environment.  Still, the previous literature does not 
6:166:13803:21:21:72:543:191:144:Times:144:Times:examine the incidence of subsidies, and most prior work looks at individual subsidies in partial 
6:167:13900:21:20:72:543:170:144:Times:144:Times:equilibrium. An exception is Bajona and Kelly (2012), who provide a model where private and 
6:168:13992:20:21:72:543:150:144:Times:144:Times:subsidized firms coexist.  They prove the existence of a general equilibrium in which subsidized 
6:169:14089:21:21:72:543:129:144:Times:144:Times:firms  and  private  firms  co-exist  with  the  share  of  production  of  subsidized  firms  determined 
6:170:14194:21:20:72:544:108:144:Times:144:Times:endogenously by the subsidies, labor requirement, and technology difference. Bajona and Kelly 
6:171:14288:20:0:72:543:88:144:Times:144:Times:(2012) consider only two kinds of subsidies, direct subsidies and interest subsidies.  We extend 
7:172:14387:0:21:72:542:709:144:Times:144:Times:their  framework  by  considering  as  well  output  subsidies  and  regulatory  relief  and by making 
7:173:14490:21:21:72:196:688:144:Times:144:Times:emissions endogenous.2

7:176:14524:20:21:108:543:626:144:Times:144:Times:Consider a closed economy consisting of two representative firms producing an identical 
7:177:14612:21:21:72:545:605:144:Times:144:Times:output  good.    Each  firm  has  access  to  a  production  technology  utilizing  three  inputs:  capital,  
7:178:14722:21:20:72:542:584:144:Times:144:Times:labor, and pollution.  Production here is net of abatement costs, so higher pollution input means 
7:179:14820:20:21:72:545:564:144:Times:144:Times:lower  abatement  costs,  and  therefore  higher  net  production.3    One  firm  is  subsidized  by  the  
7:180:14927:21:21:72:545:543:144:Times:144:Times:government,  as  described  later;  call  its  output  level G.    The  other  firm  is  non-subsidized  or  
7:181:15036:21:21:72:440:522:144:Times:144:Times:private; call its output level  P.  The subsidized firm's production function is 
7:182:15117:21:21:270:380:501:144:g_d0_f4:144:Times:퐺=퐴퐺퐹(퐾퐺,퐿퐺,퐸퐺), 
7:183:15134:21:20:72:535:480:144:Times:144:Times:where  KG, LG,  and  EG  are the quantities of capital, labor, and pollution used by the subsidized 
7:184:15234:20:21:71:530:460:144:Times:144:Times:firm, and  AG  is total factor productivity. We assume F  is a constant returns to scale function.  
7:185:15334:21:21:72:122:439:144:Times:144:Times:Similarly, 
7:186:15344:21:21:270:380:418:144:g_d0_f4:144:Times:푃=퐴푃퐹(퐾푃,퐿푃,퐸푃), 
7:187:15361:21:21:72:486:397:144:Times:144:Times:with  AP, KP, LP,  and  EP  defined analogously.  Henceforth, we normalize AP  to one. 
7:188:15447:21:21:108:482:376:144:Times:144:Times:Households supply 퐾� units of capital and 퐿� units of labor inelastically.  Thus,

7:197:15908:22:20:108:545:180:144:Times:144:Times:The private firm faces three prices, r, w, and τ,  for inputs  KP, LP, and EP,  respectively.  
7:198:16001:20:21:71:543:160:144:Times:144:Times:The price of pollution τ is a government policy variable, while the prices of capital and labor are 
7:199:16101:21:30:72:545:139:144:Times:144:Times:endogenous. We  follow  Mieszkowski  (1972) in  modeling  the  private  firm's  choices  over  its

7:202:16360:12:16:72:535:90:42:Times:99:Times:3 See, for example, Bartz and Kelly (2008) for a derivation of a production function with pollution as an input from

8:220:17682:21:21:108:542:366:144:Times:144:Times:The subsidized firm faces a different problem than the private firm, in four aspects.  First, 
8:221:17776:21:21:72:543:345:144:Times:144:Times:subsidized  firms  receive  a  discount  on  their  capital  costs.    The  discount  may  arise  from  the 
8:222:17884:21:21:72:543:324:144:Times:144:Times:government  guaranteeing  repayment  of  funds  borrowed  by  subsidized  firms, direct  loans  from 
8:223:17985:21:20:72:546:303:144:Times:144:Times:the  government  at  reduce  interest  rates,  state  owned  enterprises  (SOEs) borrowing  at  the  
8:224:18086:20:21:72:544:283:144:Times:144:Times:government's  rate  of  interest,  or  as  the  government  steering  deposits  at  state-owned  banks  to  
8:225:18194:21:21:72:545:262:144:Times:144:Times:subsidized  firms  (common  in  developing  countries)  at  reduced  interest  rates.    Any of  these  
8:226:18298:21:22:71:544:241:144:Times:144:Times:implicit  or  explicit  subsidies  imply  a  lower  effective  rental price  of  capital  for  the  subsidized  
8:227:18410:22:21:71:349:219:144:Times:144:Times:firm, 푟퐺  =   (1 –  훾)푟, where γ is the interest subsidy rate. 
8:228:18473:21:21:108:544:198:144:Times:144:Times:Second, subsidized  firms  receive  a  subsidy  of  휀  per  unit  of  output. The  output  subsidy  
8:229:18573:21:21:72:543:177:144:Times:144:Times:may also be interpreted as a price support that applies only to the subsidized firm (for example, 
8:230:18671:21:36:72:545:156:144:Times:144:Times:the  government  buys  excess  demand  above  the market  price  from  the  subsidized  firm  and

8:232:18819:7:16:72:517:113:42:Times:99:Times:4 The analytical general equilibrium modeling and solution strategy that we employ is in the style of Harberger 
8:233:18930:16:11:72:530:97:99:Times:99:Times:(1962).  Other papers using similar methods include Mieszkowski (1972), Fullerton and Metcalf (2002), Fullerton 
8:234:19042:11:12:72:532:86:99:Times:99:Times:and Heutel (2007), and Fullerton and Heutel (2010).  See, for example, Fullerton and Heutel (2007, p. 588-9) for a

9:236:19192:0:21:72:542:708:144:Times:144:Times:distributes the goods to households). If the consumer price of subsidized firm output is 푞퐺, then 
9:237:19289:21:21:72:448:687:144:Times:144:Times:the effective output price that the subsidized firm faces is  푞퐺푁=(1 +휀)푞퐺.   
9:238:19367:21:20:108:543:666:144:Times:144:Times:Third, the  government  reduces  the  environmental  regulatory  burden  the  subsidized  firm  
9:239:19463:20:21:72:543:646:144:Times:144:Times:faces.  In particular, the subsidized firm pays a pollution tax rate of 휏퐺=휏(1−휙).  Here 1−휙 
9:240:19555:21:21:72:544:625:144:Times:144:Times:may  also  represent  the  fraction  of  emissions  reported  by  the  subsidized  firm  if  for  example  the  
9:241:19667:21:21:72:545:604:144:Times:144:Times:government  monitors  subsidized  firms  less  often (Gupta  and  Saksena  (2002) find  subsidized  
9:242:19767:21:21:72:543:583:144:Times:144:Times:SOEs are monitored less often, and Wang et. al. (2003) find SOEs enjoy bargaining power over 
9:243:19860:21:20:72:544:562:144:Times:144:Times:environmental  compliance).    As  with  Fisher-Vanden  and  Ho  (2007),  we  are  able  to  investigate  
9:244:19966:20:21:72:472:542:144:Times:144:Times:how environmental regulations interact with other subsidies, like a capital subsidy. 
9:245:20050:21:21:108:544:521:144:Times:144:Times:Fourth, if subsidized and non-subsidized firms co-exist, some cost to receiving subsidies 
9:246:20140:21:20:72:546:500:144:Times:144:Times:must  exist.  Following  Bajona  and  Kelly  (2012),  we  model  this  cost  in  a  simple  way.    In  
9:247:20244:20:21:72:542:480:144:Times:144:Times:particular, we   assume   that   in   order   to   receive   subsidies,   the   government   requires   labor 
9:248:20354:21:21:72:543:459:144:Times:144:Times:employment at subsidized firms to be greater than or equal to 퐿�퐺.  The minimum labor constraint 
9:249:20451:21:22:72:542:438:144:Times:144:Times:means the cost of receiving subsidies is a labor cost, which may include hiring lobbyists and/or 
9:250:20548:22:20:71:544:416:144:Times:144:Times:hiring  labor  in  key  districts  to  increase  bargaining  power.5  I n  exchange  for  employing 퐿�퐺,  the  
9:251:20659:20:21:72:547:396:144:Times:144:Times:government covers any losses through a direct subsidy (cash payment), S.  T he labor constraint 
9:252:20755:21:21:71:544:375:144:Times:144:Times:binds if  and  only  if  the  marginal  product  of  labor  in  subsidized  firms  is  below  the  wage  rate,  
9:253:20867:21:21:71:543:354:144:Times:144:Times:which causes subsidized firms to earn negative profits. Subsidized and private firms then co-exist 
9:254:20966:21:20:71:544:333:144:Times:144:Times:if  subsidized  firms  receive  a  direct  subsidy  large  enough  for  the  subsidized  firm's  profits  to  be  
9:255:21080:20:21:71:542:313:144:Times:144:Times:non-negative, including the direct subsidy. If the constraint does not bind, subsidized firms have 
9:256:21179:21:21:71:542:292:144:Times:144:Times:a competitive advantage and will drive the private firms from the market.  Since this case is less 
9:257:21278:21:20:71:392:271:144:Times:144:Times:interesting, we consider only the case where the constraint binds.   
9:258:21347:20:21:107:539:251:144:Times:144:Times:The  subsidized  firm's  cost-minimization  problem  is analogous  to  the  private  firm's  cost-
9:259:21445:21:21:71:546:230:144:Times:144:Times:minimization  problem,  except  the  subsidized  firm  faces  different  input  costs  (for  example,  
9:260:21548:21:21:71:543:209:144:Times:144:Times:replacing  r  with  rG,  the subsidized capital price) and the binding constraint on labor input, 퐿�퐺. 
9:261:21651:21:21:72:545:188:144:Times:144:Times:Because  of  this  constraint,  the  subsidized  firm  no  longer  is  able  to  set  its  marginal  revenue  
9:262:21761:21:20:72:543:167:144:Times:144:Times:product of labor equal to the wage.  Rather, the constraint creates a shadow price of labor for the 
9:263:21861:20:49:72:543:147:144:Times:144:Times:subsidized firm, denoted  wG.  This shadow price equals the difference between the market wage 
9:264:21956:49:8:72:219:98:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
9:265:22005:8:16:72:542:90:42:Times:99:Times:5 Shleifer and Vishny (1994) present a political economy model explaining why such labor constraints may arise in a 
9:266:22121:16:0:71:373:74:99:Times:99:Times:bargaining process as a result of the other types of subsidies modeled here. 
10:267:22199:0:21:72:544:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:Times:w and the multiplier on the labor constraint. Since we always assume that the labor constraint is 
10:268:22297:21:21:71:429:688:144:Times:144:Times:binding, the market price w is strictly greater than the shadow price wG.     
10:269:22375:21:20:108:532:667:144:Times:144:Times:The solution to the firm's cost-minimization problem can thus be written in terms of the 
10:270:22464:20:21:72:528:647:144:Times:144:Times:shadow price of the constraint and the other subsidized prices in a manner similar to equations

10:278:23146:21:21:72:543:474:144:Times:144:Times:constraint  implies 퐿퐺=퐿�퐺,    the  constraint  creates  the  shadow  price wG     so  that  labor demand 
10:279:23250:21:21:72:545:453:144:Times:144:Times:under that shadow price, according to equations (7) and (8), is just equal to the minimum labor.  
10:280:23348:21:21:72:543:432:144:Times:144:Times:That is, the subsidized firm faces a shadow price of labor lower than the wage, which encourages 
10:281:23445:21:20:72:422:411:144:Times:144:Times:the subsidized firm to use more labor than it otherwise would have used. 
10:282:23518:20:21:94:252:391:144:Times:144:Times:The subsidized firm's profits are

10:284:23577:21:21:72:544:349:144:Times:144:Times:We  first  model  the  case  where equilibrium profits,  net  of  subsidies,  must  equal  zero.    Such  an  
10:285:23687:21:21:72:543:328:144:Times:144:Times:equilibrium condition might arise under free entry, for example.7 In this case, one of the subsidy 
10:286:23786:21:20:72:542:307:144:Times:144:Times:values is determined in equilibrium; we assume that the zero-profit condition determines S once 
10:287:23881:20:21:72:542:287:144:Times:144:Times:the regulator chooses all of the other subsidies. Substituting the firm's first-order conditions from 
10:288:23983:21:21:72:406:266:144:Times:144:Times:the cost-minimization problem into the zero-profit condition implies:

10:291:24187:20:21:72:545:204:144:Times:144:Times:and  pollution.    Then,  since  production  is  constant  returns  to  scale,  using  Euler's  theorem  for  
10:292:24297:21:21:72:221:183:144:Times:144:Times:homogeneous functions yields

10:295:24393:8:16:72:532:136:42:Times:99:Times:6 An alternate method of modeling the binding labor constraint does not use the shadow price of labor, and instead 
10:296:24508:16:12:72:535:120:99:Times:99:Times:derives equations similar to (7) and (8) but that are in terms of the value of the labor constraint itself rather than the 
10:297:24631:12:11:72:537:108:99:Times:99:Times:shadow price.  This is similar to the method in Fullerton and Heutel (2010).  This solution method is available upon 
10:298:24748:11:7:72:173:97:99:Times:99:Times:request from the authors. 
10:299:24773:7:16:72:535:90:42:Times:99:Times:7 Alternatively, if one interprets S as a “bailout,” the government may be motivated only prevent bankruptcy, not to 
10:300:24890:16:0:72:251:74:99:Times:99:Times:give positive profits to the subsidized firm.   
11:301:24940:0:21:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:Thus equilibrium subsidies are 푆=(푤−푤퐺)퐿퐺> 0,  since the minimum labor constraint binds. 
11:302:25028:21:20:71:543:687:144:Times:144:Times:Substituting equilibrium direct subsidies into the zero profit condition and totally differentiating 
11:303:25129:20:22:71:103:667:144:Times:144:Times:yields

11:305:25187:22:21:72:542:623:144:Times:144:Times:Similarly,  totally  differentiating  the  production  function  and  substituting  in  the  first-order 
11:306:25292:21:22:72:343:602:144:Times:144:Times:conditions from the profit-maximization problem yields

11:308:25377:21:20:72:543:559:144:Times:144:Times:The direct subsidy S drops out of equations (7)-(10).  One could solve for the change in the direct

11:310:25572:21:21:72:546:518:144:Times:144:Times:system  (that  would  add  one  equation  and  one  variable  that  does  not  show  up  in  any  other  
11:311:25677:21:21:72:544:497:144:Times:144:Times:equation).    Intuitively,  the  lump-sum  subsidy  does  not  affect  the  firm's  decisions  and  therefore  
11:312:25788:21:20:72:325:476:144:Times:144:Times:has no effect on any general equilibrium outcomes.8 
11:313:25839:20:21:94:546:456:144:Times:144:Times:It  follows  that  the  equations  describing  the  subsidized  firm's  decisions  (equations  (7)  
11:314:25939:21:21:72:543:435:144:Times:144:Times:through  (10))  are  independent  of  the  assumption  that  the  firm  earns  zero  profits.    Indeed,  we 
11:315:26048:21:21:72:543:414:144:Times:144:Times:could assume  instead  that  the  firm's  profits  휋퐺  are  allowed  to  be  positive,  and  that  the  level  of  
11:316:26163:21:21:72:543:393:144:Times:144:Times:firm profits is an exogenous policy parameter that can be controlled by the government.  That is, 
11:317:26261:21:21:72:544:372:144:Times:144:Times:the  profits    휋퐺    represent  rents  that  the  regulator  allows  the  firm  to  capture,  perhaps  through  
11:318:26374:21:21:72:161:351:144:Times:144:Times:barriers to entry.   
11:319:26395:21:21:94:543:330:144:Times:144:Times:To see this, assume that 휋퐺> 0.  Then the equation relating firm profits to the shadow price 
11:320:26488:21:21:72:413:309:144:Times:144:Times:of the constraint still holds, but firm profits no longer must equal zero:

12:348:27495:21:21:72:546:631:144:Times:144:Times:as  the  direct  subsidy  is  large  enough  so  that  subsidized  profits  are  non-negative.    We  are  
12:349:27602:21:20:72:545:610:144:Times:144:Times:interested  in  the  case  where  both  firms  choose  to  operate,  where neither firm is  at  a  corner  
12:350:27709:20:21:71:543:590:144:Times:144:Times:solution for any of its input demands, and our differential analysis is applicable.  The condition

12:354:28025:21:23:94:312:506:144:Times:144:Times:Finally, the minimum labor constraint binds:

12:356:28085:21:21:72:544:462:144:Times:144:Times:Thus  equations  (7)-(11)  characterize  the  subsidized  firm's  decisions.    An  alternative  method  to  
12:357:28194:21:21:72:544:441:144:Times:144:Times:incorporating  the  binding  labor  constraint  would  be  to  set  the  input  demand  equation  for  labor

12:360:28418:21:21:72:542:375:144:Times:144:Times:Equation (11') demonstrates that the input demand equation, in terms of the Allen elasticities and 
12:361:28517:21:21:71:545:354:144:Times:144:Times:the  input  prices,  characterizes  the  subsidized  firm's  demand  for  labor,  which  must  equal  the  
12:362:28624:21:20:71:542:333:144:Times:144:Times:required minimum labor. It can be shown that equation (11') can be derived from equations (7), 
12:363:28719:20:21:72:543:313:144:Times:144:Times:(8) and (11) given known restrictions on the Allen elasticities. Thus, replacing equation (11) with 
12:364:28819:21:21:72:228:292:144:Times:144:Times:(11') yields identical solutions.   
12:365:28855:21:20:94:543:271:144:Times:144:Times:The two firms produce identical goods, so perfect competition implies that consumer prices

12:370:29095:21:20:94:549:167:144:Times:144:Times:Finally,  government  policy  determines  the  relative prices  faced  by  the  subsidized  firm.

12:373:29302:7:7:72:418:114:42:Times:99:g_d0_f4:9 In the case of Cobb-Douglas production functions, we can write the condition 푤−푤

14:424:31811:21:21:107:542:594:144:Times:144:Times:Given that 퐷 is positive, the coefficient on  훾�  in the expression for  푟̂  must be positive. 
14:425:31905:21:21:71:543:573:144:Times:144:Times:An increase in 훾, the subsidy to capital, increases the demand for capital by the subsidized firm,

14:427:32042:22:21:108:543:530:144:Times:144:Times:The sign of the coefficient on  휙�  is opposite of the sign of BG. We show in the appendix 
14:428:32133:21:22:72:543:509:144:Times:144:Times:that BG < 0  if  and  only  if  an  increase  in  emissions  reduces the  marginal  product  of  capital

14:430:32351:21:21:72:544:466:144:Times:144:Times:positive.  An  increase  in  the  emissions  tax subsidy 휙  decreases  the price  of  emissions  for  the  
14:431:32458:21:21:72:551:445:144:Times:144:Times:subsidized  firm.      This  creates  an  output  effect  that  expands  production,  increasing  demand  for  
14:432:32569:21:22:72:543:424:144:Times:144:Times:capital and therefore its price.  Only if capital and emissions are strong substitutes, so that 푒푃,퐾퐸 
14:433:32670:22:21:72:543:402:144:Times:144:Times:is positive and large enough to dominate the three other negative terms in 퐵푃, does a substitution 
14:434:32769:21:21:72:544:381:144:Times:144:Times:effect dominate, and an increase in the emissions tax subsidy reduces the demand for and price 
14:435:32864:21:20:72:542:360:144:Times:144:Times:of  capital.    The  coefficient  on  휏̂  is negative,  since  an  increase  in  휏̂  increases  the  price  of 
14:436:32975:20:21:71:134:340:144:Times:144:Times:emissions.11 
14:437:32987:21:21:108:543:319:144:Times:144:Times:An increase in the output subsidy can be viewed as equivalently a decrease in the price of 
14:438:33078:21:21:72:544:298:144:Times:144:Times:all  three  inputs.  The  coefficient  on 휀̂  in  equation  (16)  is  positive.    The  increase  in  the  output  
14:439:33192:21:21:72:547:277:144:Times:144:Times:subsidy creates only an output effect, causing the subsidized firm to want to expand production.  
14:440:33290:21:21:72:542:256:144:Times:144:Times:But  because  its  labor  input  is  fixed  at    퐿�퐺,    it  can  only  expand  by  increasing  its  capital  and 
14:441:33405:21:23:72:400:235:144:Times:144:Times:emissions demand.  This unambiguously raises the return to capital. 
14:442:33472:23:22:108:543:212:144:Times:144:Times:The  coefficient  on  the  labor  constraint,  퐿��퐺,  has  the  same  sign  as  the  expression

14:444:33670:21:25:71:543:169:144:Times:144:Times:relative to the private firm; that is, when firm G  has a higher capital-to-labor ratio than P.  One

14:446:33820:7:16:72:527:137:42:Times:99:Times:10 Since the supply of capital is fixed, the increase in capital in the subsidized firm replaces demand in the private 
14:447:33939:16:7:71:224:121:99:Times:99:Times:firm through the higher interest rate.   
14:448:33979:7:16:72:523:114:42:Times:99:Times:11 Technically, we assume that emissions and capital do not switch from being substitutes to complements or the 
14:449:34091:16:13:72:523:98:99:Times:99:Times:reverse.  If so, then it is possible that emissions and capital are substitutes for one firm, and complements for the 
14:450:34209:13:11:72:533:85:99:Times:99:Times:other.  In this case, a decrease in 휏̂ may have a different effect than an increase in 휙� as  휏̂ directly affects emissions 
14:451:34332:11:0:71:131:74:99:Times:99:Times:of both firms.  
15:452:34350:0:21:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:might think that a tightening of the labor constraint must hurt labor, since it is forcing its quantity 
15:453:34454:21:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:employed to be lower.  However, there is a fixed labor stock, and any reduction in labor used in 
15:454:34551:21:20:72:544:667:144:Times:144:Times:one  firm  is  matched  by  an  increase in labor  in  the  other  firm. Rather,  a  tightening  of  the  labor

16:491:37092:22:21:72:543:617:144:Times:144:Times:The first term comes directly from equation (8), where if nothing else changes, then the change

16:510:38578:21:21:71:546:268:144:Times:144:Times:(16) shows that an increase in 휀 will increase r.  Thus, combined with equation (18), as long as

17:526:39729:21:21:71:544:582:144:Times:144:Times:can  also  substitute  among  its  inputs.    The  subsidized  firm  could  respond  to  its  requirement  to

17:529:40049:21:21:71:543:520:144:Times:144:Times:than is capital, then the increase in the shadow price will lead to a substitution effect that works 
17:530:40150:21:20:71:542:499:144:Times:144:Times:to increase emissions in that sector.  Even in this case, this effect will only dominate if it is larger

17:575:40925:30:21:72:515:238:144:Times:144:Times:The first coefficient in this equation shows that the effect of  퐿��퐺  on  퐸�  depends on both the 
17:576:41024:21:20:72:539:217:144:Times:144:Times:factor shares of labor across the firms and on the allocation of emissions across the two firms.  If 
17:577:41125:20:21:72:514:197:144:Times:144:Times:the subsidized sector has a large share of total emissions, then this coefficient is likely to be 
17:578:41223:21:21:72:525:176:144:Times:144:Times:positive, since an increase in the allowed labor in the subsidized sector will allow it to expand 
17:579:41321:21:20:72:192:155:144:Times:144:Times:and demand more labor. 
17:580:41344:20:23:108:525:135:144:Times:144:Times: Every term in the next coefficient, on  휏̂,  is negative, since a higher emissions tax will 
17:581:41436:23:21:72:535:112:144:Times:144:Times:reduce emissions from both firms.  Likewise, the coefficient on  휙�  is positive, since an increase 
17:582:41536:21:0:72:532:91:144:Times:144:Times:in the emissions tax subsidy will reduce the subsidized firm’s emissions.  The coefficient on  휀̂  
18:583:41638:0:21:72:535:709:144:Times:144:Times:is positive, since an increase in the output subsidy to the subsidized firm will expand output and 
18:584:41737:21:21:72:539:688:144:Times:144:Times:increase its demand for emissions.  Likewise, the coefficient on the capital subsidy  훾�  is positive 
18:585:41839:21:21:72:516:667:144:Times:144:Times:so long as  BG < 0;  a higher subsidy encourages the subsidized firm to expand and therefore 
18:586:41932:21:21:72:194:646:144:Times:144:Times:demand more emissions. 
18:587:41954:21:20:108:523:625:144:Times:144:Times: All of the aforementioned effects represent output effects, while all of the substitution 
18:588:42044:20:21:72:539:605:144:Times:144:Times:effects are contained in the coefficient on  푟̂.  This coefficient is negative so long as  BG  and  BP  
18:589:42148:21:21:72:520:584:144:Times:144:Times:are both negative.  If any exogenous policy changes ends up increasing the capital rental rate 
18:590:42243:21:21:72:538:563:144:Times:144:Times:(relative to the numeraire), then the substitution effect will cause both firms to reduce emissions.

18:593:42374:20:21:108:544:501:144:Times:144:Times: We choose  parameter  values  to  calibrate  the  model  to  investigate  the  magnitude  of  the  
18:594:42473:21:21:72:545:480:144:Times:144:Times:effects found from the analytical solutions, many of which were difficult to sign unambiguously.  
18:595:42571:21:20:72:545:459:144:Times:144:Times:The  2006  China  Statistical  Yearbook  provides  data  on  capital  and  labor  inputs,  profits,  and  
18:596:42677:20:21:72:542:439:144:Times:144:Times:emissions.    Because  the  Chinese  data  (except  emissions)  are  separated  into  state-owned 
18:597:42775:21:21:71:544:418:144:Times:144:Times:enterprises  (SOEs)  and  private  firms,  these  data  provide  a  good  source  for  the  calibration.  We 
18:598:42884:21:20:71:516:397:144:Times:144:Times:consider the SOEs to be the subsidized sector and the private firms to be the private sector.   
18:599:42980:20:21:107:545:377:144:Times:144:Times: The  data  give  the  value  of  capital  and  labor  inputs  in  both  sectors,  and  thus  we  can  
18:600:43082:21:21:71:545:356:144:Times:144:Times:directly  calculate  the  input  shares  휆퐾푃,  etc.    We  chose  sulfur  dioxide  as  the  pollutant.    The  
18:601:43193:21:21:71:546:335:144:Times:144:Times:appendix  shows  that  a  calibration  with  chemical  oxygen  demand  yields  almost  identical  
18:602:43291:21:21:71:544:314:144:Times:144:Times:parameter  values.    Calibration  of  other  parameters,  including  the  expenditure  share  parameters  
18:603:43398:21:22:71:544:293:144:g_d0_f4:144:Times:휃푖푗,  is  described  in  the  Appendix.    The  Allen  elasticities  of  substitution  in  each  sector  are  not  
18:604:43513:22:21:72:544:271:144:Times:144:Times:provided in the China Statistical Yearbook.  Instead, we use the same values as in Fullerton and 
18:605:43610:21:21:72:543:250:144:Times:144:Times:Heutel (2010).  Those values are based on earlier estimates reported in de Mooij and Bovenberg 
18:606:43705:21:20:72:546:229:144:Times:144:Times:(1998), and  they  suggest  that  capital  is  a  slightly  better  substitute  for  pollution  than  is  labor.12  
18:607:43821:20:54:72:545:209:144:Times:144:Times:We  assume  that  the  cross-price  Allen  elasticities  are  identical  across  the  two  sectors.    But,  
18:608:43930:54:7:72:219:155:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
18:609:43979:7:17:72:539:148:42:Times:99:Times:12 De Mooij and Bovenberg (1998) actually present estimates of substitution between capital, labor, and energy, and 
18:610:44095:17:11:71:534:131:99:Times:99:Times:they consider estimates from Western Europe.  Considine and Larson (2006) use data from US electric utilities and 
18:611:44209:11:12:71:535:120:99:Times:99:Times:find that capital is a better substitute for pollution than is labor.  Intuitively, when pollution reductions are required, 
18:612:44333:12:11:71:530:108:99:Times:99:Times:new capital is installed, and thus capital and pollution are substitutes.  An alternate estimate is provided by Lu and 
18:613:44452:11:11:71:539:97:99:Times:99:Times:Zhou (2009), who estimate Allen elasticities between capital, labor, and energy for China.  They do not differentiate 
18:614:44570:11:12:71:512:86:99:Times:99:Times:between private firms and SOEs.  They find that capital and energy are complements and that labor is a better 
18:615:44680:12:0:71:216:74:99:Times:99:Times:substitute for energy than is capital. 
19:616:44721:0:21:72:545:709:144:Times:144:Times:because  of  the  different  expenditure  shares  across  sectors,  the  own-price  elasticities  are  not  
19:617:44829:21:21:72:188:688:144:Times:144:Times:identical across sectors. 
19:618:44854:21:20:108:544:667:144:Times:144:Times: Table  2  summarizes the  calibrated  parameter  values  (the  own-price  elasticities  are  not  
19:619:44952:20:25:71:544:647:144:Times:144:Times:presented  but  are  derivable  from  the  rest  of  the  parameter  values).    The  subsidized  sector  is  
19:620:45062:25:0:71:209:622:144:Times:144:Times:relatively  capital-intensive  (

19:626:45234:21:21:108:544:575:144:Times:144:Times: We simulate the incidence and environmental  effects of four different exogenous policy 
19:627:45322:21:21:72:545:554:144:Times:144:Times:changes.    First,  we  set    훾�=10%,    simulating  an  increase  in  the  capital  subsidy  rate  to  the  
19:628:45432:21:22:71:544:533:144:Times:144:Times:subsidized  firm.    Second,    휀̂=10%,    simulating  an  increase  in  the  output  subsidy  rate  to  the  
19:629:45542:22:24:71:543:511:144:Times:144:Times:subsidized firm.  Third,  휙�=10%,  simulating an increase in the pollution tax subsidy rate to the 
19:630:45641:24:21:71:544:487:144:Times:144:Times:subsidized  firm.    Last,    퐿��퐺=−10%,    simulating  an  decrease  in  the  minimum  labor  constraint  
19:631:45748:21:20:72:543:466:144:Times:144:Times:faced by the subsidized firm (this is negative so that all four policy simulations are a benefit to 
19:632:45848:20:21:72:545:446:144:Times:144:Times:the  subsidized  firm,  although  the  direct  subsidy S  will  in  equilibrium  decrease  to  leave  the  
19:633:45954:21:21:71:543:425:144:Times:144:Times:subsidized firm's profits unchanged).13  Panels B and C of Table 3 report the results from these 
19:634:46051:21:20:72:544:404:144:Times:144:Times:four  policy  changes.    Row  1  in  each  of  those  panels  represents  the  simulations  using  the  base  
19:635:46162:20:21:72:543:384:144:Times:144:Times:case parameter values; rows 2 through 5 represent sensitivity analysis of the elasticity parameters 
19:636:46262:21:21:71:141:363:144:Times:144:Times:(see panel A). 
19:637:46276:21:21:107:543:342:144:Times:144:Times: Focusing first on the base case simulations, the effect of either the capital subsidy or the 
19:638:46369:21:21:71:543:321:144:Times:144:Times:output subsidy on incidence  (푟̂  and  푤�)  is identical: a 10% increase in either subsidy increases 
19:639:46470:21:20:71:543:300:144:Times:144:Times:the rental rate by 5.45% and decreases the wage rate by 2.32% (like the analytical results, these 
19:640:46568:20:21:71:543:280:144:Times:144:Times:price changes are normalized relative to the price of the output good).  This change is driven by 
19:641:46666:21:21:71:544:259:144:Times:144:Times:the  factor  share  parameters.    Since  the  subsidized  sector  is  capital-intensive,  a  subsidy  to  it  is  
19:642:46781:21:21:71:542:238:144:Times:144:Times:likely to benefit capital relatively more than labor.  The pollution tax subsidy in panel C does not 
19:643:46882:21:20:71:543:217:144:Times:144:Times:affect  the  rental  rate  or  the  wage  to  two  decimal  places.    This  is  because  pollution  expenditure  
19:644:46996:20:21:71:543:197:144:Times:144:Times:shares are so small that a change in that input price has minimal general equilibrium effects.  The 
19:645:47096:21:21:71:542:176:144:Times:144:Times:change in the labor constraint reduces the capital price by 6.56% and increases the labor price by 
19:646:47195:21:20:71:542:155:144:Times:144:Times:2.79%.  This may seem counterintuitive, since a decrease in the required use of labor seems like 
19:647:47292:20:21:71:545:135:144:Times:144:Times:it  should  decrease  demand  for  labor  and  therefore  its  price.    But,  the  overall  labor  resource  
19:648:47402:21:15:71:543:114:144:Times:144:Times:constraint always binds, and thus the reduction of the labor constraint in the subsidized sector is 
19:649:47502:15:8:72:219:99:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
19:650:47551:8:17:72:523:91:42:Times:99:g_d0_f5:13 Note that since t  훾� ≡푑훾/(1−훾), 훾�=10% corresponds to an increase in 훾 equal to t  푑훾= 0.10∙(1−훾)=
19:651:47653:17:0:72:431:74:99:g_d0_f5:99:Times:0.043= 7.5%.  Similarly, the increase in 휀̂   is 0.1 and the increase in 휙� is 0.02 or 2.5%.    
20:652:47751:0:21:72:540:709:144:Times:144:Times:equivalent  to  forcing  more  labor  into  the  private  sector.    Because  the  private  sector  is  labor-
20:653:47861:21:21:71:546:688:144:Times:144:Times:intensive, a  reduction  in  the  labor  constraint  increases  the  demand  for  labor  relative  to  the  
20:654:47969:21:20:71:275:667:144:Times:144:Times:demand for capital, driving up the wage.   
20:655:48012:20:21:107:544:647:144:Times:144:Times: Next,  consider  the  pollution  effects  of  all  four  policy  simulations  under  the  base  case  
20:656:48114:21:21:71:546:626:144:Times:144:Times:parameter  values.   The  capital  subsidy  and  output  subsidy  both  have  identical  effects  on  
20:657:48216:21:21:71:543:605:144:Times:144:Times:pollution  in  the  private  sector  (a  0.83%  reduction),  since  the  private  sector's  demand  responds  
20:658:48326:21:20:71:542:584:144:Times:144:Times:only to the input prices, which are identical under the two policy changes.  By contrast, the 10% 
20:659:48424:20:21:71:542:564:144:Times:144:Times:capital subsidy causes only a 0.33% increase in the subsidized sector's emissions, while the 10% 
20:660:48521:21:21:71:542:543:144:Times:144:Times:output subsidy causes a 3.69% increase in the subsidized sector's emissions.  The output subsidy 
20:661:48618:21:20:71:543:522:144:Times:144:Times:substantially alters the quantity of output produced by the subsidized sector, not just its relative 
20:662:48719:20:21:71:542:502:144:Times:144:Times:input prices.  This increase in output of the subsidized sector is the primary driver of its increased 
20:663:48822:21:21:71:543:481:144:Times:144:Times:emissions.  The change in the pollution tax subsidy has no substantial effect (to two digits) on the 
20:664:48923:21:20:71:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:private  sector's  emissions,  but  it  increases  the  subsidized  sector's  emissions  by  3.36%.    Lastly,  
20:665:49035:20:21:71:544:440:144:Times:144:Times:the  change  in  the  labor  constraint  increases  the  private  sector's  emissions  and  decreases  the  
20:666:49143:21:21:71:543:419:144:Times:144:Times:subsidized  sector's  emissions.    The  decrease  of  10%  in  the  subsidized  firm's  labor  requirement  
20:667:49252:21:23:71:543:398:144:Times:144:Times:reduces its emissions by just under 10%.  This reflects the expression at the end of section III for 
20:668:49353:23:21:71:543:375:144:Times:144:Times:the coefficient on  퐿��퐺 in the expression for  퐸�퐺.  Although that expression could not be signed, 
20:669:49453:21:21:72:546:354:144:Times:144:Times:most  of  its  terms  are  positive,  indicating  a  negative output  effect  (i.e.  relaxing  the  labor  
20:670:49560:21:21:72:543:333:144:Times:144:Times:constraint reduces emissions).  The labor constraint forces the subsidized firm to use more labor, 
20:671:49659:21:20:72:545:312:144:Times:144:Times:and  therefore  produce  more  output, than  is  optimal.  Relaxing  the  labor constraint  therefore  
20:672:49762:20:21:71:544:292:144:Times:144:Times:reduces  output,  which  reduces  demand  for  the  pollution  input.  The  negative  terms  indicate  the  
20:673:49870:21:21:71:543:271:144:Times:144:Times:substitution effects from substituting emissions for labor.  Since the overall sign ends up positive 
20:674:49971:21:21:71:298:250:144:Times:144:Times:in this simulation, the output effect dominates. 
20:675:50019:21:20:107:544:229:144:Times:144:Times: Table 3  also  considers  alternate  parameter  values.    We  consider  alternate  values  for  the  
20:676:50121:20:21:71:543:209:144:Times:144:Times:substitution  elasticities  in  production,  since  these  are  the  parameters  about  which  we  know  the  
20:677:50231:21:21:71:545:188:144:Times:144:Times:least.    We  investigate  changes  in  two  of  the  cross-price  Allen  elasticities  for  each  of  the  two  
20:678:50344:21:21:71:542:167:144:Times:144:Times:sectors.  In each of rows 2 through 5, we change one of those Allen elasticities to 1 and leave all

20:680:50553:21:21:72:542:125:144:Times:144:Times:represents a case where emissions and capital are strong substitutes in the private sector.  In row 
20:681:50653:21:21:72:544:104:144:Times:144:Times:3,  emissions  and  labor  are  strong  substitutes  in  the  private  sector    (푒푃.퐸퐿= 1).    Rows  4  and  5  
20:682:50766:21:0:72:545:83:144:Times:144:Times:make the same assumptions, respectively, in the subsidized sector  (푒퐺,퐾퐸= 1  and  푒퐺,퐸퐿= 1).  
21:683:50864:0:21:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:The  results  of  the  simulations  for  each  of  these  new  parameter  values  are  presented  in  the 
21:684:50970:21:21:72:205:688:144:Times:144:Times:remaining rows of Table 3. 
21:685:50997:21:21:108:545:667:144:Times:144:Times: Consider  first  how  these  different  elasticity  values  affect  the  incidence  results    (푟̂    and  
21:686:51104:21:21:72:544:646:144:g_d0_f4:144:Times:푤�).  Differences between rows 1 through 5 for any of the four policy variables are smaller than 
21:687:51201:21:21:72:544:625:144:Times:144:Times:two  decimal  places.    Substitution  elasticities  in  production  do  not  substantively  affect  general  
21:688:51311:21:21:72:196:604:144:Times:144:Times:equilibrium factor prices. 
21:689:51337:21:22:108:546:583:144:Times:144:Times: Next,  consider  how  the  different  elasticity  values  affect  the  emissions  results    (퐸�푃    and  
21:690:51443:22:21:72:543:561:144:g_d0_f4:144:Times:퐸�퐺).  For the capital subsidy  훾�,  the largest decrease in private sector emissions occurs in row 3, 
21:691:51546:21:21:71:545:540:144:Times:144:Times:where  labor  and  emissions  are  strong  substitutes  in  the  private  sector.    Similarly,  the  only  
21:692:51654:21:20:72:544:519:144:Times:144:Times:decrease in subsidized sector emissions occurs in row 4, where capital and emissions are strong 
21:693:51750:20:21:72:543:499:144:Times:144:Times:substitutes in the subsidized sector.  In each of these rows, the changes in the relative input prices 
21:694:51853:21:21:72:544:478:144:Times:144:Times:(the  same  across  all  rows)  have  different  effects  on  the  demand  for  emissions  based  on  each  
21:695:51961:21:21:72:546:457:144:Times:144:Times:sector’s  substitution  elasticity.   Changes  in  the  substitution  elasticity  in  one  sector  do  not  
21:696:52069:21:20:72:352:436:144:Times:144:Times:materially affect emissions in the other sector, however.    
21:697:52130:20:21:108:543:416:144:Times:144:Times: For  the  output  subsidy  휀̂,  the emissions  from  the  private  sector  mimics  its  emissions 
21:698:52228:21:21:72:545:395:144:Times:144:Times:under  the  capital  subsidy  훾�  since  the  factor  prices  are  the  same.    But  the  subsidized  sector  
21:699:52339:21:21:72:542:374:144:Times:144:Times:expands  relative  to  the  private  sector  under  this  policy,  and  so  emissions  increase  in  each  row. 
21:700:52451:21:21:72:543:353:144:Times:144:Times:When capital and emissions are strong substitutes (row 4), the response of subsidized emissions 
21:701:52547:21:20:72:545:332:144:Times:144:Times:to  the  output  subsidy  is  larger.    Since  the  price  of  emissions  is  fixed  by  policy,  demand  for  
21:702:52659:20:21:71:544:312:144:Times:144:Times:emissions  rises  by  relatively  more  than  demand  for  capital,  whose  demand  is  moderated  by  the  
21:703:52767:21:21:71:542:291:144:Times:144:Times:increase in price of capital. Similarly, the response of subsidized emissions is especially strong if 
21:704:52869:21:21:71:544:270:144:Times:144:Times:emissions  and  labor  are  strong  substitutes  (row  5).    The  price  of emissions  is  fixed  by  policy,  
21:705:52981:21:20:72:546:249:144:Times:144:Times:whereas  the  shadow  price  of  labor increases,  motivating  the  subsidized  firm  to  substitute  
21:706:53083:20:22:72:183:229:144:Times:144:Times:emissions for labor.     
21:707:53108:22:21:108:542:207:144:Times:144:Times: The emissions tax subsidy 휙� has no effect on emissions in the private sector since it does 
21:708:53200:21:21:72:546:186:144:Times:144:Times:not  change  any  prices  that  sector  faces.    It  changes  the  relative  price  of  emissions  for  the  
21:709:53310:21:21:72:546:165:144:Times:144:Times:subsidized  sector,  and  thus  the  increased  subsidy  (lower  net  emissions  price)  increases  the  
21:710:53415:21:20:72:543:144:144:Times:144:Times:emissions of that sector.  When the substitutability between emissions and either input is large in 
21:711:53515:20:24:72:432:124:144:Times:144:Times:the subsidized sector (rows 4 and 5), the increase in its emissions is larger. 
21:712:53593:24:21:108:544:100:144:Times:144:Times: The  loosening  of  the  labor  constraint    (퐿��퐺=−10%)    always  increases  emissions  in  the  
21:713:53693:21:0:72:544:79:144:Times:144:Times:private  sector  and  decreases  emissions  in  the  subsidized  sector.    This  is  due  to  an  output  effect  
22:714:53811:0:21:72:543:709:144:Times:144:Times:(the private sector expands and the subsidized sector contracts).  But the magnitude of the change 
22:715:53910:21:21:72:544:688:144:Times:144:Times:in  emissions  depends  on  the  substitution  effects.    When  the  private  sector  has  more  ability  to  
22:716:54021:21:20:72:546:667:144:Times:144:Times:substitute  between  emissions  and  labor  (row  3),  its  emissions  increase  is  larger.    When  the  
22:717:54128:20:21:72:546:647:144:Times:144:Times:subsidized  sector  has  more  ability  to  substitute  between  emissions  and  capital  (row  4),  its  
22:718:54234:21:21:72:211:626:144:Times:144:Times:emissions decrease is larger. 
22:719:54263:21:21:108:543:605:144:Times:144:Times: Lastly, panel D of Table 3 explores the effect of these policy changes on total emissions, 
22:720:54354:21:25:72:542:584:144:g_d0_f4:144:Times:퐸�.  The change in total emissions is a weighted average of the change in the emissions of the two

22:726:54477:0:27:192:545:562:144:g_d0_f4:144:Times:�퐺).    In  addition  to  the  four  policy  changes  from  panels  B  and  C,  in  
22:727:54561:27:21:72:545:535:144:Times:144:Times:panel  D  we  present  the  change  in  total  emissions  in  response  to  a  10%  increase  in  휏,  the  
22:728:54668:21:20:72:544:514:144:Times:144:Times:emissions  tax.    This  tax  increase  directly  applies  to  both  the  subsidized  and  private  sectors,  in  
22:729:54782:20:21:72:243:494:144:Times:144:Times:contrast to the four other policies.   
22:730:54821:21:21:108:544:473:144:Times:144:Times: SOEs  account  for  75%  of  total  sulfur  emissions,  so  for  cases  in  which  private  and  SOE  
22:731:54923:21:21:72:546:452:144:Times:144:Times:emissions move in opposite directions, the change in subsidized emissions receives more weight.  
22:732:55020:21:20:72:545:431:144:Times:144:Times:Therefore,  the  capital  subsidy  increases  total  emissions  slightly,  because  the  larger  effect  on  
22:733:55129:20:21:72:540:411:144:Times:144:Times:private sector emissions receives less weight.  Subsidizing the capital accumulation of pollution-
22:734:55227:21:21:72:544:390:144:Times:144:Times:intensive  SOEs  has  a  surprisingly  small  effect  on  total  emissions  due  to  general  equilibrium  
22:735:55334:21:20:72:543:369:144:Times:144:Times:effects:    the  resulting  rise  in  the  price  of  capital  causes  private  firms  to  reduce  output  and 
22:736:55445:20:21:72:168:349:144:Times:144:Times:therefore pollution. 
22:737:55466:21:21:108:547:328:144:Times:144:Times: In  contrast,  the  output  and  pollution  subsidies  have  a  much  larger  effect  on  SOE  
22:738:55561:21:20:72:543:307:144:Times:144:Times:emissions, so the increase in total emissions is still substantial, despite the offsetting reduction in 
22:739:55665:20:21:72:545:287:144:Times:144:Times:emissions  from  the  private  sector.  Similarly, relaxing  the  labor  constraint  has  a  much  larger  
22:740:55772:21:21:72:544:266:144:Times:144:Times:effect on emissions  from  SOEs,  so  overall  emissions  fall  despite  the  increase  in  private  sector  
22:741:55881:21:20:72:131:245:144:Times:144:Times:emissions.   
22:742:55894:20:21:108:542:225:144:Times:144:Times: An  increase  in  the  pollution  tax  directly decreases  pollution  in  both  sectors.   Therefore, 
22:743:55996:21:21:72:543:204:144:Times:144:Times:total emissions are usually more sensitive to the pollution tax than to other policies, which have 
22:744:56095:21:21:72:542:183:144:Times:144:Times:offsetting  effects  on  pollution  across  sectors.    However, relaxing  the  labor  constraint  actually 
22:745:56203:21:20:72:546:162:144:Times:144:Times:decreases  pollution  more  than  increasing  the  pollution tax,  since  moving  labor  out  of  the  
22:746:56306:20:21:72:542:142:144:Times:144:Times:subsidized sector causes output and therefore pollution to fall substantially in that sector. Further, 
22:747:56409:21:21:72:545:121:144:Times:144:Times:changes  in  the  output  and  emissions  subsidies  effect  total  emissions  by a  similar  order  of  
22:748:56514:21:20:72:284:100:144:Times:144:Times:magnitude as changes in the emissions tax.

23:751:56575:20:21:108:543:688:144:Times:144:Times: We  present  an  analytical  general  equilibrium  model  to  study  the  effects  of  distortionary  
23:752:56677:21:20:71:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:subsidies on incidence and on pollution.  Policies intended to support one firm or one sector, like 
23:753:56777:20:21:71:543:647:144:Times:144:Times:input  or  output  price  subsidies,  can  also  have  unintended  general  equilibrium  price  effects  and  
23:754:56887:21:21:71:544:626:144:Times:144:Times:effects on environmental quality.  We calibrate the model to gauge the numerical magnitude of 
23:755:56981:21:21:71:544:605:144:Times:144:Times:these  effects,  and  in  particular  to  examine  how  they  depend  on  the  substitution  elasticities  in  
23:756:57092:21:20:71:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:production.    The  incidence  effects  (factor  prices)  are  relatively  unaffected  by  substitution 
23:757:57196:20:21:71:544:564:144:Times:144:Times:elasticities,  but  emissions  are  substantially affected  by  the  substitution  elasticities.    The  better  
23:758:57309:21:21:71:510:543:144:Times:144:Times:substitute pollution is for an input whose price increases, the more emissions will increase. 
23:759:57402:21:20:107:548:522:144:Times:144:Times: Many   studies   in   environmental   economics   examine   the   effect   of   environmental   
23:760:57498:20:21:71:543:502:144:Times:144:Times:regulation,  such  as  pollution  taxes,  on  the  environment.    This  paper  argues  that  the  unintended  
23:761:57609:21:21:71:544:481:144:Times:144:Times:consequences  of  non-environmental  policies  on  pollution are  also  important.  Indeed,  we  show  
23:762:57712:21:20:71:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:that reducing output and emissions subsidies to pollution-intensive firms reduces pollution by a 
23:763:57809:20:21:71:546:440:144:Times:144:Times:similar  order  of  magnitude  as  raising  emissions  taxes.  Policies  that  reduce  employment  at  
23:764:57912:21:21:71:543:419:144:Times:144:Times:subsidized  firms  have  even larger  effects.  Further,  reducing  non-environmental  subsidies  has 
23:765:58014:21:21:71:543:398:144:Times:144:Times:welfare benefits associated with moving capital and labor to more productive sectors, in addition 
23:766:58112:21:20:71:545:377:144:Times:144:Times:to  reducing  pollution.    Therefore,  the  welfare  benefits  of  reducing  subsidies  are  likely  to  be  
23:767:58222:20:21:71:362:357:144:Times:144:Times:greater than the welfare gains from raising pollution taxes.   
23:768:58285:21:21:107:544:336:144:Times:144:Times:   Our  model  is  simple  and  omits  many  salient  features  of  an  economy  that  might  also  
23:769:58384:21:20:71:543:315:144:Times:144:Times:affect emissions and incidence.  However, its simplicity is a virtue in that it allows us to isolate 
23:770:58485:20:21:71:544:295:144:Times:144:Times:individual  effects  without  confounding  complications.    Our  calibration  is  based  on  data  from  
23:771:58591:21:21:71:543:274:144:Times:144:Times:China,  where  our  data  source  clearly  delineates  between  subsidized  and  non-subsidized  firms. 
23:772:58695:21:20:71:542:253:144:Times:144:Times:The model can be applied to other economies and other industries.  Further work could consider, 
23:773:58791:20:21:71:543:233:144:Times:144:Times:for example, how subsidies to domestic auto manufacturing firms affected prices and emissions 
23:774:58885:21:21:71:544:212:144:Times:144:Times:from  that  sector  in  the  United  States,  or  how  agricultural  subsidies  in  OECD  countries  affect  
23:775:58994:21:21:71:401:191:144:Times:144:Times:emissions.  We leave these interesting extensions to future research.
