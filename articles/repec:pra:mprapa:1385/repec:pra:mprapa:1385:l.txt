3:27:497:14:14:90:530:665:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Following   extensive   economic   and   market   reforms   and   more   than   a   decade   of   
3:28:595:14:14:90:530:651:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:negotiations,   Vietnam   became   the   latest   country   to   accede   to   the   World   Trade   
3:29:696:14:14:90:527:637:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Organization  in  November  2006.  While  it  is  expected  that  greater  integration  into  the  
3:30:795:14:13:90:526:623:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:world  economy  will  boost  Vietnam’s  economic  growth  and  contribute  to  the  country’s  
3:31:890:13:14:90:528:610:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:ongoing  transition  towards  a  market  economy,  there  are  concerns  about  potentially  
3:32:983:14:14:90:529:596:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:negative   impacts   on   vulnerable   sectors   of   the   population,   including   remote   rural   
3:33:1086:14:14:90:525:582:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:populations, women and children. This paper examines the possible impacts of Vietnam’s 
3:34:1173:14:14:90:526:568:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:trade  liberalisation  on  children  in  poor  communities.  It  focuses  on  three  key  aspects  of  
3:35:1276:14:13:90:527:554:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:child  well-being  –  child  work  (domestic  and  extra-household),  educational  attainment  
3:36:1371:13:14:90:526:541:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:and  health  status  –  drawing  on  data  from  the  first  wave  of  the  Young  Lives  Vietnam

3:38:1573:14:14:90:526:513:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:differences  based  on  ethnicity,  household  poverty  status  and  vulnerability  to  declining  
3:39:1672:14:14:90:526:499:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:living  standards,  parental  (especially  maternal)  education  levels,  children’s  involvement

4:45:1840:14:13:90:93:692:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: 
4:46:1840:13:14:90:525:679:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:The implementation of market reforms since the mid-1980s has contributed to Vietnam’s 
4:47:1926:14:14:90:526:665:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:emergence  as  one  of  the  fastest  accelerating  economies  in  the  world.  High  sustained  
4:48:2023:14:14:90:525:651:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:economic performance has also facilitated significant poverty alleviation.2 One of the key 
4:49:2114:14:14:89:528:637:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:components  of  Vietnamese  economic  reforms  has  been  the  government’s  attempt  to  
4:50:2204:14:13:89:524:623:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:integrate more fully into the global economy. In November 2006, after 11 years of market 
4:51:2293:13:14:89:527:610:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:restructuring  and  lengthy  negotiations,  the  country  became  the  latest  member  of  the  
4:52:2389:14:14:89:264:596:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:World Trade Organization (WTO).  
4:53:2422:14:14:89:92:582:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: 
4:54:2422:14:14:89:529:568:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:In  the  process  of  joining  the  WTO,  Vietnam  has  made  multiple  commitments  to  
4:55:2511:14:13:89:529:554:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:restructuring   its   economy   and   related   policy  frameworks.  A  key  question  that  is  
4:56:2608:13:14:89:527:541:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:beginning  to  emerge,  however,  relates  to  the  social  impact  of  trade  liberalisation  and  
4:57:2708:14:14:89:524:527:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:associated reforms, especially in a context of growing inequality (eg, Hague and Nguyen, 
4:58:2797:14:14:89:529:513:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:2005).  This  is  of  particular  concern,  given  that  poverty  rates  among  some  rural  
4:59:2890:14:14:89:528:499:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:populations,  especially  ethnic  minorities,  are  four  to  five  times  higher  than  average  
4:60:2988:14:13:89:247:485:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f7:B:(Vietnam MDG Report, 2005).   
4:61:3018:13:14:89:95:472:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:  
4:62:3020:14:14:89:528:458:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:The  mechanisms  through  which  globalisation  in  general  and  trade  liberalisation  in  
4:63:3113:14:14:89:528:444:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:particular affects poverty are complex (eg, Winters et al., 2002, Duncan and Doan Quang, 
4:64:3202:14:14:90:527:430:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:2000)  and  there  are  no  easy  answers.  Nevertheless,  resulting  changes  are  likely  to  be  
4:65:3302:14:13:90:526:416:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:painful  for  some  sectors  of  the  population,  especially  the  disadvantaged  and  vulnerable.  
4:66:3403:13:14:90:525:403:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:In the case of Vietnam, although trade liberalisation has led to improved welfare for the 
4:67:3493:14:14:90:528:389:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:poor (Benjamin and Brandt, 2002) and did not exacerbate inequality (Seshan, 2004, 2005  
4:68:3581:14:14:90:526:375:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:McCarty  and  Tran,  2003),  analysts  have  raised  particular  concerns  about  remote  rural  
4:69:3678:14:14:90:526:361:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:populations,  especially  those  involved  in  some  agricultural  sectors  (sugar,  salt,  maize,  
4:70:3778:14:13:90:526:347:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:some  animal  products)  which  are  likely  to  face  competition  from  subsidised  European  
4:71:3874:13:14:90:528:334:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Union (EU) and US products (Kirkbride, 2005), as well as possible gendered implications, 
4:72:3963:14:14:90:491:320:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:given the unequal labour market positioning of men and women (eg, Tran, 2002).3  
4:73:4044:14:14:89:92:306:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: 
4:74:4044:14:14:89:522:292:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Taking  as  our  starting  point  a  growing  body  of  literature  on  the  ways  in  which  macro-
4:75:4144:14:13:89:527:278:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:economic  policy  shifts  may  have  an  impact  on  children  (Marcus,  2003;  Waddington  
4:76:4236:13:14:89:528:265:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:2004;  Ansell,  2005),  this  paper  explores  the  possible  effects  of  WTO  accession  on  
4:77:4331:14:14:89:531:251:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Vietnamese children.4 Our rationale for a particular focus on child well-being is threefold.  
4:78:4424:14:14:89:526:237:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:First,  a  broader  body  of  literature  emphasises  that  childhood  poverty  cannot  simply  be  
4:79:4524:14:14:90:526:223:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:deduced  from  household  poverty  but  is  also  shaped  by  intra-household  distribution  of  
4:80:4621:14:13:90:526:209:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:power  and  resources  (eg,  Regmi  and  Tisdell,  2002;[ADDED]).  Second,  addressing  the  
4:81:4714:13:14:90:529:196:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:particular  vulnerabilities  faced  by  children  living  in  poverty  may  be  important  for  
4:82:4810:14:14:90:533:182:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:tackling    life-course    and    intra-generational    poverty    transfers.    Economic    shocks    
4:83:4913:14:14:90:524:168:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:experienced as an infant or child may have lasting impacts on human capital development 
4:84:5001:14:14:90:525:154:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:(eg, Harper et al., 2003). Lastly, children under 14 years constitute more than 30 per cent 
4:85:5093:14:13:90:522:140:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:of the population in Vietnam (World Bank, 2006),  so  to  consider  the  impacts  of  macro-
4:86:5185:13:14:90:524:127:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:economic reforms on poverty reduction without paying specific attention to the effects on 
4:87:5275:14:14:90:434:113:144:g_d0_f6:64:g_d0_f6:B:childhood poverty risks neglecting a significant proportion of the poor.5
4:88:5348:14:0:90:93:99:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: 
5:89:5349:0:13:90:527:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Our  analysis  utilises  data  from  the  Young  Lives  Project,  an  international  longitudinal  
5:90:5448:13:14:90:527:695:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:policy-research  project  on  childhood  poverty.6  We  adopt  a  modified  version  of  the  
5:91:5542:14:14:90:525:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:framework developed by Waddington (2004) and Anderson et al. (2005) to examine the 
5:92:5625:14:14:90:527:667:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:impact  of  trade  liberalisation  on  children.  The  framework  traces  the  impacts  of  trade  
5:93:5724:14:14:90:527:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:liberalisation  to  macro-level  variables  through  to  household  level  variables  and  finally  
5:94:5824:14:13:90:527:639:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:child  well-being  (see  Figure  2.1  below).  Whereas  research  to  date  on  the  relationship  
5:95:5923:13:14:89:527:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:between  trade  liberalisation  and  child  welfare  has  focused  predominantly  on  the  link  
5:96:6020:14:14:89:529:612:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:between   trade   openness/liberalisation   and   child   labour   (Edmonds   and   Turk,   2004   
5:97:6119:14:14:89:526:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Edmonds  and  Pavcnik,  2004  a,  b  ),  we  also  consider  the  potential  impact  on  children’s  
5:98:6220:14:14:89:528:584:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:scholastic  achievement  and  health  status.  Owing  to  data  limitations,  we  pay  greater  
5:99:6316:14:13:89:526:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:attention  to  the  link  between  household  level  variables  and  child  well-being  indicators,  
5:100:6417:13:14:89:525:557:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:drawing on insights from literature on poverty and intra-household dynamics. Given that 
5:101:6505:14:14:89:526:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:there  have  been  few  social  impact  analyses  of  the  WTO  accession  to  date  (Hague  and  
5:102:6603:14:14:89:529:529:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Nguyen,  2005),  and  that  a  growing  body  of  literature  suggests  that  well-designed  
5:103:6696:14:14:89:526:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:economic  policies  can  alleviate  manifestations  of  childhood  poverty  (eg,  Waddington,  
5:104:6791:14:13:89:526:501:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:2004),  we  see  this  as  an  important  contribution  to  the  current  policy  discussions  around  
5:105:6894:13:14:89:288:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:the WTO accession process in Vietnam.

5:109:7130:14:13:89:525:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:main changes in Vietnam’s trade regime since the initiation of the Doi Moi (Renovation)

5:112:7416:14:14:89:524:391:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:examine the relationship between trade liberalisation and child labour. Unlike the existing 
5:113:7508:14:14:89:527:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:literature,  we  model  children’s  involvement  in  domestic  chores  separately  from  other  
5:114:7604:14:13:89:525:363:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:forms of labour. In Section 6, we examine the potential impact on children’s educational 
5:115:7693:13:14:89:527:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:achievement  (including  parents’  ability  to  pay  for  extra  tuition  classes,  a  major  policy

6:124:8204:14:13:90:525:662:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:This section briefly outlines a framework to understand the conceptual linkages between 
6:125:8292:13:14:90:525:649:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:trade  liberalisation  and  child  well-being,  relying  heavily  on  frameworks  by  Waddington  
6:126:8390:14:14:90:525:635:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:(2004)  and  Anderson  et  al.  (2005)  (see  Figure  2.1).  As  suggested  by  Anderson  et  al. 
6:127:8487:14:14:90:527:621:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:(2005)  and  Winters  et  al.  (2002)  and  evidenced  by  a  large  literature  on  the  linkages  
6:128:8587:14:14:90:526:607:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:between  globalisation,  trade  openness/liberalisation,  economic  growth  on  the  one  hand  
6:129:8683:14:13:90:526:593:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:and  the  distribution  of  inequality  and  poverty  reduction  at  the  household  level  on  the  
6:130:8784:13:14:90:525:580:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:other, the task of tracing micro-level effects is complicated.7 The endeavour is even more 
6:131:8875:14:14:90:525:566:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:challenging when we seek to disaggregate the effects within the household. Measures that 
6:132:8964:14:14:89:525:552:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:either aggravate or ameliorate aggregate household poverty may have diverse impacts on 
6:133:9051:14:13:90:526:538:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:men  and  women,  girls  and  boys.  Intra-household  differences  are  dependent  upon  social  
6:134:9148:13:14:90:526:525:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:and  legal  factors  including  the  gendered  composition  of  the  labour  market,  (un)equal  
6:135:9245:14:14:90:526:511:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:access to credit markets and legal  rights  regarding  land  title  and ownership, inheritance, 
6:136:9341:14:14:89:525:497:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:etc  and  cultural  norms  and  practices  surrounding  the  intra-household  division  of  labour,  
6:137:9442:14:32:89:457:483:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:assets and decision-making (eg, Ansell, 2005; Kabeer, 2003, Folbre, 2002).  
6:138:9518:32:13:89:526:451:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:As  depicted  in  Figure  2.1,  trade  liberalisation  may  affect  child  well-being  through  two  
6:139:9619:13:14:89:526:438:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:main channels. The first is through its impacts on household livelihoods and the ways in 
6:140:9708:14:14:89:528:424:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:which  households  respond  to  economic  opportunities  (or  loss  thereof)  resulting  from  
6:141:9803:14:14:89:531:410:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:trade   liberalisation.   The   second   channel   involves   the   spillover   impact   of   trade   
6:142:9905:14:14:89:526:396:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:liberalisation  on  the  accessibility  and  affordability  of  key  public  services  essential  for  
6:143:10008:14:31:89:362:382:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:child well-being, such as health and education facilities. 
6:144:10067:31:14:89:529:351:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:The  approach  involves  disaggregating  the  linkages  between  trade  liberalisation  on  
6:145:10159:14:14:90:525:337:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:children as follows: (a) the effects of policy changes on a country’s trade regime and, in

6:148:10442:14:13:90:526:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:household  income,  labour  supply,  and  access  to  public  services;  and  (c)  the  impact  of

7:160:10987:14:14:90:527:310:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:children  in  three  main  ways:  spending  on  children,  children’s  involvement  in  work  
7:161:11081:14:14:90:394:296:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:activities and the quantity and quality of the care they receive.

7:164:11169:14:14:90:526:255:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:It is generally assumed that increases in family income have a direct and positive impact 
7:165:11259:14:14:90:526:241:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:on  children.  Although  it  is  often  the  case  that  children  in  higher-income  families  have  
7:166:11361:14:13:90:526:227:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:access  to  more  and  better  quality  food,  education  and  health  services,  the  impact  is  not  
7:167:11465:13:14:90:526:214:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:necessarily  linear,  particularly  in  the  context  of  credit  and  labour  market  imperfections  
7:168:11567:14:14:90:526:200:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:(Ranjan,  1999,  2001;  Jafarey  and  Lahiri,  2002).  Feminist  analysis  has  also  shown  that  
7:169:11666:14:14:90:526:186:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:gendered  intra-household  dynamics  play  an  important  mediating  role.  Thus  impacts  on

7:172:11939:13:14:89:525:145:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:and their time allocation between productive and reproductive tasks (eg, Ellis, 2003). For 
7:173:12030:14:14:89:527:131:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:example,  empirical  evidence  to  date  suggests  that  in  female-headed  families  or  those  
7:174:12127:14:14:89:526:117:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:where  women  have  equal  decision-making  power,  rising  income  is  more  likely  to  be

7:176:12319:14:13:89:528:89:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:households  often  spend  increased  earnings  on  individual  expenses  such  as  alcohol,

8:219:13748:14:14:90:517:584:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:future  earnings.  For  example,  Behrman  and  Knowles  (1999)  found  there  was  a  positiv
8:220:13842:14:13:90:529:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:link  between  parental  income  and  children’s  scholastic  achievement.  However,  an  
8:221:13932:13:14:90:528:557:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:increasing  body  of  literature  suggests  that  this  decline  in  child  work  is  subject  to  
8:222:14031:14:14:90:525:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:significant threshold effects. Research by Edmonds and Turk (2004) suggests that once a 
8:223:14119:14:14:90:525:529:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:country reaches an average gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of US$5,000, child 
8:224:14205:14:14:90:525:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:work falls rapidly. However, in developing countries increased family income may result 
8:225:14293:14:13:90:526:501:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:in  a  greater  demand  for  child  labour,  as  the  increased  income  may  be  used  as  start-up

8:227:14498:14:14:90:527:474:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:agriculture,  greater  income,  particularly  through  credit  programmes,  may  lead  to  the

8:243:15564:14:14:90:526:253:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:may  need  to  shoulder  more  domestic  tasks  to  compensate  for  reduced  adult  (typically

9:257:16542:13:14:90:528:695:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:child  malnutrition  as  higher  incomes  from  economic  growth  have  led  to  improved  
9:258:16633:14:14:90:525:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:household food security and nutritional intake. Glewwe et al. (2003), however, found that

9:276:17955:0:14:90:343:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:nominal and real household incomes. According to t
9:277:18005:14:13:90:526:501:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:liberalisation  is  that  prices  tend  to  move  together  as  a  result  of  competition:  prices  of  
9:278:18110:13:14:90:526:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:imported  goods  fall  and  those  of  exported  goods  rise,  at  least  relative  to  each  other.  
9:279:18212:14:14:90:527:474:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:According  to  Winters  (2000a  and  b),  the  direction  and  strength  of  these  effects  will  
9:280:18311:14:14:90:527:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:depend  on  whether  the  household  is  a  net  buyer  or  seller  of  the  goods  and  services  
9:281:18410:14:14:90:526:446:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:concerned.  In  the  case  of  Vietnam,  for  example,  when  the  government  decided  in  the

9:283:18613:13:14:90:528:419:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:rice  trade  nearly  tripled,  while  domestic  rice  prices  increased  by  over  40  per  cent

9:300:19514:14:14:90:528:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:exports  will  increase  to  reward  those  types  of  labour  that  are  used  intensively  in

9:305:19987:14:14:90:526:115:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:unskilled labour, such as Vietnam, then we would expect that trade liberalisation to be a 
9:306:20076:14:13:90:525:101:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:force  for  reducing  inequality  by  raising  the  real  wages  of  the  unskilled  (Cigno  et  al., 
9:307:20178:13:0:90:527:88:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:2004).  In  Vietnam,  trade  liberalisation  has  benefited  rice  farmers,  who  in  general  are

10:310:20466:14:14:89:525:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:there  is  likely  to  be  a  greater  willingness  to  invest  in  capital  and  education,  which  has

10:314:20747:13:14:98:98:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:A:ructures.  Typically  in  developing  countries,  revenues  from  import  tariffs  and  export  st
10:315:20845:14:14:90:527:612:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:taxes  are  an  import  source  of  government  revenue.  For  Vietnam,  revenue  from  trade  
10:316:20940:14:14:90:526:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:taxes  accounts  for  over  20  per  cent  of  total  revenue  (UNDP,  2005).  If  a  reduction  of

10:321:21415:14:14:90:525:529:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:may lead to a larger increase in trade volume, or an increase in trade tax compliance (eg,

10:323:21603:14:13:90:528:501:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:raising  revenue,  and  the  question  of  how  to  recover  potential  revenue  loss  is  a  key

10:325:21787:14:14:90:525:474:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:to strengthen the implementation of broad-base taxes such as value-added taxes (UNDP, 
10:326:21873:14:0:90:463:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:2005). Vietnam is no exception; it has recently introduced value-added taxes.

11:337:22575:14:14:89:525:566:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Removing restrictions on trading rights (the right to import and export) represents one of 
11:338:22666:14:14:89:526:552:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:the key breakthroughs in trade reforms in Vietnam. Before 1986 state-owned enterprises 
11:339:22753:14:13:89:527:538:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:(SOEs)  had  a  monopoly  over  international  trade.  In  1986  restrictions  on  international

11:341:22949:14:14:89:527:511:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:regime  severely  restrictive.  Even  in  the  early  1990s,  only  licensed  trading  companies  
11:342:23047:14:14:89:526:497:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:were  allowed  to  export  and  import.  These  restrictions  were  gradually  relaxed  with  the  
11:343:23146:14:14:89:525:483:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:removal of regulations on foreign trade contracts and shipment permits in 1996. The year

11:345:23339:13:14:89:528:456:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:the  removal  of  the  licensing  requirements  for  exporting  and  importing  thanks  to  the

11:349:23706:14:13:90:527:400:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:significant  step  was  made  in  2001  with  the  Decree  44/2001/ND-CP  allowing  all  legal

11:359:24459:14:13:90:526:262:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Another  significant  step  towards  international  economic  integration  was  in  2000  when

11:361:24641:14:14:90:526:235:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:BTA,  Vietnam  agreed  to  phase  out  all  non-tariff  barriers,  including  import  and  export

12:377:25636:14:14:90:525:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:An important aspect of trade barriers is the tariffs imposed on imported goods. Vietnam's 
12:378:25725:14:13:90:526:639:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:tariff  schedule  was  first  introduced  in  1988  and  was  then  rationalised  in  1992.  Tariffs  
12:379:25827:13:14:90:529:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:were  further  simplified  in  1999,  following  Vietnam’s  accession  to  AFTA  and  in

12:384:26285:13:14:90:526:557:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Currently,  there  are  three  sets  of  tariff  rates:  most-favoured  nation  (MFN)  rates,  which  
12:385:26387:14:14:90:524:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:apply to about 75 per cent of total imports from countries that have normal trade relations 
12:386:26479:14:14:90:525:529:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:with Vietnam; common effective preferential tariff (CEPT) rates, which apply to imports

12:391:26955:14:14:90:527:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Indonesia. The number of tariff lines and the maximum tariff rates have also decreased.13

13:418:28960:14:14:90:525:347:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:available in the family. Details of the construction of this index are outlined in Appendix

13:420:29056:28:14:89:526:305:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Finally,  as  discussed  in  Tran  et  al.  (2003),  the  sampling  method  adopted  in  the  Young

14:430:29612:14:14:89:528:633:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Recently  the  potential  impact  of  globalisation  on  the  incidence  of  child  labour  has  
14:431:29709:14:14:89:526:619:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:attracted    attention  from  both  the  Vietnamese  public  and  academics.  Although  there  is  
14:432:29808:14:13:89:527:605:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:consensus  that  poverty  is  a  key  contributing  factor  (Basu  2004,  and  Basu  and  Van

14:435:30078:14:14:89:525:564:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:children’s engagement in work. In this section we use a multinomial logit model to model 
14:436:30167:14:14:89:526:550:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:children’s  involvement  in  work  and  chores.  Whereas  most  research  on  child  labour  to  
14:437:30264:14:13:89:526:536:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:date  has  focused  on  ‘work  for  pay,  work  in  formal  household  and  work  in  agriculture’

14:439:30449:14:14:89:525:509:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:because this type of work may be equally taxing on children’s physical and mental health 
14:440:30537:14:14:89:525:495:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:and constrain children’s available time for education and leisure (eg, Woldehanna et al.,

14:442:30722:14:13:89:525:467:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:trade liberalisation will be mediated through household-level variables, this section looks 
14:443:30813:13:14:89:525:454:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:at the determinants of child labour. We first outline the econometric methods and discuss 
14:444:30903:14:14:89:525:440:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:the data and independent variables used in estimating the work–chore decisions. We then 
14:445:30991:14:14:89:318:426:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:discuss the estimation results and conclusions.

15:509:36957:13:14:89:525:340:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:In the Young Lives dataset, as indicated in Table 5.1 above, there are four alternatives for 
15:510:37049:14:14:89:525:326:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:the parents to choose from: J=1: Neither work nor chores; J=2: Chores only, ie, domestic

15:513:37318:14:14:89:525:285:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:observed in the alternative J=4, causing a numerical problem in estimating such a 4-state

15:524:37864:14:14:89:219:133:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f6:B:(a) Child characteristics  
15:525:37891:14:14:89:525:119:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:These characteristics, which include gender, age, ethnicity, and birth order, are often used 
15:526:37984:14:13:89:526:105:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:in the modelling of child labour. As we are using the eight-year-old child cohort dataset, 
15:527:38075:13:14:89:525:92:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:we can only control for gender, birth order and ethnicity, and not for age differences. As 
15:528:38166:14:0:89:525:78:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:the effect of gender (MALE) on the work–chore decision is not unambiguous, it will be 
16:529:38254:0:13:89:525:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:determined in the empirical analysis. As for ethnicity (KIDETHNIC), although there are 
16:530:38341:13:14:89:525:695:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:a number of ethnic groups in the data, we only include a dummy indicating whether child 
16:531:38429:14:14:89:527:681:144:Times:144:g_d0_f6:B:i  belongs  to  the  Kinh  ethnic  group  or  an  ethnic  minority  group.  This  is  because  the  
16:532:38529:14:14:89:525:667:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:number of observations for ethnic minority groups is small. There is no obvious priori to 
16:533:38619:14:14:89:526:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:speculate on the effect of the variable. Children from the Kinh ethnic group may appear 
16:534:38707:14:13:89:526:639:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:to have a higher participation rate in schooling and lower participation rate in the labour 
16:535:38798:13:14:89:527:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:force.  However,  this  may  be  due  to  higher  household  income  and  access  to  education  
16:536:38895:14:14:89:525:612:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:facilities. Again the differences between ethnic groups are left for the empirical exercise. 
16:537:38988:14:14:89:526:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:With respect to birth order (ORDER), being a first child born would mean having better 
16:538:39075:14:14:89:525:584:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:chances of accessing full parental attention and household resources without sharing with 
16:539:39164:14:13:89:526:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:other siblings. On the other hand, the probability of having to work would increase with 
16:540:39253:13:14:89:525:557:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:age and being the first child born may also mean that the eldest child within the family is 
16:541:39345:14:14:89:525:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:more likely to be involved in work – both domestic and extra-household work. As argued 
16:542:39432:14:14:89:526:529:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:by  Rosati  and  Tzannatos  (2000),  parents  allocate  their  children’s  time  among  different  
16:543:39531:14:14:89:527:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:activities  on  the  basis  of  their  realised  fertility  decisions.  Again,  this  issue  needs  to  be  
16:544:39639:14:13:89:196:501:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:assessed empirically.

16:547:39693:14:14:89:528:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:These variables include household characteristics such as family income, family structure, 
16:548:39784:14:14:89:367:446:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:parental schooling, occupations, and employment status.

16:550:39841:13:14:89:525:419:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:First, family income as argued above is obviously an important determinant of whether a 
16:551:39929:14:14:89:525:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:child would become involved in employment. In the Young Lives Vietnam dataset, there 
16:552:40014:14:14:89:532:391:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:is   no   information   regarding   income.   We   instead   constructed   a   wealth   index   
16:553:40110:14:14:89:526:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:(WEALTHINDEX)  to  proxy  for  family  income.  As  argued  by  Edmonds  (2003a  and  b),  
16:554:40201:14:13:89:525:363:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:child poverty in general and child labour in particular is a problem of household poverty. 
16:555:40292:13:14:89:526:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Children  from  better-off  families  would  have  a  lower  probability  of  having  to  work  to  
16:556:40392:14:14:89:527:336:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:contribute  to  household  consumption.  We  expect  the  variable  WEALTHINDEX  to  be  
16:557:40481:14:14:89:257:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:negatively related to child labour.

16:561:40704:14:14:89:526:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:(OWNHOUSE),  whether  the  family  owns  land  (OWNLAND),  whether  the  family  is  in  
16:562:40793:14:14:89:527:253:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:debt  (DEBT)  and  the  number  of  rooms  in  the  house  (NUMROOM).  We  expect  these  
16:563:40883:14:13:89:381:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:variables to be negatively related to child labour and chores.

16:566:41046:14:14:89:527:198:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:work.  The  education  level  of  parents  is  likely  to  be  closely  related  to  the  amount  of  
16:567:41148:14:14:89:528:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:parental encouragement with respect to investment in education received by their children.

16:570:41438:14:14:89:525:143:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:and this will be determined in our empirical analysis. In our model, parental schooling is 
16:571:41529:14:14:89:526:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:measured  by  maternal  education  (MUMEDU)  and  paternal  education  (DADEDU).  We  
16:572:41615:14:14:89:463:115:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:expect child labour to be negatively related to the level of parental education.

17:574:41698:0:13:89:525:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Recent empirical literature (Rosati and Tzannatos, 2000) has shown the importance of the 
17:575:41787:13:14:89:525:695:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:household structure and of the presence of siblings for child work decisions. The number 
17:576:41876:14:14:89:525:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:of siblings in the family may affect the probability of a child working, going to school or 
17:577:41968:14:14:89:525:667:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:doing domestic chores. The importance of this variable derives from a belief that there is 
17:578:42059:14:14:89:525:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:a trade-off between child quality and quantity. Families are seen as solving a constrained 
17:579:42149:14:13:89:526:639:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:maximisation  problem.  Families’  utility  is  maximised  with  respect  to  the  quantity  and  
17:580:42247:13:14:89:526:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:quality  of  children  as  well  as  other  ‘goods’,  but  constrained  by  financial  resources  and  
17:581:42350:14:14:89:528:612:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:time.  The  trade-off  exists  since  parents’  resources  and  time  are  limited  and  must  be  
17:582:42449:14:14:89:528:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:spread  more  thinly  with  more  children  (eg,  Becker  and  Tomes,1979;  Behrman  and

17:585:42713:13:14:89:526:557:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:resources  and  parents  are  assumed  to  allocate  time  and  other  resources  to  maximise  the  
17:586:42814:14:14:89:525:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:objective function. The theory implies that a reduction in the number of children will free 
17:587:42906:14:14:89:525:529:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:resources for current consumption (of both parents and children). If this reduction is large 
17:588:42998:14:14:89:526:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:enough, parents will transfer some surplus resources to future consumption, by reducing 
17:589:43086:14:13:89:525:501:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:the labour supply of their children. In our empirical analysis we control not only for the 
17:590:43177:13:14:89:526:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:number  of  siblings  (NUMSIB)  but  also  for  the  number  of  boys  born  (BOYBORN)  and  
17:591:43270:14:14:89:525:474:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:girls born (GRLBORN). For family structure, we include an indicator for female-headed 
17:592:43356:14:14:89:526:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:families  (FEMALEHEAD).  It  is  expected  that  children  from  female-headed  households  
17:593:43448:14:14:89:526:446:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:will  be  worse  off  than  those  with  male  household  heads,  owing  to  the  feminisation  of  
17:594:43548:14:13:89:525:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:poverty, and this may therefore affect the probability of children being involved in chores 
17:595:43640:13:14:89:216:419:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:or extra-household work.

17:599:43846:14:13:89:527:363:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:family’s  experience  of  any  negative  events  (NEGATIVE  EVENT).  We  expect  that  the  
17:600:43938:13:14:89:525:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:negative event may force a child into labour. As argued by Rosati and Tzannatos (2000), 
17:601:44026:14:14:89:528:336:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:if  the  parents  are  altruistic,  then  they  may  shield  their  children  from  the  effects  of  
17:602:44128:14:14:89:528:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:negative  events  by  re-allocating  domestic  resources.  However,  we  believe  this  is  an  
17:603:44224:14:13:89:171:308:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:empirical issue.

17:605:44242:14:14:89:526:281:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:The  dataset  also  contains  a  number  of  indicators  for  different  types  of  negative  events

17:607:44436:14:14:89:526:253:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:to  use  indicators  for  individual  negative  events  such  as  a  decrease  in  the  availability  of  
17:608:44542:14:13:89:524:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:food (99.5 per cent of respondents reporting no decrease in food availability) or migration 
17:609:44634:13:14:89:526:226:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:status  (98.4  per  cent  respondents  reporting  non-migration  status)  because  of  insufficient  
17:610:44735:14:14:89:525:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:variation in the data. We do, however, include an indicator for negative events leading to 
17:611:44826:14:14:89:522:198:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:loss of income (HHJOB) and expect that this will increase the probability of child labour.

17:616:45196:14:14:89:527:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:directly  to  trade  liberalisation,  trade  liberalisation  may  affect  the  probability  of  child  
17:617:45299:14:14:89:372:115:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:labour if it leads to changes in household living standards.

18:620:45392:0:13:89:525:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:A number of community level and macro-level variables are used in our model. First, we 
18:621:45479:13:14:89:525:695:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:expect that an increase in the direct cost of education will reduce schooling in favour of 
18:622:45570:14:14:89:524:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:labour for at least some children. We therefore include the information on cost of primary 
18:623:45661:14:14:89:526:667:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:education (PRIMACOST) at the community  level  in  our  model. The percentage of poor 
18:624:45746:14:14:89:526:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:families  in  the  commune  (POORFAM)  may  affect  child  labour.  Distance  to  school  may  
18:625:45841:14:13:89:526:639:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:also  affect  child  labour.  The  farther  the  school  from  the  household,  we  expect  the  more  
18:626:45944:13:14:89:526:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:likely that children would be involved in child labour. We control for distance to school 
18:627:46034:14:14:89:527:612:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:in  our  analysis  (SCHDIS3).  We  also  hypothesise  that  the  presence  of  a  factory  in  the  
18:628:46134:14:14:89:529:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:neighbourhood  would  increase  the  chance  of  child  labour,  and  we  control  for  this  
18:629:46228:14:14:89:528:584:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:(FACTORY).  We  also  include  a  series  of  dummy  variables  for  different  provinces

18:638:46752:14:14:89:525:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:characteristics, statistically there is some evidence of preference towards boys. Boys are

18:645:47419:14:13:89:525:363:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:nor chores). Birth order also emerged as statistically significant – so younger children are 
18:646:47512:13:14:89:526:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:less  likely  to  be  involved  in  work  activities  than  their  older  siblings  and  more  likely  to  
18:647:47619:14:32:89:225:336:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:engage in domestic chores.

18:655:48232:13:14:89:526:190:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:low – among parents of the eight-year-old child cohort, 90 per cent of parents had only a

19:669:49359:14:13:89:526:627:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:study,  Edmonds  and  Turk  (2004)  suggest  the  possibility  of  a  threshold  effect  operating  
19:670:49459:13:14:89:527:614:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:here.20  Similarly,  in  other  micro-econometric  studies  by  Woldehanna  et  al.  (2005)  for  
19:671:49557:14:14:89:525:600:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Ethiopia and by Dammert (2005) for Peru, there is strong evidence of nonlinearity in the 
19:672:49646:14:14:89:422:586:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:relationship between wealth/income and child labour and schooling.

19:674:49714:14:13:89:529:558:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Other  variables  were  also  included  in  the  model  to  control  for  family  economic  
19:675:49806:13:14:89:527:545:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:background  such  as  whether  the  family  is  currently  in  debt,  the  number  of  rooms  per  
19:676:49905:14:14:89:525:531:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:house, house and land ownership. But these variables were also not statistically related to

19:678:50090:14:14:89:527:503:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:variables  is  a  perfect  substitute  for  income  and  expenditure,  it  seems  important  that  in  
19:679:50193:14:13:89:525:489:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:subsequent rounds of Young Lives, more detailed information on income and expenditure 
19:680:50279:13:14:89:191:476:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:should be collected.

19:683:50386:14:14:89:525:434:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:the household. However, the two variables included to control for such effects – whether 
19:684:50475:14:13:89:530:420:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:there   is   any   negative   event   (NEGATIVEEVENT)   and   whether   that   event   caused

19:686:50672:14:14:89:525:393:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:result, suggesting that in the face of negative events, families may take measures to shield 
19:687:50764:14:14:89:521:379:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:their  children  from  the  adverse  consequences  of  such  shocks.  While  more  detailed  in-

19:690:51064:13:14:89:526:338:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Table  5.4).  Again,  the  results  are  interesting:  taking  children  out  of  school  to  cope  with  
19:691:51170:14:14:89:525:324:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:economic shocks emerged neither as a first- nor a second-choice coping response. In fact,

19:693:51362:14:13:89:525:296:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Moreover, only a very small proportion of households consider sending their children to

20:743:56472:14:14:89:92:203:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: 
20:744:56472:14:13:89:525:189:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Finally,  we  turn  our  discussion  to  community-level  variables.  We  hypothesised  that  the  
20:745:56571:13:14:89:525:176:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:accessibility of school measured by physical distance to school (SCHDIS3) and financial 
20:746:56659:14:14:89:527:162:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:expenses  (PRIMACOST)  would  increase  the  probability  of  a  child  working.  However,  
20:747:56751:14:14:89:527:148:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:the  estimated  coefficient  of  this  variable  was  not  statistically  significant.  This  may  be  
20:748:56854:14:14:89:527:134:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:largely  attributed  to  the  fact  that  only  1.2  per  cent  of  the  sample  children  had  never  
20:749:56957:14:13:89:528:120:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:attended  school  and  just  3.3  per  cent  did  not  attend  school  the  previous  year.  The  
20:750:57055:13:14:89:525:107:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:proportion of poor households per community had a statistically significant effect on the 
20:751:57145:14:14:89:527:93:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:probability  of  a  child  doing  domestic  chores  but  decreased  the  probability  of  a  child  
20:752:57245:14:0:89:527:79:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:working  outside  the  household.  The  reason  may  be  that  children  in  poorer  communes  
21:753:57342:0:13:89:525:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:may have fewer employment opportunities, and thus the only way they can contribute to 
21:754:57428:13:14:89:424:695:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:the household livelihood is through involvement in domestic chores.  
21:755:57497:14:14:89:92:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: 
21:756:57497:14:14:89:526:667:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:We  also  hypothesised  that  the  presence  of  a  factory  close  to  the  commune  may  induce  
21:757:57596:14:14:89:525:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:children  into  work  (either  in  the  factory  or  in  related  supporting  units),  but  this  variable  
21:758:57704:14:25:89:270:639:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:emerged as statistically insignificant. 
21:759:57744:25:14:89:525:614:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:There are also regional differences with respect to the patterning of child work. Children 
21:760:57835:14:14:89:525:600:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:from Phu Yen and Ben Tre provinces are less likely to be involved in domestic work only 
21:761:57923:14:14:89:524:586:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:(j=2) and more likely to get involved in work both outside and inside the household (j=3). 
21:762:58014:14:14:89:527:572:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Children  from  Lao  Cai  and  Hung  Yen  provinces  are  less  likely  to  sit  idle  than  their

21:764:58204:13:14:89:233:545:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:3 in Table 5.3, Appendix C).

21:767:58246:14:14:89:92:503:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: 
21:768:58246:14:13:89:528:489:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:In  our  analysis  using  Young  Lives  data,  we  did  not  find  a  significant  statistical  
21:769:58342:13:14:89:528:476:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:relationship  between  improving  household  prosperity  and  a  reduction  in  child  work  
21:770:58435:14:14:89:529:462:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:activities.  This  suggests  that  a  threshold  effect  may  be  in  operation  and  that  the  
21:771:58532:14:14:89:526:448:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:improvements  in  household  living  standards  recorded  by  Young  Lives  households  may  
21:772:58625:14:14:89:527:434:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:not  have  been  significant  enough  to  have  a  positive  spillover  impact  on  child  labour.  
21:773:58725:14:13:89:526:420:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Indeed the cross-regional research by Edmonds and Turk (2004) discussed above would 
21:774:58809:13:14:89:527:407:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:suggest  that  this  threshold  is  related  to  an  average  GDP  per  capita.  However,  falling  
21:775:58909:14:14:89:527:393:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:living  standards  increased  the  probability  of  children’s  engagement  in  domestic  and  
21:776:59004:14:14:89:525:379:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:extra-household work. This indicates that social impact analyses of post-WTO accession 
21:777:59091:14:14:89:526:365:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:in  Vietnam  should  pay  careful  attention  to  the  well-being  of  vulnerable  groups  whose  
21:778:59189:14:13:89:525:351:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:livelihoods are likely to be negatively affected by trade-induced shocks, in both the short 
21:779:59281:13:14:89:200:338:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:and the medium term.

22:788:59599:13:14:89:92:665:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: 
22:789:59599:14:14:89:527:651:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Education  is  an  important  investment  in  human  capital  and  endows  children  with  the  
22:790:59695:14:14:89:526:637:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:means  to  improve  their  skills,  knowledge,  health  and  future  real  incomes  (eg,  Becker,  
22:791:59794:14:13:89:524:623:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:1962). Human capital can be broadly defined as ‘an individual’s productive skills, talents, 
22:792:59886:13:14:89:525:610:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:and knowledge’ (Thurow, 1970: 1) and people invest in human capital to benefit from it 
22:793:59973:14:14:89:527:596:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:in  both  monetary  and  non-monetary  terms.  Vietnam  has  a  long  tradition  of  respect  for  
22:794:60072:14:14:89:526:582:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:education  and  its  90  per  cent  literacy  rates  and  school  enrolment  levels  were  among  the  
22:795:60175:14:14:89:525:568:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:highest  in  Southeast  Asia  in  the  1980s  (Swinkels  and  Turk,  2003).  However,  during  the  
22:796:60275:14:13:89:526:554:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:mid-1990s,  school  enrolment  levels  declined,  and  there  were  high  drop-out  rates  in  the  
22:797:60375:13:14:89:525:541:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:final years of primary school.22 Some attribute this falling enrolment and rising drop-out 
22:798:60466:14:14:89:524:527:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:rates to economic reforms which resulted in a shrinking education budget and led to a rise 
22:799:60557:14:14:89:526:513:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:in  private  tuition  (Liu,  2001a;  Hong,  2000).  Vo  and  Trinh  (2004)  point  out  that  budget  
22:800:60659:14:14:89:526:499:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:constraints  are  hindering  improvements  in  the  quality  of  education  and  training  systems  
22:801:60759:14:13:89:525:485:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:in Vietnam. However, recently there has been significant improvement in drop-out rates, 
22:802:60847:13:14:89:525:472:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:which have decreased from 27.7 per cent in 1993 to 12.4 per cent in 2002 (Vo and Trinh, 
22:803:60935:14:14:89:126:458:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:2004).  
22:804:60943:14:14:89:92:444:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: 
22:805:60943:14:14:89:522:430:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:In this section we focus on educational achievement among the Young Lives eight-year-
22:806:61028:14:13:89:525:416:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:old cohort as there is negligible variance in enrolment rates in our sample.23 We look at 
22:807:61118:13:14:89:529:403:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:two  dimensions  of  achievement.  First,  we  examine  the  determinants  of  children’s  
22:808:61209:14:14:89:525:389:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:scholastic achievement as measured by simple reading, writing and numeracy skills tests. 
22:809:61298:14:14:89:526:375:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Second,  we  look  at  an  important  and  idiosyncratic  feature  of  the  Vietnamese  schooling  
22:810:61397:14:14:89:525:361:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:system – private tuition. Investing in private tuition is increasingly common even among 
22:811:61486:14:13:89:526:347:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:poor  households,  as  indicated  in  Table  6.1.  We  believe  that  this  is  a  useful  indicator  of  
22:812:61592:13:26:89:504:334:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:households’ willingness to invest in the human capital development of their children.  
22:813:61679:26:14:89:529:308:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:We  also  assume  that  the  impacts  of  trade  liberalisation  on  child  welfare  will  be  
22:814:61774:14:14:89:526:294:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:channelled  through  household-  and/or  community-level  variables.  If  trade  liberalisation  
22:815:61871:14:14:89:526:280:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:leads  to  income  growth  and  increased  fiscal  spending  on  educational  facilities,  then  we  
22:816:61972:14:13:89:527:266:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:expect  positive  impacts  on  child  well-being.  In  addition,  we  also  address  the  question  
22:817:62072:13:14:89:527:253:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:raised  in  the  previous  section  as  to  whether  child  labour  has  adverse  consequences  on  
22:818:62172:14:14:89:528:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:other  dimensions  of  children  well-being,  namely  educational  attainment  and  school

22:823:62307:14:14:89:525:164:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Economic  literature  that  models  educational  achievement  is  embedded  in  human  capital  
22:824:62403:14:14:89:526:150:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:theory  and  the  household  production  model  first  introduced  by  Becker  (1962)  and  later  
22:825:62502:14:14:89:525:136:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:developed  further  by  Leibowitz  (1974),  Becker  and  Tomes  (1979,  1986)  and  Hanushek  
22:826:62596:14:13:89:525:122:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:(1979, 1986). The educational production function has become the main construct of the 
22:827:62683:13:14:89:526:109:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:empirical  literature  to  identify  the  relative  importance  of  measurable  educational  inputs.  
22:828:62785:14:0:89:524:95:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Analogous to factory production, this framework relates contemporaneous child cognitive 
23:829:62875:0:13:89:526:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:attainment  with  educational  inputs  from  within  the  family  and  school.  To  facilitate  our  
23:830:62976:13:14:89:405:695:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:discussion, Figure 6.1 represents these factors diagrammatically.  
23:831:63043:14:14:89:92:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: 
23:832:63043:14:14:89:526:667:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:In Becker’s (1962) human capital model, people with different family backgrounds have 
23:833:63129:14:14:89:525:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:different optimal levels of schooling. Family background is considered important because 
23:834:63218:14:13:89:526:639:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:parents  with  more  resources  are  more  able  to  invest  in  their  children.  But  the  question  
23:835:63321:13:14:89:525:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:remains, why do parents invest in their children? This question is addressed in the model 
23:836:63411:14:14:89:525:612:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:of intergenerational transmission of human capital (eg, Becker and Tomes, 1986). Parents 
23:837:63500:14:14:89:526:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:are  assumed  to  care  about  the  lifetime  utility/welfare  of  their  children  and  thus  seek  to  
23:838:63605:14:14:89:527:584:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:influence  their  children’s  human  capital.  If  they  have  sufficient  assets  or  can  borrow  
23:839:63705:14:13:89:526:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:funds  against  their  children’s  future  income,  they  invest  in  the  human  capital  of  each  
23:840:63806:13:14:89:525:557:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:child up to the point where the marginal rate of return on human capital equals the rate of 
23:841:63898:14:14:89:529:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:interest.  However,  because  human  capital  is  poor  collateral  (Becker,  1962)  in  an  
23:842:63991:14:14:89:525:529:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:imperfect capital market, parents cannot borrow as they would wish to finance investment 
23:843:64080:14:14:89:525:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:in the schooling of their children. As a result, human capital investment is constrained by 
23:844:64172:14:13:89:525:501:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:parents’ wealth or income and students from less wealthy families are more likely to drop 
23:845:64262:13:14:89:526:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:out  because  of  greater  financial  constraints.  In  addition,  conceptualising  the  family  as  a  
23:846:64366:14:14:89:525:474:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:production unit, this framework posits that a child’s educational attainment is also subject 
23:847:64459:14:14:89:508:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:to parental decisions on fertility and household willingness to invest in human capital.

23:849:64549:14:13:89:526:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Although investment in human capital models advanced by Becker (1962)[CHANGED]) 
23:850:64628:13:14:89:526:419:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:and  Becker  and  Tomes  (1986)  yield  testable  hypotheses  with  respect  to  the  effects  of  
23:851:64727:14:14:89:525:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:family factors on the decision to invest in children and their scholastic achievement, these 
23:852:64819:14:14:89:525:391:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:models  offer  little  empirical  guidance.  In  this  vein,  Leibowitz’s  model  (1974)  of  human  
23:853:64920:14:14:89:525:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:capital production (see Figure 6.1) provides an operational way to investigate educational 
23:854:65011:14:13:89:525:363:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:achievement. In this model, parents’ genetic endowments are passed on to their children, 
23:855:65099:13:14:89:525:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:and in turn partly determine children’s abilities. Parental education and ability influences 
23:856:65192:14:14:89:525:336:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:family income levels and the quality and quantity of both time and goods invested in their 
23:857:65283:14:14:89:526:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:offspring.  This  is  termed  ‘home  investment’.  This  model  is  silent,  however,  on  the  role  
23:858:65385:14:13:89:528:308:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:played  by  school-related  factors  in  producing  human  capital  and  thus  we  employ  a  
23:859:65479:13:14:89:528:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:modified  version  to  compensate  for  this  shortcoming.24  The  process  of  augmenting  
23:860:65571:14:14:89:525:281:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:human capital in students also takes place at school. Resources and teachers’ knowledge 
23:861:65659:14:14:89:525:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:and skills are expected to be important in determining the process of augmenting human 
23:862:65746:14:14:89:528:253:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:capital  in  students.  As  illustrated  in  Figure  6.1,  school-related  factors  are  subject  to  
23:863:65848:14:14:89:520:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:parental choice of school, which is influenced by parental ability, education and income.

25:985:69481:13:14:89:525:299:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:These are often used in the modelling of children’s educational attainment. They include 
25:986:69570:14:14:89:525:285:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:gender, age, ethnicity, and birth order. As we use the eight-year-old child dataset, we can 
25:987:69661:14:14:89:525:271:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:only control for gender, birth order and ethnicity and not for age differences. As the effect 
25:988:69755:14:14:89:525:257:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:of gender (MALE) on educational achievement is not unambiguous, it will be determined 
25:989:69841:14:13:89:526:243:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:in  the  empirical  analysis.  As  for  ethnicity  (KIDETHNIC),  the  data  reveals  that  children  
25:990:69942:13:14:89:525:230:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:from the Kinh ethnic group are more likely to receive private tuition than ethnic minority 
25:991:70033:14:14:89:526:216:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:children (52 per cent versus 17.6 per cent). With respect to birth order (ORDER), being 
25:992:70121:14:14:89:527:202:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:an  early-born  child  suggests  that  one  would  have  a  better  chance  of  accessing  fuller

25:994:70308:14:13:89:525:174:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:implication is that elder children would be more likely to attend extra classes and perform

26:1003:70814:13:14:89:525:695:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:We also include a number of covariates in the model to capture the economic background 
26:1004:70901:14:14:89:527:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:of  the  household.  They  include  whether  the  family  own  the  house  they  are  living  in

26:1007:71167:14:13:89:525:639:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:variables to be positively related to a child receiving private tuition and performing better

26:1017:71773:14:13:89:527:501:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:assumption  is  that  there  is  a  trade-off  between  child  quality  and  quantity  (Becker  and

26:1019:71964:14:14:89:527:474:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:analysis  we  control  not  only  for  the  number  of  siblings  (NUMSIB)  but  also  for  the  
26:1020:72061:14:14:89:527:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:number  of  boys  (BOYBORN)  and  girls  born  (GRLBORN).  For  family  structure,  we  
26:1021:72149:14:14:89:527:446:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:include  an  indicator  for  female-headed  families  (FEMALEHEAD).  It  is  expected  that  
26:1022:72242:14:13:89:526:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:children from female-headed households will be worse off than children in male-headed

26:1041:73654:14:13:89:526:170:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:tuition.  Distance  to  school  may  also  affect  child  education.  The  farther  the  school  from  
26:1042:73757:13:14:89:525:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:the household the less likely we think children will be receiving extra classes. We control

27:1059:74855:13:14:89:526:557:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Turning  to  the  household  level  variables,  the  results  are  striking.  The  most  significant  
27:1060:74957:14:14:89:527:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:variables  are  related  to  economic  status.  The  variable  WEALTHINDEX  is  statistically  
27:1061:75052:14:14:89:529:529:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:significant  with  a  large  magnitude.  This  indicates  that  household  prosperity  is  an  
27:1062:75147:14:14:89:526:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:important  determinant  of  parents  investing  in  children’s  educational  development.  This  
27:1063:75244:14:13:89:526:501:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:finding  is  consistent  with  findings  reported  by  Behrman  and  Knowles  (1999)  using  the

27:1067:75478:14:14:89:525:446:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:were not statistically significant. Nor were they with the two variables indicating changes 
27:1068:75569:14:13:89:528:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:in  the  living  standards  of  the  family  over  the  previous  three  years  (LIVEUP  and  
27:1069:75663:13:14:89:527:419:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:LIVEDOWN).  Consistent  with  the  findings  on  child  labour,  this  result  suggests  that  
27:1070:75758:14:14:89:468:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:families seek to shield children from the negative effects of economic shocks.

27:1073:75926:14:13:89:525:363:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:significant. This implies that in poor communes, the trend of investing in private tuition is 
27:1074:76020:13:14:89:526:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:weaker.  Other  variables  (distance  to  school  and  the  cost  of  primary  education)  were  not

27:1078:76249:13:14:89:526:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:WORKCHORE).  The  variable  CHORESONLY  is  negative  and  statistically  significant,  
27:1079:76337:14:14:89:527:281:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:indicating  that  the  more  a  child  is  involved  in  domestic  chores,  the  less  likely  she/he  
27:1080:76440:14:14:89:529:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:would  attend  private  tuition  classes.  However,  the  variable  WORKCHORE  is  not  
27:1081:76528:14:14:89:526:253:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:statistically significant, although it has the expected negative sign. In short, this suggests 
27:1082:76622:14:13:89:525:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:that if trade liberalisation results in an increase in child labour (both outside employment

28:1096:77633:14:14:89:526:667:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:statistically  significant.  In  terms  of  family  structure,  the  number  of  siblings  (NUMSIB)  
28:1097:77734:14:14:89:522:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:was negative but statistically insignificant, thus not supporting the quality–quantity trade-
28:1098:77827:14:13:89:528:639:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:off  hypothesis.  The  variables  indicating  a  decreased  living  standard  was  statistically  
28:1099:77925:13:14:89:525:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:significant although the variable indicating increased living standard was not. Perhaps the 
28:1100:78017:14:14:89:530:612:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:single   most   important   determinant   of   child’s   numerical   skill   attainment   was   the

28:1113:78829:14:13:89:526:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:household  work  activities.  However,  surprisingly  the  involvement  of  children  in  labour  
28:1114:78927:13:14:89:522:419:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:and chores was correlated with superior numeracy skills. An explanation for this counter-
28:1115:79016:14:14:89:527:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:intuitive  finding  might  be  that  a  more  able  child  may  be  more  likely  to  be  asked  by  
28:1116:79117:14:14:89:527:391:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:his/her  parents  to  help  with  work  activities  and/or  be  more  likely  to  find  a  job.  The  
28:1117:79219:14:14:89:527:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:argument  here  would  be  that  a  self-selection  process  is  in  operation,  with  more  able  
28:1118:79318:14:13:89:526:363:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:children  juggling  both  work  and  education.  Ideally,  we  should  model  this  self-selection

28:1120:79507:14:14:89:530:336:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:we   were   unable   to   find   an   appropriate   instrument   for   the   CHORESONLY   and

28:1122:79697:14:13:89:527:308:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:conclusion  here  is  that  we  do  not  find  strong  evidence  that  child  labour  and  domestic  
28:1123:79798:13:14:89:480:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:chores have a negative impact on the development of children’s numeracy skills.

28:1127:80070:14:13:89:528:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:results  for  three  specifications.  The  first  specification  does  not  include  indicators  for

28:1129:80269:14:14:89:526:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:estimated results, there were no significant gender differences in writing skills, but Kinh 
28:1130:80361:14:14:89:528:198:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:children  performed  better  than  ethnic  minority  children.  Later  birth  order  was  also  
28:1131:80457:14:14:89:525:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:correlated with superior writing skills, perhaps because these children are being helped by 
28:1132:80549:14:13:89:525:170:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:their older brothers or sisters. Parental schooling – both paternal and maternal – was also

28:1134:80737:14:14:89:526:143:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:evidence,  however,  of  a  trade-off  between  quantity  and  quality  –  that  is,  the  number  of  
28:1135:80840:14:14:89:526:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:children  per  family  was  statistically  insignificant.  Nevertheless,  the  estimated  effects  of

28:1137:81043:14:0:89:526:101:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:significant.  In  terms  of  household  economics,  the  single  most  important  was  again  the

29:1144:81553:13:14:89:531:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:be correlated with greater parental investment in their children’s educational development.

29:1154:82312:13:14:89:528:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:performed equally well but Kinh children outperformed their ethnic minority counterparts. 
29:1155:82402:14:14:89:525:474:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Maternal education was found to be important in positively influencing children’s reading 
29:1156:82491:14:14:89:528:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:skills.  The  wealth  index  was  again  significant,  but  the  variable  indicating  perceived  
29:1157:82589:14:14:89:526:446:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:changes in household wealth were not.28 Negative events counter-intuitively emerged as 
29:1158:82675:14:13:89:525:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:positive and significant and we are unable to offer an explanation for this, but economic

29:1160:82865:14:14:89:527:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:significant.  This  result  suggests  that  economic  shocks  may  have  a  negative  spillover

29:1164:83086:13:14:89:526:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:But in specification 3, no statistically significant correlation with child work was found,

29:1168:83281:13:14:89:92:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: 
29:1169:83281:14:14:89:525:281:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:In general the estimated results are consistent with the empirical literature on educational 
29:1170:83374:14:14:89:528:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:attainment,  which  argues  that  individual  and  family  background  variables  constitute  
29:1171:83468:14:14:89:528:253:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:important  determinants  of  a  child’s  educational  attainment.  Importantly,  the  variable  
29:1172:83564:14:13:89:525:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:LIVEDOWN was found to have a negative impact on children’s educational attainment. 
29:1173:83647:13:14:89:526:226:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Thus,  if  trade  liberalisation  results  in  a  negative  downturn  for  some  households,  Young

29:1175:83851:14:14:89:522:198:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:accumulation. Surprisingly, however, variables related to children’s involvement in extra-
29:1176:83941:14:14:89:522:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:household and domestic work activities were either not statistically significant for eight-

29:1181:84131:13:14:89:175:113:144:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f7:C:7.1 Introduction 
29:1182:84148:14:0:89:92:99:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B: 
30:1183:84150:0:13:89:527:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Trade  liberalisation  and  market  openness  are  expected  to  bring  about  improved  life  
30:1184:84245:13:14:89:528:695:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:quality  through  increased  income,  greater  employment  opportunities,  better  choice  of  
30:1185:84340:14:14:89:529:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:goods  and  services,  including  healthcare,  through  greater  market  opportunities  and  
30:1186:84433:14:14:89:525:667:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:competition. But trade liberalisation may also have painful consequences for some groups 
30:1187:84522:14:14:89:525:653:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:of  the  population.  On  the  one  hand,  greater  openness  to  the  international  economy  may  
30:1188:84622:14:13:89:526:639:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:lead  to  an  increase  in  public  demand  for  government  safety  nets,  and  children’s  health  
30:1189:84723:13:14:89:528:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:status may benefit from this if these government safety nets are targeted at health (Rodrik, 
30:1190:84816:14:14:89:525:612:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:1999). Higher economic growth might also increase the government’s tax revenue, which 
30:1191:84902:14:14:89:525:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:could facilitate an increase in spending on children’s health. On the other hand, however, 
30:1192:84993:14:14:89:528:584:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:trade  liberalisation  might  affect  children’s  health  by  influencing  the  degree  to  which  
30:1193:85092:14:13:89:525:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:governments are willing and able to fund public health. Before Doi Moi, district hospitals 
30:1194:85183:13:14:89:526:557:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:and  commune-level  health  centres  provided  medical  services  and  essential  drugs  free  of  
30:1195:85282:14:14:89:528:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:charge.  However,  as  a  consequence  of  liberalisation  of  the  health  sector  (with  the  
30:1196:85378:14:14:89:525:529:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:emergence of private hospitals and clinics) and a decrease in government budget support, 
30:1197:85467:14:14:89:526:515:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:the public health system deteriorated because of the exodus of thousands of doctors and 
30:1198:85555:14:13:89:525:501:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:health workers. By 1991, commune-level health centres were not working (Hong, 2000). 
30:1199:85640:13:14:89:525:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:According to the World Bank, ‘the shortage of funds to the health centre is so acute; it is 
30:1200:85732:14:14:89:525:474:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:unclear where the grassroots facilities are going to find the inputs to continue functioning 
30:1201:85825:14:14:89:525:460:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:in the future’ (cited in Hong, 2000).30 However, the situation has improved thanks to the 
30:1202:85915:14:14:89:526:446:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:sustained GDP growth rate at over seven per cent and the new State Budget Law which 
30:1203:85999:14:13:89:527:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:was  passed  in  2004.  According  to  Tran  (2005),  the  government  has  given  priority  to  
30:1204:86096:13:14:89:528:419:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:improving  the  rural  healthcare  system.  Official  statistics  show  that  Vietnam  spends  
30:1205:86191:14:14:89:525:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:around five to six per cent of GDP on health expenditure. The share of government health 
30:1206:86280:14:14:89:493:391:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:spending at the local level (provincial and below) has also increased (Adam, 2005).

30:1210:86398:14:14:89:527:336:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Various  measures  of  children’s  health  status  have  been  used  in  the  literature  including  
30:1211:86499:14:14:89:526:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:children’s  survival  rate  (Wagstaff  and  Nguyen,  2002)  or  anthropometry  (height  for  age  
30:1212:86597:14:13:89:525:308:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:and weight for age). The Young Lives survey has a measure of acute illness (ie, incidence 
30:1213:86687:13:14:89:525:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:of illness in the last two weeks). To model the health of a child, which is unobserved, we 
30:1214:86778:14:14:89:527:281:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:adopt  a  latent  variable  framework,31  which  can  be  considered  as  consistent  with  the  
30:1215:86875:14:14:89:525:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:literature on health production function. A child’s health can be seen as a stock of human 
30:1216:86966:14:14:89:526:253:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:capital,  which  at  any  point  in  time  can  be  determined  by  initial  genetic  endowment  and  
30:1217:87068:14:13:89:527:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:subsequent  investment.  A  change  in  a  child’s  health  status  is  determined  through  a  
30:1218:87164:13:14:89:355:226:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:production function which converts inputs into health.

30:1225:87470:14:14:89:525:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:In Vietnam there is some preference towards boys, thus we expect boys to be more likely 
30:1226:87558:14:14:89:526:115:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:to  receive  more  attention  and  investment  from  parents,  resulting  in  better  health  status.  
30:1227:87661:14:13:89:525:101:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Differences between ethnic groups are left for the empirical exercise, although we expect 
30:1228:87751:13:0:89:527:88:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Kinh  children  to  be  more  likely  to  have  better  health  status  because  of  having  greater

31:1230:87948:13:14:89:527:695:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:born  child  would  mean  having  better  chances  of  accessing  full  parental  attention  and  
31:1231:88046:14:14:89:330:681:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:household resources without sharing with others.

31:1234:88126:14:13:89:525:639:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Literature on the determinants of health suggests that there is a strong correlation between 
31:1235:88219:13:14:89:525:626:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:income and health (eg,Deaton 2006). In our analysis, we expect family income to have a 
31:1236:88306:14:14:89:527:612:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:strong  influence  on  children’s  health.  Better-off  families  (proxied  by  the  Young  Lives  
31:1237:88405:14:14:89:527:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:wealth  index)  would  have  more  resources  to  invest  in  their  children,  in  terms  of  food,  
31:1238:88507:14:14:89:527:584:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:nutrition  intake  and  better  access  to  health  facilities.  As  in  previous  chapters,  we  also  
31:1239:88611:14:13:89:526:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:include  a  number  of  covariates  in  the  model  to  capture  a  household’s  economic  status,  
31:1240:88711:13:14:89:525:557:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:including whether the family owns the house they are living in, owns land, is in debt, and 
31:1241:88802:14:14:89:525:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:the number of rooms in the house. We expect these variables to be positively related to a

31:1245:89018:13:14:89:525:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:parents may be able to transform a given bundle of resources into higher levels of health 
31:1246:89108:14:14:89:179:474:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:for their children.

31:1248:89129:14:14:89:526:446:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:In our empirical analysis we control for the number of siblings as well as the number of 
31:1249:89218:14:13:89:524:432:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:boys and girls per family. For family structure, we include an indicator for female-headed 
31:1250:89309:13:14:89:527:419:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:households.  Due  to  the  feminisation  of  poverty,  we  hypothesise  that  children’s  health

31:1252:89506:14:14:89:525:391:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:households. Lastly, we also assume that the effects of trade liberalisation on child health 
31:1253:89598:14:14:89:528:377:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:will  be  mediated  by  changes  in  household-level  variables  and  we  include  variables

31:1257:89772:14:14:89:526:322:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:A number of community and macro-level variables are used in our model. They include 
31:1258:89855:14:13:89:528:308:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:the  proportion  of  poor  families  per  commune,  the  number  of  pharmacies  within  the  
31:1259:89949:13:14:89:525:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:neighbourhood and distance to health facilities. As discussed above, market reforms have 
31:1260:90038:14:14:89:525:281:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:led to a depletion of public health facilities, particularly at the commune level. This may 
31:1261:90130:14:14:89:527:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:have  serious  consequences  for  local  inhabitants  and  children.  In  order  to  capture  the  
31:1262:90229:14:14:89:527:253:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:effects  of  access  to  health  facilities  we  create  a  series  of  dummy  variables:  access  to  
31:1263:90332:14:13:89:528:239:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:public  hospitals  (HELDIS1),  access  to  private  hospitals  (HELDIS2),  access  to  local

31:1267:90594:14:14:89:527:184:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Child  labour  causes  widespread  concern  because  of  the  potential  damaging  effects  on  
31:1268:90690:14:13:89:525:170:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:health. However, there is a paucity of empirical literature on the effects of child labour on 
31:1269:90784:13:14:89:526:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:health (O’Donnell et al., 2003). As Edmonds (2005a) and O’Donnell et al. (2003) argue, 
31:1270:90871:14:14:89:525:143:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:the majority of child labour takes the form of farm work or domestic chores, rather than 
31:1271:90960:14:14:89:527:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:involvement  in  hazardous  work.  However,  the  effect  of  child  labour  on  health  is  not  
31:1272:91058:14:14:89:525:115:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:unambiguous.  On  the  one  hand,  involvement  in  any  type  of  labour  implies  some  toll  on  
31:1273:91158:14:13:89:526:101:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:young  bodies,  eg,  contact  with  harmful  fertilisers  and  pesticides  in  agricultural  labour,  
31:1274:91260:13:0:89:526:88:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:which may have a negative impact on health. On the other hand, child work may ensure 
32:1275:91346:0:13:89:524:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:physical fitness and mitigate against a sedentary lifestyle. To explore the potential impact 
32:1276:91439:13:14:89:533:695:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:of    child    labour    on    health,    we    include    two    variables,    WORKCHORES    and

32:1282:91705:14:14:89:525:612:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Specification 1 serves as the base model, which does not include indicators for access to 
32:1283:91795:14:14:89:526:598:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:health  facilities  and  children’s  involvement  in  labour  and  domestic  chores.  The  results  
32:1284:91895:14:14:89:525:584:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:from these three models are quite similar. Kinh children are found to be more likely to be 
32:1285:91986:14:13:89:526:570:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:ill.32 Birth order and the number of siblings are found to be statistically insignificant, ie, 
32:1286:92081:13:14:89:525:557:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:having no influence on the probability of children falling ill. At the family level, parental 
32:1287:92175:14:14:89:525:543:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:education – especially maternal education – is found to be important for a child’s health, 
32:1288:92266:14:14:89:475:529:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:suggesting that the caring practices of better-educated parents may be superior.

32:1292:92540:14:14:89:529:474:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:However,   only   the   number   of   rooms   was   found   to   be   a   statistically   significant

32:1294:92733:14:14:89:492:446:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:standards over time were not statistically significant and nor was the wealth index.

32:1296:92819:13:14:89:526:419:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:The estimation results indicate that a child’s involvement in labour and domestic chores 
32:1297:92908:14:14:89:528:405:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:does  not  increase  the  probability  of  falling  ill. Our  finding  is  consistent  with  that  of

32:1304:93421:14:13:89:527:308:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:plays  an  important  role  in  children’s  health.  This  is  also  consistent  with  findings  by  
32:1305:93522:13:14:89:525:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:Wagstaff  and  Nguyen  (2002)  on  the  importance  of  health  service  coverage  on  a  child’s  
32:1306:93621:14:14:89:526:281:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:survival.  The  implication  of  this  finding  is  that  if  trade  liberalisation  leads  to  decreased  
32:1307:93728:14:14:89:527:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:coverage  of  commune  health  centres,  owing  to  declining  tariff  revenues  and  increased

33:1333:95560:14:13:89:527:485:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:exercise  serves  to  highlight  some  important  policy  challenges.  In  light  of  Vietnam’s  
33:1334:95657:13:14:89:526:472:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:recent  accession  to  the  WTO  in  November  2006,  we  would  argue  that  it  is  critical  for  
33:1335:95758:14:14:89:526:458:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:policy-makers  and  advocates  for  vulnerable  groups  –  including  children  and  youth  –  to

33:1337:95959:14:14:89:526:430:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:body of international empirical evidence suggests that it will be particularly important to 
33:1338:96051:14:13:89:529:416:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:consider  the  introduction  of  complementary  social  policies  in  order  to  mitigate  the

33:1346:96705:14:14:89:526:306:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:economic reforms and will be most in need of social protection measures. More specific 
33:1347:96791:14:14:89:285:292:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B:findings can be summarised as follows:

58:2437:168147:21:16:90:488:498:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:3 Senapaty (2003) argues that the relationship between gender and trade liberalisation is a two-way 
58:2438:168246:16:11:89:514:482:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:relationship: (i) trade liberalisation brings different costs and benefits to men and women, and this gender 
58:2439:168355:11:12:89:522:471:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:bias cuts across all economic and social categories; and (ii) the impact of trade liberalisation is mediated by 
58:2440:168467:12:11:89:502:459:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:gender relations and gendered social, economic and political structures. These structures may be in the 
58:2441:168571:11:12:89:503:448:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:form of gender gaps in education and health; patterns of labour market discrimination and labour force 
58:2442:168673:12:21:89:470:436:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:participation levels; gendered patterns of rights and resources; and other socio-cultural factors. 
58:2443:168772:21:16:90:512:415:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:4 Ideally we should also pay attention to the potential impacts of trade liberalisation on women in light of 
58:2444:168881:16:11:89:520:399:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:their role as the primary caregivers in the large majority of Vietnamese households (Tuan et al., 2003). We 
58:2445:168989:11:12:89:505:388:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:would hypothesise that changes in women’s access to labour markets and their time allocation between 
58:2446:169090:12:11:89:516:376:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:productive and social reproductive activities are likely to have an important spillover impact on child well-
58:2447:169199:11:21:89:431:365:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:being. However, data limitations preclude us from exploring this route in any depth.  
58:2448:169285:21:16:90:477:344:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:5 The 2006 World Development Report found that 0–14 year olds comprised 30.3 per cent of the 
58:2449:169378:16:12:90:517:328:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:Vietnamese population. If we were also to include 15–17-year-olds in line with the UN Convention on the

58:2451:169588:11:21:90:236:305:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:be higher still (World Bank, 2006).

58:2455:169786:16:12:90:382:245:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:liberalisation takes place in tandem with other macro-economic reforms.

58:2457:169858:7:16:90:411:226:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:8 Analyses of the gendered dimensions of trade have highlighted the following:  
58:2458:169938:16:11:108:511:210:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:a) although trade liberalisation often results in better earning opportunities for women – especially 
58:2459:170039:11:12:126:515:199:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:factory jobs in export-oriented sectors, as exemplified by the maquilladora sector in Mexico and 
58:2460:170136:12:11:126:502:187:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:women’s entry into export-free-zones in East Asia – these jobs tend to be at the bottom of the 
58:2461:170231:11:12:126:368:176:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:international labour chain and are often highly exploitative;  
58:2462:170294:12:11:108:496:164:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:b) owing in part to women’s domestic responsibilities (and pressures to enter and exit from the 
58:2463:170389:11:12:126:524:153:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:labour market more frequently) as well as lower investment in female education and human capital 
58:2464:170486:12:11:126:516:141:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:in many developing countries, women tend to have unequal access to labour markets, which puts 
58:2465:170580:11:12:126:508:130:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:them at a disadvantage in the context of liberalisation. This includes women’s disproportionate 
58:2466:170676:12:11:126:518:118:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:positioning in the informal sector, further excluding them from the benefits of new labour market 
58:2467:170774:11:12:126:276:107:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:opportunities (eg, Sweetman, 2004).

59:2470:170957:7:16:90:515:701:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:9 Four groups of special goods were excepted from this reform: goods traded by quotas, prohibited goods, 
59:2471:171062:16:7:89:430:685:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:goods under government management and goods under line ministry’s management. 
59:2472:171140:7:16:90:507:678:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:10 However, not surprisingly, like many other countries Vietnam maintains import prohibitions on items 
59:2473:171243:16:12:90:519:662:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:such as arms and ammunition, explosive materials, military equipment, narcotics and toxic chemicals. The 
59:2474:171348:12:11:90:437:650:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:import prohibitions are based on health, national defence and social security concerns.

59:2485:171961:25:16:90:523:501:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:15 More comprehensive measures of child poverty, including indicators of children’s psycho-social welfare, 
59:2486:172068:16:12:90:506:485:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:cognitive development and children’s own perceptions of well-being, could not be included, because of 
59:2487:172170:12:21:90:159:473:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:data limitations.  
59:2488:172189:21:16:90:497:452:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:16 Although designed as a longitudinal study, the Young Lives project has only had one round of data 
59:2489:172290:16:11:90:516:436:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:collection to date and thus is only able to provide a snapshot of the manifestations of childhood poverty at 
59:2490:172399:11:12:90:126:425:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:present.

59:2492:172409:7:16:90:516:406:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:17 By International Labour Organisation (ILO) standards of child labour, the eight-year-old children in the 
59:2493:172517:16:11:90:512:390:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:Young Lives Vietnam data are quite ‘young’. Although we have data on older children’s work activities, 
59:2494:172620:11:12:90:512:379:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:we have no data on their involvement in household chores, so we have not included them in the analysis. 
59:2495:172724:12:11:90:508:367:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:Interestingly, however, we found that there was not a significant difference in the hours worked in extra-
59:2496:172830:11:12:90:390:356:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:household activities between older children and the eight-year-old cohort.  
59:2497:172905:12:7:90:93:344:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F: 
59:2498:172905:7:16:90:504:337:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:18 Originally we intended to analyse the work–school combination of these children. However, the data 
59:2499:173007:16:11:90:514:321:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:shows that a very small and insignificant proportion of children does not go to school (98.5 per cent go to 
59:2500:173115:11:12:90:508:310:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:school, 0.3 per cent do not go to school and 1.2 per cent do not answer this question). Therefore it is not 
59:2501:173223:12:25:90:497:298:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:worthwhile to explore the work–school combination. Rather we look at the work–chore combination. 
59:2502:173320:25:16:90:509:273:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:19 If trade liberalisation leads to an increase in outputs and income, and the GDP variable at the province 
59:2503:173428:16:11:90:527:257:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:level affects child labour, then we may say that there is a link between trade liberalisation and child welfare. 
59:2504:173541:11:12:90:506:246:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:However, when we included this variable in the model, it always dropped out automatically by STATA 
59:2505:173640:12:11:90:509:234:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:(STATA8 SE). We therefore suspect that this variable is highly correlated with the dummy variables for 
59:2506:173743:11:12:90:304:223:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:provinces and resulted in a multicolinearity problem.

59:2508:173797:7:16:90:506:204:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:20 Given that Young Lives specifically targets poorer households/districts, this may add to the threshold 
59:2509:173903:16:11:90:518:188:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:effects. Edmonds (2005b) reports that improved household income during 1992–98 explained up to 80 per 
59:2510:174004:11:12:90:323:177:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:cent of the decline in child labour during the same period.

59:2512:174064:7:16:90:406:158:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:21 The comparison category is living standards which have remained the same.

60:2521:174640:0:16:90:504:701:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:23 In Vietnam school attendance is compulsory in primary school, as is reflected by the 98.9 per cent of 
60:2522:174745:16:11:90:417:685:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:children enrolled in our sample, despite Young Live’s over-sampling of the poor.

60:2524:174826:7:17:90:512:667:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:24 Most empirical studies to date have estimated the education production model either by using ordinary 
60:2525:174931:17:11:90:514:650:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:least squares (OLS) or ordinal logit/probit models, depending on the nature of data available, regressing a

60:2527:175142:11:12:90:486:628:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:value-added model suggested by Hanusheck (1979) is frequently estimated, in which a measure of 
60:2528:175237:12:11:90:505:616:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:educational attainment is regressed on previous attainment in addition to various explanatory variables.

60:2530:175342:7:16:90:514:598:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:25 In Vietnam the most common form of private tuition is the extra classes run by schoolteachers for their 
60:2531:175449:16:12:89:512:582:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:students. As primary education is compulsory in Vietnam, we believe that attending extra classes may be 
60:2532:175553:12:25:89:269:570:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:an investment in human capital for students. 
60:2533:175598:25:18:90:524:545:42:g_d0_f7:100:g_d0_f6:F:26 Such a model is built around a latent variable model that assumes some underlying and unobserved latent

60:2536:175744:0:16:277:526:527:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:.  While  we  do  not  observe  the  latent  variable  y,  we  do  
60:2537:175811:16:14:90:525:511:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:observe  a  binary  outcome  y  such  that  =y0*>y0=y if  and   otherwise.  Defining  the  latent  variable  
60:2538:175920:14:14:90:222:497:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:equation in linear form, we have

60:2541:175964:7:16:90:514:461:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:27 However, as Tran et al. (2006) found, involvement in private tuition was linked to superior educational 
60:2542:176071:16:12:90:413:445:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:skills development only in terms of reading and not for mathematics or writing.

60:2544:176152:7:16:90:450:426:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:28 This, however, could be due to the fact that there was insufficient variation in the data.

60:2549:176390:7:16:90:517:369:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:30 Trade liberalisation might also affect children’s health by affecting environmental quality. For example, 
60:2550:176499:16:12:90:507:353:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:increased industrialisation may lead to increased air and water pollution which directly affect children’s 
60:2551:176606:12:11:90:472:341:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:health. However, owing to data limitations we do not consider these dimensions in this paper.   
60:2552:176702:11:7:90:93:330:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F: 
60:2553:176702:7:19:90:276:323:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:31 We adopt a latent variable model whereby:

60:2555:176766:15:12:90:486:289:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:where y* is the unobserved health status of  child i, x is a vector of covariates which we believe to 
60:2556:176867:12:11:90:397:277:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:influence y*. Instead of observing the latent variable, we observe in the data

60:2559:177020:11:12:90:498:243:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:As before, we estimate a binary logit model and report the marginal effects for ease of interpretation.

60:2561:177125:7:16:90:518:224:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:32 This result may seem counter-intuitive but it could be partly due to greater awareness of and willingness 
60:2562:177234:16:11:89:412:208:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:F:to report ill health among Kinh rather than families from minority ethnic groups
