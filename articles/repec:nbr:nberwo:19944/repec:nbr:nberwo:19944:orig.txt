2:34:1897:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:We study the effect of outdoor air pollution on the productivity of indoor workers at a pear-packing
2:35:1997:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:factory. We focus on fine particulate matter (PM2.5), a harmful pollutant that easily penetrates indoor
2:36:2100:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:settings. We find that an increase in PM2.5 outdoors leads to a statistically and economically significant
2:37:2206:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:decrease in packing speeds inside the factory, with effects arising at levels well below current air quality
2:38:2314:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:standards. In contrast, we find little effect of PM2.5 on hours worked or the decision to work, and
2:39:2413:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:little effect of pollutants that do not travel indoors, such as ozone. This effect of outdoor pollution
2:40:2516:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:on the productivity of indoor workers suggests a thus far overlooked consequence of pollution. Back-
2:41:2616:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:of-the-envelope calculations suggest that nationwide reductions in PM2.5 from 1999 to 2008 generated
2:42:2716:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:$19.5 billion in labor cost savings, which is roughly one-third of the total welfare benefits associated
2:43:2820:14:42:72:154:462:12:Times:12:Times:with this change.

3:71:3432:0:50:72:188:689:15:g_d0_f1:15:g_d0_f1:1. INTRODUCTION 
3:72:3446:50:27:72:543:639:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Firms commit sizable resources to a wide range of activities aimed at increasing worker productivity, 
3:73:3548:27:27:72:539:612:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:with U.S. workplace training alone accounting for $62 billion in 2012 (O’Leonard, 2013). According-
3:74:3645:27:27:72:543:585:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ly, researchers  have examined  the  effect  of various activities designed  to  increase employee  effort 
3:75:3750:27:27:72:539:558:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and output, ranging from ergonomics and workspace design to payment contracts and telecommut-
3:76:3841:27:27:72:543:531:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ing (Lazear, 2000; Bloom et al., 2013; Bandiera et al., 2005; Pilcher et al., 2002; Levitt and List, 2011). 
3:77:3947:27:27:72:542:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:One  area  that  has  received  surprisingly  little  attention  by both firms and researchers  is  pollution 
3:78:4057:27:27:72:540:477:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:within the workplace. Yet, there is ample reason to believe that modest levels of pollution may im-
3:79:4155:27:27:72:542:450:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:pair performance through changes in respiratory, cardiovascular, and cognitive function. Moreover, 
3:80:4253:27:27:72:542:423:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:since pollution is largely generated well outside the boundaries of the individual firm, the degree to 
3:81:4354:27:27:72:542:396:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:which  firms  can  internalize  pollution-related  costs  is  limited.  This underscores  the  importance  of 
3:82:4463:27:27:72:289:369:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:public policy in shaping outcomes in this area. 
3:83:4510:27:27:108:540:342:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:In this paper, we present the first evidence on the impacts of outdoor pollution on the mar-
3:84:4602:27:27:72:543:315:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ginal productivity of indoor workers. This focus is important for two reasons. First, the majority of 
3:85:4701:27:27:72:539:288:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:output among the richest nations is produced in indoor settings, with manufacturing alone account-
3:86:4798:27:27:72:543:261:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ing for roughly 10–25 percent of GDP.1 Previous evidence on the effect of pollution on the marginal 
3:87:4894:27:27:72:542:234:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:product of  labor  has  been  limited  to  the  agricultural  sector  (Graff  Zivin  and  Neidell,  2012),  which 
3:88:5007:27:27:72:539:207:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:accounts for a small fraction of national income and thus provides limited guidance for policy mak-
3:89:5105:27:27:72:539:180:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ing in the developed world where the institutional capacity for regulating the environment is strong-

3:92:5258:10:11:72:265:110:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:1 Estimates are from http://data.worldbank.org/. 
3:93:5305:11:14:72:530:99:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:2 There is also a small literature that examines productivity indirectly through a focus on the extensive margin of labor 
3:94:5426:14:11:72:521:85:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:supply. See Ostro, 1983; Hausman et al., 1984; Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2014; Carson et al., 2010; Hanna and Oliva, 
3:95:5541:11:0:72:94:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:2011. 
4:96:5547:0:27:108:543:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Second, the pollutant we examine, fine particulate matter (PM2.5), has unique properties that 
4:97:5641:27:27:72:540:682:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:make it an especially important pollutant to study. The miniscule size of PM2.5 – approximately one-
4:98:5738:27:27:72:542:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:thirtieth  the  width  of  a  human  hair – makes  it  particularly  pernicious.  It  is  inhaled  deep  into  the 
4:99:5852:27:27:72:543:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:lungs,  where  it  accumulates  and impairs respiratory function,  and  can  also  enter  the  bloodstream, 
4:100:5960:27:27:72:542:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:where it causes cardiovascular complications. Exposure to high levels of PM2.5 causes severe health 
4:101:6057:27:27:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:events, such as heart attacks and hospitalizations for asthma, but the degree to which modest expo-
4:102:6153:27:27:72:540:547:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:sure to PM2.5 affects  more  subtle  but  still  economically  relevant  outcomes,  like  productivity,  is  un-
4:103:6263:27:27:72:542:520:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:known. Minimizing  such  effects  is  greatly  complicated  by  the  fact  that PM2.5 can easily  penetrate 
4:104:6369:27:27:72:543:493:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:buildings  (Thatcher  and  Layton,  1995;  Ozkaynak  et  al.,  1996;  and  Vette  et  al.,  2001). This implies 
4:105:6479:27:27:72:543:466:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that, unlike many other pollutants, the most common form of ex-post avoidance behavior – going 
4:106:6573:27:27:72:225:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:inside – will be of limited value.  
4:107:6607:27:27:108:542:412:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:We perform our analysis using a unique panel dataset on the daily productivity of employees 
4:108:6699:27:27:72:543:385:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:in a pear-packing  facility  in  Northern  California. The  task  of  packing  pears  is  a tedious one. Each 
4:109:6809:27:27:72:543:358:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:individual  piece  of  fruit  is  wrapped  in  paper  and  then  packed  tightly  to  ensure  that  the  required 
4:110:6923:27:27:72:539:331:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:quantity of pears fits the box. Importantly, workers are paid based on their daily productivity, there-
4:111:7026:27:27:72:542:304:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:by  minimizing  moral  hazard  problems  associated  with  imperfectly  observed  worker  effort  (Lazear, 
4:112:7133:27:27:72:251:277:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:2000; Shi, 2010; Bandiera et al. 2005).  
4:113:7173:27:27:108:543:250:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Our empirical strategy exploits high-frequency fluctuations in ambient PM2.5 concentrations 
4:114:7263:27:27:72:542:223:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:as  measured  by  a  federally  administered PM2.5 monitor  located  near  the  factory. Those  fluctuations 
4:115:7371:27:27:72:540:196:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:are plausibly exogenous since they do not result from the activity of the factory itself, but rather em-
4:116:7473:27:27:72:540:169:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:anate from sources in the hundreds of miles that surround the factory. In addition, there was a mas-
4:117:7571:27:27:72:543:142:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:sive wildfire several hundred miles away that led to elevated PM2.5 levels during one of the packing 
4:118:7670:27:27:72:542:115:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:seasons in  our  data. The  fire,  along  with time-varying transportation  and  economic  patterns  in  the 
4:119:7776:27:0:72:526:88:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:larger cities within the region, generate considerable variation in pollution levels at our study site.  
5:120:7879:0:27:108:543:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Our analysis reveals a statistically significant, negative impact of PM2.5 on the productivity of 
5:121:7973:27:27:72:542:682:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:indoor workers. The negative effect occurs at pollution levels well below current National Ambient 
5:122:8071:27:27:72:542:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). An increase in PM2.5 pollution of 10  micrograms per cubic meter 
5:123:8164:27:27:72:543:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:(μg/m3) reduces the productivity of workers by $0.41 per hour, approximately 6 percent of average 
5:124:8261:27:27:72:539:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:hourly earnings. These effects first arise when PM2.5 exceeds 15 μg/m3 and increase thereafter, sug-
5:125:8359:27:27:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:gesting a potential threshold effect. These findings are robust to numerous specification checks. Im-
5:126:8458:27:27:72:540:547:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:portantly, we find that labor supply does not respond to PM2.5, suggesting our estimates are not con-
5:127:8559:27:27:72:542:520:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:taminated  by  sample selection  bias. Furthermore, we  also  find  that  outdoor  conditions  that  do  not

5:129:8770:27:27:72:136:466:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:productivity.  
5:130:8783:27:27:108:543:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:We gauge the potential economy-wide importance of these productivity effects by applying 
5:131:8869:27:27:72:542:412:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:our  estimates to  all  manufacturing  workers  throughout  the  U.S., the  bulk of  whom  perform  tasks 
5:132:8973:27:27:72:542:385:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:with  similar  physical  demands as those  faced  by  workers  in  our  study. We find  that  reductions  in 
5:133:9081:27:27:72:540:358:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:PM2.5 between 1999 and 2008 generated $19.5 billion in labor cost savings. This value represents ap-
5:134:9176:27:27:72:539:331:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:proximately  one-third of  the  total  estimated  welfare  benefits  associated  with  these  air  quality  im-
5:135:9286:27:27:72:543:304:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:provements  as  captured  by  capitalization  into  housing  prices. If these productivity impacts  are not 
5:136:9392:27:27:72:542:277:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:capitalized into housing prices, as may well be the case given the novelty of these findings and the 
5:137:9493:27:27:72:543:250:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:localized  nature  of  environmental  quality  capitalization  (Bento  et  al.,  2012,  Currie  et  al.,  2013),  our 
5:138:9611:27:27:72:540:223:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:results suggest that traditional methods for welfare assessment may substantially understate the ben-
5:139:9712:27:27:72:312:196:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:efits from improvements in environmental quality.  
5:140:9761:27:27:108:543:169:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The  paper  proceeds  as  follows.  The  subsequent  section describes background  information 
5:141:9856:27:27:72:542:142:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:on PM2.5, including potential mechanisms for a productivity effect. Section 3 describes the data that 
5:142:9957:27:0:72:543:115:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:we use, and Section 4 describes our empirical strategy. Section 5 presents our core results along with 
6:143:10060:0:27:72:543:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:a series of robustness checks. Section 6 explores the implications of our empirical results for the US 
6:144:10163:27:47:72:218:682:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:economy. Section 7 concludes. 
6:145:10191:47:32:72:344:635:15:g_d0_f1:15:g_d0_f1:2. BACKGROUND ON PARTICULATE MATTER  
6:146:10226:32:27:72:543:603:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Particulate matter (PM) consists of solid and liquid particles in the air that can range considerably in 
6:147:10330:27:27:72:542:576:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:size. The regulation of PM has evolved over time. Total Suspended Particulates (TSPs), which were 
6:148:10425:27:27:72:543:549:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:first regulated in 1971, consists of particles less than 100 micrometers in size. In recognition of the 
6:149:10528:27:27:72:542:522:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:growing  evidence  that  only  particles less  than  10  micrometers penetrate  into  the  lungs,  regulations 
6:150:10639:27:27:72:539:495:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:switched from TSPs to PM10 in 1987.3 Further research demonstrated that the smallest of these par-
6:151:10735:27:27:72:542:468:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ticles, those less than 2.5 micrometers, penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream. As a 
6:152:10838:27:27:72:542:441:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:result, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began regulating PM2.5, in addition to PM10, in 
6:153:10933:27:27:72:106:414:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:1997.4  
6:154:10939:27:27:108:543:387:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1: The  sources  of PM2.5 consist  of a  wide  range  of both natural  and  anthropogenic  sources. 
6:155:11035:27:27:72:543:360:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Natural sources include volcanoes and wildfires, while anthropogenic sources are largely the result of 
6:156:11137:27:27:72:540:333:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:fossil fuel combustion, particularly when gases from power plants, industries, and automobiles inter-
6:157:11237:27:27:72:540:306:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:act to form PM2.5. Given its diminutive size, PM2.5 can remain suspended in the air for extended pe-
6:158:11334:27:27:72:291:279:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:riods of time and can travel hundreds of miles. 
6:159:11381:27:27:108:539:252:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Particularly important for our study, PM2.5 can easily enter buildings, with penetration rang-
6:160:11474:27:27:72:543:225:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ing from 70–100 percent (Thatcher and Layton, 1995; Ozkaynak et al., 1996; and Vette et al., 2001). 
6:161:11564:27:27:72:542:198:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This makes PM2.5 hard  to  avoid. Unlike  other  pollutants, which  either  remain  outside  or rapidly 
6:162:11664:27:63:72:540:171:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:break down once indoors, going inside may do little to reduce one’s exposure to PM2.5. This is par-
6:163:11760:63:9:216:219:108:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:                                                 
6:164:11808:9:11:72:419:99:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:3 Particles above 10 micrometers are typically expelled by coughing or are trapped in cilia. 
6:165:11898:11:14:72:530:88:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f3:4 Particulates between 2.5 and 10 micrometers are commonly referred to as “coarse particulates,” while those less than 
6:166:12016:14:0:72:467:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f1:2.5 are referred to as “fine particulates.” The air quality standard for PM2.5 was strengthened in 2006. 
7:167:12121:0:27:72:540:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ticularly the case in a poorly insulated, well-ventilated setting, such as the one we study. Indoor pol-
7:168:12222:27:27:72:373:682:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:lution measures are thus readily affected by outdoor conditions.  
7:169:12285:27:27:108:542:655:12:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f4:A large  body  of  toxicological  and  epidemiological  evidence  suggests that exposure  to PM2.5 
7:170:12382:27:27:72:543:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:harms health (see EPA, 2004 for a comprehensive review). These risks arise primarily from changes 
7:171:12479:27:27:72:542:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:in pulmonary and cardiovascular functioning (Seaton et al., 1995). They may manifest themselves in 
7:172:12576:27:27:72:543:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:respiratory episodes,  such  as  asthma  attacks, and  cardiovascular events,  such  as  heart  attacks, that 
7:173:12684:27:27:72:542:547:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:lead to hospitalizations and mortality (Dockery and Pope, 1994; Pope, 2000). They also lead to more 
7:174:12782:27:27:72:542:520:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:subtle effects,  such  as  changes  in  blood  pressure,  irritation  in  the  ear,  nose,  throat,  and  lungs,  and 
7:175:12900:27:27:72:543:493:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:mild headaches (Pope, 2000; Ghio et al., 2000; Auchincloss et al, 2008). These milder effects, which 
7:176:13001:27:27:72:543:466:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:arise from exposure to lower levels of PM2.5, are generally unobserved by the econometrician – they 
7:177:13098:27:27:72:542:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:typically do not lead to healthcare encounters – and in some cases may be largely unnoticed by the 
7:178:13195:27:27:72:540:412:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:individual experiencing them. Symptoms can arise in as little as a few hours after exposure, particu-
7:179:13295:27:27:72:543:385:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:larly  for  people  with  existing  cardiovascular and  respiratory  conditions,  but PM2.5 can  also generate 
7:180:13405:27:27:72:539:358:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:effects several days after a period of elevated exposure. Particles also accumulate in the lungs, so ef-
7:181:13507:27:27:72:366:331:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:fects may be triggered after several days of elevated exposure.5  
7:182:13571:27:27:108:542:304:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:These changes in health from PM2.5 exposure can lead to changes in labor market outcomes 
7:183:13659:27:27:72:542:277:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:through  two  channels. First,  sickness related  to PM2.5 exposure may  lead  to  absenteeism,  either  by 
7:184:13766:27:27:72:539:250:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:missing work entirely or by reducing the number of hours worked. Any resulting changes in produc-
7:185:13862:27:27:72:543:223:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:tivity would therefore be due to changes in labor supply. Second, workers may suffer from reduced 
7:186:13959:27:27:72:543:196:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:on-the-job  productivity  (i.e., “presenteeism”) due to the negative health effects of PM2.5 exposure. 
7:187:14059:27:27:72:542:169:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:According to worker self-reports, presenteeism decreases U.S. economic output by $27 billion each 
7:188:14157:27:27:72:542:142:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:year (Davis et al. 2005). Moreover, since the health effects of PM2.5 exposure may be so mild as to 
7:189:14254:27:18:72:539:115:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:not even register for the impacted individual, such self-reported measures of presenteeism may un-
7:190:14350:18:9:216:219:97:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:                                                 
7:191:14398:9:14:72:520:88:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:5 Less relevant for our analysis, this accumulation in the lungs may also lead to long-term health effects over several 
7:192:14516:14:0:72:265:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:years, such as chronic bronchitis and lung cancer. 
8:193:14567:0:27:72:540:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:derestimate  the  true on-the-job  productivity effects of  pollution. Since  pear  packing,  like  much  as-
8:194:14674:27:27:72:542:682:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:sembly line work, is a repetitive task that involves standing on one’s feet nearly all day, these subtle 
8:195:14778:27:27:72:543:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:changes can plausibly lead to fatigue and related symptoms, thereby lowering the marginal product 
8:196:14876:27:27:72:543:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of labor. The goal of our analysis is to estimate the effect of PM2.5 on the marginal product of labor, 
8:197:14978:27:47:72:370:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:independent from any possible effects of PM2.5 on labor supply. 
8:198:15039:47:50:72:129:554:15:g_d0_f1:15:g_d0_f1:3. DATA 
8:199:15045:50:27:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:In order to measure the effect of PM2.5 on productivity, we require both precise measures of produc-
8:200:15144:27:27:72:542:477:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:tivity and precise measures of PM2.5. This section describes how we construct a dataset with both of 
8:201:15244:27:27:72:146:450:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:those variables. 
8:202:15260:27:27:108:543:423:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1: In  most  settings, labor productivity,  particularly  at  the  individual  level, is  unobservable  to 
8:203:15363:27:27:72:542:396:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:researchers. By focusing on a firm where workers are paid on a piece rate basis, our setting offers a 
8:204:15465:27:27:72:540:369:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:unique  opportunity  to  measure worker productivity on  a  daily  basis.  We  focus  on  a  large  pear-
8:205:15569:27:27:72:540:342:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:packing  factory  in  northern  California.  The  firm,  which  has since closed,  was  the  largest  pear-
8:206:15676:27:27:72:542:315:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:packing factory in the area. The firm contracted with pear growers throughout Northern California. 
8:207:15773:27:27:72:542:288:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Pears would start arriving at the factory early each morning, well before packers arrive. After being 
8:208:15873:27:27:72:543:261:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:cleaned and passing through a manual quality assurance check, the pears are mechanically sorted by 
8:209:15970:27:27:72:540:234:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:size into large, rotating bins. Packers would then individually wrap each pear in tissue paper and ar-
8:210:16070:27:27:72:483:207:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:range the pears in boxes.6 The boxes would then be sent to retailers around the country. 
8:211:16157:27:27:108:542:180:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1: Packers were expected to work every day that the factory was open and to arrive by 7 AM, at 
8:212:16246:27:56:72:543:153:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the  start  of  the  day  shift. In  general,  packers would  work  until  all  pears brought  in  during  the  day 
8:213:16361:56:9:216:219:97:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:                                                 
8:214:16409:9:14:72:529:88:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:6 The pears need to be individually wrapped in tissue paper, and then arranged in boxes according to specific patterns. 
8:215:16528:14:0:72:505:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:While labor intensive, it allowed the factory to ship the pears across the country without damaging the produce. 
9:216:16641:0:27:72:540:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:had been packed. If the workday lasted longer than 8 hours, then the packers would be paid an over-
9:217:16740:27:27:72:365:682:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:time rate that was 50 percent higher than during regular time.7  
9:218:16802:27:27:108:543:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1: The factory provided us with payroll records for the 2001, 2002, and 2003 packing seasons. 
9:219:16893:27:27:72:542:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The payroll records contain all information that the firm needed in order to calculate paychecks. In 
9:220:16993:27:27:72:542:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f3:particular,  packers  were paid via a “piece-or-hourly” system. The packers earned a piece rate for 
9:221:17092:27:27:72:539:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:each box they packed. If their piece rate earnings for the day implied an hourly wage below Califor-
9:222:17191:27:27:72:540:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f1:nia’s minimum wage, then the packers were paid an hourly rate for the day. Importantly, productivi-
9:223:17290:27:27:72:542:520:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ty is recorded even for those paid minimum wage, thus providing a comprehensive measure of daily 
9:224:17386:27:27:72:539:493:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:productivity for all workers regardless of where they end up on the wage schedule.8 The dataset in-
9:225:17484:27:27:72:539:466:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:cludes measures of regular-time boxes packed, overtime boxes packed, regular-time hours, and over-
9:226:17581:27:27:72:501:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:time hours worked for each packer each day. Those variables compose the bulk of our data. 
9:227:17670:27:27:108:543:412:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1: One complication in  measuring  productivity is  that  the workers  packed  different  kinds  of 
9:228:17767:27:27:72:542:385:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:packages  over  time,  both within  and  across  days.  Most  packages  were standard, four-fifths bushel 
9:229:17872:27:27:72:542:358:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:boxes,  but  occasionally  workers  would  pack  trays  or  plastic  bags  for some retailers.  Packers  were 
9:230:17982:27:27:72:543:331:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:paid a different piece rate for each package, with payroll records indicating the type of boxes packed 
9:231:18083:27:27:72:543:304:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f1:and each packer’s piece earnings for each type of box. Given  the  different  types  of  packaging, we 
9:232:18186:27:27:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:use each packer’s total piece rate earnings per hour as our standardized measure of productivity. Im-
9:233:18283:27:27:72:540:250:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:portantly, the type of box being packed on a given day is uncorrelated with PM2.5, so this standardi-
9:234:18384:27:27:72:542:223:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:zation is unlikely to introduce a bias.9 For those workers paid minimum wage, we use their implied 
9:235:18482:27:43:72:309:196:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:piece rate wage based on their actual productivity.  
9:236:18533:43:9:216:219:153:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:                                                 
9:237:18581:9:14:72:522:144:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:7 Further details on how the factory operated are described by Chang and Gross (2014). Our description here is also 
9:238:18696:14:8:72:274:130:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:based on interviews with the factory’s former CEO. 
9:239:18746:8:14:72:529:122:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:8 Since workers may have an incentive to shirk when facing a fixed hourly wage, we directly test this assumption using 
9:240:18864:14:9:72:537:108:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:the methodology outlined by Graff Zivin and Neidell (2012). As described below, we find no such evidence of shirking. 
9:241:18980:9:14:72:538:99:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:9 We regressed the share of four-fifths boxes packed on a given day on all covariates (described below), and find that a 1 
9:242:19102:14:11:72:539:85:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:unit increase in PM2.5 is associated with a 0.002 decrease in the share of four-fifths boxes, with a t-statistic of 0.52. Using 
9:243:19229:11:0:72:257:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:a fractional logit model yielded identical results. 
10:244:19281:0:27:108:543:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1: Figure  1  plots  the  variation  in  productivity as  measured  by  earnings.10 The  first  panel  plots 
10:245:19385:27:27:72:542:682:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the productivity across workers by taking the mean earnings per hour for each worker. The second 
10:246:19480:27:27:72:540:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:plots the productivity across days by taking the mean earnings of all workers on a given day. Imme-
10:247:19579:27:27:72:542:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:diately evident is that the variation across workers is as large as the variation across days, suggesting 
10:248:19685:27:27:72:524:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:a potentially important role for day-to-day factors, such as pollution, in determining productivity. 
10:249:19784:27:27:108:542:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1: This analysis also requires measures of the environmental shocks faced by the packers. The 
10:250:19875:27:27:72:543:547:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:pear-packing  factory  was  located 2.7  miles from  a  weather  and  pollution  station.  This  monitor  is 
10:251:19983:27:27:72:542:520:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:maintained  by  the  California  Air  Resources Board,  and  is  used  for  determining  compliance  with 
10:252:20089:27:27:72:543:493:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f3:both state and national air quality standards. Based on the station’s records, we compiled data on the 
10:253:20192:27:27:72:543:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f1:area’s rain fall, temperature, wind speed, dew point, and solar radiation. From the pollution station, 
10:254:20294:27:27:72:543:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:we  compiled  data  on  5  pollutants:  fine  particulate  matter  (less  than 2.5 micrometers in  diameter), 
10:255:20403:27:27:72:542:412:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:coarse  particulate  matter  (between  2.5  and  10 micrometers  in  diameter),  ozone,  carbon  monoxide, 
10:256:20509:27:27:72:176:385:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and nitrogen dioxide.  
10:257:20531:27:27:108:542:358:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:While nearly all environmental data were collected at the hourly level during the time period 
10:258:20624:27:27:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of our analysis, particulate matter was only measured every 6 days, thus producing a 6-day daily aver-
10:259:20724:27:27:72:542:304:12:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f4:age  measure.11 This  measure  has  three implications  for  our  analysis.  First,  the  grouping  of PM2.5 
10:260:20831:27:27:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f1:measures can lead to a “Moulton effect” (Moulton, 1986), so we cluster standard errors on each 6-
10:261:20927:27:27:72:542:250:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:day  measure of PM2.5. Second,  this  6-day  measure  means  that  our  measure  of  worker  exposure  is 
10:262:21032:27:27:72:542:223:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:based on time both at work and at home, and both indoors and outside. As previously mentioned, 
10:263:21125:27:27:72:542:196:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:effects from PM2.5 may arise both immediately and over several days. Therefore, it is not possible for 
10:264:21227:27:27:72:543:169:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:us  to  ascertain  which source  and  what  timing  of  exposure over  the  6-day  period can  explain the 
10:265:21334:27:9:216:219:142:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:                                                 
10:266:21382:9:14:72:534:133:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:10 We drop from the sample workers who worked fewer than 14 days. We also drop worker-days with implausibly high 
10:267:21494:14:9:72:333:119:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:earnings values, greater than 3 standard deviations above the mean. 
10:268:21561:9:13:72:531:110:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:11 PM2.5 was commonly measured every 6 days after its initial regulation in 1997, but is now routinely measured on an 
10:269:21678:13:12:72:536:97:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:hourly basis in light of growing evidence of more immediate effects. The 6-day measurement was accomplished by plac-
10:270:21793:12:11:72:539:85:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:ing a filtered unit that only allowed PM2.5 to pass, with the accumulated amount after 6 days then measured and divided 
10:271:21913:11:0:72:370:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:by 6 to give an average daily measure. The same process was used for PM10. 
11:272:21989:0:27:72:543:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:productivity effects we find. Third, while the factory is reasonably close to the monitor, there may be 
11:273:22093:27:27:72:543:682:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:measurement  error  in  our  assignment  of  exposure  to  workers  during  non-work  hours.  If  classical, 
11:274:22202:27:27:72:540:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:this measurement error will bias our estimates down. Table 1 presents summary statistics for the da-
11:275:22301:27:47:72:426:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ta, both at the individual worker level and at the unit of PM2.5 measurement. 
11:276:22377:47:50:72:224:581:15:g_d0_f1:15:g_d0_f1:4. EMPIRICAL STRATEGY 
11:277:22397:50:27:72:543:531:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Our goal is to estimate the effect of fine particulate matter on worker productivity. We estimate the 
11:278:22497:27:27:72:251:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:following hybrid production function: 
11:279:22534:27:28:108:267:477:12:g_d0_f1:7:g_d0_f1: yit = β × (PM2.5)t + Xt 'γ + δt + εit. 
11:280:22564:28:27:72:543:449:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The outcome yit is the measure of hourly productivity denominated in hourly earnings for worker i 
11:281:22658:27:28:72:542:422:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:on date t.12 The covariate PM2.5 is a daily average of particulate matter (based on the 6-day measure), 
11:282:22758:28:27:72:540:394:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and β captures the effect of PM2.5 on earnings. The vector Xt consists of daily wind speed, a quadrat-
11:283:22857:27:28:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ic function  of temperature,  dew  point,  rain,  solar  radiation,  and  ozone to  account  for  other  envi-
11:284:22966:28:27:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ronmental factors that may affect productivity. 13 The fixed effects, δ, include day-of-week and year-
11:285:23065:27:28:72:542:312:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:month indicator variables  to  account  for  trends  within  the  week  and  over  time,  respectively. Since 
11:286:23175:28:27:72:542:284:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the error term, ε, likely exhibits auto-correlation between observations based on the same worker or 
11:287:23274:27:27:72:542:257:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:same 6-day PM2.5 measurement period, we allow for two-way clustering (Cameron et al., 2011) along 
11:288:23369:27:28:72:161:230:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:those dimensions.  
11:289:23387:28:28:108:539:202:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:We face two main obstacles in estimating β. First, our goal is to estimate the effect of pollu-
11:290:23479:28:27:72:540:174:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:tion on the marginal product of labor, so we need to isolate changes in productivity that are not con-
11:291:23580:27:39:72:543:147:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:taminated  by  changes  in  labor  supply.  If  hours  worked  responds to  changes  in  pollution,  then  any 
11:292:23690:39:9:216:219:108:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:                                                 
11:293:23738:9:14:72:536:99:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:12 As noted earlier, for those who fall under the minimum wage portion of the wage schedule, our productivity measure 
11:294:23855:14:8:72:351:85:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f1:corresponds to the earnings implied by the worker’s actual packing rate. 
11:295:23927:8:0:72:370:77:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:13 Below, we also include controls for other pollutants as a robustness check. 
12:296:24006:0:27:72:542:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:estimated effects of pollution on productivity could suffer from sample selection bias. In particular, 
12:297:24107:27:27:72:542:682:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:we want  to  separate  the  direct  effects  of  pollution  from  workers decision  to  work  and their shift 
12:298:24216:27:27:72:540:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:length. To limit this concern, we focus our analysis on the productivity of workers during the regu-
12:299:24314:27:27:72:542:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:lar-time day shift. Overtime  hours  are  more  discretionary  and  can,  in  fact,  depend  directly  on 
12:300:24418:27:27:72:540:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:productivity during the regular-time shift.14 While it is still possible that labor supply during the regu-
12:301:24522:27:27:72:542:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:lar  shift could  respond  to  pollution  (Hanna  and  Oliva,  2011),  the  levels  of  pollution  found  in  this 
12:302:24637:27:27:72:543:547:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:region are remarkably low (with one important exception, described below). Therefore, it is unlikely 
12:303:24737:27:27:72:542:520:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that  pollution led workers  to reduce  time  at work. Importantly,  since  we  follow  workers  over  time 
12:304:24845:27:27:72:543:493:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and observe hours worked, we explicitly test these assumptions by examining whether PM2.5 relates 
12:305:24940:27:27:72:372:466:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to the probability of working and the number of hours worked.  
12:306:25001:27:27:108:540:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The second challenge involves endogeneity  of  pollution. In  general,  pollution  levels  are in-
12:307:25096:27:27:72:542:412:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:fluenced by local business activity, so an increase in pollution could in fact result from higher levels 
12:308:25201:27:27:72:539:385:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of economic activity. Furthermore, individuals can sort into locations based on the amount of pollu-
12:309:25300:27:27:72:540:358:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:tion in that area, leading to non-random assignment of pollution. These and other concerns are un-
12:310:25396:27:27:72:543:331:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:likely to arise in our setting for several reasons. Since PM2.5 travels far and remains suspended in the 
12:311:25498:27:27:72:540:304:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:air for extended periods of time, the levels of PM2.5 at the factory are largely driven by factors out-
12:312:25598:27:27:72:539:277:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:side  the  firm, including traffic  conditions  and  business  activity  in  neighboring  areas,  such as  Sacra-
12:313:25711:27:27:72:539:250:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:mento and the Bay Area, both of which are more  than 100 miles away.15 In addition, since the de-
12:314:25807:27:27:72:542:223:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:mand for the pears comes from retailers around the country, and the supply of pears is from farms 
12:315:25905:27:65:72:540:196:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:throughout the region, factory activity is not likely to be driven by local economic activity. Moreo-
12:316:26005:65:9:216:219:131:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:                                                 
12:317:26053:9:14:72:534:122:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:14 We nonetheless present evidence on overtime outcomes, noting this limitation. The factory also utilized a night shift, 
12:318:26174:14:11:72:537:108:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:which was designed to absorb any unexpected productivity shocks experienced during the regular day shift. We unfortu-
12:319:26291:11:9:72:249:97:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:nately do not possess data on the night shift.  
12:320:26338:9:14:72:515:88:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:15 Although not specific to our setting, numerous studies document that the majority of air pollution levels are not 
12:321:26454:14:0:72:397:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:caused by local sources. See, for example, Ault et al. (2009) and Brook et al. (2007).  
13:322:26543:0:27:72:539:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ver, our focus on the high-frequency variation in pollution limits concerns regarding residential sort-
13:323:26646:27:27:72:327:682:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ing, which is largely based on average pollution levels.  
13:324:26701:27:27:108:542:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Figures 2 and 3 provide some empirical evidence regarding the exogeneity of PM2.5. Figure 2, 
13:325:26792:27:27:72:542:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:which plots PM2.5 over time, shows that it varies considerably from one period to the next. Figure 3, 
13:326:26893:27:27:72:540:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:which plots PM2.5 against temperature, shows that the variation in PM2.5 is not correlated with tem-
13:327:26990:27:27:72:542:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:perature, a potentially important factor in productivity.16 In fact, PM2.5 is not correlated with any of 
13:328:27093:27:27:72:539:547:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the environmental covariates in our analysis. When we regress PM2.5 on all of the environmental co-
13:329:27191:27:27:72:540:520:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:variates, the covariates are neither jointly nor individually statistically significant at even the 10 per-
13:330:27298:27:27:72:542:493:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:cent level (not shown). While we cannot rule out the possibility of omitted variables bias, this prima 
13:331:27398:27:27:72:543:466:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:facie evidence, supported by additional evidence below, suggests that this threat is minimized in our 
13:332:27500:27:27:72:111:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:setting.  
13:333:27508:27:27:108:540:412:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Notably, a massive wildfire (the “Biscuit Fire”) several hundred miles away on the border be-
13:334:27600:27:27:72:542:385:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:tween  northern  California  and  Oregon dramatically  increased PM2.5 levels  across  the  region during 
13:335:27703:27:27:72:542:358:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the study period. The fire started on July 12–15, 2002, as a result of a series of lightning storms, and 
13:336:27808:27:27:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:was not fully contained until December 31, 2002. While pollution levels in our study area were large-
13:337:27907:27:27:72:539:304:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ly unaffected by the fire, there was a brief period when emissions from the fire traveled near the fac-
13:338:28008:27:27:72:543:277:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:tory and  increased  pollution  levels  considerably. As  a  result, air  quality  at  our  study  site  exceeded 
13:339:28120:27:27:72:542:250:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:national ambient air quality standards for a two-week period in August of 2002, as shown in Figure 
13:340:28219:27:27:72:86:223:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:2.  
13:341:28221:27:27:108:542:196:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:While  the  fire  provides  an  exogenous  source  of  variation  in PM2.5,  one  concern  is  that it 
13:342:28323:27:27:72:543:169:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:could  have  led  to behavioral  responses that  affected worker  productivity. If  some  workers  altered 
13:343:28428:27:34:72:540:142:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the time they allocate to labor in response to higher pollution levels, estimated effects on the inten-
13:344:28531:34:9:216:219:108:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:                                                 
13:345:28579:9:14:72:542:99:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:16 We also interviewed the former CEO of the factory and asked how the factory handled environmental shocks. He told 
13:346:28695:14:11:72:534:85:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:us that the factory would occasionally pause work during heat waves, but not for pollution-related incidents. In fact, he 
13:347:28817:11:0:72:426:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:was entirely unaware of a potential relationship between pollution and worker productivity. 
14:348:28910:0:27:72:540:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:sive  margin  of  productivity  could  be  contaminated  by  changes  in  the  composition  of  labor. Fortu-
14:349:29018:27:27:72:543:682:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:nately, our analysis of labor supply responses, as described above, allows us to directly address this 
14:350:29121:27:27:72:543:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:concern.17 We  also  note  that  during  the  two-week  period  when  national air  quality  standards  were 
14:351:29229:27:27:72:543:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:violated, air  quality  alerts  were  issued  to  raise  public  awareness  about  potential  health  risks. Given 
14:352:29342:27:27:72:543:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the  gravity  of  these  alerts,  worker  anxiety  and  distractions  could  have  contributed  to  productivity 
14:353:29455:27:27:72:542:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:impacts on the intensive margin that are not purely the result of elevated pollution levels, so that the 
14:354:29560:27:27:72:543:547:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:alerts  themselves  may have affected productivity. For  that  reason, we present estimates that both 
14:355:29661:27:27:72:543:520:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:include  and exclude the  time  period  when fire-related alerts  were  issued. Furthermore,  we model 
14:356:29763:27:27:72:542:493:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:PM2.5 with a series of indicator variables to allow for a non-linear effect of PM2.5. This enables us to 
14:357:29865:27:27:72:540:466:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:not only isolate PM2.5 levels during the alert period, but also to explore the  dose-response  relation-
14:358:29968:27:47:72:209:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ship at lower levels of PM2.5.

14:362:30042:27:27:72:539:322:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:We  begin  our  analysis  by  assessing  whether  labor  supply  responds  to PM2.5. Table  2  provides esti-
14:363:30150:27:27:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:mates of our regression equation using an indicator variable for working or hours worked condition-
14:364:30247:27:27:72:543:268:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:al  on  working as  the  dependent  variable. We  begin  with  our  linear-in-PM2.5 model,  both  with  and 
14:365:30353:27:27:72:543:241:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:without those  weeks  in  which  there  was  at  least  one air  quality  alert  as  a  result  of  the Biscuit  Fire, 
14:366:30471:27:28:72:460:214:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and then estimate the nonlinear model both with and without the fire-related alert.  
14:367:30554:28:27:108:543:186:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Focusing on the probability worked, the first column demonstrates that each 1-unit increase 
14:368:30644:27:27:72:543:159:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:in PM2.5 has no effect (0.00) on the likelihood of working. Excluding the two weeks with air quality 
14:369:30744:27:35:72:539:132:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:alerts resulting from the Biscuit Fire (column 3) raises this estimate to 0.001 though it remains statis-
14:370:30847:35:9:216:219:97:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:                                                 
14:371:30895:9:14:72:529:88:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:17 Similarly, to the extent that the elevated PM2.5 levels induced sickness, we would detect this in our measures of days 
14:372:31015:14:0:72:146:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:and hours worked. 
15:373:31034:0:27:72:542:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:tically insignificant. Columns 3 and 4 present the results for the nonlinear model and here again we 
15:374:31133:27:27:72:361:682:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:find no significant impact of pollution on turning up at work.  
15:375:31195:27:27:108:543:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The  last  four  columns  in  Table  2  focus  on  hours  worked  conditional  on  working,  for  the 
15:376:31297:27:27:72:539:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:same model specifications as before. Column 5 shows that a 1-unit increase in PM2.5 leads to a statis-
15:377:31396:27:27:72:542:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:tically insignificant decrease of 0.002 hours worked. Excluding alert weeks (column 6) flips the sign 
15:378:31496:27:27:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:but, again, the effect is both small and statistically insignificant. When we allow PM2.5 to enter non-
15:379:31598:27:27:72:543:547:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:linearly  (columns 7 and  8),  we  continue  to  find  no  evidence  that  hours  worked  responds  to PM2.5. 
15:380:31706:27:27:72:542:520:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This lack  of  impact  on  the  extensive  margin,  even during  alert  periods associated  with  the Biscuit 
15:381:31815:27:27:72:542:493:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Fire, implies  that  our  estimates  of  the  impact  of PM2.5 on  labor  productivity  will  not  be  biased  by 
15:382:31927:27:27:72:241:466:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:changes in labor force composition.

15:386:32087:27:27:72:539:365:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:versus earnings. The figure uses data aggregated to the level of the firm and  the 6-day PM2.5 meas-
15:387:32184:27:27:72:539:338:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:urement period, which is our effective level of variation in PM2.5.18 The figure plots unadjusted sam-
15:388:32284:27:27:72:539:311:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ple means for the 6-day periods, and includes a linear prediction. Even with no controls, the raw da-
15:389:32383:27:27:72:422:284:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ta suggest a negative relationship: as PM2.5 levels rise, workers produce less. 
15:390:32459:27:27:108:543:257:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1: Estimates of our regression equation are shown in Table 3, which make up the core findings 
15:391:32548:27:27:72:540:230:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of our analysis. As with labor supply, we present results from four specifications, focusing on earn-
15:392:32648:27:27:72:540:203:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ings both in levels and in logs. Turning to levels, we find that PM2.5 has a statistically significant, neg-
15:393:32755:27:27:72:543:176:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ative effect on earnings per hour. Each additional unit of PM2.5 decreases hourly earnings by $0.041. 
15:394:32854:27:27:72:539:149:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:When we exclude weeks with air quality alerts because of the fire, our estimate is no longer statisti-
15:395:32953:27:36:72:542:122:12:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f4:cally significant  at  conventional  levels,  but  it  remains  of  comparable  magnitude. Thus,  while PM2.5 
15:396:33060:36:9:216:219:86:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:                                                 
15:397:33108:9:0:72:338:77:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:18 For ease of exposition, we exclude the Biscuit Fire from this plot.  
16:398:33180:0:27:72:542:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:levels  during the  alerts improve  the  precision  of  our  estimates, they  do  not  appear  to  be biasing 
16:399:33287:27:27:72:540:682:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:them;  additional  estimates below  support  this claim. This,  in  turn,  implies  that any  behavioral  re-
16:400:33394:27:27:72:543:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:sponses that  might  have  resulted from  the  fire-related  alerts  did  not  affect  worker  productivity, 
16:401:33502:27:27:72:540:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:strengthening our claim that the fire during this period provides a useful source of identifying varia-
16:402:33602:27:27:72:209:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:tion in PM2.5 for our analysis. 
16:403:33632:27:27:108:542:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1: The next  two  columns in  Table 3 allow PM2.5 to  have  a  non-linear  effect  on productivity. 
16:404:33727:27:27:72:540:547:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This also allows us to isolate the effect of air quality alerts stemming from the fire, which only oc-
16:405:33828:27:27:72:543:520:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:curred  when PM2.5 levels  were greater  than  25 μg/m3. We  find  that PM2.5 levels  between  15–20 
16:406:33925:27:27:72:540:493:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:μg/m3 decreases earnings by $0.53 per hour, though this effect is not statistically significant at con-
16:407:34023:27:27:72:539:466:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ventional  levels.  When PM2.5 reaches  20–25 μg/m3, the  effect  increases  to  $1.03 per  hour and  be-
16:408:34125:27:27:72:543:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:comes  statistically  significant. Importantly,  this  level of PM2.5 is  well  below the current air  quality 
16:409:34234:27:27:72:539:412:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:standard of 35 μg/m3. The effect further increases to $1.88 per hour when PM2.5 exceeds 25 and re-
16:410:34328:27:27:72:542:385:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:mains statistically significant. Excluding the two weeks with air quality alerts yields virtually identical 
16:411:34436:27:27:72:469:358:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:results, suggesting again that our results are not driven solely by alert-induced effects. 
16:412:34526:27:27:108:543:331:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:These  results  provide  clear  evidence  of  a  dose-response  relationship  between PM2.5 and 
16:413:34621:27:27:72:542:304:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:productivity, with a possible threshold at 15–20 μg/m3. To further illustrate this, Figure 5 plots the 
16:414:34722:27:27:72:542:277:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:linear  and  nonlinear  estimates. The  nonlinear  estimates  suggest  a  possible  threshold  around  15 
16:415:34828:27:27:72:543:250:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:μg/m3 with a roughly linear effect beyond the threshold. While we cannot be certain of a threshold 
16:416:34925:27:27:72:542:223:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:at this point – measurement error may bias the estimates towards zero – we note that this pattern is 
16:417:35024:27:27:72:543:196:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:roughly  consistent  with  evidence  on  the PM2.5-mortality  relationship,  which suggests a possible 
16:418:35127:27:27:72:344:169:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:threshold effect at around 20 μg/m3 (Smith et al., 2000).19  
16:419:35184:27:27:108:543:142:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The next set of columns present estimates using the logarithm of earnings as our measure of 
16:420:35276:27:29:72:542:115:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:productivity.  As  with  the  estimates  based  on  productivity  in  levels,  we  find a very  similar  pattern 
16:421:35389:29:9:216:219:86:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:                                                 
16:422:35437:9:0:72:530:77:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:19 It seems quite plausible that a lower threshold exists for productivity, since it is a significantly less harmful outcome. 
17:423:35563:0:27:72:542:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:across the four  specifications. When we convert the estimates using levels into percent by dividing 
17:424:35664:27:27:72:540:682:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:by the mean hourly earnings of $6.93 in our sample, the estimates suggest a roughly 0.6 percent ef-
17:425:35760:27:27:72:543:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:fect  from  a  1  unit  change  in PM2.5. Using the  logarithm  of earnings,  we  obtain  an  estimate  of  0.8 
17:426:35871:27:27:72:542:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:percent.  Compared  to  the  nonlinear-in-PM2.5 model,  the  implied  percent  effect  for  the  3  highest 
17:427:35978:27:27:72:542:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:PM2.5 bins are 0.08, 0.15,  and 0.27, respectively, which is also quite close to  the estimates from the 
17:428:36082:27:27:72:543:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:log  model  of 0.08, 0.15,  and 0.35.  Hence  our  results  do  not  appear  to  be  driven  by the functional 
17:429:36192:27:27:72:222:547:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:form of the dependent variable. 
17:430:36222:27:27:108:539:520:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1: The coefficients on the other covariates in Table 3 also reveal a pattern of results that rein-
17:431:36313:27:27:72:543:493:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:force the  plausibility  of  our  econometric  model.20 Environmental  conditions  vary  in  the  degree  to 
17:432:36421:27:27:72:543:466:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:which they influence the indoor work environment, and thus productivity should vary accordingly. 
17:433:36515:27:27:72:542:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Ozone,  which  is  a  highly  volatile  pollutant,  rapidly  breaks  down indoors as  it  interacts  with  other 
17:434:36628:27:27:72:543:412:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:surfaces. Likewise,  solar  radiation,  a  measure  of  available  sunlight, is  also  unlikely  to affect indoor 
17:435:36739:27:27:72:542:385:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:conditions given  the  presence  of  opaque  roofing  and  walls  at  the  factory. Consistent  with  this,  we 
17:436:36849:27:27:72:528:358:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:find that the coefficients on ozone and solar radiation are both small and statistically insignificant. 
17:437:36952:27:27:108:540:331:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1: On the other hand, outside temperature directly affects working conditions inside the facto-
17:438:37043:27:27:72:543:304:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ry, which  is  not  air  conditioned, so  it  may  be related  to  productivity. Consistent  with  this,  we  find 
17:439:37158:27:27:72:539:277:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that the coefficient on the first-order term for temperature is positive, although not statistically sig-
17:440:37263:27:27:72:543:250:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:nificant at conventional levels, and the quadratic term is negative and statistically significant. Based 
17:441:37368:27:27:72:543:223:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:on these estimates, we find an inflection point at roughly 72 degrees Fahrenheit. This is consistent 
17:442:37468:27:27:72:540:196:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:with  a  large  body  of  ergonomic  evidence  that  finds that task  performance exhibits an inverted U-
17:443:37573:27:27:72:485:169:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:shaped relationship with temperature at a similar inflection point (Hancock et al., 2007).

17:446:37710:9:14:72:536:88:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:20 Many of these variables are also likely to be exogenous for similar reasons as PM2.5, allowing us to interpret the coeffi-
17:447:37834:14:0:72:219:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:cients as causal (Lu and White, 2014). 
18:448:37874:0:27:108:214:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C. Robustness Checks 
18:449:37894:27:27:72:542:682:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:One concern with interpreting our estimate for PM2.5 as a causal effect on factory production is that 
18:450:37994:27:27:72:543:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:PM2.5 could be influencing factory productivity indirectly by affecting outdoor workers who harvest 
18:451:38093:27:27:72:543:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the fruit. If harvest production declines with PM2.5, this could reduce the queue of pears available for 
18:452:38197:27:27:72:539:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:factory workers to pack, thereby lowering their productivity indirectly. While we have no way of di-
18:453:38297:27:27:72:543:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:rectly  testing  this since  we  do  not  have  measures  of  the  pear  queue, there  are  three  reasons  this  is 
18:454:38413:27:27:72:208:547:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:unlikely to hinder inference.  
18:455:38443:27:27:108:540:520:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:First, the pears that arrive at the factory are harvested all around the region.21 Given the tre-
18:456:38538:27:27:72:542:493:12:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f4:mendous spatial variation in PM2.5, levels at the farms are likely to exhibit low correlation with PM2.5 
18:457:38642:27:27:72:542:466:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:at  the  factory. Second, the  factory’s operational procedures limit the potential  effect  of  harvest 
18:458:38747:27:27:72:539:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:productivity on pear-packer productivity. Since the harvesters start earlier in the day than the pack-
18:459:38848:27:27:72:542:412:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ers, the queue is unlikely to be empty, thereby shielding the packers from negative shocks in harvest 
18:460:38949:27:27:72:543:385:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:productivity. Furthermore, the workers on the overtime and night shifts handle any pears left over 
18:461:39047:27:27:72:543:358:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:by the regular shift, so shocks in harvest productivity will be absorbed by these later shifts, and not 
18:462:39149:27:27:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the regular-time day shift on which we focus. Third, we can also use our estimate for ozone to di-
18:463:39245:27:27:72:543:304:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:rectly test for this indirect  channel. Ozone  is  likely  to  affect  harvest productivity (Graff  Zivin  and 
18:464:39355:27:27:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Neidell, 2012), but it does not penetrate indoors, so it should not affect packer productivity. A sig-
18:465:39456:27:27:72:543:250:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:nificant effect of ozone on factory productivity would therefore suggest indirect effects due to losses 
18:466:39559:27:27:72:539:223:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:in  harvest  productivity. The  lack  of  a  significant  effect  of  ozone,  shown  in  Table  3, however, sug-
18:467:39669:27:27:72:540:196:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:gests that this is not the case. This suggests that our results for PM2.5 are indeed being driven by di-
18:468:39772:27:27:72:543:169:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:rect effects on the productivity of workers inside the factory rather than external factors that might 
18:469:39875:27:45:72:301:142:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:be disrupting the queue of fruit to be processed.

18:471:39972:9:14:72:530:88:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:21 The factory packed pears from Contra Costa, El Dorado, Lake, Mendocino, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Solano, Yolo 
18:472:40083:14:0:72:393:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:counties.  Together these counties cover 12,187 square miles and span 6 air basins. 
19:473:40168:0:27:108:540:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Table 4 presents a series of additional robustness checks. Column 1 repeats the baseline re-
19:474:40257:27:27:72:542:682:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:sults for  the  linear-in-PM2.5 models  with alert  weeks stemming  from  the  fire included. Since  daily 
19:475:40360:27:27:72:542:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:variation in PM2.5 may be driven by other environmental conditions that may also affect productivity, 
19:476:40461:27:27:72:540:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:it  is  essential that we control  for  those  other  environmental  conditions adequately;  the  next  3  col-
19:477:40571:27:27:72:542:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:umns explore this. Column 2 completely excludes all of the meteorology variables, while column 3 
19:478:40667:27:27:72:542:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:controls  for  temperature  more  flexibly  by  including  a  series  of  indicator  variables, and  column  4 
19:479:40777:27:27:72:543:547:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:adds three additional pollutants to the model (nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and coarse PM).22 
19:480:40876:27:27:72:543:520:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The effect of PM2.5 on productivity remains similar in magnitude across all three models, suggesting 
19:481:40975:27:27:72:319:493:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:environmental confounding is limited in our setting.  
19:482:41028:27:27:108:543:466:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1: Since we follow workers over time, we add worker fixed effects to our model to control for 
19:483:41114:27:27:72:542:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:all time-invariant characteristics of the workers, shown in Column 5. The estimated effect of PM2.5 is 
19:484:41216:27:27:72:539:412:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:unaffected  by  this  additional  control.  Although  we  argue  that  worker  exposure to PM2.5 is  exoge-
19:485:41321:27:27:72:539:385:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:nous, the fact that our estimates are unchanged by including fixed effects further supports our con-
19:486:41421:27:27:72:317:358:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:tention that worker selection is not related to PM2.5.  
19:487:41474:27:27:108:543:331:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1: Recall that while worker productivity is measured every day, PM2.5 is only measured every 6 
19:488:41565:27:27:72:543:304:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:days.  Although  we  perform  a  daily  analysis  and  cluster  standard  errors  on  these  6-day  periods,  we 
19:489:41678:27:27:72:542:277:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:also  perform  an  alternative  analysis  aggregated  to  the  6-day  period.  The  results  from  this  analysis, 
19:490:41793:27:27:72:540:250:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:reported in Column 6, show a very similar estimate that remains statistically significant at the 1 per-
19:491:41894:27:27:72:121:223:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:cent level. 
19:492:41905:27:27:108:543:196:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1: A complication with payroll at the factory is that earnings per hour are bounded from below 
19:493:41997:27:27:72:543:169:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:by the California minimum wage. When the minimum wage binds, workers may shirk since they no 
19:494:42089:27:27:72:542:142:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:longer receive additional compensation per piece. If PM2.5 lowers productivity such that workers are 
19:495:42188:27:29:72:543:115:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:more  likely  to  be  in  the  minimum  wage  regime,  and  then  shirking  further  lowers  productivity, this 
19:496:42299:29:9:216:219:86:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:                                                 
19:497:42347:9:0:72:264:77:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:22 Coarse PM is PM between 2.5 and 10 microns. 
20:498:42394:0:27:72:543:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:will bias our estimates (in absolute value) upward. While shirking should be limited in our setting by 
20:499:42497:27:27:72:539:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f1:the employer’s ability to observe individual output and easily terminate workers on short-term con-
20:500:42596:27:27:72:540:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:tracts, we cannot entirely rule it out. Therefore, to assess the degree to which shirking might be hap-
20:501:42697:27:27:72:542:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:pening, we artificially censor earnings at the minimum wage for all observations where workers fall 
20:502:42797:27:27:72:543:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:into the minimum wage regime, and estimate censored regression models (Graff Zivin and Neidell, 
20:503:42892:27:27:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:2012). If shirking increases with PM2.5 when workers earn the minimum wage, estimates from cen-
20:504:42986:27:27:72:543:547:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:sored models will be unbiased because the precise measure of productivity for workers earning the 
20:505:43084:27:27:72:543:520:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:minimum wage no longer contribute to the point estimate; it only contributes to the probability of 
20:506:43183:27:27:72:539:493:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:earning minimum wage. Since parametric censored regression models may be biased under misspeci-
20:507:43277:27:27:72:542:466:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:fication,  we  estimate  semi-parametric  censored  median  regressions  (Chernozhukov  and  Hong, 
20:508:43376:27:27:72:542:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:2002).  For  a  point  of comparison,  we  first  show  estimates  from  a  median regression,  in  column  7, 
20:509:43487:27:27:72:542:412:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:which at -0.044 is quite close to our baseline estimates. The censored median result of -0.040, shown 
20:510:43587:27:27:72:542:385:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:in column 8, is slightly smaller, though the difference is not statistically significant. This suggests that 
20:511:43696:27:27:72:346:358:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:shirking is unlikely to play a significant role in our analysis. 
20:512:43760:27:27:108:543:331:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1: Workers  may  also  respond  to  decreased  performance  by cutting  corners  when packaging 
20:513:43853:27:27:72:542:304:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:boxes. The firm performs random inspections of boxes as a way of eliminating this concern. If the 
20:514:43950:27:27:72:546:277:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:inspectors find a box is packed inappropriately, then the worker receives a wage penalty for the day.  
20:515:44050:27:27:72:542:250:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Such  violations  occurred  in  approximately 5 percent of  the worker  day  observations. We  estimate 
20:516:44151:27:27:72:542:223:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:our regression equation using the probability of a penalty on a given day as the dependent variable. 
20:517:44252:27:27:72:518:196:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Shown in column 8, we find that PM2.5 is not significantly related to the probability of a penalty. 
20:518:44350:27:27:108:543:169:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Next,  we  turn  to  overtime  hours.  For  the  bulk  of  our  analysis,  we  focused on the  regular 
20:519:44452:27:27:72:540:142:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:shift when labor supply is more likely to be fixed. For completeness, we also measure the relation-
20:520:44550:27:27:72:542:115:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ship between PM2.5 and overtime (OT) outcomes,  recognizing that OT hours are more likely to be 
20:521:44644:27:0:72:540:88:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:endogenous. A  day  with  high PM2.5 may  lower  productivity,  and  the  firm  may  compensate  by  in-
21:522:44749:0:27:72:542:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:creasing  the  demand  for  OT  hours,  particularly  when  contracts  with  retailers specify  fixed  delivery 
21:523:44861:27:27:72:543:682:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:dates and quantities. Alternatively, if a day with high PM2.5 increases worker fatigue, workers may be 
21:524:44962:27:27:72:543:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:less willing to supply the additional hours and/or firms may be less likely to request them. Similarly, 
21:525:45064:27:27:72:540:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:higher PM2.5, particularly during the alert periods due to the Biscuit Fire, may increase the time allo-
21:526:45167:27:27:72:543:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:cated  to family  members who need  assistance because  of  health  problems  or  activity  rescheduling, 
21:527:45271:27:27:72:542:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and  thus  drive  down the  supply  of OT  hours  through  increases  in the  opportunity  cost  of  time. 
21:528:45377:27:27:72:542:547:12:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f4:Shown in column 10, we find that OT hours decrease as PM2.5 increases: a 1 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 
21:529:45471:27:27:72:542:520:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:decreases OT hours  worked  by -0.023 hours. Since OT hours is  sensitive  to PM2.5,  any  effects  on 
21:530:45571:27:27:72:340:493:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:OT productivity is potentially biased by sample selection. 
21:531:45628:27:27:108:543:466:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:To explore whether selection into overtime induces bias in overtime productivity estimates, 
21:532:45719:27:27:72:542:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:we examine the effect of PM2.5 on regular-time productivity solely for those who work any overtime. 
21:533:45817:27:27:72:542:412:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:If there is selection bias into OT, the effect of PM2.5 on regular-time productivity should differ for 
21:534:45916:27:27:72:542:385:12:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f4:those who work OT versus those who do not. Shown in column 11, we find that the effect of PM2.5 
21:535:46009:27:27:72:543:358:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:on regular time productivity for those who work OT is identical to the overall estimate, suggesting 
21:536:46107:27:27:72:542:331:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that any  selection  into OT is in  fact not inducing  bias for  estimates  of  the  effect  of PM2.5 on  OT 
21:537:46213:27:27:72:133:304:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:productivity. 
21:538:46226:27:27:108:542:277:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Given  the apparent absence  of selection bias into  OT,  we measure the  effects of PM2.5 on 
21:539:46318:27:27:72:543:250:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:OT productivity.23 Column  12 suggests that PM2.5 has  a  significant,  negative  effect  on  productivity. 
21:540:46422:27:27:72:542:223:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:OT productivity decreases by -0.099 for each additional unit of PM2.5, which is larger than the effect 
21:541:46523:27:27:72:540:196:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of PM2.5 on  productivity  during  regular  time.  One  explanation  for  this  pattern  is  that increased  fa-
21:542:46633:27:27:72:533:169:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:tigue at the end of a day limits workers’ ability to compensate for the physiological effects of PM2.5. 
21:543:46735:27:27:108:539:142:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Last, we explore heterogeneity in the effects of PM2.5 by estimating quantile regression mod-
21:544:46826:27:18:72:539:115:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:els  for  each  decile of regular-time worker  productivity,  focusing  on  the  log  of  productivity  to  ac-

21:546:46982:9:14:72:535:88:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:23 Although the overtime piece rate is 1.5 times the regular-time piece rate, we divide overtime earnings by 1.5 to obtain 
21:547:47104:14:0:72:349:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:a coefficient that is directly comparable to the regular-time coefficients. 
22:548:47179:0:27:72:542:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:count  for  different  baseline  levels  of  productivity  across  workers. Plotted  in Panel  A  of Figure 6, 
22:549:47290:27:27:72:539:682:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:which assumes a linear effect for PM2.5, we see that the effect on productivity is statistically signifi-
22:550:47395:27:27:72:543:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:cant  in  all  deciles. The  effect is largest for  the  lowest  productivity  decile, slightly  increases  until 
22:551:47508:27:27:72:539:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:roughly the median level of productivity, and remains flat beyond the median. Importantly, this find-
22:552:47608:27:27:72:542:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ing  suggests  that  the  effect  of PM2.5 on  worker  productivity  is  not  driven  by  a  handful  of  workers 
22:553:47721:27:27:72:542:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:who are particularly susceptible to pollution, but rather affects the entire distribution of workers. By 
22:554:47824:27:27:72:542:547:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:contrast, Panel  B plots quantile  results  for  ozone,  and  finds  that the  effect of  ozone on packer 
22:555:47927:27:27:72:542:520:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:productivity is  never statistically significant,  further  supporting  our  contention  that  the  packers  are 
22:556:48040:27:47:72:196:493:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:directly affected by PM2.5.  
22:557:48068:47:33:72:178:446:15:g_d0_f1:15:g_d0_f1:6. IMPLICATIONS 
22:558:48082:33:27:72:530:413:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A key innovation in our analysis is the focus on PM2.5, which can easily penetrate indoors and thus 
22:559:48182:27:27:72:522:386:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:affect a large fraction of the economy. In light of this, it is useful to place our findings in a larger 
22:560:48286:27:27:72:528:359:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:context. We estimate that a 1 μg/m3 change in PM2.5 decreases worker productivity by roughly 0.6 
22:561:48379:27:27:72:517:332:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:percent. As a first step, we assess the productivity effects at a national level from the changes in 
22:562:48479:27:27:72:339:305:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:PM2.5 concentrations across the US from 1999 to 2008.24  
22:563:48533:27:27:108:542:278:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:We assume that our estimate of the effect of PM2.5 on the marginal product of labor applies 
22:564:48624:27:27:72:542:251:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to all workers in the US manufacturing sector. Although we cannot directly verify this assumption, 
22:565:48723:27:27:72:539:224:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:we believe it is a reasonable first-order approximation based on the following logic. The physiologi-
22:566:48824:27:27:72:543:197:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:cal  effects  from PM2.5 are similar  across populations throughout  the  US.  Since  the  effects  that  we 
22:567:48931:27:27:72:542:170:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f3:estimate  are  likely  to  be driven by physiological changes that impair workers’ ability to complete 
22:568:49034:27:23:72:543:143:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:physically demanding tasks, occupations with physical requirements similar to pear packing are likely 
22:569:49135:23:10:216:219:120:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:                                                 
22:570:49183:10:13:72:535:110:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:24 We focus on the years 1999 and 2008 because, for these two years, we have measures of PM2.5 for all counties in the 
22:571:49301:13:12:72:536:97:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:US. Pollution monitors provide incomplete coverage for the US, so we use estimates inferred from emissions data (Mul-
22:572:49418:12:11:72:532:85:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:ler, 2013). We thank Nick Muller for generously sharing this data. Data from pollution monitors led to almost identical 
22:573:49538:11:0:72:360:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:estimates to the inferred data for counties where monitors were available.  
23:574:49615:0:27:72:540:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to be similarly affected by PM2.5. Hence, our assumption rests on the idea that all workers in manu-
23:575:49713:27:27:72:543:682:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:facturing  are,  on  average,  performing  tasks  that  are  similar  to  pear  packing  in  the  degree  to  which 
23:576:49829:27:27:72:540:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:they are physically demanding. While the assumption may not hold for some workers in manufactur-
23:577:49923:27:27:72:543:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ing, such as supervisors and office workers, it is, on the other hand, likely to apply to many affected 
23:578:50025:27:27:72:543:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:but excluded workers in other industries, such as construction workers and most forms of outdoor

23:580:50128:27:27:108:540:547:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:As shown in Figure 7, there is considerable variation in county-level changes in fine particu-
23:581:50221:27:27:72:543:520:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:late matter pollution over this time period, with a national average decline of 2.79 μg/m3. We merge 
23:582:50320:27:27:72:539:493:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:this pollution data with county-level mean manufacturing earnings from the Bureau of Labor Statis-
23:583:50418:27:27:72:543:466:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:tics in 2000. We calculate that the decrease in PM2.5 led to an aggregate labor savings of $19.5 billion. 
23:584:50521:27:27:72:543:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This represents a 2.67 percent increase in manufacturing earnings, which translates to a 0.5 percent 
23:585:50622:27:27:72:242:412:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:increase in economy-wide earnings.  
23:586:50656:27:27:108:543:385:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:While  those  numbers  are  large  in  absolute  terms,  it  is  instructive to  compare  them  to  the 
23:587:50759:27:27:72:543:358:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:other welfare benefits associated with reducing PM2.5. In addition to affecting mortality and several 
23:588:50859:27:27:72:542:331:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:dimensions of morbidity, pollution  also  leads  to  numerous  behavioral  responses  to  limit  exposure

23:591:51173:27:27:72:542:250:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:frequently used method for quantifying the overall welfare benefits of pollution reduction is to use 
23:592:51274:27:27:72:543:223:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the hedonic price method by studying the effect of PM2.5 on housing values. Under the assumption 
23:593:51369:27:27:72:543:196:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of complete  and  transparent  markets,  all  of  the  effects  of PM2.5 should  be capitalized  into  house 
23:594:51476:27:27:72:175:169:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:prices (Rosen, 1974).  
23:595:51498:27:27:108:543:142:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:While we are unaware of any studies that link PM2.5 and housing values, Bento et al. (2013) 
23:596:51589:27:18:72:539:115:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:have estimated this relationship for PM10, which is closely related to PM2.5. Exploiting plausibly ex-

23:598:51738:9:14:72:526:88:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:25 There is also growing evidence that PM2.5 affects cognitive performance (Lavy et al., 2012), which implies potential 
23:599:51856:14:0:72:290:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:productivity impacts across high-skilled workers as well.

24:601:52026:27:27:72:539:682:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:increases  housing  values  by  $43.9  billion. PM2.5 is the subset  of  PM10 that is smaller than  2.5  mi-
24:602:52130:27:27:72:543:655:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:crons26, with evidence suggesting that  roughly  60  percent  of  PM10 concentrations in  the  US are 
24:603:52229:27:27:72:542:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:comprised of PM2.5 (Eldred et al., 1997).27 Applying this number to the estimates from Bento et al. 
24:604:52327:27:27:72:542:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:suggests that the changes in PM2.5 from 1999–2008 increased housing values by approximately $57.3 
24:605:52424:27:27:72:213:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:billion (in year 2000 dollars).28 
24:606:52455:27:27:108:543:547:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Thus, if we assume that our estimated labor impacts are capitalized into housing prices, they 
24:607:52549:27:27:72:539:520:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:account for approximately 34 percent of the total benefits associated with reductions in PM2.5 pollu-
24:608:52647:27:27:72:539:493:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:tion. That said, there is reason to believe that these labor impacts may not be fully reflected in hous-
24:609:52750:27:27:72:542:466:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ing values. The average American lives 12 miles from their workplace (Santos et al., 2011), and the 
24:610:52849:27:27:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:large spatial variation in pollution implies that pollution exposure faced at work may be quite differ-
24:611:52952:27:27:72:542:412:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ent from that faced at home. Yet, empirical studies suggest that the impact of pollution on housing 
24:612:53051:27:27:72:543:385:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:values  is  quite  localized. Indeed,  Bento  et  al.  (2013)  finds  that  housing  values  more  than  5  miles 
24:613:53164:27:27:72:542:358:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:from a pollution monitor are unaffected by air quality levels. Currie et al. (2013) find a similar result 
24:614:53269:27:27:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:for air toxics, with housing impacts limited to a 0.5 mile radius around an emitting factory. Moreo-
24:615:53368:27:27:72:543:304:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ver, this paper is the first to document indoor productivity effects from pollution and thus it seems 
24:616:53470:27:27:72:543:277:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:quite plausible that individuals are unaware of such impacts when they determine their willingness to 
24:617:53572:27:27:72:542:250:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:pay for residential property. As such, it appears likely that much, if not all, of our estimated impacts 
24:618:53675:27:27:72:543:223:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:on  labor  productivity  are  overlooked  by  hedonic  valuation  approaches.  In that case,  housing  price 
24:619:53783:27:31:72:498:196:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:based estimates understate the total benefits from reducing PM2.5 by more than 25 percent.

24:621:53919:10:13:72:519:155:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:26 Recall that “coarse” particulate matter refers to those particles between 2.5 and 10 microns in diameter, e.g. PM10 
24:622:54036:13:9:72:161:142:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:measures net of PM2.5. 
24:623:54058:9:14:72:528:133:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:27 This number is calculated by averaging concentrations across study sites and seasons for which elemental data were 
24:624:54175:14:9:72:283:119:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:available as reported in Table 3 of Eldred et al. (1997). 
24:625:54232:9:13:72:531:110:6:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:28 We arrive at the estimate of $57.3 billion as follows. We divide the $43.9 billion estimate from Bento et al. (2013) by 
24:626:54354:13:12:72:540:97:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:the 4.7 unit decline in PM10 to obtain the value per unit change in PM10. We then multiply it by 0.6 to convert it to a unit 
24:627:54477:12:11:72:520:85:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:change in PM2.5. We then multiply by 2.79 to estimate the implied housing change associated with improvements in 
24:628:54589:11:0:72:518:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:PM2.5 from 1999–2008. Lastly, we adjust for inflation by multiplying by the CPI growth from 1990 to 2000 of 1.32. 
25:629:54702:0:44:72:173:707:15:g_d0_f1:15:g_d0_f1:7. CONCLUSION 
25:630:54714:44:27:72:543:663:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:In this paper, we analyze the relationship between PM2.5, a ubiquitous pollutant that penetrates into 
25:631:54816:27:27:72:542:636:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:indoor settings, and individual-level productivity inside a pear packing factory. We find that a 10-unit 
25:632:54920:27:27:72:542:609:12:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f4:change in PM2.5 significantly decreases worker productivity by roughly 6 percent. Importantly, PM2.5 
25:633:55018:27:27:72:542:582:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:begins  to  affect  productivity  at  levels  well  below  current  US air  quality  standards. These findings

25:635:55225:27:27:72:543:528:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:individual health outcomes by providing the first evidence that outdoor environmental pollution can 
25:636:55323:27:27:72:327:501:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:adversely affect the productivity of indoor workers.  
25:637:55375:27:27:103:542:474:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Since  these  productivity  effects  also affect firm  profits,  firms  may internalize  some  of  these 
25:638:55479:27:27:72:543:447:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:costs by reducing worker exposure to PM2.5. While the installation of sophisticated filtration systems 
25:639:55581:27:27:72:539:420:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:has the potential to remove PM2.5 from the air, current technology is limited in its ability to fully re-
25:640:55685:27:27:72:542:393:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:move PM2.5, particularly the smallest and most pernicious particulates (Mostofi et al., 2010; Shi et al., 
25:641:55791:27:27:72:542:366:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:2013). Moreover,  since PM2.5 accumulates  in  the  body  over  several  days,  exposure  away  from  the 
25:642:55895:27:27:72:543:339:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:office, where workers spend the majority of their time, cannot be controlled via investments in these 
25:643:55996:27:27:72:542:312:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:technologies. Reductions  of source emissions are also a challenge for the private sector since most 
25:644:56096:27:27:72:542:285:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:occur  outside  the  boundary  of  the  firm, and  the  multitude  of  emitters  introduces  a  coordination 
25:645:56204:27:27:72:540:258:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:problem  that  limits  the  scope  for  Coasean  bargains  to  reduce  emissions. Thus, productivity-
25:646:56304:27:27:72:543:231:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:enhancing  investments  in  this  context  are  likely  to  be more  efficient  through  publicly  coordinated 
25:647:56415:27:27:72:383:204:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:reductions in contamination rather than unilateral efforts by firms. 
25:648:56483:27:27:108:542:177:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The determination  of optimal regulatory  standards requires policy  makers  to  balance  the 
25:649:56574:27:27:72:542:150:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:costs and benefits of additional regulations. Our results indicate that pollution has an important cost 
25:650:56678:27:27:72:539:123:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:beyond  the  health effects  and  quality  of  life issues  typically  considered  in  the  calculus  of  both aca-
25:651:56793:27:0:72:542:96:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:demics and policymakers. Indeed, applying our estimated effects to all of US manufacturing suggests 
26:652:56893:0:27:72:543:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that the modest decline in PM2.5 pollution from 1999 to 2008 generated nearly $20 billion in benefits. 
26:653:56992:27:27:72:542:682:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:In light of growing evidence that PM2.5 exposure can affect cognitive performance (Lavy et al., 2012),
