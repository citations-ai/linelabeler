2:34:1968:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:Foreign currency borrowing is perceived as a source of financial instability in emerging markets. We
2:35:2068:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:propose a theory where liability dollarization arises from an insurance motive of domestic savers. Because
2:36:2174:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:financial crises are associated with currency depreciations, savers are reluctant to hold assets denominated
2:37:2282:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:in local currency. This behavior makes local currency debt expensive, incentivizing borrowers to issue
2:38:2384:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:foreign currency debt. We show that this mechanism can generate multiple equilibria, with the bad
2:39:2481:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:equilibrium characterized by dollarization and financial instability. A domestic lender of last resort
2:40:2583:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:can eliminate the bad equilibrium, but interventions need to be fiscally credible. Holdings of foreign
2:41:2685:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:currency reserves hedge the fiscal position of the government and enhance its credibility, thus improving
2:42:2790:14:42:72:159:476:12:Times:12:Times:financial stability.

3:57:3074:0:33:56:181:735:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:1    Introduction
3:58:3091:33:19:56:538:702:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Emerging  economies  are  exposed  to  recurrent  episodes  of  financial  instability.   At  least
3:59:3190:19:18:56:538:683:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:since the East Asian crisis of 1997, this instability has been linked to the presence of debt
3:60:3283:18:18:56:538:665:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:denominated  in  foreign  currency  issued  by  banks,  firms,  or  households.   These  various
3:61:3379:18:18:56:538:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:forms of liability dollarization can amplify the effects of financial crises, as crises are typ-
3:62:3475:18:18:56:538:629:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ically associated with currency depreciations,  and depreciations increase the real burden
3:63:3565:18:18:56:538:611:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of  foreign  currency  debt.   Liability  dollarization  also  makes  it  challenging  for  domestic
3:64:3665:18:18:56:538:593:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:authorities to intervene in financial markets when a crisis takes place:  covering the losses
3:65:3758:18:18:56:538:575:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of local borrowers by expanding domestic money supply can lead to inflationary concerns
3:66:3845:18:18:56:538:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and exacerbate the currency depreciation, while using government borrowing may lead to
3:67:3931:18:21:56:277:539:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:concerns about public debt sustainability.
3:68:3973:21:18:70:538:518:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:While we have a good understanding of the mechanisms by which foreign currency debt
3:69:4056:18:18:56:538:500:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:makes emerging economies more fragile, we still have a relatively limited understanding
3:70:4143:18:18:56:538:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the incentives that drive the accumulation of foreign currency debt in the first place.  In
3:71:4237:18:18:56:538:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:this paper we build a theory of liability dollarization and study how it interacts with policy
3:72:4331:18:21:56:454:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:interventions, focusing in particular on operations of lending of last resort.
3:73:4409:21:18:70:538:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our theory builds on two observations emphasized in recent empirical work. First, coun-
3:74:4496:18:18:56:538:407:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tries characterized by high levels of liability dollarization are also countries where domestic
3:75:4591:18:18:56:538:389:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:agents tend to save in foreign currency.1Second, local currency bonds in these economies
3:76:4679:18:18:56:538:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are  characterized  by  positive  excess  returns  over  comparable  dollar  bonds,  which  effec-
3:77:4777:18:18:56:538:353:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tively means that borrowing in dollars is cheaper than borrowing in local currency.2In our
3:78:4867:18:18:56:538:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:theory, both facts are driven by the incentives of domestic savers to insure against a crisis.
3:79:4961:18:18:56:538:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Because crises are associated with a depreciation of the local currency, domestic savers are
3:80:5053:18:19:56:538:299:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reluctant to hold local currency assets.  This behavior puts upward pressure on local cur-
3:81:5143:19:18:56:538:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rency interest rates, incentivizing domestic borrowers to issue debt in foreign currency. We
3:82:5235:18:18:56:538:262:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:show that this mechanism can lead to multiple equilibria, with a bad equilibrium charac-
3:83:5323:18:18:56:538:244:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:terized by higher excess returns on domestic currency bonds, more financial dollarization,
3:84:5413:18:18:56:538:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and  a  higher  probability  of  crises.   In  line  with  this  logic,  and  in  contrast  with  the  con-
3:85:5520:18:18:56:538:208:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ventional view, we also show that ex-post government interventions that reduce financial
3:86:5608:18:18:56:538:190:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:instability can induce the private sector to take safer choices ex ante:  by reducing savers’
3:87:5701:18:19:56:538:172:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:demand for insurance, they can lead in equilibrium to lower levels of liability dollarization.
3:88:5795:19:16:73:538:153:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:1This correlation is documented inDe Nicoló, Honohan, and Ize(2003) andLevy-Yeyati(2006).Arteta
3:89:5890:16:9:56:453:137:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:(2005) shows that this relation is stronger for countries with more volatile exchange rates.
3:90:5982:9:15:73:538:128:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:2Burnside,  Eichenbaum,  and  Rebelo(2007)  first  documented  large  deviations  from  uncovered  interest
3:91:6089:15:12:56:538:113:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:rate parity (UIP) for emerging market bonds.  Recent work byDalgic(2017) andWiriadinata(2017) finds a
3:92:6190:12:0:56:529:101:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:positive correlation across countries between these UIP deviations and the degree of liability dollarization.
4:93:6300:0:18:70:538:736:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We develop these arguments in a framework that extends a “third-generation” currency
4:94:6384:18:18:56:538:718:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:crisis model (Krugman, 1999) by adding an explicit treatment of ex ante portfolio decisions
4:95:6475:18:18:56:538:700:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of borrowers and savers, in line with recent developments in the macro-financial literature
4:96:6566:18:18:56:538:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(Gertler  and  Kiyotaki,  2010;  Brunnermeier  and  Sannikov,  2014;  He  and  Krishnamurthy,
4:97:6659:18:18:56:538:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2015). We consider a small open economy populated by two types of domestic agents, con-
4:98:6746:18:18:56:538:646:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sumers and bankers, and by risk-neutral foreign investors.  Consumers work for domestic
4:99:6833:18:19:56:538:628:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firms and save in bonds denominated in domestic and foreign currency. Bankers borrow in
4:100:6920:19:18:56:538:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:domestic and foreign currency and use these resources along with their accumulated net
4:101:7006:18:18:56:538:591:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:worth to purchase domestic capital, which is used as input in production.  The model fea-
4:102:7095:18:18:56:538:573:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tures two sources of financial frictions: banks face a potentially binding financial constraint,
4:103:7191:18:21:56:396:555:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and foreign investors only borrow and lend in foreign currency.
4:104:7254:21:18:70:538:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our economy is exposed to self-fulfilling crises because of a feedback loop between the
4:105:7341:18:18:56:538:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:exchange rate and banks’ net worth.  A decline in banks’ net worth depresses investment,
4:106:7429:18:18:56:538:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:which  reduces  expected  future  wages  and  consumers’  demand  for  non-tradable  goods,
4:107:7520:18:18:56:538:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:causing  a  real  exchange  rate  depreciation.   An  exchange  rate  depreciation,  then,  reduces
4:108:7619:18:18:56:538:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:banks’  net  worth  if  they  have  foreign  currency  liabilities  and  domestic  currency  assets.
4:109:7719:18:18:56:538:444:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Thus, an economy with enough foreign currency debt is exposed to a crisis in which banks’
4:110:7808:18:21:56:495:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:net worth, the real exchange rate, and consumers’ income all fall at the same time.
4:111:7891:21:18:70:538:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The key aspect of our paper is to study how the comovement caused by financial crises
4:112:7976:18:18:56:538:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:influences the ex ante portfolio decisions of consumers and bankers regarding the currency
4:113:8066:18:18:56:538:369:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:denomination of their financial positions. When crises are possible in the future, consumers
4:114:8158:18:18:56:538:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:have an incentive to insure by saving in foreign currency because of the hedging properties
4:115:8249:18:18:56:538:333:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:highlighted  above:  in  a  crisis,  consumers’  income  goes  down  while  the  foreign  currency
4:116:8347:18:18:56:538:315:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:appreciates.  In general equilibrium, this means that the interest rate in domestic currency
4:117:8439:18:18:56:538:297:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:will be high relative to the interest rate in foreign currency, making foreign currency bor-
4:118:8531:18:18:56:538:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rowing relatively cheaper for banks. This mechanism can dominate the banks’ own motives
4:119:8618:18:21:56:401:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to insure against a crisis, leading them to issue more dollar debt.
4:120:8685:21:18:70:538:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This feedback between the insurance motives of consumers and the risk of future crises
4:121:8771:18:18:56:538:222:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:can  be  so  strong  as  to  produce  multiple  equilibria.   In  asafeequilibrium,  consumers  are
4:122:8870:18:19:56:538:204:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:not worried about future crises and are happy to save in domestic currency, banks borrow
4:123:8958:19:18:56:538:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mostly in domestic currency, the balance sheet effects of currency depreciation are weak,
4:124:9047:18:18:56:538:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and crises cannot occur.  This confirms consumers’ expectations.  In afragileequilibrium,
4:125:9136:18:18:56:538:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:consumers are worried about future crises and save in foreign currency. Domestic currency
4:126:9225:18:18:56:538:131:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:funding is more expensive, so banks borrow in dollars, making the financial sector more
4:127:9312:18:18:56:538:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fragile and opening the door to the possibility of a crisis.  Again, consumers’ expectations
4:128:9404:18:0:56:538:95:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are confirmed.  This novel form of multiplicity emphasizes the importance of allowing for
5:129:9494:0:21:56:479:736:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:endogenous risk premia as determinants of the currency denomination of debt.
5:130:9570:21:18:70:538:715:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The presence of these fragile equilibria motivates our analysis of lending of last resort.
5:131:9660:18:18:56:538:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We consider  the problem  of a  benevolent government  that can  extend a  liquidity facility
5:132:9753:18:18:56:538:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to the banks when a crisis takes place.  Although these interventions can break the feed-
5:133:9842:18:18:56:538:661:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:back loop between exchange rates and banks’ net worth, we show that a government with
5:134:9927:18:18:56:538:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:limited fiscal resources might be unable to credibly eliminate the crisis equilibrium.  The
5:135:10018:18:18:56:538:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reason is that when private investors hold pessimistic expectations, they also forecast low
5:136:10109:18:18:56:538:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:future tax revenues, and they are reluctant to purchase government debt.  This constrains
5:137:10198:18:19:56:538:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the government’s ability to finance the liquidity facilities and to lead the economy out of
5:138:10289:19:18:56:538:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the crisis.  In this context, we show that foreign currency reserves hedge the fiscal position
5:139:10383:18:18:56:538:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the government because they appreciate precisely when the private investors hold pes-
5:140:10471:18:18:56:538:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:simistic expectations. When sufficiently large, the ex ante accumulation of foreign currency
5:141:10563:18:18:56:538:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reserves allows the government to credibly operate as a lender of last resort and eliminates
5:142:10655:18:21:56:172:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the crisis equilibrium.
5:143:10678:21:18:70:538:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This last set of results provides a rationale to the view, articulated by several economists
5:144:10770:18:18:56:538:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and policymakers, that emerging market authorities recently accumulated large quantities
5:145:10858:18:18:56:538:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of foreign currency reserves in order to improve financial stability.3In our framework, for-
5:146:10950:18:18:56:538:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:eign currency reserves help financial stability because they have good hedging properties
5:147:11039:18:18:56:538:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:against bad equilibria.  In other words, a desirable feature of foreign currency reserves is
5:148:11131:18:18:56:538:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that if private sector beliefs deteriorate, pushing the economy toward a crisis, the value of
5:149:11224:18:21:56:433:369:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reserves increases, giving the government more resources to intervene.
5:150:11294:21:18:70:538:348:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Importantly, the accumulation of official foreign currency reserves does not induce the
5:151:11381:18:18:56:538:330:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:banking sector to increase risk taking ex ante,  as the standard moral hazard logic would
5:152:11470:18:18:56:538:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:suggest.  When the government can credibly rule out financial panics, it also reduces the
5:153:11559:18:18:56:538:294:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:incentives  of  domestic  savers  to  hold  foreign  currency  assets  for  precautionary  reasons.
5:154:11658:18:18:56:538:276:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Through this mechanism, ex post interventions reduce the costs of borrowing in domestic
5:155:11745:18:18:56:538:258:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:currency, deterring banks from borrowing in foreign currency.  In this sense, official hold-
5:156:11837:18:18:56:538:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ings of foreign currency reserves can play a catalytic role by encouraging virtuous behavior
5:157:11929:18:40:56:525:222:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of local borrowers and by promoting financial stability also from an ex ante perspective.
5:158:12018:40:18:56:538:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:Literature.Our  research  is  related  to  several  strands  of  literature.   Following  the  crises
5:159:12119:18:18:56:538:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the late 1990s,  several authors have developed equilibrium models to explain the joint
5:160:12209:18:19:56:538:146:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:occurrence of financial and currency crises.  The seminal work of Krugman (1999) empha-
5:161:12296:19:16:73:538:127:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:3For example, in a speech as governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King argues that the buildup of
5:162:12396:16:12:56:538:111:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:foreign currency reserves allows emerging market authorities to act as “do-it-yourself lenders of last resort
5:163:12505:12:0:56:309:99:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:in US dollars to their own financial system” (King, 2006).

6:165:12651:18:18:56:538:718:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:multiple equilibria when firms/financial institutions have dollar debt.  Other seminal con-

6:168:12915:18:18:56:538:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(2000,2001).  An important innovation relative to this literature is that we endogenize debt
6:169:13007:18:18:56:538:646:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:denomination and show how risk premia can lead banks to endogenously choose currency
6:170:13091:18:21:56:293:628:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:positions that expose an economy to a crisis.
6:171:13136:21:18:70:538:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The economic mechanism that produces foreign currency debt in our setting are distinct
6:172:13222:18:19:56:538:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from other explanations offered in the literature and, in particular, fromSchneider and Tor-
6:173:13314:19:18:56:538:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nell(2004),Burnside, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo(2001a) andFarhi and Tirole(2012).  These
6:174:13398:18:18:56:538:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:papers emphasize the role of bailout guarantees that, coupled with the financial instabil-
6:175:13488:18:18:56:538:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ity  typical  of  emerging  markets,  can  induce  the  private  sector  to  take  excessive  risk  and
6:176:13591:18:18:56:538:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:borrow in foreign currency.4In contrast, we emphasize the portfolio choices of domestic
6:177:13678:18:18:56:538:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:savers  and  how  their  demand  for  safety  can,  through  a  general  equilibrium  mechanism,
6:178:13774:18:18:56:538:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:incentivize local borrowers to issue dollar debt.  As explained earlier, our theory has dis-
6:179:13866:18:18:56:538:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tinctive predictions for the coexistence of asset and liability dollarization and for deviations
6:180:13962:18:18:56:538:444:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from uncovered interest parity that finds support in the data. Another key difference lies in
6:181:14055:18:18:56:538:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the effects of policy:  in the moral hazard view, ex post government interventions generate
6:182:14146:18:18:56:538:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:risk shifting and lead to more dollar debt; in our theory, these interventions can reduce the
6:183:14239:18:21:56:313:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:degree of financial dollarization in the economy.
6:184:14288:21:18:70:538:369:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our approach to lending of last resort is close toGertler and Kiyotaki(2015).  In their
6:185:14375:18:18:56:538:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:environment, providing liquidity to the financial sector during a panic has ex ante benefits,
6:186:14468:18:18:56:538:333:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and  it  is  always  optimal  ex  post  because  the  government  does  not  face  borrowing  con-
6:187:14566:18:18:56:538:315:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:straints.  The main innovation in our paper relative to their approach is that we explicitly
6:188:14658:18:18:56:538:297:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:formulate a game between the government and private investors,  which embeds equilib-
6:189:14743:18:18:56:538:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rium in goods and asset markets.  This allows us to analyze whether off-the-equilibrium-
6:190:14831:18:18:56:538:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:path promises to intervene in a “bad” equilibrium are credible and to discuss how limited
6:191:14920:18:19:56:538:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fiscal  capacity  can  interfere  with  lending  of  last  resort  policies.   The  only  previous  work
6:192:15024:19:18:56:538:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we know of that discusses credibility issues in lending of last resort policies isEnnis and

6:196:15384:19:16:73:538:148:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:4On the normative side,Caballero and Krishnamurthy(2003) suggest that dollar debt might be excessive
6:197:15484:16:8:56:345:132:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:relative to the social optimum because of pecuniary externalities.
6:198:15550:8:16:73:538:124:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:5A  different  approach  to  think  about  the  fiscal  costs  of  intervention  is  to  consider  the  policy  maker’s
6:199:15669:16:0:56:524:108:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:uncertainty on whether a crisis is due to illiquidity or insolvency, an approach pursued inRobatto(2017).

7:204:16133:18:18:56:538:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of  debt  denomination  comes  from  a  stylized  portfolio  problem  and  use  it  to  study  the
7:205:16231:18:18:56:538:646:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:complementarity between dollar invoicing and financial dollarization in the international
7:206:16320:18:19:56:538:628:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:monetary system.  A distinctive feature of our paper relative to this literature is the focus
7:207:16413:19:20:56:413:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on the hedging benefits of dollar assets against financial instability.
7:208:16484:20:19:70:538:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:An important literature studies the role of foreign currency reserves as insurance against

7:211:16754:18:18:56:538:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:this  literature,  our  focus  on  reserves’  role  to  fight  financial  panics  leads  to  a  distinct  set
7:212:16863:18:18:56:538:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of predictions.7In particular, our model can rationalize why reserves across countries are
7:213:16953:18:18:56:538:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:well explained by the size of the financial sector’s total liabilities,  as shown byObstfeld,
7:214:17046:18:18:56:538:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Shambaugh, and Taylor(2010).  Moreover, our framework can explain why reserves seem
7:215:17129:18:18:56:538:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to be underutilized by domestic authorities, as documented byAizenman and Sun(2012).
7:216:17213:18:18:56:538:444:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In our framework, a government that accumulates enough reserves can rule out financial

7:228:18170:18:18:56:538:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:as given.  Section4 studies the optimal portfolio choices of households and banks in the
7:229:18258:18:18:56:538:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:initial  period.   In  Section5  we  introduce  a  government  and  study  lending  of  last  resort,

8:237:18854:19:18:56:538:683:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:groups  of  domestic  agents,  consumers  and  bankers,  who  trade  with  a  large  number  of
8:238:18949:18:18:56:538:665:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:foreign investors. There are two goods in the economy, a tradable good and a non-tradable
8:239:19038:18:21:56:86:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:good.
8:240:19043:21:18:70:538:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The model is built around three ingredients.  First, in line with standard financial accel-
8:241:19134:18:18:56:538:608:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:erator models, bankers have unique access to a superior technology to accumulate capital,
8:242:19223:18:18:56:538:590:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and they finance capital accumulation with debt. Second, debt can be denominated in non-
8:243:19311:18:18:56:538:572:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tradable or tradable goods, which is meant to capture debt denominated in domestic and
8:244:19397:18:18:56:538:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:foreign currency. This creates the possibility of currency mismatch. Third, consumers sup-
8:245:19487:18:18:56:538:536:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ply labor that is combined with capital to produce tradable output.  This last assumption
8:246:19576:18:18:56:538:518:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:introduces a simple macro spillover by which consumers’ incomes go down when bankers’
8:247:19661:18:21:56:271:500:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:capacity to accumulate capital contracts.
8:248:19702:21:18:70:538:479:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We now turn to a detailed description of the environment. The model includes a number
8:249:19787:18:43:56:509:461:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of simplifying assumptions. Their role is discussed in detail at the end of the section.

8:261:20382:21:18:70:538:169:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Consumers  trade  one-period  bonds  denominated  in  tradable  and  non-tradable  goods,

8:263:20562:18:18:56:538:133:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:represent foreign and domestic currency denominated bonds. Currency denomination can
8:264:20646:18:18:56:538:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:be modeled in other ways—for example, by denominating domestic bonds in terms of the
8:265:20730:18:0:56:538:97:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:domestic consumption basket, or by introducing explicitly nominal variables and making
9:266:20817:0:18:56:538:736:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:assumptions about monetary policy.  For our purposes here, simply denominating bonds
9:267:20901:18:21:56:421:718:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in tradables and non-tradables makes the analysis more transparent.
9:268:20968:21:33:70:263:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The consumers’ budget constraint is

9:271:21147:18:39:56:460:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:subject to the budget constraint (1) and the terminal conditionaN3=aT3=0.
9:272:21220:39:18:56:538:574:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:Bankers.Bankers  are  risk-neutral  agents  and  consume  only  tradable  goods  at  date  2.
9:273:21313:18:18:56:538:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Bankers own banks. Banks hold physical capitalkt, which is used as input in the production
9:274:21403:18:19:56:538:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of  tradable  goods  and  yields  the  rental  ratert.  Banks  have  access  to  a  linear  technology
9:275:21505:19:18:56:538:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to convert one unit of tradable goods into one unit of capital and vice versa.  Capital fully
9:276:21598:18:18:56:538:501:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:depreciates at the end of each period.  Banks also receive a non-tradable endowment each

9:285:22095:18:18:56:538:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:they have to satisfy the following collateral constraint, which requires total end-of-period
9:286:22187:18:18:56:538:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:liabilities to be bounded, in each state of the world, by a fraction of the capital held by the
9:287:22282:18:18:56:85:262:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bank:

9:291:22492:18:21:56:418:182:12:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:to consume or to start a new bank. Diversion entails a real costθkt.8

10:303:22870:0:18:56:539:736:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:Production.Consumers own two types of firms.  Tradable goods firms produce tradable
10:304:22953:18:33:56:414:718:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:goods using capital and labor according to the production function

10:307:23076:21:18:70:538:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Next,  there  are  firms  that  produce  capital ̃ktusing  a  linear  technology  that  requires
10:308:23172:18:18:56:539:613:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:φ>1 units of tradable goods per unit of capital.  Since the latter technology is inferior to
10:309:23264:18:18:56:538:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the banks’ technology, these firms will only be active when banks’ capital is low enough,
10:310:23353:18:21:56:172:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:as we will see shortly.
10:311:23376:21:18:70:538:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Both types of firms owned by consumers run constant returns to scale technologies, so
10:312:23461:18:18:56:538:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:their profits will be zero in equilibrium and can be omitted from the consumers’ budget

10:314:23560:21:33:70:506:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We assume that the total endowment of non-tradable goods is constant over time:

10:316:23654:39:19:56:538:427:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:Foreign investors.Foreign investors are risk neutral and consume only tradable goods.
10:317:23739:19:18:56:538:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Their discount factor isβ.  An important restriction in our model is that foreign investors
10:318:23830:18:43:56:413:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:can only purchase tradable denominated bonds, denoted by{aT∗t}.
10:319:23893:43:29:56:170:347:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:2.2    Equilibrium
10:320:23911:29:19:56:538:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:There  are  no  fundamental  shocks  in  the  economy,  but  given  the  possibility  of  multiple
10:321:24009:19:18:56:538:299:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equilibria, we introduce a sunspot variableζrealized att=1, with a uniform distribution
10:322:24096:18:18:56:538:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on[0, 1], and use this sunspot as a selection device when multiple equilibria are possible at
10:323:24189:18:18:56:538:263:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:t=1. For ease of notation, we will mostly leave implicit the dependence of variables dated
10:324:24279:18:30:56:243:245:12:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f3:t=1, 2 on the sunspot realization.9

10:329:24645:16:15:73:538:130:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:9We only introduce a sunspot att=1 because,  conditional on past state variables,  no multiplicity can
10:330:24747:15:12:56:538:115:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:arise att=2, and we do not need to specify how multiplicity is resolved att=0, given that no previous
10:331:24848:12:0:56:252:103:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:decision relies on that equilibrium selection.
11:332:24895:0:18:70:538:736:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:For simplicity, throughout the paper we focus on economies in which at datet=0, in
11:333:24977:18:44:56:531:718:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equilibrium, there is no investment in the inferior technology, that is,K1=k1and ̃k1=0.
11:334:25064:44:29:56:266:674:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:2.3    Discussion of assumptions
11:335:25096:29:21:56:442:645:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Let us briefly discuss some simplifying assumptions made in the model.
11:336:25166:21:18:70:538:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:First, banks invest directly in physical capital, rather than making loans.  This is a fairly
11:337:25259:18:18:56:538:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:common assumption in the financial accelerator literature,  and it essentially consolidates
11:338:25350:18:18:56:538:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:into a unique entity the banks and the firms they lend to. In terms of capturing the problem
11:339:25442:18:18:56:538:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of liability dollarization, this assumption treats in the same way situations in which banks’
11:340:25535:18:18:56:538:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:balance sheets are explicitly mismatched and situations in which they are only implicitly
11:341:25624:18:18:56:538:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mismatched—as happens, for example, when banks borrow in dollars and lend in dollars
11:342:25708:18:21:56:507:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to domestic firms, who are then more likely to default in the event of a depreciation.
11:343:25794:21:18:70:538:495:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Second,  foreign  investors  in  the  model  can  only  hold  tradable  bonds,  an  assumption
11:344:25888:18:18:56:538:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that plays an important role in our analysis, as we will discuss in Section 4.4.  Our results,
11:345:25982:18:18:56:538:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:however, do not require this stark form of segmentation, and they would go through as long
11:346:26072:18:19:56:538:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:as the demand for domestic currency (non-tradable) claims by foreigners is not infinitely
11:347:26161:19:18:56:538:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:elastic.  Ruling out foreign investors’ participation in the domestic currency debt market is

11:349:26283:21:18:70:538:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Third, we are assuming that non-tradables are in fixed endowment.  This simplifies the
11:350:26369:18:18:56:538:365:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:analysis because we do not have to determine how labor is allocated among the two sectors
11:351:26458:18:18:56:538:347:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and only need to keep track of capital accumulation in one sector.  Our main results can
11:352:26546:18:18:56:538:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:also be derived in a more symmetric version of the model with production in both sectors,
11:353:26635:18:43:56:242:311:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:but the analysis is less transparent.

11:356:26787:18:18:56:538:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:First,  we  analyze  the  equilibrium  in  the  last  two  periods,  taking  as  given  assets  and  lia-
11:357:26892:18:18:56:538:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bilities from the previous period.  We call this acontinuation equilibriumand show that, for
11:358:26984:18:18:56:538:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:some initial conditions, multiple continuation equilibria are possible.  In our second step,
11:359:27076:18:18:56:538:166:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we go back to date 0 and complete our equilibrium characterization, focusing, in particular,
11:360:27168:18:18:56:538:148:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on the endogenous denomination of assets and liabilities and on whether the economy can
11:361:27255:18:0:56:482:130:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:endogenously settle on portfolios that produce multiple continuation equilibria.

12:365:27555:18:18:56:538:665:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equilibria  using  two  relations.   The  first  is  an  equilibrium  condition  in  the  non-tradable
12:366:27657:18:43:56:462:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:goods market. The second is an equilibrium condition in the capital market.

13:399:29270:29:21:56:350:707:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In the capital market, three configurations are possible.
13:400:29327:21:18:70:538:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:First,  banks’  net  worth  may  be  large  enough  that  the  collateral  constraint  is  slack.   In
13:401:29429:18:19:56:538:668:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:this case, banks’ optimality requiresβr2=1.  Substituting the rental rater2=αKα−12and
13:402:29514:19:33:56:287:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:solving, we get the first-best level of capital

13:406:29576:36:18:56:538:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Given  that  banks  can  borrow  at  mostβθk2,  this  case  arises  if  banks’  net  worth  satisfies

13:408:29689:21:18:70:538:544:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A  second  scenario  arises  if  the  banks’  collateral  constraint  is  binding,  but  there  is  no

13:410:29881:18:35:56:462:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:this case, the level ofK2can be derived from the bankers’ budget constraint:

13:418:30119:35:19:70:538:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In the third scenario, the bankers’ net worth is so low that there is positive investment in

13:420:30299:18:33:56:269:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:which yields the aggregate capital stock

13:429:30707:21:15:69:538:136:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:11An additional case arises if the net worthn1is negative. Dealing with this case would require specifying

14:446:31202:33:36:184:538:573:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:bN1≤eNb,1,bT1≤θK1,αKα−11≥1/β.(10)
14:447:31235:36:18:70:538:537:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The first inequality means that banks have a non-negative net position in non-tradables,
14:448:31323:18:18:56:538:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:so  a  real  exchange  rate  appreciation  (higherp)  increases  banks’  net  worth  and  leads  to
14:449:31422:18:18:56:538:501:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(weakly) higher investment.  We focus on initial asset positions that satisfy this inequality
14:450:31515:18:21:56:498:483:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:because this is the interesting case that can potentially produce multiple equilibria.
14:451:31601:21:18:70:538:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The other two inequalities are just necessary conditions for the optimality of the bankers

14:455:31934:21:18:70:538:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Combining the three inequalities above implies that the banks’ net worth is always pos-

15:473:33211:21:18:70:538:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Equilibrium multiplicity comes from the positive feedback between banks’ investment
15:474:33294:18:18:56:538:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and  the  real  exchange  rate.   In  turn,  this  positive  feedback  is  due  to  currency  mismatch,
15:475:33397:18:18:56:538:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:namely,  from the inequalityeNb,1>bN1.  This makes it possible to have a self-fulfilling de-
15:476:33489:18:18:56:538:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:preciation: a lowerpcauses a reduction in banks’ net worth; this causes lower investment,
15:477:33578:18:18:56:538:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lower  wages,  and  lower  consumers’  wealth;  finally,  this  causes  a  low  demand  for  non-
15:478:33675:18:21:56:335:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tradables, producing a lower equilibrium value ofp.

16:493:34524:33:18:70:538:703:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The improvement in the current account shows that the domestic banking crisis is asso-
16:494:34610:18:18:56:538:685:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ciated with a capital flight. The capital flight has a double nature: the contraction in invest-
16:495:34706:18:18:56:538:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ment is driven by the reduction in banks’ net worth, while the contraction in consumption
16:496:34795:18:18:56:538:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is driven by lower future wages. The recent literature includes papers that emphasize finan-
16:497:34887:18:18:56:538:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cial constraints (Mendoza, 2010) and lower future income growth (Aguiar and Gopinath,
16:498:34972:18:18:56:538:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2007) as causes of capital account reversals in emerging markets.  Here both mechanisms
16:499:35059:18:21:56:109:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are active.

16:502:35266:18:18:56:538:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lower  because  of  lower  capital  accumulation  and  hence  lower  future  real  wages.  On  the
16:503:35364:18:19:56:538:520:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bankers’ side, the effects are subtler because the rate of return on banks’ net worth is ac-
16:504:35456:19:18:56:538:501:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tually higher in the low-pequilibrium.  However, net worth itself is lower.  The proposition
16:505:35548:18:43:56:415:483:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:gives a sufficient condition under which the latter effect dominates.

17:535:36844:35:18:56:538:461:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f5:is  employed.   Inequality  (13)  atK∗requires  that  at  the  appreciated  exchange  ratep∗=

17:537:37026:18:18:56:538:425:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:K∗>K,  in order for both conditions to be satisfied,  we need the balance sheet effects of

17:539:37207:18:18:56:538:389:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:enough.  In particular, it is immediate to see that both conditions can never be satisfied if
17:540:37300:18:21:56:510:371:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:eNb,1=bN1. In that case, theKschedule is a vertical line and multiplicity is impossible.
17:541:37388:21:18:70:538:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To further illustrate this idea, panel (b) of Figure2 shows what happens if we start from
17:542:37477:18:18:56:538:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the economy in panel (a) and we reducebT1and increasebN1while leaving the value of total

17:548:37993:18:50:56:489:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:positive probability at date 1? This is the question we address in the next section.

17:551:38193:18:18:56:538:119:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sumers’ assets and liabilities.  Our main objective is to show that even though banks can
17:552:38282:18:0:56:538:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:choose ex ante whether to denominate their debt in tradables or non-tradables, this does not
18:553:38376:0:18:56:538:736:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rule out the possibility of multiple continuation equilibria.  That is, even though currency
18:554:38468:18:18:56:538:718:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mismatch in banks’ balance sheets opens the door to “bad” Pareto-dominated equilibria,
18:555:38554:18:18:56:538:700:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:banks  do  not  necessarily  have  sufficient  ex  ante  incentives  to  reduce  their  exchange  rate
18:556:38656:18:21:56:107:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:exposure.
18:557:38665:21:18:70:538:661:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:From now on, whenever we say an “equilibrium” of the model, we are referring to an
18:558:38747:18:18:56:538:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equilibrium of the whole three-period model, as opposed to a continuation equilibrium that
18:559:38837:18:18:56:538:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:starts in period 1.  We will use the following terminology.  We say that an equilibrium is
18:560:38927:18:18:56:538:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:“fragile” if it features multiple continuation equilibria that happen with positive probability
18:561:39022:18:19:56:538:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9:att=1. We say that an equilibrium is “safe” if the equilibrium values of{aT1,aN1,bT1,bN1,K1}
18:562:39114:19:18:56:538:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are  such  that  there  is  a  unique  continuation  equilibrium.   Notice  that  the  requirement
18:563:39212:18:18:56:538:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for  a  safe  equilibrium  is  not  just  that  a  single  continuation  equilibrium  is  selected  with
18:564:39316:18:21:56:462:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:probability 1 att=1, but also that no other continuation equilibrium exists.
18:565:39392:21:18:70:538:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our argument in this section is constructive.  First, we show how to construct examples
18:566:39479:18:18:56:538:495:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of fragile equilibria.  Second, we show that given an economy with a fragile equilibrium,
18:567:39568:18:18:56:538:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the same economy also admits a safe equilibrium and we compare the two equilibria.  At

19:599:40589:18:21:56:509:628:12:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:repayments, isr2−θ. So we get a return of(r2−θ)/(1−βθ)per unit of net worth.13
19:600:40667:21:18:70:538:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:It is useful to remark that when multiple equilibria are possible, the bankers’ marginal
19:601:40755:18:18:56:538:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:utility of wealth is higher in the bad equilibrium, since in that equilibrium capital is scarcer
19:602:40851:18:18:56:538:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and yields a higher rate of return. Therefore, even though bankers are risk neutral, they still
19:603:40946:18:18:56:538:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:perceive a high marginal utility of wealth in states of the world in which their net worth
19:604:41036:18:18:56:538:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is low.  This is a hedging motive that commonly arises in general equilibrium models with
19:605:41125:18:44:56:516:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:financial constraints, as pointed out, for example, in Rampini and Viswanathan (2010).

19:608:41329:18:18:56:538:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equilibria are possible.  Suppose now that we want to construct an equilibrium in which
19:609:41416:18:19:56:538:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the two stable continuation equilibria occur with positive probability.  Given that the price
19:610:41509:19:18:57:538:389:12:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f3:p1is different in the two equilibria and there are only two states of the world att=1,14
19:611:41597:18:18:56:538:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:domestic consumers and bankers have sufficient instruments to achieve perfect risk sharing
19:612:41687:18:18:56:538:353:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:among themselves. This means that the portfolio conditions derived above can be satisfied
19:613:41776:18:18:56:538:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:if and only if the marginal utilities of wealth of consumers and bankers are equalized across
19:614:41869:18:18:56:538:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:states of the world, using the appropriate Pareto weights.  That is, the portfolio conditions
19:615:41962:18:36:56:350:299:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:can be satisfied if and only if there is aΦ>0 such that

19:619:42041:28:21:56:316:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in both the good and the continuation equilibria.
19:620:42090:21:18:70:538:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Can we construct an equilibrium in which the last condition is satisfied?  The answer is
19:621:42178:18:18:56:538:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:yes because both the consumers’ and the bankers’ marginal utilities of wealth are higher if
19:622:42269:18:18:56:538:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the bad equilibrium is realized. Building on this intuition, the next proposition shows how
19:623:42360:18:19:56:525:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to construct a fragile equilibrium and what conditions are required for the construction.
19:624:42449:19:16:69:538:133:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:13The expression is also valid ifr2=1/βand banks are unconstrained.  Then the expression boils down
19:625:42548:16:9:56:410:117:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:toλb,t=1/β, as the return per unit of net worth is simply the interest rate 1/β.
19:626:42628:9:15:69:538:108:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:14To be precise, there are only two payoff-relevant states.  The sunspot is a continuous variable, but it can
19:627:42737:15:0:56:305:93:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:only select one of the two stable continuation equilibria.
20:628:42797:0:18:70:538:736:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:For  simplicity,  we  focus  on  constructing  fragile  equilibria  in  which  non-tradable  posi-
20:629:42895:18:18:56:538:718:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tions are exactly zero and in which, as mentioned above, the collateral constraint is slack

20:655:44298:18:30:56:465:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:librium. The next proposition provides a uniqueness result along these lines.

21:663:44533:29:19:56:538:707:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Suppose  we  have  constructed  an  example  of  an  economy  that  has  a  fragile  equilibrium
21:664:44629:19:18:56:538:688:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:following  the  steps  in  Proposition3.   We  can  then  ask  whether  the  same  economy  also
21:665:44725:18:30:56:469:670:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:admits a safe equilibrium. The next proposition shows that the answer is yes.
21:666:44802:30:18:56:538:640:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:Proposition 5.Take an economy with a fragile equilibrium constructed as in Proposition3.  The
21:667:44895:18:18:56:538:622:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:economy also has a safe equilibrium.  Comparing the safe and the fragile equilibria,  c0and  p0are
21:668:44993:18:33:56:349:604:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:higher and the trade balance is lower in the safe equilibrium.
21:669:45055:33:18:70:538:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The  idea  behind  this  proposition  is  to  take  the  good  continuation  equilibrium  that  is
21:670:45153:18:18:56:538:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:part of the fragile equilibrium under consideration and rearrange the debt composition of
21:671:45242:18:18:56:538:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the bankers in favor of non-tradable debt in order to reduce the currency mismatch in their
21:672:45333:18:18:56:538:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:balance sheet. The logic of Figure2 suggests that this eventually eliminates the multiplicity
21:673:45426:18:18:56:538:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:while  leaving  total  repayments  in  the  good  equilibrium  unchanged.   Because  of  market
21:674:45521:18:18:56:538:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:clearing, this requires an increase in the consumers positions in non-tradable denominated
21:675:45611:18:18:56:538:463:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bonds, as market clearing requiresbN1=aN1.  This can always be done because consumers
21:676:45696:18:18:56:538:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are no longer worried about denominating their saving in non-tradables once the bad equi-
21:677:45785:18:21:56:499:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:librium is eliminated, as the depreciation risk associated with the crisis disappears.
21:678:45871:21:18:70:538:406:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The proposition states that the safe equilibrium has higher consumption and a more ap-
21:679:45957:18:18:56:538:388:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:preciated real exchange rate than the fragile equilibrium. This happens because consumers
21:680:46046:18:18:56:538:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:att=0  are  no  longer  concerned  about  the  bad  equilibrium  outcome,  and  this  reduces
21:681:46139:18:18:56:538:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:their  incentives  to  save.   As  they  choose  higher  consumption  att=0,  their  demand  for
21:682:46235:18:18:56:539:334:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:non-tradables increase, and this pushes up the real exchange rate. The timet=0 choice of
21:683:46323:18:18:56:538:316:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:capital is, however, the same in the two equilibria. Because of full depreciation and inelastic
21:684:46418:18:18:56:538:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:labor,  the  marginal  product  of  capital  at  datet=1  is  state  uncontingent,  which  implies
21:685:46516:18:18:56:538:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that its rate of return is equalized to the rate of return on a bond denominated in tradable
21:686:46608:18:19:56:538:262:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:goods.  This result follows from the fact that the rate of return equals 1/βin both the safe
21:687:46700:19:43:56:191:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and the fragile equilibria.

22:724:47754:18:18:56:538:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(16) can be interpreted as a standard uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) relation,  which
22:725:47845:18:21:56:389:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:compares the returns of bonds denominated in different units.
22:726:47906:21:18:70:538:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In the safe equilibrium, consumers decide to denominate most of their savings in non-
22:727:47991:18:18:56:538:334:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tradables.  Banks absorb the desired pesos savings of consumers and issue tradable bonds
22:728:48079:18:18:56:538:316:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to finance any further shortfall between desired investment and their initial net worth. Be-
22:729:48171:18:18:56:538:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cause most of the banks’ liabilities are denominated in non-tradables, the banks have little
22:730:48263:18:18:56:538:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:currency mismatch on their balance sheets. Indeed, in our example there is no mismatch at
22:731:48352:18:18:56:538:262:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:all(bN1=eNb,1), and the economy has only a unique stable continuation equilibrium at date
22:732:48441:18:18:56:538:244:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:t=1.  This can be appreciated from the fact that consumers’ wages and the real exchange
22:733:48528:18:21:56:175:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rate are not stochastic.
22:734:48552:21:18:70:538:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Why are theset=0 asset choices optimal from the perspective of consumers and banks?
22:735:48635:18:18:56:538:187:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The impossibility of the bad equilibrium at datet=1 means that agents in the economy
22:736:48719:18:18:56:538:169:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:do  not  face  any  risk.   Thus,  the  two  bonds  are  perfect  substitutes  as  their  interest  rate
22:737:48823:18:18:56:538:151:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is  equalized.   In  equilibrium,  this  is  precisely  what  happens  because  of  equation  (16).   It
22:738:48927:18:19:56:538:133:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:follows that in the safe equilibrium,  both consumers and banks are indifferent about the
22:739:49016:19:19:56:472:114:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:denomination of their assets and liabilities, which rationalizes these positions.
22:740:49097:19:0:69:496:95:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:15This condition can be derived by following standard steps from the optimality conditions (14).
23:741:49195:0:18:70:538:736:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In  the  fragile  equilibrium,  consumers  decide  to  denominate  their  savings  in  tradable
23:742:49290:18:18:56:538:718:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:goods(a∗1=0.17,aN1=0.00).  Banks have little access to pesos, and they finance their date
23:743:49379:18:18:56:538:700:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:t=0  operations  by  issuing  debt  denominated  in  tradable  goods.   This  balance  sheet  of
23:744:49475:18:18:56:538:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the banks generates currency mismatch(eNb,1>bN1), and it exposes the economy to a bad
23:745:49560:18:21:56:192:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equilibrium at datet=1.
23:746:49583:21:18:70:538:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The  risk  of  a  bad  equilibrium  at  datet=1  is  what  justifies  the  portfolio  choices  of
23:747:49680:18:18:56:538:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:agents in the economy at datet=0.  From Table1, we can verify that consumers’ lifetime
23:748:49766:18:18:56:538:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:income  is  exposed  to  the  realization  of  the  sunspot  at  datet=1.   Importantly,  the  real
23:749:49865:18:19:56:538:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:exchange rate depreciates when a crisis occurs, generating a negative comovement between
23:750:49953:19:18:56:538:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:consumers’ income and the real exchange rate.  This property of the exchange rate makes
23:751:50040:18:18:56:538:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bonds  denominated  in  tradable  goods  a  “crisis  hedge”  for  consumers,  and  this  justifies
23:752:50138:18:18:56:538:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:their decision to denominate their savings in tradables att=0.  The precautionary motive
23:753:50226:18:18:56:538:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the households is met, in equilibrium, by a riskier balance sheet of the banks, which is
23:754:50317:18:21:56:378:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ultimately what exposes the economy to financial instability.
23:755:50378:21:18:70:538:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Why are banks happy to borrow in tradables and be exposed to exchange rate risk? The
23:756:50462:18:18:56:538:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:answer  is  that  borrowing  in  tradables  is  “cheaper”  for  banks.   This  can  be  seen  by  com-
23:757:50564:18:18:56:538:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:paring  the  interest  rates  of  the  two  bonds.   From  Table1,  we  can  see  that  in  the  fragile
23:758:50668:18:18:56:538:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equilibrium,  the rate of return on bonds denominated in tradables is lower than the one
23:759:50756:18:18:56:538:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on non-tradables.  This deviation from the UIP condition is effectively a result of the con-
23:760:50848:18:18:56:538:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sumers’ unwillingness to save in non-tradables, which in equilibrium bids up the interest
23:761:50937:18:18:56:538:369:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rate  on  these  bonds.   Paradoxically,  this  behavior  generates  in  equilibrium  the  very  risk
23:762:51038:18:21:56:320:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:against which the consumers are trying to insure.
23:763:51087:21:18:70:538:330:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Before continuing, it is useful to further discuss properties of safe and fragile equilibria.
23:764:51180:18:18:56:538:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:As for the safe equilibrium,  we have seen that consumers and banks are indifferent over
23:765:51268:18:18:56:539:294:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:their asset positions att=0.  Because of that, the split between tradable and non-tradable
23:766:51358:18:18:56:538:276:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bonds on the balance sheets of domestic agents is indeterminate, and there is a continuum
23:767:51447:18:18:56:538:258:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of safe equilibria. This is due to the absence of fundamental shocks, which implies that the
23:768:51539:18:21:56:231:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:safe equilibrium is deterministic.
23:769:51573:21:18:70:538:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:As for the fragile equilibrium, it is worth emphasizing that a key assumption underlying
23:770:51661:18:18:56:538:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:its  existence  is  the  presence  of  segmentation  in  financial  markets.  The  segmentation  has
23:771:51761:18:21:56:315:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:both an international and a domestic dimension.
23:772:51808:21:18:70:538:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:At the international level, it is important that some mechanism prevents foreign investors
23:773:51898:18:18:56:538:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from  issuing  non-tradable  denominated  bonds  to  the  local  banks.   To  understand  why,
23:774:51992:18:19:56:538:126:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:consider the fragile equilibrium in Table1 and suppose that we allow foreign investors to
23:775:52081:19:18:56:538:107:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:purchase claims denominated in non-tradables.  Because foreign investors are risk neutral,
23:776:52171:18:0:56:538:89:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:they have an incentive at datet=0 to purchase those claims:  due to the UIP deviation,
24:777:52259:0:18:56:538:736:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:they earn a positive excess return from this strategy. Eventually, this force would eliminate
24:778:52352:18:18:56:538:718:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the fragile equilibrium because, by issuing non-tradable denominated claims, the balance
24:779:52440:18:18:56:538:700:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sheets of local banks become less exposed to exchange rate fluctuations.  Importantly, this
24:780:52531:18:18:56:538:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:argument works only because foreign investors are risk neutral and have deep pockets—
24:781:52616:18:18:56:538:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:assumptions that generate an infinitely elastic supply of funds.  There is ample empirical
24:782:52706:18:18:56:538:646:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:evidence, however, that the supply of foreign capital to emerging market economies is not
24:783:52795:18:19:56:538:628:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:perfectly  elastic.16In  our  paper,  we  consider  the  extreme  view  in  which  the  supply  of
24:784:52893:19:18:56:538:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:foreign  funds  in  “local  currency”  (non-tradables)  is  perfectly  inelastic,  but  this  is  just  a
24:785:52998:18:18:56:538:591:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:useful simplification.  Our results would not be qualitatively different if we were to relax
24:786:53090:18:18:56:538:573:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:this  assumption  and  instead  model  foreign  lenders  as  risk-averse  specialists  that  are  not
24:787:53191:18:21:56:289:555:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:diversified toward the small open economy.
24:788:53233:21:18:70:538:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:At the domestic level, we have assumed that the bankers and the consumers are distinct
24:789:53319:18:18:56:538:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:agents.   This  assumption,  shared  by  recent  papers  such  asBrunnermeier  and  Sannikov
24:790:53411:18:18:56:539:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(2014) andHe and Krishnamurthy(2012), allows us to consider parametrizations in which
24:791:53496:18:18:56:538:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the consumers are relatively more risk averse than the bankers,  which,  from Proposition
24:792:53585:18:18:56:538:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:4, is important in obtaining the fragile equilibrium.  More primitive frictions that limit the
24:793:53679:18:49:56:537:444:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:participation of consumers to asset markets would offer a justification for our assumption.

24:795:53797:34:18:56:538:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:After having characterized the sources of financial instability in this economy, we turn to
24:796:53888:18:18:56:538:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:government intervention.  In this section,  we add to our model a benevolent government
24:797:53975:18:18:56:538:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that intervenes in financial markets att=1. We then study continuation equilibria and find
24:798:54065:18:18:56:538:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:under what conditions government intervention can or cannot eliminate multiplicity. In the
24:799:54155:18:18:56:538:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:next section, we move back to date 0 to analyze the portfolio choice of the government and
24:800:54245:18:43:56:361:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:how it interacts with the private sector’s portfolio choice.

24:802:54362:30:18:56:538:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:At date 1 the government can make a transferTbto banks in exchange for a repaymentR

24:804:54534:18:18:56:538:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:consumers and by borrowing against labor income taxes to be raised att=2 and against

24:806:54701:18:16:69:538:126:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:16For  example,  Borri  and  Verdhelan  (2013)  and  Tourre  (2017)  document  large  risk  premia  in  emerging
24:807:54813:16:11:56:538:110:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:markets’ sovereign bonds, whileDu and Schreger(2016) andMaggiori, Nieman, and Schreger(2017) recently
24:808:54914:11:9:56:374:99:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:document the dominance of dollar denomination in cross-border flows.
24:809:54982:9:0:69:471:90:8:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:17To simplify, we assume that all financial transactions fromt=1 onward are in tradables.

25:811:55166:18:33:56:230:718:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:budget constraints att=1, 2 are
25:812:55197:33:21:245:364:685:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:Tb+T1≤τ1w1−βAT2,
25:813:55213:21:36:230:350:664:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:−AT2+T2≤τ2w2+R.
25:814:55228:36:21:70:468:628:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We make two assumptions that limit the government’s ability to intervene.
25:815:55301:21:18:70:538:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:First, we assume that the government has no superior ability to enforce repayments from
25:816:55388:18:18:56:538:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:banks att=2, so total repayments to the private sector and to the government must satisfy
25:817:55477:18:18:56:181:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the collateral constraint
25:818:55502:18:29:261:333:553:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:bT2+R≤θk2.
25:819:55512:29:18:70:538:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Second,  we  assume  limited  fiscal  capacity  by  imposing  a  limit  on  the  government’s
25:820:55605:18:18:56:196:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ability to raise labor taxes:
25:821:55634:18:27:280:538:488:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:τt≤ξ.(17)
25:822:55643:27:18:56:538:461:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In the Online Appendix, we provide a microfoundation for this assumption by introducing
25:823:55730:18:18:56:538:443:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:an informal sector, completely shielded from taxation, that employs labor and capital and
25:824:55819:18:18:56:538:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in which labor is less efficient by a factor 1−ξ. We then show that constraint (17) needs to
25:825:55911:18:21:56:471:407:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:be satisfied to prevent labor and capital from switching to the informal sector.
25:826:55991:21:18:70:538:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To make the analysis interesting, we assume that at date 0, absent government interven-
25:827:56078:18:18:56:538:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tion, the economy is in a fragile equilibrium in which crises occur with positive probability.
25:828:56172:18:18:56:538:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Moreover, we assume that the capital stock is at its first-best levelK∗in the good continua-
25:829:56264:18:21:56:146:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tion equilibrium.
25:830:56281:21:18:70:538:311:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f5:As in the case of no intervention, tradable consumption is constant in equilibrium,cT1=
25:831:56368:18:18:56:538:293:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:cT2=cT,  and non-tradable consumption is equal to the endowment,cN1=cN2=eN.  The
25:832:56448:18:33:56:511:275:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:government is benevolent, and its objective is to maximize the social welfare function
25:833:56534:33:33:230:538:242:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:(1+β)U(cT,eN) +ΦβcTb,(18)

25:835:56648:18:18:56:538:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:government as a lender of last resort, we set the Pareto weight toΦ=UcT(cT,G,eN), where

25:837:56823:18:18:56:538:155:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This  social  welfare  function  implies  that  the  government  does  not  want  to  redistribute
25:838:56921:18:18:56:538:137:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:resources  between  bankers  and  consumers  under  the  allocations  prevailing  in  the  good
25:839:57016:18:18:56:538:119:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:continuation equilibrium. Because of complete financial markets at date 0, this also implies
25:840:57108:18:0:56:520:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that the government has no redistributive motives in the bad continuation equilibrium.

26:842:57225:29:19:56:538:707:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We now specify the timing of actions by private agents and the government att=1.  We
26:843:57309:19:30:56:228:688:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:split date 1 into two subperiods:
26:844:57342:30:18:73:538:658:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:i.  In the first subperiod, consumers buy non-tradable goods and the non-tradable goods

26:882:58512:18:18:56:168:169:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is defined as follows:
26:883:58534:18:29:243:352:151:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:M=n1+ξw1−βA.
26:884:58546:29:18:70:538:122:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Constraint (19) is the intertemporal resource constraint.  Constraint (20) is the bankers’
26:885:58636:18:18:56:538:104:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:participation constraint and reflects the assumption that the government has no superior
26:886:58724:18:0:56:538:86:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:enforcement capacity. The constraints in (21) and their complementary slackness condition
27:887:58815:0:18:56:538:736:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ensure optimality in the inferior technology sector.  Finally,  the constraints in (22) define
27:888:58909:18:18:56:538:718:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a feasible interval fork2.  The first constraint requires thatk2not be smaller than the level

27:890:59090:18:18:56:538:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:second constraint comes from the assumption of limited fiscal capacity and puts an upper
27:891:59178:18:18:56:538:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bound  on  banks’  investment  in  period  1,  which  depends  on  the  banks’  net  worth  and
27:892:59273:18:18:56:538:646:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the maximum transfer that the government can make.  An important consequence of our
27:893:59356:18:19:56:539:628:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:timing assumptions is that the government takes bothn1andMas given in the problem

28:945:60755:57:18:70:538:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Let us first sketch the formal argument for the proposition and then turn to intuition. In
28:946:60845:18:18:56:538:560:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Figure 3we plot the government’s objective as a function ofk2, choosing all other variables
28:947:60936:18:19:56:538:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:optimally  and  ignoring  the  constraints  in  (22).   To  solve  the  government’s  problem,  we
28:948:61034:19:18:56:538:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:maximize this function, choosingk2in the feasible interval defined by (22).  The function
28:949:61123:18:18:56:538:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:has two local maxima:  one atkBin the regionk2<Kand one atK∗in the regionk2≥K.
28:950:61201:18:18:56:538:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This non-concavity is a general property derived formally in the proof of the proposition
28:951:61290:18:18:56:538:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(in  the  appendix).   To  define  the  cutoffˆM,  we  look  for  thek2=ˆM/(1−βθ)that  is  the
28:952:61384:18:18:56:538:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lowest point in the regionk2≥Kthat yields the same payoff as the local maximum in the
28:953:61469:18:18:56:538:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:regionk2<K.  This construction is illustrated in panel (a) of Figure 3.  Result (1) in the

28:955:61653:18:18:56:538:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:global maximum.  Result (2) considers the caseM>ˆM.  In this case, the global maximum
28:956:61738:18:21:56:179:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is in the regionk2≥K.
28:957:61759:21:18:70:538:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Turning  to  intuition,  let  us  first  understand  why  there  is  a  local  maximum  at  the  bad
28:958:61859:18:18:56:538:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equilibrium investment levelkB2.  Suppose we start at the bad equilibrium and the govern-
28:959:61948:18:18:56:538:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ment  transfers a  dollar to  the banks  by taxing  consumers.  Since  the collateral  constraint
28:960:62045:18:18:56:538:304:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is binding,  banks increasek2bydk2=1/(1−βθ).  Total investmentK2is unaffected,  so
28:961:62127:18:18:56:538:286:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wages are constant.  The present value of total resources increases by(φ−1)dk2because
28:962:62212:18:18:56:538:268:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the production technology of the banks is more efficient than the inferior technology.  The
28:963:62303:18:36:56:490:250:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bankers’ participation constraint (20) requires that bankers’ consumption satisfies

28:968:62412:36:33:56:454:178:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and, using the intertemporal budget constraint andβr2=φ, it follows that

29:978:62824:18:18:56:538:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This shows that, in a neighborhood of the bad continuation equilibrium, the government
29:979:62910:18:18:56:538:387:12:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f9:has no incentive to support the banks. Consistently with this observation, the caseM=M′
29:980:62997:18:18:56:538:369:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:shown in panel (b) of Figure3 is an example in which fiscal capacity is low and the optimal
29:981:63088:18:21:56:189:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:policy is no intervention.

29:994:63416:18:18:56:538:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:last term reflects a pecuniary externality that operates through the wage and is positive as

29:997:63680:18:18:56:538:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:government’s optimal response is to intervene.  The caseM=M′′in panel (b) of Figure3
29:998:63764:18:18:56:538:153:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is an example in which fiscal capacity is high enough that the optimal policy is maximal
29:999:63852:18:21:56:124:135:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:intervention.
29:1000:63865:21:18:70:538:114:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Notice the difference between private and social incentives. Private consumers could also
29:1001:63954:18:0:56:538:96:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:be given the option to make a unilateral transfer to banks, but they would never choose to
30:1002:64046:0:18:56:538:736:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:make it.  The crucial difference between the government and individual consumers is that
30:1003:64134:18:18:56:538:718:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the government internalizes the general equilibrium effects of higher investment on wages.
30:1004:64224:18:21:56:438:700:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:As the argument above shows, this is what makes intervention optimal.
30:1005:64293:21:18:70:538:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Having studied the best response of the government, we can now characterize the equi-

30:1011:64665:18:18:56:538:529:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:intervention.  If  MB≤ˆM, there are at least two stable continuation equilibria:  one with K2=K
30:1012:64760:18:33:56:169:511:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and one with K2=K∗.
30:1013:64779:33:18:70:538:478:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Let  the  functionsN(M,n1)andM(M,n1)denote  the  values  ofMandn1that  come

30:1015:64946:18:18:56:538:442:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:right-hand side.  An equilibrium corresponds to a fixed point of the functionN ×M, that

30:1018:65067:26:33:56:321:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Also, similar to the definition ofMB, let us define

30:1020:65148:36:18:70:538:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To  illustrate  Proposition7  graphically,  we  plotM(M,n1)in  Figure4,  fixingn1at  its

30:1022:65326:18:18:56:538:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:because  Proposition6  shows  that  a  larger  capacity  to  intervene  leads  the  government  to
30:1023:65424:18:18:56:538:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:choose  weakly  higher  levels  forK2andcT.   Now  two  cases  are  possible.   In  panel  (a)  of

30:1025:65608:18:18:56:538:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:government intervention because, under pessimistic expectations about future wages, the
30:1026:65695:18:18:56:538:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:government has insufficient fiscal resources to intervene. And low investment validates the
30:1027:65786:18:18:56:538:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:private sector’s expectations by keeping future wages low. This is represented by pointCin

30:1030:66055:18:18:56:538:130:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that if the government chooses to intervene, the constraintk2≥n1/(1−βθ)is not binding,
30:1031:66141:18:21:56:255:112:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:soM(MG,nG1) =M(MG,nB1) =MG.
30:1032:66168:21:0:70:538:91:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In panel (b) of Figure4, we show the caseMB>ˆM.  In this case, the bad equilibrium

31:1035:66333:34:18:56:538:472:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the economy with no intervention is ruled out because if we start there, the government
31:1036:66423:18:19:56:538:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:has sufficient resources to move the economy to a better allocation. In fact, this condition is
31:1037:66518:19:18:56:538:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sufficient to rule out any equilibrium that does not correspond to the good equilibrium with
31:1038:66610:18:18:56:538:417:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:no intervention. Again, the full argument relies on the fact that the value ofn1/(1−βθ)as
31:1039:66699:18:18:56:538:399:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a lower bound fork2is irrelevant if the government finds it optimal to intervene and go to
31:1040:66789:18:43:56:216:381:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the upper boundM/(1−βθ).
31:1041:66813:43:29:56:161:338:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:5.4    Discussion
31:1042:66830:29:21:56:538:309:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Let us add a few remarks on the assumptions made in modeling government intervention.
31:1043:66915:21:18:70:538:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:First,  in  our  simple  model,  the  government  has  no  incentive  to  intervene  in  a  neigh-
31:1044:67013:18:19:56:538:270:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:borhood of the bad equilibrium.  This is a useful simplification that comes from the way
31:1045:67101:19:18:56:538:251:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we model the inferior technology.  It is possible to enrich the model in order to make the
31:1046:67191:18:18:56:538:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:decision problem of the government smoother, either by introducing richer tax distortions
31:1047:67280:18:18:56:538:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(e.g., via a labor supply margin) or by complicating our model of capital accumulation not
31:1048:67370:18:18:56:538:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:financed by banks.  This could eliminate the non-convexity in the government’s problem
31:1049:67456:18:18:56:538:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and also make some level of intervention optimal in the bad equilibrium. The crucial thing
31:1050:67546:18:18:56:538:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is to have some force that makes the slope of the mapMrelatively low near the bad equi-
31:1051:67633:18:18:56:538:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:librium, so that government intervention near the bad equilibrium is not powerful enough
31:1052:67721:18:21:56:418:125:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to push the economy to uniquely converge to the good equilibrium.
31:1053:67786:21:18:70:538:104:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Second, let us discuss the role of our timing assumptions.  Market clearing in the non-
31:1054:67873:18:0:56:538:86:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tradable  goods  market  and  government  borrowing  happen  in  the  first  subperiod.   This
32:1055:67969:0:18:56:539:736:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:implies  that  the  banks’  net  worth—which  depends  onp1—and  the  government  borrow-
32:1056:68058:18:18:56:538:718:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ing  capacity  are  determined  by  consumers’  expectations  regarding  future  wages,  which
32:1057:68152:18:18:56:538:700:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:depend  on  their  expectations  aboutK2.   When  the  government  intervenes  in  the  second
32:1058:68246:18:18:56:538:682:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:subperiod, the variablesn1andMhave already been determined, so the government must
32:1059:68328:18:18:56:539:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:take them as given even though its interventions will affectK2.  If the model featured the
32:1060:68418:18:18:56:538:646:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:simultaneous determination of government policy and ofwe2andp1, then it would be easy
32:1061:68503:18:30:56:463:628:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for the government to rule out multiplicity, as shown in the following result.
32:1062:68581:30:19:56:538:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:Proposition 8.Consider the model with government intervention, but assume that the actions in
32:1063:68674:19:18:56:538:579:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the first and second subperiods are simultaneous.  Then, the government can uniquely implement
32:1064:68768:18:32:56:317:561:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the first-best allocation. This holds true even ifξ=0.
32:1065:68822:32:19:70:538:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The logic for this result is that a successful lender of last resort is fully self-financed.  If
32:1066:68918:19:18:56:538:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  government  makes  a  large  enough  transfer  to  banks,  investment  goes  up  and  future
32:1067:69015:18:18:56:538:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wage  expectations  increase,  and  this  raises  demand  on  the  non-tradable  market,  leading
32:1068:69112:18:18:56:538:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to an appreciation.  Then banks’ net worth increases, allowing banks to finance the higher
32:1069:69202:18:18:56:538:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:investment level and creating sufficient collateral to repay the government transfer in full.
32:1070:69295:18:18:56:538:438:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:So if everything is simultaneous, the government can switch to the good equilibrium allo-
32:1071:69384:18:21:56:278:420:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cation by making a large enough transfer.
32:1072:69425:21:18:70:538:399:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To meaningfully discuss the relation between fiscal capacity and lending of last resort,
32:1073:69513:18:18:56:538:381:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we need a model that breaks the simultaneity of Proposition8.  Our timing offers a simple
32:1074:69602:18:18:56:538:363:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:way to break the simultaneity. An open area for future research is to explore richer dynamic
32:1075:69694:18:18:56:538:345:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:specifications that capture more realistically the back and forth between government actions
32:1076:69786:18:50:56:286:327:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and market responses in this type of setup.
32:1077:69829:50:34:56:238:277:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:6    The role of reserves
32:1078:69854:34:18:56:538:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We now consider the role of foreign currency reserves. To do so, we allow the government
32:1079:69942:18:18:56:538:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to take positions in tradable and non-tradable bonds at date 0,  so the government enters
32:1080:70031:18:18:56:538:207:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:period 1 with an initial financial positionAT1+p1AN1.  The analysis of the previous section
32:1081:70122:18:18:56:538:189:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:can easily be extended to this case. However, in order to proceed, we need to make assump-
32:1082:70212:18:18:56:538:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tions on how the economy responds at date 0 to the portfolio choices of the government.
32:1083:70299:18:21:56:244:153:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Here we consider two experiments.
32:1084:70332:21:18:70:538:132:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:First,  we  consider  the  case  of  unexpected  interventions.   That  is,  we  assume  the  gov-
32:1085:70430:18:18:56:538:114:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ernment buys the portfolio(AT1,AN1)at date 0, but the private sector does not expect the
32:1086:70518:18:0:56:538:96:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:government to use these resources to intervene in financial markets.  Second, we consider
33:1087:70609:0:18:56:538:736:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the case of fully anticipated interventions.  That is, we assume that the private sector takes
33:1088:70703:18:18:56:538:718:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:into  account  that  the  government  will  use  its  resources  to  intervene  optimally  at  date  1.
33:1089:70806:18:44:56:537:700:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Both exercises are useful in understanding how reserve accumulation affects the economy.
33:1090:70894:44:29:56:257:656:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:6.1    Unexpected interventions
33:1091:70925:29:18:56:538:627:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In our first experiment, we assume that the private sector expects the government to simply
33:1092:71016:18:18:56:538:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:transferAT1+p1AN1back  to  the  consumers  at  date  1.   This  experiment  shows  how  the
33:1093:71107:18:21:56:538:591:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:portfolio(AT1,AN1)changes the government’s ability to credibly act as a lender of last resort.
33:1094:71201:21:18:70:538:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:For this experiment, we need to move in two steps. First, we characterize the equilibrium
33:1095:71290:18:18:56:538:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in which the government buys the portfolio(AT1,AN1)at date 0 but doesnotintervene in
33:1096:71374:18:18:56:538:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:financial markets at date 1. This step gives us agents’ portfolios at date 0. Then, given these
33:1097:71469:18:21:56:453:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:portfolios, we will study “off-equilibrium” optimal interventions at date 1.
33:1098:71545:21:18:70:538:495:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Suppose  we  start  at  the  fragile  equilibrium  of  an  economy  with  no  government  inter-
33:1099:71641:18:18:56:538:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:vention and a zero government portfolio.  If the government buys(AT1,AN1)at date 0 and
33:1100:71727:18:18:56:538:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:transfers the net return back to the consumers at date 1, it is easy to see that there is still a
33:1101:71824:18:19:56:538:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fragile equilibrium, with values ofaT1+AT1andaN1+AN1identical to those of the original
33:1102:71910:19:18:56:538:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equilibrium.  All remaining quantities and prices are unchanged.  This is a standard Ricar-
33:1103:72001:18:18:56:538:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dian  equivalence  result.  The  only  thing  we  need  to  check,  given  that  taxes  are  bounded
33:1104:72101:18:18:56:538:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:by  (17),  is  that  the  government  has  sufficient  fiscal  capacity  to  finance  the  net  value  of
33:1105:72206:18:21:56:480:368:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:(AT1,AN1)in all states of the world. We will take care of this requirement below.
33:1106:72287:21:18:70:538:347:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We can then turn to the off-equilibrium analysis of interventions at date 1.  The analysis
33:1107:72377:18:18:56:538:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the previous section can easily be extended to the case in which the government enters
33:1108:72466:18:18:56:538:311:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:period 1 with a non-zero portfolio(AT1,AN1).  Only two things change.  First, the definition
33:1109:72558:18:33:56:320:293:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the total resources available to banksMis now
33:1110:72606:33:33:163:432:260:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:M=AT1+p1AN1+n1+ξ(1−α)Kα1+βξ(1−α)Kα2.
33:1111:72642:33:33:56:520:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Second, the resource constraint (19) in the government maximization problem becomes
33:1112:72725:33:33:128:467:194:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:(1+β)cT+βcTb≤aT1+AT1−bT1+Kα1+βKα2−k2−φ(K2−k2).
33:1113:72771:33:18:56:538:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:However,  we  just  made  the  argument  that,  in  the  case  of  unexpected  interventions,  the
33:1114:72869:18:18:56:538:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equilibrium value ofaT1+AT1will be the same asaT1in the economy with a zero government
33:1115:72955:18:21:56:454:125:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:portfolio. Therefore, the government maximization problem is unchanged.
33:1116:73026:21:18:70:538:104:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The  fact  that  the  maximization  problem  of  the  government  is  unchanged  implies  that
33:1117:73120:18:0:56:539:86:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the cutoffˆMis equivalent to the case withAT1=AN1studied in Proposition 6. We can then
34:1118:73208:0:30:56:200:736:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:derive the following result.
34:1119:73236:30:18:56:538:706:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:Proposition  9.Take  an  economy  with  a  fragile  equilibrium.   LetˆM  and  MBbe  defined  as  in
34:1120:73336:18:33:56:435:688:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Propositions 6and7. Suppose the portfolio(AT1,AN1)satisfies the inequalities
34:1121:73412:33:21:133:538:655:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:AT1+pB1AN1>ˆM−MB,(26)
34:1122:73433:21:21:132:538:634:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:AT1+pG1AN1>−ξ(1−α)[Kα1+β(K∗)α],(27)
34:1123:73468:21:33:119:538:613:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:qT0AT1+qN0AN1<βE[AT1+p1AN1] +ξ(1−α)E[Kα0+βKα1+β2Kα2].(28)
34:1124:73525:33:18:56:538:580:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Then, given the positions(AT1,AN1), the good equilibrium is the unique continuation equilibrium
34:1125:73620:18:33:56:205:562:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:with government intervention.
34:1126:73649:33:16:70:538:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f10:To provide an interpretation of this result, consider the interesting case in whichMB<
34:1127:73735:16:20:61:538:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ˆM,  so optimal government intervention withAT1=AN1=0 is not sufficient to eliminate
34:1128:73819:20:21:56:310:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the bad equilibrium, as shown in Proposition7.
34:1129:73865:21:18:70:538:472:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Now  suppose  the  government  borrows  in  non-tradables  to  finance  the  accumulation
34:1130:73954:18:18:56:538:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of  reserves  denominated  in  tradables,  taking  positionsAT1>0>AN1,  and  assume  that
34:1131:74043:18:18:56:538:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:these positions yield a zero average payoffE[AT1+p1AN1] =0.  Given thatpG1>pB1,  the
34:1132:74127:18:19:56:538:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:government makes a net gain in the bad state and a net loss in the good state.  Moreover,
34:1133:74216:19:18:56:538:399:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:given that tradable bonds pay a lower expected return than non-tradable bonds in a fragile

34:1139:74749:18:18:56:538:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:post effects of reserve accumulation:  reserves allow the government to hedge against the
34:1140:74838:18:18:56:538:270:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bad  equilibrium  state  and,  by  boosting  the  government’s  resources  in  that  state,  end  up

34:1142:74969:21:18:70:538:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The results above provide a rationale for some recent empirical findings.Obstfeld, Sham-

34:1151:75520:9:12:56:538:123:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:condition (27) ensures that the government has sufficient fiscal capacity to cover the portfolio losses in the

35:1155:75869:18:30:56:321:718:12:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:conditions in Proposition9 imply the following:19

35:1157:76005:18:33:56:493:670:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the one with more bank debt requires a higher value of AT1to rule out the bad equilibrium.

35:1160:76252:21:30:70:304:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A second remark comes out of our analysis.

35:1163:76440:33:18:70:538:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:When  the  conditions  in  Proposition9  are  satisfied,  the  government  doesn’t  intervene

35:1165:76622:18:18:56:538:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reserves is important to rule out the bad equilibrium.  This remark connects our analysis
35:1166:76711:18:18:56:538:463:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to  another  empirical  observation:   emerging  markets  seem  to  hold  on  to  their  stocks  of
35:1167:76810:18:18:56:538:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reserves, even in times of distress.Aizenman and Sun(2012) provide evidence of this type
35:1168:76898:18:18:56:538:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of behavior—which they dub “fear of losing international reserves”—looking at emerging
35:1169:76984:18:44:56:337:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:economies’ response to the global downturn of 2009.

35:1171:77067:29:18:56:538:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We now consider the case of a fully expected intervention, that is, we assume that agents
35:1172:77156:18:18:56:538:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:correctly anticipate that the government will use reserves optimally att=1 to eliminate
35:1173:77243:18:21:56:165:300:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the bad equilibrium.
35:1174:77263:21:18:70:538:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Suppose, in particular, that we start at a fragile equilibrium and the government takes
35:1175:77350:18:19:56:538:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:positions that satisfy the conditions in Proposition9.  If all agents correctly anticipate that
35:1176:77445:19:18:56:538:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the government will intervene and eliminate the bad equilibrium, the positions they take at
35:1177:77536:18:18:56:538:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:date 0 will adjust. In particular, it is possible to show that there is an equilibrium in which
35:1178:77631:18:18:56:538:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the values ofbT1−AT1andbN1−AN1are equal to the values ofbT1andbN1in the safe equi-
35:1179:77713:18:18:56:538:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:librium constructed in Proposition5 and the conditions of Proposition9 are satisfied,  so
35:1180:77802:18:18:56:538:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:there is a unique (good) continuation equilibrium. This means that the consolidated dollar
35:1181:77892:18:18:56:538:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:debt of the banks and the government is lower, and their consolidated peso debt is larger
35:1182:77981:18:19:56:538:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relative to the original fragile equilibrium. In other words, increased dollar holdings by the

36:1186:78292:18:30:56:222:718:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:this finding in the next remark.
36:1187:78324:30:18:56:538:688:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:Remark 3(Catalytic reserves).When reserves are large enough to eliminate the bad equilibrium,
36:1188:78417:18:33:56:521:670:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:their presence can lead to a higher net consolidated dollar position of banks and the government.
36:1189:78514:33:18:70:538:637:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Here the interesting observation is that banks do not have incentives to undo the positive
36:1190:78604:18:18:56:538:619:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:foreign  currency  position  of  the  government  by  borrowing  more  in  foreign  currency.   In
36:1191:78702:18:18:56:538:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:other words, the presence of credible intervention at datet=1 does not induce more risk
36:1192:78789:18:18:56:539:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:taking by banks att=0 as the usual moral hazard logic would suggest, and anticipated
36:1193:78873:18:21:56:335:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:government rescues do not lead to more risk taking.
36:1194:78924:21:18:70:538:544:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To understand the logic behind this result, it is useful to identify two opposing channels
36:1195:79014:18:21:56:440:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:through which government intervention affects banks’ behavior ex ante.
36:1196:79084:21:18:70:538:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:First, if we fix the interest rates in tradables and non-tradables at date 0, there is a direct
36:1197:79179:18:18:56:538:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:effect  of  intervention  that  leads  banks  to  issue  more  tradable  debt.   The  argument  is  as
36:1198:79281:18:19:56:538:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:follows.  As argued in Section4, the presence of the bad equilibrium gives banks an incen-
36:1199:79371:19:18:56:538:450:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tive to borrow less in tradables, as the marginal value of net worth is higher and tradable
36:1200:79462:18:18:56:538:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:debt  increases  in  value  in  the  bad  equilibrium.   Therefore,  when  the  bad  equilibrium  is
36:1201:79562:18:18:56:538:414:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:removed, the incentive to borrow in tradables goes up. This is the traditional moral hazard
36:1202:79653:18:18:56:538:396:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mechanism, where reducing the risk to which banks are exposed (by eliminating the bad
36:1203:79738:18:21:56:317:378:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equilibrium) would lead to increased risk taking.
36:1204:79787:21:18:70:538:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Second, there is a general equilibrium effect that works in the opposite direction. When
36:1205:79875:18:18:56:538:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:government interventions remove the bad equilibrium, domestic savers are no longer con-
36:1206:79962:18:18:56:538:321:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cerned about a large depreciation correlated to a contraction in consumption. Hence, savers
36:1207:80053:18:18:56:538:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:will demand more non-tradable denominated assets.  This force pushes down the interest
36:1208:80139:18:18:56:538:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rate differential between tradable and non-tradable denominated debt and induces banks
36:1209:80225:18:21:56:233:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to borrow more in non-tradables.
36:1210:80257:21:18:70:538:246:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our argument above shows that the general equilibrium effect dominates in our econ-
36:1211:80340:18:50:56:81:228:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:omy.
36:1212:80344:50:34:56:172:178:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:7    Conclusion
36:1213:80359:34:18:56:538:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our  model  provides  a  novel  perspective  on  financial  dollarization  in  emerging  markets,
36:1214:80456:18:18:56:538:126:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:pointing out the interaction between financial instability and the precautionary motive of
36:1215:80546:18:18:56:538:108:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:domestic savers. We have used our model to study the ex post and ex ante effects of lending
36:1216:80637:18:0:56:538:90:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of last resort, introducing a notion of fiscally credible interventions.  Our analysis provides
37:1217:80734:0:18:56:538:736:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a rationale for the view that official foreign currency reserves support financial stability, as
37:1218:80830:18:21:56:500:718:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:they improve the credibility of domestic authorities to intervene in financial panics.
37:1219:80916:21:21:70:512:697:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our model is very stylized and abstracts from a numer of interesting policy issues.
37:1220:80999:21:18:70:538:676:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:First,  we  leave  aside  the  role  of  monetary  policy.   Our  model  can  be  interpreted  as
37:1221:81096:18:18:56:538:658:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:making  the  implicit  assumption  that  the  domestic  monetary  authority  is  committed  to
37:1222:81190:18:18:56:538:640:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:keep the price of non-tradables stable. It would be interesting to model explicitly monetary
37:1223:81282:18:18:56:538:622:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:policy  in  an  environment  with  nominal  rigidities,  to  capture  important  dilemmas  faced
37:1224:81378:18:18:56:538:604:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:by monetary policy both ex post and ex ante.  Ex post,  the monetary authority faces the
37:1225:81466:18:18:56:538:586:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:problem  that  a  monetary  expansion  causes  a  nominal  devaluation,  which  increases  the
37:1226:81560:18:18:56:538:568:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:burden of dollar debt. Ex ante, the monetary authority faces the problem that agents taking
37:1227:81651:18:19:56:538:550:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:domestic currency positions are afraid of future inflation in financial crises. We leave these
37:1228:81745:19:20:56:188:531:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:issues to future research.
37:1229:81771:20:19:70:538:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Second, in our paper, the role of foreign currency reserves is to boost the fiscal position
37:1230:81862:19:18:56:538:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the domestic government in the event of a crisis.  There are additional reasons why dol-
37:1231:81953:18:18:56:538:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lar reserves can help support a financial system in distress.  In particular, currency market
37:1232:82046:18:18:56:538:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:interventions can be used to dampen movements in the exchange rate, reducing the bur-
37:1233:82131:18:18:56:538:438:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:den of foreign currency debt.20Capturing this role would require introducing additional
37:1234:82218:18:21:56:470:420:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:frictions in currency markets, which is outside the scope of the present paper.
37:1235:82297:21:18:70:538:399:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The central mechanism of our paper is that private savers do not internalize the effect
37:1236:82384:18:18:56:538:381:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of their portfolio choices on the financial fragility of the economy. The logic of this mecha-
37:1237:82478:18:18:56:538:363:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nism can be extended beyond the specific environment considered here, where savers only
37:1238:82565:18:18:56:538:345:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:choose the currency composition of their portfolio. In ongoing work, we explore this mech-
37:1239:82655:18:18:56:538:327:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:anism in a more general dynamic macro-financial model in which borrowers and lenders
37:1240:82739:18:207:56:480:309:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:trade state contingent claims, and study its implications for aggregate volatility.

37:1242:82926:16:0:56:193:86:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:reduce exchange rate volatility.
