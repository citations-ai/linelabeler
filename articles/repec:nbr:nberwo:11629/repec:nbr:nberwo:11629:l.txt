2:20:781:29:46:273:338:623:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:?:ABSTRACT
2:21:789:46:22:72:537:577:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:For 200 years the average number of hours worked per worker declined, both in the market place
2:22:883:22:24:72:537:555:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:and at home. Technological progress is the engine of such transformation. Three mechanisms are
2:23:977:24:22:72:113:531:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:stressed:
2:24:986:22:24:72:366:509:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:(i) The rise in real wages and its corresponding wealth effect;
2:25:1049:24:22:72:519:485:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:(ii) The enhanced value of time off from work, due to the advent of time-using leisure goods;
2:26:1142:22:23:72:494:463:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:(iii) The reduced need for housework, due to the introduction of time-saving appliances.
2:27:1230:23:18:72:540:440:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:These  mechanisms  are  incorporated  into  a  model  of  household  production.  The  notion  of
2:28:1327:18:18:72:540:422:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:Edgeworth-Pareto complementarity/substitutability is key to the analysis. Numerical examples link

3:44:1880:0:41:72:145:671:17:g_d0_f5:17:g_d0_f5:C:1  Facts
3:45:1888:41:29:72:539:630:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Over the course of the last century there was a precipitous drop in the average length of
3:46:1977:29:29:72:539:601:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the workweek, both in the marketplace and at home.  In 1830 the average workweek in
3:47:2060:29:29:72:539:572:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the market place was 70 hours. This had plunged to just 41 hours by 2002. At the same
3:48:2145:29:29:72:539:543:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:time there was a 9-fold gain in real wages. Figure 1 shows the descent in the length of the
3:49:2236:29:29:72:539:514:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:market workweek and the leap forward in real wages. Likewise, the amount of time spent
3:50:2322:29:28:72:539:485:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:on housework has dropped. A famous study of Middletown, Indiana, documented in 1924
3:51:2405:28:29:72:539:457:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:that 87 percent of housewives spent more than 4 hours per day on housework ñsee Figure
3:52:2491:29:29:72:539:428:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:2. None spent less than 1 hour. By 1999 only 14 percent toiled more than 4 hours per day
3:53:2579:29:29:72:345:399:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in the home, while 33 percent spent less than 1 hour.
3:54:2632:29:29:89:539:370:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:This decline in hours worked, both in the market and home, was met by a rise in leisure.
3:55:2720:29:29:72:539:341:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:One measure of the increase in leisure is the uptrend in the share of personal consumption
3:56:2810:29:29:72:539:312:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:expenditure spent on recreation. This rose from 3 percent in 1900 to 8.5 percent in 2001, as
3:57:2902:29:29:72:539:283:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Figure 3 illustrates. Additionally, the amount of time that a person needs to work in order
3:58:2993:29:29:72:539:254:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:to buy the goods used in leisure has fallen by at least 2.2 percent a year ñreal wages grew
3:59:3084:29:28:72:539:225:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:at an annual rate of 1.65 percent over the 1901 to 1988 period. This price decline neglects
3:60:3175:28:29:72:539:197:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the fact that many new forms of leisure goods have become available over time, or that old
3:61:3265:29:29:72:539:168:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:forms have gotten better. As the workweek ñor the time spent on work both in the market
3:62:3352:29:29:72:539:139:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and at home ñwas dropping, more and more women were entering into the market place to
3:63:3437:29:29:72:539:110:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:work. This may seem a little paradoxical. Only 4 percent of married women worked in 1890
3:64:3525:29:0:72:374:81:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:as compared with 49 percent in 1980 ñagain, see Figure 2.

5:122:4363:29:0:72:151:232:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of leisure goods
6:123:4380:0:29:89:539:671:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:What can explain these facts? The answer is nothing mysterious: technological progress.
6:124:4467:29:29:72:539:642:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Three channels of e§ect will be stressed here. First, technological progress increases wages.
6:125:4560:29:29:72:539:613:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:On the one hand, an increase in real wages should motivate more work e§ort since the price
6:126:4650:29:29:72:539:584:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of consumption goods in terms of forgone leisure has fallen. On the other hand, for a given
6:127:4741:29:29:72:539:555:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:level of work e§ort a rise in wages implies that individuals are wealthier. People may desire
6:128:4834:29:29:72:539:526:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:to use some of this increase in living standards to enjoy more leisure. Second, the value
6:129:4923:29:29:72:539:497:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of not working has also risen due to the advent of many new leisure goods. Leisure goods
6:130:5011:29:28:72:539:468:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:by their very nature aretime using.  Think about the impact of the following products:
6:131:5097:28:29:72:539:440:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:radio, 1919; monopoly, 1934; television, 1947; videocassette recorder, 1979; Nintendo and
6:132:5186:29:29:72:539:411:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Trivial Pursuit, 1984. Third, other types of new household goods have reduced the need for
6:133:5276:29:29:72:539:382:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:housework. These household goods aretime saving. Examples are: electric stove, 1900; iron,

7:151:6329:29:29:71:538:482:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:time and goods, just as are market ones, was introduced in classic work on household pro-

9:215:8468:47:29:72:539:358:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Therefore, time spent on household activities will rise or fall depending on whether time
9:216:8557:29:29:72:539:329:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and goods are complements or substitutes in household utility. When time and purchased

9:218:8734:29:29:72:539:271:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:time spent at home should rise. Leisure goods, such as the television, fall into this category.
9:219:8829:29:29:72:539:242:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Such goods have contributed to the decline inwork(either in the market place or at home)
9:220:8917:29:29:72:539:213:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:by both men and women. A detailed account of how this mechanism can contribute to the
9:221:9002:29:29:72:539:184:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:long-run decline in hours worked is provided by Vandenbroucke (2005). This case is shown
9:222:9090:29:29:72:539:155:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in Figure 4 by a rightward shift in the marginal beneÖt curve from MB to MBî, resulting in
9:223:9180:29:28:72:539:126:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:time spent at home rising froml-tol00. The opposite is true when they are substitutes. This
9:224:9271:28:0:71:538:98:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:is portrayed in the Ögure by the leftward movement in the marginal beneÖt curve from MB
10:225:9359:0:29:72:539:671:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:to MBí. Time-saving household appliances, such as the microwave oven, are an example of
10:226:9446:29:29:72:539:642:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:this case. Such products have reduced the need for housework and have contributed to the
10:227:9534:29:29:72:539:613:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:increase in market work by women. Greenwood, Seshadri and Yorukoglu (2005) show how
10:228:9617:29:29:72:539:584:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the increase in female labor-force participation can be explained along these lines. Therefore,
10:229:9712:29:29:72:539:555:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:technological advance in household products is consistent with the long-run decline in the
10:230:9802:29:29:72:539:526:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:market workweek (leisure goods) and the rise in female labor-force participation (time-saving
10:231:9895:29:29:72:189:497:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:appliances and goods).

11:279:12595:29:0:72:539:72:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f10:F:In physical units, households in 1995 had 6.90 times more leisure goods than did households

12:297:13510:29:29:71:538:274:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:On the other hand, higher wages make the individual wealthier. The individual should use

12:300:13767:29:28:71:538:187:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:depending on whether the income e§ect dominates the substitution e§ect. In general, then,
12:301:13856:28:42:71:469:159:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:anything can happen, as the following two specialized cases forUmake clear.
12:302:13931:42:29:86:539:117:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:1. LetU(c) = lnc, the macroeconomistís favorite utility function. Here,U1= 1=cand

13:304:14091:0:29:101:539:671:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:in wages exactly cancel out.  Long-run changes in wages have no impact on hours
13:305:14170:29:38:101:171:642:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:worked,1-l.
13:306:14181:38:29:86:539:604:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:2. SupposeU(c) = ln(c-c), wherec>0is some subsistence level of consumption. Now,

13:313:14409:29:29:101:539:517:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:simple. At low levels of wages an individual must work hard to meet his subsistence
13:314:14492:29:29:101:539:488:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:level of consumption,c. Covering the subsistence level of consumption becomes easier
13:315:14576:29:29:101:539:459:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:as wages rise and this allows an individual to let up on his work e§ort. Thus, this
13:316:14659:29:29:101:539:430:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:form for the utility function is in accord with a long-run decline in hours worked.
13:317:14742:29:29:101:539:401:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Additionally, it is consistent with the observation reported in Vandenbroucke (2005)
13:318:14826:29:28:101:539:372:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:that unskilled workers labored longer hours in 1900 than did skilled ones, while today
13:319:14912:28:40:101:238:344:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:they work about the same.
13:320:14937:40:29:89:539:304:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Can an increase in wages explain the decline in the workweek? The answer is yes, as the

15:378:17043:29:29:72:538:533:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f12:F:on hours worked, because the substitution and income e§ects exactly cancel out. Whenc= 0

15:381:17305:29:29:71:538:446:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f10:F:rise in taxes will cause hours worked to move up. Here the negative income e§ect from the
15:382:17394:29:29:71:538:417:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f10:F:increase in government spending, which will result in more hours being worked, outweighs the
15:383:17486:29:29:71:538:388:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f10:F:substitution e§ect. Therefore, in general the e§ect of labor income taxation on hours worked
15:384:17578:29:29:71:538:359:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f10:F:is ambiguous. The result will depend on how the government uses the revenue it raises, and
15:385:17668:29:28:71:447:330:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f10:C:the functional forms and parameter values used for tastes and technology.

15:388:17911:29:29:71:538:244:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f10:F:by the National Income Product Accounts. By following the procedure in Example 2, it can
15:389:17999:29:29:71:539:215:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f10:F:be deduced that the observed fall in hours worked is obtained when-= 2:86andc= 0:20.
15:390:18083:29:29:71:538:186:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f10:F:Furthermore, it can be inferred that the rise in wages accounts for 93 percent of the fall,
15:391:18174:29:38:71:383:157:12:g_d0_f10:8:g_d0_f6:C:while the increase in taxes explains the remaining 7 percent.1

16:397:18560:29:29:72:539:613:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:have on hours worked will depend upon the particulars of the model used. A serious study
16:398:18648:29:29:72:236:584:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:is conducted in Prescott (2004).
16:399:18680:29:29:89:539:555:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:The real world seems to have had two conáicting trends: a decline in market work, and
16:400:18765:29:29:72:539:526:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:a rise in female-labor participation. A more general model could be consistent with both
16:401:18853:29:29:72:539:497:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of these facts. To see this, imagine a framework with two types of labor, male and female.
16:402:18943:29:28:72:539:468:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:There is a division of labor in the home. Men work primarily in the market. Females do
16:403:19029:28:29:72:539:440:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:housework and, time permitting, market work. Households purchase both time-saving and
16:404:19114:29:29:72:539:411:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:time-using household inputs.  Female labor-force participation would rise as labor-saving
16:405:19203:29:29:72:539:382:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:goods economized on the amount of housework that had to be done. Simultaneously, the
16:406:19287:29:29:72:539:353:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:market workweek could decline, either due to the introduction of leisure goods or an income
16:407:19378:29:29:72:539:324:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:e§ect associated with a rise in wages. The value of leisure would rise for both men and
16:408:19465:29:29:72:539:295:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:women.  Interestingly, Aguiar and Hurst (2005) document a dramatic increase in leisure
16:409:19551:29:29:72:539:266:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:for both men and women over the period 1965 to 2003. They construct various measures of
16:410:19638:29:29:72:539:237:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:leisure. They all showed a gain over the period under study. The narrowest deÖnition rose by
16:411:19730:29:28:72:539:208:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:6.4 hours a week for men and 3.8 hours for women, after adjusting for demographic changes
16:412:19819:28:29:72:539:180:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in the population. This measure included time spent on activities such as entertainment,
16:413:19907:29:29:72:539:151:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:recreation, and relaxing. Their preferred measure increased by 7.9 hours a week for men
16:414:19994:29:22:72:539:122:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and 6.0 hours for women. This broader deÖnition also included activities such as eating,

17:417:20279:0:29:72:539:671:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:sleeping, personal care, and child care. Another manifestation of the rise in the value of
17:418:20369:29:29:72:539:642:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:leisure is the increase in the fraction of life spent retired.  Kopecky (2005) relays that a
17:419:20461:29:29:72:539:613:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:twenty-year-old man in 1850 could expect to spend about 6 percent of his life retired, while
17:420:20553:29:29:72:539:584:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:one in 1990 should enjoy about 30 percent of his life in retirement. She shows how the trend
17:421:20645:29:29:72:539:555:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:toward enjoying more retirement can be analyzed in much the same way as the decline in
17:422:20731:29:40:72:145:526:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the workweek.
