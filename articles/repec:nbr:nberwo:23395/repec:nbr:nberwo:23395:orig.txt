2:37:2319:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:We  document  the  intergenerational  mobility  of  black  and  white  American  men  from  1880 
2:38:2416:14:14:72:545:574:12:Times:12:Times:through 2000  by  building  new  datasets  to  study  the  late  19th  and  early  20th  century  and 
2:39:2517:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:combining them with modern data to cover the mid- to late 20th century. We find large disparities 
2:40:2614:14:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:in  intergenerational  mobility, with  white  children  having  far  better  chances  of  escaping  the 
2:41:2717:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:bottom  of  the  distribution  than  black children  in  every  generation.  This  mobility  gap  was  more 
2:42:2824:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:important than the gap in parents’ status in proximately determining each new generation’s racial 
2:43:2921:14:42:72:513:504:12:Times:12:Times:income gap. Evidence suggests that human capital disparities underpinned the mobility gap.

3:60:3397:0:21:108:528:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: In 1870, five years after the Civil War and Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery in 
3:61:3483:21:21:72:506:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the United States, African Americans’ income per capita was approximately 28 percent of 
3:62:3571:21:20:72:538:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:whites’ income (Margo 2016).  By 2010, the black/white income ratio had risen to  64 percent, a 
3:63:3667:20:21:72:524:647:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:convergence that   remains woefully incomplete and    that   has  far -reaching social ramifications.  
3:64:3770:21:21:72:536:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:This paper quantifies the role of intergenerational mobility in determining the relative economic 
3:65:3868:21:21:72:517:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:status of black men over more than 100 years, from the end of Reconstruction, when federal 
3:66:3959:21:20:72:527:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:troops left the South, to the beginning of the 21st century.1  In particular, for several cohorts of 
3:67:4060:20:21:72:506:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:father-son pairs, we measure the extent to which black men’s relatively poor labor market 
3:68:4149:21:21:72:536:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:outcomes reflected their father’s disadvantaged economic status as opposed to racial differences 
3:69:4246:21:20:72:281:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in outcomes conditional on fathers’ status.  
3:70:4291:20:21:108:524:502:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Our data encompass nearly the full span of blacks’ struggle for economic and political 
3:71:4378:21:21:72:525:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:progress since the Civil War, including the rise of discriminatory “Jim Crow” institutions, the 
3:72:4474:21:20:72:524:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Great Migration of African Americans from the South, and the Civil Rights revolution and its 
3:73:4567:20:21:72:537:440:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:aftermath.  De veloping an intergenerational perspective over the long run requires information 
3:74:4663:21:21:72:531:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:that  is  simply unavailable in census microdata, which are the foundation for most studies of the 
3:75:4762:21:21:72:524:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:U.S. labor market before the 1960s.  To overcome the most binding limitations, we have built 
3:76:4855:21:20:72:544:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:new intergenerational datasets by linking individuals’ census records from    1880 to 1900, and 
3:77:4951:20:21:72:532:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:again   , for a different set of individuals, from 1910 to 1930.  Linked census records are essential 
3:78:5053:21:21:72:539:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in t his early period because no other representative datasets contain information on both parents’ 
3:79:5153:21:20:72:519:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and children’s labor market outcomes (e.g., Ferrie 2005, Abramitzky, Boustan, and Eriksson 
3:80:5244:20:21:72:517:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:2012, Long and Ferrie 2013, Feigenbaum 2017).2  For the post-1930 period, we use modern 
3:81:5332:21:21:71:540:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:datasets with intergenerational information to complete the portrait of blacks’ economic mobility 
3:82:5430:21:20:71:541:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in comparison to whites.  Specifically, we rely on the Occupational Changes in a Generation data 
3:83:5527:20:21:71:536:233:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(OCG), which were collected in 1962 and 1973, and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 
3:84:5619:21:21:71:452:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:1979 data (NLSY79), which follow a young cohort from 1979 into adulthood.  
3:85:5694:21:21:107:511:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Our main metrics of mobility compare each son’s estimated position in the national 
3:86:5776:21:35:71:533:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:earnings distribution to his father’s position in the distribution decades earlier.  This rank-based 
3:87:5877:35:9:72:219:135:133:g_d0_f3:133:g_d0_f3:                                                   
3:88:5928:9:16:72:502:126:48:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:1 The paper’s title derives from Booker T. Washington’s Up from Slavery (1901), which describes his 
3:89:6028:16:8:72:509:110:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:extraordinary rise from slavery to national prominence as the leader of Alabama’s Tuskegee Institute.    
3:90:6133:8:16:72:529:102:48:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:2 Studies using linked census records have focused on men because names are central to the linking process, 
3:91:6241:16:12:71:536:86:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:and women’s names change at marriage.  Because the complete census manuscripts (including names) are not 
3:92:6346:12:0:71:497:74:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:accessible after 1940, the linking methods we describe can only be used to build historical samples.   
4:93:6459:0:21:72:525:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:approach follows Dahl and DeLeire (2008), Mazumder (2014), and Chetty et al. (2014a,b).  It 
4:94:6551:21:21:72:531:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:conforms to notions of “moving up” or “falling behind” relative to one’s peers from generation 
4:95:6646:21:20:72:540:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:to generation, and it dovetails with the economics literature’s longstanding emphasis on studying 
4:96:6744:20:21:72:520:647:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:changes in blacks’ relative status (Smith and Welch 1989, Donohue and Heckman 1991, and 
4:97:6832:21:21:72:530:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Margo 2016).3  Because the Census of Population did not collect income data before 1940, our 
4:98:6925:21:21:72:525:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:measures of economic status are necessarily based on what we know about the men’s detailed 
4:99:7016:21:20:72:507:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:occupation, race, and location; this entails an “earnings score” assignment process that we 
4:100:7108:20:21:72:156:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:describe below.   
4:101:7125:21:21:108:532:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:In each generation, we find large racial differences in sons’ economic status conditional 
4:102:7215:21:20:72:542:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:on their fathers’ economic status; in particular, the children of low-status white families have had 
4:103:7316:20:21:72:535:502:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:much higher rates of upward mobility than similarly situated blacks since 1880.  Based on these 
4:104:7412:21:21:72:533:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:data, we conclude that it was not only, or even primarily, poverty per se that limited the pace of 
4:105:7511:21:20:72:498:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:blacks’ economic progress in the historical samples.  Rather, our results indicate a sharp 
4:106:7602:20:21:72:530:440:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:disadvantage for black sons relative to whites in the likelihood of escaping the bottom ranks of 
4:107:7699:21:21:72:519:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the income distribution.  It is striking that in the historical samples (1880-1900 and 1910-30) 
4:108:7795:21:21:72:525:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:children from the poorest southern white families could expect, on average, to be better off as 
4:109:7891:21:20:72:516:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:adults than children from even the best off black families.  It is also striking that large racial 
4:110:7990:20:21:72:531:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:differences in economic mobility, conditional on parents’ status, continued into the post-World 
4:111:8086:21:21:72:536:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:War II era despite the Great Migration and the passage of Civil Rights legislation.  For instance, 
4:112:8185:21:20:72:517:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:conditional on father’s occupational status, the black-white gap in son’s expected status was 
4:113:8279:20:21:71:519:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:comparable in 1973, nearly a decade after the Civil Rights Act, to what it was in 1900, at the 
4:114:8374:21:21:71:176:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:height of Jim Crow.   
4:115:8396:21:20:107:511:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:These racial differences in mobility cannot be accounted for by differences in other 
4:116:8481:20:21:71:541:233:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:readily observable characteristics of families, such as parents’ education or  location, and they are 
4:117:8583:21:21:71:534:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:empirically important.4  Racial differences in intergenerational mobility account for most of the 
4:118:8681:21:32:72:559:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:black -white   gap in men’s labor market outcomes at any point in time.     That is, in each generation 
4:119:8785:32:9:72:219:159:133:g_d0_f3:133:g_d0_f3:                                                   
4:120:8836:9:15:72:541:150:48:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:3 We recognize that absolute real income gains are  also of interest, though they are even more difficult to study 
4:121:8951:15:13:72:529:135:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:given limitations of historical wage and price data.  Also, the data are not well-suited to estimating unbiased 
4:122:9063:13:12:72:514:122:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:intergenerational income elasticities for direct comparison with modern studies, though we present some 
4:123:9167:12:8:72:227:110:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:relevant evidence later in the paper.  
4:124:9206:8:16:72:510:102:48:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:4 Later in the paper, we discuss Mazumder (2014), which finds that the   black-white gap in likelihood of 
4:125:9312:16:12:71:534:86:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:transitioning from the bottom quintile in modern data can be partly accounted for by differences in test scores 
4:126:9424:12:0:71:173:74:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:and other observables.   
5:127:9459:0:21:72:501:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:that   we observe, when black children are allowed to transition up or down the income 
5:128:9546:21:21:72:536:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:distribution in the same way as white children with similarly situated parents, the counterfactual 
5:129:9644:21:20:72:532:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:black -white gap in their adult outcomes is a small fraction of the actual gap.  For perspective, if 
5:130:9745:20:21:72:534:647:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:black children had transitioned in the same way as white children with similarly situated fathers 
5:131:9843:21:21:72:534:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:from    1880 to 1900, the median black worker in 1900 would have placed near the 30th percentile 
5:132:9940:21:21:72:525:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of the national income distribution.  This is comparable to the actual rank of the median black 
5:133:10036:21:20:72:525:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:male in 2000, a full 100 years later and more than 30 years after the Civil Rights Movement’s 
5:134:10130:20:21:72:496:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:major legislative accomplishments.  In this sense, paraphrasing Otis Duncan (1968), the 
5:135:10218:21:21:72:533:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:inheritance of race rather than the inheritance of poverty has been the first-order determinant of 
5:136:10317:21:20:72:258:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:racial disparities since emancipation.   
5:137:10358:20:21:108:502:502:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Our work builds on two closely related but distinct economics literatures.  First, a 
5:138:10443:21:21:72:510:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:burgeoning literature studies the transmission of labor market outcomes across generations 
5:139:10534:21:20:72:523:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(Becker and Tomes 1986, Solon 1992 and 1999, Mazumder 2005, Black and Devereux 2011, 
5:140:10619:20:21:72:538:440:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Long and Ferrie 2013, Chetty et al. 2014a,b).5  Within the intergenerational mobility literature, a 
5:141:10719:21:21:71:501:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:much smaller group of studies investigates racial differences in intergenerational income 
5:142:10809:21:21:72:499:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mobility in recent decades (Hertz 2005, Isaacs 2008, Bhattacharya and Mazumder 2011, 
5:143:10894:21:20:72:552:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Mazumder 2014).  Typically, the   studies find substantial racial differences in mobility out of the 
5:144:10995:20:21:71:517:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:lower end of the income distribution and in maintaining positions higher in the distribution.  
5:145:11090:21:21:71:535:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Second, a long-standing economics literature studies the evolution of black-white differences in 
5:146:11187:21:20:71:505:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:average income and human capital.  A number of important studies trace the convergence 
5:147:11274:20:21:71:538:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:process far back into history, encountering many of the same data limitations that we confront in 
5:148:11372:21:21:71:543:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:this paper (e.g.,    Higgs 1977, Smith 1984, Card and Krueger 1992, Sacerdote 2005, Margo 2016).  
5:149:11470:21:20:71:577:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Our   goal    is to   develop evidence that explicitly addresses questions about the interaction of race 
5:150:11575:20:21:71:516:233:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and intergenerational mobility over a long period of American history, covering a variety of 
5:151:11668:21:21:71:241:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:institutional and policy regimes.     
5:152:11706:21:21:107:485:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: The implications of finding large differences in economic mobility over many 
5:153:11783:21:20:71:549:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:generations are far reaching.  First, although being from a better off family was  advantageous for 
5:154:11883:20:21:71:535:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:both black and white children relative to others of the same race, it is notable that narrowing the 
5:155:11983:21:31:71:514:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:black -white gap in parental earnings in our samples would still leave large gaps in expected 
5:156:12077:31:8:72:219:98:133:g_d0_f3:133:g_d0_f3:                                                   
5:157:12128:8:16:72:530:90:48:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:5 There is also an important literature on intergenerational mobility in sociology, which we reference later in 
5:158:12240:16:0:71:119:74:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:the paper.  
6:159:12260:0:21:72:522:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:income for children.  Thus, one-off transfers of income, in and of themselves, might not have 
6:160:12354:21:21:72:535:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:made a large and lasting impression on the evolution of the black-white income gap because the 
6:161:12449:21:20:72:527:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:groups tended to revert to different means.6  From this perspective, deeper and more sustained 
6:162:12544:20:21:72:543:647:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:economic, political, and social reform would have been required for black Americans to close the 
6:163:12641:21:21:72:212:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:racial gap permanently.      
6:164:12670:21:21:107:525:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Second, the changes in institutions, policies, and racial animus that did take place over 
6:165:12760:21:20:72:535:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the last century have not led to great improvements in the adult outcomes of poor black children 
6:166:12857:20:21:72:490:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:relative to comparably poor white children.  One possible proximate explanation is the 
6:167:12944:21:21:72:525:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:persistence of gaps in human capital, which have endured despite educational reforms such as 
6:168:13037:21:20:72:538:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:school desegregation.  Although imperfect, there is suggestive evidence that racial differences in 
6:169:13136:20:21:72:529:502:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:test scores underpinned the racial mobility gap observed in 1930’s data, echoing findings from 
6:170:13231:21:21:72:510:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the NLSY79 cohort (Neal and Johnson 1996, Mazumder 2014).  Taken at face value, these 
6:171:13317:21:20:72:494:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:findings suggest that   sons from black and white families at   similar points in the income 
6:172:13410:20:21:72:531:440:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:distribution accumulated substantially different levels of human capital for several generations, 
6:173:13508:21:21:72:515:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:with significant and direct implications for racial disparities in labor market outcomes.  The 
6:174:13603:21:21:72:542:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:deeper explanations for these human capital gaps lie in the history of slavery, discrimination, and 
6:175:13703:21:20:72:174:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:racial segregation.

6:178:13800:21:20:72:180:315:144:Times:144:Times:A. Historical Context 
6:179:13821:20:21:108:510:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: In 1880, at the    start    of our period of study, the overwhelming majority of  African 
6:180:13911:21:21:72:519:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Americans were former slaves or directly descended from slaves, and 92 percent lived in the 
6:181:14003:21:20:72:507:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:South.7  Typically, they    were poor in terms of both physical and human capital.  With few 
6:182:14096:20:21:71:544:233:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:exceptions, there was no mass   redistribution of property or compensation paid to former slaves 
6:183:14193:21:21:71:536:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in the wake of the Civil War, despite calls for “40 acres and a mule” (Oubre 1978).  Thus, as we 
6:184:14290:21:20:71:537:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:show below, most black men in 1880 were either farm laborers or farmers who did not own land 
6:185:14383:20:9:72:219:171:133:g_d0_f3:133:g_d0_f3:                                                   
6:186:14434:9:16:72:533:162:48:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:6 It is conceivable that a mass redistribution of land to freedmen and a more sustained federal presence would 
6:187:14545:16:11:71:519:146:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:have led to a different political economy in the South, a counterfactual that is beyond this paper but that is 
6:188:14656:11:13:71:537:135:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:closer to the “deeper reform” we mention. See Miller (2016) for a study of land redistribution to former slaves 
6:189:14768:13:8:71:134:122:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:in Oklahoma.  
6:190:14781:8:16:72:532:114:48:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:7 In 1860, at the time of the last census before the Civil War, about 96 percent of blacks residing in the South 
6:191:14894:16:12:71:541:98:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:were slaves (Ransom 2006), including Kentucky but not Maryland, Delaware, or Missouri.  It is not possible to 
6:192:15004:12:12:71:538:86:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:ascertain from the from post-Civil War censuses whether someone had been a slave. We restrict our sample to 
6:193:15112:12:0:72:275:74:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:Southern blacks, as described later in the paper. 
7:194:15172:0:21:72:530:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(i.e., sharecroppers or tenant farmers).  Most of the rest were unskilled non-farm laborers.  The 
7:195:15270:21:21:72:519:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:illiteracy rate was high among former slaves because it was generally forbidden for slaves to 
7:196:15364:21:20:72:520:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:learn to read or write.  Public school systems were established throughout the South after the 
7:197:15459:20:21:72:536:647:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Civil War, but schools for black children were separate from those for whites, and racial gaps in 
7:198:15557:21:21:72:527:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:school quality widened between 1880 and 1910 (Margo 1990), a result of whites’ control over 
7:199:15649:21:21:72:522:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:both local and state-allocated funding.  By 1910, the political disenfranchisement of southern 
7:200:15744:21:20:72:531:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:blacks was nearly complete (Kousser 1974) and, therefore, redress through the political system 
7:201:15839:20:21:72:551:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:was    impossible.  Although African Americans did gain in literacy and property ownership over 
7:202:15935:21:21:72:534:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:time (Higgs 1982, Margo 1984, Margo 1990), they started from a low base, and the obstacles to 
7:203:16029:21:20:72:533:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:their economic advance were formidable (Myrdal 1944, Ransom and Sutch 1977, Wright 1986, 
7:204:16118:20:21:72:520:502:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Woodman 1995).  Geographic mobility was helpful in this context, but large-scale migration 
7:205:16209:21:21:72:515:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:from    the South to the North did not begin until World War I.  Migration declined during the 
7:206:16304:21:20:72:499:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Great Depression before rising again during World War II and continuing into the 1960s 
7:207:16391:20:21:72:443:440:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(Vickery 1977, Vigdor 2002, Collins and Wanamaker 2014, Boustan 2016).  
7:208:16463:21:21:108:560:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: World War II and the 1940s brought significant gains in income for black men    relative to 
7:209:16555:21:21:72:539:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:whites, in part due to the compression of income distribution (Maloney 1994, Margo 1995).  Yet 
7:210:16650:21:20:72:512:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:it is    the decade following the 1964 Civil Rights Act that stands out in retrospect.  The Civil 
7:211:16748:20:21:72:531:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Rights Movement revolutionized race relations in the South by dismantling de jure segregation 
7:212:16842:21:21:72:542:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and discouraging discrimination in labor markets, education, healthcare, voting rights, and public 
7:213:16941:21:20:72:514:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:accommodations (Wright 2013).  Space does not allow a full recounting here, but the black-
7:214:17031:20:21:72:528:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:white ratio in men’s average wages increased markedly in th  e 1965-75 timeframe (Freeman 
7:215:17121:21:21:72:542:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:1981, Donohue and Heckman 1991).  The momentum did not continue into the post-1980 period, 
7:216:17212:21:20:72:509:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:however, leading scholars to take up the question of “what went wrong?” (e.g., Bound and 
7:217:17301:20:21:72:542:233:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Freeman 1992).  Bayer and Charles (2016, Appendix Table 2) show that the median earnings gap 
7:218:17394:21:21:72:525:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:between black and white native-born men, including those out of the labor force, has widened 
7:219:17487:21:21:72:537:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:since 1980, and that the median rank gap    has narrowed since 1960, but only slightly. In sum, the 
7:220:17587:21:20:72:514:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pace of convergence has been slow and uneven, large gaps in men’s labor market outcomes 
7:221:17675:20:21:72:519:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:remain, and the gains of the Civil Rights era have not translated into a sustained path toward 
7:222:17770:21:21:72:175:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:economic equality.

8:226:17973:21:20:72:528:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:differences in intergenerational economic mobility.  Two that are close in spirit to our analysis 
8:227:18071:20:21:72:534:647:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:are Hertz (2005) and Mazumder (2014), which use modern longitudinal datasets to characterize 
8:228:18164:21:21:72:484:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:income mobility patterns in recent decades, from the late 1970s through 2005.8  They 
8:229:18249:21:21:72:525:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:consistently find that black men we re less likely than whites to move out of the bottom of the 
8:230:18345:21:20:72:521:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:income distribution, conditional on starting at the bottom as children.  Blacks were also more 
8:231:18440:20:21:72:503:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:likely than whites to fall out of the upper levels of the income distribution, conditional on 
8:232:18534:21:21:72:535:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:starting there.  Like    this paper, the se studies highlight the quantitative importance of differences 
8:233:18639:21:20:71:536:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in mobility, as opposed to differences in parental income per se, in transmitting racial disparities 
8:234:18740:20:21:71:535:502:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:over generations.  This paper’s main contribution relative to Hertz’s and Mazumder’s work is to 
8:235:18836:21:21:71:529:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:expand the scope of investigation, covering from the first post-   emancipation generations to the 
8:236:18935:21:20:72:543:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:end of the 20th century and developing consistent comparative analyses over eras with  different 
8:237:19032:20:21:72:277:440:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:institutional and economic environments.  
8:238:19074:21:21:108:540:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Margo (2016) also emphasizes the importance of studying intergenerational factors when 
8:239:19161:21:21:72:460:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:trying to understand long-run black-white differences in income.  He outlines an 
8:240:19242:21:20:72:522:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:intergenerational model that seeks to reconcile the slow pace of average income convergence 
8:241:19334:20:21:72:538:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:with results from the broader economics literature that focuses on the intergenerational elasticity 
8:242:19434:21:21:72:527:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of income.9  His model includes race directly in equations determining labor market outcomes 
8:243:19527:21:20:72:531:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and (separately) human capital accumulation.  In this framework, r acial differences in income 
8:244:19622:20:21:72:538:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:may   be large and persistent if race and human capital are strongly transmitted across generations 
8:245:19722:21:21:72:525:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:or if   race strongly affects human capital accumulation (e.g., through social capital channels or 
8:246:19821:21:20:72:513:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:discrimination in access to educational resources), all of which is consistent with American 
8:247:19914:20:21:72:111:233:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:history. 
8:248:19923:21:21:108:523:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:There is also a large sociology literature on intergenerational mobility, some of which 
8:249:20011:21:21:72:520:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:focuses on racial disparities    and uses data that we examine for the mid-20th century.  Duncan 
8:250:20108:21:23:72:537:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(1968) studies racial differences in the first wave of the OCG dataset for men observed in 1962.

8:252:20257:9:16:72:536:138:48:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:8 Hertz (2005) uses data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), which began in 1968.  Mazumder 
8:253:20361:16:12:72:527:122:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:(2014) uses data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) and several waves of the 
8:254:20464:12:12:72:513:110:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) matched to Social Security Administration earnings 
8:255:20565:12:8:72:108:98:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:records. 
8:256:20573:8:16:72:511:90:48:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:9 Stuhler (2014) and Solon (2015) also address this issue; Margo builds on their insights and situates the 
8:257:20680:16:0:71:206:74:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:discussion in historical context. 
9:258:20724:0:21:72:515:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A key conclusion is that “[a]lthough Negro social origins [occupations of fathers] are not as 
9:259:20818:21:21:72:514:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:favorable as those of whites, this is the lesser part of the explanation of racial differences in 
9:260:20916:21:20:72:526:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:occupation achievement.  The greater part of the explanation lies in the inequalities within the 
9:261:21013:20:21:72:526:647:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:process of mobility itself” (p. 11).  Featherman and Hauser (1976) and Hout (1984) also study 
9:262:21107:21:21:72:527:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:racial differences in the OCG data, including the  second wave of the survey taken   in 1973.  
9:263:21202:21:21:72:510:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Featherman and Hauser find substantial gains in average occupational status for black men 
9:264:21292:21:20:72:540:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:observed in 1973 relative to their fathers (measured by Duncan’s socioeconomic index), whereas 
9:265:21387:20:21:72:495:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the  cohort of black men observed in 1962 had only small intergenerational gains.  Their 
9:266:21476:21:21:72:538:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:interpretation emphasizes improvements in black men’s educational attainment and labor market 
9:267:21570:21:20:72:500:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:returns to education between the survey dates. Hout (1984) finds that the black men who 
9:268:21658:20:21:72:541:502:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:experienced occupational upgrades during the 1960s tended to come from better off backgrounds 
9:269:21752:21:21:72:527:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in terms of their fathers’ occupations.  Our methodology allows us to study these occupational 
9:270:21847:21:20:72:524:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mobility results for two mid-century cohorts in terms of relative income mobility and to place 
9:271:21942:20:21:71:215:440:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:them in long-run perspective.

9:275:22059:20:21:107:523:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: As mentioned in the introduction, we have built new datasets of linked census records 
9:276:22145:21:21:71:510:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:that cover one set of father-son pairs observed in 1880 (providing the father’s labor market 
9:277:22238:21:20:72:541:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:outcome) and 1900 (for the son’s outcome) and a second set of father-son pairs observed in 1910 
9:278:22334:20:21:72:519:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and   1930.  Since these datasets are new, we introduce them here at some length and describe 
9:279:22428:21:21:72:536:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:them  in more detail in the data appendix.  The modern datasets that we use to complete the long-
9:280:22525:21:20:71:536:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:run portrait of mobility, the OCG surveys for 1962 and 1973 (Blau et al. 1999) and the NLSY79 
9:281:22619:20:21:71:532:233:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:data, are more familiar to scholars.  We spend less space on their ba sic description here, but we 
9:282:22718:21:21:72:476:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:highlight some issues of comparability between the historical and modern samples.  
9:283:22801:21:21:108:539:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: To build the 1880 to 1900 linked dataset, we started with the 1-percent public use sample 
9:284:22891:21:20:71:540:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of the 1880 Census of Population (Ruggles et al. 2010).10  We limited the sample to black males, 
9:285:22988:20:27:72:531:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:aged 0 to 17, residing in one of thirteen southern states with their father or stepfather present in 
9:286:23089:27:9:72:219:123:133:g_d0_f3:133:g_d0_f3:                                                   
9:287:23140:9:16:72:525:114:48:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:10 Collins and Wanamaker (2014, 2015) use similar samples of southern men observed in 1910 and 1930 to 
9:288:23243:16:12:72:532:98:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:study gains from inter-regional migration and migration patterns.  However, prior work with black and white 
9:289:23351:12:12:72:525:86:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:linked census data has not studied differences in intergenerational mobility patterns, and the linked data for 
9:290:23462:12:0:72:478:74:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:1880 to 1900, including links to the 1880 Census of Agriculture, are entirely new to this paper.   
10:291:23571:0:21:72:481:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the household.11  We focus on families in the South in 1880 given the overwhelming 
10:292:23654:21:21:71:538:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:concentration of blacks in that region and the high cost of data construction.  Sons who leave the 
10:293:23753:21:20:71:518:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:South remain in the sample. The  1880 census provides information on county of residence, 
10:294:23843:20:21:71:522:647:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:whether the household lived on a farm or in an urban area, whether the child attended school, 
10:295:23937:21:21:71:536:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and literacy (for those age 10 or over), as well as information about the son’s father and mother, 
10:296:24036:21:21:71:562:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:such as their    age, occupation, and literacy.  We searched for the sons two decades later in the full 
10:297:24140:21:20:71:524:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:set of manuscripts from the 1900 Census of Population, based on state of birth, age, race, sex, 
10:298:24236:20:21:71:534:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and first and last name.12  Our analysis sample contains 2,314 black sons and 4,406 white sons.  
10:299:24333:21:21:72:515:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:From the hand-written census manuscripts in 1900, we transcribed information on the son’s 
10:300:24423:21:20:72:530:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:occupation, home ownership, and employment status.  The data appendix describes the linking 
10:301:24515:20:21:72:507:502:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:process in more detail and shows that the linked sample is fairly representative of the base 
10:302:24608:21:21:72:135:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:population.   
10:303:24622:21:20:108:530:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:One downside of the historical samples in comparison with true longitudinal data is the 
10:304:24710:20:21:72:496:440:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:possibility of mismatches in the link between fathers and sons across census years.  The 
10:305:24799:21:21:72:528:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:appendix contains both a sensitivity analysis based on the quality of the underlying intercensal 
10:306:24896:21:21:72:515:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:match and   simulations to quantify the bias under an assumed rate of mismatch (Bailey et al. 
10:307:24990:21:20:72:413:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:2016).  The paper’s conclusions are not sensitive to these adjustments. 
10:308:25062:20:21:108:521:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: Many of the fathers in the 1880-based dataset were farmers.  In the absence of further 
10:309:25149:21:21:72:533:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:information, they would occupy a single occupational category, leaving only race and region of 
10:310:25244:21:20:72:502:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:residence as income score differentiators.  To learn more about their economic status, we 
10:311:25334:20:21:72:513:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:conducted another linking exercise to locate them in the manuscripts of the 1880 Census of 
10:312:25425:21:21:72:490:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Agriculture, which were recorded and stored separately from the Census of Population 
10:313:25510:21:34:72:541:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:manuscripts.13  We then transcribed key information about their farms.  We focus on whether the 
10:314:25606:34:9:72:219:219:133:g_d0_f3:133:g_d0_f3:                                                   
10:315:25657:9:15:72:507:210:48:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:11 The dataset includes fathers and sons originating in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, 
10:316:25760:15:12:72:511:195:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia. 
10:317:25863:12:12:72:534:183:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:Maryland, Delaware, and Washington D.C., although in the “Census South,” are not included in our data.  11 
10:318:25970:12:12:72:535:171:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:percent of sons in the original sample are dropped because of missing fathers in 1880; 12 percent are dropped 
10:319:26080:12:9:72:219:159:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:for this reason in the 1910 dataset. 
10:320:26117:9:12:72:486:150:48:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:12 See the data appendix for details on the matching process. The final match rate was 26 percent,  
10:321:26216:12:16:72:503:138:48:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:13 Linking them often entailed searching “by hand” through microfilmed records that are organized by 
10:322:26317:16:12:72:503:122:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:location. We were able to use Ancestry.com database searches for Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, 
10:323:26416:12:12:72:527:110:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. Microfilm searches of the original Census of Agriculture manuscripts were 
10:324:26522:12:12:72:506:98:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:performed by hand for Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and West 
10:325:26622:12:12:72:529:86:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:Virginia residents. In the Census of Agriculture manuscripts, we located 82 percent of the white fathers who 
10:326:26731:12:0:72:480:74:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:reported their occupation as “farmer” in the population census and 76 percent of black farmers.   
11:327:26839:0:21:72:528:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:farmer owned his farm, as this was a major distinction in economic and legal status at the time 
11:328:26934:21:21:72:505:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and is a distinction we can also make in 1900, 1910, and 1930.  We assume that men who 
11:329:27021:21:20:72:518:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:reported themselves as a farmer in the population census but could not be linked to an actual 
11:330:27115:20:21:72:500:647:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:farm in the agricultural census did not, in fact, own the land underlying their agricultural 
11:331:27208:21:21:72:144:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:production.14   
11:332:27224:21:21:108:538:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: For the 1910 to 1930 period, we followed a similar process, beginning with the 1-percent 
11:333:27313:21:20:72:539:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:public use sample of the 1910 Census of Population (Ruggles et al. 2010) and linking forward to 
11:334:27409:20:21:72:517:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the full count of the 1930 Census to generate a sample of 10,645 white sons and 2,289 black 
11:335:27501:21:21:72:536:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:sons.15  Again, the 1910 public use sample provides a number of relevant background variables, 
11:336:27596:21:20:72:516:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and we transcribed information on the son’s outcomes from the 1930 manuscripts.  In 1910, 
11:337:27686:20:21:72:524:502:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:homeownership was recorded in the Census of Population, and we rely on that information to 
11:338:27777:21:21:72:534:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:distinguish farmers who were homeowners and, presumably, farm owners from those who were 
11:339:27866:21:20:72:483:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:not.16  It is fortunate that the population census included this information because the 
11:340:27955:20:21:72:526:440:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:manuscripts of the 1910 Census of Agriculture were destroyed by Congressional order.  Thus, 
11:341:28047:21:21:72:532:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:one cannot link farm households to farm manuscripts in 1910.  Again, the data appendix shows 
11:342:28140:21:21:72:419:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:that the linked sample is fairly representative of the larger base sample.  
11:343:28216:21:20:108:530:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: Linked census data cannot be constructed for men in the second half of the 20th century 
11:344:28304:20:21:72:531:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:due to confidentially restrictions on the use of census manuscripts.  Instead, we rely on modern 
11:345:28401:21:21:72:540:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:datasets that contain intergenerational information that  span  s the middle to late   20th century.  The 
11:346:28507:21:20:71:539:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:OCG datasets were originally compiled as supplements to the Current Population Surveys (CPS) 
11:347:28599:20:40:72:525:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in 1962 and 1973 (Blau et al. 1999).  The datasets provide information on men’s current labor 
11:348:28693:40:8:72:219:255:133:g_d0_f3:133:g_d0_f3:                                                   
11:349:28744:8:16:72:527:247:48:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:14 The census enumeration form sought the name of “the person who conducts this farm.”  It seems unlikely 
11:350:28850:16:12:72:521:231:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:that a farmer who owned and operated his farm would not be recorded as such, though mistakes cannot be 
11:351:28953:12:12:72:534:219:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:ruled out.  It seems more likely that those tenuously connected to farms through sharecropping arrangements, 
11:352:29062:12:12:72:539:207:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:those on sub-tenancies, or those co-operating with another farmer (e.g., a brother or relative) would be missing 
11:353:29175:12:12:72:523:195:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:from the rolls.  Only one name per farm is listed. In the appendix, we show that the unmatched farmers are 
11:354:29282:12:12:72:542:183:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:disadvantaged in a number of socioeconomic dimensions, including literacy, age, and eventual homeownership 
11:355:29389:12:12:72:530:171:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:status of their sons, confirming that they are unlikely to be land owners or missing at random from our data.  
11:356:29500:12:9:72:506:159:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:For analysis, we group all non-owners together; it is impossible to distinguish croppers from tenants.    
11:357:29606:9:12:72:276:150:48:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:15 The match rate was 27 percent in this sample. 
11:358:29654:12:16:72:520:138:48:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:16 Of course, some farmers did not own their home but did own the land they farmed, and vice versa. Still, 
11:359:29761:16:12:72:522:122:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:Goldenweiser and Truesdell (1924, p. 53) provide breakdowns of farm ownership and tenancy by race and 
11:360:29863:12:12:72:513:110:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:region for 1920 based on the Census of Agriculture.  Using the 1920 IPUMS sample from the Census of 
11:361:29963:12:12:72:539:98:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:Population, we find a close correspondence between rates of home ownership among southern farmers and the 
11:362:30069:12:12:72:521:86:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:rates of farm ownership reported by Goldenweiser and Truesdell (GT): 49.6 percent of farmers are tenants 
11:363:30174:12:0:72:359:74:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:(including croppers) in GT; 50.3 are “not home owners” in IPUMS. 
12:364:30249:0:21:72:529:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:market outcomes, as well as retrospective information about the father’s (or household head’s) 
12:365:30344:21:21:72:531:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:occupation when the respondent was 16 years old.  One major advantage of the OCG dataset is 
12:366:30436:21:20:72:521:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:its timing in 1962 and 1973, which provides a view of labor market outcomes just before and 
12:367:30528:20:21:72:371:647:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:several years after the landmark Civil Rights Act legislation.   
12:368:30593:21:21:108:530:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Next, we use the NLSY79, which began with over 12,000 males and females who were 
12:369:30674:21:21:72:531:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:age 14 to 22 in 1979.  Respondents were interviewed each year until 1994 and then every other 
12:370:30768:21:20:72:511:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:year.     The NLSY79 data are similar to the OCG data in that they report the father’s (or 
12:371:30859:20:21:72:522:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:household head’s) occupation when the respondent was 14 years old based on a retrospective 
12:372:30950:21:21:72:517:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:question posed at the start of the survey.  We focus on males for consistency with the earlier 
12:373:31045:21:20:72:518:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:datasets.  The data appendix provides additional details on the OCG and NLSY79 samples.   
12:374:31135:20:21:108:532:502:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: Differences in data structure pose a challenge when comparing the historical samples to 
12:375:31223:21:21:72:511:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the OCG or NLSY data.    Because most of our analyses compare black-white differences in 
12:376:31312:21:20:72:531:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mobility within samples, the incongruities across datasets   are not a  paramount concern, but we 
12:377:31410:20:21:72:534:440:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:want to highlight the issues here for clarity.17  First, in the historical datasets, we see the sons in 
12:378:31514:21:21:72:530:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the labor market exactly 20 years after we see the fathers.  But in the OCG and NLSY data, the 
12:379:31609:21:21:72:553:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:reference is to the father’s occupation when the son was 16 or 14 years old, whi   ch could be any 
12:380:31708:21:20:72:524:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:number of years prior to the survey (e.g., for a 30-year old respondent in the OCG survey, the 
12:381:31803:20:21:71:532:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:question pertains to 14 years prior).  There is no way to make the datasets perfectly comparable 
12:382:31900:21:21:71:518:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in this regard while retaining useful sample sizes, but we can see how sensitive results are to 
12:383:31996:21:20:72:520:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:changing age restrictions for sons in the modern samples. (See the appendix for details.)  For 
12:384:32091:20:21:72:534:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:instance, an age range of 20-37 in the OCG is most directly comparable to the ages at which we 
12:385:32186:21:21:71:535:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:see adult s ons in the historical samples, but the range 28-44 (centered on 36) gets closer to the 
12:386:32285:21:20:71:477:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:historical samples’ 20-year difference between the observation of father’s and son’s 
12:387:32370:20:21:72:145:233:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:occupation.18   
12:388:32386:21:21:107:494:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: A second incongruity between the historical and modern datasets pertains to the 
12:389:32466:21:21:71:519:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:geographic scope in the base year.  In the historical samples, we started with father-son pairs 
12:390:32562:21:20:72:533:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:who resided in the South, where more than 90 percent of black Americans resided.  By the time 
12:391:32656:20:39:72:535:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the OCG and NLSY surveys were carried out, however, blacks were much more geographically 
12:392:32745:39:9:72:219:111:133:g_d0_f3:133:g_d0_f3:                                                   
12:393:32796:9:16:72:527:102:48:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:17 Long and Ferrie (2013) compare a dataset of linked historical census records to the OCG data for 1973 in 
12:394:32904:16:8:72:313:86:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:their characterization of US intergenerational mobility.    
12:395:32963:8:0:72:499:78:48:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:18 We discuss a related concern about “life-cycle bias” below (Grawe 2006, Haider and Solon 2006).  
13:396:33073:0:21:72:536:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:dispersed as a result of the Great Migration.  In 1970, 50 percent of black men between the ages 
13:397:33170:21:21:72:502:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of  20 and 50 resided outside the South and 33 percent had been born outside the South.  
13:398:33259:21:20:72:518:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Therefore, it is appropriate to use the full scope of the OCG and NLSY data for the post-war 
13:399:33352:20:21:72:536:647:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:analyses.  It is straightforward to check the sensitivity of key results to restricting the samples to 
13:400:33455:21:21:72:464:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:men who were born in the South; we provide this information in the appendix.     
13:401:33536:21:21:108:533:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A third issue relates to the reference parent.  In the historical samples, approximately 90 
13:402:33628:21:20:72:539:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:percent of sons reside with fathers or stepfathers, and we base our analyses on this group.  Given 
13:403:33727:20:21:72:524:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:that   women’s labor force participation and occupations were recorded inconsistently and with 
13:404:33822:21:21:72:518:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:considerable error in these samples, it would be difficult to impute income to female-headed 
13:405:33915:21:20:71:556:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:households.  The OCG and NLSY79 surveys ask  ed respondents about the adults with who  m they 
13:406:34009:20:21:71:558:502:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:resided at age 16 or 14, respectively, and about the adults’ occupations at   that  juncture.  We use 
13:407:34111:21:21:71:535:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:these responses to assign household income scores based on the father’s occupation if the father 
13:408:34208:21:20:71:515:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:was present and on the mother’s occupation if the father was not present.  Alternatively, the 
13:409:34302:20:21:71:538:440:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:appendix includes a sensitivity check that uses an “other male head”-based score for those living 
13:410:34400:21:21:71:509:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:with their mother and another adult male.  It makes little difference to our results.  A small 
13:411:34495:21:21:71:506:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:number of individuals  who resided with neither their mother nor father at age 16 or 14 are 
13:412:34587:21:20:71:528:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:dropped from the analysis.19 For brevity, when we refer to “fathers” throughout the rest of this 
13:413:34684:20:21:72:539:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:paper   , readers should recognize that in the historical samples we mean fathers or stepfathers, and 
13:414:34786:21:21:72:404:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in the modern samples we mean fathers or household-head mothers.

13:416:34852:21:20:72:270:294:144:Times:144:Times:B. Assigning Income Scores and Ranks 
13:417:34889:20:21:108:540:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: In all the intergenerational samples we examine across a 120-year period, we can observe 
13:418:34978:21:20:71:515:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:an individual’s occupation, race, region of residence, and gender.  We assign income scores 
13:419:35070:20:21:71:528:233:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:based on the average earnings of individuals in the same occupation, race, region of residence, 
13:420:35166:21:21:71:530:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and gender cell  , drawn from the decennial census that is closest in timing and that has earnings 
13:421:35265:21:21:71:533:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:information.  This approach is similar in spirit to the often-used occscore variable from IPUMS 
13:422:35361:21:20:71:528:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(Ruggles et al. 2015), which is based on occupation-specific earnings in 1950.  But the scoring 
13:423:35457:20:21:71:536:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:used here has much more flexibility.  Income assignments that would be based on fewer than 50 
13:424:35550:21:29:71:513:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:underlying census observations are supplanted with scores based on a race- and occupation-
13:425:35640:29:9:72:219:100:133:g_d0_f3:133:g_d0_f3:                                                   
13:426:35691:9:17:72:531:91:65:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:19 This represents 3 percent of the sample in the 1962 OCG, 5 percent of the sample in the 1973 OCG, and 4 
13:427:35796:17:0:71:208:74:112:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:percent of the NLSY79 sample. 
14:428:35835:0:21:72:556:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:specific national average (not region-specific) or, if necessary, based on a race-specific one-   digit 
14:429:35939:21:21:72:286:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:occupation (rather than the 3-digit code).20   
14:430:35986:21:20:107:544:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: For   fathers observed in 1880 and 1910 and for sons observed in 1900 and 1930, income 
14:431:36073:20:21:71:520:647:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:score assignments are based on wage data from the full count 1940 census. (Inferences using 
14:432:36165:21:21:71:528:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:1960-based scores are similar, as shown in the appendix.)  In these samples, income scores for 
14:433:36260:21:21:71:563:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:self  -reported farmers vary by ownership status, and we account for non-wage farm    income in the 
14:434:36360:21:20:71:526:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:form of perquisites for all agriculture workers.21  For the OCG cohorts, sons observed in 1962 
14:435:36455:20:21:72:533:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:are assigned income scores based on the 1960 census.  Their fathers are assigned the average of 
14:436:36551:21:21:72:518:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:1940- and 1960-based income scores since the retrospective information on their occupation 
14:437:36642:21:20:71:530:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pertains to this period.22  Sons observed in the 1973 OCG data are assigned 1970-based scores, 
14:438:36737:20:21:71:538:502:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:whereas their fathers are  assigned 1960-based scores, again reflecting the retrospective nature of 
14:439:36837:21:21:72:534:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the information on fathers’ occupation.  For the NLSY79 cohort, the information on fathers’ (or 
14:440:36933:21:20:72:508:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:heads’) occupations pertains to the 1970s, and so their income scores are 1970-based.  We 
14:441:37023:20:21:72:528:440:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:observe the sons’ labor market outcomes in 1990 and 2000 and assign income scores based on 
14:442:37114:21:21:72:260:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:census data from those y   ears.     
14:443:37151:21:21:108:539:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:One   limitation of this approach is that it cannot capture between-cell changes in the wage 
14:444:37244:21:20:71:530:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:structure over time in the historical samples (observations between 1880 and 1930).  Not much 
14:445:37338:20:21:71:533:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:improvement can be made given the fragmentary and non-representative nature of race-specific 
14:446:37431:21:21:72:505:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:wage information prior to 1940.  Note that because the analyses focus on ranks within the 
14:447:37521:21:20:72:524:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:distribution of scores (as discussed in the next section), between-cell changes in wages matter 
14:448:37616:20:36:72:535:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:only to the extent that the cells change rank.23  A second limitation is that there is no within-cell 
14:449:37718:36:9:72:219:259:133:g_d0_f3:133:g_d0_f3:                                                   
14:450:37769:9:16:72:547:250:48:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:20 Björklund and   Jäntti (2000) provide an insightful discussion of how the economics and sociology literatures 
14:451:37882:16:12:72:532:234:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:on mobility have evolved in parallel.  Mazumder and Acosta (2015) provide a comparison of occupation and 
14:452:37987:12:12:72:533:222:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:income-based results with modern data, with particular attention to issues of life-cycle bias and measurement 
14:453:38097:12:12:71:537:210:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:error.  An alternative approach, which we do not pursue here, is to quantify occupational mobility per se using 
14:454:38209:12:9:71:506:198:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:broad, unordered occupation categories and Altham statistics, as described in Long and Ferrie (2013).   
14:455:38313:9:17:72:530:189:65:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:21 We use perquisite rates inferred from U.S. Department of Agriculture (1957) measures of cash wages and 
14:456:38418:17:8:71:405:172:112:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:non-cash compensation. See the data appendix for a more detailed description. 
14:457:38495:8:18:72:541:164:65:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:22 The 1950 decennial census asks income only of “sample line” individuals, and we quickly encounter sample 
14:458:38602:18:8:71:433:146:112:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:size problems in the income assignment methodology described in the data appendix. 
14:459:38684:8:16:72:536:138:48:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:23 The income scoring based on 1940’s income distribution versus 1960’s is highly correlated even though the 
14:460:38793:16:12:72:524:122:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:“Great Compression” occurred between these dates (Goldin and Margo 1992).  For the sons in the 1910-30 
14:461:38896:12:12:72:534:110:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:sample, the correlation coefficient is 0.93. A regression of sons’ ranks with an alternative 1960-based scoring 
14:462:39008:12:12:72:539:98:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:on sons’ ranks with 1940-based scoring has a slope of 0.94 (s.e.=0.003) and R-squared of 0.88.  Because some 
14:463:39117:12:12:72:526:86:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:information from 1960’s income distribution is carried over into the 1940 income assignments (see the data 
14:464:39224:12:0:72:342:74:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:appendix), the scores are not completely independent, however. 
15:465:39296:0:21:72:552:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:variation in score assignments, whereas there is, of course, within-cell    variation in true income.  
15:466:39399:21:21:72:515:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:For this reason, distributions of scores do not mimic micro-level distributions of earnings.    
15:467:39495:21:20:108:529:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: We convert assigned income scores into rankings in the national income distribution in 
15:468:39582:20:21:72:542:647:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:each year.  Using the national distribution as a reference point is useful for several reasons.  First, 
15:469:39686:21:21:72:537:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:we are primarily interested in documenting economic status relative to the entire population, not 
15:470:39784:21:21:72:521:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mobility within subgroups defined by race or region.24  For this purpose, a common, national 
15:471:39877:21:20:72:523:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:basis for comparison is most useful.  Second, measuring blacks’ status relative to the national 
15:472:39973:20:21:72:494:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:distribution anchors the discussion in an important historical fact: southern blacks were 
15:473:40063:21:21:72:524:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:remarkably crowded into the lowest deciles of the national income distribution in the late 19th 
15:474:40158:21:20:72:527:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and early 20th centuries.  Thus, studying the frequency and correlates of upward mobility from 
15:475:40253:20:21:72:542:502:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the bottom is critical to understanding the course of black economic progress.  Third, by focusing 
15:476:40352:21:21:72:528:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:on position in the distribution, we would characterize a father-son pair that maintains the same 
15:477:40449:21:20:72:538:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:rank as neither up- nor downwardly mobile.  We find this property appropriate given the paper’s 
15:478:40545:20:21:72:542:440:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:motivation, which is grounded in the relative status of blacks rather than, say, their absolute level 
15:479:40647:21:21:72:184:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of income per capita.    
15:480:40671:21:21:108:542:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:To rank sons and fathers for the historical samples, we   first    apply the income score 
15:481:40761:21:20:72:519:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:assignment methods described above to nationally representative cross-sectional samples for 
15:482:40853:20:21:72:535:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:1880, 1900, 1910, and 1930 from IPUMS.25  Then, we see where men in the linked samples fall 
15:483:40945:21:21:72:519:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:relative to the appropriate national distribution in each year.  To be clear, even if the son and 
15:484:41043:21:20:72:524:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:father pursue the same line of work in the same place (thus receiving the same income score), 
15:485:41137:20:21:72:538:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:there could be a change in rank due to the change in the composition of the national labor force.  
15:486:41236:21:21:72:531:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:For instance, southern fathers who are tenant farmers in 1910 might have a higher rank relative 
15:487:41332:21:20:72:532:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:to their peers than sons who are tenant farmers in 1930 because the composition of the national 
15:488:41428:20:21:72:528:233:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:labor force shifted toward more highly paid occupations in the sons’ generation.  For the OCG 
15:489:41522:21:21:72:529:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and NLSY79 datasets, the original samples are national in scope, and we rank fathers and sons 
15:490:41616:21:20:72:252:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:relative to peers within each dataset.  
15:491:41656:20:9:72:219:171:133:g_d0_f3:133:g_d0_f3:                                                   
15:492:41707:9:16:72:541:162:48:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:24 Hertz (2005) and Mazumder (2014) point out that a regression of son’s income on father’s income for whites 
15:493:41817:16:11:72:514:146:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:or blacks separately provides a measure of mobility within the group but conveys nothing about whether 
15:494:41920:11:9:72:176:135:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:groups are converging.   
15:495:41945:9:16:72:532:126:48:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:25 The IPUMS national sample includes all fathers of sons aged 0 to 17 in the beginning year (1880 or 1910). 
15:496:42054:16:12:72:525:110:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:We rank all sons against males aged 20 to 38 in the ending year (1900 or 1930). We include only black and 
15:497:42160:12:12:72:526:98:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:white males in these national samples as our race-specific inference methods run into sample size issues for 
15:498:42269:12:12:72:539:86:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:other races. Practically, this involves eliminating 0.58% of the national sample in 1880, 0.21% in 1900, 0.63% 
15:499:42380:12:0:72:191:74:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:in 1910 and 0.74% in 1930.

16:502:42459:21:20:108:557:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Figures 1A-  1E  contain kernel density plots of the distributions of fathers and sons across 
16:503:42553:20:21:71:526:647:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:national income rankings, separately for whites and blacks in each cohort.  The plots highlight 
16:504:42649:21:21:71:535:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the strong concentration of black men at the lower end of the relative income distribution across 
16:505:42747:21:21:71:511:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the full time period, but with diminishing concentrations in the lower tail over time.  White 
16:506:42841:21:20:71:521:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:fathers and sons are found much less commonly than blacks at the bottom of the distribution, 
16:507:42934:20:21:71:525:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:though the early white cohorts are concentrated in the lower half of the distribution, reflecting 
16:508:43032:21:21:71:519:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the historical samples’ restriction to southern families in 1880 and 1910.  By 1930, however, 
16:509:43126:21:20:71:504:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:white sons are approaching a more uniform distribution across income percentiles.  In the 
16:510:43216:20:21:71:531:502:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:modern datasets, which are national in scope, white fathers and sons are evenly spread over the 
16:511:43312:21:21:71:522:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:distribution, except at the very bottom, as would be expected from a nationally representative 
16:512:43407:21:20:71:226:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:sample of the white population. 
16:513:43439:20:21:108:488:440:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: Underpinning these cross-sectional distributions are occupation- based income 
16:514:43517:21:21:72:536:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:assignments, and    we can see how groups line up based on broad occupational categories and 
16:515:43610:21:21:72:528:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:race.  This provides a check on whether the income assignments result in sensible rankings.  It 
16:516:43706:21:20:72:538:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:also    shows how the prevalence of occupational groups varied over time and across races, though 
16:517:43804:20:21:71:500:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:we emphasize that the micro-level income assignments are based on detailed (not broad) 
16:518:43891:21:21:71:537:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:occupational categories.  Table 1, Panel A reports income ranks for southern fathers in 1880 and 
16:519:43988:21:20:71:542:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in 1910 and for all fathers in the OCG and NLSY79 samples.  We focus on fathers in these tables 
16:520:44084:20:21:71:521:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:for ease of exposition.  Because farming occupations (“Farmer, owns” and “Farmer, does not 
16:521:44175:21:21:71:540:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:own”) and white-collar occupations (“White collar, professionals” and “White collar, managerial 
16:522:44271:21:20:71:537:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and clerical”) become relatively less and more prevalent over time, respectively, we collapse the 
16:523:44369:20:21:71:523:233:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:former into “All Farmers” in the modern samples and the latter into “All White Collar” in the 
16:524:44463:21:21:71:164:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:historical samples. 
16:525:44482:21:21:107:528:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: First,    we note that the relative rank of the broad categories matches our priors.  White -
16:526:44575:21:20:71:530:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:collar and skilled blue-collar workers are relatively highly ranked within race; the “agricultural 
16:527:44674:20:21:71:500:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ladder” appears monotonic in income from farm laborers to non-owner farmers to owner 
16:528:44759:21:21:71:527:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:operators; blacks earn less than whites within the occupational categories; and the black-white 
16:529:44855:21:20:71:537:108:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:differences in rank are larger at higher levels of skill.  Second, the average rank for black fathers 
16:530:44957:20:0:71:541:88:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in the historical datasets is below the 10th percentile of the national distribution, and black fathers 
17:531:45071:0:21:72:536:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in the South appear to have made no progress in terms of average rank between 1880 and 1910.  
17:532:45165:21:21:72:543:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Other studies have found growth in the black-white ratio of mean income in the pre-1900 period.  
17:533:45262:21:20:72:535:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Margo (2016), for example, estimates a rise in the ratio from 0.28 to 0.32 from 1870 to 1900.  It 
17:534:45360:20:21:72:536:647:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:is possible for the ratio of mean income to rise without a substantial change in the average black 
17:535:45459:21:21:72:558:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:rank, but it is also possible that such growth came from    blacks’ relative gains within or between 
17:536:45560:21:21:72:505:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:occupation-region cells, which are not captured in the historical scoring described above.  
17:537:45652:21:20:108:539:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:For the latter part of the 20th century, when the data are no longer constrained to southern 
17:538:45745:20:21:72:540:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:fathers, the average rank of black fathers (observed circa 1950) is substantially higher than in the 
17:539:45846:21:21:72:533:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:earlier cohorts, though just barely above the 10th percentile in the 1962 OCG.  In large part, this 
17:540:45946:21:20:72:527:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:is due to the smaller share of black men in low-paying agricultural occupations, an outcome at 
17:541:46041:20:21:72:541:502:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:least partially attributable to inter-regional migration.  In the 1973 OCG sample, the average rank 
17:542:46141:21:21:72:505:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:for black fathers increases to the 16th percentile, as even fewer were reported to have held 
17:543:46234:21:20:72:495:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:agricultural occupations and as average ranks for black men within non-farm categories 
17:544:46321:20:21:72:537:440:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:increased relative to the previous cohort.  Finally, the NLSY79 sample, which measures fathers’ 
17:545:46417:21:21:72:493:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:or mothers’ status in the early 1970s, shows strong evidence of black fathers increasing 
17:546:46506:21:21:72:542:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:employment in white collar and higher-skilled blue collar occupations, but also a sizable increase 
17:547:46605:21:20:72:526:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in white fathers’ employment in professional and managerial positions.  The overall result is a 
17:548:46701:20:21:72:463:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:rise in the average of black fathers’ ranking to approximately the 18th percentile.

17:551:46862:20:21:107:529:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:In the analysis that follows, we document intergenerational economic mobility for each 
17:552:46949:21:21:71:521:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:cohort of sons in our sample.  By “mobility,” we mean the movement of sons up or down the 
17:553:47039:21:20:71:539:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:percentiles of the national income distribution of similarly aged men relative to the position their 
17:554:47140:20:21:71:515:233:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:fathers held in the distribution of all fathers decades earlier.  As mentioned earlier, this rank-
17:555:47238:21:21:71:505:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:based approach is similar in spirit to recent work by Dahl and DeLeire (2008), Mazumder 
17:556:47326:21:21:71:514:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(2014), and Chetty et al. (2014a,b), and it reflects whether men “get ahead” or “fall behind” 
17:557:47420:21:35:71:342:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:relative to their peers from one generation to the next.26

17:559:47529:9:16:72:538:126:48:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:26 Readers might also be interested in the distribution of absolute real income or wealth, which is related to but 
17:560:47644:16:12:72:522:110:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:distinct from the study of intergenerational mobility emphasized here.  For efforts to measure race-specific 
17:561:47753:12:12:71:513:98:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:levels of income or wealth prior to 1940, we refer readers to Ransom and Sutch (1977), Higgs (1977 and 
17:562:47856:12:12:71:541:86:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:1982), and Margo (1984). Alternatively, the historical and sociological literatures on intergenerational mobility 
17:563:47970:12:0:71:509:74:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:often focus on father-son transitions between broad occupational categories.  In the appendix, we report 
18:564:48085:0:21:108:525:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:First   , we show the share of black and white sons who rose in the ranks relative to their 
18:565:48177:21:21:72:519:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:father’s position—this is “upward rank mobility,” as termed by Bhattacharya and Mazumder 
18:566:48266:21:20:72:518:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(2011).  When arranged by father’s decile, this provides a simple comparison of upward and 
18:567:48357:20:21:72:537:647:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:downward mobility rates for similarly situated children, but it does not capture the magnitude of 
18:568:48455:21:21:72:534:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the differences in the sons’ adult outcomes.  We next use descriptive regressions to characterize 
18:569:48553:21:21:72:545:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the expected rank of sons as a function of fathers’ rank   and race.  The racial gap is large, and it 
18:570:48655:21:20:72:518:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:remains so even when a large number of additional background variables are included in the 
18:571:48746:20:21:72:536:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:regressions.  Finally, to illustrate the consequences of racial differences in mobility, we estimate 
18:572:48847:21:21:72:533:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:counterfactual distributions of black sons’ income score ranks, in which they experience the net

18:578:49263:21:21:72:527:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of  fathers and sons, they are unwieldy for presentation here.27  Moreover, as Bhattacharya and 
18:579:49359:21:21:71:527:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Mazumder (2011) and Mazumder (2014) point out, since black fathers tend to rank lower than 
18:580:49450:21:20:71:541:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:whites within income deciles, black sons would have to advance further up the ranks to transition 
18:581:49548:20:21:71:488:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:over any given decile threshold.  Instead, to provide a simple visual summary of racial 
18:582:49636:21:21:71:536:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:differences in mobility, we start by illustrating the rate of upward rank mobility (URM), defined 
18:583:49734:21:20:71:527:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:as the share of sons whose rank exceeds their father’s rank in the national income distribution, 
18:584:49831:20:21:71:535:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:conditional on the father’s rank being within a certain interval.28  Note that a son can exceed his 
18:585:49931:21:21:72:524:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:father’s rank without transitioning over the decile threshold.  URM rates can be calculated for 
18:586:50027:21:21:72:553:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:varying degrees of upward mobility, measuring the share of sons who exceed their father’s rank    
18:587:50125:21:21:71:259:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:by a certain number of percentiles (휏휏).

19:597:51023:21:21:71:525:687:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f3:10.  The immediate impression from Figures 2A-   E is that conditional on father’s decile, there 
19:598:51120:21:20:72:526:666:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:were stark racial differences in upward rank mobility in every cohort we can observe from the 
19:599:51214:20:21:72:519:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:late 19th century through the end of the 20th century.30  White children had far higher rates of 
19:600:51311:21:21:72:526:625:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:upward mobility, implying lower rates of downward mobility because few maintained exactly 
19:601:51401:21:20:72:215:604:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the same rank as their parent. 
19:602:51431:20:21:108:518:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:In the historical samples, the plots for African Americans cover only a short range of 
19:603:51518:21:21:72:531:563:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:fathers’ potential income deciles, reflecting the overwhelming concentration of black fathers at 
19:604:51615:21:20:72:540:542:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the bottom of the national income distribution.  (We do not plot results for cells containing fewer 
19:605:51715:20:21:72:539:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:than 50 observations.)  For those with the lowest earning fathers (1st decile), between 72 percent 
19:606:51814:21:21:72:524:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(1880-1900) and 90 (1910-1930) percent of whites exceeded their father’s status compared to 
19:607:51906:21:21:72:536:480:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:only 51 percent (1880-1900) or 68 percent (1910-1930) of blacks.  The differences at the lowest 
19:608:52002:21:20:72:517:459:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:deciles in the early samples are statistically significant, and they are economically important 
19:609:52098:20:21:72:483:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:because a large share of black sons originated from families in those lowest deciles.   
19:610:52186:21:21:108:512:418:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: The basic pattern is similar for cohorts of men observed in the 1962 and 1973 OCG 
19:611:52268:21:20:72:537:397:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:surveys.  White sons exceeded black sons in upward rank mobility by about 20 to 30 percentage 
19:612:52362:20:21:72:518:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:points at the bottom of the fathers’ rank distribution.  From this perspective, there is no clear 
19:613:52460:21:21:72:505:356:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:evidence that the first cohort of post-Civil Rights era black sons (measured in 1973) fared 
19:614:52552:21:20:72:498:335:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:substantially better in terms of intergenerational mobility than those that preceded them. 
19:615:52643:20:21:108:489:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: In 1990 (NLSY79 data), racial differences in upward rank mobility  appear less 
19:616:52722:21:21:72:533:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pronounced than in the earlier samples, particularly at higher deciles of fathers’ income scores.  
19:617:52821:21:21:71:525:273:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:But the differences are still quite large, and they appear to widen with age.  That is, results for 
19:618:52921:21:20:71:535:252:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the NLSY79 sons observed in 2000, rather than 1990, show larger racial differences conditional 
19:619:53016:20:21:71:496:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:on fathers’ income scores. (See Appendix III.)     Mazumder (2014) also finds large racial 
19:620:53107:21:21:71:525:211:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:differences in URM in the NLSY79 data using observed income rather than occupation-based 
19:621:53196:21:20:71:113:190:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:scores.   
19:622:53205:20:34:107:521:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Consistent with these results, Table 2 indicates sizable white advantages within every

19:625:53453:17:8:71:291:110:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:income score rank with more than 50 observations.  
19:626:53504:8:16:72:511:102:48:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:30 The unconditional rates of upward rank mobility for blacks were comparable to those of whites, if not 
19:627:53609:16:12:72:533:86:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:higher.  But this simply reflects that black fathers were concentrated at the bottom of the distribution and that 
19:628:53723:12:0:72:544:74:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:upward mobility rates naturally decline as the father’s rank rises, hence the downward slopes in Figures 2a-e.

20:630:53947:21:20:72:539:687:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:children have had a far better chance than comparably situated black children of improving upon 
20:631:54043:20:21:72:538:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:their father’s status throughout U.S. history.  The results are not entirely surprising given what is 
20:632:54145:21:21:72:533:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:already known about the slow pace of black economic advance and the circumscribed nature of 
20:633:54237:21:20:72:535:625:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:blacks’ economic opportunities  throughout much of the 20th century.  And yet the disjuncture in 
20:634:54334:20:21:72:527:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:outcomes for white and black sons from low-status families is striking because it suggests that 
20:635:54430:21:21:72:538:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:that the slow pace of blacks’ relative advance was not only, or even primarily, a function of their 
20:636:54530:21:20:72:522:563:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pre -existing level of poverty.  It was also a function of much different likelihoods of getting 
20:637:54627:20:21:72:259:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ahead conditional on starting position.

20:639:54667:21:21:72:342:501:144:Times:144:Times:B. Expected Outcomes Conditional on Father’s Status 
20:640:54719:21:20:108:518:480:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: In this section, we use simple descriptive regressions to characterize the racial gap in 
20:641:54807:20:21:72:530:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:sons’ outcomes conditional on father  s’ ranks.  Then, we explore whether additional observable 
20:642:54903:21:21:72:536:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:characteristics of fathers, sons, and households can account for the racial gap.31 The   baseline 
20:643:55001:21:20:72:523:418:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:“full sample” regressions include men observed in their 20s and 30s; we also report estimates 
20:644:55095:20:21:72:538:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:that restrict the sample to sons observed at age 30 or higher, allowing more time for their careers 
20:645:55195:21:21:71:308:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:to unfold (Grawe 2006, Haider and Solon 2006). 
20:646:55242:21:20:107:527:356:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Panel A of Table 3 presents coefficients on an indicator variable for black sons in each 
20:647:55331:20:21:72:512:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:cohort, conditioning only on the fathers’ rank.  For   sons observed in 1900 and 1930, blacks 
20:648:55425:21:21:72:519:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ranked between 20 and 23 percentiles lower than whites in the “full sample” regressions; the 
20:649:55518:21:21:72:508:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:gaps are even larger in the “30+ year old” sample.   In the later cohorts (in samples that are 
20:650:55613:21:20:72:530:273:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:national in scope), the black-white rank  gaps    conditional on fathers’ status were 27, 25, and 19 
20:651:55714:20:21:72:531:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:percentiles, respectively.  The    NLSY cohort of sons can be re-examined in 2000, and the racial 
20:652:55812:21:21:71:482:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:gap   is  approximately one percentile larger (not shown in Table 3; see Appendix III).  
20:653:55901:21:20:107:540:211:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:In Panel B of Table 3, we add controls for fathers’ human capital and for other conditions 
20:654:55992:20:21:71:529:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in the home when the son was young.  In the historical samples, we observe the literacy rate of 
20:655:56088:21:21:71:529:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:fathers when sons were observed in their households (1880 and 1910).  In the OCG and NLSY 
20:656:56178:21:37:71:490:149:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:samples, we add fixed effects for fathers’ educational attainment, measured in years of 
20:657:56266:37:9:72:219:112:133:g_d0_f3:133:g_d0_f3:                                                   
20:658:56317:9:17:72:502:103:65:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:31 Conditional measures of upward rank mobility are an alternative way to measure the importance of 
20:659:56416:17:12:72:528:86:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:additional observable characteristics, but the main conclusions are more easily interpreted using conditional 
20:660:56526:12:0:72:181:74:112:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:regression specifications. 
21:661:56562:0:21:72:525:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:completed schooling.  We also control for whether the family’s home was an urban, rural non-
21:662:56654:21:21:72:534:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:farm, or farm residence when the son was co-resident with his parents.  Including the combined 
21:663:56749:21:20:71:538:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:set of additional characteristics reduces the   magnitude of the coefficient on race by no more than 
21:664:56850:20:21:71:536:647:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:1 point (1900 cohort), and sometimes widens differences compared to Panel A (1962, 1973, and 
21:665:56943:21:21:71:477:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:1990 cohorts).  Similar results obtain for the subsample of older sons (aged 30-37).  
21:666:57029:21:21:107:542:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:In Panel C, we add controls for the age of sons at the time their occupation is observed, as 
21:667:57122:21:20:71:528:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:well as fixed effects for state or region of residence in childhood, retaining the covariates from 
21:668:57221:20:21:71:523:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Panel B as well.  In the historical samples, the childhood location fixed effects are at the state 
21:669:57320:21:21:71:540:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:level, whereas for 1962 and 1973 cohorts they are at the region level   , and for the 1990 cohort 
21:670:57418:21:20:72:512:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:they are at the South/non-South level, reflecting constraints inherent to the datasets.32  This 
21:671:57514:20:21:71:535:502:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:specification controls for any racial differences in the age structure of the underlying samples as 
21:672:57614:21:21:71:518:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:well as differences in place of origin that may affect labor market outcomes.  The results are 
21:673:57709:21:20:71:295:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:quite similar to those in the preceding panels.  
21:674:57758:20:21:107:541:440:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Specifications in Panel D also   include controls for sons’ schooling and the presence of 
21:675:57848:21:21:71:533:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:both parents in the childhood household.  In the historical samples, school attendance (for those 
21:676:57946:21:21:71:536:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:over age 5) and childhood literacy (for those over age 10 in the base year) are the only measures 
21:677:58044:21:20:71:521:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of education, and using them reduces the sample size relative to previous panels.  From 1962 
21:678:58137:20:21:71:521:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:forward, we see completed grades for all sons.  For all the samples, we observe whether their 
21:679:58231:21:21:71:536:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mother and father were present in the childhood household.  Again, adding the controls has only 
21:680:58327:21:20:71:537:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:a small effect on the size of the racial gap in income rank relative to the parsimonious regression 
21:681:58427:20:21:71:540:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in Panel A, despite a growing racial difference in the number of single parent households and the 
21:682:58525:21:21:71:530:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:rising level of blacks’ educational attainment.  In unreported results, we replace the continuous 
21:683:58623:21:20:71:500:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:measure of fathers’ income rank with fixed effects for income rank deciles to allow for a 
21:684:58713:20:21:71:415:233:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:nonlinear relationship.  This change matters little for Table 3’s results.  
21:685:58789:21:21:107:535:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:In addition to the stark racial differences in expected outcomes, Table 3 also highlights a 
21:686:58881:21:21:71:519:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:consistently positive and statistically significant relationship between father’s rank and son’s 
21:687:58978:21:20:71:525:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:rank.  Most of the slope coefficients in Table 3 range between 0.12 and 0.32, and in Panel A’s 
21:688:59073:20:21:71:492:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:parsimonious regressions for men in their 30s, they range from 0.26 to 0.34.  Given the 
21:689:59161:21:21:71:488:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:somewhat rough nature of income assignments here, these coefficients are not directly 
21:690:59247:21:20:71:504:108:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:comparable to the intergenerational income elasticities commonly reported in the modern 
21:691:59335:20:9:72:219:88:133:g_d0_f3:133:g_d0_f3:                                                   
21:692:59386:9:0:72:539:79:65:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:32 Moving to county over state fixed effects for the earliest cohorts makes for slightly larger racial differences. 
22:693:59510:0:21:72:538:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:literature, nor are they suitable for strong inferences based on comparisons of coefficients across 
22:694:59610:21:21:71:511:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:different types of datasets.  It is , nonetheless, notable that the positive relationship between 
22:695:59708:21:20:72:537:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:father’s and son’s rank is apparent in both the white and black populations at all points in time—
22:696:59806:20:21:72:535:647:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:it was helpful to be born to a better off black family in 1910 rather than to an impoverished one, 
22:697:59905:21:21:72:517:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:despite the many barriers to advancement.  But the intercept differences between whites and 
22:698:59997:21:21:71:524:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:blacks were large and persistent, as reflected in the BLACK coefficients.  In other words, both 
22:699:60093:21:20:71:533:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:populations show evidence of mean reversion, but toward much different means throughout US 
22:700:60184:20:21:71:116:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:history.   
22:701:60195:21:21:107:541:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:For   additional perspective, Figure 3 illustrates these differences with the raw data, binned 
22:702:60290:21:20:71:498:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:by fathers’ income percentile and averaged, for easier viewing.  Here, we allow both the 
22:703:60379:20:21:71:495:502:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:intercept and slope to vary by race and by son’s cohort.  Recalling that black fathers are 
22:704:60470:21:21:71:497:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:concentrated below the 30th percentile in every dataset, the economic significance of the 
22:705:60560:21:20:71:535:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:intercept difference is immediately clear.  We  include the NLSY79 cohort of sons observed in 
22:706:60654:20:21:71:517:440:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:both 1990 and 2000 to show that the relatively large slope depicted for black men in 1990 is 
22:707:60746:21:21:72:536:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:somewhat sensitive to the   age at observation; by 2000, the slope for black sons had fallen and 
22:708:60843:21:21:71:332:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:was similar to that observed in the 1973 OCG data.33

22:710:60897:20:21:72:254:357:144:Times:144:Times:C. Robustness of Baseline Estimates 
22:711:60932:21:21:108:532:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: The racial differences in intergenerational mobility documented above may be sensitive 
22:712:61019:21:20:72:501:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:to features of the underlying data or to choices made in the data construction process. To 
22:713:61110:20:21:72:504:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:evaluate the robustness of our results, we first address two common sources of bias in the 
22:714:61201:21:21:72:514:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:intergenerational mobility literature, lifecycle bias and attenuation bias due to measurement 
22:715:61295:21:20:72:539:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:error, before moving on to income assignment assumptions specific to our setting.  Each of these 
22:716:61392:20:21:72:304:233:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:concerns is  addressed in detail in Appendix IV.  
22:717:61442:21:21:108:542:212:144:Times:144:g_d0_f3:Lifecycle Bias. A common concern in the empirical intergenerational mobility literature is 
22:718:61533:21:21:72:529:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:that father-to-son income correlations tend to vary depending on the ages at which fathers’ and 
22:719:61629:21:20:72:512:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:sons’ incomes are measured.  This, in turn, may confound comparisons across samples that 
22:720:61718:20:21:72:530:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:observe men at different ages (e.g., see Haider and Solon 2006, Mazumder 2015).  We observe 
22:721:61810:21:31:72:537:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:sons when they are relatively young compared to what is considered ideal (around age 40) when 
22:722:61904:31:8:72:219:98:133:g_d0_f3:133:g_d0_f3:                                                   
22:723:61955:8:16:72:518:90:48:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:33 There is some attrition between the 1990 and 2000 observations of the NLSY79 cohort. Restricting to a 
22:724:62060:16:0:72:369:74:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:balanced sample has no effect on the calculated slopes from Figure 3.  
23:725:62141:0:21:72:527:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:using modern data and annual income.  We acknowledge this limitation but are somewhat less 
23:726:62232:21:21:72:525:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:concerned with this issue for two reasons.  First, the income scores reflect average income for 
23:727:62328:21:20:72:534:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:men in that occupation over all ages (for a given race/region), rather than actual annual income, 
23:728:62426:20:21:72:530:647:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:which tends to change substantially with age.  Second, we emphasize black-white comparisons 
23:729:62518:21:21:72:553:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of  rank   within datasets where black and white men are observed with similar age distributions.  
23:730:62617:21:21:72:521:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:So, biases that affect blacks and whites equally would, in a sense, difference out.34  Still, it is 
23:731:62717:21:20:72:519:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:useful to (a) test the robustness of the paper’s main conclusions to samples of sons measured 
23:732:62811:20:21:72:538:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:closer to age 40 and (b) utilize the NLSY79 panel structure to capture sons at two points in time, 
23:733:62910:21:21:72:491:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:1990 and 2000.  These additional results con  firm    the paper’s main conclusions. 
23:734:62994:21:20:107:534:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: Measurement Error.  A second common concern in the modern literature is that a single 
23:735:63080:20:21:71:523:502:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:year, or even several years, of fathers’ annual income might be a noisy measure of permanent 
23:736:63173:21:21:71:490:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:income, tending to attenuate measures of intergenerational persistence and to overstate 
23:737:63261:21:20:71:531:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:intergenerational mobility.  In this regard, our occupation-based measure of fathers’ status may 
23:738:63358:20:21:71:539:440:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:have some advantages over annual income.  It may hew closer to an individual’s long-term labor 
23:739:63453:21:21:71:516:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:market status.  Further, in the historical samples, census enumerators collected occupational 
23:740:63547:21:21:71:536:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:information even for those who were temporarily unemployed, thereby avoiding temporary zero 
23:741:63639:21:20:71:523:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:income measures.  Although the occupation-based income scores mask permanent individual-
23:742:63727:20:21:71:528:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:level    productivity differences within race/occupation/region cells, which is a limitation, it is at 
23:743:63830:21:21:72:511:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the same time unlikely that many of the relatively poor families we observe (e.g., unskilled 
23:744:63923:21:20:72:510:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:laborers) were merely having a temporary negative shock to their status or that the affluent 
23:745:64016:20:21:72:414:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:families (e.g., professionals) were having a temporary positive shock.   
23:746:64089:21:21:108:512:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: Year of Income Assignment.  A concern that is more specific to this study is that the 
23:747:64175:21:20:72:520:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:historical samples all rely heavily on the 1940 census data for income assignments, while the 
23:748:64269:20:21:72:531:233:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:1962, 1973, and 1990 cohort results rely on contemporary census data for income assignments, 
23:749:64362:21:21:72:538:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:as described above and in the  data   appendix.  There is not much that can be done to improve 
23:750:64457:21:21:72:512:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:upon these historical assignments; the main alternatives for wage information prior to 1940 
23:751:64549:21:20:72:524:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pertain to selected urban samples while   our historical samples are concentrated in the rural 
23:752:64644:20:26:72:537:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:South.  But we can assess the sensitivity of our results in the historical samples using 1960 as an 
23:753:64744:26:9:72:219:124:133:g_d0_f3:133:g_d0_f3:                                                   
23:754:64795:9:17:72:538:115:65:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:34 However, if black men progress through occupational hierarchies at slower rates than their white peers over 
23:755:64905:17:12:71:534:98:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:the lifecycle, then we are likely to understate racial differences in sons’ status by observing them at relatively 
23:756:65020:12:12:71:523:86:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:young ages.  We therefore test the robustness of the paper’s main conclusions to samples of sons measured 
23:757:65126:12:0:71:467:74:112:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:closer to age 40.  These results, found in the appendix, confirm the paper’s main conclusions. 
24:758:65230:0:21:72:518:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:Times:alternative census reference year.  Our main estimates are unaffected by this sensitivity test.

24:760:65415:21:20:71:518:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:results to definitions of “parent” in the intergenerational mobility estimates. Specifically, we 
24:761:65512:20:21:72:521:647:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:examine whether our conclusions are altered by substituting the income scores of co-resident 
24:762:65605:21:21:72:520:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:males , stepfathers or otherwise, for that of the mother in the 1962, 1973, and 1990 cohorts in 
24:763:65701:21:21:72:467:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:cases where the father is not present.  Our results are robust to these substitutions.

24:766:65806:21:21:108:514:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:  Given the racial differences in mobility conditional on fathers’ income documented 
24:767:65890:21:20:72:507:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:above, it is natural to ask how far such differences go toward explaining differences in the 
24:768:65983:20:21:72:495:502:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:distributions of sons’ labor market outcomes.  Figure 4 shows actual and counterfactual 
24:769:66071:21:21:72:492:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:distributions of black sons’ income rank, where the counterfactual allows black sons to 
24:770:66159:21:20:72:516:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:experience the transition patterns of their white peers conditional on parental income score.  
24:771:66254:20:21:72:513:440:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:These kernel densities are smoothed distributions of discrete underlying data, reflecting the 
24:772:66348:21:21:72:511:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:occupation-region-race -gender-based income score assignment process.35  We estimate the 
24:773:66437:21:21:72:542:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:counterfactual using re-weighting techniques developed in DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux (1996).  
24:774:66532:21:20:72:513:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:In essence, we up-weight white observations who are similarly situated to blacks and down-
24:775:66622:20:21:72:515:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:weight white observations who are not; the result is a counterfactual sample that has fathers 
24:776:66716:21:21:72:382:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:distributed like blacks but has the mobility patterns of whites.     
24:777:66784:21:20:108:502:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The counterfactuals indicate that differences in transition patterns are the primary 
24:778:66869:20:21:72:509:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:“proximate cause” of racial inequality in each generation of sons.  That is, for each cohort, 
24:779:66963:21:21:72:517:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:equality in transitions, conditional on fathers’ income ranks, would have greatly reduced the 
24:780:67057:21:20:72:502:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:racial inequality in sons’ incomes.  In each panel of Figure 4, the solid lines, representing 
24:781:67151:20:21:72:511:233:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:counterfactual outcomes for black sons, closely follow the dashed lines representing actual 
24:782:67243:21:21:72:522:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:outcomes of white sons.  The   effect of equalizing mobility patterns is particularly stark in the 
24:783:67342:21:21:72:485:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:lowest decile of fathers’ income scores and for the earlier cohorts in our sample.  The 
24:784:67430:21:20:72:542:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:counterfactual distributions imply that up to 55 percent of the 1900 and the 1930 cohorts of black 
24:785:67529:20:21:72:542:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:sons would have achieved “middle class   ” status (30th percentile or greater)  under this alternative 
24:786:67632:21:29:72:529:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:set of transitions.  For cohorts measured in the latter part of the 20th century, the counterfactual

24:788:67784:9:17:72:541:91:65:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:35 Densities are estimated using an adaptive bandwidth inversely proportional to the number of observations in 
24:789:67894:17:0:71:429:74:112:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:a particular area of the distribution. Results for other bandwidth choices are similar.  
25:790:67992:0:21:72:526:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:scenario displayed in Figure 4 panels C through E cannot fully explain the black men’s higher 
25:791:68086:21:21:72:540:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:concentration in the lower part of the income distribution, nor their lower concentration at higher 
25:792:68186:21:20:72:521:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:parts of the income distribution.  Still, the counterfactual black distribution makes substantial 
25:793:68284:20:21:72:536:647:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:strides toward narrowing the difference in black and white sons’ actual income score rankings.   
25:794:68381:21:21:108:530:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: To   summarize the importance of differences in mobility patterns, we calculate standard 
25:795:68470:21:21:71:532:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:measures of distance and dissimilarity between black and white sons’ actual and counterfactual 
25:796:68565:21:20:71:501:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:distributions. We find that a dissimilarity index, based on ventiles of sons’ ranks, falls by 
25:797:68659:20:21:72:540:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:between 66 and 81 percent when black sons experience white transition rates.  That is, relative to 
25:798:68758:21:21:72:519:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the actual dissimilarity index value, the counterfactual index value is much smaller for every 
25:799:68853:21:20:72:538:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:cohort.  When we use adaptive kernel density estimates (discretized into 100 bins) and Hellinger 
25:800:68950:20:21:72:509:502:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:measures of distance, the distance under the counterfactual scenario is reduced by 71 to 87 
25:801:69042:21:21:72:537:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:percent compared to the distance for the actual kernel densities.  More detailed discussion of the 
25:802:69141:21:20:72:275:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:calculations is provided in the appendix.   
25:803:69185:20:21:108:539:440:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:It is not easy to imagine this counterfactual world of rapid black progress—obviously the 
25:804:69275:21:21:72:523:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:course of American economic and social history would have been much different if, by 1900, 
25:805:69366:21:21:72:537:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:nearly half of African Americans men had achieved roughly middle class status, as evidenced in 
25:806:69461:21:20:72:530:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Figure 4B.  For perspective, in census data, the median black male ranked at the 30th percentile 
25:807:69558:20:21:72:541:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of the national distribution of earned income in 2000.36  Thus, it took 100 additional years for the 
25:808:69659:21:21:72:525:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:middle of the black male earnings distribution to reach the point that it would have reached in 
25:809:69755:21:20:72:518:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:1900 had the black sons in our sample transitioned across income ranks like white sons with

26:827:71009:21:21:72:541:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:controls for fathers’  rank reduces the magnitude of the coefficient on race to -10.6 in 1990 (down

26:834:71646:21:21:72:540:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:places in the South, children in poor black families and poor white families experienced not only

26:842:72357:21:20:71:500:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:human capital disparities for the cohort of sons observed in 1930 (National Archives and

26:844:72542:21:21:71:537:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:timing (i.e., 1943 versus 1930), we use this sample to calculate black and white   men’s mean test

26:846:72735:20:21:72:540:233:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:designed to help sort men into military occupations; the tests emphasized arithmetic, vocabulary, 
26:847:72833:21:21:72:539:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and block counting (i.e., visualizing three-dimensional relationships) (Ferrie, Rolf, and Troesken

26:849:73028:21:35:72:526:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:experiences in and out of school, including both substantive knowledge and test-taking skills.

26:854:73406:8:16:72:529:90:48:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:38 When there were fewer than 50 observations in a race-by-region-by-occupation cell, we moved to race-by-
26:855:73512:16:0:71:145:74:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:occupation cells. 
27:856:73539:0:21:72:538:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:We merge the test score information, by race, region, and occupation, with our 1910-30 dataset.  
27:857:73636:21:21:72:528:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Blacks’ imputed test scores are lower than whites’ on average, and the test scores are strongly, 
27:858:73733:21:20:72:538:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:positively correlated with the sons’ earnings rank.  In  a parsimonious regression that controls for 
27:859:73834:20:21:71:535:647:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:fathers’ rank, adding flexible controls for AGCT score reduces the race coefficient to -6.8 (from 
27:860:73932:21:21:71:121:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:-22.7).39   
27:861:73944:21:21:108:524:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Thus, in both historical and modern datasets, black-white differences in test scores are 
27:862:74033:21:20:71:536:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:strongly connected to differences in economic mobility.  Human capital differences cannot fully 
27:863:74129:20:21:72:518:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:account for the racial mobility gap, but their empirical relevance is clear.  Understanding the 
27:864:74225:21:21:72:537:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:origins of human capital gaps and reducing their intergenerational transmission may be a critical

27:868:74437:14:14:72:75:471:144:Times:144:Times: 
27:869:74437:14:20:108:543:457:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:After the Civil War, African Americans occupied the lowest rungs on the national income 
27:870:74525:20:21:72:539:437:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ladder.  A substantial literature documents that, 150 years later, black  men  ’s average and median 
27:871:74625:21:21:72:515:416:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:incomes remain far below those of whites.  Indeed, black men   are still disproportionately 
27:872:74717:21:20:71:541:395:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:concentrated in the lowest tiers of the income distribution.  The new data and analyses developed 
27:873:74815:20:21:71:524:375:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in this paper show that the headwinds black men have faced are race-specific in the sense that 
27:874:74910:21:21:72:533:354:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:white men from similarly disadvantaged backgrounds experienced greater upward mobility and 
27:875:75001:21:20:72:517:333:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:higher average income in every cohort.  In terms of expected rank in the income distribution 
27:876:75094:20:21:72:514:313:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:conditional on their father’s rank, the size of the black disadvantage has remained large and 
27:877:75188:21:21:72:527:292:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:consistent from the late 19th to the end of 20th century, at around 20 percentile points.  Perhaps 
27:878:75287:21:21:72:529:271:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:surprisingly, even    major changes in discriminatory policies and institutions associated with the 
27:879:75387:21:20:72:513:250:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Civil Rights Movement have had limited power to alter the intergenerational dynamics that 
27:880:75477:20:21:72:318:230:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:propagate racial disparities in material wellbeing.   
27:881:75531:21:21:108:519:209:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Our   results suggest that racial differences in intergenerational mobility have been the 
27:882:75621:21:20:72:510:188:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:most important proximate cause of black-white income inequality from the Civil War until 
27:883:75710:20:21:71:527:168:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:today.  Counterfactuals that equalize mobility a cross races, conditional on parents’ status, go a 
27:884:75809:21:36:71:523:147:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:long way toward equalizing distributions of earnings scores in every generation we examine.

27:887:76066:16:12:72:533:86:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:effects after rounding imputed AGCT to nearest integer.  Restricting the sample to the range of AGCT scores 
27:888:76174:12:0:72:375:74:112:g_d0_f3:112:g_d0_f3:that includes both white and black men, the coefficient on race is -5.7.

28:892:76548:20:21:72:207:647:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and is far from complete.

28:895:76754:21:20:72:539:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:intergenerational convergence in labor market outcomes.  Although the barriers have varied over 
28:896:76850:20:21:72:515:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:time, structural impediments to black children’s accumulation of human capital have been a 
28:897:76941:21:21:72:513:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:long-standing feature of U.S. history, most obviously through slavery and then a century of 
28:898:77033:21:20:72:493:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:separate and unequal schools.  Even after school desegregation in the 1960s and 1970s, 
28:899:77120:20:21:72:542:502:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:residential segregation, which peaked around 1970 (Cutler, Glaeser, and Vigdor 1999, Logan and
