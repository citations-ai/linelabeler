2:22:833:49:24:72:540:575:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:This paper provides a welfare economic analysis of the problem of districting. In the context of a
2:23:931:24:24:72:540:551:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:simple micro-founded model intended to capture the salient features of U.S. politics, it studies how
2:24:1031:24:24:72:540:527:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:a  social  planner  should  allocate  citizens  of  different  ideologies  across  districts  to  maximize
2:25:1137:24:24:72:539:503:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:aggregate utility. In the model, districting determines the equilibrium seat-vote curve which is the
2:26:1237:24:24:72:540:479:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:relationship between the aggregate vote share of the political parties and their share of seats in the
2:27:1339:24:24:72:540:455:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:legislature. To understand optimal districting, the paper first characterizes the optimal seat-vote
2:28:1438:24:24:72:540:431:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:curve which describes the ideal relationship between votes and seats. It then shows that under rather
2:29:1539:24:24:72:540:407:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:weak  conditions  the  optimal  seat-vote  curve  is  implementable  in  the  sense  that  there  exist
2:30:1642:24:24:72:540:383:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:districtings which make the equilibrium seat-vote curve equal to the optimal seat-vote curve. The
2:31:1739:24:24:72:540:359:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:nature of these optimal districtings is described. Finally, the paper provides a full characterization
2:32:1841:24:27:72:540:335:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of the constrained optimal seat-vote curve and the districtings that underlie it when the optimal seat-
2:33:1944:27:28:72:209:308:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:vote curve is not achievable.

3:47:2184:29:19:95:517:634:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Districting plans, which allocate voters across districts for the purpose of electing representa-
3:48:2281:19:20:95:517:615:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:tives to a central legislature, are frequently perceived as unfair to voters of certain ideologies
3:49:2379:20:19:95:518:595:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:or race. These perceptions of unfairness have lead to conflicts over how district lines should be
3:50:2476:19:19:95:518:576:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:drawn. As computer technology and the information available to officials charged with districting
3:51:2573:19:19:95:518:557:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:have improved, districting plans have become more refined, and these conflicts between groups
3:52:2666:19:19:95:518:538:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:of voters have intensified.  As a result of these conflicts, courts have become more involved in
3:53:2762:19:19:95:518:519:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the process, and independent commissions have been established in some cases to oversee the
3:54:2853:19:19:95:177:500:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:districting process.
3:55:2873:19:19:110:518:481:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:There is little consensus, however, on what typesof districting plans are socially desirable.
3:56:2966:19:20:95:518:462:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Should all districts be identical in their composition of voter types or should districts be heteroge-
3:57:3068:20:19:95:517:442:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:nous? Should all districts be competitive or should some districts be “safe seats”? How should
3:58:3162:19:19:95:517:423:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the allocation of seats in the legislature respond to changes in national support for the parties?
3:59:3260:19:19:95:517:404:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Should the system be biased in favor of certain groups of voters? In addressing these normative
3:60:3355:19:19:95:517:385:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:questions, some have advocated an axiomatic approach, which adheres as closely as possible to
3:61:3448:19:19:95:517:366:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:“traditional districting principles”, such as thespatial notions of compactness and contiguity as
3:62:3545:19:19:95:518:347:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:well as the democratic ideals of respecting political subdivisions and recognizing communities of
3:63:3642:19:19:95:196:328:100:g_d0_f4:49:g_d0_f7:actual shared interest.1
3:64:3666:19:20:110:518:309:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:As an alternative to this axiomatic method of evaluating districting plans, this paper explores
3:65:3761:20:19:95:518:289:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:an approach rooted in traditional welfare economics. This approach begins with the observation
3:66:3855:19:19:95:517:270:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:that citizens have preferences over policy outcomes, which depend upon the representation of
3:67:3947:19:19:95:518:251:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:groups of voters in the legislature, which in turn depends upon how different groups of voters are
3:68:4045:19:19:95:517:232:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:allocated across districts. This induced linkage between citizen preferences and districting plans
3:69:4143:19:19:95:518:213:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:allows for an explicit characterization of how different groups of voters should be allocated across
3:70:4243:19:19:95:288:194:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:districts in order to maximize social welfare.
3:71:4289:19:20:110:517:175:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:The paper studies a theoretical model of a community divided into political districts each of
3:72:4382:20:19:95:517:155:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:which elects a single representative to a legislature. There are three types of voters: Democrats,
3:73:4480:19:19:95:517:136:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Republicans, and Independents. Democrats and Republicans havefixed ideologies, while Inde-
3:74:4570:19:19:95:518:117:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:pendents’ ideologies may vary across elections. There are two political parties, one representing
3:75:4667:19:12:106:518:98:36:g_d0_f8:65:g_d0_f9:1The U.S. Supreme Court defined traditional districting principles in 1990s redistricting cases, including Shaw

4:77:4811:0:19:95:520:663:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Democrats and the other Republicans. These partiesfieldcandidatesineachdistrictandthecan-
4:78:4900:19:20:95:517:644:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:didates with the most votes are elected. The legislature’s policy choices depend upon the average
4:79:4997:20:19:95:518:624:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:ideology of the elected legislators which in turndepends upon the share of seats each party holds
4:80:5094:19:19:95:517:605:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f11:in the legislature. The allocation of voters across districts determines theequilibrium seat-vote
4:81:5191:19:19:95:518:586:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f4:curvewhich is the relationship between the aggregate vote share of the two parties and their share
4:82:5289:19:19:95:518:567:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:of seats. This relationship determines how responsive the legislature’s policy choices are to swings
4:83:5389:19:19:95:490:548:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:in the aggregate vote share created by changesin the ideological leanings of Independents.
4:84:5479:19:19:110:517:529:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:In the context of this model, we analyze how the three types of voters should be allocated across
4:85:5576:19:19:95:517:510:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f11:districts to maximize social welfare. We approach the problem byfirst characterizing theoptimal
4:86:5671:19:20:95:517:491:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f4:seat-vote curve, which relates the optimal fraction of Democrats in the legislature to the aggregate
4:87:5771:20:19:95:518:471:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:fraction of voters supporting Democrat candidates across all districts. Under our assumptions,
4:88:5865:19:19:95:517:452:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the optimal relationship between aggregate votes and seats is linear, with a slope that depends
4:89:5960:19:19:95:518:433:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:on the degree of variation in the preferences of Independents. Interestingly, we alsofind that the
4:90:6058:19:19:95:465:414:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:optimal seat-vote curve is biased in favor of the party with the largest partisan base.
4:91:6145:19:19:110:518:395:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:We then explore whether this optimal seat-vote curve isimplementable, in the sense that there
4:92:6238:19:19:95:517:376:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:exist feasible allocations of Democrat, Republican, and Independent citizens across districts that
4:93:6336:19:19:95:517:357:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:would make the equilibrium seat-vote curve equal to the optimal seat-vote curve.  If so, then
4:94:6429:19:20:95:517:338:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:such allocations clearly represent socially optimal districtings. We develop simple necessary and
4:95:6526:20:19:95:518:318:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:sufficient conditions for the optimal seat-vote curve to be implementable. These conditions are in
4:96:6624:19:19:95:517:299:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:terms of the fractions of the various groups in the community and the Independents’ preference

4:98:6807:19:19:110:517:261:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:While the conditions under which the optimal seat-vote curve is implementable are permissive,
4:99:6900:19:19:95:518:242:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:there are interesting situations in which they are not satisfied. To characterize optimal alloca-
4:100:6997:19:19:95:518:223:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:tions of voters across districts in these cases requires a more sophisticated approach. First, we
4:101:7094:19:20:95:517:204:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:must characterize implementable seat-vote curves - those that can be generated by some feasible
4:102:7189:20:19:95:518:184:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:districting. Then, we must choose the best of these implementable seat-vote curves. We develop
4:103:7283:19:19:95:518:165:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:an analytical approach that permits a complete characterization of the shape of the constrained
4:104:7378:19:19:95:518:146:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:optimal seat-vote curve. We also identify the districtings that generate these constrained optimal
4:105:7476:19:19:95:167:127:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:seat-vote curves.
4:106:7493:19:19:110:518:108:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Throughout the paper we ignore geographical constraints in the way in which districts may
4:107:7582:19:0:95:518:89:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:be formed. Thus, we assume that the planner can allocate citizens to districts in any way he
5:108:7675:0:19:95:518:663:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:likes, rather than requiring districts be connected subsets of some geographic space. While this is
5:109:7774:19:20:95:518:644:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:certainly a weakness of the analysis, we feel that given the difficulty of knowing how to model geo-
5:110:7874:20:19:95:518:624:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:graphic constraints, it makes sense tofirst understand what optimal districtings look like without
5:111:7972:19:19:95:518:605:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:them. Moreover, when the optimal seat-vote curveis implementable, we show that it can typically
5:112:8067:19:19:95:517:586:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:be implemented by a large class of districtings, some of which look quite “straightforward”, and
5:113:8163:19:19:95:392:567:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:hence geographic constraints may actually be easily accommodated.
5:114:8228:19:19:110:518:548:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:This paperfits into the growing literature applying contemporary political economy modelling

5:122:8991:19:19:95:518:395:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:(2000)). The districting problem is somewhat different from these constitutional design questions
5:123:9088:19:19:95:517:376:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:in that it must be done on an on-going basis in any political system with geographically based
5:124:9182:19:19:95:331:357:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:districts. This makes the problem particularly salient.
5:125:9237:19:20:110:517:338:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:The organization of the remainder of the paper is as follows. The next section discusses the
5:126:9329:20:19:95:518:318:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:relationship of the analysis to the existing literature on districting. Section 3 outlines the model
5:127:9429:19:19:95:517:299:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:and introduces the notion of an equilibrium seat-vote curve. Section 4 introduces the idea of the
5:128:9526:19:19:95:518:280:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:optimal seat-vote curve and characterizes it. This section also shows that the optimal seat-vote
5:129:9622:19:19:95:517:261:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:curve is not necessarily implementable.  Section 5 describes a general method for determining
5:130:9715:19:19:95:518:242:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:whether a seat-vote curve is implementable and this is used in Section 6 tofind the conditions
5:131:9809:19:19:95:518:223:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:under which the optimal seat-vote curve is implementable. Section 7 characterizes the constrained
5:132:9906:19:20:95:518:204:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:optimal seat-vote curve and discusses the districtings that generate it. Section 8 discusses the role
5:133:10007:20:19:95:517:184:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:of some of the key assumptions of the model and Section 9 concludes with a summary of the
5:134:10096:19:19:95:193:165:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:lessons of the analysis.

6:137:10305:0:29:95:376:663:209:g_d0_f3:209:g_d0_f3:2  Relation to the districting literature
6:138:10346:29:19:95:518:634:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:There are two strands of political science literature on districting - one empirical and the other
6:139:10444:19:20:95:517:615:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:theoretical. The main focus of the empirical literature has been on understanding how redistricting
6:140:10543:20:19:95:517:595:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:in the U.S. States has impactedpartisan biasandresponsiveness. In a two-party system, partisan
6:141:10637:19:19:95:517:576:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:bias and responsiveness are conceptualized in terms of properties of theseat-vote curvethat a
6:142:10730:19:19:95:516:557:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f12:districting generates. The seat-vote curve is formally represented by a functionS(V)whereV
6:143:10820:19:19:95:518:538:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:is the aggregate fraction of votes received by (say) the Democrats andSis the fraction of seats
6:144:10915:19:19:95:518:519:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:in the legislature that they hold. A seat-vote curve exhibitspartisan symmetryif the fraction of
6:145:11011:19:19:95:518:500:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:seats that one Party gets with any particularshare of the vote is the same as the other Party
6:146:11104:19:19:95:518:481:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:would receive with the same share. Formally, the condition is thatS(V)=1−S(1−V) for all
6:147:11191:19:20:95:518:462:100:g_d0_f12:100:g_d0_f4:V. A seat-vote curve exhibitspartisan biasif it deviates from partisan symmetry in a systematic

6:149:11371:19:19:95:517:423:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:proportionate change in seat share following an increase in vote share. If the seat-vote curve is
6:150:11468:19:19:95:491:404:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:differentiable, then its responsiveness at vote shareVis measured by the derivativeS0(V).
6:151:11557:19:19:110:517:385:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:A common approach in the literature has been to specify parameterized functional forms for
6:152:11647:19:19:95:521:366:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:seat-vote curves and estimate them. One popular specification is thelinear seat-vote curve,which
6:153:11743:19:19:95:171:347:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:can be written as
6:154:11760:19:7:249:291:328:100:g_d0_f12:100:g_d0_f4:S(V)=1

6:160:11869:19:19:95:518:286:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Tufte (1973) estimates linear seat-vote curves using historical data for the U.K., the U.S., New
6:161:11965:19:19:95:518:267:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Zealand and three U.S. States and found that the linear formfits the data well.3In an influential
6:162:12062:19:25:95:518:248:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:series of papers, Gary King and co-authors worked withbilogit seat-vote curvesof the general form

6:167:12186:27:19:95:517:196:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Again, the parametersbandrcan be interpreted as measuring bias and responsiveness.4This
6:168:12273:19:18:95:517:177:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:family of curves admits a broad range of possible shapes (see Browning and King (1987) and King
6:169:12368:18:12:106:517:159:36:g_d0_f8:65:g_d0_f9:3He found, for example, that for New York State in the time period 1934-66 withSmeasuring democratic seats,
6:170:12475:12:12:95:238:147:65:g_d0_f17:65:g_d0_f9:requalled 1.28 andbequalled−0.055.
6:171:12509:12:12:106:517:135:36:g_d0_f8:65:g_d0_f9:4To see this, consider the equivalent log-odds formulation: ln [S(V)/(1−S(V))] =b+rln [V/(1−V)].This
6:172:12609:12:10:95:518:123:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:makes clear that the responsiveness parameterrdetermines how changes in votes are translated into changes
6:173:12714:10:9:95:518:113:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:in seats.   Further, note that when voters are equally divided between parties [V=0.5], seats are given by
6:174:12820:9:10:95:521:104:65:g_d0_f17:65:g_d0_f9:S=exp(b)/[1 + exp(b)],and Democrats thus secure a majority (minority) of seats if the bias parameter (b)is
6:175:12926:10:9:95:517:94:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:positive (negative). While these parameters share the same interpretation as Tufte (1973), the exact formulations
6:176:13039:9:0:95:182:85:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:are somewhat different.
7:177:13063:0:19:95:518:663:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:(1989)). King (1989) developed techniques to estimate bias and responsiveness parameters using
7:178:13157:19:20:95:286:644:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:only data from a single redistricting period.
7:179:13202:20:19:110:518:624:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Gelman and King (1990), (1994) significantly advance the literature by dispensing with the
7:180:13292:19:19:95:518:605:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:assumption of a particular functional form for the seat-vote curve. Instead, they specify an under-
7:181:13391:19:19:95:517:586:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:lying statistical model of the district-by-district vote generating process which implies a relation-
7:182:13492:19:19:95:517:567:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:ship between expected votes and expected seats.They then develop a procedure for estimating
7:183:13583:19:19:95:517:548:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the parameters of this underlying statistical model and explore how the implied relationship be-
7:184:13679:19:19:95:517:529:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:tween seats and votes is impacted by redistricting. In particular, they study whether cross-state
7:185:13776:19:19:95:518:510:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:variation in redistricting institutions gives rise to systematically different patterns of change in
7:186:13876:19:20:95:200:491:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:bias and responsiveness.
7:187:13900:20:19:110:517:471:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:While this general line of inquiry strikes us as very interesting, the underlying foundations of
7:188:13996:19:19:95:518:452:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the analysis are somewhat opaque. Rather than beginning with a functional form for the seat-vote
7:189:14092:19:19:95:518:433:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:curve or a statistical model for the vote generating process, it would seem more satisfying to begin
7:190:14192:19:19:95:518:414:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:with a description of the voters, their political preferences and what is generating the variation in
7:191:14293:19:19:95:518:395:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:these preferences. A districting, or distribution of voter types across districts, would then imply
7:192:14392:19:19:95:518:376:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:both a district-specific vote generating process and a seat-vote curve. It would also seem useful to
7:193:14492:19:19:95:517:357:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:spell out how the composition of the legislature matters for citizens’ welfare, so that the normative
7:194:14593:19:20:95:382:338:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:significance of partisan bias and responsiveness could be assessed.
7:195:14660:20:19:110:517:318:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:The theoretical literature has largely focused on understanding how political districts should
7:196:14754:19:19:95:518:299:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:be crafted with the aim of maximizing a Party’s expected seat share. Its motivation has been the
7:197:14850:19:19:95:517:280:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:purely positive one of shedding light on how partisan redistricting committees might further their
7:198:14948:19:19:95:521:261:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:political objectives. Important strategies for expected seat maximization areconcentration-the
7:199:15042:19:19:95:518:242:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:packing of an opponent’s supporters into a few districts - anddispersion- the spreading of the
7:200:15136:19:19:95:294:223:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:remainder thinly over the remaining districts.
7:201:15182:19:20:110:518:204:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Owen and Grofman (1988) present a classic analysis of this problem that incorporates aggregate
7:202:15276:20:19:95:517:184:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:uncertainty in voters’ behavior (see also Gilligan and Matsusaka (1999) and Sherstyuk (1998)).
7:203:15370:19:19:95:518:165:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Their model assumes that each districtjis characterized by some thresholdαj∈[−1,1] and that
7:204:15461:19:19:95:517:146:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:there is some random variableZsuch that districtjvotes for the Party controlling the districting
7:205:15557:19:19:95:518:127:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:if and only ifαj<Z. The districting determines theαjfor each district, but subject to two
7:206:15646:19:0:95:460:108:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:constraints. First, ify(α) is the fraction of districts withαj=α,itisrequiredthat
7:207:15727:0:10:460:471:115:100:g_d0_f21:100:g_d0_f21:P
7:208:15728:10:16:470:521:105:49:g_d0_f22:100:g_d0_f4:αy(α)=1.
7:209:15736:16:0:95:438:89:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Second, the average value of the thresholds across districts must be zero, so that
7:210:15818:0:10:442:453:96:100:g_d0_f21:100:g_d0_f21:P
7:211:15819:10:0:452:521:86:49:g_d0_f22:100:g_d0_f4:ααy(α)dα=0.
8:212:15831:0:19:95:518:663:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:The districting problem is to choose the functiony(α) to maximize the controlling Party’s expected
8:213:15929:19:20:95:518:644:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:seat share. The solution is very simple: there exists someα∗>0suchthaty(−1) =α∗/(1 +α∗)
8:214:16016:20:19:95:518:624:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:andy(α∗)=1/(1 +α∗). Thus, a fractionα∗/(1 +α∗) of districts will be overwhelmingly for the
8:215:16106:19:19:95:469:605:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:opposition, while the complementary fraction will be solidly for the controlling Party.
8:216:16193:19:19:110:518:586:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:While the principles emerging from the theoretical literature seem natural, the mapping from
8:217:16285:19:19:95:517:567:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the models used to the problem of districting is again somewhat opaque. For example, in Owen
8:218:16377:19:19:95:518:548:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:and Grofman’s formulation it is not clear precisely what the thresholdαjis, nor why the average
8:219:16472:19:19:95:518:529:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:value of the thresholds across districts must bezero. Moreover, the interpretation of the random
8:220:16568:19:19:95:188:510:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:variableZis unclear.
8:221:16588:19:20:110:518:491:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:What our paper contributes to both the empiricaland theoretical literatures is a micro-founded
8:222:16682:20:19:95:517:471:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:model for the study of districting questions. The model is simple, but captures important aspects of
8:223:16782:19:19:95:517:452:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the U.S. political scene. It permits a clear understanding of the mapping between districtings and
8:224:16880:19:19:95:517:433:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:seat-vote curves. It also provides a consistent story for why the properties of the seat-vote curve
8:225:16979:19:19:95:518:414:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:matter for welfare, as is implicitly assumed in the empirical literature. As in Owen and Grofman’s
8:226:17077:19:19:95:517:395:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:theoretical analysis, each district does indeed have a critical threshold and this threshold depends
8:227:17177:19:19:95:518:376:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:upon the distribution of voter types in the district.5The random variable in the model is the
8:228:17270:19:19:95:518:357:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:distribution of the aggregate vote between the two Parties and this randomness is generated by
8:229:17364:19:20:95:368:338:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:variation in the ideological attachments of Independent voters.
8:230:17427:20:19:110:517:318:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Some of the same concerns about the empirical literature on seat-vote curves motivate the
8:231:17516:19:19:95:518:299:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:independent work of Besley and Preston (2005).  These authors develop an alternative micro-
8:232:17607:19:19:95:518:280:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:founded model that generates an equilibrium relationship between seats and votes. They use their
8:233:17703:19:19:95:517:261:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:model to solve for what the distribution of voter types must be across districts if the equilibrium
8:234:17802:19:19:95:517:242:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:seat-vote curve is to be of the bilogit form. Their main theoretical point is to show that this
8:235:17897:19:19:95:517:223:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:distribution, and hence the shape of the seat-vote curve, is a key determinant of Parties’ electoral
8:236:17997:19:20:95:518:204:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:incentives to put in effort on the part of their constituents.They provide empirical evidence in
8:237:18093:20:19:95:517:184:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:favor of their theory by showing that local government performance in the U.K. is related to
8:238:18185:19:19:95:517:165:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the parameters of the local seat-vote curve in the way the theory suggests. Their work therefore
8:239:18281:19:19:95:517:146:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:suggests a novel theoretical mechanism why the form of the seat-vote curve (and hence districting)
8:240:18379:19:19:95:517:127:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:matters for citizens’ welfare and provides evidence for this. By contrast, our model reflects the
8:241:18476:19:13:106:518:108:36:g_d0_f8:65:g_d0_f9:5As we will note, however, Owen and Grofman’s constraint that the average threshold is zero is not implied by
8:242:18585:13:0:95:134:95:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:the model.
9:243:18596:0:19:95:517:663:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:conventional view that districting matters because it determines which Party gets the most seats
9:244:18692:19:20:95:339:644:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:and hence the ideological composition of the legislature.
9:245:18749:20:19:110:517:624:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Also in the spirit of this paper is the recent work of Epstein and O’Hallaran (2004) on
9:246:18836:19:19:95:518:605:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:racial gerrymandering.6They seek to understand the allocation of voter types across dis-
9:247:18924:19:19:95:517:586:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:tricts that would maximize the welfare of blacks. Their model formalizes the intuition that there
9:248:19021:19:19:95:518:567:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:maybe a trade-offbetween descriptive and substantive representation.  Descriptive representa-
9:249:19114:19:19:95:517:548:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:tion is achieved by having districts elect black representatives, while substantive representation
9:250:19212:19:19:95:517:529:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:is achieved when the legislature chooses policies that favor black voters.  Maximizing descrip-
9:251:19307:19:19:95:518:510:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:tive representation may require concentrating black voters into majority-minority districts, while
9:252:19405:19:20:95:517:491:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:maximizing substantive representation may require a more even spreading of black voters. The
9:253:19497:20:19:95:517:471:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:underlying structure of Esptein and O’Hallaran’s model is simpler than the one presented here in
9:254:19593:19:19:95:517:452:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:that it does not allow for Independents and there is no aggregate uncertainty in voters’ prefer-
9:255:19689:19:19:95:517:433:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:ences. On the other hand, to incorporate substantive representation, they model strategic policy
9:256:19785:19:33:95:458:414:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:choices on the part of politicians, whereas in our model parties’ positions arefixed.

9:258:19879:29:19:95:526:352:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:We consider a community divided intonequally sized districts, indexed byi=1, ..., n.Policies
9:259:19971:19:19:95:518:333:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:are chosen by a legislature consisting of a representative from each district. Each district chooses
9:260:20071:19:19:95:518:314:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:its representative in an election. The policy outcomes chosen by the legislature depend upon the
9:261:20167:19:19:95:503:295:100:g_d0_f4:49:g_d0_f7:average ideology of the elected representatives, where ideology is measured on a 0 to 1 scale.7
9:262:20262:19:20:110:518:276:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:In terms of ideologies, citizens are divided into three groups - Democrats, Republicans, and
9:263:20354:20:19:95:517:256:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Independents. Democrats and Republicans have ideologies 0 and 1, respectively. Independents
9:264:20445:19:12:106:518:237:36:g_d0_f8:65:g_d0_f9:6See also the interesting work of Shotts (2002) who studies the impact of federally mandated majority-minority
9:265:20555:12:10:95:517:225:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:districts on policy outcomes under the assumptions that districting at the state level is done by partisan districters
9:266:20673:10:12:95:349:215:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:and that the median voter theorem applies in district level elections.
9:267:20743:12:12:106:517:203:36:g_d0_f8:65:g_d0_f9:7This assumption should be distinguished from the obvious alternative that the policy outcome chosen by
9:268:20846:12:10:95:518:191:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:the legislature depends upon the median ideology of the elected representatives.  While it is certainly possible
9:269:20958:10:9:95:517:181:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:to undertake the analysis under the median assumption, it implies that the properties of the seat-vote curve are
9:270:21070:9:9:95:518:172:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:irrelevant for citizens’ welfare over almost of its range and hence makes the problem much less interesting. For
9:271:21182:9:10:95:517:163:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:example, suppose that the aggregate vote for Democrats increases from 30% to 40% and suppose their initial seat
9:272:21293:10:9:95:517:153:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:share is 30%. Then whether their seat share increases to 35% or 45% has no impact on policy because in either
9:273:21402:9:10:95:518:144:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:situation the median legislator remains a Republican. Thus, the responsiveness of the seat-vote curve over this
9:274:21513:10:9:95:517:134:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:range is irrelevant. All that matters for welfare is the vote share at which the Democrats become the majority
9:275:21623:9:10:95:517:125:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:party. In essence, to make sense of the concern in the districting literature over the responsiveness of seat-vote
9:276:21737:10:9:95:517:115:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:curves one needs to assume something like average legislator ideology matters and this motivates the modelling
9:277:21847:9:10:95:518:106:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:choice we have made. From a theoretical perspective, whether policy choices reflect the preferences of the median
9:278:21960:10:0:95:391:96:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:or mean legislator ultimately depends upon the nature of legislative bargaining.
10:279:22041:0:19:95:518:663:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:have ideologies that are uniformly distributed on the interval [m−τ,m+τ]whereτ>0. Reflecting
10:280:22133:19:20:95:517:644:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:thefluid nature of these voters’ attitudes, the ideology of the median Independent is ex ante
10:281:22226:20:19:95:518:624:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f13:uncertain. Specifically,mis the realization of a random variable uniformly distributed on [1/2−
10:282:22321:19:19:95:518:605:100:g_d0_f20:100:g_d0_f4:ε,1/2+ε], whereε∈(0,τ)andε+τ≤1/2.The latter assumption guarantees that the ideologies
10:283:22406:19:19:95:518:586:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:of the Independents are always between those ofDemocrats and Republicans, while the former
10:284:22496:19:19:95:517:567:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:guarantees that some Independents lean Democrat and some lean Republican. The fraction of

10:286:22677:19:19:95:518:529:100:g_d0_f20:100:g_d0_f4:πR(i)andπI(i).8LetπD,πRandπIdenote, respectively, the fraction of voters in the entire
10:287:22763:19:19:95:376:510:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:community who are Democrats, Republicans, and Independents.
10:288:22822:19:20:110:517:491:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Each district must elect a representative.  Candidates are put forward by two political or-
10:289:22913:20:19:95:518:471:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:ganizations: the Democrat and Republican Parties.  Following thecitizen-candidate approach,
10:290:23004:19:19:95:518:452:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:candidates are citizens and are characterized by their ideologies (see Besley and Coate (1997)
10:291:23098:19:19:95:517:433:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:and Osborne and Slivinski (1996)). Each Party must select from the ranks of its membership,
10:292:23189:19:19:95:517:414:100:g_d0_f4:49:g_d0_f7:so that the Democrat Party always selects a Democrat and the Republican Party a Republican.9
10:293:23281:19:19:103:518:395:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Elections are held simultaneously in each of thendistricts and the candidate with the most
10:294:23371:19:19:95:517:376:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f20:votes wins. If the average ideology of the elected representatives isα0, a citizen with ideologyα
10:295:23468:19:19:95:481:357:100:g_d0_f4:49:g_d0_f7:experiences a payoffgiven by−(α−α0)2. Thus, citizens have quadratic loss functions.10
10:296:23553:19:20:110:518:338:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:In each district, every citizen votes sincerely for the representative whose ideology is closest
10:297:23649:20:19:95:518:318:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:to his own.11Accordingly, if the median independent has ideologym, the fraction of voters in
10:298:23741:19:12:106:518:299:36:g_d0_f8:65:g_d0_f9:8Note for future reference that sinceπR(i)=1−πI(i)−πD(i) the allocation of voters in districtiis fully
10:299:23843:12:13:95:229:287:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f17:described by the pair (πD(i),πI(i)).
10:300:23879:13:12:106:518:274:36:g_d0_f8:65:g_d0_f9:9This assumption substantially simplifies the problem because it means that Parties have no strategic choices
10:301:23988:12:10:95:517:262:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:to make as regards candidates. It would be interesting to extend the model to allow Parties someflexibility in
10:302:24098:10:9:95:518:252:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:candidate choice, perhaps by assuming that Democratsand Republicans come in varying ideologies (as in Coate
10:303:24205:9:9:95:517:243:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:(2004b)). Districting would then shape the incentives for Parties to put up moderate or extreme candidates. It is

10:305:24423:10:9:95:517:224:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:adopt the ideology that makes them most likely to win would devoid the problem of much of its content. In each
10:306:24533:9:10:95:517:215:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:district both Parties’ candidates would adopt the position of the expected median voter and which candidate won
10:307:24644:10:9:95:518:205:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:would have no signifcance for welfare. Thus, while the problem of optimal districting could still be posed, the
10:308:24755:9:12:95:464:196:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:seat-vote curve and the ideas of partisan bias or responsiveness would cease to have much meaning.
10:309:24853:12:13:103:518:184:36:g_d0_f8:65:g_d0_f9:10The roles of this assumption and the assumption that the ideologies of the Independents are uniformly dis-
10:310:24961:13:10:95:225:171:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:tributed are discussed in Section 8.
10:311:24997:10:12:103:518:161:36:g_d0_f8:65:g_d0_f9:11This is an assumption. An Independent voter who leans Democrat may be better offif his district elects
10:312:25101:12:10:95:518:149:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:a Republican if other districts disproportionately elect Democrats. For the average legislator ideology would be
10:313:25213:10:9:95:518:139:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:closer to his ideal point if his district elected a Republican. As an empirical matter, however, it is not clear that
10:314:25330:9:10:95:517:130:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:most voters are this sophisticated. Similar incentives to diverge from voting for the candidate closest to one’s own
10:315:25446:10:9:95:517:120:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:ideology arise when voters are electing congressional and presidential candidates and the policy outcome depends

10:318:25783:9:0:95:336:92:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:(2004) estimate that the vast majority (82%-93%) vote sincerely.

11:361:27390:13:9:95:517:136:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:Grofman’s (1988) analysis of optimal partisan districting discussed in section 2. The vote threshold in district

11:363:27607:9:10:95:518:118:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:the vote thresholds across districts. However, the average value of the thresholdsPni=1V∗(i)/nis not constant
11:364:27716:10:12:95:518:108:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:across districtings as Owen and Grofman’s analysis assumes it must be.  We have thatPni=1V∗(i)=πD+

12:369:28075:29:19:95:517:601:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:We are interested in the problem of a planner who must choose how to allocate citizens across
12:370:28168:19:19:95:518:582:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the districts to maximize aggregate utility. The districting matters for welfare because, as just
12:371:28265:19:20:95:517:563:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:demonstrated, it determines the equilibrium relationship between aggregate votes and the com-
12:372:28358:20:19:95:517:543:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:position of the legislature - the equilibrium seat-vote curve. It is important to note, however,
12:373:28454:19:19:95:518:524:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:that there is not a one-to-one mapping between districtings and seat-vote curves. The seat-vote
12:374:28549:19:19:95:518:505:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:curve is determined by the pattern of critical votethresholds across districts. As is clear from
12:375:28645:19:19:95:518:486:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:(7), the same pattern of critical vote thresholds could in principle be achieved by many different
12:376:28743:19:19:95:517:467:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:districtings. Thus, the problem is not as simple as writing welfare as a function of the allocation
12:377:28842:19:19:95:308:448:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:of citizens and choosing the best such allocation.
12:378:28892:19:20:110:517:429:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:To solve the problem, we need to think of the planner as choosing the seat-vote curve but

12:380:29070:19:19:95:518:390:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:will then be those that are associated with the constrained optimal seat-vote curve. However, this
12:381:29168:19:19:95:518:371:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:is a hard problem, because of the difficulties in formalizing the constraint that a seat-vote curve be
12:382:29270:19:19:95:518:352:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:an equilibrium for some districting. Accordingly,we will begin our analysis by characterizing the
12:383:29367:19:19:95:518:333:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:optimal relationship between seats and aggregate votes - the optimal seat-vote curve - ignoring
12:384:29462:19:19:95:518:314:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the constraint that it be an equilibrium for some districting. We will then investigate whether
12:385:29557:19:19:95:517:295:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:there exist allocations of voters that generate this optimal seat-vote curve. If there do exist such
12:386:29657:19:20:95:518:276:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:districtings, these will clearly be optimal. This two-stage procedure will not totally eliminate the
12:387:29757:20:19:95:517:256:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:need to consider the grand constrained optimization, but the insights that it yields will make the
12:388:29855:19:19:95:212:237:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:problem more manageable.
12:389:29879:19:19:110:518:218:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Consider then the problem of the planner deciding on the number of seatsSthat should be

13:409:30664:25:25:95:434:517:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Solving thisfirst order condition allows us to establish the following result13:
13:410:30744:25:29:95:425:492:100:g_d0_f29:100:g_d0_f11:Proposition 1:The optimal seat-vote curveSo:[V,V]→[0,1]is given by

13:412:30849:29:20:110:517:434:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Recalling our discussion in section 2, Proposition 1 tells us that the optimal seat-vote curve
13:413:30943:20:19:95:518:414:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:is linear, with bias (πD−πR)(1/2−τ) and responsiveness 2τ. This curve is illustrated in Figure
13:414:31037:19:19:95:517:395:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:1. The horizontal axis measures the aggregate Democratic vote and the vertical the Democrats’
13:415:31130:19:19:95:518:376:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:share of seats. Sinceτ<1/2, the slope of the optimal seat-vote curve is less than 1 meaning
13:416:31221:19:19:95:517:357:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:that the fraction of Democrat seats increases at a constant but less than proportional rate as the
13:417:31319:19:19:95:518:338:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:aggregate Democrat vote increases. Theseat-vote curve intersects the 45oline when the aggregate
13:418:31414:19:19:95:518:319:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:vote isπD+πI/2.Thus, when exactly half the Independents lean Democrat, the optimal share
13:419:31502:19:19:95:517:300:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:of Democratic seats isπD+πI/2. Notice also thatSo(V)>0andSo(V)<1 so that, under this
13:420:31586:19:20:95:326:281:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:optimal system, there are safe seats for both Parties.
13:421:31640:20:19:110:522:261:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:To understand why the optimal responsiveness is 2τ,notefirstthatthewelfaremaximizing
13:422:31724:19:19:95:517:242:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Democratic seat share must be such that the social gains from increasing it marginally just equal
13:423:31821:19:19:95:518:223:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the social losses. With the quadratic preferences, this condition implies that the Democratic seat
13:424:31919:19:19:95:517:204:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:share must be such as to make the ideology of the average legislator equal the average ideology
13:425:32014:19:19:95:517:185:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:in the population. Thus, when the mean (which equals the median) Independent has ideology
13:426:32103:19:19:95:518:166:100:g_d0_f12:100:g_d0_f4:m, the optimal Democrat seat share should beπD+πI(1−m) because this would make the
13:427:32185:19:19:95:523:147:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:average ideology in the legislature equal to the population average - which isπR+πIm.When
13:428:32274:19:20:95:518:128:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the aggregate Democrat vote share increases marginally, the change in the mean Independent’s

13:430:32454:19:0:103:416:89:36:g_d0_f8:65:g_d0_f9:13The proofs of this and all subsequent propositions can be found in the Appendix.
14:431:32538:0:19:95:518:663:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:2τ. Recall thatτmeasures the diversity of views among Independents, so that responsiveness is
14:432:32631:19:20:95:518:644:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:positive correlated with this diversity. This is because the greater the diversity of Independent
14:433:32728:20:19:95:517:624:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:views, the greater the change in mean Independent ideology signalled by any given increase in
14:434:32821:19:19:95:142:605:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:vote share.
14:435:32832:19:19:110:517:586:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:To understand why the optimal seat-vote curve is biased, consider the case when the Democrats
14:436:32925:19:19:95:518:567:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:get exactly half the aggregate vote (V=1/2). If the optimal seat-vote curve were unbiased then
14:437:33019:19:19:95:518:548:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the Democrats should get half the seats (So(1/2) = 1/2). This would indeed be optimal if the
14:438:33111:19:19:95:517:529:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:average ideology in the population were 1/2. However, while themedianvoter in the population
14:439:33203:19:19:95:518:510:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:must have ideology 1/2inthiscase,theaveragevoter’s ideology will only equal 1/2 when the
14:440:33291:19:20:95:518:491:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:fractions of Democrats and Republicans are equal. To see this, note from (5) that whenV=1/2,
14:441:33383:20:19:95:518:471:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the median Independent’s ideology must bem(1/2) = 1/2+τ(πD−πR)/πIwhich implies that
14:442:33466:19:19:95:518:452:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the average ideology in the population is 1/2+(πR−πD)(1/2−τ). Thus, to make the average
14:443:33553:19:19:95:517:433:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:legislator’s ideology equal to the population average it will be necessary to have the Democratic
14:444:33650:19:19:95:518:414:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:seat share greater than 1/2ifπDis greater thanπR. Fundamentally, then, the bias in the optimal
14:445:33744:19:19:95:517:395:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:seat-vote curve stems from the fact that the ideology of the median voter will typically differ from
14:446:33844:19:19:95:517:376:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:that of the average voter. This in turn reflects the fact that partisans feel more intensely about
14:447:33942:19:19:95:232:357:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:ideology than do Independents.
14:448:33972:19:20:110:517:338:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Having understood the nature of the optimal seat-vote curve, we must tackle the question of
14:449:34063:20:19:95:518:318:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:implementability; that is, whether there exist districtings which generate an optimal relationship
14:450:34161:19:19:95:517:299:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:between seats and votes. Such a districting would make the composition of the legislature such that
14:451:34260:19:19:95:517:280:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:average legislator ideology always equals the population average. Clearly, this cannot be achieved
14:452:34358:19:19:95:517:261:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:by making each district a microcosm of the community as a whole, because then all districts
14:453:34449:19:19:95:517:242:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:would vote in the same way and the legislature would be either all Democrat or all Republican.
14:454:34543:19:19:95:517:223:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:However, with appropriate district level heterogeneity, implementability seems possible. While
14:455:34637:19:20:95:517:204:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the conditions that might guarantee it are by no means obvious, it is apparent that the fraction
14:456:34733:20:19:95:517:184:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:of Independents must matter.  For, if there were no Independents, then the optimal seat-vote
14:457:34825:19:19:95:517:165:100:g_d0_f4:49:g_d0_f15:curve would be a single point and could be implemented, for example, by creating a fractionπR
14:458:34918:19:19:95:518:146:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:districts majority Republican and a fractionπDdistricts majority Democrat. On the other hand,
14:459:35011:19:19:95:518:127:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:if the entire population were Independents, then all districts would necessarily be identical and
14:460:35108:19:19:95:352:108:100:g_d0_f4:49:g_d0_f7:the optimal seat-vote curve is clearly not implementable.14
14:461:35167:19:0:103:518:89:36:g_d0_f8:65:g_d0_f9:14In this case, the optimal seat-vote curve isSo(V)=1/2+2τ(V−1/2), while the equilibrium seat-vote curve
15:462:35273:0:19:110:517:663:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:This discussion leaves us with two general questions:first, what are the conditions under which
15:463:35368:19:20:95:517:644:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the optimal seat-vote curve is implementable? Second, when it is not implementable, what does
15:464:35461:20:19:95:517:624:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the “constrained” optimal seat-vote curve look like? The remainder of the paper is devoted to
15:465:35554:19:33:95:210:605:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:answering these questions.
15:466:35580:33:29:95:500:572:209:g_d0_f3:209:g_d0_f3:5  Determining when a seat-vote curve is implementable
15:467:35634:29:19:95:517:543:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:In this section, we outline a method for determining whether a particular seat-vote curve is
15:468:35726:19:19:95:517:524:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:implementable. This method will not only allow us to understand when the optimal seat-vote
15:469:35816:19:19:95:517:505:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:curve is implementable, but also how to specify the constraints for the problem of choosing the
15:470:35911:19:19:95:261:486:100:g_d0_f4:49:g_d0_f7:constrained optimal seat-vote curve.15
15:471:35949:19:19:110:518:467:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:In developing this method, it is more convenient to work with inverse seat-vote curves rather
15:472:36042:19:19:95:517:448:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f12:than seat-vote curves.  Aninverse seat-vote curveis described by a triple{i,i, V∗(·)}wherei
15:473:36133:19:20:95:518:429:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:andiare scalars satisfying 0≤i≤i≤1andV∗(·) is a non-decreasing function defined on [i,i]
15:474:36221:20:19:95:518:409:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:with range [V,V]. The interpretation is thatiis the fraction of districts that are safe Democrat;
15:475:36318:19:19:95:518:390:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:1−ithe fraction that are safe Republican; andV∗(i) is the critical aggregate vote threshold for
15:476:36413:19:19:95:518:371:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:competitive districti∈[i,i]. Given a seat vote curveS(V) we form its inverse in the following
15:477:36506:19:19:95:518:352:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:way:iis justS(V);iisS(V)andforalli∈[i,i],V∗(i) is such thatS(V)=i. In the event
15:478:36585:19:19:95:518:333:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:thatS(V)isflat over some part of its range, we letV∗(i)bethesmallestvalueofVsuch that
15:479:36670:19:19:95:518:314:100:g_d0_f12:100:g_d0_f4:S(V)=iand, in the case in whichS(V) is discontinuous and there does not exist aVsuch that
15:480:36759:19:19:95:518:295:100:g_d0_f12:100:g_d0_f4:S(V)=i,weletV∗(i) be the smallest value ofVsuch thatS(V)≥i. The relationship between
15:481:36843:19:20:95:347:276:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:a seat-vote curve and its inverse is illustrated in Figure 2.
15:482:36904:20:19:110:518:256:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:We will need the following definitions. Adistrictingis a description of the fractions of voter
15:483:36998:19:19:95:518:237:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:types in each district{(πD(i),πI(i)) :i∈[0,1]}.Itmustbethecasethatforalli,(πD(i),πI(i))
15:484:37085:19:19:95:518:218:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:belongs to the two dimensional unit simplex∆2+.  This ensures thatπD(i)andπI(i) are non-
15:485:37173:19:19:95:518:199:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:negative and satisfy the constraint thatπD(i)+πI(i)≤1. The latter guarantees that the associated
15:486:37269:19:19:95:518:180:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:fraction of Republicans in the districtπR(i)=1−πD(i)−πI(i) is non-negative. A districting

16:509:38775:19:19:110:520:433:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:We begin by describing the districtings that can generate the inverse seat-vote curve{i,i, V∗(·)}.

17:580:41146:19:19:95:517:281:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:we use. LetG∗(i,i, V∗(·)) denote the subset of generating districtings that satisfy the feasibility

18:620:43061:19:20:95:523:253:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:we proceed as follows. First, wefind the associated inverse seat-vote curve{io,io,V∗o(·)}.Next,

19:640:43522:0:19:110:518:663:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Thus, we need that there be “enough” Republicans and Democrats relative to Independents.
19:641:43610:19:20:95:517:644:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:This makes good intuitive sense given the discussion of implementability in Section 4.  There
19:642:43703:20:15:95:518:624:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:are several points to note about the coefficient multiplying the fraction of Independents (i.e.,

19:646:43816:7:16:203:518:602:49:g_d0_f22:100:g_d0_f20:τ)).  First, for allτ,itsvalueofthecoefficient converges to zero asε
19:647:43884:16:19:95:517:586:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:converges to zero. This means that the optimal seat-vote curve is necessarily implementable when
19:648:43980:19:19:95:517:567:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the degree of uncertainty in the identity of the median Independent is sufficiently small. Second,
19:649:44078:19:19:95:518:548:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:for givenε,thecoefficient is decreasing inτand hence the optimal seat-vote curve is more likely
19:650:44173:19:19:95:517:529:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:to be implementable when there is more diversity in the ideologies of Independents. Third, and
19:651:44267:19:19:95:518:510:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:most importantly, for any values ofεandτsatisfying our assumptions, the coefficient is less than
19:652:44363:19:20:95:518:491:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:1/2 and hence we have the following useful sufficient condition for the optimal seat-vote curve to
19:653:44461:20:24:95:175:471:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:be implementable.

20:702:46077:19:19:95:518:548:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:districts all elect a Democrat candidate when the majority of Independents prefer the Democrats;

20:705:46365:19:20:95:517:491:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:smoothly as the aggregate Democrat vote share increases fromVtoπD+πI2. The Republican-

20:710:46779:19:19:110:517:395:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:In general, not much of interest can be said about the allocation of voters in the safe seats.

20:713:47065:19:20:95:517:338:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:seat-vote curve.  Accordingly, the allocation of voters in the safe seats is tied down uniquely.
20:714:47161:20:19:95:517:318:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:It will be helpful in understanding constrained optimal seat-vote curves to see what this looks
20:715:47256:19:19:95:518:299:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:like. Consider the case in which condition (20) holds with equality, so that there are just enough

20:718:47529:19:19:95:517:242:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:and the safe Republican districts by Republicans and Independents. The fraction of Democrats in
20:719:47624:19:19:95:518:223:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the safe Democrat districts is no more than necessary to ensure that the fraction of Democrats and
20:720:47722:19:20:95:518:204:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Democrat-favoring Independents always exceeds the fraction of Republican-favoring Independents.
20:721:47817:20:19:95:517:184:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Assuming that condition (21) holds as an inequality, the fraction of Republicans in the safe

21:728:48215:0:19:95:517:663:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:districts have no voters of one type. It is reasonable to object that such districts are unlikely
21:729:48312:19:20:95:518:644:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:to be practically feasible when account is takenof geographic constraints.  However, it is im-
21:730:48406:20:19:95:517:624:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:portant to note that the optimal seat-vote curve can typically be implemented with much more
21:731:48498:19:19:95:518:605:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:“straightforward” districtings. To illustrate, consider the class of districtings in which the fraction
21:732:48601:19:19:95:517:586:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:of Independents is constant across districts. In this class, all that varies across districts is the
21:733:48701:19:25:95:429:567:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:fraction of Democrats and Republicans.Then,wehavethefollowingresult:

21:779:50147:19:19:95:518:123:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:to Republicans varying from [1−πI(τ−ετ)]/[1−πI(τ+ετ)] to 1. The Republican-leaning districts
21:780:50239:19:19:95:518:104:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:have a greater fraction of Republicans, with the ratio of Democrats to Republicans varying from

22:784:50502:19:20:95:518:615:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:interesting situations in which it might not be. For example, according to Erikson, Wright and
22:785:50596:20:19:95:518:595:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:McGuiver (1993), the sufficient conditions of the Corollary are not satisfied in four New England
22:786:50693:19:19:95:518:576:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:States, where many voters are not affiliated with either political party. In two states (MA and
22:787:50788:19:19:95:518:557:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:RI) there are enough Democrats (πI≤2πD) but too few Republicans (πI>2πR), while these
22:788:50873:19:19:95:517:538:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:conditions are reversed in two others (NH and VT). In such cases, what does the constrained

22:799:51494:23:20:95:517:346:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:The constrained optimal seat-vote curve is the seat-vote curve corresponding to the solution of
22:800:51589:20:19:95:153:326:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:this problem.
22:801:51602:19:19:110:518:307:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:When (20) and (21) are satisfied, Proposition 2 implies that the optimal inverse seat-vote

22:803:51788:19:19:95:518:269:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:case, there are three possibilities. First, only (21) is satisfied and there arenot enough Democrats.
22:804:51889:19:19:95:518:250:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Second, only (20) is satisfied and there arenot enough Republicans. Finally, neither inequality is

22:806:52080:19:28:95:117:212:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:turn.

22:808:52110:25:24:95:343:159:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:In this case, we are able to establish the following result:
22:809:52170:24:19:95:518:135:100:g_d0_f29:100:g_d0_f11:Proposition 4:Suppose that there are not enough Democrats and letS∗(V)denote the con-

23:815:52633:20:19:95:518:624:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:interval[V,eV); (ii)S∗(V)is constant on the interval[eV,πD+πI2); and (iii)S∗(V)=So(V)on
23:816:52720:19:22:95:206:605:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:the interval[πD+πI2,V].
23:817:52743:22:15:110:518:583:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:The result is illustrated in Figure 4. Panel (a) illustrates the case in whichπDis less than

23:821:52900:7:16:412:517:561:49:g_d0_f7:100:g_d0_f4:2τ(1−τ−2ε).  In the
23:822:52919:16:19:95:522:545:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:former case, the constrained optimal seat-vote curve is constant on the interval [V,πD+πI2)and
23:823:53013:19:19:95:518:526:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:then jumps up discontinuously to equal the optimal seat-vote curve on the interval [πD+πI2,V].
23:824:53107:19:19:95:517:507:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:The logic of the constrained optimum is to allocate the available Democrats to make as many
23:825:53198:19:20:95:518:488:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:safe Democrat districts as possible.  In the case illustrated in panel (b) the seat-vote curve is
23:826:53295:20:19:95:518:468:100:g_d0_f5:100:g_d0_f4:first increasing and at an increasing rate. However, at some aggregate vote level betweenVand
23:827:53388:19:19:95:517:449:100:g_d0_f20:100:g_d0_f4:πD+πI2the curve becomesflat. It then jumps up discontinuously to equal the optimal seat-vote
23:828:53480:19:19:95:518:430:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:curve on the interval [πD+πI2,V]. It can be shown that asπDgets larger (holding constantπI)
23:829:53571:19:19:95:521:411:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the point at which the curveflattens (eV)movestotherightand,forsufficiently largeπD,equals
23:830:53661:19:19:95:260:392:100:g_d0_f20:100:g_d0_f4:πD+πI2and theflat spot disappears.
23:831:53695:19:19:110:517:373:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:In either case, the constrained optimal seat-vote curve lies below the optimal seat-vote curve
23:832:53789:19:19:95:518:354:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:on the interval [V,πD+πI2) and equals it thereafter.  What this tells us is when the median
23:833:53880:19:20:95:518:335:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Independent favors the Republicans, it is not possible to elect enough Democrats to make the
23:834:53972:20:19:95:517:315:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:average ideology of the legislature equal to the population average. However, when the median
23:835:54065:19:19:95:517:296:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Independent favors the Democrats there is no longer a problem, because Democrats can be elected
23:836:54160:19:19:95:517:277:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:from districts that are populated solely by Independents. In case (a) the shortage of Democrats
23:837:54255:19:19:95:517:258:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:is dealt with by creating as many safe Democrat seats as possible. This means that the seat-vote
23:838:54351:19:19:95:518:239:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:curve is non-responsive on the interval [V,πD+πI2), implying that the divergence between average
23:839:54447:19:19:95:518:220:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:population and legislator ideology is increasing. In case (b) the seat-vote curve isfirst increasingly
23:840:54549:19:19:95:518:201:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:responsive, and then becomes unresponsive. Thisimplies that the divergence between the average
23:841:54643:19:20:95:518:182:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:population and legislator ideology displays a more complex pattern,first increasing and then
23:842:54735:20:19:95:517:162:100:g_d0_f4:49:g_d0_f15:decreasing. This counter-intuitive pattern stems from an inherent non-convexity in ProblemPcon
23:843:54829:19:19:95:297:143:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:that is discussed in the proof of Proposition 4.

24:902:56868:19:19:95:518:142:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:groups of districts. One group (i∈[i,i∗)) contains both Democrats and Independents. This group
24:903:56962:19:19:95:518:123:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:have differing critical vote thresholds, with the fraction of Independents increasing fromτ/(τ+ε)
24:904:57059:19:19:95:518:104:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:toπI/2(πI+πD−φ(i∗)). Accordingly, the fraction of these districts electing a Democrat candidate
24:905:57154:19:0:95:518:85:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:varies smoothly with the aggregate Democrat vote. However, in contrast to the case where the
25:906:57248:0:19:95:518:663:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:optimal seat-vote curve is implementable, the critical vote threshold (which isφ(i)) increases at a
25:907:57347:19:20:95:518:644:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:decreasing rate inias opposed to a linear rate. This generates a strictly convex seat-vote curve.
25:908:57444:20:19:95:518:624:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:The other group of districts (i∈[i∗,πD+πI2)) are populated solely by Independents as in the

25:913:57750:25:19:95:517:514:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:The properties of the constrained optimal seat-vote curve when there are not enough Republicans,
25:914:57846:19:19:95:518:495:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:can be deduced from Proposition 4.  As noted in the proof of Proposition 2, one can redefine
25:915:57938:19:20:95:517:476:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the seat-vote curve as representing the relationship between the fraction of seats held by the
25:916:58032:20:19:95:518:456:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Republican Party and its share of the aggregate vote. Such aRepublican seat-vote curveis denoted
25:917:58128:19:19:95:518:437:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:bySR(VR), whereSRis the fraction of seats held by Republicans andVRis the fraction of votes
25:918:58219:19:19:95:517:418:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:they received.  One can then apply Proposition 4 to deduce the properties of the constrained

25:920:58404:19:19:95:518:380:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:can use the fact thatS∗(V)=1−S∗R(1−V)tofind the properties of the constrained optimal
25:921:58489:19:25:95:437:361:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Democrat seat-vote curve. In this way, the following result can be established:
25:922:58568:25:19:95:518:336:100:g_d0_f29:100:g_d0_f11:Proposition 5:Suppose that there are not enough Republicans and letS∗(V)denote the con-
25:923:58655:19:19:95:518:317:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:strained optimal seat-vote curve. (a) IfπR≤πIε2τ(1−τ−2ε),thenS∗(V)=So(V)on the interval

25:925:58816:19:19:95:518:279:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:there existsbV∈(πD+πI2,V)such that: (i)S∗(V)=So(V)on the interval[V,πD+πI2];(ii)
25:926:58896:19:19:95:518:260:100:g_d0_f12:100:g_d0_f11:S∗(V)is constant on the interval(πD+πI2,bV];and (iii)S∗(V)is increasing and strictly concave
25:927:58988:19:22:95:193:241:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f11:on the interval(bV,V].
25:928:59010:22:15:110:518:219:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:This result is illustrated in Figure 5. Panel (a) illustrates the case in whichπRis less than

25:932:59168:8:15:390:518:196:49:g_d0_f7:100:g_d0_f4:2τ(1−τ−2ε). In the former
25:933:59193:15:20:95:518:181:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:case, the constrained optimal seat-vote curve equals the optimal one on the interval [V,πD+πI2]
25:934:59288:20:19:95:517:161:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:and then jumps up discontinuously andflattens out on the interval (πD+πI2,V].  Again, the
25:935:59377:19:19:95:517:142:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:logic of the constrained optimum is to allocate the available Republicans to make as many safe
25:936:59471:19:19:95:517:123:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Republican districts as possible. In the latter case, the seat-vote curve equals the optimal one on
25:937:59570:19:19:95:518:104:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the interval [V,πD+πI2], jumps up atπD+πI2and stays constant untilbV. It then starts increasing
25:938:59665:19:0:95:518:85:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:at a decreasing rate on the interval [bV,V]. AsπRgets larger,bVmoves to the left and eventually
26:939:59762:0:28:95:165:663:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:equalsπD+πI2.

26:941:59815:26:19:95:517:609:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:The optimal districting when there are not enough Democrats allocates all the available De-
26:942:59906:19:19:95:518:590:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:mocrats in the districts [0,πD+πI2).  Similarly, when there are not enough Republicans, the
26:943:59997:19:19:95:517:571:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:available Republicans are allocated to the districts (πD+πI2,1].  Accordingly, when there are
26:944:60090:19:19:95:517:552:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:neither enough Democrats or Republicans the optimal districting is just an amalgam of the two
26:945:60183:19:19:95:518:533:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:cases: the Democrats are allocated optimally over the districts [0,πD+πI2) and the Republicans
26:946:60277:19:20:95:518:514:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:over the districts (πD+πI2,1]. The corresponding constrained optimal seat-vote curve therefore
26:947:60371:20:19:95:384:494:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:just pieces together the two distorted ends of the seat-vote curves.
26:948:60439:19:19:110:518:475:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:This is illustrated in Figure 6.  Panel (a) depicts the case in which bothπDandπRare
26:949:60523:19:15:95:518:456:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:smaller thanπIε2τ(1−τ−2ε) and in panel (b) the case in which bothπDandπRare greater than

26:951:60614:7:0:99:499:434:49:g_d0_f7:100:g_d0_f4:2τ(1−τ−2ε). In the former case, the constrained optimal seat-vote curve isflat on [V,πD+

26:953:60704:7:16:504:518:434:49:g_d0_f7:100:g_d0_f4:2),
26:954:60707:16:19:95:518:418:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:jumps up discontinuously atπD+πI2and then is constant on the interval (πD+πI2,V]. In the
26:955:60795:19:19:95:518:399:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:latter case, the seat-vote curve isfirst increasing and at an increasing rate. However, at aggregate

26:957:60986:19:20:95:521:361:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:untilbV. It then starts increasing at a decreasing rate on the interval [bV,V].Inthecaseinwhich

26:959:61136:27:26:95:216:314:145:g_d0_f3:145:g_d0_f3:7.4  General lessons
26:960:61156:26:19:95:518:288:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:There are three general lessons we can draw concerning the properties of constrained optimal seat-
26:961:61254:19:19:95:518:269:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:vote curves. Thefirst is that they always have safe seats. When either Democrats or Republicans
26:962:61349:19:19:95:517:250:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:are in short supply, at least some fraction of them are optimally concentrated together to make
26:963:61444:19:20:95:203:231:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:safe seats for their party.
26:964:61471:20:19:110:518:211:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:The second lesson is that when there is a shortage of one group of partisans, the constrained
26:965:61564:19:19:95:517:192:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:optimal seat-vote curve is biased toward the party with the largest partisan base, but when there
26:966:61661:19:19:95:517:173:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:is a shortage of both groups this is not uniformly the case. Considerfirst the case in which there
26:967:61759:19:19:95:518:154:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:is a shortage of one group - say, Republicans. The constrained optimal seat-vote curve is biased
26:968:61855:19:19:95:518:135:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:in favor of the Democrats if for allVwe have thatS∗(V)>1−S∗(1−V).22The optimal
26:969:61933:19:20:95:518:116:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:seat-vote curve is biased in favor of the Democrats in this case, so thatSo(V)>1−So(1−V).
26:970:62022:20:0:103:443:96:36:g_d0_f8:65:g_d0_f9:22To be more precise, the inequality must hold for allV∈[V,V]suchthat1−V∈[V,V].
27:971:62103:0:19:95:517:663:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Moreover, from Figure 5, the constrained optimal seat-vote curve lies on or above the optimal
27:972:62196:19:20:95:517:644:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:seat-vote curve in this case, so thatS∗(V)≥So(V)andS∗(1−V)≥So(1−V). Combining these
27:973:62279:20:19:95:220:624:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:inequalities yields the result.
27:974:62310:19:19:110:518:605:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:By contrast, consider a case in which there are too few Republicans and Democrats. Assume
27:975:62399:19:19:95:518:586:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:that bothπDandπRare smaller thanπIε2τ(1−τ−2ε) so that we have the situation illustrated
27:976:62486:19:19:95:518:567:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:in Figure 6(a) and suppose thatπDis larger thanπR. Consider the situation in which exactly
27:977:62576:19:19:95:518:548:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:one half the population vote for the Democrats so thatV=1/2.  Then, sinceπDis larger
27:978:62660:19:19:95:518:529:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:thanπR, it must be the case that 1/2<πD+πI/2, implying that the Democrats’ seat share is
27:979:62748:19:19:95:521:510:100:g_d0_f12:100:g_d0_f4:S∗(1/2) =πD(τ+ε)/ε(see Figure 6(a)). In order forS∗(1/2)>1−S∗(1/2),itmustbethecase
27:980:62830:19:20:95:518:491:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:thatS∗(1/2) exceeds 1/2. But this will not be the case wheneverπD<2ε/(τ+ε). The difficulty
27:981:62920:20:19:95:522:471:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:that arises here is that becauseπDis larger thanπR,itmustbethecasethatthemajorityof
27:982:63003:19:19:95:518:452:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Independents favor the Republicans whenV=1/2.  Thus all the Independent districts elect
27:983:63090:19:19:95:517:433:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:a Republican giving the Republicans an advantage in this case. It should be stressed that this
27:984:63184:19:19:95:518:414:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:anomaly does not arise for allVbecause wheneverVis sufficiently small so that 1−V>πD+πI/2
27:985:63273:19:19:95:518:395:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the condition thatS∗(V)>1−S∗(1−V) will be satisfied. But the existence of the anomaly
27:986:63358:19:19:95:517:376:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:means that the constrained optimal seat-vote curve is not necessarily uniformly biased toward the
27:987:63455:19:19:95:148:357:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:larger party.
27:988:63468:19:20:110:518:338:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Thefinal lesson is that the responsiveness of the constrained optimal seat-vote curve can be
27:989:63560:20:19:95:518:318:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:anywhere from zero to infinity. Moreover, as is clear from Figures 4-6, responsiveness can vary

27:991:63747:19:19:95:518:280:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:optimal degree of responsiveness makes sense forthe optimal seat-vote curve, it does not for the
27:992:63843:19:32:95:253:261:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:constrained optimal seat-vote curve.
27:993:63879:32:29:95:316:229:209:g_d0_f3:209:g_d0_f3:8  The role of the assumptions
27:994:63909:29:19:95:518:200:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:In analyzing socially optimal districting in our model, we have worked with quite specific assump-
27:995:64007:19:20:95:518:181:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:tions on citizens’ political preferences. Specifically, we have assumed that citizens have quadratic
27:996:64107:20:19:95:518:161:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:loss functions and that the distribution of Independents’ ideologies is uniform across its support.
27:997:64206:19:19:95:518:142:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:To highlight the role these play in the analysis, this section briefly discusses the implications of
27:998:64306:19:19:95:271:123:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:working with more general assumptions.
27:999:64344:19:19:110:518:104:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:With respect to the distribution of Independents’ ideologies, the basic model can be generalized
27:1000:64440:19:0:95:522:85:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:by assuming that the fraction of Independents with ideologies less thanx∈[m−τ,m+τ]is
28:1001:64526:0:20:95:518:663:100:g_d0_f12:100:g_d0_f4:H(x−(m−τ)2τ)whereH:[0,1]→[0,1] is a continuously differentiable, increasing distribution
28:1002:64614:20:19:95:518:643:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:function with a densityhthat is symmetric around 1/2. This allows us to capture the possibility,
28:1003:64710:19:19:95:517:624:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:say, that there are more Independents with ideologies closer to the median than in the tails of the
28:1004:64809:19:19:95:518:605:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:support. With respect to citizens’ loss functions, the model can be generalized by assuming that
28:1005:64905:19:19:95:518:586:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:if the average ideology of the elected representatives isα0, a citizen with ideologyαexperiences a

28:1007:65089:19:19:95:518:548:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:differentiable and satisfiesv0(0) = 0. This allows us to vary the degree of convexity in citizens’
28:1008:65187:19:19:95:156:529:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:loss functions.
28:1009:65202:19:20:110:518:510:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:It is important to note that these generalizations make little difference to the positive aspects
28:1010:65299:20:19:95:518:490:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:of the analysis. The derivation of the equilibrium seat-vote curve is basically the same and, in par-
28:1011:65400:19:19:95:518:471:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:ticular, the critical aggregate vote threshold for districtiis still given by (7).23Consequently, the
28:1012:65501:19:19:95:518:452:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:method for determining the implementability of a seat-vote curve outlined in Section 5 generalizes
28:1013:65599:19:19:95:291:433:100:g_d0_f4:49:g_d0_f7:straightforwardly under these assumptions.24
28:1014:65643:19:19:110:517:414:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Where the generalizations have implications is for the normative analysis; in particular, the
28:1015:65736:19:19:95:518:395:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:form of the optimal seat-vote curve. Considerfirst the implications of generalizing the distribution
28:1016:65836:19:19:95:518:376:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:of Independents’ ideologies. Maintaining the assumption of quadratic loss functions, the optimal
28:1017:65932:19:30:95:263:357:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:seat-vote curve can now be written as:
28:1018:65970:30:0:147:360:327:100:g_d0_f12:100:g_d0_f4:So(V)=1/2+(πD−πR)(1/2−τ)+2τ(πIH−1(
28:1019:66004:0:13:361:394:334:100:g_d0_f12:49:g_d0_f15:V−πD
28:1020:66008:13:23:373:518:321:100:g_d0_f20:100:g_d0_f4:πI)−(1/2−πD)).(30)
28:1021:66026:23:19:95:517:298:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:This seat-vote curve remains biased in favor of the party with the largest partisan base and its
28:1022:66122:19:19:95:517:279:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:responsiveness continues to depend upon the degree of preference variation among the Indepen-
28:1023:66215:19:19:95:517:260:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:dents, as measured by 2τ. However, the responsiveness is 2τ/h(1/2−(m(V)−τ)2τ) and thus depends
28:1024:66309:19:19:95:517:241:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:upon the density of Independents’ ideologies. Intuitively, this is because the size of this density
28:1025:66408:19:19:95:517:222:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:determines the change in the mean Independent’s ideology that is signalled by a marginal increase
28:1026:66505:19:19:95:517:203:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:in the Democrats’ vote share. The implication of this is that the optimal seat-vote curve is no
28:1027:66600:19:20:95:518:184:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:longer linear. In particular, under the assumption that the densityhis increasing on [0,1/2], the
28:1028:66697:20:19:95:518:164:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:optimal seat-vote curve will be strictly concave on [V,πD+πI2) and strictly convex on (πD+πI2,V].
28:1029:66794:19:15:103:518:145:36:g_d0_f8:65:g_d0_f9:23If the median independent has ideologym, the fraction of voters in districtivoting for the Democrat is
28:1030:66898:15:13:95:521:130:65:g_d0_f17:65:g_d0_f9:V(i;m)=πD(i)+πI(i)H(1/2−(m−τ)2τ) and the average fraction of voters voting for the Democrat Party isV(m)=
28:1031:67003:13:11:95:517:117:65:g_d0_f23:65:g_d0_f9:πD+πIH(1/2−(m−τ)2τ). Accordingly,m(V)=1/2+τ−2τH−1(V−πDπI)andV(i;m(V)) =πD(i)+πI(i)[V−πDπI]
28:1032:67093:11:13:95:238:106:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:which is just (6). Hence (7) still holds.
28:1033:67134:13:0:103:518:93:36:g_d0_f8:65:g_d0_f9:24The only difference is that equations (13) and (14) becomeπD+πIH(τ−ε2τ)≥1/2andπD+πIH(τ+ε2τ)≤1/2.
29:1034:67234:0:19:110:517:663:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:With the more general loss function, it is no longer possible to obtain a closed form solution
29:1035:67328:19:20:95:518:644:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:for the optimal seat-vote curve. Rather, it is defined implicitly by thefirst order condition that
29:1036:67426:20:19:95:517:624:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the social marginal benefit from having more Democrat seats just equals the social marginal cost.
29:1037:67523:19:29:95:433:605:100:g_d0_f4:49:g_d0_f7:Maintaining the uniform distribution assumption, this condition is given by25

29:1051:67779:19:19:95:517:528:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:of the optimal seat-vote curve. It is straightforward to show that whenV=1/2, the optimal

29:1053:67958:19:19:95:518:490:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:so that the optimal seat-vote curve remains biased towards the party with the largest partisan

29:1068:68520:19:20:110:518:337:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:It should now be clear that the role of our assumptions concerning citizens’ preferences and the
29:1069:68616:20:19:95:518:317:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:distribution of Independents’ ideologies is to ensure that the optimal seat-vote curve has a simple
29:1070:68715:19:19:95:518:298:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:tractable form. This allows us to easily compute the values of the minimization and maximization

29:1073:68998:19:19:95:518:241:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:over, these assumptions permit the characterization of the optimal constrained seat-vote curve
29:1074:69092:19:19:95:518:222:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:by ensuring that the social welfare functionEW({i,i, V∗(·)}) has a relatively tractable form.
29:1075:69185:19:19:95:518:203:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:In this sense, our assumptions are key.  Nonetheless, they are not misleading because, as just
29:1076:69279:19:20:95:517:184:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:demonstrated, the determinants of partisan bias and responsiveness in the basic model remain in
29:1077:69374:20:19:95:517:164:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:more general models. Thus, the nature of socially optimal districting in more general models is
29:1078:69469:19:19:95:517:145:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:not going to be fundamentally different - it is just that additional considerations will come into
29:1079:69567:19:19:95:517:126:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:play. Obviously, understanding precisely how such considerations impact both the conditions for

30:1084:69897:29:19:95:517:601:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:This paper has developed a welfare economic analysis of the problem of districting. In the con-
30:1085:69992:19:19:95:517:582:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:text of a simple micro-founded model intended to capture salient features of U.S. politics, it has
30:1086:70090:19:19:95:518:563:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:studied how a social planner should allocate citizens of different ideologies across districts to max-
30:1087:70192:19:19:95:517:544:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:imize aggregate utility. Ideally, the social planner would like the Democratic seat share in the
30:1088:70288:19:19:95:517:525:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:legislature to be such that the social gains from marginally increasing it just equal the social
30:1089:70384:19:19:95:518:506:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:costs. Since changes in the parties’ aggregate vote share reflect changes in voters’ ideologies, the
30:1090:70484:19:20:95:517:487:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:optimal composition of the legislature will depend on the aggregate vote share. This yields the
30:1091:70579:20:19:95:517:467:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:key conceptual innovation of the paper - the optimal seat-vote curve. Under the assumptions of
30:1092:70673:19:19:95:517:448:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the model, the optimal seat-vote curve is of the same simple linear form estimated in the early
30:1093:70768:19:19:95:518:429:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:empirical literature. Its “responsiveness” depends on the magnitude of the change in average voter
30:1094:70866:19:19:95:517:410:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:ideology signalled by a change in vote share, which in turn depends on the degree of preference
30:1095:70961:19:19:95:518:391:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:variation among Independents. Its “bias” depends on the difference in the fractions of Democrats
30:1096:71057:19:19:95:518:372:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:and Republicans in the population; specifically, it is biased in favor of the party with the largest
30:1097:71157:19:19:95:155:353:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:partisan base.

30:1099:71270:20:19:95:517:314:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:optimal seat-vote curve, then the social planner can do no better than to choose such a districting.
30:1100:71370:19:19:95:518:295:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Thefirst analytical achievement of the paper is to show that there exist such districtings if (and
30:1101:71468:19:19:95:517:276:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:only if) the fraction of Independents in the population is not “too large” relative to either the
30:1102:71565:19:19:95:518:257:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:fraction of Democrats or Republicans. These conditions appear permissive and would be satisfied
30:1103:71660:19:19:95:517:238:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:in the vast majority of U.S. States. Moreover, while the analysis does not take into account the
30:1104:71756:19:19:95:518:219:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:geographical constraints faced by officials charged with redistricting in the real world, the optimal
30:1105:71857:19:19:95:517:200:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:seat-vote curve can typically be generated by districtings that look straightforward to achieve.
30:1106:71953:19:20:95:517:181:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:This nurtures the hope that the optimal seat-vote curve may be an attainable benchmark for
30:1107:72043:20:19:95:141:161:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:districters.
30:1108:72055:19:19:110:517:142:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:When the fraction of Independents in the population is large, the optimal seat-vote curve will
30:1109:72149:19:19:95:518:123:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:not be implementable even if the planner has theflexibility in allocating voter types that we have
30:1110:72247:19:19:95:518:104:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:assumed. The second analytical achievement of thepaper is to fully characterize the constrained
30:1111:72342:19:0:95:518:85:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:optimal seat-vote curve. In contrast to the situation when thefirst best is implementable, the
31:1112:72438:0:19:95:518:663:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:constrained optimal seat-vote curve is generated by a unique districting. These optimal districtings
31:1113:72538:19:20:95:518:644:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:involve a complex pattern of voter types, with some districts being all Independent and the
31:1114:72629:20:19:95:491:624:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:remainder containing only Independents andDemocrats or Independents and Republicans.
31:1115:72713:19:19:110:518:605:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:While the shape of the constrained optimal seat-vote curve differs from that of the optimal seat-
31:1116:72810:19:19:95:517:586:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:vote curve, they do share several general features,which can be interpreted as lessons for districting
31:1117:72912:19:19:95:517:567:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:practices. While many commentators consider uncompetitive districts to be undesirable from the
31:1118:73006:19:19:95:517:548:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:perspective of democracy, our welfare economic perspective provides general support for a mix of
31:1119:73102:19:19:95:518:529:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:competitive and safe seats. In addition, the analysis provides support for partisan bias as both the
31:1120:73202:19:19:95:517:510:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:optimal and constrained optimal seat-vote curves are typically biased in favor of the party with
31:1121:73298:19:20:95:517:491:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the largest voter base. Regarding the districtingsunderlying these seat-vote curves, our analysis
31:1122:73395:20:19:95:518:471:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:provides support for districts that are heterogeneous, rather than identical, in their compositions
31:1123:73494:19:19:95:518:452:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:of voter ideology. While the optimal and constrained optimal systems concur on these issues of the
31:1124:73592:19:19:95:518:433:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:number of safe seats, partisan bias, and cross-district heterogeneity, they differ on the appropriate
31:1125:73693:19:19:95:518:414:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:degree of responsiveness. In particular, while thefirst-best system has a constant responsiveness,
31:1126:73791:19:19:95:513:395:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the constrained optimal seat-vote curve exhibits responsiveness that varies from zero to infinity.
31:1127:73889:19:19:110:518:376:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:The model and techniques developed in this paper can be used to address other districting
31:1128:73978:19:19:95:518:357:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:questions.  One could study the classic questionof optimal partisan gerrymandering by char-
31:1129:74069:19:20:95:517:338:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:acterizing the implementable seat-vote curve that maximizes the expected utility of (say) the
31:1130:74162:20:19:95:517:318:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Democrats. This requires solving a problem similar to that studied in Section 7, except the objec-
31:1131:74260:19:19:95:517:299:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:tive function would be the expected welfare of the Democrats rather than the population at large.
31:1132:74357:19:19:95:517:280:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:This exercise might be useful for developing predictions concerning the districtings that a partisan
31:1133:74457:19:19:95:517:261:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:redistricting committee might choose. The model would also facilitate a precise understanding of
31:1134:74553:19:19:95:418:242:100:g_d0_f4:49:g_d0_f7:the determinants of the welfare loss associated with partisan districting.26
31:1135:74629:19:19:110:518:223:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:The model can also be used as a basis to empirically estimate and evaluate seat-vote curves.
31:1136:74721:19:20:95:517:204:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Coate and Knight (2005) use the model to developan empirical methodology for estimating
31:1137:74808:20:19:95:517:184:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:seat-vote curves for the U.S. States and measuring citizen welfare. This allows the comparison
31:1138:74902:19:19:95:518:165:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:of actual and optimal seat-vote curves and the estimation of the welfare loss associated with
31:1139:74995:19:19:95:518:146:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:observed districtings. Given our argument that it may be reasonably easy to achieve the optimal
31:1140:75090:19:19:95:517:127:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:relationship between seats and votes, we might hope this welfare loss to be small.  Following
31:1141:75183:19:13:103:518:108:36:g_d0_f8:65:g_d0_f9:26It would also be interesting to explore the determinants of the level of partisan bias under the optimal partisan
31:1142:75298:13:0:95:280:95:65:g_d0_f9:65:g_d0_f9:gerrymander as in Gilligan and Matsusaka [1999].
32:1143:75348:0:19:95:517:663:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:King (1989) and Gelman and King (1994), one could also investigate the correlation between
32:1144:75438:19:20:95:275:644:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:redistricting institutions and welfare loss.
32:1145:75482:20:19:110:517:624:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Finally, it will be clear to the reader that this paper is very much afirst cut at the problem
32:1146:75576:19:19:95:518:605:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:and there are numerous ways the model could usefully be extended. First, it would be interesting
32:1147:75672:19:19:95:517:586:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:to see how strategic voting of the sort discussed in the split-ticket voting literature (Alesina and
32:1148:75772:19:19:95:518:567:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Rosenthal (1995) and Fiorina (1992)) would impact the analysis.  Second, it would be highly
32:1149:75863:19:19:95:517:548:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:desirable to be able to incorporate geographic constraints in a meaningful way. Perhaps the most
32:1150:75959:19:19:95:517:529:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:fruitful approach would be to devise a way of studying the welfare consequences of local changes
32:1151:76055:19:19:95:517:510:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:in districting. Third, it would be useful to incorporate a governor or president into the model.
32:1152:76151:19:20:95:518:491:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Fourth, it would be interesting to make the model dynamic and incorporate incumbency.  In
32:1153:76240:20:19:95:518:471:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:reality, incumbents have a significant advantage (perhaps due to greater experience) and, it is
32:1154:76335:19:19:95:517:452:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:often argued that redistricting is done with an eye to preserving the seats of incumbents. Fifth,
32:1155:76432:19:19:95:517:433:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:it would be interesting to give parties a strategic role in terms of candidate selection, perhaps by
32:1156:76532:19:0:95:427:414:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:assuming that they can choose between moderate and extremist candidates.

36:1250:82189:22:20:95:125:622:100:g_d0_f29:100:g_d0_f29:Part I
36:1251:82195:20:19:110:520:602:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Let{i,i, V∗(·)}be an arbitrary inverse seat-vote curve satisfying the requirement thatV∗(·)is
36:1252:82288:19:19:95:518:583:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:piecewise continuously differentiable and consider the minimization problemPmin. To simplify the
36:1253:82384:19:19:95:517:564:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:problem, note that in any solution it is clearly optimal to have no more Democrats than necessary
36:1254:82481:19:28:95:349:545:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:in the safe Democrat seats. Thus, from (13), we have that

36:1262:82558:29:28:95:490:488:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Similarly, it is optimal to have no Democrats at all in the safe Republican seats and hence

36:1264:82658:28:19:95:518:432:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:It follows from (34) that we can rewrite (14) asπI≤ττ+ε.Similarly, (33) implies that the constraint

41:1622:89168:22:20:110:517:430:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:To understand the result, recall that the problem is to choose the districting that uses as few
41:1623:89263:20:19:95:518:410:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Democrats as possible from the set of districtings that both generate the inverse seat-vote curve
41:1624:89360:19:19:95:518:391:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:and satisfy the constraint that the fraction of Independents used equalsπI. Precisely what that
41:1625:89455:19:19:95:517:372:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:districting looks like will depend upon the actual fraction of Independents available. In case (i)
41:1626:89553:19:19:95:517:353:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:of the Lemma, there are a large fraction of Independents available, and it is optimal to set the
41:1627:89649:19:19:95:521:334:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:fractions of Independents in both the safeDemocrat and competitive districts (πIandπI(i)for
41:1628:89740:19:19:95:518:315:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:alli∈[i,i]) equal to their maximal level, with the remaining Independents allocated to the safe
41:1629:89835:19:19:95:517:296:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:Republican districts. The opposite extreme is case (iv), in which there are only a small fraction
41:1630:89932:19:20:95:518:277:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:of Independents available and it is only in Republican-leaning competitive districts (i∈[i∗∗,i])
41:1631:90028:20:19:95:518:257:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:that the fractions of Independents are set equal totheir maximal level. In all other districts, the
41:1632:90127:19:19:95:517:238:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:fraction of Independents equals its minimal level - which is 0. Cases (ii) and (iii) lie in between
41:1633:90226:19:19:95:162:219:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:these extremes.
41:1634:90241:19:19:110:518:200:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:The nature of the solution to the maximization problem can be deduced from the observation
41:1635:90331:19:19:95:518:181:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:that selecting the districting inG∗(i,i, V∗(·)) that has the maximal fraction of Democrats is
41:1636:90424:19:19:95:517:162:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:equivalent to choosing the districting that has the minimal fraction of Republicans.  One can
41:1637:90517:19:19:95:518:143:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:alternatively define the seat-vote curve as representing the relationship between the fraction of
41:1638:90614:19:20:95:517:124:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f11:seats held by the Republican Party and its share of the aggregate vote. Let such aRepublican
41:1639:90706:20:19:95:518:104:100:g_d0_f11:100:g_d0_f4:seat-vote curvebe denoted bySR(VR), whereSRis the fraction of seats held by Republicans
41:1640:90793:19:0:95:518:85:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:andVRis the fraction of votes they received.  We can analogously defineVRandVRto be
42:1641:90878:0:19:95:518:663:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:the minimal and maximal vote shares received by the Republican Party. Associated with this
42:1642:90968:19:20:95:518:644:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f25:Republican seat-vote curve, we can define an inverse Republican seat-vote curve{iR,iR,V∗R(·)}
42:1643:91061:20:19:95:518:624:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:and deduce the minimal fraction of Republicans - call itΩR- directly from Lemma A.1. The value
42:1644:91155:19:19:95:518:605:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:of the maximization problem will then be given byΩ=1−πI−ΩR. The only drawback with
42:1645:91237:19:19:95:518:586:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:this procedure is that the expressions for the valueΩwill be in terms of the inverse Republican

42:1647:91430:19:19:95:522:548:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:of the inverse (Democrat) seat-vote curve{i,i, V∗(·)},bynotingthatiR=1−i,iR=1−i,and
