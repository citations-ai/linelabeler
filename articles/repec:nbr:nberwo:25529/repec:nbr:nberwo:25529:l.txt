3:49:1997:21:15:99:512:486:99:g_d0_f2:99:g_d0_f2:F:We study the evolution of super star firms in the U.S. economy over the past 60 years. Contrary to
3:50:2095:15:14:99:512:471:99:g_d0_f2:99:g_d0_f2:F:common wisdom, super stars firms have not become larger, havenot become more productive, and the
3:51:2191:14:15:99:512:457:99:g_d0_f2:99:g_d0_f2:F:contribution of star firms to aggregate U.S. productivity growth has fallen by more than one third since
3:52:2295:15:25:99:122:442:99:g_d0_f2:99:g_d0_f2:F:2000.

3:54:2392:16:17:71:539:401:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:exports, foreign direct investment, and research and development. The top firm accounts for more than
3:55:2493:17:16:71:539:384:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:14% of exports in most countries (Freund and Denisse Pierola,2015). Companies with more than 5,000
3:56:2591:16:17:72:540:368:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:employees accounted for two thirds of the $375 billion that U.S. Businesses spent on R&D in 2016 (Wolfe,
3:57:2695:17:16:72:540:351:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:2018).Gabaix(2011)arguesthatidiosyncraticshockstolargefirmscanexplainsome of the fluctuations in
3:58:2791:16:17:72:96:335:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:GDP.
3:59:2795:17:16:88:539:318:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:A:Moreover, we know from previous research that, over the past20 years, US firms’ profit margins have
3:60:2894:16:17:71:539:302:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:increased and U.S. industries have become more concentrated, although there is disagreement about how
3:61:2995:17:16:71:539:285:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:to interpret this fact (Furman,2015;Grullon et al.,2016;Gutiérrez and Philippon,2017b).1Two leading
3:62:3094:16:16:72:539:269:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:explanations have been proposed. One is that top firms have become increasingly more efficient than other
3:63:3199:16:17:72:539:253:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:firms in their respective industries. This might explain whytheir market shares and their profits have grown.
3:64:3308:17:16:72:540:236:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:According to this view, concentration is good news and high profits reflect high efficiency (Autor et al.,
3:65:3414:16:23:72:540:220:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:2017). The other explanation is that domestic competition has decreased and that leaders have become more

4:79:4813:17:16:72:539:692:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:view, concentration is bad news (Gutiérrez and Philippon,2017a). The two explanations are not mutually
4:80:4915:16:17:72:543:676:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:exclusive, in the sense that leaders can become more efficientandmoreentrenchedatthesametime. In
4:81:5011:17:16:72:539:659:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:particular, leaders might be particularly efficient at usingintangibleassets(Crouzet and Eberly,2018). This
4:82:5118:16:17:72:539:643:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:can explain their growth, but also create rising barriers toentry. But, fundamentally, the two explanations
4:83:5225:17:16:72:372:626:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:have opposite implications for efficiency, growth, welfareand policy.
4:84:5294:16:16:88:539:610:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:A:The optimistic view seems to take as given the idea that superstar firms are becoming larger, more pro-
4:85:5397:16:17:72:543:594:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:ductive, and are pulling away from the rest of the economy. Theactualevidence,however,isweakerand
4:86:5494:17:16:72:543:577:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:more indirect than commonly acknowledged.Andrews et al.(2015)documentanincreaseddispersionin

4:88:5691:17:16:72:540:544:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:most commentators jump to the conclusion that Google and Facebook (for instance) have outstanding pro-
4:89:5793:16:17:72:540:528:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:ductivity growth, and that the problem lies with the rest of the economy. In the global data ofAndrews et al.
4:90:5902:17:16:72:540:511:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:(2015), however, the average frontier firm in Manufacturing has about $50 million in revenues and 74 em-
4:91:6006:16:17:71:543:495:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:ployees (see their Table 1b). The revenues of frontier firms inServicesisabout$80million. Thesefirms
4:92:6106:17:16:71:539:478:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:are not what most people have in mind when they talk about the “stars” of the new economy. They are two
4:93:6209:16:16:71:542:462:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:order of magnitude smaller.Autor et al.(2017)havepopularizedtheterm“superstarfirms.”Theyshowthat
4:94:6305:16:17:72:542:446:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:the fall in the labor share is explained by a composition shifttowardsestablishmentswithlowlaborshares.
4:95:6408:17:16:72:492:429:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:This, by itself, does not mean that superstar firms are becoming either larger or more productive.
4:96:6506:16:17:88:540:413:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:A:The point of our paper is simple: we actually look directly atsuper star firms over the past 60 years in
4:97:6610:17:16:72:540:396:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:the US. What we find contradicts the common wisdom. We show that: (i) super-star firms have not become
4:98:6712:16:17:72:543:380:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:larger; super-star firms have not become more productive; thecontributionofsuper-starfirmstooverall

4:100:6879:39:27:72:137:324:206:g_d0_f5:206:g_d0_f5:C:1Data
4:101:6884:27:17:72:539:297:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:We use firm-level data from the CRSP-Compustat merged database, which covers all public and some private

4:103:7087:16:17:72:539:264:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:as well as Gross Output quantities and prices from the BEA GDPby Industry accounts. These data cover
4:104:7187:17:16:72:539:247:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:20 sectors since 1948 and 62 industries since 1977. We use these data to estimate industry-level labor
4:105:7289:16:16:72:446:231:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:productivity and to deflate Compustat sales and compute firm-level labor productivity.
4:106:7375:16:17:88:540:215:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:A:Second, we obtain domestic and foreign sales at the industry-level from the BEA’s Data on the Ac-

4:108:7577:16:17:72:539:182:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:by Industry accounts. We estimate the share of foreign salesin a given industry as the ratio of sales by

5:128:9261:16:26:123:483:448:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:A:industry. This actually happens early in the sample, especially when including Oil.
5:129:9344:26:16:71:539:422:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:The top panel of1shows the shares of stars in civilian employment. The Top 20 employed about 4% of

5:131:9547:16:17:72:539:390:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:because of the arrival of Walmart among the stars. The Top 4 byIndustry is more stable around 8%. Clearly,
5:132:9653:17:16:72:372:373:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:as far as employment is concerned, the stars are not becominglarger.
5:133:9721:16:17:88:539:357:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:A:The bottom panel of1shows the shares of stars in sales over GDP. The sales over GDPratio is of
5:134:9815:17:16:72:539:340:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:course critically important because ofHulten(1978), as we discussed in the next section. For each group
5:135:9918:16:17:72:539:324:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:of stars, we report the consolidated sales and the domestic sales. To compute domestic sales, we subtract
5:136:10023:17:16:72:539:307:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:the export shares of top firms by industries using detailed data from the BEA’s Data on the activities of U.S.

5:138:10235:17:25:72:174:274:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:larger in terms of sales.
5:139:10260:25:25:72:343:249:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f8:C:Fact 1.The economic footprint of the stars has not increased.
5:140:10321:25:17:88:539:224:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:A:The stable employment footprint is a known fact (seeAutor et al. 2017for instance). The fact that
5:141:10418:17:16:72:543:207:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:revenues are stable as a share of GDP is new and surprising. Figure 1 inGabaix(2011)reportsthatsales
5:142:10518:16:17:72:539:191:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:of the top 50 firms are 24% of GDP, while the sales of the top 100 firms are 29% of GDP. These numbers
5:143:10620:17:16:72:540:174:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:are for consolidated revenues and we estimate that about 1/3are exports. Moreover the share exported has
5:144:10724:16:17:72:539:158:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:grown over time. Consolidated sales over domestic GDP therefore do not provide a reliable picture of the
5:145:10828:17:16:72:539:141:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:evolution of large firms. One could either scale global salesby global GDP, or domestic sales by domestic
5:146:10933:16:16:72:539:125:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:GDP, which is what we do in this paper. Once we perform this export adjustment, we overturn the common
5:147:11035:16:34:72:342:109:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:wisdom that stars have become larger relative to the economy.

7:170:12617:17:16:71:117:390:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:consistent.
7:171:12628:16:17:88:540:374:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:A:Figure2shows that super stars have played a key role in making the economy grow. Historically, they
7:172:12727:17:16:72:539:357:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:have contributed half a percent to total labor productivitygrowth (based on industry stars, bottom panel). In
7:173:12836:16:24:72:523:341:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:recent years, however, their “within” contribution to overproductivity growth has been essentially zero.

7:177:13145:17:38:72:507:260:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:One possible explanation is that ideas are becoming harder tofindasarguedbyBloom et al.(2018).
7:178:13239:38:28:72:184:222:206:g_d0_f5:206:g_d0_f5:C:4Reallocation
7:179:13252:28:16:72:540:194:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:The Hulten contribution assumes that revenue factor productivities are equalized across firms. If the stars
7:180:13359:16:17:72:540:178:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:have higher revenue productivity than other firms, then theycan contribute to productivity growth simply by
7:181:13466:17:16:72:539:161:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:drawing in more resources. This is what the literature callsthe reallocation effect. The Hulten contribution
7:182:13574:16:30:72:419:145:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:would fail to pick that up. We define the reallocation contribution of the stars as

10:200:14794:17:16:72:539:616:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:line uses quality adjusted labor. Without the quality adjustment – i.e., assuming that stars hire the ‘average’
10:201:14905:16:17:72:539:600:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:worker in their industry – we get the green triangle line. If instead we assume that stars poach the extra
10:202:15011:17:16:72:540:583:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:worker from other large firms, we get the blue square line. It seems clear that the green line is misleading,
10:203:15120:16:17:72:523:567:119:g_d0_f2:64:g_d0_f2:B:while both the red and the blue are sensible choices. For simplicity, we just use the average of the two.4
10:204:15226:17:16:88:539:550:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:A:Figure4shows the reallocation contribution of the stars. The reallocation contribution has increased
10:205:15326:16:25:72:445:534:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:since the mid 1990s, bringing about 20 basis point of productivity growth on average.
10:206:15411:25:26:72:393:509:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f8:C:Fact 3.The reallocation contribution of the stars has increased modestly.
10:207:15484:26:16:88:542:483:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:A:The overall increase in the reallocation contribution comesinpartfromthegrowingimportanceofnon-
10:208:15579:16:17:72:539:467:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:manufacturing sectors. The average contribution of reallocation is larger outside manufacturing than inside
10:209:15686:17:16:72:542:450:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:manufacturing. This is consistent with the evidence inMansury and Love(2008)whoarguethatinnovation
10:210:15784:16:17:72:539:434:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:in business services has a positive effect on growth (size) but not on measured productivity. In other words,
10:211:15893:17:16:72:539:417:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:in the service sector, the “innovation” might be to reach andconvince new clients, as opposed to reducing
10:212:15998:16:16:72:538:401:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:the unit cost of existing services. It is also interesting tosee that the increased in the reallocation contribution
10:213:16114:16:39:72:309:385:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:coincides with the decrease in the Hulten contribution.

10:216:16301:16:17:72:539:302:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:The blue and green lines are based on Compustat. From 1960 to 2000, it was about 72 basis point per year
10:217:16405:17:16:72:543:285:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:on average for the industry stars (33 bps for the Top 20). After2000thecontributionsareonly43basis

10:219:16534:17:16:88:539:252:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:A:One might worry that large private firms are missing from Compustat. The gray line therefore uses the

10:223:16947:17:16:71:540:186:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:in the Appendix, Compustat and Census-based series are veryclose to each once restricting the Compustat

10:225:17097:25:17:71:539:145:119:g_d0_f5:119:g_d0_f8:C:Fact 4.The contribution of star firms to US labor productivity has decreased by about 40% since 2000, and
10:226:17202:17:20:72:422:128:119:g_d0_f8:119:g_d0_f8:C:it has shifted from within firm productivity growth to reallocation driven growth.
10:227:17284:20:15:88:540:108:36:g_d0_f2:80:g_d0_f2:F:4One issue with this measure of growth through reallocation isthatitdoesnotdistinguishbetweenorganicgrowthandexternal

11:234:18009:33:16:88:540:395:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:A:Over the same period, total labor productivity growth has also fallen. Figure6shows aggregate la-

11:236:18209:17:16:72:539:362:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:between aggregate productivity growth and the industry-star contribution. Non-stars contribute more than
11:237:18313:16:17:72:539:346:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:stars to overall growth and explain most of the time series variations, such as the sharp drop around 1980 or

11:239:18526:16:16:72:542:313:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:contribution has collapsed after the great recession, whilethatofthestarshaspickedupalittlebitsince

11:245:18924:16:17:72:539:181:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:less surprising for students of history. There is a natural bias to think that today is different – to paraphrase

11:247:19132:16:17:72:540:148:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:been star firms in the U.S. economy, and they have always been large and productive. In our data, we find
11:248:19237:17:16:72:331:131:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:that today’s stars are no match (so far) for yesterday’s stars.
11:249:19300:16:17:88:539:115:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:A:The next question, of course, is why star firms are not contributing as much as they used to. We do
11:250:19399:17:16:72:539:98:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:not have a definite answer but it is clear that something changed around 2000. Perhaps ideas are becoming
11:251:19504:16:0:72:540:82:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:harder to find asBloom et al.(2018)argue. Orperhapsdecliningcompetitionandrisingbarriers to entry

12:257:20017:16:17:72:539:363:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:entry condition starts to break down around 2000. The elasticity of entry with respect to profits and/or

18:438:34594:17:16:71:539:247:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:per employee than other established firms. In the 2000s, however, that difference has vanished. The Bottom

18:440:34806:16:17:71:542:215:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:BEA. For industry stars, we again observe no trend. For the Top20weobservearelativeincrease,butaswe
18:441:34905:17:16:71:540:198:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:show later, this is entirely explained by increasing differences in labor quality (the top 20 stars higher more
18:442:35016:16:17:71:242:182:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:productive and expensive labor inputs).

22:469:36554:17:16:72:540:512:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:increased according to both measures, but the trends are fairly smooth. There does not appear to be a major
22:470:36661:16:39:72:134:496:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:break in 2000.

22:476:37102:16:17:72:539:364:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:boost due to leverage. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac top the ranking, which are hard to classify as superstars
22:477:37209:17:16:72:539:347:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:of the last decade. Sales over-weights manufacturing firms and discounts tech firms which are at the core of
22:478:37317:16:17:72:411:331:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:the discussion. In fact, only Apple and Amazon appear in the Top 20 by sales.

22:480:37493:16:16:72:539:298:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:column shows that 20% of the Top 100 stars by MVE belong to the Top 20 stars by MVE, as expected. For
22:481:37594:16:17:72:452:282:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:the reasons discussed above, we find a relatively low level ofoverlap across definitions.
22:482:37683:17:16:88:539:265:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:A:The above might be concerning if conclusions vary widely across definitions. However, as shown in the
22:483:37784:16:17:72:540:249:119:g_d0_f2:119:g_d0_f2:B:following figures, all conclusions remain when using sales instead of market value to rank firms. Figure19
