2:40:2521:28:14:72:548:574:12:Times:12:Times:Can  a  behavioral  sufficient  statistic  empirically  capture  cross-consumer  variation  in  behavioral 
2:41:2628:14:14:72:547:560:12:Times:12:Times:tendencies and  help  identify  whether  behavioral  biases,  taken  together,  are  linked  to  material 
2:42:2733:14:14:72:548:546:12:Times:12:Times:consumer  welfare losses?  Our  answer  is  yes.  We  construct  simple  consumer-level  behavioral 
2:43:2832:14:14:72:548:532:12:Times:12:Times:sufficient  statistics—“B-counts”—by eliciting  seventeen  potential  sources  of  behavioral  biases 
2:44:2933:14:14:72:544:518:12:Times:12:Times:per person, in a nationally representative panel, in two separate rounds nearly three years apart. B-
2:45:3033:14:14:72:548:504:12:Times:12:Times:counts  aggregate  information  on  behavioral biases  within-person.  Nearly  all  consumers  exhibit 
2:46:3135:14:14:72:548:490:12:Times:12:Times:multiple  biases,  in  patterns  assumed  by  behavioral sufficient  statistic  models  (a  la  Chetty),  and 
2:47:3244:14:14:72:548:476:12:Times:12:Times:with substantial variation across people. B-counts are stable within-consumer over time, and that 
2:48:3341:14:14:72:548:462:12:Times:12:Times:stability  helps  to  address  measurement  error  when  using B-counts  to  model  the  relationship 
2:49:3442:14:14:72:548:448:12:Times:12:Times:between  biases,  decision  utility,  and  experienced  utility.  Conditional on  classical  inputs—risk 
2:50:3546:14:14:72:547:434:12:Times:12:Times:aversion  and  patience,  life-cycle  factors  and  other  demographics,  cognitive and  non-cognitive 
2:51:3648:14:14:72:547:420:12:Times:12:Times:skills,  and  financial  resources—B-counts  strongly  negatively  correlate  with  both objective  and 
2:52:3751:14:14:72:548:406:12:Times:12:Times:subjective  aspects  of  experienced  utility.  The  results  hold  in  much  lower-dimensional models

3:70:4406:20:21:93:522:688:144:Times:144:Times:“A  common  criticism  of  behavioral  economics  is  that  it  does  not  offer  a  single  unified

3:77:4834:20:21:94:543:543:144:Times:144:Times:Behavioral  social  scientists  have  identified  myriad  biases  in  decision  making  that  could

3:79:5036:21:20:71:543:501:144:Times:144:Times:model—a “general  procedure”  per  Gabaix,  or a  “single  unified  framework”  per  Chetty—is 
3:80:5131:20:21:71:136:481:144:Times:144:Times:challenging.  
3:81:5145:21:21:94:542:460:144:Times:144:Times:Some researchers are responding to that challenge with models where a behavioral sufficient 
3:82:5237:21:21:71:543:439:144:Times:144:Times:statistic represents consumer-level behavioral tendencies and their links to decisions/outcomes.1 
3:83:5334:21:20:72:546:418:144:Times:144:Times:But  those  models  lack  empirical  validation. Most  empirical  work  in  behavioral  economics  
3:84:5432:20:21:72:543:398:144:Times:144:Times:examines only one or two biases at a time, and we do not know of any prior work that seeks to 
3:85:5526:21:21:72:517:377:144:Times:144:Times:measure consumer-level behavioral sufficient statistics and their links to consumer welfare.2 
3:86:5619:21:20:94:545:356:144:Times:144:Times:An  empirically  valid  behavioral  sufficient  statistic  has  many  applications.  Several  recent  
3:87:5721:20:21:72:539:336:144:Times:144:Times:papers show that if behavioral decision making tendencies can be summarized with a consumer-
3:88:5813:21:21:72:543:315:144:Times:144:Times:level sufficient statistic, then that statistic becomes a powerful input for intervention design and 
3:89:5914:21:21:72:542:294:144:Times:144:Times:welfare analysis.3 Policymakers increasingly formulate high-level strategy and specific regulations 
3:90:6014:21:20:71:540:273:144:Times:144:Times:based on assumptions about how multiple biases, taken together, are prevalent and affect decision-

3:92:6211:49:17:72:542:204:49:Times:121:Times:1 For  reviews  see,  e.g.,  the  reduced-form  sufficient  statistic  models  in  Chetty  (2009,  2015)  and 
3:93:6321:17:8:72:486:187:121:Times:121:Times:Mullainathan, Schwartzstein, and Congdon (2012), and the sparsity models in Gabaix (2019). 
3:94:6412:8:17:72:543:179:49:Times:121:Times:2 The  closest  work  to  ours  is  Chapman  et  al.  (2018a,  2018b),  Dean  and  Ortoleva  (2018),  and  Gillen  et  
3:95:6531:17:13:71:543:162:121:Times:121:Times:al.   (forthcoming): those papers also measure multiple biases per person and examine relationships among 
3:96:6637:13:8:71:513:149:121:Times:121:Times:biases. But they do not link their biases to field outcomes or develop behavioral sufficient statistics.

4:102:7220:0:20:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:presume that multiple behavioral biases affect behavior.5 A behavioral sufficient statistic can be 
4:103:7319:20:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:used  for  targeting, for theory-testing  (based,  e.g.,  on  predictions  about  heterogeneous  treatment 
4:104:7426:21:21:72:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:effects), for estimating model inputs (such as the average marginal bias that is key in Allcott and 
4:105:7526:21:21:72:542:646:144:Times:144:Times:Taubinsky (2015)), and for descriptively filling gaps where unobserved heterogeneity in consumer 
4:106:7623:21:20:72:540:625:144:Times:144:Times:decision  making  looms  large:  one  example  among  many  is  the  still  largely  unexplained  cross-
4:107:7727:20:21:71:381:605:144:Times:144:Times:sectional distribution of wealth (Poterba 2014; Campbell 2016). 
4:108:7791:21:21:94:542:584:144:Times:144:Times:We tighten the link between behavioral sufficient statistic theory and empirics by developing, 
4:109:7886:21:20:71:543:563:144:Times:144:Times:measuring,   and   examining “B-counts”: consumer-level   statistics   that capture   behavioral 
4:110:7983:20:21:71:539:543:144:Times:144:Times:tendencies by aggregating information on multiple biases within-person. We adapt standard lab-
4:111:8077:21:21:71:542:522:144:Times:144:Times:style elicitation methods to measure 17 potential sources of behavioral biases per consumer (Table 
4:112:8176:21:20:71:543:501:144:Times:144:Times:1), in about 30 minutes of online survey/task time.6 We then administer those elicitations twice, in 
4:113:8277:20:21:72:542:481:144:Times:144:Times:two separate rounds of data collection about three years apart, to the same plausibly representative 
4:114:8378:21:21:72:545:460:144:Times:144:Times:sample  of  845 U.S.  consumers  from  the  American  Life  Panel.  We  also  collect  rich  data  on  
4:115:8481:21:21:72:546:439:144:Times:144:Times:outcomes (various  measures  of  objective  and  subjective  well-being in  financial  and  other  
4:116:8580:21:20:71:543:418:144:Times:144:Times:domains), “classical decision  inputs”    (cognitive  and  non-cognitive  skills,  presumed-classical 
4:117:8682:20:21:71:430:398:144:Times:144:Times:preferences, life-cycle factors and other demographics), and survey effort. 
4:118:8758:21:21:94:543:377:144:Times:144:Times:B-counts summarize  behavioral  tendencies  at  the  consumer-level, simply: they  count  how 
4:119:8852:21:20:71:542:356:144:Times:144:Times:many biases  (  deviations  from  the  classical  benchmark)   a  consumer  exhibits.  In  addition  to  a 
4:120:8959:20:21:71:544:336:144:Times:144:Times:Chetty-like  “Full”  B-count based  on  all  17 potential  sources  we  measure,  we  also  construct  a  
4:121:9065:21:21:71:543:315:144:Times:144:Times:number of “B-sub-counts” motivated by other classes of models, including: “Sparsity B-counts” 
4:122:9159:21:20:71:547:294:144:Times:144:Times:focusing  on  limited  attention/memory  and  related  phenomena  following  Gabaix;   an  “Expected  
4:123:9261:20:21:71:540:274:144:Times:144:Times:Direction B-   count”  including  present-bias  but  not  future-bias,  over-confidence  but  not  under-
4:124:9366:21:21:71:547:253:144:Times:144:Times:confidence,  and  so  on;7 a  “Preference  B-count” that  includes  inconsistency  with  revealed  
4:125:9465:21:21:72:543:232:144:Times:144:Times:preference, loss aversion, etc., but not biased beliefs or problem-solving approaches; and a “Math 
4:126:9564:21:20:72:435:211:144:Times:144:Times:B-count” including only exponential growth biases and statistical fallacies. 
4:127:9641:20:21:94:543:191:144:Times:144:Times:We then present five sets of results showing that B-counts are useful and practical tools for 
4:128:9735:21:54:72:382:170:144:Times:144:Times:developing and applying models of consumer decision making.

4:130:9854:12:17:72:543:104:49:Times:121:Times:6 We chose the 17 based on prior work linking biases to consumer decisions, particularly in the financial 
4:131:9960:17:9:71:462:87:121:Times:121:Times:domain, and on practical considerations and constraints. See Section 3-A for discussion. 
4:132:10048:9:0:72:358:78:49:Times:121:Times:7 We borrow the “expected” label from Chapman et al. (2018a).  
5:133:10112:0:20:94:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:First, B-counts validate assumptions required for behavioral sufficient statistic models to be 
5:134:10207:20:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:relevant and useful for policy and welfare analysis. One example is that behavioral tendencies are 
5:135:10306:21:21:72:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:more  common  than  rare:  nearly  everyone  exhibits  multiple  biases,  and  a   consumer  at  the  10th 
5:136:10412:21:21:72:544:646:144:Times:144:Times:percentile  has  a  B-count  of  7  out  of  a  possible  17  in  each  of  our  two  survey  rounds.  Another  
5:137:10524:21:20:72:543:625:144:Times:144:Times:example is that consumers are biased on average (Allcott and Taubinsky 2015), in the sense that 
5:138:10620:20:21:72:543:605:144:Times:144:Times:expected-direction biases (e.g., preference for certainty)   emphasized by prior literature are more 
5:139:10721:21:21:72:551:584:144:Times:144:Times:prevalent than “non-expected direction” biases (e.g., preference for uncertainty).    Also prevalent 
5:140:10822:21:20:72:542:563:144:Times:144:Times:are limited attention and memory, Gabaix’s  postulated  “psychological  foundations”  for  sparsity 
5:141:10922:20:21:72:545:543:144:Times:144:Times:models, as well as “behavioral phenomena” (other biases) that can emerge from sparsity models.8  
5:142:11019:21:21:94:543:522:144:Times:144:Times:Second,  B-counts are  stable  within-consumer  over  time.  The  within-person cross-round 
5:143:11111:21:20:72:542:501:144:Times:144:Times:correlation in our Full B-count is 0.44—a high number relative to prior work estimating temporal 
5:144:11208:20:21:72:542:481:144:Times:144:Times:stability  in  behavioral  biases  or presumed-classical  preferences.  B-count stability presents 
5:145:11307:21:21:72:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:opportunities to account for measurement error when estimating conditional correlations between 
5:146:11403:21:21:72:542:439:144:Times:144:Times:outcomes and B-counts, either by instrumenting for one round’s B-count with the other (“standard 
5:147:11500:21:20:72:543:418:144:Times:144:Times:IV”),  or  better  yet  by  instrumenting  both  ways  with  Obviously  Related  Instrumental  Variables 
5:148:11604:20:21:72:287:398:144:Times:144:Times:(Gillen, Snowberg, and Yariv forthcoming). 
5:149:11647:21:21:94:543:377:144:Times:144:Times: Third, and perhaps most fundamentally for sufficient statistic and other behavioral models, 
5:150:11740:21:20:72:543:356:144:Times:144:Times:B-counts strongly  and  negatively  correlate  with  both subjective  and  objective  well-being, 
5:151:11838:20:21:71:542:336:144:Times:144:Times:conditional  on  our  rich  sets   of covariates.9 A simple  framework,  drawing  on  Chetty  (2015), 
5:152:11940:21:21:72:543:315:144:Times:144:Times:Benjamin et al. (2014) and Benjamin et al. (2014), clarifies conditions under which the B-count 
5:153:12036:21:21:72:543:294:144:Times:144:Times:captures a systematic wedge between decision utility (what consumers expect to gain from their 
5:154:12131:21:20:72:545:273:144:Times:144:Times:decisions)  and  experienced  utility  (what  they  actually  gain  from  their  decisions).  This  in  turn  
5:155:12241:20:21:72:544:253:144:Times:144:Times:clarifies what one can  and  cannot  infer  about  consumer  welfare  from  conditional  correlations  
5:156:12344:21:40:72:543:232:144:Times:144:Times:between different outcome measures and B-counts. We show how our approach addresses classical 
5:157:12437:40:17:72:543:192:49:Times:121:Times:8 Our  direct  elicitation  data  thus  complements  empirical  work  using  other  methods  to  explore  the  nature  
5:158:12556:17:13:71:543:175:121:Times:121:Times:and  economic  importance  of  limited  attention  and  other  behavioral  biases;  for  attention-focused  reviews  
5:159:12673:13:12:71:543:162:121:Times:121:Times:see Gabaix (2019) and Handel and Schwartzstein (2018), for broader reviews see Bernheim et al. (2018, 
5:160:12775:12:13:71:542:150:121:Times:121:Times:2019). The prevalence of limited attention and price misperceptions also makes it plausible that bias-born 
5:161:12882:13:13:71:542:137:121:Times:121:Times:mistakes can persist because learning is slow or otherwise imperfect (e.g., Ali 2011; Bordalo, Gennaioli, 
5:162:12988:13:8:71:314:124:121:Times:121:Times:and Shleifer 2017; Gabaix 2017; Schwartzstein 2014). 
5:163:13041:8:17:72:542:116:49:Times:121:Times:9 Quantitatively speaking, in our nine main specifications estimating the conditional correlation between an 
5:164:13150:17:12:71:542:99:121:Times:121:Times:outcome and a B-count, the B-count always has a p-value<0.01, and a one standard deviation change in a 
5:165:13253:12:13:71:543:87:121:Times:121:Times:B-count  is  associated  with  a  22  to  30%  reduction  in  objective  financial  condition  and  a  26%  to  43%  
5:166:13370:13:0:71:263:74:121:Times:121:Times:reduction in subjective financial condition. 
6:167:13415:0:20:72:542:708:144:Times:144:Times:measurement error and also consider various non-classical measurement error structures. They are 
6:168:13511:20:21:71:536:688:144:Times:144:Times:unlikely to confound our inferences, given our research design and the overall pattern of results. 
6:169:13609:21:21:94:545:667:144:Times:144:Times:The  negative  conditional  correlations  between  outcomes  and  B-counts  hold  for  different  
6:170:13707:21:21:71:546:646:144:Times:144:Times:covariate  specifications  (a  la  Altonji et  al.  (2005)),  including  ones  where  we  allow  for  
6:171:13809:21:20:71:544:625:144:Times:144:Times:measurement error in classical inputs,  add  objective  financial  condition  as  an  additional  control  
6:172:13916:20:21:71:542:605:144:Times:144:Times:when subjective financial condition is the outcome of interest, or drop all other covariates entirely. 
6:173:14018:21:21:71:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:We  draw  outcomes  from  other  ALP  surveys  as  well  as  our  own,  and  find that  the  negative 
6:174:14120:21:20:71:542:563:144:Times:144:Times:conditional correlations hold for different “aspects” of experienced utility (per Benjamin et al.)— 
6:175:14220:20:21:71:543:543:144:Times:144:Times:life  satisfaction,  happiness,  and  health  status—at  least  when  we  use the  Sparsity  B-counts as 
6:176:14325:21:21:71:543:522:144:Times:144:Times:sufficient statistics. The results are too imprecise to characterize for non-financial aspects when 
6:177:14425:21:20:71:542:501:144:Times:144:Times:we  use  the Full  B-count as  the  sufficient  statistic,  perhaps  because we  chose  our  17  potential 
6:178:14532:20:21:71:471:481:144:Times:144:Times:sources of behavioral biases with financial decision making in particular in mind.   
6:179:14617:21:21:94:542:460:144:Times:144:Times:Decomposing the Full B-count into couplet sub-counts sheds further light on mechanisms and 
6:180:14708:21:21:71:543:439:144:Times:144:Times:welfare implications. The Full B-count’s correlations with outcomes are driven more robustly by 
6:181:14804:21:20:71:543:418:144:Times:144:Times:the thirteen  non-math  biases  than by the  four math biases  that  are  more  arguably  reflections  of  
6:182:14911:20:21:71:542:398:144:Times:144:Times:classical math/cognitive skills. The results are not driven by the seven preference biases, which is 
6:183:15012:21:21:71:539:377:144:Times:144:Times:notable because  behavioral  preferences  are  less  clearly  welfare-reducing  than the ten  non-
6:184:15110:21:20:71:542:356:144:Times:144:Times:preference   biases   (e.g., biased expectations,   price   perceptions, limited attention/memory). 
6:185:15210:20:21:71:542:336:144:Times:144:Times:Expected-d irection biases (e.g., present-bias) robustly negatively correlate   with outcomes, while 
6:186:15311:21:21:71:340:315:144:Times:144:Times:non-expected direction biases (e.g. future-bias) do not.  
6:187:15369:21:20:94:546:294:144:Times:144:Times:Fourth,  B-counts capture  information  distinct  from  that measured  by  classical  decision  
6:188:15465:20:21:71:544:274:144:Times:144:Times:inputs/covariates. As noted above, our estimated conditional correlations between outcomes and 
6:189:15560:21:21:71:544:253:144:Times:144:Times:B-counts are  virtually  invariant  to  the  set  of  covariates. Moreover, those  other  covariates  only  
6:190:15668:21:20:71:544:232:144:Times:144:Times:weakly  explain  B-counts themselves;  e.g., regressing  a  B-count  measure  on  the  complete  set  of  
6:191:15774:20:21:71:543:212:144:Times:144:Times:other covariates yields an R-squared of 0.25 or less for the Sparsity B-counts and 0.33 for the Full 
6:192:15875:21:21:71:124:191:144:Times:144:Times:B-   count. 
6:193:15887:21:21:94:543:170:144:Times:144:Times:Fifth,  one  can  add  B-counts to  many  research  designs with simple,  quick elicitations.  The 
6:194:15986:21:20:71:543:149:144:Times:144:Times:Narrow Sparsity  B-count  takes  less  than  two  minutes to  elicit,  and  in  our  main  specification  it 
6:195:16095:20:21:71:540:129:144:Times:144:Times:correlates with experienced utility aspects at least as strongly as the Full B-count does. Even B-
6:196:16193:21:21:71:543:108:144:Times:144:Times:counts  constructed  using  subsets  of  our  17  behavioral elicitations  selected at  random  deliver 
6:197:16297:21:0:71:543:87:144:Times:144:Times:average coefficient magnitudes and precision similar to those obtained by using the Full B-count. 
7:198:16396:0:20:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:Altogether, our results suggest that measuring a handful of behavioral biases can usefully capture 
7:199:16494:20:21:72:274:688:144:Times:144:Times:consumer-level behavioral heterogeneity. 
7:200:16535:21:21:94:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:Summarizing   our   results:    Our   simple   behavioral   sufficient   statistics,   B-counts,   have 
7:201:16639:21:21:72:540:646:144:Times:144:Times:distributional properties required for them to be useful for welfare analysis. They are stable within-
7:202:16741:21:20:72:542:625:144:Times:144:Times:consumer over time, and one can use that stability to allow for measurement error when estimating 
7:203:16839:20:21:72:543:605:144:Times:144:Times:relationships  between  outcomes  and  B-counts.  B-counts capture consumer  heterogeneity  that  is  
7:204:16941:21:21:72:545:584:144:Times:144:Times:distinct  from  classical  decision  inputs  like  cognitive  and  non-cognitive  skills.  Relatedly  and  
7:205:17048:21:20:72:544:563:144:Times:144:Times:perhaps  most  importantly,  B-counts strongly  conditionally  correlate  with  both  quantitative  and  
7:206:17153:20:21:72:543:543:144:Times:144:Times:subjective  measures  of  well-being, in  ways  that  are  consistent  with  behavioral  biases  having 
7:207:17257:21:21:72:543:522:144:Times:144:Times:negative, reinforcing effects on consumer welfare. Measuring low-dimensional B-counts can be a 
7:208:17352:21:20:72:543:501:144:Times:144:Times:valuable and practical addition to many research designs. Efficient measurement likely involves 
7:209:17448:20:21:72:542:481:144:Times:144:Times:conducting two elicitations of a B-count (because repeated elicitation has great value in accounting 
7:210:17549:21:21:72:542:460:144:Times:144:Times:for measurement error), and using theory to guide the selection of outcomes and biases to measure 
7:211:17647:21:21:72:539:439:144:Times:144:Times:(as we have done, e.g., in linking financial outcomes to our 17 potential biases, and in defining B-
7:212:17747:21:20:72:260:418:144:Times:144:Times:sub-counts based on sparsity models).  
7:213:17786:20:27:94:532:398:144:Times:144:Times:The next section formalizes our approach and provides a roadmap for the rest of the paper. 
7:214:17877:27:27:72:215:371:144:Times:144:Times:1. Conceptual Framework 
7:215:17899:27:20:94:542:344:144:Times:144:Times:Conceptually, a  behavioral  sufficient  statistic  is  a  consumer-level metric  reflecting overall 
7:216:18000:20:21:72:542:324:144:Times:144:Times:behavioral tendencies and their links to consumer decision making and welfare. Such a behavioral 
7:217:18097:21:21:72:543:303:144:Times:144:Times:sufficient statistic is a linchpin of models such as those in Chetty (2015) and Gabaix (various) but 
7:218:18198:21:20:72:311:282:144:Times:144:Times:has not been measured directly in previous work. 
7:219:18247:20:21:94:542:262:144:Times:144:Times:Chetty-style models  employ  a  sufficient  statistic as  a  proxy  for many  different  behavioral 
7:220:18347:21:21:72:542:241:144:Times:144:Times:phenomena. This approach “does not require specifying the exact behavioral model that describes 
7:221:18443:21:20:72:544:220:144:Times:144:Times:agents’  choices” (Chetty  2015,  p.  25),  so  long  as  the  statistic  captures  the  combined  effects  of  
7:222:18555:20:21:72:476:200:144:Times:144:Times:multiple behavioral biases and satisfies other assumptions discussed in Section 3-E. 
7:223:18640:21:21:94:543:179:144:Times:144:Times:Gabaix’s sparsity and behavioral inattention models are more oriented toward fundamentals, 
7:224:18731:21:21:72:543:158:144:Times:144:Times:employing as a sufficient statistic a single, “psychologically founded” attention cost parameter m 
7:225:18829:21:0:72:543:137:144:Times:144:Times:that  “condenses”  behavioral  tendencies  toward  simplification,  inattention,  and  disproportionate 
8:226:18933:0:20:72:546:708:144:Times:144:Times:salience (Gabaix 2014,  p.  1662).10 From  that  foundation  “a large  number  of  behavioral  
8:227:19028:20:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:phenomena” emerge (Gabaix 2019, p.5), including price misperceptions, statistical fallacies, and 
8:228:19125:21:21:72:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:time-inconsistent discounting. Gabaix’s sufficient statistic approach allows one to tractably recast 
8:229:19226:21:21:72:345:646:144:Times:144:Times:basic micro and macro theory through a behavioral lens. 
8:230:19282:21:21:94:542:625:144:Times:144:Times:Following the broad strokes of Methods 1 and 2 in Chetty (2015), suppose a consumer i faces 
8:231:19374:21:20:72:546:604:144:Times:144:Times:market  prices  푝푝푖푖 and  resource  endowments  푤푤푖푖.  A  classical  consumer—one  with  standard  
8:232:19473:20:21:72:542:584:144:Times:144:Times:preferences, unbiased beliefs, and unbiased perceptions of prices—will make a utility-maximizing 
8:233:19570:21:28:72:343:563:144:Times:144:Times:set of consumption decisions 푥푥푖푖∗, giving decision utility: 
8:234:19631:28:28:239:375:535:144:g_d0_f8:144:Times:푉푉푖푖퐷퐷(푝푝푖푖,푤푤푖푖)=푉푉푖푖[푥푥푖푖∗(푝푝푖푖,푤푤푖푖)] 
8:235:19671:28:21:94:542:507:144:Times:144:Times:Now, suppose that consumers can also vary in a behavioral sufficient statistic 휃휃푖푖 that generates 
8:236:19770:21:28:72:465:486:144:Times:144:Times:a wedge between experienced utility  푉푉푖푖퐸퐸 and decision utility 푉푉푖푖퐷퐷, in which case:11 
8:237:19859:28:27:227:410:458:144:Times:144:Times:(1)   푉푉푖푖퐸퐸(푝푝푖푖,푤푤푖푖)=푉푉푖푖퐷퐷(푝푝푖푖,푤푤푖푖)−푓푓(휃휃푖푖) 
8:238:19908:27:21:94:542:431:144:Times:144:Times:This equation lays bare our empirical goal: to use B-counts to capture the behavioral sufficient 
8:239:20005:21:22:72:542:410:144:Times:144:Times:statistic 푓푓(휃휃푖푖), thereby explaining any wedge between decision and experienced utility. We do so 
8:240:20105:22:21:72:543:388:144:Times:144:Times:by empirically specifying  both  푉푉푖푖퐸퐸 (experienced  utility)  and  푉푉푖푖퐷퐷(decision  utility),  and  testing 
8:241:20214:21:21:72:543:367:144:Times:144:Times:whether B-counts empirically correlate with the difference between them, at the consumer level. 
8:242:20309:21:20:72:543:346:144:Times:144:Times:We  construct  and  use  B-counts  based  on  a  broad  set  of  biases  a  la  Chetty,  on  narrower  sets  of  
8:243:20422:20:21:72:543:326:144:Times:144:Times:biases emphasized by Gabaix’s sparsity and behavioral inattention models, and on other subsets 
8:244:20517:21:21:72:432:305:144:Times:144:Times:of biases suggested by other theories and taxonomies of behavioral biases. 
8:245:20592:21:20:94:543:284:144:Times:144:Times:Section  2 briefly  describes  our  research  design  and  data  collection  strategy  at  a  high  level, 
8:246:20699:20:21:72:538:264:144:Times:144:Times:focusing on sampling and elicitation strategies for collecting rich data on all three objects in (1).  
8:247:20802:21:21:94:542:243:144:Times:144:Times:Section 3 details how we measure our B-counts, in Sections 3-A and 3-B. We establish that 
8:248:20892:21:42:71:541:222:144:Times:144:Times:B-counts are stable within-person over time in Section 3-C, and that behavioral tendencies are both 
8:249:20992:42:18:72:543:180:49:Times:121:Times:10 Gabaix  uses “sparsity”  to  mean  consumer-level  whittling  of  the  set  of  economic  phenomena  used  for  
8:250:21107:18:12:71:542:162:121:Times:121:Times:decisionmaking, focusing on the most relevant ones and ignoring the less relevant ones, and consequently 
8:251:21212:12:13:71:542:150:121:Times:121:Times:incurring welfare costs (while saving attention costs). For example, concentrating on some prices but not 
8:252:21318:13:8:71:252:137:121:Times:121:Times:others is captured by the sparsity model. 
8:253:21359:8:17:72:542:129:49:Times:121:Times:11 This formulation is very similar Fahri and Gabaix’s (2018) equation (3), where “the behavioral wedge is 
8:254:21466:17:13:71:543:112:121:Times:121:Times:simply  given  by  the  wedge  between  the  decision  and  experienced  marginal  utilities.”  As with  a  wedge  
8:255:21581:13:12:71:544:99:121:Times:121:Times:expressed  in  level  utilities  or  prices,  the  overall  effect  is  to  create  a  gap  between  decision  utility  and  
8:256:21706:12:13:71:542:87:121:Times:121:Times:experienced utility. In both the (Fahri-)Gabaix representation and ours, decision utility and the wedge are 
8:257:21814:13:0:71:514:74:121:Times:121:Times:separable. We discuss the empirical validity of the separability assumption in the Results Appendix. 
9:258:21916:0:20:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:prevalent,  and distinct  from  classical  decision  inputs,  in  Section  3-D. We discuss  modeling 
9:259:22017:20:21:71:208:688:144:Times:144:Times:implications in Section 3-E. 
9:260:22046:21:21:94:542:667:144:Times:144:Times:Section 4 specifies our econometric model, with particular attention to measurement error in 
9:261:22139:21:21:71:541:646:144:Times:144:Times:the behavioral sufficient statistic, decision utility, and/or experienced utility, and lays out the ORIV 
9:262:22244:21:21:71:545:625:144:Times:144:Times:estimator and other features of our research design, including controls for respondent survey effort.  
9:263:22347:21:22:94:543:604:144:Times:144:Times:Section  5 presents various  specifications  of  empirics correlating 푉푉푖푖퐸퐸 with  B-counts 푓푓(휃휃푖푖),

9:265:22558:21:21:72:544:561:144:Times:144:Times:counts  are  empirically  distinct  from  other covariates.  Section  7 shows  that  one  can  elicit  and  
9:266:22666:21:20:72:542:540:144:Times:144:Times:employ B-counts with minimal survey time/expense. Section 8 concludes and offers directions for

9:269:22817:27:20:94:542:466:144:Times:144:Times:This section provides an overview of our research design, focusing on sampling and elicitation 
9:270:22912:20:21:72:543:446:144:Times:144:Times:strategies for constructing rich, consumer-level measures on all three objects in (1): experienced 
9:271:23011:21:27:72:357:425:144:Times:144:Times:utility, decision utility, and behavioral sufficient statistics.  
9:272:23077:27:21:72:185:398:144:Times:144:Times:A. Variables overview 
9:273:23097:21:20:94:543:377:144:Times:144:Times:We  measure  four multi-dimensional sets  of  consumer  characteristics.  One set includes  the 
9:274:23192:20:22:72:542:357:144:Times:144:Times:behavioral  biases we  use  to  construct  B-counts  (detailed  in  Section  3-A).  A  second  includes 
9:275:23296:22:21:72:542:335:144:Times:144:Times:outcomes used to construct measures of experienced utility  푉푉푖푖퐸퐸: objective and subjective measures 
9:276:23396:21:20:72:542:314:144:Times:144:Times:of financial well-being, and standard measures of other aspects of subjective well-being (Section 
9:277:23494:20:22:71:542:294:144:Times:144:Times:4-A). A third includes classical decision inputs (as distinct from behavioral decision inputs) used 
9:278:23594:22:21:72:542:272:144:Times:144:Times:to construct measures of decision utility 푉푉푖푖퐷퐷: demographics (including life-cycle factors), classical 
9:279:23698:21:21:71:543:251:144:Times:144:Times:time and risk preferences/attitudes, and cognitive and non-cognitive skills (Section 4-B). A fourth 
9:280:23798:21:20:71:542:230:144:Times:144:Times:set includes “survey effort”: measures of time spent on our elicitations, and of item non-response 
9:281:23897:20:21:71:143:210:144:Times:144:Times:(Section 4-A). 
9:282:23912:21:27:71:212:189:144:Times:144:Times:B. The American Life Panel 
9:283:23938:27:21:94:543:162:144:Times:144:Times:We administered our survey through the RAND American Life Panel (ALP). The ALP is an 
9:284:24023:21:20:71:543:141:144:Times:144:Times:online survey panel established in 2003. RAND regularly offers panel members opportunities to 
9:285:24117:20:21:72:543:121:144:Times:144:Times:participate in surveys, designed by researchers for purposes spanning the range of social sciences. 
9:286:24217:21:21:71:543:100:144:Times:144:Times:Over 400 surveys have been administered in the ALP, and RAND makes data publicly available 
9:287:24308:21:0:71:543:79:144:Times:144:Times:after a period of initial embargo. We use data from some of those other modules to complement 
10:288:24403:0:20:72:247:708:144:Times:144:Times:our data, as detailed in Section 5-D. 
10:289:24441:20:21:94:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:The ALP takes great pains to obtain a nationally representative sample, combining standard 
10:290:24532:21:21:72:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:sampling techniques with offers of hardware and a broadband connection to potential participants 
10:291:24628:21:21:72:542:646:144:Times:144:Times:who lack adequate Internet access. ALP sampling weights match the distribution of age, gender, 
10:292:24723:21:20:72:543:625:144:Times:144:Times:ethnicity, and income to the Current Population Survey. We show that our main results are robust 
10:293:24820:20:27:72:369:605:144:Times:144:Times:to using these weights (Sections 3-C and Results Appendix).  
10:294:24881:27:27:72:229:578:144:Times:144:Times:C. Research design and sample 
10:295:24910:27:20:94:546:551:144:Times:144:Times:Two  principles  guided  our  research  design.  First,  measure the  richest  set  of  individual  
10:296:25010:20:21:72:543:531:144:Times:144:Times:characteristics possible, to minimize confounds from omitted variables and allow exploration of 
10:297:25105:21:21:72:543:510:144:Times:144:Times:relationships between B-counts and classical/standard covariates such as demographics, cognitive 
10:298:25202:21:20:71:545:489:144:Times:144:Times:skills,  non-cognitive  skills  and  classical  preferences.  Second, take  repeated  measurements  at  
10:299:25306:20:21:71:543:469:144:Times:144:Times:different  points  in  time,  to  describe  the  temporal  stability  of  behavioral  sufficient  statistics  and  
10:300:25421:21:21:71:359:448:144:Times:144:Times:account for measurement error in consumer characteristics. 
10:301:25480:21:21:94:543:427:144:Times:144:Times:To those ends we administered our surveys to the same set of panelists twice, roughly three 
10:302:25571:21:20:72:543:406:144:Times:144:Times:years apart. Each survey round required about one hour of survey time per panelist on average, 
10:303:25666:20:21:72:544:386:144:Times:144:Times:with substantial  cross-  panelist  heterogeneity  in  response  time  that  we  observe  and  control  for,  
10:304:25776:21:21:72:343:365:144:Times:144:Times:using the ALP’s panelist-question-level “timings” data.  
10:305:25833:21:20:94:543:344:144:Times:144:Times:Per standard ALP practice, we paid panelists $10 per completed module. Beyond that, all but 
10:306:25925:20:21:71:543:324:144:Times:144:Times:one  of  our  elicitations  are unincentivized  on  the  margin  (limited  prospective  memory  being  the  
10:307:26033:21:21:71:544:303:144:Times:144:Times:exception; see Table 1  for details). We made this choice deliberately, based on research  budget  
10:308:26132:21:20:71:540:282:144:Times:144:Times:tradeoffs  between  various  approaches  to  dealing  with  measurement  error  and  identification—
10:309:26232:20:21:71:543:262:144:Times:144:Times:incentives  vs.  sample  size  vs.  measuring  a  broad  set  of  consumer  characteristics  vs.  repeated 
10:310:26339:21:21:71:542:241:144:Times:144:Times:elicitation   over   time—and scrutiny   of   usual   motivations   for   paying   marginal   incentives. 
10:311:26445:21:20:71:543:220:144:Times:144:Times:Researchers often hypothesize that subjects find direct elicitation tasks unpleasant and hence need 
10:312:26545:20:21:71:542:200:144:Times:144:Times:marginal incentives to engage with the tasks, but the ALP measures panelist engagement and finds 
10:313:26642:21:21:71:543:179:144:Times:144:Times:evidence to the contrary.12 Researchers often hypothesize that unincentivized elicitations change 
10:314:26740:21:21:72:543:158:144:Times:144:Times:inferences,  but  that  hypothesis  is  not  robustly  supported empirically (e.g.,  Von  Gaudecker,  Van  
10:315:26847:21:33:71:543:137:144:Times:144:Times:Soest, and Wengström 2011; Gneezy, Imas, and List 2015). In any case, our repeated elicitations 
10:316:26943:33:17:72:543:104:49:g_d0_f4:121:Times:12 For example, each ALP survey ends with “Could you tell us how interesting or uninteresting you found 
10:317:27046:17:13:71:544:87:121:Times:121:Times:the  questions  in  this  interview?”  and  roughly  90%  of  our  sample  replies  that  our  modules  are  “Very  
10:318:27162:13:0:71:482:74:121:Times:121:g_d0_f4:interesting” or “Interesting,” with only 3% replying “Uninteresting” or “Very uninteresting.” 
11:319:27256:0:20:72:542:708:144:Times:144:Times:and measurement error models should suffice to address concerns about noise. Researchers often 
11:320:27351:20:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:assume that marginal incentive mechanisms are the best way to mimic real-world stakes, but this 
11:321:27447:21:21:71:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:is not generally true; given research budget constraints, tasks with hypothetical rewards like ours 
11:322:27546:21:21:72:456:646:144:Times:144:Times:can offer some conceptual advantages (e.g., Montiel Olea and Strzalecki 2014). 
11:323:27625:21:20:94:543:625:144:Times:144:Times:To reduce survey fatigue, we worked with ALP staff to break each round into two separate 
11:324:27714:20:21:72:546:605:144:Times:144:Times:30-minute  surveys (modules,  in  ALP  parlance),  offered about  two  weeks  apart  for  most  
11:325:27810:21:21:71:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:respondents. Respondents had some flexibility in choosing when to take a survey module once it 
11:326:27905:21:20:72:138:563:144:Times:144:Times:was on offer. 
11:327:27919:20:21:94:543:543:144:Times:144:Times:After extensive piloting, the ALP fielded our first two Round 1 instruments (ALP modules 
11:328:28008:21:21:71:543:522:144:Times:144:Times:315  and  352) starting  in  November  2014.  We targeted 1,500  working-age respondents,  sending 
11:329:28107:21:20:71:545:501:144:Times:144:Times:2,103 initial  invitations,  and  ultimately  received  1,515  responses  to  Module  315,  and  1,427  
11:330:28211:20:21:71:542:481:144:Times:144:Times:responses to both 315 and 352. 95% of respondents completing both modules did so by the end of 
11:331:28306:21:21:71:542:460:144:Times:144:Times:February 2015. We then re-administered those same two modules (with some additional questions 
11:332:28400:21:21:71:543:439:144:Times:144:Times:at  the  end,  eliciting  non-cognitive  skills),  seeking  responses  from  the  1,427  panelists  who 
11:333:28504:21:20:72:543:418:144:Times:144:Times:completed both Round 1 modules, beginning in October 2017. Of the 1,427, 1308 remained in the 
11:334:28598:20:21:72:543:398:144:Times:144:Times:ALP at Round 2 inception. Of those 1,308, we received 967 responses to the first module and 845 
11:335:28694:21:27:72:323:377:144:Times:144:Times:responses to both modules (ALP #474 and #472).13  
11:336:28744:27:26:72:302:350:144:Times:144:Times:3. B-   Counts: Behavioral sufficient statistics 
11:337:28791:26:21:94:542:324:144:Times:144:Times:Here we develop our behavioral sufficient statistics.  We define B-counts motivated by Chetty, 
11:338:28886:21:21:71:543:303:144:Times:144:Times:Gabaix and other behavioral models, describe their cross-sectional distributions across panelists, 
11:339:28985:21:26:71:391:282:144:Times:144:Times:and estimate their within-consumer persistence across three years. 
11:340:29052:26:21:71:236:256:144:Times:144:Times:A. Components of the B-count(s) 
11:341:29083:21:21:94:540:235:144:Times:144:Times:Each B-count aggregates information on 2-17 potential sources of behavioral biases, within-
11:342:29174:21:34:71:545:214:144:Times:144:Times:consumer.14 A finite  research  budget  forces tradeoffs  between  the  depth  and  breadth  of  bias  
11:343:29277:34:18:72:543:180:49:Times:121:Times:13 Modules 352 (Round 1 Module 2) and 472 (Round 2 Module 2) also included invitations to complete a 
11:344:29378:18:12:71:543:162:121:Times:121:Times:short  follow-up  survey  the  next  day.  We  use  responses  to  the  invitation  and  actual  next-day behavior to 
11:345:29496:12:8:71:287:150:121:Times:121:Times:measure limited memory, as detailed in Table 1. 
11:346:29543:8:18:72:544:142:49:Times:121:Times:14 In  previous  work,  based  on  just  our  first  round  of  data,  we  referred  to  potential  sources  of  biases  as  
11:347:29668:18:12:71:543:124:121:Times:121:Times:behavioral “factors.” A potential source/factor is e.g.,”money discounting”: we have 17 of these. A bias is 
11:348:29776:12:13:71:543:112:121:Times:121:Times:e.g.,  “present-biased  money  discounting”  or  “future-biased  money  discounting,”  measured  in  a  way  that  
11:349:29891:13:12:71:543:99:121:Times:121:Times:allows for people to be unbiased: we measure 25 biases, with a maximum of 17 per person because our 
11:350:29991:12:13:71:544:87:121:Times:121:Times:elicitations  of  8  of  the  potential  sources  allow  for  mutually  exclusive  bi-directional  biases.  We  use  the  
11:351:30113:13:0:71:326:74:121:Times:121:Times:“potential source” label here to keep the focus on biases.  
12:352:30174:0:20:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:measurements, incentives, and sample size; we prioritized biases that had been linked to financial 
12:353:30273:20:21:72:542:688:144:Times:144:Times:decisions in prior work, and measured with elicitation methods that have been featured recently in 
12:354:30372:21:21:72:544:667:144:Times:144:Times:top journals, are adaptable to an online environment, and could practicably fit into modules that 
12:355:30470:21:21:71:543:646:144:Times:144:Times:would also measure   other decision inputs and outcomes. We do not seek to measure all possible 
12:356:30566:21:20:71:542:625:144:Times:144:Times:biases; rather, our focus is on starting with large set (by the standards of behavioral research), and 
12:357:30669:20:21:71:476:605:144:Times:144:Times:on identifying whether and how that set and subsets can be empirically informative. 
12:358:30753:21:21:94:545:584:144:Times:144:Times:Among  our  17  potential  sources  of  behavioral  biases,  one subset  relates  to  preferences:  
12:359:30853:21:20:71:544:563:144:Times:144:Times:present-biased  discounting  (Read  and  van  Leeuwen  1998;  Andreoni  and  Sprenger  2012),  loss  
12:360:30954:20:21:71:542:543:144:Times:144:Times:aversion (Fehr and Goette 2007), preference for certainty (Callen et al. 2014), ambiguity aversion 
12:361:31053:21:21:71:542:522:144:Times:144:Times:(Dimmock et al. 2016), and choice inconsistency (Choi et al. 2014). Other subsets capture biased 
12:362:31150:21:20:71:542:501:144:Times:144:Times:beliefs, biased perceptions, and behavioral decision rules: three varieties of overconfidence (Moore 
12:363:31251:20:21:71:543:481:144:Times:144:Times:and  Healy  2008),  narrow  bracketing  (Rabin  and  Weizsäcker  2009),  exponential  growth  biases 
12:364:31352:21:21:72:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:(Stango  and  Zinman  2009;  Levy  and Tasoff  2016), statistical fallacies (Dohmen  et  al.  2009;  D.

12:367:31590:20:21:94:542:398:144:Times:144:Times:Table 1 summarizes our 17 potential sources of biases, along with our elicitation methods and 
12:368:31684:21:21:71:543:377:144:Times:144:Times:their  antecedents. Each  bias  is  identified  relative  to  the  classical  benchmark  established  in  prior  
12:369:31796:21:20:72:547:356:144:Times:144:Times:work  (e.g.,  time-consistent  discounting,  consistency  with  the  General  Axiom  of  Revealed  
12:370:31895:20:21:72:544:336:144:Times:144:Times:Preference,  unbiased  beliefs  about  one’s  own  performance,  unbiased  perceptions  of  statistical  
12:371:32000:21:21:72:542:315:144:Times:144:Times:properties,  etc.).  The Data  Appendix Section  1  provides  details  on  each  of  the  17,  including 
12:372:32105:21:20:72:542:294:144:Times:144:Times:granular data descriptions, comparisons of data quality indicators and descriptive statistics to prior 
12:373:32208:20:21:72:544:274:144:Times:144:Times:work, and  discussions  of  prior  theory  and  evidence  linking  each  behavioral  bias  to  consumer

12:376:32392:27:20:94:551:205:144:Times:144:Times:B-   counts  classify  behavioral  biases  simply:  for  each  of  the  17  potential  sources  of  bias  we  
12:377:32502:20:21:72:540:185:144:Times:144:Times:measure, we classify a consumer as displaying a bias (1) or not (0). A B-count simply sums, within-
12:378:32601:21:60:71:546:164:144:Times:144:Times:consumer,  a number  of  biases  exhibited.  This  approach  to  creating  summary  statistics  is  
12:379:32701:60:17:72:544:104:49:Times:121:Times:15 Following  a  common  delineation  in  behavioral  economics,  we  do  not  measure  social  preferences.  See  
12:380:32816:17:13:71:543:87:121:Times:121:Times:Dean and Ortoleva (2018) and Chapman et al. (2018a) for evidence on relationships between behavioral 
12:381:32917:13:0:72:205:74:121:Times:121:Times:biases and social preferences. 
13:382:32949:0:20:72:542:708:144:Times:144:Times:transparent and easy to implement, here and in future work. (We consider alternate, and potentially 
13:383:33049:20:21:72:320:688:144:Times:144:Times:more efficient, approaches in subsequent sections.) 
13:384:33101:21:21:94:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:As discussed in Section 1, one can view a behavioral sufficient statistic as a within-consumer 
13:385:33196:21:21:72:542:646:144:Times:144:Times:aggregation of many different behavioral influences, or as a psychological underpinning for many 
13:386:33293:21:20:72:441:625:144:Times:144:Times:different behavioral biases. Different B-counts nod to these different views.  
13:387:33372:20:21:94:543:605:144:Times:144:Times:Our Full B-count is  a broad Chetty-type aggregation of all 17 of our potential sources of bias. 
13:388:33468:21:21:72:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:Figures 1a and 1b provide the first of many indications that B-counts capture information that is 
13:389:33566:21:20:72:543:563:144:Times:144:Times:largely distinct from classical decision inputs. Figure 1a plots raw, consumer-level variation in the 
13:390:33668:20:21:72:546:543:144:Times:144:Times:“B-proportion”:  the  share  of  our  17  biases  a  consumer  exhibits.  Figure  1b  plots  consumer- level 
13:391:33777:21:21:72:542:522:144:Times:144:Times:residuals from regressing the B-proportion on the complete set of other covariates in our data (see 
13:392:33877:21:20:72:542:501:144:Times:144:Times:Appendix Table 1 for the list). These residuals are rescaled to the mean of the raw B-proportion in 
13:393:33977:20:21:72:539:481:144:Times:144:Times:Figure 1a for comparability. Comparing the figures illustrates how little variation in the Full B-
13:394:34075:21:21:72:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:count  is  explained  by  our  complete  set  of  other  covariates;  although  partialing  out  variation 
13:395:34182:21:21:71:543:439:144:Times:144:Times:explained by other covariates produces a more normal B-count distribution, it does little to reduce 
13:396:34282:21:20:71:499:418:144:Times:144:Times:dispersion (the raw vs. residualized interquartile ranges are [0.56, 0.75] vs. [0.59, 0.74]). 
13:397:34376:20:21:94:544:398:144:Times:144:Times:Our Sparsity  B-counts  aggregate subsets  of  potential  biases motivated  by  the  foundational  
13:398:34475:21:21:71:539:377:144:Times:144:Times:role of the limited attention/memory parameter in Gabaix’s models.16 Our “Narrow Sparsity” B-
13:399:34568:21:20:72:543:356:144:Times:144:Times:count sums only limited attention and limited memory. Besides mapping fairly neatly from theory, 
13:400:34665:20:21:72:542:336:144:Times:144:Times:the Narrow Sparsity B-count has the added benefit of being easy and quick to elicit; this is reflected 
13:401:34768:21:21:72:542:315:144:Times:144:Times:in  the  elicitation  time  statistics  in  Table  2  Column  5  and  discussed  in  Section  7.  The  “Broad 
13:402:34878:21:20:72:543:294:144:Times:144:Times:Sparsity” B-count adds six more biases that can emerge from limited attention/memory in Gabaix’s 
13:403:34975:20:21:71:542:274:144:Times:144:Times:models:  our  two  measures  of  present-biased  discounting  (for  money  and  for  consumption),  and 
13:404:35079:21:21:72:540:253:144:Times:144:Times:our four measures of price misperceptions and statistical biases: exponential growth biases, non-
13:405:35176:21:21:72:382:232:144:Times:144:Times:belief in the law of large numbers, and the gambler’s fallacies.17 
13:406:35242:21:20:94:542:211:144:Times:144:Times:The four price misperception and statistical biases are what we call math biases. They have 
13:407:35334:20:21:72:543:191:144:Times:144:Times:objectively correct  answers,  but  they  do  not  simply measure  math  mistakes or  cognitive  skills, 
13:408:35439:21:28:72:543:170:144:Times:144:Times:because they are tendencies to err in a particular direction. As an example, work on Exponential 
13:409:35536:28:18:72:544:142:49:Times:121:Times:16 Gabaix  describes  limited  attention  as  a  “central,  unifying  theme  for  much  of  behavioral  economics”  
13:410:35652:18:12:71:543:124:121:Times:121:Times:(2019, p. 1). He does not explicitly mention limited memory, but it is implicit: a consumer might fail to 
13:411:35758:12:8:71:358:112:121:Times:121:Times:“consider” an economic variable by forgetting it, and vice versa. 
13:412:35823:8:17:72:542:104:49:Times:121:Times:17 Narrow bracketing also seems very much in the spirit of the Gabaix models, but we do not include it in 
13:413:35929:17:13:71:544:87:121:Times:121:Times:our  Broad  Sparsity  B-count  because  we  could  not  find  any  mention  of  it  in  Gabaix’s  papers.  Several  
13:414:36045:13:0:71:465:74:121:Times:121:Times:untabulated robustness checks suggest that including it would not change our inferences. 
14:415:36135:0:20:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:Growth Bias shows that more people underestimate the effects of compounding than overestimate 
14:416:36229:20:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:it, and that people who underestimate it do so systematically across a range of financial decisions, 
14:417:36330:21:21:72:542:667:144:Times:144:Times:with plausibly welfare-reducing consequences (Stango and Zinman 2009; Levy and Tasoff 2016). 
14:418:36423:21:21:72:543:646:144:Times:144:Times:So, EG biases are not just mathematical mistakes  : they are biases. Limited math/cognitive skills, 
14:419:36523:21:20:72:543:625:144:Times:144:Times:on the other hand, generate mistakes that are non-systematic, mean-zero, and hence less likely to 
14:420:36620:20:21:72:542:605:144:Times:144:Times:push people toward particular decisions (such as less saving and more borrowing) on average. We 
14:421:36716:21:21:72:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:draw the distinction for two reasons. One is to confirm that our non-math biases are empirically 
14:422:36813:21:20:72:543:563:144:Times:144:Times:relevant, and that math biases alone do not drive our observed correlations between B-counts and 
14:423:36910:20:21:72:542:543:144:Times:144:Times:outcomes (Section 5-C). We also conduct a variety of other empirical tests in Sections 5-B and 6 
14:424:37007:21:21:72:543:522:144:Times:144:Times:to  confirm  that  the  math  biases  themselves  are distinct  from  numeracy  and  other math-related 
14:425:37111:21:20:72:154:501:144:Times:144:Times:cognitive skills.  
14:426:37130:20:21:94:543:481:144:Times:144:Times:Each of our 17 behavioral biases has an expected direction emphasized in prior work (Table 
14:427:37221:21:21:72:542:460:144:Times:144:Times:1 Column 3; details in Data Appendix Section 1); e.g., present-bias or underestimating exponential 
14:428:37320:21:21:72:540:439:144:Times:144:Times:growth is expected while future-bias or overestimating EG is not.18 Below we detail how expected-
14:429:37417:21:20:71:543:418:144:Times:144:Times:direction  biases  actually  are  more  prevalent  (Section 3-D),  and  more  strongly  correlated  with 
14:430:37522:20:21:71:367:398:144:Times:144:Times:outcomes (Section 5-C), than non-expected direction biases.  
14:431:37583:21:21:94:543:377:144:Times:144:Times:Our third B-sub-count couplet (besides math vs. non-math, and expected vs. non-expected) is 
14:432:37674:21:20:72:542:356:144:Times:144:Times:preference vs. non-preference B-sub-counts. The latter includes   biases pertaining to beliefs, price 
14:433:37776:20:21:72:547:336:144:Times:144:Times:perceptions,   and   problem-solving   approaches. The   former   includes   our   two   measures   of   
14:434:37881:21:21:72:546:315:144:Times:144:Times:discounting  biases,19 ambiguity  aversion,  loss  aversion/small-stakes  risk  aversion,  our  two  
14:435:37982:21:21:72:543:294:144:Times:144:Times:measures  of  inconsistency  with  GARP  and  dominance  avoidance,  and  preference  for  certainty. 
14:436:38084:21:20:72:543:273:144:Times:144:Times:The mapping from preference biases to welfare implications is less clear than for non-preference 
14:437:38181:20:27:72:419:253:144:Times:144:Times:biases, both theoretically and empirically, as we discuss in Section 5-C. 
14:438:38255:27:27:72:307:226:144:Times:144:Times:C. B-counts are stable within-person, over time 
14:439:38302:27:20:94:539:199:144:Times:144:Times:Table  2  Column  7  reports  estimates  of  B-count  temporal  stability  (correlations)  round-to-
14:440:38402:20:63:71:543:179:144:Times:144:Times:round, within-person over our three-year sample period. Such correlations are important because 
14:441:38498:63:13:72:468:116:49:Times:121:Times:18 Chapman et al. (2018a) also find that expected direction biases are relatively prevalent. 
14:442:38590:13:17:72:543:103:49:Times:121:Times:19 Keeping in mind that discounting is more than time preference per se: it is a reduced-form combination 
14:443:38696:17:0:71:339:86:121:Times:121:Times:of preferences, expectations, and (perceived) rates of return. 
15:444:38760:0:20:72:545:708:144:Times:144:Times:we  use  within-person  stability  in  B-counts  to  deal  with  measurement  error  when  estimating  
15:445:38863:20:21:72:525:688:144:Times:144:Times:correlations between outcomes (measures of experienced utility) and B-counts (Section 4-C).  
15:446:38956:21:21:94:542:667:144:Times:144:Times:The Full B-count has a within-person correlation of 0.44 across the two rounds, which is high 
15:447:39050:21:21:72:543:646:144:Times:144:Times:by psychometric standards; given measurement error, even a measure that captures a stable trait is 
15:448:39149:21:20:72:550:625:144:Times:144:Times:likely to have serial correlation below one.20 Within-sample, the Full B-   count is more stable than 
15:449:39251:20:21:72:543:605:144:Times:144:Times:our measure of patience, has about the same stability as our measures of risk aversion, and is less 
15:450:39351:21:21:72:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:stable than our measures of cognitive skills.21 (It is an open question whether cognitive skills are 
15:451:39452:21:21:71:542:563:144:Times:144:Times:truly more stable (trait-like), and/or just measured more accurately. The latter explanation seems 
15:452:39551:21:20:72:543:542:144:Times:144:Times:quite likely from a “testing” perspective, given that researchers have devoted orders of magnitude 
15:453:39650:20:21:72:544:522:144:Times:144:Times:more  effort  to  refining  measures  of  cognitive  skills  than  to  refining  the  measures  of  behavioral  
15:454:39762:21:21:72:170:501:144:Times:144:Times:biases we use here.) 
15:455:39783:21:20:94:544:480:144:Times:144:Times:The  B-sub-counts  have  estimated round-to-round  within-person  correlations  ranging  from  
15:456:39878:20:21:72:542:460:144:Times:144:Times:0.18 to 0.49 (Table 2 Column 7). Two comparisons between B-sub-count couplets are particularly 
15:457:39973:21:21:71:543:439:144:Times:144:Times:noteworthy. Expected direction biases are more than twice as stable as non-expected ones (0.41 
15:458:40068:21:20:72:543:418:144:Times:144:Times:vs. 0.18), suggesting that expected biases are more trait-like and/or easier to measure accurately. 
15:459:40168:20:21:72:544:398:144:Times:144:Times:And  non-preference  biases  are  more  than  twice  as  stable as  preference  biases (0.49  vs.  0.23),  
15:460:40275:21:21:72:539:377:144:Times:144:Times:despite us devoting more time to measuring preference biases (3 minutes per vs. 1 minute per non-
15:461:40372:21:26:72:154:356:144:Times:144:Times:preference bias). 
15:462:40389:26:27:72:252:330:144:Times:144:Times:D. B-count distributional properties 
15:463:40425:27:21:94:542:303:144:Times:144:Times:Table 2 presents additional descriptive statistics for B-counts within and across our two survey 
15:464:40522:21:21:72:543:282:144:Times:144:Times:rounds. The mean and “share>0” columns address the prevalence of biases, showing whether our 
15:465:40615:21:43:72:543:261:144:Times:144:Times:data  match  theoretical assumptions  of behavioral  sufficient  statistic  models (Section 3-E). The 
15:466:40717:43:18:72:543:218:49:Times:121:Times:20 In the absence of prior work measuring the stability of behavioral summary statistics, the most relevant 
15:467:40825:18:12:71:543:200:121:Times:121:Times:out-of-sample  comparisons  are  studies  of  the  temporal  stability  of  single  behavioral  biases.  Meier  and  
15:468:40942:12:13:71:544:188:121:Times:121:Times:Sprenger  (2015)  finds  a  one-year  within-person  correlation  of  0.36  for  a  short-run  money  discounting  
15:469:41057:13:13:71:543:175:121:Times:121:Times:parameter that is strongly present-biased on average. Chapman et al.  (2018b) finds a 6-month within-person 
15:470:41165:13:12:71:543:162:121:Times:121:Times:correlation of 0.21 for a measure of ambiguity aversion. Chapman et al. (2018a) elicits multiple measures 
15:471:41271:12:13:71:544:150:121:Times:121:Times:(“duplicates”)  of  12  biases  that  are  conceptually  similar  to  ours,  at  a  single  point  in  time,  and  finds  an  
15:472:41397:13:8:71:485:137:121:Times:121:Times:average within-bias, within-person, across-measure correlation of about 0.6 (our calculation). 
15:473:41491:8:17:72:542:129:49:Times:121:Times:21 More specifically, some of the relevant within-person round-to-round correlations in our sample are: 0.30 
15:474:41600:17:13:71:543:112:121:Times:121:Times:for patience, 0.58 for the Dohmen et al. (2010, 2011) measure of risk aversion, 0.32 for the Barsky et al. 
15:475:41707:13:12:71:543:99:121:Times:121:Times:(1997) measure of risk aversion, 0.75 for the number series measure of fluid intelligence, and 0.70 for the 
15:476:41815:12:13:72:548:87:121:Times:121:Times:first principal component of our four cognitive skills test scores. See Section 4-B and Appendix Table 1   for 
15:477:41926:13:0:72:233:74:121:Times:121:Times:details on these variable definitions. 
16:478:41966:0:20:72:542:708:144:Times:144:Times:standard deviations describe cross-consumer heterogeneity; we examine how this heterogeneity is 
16:479:42062:20:21:72:545:688:144:Times:144:Times:conditionally  correlated  with  the  cross-section  of  consumer  outcomes  (experienced  utility)  in  
16:480:42167:21:21:72:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:Section 5. The “median mins survey time” illustrates how long it takes panelists, on average, to 
16:481:42264:21:21:72:543:646:144:Times:144:Times:supply  enough  information  to  calculate  the  B-count  in  question. That  information  is  useful  for  
16:482:42372:21:20:72:542:625:144:Times:144:Times:researchers and practitioners interested in measuring B-counts. Note that our measured survey time 
16:483:42471:20:21:72:544:605:144:Times:144:Times:is  an  upper  bound on  the  true  time  panelists  spend  on  our  elicitations,  because respondents  can  
16:484:42581:21:21:71:520:584:144:Times:144:Times:take breaks that are imperfectly captured by the ALP’s click-to-click measures of time spent. 
16:485:42674:21:20:94:543:563:144:Times:144:Times:Table 2 Panel A describes the Full B-count. The mean panelist exhibits about 10 biases out 
16:486:42765:20:21:71:542:543:144:Times:144:Times:of a maximum 17, whether we use all round 1 data (i.e., panelists who completed both of our round 
16:487:42863:21:21:71:543:522:144:Times:144:Times:1 modules; N=1427), round 1 data only for panelists   who went on to complete round 2 (N=845), 
16:488:42958:21:20:72:543:501:144:Times:144:Times:or round 2 data (N=845). The median, not shown in the table, also equals 10 in each case. Nearly 
16:489:43054:20:21:72:545:481:144:Times:144:Times:everyone  exhibits  at  least  one  bias  (Column  3  shows  100%  with  rounding),  although  no  one  
16:490:43158:21:21:72:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:exhibits the maximum possible 17 (Column 4). The standard deviation is roughly 2 on a mean of 
16:491:43252:21:21:72:544:439:144:Times:144:Times:10,  suggesting  that  consumers  exhibit  multiple  behavioral  biases  even  on  the  low  end  of  the  
16:492:43359:21:20:72:543:418:144:Times:144:Times:distribution. Median survey time for eliciting the full B-count is about 34 minutes (Column 5); we 
16:493:43458:20:21:72:230:398:144:Times:144:Times:focus on this more in Section 7.  
16:494:43492:21:21:94:543:377:144:Times:144:Times:Table 2 Panel B shows that our lower-dimensional Sparsity B-counts are also prevalent. The 
16:495:43583:21:20:72:544:356:144:Times:144:Times:Narrow  Sparsity  B-count  is  above zero  (out  of  a  possible  two  biases)  for  84%  of  our  sample.  
16:496:43691:20:21:72:543:336:144:Times:144:Times:Critically, the Narrow Sparsity B-count only takes about a minute of survey/task time to measure 
16:497:43788:21:21:72:543:315:144:Times:144:Times:(Column 5). That, coupled with its strong conditional correlations with various outcomes (Section 
16:498:43885:21:20:72:542:294:144:Times:144:Times:5), suggests that measuring the Narrow Sparsity B-count could be a valuable and practical addition 
16:499:43984:20:21:71:543:274:144:Times:144:Times:to many studies of consumer decision making. The Broad Sparsity B-count takes on a value greater 
16:500:44081:21:21:71:542:253:144:Times:144:Times:than  or  equal  to  one  for nearly everyone  in  our  sample, with  a  mean  of  roughly  4.2 out  of  a 
16:501:44187:21:26:71:279:232:144:Times:144:Times:maximum possible 8 biases and SD of 1.3. 
16:502:44228:26:21:94:542:206:144:Times:144:Times:Table 2 Panel C describes our three B-sub-count couplets. Expected-direction biases are far 
16:503:44320:21:21:71:543:185:144:Times:144:Times:more  prevalent  than  non-expected  ones:  the  Expected-Direction  B-sub-count mean  is nearly  as  
16:504:44422:21:21:71:543:164:144:Times:144:Times:high as the Full B-count (roughly 8.5, with a SD of about 2) while the Non-expected mean is only 
16:505:44519:21:20:72:544:143:144:Times:144:Times:1.5.  And  while  nearly  everyone  exhibits  multiple  expected-direction  biases,  roughly  15%  our  
16:506:44623:20:21:72:543:123:144:Times:144:Times:sample exhibits  zero non-expected biases (out of a possible 8). Expected-direction biases drive the 
16:507:44724:21:21:72:543:102:144:Times:144:Times:Full B-count, in that the two are correlated 0.87; in contrast, the Non-expected Direction B-count 
16:508:44823:21:0:72:543:81:144:Times:144:Times:correlation  with  the  Full is  only  0.26.  Both  math  and  non-math  biases  are prevalent  and 
17:509:44925:0:20:72:542:708:144:Times:144:Times:heterogeneous,  with  cross-sectional  variation  in  the  Full  B-count  driven  less  by the  Math 
17:510:45025:20:21:71:540:688:144:Times:144:Times:(correlation  0.57)  than  the  Non-math  B-count  (correlation 0.90).  Both  preference  and  non-
17:511:45124:21:21:71:540:667:144:Times:144:Times:preference biases are prevalent and heterogeneous, with non-preference biases driving the Full B-
17:512:45221:21:21:72:545:646:144:Times:144:Times:count more than  preference  biases  (  correlations 0.82  vs.  0.51).  We consider  conceptual  and  
17:513:45323:21:26:71:483:625:144:Times:144:Times:practical differences between behavioral preferences and other biases in Section 5-C. 
17:514:45409:26:21:94:542:599:144:Times:144:Times:Table 2 Panel D suggests that item non-response does not overly complicate interpretation of 
17:515:45502:21:21:72:539:578:144:Times:144:Times:B-count variation. On average, only 1 out of maximum possible 17 biases is missing due to non-
17:516:45596:21:20:72:544:557:144:Times:144:Times:response (Column  1),  with  a  standard  deviation  of  about  1.5. Every  panelist  responds  to  one  or  
17:517:45705:20:21:72:543:537:144:Times:144:Times:more bias questions. Below we control directly for the missing B-count inputs and other measures 
17:518:45802:21:21:72:221:516:144:Times:144:Times:of survey effort (Section 4-A). 
17:519:45834:21:20:94:544:495:144:Times:144:Times:Appendix  Table 2  shows  that  B-count  descriptive  statistics  are  similar  if  we  use  the  ALP  
17:520:45937:20:27:72:165:475:144:Times:144:Times:sampling weights.  
17:521:45956:27:27:72:424:448:144:Times:144:Times:E. Interpreting B-count descriptive statistics: Implications for modeling 
17:522:46028:27:21:94:542:421:144:Times:144:Times:Table  2  speaks  to  various  assumptions  underlying  behavioral  sufficient  statistic  models. 
17:523:46127:21:20:72:542:400:144:Times:144:Times:Behavioral tendencies are more common than rare, as in models with a behavioral representative 
17:524:46222:20:21:72:542:380:144:Times:144:Times:agent a la Gabaix. The “psychological foundations” of the sparsity models (limited attention and 
17:525:46318:21:21:72:544:359:144:Times:144:Times:limited  memory,  summarized  in  our  Narrow  Sparsity  B-count)  are  indeed  prevalent,  as  are  the  
17:526:46424:21:20:72:544:338:144:Times:144:Times:“behavioral phenomena” that can emerge from sparsity models (price misperceptions, statistical 
17:527:46519:20:21:72:543:318:144:Times:144:Times:fallacies,  and  present-biases,  summarized  in  our  Broad  Sparsity  B-count).  Biases  are more 
17:528:46619:21:21:72:544:297:144:Times:144:Times:common in expected than non-expected directions and hence not mean-zero, as required in e.g., 
17:529:46713:21:20:72:331:276:144:Times:144:Times:Allcott and Taubinsky (2015) and the Chetty models. 
17:530:46765:20:21:94:545:256:144:Times:144:Times:Along  with  informing  modeling  assumptions, our  empirical  sufficient  statistics  could  be  
17:531:46863:21:21:72:543:235:144:Times:144:Times:useful for estimating model inputs. B-counts clearly speak to the prevalence of behavioral agents 
17:532:46961:21:20:72:543:214:144:Times:144:Times:(Mullainathan, Schwartzstein, and Congdon 2012), and B-counts and their components could be 
17:533:47053:20:21:72:543:194:144:Times:144:Times:useful for estimating the average marginal bias distribution: the number of behavioral agents on a 
17:534:47152:21:21:72:542:173:144:Times:144:Times:given margin and the extent of their biases. Relatedly, one property not exhibited by our B-counts 
17:535:47251:21:21:72:543:152:144:Times:144:Times:is  the  homogeneity  in  person-level  bias  required  to  use  Chetty,  Looney,  and  Kroft’s  (2009) 
17:536:47355:21:20:72:543:131:144:Times:144:Times:equivalent price metric to identify the average marginal bias distribution used for welfare analysis. 
17:537:47457:20:21:72:545:111:144:Times:144:Times:Allowing  for  heterogeneity  can  considerably  complicate  modeling  policy  welfare  effects  with  
17:538:47560:21:0:72:545:90:144:Times:144:Times:behavioral  sufficient  statistics  (Allcott  and  Taubinsky  2015;  Mullainathan,  Schwartzstein,  and  
18:539:47667:0:20:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:Congdon 2012), and the rest of our paper focuses on understanding that heterogeneity and how 
18:540:47760:20:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:one  can  use  it  to  help  test  what  is  arguably  the  most  fundamental  assumption  of  behavioral 
18:541:47866:21:27:71:511:667:144:Times:144:Times:sufficient statistic models: that behavioral biases, taken together, reduce consumer welfare. 
18:542:47959:27:27:71:494:640:144:Times:144:Times:4. Using B-counts to Model the Wedge Between Decision and Experienced Utility 
18:543:48035:27:20:94:543:613:144:Times:144:Times:B-counts have the summary properties of a behavioral sufficient statistic, so we now ask the 
18:544:48128:20:21:72:544:593:144:Times:144:Times:more  important  question:  can  B-counts help  identify  any  behavioral  wedge  between  decision  
18:545:48229:21:21:72:494:572:144:Times:144:Times:utility and experienced utility? We address this question by formalizing how we map... 
18:546:48316:21:21:216:398:551:144:g_d0_f9:144:Times:(1) 푉푉푖푖퐸퐸(푝푝푖푖,푤푤푖푖)=푉푉푖푖퐷퐷(푝푝푖푖,푤푤푖푖)−푓푓(휃휃푖푖) 
18:547:48363:21:22:72:543:530:144:Times:144:Times:into our data. We pay particular attention to identifying assumptions given measurement error in 
18:548:48460:22:21:72:543:508:144:Times:144:Times:one  or  more  of  its  three objects:  experienced  utility  푉푉푖푖퐸퐸,  decision  utility  푉푉푖푖퐷퐷,  and  any  behavioral  
18:549:48581:21:27:72:220:487:144:Times:144:Times:wedge between the two 푓푓(휃휃푖푖). 
18:550:48613:27:27:72:356:460:144:Times:144:Times:A. Empirical specification: Measuring experienced utility 
18:551:48669:27:22:94:543:433:144:Times:144:Times:Our  approach  to  the  left  hand  side  of  (1)  is  to  consider  individual-level outcomes 푌푌푖푖푎푎 
18:552:48770:22:21:72:543:411:144:Times:144:Times:measuring various  aspects of  experienced  utility  푉푉푖푖퐸퐸,  following Benjamin  et  al.  (2014)  and 
18:553:48873:21:22:72:543:390:144:Times:144:Times:Benjamin et al. (2014). We focus on financial measures here, describe measures of other aspects 
18:554:48969:22:21:72:543:368:144:Times:144:Times:in  Section  5-D,  and  consider  relationships  between  aspects  and  overall  푉푉푖푖퐸퐸 in  Section  4-D. We 
18:555:49077:21:21:72:546:347:144:Times:144:Times:scale all outcomes on the [0,1] interval, with higher values indicating better outcomes (Table 3).22  
18:556:49179:21:21:94:539:326:144:Times:144:Times:Our primary outcome is an index of subjective financial condition—a   financial aspect of 푉푉푖푖퐸퐸—
18:557:49275:21:21:72:542:305:144:Times:144:Times:that averages responses to four sets of questions about retirement savings adequacy, non-retirement 
18:558:49375:21:21:72:542:284:144:Times:144:Times:savings adequacy, overall financial satisfaction, and financial stress.23 The four index components 
18:559:49475:21:20:72:542:263:144:Times:144:Times:correlate strongly  and  positively  with  each  other  (Appendix  Table  3  Panel  B):  the  pairwise 
18:560:49578:20:51:72:386:243:144:Times:144:Times:correlations range from 0.31 to 0.53, each with p-values < 0.001. 
18:561:49644:51:17:72:542:192:49:Times:121:Times:22 Re-scaling provides comparability, and we chose the [0, 1] scale because most of our outcome variables 
18:562:49750:17:13:71:542:175:121:Times:121:Times:are either indicators or summary indexes. We do not standardize, because dividing a variable by its standard 
18:563:49859:13:8:71:506:162:121:Times:121:Times:deviation can introduce additional measurement error (Gillen, Snowberg, and Yariv forthcoming). 
18:564:49955:8:17:72:544:154:49:Times:121:Times:23 We  drew  the  content  and  wording  for  our  financial  condition  questions  from  previous  American  Life  
18:565:50071:17:13:71:542:137:121:Times:121:Times:Panel modules and other surveys (including the National Longitudinal Surveys, the Survey of Consumer 
18:566:50172:13:12:71:542:124:121:Times:121:Times:Finances, the National Survey of American Families, the Survey of Forces, and the World Values Survey). 
18:567:50276:12:13:71:544:112:121:Times:121:Times:Each  of  our  outcomes  is  quick  and  easy  to  measure:  Appendix  Table  3  and  Table  3  show  that  each  
18:568:50390:13:12:71:542:99:121:Times:121:Times:individual/component outcome takes strictly less than a minute to elicit on average, and that even our most 
18:569:50498:12:13:71:543:87:121:Times:121:Times:elaborate  index  has  a  median  elicitation  time  of  only  2.67  minutes.  Further  details  on  outcome  variable  
18:570:50618:13:0:71:385:74:121:Times:121:Times:definitions can be found in the notes to Table 3 and Appendix Table 3. 
19:571:50690:0:20:94:545:708:144:Times:144:Times:We also  measure objective  financial  condition  by averaging  five  indicators:  positive  net  
19:572:50788:20:21:71:542:688:144:Times:144:Times:worth, owning retirement assets, owning stocks, having saved over the past 12 months, and not 
19:573:50882:21:21:71:542:667:144:Times:144:Times:having experienced any of four financial hardship indicators. These index components are strongly 
19:574:50980:21:21:71:543:646:144:Times:144:Times:positively correlated with each other: the range is 0.35 to 0.56 (Appendix Table 3 Panel A). The 
19:575:51077:21:21:71:410:625:144:Times:144:Times:objective index is correlated 0.57 with the subjective index (Table 3).  
19:576:51150:21:21:94:542:604:144:Times:144:Times:Our empirics allow that any 푌푌푖푖푎푎 measures 푉푉푖푖퐸퐸 with error. Putting aside issues with aggregating 
19:577:51251:21:21:71:543:583:144:Times:144:Times:from single aspects to overall experienced utility until Section 4-D, for now we allow a random

19:581:51581:21:21:71:543:498:144:Times:144:Times:non-response.24 Equation (2) allows, e.g., for the possibility that non-response in other variables 
19:582:51681:21:20:72:542:477:144:Times:144:Times:could  be  correlated  with  reported  outcomes,  and/or  that  rushed  or  very  long  response  times  on 
19:583:51789:20:27:72:427:457:144:Times:144:Times:behavioral elicitations could be spuriously linked to reported outcomes.25 
19:584:51863:27:28:71:221:430:144:Times:144:Times:B. Measuring decision utility  
19:585:51893:28:21:94:543:402:144:Times:144:Times:We  specify  decision  utility  푉푉푖푖퐷퐷 following  Chetty’s  (2015) Method  2,  by  constructing  a  rich  
19:586:51999:21:20:71:542:381:144:Times:144:Times:vector of classical decision inputs thought to affect utility in the absence of behavioral biases (see 
19:587:52102:20:21:71:543:361:144:Times:144:Times:also, e.g., Allcott and Taubinsky). The inputs of interest here are (life-cycle) demographics such 
19:588:52201:21:21:71:542:340:144:Times:144:Times:as income, gender, age, education, etc. (Demoi), patience and risk tolerance (Prefi), and cognitive 
19:589:52301:21:21:72:543:319:144:Times:144:Times:and non-cognitive skills (Cogi and NonCogi).  Altogether we measure 20 consumer characteristics 
19:590:52396:21:20:72:545:298:144:Times:144:Times:with  121  variables  (many  of  them  categorical,  see  Appendix  Table  1).26 We  allow  for  the  
19:591:52498:20:36:72:352:278:144:Times:144:Times:possibility that decision utility too is measured with error: 
19:592:52559:36:17:72:544:242:49:Times:121:Times:24 Specifically,  we  measure  respondent  survey  effort  with  three  types  of  variables.  One  is  the  count  of  
19:593:52679:17:12:71:540:225:121:Times:121:Times:missing  inputs  to  our  B-count,  as  described  in  Section  2-D.  The  second  type  is  indicators  for  item  non-
19:594:52799:12:13:71:542:213:121:Times:121:Times:response, for elicitations with non-trivial item non-response rates. In our main analysis sample, these rates 
19:595:52909:13:13:71:543:200:121:Times:121:Times:range from zero for many demographics, to 5% for Stroop. Our third measure of survey effort is based on 
19:596:53013:13:12:71:543:187:121:Times:121:Times:the ALP’s tracking of a panelist’s time spent on each screen. We use decile indicators of survey time spent 
19:597:53121:12:9:71:530:175:121:Times:121:Times:per survey round, either overall across both of our modules, or counting just our behavioral elicitations. 
19:598:53227:9:17:72:544:166:49:Times:121:Times:25 In  untabulated  results,  we  also  have  explored  whether  shorter/longer  survey  times  are  related  to  the  
19:599:53346:17:12:71:542:149:121:Times:121:Times:variance of reported well-being. As an example, we have estimated our models excluding the top and/or 
19:600:53448:12:13:71:543:137:121:Times:121:Times:bottom deciles of survey response time, or by using survey response times as weights. Neither approach 
19:601:53551:13:8:71:249:124:121:Times:121:Times:has a meaningful effect on the findings. 
19:602:53591:8:17:72:542:116:49:Times:121:Times:26 Including such a rich set of classical covariates might over-control if classical covariates are correlated 
19:603:53701:17:13:71:542:99:121:Times:121:Times:with behavioral tendencies, but we show below that in practice our estimated links between B-counts and 
19:604:53805:13:0:71:394:86:121:Times:121:Times:experienced utility are quite robust to the set of covariates (Section 5-B).

20:606:53947:22:21:94:545:685:144:Times:144:Times:We  measure  demographics  using  the  ALP’s  standard  set,  collected  when  a  panelist  first  
20:607:54046:21:21:72:542:664:144:Times:144:Times:registers  and  refreshed  quarterly.  We  measure  the  other  elements  of   푓푓(. ) with  widely-used 
20:608:54149:21:21:72:553:643:144:Times:144:Times:elicitations incorporated     into our     modules. We     measure     presumed-classical     risk     
20:609:54251:21:20:72:544:622:144:Times:144:Times:attitudes/preferences using the adaptive lifetime income gamble task developed by Barsky et al. 
20:610:54347:20:21:72:541:602:144:Times:144:Times:(1997), and the financial risk-taking scale from Dohmen et al. (2010, 2011).27 We measure patience 
20:611:54446:21:21:72:543:581:144:Times:144:Times:using the average savings rate across the 24 choices in our version of the Convex Time Budget 
20:612:54540:21:20:72:543:560:144:Times:144:Times:task  (Andreoni  and  Sprenger  2012).  We  measure  cognitive  skills  using  4  standard  tests for 
20:613:54642:20:21:71:544:540:144:Times:144:Times:general/fluid  intelligence (McArdle,  Fisher,  and  Kadlec  2007),  numeracy  (Banks  and  Oldfield  
20:614:54744:21:21:71:544:519:144:Times:144:Times:2007), financial literacy (crystalized intelligence for financial decision making) per Lusardi and 
20:615:54843:21:21:71:542:498:144:Times:144:Times:Mitchell (2014),   and   executive   function/working   memory (MacLeod   1991).28 Pairwise 
20:616:54935:21:20:72:545:477:144:Times:144:Times:correlations  between  these  four  test  scores  range  from  0.16  to  0.42.  In  our  second  round  of  
20:617:55043:20:21:72:490:457:144:Times:144:Times:surveying we add elicitations of noncognitive skills to the end of our second module.29 
20:618:55130:21:21:94:542:436:144:Times:144:Times:In some specifications, we add the objective financial index to 푓푓(. ). This makes conceptual 
20:619:55224:21:21:71:543:415:144:Times:144:Times:sense if, as is likely the case, financial resources are an important component of the consumer’s

20:621:55426:21:21:72:542:373:144:Times:144:Times:an even more stringent test of the relationship between subjective financial condition and 휃휃푖푖, albeit 
20:622:55530:21:27:72:286:352:144:Times:144:Times:one that errs on the side of over-controlling.

20:624:55656:26:21:94:543:299:144:Times:144:Times:Completing our empirical specification requires a measure of the behavioral sufficient statistic 
20:625:55752:21:22:72:542:278:144:g_d0_f8:144:Times:휃휃푖푖, and a estimator that helps account for measurement error. We measure 휃휃푖푖 using our one or more 
20:626:55854:22:21:71:340:256:144:Times:144:Times:of our B-counts, again allowing for measurement error:

20:628:55932:43:17:72:542:192:49:Times:121:Times:27 These Barsky and Dohmen et al. measures are correlated 0.14 in our main analysis sample. We also elicit 
20:629:56039:17:9:71:472:175:121:Times:121:Times:Dohmen et al.’s general risk taking scale, which is correlated 0.68 with the financial scale. 
20:630:56132:9:12:72:408:166:49:Times:121:Times:28 The Data Appendix Section 2 provides details on each of these measures. 
20:631:56206:12:17:72:542:154:49:Times:121:Times:29 Specifically, we use the validated 10-item version of the Big Five personality trait inventory (Rammstedt 
20:632:56315:17:13:71:543:137:121:Times:121:Times:and John 2007). We initially decided against eliciting non-cognitve skills, given our resource constraints 
20:633:56422:13:13:71:542:124:121:Times:121:Times:and the lack of prior evidence of the correlations between them and behavioral biases (see, e.g., Becker et 
20:634:56530:13:12:71:544:111:121:Times:121:Times:al’s (2012)  review  article)  that  would  be  required  to  confound  our  key  inferences.  But  in  Round  2  we  
20:635:56648:12:13:71:542:99:121:Times:121:Times:decided to err on the side of caution and take some non-cognitive skills measures, after seeing Kuhnen and 
20:636:56755:13:0:71:492:86:121:Times:121:Times:Melzer’s (2018) evidence on correlations between financial outcomes and non-cognitive skills.

21:651:57523:21:22:72:218:565:144:Times:144:Times:structure that we now clarify.  
21:652:57555:22:21:94:544:543:144:Times:144:Times:A  challenge to estimation  is that 휐휐푖푖 can  attenuate 훽훽휃휃,  or  falsely identify such a relationship 
21:653:57658:21:20:72:545:522:144:Times:144:Times:where  none  exists  (Fuller  2009;  Gillen,  Snowberg,  and  Yariv  forthcoming).  We  address  this  
21:654:57761:20:21:72:429:502:144:Times:144:Times:challenge using the repeated measurements across our two survey rounds. 
21:655:57833:21:21:94:542:481:144:Times:144:Times:The   standard approach to dealing with measurement error in a B-count would be to use its 
21:656:57924:21:22:72:542:460:144:Times:144:Times:non-contemporaneous elicitation (Round 2 in the Round 1 model, and vice versa) as an instrument 
21:657:58020:22:21:72:545:438:144:Times:144:Times:for the contemporaneous elicitation. The instrument will lead to an unbiased estimate of 훽훽푖푖휃휃 if  the 
21:658:58124:21:21:72:544:417:144:Times:144:Times:measurement errors in the behavioral sufficient statistic are uncorrelated, i.e. 퐸퐸[휐휐1푖푖휐휐2푖푖] = 0, and 
21:659:58229:21:21:72:375:396:144:Times:144:Times:if in each round 휃휃푖푖,휐휐푖푖,휀휀푖푖, and 휏휏푖푖 are independently distributed.  
21:660:58300:21:21:94:432:375:144:Times:144:Times:Such an approach would yield two “single IV” models for estimation: 
21:661:58367:21:21:123:536:354:144:Times:144:Times:Model Outcome Covariates B-count B-count IV 
21:662:58406:21:21:136:530:333:144:Times:144:Times:1 Round 1 Round 1 Round 1 Round 2 
21:663:58435:21:20:136:530:312:144:Times:144:Times:2 Round 2 Round 2 Round 2 Round 1 
21:664:58464:20:21:94:543:292:144:Times:144:Times:We  go  beyond  the single  IV  approach by  implementing  the  “both-ways”  approach  of 
21:665:58553:21:21:72:543:271:144:Times:144:Times:Obviously  Related  Instrumental  Variables (Gillen,  Snowberg,  and  Yariv  forthcoming).  ORIV 
21:666:58649:21:21:72:545:250:144:Times:144:Times:stacks the  data, using  both  the first elicitation  to  instrument for  the  second  and the  second  
21:667:58753:21:22:72:544:229:144:Times:144:Times:elicitation  to instrument for  the  first.  As  with  the  single  IV  approach,  ORIV  will  produce  an  
21:668:58861:22:21:72:546:207:144:Times:144:Times:unbiased  estimate  of  훽훽푖푖휃휃 if  the  measurement  errors  in  the  behavioral  sufficient  statistic  are  
21:669:58971:21:81:72:206:186:144:Times:144:Times:uncorrelated across rounds. 
21:670:58998:81:14:72:453:105:49:Times:121:Times:30 The Results Appendix discusses several findings consistent with these assumptions. 
21:671:59083:14:0:72:382:91:49:g_d0_f4:121:Times:31 Equation (3) suppresses coefficients on f(.) and g(.) to avoid clutter. 
22:672:59158:0:20:94:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:In our setting we elicit two rounds of data for nearly all outcomes and covariates as well as 
22:673:59252:20:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:for our variables of greatest interest (in our case, those used to construct the B-count). Thus we 
22:674:59351:21:21:72:260:667:144:Times:144:Times:have four “replicates” per Gillen et al.:

22:681:59552:21:21:94:542:521:144:Times:144:Times:We first estimate the model separately for replicates 1 and 2 (“round 1 ORIV”) and compare 
22:682:59643:21:20:71:542:500:144:Times:144:Times:those estimates to those obtained using replicates 3 and 4 (“round 2 ORIV”). We do not reject the 
22:683:59741:20:21:71:542:480:144:Times:144:Times:restriction that the empirical relationships are identical for round 1 ORIV and round 2 ORIV. Thus 
22:684:59840:21:21:71:542:459:144:Times:144:Times:most of our empirics in Section 5 pool the four replicates, clustering standard errors by panelist. 
22:685:59940:21:20:71:544:438:144:Times:144:Times:In  some  specifications  we  also  treat  other covariates  such  as  cognitive skills as  measured  with  
22:686:60048:20:21:71:542:418:144:Times:144:Times:error, and employ ORIV for them as well (i.e., by instrumenting for round 2 covariates with round 
22:687:60146:21:27:71:222:397:144:Times:144:Times:1 covariates, and vice versa).32 
22:688:60178:27:27:72:343:370:144:Times:144:Times:D. Interpretation and non-classical measurement error 
22:689:60231:27:20:94:543:343:144:Times:144:Times:Here we consider some issues of interpretation and some potential sources of non-classical 
22:690:60322:20:21:72:418:323:144:Times:144:Times:measurement error, none of which seems to be problematic in practice.  
22:691:60392:21:21:94:540:302:144:Times:144:Times:We  intend  for  our  outcomes  to  measure  what  Benjamin  et  al.  call  different  aspects—
22:692:60487:21:20:72:543:281:144:Times:144:Times:components—of  overall  well-being  and  hence  experienced  utility.  Our  objective  and  subjective  
22:693:60591:20:21:71:542:261:144:Times:144:Times:financial indexes measure a financial aspect of well-being; in Benjamin et al. (2014) the financial 
22:694:60691:21:21:72:542:240:144:Times:144:Times:aspect has a high weight in terms of overall relative marginal utility (ranking 6th out of 113 aspects 
22:695:60794:21:20:72:140:219:144:Times:144:Times:on their list).  
22:696:60811:20:21:94:544:199:144:Times:144:Times:Interpreting  our  outcomes  as  aspects  of  experienced  utility,  rather  than  total  experienced  
22:697:60914:21:21:72:544:178:144:Times:144:Times:utility,  comes  with  one  cost  and  two  benefits.  The  cost  of  course  is  that  our  estimated  linkages  
22:698:61028:21:21:72:543:157:144:Times:144:Times:between behavioral biases and outcomes are aspect-specific (consumer-aspect level), not holistic 
22:699:61125:21:45:71:543:136:144:Times:144:Times:(consumer-level). The benefits are that identification is easier and more transparent. The “easier” 
22:700:61225:45:17:72:543:91:49:Times:121:Times:32 Here we rely on the fact that our other covariates are also stable within-person over time, as detailed in 
22:701:61335:17:0:71:127:74:121:Times:121:Times:footnote 21. 
23:702:61350:0:20:72:542:708:144:Times:144:Times:piece is that we avoid having to extrapolate from aspect-level to overall experienced utility, as the 
23:703:61452:20:21:72:539:688:144:Times:144:Times:Benjamin et al.  papers warn against. The transparency piece is that we can identify  how  the  B-
23:704:61550:21:21:72:535:667:144:Times:144:Times:count links differently with different aspects of utility (Sections 5-D and the Results Appendix). 
23:705:61649:21:22:94:542:646:144:Times:144:Times:One  potential  problem  is  misspecification  of  an  outcome  index’s  component  weights.  Our 
23:706:61747:22:20:72:543:624:144:Times:144:Times:indexes weight each component equally, which could bias 훽훽휃휃in either direction depending on the

23:708:61944:21:22:72:543:583:144:Times:144:Times:contributions to (weights in) experienced utility. We check this potential confound by examining 
23:709:62040:22:21:72:543:561:144:Times:144:Times:whether 훽훽휃휃differs dramatically across components of the indexes, and find that it does not, at least 
23:710:62143:21:20:71:255:540:144:Times:144:Times:not qualitatively (Results Appendix).  
23:711:62182:20:21:94:543:520:144:Times:144:Times:A second potential issue is omitting an important component of aspect-level well-being from 
23:712:62274:21:21:71:543:499:144:Times:144:Times:an index. This seems unlikely to be a material problem, at least for our financial condition indexes, 
23:713:62376:21:21:71:552:478:144:Times:144:Times:given the breadth of our measures. But    even if there were such an omitted component, it also would 
23:714:62478:21:20:71:542:457:144:Times:144:Times:have to (a) have a high marginal utility weight for that aspect, and (b) have a weaker correlation 
23:715:62577:20:21:72:163:437:144:Times:144:Times:with our B-count.  
23:716:62596:21:21:94:545:416:144:Times:144:Times:A third  potential  problem  would  arise  if  it  were  somehow  easier  for  low-effort  survey  
23:717:62695:21:20:72:543:395:144:Times:144:Times:respondents to indicate worse outcomes than better ones, since it is presumably easier to indicate 
23:718:62794:20:21:72:547:375:144:Times:144:Times:behavioral  tendencies  (thereby  upping  one’s  B-count)  than  classical  ones.  Controlling  for

23:720:62999:21:21:71:542:333:144:Times:144:Times:and B-counts. The survey time variables may over-control, if they reflect behavioral tendencies or 
23:721:63098:21:21:71:542:312:144:Times:144:Times:other characteristics like cognitive ability, but including them is a “better safe than sorry” approach 
23:722:63202:21:20:71:542:291:144:Times:144:Times:and  in  practice  does  not  change  our  inferences  (Section  5-B). Further,  as  the  Data  Appendix 
23:723:63307:20:21:72:545:271:144:Times:144:Times:Section  3 details, our  survey  user-interfaces  do  not  make  it  easier  for  respondents  to  indicate

24:727:63526:20:21:94:544:688:144:Times:144:Times:This  section  presents  and  discusses  estimates  of  equation  (3),  for  the  sample  of  845  ALP  
24:728:63630:21:21:71:421:667:144:Times:144:Times:panelists who completed all four modules across our two survey rounds. 
24:729:63701:21:21:71:287:646:144:Times:144:Times:A. Primary results: B-counts and outcomes 
24:730:63742:21:20:94:543:625:144:Times:144:Times:Table 4 uses our primary, pooled ORIV specification.33 The models here regress objective or 
24:731:63834:20:22:72:544:605:144:Times:144:Times:subjective  financial  condition34 on one  of  our  three  main B-counts35 and  our  complete  set  of  
24:732:63938:22:21:72:543:583:144:Times:144:Times:additional covariates,36 with each column presenting 훽훽휃휃from a single ORIV regression. Columns 
24:733:64034:21:21:72:542:562:144:Times:144:Times:3,  6,  and  9  regress subjective  financial  condition  on  the  same  covariates  and  add  the  objective 
24:734:64144:21:20:72:542:541:144:Times:144:Times:financial condition as an additional covariate; those specifications   allow for financial resources to 
24:735:64248:20:21:72:370:521:144:Times:144:Times:serve as an input to utility, per our discussion in Section 4-B.  
24:736:64314:21:22:94:542:500:144:Times:144:Times:The Full or Sparsity B-count strongly and negatively conditionally correlates with outcomes 
24:737:64406:22:21:72:542:478:144:Times:144:Times:(p-value <0.01) in each of Table 4’s nine specifications, and the economic magnitude of 훽훽휃휃is large 
24:738:64507:21:20:72:543:457:144:Times:144:Times:in every specification. We report marginal effects in the “d(LHS)/d(1 SD B-count)” row, and the 
24:739:64603:20:21:72:543:437:144:Times:144:Times:smallest one of the nine implies a 22% decline in average financial condition associated with a one 
24:740:64703:21:21:72:547:416:144:Times:144:Times:standard deviation increase in a B-count (the -0.119 in Column 4, divided by the LHS mean).  The 
24:741:64800:21:20:72:543:395:144:Times:144:Times:d(LHS)/d(1 SD B-count) row also shows similar magnitudes across the Full and Sparsity B-counts, 
24:742:64896:20:21:72:401:375:144:Times:144:Times:with 8 of the 9 estimated marginal effects within [-0.179, -0.119].37  
24:743:64967:21:21:94:544:354:144:Times:144:Times:In  all,  Table  4  shows  that  B-counts  have  economically  and  statistically  strong  conditional

24:747:65212:17:13:71:542:239:121:Times:121:Times:across rounds. Appendix Table 5 uses Round 2 data only, with Round 1 as instruments (to help address

24:755:65830:9:17:72:542:142:49:Times:121:Times:36 The  additional  covariates  are  defined  in  Appendix  Table  1 and  detailed  in  Sections  4-A  and  4-B. 
24:756:65943:17:12:71:543:125:121:Times:121:Times:Appendix Table 8 displays the estimated correlations for these covariates from the specifications used in

24:759:66210:17:13:71:543:87:121:Times:121:Times:that  the  weighted  coefficients  are  larger  in  point  terms  but  less  precise.  See  the  Results  Appendix  for

25:761:66344:0:27:72:347:708:144:Times:144:Times:B. Results are invariant to the set of covariates/controls 
25:762:66401:27:20:94:543:681:144:Times:144:Times:Table 5 examines robustness to the set of covariates and shows that 훽훽휃휃is nearly invariant to 
25:763:66496:20:21:72:544:661:144:Times:144:Times:the  composition  of  our  rich  set  of controls. These  results  suggest  that  researchers  interested  in  
25:764:66607:21:21:72:543:640:144:Times:144:Times:cross-sectional heterogeneity can economize on measuring other covariates alongside a B-count: 
25:765:66702:21:20:72:543:619:144:Times:144:Times:the overall cost of adding measurement of a behavioral sufficient statistic to a research design can 
25:766:66803:20:22:72:544:599:144:Times:144:Times:be low (Section 7). Moreover, the stability of the B-count coefficient across specifications with 
25:767:66901:22:21:72:542:577:144:Times:144:Times:vastly different controls provides reassurance that 훽훽휃휃captures a behavioral wedge and not omitted 
25:768:67001:21:21:72:386:556:144:Times:144:Times:components of other covariates (Altonji, Elder, and Taber 2005). 
25:769:67066:21:20:94:543:535:144:Times:144:Times:We  consider  27  specifications  in  Table  5,  each  using  the  subjective  financial  index  on  the 
25:770:67170:20:21:72:543:515:144:Times:144:Times:LHS, with a panel per each of our three main B-counts and columns permuting whether and how 
25:771:67262:21:21:72:543:494:144:Times:144:Times:we include other covariates. Column 1 in each panel reproduces our main specification. Column 
25:772:67356:21:20:72:543:473:144:Times:144:Times:2 drops the demographic variables, Column 3 further drops classical preferences, Column 4 drops 
25:773:67452:20:21:72:542:453:144:Times:144:Times:cognitive skills, and Column 5 drops non-cognitive skills. Column 6 drops the survey time spent 
25:774:67548:21:21:72:488:432:144:Times:144:Times:deciles, leaving the count of missing biases as the only covariate besides the B-count.  
25:775:67637:21:20:94:544:411:144:Times:144:Times:The  B-count  estimate  in  each  of  those  more  parsimonious  specifications  is  very  similar  to  
25:776:67741:20:21:72:542:391:144:Times:144:Times:those from our main specification; e.g., for the Full B-count the coefficient is -0.078 (SE 0.009) in 
25:777:67843:21:21:71:543:370:144:Times:144:Times:column 6 vs. -0.084 (SE 0.018) in column 1. (This invariance to other covariates does not hold if 
25:778:67941:21:21:72:546:349:144:Times:144:Times:one fails to account for measurement error in the B-count by, e.g., using OLS instead of ORIV.)38  
25:779:68040:21:20:94:542:328:144:Times:144:Times:Columns 7-9 further address robustness by using ORIV to allow for measurement error in not 
25:780:68131:20:21:72:543:308:144:Times:144:Times:just  the  B-count,  but  also  in  one  or  both  of  two  groups  of  classical  inputs:  presumed-classical 
25:781:68242:21:21:72:546:287:144:Times:144:Times:preferences and cognitive skills.39 These results are similar to those from the other specifications.40  
25:782:68347:21:21:94:542:266:144:Times:144:Times:In all, Table 5 helps solidify the inference that B-   counts capture a distinctly behavioral wedge 
25:783:68447:21:53:71:276:245:144:Times:144:Times:between decision and experienced utility.  
25:784:68490:53:17:72:542:192:49:Times:121:Times:38 E.g., Appendix Table 10 shows that the OLS estimate of the correlation between the subjective financial 
25:785:68597:17:13:71:543:175:121:Times:121:Times:condition index and the Full B-count, using both rounds of data and the full set of covariates, is roughly 
25:786:68704:13:8:71:512:162:121:Times:121:Times:half of that in the most parsimonious OLS speficiation (-0.019 vs. -0.035, each with a SE of 0.003). 
25:787:68804:8:17:72:542:154:49:Times:121:Times:39 Ideally we would allow measurement error in non-cognitive skills as well, but we lack multiple measures 
25:788:68911:17:8:71:354:137:121:Times:121:Times:for personality traits because we did not elicit them in Round 1. 
25:789:68976:8:17:72:543:129:49:Times:121:Times:40 Appendix Table 11 estimates the same 27 specifications with the objective financial condition index as 
25:790:69082:17:13:71:543:112:121:Times:121:Times:the  LHS  variable  instead  of  the  subjective  index,  and  reveals  a  similar  pattern  to  Table  5  with  two  key  
25:791:69205:13:12:71:542:99:121:Times:121:Times:exceptions:  dropping  all  of  the  other  covariates  makes  the  Full  B-count  and  Broad  Sparsity  B-count 
25:792:69317:12:13:71:542:87:121:Times:121:Times:correlations with objective financial condition substantially more negative (i.e., compare Column 6 to the 
25:793:69424:13:0:71:226:74:121:Times:121:Times:other columns in Panels A and B). 
26:794:69459:0:20:72:231:708:144:Times:144:Times:C. Full B-count decompositions 
26:795:69489:20:21:94:542:688:144:Times:144:Times:Table 6 decomposes the Full B-count in three ways shown/discussed earlier (Table 2 Panel C 
26:796:69580:21:21:72:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:and  Section  3-B),  to  shed  light  on  some  nuances  of  identification  and  interpretation. Each 
26:797:69683:21:21:72:543:646:144:Times:144:Times:regression here takes one of our main specifications (Table 4, Columns 1 and 2) and replaces the 
26:798:69780:21:20:72:494:625:144:Times:144:Times:Full B-count with a couplet: with two mutually exclusive and exhaustive B-sub-counts. 
26:799:69866:20:21:94:540:605:144:Times:144:Times:The first two regressions here decompose the Full B-count into the Math-Bias and Non-Math-
26:800:69956:21:21:71:542:584:144:Times:144:Times:Bias  sub-counts.  The  non-math  biases  have  strong  negative  conditional  correlations  with  both 
26:801:70060:21:20:71:542:563:144:Times:144:Times:objective and subjective financial condition, while the point estimates on math biases are close to 
26:802:70160:20:21:71:543:543:144:Times:144:Times:zero (albeit imprecisely estimated).41 These results offer further reassurance that B-counts are not 
26:803:70261:21:21:71:544:522:144:Times:144:Times:“just  math”:  they  capture  something  distinct  from  classical  conceptions/measures of  cognitive  
26:804:70365:21:20:71:164:501:144:Times:144:Times:skills/math ability. 
26:805:70386:20:21:94:542:481:144:Times:144:Times:The  next  two  regressions  decompose  the  Full B-   count  into  expected-  and  non-expected 
26:806:70483:21:21:72:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:directions. Recall that expected-direction biases are those held to be more common/impactful in 
26:807:70579:21:21:72:543:439:144:Times:144:Times:prior  work,  such  as  present-bias,  overconfidence  and underestimating  exponential  growth. The 
26:808:70680:21:20:72:543:418:144:Times:144:Times:expected-direction  B-count  has  strong  negative  conditional  correlations  with both  financial 
26:809:70780:20:21:72:543:398:144:Times:144:Times:condition indexes, with point estimates almost identical to those of the Full B-count in Table 4. 
26:810:70878:21:21:72:543:377:144:Times:144:Times:The Non-expected Direction B-count (future bias, under-confidence, overestimating exponential 
26:811:70972:21:20:72:542:356:144:Times:144:Times:growth, etc.) also has negative and large point estimates, but they are imprecisely estimated. Taken 
26:812:71073:20:21:72:544:336:144:Times:144:Times:together  these results  validate  behavioral  economics’  focus  on  expected  direction  biases,  while  
26:813:71180:21:21:71:544:315:144:Times:144:Times:leaving  unresolved  the  question  of  whether  measures  of  non-expected  direction  biases  capture  
26:814:71285:21:21:71:269:294:144:Times:144:Times:something substantive or merely noise.42 
26:815:71325:21:20:94:543:273:144:Times:144:Times:The last two columns in Table 6 compare Preference vs. Non-preference B-sub-counts. This 
26:816:71414:20:21:72:544:253:144:Times:144:Times:decomposition is  informative  because  the  welfare  implications  of  behavioral  preference  biases  
26:817:71518:21:66:72:544:232:144:Times:144:Times:(loss  aversion,  ambiguity  aversion,  etc.)  are  less  clear  than  for  non-preferences  (biased  price  
26:818:71627:66:17:72:546:166:49:Times:121:Times:41Appendix  Table  12 shows  similar  results  from  dropping  the  cognitive  skills  covariates  and/or  
26:819:71734:17:8:72:394:149:121:Times:121:Times:decomposing the math biases into expected vs. non-expected directions.  
26:820:71805:8:17:72:543:141:49:Times:121:Times:42 How one interprets the Non-expected Bias B-sub-count results is highly contingent on one’s prior: our 
26:821:71910:17:13:71:542:124:121:Times:121:Times:prior was agnostic, and hence our interpretation is that these noisy results tell us little about the economic 
26:822:72021:13:12:71:545:111:121:Times:121:Times:importance  of  non-expected  directional  biases.  But  if  one  had  a  strong  prior  that  non-expected  bias  
26:823:72136:12:13:71:542:99:121:Times:121:Times:measures reflect noise rather than true biases, then these results provide some support for that hypothesis. 
26:824:72245:13:0:71:234:86:121:Times:121:Times:We explore this further in Section 7. 
27:825:72285:0:20:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:perceptions and expectations, limited attention, etc.).43 Consequently the important tests in Table 
27:826:72385:20:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:6 Columns 5 and 6 are on the Non-preference B-sub-count. One would question whether the Full 
27:827:72477:21:21:72:542:667:144:Times:144:Times:B-   count results are truly indicative of consumer welfare losses i f it turned out that only behavioral 
27:828:72583:21:21:72:542:646:144:Times:144:Times:preferences  were  driving  the  negative  conditional  correlation  between  our financial  condition 
27:829:72686:21:20:72:543:625:144:Times:144:Times:measures and the Full B-count. But columns 5 and 6 show that is not the case; the Non-preference 
27:830:72783:20:21:72:507:605:144:Times:144:Times:Bias B-sub-count is strongly negatively correlated with both financial condition indexes.44 
27:831:72874:21:21:94:542:584:144:Times:144:Times:In all, Table 6 helps further solidify the inference that B-counts capture something distinctly 
27:832:72970:21:20:72:433:563:144:Times:144:Times:behavioral—a behavioral wedge between decision and experienced utility. 
27:833:73042:20:27:72:442:543:144:Times:144:Times:D. Other outcomes: Different (and broader) measures of experienced utility 
27:834:73115:27:21:94:543:516:144:Times:144:Times:Table 7 expands the set of outcomes to include additional aspects of experienced utility: life 
27:835:73210:21:20:72:545:495:144:Times:144:Times:satisfaction,  happiness,  and  health  status.  These  aspects,  like  the  financial  aspect,  have  high  
27:836:73319:20:21:72:543:475:144:Times:144:Times:marginal utility rankings per Benjamin et al. (2014): life satisfaction ranks 11th, health ranks 3rd 
27:837:73419:21:21:72:544:454:144:Times:144:Times:and  happiness  ranks  as  high  as  2nd.   In  Column  1  we  also  reproduce  the  Table  4  results  with  
27:838:73529:21:21:72:363:433:144:Times:144:Times:subjective financial condition as the outcome, for reference. 
27:839:73591:21:20:94:544:412:144:Times:144:Times:The  pairwise  correlations  between  our  measures  of  life  satisfaction,  happiness,  and  health  
27:840:73694:20:21:72:543:392:144:Times:144:Times:status range from 0.32 to 0.65 (Appendix Table 3 Panel C; Table 3). Table 3 also shows that these 
27:841:73792:21:21:72:542:371:144:Times:144:Times:measures are strongly positively correlated with our indexes of subjective financial condition (the 
27:842:73892:21:20:72:545:350:144:Times:144:Times:range  is  0.29  to  0.50)  and  objective  financial  condition  (from  0.29  to  0.35).  Except  for  one  
27:843:74001:20:21:72:542:330:144:Times:144:Times:elicitation of life satisfaction, all of these other elicitations come from modules other than ours, in 
27:844:74105:21:21:72:545:309:144:Times:144:Times:periods  roughly  coincident  with  our  study  period.45 Varying  response  rates  across  these  other  
27:845:74211:21:33:72:396:288:144:Times:144:Times:modules produces varying sample sizes across columns in Table 7. 
27:846:74276:33:17:72:542:255:49:Times:121:Times:43 A policymaker has clearer normative grounds for correcting non-preference biases. In contrast, one might 
27:847:74384:17:12:71:543:238:121:Times:121:Times:consider  preferences  inviolate,  even  if  they  are  not  classically  normative.  E.g.,  a  policymaker  may  lack  
27:848:74504:12:13:71:542:226:121:Times:121:Times:grounds for trying to debias someone who is ambiguity averse, but she probably has grounds for trying to 
27:849:74609:13:13:71:544:213:121:Times:121:Times:debias  someone  who  underestimates  the  power  of  the  Law  of  Large  Numbers.  Hewing  closer  to  our  
27:850:74719:13:13:71:542:200:121:Times:121:Times:framework,  the  point  is  simply  that  if  behavioral  preferences  are  truly  preferences,  then  the  preference 
27:851:74838:13:12:71:543:187:121:Times:121:Times:components of 휃휃푖푖 may not drive a wedge between decision utility and experienced utility. Related, if the 
27:852:74944:12:13:72:543:175:121:Times:121:Times:only material behavioral components of decision making were grounded in preferences, one might still rely 
27:853:75050:13:8:72:267:162:121:Times:121:Times:on revealed preference for welfare analysis. 
27:854:75094:8:17:72:541:154:49:Times:121:Times:44 Meanwhile, the Preference Bias B-sub-count has a less robust relationship with financial condition. There 
27:855:75203:17:13:71:541:137:121:Times:121:Times:are various ways to interpret these results, depending on one’s priors. Our view is that the consumer welfare 
27:856:75313:13:8:71:530:124:121:Times:121:Times:consequences of behavioral preferences remains an open question. We explore this further in Section 7. 
27:857:75415:8:17:72:542:116:49:Times:121:Times:45 In deciding which measures to merge in from other modules, we define “study period” as post-our Round 
27:858:75520:17:13:71:543:99:121:Times:121:Times:1 (we could not find any relevant measure post-our Round 2), and select questions that have: a) been used 
27:859:75626:13:0:71:542:86:121:Times:121:Times:in other studies; b) measure highly rated “aspects” of subjective well-being in the marginal utility sense per 
28:860:75739:0:20:94:551:708:144:Times:144:Times:The Full B-count coefficients    in Table 7 Panel A are imprecisely estimated zeroes, while the 
28:861:75835:20:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:Sparsity B-count coefficients are more clearly negative, with all of the eight new point estimates 
28:862:75934:21:21:72:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:in Panels B and C implying marginal effects <-0.04 (on bases of 0.50 to 0.70), and six of them 
28:863:76029:21:21:72:543:646:144:Times:144:Times:having p-values <0.05. For the Sparsity counts, a one standard deviation increase in the B-count 
28:864:76126:21:20:72:545:625:144:Times:144:Times:is  associated  with  life  satisfaction  5-15%  lower  on  the  mean.  For  health  and  happiness,  the  
28:865:76233:20:21:72:542:605:144:Times:144:Times:corresponding  declines  are  roughly  10%  on  the  mean.  For  comparison,  the Broad  Sparsity 
28:866:76331:21:21:72:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:coefficients are roughly the same magnitude as moving down the income distribution by one to 
28:867:76424:21:20:72:464:563:144:Times:144:Times:four deciles (depending on the outcome and position in the income distribution).  
28:868:76506:20:21:94:542:543:144:Times:144:Times:What might explain the pattern here of non-results for the Full B-count coupled with stronger 
28:869:76600:21:21:71:542:522:144:Times:144:Times:results on the Sparsity counts? One explanation is that we chose the full bias collection specifically 
28:870:76703:21:20:71:543:501:144:Times:144:Times:with links to financial decision making/outcomes in mind (as the Data Appendix Section 1 details). 
28:871:76802:20:21:71:542:481:144:Times:144:Times:The Sparsity Biases are motivated somewhat more broadly, although Gabaix too focuses to a great 
28:872:76898:21:21:71:549:460:144:Times:144:Times:extent   on   financial   choices. In   any   case,   further examining   links   between   different   
28:873:77002:21:21:71:543:439:144:Times:144:Times:definitions/conceptions of behavioral summary statistics and different outcome domains (different 
28:874:77100:21:20:71:396:418:144:Times:144:Times:aspects of experienced utility) is a promising line of future inquiry. 
28:875:77171:20:27:71:267:398:144:Times:144:Times:E. Additional results/robustness checks 
28:876:77210:27:21:94:548:371:144:Times:144:Times:The   Appendix  discusses  several  additional  results  and  robustness  checks  mentioned  above 
28:877:77309:21:26:71:333:350:144:Times:144:Times:that require some elaboration (Appendix Tables 4-9).  
28:878:77363:26:21:71:339:324:144:Times:144:Times:F. Summary interpretation of conditional correlations 
28:879:77416:21:21:94:547:303:144:Times:144:Times:Altogether,  the  results  in  Tables  4-7   (and   accompanying   Appendix   Tables)  indicate  
28:880:77513:21:20:71:543:282:144:Times:144:Times:economically large negative conditional correlations between B-counts and various measures of 
28:881:77607:20:21:71:543:262:144:Times:144:Times:outcomes in the financial domain and beyond. These results are consistent with the foundational 
28:882:77703:21:21:71:543:241:144:Times:144:Times:presumption of behavioral sufficient statistic models that behavioral biases, taken together, drive 
28:883:77803:21:20:71:347:220:144:Times:144:Times:a wedge between decision utility and experienced utility. 
28:884:77861:20:27:71:337:200:144:Times:144:Times:6. B-   counts are distinct from other decision inputs 
28:885:77914:27:21:94:544:173:144:Times:144:Times:This  section  ties  together  several  sets  of  results  showing  that  B-counts  capture  something  
28:886:78018:21:21:71:544:152:144:Times:144:Times:about  decision  making  that  is  distinct  from  measures   of  classical  decision  inputs  and  our  other  
28:887:78130:21:44:71:126:131:144:Times:144:Times:covariates. 
28:888:78141:44:13:72:542:87:121:Times:121:Times:Benjamin et al. (2014); c) are answered at least once by at least 2/3 of our sample. See Table 3 and Appendix 
28:889:78251:13:0:72:318:74:121:Times:121:Times:Table 3 for details on the construction of each variable. 
29:890:78310:0:20:94:542:708:144:Times:144:Times:Recapping what we have learned already: 1) B-counts are strongly correlated with outcomes 
29:891:78400:20:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:(measures  of  experienced  utility),  conditional  on  our  rich set  of  additional  covariates;  2)  Those  
29:892:78511:21:21:71:542:667:144:Times:144:Times:correlations are robust to very different specifications of the additional covariates, suggesting that 
29:893:78614:21:21:71:544:646:144:Times:144:Times:any  correlations  between  B-counts  and  other  covariates  do  not  confound  inferences  on  the  link  
29:894:78722:21:20:71:542:625:144:Times:144:Times:between B-counts and decisions/outcomes; 3) Variation in the Full B-count poorly explained by 
29:895:78816:20:21:71:299:605:144:Times:144:Times:our rich set of additional covariates (Figure 1). 
29:896:78866:21:21:94:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:This section expands on the last finding by focusing on the extent to which other covariates 
29:897:78959:21:20:71:542:563:144:Times:144:Times:can explain variation in each of the B-counts we use in the main tables. In addition to rounding out 
29:898:79060:20:21:71:543:543:144:Times:144:Times:our  description  of  B-counts’  statistical  properties  (see  also  Section  3),  this  exercise  adds  to  the  
29:899:79175:21:21:71:543:522:144:Times:144:Times:“Who is (more) behavioral” literature (e.g., D. Benjamin, Brown, and Shapiro 2013), by adding 
29:900:79269:21:20:71:543:501:144:Times:144:Times:evidence on fit to a literature that has focused on correlations, and by adding evidence based on 
29:901:79367:20:21:71:545:481:144:Times:144:Times:consumer-level  metrics  of  behavioral  tendencies  to  a  literature  that  has  considered  behavioral  
29:902:79474:21:21:72:159:460:144:Times:144:Times:biases piecemeal. 
29:903:79491:21:21:94:544:439:144:Times:144:Times:Our analysis in this section uses B-count proportions instead of levels, and OLS instead of 
29:904:79583:21:20:71:544:418:144:Times:144:Times:ORIV.  The  former  specification  choice  accounts  for  missingness  without  overfitting.  The  latter  
29:905:79690:20:21:71:543:398:144:Times:144:Times:estimator choice is motivated by the fact that ORIV does not produce an interpretable fit statistic; 
29:906:79791:21:21:71:543:377:144:Times:144:Times:results above (Table 5, Columns 7-9) offer reassurance that measurement error in the additional 
29:907:79887:21:26:72:324:356:144:Times:144:Times:covariates is unlikely to affect OLS inferences here. 
29:908:79940:26:21:94:544:330:144:Times:144:Times:We  start  here  with  some  simple  univariate  comparisons  further highlighting  the  extent  to  
29:909:80041:21:21:72:544:309:144:Times:144:Times:which B-counts are not simply proxies for other covariates thought to correlate with behavioral 
29:910:80137:21:20:72:543:288:144:Times:144:Times:biases.46 Figures  2a-2d show distributions of our Full  B-count  proportion,  broken out for  paired 
29:911:80238:20:21:72:543:268:144:Times:144:Times:groups  at  the  opposite  ends  of  the  income, risk  aversion,  education,  and cognitive  skills 
29:912:80339:21:21:71:543:247:144:Times:144:Times:distributions. These  do  show  the  expected  level  differences  on  average;  e.g.,  the  B-count 
29:913:80440:21:21:71:542:226:144:Times:144:Times:distribution is shifted somewhat rightward for those in the lowest cognitive skills quartile relative 
29:914:80542:21:20:71:539:205:144:Times:144:Times:to the highest. But also noteworthy is that the B-count varies substantially within each of the sub-
29:915:80642:20:21:72:542:185:144:Times:144:Times:groups we examine. Indeed, within-group variation in the B-count dwarfs cross-group variation, 
29:916:80737:21:60:71:453:164:144:Times:144:Times:even between these four pairs of groups that are very different by construction.

29:919:81050:13:0:71:375:74:121:Times:121:Times:between measures of classical preferences/attitudes and intelligence. 
30:920:81122:0:20:94:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:Table 8 uses OLS to estimate the amount of variation explained by other covariates for each 
30:921:81214:20:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:of our nine B-count proportions. These range from 0.12 for the Narrow Sparsity B-count to 0.40 
30:922:81309:21:21:72:542:667:144:Times:144:Times:for  the  Non-preference  B-count,  with  0.33  for  the  Full  B-count. The  subsequent  rows show 
30:923:81409:21:21:72:549:646:144:Times:144:Times:estimated   partial   R-squareds   for   subsets   of   covariates:   demographics,   cognitive   skills,   
30:924:81517:21:20:72:548:625:144:Times:144:Times:noncognitive   skills   (for   which   we   have   Round   2   data   only),   classical   preferences   (risk   
30:925:81630:20:21:72:543:605:144:Times:144:Times:preferences/attitudes, and patience estimated from our money discounting task), state of residence, 
30:926:81730:21:21:72:544:584:144:Times:144:Times:and the deciles capturing time spent on our behavioral elicitations. Demographics and cognitive 
30:927:81826:21:20:72:539:563:144:Times:144:Times:skills tend  to  explain  the  most  variation,  although  their  fit  varies  widely  across  the different  B-
30:928:81938:20:21:72:542:543:144:Times:144:Times:counts. The demographics’ R-squared ranges from 0.03 for the Preference B-count to 0.24 for the 
30:929:82034:21:21:72:544:522:144:Times:144:Times:Math  and  Non-preference  B-counts.  The  cognitive  skills’  R-squared  ranges  from  0.01  for  the  
30:930:82138:21:20:72:546:501:144:Times:144:Times:Preference  B-count  to  the  0.33  for  the  Non-preference  B-count.  The  other  four  groups  of  
30:931:82240:20:21:72:540:481:144:Times:144:Times:covariates—noncognitive skills, classical preferences, state of residence, and survey time spent—
30:932:82337:21:21:72:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:never explain more than 7% of the variation in a B-count across their 36 estimates (4 groups of 
30:933:82433:21:21:72:543:439:144:Times:144:Times:covariates x 9 B-counts). Particularly striking is that, having adjusted for non-response on the LHS, 
30:934:82535:21:20:72:543:418:144:Times:144:Times:respondent time spent completing our behavioral elicitations explains <=1% of the variation in the 
30:935:82634:20:21:72:544:398:144:Times:144:Times:B-count  proportions. This  is  consistent  with  our  earlier  hypothesis  that  nearly  all  respondents  
30:936:82742:21:21:72:309:377:144:Times:144:Times:seriously engage with our surveys (Section 2-C). 
30:937:82791:21:20:94:546:356:144:Times:144:Times:Comparing  these  fit  estimates  across  the  various  B-counts  reveals  several  additional  
30:938:82887:20:21:71:542:336:144:Times:144:Times:noteworthy patterns. The Sparsity B-counts are relatively poorly explained by our other covariates, 
30:939:82987:21:21:71:544:315:144:Times:144:Times:consistent  with  Sparsity  constructs  capturing  especially  distinct  and  behavioral  influences  on  
30:940:83093:21:20:71:545:294:144:Times:144:Times:decision  making.  Math  biases  are  much  better  explained  by  demographics  (which  include  
30:941:83191:20:21:71:542:274:144:Times:144:Times:education)  and  cognitive  skills  than  non-math  biases,  as  one  would  expect.  Expected-direction 
30:942:83295:21:21:71:542:253:144:Times:144:Times:biases  are  much  better  fit  by  other  covariates  (0.25)  than  non-expected direction  biases  (0.13). 
30:943:83404:21:20:71:543:232:144:Times:144:Times:Coupled  with  the  latter’s  very  imprecisely  estimated  correlations  with  outcomes  (Table  6)  and  
30:944:83511:20:21:71:539:212:144:Times:144:Times:relatively low within-person temporal stability (Table 2), the overall picture is consistent with non-
30:945:83613:21:21:71:542:191:144:Times:144:Times:expected direction biases reflecting more noise than signal. Preference biases (Column 8) are no 
30:946:83710:21:21:71:543:170:144:Times:144:Times:better explained by the other covariates than non-expected direction biases, with only 1/3 of the fit 
30:947:83812:21:20:71:263:149:144:Times:144:Times:of non-preference biases (Column 9).47

30:949:83850:38:17:72:542:91:49:g_d0_f4:121:Times:47 As discussed above, this is not for lack of elicitation intensity: we have roughly three minutes per source 
30:950:83960:17:0:71:370:74:121:Times:121:g_d0_f4:of potential preference bias vs. one minute per non-preference bias.

31:952:84082:26:21:94:548:682:144:Times:144:Times:For   researchers   interested using behavioral   sufficient   statistics—for   welfare   analysis,   
31:953:84184:21:21:72:544:661:144:Times:144:Times:targeting, theory-testing, and/or describing cross-sectional heterogeneity—the practical question 
31:954:84282:21:21:72:543:640:144:Times:144:Times:is how to efficiently capture 휃휃푖푖. Can one do so with a narrower and cheaper set of elicitations than 
31:955:84385:21:27:72:540:619:144:Times:144:Times:our full set? Several of our results thus far suggest yes, yielding three pieces of concrete advice:   
31:956:84488:27:21:90:542:592:144:g_d0_f12:144:Times:• Lower-dimensional  behavioral  sufficient  statistics  are  informative.  The  Narrow  Sparsity 
31:957:84585:21:21:107:551:571:144:Times:144:Times:B-   count is a good example of how theory can guide construction of a sufficient statistic 
31:958:84677:21:21:107:393:550:144:Times:144:Times:based on only two underlying biases (Tables 4, 5, and 7).  48 
31:959:84738:21:21:89:547:529:144:g_d0_f12:144:Times:• Other   covariates   may   not   be   necessary   to   estimate   empirically   stable   conditional   
31:960:84842:21:22:107:483:508:144:Times:144:Times:correlations between outcomes and behavioral sufficient statistics (Table 5).49 
31:961:84921:22:21:90:543:486:144:g_d0_f12:144:Times:• Having at least two sets of plausibly independent behavioral bias elicitations is crucial, as 
31:962:85016:21:20:108:542:465:144:Times:144:Times:multiple elicitations yield results stable enough to obviate the need to elicit and control for 
31:963:85112:20:27:108:389:445:144:Times:144:Times:other covariates (compare Table 5 to Appendix Table 10). 
31:964:85168:27:21:94:542:418:144:Times:144:Times:A further point we establish here is that even a randomly selected subset of our biases can be 
31:965:85263:21:20:72:542:397:144:Times:144:Times:useful. (It is important to keep in mind that a randomly selected subset of our biases is not the same 
31:966:85366:20:21:72:542:377:144:Times:144:Times:as a random sample of the universe of behavioral biases; recall that we chose our full set based on 
31:967:85466:21:21:72:545:356:144:Times:144:Times:prior  work  linking  our  17  biases  to  financial  decision  making.) Figures  3a  and  3b  show  the  
31:968:85572:21:20:72:543:335:144:Times:144:Times:distributions of coefficients and standard errors from lower-dimensional B-counts using  j:[1, 17] 
31:969:85671:20:21:72:543:315:144:Times:144:Times:of potential behavioral biases in our data, where for any j we randomly sample up to 2,500 bias 
31:970:85767:21:21:72:543:294:144:Times:144:Times:combinations, construct a B-count from the potential sources of behavioral bias in that draw, and 
31:971:85865:21:29:72:544:273:144:Times:144:Times:estimate  our  main  ORIV  specification  with  subjective  financial  condition  on  the  LHS  for  that  
31:972:85972:29:18:72:540:244:49:Times:121:Times:48 A  quantitative  if  not  qualitative  caveat  re:  research  budgets  is  that  measuring  the  Narrow  Sparsity  B-
31:973:86092:18:12:71:542:226:121:Times:121:Times:count, and other B-sub-counts including our limited prospective memory elicitation (Table 1), does require 
31:974:86199:12:13:71:542:214:121:Times:121:Times:additional  resources  beyond  the  survey  time  described  in  Table  2:  1)  An  additional,  very  brief,  survey 
31:975:86316:13:13:71:542:201:121:Times:121:Times:module for the follow-up task; 2) A financial incentive to complete the follow-up task. As measuring limited 
31:976:86425:13:12:72:542:188:121:Times:121:Times:prospective memory is in its infancy (at least in broad samples and for economic applications), we would 
31:977:86530:12:13:72:540:176:121:Times:121:Times:not  presume  that  our  elicitation  is  (cost-)efficient:  there  may  be  ways  to  elicit  a  useful  measure  within-
31:978:86652:13:13:72:542:163:121:Times:121:Times:survey, and/or with lower incentive payments per-respondent (e.g, by using a lottery instead of a piece rate). 
31:979:86763:13:12:72:542:150:121:Times:121:Times:Having said that, in our implementation the marginal cost of the limited memory elicitation ended up being 
31:980:86870:12:13:72:543:138:121:Times:121:Times:modest, because only about 15% of the sample actually completes the follow up task. We ended up paying 
31:981:86973:13:8:72:470:125:121:Times:121:Times:about 1427*.15*$10 in Round 1 and 845*.15*$10 in Round 2, for a total of about $3,400. 
31:982:87059:8:17:72:543:117:49:Times:121:Times:49 A weaker recommendation, from the perspective of economizing on measurement of other covariates, is 
31:983:87162:17:14:71:543:100:121:Times:121:Times:that  one  round  of  data  on  them  may  well  be  sufficient  (Table  5,  Column  7-9  suggests  that  one  need  not  
31:984:87284:14:0:71:409:86:121:Times:121:Times:worry about measurement error in other covariates biasing estimates of 훽훽휃휃). 
32:985:87364:0:20:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:draw.50 These figures show that coefficients and standard errors from B-counts based on small j 
32:986:87460:20:21:72:542:688:144:Times:144:Times:converge fairly quickly to what we obtain with j=17, with especially large gains in precision from 
32:987:87559:21:21:72:218:667:144:Times:144:Times:measuring at least two biases. 
32:988:87590:21:21:94:542:646:144:Times:144:Times:There  is,  of  course,  much  more  work  to  be  done  to  derive  truly  optimized  measurement 
32:989:87689:21:20:72:540:625:144:Times:144:Times:dirategies and research designs for behavioral sufficient statistics. To take one example, while B-
32:990:87788:20:21:71:546:605:144:Times:144:Times:counts  are  simple  by  design,  model  selection  techniques  could  increase  power  by  guiding  
32:991:87889:21:21:71:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:definitional, functional form, and other specification choices. (Having said that, such techniques 
32:992:87988:21:20:71:541:563:144:Times:144:Times:would need to account for measurement error, and we are not aware of any that do.) To take another 
32:993:88087:20:21:71:542:543:144:Times:144:Times:example, while repeated elicitations of a behavioral sufficient statistics are critical for dealing with 
32:994:88192:21:21:71:544:522:144:Times:144:Times:measurement  error,  it  remains  to  be  determined  which  combination  of  timing  and  elicitation  
32:995:88296:21:20:71:545:501:144:Times:144:Times:methods  produces the  most  accurate  and/or  cost-effective  measures.  More broadly,  efficient  
32:996:88396:20:21:71:541:481:144:Times:144:Times:measurement requires consideration of tradeoffs between multiple margins of costly measurement, 
32:997:88492:21:27:71:230:460:144:Times:144:Times:as we discuss in the Conclusion. 
32:998:88524:27:21:71:149:433:144:Times:144:Times:8. Conclusion 
32:999:88537:21:20:94:544:412:144:Times:144:Times:An  ardent  classical  economist  might  argue  that  behavioral  tendencies  are  a  collection  of  
32:1000:88639:20:21:71:544:392:144:Times:144:Times:theoretically incoherent  and/or empirically innocuous  deviations  from  classical  rationality.  An  
32:1001:88742:21:21:71:539:371:144:Times:144:Times:ardent  behavioral  economist  might  argue  that  behavioral  biases  are  important,  but  so  multi-
32:1002:88845:21:20:71:542:350:144:Times:144:Times:dimensional in how they affect decisions and welfare that a single consumer-level parameter could 
32:1003:88943:20:21:71:542:330:144:Times:144:Times:not hope to summarize them usefully. While strange bedfellows, they might agree that seeking to 
32:1004:89038:21:21:71:405:309:144:Times:144:Times:measure and model a behavioral sufficient statistic is a fool’s errand. 
32:1005:89110:21:20:94:542:288:144:Times:144:Times:We conclude here, alternatively and with others such as Chetty and Gabaix, that behavioral 
32:1006:89201:20:21:71:547:268:144:Times:144:Times:economics   can   advance   by   capturing   cross-consumer   heterogeneity   in   overall   behavioral   
32:1007:89307:21:21:71:542:247:144:Times:144:Times:tendencies using a single sufficient statistic parameter. Specifically, we construct consumer-level 
32:1008:89406:21:20:71:543:226:144:Times:144:Times:behavioral sufficient statistics—B-counts—by aggregating information, within-person, across as 
32:1009:89501:20:21:71:544:206:144:Times:144:Times:many  as  17  and  as  few  as  2  potential  sources  of  behavioral  biases. We  measure biases  using  
32:1010:89607:21:21:71:542:185:144:Times:144:Times:streamlined, portable, and low-cost elicitations, and so our sufficient statistics are easy to measure, 
32:1011:89711:21:60:71:203:164:144:Times:144:Times:construct, and understand.  
32:1012:89739:60:17:72:543:104:49:Times:121:Times:50 As j gets closer to 2 or 17, the number of possible combinations falls below 2,500—sampling 16 of our 
32:1013:89844:17:13:71:543:87:121:Times:121:Times:17 potential sources of bias can have only 17 possible combinations, for example, as can sampling only 
32:1014:89947:13:0:71:436:74:121:Times:121:Times:one. Drawing 8 or 9 has 24,310 possibilities, the max, from which we draw 2,500. 
33:1015:90029:0:20:94:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:Our B-counts have distributional properties required for behavioral sufficient statistics to be 
33:1016:90125:20:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:useful for various applications, are strongly conditionally correlated with various outcomes, and 
33:1017:90223:21:21:72:542:667:144:Times:144:Times:are quite distinct empirically from measures of classical decision inputs and other covariates. One 
33:1018:90323:21:21:72:544:646:144:Times:144:Times:need  not  measure  our  full  set  of  17  potential  behavioral  biases  to  produce  a  valid  and  powerful  
33:1019:90436:21:20:72:543:625:144:Times:144:Times:behavioral sufficient statistic, and indeed it seems that measuring 2 suffices, at least when guided 
33:1020:90537:20:21:72:543:605:144:Times:144:Times:by theory as we are with our Narrow Sparsity B-count. Most fundamentally, our framework and 
33:1021:90629:21:21:72:544:584:144:Times:144:Times:results  suggest  that  one  can  use  directly  measured  sufficient  statistics  like  B-counts  to  identify  
33:1022:90742:21:20:71:542:563:144:Times:144:Times:consumer welfare loss associated with multiple, reinforcing behavioral biases, and that the welfare 
33:1023:90842:20:21:71:548:543:144:Times:144:Times:loss—the   behavioral   wedge   between   decision   and   experienced   utility—is   substantial   in   
33:1024:90947:21:21:71:128:522:144:Times:144:Times:magnitude. 
33:1025:90958:21:20:94:542:501:144:Times:144:Times:We close by highlighting some opportunities for future research using our data and methods, 
33:1026:91050:20:21:72:544:481:144:Times:144:Times:by  way  of  acknowledging  some  limitations  of  our  work  here. Our  results  linking  B-counts  to  
33:1027:91155:21:21:71:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:outcomes are probably better qualitative than quantitative estimates of the total consumer welfare 
33:1028:91254:21:21:71:543:439:144:Times:144:Times:loss  from  behavioral  biases,  given  aggregation  issues  with  both  utility  proxies  and  biases  that 
33:1029:91363:21:20:72:543:418:144:Times:144:Times:remain to be sorted out. Consumer welfare loss is more clearly due to non-preference biases than 
33:1030:91460:20:21:72:543:398:144:Times:144:Times:preference ones, in our results as well as in theory, highlighting the need for more work on how to 
33:1031:91560:21:21:72:544:377:144:Times:144:Times:evaluate  the  welfare  consequences  of  behavioral  preferences.  Consumer  welfare  loss  may  not  
33:1032:91663:21:20:72:543:356:144:Times:144:Times:equal social welfare loss, as behavioral biases can create opportunities for efficiency gains when 
33:1033:91762:20:21:72:544:336:144:Times:144:Times:there  are  market  failures  or  redistributive  motives  (see  Rees-Jones  and  Taubinsky  2018  for  a  
33:1034:91869:21:21:72:542:315:144:Times:144:Times:review), highlighting the need for more comprehensive welfare analysis. We use (partial) temporal 
33:1035:91967:21:20:72:541:294:144:Times:144:Times:stability in B-counts methodologically without addressing important substantive issues of how and 
33:1036:92065:20:21:72:542:274:144:Times:144:Times:why stability is incomplete: are behavioral sufficient statistics not fully trait-like, or is it more the 
33:1037:92171:21:21:72:542:253:144:Times:144:Times:case that summarizing behavioral tendencies is difficult to do with complete accuracy, or best done 
33:1038:92271:21:20:72:258:232:144:Times:144:Times:with reference to state-dependencies?  
33:1039:92310:20:21:94:543:212:144:Times:144:Times:Relatedly, our initial guidance on efficient measurement highlights that more work is needed 
33:1040:92403:21:21:72:548:191:144:Times:144:Times:to optimize   the  mapping  from  a  given  set  of  elicitation  data  into  a  sufficient  statistic,  and  on 
33:1041:92516:21:21:72:544:170:144:Times:144:Times:elicitation design.  Progress  on  the  former  may  require  further  development  of  model  selection  
33:1042:92622:21:20:71:545:149:144:Times:144:Times:techniques  that  allow  for  measurement  error.  Progress  on  the  latter  can  be  achieved  with  
33:1043:92725:20:21:71:542:129:144:Times:144:Times:experimentation. Although our elicitations are largely unincentivized on the margin—we elected 
33:1044:92820:21:21:72:544:108:144:Times:144:Times:to  allocate  more  of  our  scarce  research  budget  to  measuring  more  variables  for  a  larger  sample  
33:1045:92931:21:0:72:542:87:144:Times:144:Times:size—one might obtain better power by trading off sample size and/or the number of biases elicited 
34:1046:93032:0:20:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:for marginal incentives on a smaller number of elicitations. These tradeoffs are worth exploring, 
34:1047:93130:20:21:72:540:688:144:Times:144:Times:especially given the informativeness of B-counts that are based on elicitations of only a handful—
34:1048:93228:21:21:72:376:667:144:Times:144:Times:or even as few as two—potential sources of behavioral biases.  
34:1049:93291:21:21:94:542:646:144:Times:144:Times:Our main takeaway for future work is that measuring a behavioral sufficient statistic can be a 
34:1050:93386:21:20:72:550:625:144:Times:144:Times:valuable  and  practical  addition  to  many  research  designs   concerned  with  consumer  decision  
34:1051:93489:20:0:72:214:605:144:Times:144:Times:making and its implications.

45:1445:116386:247:14:68:943:263:122:Times:122:Times:We lack timings data on happiness and health status questions because they do not appear in our modules, and so we estimate the time required to elicit these measures, roughly, based on questions of 
45:1446:116585:14:0:68:261:249:122:Times:122:Times:similar length and difficulty in our modules.
45:1447:116630:0:14:68:913:320:122:Times:122:Times:Happiness is measured by taking the within-panelist average of responses to two standard questions on happiness in general and in the last 30 days. These are asked in five other ALP modules 
45:1448:116820:14:0:68:906:306:122:Times:122:Times:subsequent to our Round 1 modules, with 787 of our 845 panelists completing at least one of these happiness questions and 397 completing both the 30-day version and the in-general-version.
45:1449:117008:0:14:68:951:363:122:Times:122:Times:Life satisfaction is measured using one of three minor variants on the standard "... how satisfied are you with your life as a whole these days?" asked in many surveys worldwide. For the other-module 
45:1450:117208:14:14:68:940:349:122:Times:122:Times:measure, we take the within-panelist average of non-missing responses to this question across the six ALP modules in which it has appeared subsequent to our round 1 modules, as of this writing. Of 
45:1451:117405:14:44:68:434:335:122:Times:122:Times:the 809/845 panelists with at least one non-missing response, 640 have at least two.
45:1452:117489:44:14:68:945:291:122:Times:122:Times:Health status is from the standard question: “Would you say your health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?”. We take the within-panelist average across eight different modules in which this 
45:1453:117690:14:0:68:715:277:122:Times:122:Times:question has appeared subsequent to our Round 1 modules. Of the 840/845 panelists completing at least one of these, 780 complete more than one.

45:1460:117944:198:14:68:946:495:122:Times:122:Times:Unit of observation is the individual respondent, with multiple observations per respondent averaged across survey rounds (for variables in our modules) or across other ALP modules (for variables we 
45:1461:118143:14:14:68:950:481:122:Times:122:Times:merge in from other ALP modules). Other ALP modules used here are all administered between our survey rounds; we could not find relevant data collected in modules adminstered after or during our 
45:1462:118338:14:14:68:930:467:122:Times:122:Times:second round. As in most of our main tables, we limit the sample frame here to panelists who completed both of our survey rounds (N=845). Correlations estimated using the two-step "polychoric"

45:1464:118550:18:14:68:932:435:122:Times:122:Times:Variable definitions: Each variable is scaled so that higher values indicate better financial condition and/or subjective well-being. Each measure here is scaled or rescaled to [0, 1] for comparability. 
45:1465:118753:14:15:68:652:421:122:Times:122:Times:Indexes simply take the unweighted mean of non-missing index components. See Appendix Table 3 for details on index components.
45:1466:118879:15:14:68:951:406:122:Times:122:Times:Objective financial condition index is comprised of indicators of postive net worth, positive retirement assets, holding equities, having a positive savings rate over the prior 12 months, and not having 
45:1467:119082:14:14:68:301:392:122:Times:122:Times:severe financial hardship during the prior 12 months.
45:1468:119135:14:0:68:861:378:122:Times:122:Times:Subjective financial condition index is comprised of measures of financial satisfaction, retirement savings adequacy, non-retirement savings adequacy, and lack of financial stress.

51:1580:126390:26:21:94:542:682:144:Times:144:Times:Appendix Table 4 confirms that the data warrant pooling. Each column presents an estimate 
51:1581:126480:21:21:71:544:661:144:Times:144:Times:of  a  B-count  coefficient  for  either  Round  1  ORIV  (odd-numbered  columns)  or  Round  2  ORIV

51:1584:126790:21:27:72:463:599:144:Times:144:Times:similar across rounds, and do not reject equality at conventional p-value cutoffs.  
51:1585:126874:27:20:94:543:572:144:Times:144:Times:Appendix Table 5 is one of several ways we address the possibility of spurious correlation. 
51:1586:126966:20:21:72:542:552:144:Times:144:Times:Here we focus on a reverse causality interpretation of our main results, through which having lower 
51:1587:127066:21:21:72:542:531:144:Times:144:Times:financial resources produces behavioral biases.51 We consider this hypothesis by varying our main 
51:1588:127164:21:21:72:543:510:144:Times:144:Times:specification in two ways. One way is using Round 2 data only and instrumenting for the Round 
51:1589:127258:21:20:72:543:489:144:Times:144:Times:2 B-count with the Round 1 B-count. That “Standard IV” approach uses only the 3-year-earlier 
51:1590:127351:20:21:72:542:469:144:Times:144:Times:measurements  of  behavioral  biases  to  identify  the  correlation  between  our  three  main  B-counts 
51:1591:127457:21:21:72:545:448:144:Times:144:Times:and  experienced  utility  (Columns  1,  4,  and  7).  The  second  way  is  conditioning  on  objective  
51:1592:127563:21:21:72:543:427:144:Times:144:Times:financial condition while using the subjective financial index as our experienced utility measure 
51:1593:127661:21:20:72:544:406:144:Times:144:Times:(as we do in Table 4); that may err on the side of over-controlling, but allows us to address the 
51:1594:127759:20:21:72:543:386:144:Times:144:Times:possibility that (objectively) low financial resources produce behavioral tendencies by controlling 
51:1595:127859:21:21:72:542:365:144:Times:144:Times:for the former (Columns 2, 5, and 8).52 Granting that possibility, we then instrument for Round 2 
51:1596:127957:21:20:71:543:344:144:Times:144:Times:objective financial condition with Round 1 objective financial condition in Columns 3, 6, and 9. 
51:1597:128054:20:21:71:542:324:144:Times:144:Times:The B-count conditional correlation with experienced utility remains strongly negative in each of 
51:1598:128151:21:21:71:524:303:144:Times:144:Times:these nine specifications, suggesting that our main results are not driven by reverse causality.  
51:1599:128248:21:21:94:539:282:144:Times:144:Times:Re: other spurious correlation hypotheses, we refer the reader back to Table 5 and Section 4-
51:1600:128341:21:20:71:544:261:144:Times:144:Times:D.   The  former  addresses  the  standard  omitted-variable,  unobserved  heterogeneity  concern  by  
51:1601:128444:20:21:71:543:241:144:Times:144:Times:varying control variable specifications. The latter details how our survey design and controls for 
51:1602:128543:21:21:71:543:220:144:Times:144:Times:survey  effort  minimize  the  likelihood  of  spurious  correlations  between  outcome  measures  and 
51:1603:128646:21:70:71:201:199:144:Times:144:Times:behavioral bias measures.  
51:1604:128673:70:17:72:542:129:48:Times:122:Times:51 We say “interpretation” instead of “concern” here, because if reverse causality were to drive the results, 
51:1605:128783:17:9:72:542:112:122:Times:122:Times:that would be important to discover in the sense that it would motivate a revamp of most behavioral models. 
51:1606:128891:9:16:72:542:103:48:Times:122:Times:52 We use “produce” instead of “exacerbate” here intentionally, to highlight another benefit of relying on 
51:1607:128998:16:13:72:545:87:122:Times:122:Times:discrete  measures  of  behavioral  biases:  in  our  setup  it  would  need  to  be  the  case  the  worse  financial  
51:1608:129118:13:0:72:497:74:122:Times:122:Times:condition increases the likelihood that people indicate any deviation from classical benchmarks. 
52:1609:129216:0:20:94:544:708:144:Times:144:Times:Appendix  Table 6  decomposes  the  subjective  and  objective  indexes  into  their  components,  
52:1610:129315:20:21:72:545:688:144:Times:144:Times:and  shows  that  links  between  B-counts  and  different  outcomes  are  robustly  negative  for  the  
52:1611:129420:21:21:72:539:667:144:Times:144:Times:component outcomes: all 27 coefficients are negative, 17 of the 27 B-count coefficients have p-
52:1612:129515:21:20:72:543:646:144:Times:144:Times:values <0.01, and each implies an economically large marginal change in the outcome variable per

52:1614:129723:21:21:72:551:605:144:Times:144:Times:heterogeneity,  however,  including  within-index.  E.g.,  the  Full  B-c ount  coefficients  on  the  
52:1615:129826:21:20:72:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:subjective financial condition index components (each of which have p-values<0.01) range from

52:1617:129960:27:21:94:543:537:144:Times:144:Times:Appendix Table 7 confirms robustness to other functional forms for the B-count: the natural 
52:1618:130052:21:21:72:543:516:144:Times:144:Times:logarithm of the B-count, the ratio of the panelist’s B-count to their count of non-missing sources

52:1626:130813:21:20:72:544:350:144:Times:144:Times:sub-groups.  Subject  to  the  caveat  that  these  tests  are  under-powered,  these  results  support  the  
52:1627:130923:20:21:72:543:330:144:Times:144:Times:assumption of a separable behavioral wedge (Section 4-C ). They also fail to support a knife-edge 
52:1628:131021:21:21:72:542:309:144:Times:144:Times:interpretation of our results in which a narrow subset of panelists drives the results. And they cast 
52:1629:131123:21:20:72:546:288:144:Times:144:Times:doubt  on  the  efficacy  of  targeting  behavioral  consumers  based  on  more  readily  observable  
52:1630:131225:20:51:72:243:268:144:Times:144:Times:characteristics (see also Section 7). 
52:1631:131262:51:17:72:542:217:48:Times:122:Times:53 Some of our bias measures are continuous, permitting percentiles to take on the full range of values from 
52:1632:131371:17:12:72:542:200:122:Times:122:Times:1 to 100. For discrete-response and uni-directional outcomes like loss aversion, the B–tiles take on fewer 
52:1633:131478:12:13:71:543:188:122:Times:122:Times:values but still measure the degree of deviation from classical benchmarks in useful ways. For example, 
52:1634:131582:13:13:71:543:175:122:Times:122:Times:loss  aversion  takes  on  four  values:  unbiased,  and  then  three  ordered  responses  (whether  the  individual  
52:1635:131700:13:12:71:543:162:122:Times:122:Times:respondent rejects the compound but not the single lottery, rejects the single but not the compound lottery, 
52:1636:131809:12:13:71:542:150:122:Times:122:Times:or rejects both) coded as 1/2/3. Any respondent accepting both lotteries receives a 0 (meets the classical 
52:1637:131916:13:12:71:543:137:122:Times:122:Times:benchmark),  and  37%  of  individuals  share  that  response.  Anyone  with  the  smallest  deviation  from  the  
52:1638:132031:12:13:71:541:125:122:Times:122:Times:benchmark therefore is in the 37th percentile, and 13% of responses fall into that category. Summing, anyone 
52:1639:132140:13:13:72:543:112:122:Times:122:Times:in  the  next  category  is  in  the  50th(=37th+13th),  and  so  on.  The  B-tile  calculates  each  person’s  percentile  
52:1640:132264:13:12:71:542:99:122:Times:122:Times:ranking for each of the 17 potential sources of behavioral bias, relative to others in the sample, and sums 
52:1641:132372:12:13:71:540:87:122:Times:122:Times:them.  If a person were to be the most biased person in the sample on all 17, that person would have a B-
52:1642:132477:13:0:71:160:74:122:Times:122:Times:tile of (close to) 17. 
53:1643:132502:0:20:94:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:Appendix Table 8 shows the full set of coefficients on the covariates in specifications (1)-(3) 
53:1644:132598:20:21:72:542:688:144:Times:144:Times:in Table 4. The table sheds light on the conditional correlations of other variables with outcomes, 
53:1645:132698:21:21:72:545:667:144:Times:144:Times:which  are  intuitive  for  the  most  part.  Income  is  positively  correlated  with  objective  financial  
53:1646:132808:21:20:72:543:646:144:Times:144:Times:condition  and,  consistent  with  research  on  happiness,  more  weakly  so with  subjective  financial  
53:1647:132915:20:21:72:542:626:144:Times:144:Times:well-being,  and  (weakly)  negatively  once  we  control  for  objective  financial  condition.  Other 
53:1648:133019:21:21:72:546:605:144:Times:144:Times:coefficients  in  the  first  and  second  columns  reverse  once  we  control  for  objective  financial  
53:1649:133126:21:20:72:545:584:144:Times:144:Times:condition  in  column  3,  showing  its  power  as  a  control  and  highlighting  the  robustness  of  the  
53:1650:133235:20:21:72:542:564:144:Times:144:Times:correlation between the B-count and financial condition in relative as well as absolute terms. These 
53:1651:133336:21:21:72:543:543:144:Times:144:Times:columns also highlight the relative magnitude of the coefficient on the B-count (subject to caveats 
53:1652:133436:21:21:72:543:522:144:Times:144:Times:re: over-controlling). E.g., for the objective financial condition outcome, a one-SD increase in the 
53:1653:133537:21:20:72:543:501:144:Times:144:Times:B-   count has roughly  the  same implied correlation as moving down two or three income deciles. 
53:1654:133635:20:21:72:547:481:144:Times:144:Times:For  subjective  financial  condition,  the  most  noteworthy  pattern  is  that  the  B-count,  and  
53:1655:133737:21:21:72:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:missingness thereon, have correlations that are more robust to the inclusion of objective financial 
53:1656:133837:21:20:72:543:439:144:Times:144:Times:condition as an additional covariate than any other variable or group of variables, with the possible 
53:1657:133939:20:27:72:247:419:144:Times:144:Times:exception of survey response times. 
53:1658:133975:27:21:94:543:392:144:Times:144:Times:Appendix  Table  9 examines whether  using  the  ALP’s  sampling  weights  changes  our  main  
53:1659:134070:21:20:72:542:371:144:Times:144:Times:empirical results (see Appendix Table 2 for a similar exercise re: B-count descriptive statistics). 
53:1660:134170:20:21:72:542:351:144:Times:144:Times:AT 9 compares weighted estimates to our main unweighted ones from Table 4 and reveals that the 
53:1661:134265:21:21:72:542:330:144:Times:144:Times:weighted  coefficients  are  uniformly more  negative  (i.e.,  larger  in  an  economic  sense)  in  point 
53:1662:134372:21:21:72:542:309:144:Times:144:Times:terms, but less precise (e.g., while each of the six unweighted coefficients has a p-value<0.01, two 
53:1663:134473:21:20:72:542:288:144:Times:144:Times:of the weighted coefficients has p-value <0.01 and one has a p>0.10). Mechanically, it must be the 
53:1664:134572:20:21:72:543:268:144:Times:144:Times:case that panelists who are under-sampled by RAND (and therefore over-weighted) have noisier 
53:1665:134665:21:21:72:542:247:144:Times:144:Times:relationships  between  our  outcomes and  covariates.  Re:  external  validity,  the  glass  half-empty 
53:1666:134770:21:20:71:545:226:144:Times:144:Times:interpretation  of  these  results  and  our  setup  is  that  ALP  sampling  weights  produce  noisier  
53:1667:134875:20:21:71:543:206:144:Times:144:Times:inferences on behavioral summary statistics and, in any case, are based on demographics but not 
53:1668:134971:21:21:71:543:185:144:Times:144:Times:our  variables  of  greatest  interest;  therefore,  the  extent  to  which  our  inferences  our  valid  for  the  
53:1669:135087:21:20:71:543:164:144:Times:144:Times:entire  U.S.  population  is  an  open  question.  The  glass  half-full  interpretation  is  that  we  have  an  
53:1670:135201:20:21:71:543:144:144:Times:144:Times:unusually broad sample compared to most studies in the behavioral social sciences, and that our 
53:1671:135297:21:21:71:544:123:144:Times:144:Times:results  on  B-count  properties  and  their  conditional  correlations  with  outcomes  are  not  unduly  
53:1672:135404:21:21:71:510:102:144:Times:144:Times:sensitive to weighting that is designed to produce valid inferences for the U.S. population.

56:1791:141132:619:13:87:1145:260:121:Times:121:Times:Retirement and non-retirement savings adequacy questions are placed one each in the two different modules, with different wording, to mitigate mechanical correlations. The questions are: "Using any number from one to five, where one 
56:1792:141365:13:14:87:1164:247:121:Times:121:Times:equals not nearly enough, and five equals much more than enough, do you feel that your household is saving and investing enough for retirement? Please consider the income you and any other members of your household expect to receive from 
56:1793:141603:14:14:87:1160:233:121:Times:121:Times:Social Security, 401(k) accounts, other job retirement accounts and job pensions, and any additional assets you or other members of your household have or expect to have" and "Now, apart from retirement savings, please think about how your 
56:1794:141843:14:13:87:1158:219:121:Times:121:Times:household typically uses the money you have: how much is spent and how much is saved or invested. Now choose which statement best describes your household". These questions are variants on standard ones, but in each case our 5 response 
56:1795:142079:13:14:87:1126:206:121:Times:121:Times:options are framed to encourage people to recognize tradeoffs between saving and consumption: any response that includes "saving more" also includes "and borrowing/spending less", and vice versa. In mapping the 5 responses into the 
56:1796:142311:14:29:87:1145:192:121:Times:121:Times:variables used here, we code: saved-enough, more-than-enough, and much-more-than-enough as 1 (the latter two responses are rare: 3% of the sample for retirement, and 4% for non-retirement); saved < enough as 0.5; saved << enough as 0.
56:1797:142545:29:13:87:1166:163:121:Times:121:Times:Life satisfaction question is measured using some one of three minor variants on the standard "... how satisfied are you with your life as a whole these days?" asked in many surveys worldwide. For the other-module measure, we take the within-

56:1806:144096:32:13:87:1152:432:121:Times:121:Times:Net worth is from two summary questions drawn from the National Longitudinal Surveys: "Please think about all of your household assets (including but not limited to investments, other accounts, any house/property you own, cars, etc.) and 
56:1807:144334:13:14:87:1112:419:121:Times:121:Times:all of your household debts (including but not limited to mortgages, car loans, student loans, what you currently owe on credit cards, etc.) Are your household assets worth more than your household debts?" and "You stated that your

56:1809:144660:15:14:87:1154:390:121:Times:121:Times:Retirement assets is from questions asking specifically whether someone has one or more IRA accounts and one or more workplace plans, followed in each case by questions on amounts in such accounts. Questions like these are asked in the 
56:1810:144896:14:15:87:482:376:121:Times:121:Times:Survey of Consumer Finances, the Health and Retirement Study, and many other surveys.
56:1811:144981:15:14:87:1153:361:121:Times:121:Times:Stockholding is from questions on stock mutual funds in IRAs, stock mutual funds in 401ks/other retirement accounts, and direct holdings. Questions like these are asked in the Survey of Consumer Finances, the Health and Retirement Study, 
56:1812:145219:14:14:87:194:347:121:Times:121:Times:and many other surveys.

56:1814:145473:13:15:87:1109:320:121:Times:121:Times:spending less than income. If the total amount of debt you owe increased, then count yourself as spending more than income." Response options are: "Spent more than income", "Spent same as income", and "Spent less than income".

67:2179:163212:29:29:72:497:651:144:Times:144:Times:This section details, for each of the 17 potential sources of behavioral bias we measure:  
67:2180:163302:29:21:90:544:622:144:Times:144:Times:i) The  motive   for eliciting  that potential  source  of  bias  (B-   factor)  and the  mechanism  
67:2181:163402:21:20:126:411:601:144:Times:144:Times:through which that factor might affect financial condition;  
67:2182:163462:20:21:90:354:581:144:Times:144:Times:ii) our elicitation method and its key antecedents;

67:2184:163573:21:20:90:396:539:144:Times:144:Times:iv) sample size (as it compares to that for other B-factors);  
67:2185:163635:20:21:90:543:519:144:Times:144:Times:v) definitions and prevalence estimates of behavioral indicators, with background on the

67:2190:164028:21:29:126:316:415:144:Times:144:Times:parameters used in behavioral models;  
67:2191:164067:29:20:72:543:386:144:Times:144:Times:Since  our  empirical  work  here  is  purely  descriptive,  we  focus  on  our Round  1  data  (ALP 
67:2192:164168:20:21:72:543:366:144:Times:144:Times:modules 315 and 352) to get the largest possible sample of panelists. We provide comparisons to 
67:2193:164264:21:29:72:219:345:144:Times:144:Times:prior work wherever possible. 
67:2194:164294:29:20:72:316:316:144:Times:144:Times:A. Present- or future-biased discounting (money) 
67:2195:164342:20:21:72:544:296:144:Times:144:Times:Time-inconsistent discounting has been linked, both theoretically and empirically, to low levels 
67:2196:164439:21:21:71:542:275:144:Times:144:Times:of saving and high levels of borrowing (e.g., Laibson 1997; Meier and Sprenger 2010; Toubia et 
67:2197:164534:21:20:71:120:254:144:Times:144:Times:al. 2013). 
67:2198:164545:20:21:89:545:234:144:Times:144:Times:We  measure  discounting  biases  with  respect  to  money  using  the  Convex  Time  Budgets  
67:2199:164640:21:21:71:543:213:144:Times:144:Times:(CTB) method created by Andreoni and Sprenger (2012). In our version, fielded in ALP module 
67:2200:164732:21:20:72:542:192:144:Times:144:Times:315 (the first of our two surveys), subjects make 24 decisions, allocating 100 hypothetical tokens 
67:2201:164831:20:21:72:542:172:144:Times:144:Times:each between (weakly) smaller-sooner and larger-later amounts. See Data Appendix Figure 1 for 
67:2202:164925:21:21:72:543:151:144:Times:144:Times:an example.  The 24 decisions are spread across 4 different screens with 6 decisions each. Each 
67:2203:165021:21:21:72:543:130:144:Times:144:Times:screen varies start date (today or 5 weeks from today) x delay length (5 weeks or 9 weeks); each 
67:2204:165118:21:20:72:545:109:144:Times:144:Times:decision  within  a  screen  offers  a  different  yield  on  saving.  Among  the  1,515  individuals  who  
67:2205:165226:20:0:72:543:89:144:Times:144:Times:take  our  first  module  in  Round  1,  1,502 subjects  make  at  least  one  CTB  choice,  and the  1,422 
68:2206:165336:0:20:72:544:708:144:Times:144:Times:who  complete  at  least  the  first  and  last  decisions  on  each  of  the  4  screens  comprise  our  CTB  
68:2207:165447:20:21:72:112:688:144:Times:144:Times:sample. 
68:2208:165455:21:21:90:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:The CTB already has been implemented successfully in field contexts in the U.S. (Barcellos 
68:2209:165546:21:21:72:544:646:144:Times:144:Times:and  Carvalho  2014;  Carvalho,  Meier,  and  Wang  2016)  and  elsewhere  (Giné    et  al.  2018).  In  
68:2210:165651:21:20:72:543:625:144:Times:144:Times:exploring data quality and prevalence below we focus on comparisons to Andreoni and Sprenger 
68:2211:165744:20:21:72:545:605:144:Times:144:Times:(2012), and  Barcellos  and  Carvalho  (2014).1  AS  draw  their  sample  from  university  students.  
68:2212:165847:21:21:72:546:584:144:Times:144:Times:BC’s  sample  is  drawn  from  the  ALP,  like  ours  (module  212  in  their  case),  but  they  use  a  
68:2213:165953:21:21:72:229:563:144:Times:144:Times:different adaptation of the CTB. 
68:2214:165986:21:20:90:543:542:144:Times:144:Times:Indicators of response quality are encouraging for the most part. Interior allocations are more 
68:2215:166082:20:21:72:544:522:144:Times:144:Times:common  in  our  sample  than  in  AS,  and  comparable  to  BC.  More  of  our  subjects  exhibit  some  
68:2216:166188:21:21:72:542:501:144:Times:144:Times:variance in their allocations than AS or BC. Our subjects are internally consistent overall—e.g., 
68:2217:166286:21:20:72:543:480:144:Times:144:Times:exhibiting  strong  correlations  in  choices  across  different  screens  and  delay  dates—but  41%  do 
68:2218:166392:20:21:72:544:460:144:Times:144:Times:exhibit  some  upward-sloping  demand  among  20  pairs  of  decisions,  a  figure  that  is  within  the  
68:2219:166499:21:21:72:505:439:144:Times:144:Times:range commonly found in discount rate elicitations but high compared to the 8% in AS.2   
68:2220:166588:21:21:90:545:418:144:Times:144:Times:We  calculate  biased  discounting,  for  each  individual,  by  subtracting  the  consumption  rate

68:2223:166901:20:21:72:545:356:144:Times:144:Times:differences  to  get  a  continuous  measure  of  biased  discounting.  In  keeping  with  AS,  BC  and

68:2225:167105:21:20:72:544:314:144:Times:144:Times:(2017)), we find little if any present-bias on average, with a median discount bias of zero, and a 
68:2226:167204:20:29:72:238:294:144:Times:144:Times:1pp mean tilt toward future bias.3

68:2228:167340:21:21:71:542:244:144:Times:144:Times:biased (future-biased) if the average difference is >0 (<0). We deem present-bias the “standard” 
68:2229:167437:21:31:71:539:223:144:Times:144:Times:direction,  since  future-bias  is  relatively  poorly  understood.4  Counting any  deviation  from  time-

68:2233:167811:17:12:71:543:150:121:Times:121:Times:Sprenger  (2012)  report  rates  ranging  from  10  to  50  percent  in  their  literature  review.  In  Barcellos  and  
68:2234:167932:12:13:71:543:138:121:Times:121:Times:Carvalho 26% of subjects exhibit some upward-sloping demand, among only 4 pairs of decisions. In our 
68:2235:168033:13:13:71:546:125:121:Times:121:Times:sample  non-monotonic  demand  is  strongly  correlated  within-subject  across  the  four  screens,  and  
68:2236:168140:13:9:71:519:112:121:Times:121:Times:decreases slightly by the final screen, suggesting that responses are picking up something systematic. 
68:2237:168243:9:16:72:522:103:42:g_d0_f51:121:Times:3 Bradford et al. (2017) do find present-bias on average in their Qualtrics sample, classifying >50% as 
68:2238:168347:16:9:71:255:87:121:Times:121:Times:present-biased and 26% as future-biased. 
68:2239:168387:9:0:72:442:78:42:g_d0_f51:121:Times:4 Although see Koszegi and Szeidl (2013) for a theory of future-biased discounting. 
69:2240:168472:0:20:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:consistent discounting as biased, 26% of our sample is present-biased and 36% is future-biased. 
69:2241:168568:20:21:71:542:688:144:Times:144:Times:These prevalence estimates fall substantially if we set    a higher threshold for classifying someone 
69:2242:168670:21:21:71:540:667:144:Times:144:Times:as behavioral; e.g., if we count only deviations > |20|pp, then only 3% of the sample is present-
69:2243:168767:21:21:71:544:646:144:Times:144:Times:biased  and  5%  future-biased.  Compared  to  prior  prevalence  estimates,  our  zero-threshold  ones  
69:2244:168872:21:20:71:543:625:144:Times:144:Times:are in the middle of the range (Data Appendix Table 1). E.g., BC’s CTB elicitation in the ALP 
69:2245:168966:20:21:71:544:605:144:Times:144:Times:shows  29%  with  any  present-bias,  and  37%  with  any  future-bias.  Goda et  al.  use  a  different  
69:2246:169072:21:21:71:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:elicitation method—a “time-staircase” multiple price list (Falk et al. 2016)—and classify 55% of 
69:2247:169169:21:20:71:543:563:144:Times:144:Times:their nationally representative sample (from the ALP and another online panel) as present-biased. 
69:2248:169267:20:29:71:426:543:144:Times:144:Times:In the AS sample 14% exhibit any present-bias and 12% any future-bias.  
69:2249:169339:29:21:89:542:514:144:Times:144:Times:Interestingly, if we follow AS and use the CTB data to structurally estimate discounting-bias 
69:2250:169433:21:20:71:544:493:144:Times:144:Times:parameter  values  for  each  individual,  we  find  that  90%  of  our  subjects  with  no  monotonicity  
69:2251:169540:20:21:71:544:473:144:Times:144:Times:violations lie within the interval [0.93, 1.07] (Data Appendix Table 1, Columns 11-13).5 This is 
69:2252:169637:21:21:72:546:452:144:Times:144:Times:noteworthy  because  behavioral  macro  papers  sometimes  assume  representative  agents  with  
69:2253:169734:21:21:72:542:431:144:Times:144:g_d0_f52:present bias that lies strictly below our 5th percentile (see, e.g., (İmrohoroğlu, İmrohoroğlu, and 
69:2254:169834:21:21:71:543:410:144:Times:144:Times:Joines 2003; Graham and Snower 2013; Pérez Kakabadse and Palacios Huerta 2013). As Harris 
69:2255:169924:21:20:71:544:389:144:Times:144:Times:and Laibson (2013) state: “the short-run discount factor... is typically thought to lie between ½ 
69:2256:170022:20:21:71:515:369:144:Times:144:Times:and 1.” Our estimates should give researchers pause before choosing a value much below 1. 
69:2257:170112:21:21:89:543:348:144:Times:144:Times:Previous  studies estimate relationships  between  directly  elicited  discounting  biases  and 
69:2258:170208:21:20:71:542:327:144:Times:144:Times:outcomes  in  broad  samples  (Bradford  et  al.  2017;  Eisenhauer  and  Ventura  2006;  Goda  et  al. 
69:2259:170312:20:21:71:542:307:144:Times:144:Times:2017).6  We  use CTBs  rather  than  Multiple  Price  Lists,  test  more  flexible  functional  forms,  and 
69:2260:170420:21:21:72:543:286:144:Times:144:Times:control for  a  much  richer  set  of  (behavioral)  factors  that  could  be  correlated  with  both

69:2263:170597:29:21:90:542:215:144:Times:144:Times:In   light   of   evidence   that   discounting   can   differ   within-subject   across   domains   (e.g., 
69:2264:170705:21:20:72:546:194:144:Times:144:Times:Augenblick,  Niederle,  and  Sprenger  2015),  we  also  obtain  a  coarse  measure  of  discounting  
69:2265:170807:20:32:72:545:174:144:Times:144:Times:biases  for  consumption  per  se,  by  asking  two  questions  that  follow  Read  and  van  Leeuwen  
69:2266:170910:32:13:72:470:142:42:g_d0_f51:121:Times:5 The 5th to 95th percentile interval AS’ sample is [0.91, 1.11], as reported in their Table 3. 
69:2267:171005:13:17:72:537:129:42:g_d0_f51:121:Times:6 Other papers have explored links between discounting biases and field behavior using direct elicitations 
69:2268:171112:17:12:71:540:112:121:Times:121:Times:on narrower samples, with narrower sets of covariates; see e.g., Chabris et al. (2008), Meier and Sprenger 
69:2269:171219:12:10:71:287:100:121:Times:121:Times:(2010), Burks et al. (2012), and  Li et al. (2015). 
69:2270:171271:10:16:72:541:90:42:g_d0_f51:121:Times:7 Other key differences include Bradford et al. (2017) lacking controls for cognitive skills, and Eisenhauer 
69:2271:171380:16:0:71:287:74:121:Times:121:Times:and Ventura (2006) only controlling for income.

70:2273:171538:20:21:71:542:688:144:Times:144:Times:[right now/five weeks from now]. One snack is more delicious but less healthy, while the other is 
70:2274:171636:21:21:71:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:healthier  but  less  delicious.  Which  would  you  rather  have  [right  now/five  weeks  from  now]:  a  
70:2275:171744:21:21:71:544:646:144:Times:144:Times:delicious  snack  that  is  not  good  for  your  health,  or  a  snack  that  is  less  delicious  but  good  for  
70:2276:171860:21:28:71:419:625:144:Times:144:Times:your health? We fielded these questions in our second Round1 module. 
70:2277:171929:28:21:89:543:597:144:Times:144:Times:Of the 1427 persons taking our second survey, 1423 answer one of the two snack questions, 
70:2278:172019:21:21:71:543:576:144:Times:144:Times:and 1404 respond to both. 61% choose the healthy snack for today, while 68% choose it for five 
70:2279:172114:21:20:71:542:555:144:Times:144:Times:weeks in the future, with 15% exhibiting present bias (consume treat today, plan to eat healthy in 
70:2280:172213:20:21:71:543:535:144:Times:144:Times:the future) and 7% future bias (consume healthy today, plan to eat treat in the future).8 Barcellos 
70:2281:172313:21:21:72:545:514:144:Times:144:Times:and  Carvalho’s  ALP  subjects  answered  similar  questions  in  their  baseline  survey,  albeit  with  
70:2282:172419:21:21:72:539:493:144:Times:144:Times:only  a  one-week  instead  of  a  five-week  delay,  with  6%  exhibiting  present-bias  and  9%  future-
70:2283:172525:21:20:72:543:472:144:Times:144:Times:bias. Read and van Leeuwen (1998) offer actual snacks to a convenience sample of employees in 
70:2284:172619:20:21:72:545:452:144:Times:144:Times:Amsterdam  but  do  not  calculate  individual-level  measures  of  bias.  They  do  find  substantial  
70:2285:172723:21:21:71:543:431:144:Times:144:Times:present-bias  on  average.  We  do  not  know  of  any  prior  work  estimating  correlations  between 
70:2286:172825:21:29:72:386:410:144:Times:144:Times:measures of consumption discounting biases and field outcomes.

70:2288:172971:28:21:89:545:353:144:Times:144:Times:Our  third  and  fourth  behavioral  factors  follow  Choi  et  al.  (2014),  which  measures  choice  
70:2289:173074:21:21:71:547:332:144:Times:144:Times:inconsistency   with   standard   economic   rationality.   Choice   inconsistency   could indicate   a   
70:2290:173180:21:20:72:543:311:144:Times:144:Times:tendency  to  make  poor  (costly)  decisions  in  field  contexts;  indeed,  Choi  et  al.  (2014)  find  that  
70:2291:173293:20:21:71:542:291:144:Times:144:Times:more choice inconsistency is conditionally correlated with less wealth in a representative sample 
70:2292:173391:21:29:71:179:270:144:Times:144:Times:of Dutch households.  
70:2293:173413:29:20:89:544:241:144:Times:144:Times:We  use  the  same  task  and  user  interface  as  in  Choi  et  al.  (2014) but  abbreviate  it  from  25  
70:2294:173522:20:22:71:543:221:144:Times:144:Times:decisions to 11.9 Each decision confronts respondents with a linear budget constraint under risk: 
70:2295:173620:22:20:71:543:199:144:Times:144:Times:subjects choose a point on the line, and then the computer randomly chooses whether to pay the 
70:2296:173715:20:25:71:542:179:144:Times:144:Times:point value of the x-axis or the y-axis. 1,270 of the 1,427 individuals taking our second Round 1 
70:2297:173813:25:17:72:540:154:42:g_d0_f51:121:Times:8  If  we  limit  the  sample  to  those  who  did  not  receive  the  informational/debiasing  treatment  about  self-
70:2298:173932:17:12:71:542:137:121:Times:121:Times:control in ALP module 212 (Barcellos and Carvalho), we find 15% with present bias and 8% with future 
70:2299:174033:12:9:71:136:125:121:Times:121:Times:bias (N=748). 
70:2300:174046:9:17:72:543:116:42:g_d0_f51:121:Times:9 We were quite constrained on survey time and hence conducted a pilot in which we tested the feasibility 
70:2301:174152:17:12:72:542:99:121:Times:121:Times:of capturing roughly equivalent information with fewer rounds. 58 pilot-testers completed 25 rounds, and 
70:2302:174257:12:13:72:545:87:121:Times:121:Times:we  estimated  the  correlation  between  measures  of  choice  inconsistency  calculated  using  the  full  25  
70:2303:174370:13:0:72:509:74:121:Times:121:Times:rounds, and just the first 11 rounds. These correlations are 0.62 and 0.88 for the two key measures. 
71:2304:174472:0:21:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:module make  all  11  decisions,  and  comprise  our  sample  for  measuring  choice  inconsistency.10 
71:2305:174574:21:28:72:290:687:144:Times:144:Times:See Data Appendix Figure 2 for an example. 
71:2306:174617:28:21:90:543:659:144:Times:144:Times:Following Choi et al., we average across these 11 decisions, within-consumer, to benchmark 
71:2307:174708:21:21:72:547:638:144:Times:144:Times:choices  against  two  different  standards  of  rationality.  One  benchmark  is  a  complete  and  
71:2308:174809:21:21:72:544:617:144:Times:144:Times:transitive  preference  ordering  adhering  to  the  General  Axiom  of  Revealed  Preference  (GARP),  
71:2309:174913:21:20:72:543:596:144:Times:144:Times:as captured by the Afriat (1972) Critical Cost Efficiency Index. 1-CCEI can be interpreted as the 
71:2310:175011:20:21:71:544:576:144:Times:144:Times:subject’s  degree  of  choice  inconsistency:  the  percentage  points  of  potential  earnings  “wasted”  
71:2311:175118:21:21:71:542:555:144:Times:144:Times:per the GARP standard. But as Choi et al. discuss, consistency with GARP is not necessarily the 
71:2312:175214:21:20:71:542:534:144:Times:144:Times:most appealing measure of decision quality because it allows for violations of monotonicity with 
71:2313:175311:20:21:71:543:514:144:Times:144:Times:respect  to  first-order  stochastic  dominance  (FOSD).11  Hence,  again  following  Choi  et  al.,  our 
71:2314:175417:21:21:72:546:493:144:Times:144:Times:second measure captures inconsistency with both GARP and FOSD.12   Note that these measures 
71:2315:175509:21:29:72:479:472:144:Times:144:Times:of inconsistency are unidirectional: there is no such thing as being overly consistent. 
71:2316:175596:29:21:90:543:443:144:Times:144:Times:Our distribution of individual-level CCEI estimates is nearly identical to Choi et al.’s— if we 
71:2317:175692:21:21:72:544:422:144:Times:144:Times:use only the first 11 rounds of choices from Choi et al. to maximize comparability to our setup. 
71:2318:175789:21:20:72:543:401:144:Times:144:Times:Our median (1-CCEI) is 0.002, suggesting nearly complete consistency with GARP. The mean is 
71:2319:175880:20:21:72:543:381:144:Times:144:Times:0.05. The median (1-combined-CCEI), capturing FOSD violations as well, is 0.10, with a mean 
71:2320:175972:21:21:72:543:360:144:Times:144:Times:of  0.16.  C hoice  inconsistency  is  substantially  higher  when  using  the  full  25  rounds  in  both  our  
71:2321:176085:21:20:72:544:339:144:Times:144:Times:pilot  data  and  Choi  et  al.  ( e.g.,  mean  CCEI  of  0.12  in  both  samples),  and  we  have  verified  that  
71:2322:176201:20:21:72:545:319:144:Times:144:Times:this  is  a  mechanical  effect  (more  rounds  means  more  opportunities  to  exhibit  inconsistency)  
71:2323:176306:21:21:72:543:298:144:Times:144:Times:rather than deterioration in consistency as rounds increase, by finding that CCEIs measured over 
71:2324:176403:21:20:72:542:277:144:Times:144:Times:small blocks of consecutive rounds remain constant as the average round number of those blocks 
71:2325:176498:20:29:71:121:257:144:Times:144:Times:increases. 
71:2326:176508:29:21:89:542:228:144:Times:144:Times:Data Appendix Table 1 shows that our prevalence estimates are also nearly identical to those 
71:2327:176601:21:27:71:544:207:144:Times:144:Times:from  the  Choi  et  al  (2014)  data.  In our  data,  53%  of  subjects  exhibit  any  inconsistency  with  
71:2328:176710:27:17:72:532:180:42:g_d0_f51:121:Times:10 1424 individuals view at least one of the instruction screens, 1,311 are recorded as completing at least 
71:2329:176818:17:9:72:438:163:121:Times:121:Times:one round of the task, and 1,270 are recorded as completing each of the 11 rounds. 
71:2330:176900:9:17:72:544:154:42:g_d0_f51:121:Times:11  E.g.,  someone  who  always  allocates  all  tokens  to  account  X  is  consistent  with  GARP  if  they  are  
71:2331:177016:17:12:72:546:137:121:Times:121:Times:maximizing  the  utility  function  U(X,  Y)=X.  Someone  with  a  more  normatively appealing  utility  
71:2332:177121:12:13:72:542:125:121:Times:121:Times:function—that generates utility over tokens or consumption per se—would be better off with the decision 
71:2333:177225:13:9:72:332:112:121:Times:121:Times:rule of always allocating all tokens to the cheaper account. 
71:2334:177285:9:16:72:543:103:42:g_d0_f51:121:Times:12 The second measure calculates 1-CCEI across the subject’s 11 actual decisions and “the mirror image 
71:2335:177388:16:13:72:543:87:121:Times:121:Times:of these data obtained by reversing the prices and the associated allocation for each observation” (Choi et 
71:2336:177496:13:0:72:312:74:121:Times:121:Times:al. p. 1528), for 22 data points per respondent in total. 
72:2337:177555:0:20:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:GARP, and 96% exhibit any inconsistency with GARP or FOSD. If we set a 20pp threshold for 
72:2338:177645:20:21:72:547:688:144:Times:144:Times:classifying  someone  as  inconsistent,  only  7%  are  inconsistent  with  GARP,  and  31%  are  
72:2339:177743:21:21:72:545:667:144:Times:144:Times:inconsistent  with  GARP  or  FOSD.  Looking  more  directly  at  heterogeneity,  we  see  standard  
72:2340:177844:21:28:72:441:646:144:Times:144:Times:deviations of 0.08 and 0.18, and 10th-90th percentile ranges of 0.16 and 0.41. 
72:2341:177923:28:21:90:544:618:144:Times:144:Times:Choi et  al.  find  that choice inconsistency  with  GARP  is  conditionally  correlated  with  lower  
72:2342:178026:21:29:71:468:597:144:Times:144:Times:net worth, but that choice inconsistency with GARP+dominance avoidance is not.

72:2344:178154:29:20:90:543:539:144:Times:144:Times:Behavioral researchers have long noted a seemingly disproportionate preference for certainty 
72:2345:178247:20:21:72:544:519:144:Times:144:Times:(PFC) among  some  consumers  and  posited  various  theories  to  explain  it:  Cumulative  Prospect  
72:2346:178350:21:21:72:543:498:144:Times:144:Times:Theory (Daniel   Kahneman   and   Tversky   1979;   Amos   Tversky   and   Kahneman   1992), 
72:2347:178443:21:20:72:543:477:144:Times:144:Times:Disappointment Aversion (Bell 1985; Loomes and Sugden 1986; Gul 1991), and u-v preferences 
72:2348:178534:20:21:72:544:457:144:Times:144:Times:(Neilson 1992; Schmidt 1998; Diecidue, Schmidt, and Wakker 2004). PFC may help to explain 
72:2349:178624:21:21:72:539:436:144:Times:144:Times:seemingly  extreme  risk  averse  behavior,  which  could  in  turn  lead  to  lower  wealth  in  the  cross-
72:2350:178733:21:28:71:111:415:144:Times:144:Times:section. 
72:2351:178741:28:22:89:543:387:144:Times:144:Times:We use Callen et al.’s (2014) two-task method13 for measuring a subject’s certainty premium 
72:2352:178833:22:21:72:542:365:144:Times:144:Times:(CP).14 Similar to Holt and Laury tasks, in one of the Callen et al. tasks subjects make 10 choices 
72:2353:178933:21:20:72:543:344:144:Times:144:Times:between two lotteries, one a (p, 1-p) gamble over X and Y > X , (p; X, Y), the other a (q, 1-q) 
72:2354:179029:20:21:72:545:324:144:Times:144:Times:gamble  over  Y  and  0,  (q;  Y,  0).  Both  Callen  et  al. and  we  fix  Y  and  X  at  450  and  150  
72:2355:179135:21:21:72:544:303:144:Times:144:Times:(hypothetical dollars in our case, hypothetical Afghanis in theirs), fix p at 0.5, and have q range 
72:2356:179235:21:20:72:544:282:144:Times:144:Times:from  0.1  to  1.0  in  increments  of  0.1.  In  the  other  task,  p  =  1,  so  the  subject  chooses  between  a  
72:2357:179353:20:21:72:543:262:144:Times:144:Times:lottery and a certain option. Our two tasks are identical to Callen et al.’s except for the currency 
72:2358:179454:21:21:72:544:241:144:Times:144:Times:units.  But  our  settings,  implementation,  and  use  of  the  elicited  data  are  different.  Callen  et  al.  
72:2359:179569:21:21:72:547:220:144:Times:144:Times:administer  the  tasks  in-person,  using  trained  surveyors,  at  polling  centers  and  homes  in  
72:2360:179671:21:28:72:489:199:144:Times:144:Times:Afghanistan. They use the data to examine the effects of violence on risk preferences.  
72:2361:179758:28:21:90:543:171:144:Times:144:Times:1,463  of  1,505  (97%)  of  our  subjects  who  started  the  tasks  completed  all  20  choices 
72:2362:179856:21:34:72:543:150:144:Times:144:Times:(compared to 977/1127 = 87% in Callen et al.). As is typical with Holt-Laury tasks, we exclude 
72:2363:179951:34:16:72:543:116:42:g_d0_f51:121:Times:13 Callen et al. describes its task as “a field-ready, two-question modification of the uncertainty equivalent 
72:2364:180062:16:10:72:272:100:121:Times:121:Times:presented in Andreoni and Sprenger (2016).” 
72:2365:180106:10:16:72:544:90:42:g_d0_f51:121:Times:14  The  Callen  et  al.  tasks  also  elicit  non-parametric  measures  of  classical  risk  aversion:  a  higher  switch  
72:2366:180230:16:0:71:481:74:121:Times:121:Times:point indicates greater risk aversion. We discuss these measures in Section 1-D of the paper. 
73:2367:180326:0:20:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:some subjects whose choices indicate miscomprehension of or inattention to the task. 11% of our 
73:2368:180422:20:21:72:547:688:144:Times:144:Times:subjects multiple-switch  on  our  two-lottery  task  (compared  to  10%  in  Callen  et  al.),  and  9%  of  
73:2369:180532:21:21:72:542:667:144:Times:144:Times:our subjects multiple-switch on the lottery vs. certain option tasks (compared to 13% in Callen et 
73:2370:180631:21:21:72:543:646:144:Times:144:Times:al.). 14% of our subjects switch too soon for monotonic utility in the two-lottery—in rows [2, 4] 
73:2371:180729:21:20:71:542:625:144:Times:144:Times:in the two-lottery task—compared to 13% in Callen et al. All told, 19% of our subjects exhibit a 
73:2372:180826:20:21:71:545:605:144:Times:144:Times:puzzling  switch  (17%  in  Callen  et  al.),  leaving  us  with  1,188  usable  observations.  Of  these  
73:2373:180933:21:21:71:542:584:144:Times:144:Times:subjects,  1,049 switch  on  both  tasks,  as  is  required  to  estimate  CP.  Of  these  1,049,  only  30% 
73:2374:181042:21:28:71:426:563:144:Times:144:Times:switch at the same point on both tasks, in contrast to 63% in Callen et al.  
73:2375:181119:28:21:89:543:535:144:Times:144:Times:We  estimate  CP  for  each  respondent  i  by  imputing  the  likelihoods  q*  at  which  i  expresses  
73:2376:181224:21:21:71:542:514:144:Times:144:Times:indifference  as  the  midpoint  of  the  q  interval  at  which  i  switches,  and  then  using  the  two 
73:2377:181331:21:20:71:542:493:144:Times:144:Times:likelihoods to estimate the indirect utility components of the CP formula. As Callen et al. detail, 
73:2378:181431:20:21:71:542:473:144:Times:144:Times:the CP “is defined in probability units of the high outcome, Y, such that one can refer to certainty 
73:2379:181532:21:21:71:543:452:144:Times:144:Times:of  X  being  worth  a  specific  percent  chance  of  Y  relative  to  its  uncertain  value.”  We  estimate  a  
73:2380:181646:21:21:71:543:431:144:Times:144:Times:mean CP of 0.16 in our sample (SD=0.24, median =0.15), compared to 0.37 (SD=0.15) in Callen 
73:2381:181738:21:20:72:543:410:144:Times:144:Times:et al. Their findings suggest that much of the difference could be explained by greater exposure 
73:2382:181835:20:29:71:208:390:144:Times:144:Times:to violence in their sample.  
73:2383:181864:29:21:89:542:361:144:Times:144:Times:As Callen et al. detail, the sign of CP also carries broader information about preferences. CP 
73:2384:181959:21:20:71:543:340:144:Times:144:Times:= 0 indicates an expected utility maximizer. CP>0 indicates a preference for certainty (PFC), as 
73:2385:182056:20:21:71:543:320:144:Times:144:Times:in models of disappointment aversion or u-v preferences. We classify 77% of our sample as PFC 
73:2386:182150:21:21:71:542:299:144:Times:144:Times:type based on an any-deviation threshold. This falls to 73%, 60%, or 42% if we count only larger 
73:2387:182247:21:20:71:543:278:144:Times:144:Times:deviations >0 (5pp, 10pp, or 20pp) as behavioral. In Callen et al. 99.63% of the sample exhibits 
73:2388:182344:20:21:71:543:258:144:Times:144:Times:PFC. CP<0 indicates a cumulative prospect theory (CPT) type, and we classify 23%, 20%, 13% 
73:2389:182435:21:21:71:544:237:144:Times:144:Times:or  7%  as  CPT  under  the  different  deviation  thresholds. We  denote  PFC  as  the  standard  bias,  
73:2390:182541:21:28:71:504:216:144:Times:144:Times:simply because CP>0 is far more common than CP<0 in both our data and Callen et al.’s. 
73:2391:182628:28:21:89:552:188:144:Times:144:Times:Callen et  al.  find significant  correlations    between  the  CP  and  financial  outcomes,  in  
73:2392:182727:21:21:71:544:167:144:Times:144:Times:particular  with  avoiding  late  loan  repayments,15  but  their  data  lack  controls  for  cognitive  skills  
73:2393:182840:21:43:72:170:146:144:Times:144:Times:and other B-factors. 
73:2394:182860:43:16:72:545:103:42:g_d0_f51:121:Times:15 The theoretical mapping from late loan repayments to our indices of financial condition is  unclear under 
73:2395:182969:16:13:71:520:87:121:Times:121:Times:limited liability, and the average relationship (not conditioning on borrowing) more ambiguous, since 
73:2396:183071:13:0:71:523:74:121:Times:121:Times:borrowing could lead to (weakly) greater or lesser wealth if consumers are behavioral (Zinman 2014). 
74:2397:183174:0:28:72:287:708:144:Times:144:Times:E. Loss aversion/small-stakes risk aversion 
74:2398:183216:28:21:90:543:680:144:Times:144:Times:Loss aversion refers to placing higher weight on losses than gains, in utility terms. It is one of 
74:2399:183315:21:21:72:542:659:144:Times:144:Times:the  most  influential  concepts  in  the  behavioral  social  sciences,  with  seminal  papers—e.g., 
74:2400:183417:21:21:72:546:638:144:Times:144:Times:Tversky  and  Kahneman  (1992) and  Benartzi  and  Thaler  (1995)—producing  thousands  of  
74:2401:183509:21:20:72:542:617:144:Times:144:Times:citations. Loss  aversion  has  been  implicated  in  various  portfolio  choices  (Barberis  2013)  and 
74:2402:183614:20:29:71:459:597:144:Times:144:Times:consumption dynamics (Kőszegi and Rabin 2009) that can lead to lower wealth. 
74:2403:183691:29:21:89:542:568:144:Times:144:Times:We  measure  loss  aversion  using  the  two  choices  developed  by  Fehr  and  Goette  (2007) in 
74:2404:183790:21:20:71:546:547:144:Times:144:Times:their  study  of  the  labor  supply  of  bike  messengers  (see  Abeler  et  al.  (2011) for  a  similar  
74:2405:183897:20:21:71:542:527:144:Times:144:Times:elicitation method). Choice 1 is between a lottery with a 50% chance of winning $80 and a 50% 
74:2406:183991:21:21:71:542:506:144:Times:144:Times:chance of losing $50, and zero dollars. Choice two is between playing the lottery in Choice 1 six 
74:2407:184089:21:20:71:542:485:144:Times:144:Times:times,  and  zero  dollars.  As  Fehr  and  Goette  (FG)  show,  if  subjects  have  reference-dependent 
74:2408:184194:20:21:71:543:465:144:Times:144:Times:preferences, then subjects who reject lottery 1 have a higher level of loss aversion than subjects 
74:2409:184293:21:21:71:544:444:144:Times:144:Times:who accept lottery 1, and subjects who reject both lotteries have a higher level of loss aversion 
74:2410:184391:21:20:71:543:423:144:Times:144:Times:than subjects who reject only lottery 1. In addition, if subjects' loss aversion is consistent across 
74:2411:184493:20:21:71:543:403:144:Times:144:Times:the two lotteries, then any individual who rejects lottery 2 should also reject lottery 1 because a 
74:2412:184593:21:21:71:543:382:144:Times:144:Times:rejection  of  lottery  2  implies  a  higher  level  of  loss  aversion  than  a  rejection  of  only  lottery  1.  
74:2413:184710:21:21:71:543:361:144:Times:144:Times:Other  researchers  have  noted  that,  even  in  the  absence  of  loss  aversion,  choosing  Option  B  is  
74:2414:184820:21:21:71:545:340:144:Times:144:Times:compatible  with  small-stakes  risk  aversion.16  We  acknowledge  this  but  use  “loss  aversion”  
74:2415:184922:21:20:72:545:319:144:Times:144:Times:instead  of  “loss  aversion  and/or  small-stakes  risk  aversion”  as  shorthand.  Small-stakes  risk  
74:2416:185027:20:21:71:544:299:144:Times:144:Times:aversion  is  also  often  classified  as  behavioral  because  it  is  incompatible  with  expected  utility  
74:2417:185138:21:29:71:174:278:144:Times:144:Times:theory (Rabin 2000). 
74:2418:185159:29:20:89:543:249:144:Times:144:Times:Response  rates  suggest  a  high  level  of  comfort  with  these  questions;  only  two  of  our  1,515  
74:2419:185266:20:21:71:542:229:144:Times:144:Times:subjects skip, and only two more who answer the first question do not answer the second. 37% of 
74:2420:185362:21:21:72:546:208:144:Times:144:Times:our  1,511  respondents reject  both  lotteries,  consistent  with  relatively  extreme  loss  aversion,  
74:2421:185468:21:21:72:546:187:144:Times:144:Times:compared  to  45%  of  FG’s  42  subjects.  Another  36%  of  our  subjects  accept  both  lotteries,  
74:2422:185571:21:20:72:544:166:144:Times:144:Times:consistent with classical behavior, compared to 33% in FG. The remaining 27% of our subjects 
74:2423:185664:20:21:72:543:146:144:Times:144:Times:(and 21% of FG’s) exhibit moderate loss aversion, playing one lottery but not the other, with our 
74:2424:185762:21:35:72:545:125:144:Times:144:Times:main  difference  from  FG  being  that  14%  of  our  subjects  (vs.  only  2%  of  theirs)  exhibit  the  
74:2425:185870:35:16:72:544:90:42:g_d0_f51:121:Times:16  A  related  point  is  that  there  is  no  known  “model-free”  method  of  eliciting  loss  aversion  (Dean  and  
74:2426:185990:16:0:72:144:74:121:Times:121:Times:Ortoleva 2018). 
75:2427:186008:0:20:72:545:708:144:Times:144:Times:puzzling  behavior  of  playing  lottery  1  but  not  lottery  2.  Although  one  wonders  whether  these  
75:2428:186116:20:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:14% misunderstood the questions, we find only a bit of evidence in support of that interpretation: 
75:2429:186215:21:21:72:544:667:144:Times:144:Times:those playing the single but not compound lottery have slightly lower cognitive skills than other 
75:2430:186313:21:21:72:544:646:144:Times:144:Times:loss  averters,  conditional  on  our  rich  set  of  covariates, but  actually  have  higher  cognitive  skills  
75:2431:186427:21:20:72:547:625:144:Times:144:Times:than   the   most-classical   group.   And   playing   the   single   but   not   the   compound   lottery   is   
75:2432:186541:20:21:72:543:605:144:Times:144:Times:uncorrelated with our measure of ambiguity aversion, pushing against the interpretation that the 
75:2433:186638:21:21:72:542:584:144:Times:144:Times:compound  lottery  is  sufficiently  complicated  as  to  appear  effectively  ambiguous  (Dean  and 
75:2434:186739:21:28:72:151:563:144:Times:144:Times:Ortoleva 2018). 
75:2435:186755:28:21:90:542:535:144:Times:144:Times:All  told  64%  of  our  subjects  indicate  some  loss  aversion,  defined  as  rejecting  one  or  both 
75:2436:186861:21:21:72:542:514:144:Times:144:Times:small-stakes lotteries, as do 67% in FG. In Abeler et al.’s (2011) student sample, 87% reject one 
75:2437:186959:21:20:72:546:493:144:Times:144:Times:or  more  of  the  four  small-stakes  lotteries  with  positive  expected  value.  The  Abeler  et  al.  
75:2438:187065:20:21:72:543:473:144:Times:144:Times:questions were also fielded in an ALP module from early 2013 used by Hwang (2016); 70% of 
75:2439:187155:21:21:72:545:452:144:Times:144:Times:that  sample  exhibits some  loss  aversion.  In  von  Gaudecker  et  al.’s nationally  representative  
75:2440:187259:21:21:72:543:431:144:Times:144:Times:Dutch  sample,  86%  exhibit  some  loss  aversion,  as  inferred  from  structural  estimation  based  on 
75:2441:187365:21:20:72:543:410:144:Times:144:Times:data from multiple price lists. We also order sets of deviations to indicate greater degrees of loss 
75:2442:187466:20:21:72:545:390:144:Times:144:Times:aversion,  based  on  whether  the  individual  respondent  rejects  the  compound  but  not  the  single  
75:2443:187573:21:29:72:416:369:144:Times:144:Times:lottery, rejects the single but not the compound lottery, or rejects both.  
75:2444:187649:29:20:90:543:340:144:Times:144:Times:Despite  the  massive  amount  of  work  on  loss  aversion,  research  exploring links  between 
75:2445:187745:20:21:72:544:320:144:Times:144:Times:directly elicited measures of loss aversion and field  behavior is  only  beginning. von  Gaudecker  
75:2446:187846:21:21:72:546:299:144:Times:144:Times:et  al.  (2011) do  not  explore  links  between  loss  aversion  and  field  behavior. Dimmock  and  
75:2447:187948:21:20:72:543:278:144:Times:144:Times:Kouwenberg  (2010) do,  like  von  Gaudecker  et  al.  using  CentERdata,  but  lack  many  important 
75:2448:188050:20:21:72:546:258:144:Times:144:Times:covariates. Fehr  and  Goette  (2007) find  that  loss  aversion  moderates  the  effect  of  a  wage  
75:2449:188153:21:21:72:545:237:144:Times:144:Times:increase,  but  their  sample  includes  only  bike  messengers  and  lacks  measures  of  many  other  
75:2450:188257:21:20:72:544:216:144:Times:144:Times:potentially moderating factors. Abeler et al. (2011) find that loss aversion is strongly correlated 
75:2451:188357:20:21:72:545:196:144:Times:144:Times:with  effort  choices  in  the  lab  among  their  student  sample,  but  again  they  lack  data  on  many  
75:2452:188466:21:21:72:543:175:144:Times:144:Times:covariates of interest. Hwang (2016) uses the Abeler et al. measures to infer a strong correlation 
75:2453:188565:21:21:72:546:154:144:Times:144:Times:between  loss  aversion  and  insurance  holdings  in an  earlier  ALP  module,  but  lacks  many  
75:2454:188664:21:0:72:544:133:144:Times:144:Times:important  covariates  and  the  only  other  behavioral  factor  considered  is  an  interaction  between  
76:2455:188774:0:20:72:546:708:144:Times:144:Times:loss  aversion  and  a  measure  of  the  Gambler’s  Fallacy  (labeled  “Heuristics”  in  the  Hwang  
76:2456:188876:20:29:72:116:688:144:Times:144:Times:paper).17 
76:2457:188885:29:29:72:294:659:144:Times:144:Times:F. Narrow bracketing and dominated choice 
76:2458:188926:29:21:90:544:630:144:Times:144:Times:Narrow  bracketing  refers  to  the  tendency  to  make  decisions  in  (relative)  isolation,  without  
76:2459:189031:21:21:72:545:609:144:Times:144:Times:full  consideration  of  other  choices  and  constraints.  Rabin  and  Weizsacker  (2009) show  that  
76:2460:189134:21:20:72:543:588:144:Times:144:Times:narrow  bracketing  can  lead  to  dominated  choices—and  hence  expensive  and  wealth-reducing 
76:2461:189232:20:29:72:258:568:144:Times:144:Times:ones—given non-CARA preferences.  
76:2462:189265:29:21:90:545:539:144:Times:144:Times:We  measure  narrow  bracketing  and  dominated  choice  (NBDC)  using  two  of  the  tasks  in  
76:2463:189362:21:20:72:546:518:144:Times:144:Times:Rabin  and  Weizacker  (2009).  Each  task  instructs  the  subject  to  make  two  decisions.  Each  
76:2464:189464:20:21:72:543:498:144:Times:144:Times:decision presents the subject with a choice between a certain payoff and a gamble. Each decision 
76:2465:189561:21:21:72:544:477:144:Times:144:Times:pair  appears  on  the  same  screen,  with  an  instruction  to  consider  the  two  decisions  jointly.  RW  
76:2466:189672:21:20:72:545:456:144:Times:144:Times:administer  their  tasks  with  students  and,  like  us,  in  a  nationally  representative  online  panel  
76:2467:189781:20:29:72:522:436:144:Times:144:Times:(Knowledge Networks in their case). Like us, payoffs are hypothetical for their online panel.  
76:2468:189876:29:21:90:543:407:144:Times:144:Times:Our first task follows RW’s Example 2, with Decision 1 between winning $100 vs. a 50-50 
76:2469:189964:21:21:72:543:386:144:Times:144:Times:chance of losing $300 or winning $700, and Decision 2 between losing $400 vs. a 50-50 chance 
76:2470:190057:21:21:72:543:365:144:Times:144:Times:of losing $900 or winning $100.18 As RW show, someone who is loss averse and risk-seeking in 
76:2471:190150:21:20:71:544:344:144:Times:144:Times:losses  will,  in  isolation  (narrow  bracketing)  tend  to  choose  A  over  B,  and  D  over  C.  But  the  
76:2472:190261:20:21:71:540:324:144:Times:144:Times:combination  AD  is  dominated  with  an  expected  loss  of  $50  relative  to  BC.  Hence  a  broad-
76:2473:190363:21:21:71:542:303:144:Times:144:Times:bracketer will never choose AD.  29% of our subjects choose AD, compared to 53% in the most 
76:2474:190455:21:28:71:210:282:144:Times:144:Times:similar presentation in RW.  
76:2475:190483:28:21:89:543:254:144:Times:144:Times:Our second task reproduces RW’s Example 4, with Decision 1 between winning $850 vs. a 
76:2476:190569:21:21:71:540:233:144:Times:144:Times:50-50 chance of winning $100 or winning $1,600, and Decision 2 between losing $650 vs. a 50-
76:2477:190661:21:20:71:543:212:144:Times:144:Times:50  chance  of  losing  $1,550  or  winning  $100.  As  in  task  one,  a  decision  maker  who  rejects  the  
76:2478:190772:20:21:71:542:192:144:Times:144:Times:risk in the first decision but accepts it in the second decision (A and D) violates dominance, here 
76:2479:190872:21:42:71:543:171:144:Times:144:Times:with an expected loss of $75 relative to BC. 23% of our subjects choose AD, compared to 36% 
76:2480:190964:42:17:72:526:129:42:g_d0_f51:121:Times:17 Hwang (2016) also discusses the potential (mediating) role of narrow framing/bracketing but lacks a 
76:2481:191067:17:9:71:220:112:121:Times:121:Times:directly elicited measure of such. 
76:2482:191101:9:16:72:542:103:42:g_d0_f51:121:Times:18  Given  the  puzzling  result  that  RW’s  Example  2  was  relatively  impervious  to  a  broad-bracketing 
76:2483:191212:16:13:72:542:87:121:Times:121:Times:treatment,  we  changed  our  version  slightly  to  avoid  zero-amount  payoffs.  Thanks  to  Georg  Weizsacker 
76:2484:191325:13:0:71:158:74:121:Times:121:Times:for this suggestion. 
77:2485:191347:0:20:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:in  the  most  similar  presentation  in  RW.  As  RW  discuss,  a new  feature  of  task  two  is  that  AD  
77:2486:191457:20:21:72:540:688:144:Times:144:Times:sacrifices expected value in the second decision, not in the first. This implies that for all broad-
77:2487:191557:21:21:71:544:667:144:Times:144:Times:bracketing  risk  averters  AC  is  optimal:  it  generates  the  highest  available  expected  value  at  no  
77:2488:191668:21:21:71:542:646:144:Times:144:Times:variance. 50% of our subjects choose AC, compared to only 33% in the most similar presentation 
77:2489:191763:21:28:71:524:625:144:Times:144:Times:in RW. I.e., 50% of our subjects do NOT broad-bracket in this task, compared to 67% in RW. 
77:2490:191854:28:21:89:545:597:144:Times:144:Times:Reassuringly,  responses  across  our  two  tasks  are  correlated;  this  is  especially  reassuring  
77:2491:191957:21:21:71:545:576:144:Times:144:Times:given  that  the  two  tasks  appear  non-consecutively  in  the  survey,  hopefully  dampening  any  
77:2492:192059:21:20:71:543:555:144:Times:144:Times:tendency for a mechanical correlation. E.g., the unconditional correlation between choosing AD 
77:2493:192154:20:29:71:208:535:144:Times:144:Times:across the two tasks is 0.34. 
77:2494:192183:29:21:89:545:506:144:Times:144:Times:1,486 subjects  complete  both  tasks  (out  of  the  1,515 who  respond  to  at  least  one  of  our  
77:2495:192286:21:20:71:543:485:144:Times:144:Times:questions in module 315). Putting the two tasks together to create summary indicators of narrow 
77:2496:192381:20:21:71:543:465:144:Times:144:Times:bracketing,  we  find 59%  of  our  subjects  exhibiting some  narrow  bracketing  in  the  sense  of  not  
77:2497:192489:21:21:71:539:444:144:Times:144:Times:broad-bracketing  on  both  tasks,  while  13%  narrow-bracket  on  both  tasks. These  are  uni-
77:2498:192586:21:20:71:543:423:144:Times:144:Times:directional indicators: we either classify someone as narrow-bracketing, or not. RW do not create 
77:2499:192684:20:21:71:543:403:144:Times:144:Times:summary  indicators  across  tasks,  but,  as  noted  above,  their  subjects  exhibit  substantially  more  
77:2500:192793:21:29:71:342:382:144:Times:144:Times:narrow bracketing at the task level than our subjects do. 
77:2501:192851:29:21:89:544:353:144:Times:144:Times:Research  linking  directly-elicited  measures  of  NBDC  to  field outcomes  is  just  beginning.  
77:2502:192951:21:20:71:544:332:144:Times:144:Times:The  only  paper  we  know  of  in  this  vein,  Gottlieb  and  Mitchell  (2015), uses  a  different  method  
77:2503:193061:20:21:71:543:312:144:Times:144:Times:for  measuring  narrow  bracketing—one  that  does  not  allow  for  dominated  choice—the  Tversky  
77:2504:193162:21:21:71:545:291:144:Times:144:Times:and  Kahneman (1981) “sensitivity  to  framing”  questions  regarding  the  policy  response  to  an  
77:2505:193264:21:20:71:543:270:144:Times:144:Times:epidemic.  30%  of  subjects  in  the  Health  and  Retirement  Study  choose  different  policy  options  
77:2506:193371:20:21:71:546:250:144:Times:144:Times:under  the  two  different  frames,  an  indicator  of  framing  sensitivity,  and  this  indicator  is  
77:2507:193476:21:21:71:543:229:144:Times:144:Times:negatively  correlated  with  the  holding  of  long-term  care  insurance,  conditional  on  a  rich  set  of  
77:2508:193588:21:29:71:281:208:144:Times:144:Times:covariates include a measure loss aversion. 
77:2509:193631:29:28:71:186:179:144:Times:144:Times:G. Ambiguity aversion 
77:2510:193651:28:21:89:549:151:144:Times:144:Times:Ambiguity   aversion   refers   to   a   preference   for   known   uncertainty   over   unknown   
77:2511:193750:21:21:71:549:130:144:Times:144:Times:uncertainty—preferring,   for   example,   a   less-than-50/50   gamble   to   one   with   unknown   
77:2512:193852:21:20:71:539:109:144:Times:144:Times:probabilities.  It  has  been  widely  theorized  that  ambiguity  aversion  can  explain  various  sub-
77:2513:193956:20:0:71:546:89:144:Times:144:Times:optimal  portfolio  choices,  and  Dimmock  et  al.  (2016) find  that  it  is  indeed  conditionally  
78:2514:194061:0:20:72:545:708:144:Times:144:Times:correlated  with  lower  stockholdings  and  worse  diversification  in  their  ALP  sample  (see  also  
78:2515:194166:20:29:72:297:688:144:Times:144:Times:Dimmock, Kouwenberg, and Wakker (2016)). 
78:2516:194207:29:21:90:544:659:144:Times:144:Times:We  elicit  a  coarse  measure  of  ambiguity  aversion  using  just  one  or  two  questions  about  a  
78:2517:194312:21:21:72:543:638:144:Times:144:Times:game that pays $500 if you select a green ball. The first question offers the choice between a Bag 
78:2518:194411:21:20:72:543:617:144:Times:144:Times:One with 45 green and 55 yellow balls vs. a Bag Two of unknown composition. 1,397 subjects 
78:2519:194502:20:21:72:544:597:144:Times:144:Times:respond to this question (out of 1,427 who answer at least one of our questions on ALP module 
78:2520:194596:21:21:72:545:576:144:Times:144:Times:352). 73%  choose  the  45-55  bag,  and  we  label  them  ambiguity  averse.  The  survey  then  asks  
78:2521:194700:21:20:71:542:555:144:Times:144:Times:these subjects how many green balls would need to be in Bag One to induce them to switch. We 
78:2522:194793:20:21:71:542:535:144:Times:144:Times:subtract this amount from 50, dropping the 99 subjects whose response to the second question is 
78:2523:194889:21:21:71:544:514:144:Times:144:Times:>45 (and  the  10  subjects  who  do  not  respond),  to  obtain  a  continuous  measure  of  ambiguity  
78:2524:194994:21:20:71:544:493:144:Times:144:Times:aversion  that  ranges  from  0  (not  averse  in  the  first  question)  to  50  (most  averse===  the  three  
78:2525:195106:20:21:71:543:473:144:Times:144:Times:subjects  who  respond  “zero”  to  the  second  question).  The  continuous  measure  (N=1,288)  has  a  
78:2526:195212:21:21:72:543:452:144:Times:144:Times:mean of 14 (median=10), and a SD of 13. If we impose a large-deviation threshold of 10 (20% of 
78:2527:195307:21:21:72:544:431:144:Times:144:Times:the  max)  for  labeling  someone  as  ambiguity  averse,  50%  of  our  sample  exceeds  this  threshold  
78:2528:195414:21:20:72:540:410:144:Times:144:Times:and  another  16%  are  at  the  threshold.  Our  elicitation  does  not  distinguish  between  ambiguity-
78:2529:195520:20:21:72:544:390:144:Times:144:Times:neutral  and  ambiguity-seeking choices (for more comprehensive but still tractable methods see, 
78:2530:195617:21:21:72:543:369:144:Times:144:Times:e.g., Dimmock, Kouwenberg et al. (2016), Dimmock, Kouwenberg, and Wakker (2016), Gneezy 
78:2531:195705:21:28:71:488:348:144:Times:144:Times:et al. (2015)), and so our measure of deviation from ambiguity-neutrality is one-sided. 
78:2532:195793:28:21:90:543:320:144:Times:144:Times:Despite the coarseness of our elicitation, comparisons to other work suggest that it produces 
78:2533:195887:21:21:72:543:299:144:Times:144:Times:reliable data. Our ambiguity aversion indicator correlates with one constructed from Dimmock et 
78:2534:195983:21:20:72:542:278:144:Times:144:Times:al.’s  elicitation  in  the  ALP  (0.14,  p-value  0.0001,  N=789),  despite  the  elicitations  taking  place 
78:2535:196094:20:21:72:544:258:144:Times:144:Times:roughly  3  years  apart.  Prevalence  at  our  10pp  large-deviation  cutoff  nearly matches that  from  
78:2536:196200:21:21:72:543:237:144:Times:144:Times:Dimmock, Kouwenberg et al.’s (2016) ALP sample and Butler et al.’s (2014) Unicredit Clients’ 
78:2537:196293:21:20:72:545:216:144:Times:144:Times:Survey  sample  from  Italy,  and  our prevalence  of  any  ambiguity  aversion,  0.73  is  similar  to  
78:2538:196398:20:29:72:502:196:144:Times:144:Times:Dimmock, Kouwenberg, and Wakker’s (2016) 0.68 from the Dutch version of the ALP .  
78:2539:196481:29:21:90:542:167:144:Times:144:Times:Our examination of links to field behaviors builds on the papers by Dimmock and co-authors 
78:2540:196572:21:0:72:544:146:144:Times:144:Times:cited  above,  which  estimate conditional correlations  between  ambiguity  aversion  and  financial  
79:2541:196677:0:20:72:540:708:144:Times:144:Times:market behavior. We broaden the set of both outcomes and control variables (especially other B-
79:2542:196772:20:29:71:122:688:144:Times:144:Times:factors).19

79:2544:196816:29:21:90:540:630:144:Times:144:Times:Overconfidence has been implicated in excessive trading (Daniel and Hirshleifer 2015), over-

79:2548:197151:29:29:90:543:539:144:Times:144:Times:We elicit three distinct measures of overconfidence, following e.g., Moore and Healy (2008).  
79:2549:197245:29:20:90:545:510:144:Times:144:Times:The  first  measures  it  in  level/absolute  terms,  by  following  the  three  Banks  and  Oldfield  
79:2550:197348:20:21:71:543:490:144:Times:144:Times:numeracy questions, in our second Round 1 module, with the question: “How many of the last 3

79:2552:197552:21:20:71:542:448:144:Times:144:Times:correct?” We  then  subtract  the  respondent’s  assessment  from  her  actual  score.  39%  of  1,366 
79:2553:197655:20:21:71:543:428:144:Times:144:Times:subjects  are  overconfident  (“overestimation”  per  Moore  and  Healy)  by  this  measure  (with  32%  
79:2554:197760:21:21:71:542:407:144:Times:144:Times:overestimating by one question), while only 11% are underconfident (with 10% underestimating 
79:2555:197853:21:21:71:543:386:144:Times:144:Times:by one question). Larrick et al. (2007), Moore and Healy, and other studies use this method for 
79:2556:197949:21:20:71:544:365:144:Times:144:Times:measuring overestimation,  but  we  are  not  aware  of  any  that  report  individual-level  prevalence  
79:2557:198055:20:21:71:547:345:144:Times:144:Times:estimates   (they   instead   focus   on   task-level   data,   sample-level   summary   statistics,   and/or   
79:2558:198167:21:29:71:390:324:144:Times:144:Times:correlates of cross-sectional heterogeneity in estimation patterns). 
79:2559:198235:29:20:89:544:295:144:Times:144:Times:The  second  measures  overconfidence  in  precision,  as  indicated  by  responding  “100%”  on  
79:2560:198333:20:21:71:543:275:144:Times:144:Times:two sets of questions about the likelihoods (of different possible Banks and Oldfield quiz scores 
79:2561:198431:21:21:71:544:254:144:Times:144:Times:or  of  future  income  increases).  This  is  a  coarse  adaptation  of  the  usual  approaches  of  eliciting  
79:2562:198544:21:20:71:544:233:144:Times:144:Times:several  confidence  intervals  or  subjective  probability  distributions  (Moore  and  Healy).  In  our  
79:2563:198651:20:29:71:495:213:144:Times:144:Times:data 34% of 1,345 responding to both sets respond 100% on >=1 set, and 10% on both.  
79:2564:198736:29:21:89:543:184:144:Times:144:Times:The  third  measures  confidence  in  placement  (relative  performance),  using  a  self-ranking 
79:2565:198834:21:21:71:543:163:144:Times:144:Times:elicited before taking our number series test: “We would like to know what you think about your

79:2567:199037:20:32:71:540:122:144:Times:144:Times:would rank, relative to all of the other ALP members who have taken the test?” We find a better-
79:2568:199133:32:16:72:531:90:42:g_d0_f51:121:Times:19 The other paper we know of examining correlations between ambiguity attitudes and field behavior is 
79:2569:199236:16:0:72:306:74:121:Times:121:Times:Sutter et al.’s (2013) study of adolescents in Austria. 
80:2570:199293:0:20:72:544:708:144:Times:144:Times:than-average  effect in  the  sample  as  a  whole  (70%  report  a  percentile>median)  that  disappears  
80:2571:199400:20:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:when we ask the same question immediately post-test, still not having revealed any scores (50% 
80:2572:199495:21:21:71:545:667:144:Times:144:Times:report  a  percentile>median).  We also  construct  an  individual-level  measure  of  confidence  in  
80:2573:199598:21:21:72:542:646:144:Times:144:Times:placement  by  subtracting  the  subject’s  actual  ranking  from  his  pre-test  self-ranking  (N=1,395). 
80:2574:199705:21:20:72:547:625:144:Times:144:Times:This  measure  is  useful  for  capturing  individual-level  heterogeneity  ordinally,  but  not  for  
80:2575:199808:20:21:71:544:605:144:Times:144:Times:measuring  prevalence  because  the  actual  ranking  is  based  on  a  15-question  test  and  hence  its  
80:2576:199916:21:29:72:317:584:144:Times:144:Times:percentiles are much coarser than the self-ranking.

80:2580:200175:29:20:90:546:477:144:Times:144:Times:Under-weighting  the  importance  of  the  Law  of  Large  Numbers  (LLN)  can  affect  how  
80:2581:200268:20:21:72:545:457:144:Times:144:Times:individuals  treat  risk  (as  in  the  stock  market),  or  how  much  data  they  demand  before  making  
80:2582:200376:21:21:72:542:436:144:Times:144:Times:decisions. In this sense non-belief in LLN (a.k.a. NBLLN) can act as an “enabling bias” for other 
80:2583:200474:21:29:72:385:415:144:Times:144:Times:biases like loss aversion (Benjamin, Rabin, and Raymond 2016).

80:2595:201337:22:20:72:543:142:144:Times:144:Times:the distance between the subject’s answer for the [481, 519] range and 78. Only one subject gets

81:2599:201755:0:20:72:542:708:144:Times:144:Times:underestimation  as  the  “standard”  directional  bias.  The  modal  underestimator  responds  with  50

81:2602:202054:21:21:72:543:646:144:Times:144:Times:distance  is  43,  with  an  SD  of  17. 9%  of  the  sample  underestimates  by  20pp  or  less.  13%

81:2611:202731:29:21:89:545:436:144:Times:144:Times:The Gambler’s Fallacies  involve  falsely  attributing  statistical  dependence to  statistically  
81:2612:202830:21:21:72:544:415:144:Times:144:Times:independent events,  in  either  expecting  one  outcome  to  be  less  likely  because  it  has  happened  
81:2613:202938:21:20:72:545:394:144:Times:144:Times:recently  (recent  reds  on  roulette  make  black  more  likely  in  the  future)  or  the  reverse,  a  “hot  
81:2614:203050:20:21:72:547:374:144:Times:144:Times:hand”  view  that  recent  events  are  likely  to  be  repeated.  Gambler’s  fallacies  can  lead  to  
81:2615:203154:21:21:72:545:353:144:Times:144:Times:overvaluation  of  financial  expertise  (or  attending  to  misguided  financial  advice),  and  related  
81:2616:203261:21:20:72:543:332:144:Times:144:Times:portfolio  choices  like  the  active-fund  puzzle,  that  can  erode  wealth  (Rabin  and  Vayanos  2010). 
81:2617:203369:20:21:71:545:312:144:Times:144:Times:Because  the  hot  hand  fallacy  is  more  closely  linked  to  harmful  financial  behaviors  such  as  
81:2618:203475:21:21:71:546:291:144:Times:144:Times:“return-chasing”  or  over-valuing  the  talent  of  stock-pickers  (Rabin  and  Vayanos  2010),  for  
81:2619:203578:21:20:71:545:270:144:Times:144:Times:analyses  linking  the  fallacies  to  field  behavior  we  denote  hot-hand as  the  “standard”  bias  and  
81:2620:203687:20:29:71:215:250:144:Times:144:Times:cold-hand as “non-standard.” 
81:2621:203716:29:29:89:497:221:144:Times:144:Times:We take a slice of Benjamin, Moore, and Rabin’s (2017) elicitation for the fallacies: 
81:2622:203801:29:20:89:524:192:144:Times:144:Times:"Imagine that we had a computer “flip” a fair coin... 10 times. The first 9 are all heads. 
81:2623:203892:20:29:89:464:172:144:Times:144:Times:What are the chances, in percentage terms, that the 10th flip will be a head?" 
81:2624:203971:29:21:71:542:143:144:Times:144:Times:1,392 subjects  respond,  out  of  the  1,427 respondents  to  module  352.  The cold-hand  fallacy 
81:2625:204071:21:21:72:544:122:144:Times:144:Times:implies  a  response  <  50%,  while  the  hot-hand fallacy  implies  a  response  >  50%.  Our  mean  
81:2626:204174:21:20:72:544:101:144:Times:144:Times:response  is  45%  (SD=25),  which  is  consistent  with  the  cold-hand  but substantially  above  the  
81:2627:204279:20:0:72:540:81:144:Times:144:Times:32% in Benjamin, Moore, and Rabin. Another indication that we find less evidence of the cold-
82:2628:204374:0:20:72:539:708:144:Times:144:Times:hand  fallacy  is  that,  while  they  infer  that  “at  the  individual  level,  the  gambler’s  fallacy  [cold-
82:2629:204487:20:21:72:546:688:144:Times:144:Times:hand] appears  to  be  the  predominant  pattern  of  belief”  (2013,  p.  16),  we  find  only  26%  
82:2630:204589:21:21:72:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:answering  <  “50.” 14%  of  our  sample  responds  with  >”50”  (over  half  of  these  responses are at 
82:2631:204695:21:21:72:543:646:144:Times:144:Times:“90”  or  “100”).  So  60%  of  our  sample  answers  correctly.  Nearly  everyone  who  responds  with  
82:2632:204800:21:20:72:542:625:144:Times:144:Times:something other than “50” errs by a substantial amount—e.g., only 2 % of the sample is [30, 50) 
82:2633:204896:20:21:72:543:605:144:Times:144:Times:or  (50,  70].  Sixteen  percent  of  our  sample  answers  “10,”21  which  Benjamin,  Moore,  and  Rabin  
82:2634:205003:21:21:71:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:speculates is an indicator of miscomprehension; we find that while subjects with this indicator do 
82:2635:205102:21:21:71:545:563:144:Times:144:Times:have  significantly  lower  cognitive  skills  than  the  unbiased  group,  they  actually  have  higher  
82:2636:205208:21:28:71:413:542:144:Times:144:Times:cognitive skills than the rest of subjects exhibiting a gambler’s fallacy. 
82:2637:205283:28:21:89:546:514:144:Times:144:Times:Dohmen et  al.  (2009) measure the  fallacies  using  a  similar  elicitation  that  confronts  a

82:2639:205466:29:20:89:539:464:144:Times:144:Times:Imagine you are tossing a fair coin. After eight tosses you observe the following result: tails-
82:2640:205562:20:21:71:543:444:144:Times:144:Times:tails-tails-heads-tails-heads-heads-heads. What is the probability, in percent, that the next toss is 
82:2641:205664:21:29:71:115:423:144:Times:144:Times:“tails”? 
82:2642:205672:29:21:89:543:394:144:Times:144:Times:986  of  Dohmen  et  al.’s  respondents  provide  some  answer  to  this  question,  95  of  whom  say 
82:2643:205775:21:20:71:543:373:144:Times:144:Times:“Don’t  know.” Among  the  remaining  891,  23%  exhibit  cold-hand (compared  to  26%  in  our 
82:2644:205871:20:21:71:543:353:144:Times:144:Times:sample), and 10% exhibit hot-hand (compared to 14% in our sample). Conditional on exhibiting 
82:2645:205964:21:21:71:540:332:144:Times:144:Times:cold-hand, on average subjects err by 29pp (40 pp in our sample). Conditional on exhibiting hot-
82:2646:206060:21:28:71:355:311:144:Times:144:Times:hand, the mean subject error is 27pp (39pp in our sample).

82:2649:206314:21:20:72:544:241:144:Times:144:Times:They  find  evidence  of  positive  correlations  between  hot-hand and  unemployment  and  between

83:2659:207074:21:21:72:545:667:144:Times:144:Times:EGB  follows  in  the  spirit  of  Stango  and  Zinman  (2009,  2011)  by  first  eliciting  the  monthly  
83:2660:207181:21:21:72:544:646:144:Times:144:Times:payment the respondent would expect to pay on a $10,000, 48 month car loan. The survey then 
83:2661:207273:21:20:72:543:625:144:Times:144:Times:asks “... What percent rate of interest does that imply in annual percentage rate ("APR") terms?” 
83:2662:207371:20:21:72:546:605:144:Times:144:Times:1,445 panelists  answer  both  questions,  out  of  the  1,515 respondents  to  Module  315.  Most  
83:2663:207471:21:21:72:544:584:144:Times:144:Times:responses  appear  sensible given  market  rates;  e.g.,  there  are  mass  points at  5%,  10%,  3%,  6%  
83:2664:207578:21:28:71:113:563:144:Times:144:Times:and 4%. 
83:2665:207586:28:21:89:544:535:144:Times:144:Times:We calculate an  individual-level  measure  of  “debt-side  EGB”  by  comparing  the  difference  
83:2666:207684:21:21:71:542:514:144:Times:144:Times:between the APR implied by the monthly payment supplied by that individual, and the perceived 
83:2667:207777:21:20:71:539:493:144:Times:144:Times:APR  as  supplied  directly  by  the  same  individual.  We  start  by  binning  individuals  into  under-
83:2668:207883:20:21:71:543:473:144:Times:144:Times:estimators  (the  standard  bias),  over-estimators,  unbiased,  and  unknown  (37%  of  the  sample).22 
83:2669:207987:21:21:72:545:452:144:Times:144:Times:The  median  level  difference  between  the  correct  and  stated  value  is  500bp,  with  a  mean  of  
83:2670:208093:21:21:72:542:431:144:Times:144:Times:1,042bp and SD of 1,879bp. Among those with known bias, we count as biased 70%, 64%, 47%, 
83:2671:208183:21:21:72:544:410:144:Times:144:Times:and  34%  under  error  tolerance  of  zero,  100bp,  500bp,  and  1000bp.  Under  these  tolerances  we  
83:2672:208289:21:20:72:543:389:144:Times:144:Times:count 3%, 13%, 41%, and 61% as unbiased, and 27%, 22%, 10%, and 3% as negatively biased. 
83:2673:208378:20:21:72:542:369:144:Times:144:Times:This is less EGB than Stango and Zinman (2009, 2011) see from questions in the 1983 Survey of 
83:2674:208472:21:21:72:543:348:144:Times:144:Times:Consumer Finances, where 98% of the sample underestimates, and the mean bias is 1,800bp or 
83:2675:208563:21:20:72:543:327:144:Times:144:Times:3,800bp  depending  on  the  benchmark. The  time  frames  of  the  questions  differ,  which may 
83:2676:208661:20:21:72:543:307:144:Times:144:Times:account for the difference (and is why we do not estimate an EGB structural model parameter to 
83:2677:208756:21:29:72:349:286:144:Times:144:Times:compare with our prior work or that of Levy and Tasoff). 
83:2678:208812:29:20:90:545:257:144:Times:144:Times:Stango  and  Zinman  (2009;  2011)  find  that  more debt-side  EGB  is  strongly  conditionally  
83:2679:208910:20:21:72:544:237:144:Times:144:Times:correlated  with  debt  composition, worse  loan  terms,  and  less  savings  and  wealth.  But  those  
83:2680:209014:21:29:72:437:216:144:Times:144:Times:papers lack direct controls for cognitive skills and other behavioral factors.  
83:2681:209094:29:21:90:543:187:144:Times:144:Times:Our  second  measure  of  EGB  comes  from  a  question popularized  by  Banks  and  Oldfield 
83:2682:209187:21:42:72:544:166:144:Times:144:Times:(2007) as  part  of  a  series  designed  to  measure  basic  numeracy:  “Let's  say  you  have  $200  in  a  
83:2683:209297:42:17:72:543:124:49:g_d0_f51:121:Times:22 Non-response is relatively small, as only 4% of the sample does not respond to both questions. Most of 
83:2684:209403:17:12:71:542:107:121:Times:121:Times:those we label as unknown-bias give responses that imply or state a 0% APR. 7% state payment amounts 
83:2685:209504:12:13:71:542:95:121:Times:121:Times:that imply a negative APR, even after being prompted to reconsider their answer. We also classify the 4% 
83:2686:209609:13:0:71:378:82:121:Times:121:Times:of respondents with implied APRs >=100% as having unknown bias.

84:2688:209768:20:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:for two years. How much would you have in the account at the end of two years?” 1,389 subjects 
84:2689:209863:21:21:72:539:667:144:Times:144:Times:answer this  question  (out  of  the  1,427 respondents  to  Module  352),  and  we  infer  an  individual-
84:2690:209970:21:21:72:543:646:144:Times:144:Times:level measure of “asset-side EGB” by comparing the difference between the correct future value 
84:2691:210065:21:21:72:544:625:144:Times:144:Times:($242),  and  the  future  value  supplied  by  the  same  individual.23  We  again  bin  individuals  into  
84:2692:210174:21:20:72:547:604:144:Times:144:Times:underestimators  (the  standard  bias),  overestimators,  unbiased,  and  unknown  (14%  of  the  
84:2693:210272:20:21:72:544:584:144:Times:144:Times:sample).24  Among  those  with  known  bias  (N=1,222),  the  median  bias  is  $0,  with  a  mean  of  $2  
84:2694:210380:21:21:72:543:563:144:Times:144:Times:and SD of $14.25 44% of our sample provides the correct FV. 47% of our sample underestimates 
84:2695:210473:21:21:72:546:542:144:Times:144:Times:by  some  amount,  with  most  underestimators  (29% of  the  sample)  providing  the  linearized  
84:2696:210572:21:21:72:543:521:144:Times:144:Times:(uncompounded) answer of $240. Nearly all other underestimates provide an answer that fails to 
84:2697:210667:21:20:72:542:500:144:Times:144:Times:account for even simple interest; the most common reply in this range is “$220.” Only 9% of our 
84:2698:210763:20:29:72:461:480:144:Times:144:Times:sample overestimates the FV, with small mass points at 244, 250, 400, and 440.  
84:2699:210843:29:21:90:543:451:144:Times:144:Times:Other  papers  have  used  the  Banks  and  Oldfield  question,  always—to  our  knowledge— 
84:2700:210935:21:21:71:542:430:144:Times:144:Times:measuring accuracy as opposed to directional bias and then using a 1/0 measure of correctness as 
84:2701:211032:21:20:71:542:409:144:Times:144:g_d0_f52:an input to a financial literacy or numeracy score (e.g., James Banks, O ’Dea, and Oldfield 2010; 
84:2702:211130:20:21:71:543:389:144:Times:144:Times:Gustman, Steinmeier, and Tabatabai 2012). Our tabs from the 2014 Health and Retirement Study 
84:2703:211223:21:21:71:546:368:144:Times:144:Times:suggest, using  only  the  youngest  HRS  respondents  and our  oldest  respondents  to  maximize  
84:2704:211322:21:20:71:547:347:144:Times:144:Times:comparability  (ages  50-60 in  both  samples),   that  there  is  substantially  more  underestimation  in  
84:2705:211431:20:21:71:542:327:144:Times:144:Times:the HRS (74%, vs. 48% in our sample). 14% overestimate in the HRS among those aged 50-60, 
84:2706:211521:21:29:71:178:306:144:Times:144:Times:vs. 9% in our sample. 
84:2707:211543:29:20:89:543:277:144:Times:144:Times:Goda et al. (2017) and Levy and Tasoff (2016) measure asset-side EGB using more difficult 
84:2708:211633:20:21:72:544:257:144:Times:144:Times:questions  in  their  representative  samples.  They  find  that  9%  and  11%  overestimate FVs,  while  
84:2709:211739:21:48:72:545:236:144:Times:144:Times:69% and  85%  underestimate.  We  do  not  construct  an  EGB  parameter  to  compare  to  theirs,  
84:2710:211839:48:16:72:543:188:42:g_d0_f51:121:Times:23 Responses to this question are correlated with responses to two other questions, drawn from Levy and 
84:2711:211943:16:13:71:543:172:121:Times:121:Times:Tasoff (2016), that can also be used to measure asset-side EGB, but our sample sizes are smaller for those 
84:2712:212050:13:9:71:320:159:121:Times:121:Times:two other questions and hence we do not use them here. 
84:2713:212104:9:17:72:543:150:49:g_d0_f51:121:Times:24 We label as unknown the 8% of the sample answering with future value < present value, the 3% of the 
84:2714:212207:17:13:71:543:133:121:Times:121:Times:sample  answering  with  a  future  value  >  2x  the  correct  future  value,  and  the  3%  of  the  sample  who  skip  
84:2715:212329:13:17:71:132:120:121:Times:121:Times:this question. 
84:2716:212344:17:16:72:544:103:42:g_d0_f51:121:Times:25  For  calculating  the  mean  and  SD  we  truncate  bias  at  -42  for  the  4%  sample  answering  with  future  
84:2717:212462:16:13:72:543:87:121:Times:121:Times:values 284<FV<485, to create symmetric extrema in the bias distribution since our definition caps bias at 
84:2718:212568:13:0:72:91:74:121:Times:121:Times:42.  
85:2719:212574:0:20:72:540:708:144:Times:144:Times:because  our  questions  lack  their  richness  and  yield  heavy  mass  points  at  unbiased  and  linear-
85:2720:212681:20:29:71:158:688:144:Times:144:Times:biased responses. 
85:2721:212698:29:21:89:543:659:144:Times:144:Times:The only prior paper we know looking directly at links between a measure of asset-side EGB 
85:2722:212789:21:21:71:542:638:144:Times:144:Times:and field outcomes is Goda et al., who use data on fewer behavioral factors. They find significant 
85:2723:212888:21:28:71:412:617:144:Times:144:Times:negative correlations between asset-side EGB and retirement savings.  
85:2724:212958:28:29:71:274:589:144:Times:144:Times:L. Limited attention and limited memory 
85:2725:212997:29:21:89:543:560:144:Times:144:Times:Prior  empirical  work  has  found  that  limited  attention  affects  a  range  of  financial  decisions 
85:2726:213102:21:20:72:545:539:144:Times:144:Times:(e.g.,  Barber  and  Odean  2008;  DellaVigna  and  Pollet  2009;  Karlan  et  al.  2016;  Stango  and  
85:2727:213206:20:21:72:542:519:144:Times:144:Times:Zinman  2014).  Behavioral  inattention  is  a  very  active  line  of  theory  inquiry  as  well    (e.g., 
85:2728:213314:21:29:72:494:498:144:Times:144:Times:Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer 2017; Kőszegi and Szeidl 2013; Schwartzstein 2014).  
85:2729:213400:29:20:90:544:469:144:Times:144:Times:In  the  absence  of  widely  used  methods  for  measuring  limited  attention  and/or  memory,  we  
85:2730:213502:20:29:72:337:449:144:Times:144:Times:create our own, using five simple questions and tasks.  
85:2731:213558:29:21:90:546:420:144:Times:144:Times:The  first  three  ask,  “Do  you  believe  that  your  household's  [horizon]  finances...  would  
85:2732:213658:21:20:72:539:399:144:Times:144:Times:improve  if  your  household  paid  more  attention  to  them?”   for  three  different  horizons:  “day-to-
85:2733:213766:20:21:72:542:379:144:Times:144:Times:day  (dealing  with  routine  expenses,  checking  credit  card  accounts,  bill  payments,  etc.)” 
85:2734:213866:21:21:72:542:358:144:Times:144:Times:“medium-run  (dealing  with  periodic  expenses  like  car  repair,  kids’  activities,  vacations,  etc.)” 
85:2735:213974:21:21:72:543:337:144:Times:144:Times:and “long-run (dealing with kids' college, retirement planning, allocation of savings/investments, 
85:2736:214073:21:20:72:550:316:144:Times:144:Times:etc.)”   Response  options  are  the  same  for  each  of  these  three  questions:  “Yes,  and  I/we  often  
85:2737:214183:20:21:72:545:296:144:Times:144:Times:regret  not  paying  greater  attention”  (26%,  23%,  and  35%),  “Yes,  but  paying  more  attention  
85:2738:214287:21:21:72:544:275:144:Times:144:Times:would  require  too  much  time/effort”  (8%,  11%,  and  12%),  “No,  my  household  finances  are  set  
85:2739:214393:21:20:72:543:254:144:Times:144:Times:up  so  that  they  don't  require  much  attention”  (15%,  16%,  and  13%),  and  “No,  my household is 
85:2740:214499:20:21:72:546:234:144:Times:144:Times:already  very  attentive  to  these  matters”  (52%,  51%,  and  41%).  We  designed  the  question  
85:2741:214600:21:21:72:547:213:144:Times:144:Times:wording  and  response  options  to  distinguish  behavioral  limited  inattention  (“Yes...  I/we  
85:2742:214700:21:20:72:543:192:144:Times:144:Times:often...”)—which also includes a measure of awareness thereof in “regret”—from full attention 
85:2743:214794:20:21:72:543:172:144:Times:144:Times:(“...  already  very  attentive”), rational  inattention,  and/or  a  sophisticated  response  to  behavioral  
85:2744:214905:21:21:72:545:151:144:Times:144:Times:inattention (“Yes,  but...  too  much  time/effort”;  “...  set  up  so  that  they  don’t  require  much  
85:2745:215012:21:29:72:129:130:144:Times:144:Times:attention”). 
85:2746:215024:29:20:90:545:101:144:Times:144:Times:Responses  are  strongly  but  not  perfectly  correlated  (ranging  0.56  to  0.69  among  pairwise  
85:2747:215126:20:0:72:544:81:144:Times:144:Times:expressions of regret). A fourth measure of limited attention is also strongly correlated with the 
86:2748:215227:0:20:72:545:708:144:Times:144:Times:others,  based  on  the  question:  “Do  you  believe  that  you  could  improve  the  prices/terms  your  
86:2749:215334:20:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:household  typically  receives  on  financial  products/services  by  shopping  more?”26  18%  respond  
86:2750:215438:21:21:72:551:667:144:Times:144:Times:“Yes, and I/we often regret not shopping more,”    and the likelihood of this response is correlated 
86:2751:215539:21:21:72:543:646:144:Times:144:Times:0.25 with each of the regret measures above. 1,483 subjects answer all four questions, out of the 
86:2752:215637:21:21:72:542:625:144:Times:144:Times:1,515 respondents to Module 315. Summing the four indicators of attentional regret, we find that 
86:2753:215734:21:20:72:543:604:144:Times:144:Times:49% of subjects have one or more (earning a classification of behavioral inattention), 29% have 
86:2754:215830:20:29:71:362:584:144:Times:144:Times:two or more, 19% three or more, and only 6% have all four. 
86:2755:215889:29:21:89:543:555:144:Times:144:Times:We  also  seek  to  measure  limited  prospective  memory,  following  previous  work  suggesting  
86:2756:215988:21:20:71:542:534:144:Times:144:Times:that limited memory entails real costs like forgetting to redeem rebates (e.g., Ericson 2011). We 
86:2757:216085:20:21:71:546:514:144:Times:144:Times:offer  an  incentivized  task  to  subjects  taking  module  352:  “The  ALP  will  offer  you  the

86:2761:216486:21:21:71:544:431:144:Times:144:Times:a  sense  of  what  our  response  rate  might  be,  please  tell  us  now  whether  you  expect  to  do  this

86:2763:216704:21:28:71:330:389:144:Times:144:Times:1,358. Only 14% actually complete the short survey.  
86:2764:216757:28:21:89:542:361:144:Times:144:Times:Our indicator of behavioral limited memory— (not completing the follow-up task conditional 
86:2765:216848:21:21:71:542:340:144:Times:144:Times:on intending to complete)—is a bit coarse. We suspect that some noise is introduced because our 
86:2766:216944:21:20:71:544:319:144:Times:144:Times:elicitation  makes  it costless to  express  an  intention  to  complete  (in  future  research  we  plan  to  
86:2767:217055:20:21:71:543:299:144:Times:144:Times:explore charging a small “sign up” fee), thereby including in the indicator’s sample frame some 
86:2768:217151:21:21:71:543:278:144:Times:144:Times:subjects who rationally do not complete the task. Relatedly, although we set the payoff for task 
86:2769:217248:21:20:71:542:257:144:Times:144:Times:completion  to  be  sufficiently  high  to  dominate  any  attention/memory/time  costs  in  marginal 
86:2770:217349:20:21:71:543:237:144:Times:144:Times:terms for most subjects (the effective hourly wage is in the hundreds of dollars), it may well be 
86:2771:217447:21:29:71:371:216:144:Times:144:Times:the case that the fixed cost exceeds $10 for some respondents. 
86:2772:217510:29:21:89:542:187:144:Times:144:Times:Ours is the first work we know of estimating conditional correlations between field outcomes

87:2778:217836:30:21:90:545:678:144:Times:144:Times:We  measure  fluid  intelligence  using  a  15-question,  non-adaptive  number  series  (McArdle,  
87:2779:217935:21:21:72:544:657:144:Times:144:Times:Fisher,  and  Kadlec  2007).  Number  series  scores  correlate  strongly  with  those  from  other  fluid  
87:2780:218043:21:31:72:257:636:144:Times:144:Times:intelligence tests like IQ and Raven’s. 
87:2781:218083:31:20:90:546:605:144:Times:144:Times:We  measure  numeracy  using:  “If  5  people  split  lottery  winnings  of  two  million  dollars

87:2785:218485:20:21:72:542:523:144:Times:144:Times:economics as  numeracy  and/or  financial  literacy  measures  since  their  deployment  in  the  2002

87:2788:218740:30:21:89:543:451:144:Times:144:Times:We  measure  financial  literacy  using  Lusardi  and  Mitchell’s  (2014)  “Big  Three”:  “Suppose  
87:2789:218840:21:21:71:543:430:144:Times:144:Times:you  had  $100  in  a  savings  account  and  the  interest  rate  was  2%  per  year.  After  5  years,  how  
87:2790:218951:21:21:71:542:409:144:Times:144:Times:much do you think you would have in the account if you left the money to grow?”; “Imagine that

87:2794:219336:21:30:71:399:326:144:Times:144:Times:return than a stock mutual fund." Response options are categorical.  
87:2795:219405:30:21:89:545:296:144:Times:144:Times:We  measure  executive  function  using  a  two-minute  Stroop  task  (MacLeod  1991).  Our  
87:2796:219498:21:21:72:545:275:144:Times:144:Times:version  displays  the  name  of  a  color  on  the  screen  (red,  blue,  green,  or  yellow)  and  asks  the  
87:2797:219610:21:20:72:544:254:144:Times:144:Times:subject to click on the button corresponding to the color the word is printed in (red, blue, green, 
87:2798:219710:20:21:72:543:234:144:Times:144:Times:or yellow; not necessarily corresponding to the color name). Answering correctly tends to require 
87:2799:219808:21:21:72:544:213:144:Times:144:Times:using  conscious  effort  to  override  the  tendency  (automatic  response)  to  select  the  name  rather  
87:2800:219917:21:20:72:542:192:144:Times:144:Times:than  the  color.  The  Stroop  task  is  sufficiently  classic  that  the  generic  failure  to  overcome 
87:2801:220024:20:21:72:543:172:144:Times:144:Times:automated behavior (in the game “Simon Says,” when an American crosses the street in England, 
87:2802:220118:21:21:72:543:151:144:Times:144:Times:etc.) is sometimes referred to as a “Stroop Mistake” (Camerer 2007). Before starting the task, the 
87:2803:220217:21:21:72:543:130:144:Times:144:Times:computer shows demonstrations of two choices (movie-style)—one with a correct response, and 
87:2804:220309:21:20:71:545:109:144:Times:144:Times:one  with  an  incorrect  response—and  then  gives  the  subject  the  opportunity  to  practice  two  
87:2805:220413:20:0:71:414:89:144:Times:144:Times:choices on her own. After practice ends, the task lasts for two minutes.

88:2807:220544:30:21:89:543:678:144:Times:144:Times:Data Appendix Table 3 provides reassurance that, a priori, there is little reason to think that 
88:2808:220640:21:21:71:544:657:144:Times:144:Times:low  survey  effort  per  se could  contribute  to  a  mechanical  correlation  between  worse  financial  
88:2809:220746:21:21:71:545:636:144:Times:144:Times:condition  and  more  behavioral  biases.  A  necessary  condition  for  that  confound  is  that  it  is  
88:2810:220853:21:20:71:546:615:144:Times:144:Times:somehow  easier,  from  a  survey  effort  perspective,  to  indicate  worse  than  better  financial  
88:2811:220956:20:21:71:543:595:144:Times:144:Times:condition. The table shows that this is unlikely to be the case, given how questions are scripted 
88:2812:221054:21:31:71:237:574:144:Times:144:Times:and response options are arrayed.  
88:2813:221089:31:20:89:542:543:144:Times:144:Times:Data Appendix Table 4 provides some additional descriptive reassurance with data, showing 
88:2814:221179:20:21:71:543:523:144:Times:144:Times:a lack of systematic relationship between survey time spent (across all questions for both Round 
88:2815:221276:21:21:71:545:502:144:Times:144:Times:1  modules)  and  financial  condition  responses,  with  the  possible  exception of  the  lowest  time
