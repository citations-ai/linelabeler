2:20:446:24:14:306:310:471:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:C: 
2:21:446:14:12:126:489:457:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:From 1735 to 1751, the Board of Trustees of the Province of Georgia imposed 
2:22:517:12:12:126:489:445:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:the only ban on slavery among the North American colonies. Exploiting the 
2:23:591:12:12:126:489:433:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:historical boundary  between  the  88 counties  of Trustee Georgia  and  the  71 
2:24:670:12:12:126:489:421:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:counties that were appended to the colony after 1751, I analyze the effects of 
2:25:748:12:12:126:489:409:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:this   initial   institutional   difference on   subsequent   differences   in   slave 
2:26:834:12:12:126:489:397:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:dependence, land inequality, income, and poverty.  I find that counties that 
2:27:911:12:12:126:489:385:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:had  been covered  by  the  initial  Trustee  ban subsequently had  lower  slave 
2:28:991:12:12:126:490:373:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:population density, fewer farms holding more than 10 slaves, and higher income 
2:29:1069:12:12:126:489:361:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:and lower poverty rates today.  I further find that while counties affected by 
2:30:1147:12:12:126:490:349:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:the ban did not have significant differences in pre-Civil War land inequality, 
2:31:1223:12:12:126:489:337:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:productivity,   industrial   development, or educational investment,   their 
2:32:1299:12:12:126:489:325:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:economic output was significantly more diversified and less reliant upon the 
2:33:1376:12:12:126:490:313:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:production of cash crops.  Finally, I demonstrate that controlling for pre-war 
2:34:1455:12:12:126:489:301:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:output diversification significantly reduces the estimated relationship between 
2:35:1535:12:12:126:489:289:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Trusteeship and current income.  Results therefore suggest that the effects of 
2:36:1614:12:12:126:489:277:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:initial differences in labor institutions can persist even where those differences 
2:37:1696:12:12:126:489:265:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:are not determined by geography, and that a primary channel of persistence is 
2:38:1772:12:12:126:390:253:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:the path-dependence of early economic specialization.

3:47:1905:24:24:108:112:658:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A: 
3:48:1905:24:24:108:526:634:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:A large and growing academic literature, building on the work of Engerman and Sokoloff 
3:49:1990:24:24:90:525:610:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:(1997, 2002, 2006), has demonstrated that historical instances of forced labor systems generated 
3:50:2086:24:24:90:525:586:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:persistent,  negative effects  on  contemporary  economic  outcomes  (Nunn  2008;  Dell  2010; 
3:51:2180:24:24:90:525:562:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Acemoglu,  García-Jimeno, and  Robinson 2012).   In  the original Engerman  and  Sokoloff 
3:52:2269:24:24:90:525:538:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:hypothesis, coercive labor institutions were historically more likely to emerge where geographic 
3:53:2363:24:24:90:525:514:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:conditions were particularly suited to production activities exhibiting economies of scale which 
3:54:2457:24:24:90:525:490:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:could be most profitably conducted using large-scale forced labor, and these institutions in turn 
3:55:2554:24:24:90:525:466:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:had negative effects on long-run development.  Though Engerman and Sokoloff hypothesized 
3:56:2642:24:24:90:525:442:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:that  initial  economic  inequality  was  the  primary  mechanism  by  which slavery adversely 
3:57:2736:24:24:90:525:418:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:affected long-run economic outcomes, subsequent research has emphasized political inequality, 
3:58:2830:24:24:90:525:394:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:differences  in  land  tenure  systems,  and  the  provision  of  public  goods  as  important 
3:59:2925:24:24:90:525:370:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:intermediating channels  of  institutional  persistence  (Acemoglu,  Bautista,  Querubín, and 
3:60:3019:24:24:90:326:346:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Robinson 2007; Dell 2010, Iyer 2010; Ager 2013).   
3:61:3069:24:24:108:525:322:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:In this paper I exploit institutional discontinuity within a single political entity to more 
3:62:3160:24:24:90:525:298:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:precisely identify the potential channels through which slavery influenced long-run economic 
3:63:3251:24:24:90:525:274:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:outcomes, and also to evaluate whether initial differences in coercive labor institutions persist 
3:64:3347:24:24:90:525:250:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:even where those differences were not geographically determined. From 1735—three years after 
3:65:3439:24:24:90:526:226:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:its  founding—until  1751, the North American Province  of  Georgia, including 88  of  the 159 
3:66:3532:24:24:90:525:202:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:counties constituting the modern state of Georgia, prohibited the selling, purchase, or owning 
3:67:3626:24:24:90:526:178:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:of slaves. The ban was not the decision of the colonists themselves, but rather was exogenously 
3:68:3717:24:24:90:525:154:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:imposed by a Board of Trustees in London. Concerned that slavery would give rise to an idle 
3:69:3808:24:24:90:525:130:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:and  decadent aristocratic  elite,  the  Board  maintained  the  ban  until  pressure  from  colonial 
3:70:3910:24:0:90:525:106:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:lobbyists forced its repeal in 1751.  In contrast, slavery was never prohibited during the colonial 
4:71:4010:0:24:90:525:682:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:period in the remaining 71 counties of the modern state of Georgia, which were formally added 
4:72:4104:24:24:90:193:658:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:to the colony in 1763. 
4:73:4126:24:24:108:525:634:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:I therefore employ a regression discontinuity approach to estimate average differences in 
4:74:4215:24:24:90:526:610:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:long-run economic outcomes in Georgian counties affected by the initial Trustee ban on slavery 
4:75:4310:24:24:90:525:586:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:versus  long-run  outcomes  in  contiguous  border  counties  that  were  unaffected  by  the ban, 
4:76:4409:24:24:90:526:562:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:controlling for a comprehensive set of observable geographic characteristics.  Whereas previous 
4:77:4504:24:24:90:525:538:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:studies have included slave density—which is likely correlated with other, unobservable district 
4:78:4601:24:24:90:525:514:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:characteristics which are in turn correlated with differential long-run economic outcomes—as 
4:79:4693:24:24:90:525:490:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:an  independent  variable,  in  this  paper  I  exploit county  inclusion  in  Trustee  Georgia as  an 
4:80:4796:24:24:90:526:466:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:exogenously determined “intention-to-treat” with  subsequently  lower slave  intensity,  with 
4:81:4886:24:24:90:482:442:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:contiguously paired non-Trustee counties constituting the untreated control group.   
4:82:4970:24:24:108:525:418:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:I find that relative to contiguous non-Trustee counties, in 2010 median household income 
4:83:5057:24:24:90:525:394:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:was 11.3% higher in  former Trustee counties, and the poverty rate 2.091 percentage points 
4:84:5147:24:24:90:525:370:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:lower.  I  also  find  that  by  1860,  the  ratio  of  slaves  to  total  county  population  was  10.5 
4:85:5252:24:24:90:525:346:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:percentage points lower in former Trustee counties, versus in contiguous non-Trustee counties, 
4:86:5347:24:24:90:525:322:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:and that the percentage of farms holding more than 10 slaves was 6.2 percentage points lower 
4:87:5440:24:24:90:525:298:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:in  former  Trustee  counties,  versus in contiguous non-Trustee  counties.  I  further  find  that 
4:88:5540:24:24:90:526:274:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:including slave density in 1860 as an explanatory variable attenuates the estimated relationship 
4:89:5636:24:24:90:525:250:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:between  Trusteeship  and  2010  income and  yields  a  large,  negative  estimated  coefficient  on 
4:90:5736:24:24:90:525:226:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:slave density, which suggests that the positive effect of Trusteeship on long-run development 
4:91:5830:24:24:90:413:202:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:can be accounted for by its large effect on subsequent slave intensity. 
4:92:5900:24:24:108:525:178:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Exploring possible channels of persistence, I find that by 1860, the cash crop share of total 
4:93:5993:24:24:90:525:154:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:crop output by value was 3.7 percentage points lower in Trustee counties than in contiguous 
4:94:6083:24:24:90:525:130:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:non-Trustee border counties.  Similarly, by 1860, the average Herfindahl index score of output 
4:95:6178:24:0:90:526:106:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:by  category  in  Trustee  counties  was  0.021  points  lower  than  in  contiguous  non-Trustee 
5:96:6277:0:24:90:525:682:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:counties, indicating that Trustee county economies were significantly more diversified by the 
5:97:6370:24:24:90:525:658:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:eve of the Civil War than non-Trustee counties. In particular, per capita production of orchard, 
5:98:6467:24:24:90:525:634:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:market garden, homemade manufactures, and livestock was $105.14 higher in Trustee versus 
5:99:6555:24:24:90:525:610:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:non-Trustee counties.  Moreover, including Herfindahl score and cash crop share of total crop 
5:100:6649:24:24:90:525:586:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:output  in  1860  as  explanatory  variables  attenuates  the  estimated  relationship  between 
5:101:6745:24:24:90:526:562:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Trusteeship and 2010 income and yields large, negative estimated coefficients on both variables. 
5:102:6841:24:24:108:525:538:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:I  further  find  that  land  inequality  was  no  greater  by 1784  or  1860  in  Trustee  versus 
5:103:6939:24:24:90:525:514:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:contiguous non-Trustee counties, and that by 1860 Trusteeship had exhibited no effect on the 
5:104:7031:24:24:90:525:490:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:number of manufacturing establishments nor the volume of capital invested in manufacturing, 
5:105:7123:24:24:90:525:466:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:no effect on differences in rail and water transport links, no effect on school enrollment or the 
5:106:7221:24:24:90:525:442:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:number  of  educational  institutions,  no  effect  on  per  capita  productivity,  and  a  negative 
5:107:7322:24:24:90:525:418:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:estimated effect on per capita wealth.  The adult literacy rate, however, was 3.8 percentage 
5:108:7415:24:24:90:525:394:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:points higher before the Civil War in Trustee counties versus contiguous non-Trustee counties, 
5:109:7509:24:24:90:526:370:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:and in the aftermath of the Civil War, sharecropping was a significantly less prevalent form of 
5:110:7604:24:24:90:399:346:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:farm tenancy in Trustee versus contiguous non-Trustee counties.   
5:111:7668:24:24:108:525:322:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:The results of this paper therefore lend additional support to the hypothesis that slavery 
5:112:7757:24:24:90:525:298:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:had a persistent, negative effect on long-run economic development, and furthermore provide 
5:113:7848:24:24:90:525:274:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:new evidence  that  greater  dependence  on  cash  crops  and  lower  diversification  of  economic 
5:114:7947:24:24:90:525:250:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:output were important channels through which slavery affected long-run outcomes.  Results 
5:115:8037:24:24:90:525:226:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:also indicate that initial economic inequality and the provision of public goods, particularly 
5:116:8129:24:24:90:525:202:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:public schooling, were not channels through which slavery affected long-run outcomes, though 
5:117:8222:24:24:90:525:178:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:literacy specifically  and post-Civil  War  differences  in  land  tenure  were  associated  with 
5:118:8319:24:24:90:525:154:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:differences in long-run economic outcomes.  More broadly, the results presented in this paper 
5:119:8411:24:0:90:525:130:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:suggest  that  initial  differences  in  coercive  labor  institutions  can  persist  even  where  those 
6:120:8517:0:24:90:525:682:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:differences were not shaped by geography, and that a primary mechanism of that persistence 
6:121:8608:24:24:90:481:658:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:is simply the path dependence of economic specialization in commodity production.  
6:122:8690:24:24:108:525:634:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:The  organization  of  the  remainder  of this  paper  is  thus  as  follows.  Section  2  provides 
6:123:8789:24:24:90:525:610:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:historical background on the creation  of the Province of  Georgia and  the period  of Trustee 
6:124:8884:24:24:90:525:586:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:rule.  Section  3 details  the  data  sources  used  for  the  analysis,  while  Section  4 describes  the 
6:125:8990:24:24:90:423:562:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:empirical approach.  Section 5 presents results and Section 6 concludes.

6:129:9078:24:24:108:525:466:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:The Province of Georgia was the last English colony founded in North America.  Following 
6:130:9167:24:24:90:525:442:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:a  lengthy  application  process,  in  June  1732 King George  II  granted  to  James  Oglethorpe, 
6:131:9266:24:24:90:525:418:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:retired  general  and  Member  of  Parliament,  along  with twenty  other English trustees, a 
6:132:9358:24:24:90:525:394:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:corporate charter to establish a new colony, investing them with the powers to elect their own 
6:133:9452:24:24:90:525:370:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:governing Board of Trustees, make land grants, and enact their own laws and taxes. Carved 
6:134:9540:24:24:90:525:346:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:out of the unsettled and largely unexplored borderlands of the older royal Province of South 
6:135:9633:24:24:90:525:322:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Carolina, which  had  previously  encompassed all  of  the  territory  of  the  present-day state  of 
6:136:9735:24:20:90:277:298:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Georgia, the new colony was to include: 
6:137:9774:20:12:108:506:278:9:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f6:F:“all  those lands,  countries  and  territories  lying  and  being  in  that  part  of  South  Carolina,  in 
6:138:9883:12:12:108:507:266:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:America,  which  lies  from  the  most  northern  part  of  a  stream  or  river  commonly  called  the 
6:139:9987:12:12:108:506:254:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:Savannah, all along the sea coast to the southward, unto the most southern stream of a certain 
6:140:10082:12:12:108:507:242:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:other great water or river called the Altamaha; and westerly from the heads of the said rivers 
6:141:10177:12:12:108:507:230:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:respectively, in direct lines to the south seas, and all that shore, circuit and precinct of lands 
6:142:10275:12:22:108:324:218:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:within the said boundaries” (Georgia Charter 1732) 
6:143:10324:22:24:108:507:196:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:As  the  trustees  themselves  possessed  no  firsthand  knowledge  of  the  new  territories, 
6:144:10419:24:24:90:507:172:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:their vision for the colony was largely based on second- and third-hand accounts of varying 
6:145:10510:24:24:90:507:148:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:accuracy (Wood 2007).  The northern boundary of the Savannah River was thus chosen 
6:146:10589:24:24:90:507:124:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:for  the  simple  reason  that it had  previously  constituted  the  southern  limit  of  English 
6:147:10686:24:0:90:507:100:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:settlement, following an agreement between South Carolina and the native Creek tribes at 
7:148:10775:0:24:90:507:682:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:the end of the Yamasee War of 1715-17 (Paulett 2012).  The choice of the Altamaha River 
7:149:10862:24:24:90:507:658:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:as the province’s southern boundary, meanwhile, owed primarily to the prior existence of 
7:150:10950:24:24:90:507:634:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:a fort, Fort King George, at the river’s coastal mouth, and to a strategic desire to leave an 
7:151:11043:24:24:90:508:610:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:unoccupied  neutral  buffer  zone  between  the new province’s southern  border  and  the 
7:152:11132:24:24:90:508:586:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:northern  border  of  Spanish  Florida along  the  St.  Marys  River.    These  borders then 
7:153:11222:24:24:90:507:562:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:remained unchanged until 1763, when further territorial concessions following the Seven 
7:154:11309:24:24:90:508:538:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Years’ War,  again by  the  Creeks, at  the  Treaty  of  Augusta extended the  province’s 
7:155:11395:24:24:90:507:514:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:southern border from the Altamaha to the St. Marys River, where the territory formerly 
7:156:11481:24:24:90:507:490:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:nominally claimed by the Province of South Carolina bordered Florida, and its western to 
7:157:11569:24:24:90:508:466:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:the  Chattahoochee  River, thereby incorporating  all  of  the present-day  state  of  Georgia 
7:158:11663:24:24:90:160:442:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:(Miller 2011).  
7:159:11678:24:24:108:507:418:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:In establishing the Province of Georgia, named in honor of George II, the trustees were 
7:160:11766:24:24:90:507:394:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:motivated first and foremost by a desire to promote “a Christian, moral and industrious 
7:161:11854:24:24:90:507:370:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:way  of  life,” which  they  believed  would  create “a simple  and stable  society  made  up  of 
7:162:11951:24:24:90:507:346:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:contented citizens,” living “by labour ... a comfortable subsistence.”  With this aim in mind, 
7:163:12044:24:24:90:507:322:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:they were determined  to  avoid  the  emergence  of  a  planter  aristocracy  as  existed  in 
7:164:12136:24:24:90:507:298:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:neighboring South Carolina, which they believed degraded white manners and morals.  The 
7:165:12224:24:24:90:507:274:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:trustees were by no means abolitionists, but rather opponents of the extreme inequalities 
7:166:12313:24:24:90:507:250:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:of  plantation  economies  which,  in  their  view,  encouraged “idleness” and “luxury” among 
7:167:12405:24:24:90:507:226:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:aristocratic white society.  Such idleness and luxury, they felt, was as morally corrupting 
7:168:12496:24:24:90:507:202:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:as the “idleness and necessity” of grinding poverty, escape from which they hoped the new 
7:169:12585:24:24:90:481:178:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:colony would offer the poor, “miserable wretches” of Great Britain (Wood 2007).      
7:170:12664:24:24:108:507:154:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:It  was  thus  in an  effort  to  prevent such  extreme  inequality, which  they  viewed  as 
7:171:12756:24:24:90:507:130:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:morally corrupting, that in 1734 the trustees drafted legislation to prohibit the institution 
7:172:12850:24:0:90:507:106:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:of slavery within the province, receiving royal assent in 1735.  Though the ban subsequently 
8:173:12943:0:24:90:507:682:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:received  opposition from  many of  the  province’s  colonists,  particularly  among  lowland 
8:174:13036:24:24:90:507:658:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Scottish  settlers  near  Savannah,  it  remained  in  place  and  enforced  until proponents  of 
8:175:13134:24:24:90:507:634:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:legalization effectively lobbied Parliament directly for repeal of the ban (Coleman 2006; 
8:176:13223:24:24:90:507:610:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Wood 2007; Reese 2010).  From 1 January, 1751, therefore, slavery became legal in all of 
8:177:13312:24:24:90:507:586:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:the Province of Georgia, as it had remained legal since 1735 in those regions which would 
8:178:13401:24:24:90:507:562:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:become part of the colony following the boundary changes in the aftermath of the Seven 
8:179:13487:24:24:90:507:538:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Years’ War.  The following year, having failed to secure a new government subsidy upon 
8:180:13572:24:24:90:507:514:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:expiration of its 20-year charter, Trustee rule in Georgia came to an end, such that from 
8:181:13662:24:36:90:419:490:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:May 1752 the province officially became a crown colony (Reese 2010).

8:185:13912:24:24:90:526:370:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:determined by the text of the Royal Charter of  1732, which  granted the province all lands 
8:186:14000:24:24:90:525:346:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:lying between  the  Savannah  and  Altamaha  Rivers,  up  to  their  headwaters and  extending 
8:187:14095:24:24:90:522:322:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:westward “sea to sea.”1 The territories now comprising the remaining counties of the present-
8:188:14187:24:24:90:525:298:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:day state of Georgia, likewise formerly territories of the Province of South Carolina, were then 
8:189:14283:24:24:90:526:274:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:incorporated into the colony in 1763.  My analysis uses two distinct samples: a sample of all 
8:190:14373:24:24:90:525:250:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Georgian counties and a subset sample of contiguous border counties exploiting the original

9:219:16973:24:24:108:525:202:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Data on the number of farms by farm size is also available from the 1860 census, though 
9:220:17061:24:24:90:525:178:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:for  county-level  land  Gini  coefficients  I  use  coefficients  constructed  by  Nunn  (2008).    In

9:223:17349:24:0:90:525:106:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:land grant records no longer exist, the first post-colonial survey, in 1784, is included in the 
10:224:17446:0:24:90:532:682:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:index, listing the name of the person for whom the land was surveyed and the number of acres.   
10:225:17539:24:24:90:525:658:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:The  1784  survey  covers  36  counties, for  which  I  am  therefore  able  to  construct  land  Gini

10:227:17737:24:24:90:528:610:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:counties, there are an insufficient number of contiguous border county pairs for subset analysis.

10:231:17995:36:24:108:526:490:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:The empirical approach is based on estimating average differences in long-run economic 
10:232:18081:24:24:90:525:466:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:outcomes in Georgian counties covered by the initial Trustee ban on slavery, versus long-run 
10:233:18171:24:24:90:525:442:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:outcomes in counties that were unaffected by the ban.  The baseline cross-sectional estimating 
10:234:18263:24:24:90:187:418:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:equation is therefore 
10:235:18284:24:24:225:526:394:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Yc = α + βTrust + Xcꞌδ + εc             (1) 
10:236:18316:24:24:90:525:370:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:where Yc is the outcome variable of interest for county c; Trust is an indicator variable equal 
10:237:18409:24:24:90:522:346:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:to 1 if county c was part of Trustee Georgia and equal to 0 otherwise; Xc is a vector of county-
10:238:18501:24:24:90:525:322:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:level covariates that includes geographic center latitude and longitude, primary area-weighted 
10:239:18593:24:24:90:526:298:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:soil  classification, county  land  and  water  surface  area, mean  annual temperature  and 
10:240:18686:24:24:90:525:274:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:precipitation, and  mean  elevation;  and εc is  an  error  term  encompassing  all  other  omitted 
10:241:18785:24:24:90:247:250:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:factors, with E(εc) = 0 for all c.   
10:242:18821:24:24:108:525:226:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Because it is possible that there were other, unobservable county characteristics that were 
10:243:18913:24:24:90:525:202:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:correlated both with initial  Trusteeship and  subsequent differences  in  observed  outcomes,  I 
10:244:19009:24:24:90:525:178:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:also  employ  a  regression  discontinuity  approach to  estimate  average  differences  in  long-run 
10:245:19111:24:24:90:525:154:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:economic outcomes in Georgian counties covered by the initial Trustee ban on slavery versus 
10:246:19202:24:0:90:525:130:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:long-run outcomes in contiguous border counties that were unaffected by the ban.  Exploiting 
11:247:19296:0:24:90:525:682:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:this sharp spatial discontinuity at each county border, I therefore estimate a modified version 
11:248:19392:24:24:90:217:658:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:of equation (1) of the form 
11:249:19419:24:24:211:526:634:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Ycb = α + βTrust + Xcꞌδ + φb + εcb                      (2) 
11:250:19463:24:24:90:525:610:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:where Ycb is the outcome variable of interest for county c along contiguous border county pair 
11:251:19556:24:24:90:525:586:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:b; Trust is again an indicator variable equal to 1 if county c was part of Trustee Georgia and 
11:252:19649:24:24:90:525:562:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:equal to 0 otherwise; Xc is a vector of county-level covariates that includes geographic center 
11:253:19744:24:24:90:525:538:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:latitude and longitude, primary area-weighted soil classification, county land and water surface 
11:254:19839:24:24:90:525:514:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:area, mean annual temperature and precipitation, and mean elevation; φb is a set of contiguous 
11:255:19933:24:24:90:525:490:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:county pair-specific time fixed effects, and εcb is an error term.2  Because they generally share 
11:256:20029:24:24:90:526:466:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:similar geographic,  cultural,  and  economic covariates,  contiguous  border  counties  offer  a 
11:257:20125:24:24:90:525:442:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:plausible control group.  The identifying assumption is thus that E(Trust, εcb) = 0, that is, 
11:258:20217:24:24:90:525:418:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:that  assignment  to  Trustee  Georgia  within  each contiguously adjacent  county  pair  is 
11:259:20310:24:24:90:403:394:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:uncorrelated with differences in outcome residuals in either county. 
11:260:20378:24:24:108:525:370:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:The advantage of including the variable for Trusteeship in lieu of slave density—as previous 
11:261:20471:24:24:90:525:346:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:studies  have  done—as  an  independent  variable  is  that  it serves as a  plausibly  exogenous 
11:262:20567:24:24:90:526:322:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:intention-to-treat instrument.  The acquisition of slaves constituted a substantial fixed capital 
11:263:20664:24:24:90:525:298:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:investment,  such  that  plantation  production  relying  on  slave  labor  exhibited  declining  unit 
11:264:20767:24:24:90:525:274:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:costs  and  increasing  returns  to  scale, which can  generate  path  dependence  as  early  volume 
11:265:20868:24:24:90:525:250:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:leaders  retain  a  cost  advantage  (Anderson  and  Gallman  1977).3  Exogenous  assignment to 
11:266:20964:24:24:90:522:226:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Trustee Georgia, with its initial 16-year ban on slavery, therefore offers a valid intention-to-
11:267:21059:24:37:90:525:202:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:treat with the treatment of lower subsequent slave intensity.  Nonetheless, to examine whether 
11:268:21154:37:10:90:236:165:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:C:                                                           
11:269:21212:10:15:108:519:155:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:2 Note that Ycb and εcb indicate that counties may be repeated for all contiguous border pairs that 
11:270:21309:15:9:90:169:140:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:they are a part of. 
11:271:21328:9:15:108:525:131:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:3 An additional reason for assignment to Trustee Georgia to exert a persistent effect on subsequent 
11:272:21426:15:12:90:525:116:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:slave intensity is that after reaching a century low in the 1740s, the price of slaves in the deep South 
11:273:21531:12:12:90:525:104:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:rose  sharply  after  the  1750s,  placing  new  entrants  into  labor-intensive  agriculture at  a  distinct  cost 
11:274:21646:12:0:90:423:92:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:disadvantage to existing slaveholders (Mancall, Rosenbloom, and Weisss 2001). 
12:275:21724:0:24:90:525:682:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:this is the case, I also estimate modifications of Eqs. (1) and (2) for current income and poverty 
12:276:21823:24:24:90:372:658:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:rate, including slave population density in 1860, of the form: 
12:277:21885:24:24:218:526:634:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Yc = α + βTrust + γSc/Lc + Xcꞌδ + εc                (3) 
12:278:21928:24:24:90:110:610:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:and 
12:279:21931:24:24:200:526:586:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Ycb = α + βTrust + γSc/Lc + Xcꞌδ + φb + εcb                    (4) 
12:280:21983:24:24:90:525:562:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:where Sc/Lc is the proportion of slaves in the total population in county c.  If assignment to 
12:281:22077:24:24:90:525:538:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Trustee Georgia affects long-run outcomes only through its effect on subsequent slave intensity, 
12:282:22171:24:24:90:525:514:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:then  controlling for slave  density should  significantly  reduce  any estimated  relationship 
12:283:22264:24:24:90:247:490:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:between Trusteeship and income. 
12:284:22293:24:24:108:525:466:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:The primary potential threat to identification is that county assignment to Trustee Georgia 
12:285:22385:24:24:90:525:442:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:is in  fact correlated  with  other,  unobservable  variables  that  are in  turn correlated  with 
12:286:22482:24:24:90:525:418:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:differential long-run economic outcomes.  This might be the case if 1) additional, unobservable 
12:287:22578:24:24:90:525:394:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:county-level geographic characteristics are both correlated with differential outcomes and vary 
12:288:22674:24:24:90:525:370:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:systematically  across  the discontinuity  threshold;  2) unobservable  settler  characteristics, 
12:289:22772:24:24:90:525:346:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:including  culture,  vary  systematically  across  the discontinuity  threshold and  are  correlated 
12:290:22872:24:24:90:525:322:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:with  differential  outcomes;  or  3)  the  Trustee  boundary  coincides  with  additional  policy 
12:291:22971:24:24:90:445:298:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:discontinuities that are also correlated with differential long-run outcomes.   
12:292:23049:24:24:108:525:274:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Though including  the  listed  geographic  control variables and restricting  the  analysis  to 
12:293:23142:24:24:90:525:250:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:border counties and exploiting contiguously paired counties as a control group should attenuate 
12:294:23238:24:24:90:525:226:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:all three potential sources of omitted variable bias, there are additional historical reasons why 
12:295:23336:24:24:90:525:202:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:omitted variable bias should not pose a threat to identification.  First, the provincial boundary 
12:296:23434:24:24:90:525:178:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:was exogenously imposed on the colony by Parliament and the Trustees in England, none of 
12:297:23523:24:24:90:525:154:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:whom had visited the region nor possessed accurate knowledge of its geographic characteristics. 
12:298:23619:24:24:90:525:130:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:To bound the new political entity, the drafters of the 1732 charter thus simply relied on the 
12:299:23713:24:0:90:428:106:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:known locations of two regional rivers, the Savannah and the Altamaha. 
13:300:23785:0:24:108:525:682:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Second, discontinuity in settler characteristics would require both that those who settled 
13:301:23876:24:24:90:525:658:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:in  the Province  of  Georgia  between  1732  and  1752  differed  systematically  from  those  who 
13:302:23975:24:24:90:526:634:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:settled contemporaneously in those counties which were not part of Georgia province between 
13:303:24067:24:24:90:525:610:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:1732 and 1752, and that these differences at the discontinuity threshold could persist through 
13:304:24162:24:24:90:525:586:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:subsequent waves of immigration and population growth.  There is no historical evidence that 
13:305:24255:24:24:90:525:562:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:this was the case.  Moreover, far from possessing any moral or cultural hostility toward the 
13:306:24348:24:24:90:525:538:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:institution of slavery that may have differed from views held by settlers on the other side of 
13:307:24443:24:24:90:525:514:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:the discontinuity threshold, the settlers of Trustee Georgia aggressively and repeatedly lobbied 
13:308:24538:24:24:90:525:490:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:the Board of Trustees for repeal of the ban almost from the province’s inception.  The initial 
13:309:24633:24:24:90:525:466:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:ban was not a choice of the settlers themselves, but was rather imposed upon them by the 
13:310:24722:24:24:90:259:442:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Trustees in London (Wood, 2007).   
13:311:24756:24:24:108:525:418:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Third, both Trustee and non-Trustee Georgia were formerly unsettled and un-administered 
13:312:24844:24:24:90:522:394:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f12:B:territory of the Province of South Carolina, inhabited by the same Native American tribes—
13:313:24933:24:24:90:525:370:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:principally  the  Creek,  Yamacraw,  and  Cherokee  tribes—whose  territorial  concessions 
13:314:25024:24:24:90:525:346:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:constituted  both  the  original  province  as  well  as  those  non-Trustee  regions  that  were 
13:315:25122:24:24:90:525:322:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:incorporated into the colony in 1763.  From 1763, both the former Trustee and non-Trustee 
13:316:25212:24:24:90:525:298:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:counties were part of the same colony of Georgia and subsequently state of Georgia.  Therefore, 
13:317:25308:24:24:90:525:274:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:there should be no additional policy discontinuities that coincide with the Trustee boundary 
13:318:25399:24:36:90:332:250:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:and correlate with differential long-run outcomes.

14:328:26176:24:24:90:522:586:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:county population was 10.5 percentage points lower in former Trustee counties, versus non-
14:329:26265:24:24:90:525:562:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Trustee counties.  Figure 2 plots estimated coefficients (β’s from Eq. (1)) for average differences 
14:330:26365:24:24:90:525:538:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:in slave population density in Trustee vs. non-Trustee counties for each decennial census year 
14:331:26460:24:24:90:525:514:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:from 1790 to 1860.   For every census year before the Civil War, slave population density was 
14:332:26554:24:24:90:525:490:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:lower in counties that had been affected by the Trustee ban on slavery, compared to counties 
14:333:26647:24:24:90:248:466:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:that were unaffected by the ban.  
14:334:26680:24:24:108:528:442:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Trusteeship was also associated with a lower fraction of farms holding more than 10 slaves.  
14:335:26772:24:24:90:525:418:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Estimated coefficients reported in column 2, panel A of Table 1 reveal that the percentage of 
14:336:26865:24:24:90:526:394:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:farms holding more than 10 slaves was 8.1 percentage points lower in former Trustee counties, 
14:337:26959:24:24:90:525:370:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:relative to in non-Trustee counties.  Analyzing the border county sub-sample, the estimated 
14:338:27051:24:24:90:525:346:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:coefficient  reported  in  column  2,  panel  B  indicates  that  by  1860,  the  percentage  of  farms 
14:339:27155:24:24:90:525:322:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:holding more than 10 slaves was a non-statistically significant 6.2 percentage points lower in 
14:340:27250:24:24:90:341:298:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:former Trustee counties, versus non-Trustee counties. 
14:341:27303:24:24:108:525:274:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Estimated coefficients reported in columns 3 and 4 of Table 1 also reveal that Trusteeship 
14:342:27394:24:24:90:525:250:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:was  strongly  associated  with  long-run  differences  in  median  household  income  and  poverty 
14:343:27494:24:24:90:525:226:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:rates.  Relative to non-Trustee counties, by 2010 median household income was 14.1% higher 
14:344:27584:24:24:90:525:202:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:in former Trustee counties, and the poverty rate 4.091 percentage points lower.  Restricting 
14:345:27677:24:24:90:525:178:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:the analysis to the border-county sample, estimated coefficients reported in columns 3 and 4, 
14:346:27771:24:24:90:525:154:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:panel B indicate that by 2010 median household income was 11.3% higher in former Trustee 
14:347:27860:24:0:90:509:130:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:counties, versus non-Trustee counties, and the poverty rate 2.783 percentage points lower.

15:350:28135:24:24:90:525:634:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:sample (panel A) and border county sub-sample (panel B) are reported in Table 2.  Estimated 
15:351:28227:24:24:90:525:610:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:coefficients  reported  in  column  1  indicate  that  including  slave  density  as  an  independent 
15:352:28329:24:24:90:525:586:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:variable significantly reduces estimated coefficients for Trustee status.  The estimated effect of 
15:353:28428:24:24:90:522:562:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Trustee  status  on  current  income  declines  from  a  statistically  significant  14.1%  to  a  non-
15:354:28531:24:24:90:525:538:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:statistically  significant  4.9%,  in  the  main  sample,  and  from  11.3%  to a  non-statistically 
15:355:28632:24:24:90:525:514:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:significant 4.4% in the border county sub-sample.  Estimated coefficients reported in column 
15:356:28725:24:24:90:525:490:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:2 also reveal that the estimated effect of Trustee status on current poverty rates declines in 
15:357:28818:24:24:90:525:466:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:magnitude from -4.091 percentage points to -3.106 percentage points, in the main sample, and 
15:358:28911:24:24:90:525:442:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:from -2.783 percentage points to a non-statistically significant -2.025 percentage points in the 
15:359:29008:24:24:90:525:418:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:border county sub-sample.  Meanwhile, the estimated effect of a 1-percentage point increase in 
15:360:29102:24:24:90:525:394:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:slave density (Sc/Lc), is 25.8% lower median household income in  2010 (30.6% lower in  the 
15:361:29190:24:24:90:525:370:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:border  county  sub-sample),  and  a  5.432-percentage  point  higher poverty  rate  (10.316 
15:362:29283:24:24:90:525:346:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:percentage points in the border county sub-sample).  Results presented in Table 2 therefore 
15:363:29375:24:24:90:525:322:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:strongly suggest that the estimated relationship between Trusteeship and long-run economic 
15:364:29466:24:24:90:525:298:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:development  can  be  accounted  for by  the  relationship  between Trusteeship and subsequent 
15:365:29561:24:24:90:162:274:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:slave intensity. 
15:366:29577:24:24:108:525:250:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Results reported in Table 3, however, suggest that while by 1900 Trustee counties were on 
15:367:29666:24:24:90:525:226:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:average wealthier than non-Trustee counties—by an estimated $6,202.80 per person—by the 
15:368:29754:24:24:90:522:202:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:eve  of  the  Civil  War,  in  1860, Trustee  counties  were  no  more  or  less  developed than  non-
15:369:29854:24:24:90:525:178:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Trustee counties.  Analyzing the main sample of all Georgian counties reveals, as reported in 
15:370:29947:24:24:90:525:154:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:column 1, that wealth per capita was no higher in Trustee versus non-Trustee counties, and, 
15:371:30038:24:24:90:525:130:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:in fact, restricting the analysis to the border county sub-sample reveals that wealth per capita 
15:372:30135:24:0:90:525:106:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:was lower in Trustee versus non-Trustee counties, by $274.36 per person. Output per capita 
16:373:30228:0:24:90:525:682:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:in  1860 was  also  no  higher  or  lower  in  Trustee  versus  non-Trustee  counties,  as  reported  in 
16:374:30333:24:24:90:526:658:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:column 2.  Likewise, estimated coefficients reported in columns 3 and 4 of Table 3 indicate 
16:375:30424:24:24:90:529:634:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:that Trustee counties were by 1860 no more or less likely to have water or rail transport links.  
16:376:30522:24:24:90:525:610:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Estimated coefficients reported in columns 5 and 6 also indicate that Trustee counties did not 
16:377:30616:24:24:90:525:586:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:have  more  manufacturing  establishments,  nor  a  larger  volume  of  capital  invested  in 
16:378:30710:24:24:90:294:562:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:manufacturing, than non-Trustee counties.  
16:379:30752:24:24:108:526:538:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Results presented in Tables 1, 2, and 3 therefore strongly indicate that belonging to Trustee 
16:380:30846:24:24:90:525:514:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Georgia had a significant, positive effect on income and negative effect on poverty rates over 
16:381:30941:24:24:90:525:490:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:the  very  long  run,  and  that  these  relationships  are  largely  accounted  for  by  the  effect  of 
16:382:31047:24:24:90:525:466:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Trusteeship on subsequent slave density.  Results further suggest that significant divergence 
16:383:31141:24:24:90:526:442:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:in development between Trustee and non-Trustee counties did not occur before the Civil War.

16:388:31365:24:24:90:522:322:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:there are many potential channels through which belonging to Trustee Georgia affected long-

16:390:31548:24:24:90:525:274:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:of slavery and development, and of which available historical data permits analysis.  These are 
16:391:31644:24:24:90:525:250:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:inequality in land ownership, land tenure, provision of public goods, specifically education, and 
16:392:31742:24:24:90:525:226:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:economic diversification.  Results suggest that Trusteeship did not have a significant long-run 
16:393:31838:24:24:90:525:202:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:effect  on  land  inequality,  nor  on  the  provision  of  formal  schooling.    Results  do,  however, 
16:394:31943:24:24:90:526:178:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:indicate that Trusteeship had a strong, positive long-run effect on non-slave adult literacy and 
16:395:32040:24:24:90:525:154:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:diversification  of  economic  output,  and  a  strong,  negative  long-run  effect  on  cash  crop

17:401:32541:24:24:90:525:586:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Trusteeship had no effect on the number of colleges, public schools, or academies, and no effect 
17:402:32638:24:24:90:525:562:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:on school enrollment rate.  The estimated coefficient reported in column 1, panel A, however, 
17:403:32732:24:24:90:525:538:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:reveals that relative to non-Trustee counties, the rate of adult illiteracy in Trustee counties 
17:404:32827:24:24:90:522:514:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:was 8.8 percentage points lower in 1850.  Restricting the analysis to the border county sub-
17:405:32919:24:24:90:526:490:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:sample (panel B), the estimated coefficient indicates that adult illiteracy was 3.8 percentage

17:407:33107:24:24:90:525:442:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:schooling before the Civil War did not vary systematically across the discontinuity threshold, 
17:408:33202:24:24:90:525:418:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:adults  were  more  literate  in  counties  that  had  been  affected by  the  initial  Trustee  ban  on 
17:409:33306:24:24:90:257:394:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:slavery than in unaffected counties. 
17:410:33342:24:24:108:525:370:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:In the Engerman and Sokoloff hypothesis, slavery was causally related to long-run economic 
17:411:33433:24:24:90:526:346:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:development through its strong, positive effect on initial economic inequality, specifically land 
17:412:33530:24:24:90:525:322:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:inequality.  However, results presented in Table 5 suggest that Trusteeship was not negatively 
17:413:33625:24:24:90:525:298:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:correlated with land inequality.  Estimated coefficients reported in column 1, panel A reveal 
17:414:33717:24:24:90:526:274:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:that by 1784, the first year for which landholding data is available, the average Gini coefficient 
17:415:33816:24:24:90:525:250:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:was in fact 0.057 points higher in Trustee versus non-Trustee counties.  By 1860, the average 
17:416:33910:24:24:90:525:226:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Gini coefficient was still higher by 0.032 points in Trustee versus non-Trustee counties, in the 
17:417:34007:24:24:90:522:202:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:main  sample,  and  by  a  non-statistically  significant  0.025  points  in  the  border  county  sub-
17:418:34110:24:24:90:525:178:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:sample (panel B).  Results therefore suggest that the distribution of land pre Civil War was 
17:419:34203:24:24:90:525:154:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:more unequal in counties in which slavery was initially banned, versus in counties where it was

18:421:34305:0:24:108:526:682:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:However, estimated coefficients reported in column 2 of Table 5 suggest that while overall 
18:422:34396:24:24:90:525:658:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:inequality in landholding was greater in former Trustee counties than in non-Trustee counties, 
18:423:34491:24:24:90:525:634:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:the  frequency  of  very  large  landholdings  was  initially  lower.   By  1784,  the  fraction  of  all

18:425:34698:24:24:90:525:586:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:counties, though by 1860 the estimated difference had declined to a non-statistically significant 
18:426:34796:24:24:90:456:562:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:1.7 percentage points (2.3 percentage points in the border county sub-sample). 
18:427:34874:24:24:108:525:538:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Estimated  coefficients reported in  column 3 of  Table 5 indicate that Trusteeship had  a 
18:428:34965:24:24:90:525:514:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:significant long-term effect on patterns of land tenure.  By 1900, the fraction of farmholdings 
18:429:35060:24:24:90:522:490:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:operated  by  sharecropping  tenants  was  9.8  percentage  points  lower  in  Trustee  versus  non-
18:430:35160:24:24:90:525:466:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Trustee counties, in the main sample of all counties, and 7.8 percentage points lower in the 
18:431:35253:24:24:90:525:442:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:border  county  sub-sample.    As  late  as  1940,  the  fraction  of  farmholdings  operated  by 
18:432:35351:24:24:90:526:418:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:sharecropping  tenants  was  still  4.1  percentage  points  lower  in  Trustee  versus  non-Trustee 
18:433:35452:24:24:90:423:394:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:counties (6.6 percentage points lower in the border county sub-sample).

18:435:35624:24:24:90:525:346:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:economic output.  Estimated coefficients reported in column 4 indicate that Trusteeship was 
18:436:35716:24:24:90:525:322:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:persistently negatively correlated with Herfindahl index scores of economic output, implying 
18:437:35809:24:24:90:525:298:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:that economic output was less concentrated in a few product categories in Trustee counties 
18:438:35900:24:24:90:524:274:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:versus  in  non-Trustee  counties.    By  1860,  the  average  Herfindahl  index  score  in  Trustee 
18:439:36001:24:24:90:525:250:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:counties was 0.019 points lower than in non-Trustee counties (0.021 points lower in the border 
18:440:36096:24:24:90:525:226:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:county  sub-sample), and  by  1940  was  0.073  points  lower  (0.136  points  lower  in  the  border 
18:441:36198:24:24:90:525:202:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:county  sub-sample).4  Reliance  on  the  principal  cash  crops of  cotton,  tobacco,  indigo,  cane 
18:442:36299:24:24:90:526:178:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:sugar, and rice was also lower before the Civil War in Trustee versus non-Trustee counties.  In 
18:443:36393:24:37:90:525:154:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:1860, the cash  crop share of  total crop  output by value was 8.5 percentage points lower in

18:445:36545:10:15:108:524:107:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:4 Unfortunately since the 1900 census reports production in incommensurable physical units, it is 
18:446:36642:15:0:90:378:92:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:not possible to construct Herfindahl index scores of output by value.

19:448:36815:24:24:90:525:658:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:county sub-sample).  In the very long run, however, cash crop dependence does not appear to 
19:449:36906:24:24:90:525:634:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:have varied systematically between Trustee and non-Trustee counties; by 1940, the cash crop 
19:450:36998:24:24:90:525:610:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:share of  total crop output by value was a non-statistically significant 3.3 percentage points 
19:451:37093:24:24:90:525:586:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:lower in Trustee counties versus in non-Trustee counties (2.2 percentage points in the border 
19:452:37187:24:24:90:525:562:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:county sub-sample).  Contrary to less reliance on cash crops, on the eve of the Civil War, per 
19:453:37282:24:24:90:525:538:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:capita output of orchard, market garden, homemade manufactures, and slaughtered livestock 
19:454:37372:24:24:90:525:514:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:was significantly higher in Trustee versus non-Trustee counties.  By 1860, per capita output 
19:455:37465:24:24:90:529:490:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:of  these  products  was  $86.13 higher  in  Trustee  counties  than  in  non-Trustee  counties.  
19:456:37562:24:24:90:525:466:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Restricting the analysis to the border county sub-sample, per capita output of these products 
19:457:37656:24:24:90:315:442:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:in 1860 was $135.14 higher in Trustee counties.5

19:471:38643:10:15:108:512:107:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:5 Unfortunately, subsequent censuses to not provide commensurate statistics on orchard, market 
19:472:38737:15:0:90:321:92:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:garden, home manufactures, and slaughtered livestock. 
20:473:38792:0:24:90:525:682:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Trusteeship declines from a statistically significant 0.141 to a non-statistically significant 0.013, 
20:474:38894:24:24:90:525:658:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:while  the  estimated  coefficient  on  cash  crop  share is  a  statistically  significant -0.317.    This 
20:475:39002:24:24:90:525:634:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:suggests that greater reliance on the production of cash crops was one channel through which 
20:476:39095:24:24:90:525:610:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:the Trustee ban on slavery affected long-run development. Similarly, results reported in column 
20:477:39190:24:24:90:525:586:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:2 of Table 6 indicate that when we include Herfindahl index score in 1860 as an explanatory 
20:478:39282:24:24:90:525:562:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:variable,  the  estimated  coefficient  on  Trusteeship  again  declines,  to  a  non-statistically 
20:479:39382:24:24:90:526:538:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:significant 0.031, while the estimated coefficient on Herfindahl score is a statistically significant 
20:480:39484:24:24:90:525:514:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:-1.890, meaning a 1-point increase in a county’s Herfindahl index score was associated with 
20:481:39575:24:24:90:315:490:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:1.890% lower median household income in 2010. 
20:482:39619:24:24:108:525:466:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:However, results reported in column 3 of Table 6 reveal that when both Herfindahl index 
20:483:39707:24:24:90:525:442:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:score  and  cash  crop  share  of  total  crop  output are  included  as  explanatory  variables,  the 
20:484:39809:24:24:90:525:418:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:estimated coefficient for cash crop share of crop output drops by almost half, and is no longer 
20:485:39904:24:24:90:525:394:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:statistically  significant,  while  the  estimated  coefficient  for  Herfindahl  score remains  a

20:487:40107:24:24:90:525:346:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:significant 0.023.  This suggests that greater reliance upon cash crops did not independently 
20:488:40201:24:24:90:525:322:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:affect long-run development, but rather was negatively correlated with greater overall economic 
20:489:40297:24:24:90:441:298:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:diversification, which was positively correlated with long-run development.

20:493:40384:24:24:108:525:202:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:In  this  paper,  I  exploit  a historic  institutional  discontinuity—namely,  the  exogenously 
20:494:40481:24:24:90:525:178:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:imposed  prohibition  of  slavery  in  88  of  159  Georgian  counties  from  1735  to  1751—as  an 
20:495:40581:24:24:90:525:154:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f6:B:“intention-to-treat” with subsequently lower slave intensity, in order to analyze the effects of 
20:496:40676:24:24:90:525:130:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:slavery  on  long-run  economic  development.  By  comparing  average  outcomes  in  counties 
20:497:40770:24:0:90:525:106:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:affected by the initial ban to average outcomes in contiguous border counties not affected by 
21:498:40866:0:24:90:525:682:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:the ban, and including a rich set of geographic covariates, I am furthermore able to control for 
21:499:40962:24:24:90:525:658:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:unobservable county characteristics that may have been correlated both with treatment and 
21:500:41052:24:24:90:300:634:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:subsequent differences in observed outcomes. 
21:501:41096:24:24:108:525:610:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:I find that belonging to Trustee Georgia during the period of the ban had a significant, 
21:502:41185:24:24:90:525:586:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:positive effect on income and negative effect on poverty rates over the very long run, and that 
21:503:41281:24:24:90:525:562:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:these relationships are largely accounted for by the effect of Trusteeship on subsequent slave 
21:504:41376:24:24:90:526:538:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:density.  Results further suggest that significant divergence in development between Trustee 
21:505:41469:24:24:90:376:514:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:and non-Trustee counties did not occur before the Civil War. 
21:506:41529:24:24:108:525:490:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:Exploring possible channels of persistence, I find that by 1860, average cash crop share of 
21:507:41620:24:24:90:525:466:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:total crop output and Herfindahl index score of output by category were significantly lower in 
21:508:41713:24:24:90:525:442:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Trustee counties than in contiguous non-Trustee counties unaffected by the initial slave ban, 
21:509:41804:24:24:90:525:418:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:indicating that Trustee county economies were significantly more diversified by the eve of the 
21:510:41899:24:24:90:525:394:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Civil War than non-Trustee counties. In particular, per capita production of orchard, market 
21:511:41992:24:24:90:522:370:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:garden,  homemade  manufactures,  and  livestock was  $105.14  higher  in  Trustee  versus  non-
21:512:42087:24:24:90:525:346:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:Trustee counties. Moreover, including Herfindahl score and cash crop share of total crop output 
21:513:42183:24:24:90:525:322:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:in  1860  as explanatory  variables  attenuates  the estimated  relationship  between Trusteeship

21:515:42384:24:24:90:525:274:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:suggests  that  less  economic  diversification  was  a  significant  channel  through  which  slavery 
21:516:42487:24:24:90:525:250:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:impacted long-run development.  In contrast, I also find that counties affected by the initial 
21:517:42580:24:24:90:525:226:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:slave ban  did  not  have  significant  differences  in  pre-Civil  War levels  of land  inequality, 
21:518:42680:24:24:90:525:202:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:educational investment, or rail and water transport links, suggesting economic inequality and 
21:519:42774:24:24:90:525:178:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:differential  provision  of  public  goods  were  not  significant  channels  through  which  slavery

21:521:42915:24:24:108:525:130:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:A:The results of this paper therefore lend additional support to the hypothesis that slavery 
21:522:43006:24:0:90:525:106:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:had a persistent, negative effect on long-run economic development, and furthermore provide 
22:523:43100:0:24:90:525:682:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:new  evidence  that  greater  dependence  on  cash  crops  and  lower  diversification  of  economic 
22:524:43201:24:24:90:526:658:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:output were important channels through which slavery affected long-run outcomes, particularly 
22:525:43295:24:24:90:525:634:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:after 1860.  Further research is needed, however, to clarify the mechanisms by which greater

22:528:43581:24:24:90:525:562:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:B:economic outcomes, and why this divergence did not occur until the latter half of the nineteenth
