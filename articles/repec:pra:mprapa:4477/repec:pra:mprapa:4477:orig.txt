3:45:1782:0:21:275:323:768:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:Abstract 
3:46:1791:21:20:297:300:747:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8: 
3:47:1791:20:28:62:536:727:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:In soccer penalty kicks, goalkeepers choose their action before they can clearly observe the kick 
3:48:1889:28:27:62:537:699:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:direction.  An  analysis  of  286  penalty  kicks  in  top  leagues  and  championships  worldwide  shows  
3:49:1996:27:28:62:536:672:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:that given the probability distribution of kick direction, the optimal strategy for goalkeepers is to 
3:50:2098:28:28:62:535:644:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:stay in the goal's center. Goalkeepers, however, almost always jump right or left. We propose the 
3:51:2196:28:27:62:536:616:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:following  explanation  for  this  behavior:  because  the  norm  is  to  jump,  norm  theory  (Kahneman  
3:52:2302:27:28:62:536:589:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:and  Miller,  1986)  implies  that  a  goal  scored  yields  worse  feelings  for  the  goalkeeper  following  
3:53:2413:28:27:62:536:561:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:inaction (staying in the center) than following action (jumping), leading to a bias for action. The 
3:54:2513:27:28:62:536:534:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:omission bias, a bias in favor of inaction, is reversed here because the norm here is reversed - to 
3:55:2613:28:28:62:536:506:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:act rather than to choose inaction. The claim that jumping is the norm is supported by a second 
3:56:2709:28:27:62:536:478:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:study,  a  survey  conducted  with  32  top  professional  goalkeepers.  The  seemingly  biased  decision  
3:57:2816:27:28:62:538:451:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:making  is  particularly  striking  since  the  goalkeepers  have  huge  incentives  to  make  correct  
3:58:2920:28:27:62:536:423:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:decisions, and it is a decision they encounter frequently. Finally, we discuss several implications 
3:59:3020:27:0:62:356:396:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:of the action/omission bias for economics and management.  
4:60:3080:0:27:62:142:768:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:1. Introduction 
4:61:3096:27:28:80:537:741:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:According  to  the  classical  assumptions  in  economics,  when  people  face  decision  problems  
4:62:3196:28:28:62:537:713:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:involving uncertainty, they should choose what to do according to their utility from the possible 
4:63:3294:28:27:62:536:685:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:outcomes and the probability distribution of outcomes that follows each possible action. How an 
4:64:3390:27:28:62:537:658:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:outcome  comes  about  should  not  matter.  For  example,  suppose  that  the  decision  maker  has  two  
4:65:3497:28:27:62:536:630:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:possible actions, A and B, and he prefers the probability distribution of outcomes that follows A 
4:66:3595:27:28:62:537:603:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:over the one that follows B. If in a different problem the decision maker has possible actions X 
4:67:3692:28:28:62:535:575:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:and Y that lead to the same distributions of outcomes as A and  B, respectively, then the decision 
4:68:3791:28:27:62:184:547:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:maker should choose X.  
4:69:3815:27:28:80:537:520:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Many  studies  involving  subjective  judgment  of  decision  outcomes,  however,  found  that  the  
4:70:3916:28:27:62:536:492:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:evaluation  of  an  outcome  depends  not  only  on  the  outcome  itself,  but  also  on  the  way  in  which  
4:71:4028:27:28:62:536:465:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:this outcome came about. Kahneman and Tversky (1982), in a seminal article, found that people 
4:72:4122:28:28:62:538:437:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:feel  a  more  poignant  emotional  reaction  to  bad  outcomes  that  result  from  action  relative  to  
4:73:4229:28:27:62:539:409:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:otherwise  identical  outcomes  that  result  from  inaction.1  The  different  emotional  reaction  to  
4:74:4334:27:28:62:536:382:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:outcomes depending on whether they come from action or inaction was later replicated in many 
4:75:4427:28:27:62:537:354:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:other  studies  (see  for  example  Landman,  1987;  Ritov  and  Baron,  1990,  1992,  1995;  Kordes-de  
4:76:4532:27:28:62:536:327:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Vaal, 1996; Patt and Zeckhauser, 2000; Kruger, Wirtz and Miller, 2005), and was referred to in 
4:77:4627:28:50:62:538:299:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f9:the  literature  in  several  terms,  including  emotional  amplification,  the  action  bias,  the  action  
4:78:4736:50:8:62:209:249:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:                                                 
4:79:4784:8:27:62:537:241:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:1  It  is  helpful  to  illustrate  Kahneman  and  Tversky's  findings  by  citing  their  experiment.  Subjects  were  asked  the  
4:80:4916:27:23:62:537:214:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:following  question:  "Paul  owns  shares  in  company  A.  During  the  past  year  he  considered  switching  to  stock  in  
4:81:5043:23:23:62:537:191:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:company  B,  but  he  decided  against  it.  He  now  finds  out  that  he  would  have  been  better  off  by  $1,200  if  he  had  
4:82:5176:23:23:62:536:168:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:switched to the stock of company B. George owned shares in company B. During the past year he switched to stock 
4:83:5288:23:23:62:536:145:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:in company A. He now finds out that he would have been better off by $1,200 if he had kept his stock in Company 
4:84:5400:23:23:62:536:122:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:B.  Who  feels  more  regret?"  (p.  173).  A  large  majority  of  the  subjects  thought  that  George,  who  acted,  felt  more  
4:85:5532:23:23:62:200:99:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:regret than Paul, who did not act.  
4:86:5568:23:0:62:65:76:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6: 
5:87:5569:0:27:62:537:768:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f6:effect, the  inaction  effect,  the  actor  effect,  and  the omission  bias  (for  a  detailed  review  of  this  
5:88:5683:27:28:62:219:741:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:literature, see Anderson, 2003).  
5:89:5717:28:28:80:537:713:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Kahneman  and  Miller  (1986)  proposed  the  norm  theory  to  explain  the  above  phenomenon.  
5:90:5815:28:27:62:538:685:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:According  to  this  theory,  negative  outcomes  are  perceived  as  worse  when  people  can  easily  
5:91:5919:27:28:62:538:658:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:imagine  that  a  better  outcome  could  have  occurred.  They  further  assume  that  in  general  it  is  
5:92:6028:28:27:62:538:630:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:easier  to  mentally  “undo”  an  action  that  had  occurred  than  to  imagine  having  taken  an  action  
5:93:6137:27:28:62:536:603:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:when  none  had  occurred.  Consequently,  the  reaction  to  outcomes  of  action  is  stronger  than  the  
5:94:6246:28:28:62:536:575:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:reaction to outcomes of inaction (also referred to in the literature as "omissions"). Consistent with 
5:95:6348:28:27:62:536:547:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:this proposal, Ritov and Baron showed, in a series of investigations, that people tend to judge acts 
5:96:6449:27:28:62:538:520:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:that  are  harmful  (relative  to  the  alternative  option)  as  worse  than  omissions  that  are  equally  
5:97:6559:28:27:62:369:492:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:harmful or even more harmful (for a review, see Baron, 1994).  
5:98:6622:27:28:80:538:465:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Almost  all  the  literature  so  far  has  studied  cases  in  which  people  are  biased  in  favor  of  
5:99:6729:28:28:62:537:437:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:inaction. The explanation of Kahneman and Miller (1986) for this bias is based on the idea that 
5:100:6825:28:27:62:536:409:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:people can more easily imagine the alternative to action than to inaction, because inaction is often 
5:101:6926:27:28:62:536:382:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the norm. In cases in which action becomes more normal, however, we might expect, according 
5:102:7018:28:27:62:538:354:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:to  the  rationale  behind  the  norm  theory,  that  the  opposite  bias  would  occur:  people  would  be  
5:103:7127:27:28:62:535:327:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:biased in favor of action when both action and inaction might lead to the same negative outcome. 
5:104:7224:28:28:62:537:299:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Confirming  this  prediction  –  and  in  line  with  some  previous  research  (Ritov  and  Baron,  1990;  
5:105:7332:28:27:62:536:271:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Spranca, Minsk and Baron, 1991) – Ritov and Baron (1994) demonstrated that when action was 
5:106:7423:27:28:62:539:244:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:more  expected  than  inaction,  adverse  outcomes  of  failure  to  act  were  judged  worse  than  
5:107:7524:28:27:62:537:216:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:(identical)  outcomes  of  action  (see  also  Miller  and  Taylor,  1995).  Similarly,  Zeelenberg  et  al  
5:108:7633:27:28:62:539:189:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:(2002)  argue  that  action  might  be  more  normal  than  inaction  when  we  consider  previous  
5:109:7733:28:28:62:537:161:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:outcomes; in particular, they claim that when a soccer team loses by a large margin, it becomes 
5:110:7829:28:27:62:536:133:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:more normal for the coach to act in the next game (replace players in the opening team) than not 
5:111:7926:27:0:62:482:106:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:to act (keep the same players), a claim that is supported by their experimental findings. 
6:112:8017:0:27:80:536:768:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Most studies on the action/omission bias2 used hypothetical questions, where decisions do not 
6:113:8111:27:28:62:538:741:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:bear  real  consequences  for  the  subjects.  A  few  exceptions  are  worth  mentioning.  Davis  et  al  
6:114:8218:28:28:62:535:713:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:(1995) examine perceptions after loss of a child or a spouse. Zeelenberg and Pieters (2004) study 
6:115:8316:28:27:62:538:685:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the  participation  in  lotteries  in  The  Netherlands.  Kruger,  Wirtz  and  Miller  (2005)  look  at  the  
6:116:8426:27:28:62:539:658:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:decision  whether  to  change  a  previous  answer  on  a  multiple-choice  test,  and  Pieters  and  
6:117:8528:28:27:62:449:630:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Zeelenberg (2005) examine voting in the national elections in The Netherlands.  
6:118:8608:27:28:80:537:603:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Because  we  believe  that  the  action/omission  bias  has  important  implications  for  economics,  
6:119:8711:28:28:62:539:575:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:and  because  many  economists  are  skeptic  regarding  experiments  that  lack  salient  financial  
6:120:8813:28:27:62:536:547:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:incentives (even though in psychology it is a common practice to conduct such experiments), we 
6:121:8908:27:28:62:537:520:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:attempt  to  observe  whether  an  action  bias  exists  in  a  real-world  situation,  where  incentives  are  
6:122:9020:28:27:62:536:492:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:huge: the behavior of elite goalkeepers during penalty kicks.3 Moreover, goalkeepers face penalty 
6:123:9118:27:28:62:536:465:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:kicks regularly, so they are not only highly-motivated decision-makers, but also very experienced 
6:124:9216:28:28:62:535:437:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:ones in the domain of the decision they have to make. The norm for goalkeepers in penalty kicks 
6:125:9312:28:27:62:536:409:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:is to act (jump to the right or to the left), leading us to predict, based on the norm theory, a bias 
6:126:9414:27:64:62:535:382:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:towards action. Indeed, we find that while on average, given the behavior of kickers, it is optimal 
6:127:9514:64:8:62:209:318:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:                                                 
6:128:9562:8:27:62:536:310:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:2  In  what  follows,  we  use  the  term  "action/omission  bias"  to  refer  generally  to  the  phenomenon  that  outcomes  are  
6:129:9694:27:23:62:536:283:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:evaluated differently depending on whether they were preceded by action or inaction. We use "action bias" to refer 
6:130:9809:23:23:62:535:260:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:specifically to cases in which people are biased in favor of acting, and use "omission bias" for cases where people are 
6:131:9929:23:19:62:172:237:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:biased in favor of inaction. 
6:132:9958:19:27:62:536:218:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:3  Despite  the  fact  that  goalkeeping  involves  decision  making  (see  for  example  the  soccer  goalkeeping  coaching  
6:133:10084:27:23:62:537:191:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:guidelines  in  Welsh,  1990),  the  area  of  goalkeepers’  decision  making  is  still  under-researched.  One  aspect  of  
6:134:10210:23:23:62:535:168:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:goalkeepers’ behavior that did receive some attention is their behavior during penalty kicks. For example, cognitive 
6:135:10327:23:23:62:537:145:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:processes  such  as  anticipation,  cue  utilization  and  response  time  have  been  studied  (see  for  example  Morris  and  
6:136:10456:23:23:62:537:122:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:Burwitz,  1989;  Williams  and  Burwitz,  1993;  McMorris  and  Colonso,  1996;  Savelsbergh,  Williams,  Kamp,  and  
6:137:10574:23:23:62:535:99:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:Ward, 2002). However, to our knowledge, no study systematically investigated fallible judgments (i.e., heuristics and 
6:138:10692:23:0:62:471:76:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:biases) of goalkeepers in general and in particular when facing a penalty kick, as we do in this article. 
7:139:10799:0:27:62:536:768:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:for the goalkeeper to choose to stay in the center of the goal (which can be considered inaction), 
7:140:10898:27:28:62:526:741:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:goalkeepers almost always jump to the right or to the left, thus exhibiting a bias towards action.  
7:141:10998:28:28:80:537:713:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Recently,  two  other  papers  that  address  the  behavior  of  players  during  penalty  kicks  have  
7:142:11102:28:27:62:537:685:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:been  published.  Chiappori,  Levitt  and  Groseclose  (2002)  examine  the  question  whether  kickers  
7:143:11207:27:28:62:538:658:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:and  goalkeepers  play  the  mixed-strategy  Nash  equilibrium  (MSNE).  They  show  that  several  
7:144:11307:28:27:62:536:630:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:predictions that should hold if the MSNE is played are indeed supported by their data. It seems at 
7:145:11406:27:28:62:536:603:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:first that our result (using a different dataset) of a bias in goalkeepers’ behavior contradicts their 
7:146:11509:28:28:62:535:575:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:conclusion. In their data, however, only in about 2% of the penalty kicks the goalkeeper chose to 
7:147:11607:28:27:62:536:547:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:stay in the center, so their result, that play is consistent with the MSNE concept, is based almost 
7:148:11707:27:28:62:537:520:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:entirely  on  the  choice  between  right  and  left,  and  not  on  the  choice  between  the  center  and  the  
7:149:11821:28:27:62:536:492:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:sides. Consequently, our result is not a contradiction of theirs. Palacios-Huerta (2003) also studies 
7:150:11923:27:28:62:536:465:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:penalty kicks. In his empirical analysis, however, he analyzes a 2X2 game, in which kickers and 
7:151:12019:28:28:62:537:437:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:goalkeepers  can  choose  either  right  or  left.  His  results  suggest  that  in  the  choice  between  right  
7:152:12133:28:27:62:537:409:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:and  left,  goalkeepers  and  kickers  play  in  accordance  with  the  MSNE  predictions.  Because  he  
7:153:12238:27:28:62:536:382:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:analyzes  a  2X2  game,  however,  he  cannot  detect  whether  there  is  a  bias  in  the  choice  of  center  
7:154:12351:28:27:62:314:354:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:versus the sides, which is the focus of our research.  
7:155:12406:27:28:80:537:327:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:The  rest  of  the  article  is  organized  as  follows.  The  next  section  gives  some  background  on  
7:156:12513:28:28:62:538:299:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:penalty  kicks  and  describes  our  predictions.  Section  3  presents  the  first  study,  in  which  we  
7:157:12621:28:27:62:538:271:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:examine  the  behavior  of  kickers  and  goalkeepers  during  penalty  kicks.  Section  4  presents  the  
7:158:12728:27:28:62:537:244:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:second  study,  a  survey  conducted  with  elite  professional  goalkeepers  about  their  attitudes  and  
7:159:12836:28:27:62:536:216:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:perceptions  regarding  penalty  kicks.  Section  5  concludes  and  offers  a  few  possible  implications  
7:160:12945:27:28:62:356:189:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:of the action/omission bias for economics and management.

7:162:13004:28:27:62:297:133:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:2. Soccer, Penalty Kicks, and Potential Biases 
7:163:13051:27:28:80:536:106:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:In a penalty kick, the kicker shoots a stationary ball located 11 meters from the goal, against 
7:164:13147:28:0:62:537:78:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:only  a  goalkeeper  (no  other  players  are  allowed  to  stand  in  the  way),  who  must  remain  on  the  
8:165:13259:0:27:62:536:768:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:goal-line until the kick is taken. This suggests that it is hard to stop a penalty kick, and indeed in 
8:166:13362:27:28:62:536:741:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:our data about 80% of the penalty kicks resulted in a goal being scored. Penalty kicks in soccer 
8:167:13459:28:28:62:539:713:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:are  used  in  two  cases.  First,  they  are  used  as  a  means  to  determine  the  winner  in  certain  
8:168:13567:28:27:62:536:685:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:championships, when the regular game ends with a tie. In this case their  importance  is  obvious,  
8:169:13667:27:28:62:536:658:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:since the penalty kicks determine the winner. Second, penalty kicks are awarded against a team 
8:170:13762:28:27:62:536:630:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:that  conducts  certain  severe  offenses  during  the  game.  The  great  importance  of  penalty  kicks  in  
8:171:13873:27:28:62:536:603:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:this case comes from the fact that the number of goals in an average game is only about 2.5 (by 
8:172:13969:28:28:62:536:575:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:both teams together), so a goal scored in a penalty kick has high chances of changing the outcome 
8:173:14067:28:27:62:536:547:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:of the game. This suggests the extreme importance of optimal performance during penalty kicks, 
8:174:14162:27:28:62:537:520:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:for  both  kickers  and  goalkeepers.  Since  salaries  and  bonuses  in  professional  soccer  can  reach  
8:175:14270:28:27:62:536:492:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:hundreds of thousands and even millions of dollars and are affected by the player's performance 
8:176:14366:27:28:62:538:465:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:and  reputation,  it  is  clear  that  players  have  huge  economic  incentives  to  do  their  best  during  
8:177:14477:28:28:62:132:437:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:penalty kicks. 
8:178:14492:28:27:80:536:409:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Because the time it takes the ball to reach the goal from the penalty mark is only about 0.2-0.3 
8:179:14589:27:28:62:538:382:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:seconds  (see  Chiappori,  Levitt  and  Groseclose,  2002;  Palacios-Huerta,  2003),  the  goalkeeper  
8:180:14692:28:27:62:537:354:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:generally  cannot  afford  to  wait  until  he  sees  clearly  to  which  direction  the  ball  is  kicked  before  
8:181:14808:27:28:62:535:327:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:choosing his action; rather, he has to decide whether to jump to one of the sides or to stay in the 
8:182:14908:28:28:62:536:299:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:center at about the same time that the kicker chooses where to direct the kick. This is the reason 
8:183:15007:28:27:62:540:271:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:that   both   Chiappori   et   al   (2002)   and   Palacios-Huerta   (2003)   model   penalty   kicks   as   a   
8:184:15120:27:28:62:538:244:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:simultaneous-move  game.  Of  course,  in  practice  the  situation  is  more  complex:  goalkeepers  
8:185:15222:28:27:62:537:216:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:might  get  cues  about  the  intended  direction  of  the  kick  by  observing  the  behavior  of  the  kicker  
8:186:15335:27:28:62:536:189:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:when  he  approaches  the  ball,  or  by  knowing  the  history  of  his  previous  penalty  kicks  (although  
8:187:15446:28:28:62:537:161:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the  kicker,  in  turn,  has  an  incentive  to  surprise  the  goalkeeper).  The  evidence,  to  be  discusses  
8:188:15559:28:27:62:533:133:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:later,  suggests  that  as  implied  by  the  assumption  made  by  Chiappori  et  al  (2002)  and  Palacios-
8:189:15668:27:0:62:541:106:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Huerta   (2003),   the   assumption   that   the   kicker   and   the   goalkeeper   choose   their   actions   
9:190:15781:0:27:62:536:768:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:simultaneously is a good approximation, certainly much better than assuming that either of them 
9:191:15877:27:28:62:336:741:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:chooses only after observing what the other has chosen.  
9:192:15934:28:28:80:535:713:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:This creates a simple and interesting real-life example (with huge financial incentives to make 
9:193:16030:28:27:62:536:685:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:good  decisions)  of  decision  making  under  uncertainty:  the  goalkeeper  has  to  choose  whether  to  
9:194:16138:27:28:62:536:658:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:jump  to  the  right,  the  left,  or  to  stay  in  the  center,  in  order  to  minimize  the  risk  of  a  goal  being  
9:195:16261:28:27:62:535:630:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:scored, under uncertainty regarding the direction of the ball. This makes it very intriguing to find 
9:196:16362:27:28:62:535:603:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:whether expert goalkeepers exhibit any deviation from rational decision making. To examine this, 
9:197:16459:28:28:62:535:575:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:we collected data from games in the top leagues and championships worldwide. Later, in order to 
9:198:16555:28:27:62:537:547:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:reinforce  our  conclusion  from  the  first  study,  we  also  conducted  a  second  study  in  which  top  
9:199:16664:27:28:62:539:520:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:professional  goalkeepers  were  asked  about  their  perceptions  and  attitudes  regarding  penalty  
9:200:16767:28:27:62:96:492:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:kicks.  
9:201:16775:27:28:80:535:465:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:We hypothesized that the goalkeeper’s behavior during penalty kicks may be affected, at least 
9:202:16869:28:28:62:537:437:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:partly,  by  preference  for  action  (the  "action  bias").  The  norm,  as  the  data  we  collected  in  both  
9:203:16983:28:27:62:536:409:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:studies reveal, is to jump to either side (rather than to stay in the center). Consequently, according 
9:204:17086:27:28:62:537:382:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:to  the  norm  theory,  goalkeepers  would  experience  a  bad  outcome  (not  stopping  a  penalty  kick)  
9:205:17194:28:27:62:536:354:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:more strongly when it results from not obeying the norm (staying in the center) rather than from 
9:206:17291:27:28:62:536:327:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:obeying the norm (jumping). Therefore, we hypothesized that goalkeepers would choose to jump 
9:207:17384:28:28:62:538:299:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:more  than  is  optimal.4  The  analysis  in  the  following  sections  shows  that  this  conjecture  was  
9:208:17492:28:27:62:536:271:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:supported by the data. Thus, our study corroborates the predictions of the norm theory where the 
9:209:17589:27:28:62:537:244:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:norm is to act rather than to choose inaction, a phenomenon  that  we  denote  as  "the  action  bias"  
9:210:17693:28:36:62:538:216:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:(following  some  of  the  previous  literature).  Moreover,  we  do  so  in  a  natural  setting  where  
9:211:17799:36:8:62:209:180:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:                                                 
9:212:17847:8:27:62:535:172:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:4 Notice that the norm theory (see Kahneman and Miller, 1986) in this context, as well as more generally, can create 
9:213:17964:27:23:62:536:145:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:an interesting mechanism that reinforces norms where risky action/inaction decisions have to be made. When action 
9:214:18078:23:23:62:536:122:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:is  the  norm,  negative  outcome  following  inaction  is  experienced  more  strongly  than  negative  outcome  following  
9:215:18203:23:23:62:535:99:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:action, leading decision makers to prefer action, thus reinforcing the norm. A similar argument shows that a norm to 
9:216:18320:23:0:62:436:76:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:choose inaction can also support itself through the mechanism proposed by the norm theory.  
10:217:18413:0:27:62:538:768:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:incentives  for  making  correct  decision  are  huge,  supporting  the  claim  that  biases  in  behavior  
10:218:18521:27:28:62:400:741:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:often persist even when incentives for optimal decision making exist.

10:221:18660:39:34:62:131:646:144:g_d0_f9:144:g_d0_f9:3.1. The Data 
10:222:18674:34:27:80:537:612:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:To  determine  whether  soccer  goalkeepers  exhibit  the  action  bias  and  jump  during  penalty  
10:223:18775:27:28:62:536:585:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:kicks more than is optimal, we needed data on actual behavior of kickers and goalkeepers during 
10:224:18871:28:28:62:537:557:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:penalty  kicks.  To  obtain  such  data,  we  searched  in  the  archives  of  various  television  channels,  
10:225:18982:28:27:62:536:529:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:found different soccer matches in the top leagues and championships worldwide, and watched the 
10:226:19077:27:28:62:537:502:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:games  to  see  whether  they  involved  penalty  kicks.  For  those  penalty  kicks  that  we  found,  we  
10:227:19185:28:27:62:537:474:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:asked  three  independent  judges  to  determine  to  which  part  of  the  goal  the  ball  was  kicked,  to  
10:228:19296:27:28:62:538:447:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:which  direction  the  goalkeeper  jumped  (if  at  all),  and  whether  he  stopped  the  ball,  using  a  
10:229:19404:28:28:62:456:419:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:diagram of the goal's area (see Appendix A). A total of 311 kicks were analyzed.  
10:230:19486:28:27:80:536:391:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:After the three judges evaluated the kicks, we excluded kicks that were missed because they 
10:231:19578:27:28:62:535:364:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:were shot to the goalposts and the crossbar or outside the goal (18 such kicks existed in the data). 
10:232:19679:28:27:62:537:336:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:The reason is that we later use the sample to estimate the probability of stopping a penalty kick 
10:233:19777:27:28:62:536:309:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:by jumping to the side or by staying in the center. Balls that did not reach the goal itself (i.e. did 
10:234:19880:28:28:62:536:281:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:not reach cells 1-9 in the diagram in Appendix A) are not scored goals, on one hand, but are not 
10:235:19977:28:27:62:536:253:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:successes of the goalkeepers in stopping the ball, on the other hand. Therefore it seemed best to 
10:236:20075:27:28:62:202:226:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:exclude them from the data.  
10:237:20104:28:27:80:536:198:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Because balls sometimes get to the boundary area between two cells (e.g. between cells 3 and 
10:238:20197:27:28:62:536:171:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:6), it is not surprising that in these cases different judges could mark a different cell. It would be a 
10:239:20302:28:28:62:536:143:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:mistake to eliminate such observations because of the disagreement between the judges, because 
10:240:20397:28:27:62:536:115:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:this means that we systematically eliminate many balls that are kicked to any boundary between 
10:241:20492:27:0:62:537:88:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:two  cells,  leaving  a  biased  sample.  Therefore,  in  those  cases  where  two  judges  chose  the  same  
11:242:20603:0:27:62:537:768:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:cell  and  one  judge  chose  an  adjacent  cell,  we  recorded  the  ball  as  being  where  the  two  judges  
11:243:20715:27:28:62:538:741:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:agreed.  In  rare  cases  (7  out  of  311  kicks)  where  one  of  the  judges  chose  a  cell  that  was  not  
11:244:20828:28:28:62:536:713:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:adjacent to one chosen by the other two, or where the three judges chose three different cells, we 
11:245:20927:28:27:62:537:685:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:excluded  this  observation  from  the  data.  The  elimination  of  these  observations  and  of  the  balls  
11:246:21038:27:28:62:457:658:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:kicked outside the goal resulted in the sample size shrinking to 286 observations.  
11:247:21122:28:27:80:536:630:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:There is a potential confusion about directions in this context. If the goalkeeper jumps to his 
11:248:21218:27:28:62:535:603:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:left, and the kicker kicks towards his left, these are two opposite directions even though both are 
11:249:21318:28:28:62:536:575:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:"left." To avoid this confusion, in what follows, every time we mention right or left, it is from the 
11:250:21420:28:27:62:537:547:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:goalkeeper's  perspective.  Thus,  cells  1,  2  and  3  in  Appendix  A  are  kicks  to  the  right.  Table  1  
11:251:21533:27:28:62:536:520:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:presents  the  data,  divided  according  to  the  direction  of  jumps  and  kicks.  The  top  panel  presents  
11:252:21646:28:28:62:466:492:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the raw frequencies, and the bottom panel presents the distribution in percentages.5

11:256:21914:27:23:62:536:145:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:explained  before)  reveals  that  goalkeepers  stayed  in  the  center,  jumped  right,  and  jumped  left  in  7.1%,  44%,  and  
11:257:22045:23:23:62:535:122:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:48.9% of the kicks, respectively. Since these percentages are very close to the ones in the sub-sample of 286 kicks, 
11:258:22162:23:23:62:536:99:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:we prefer to focus our discussion on these 286 kicks rather than to discuss goalkeeper behavior on the entire sample

12:275:23769:28:27:80:536:350:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Table 1 suggests that the decisions taken by the kicker and the goalkeeper are made roughly 
12:276:23861:27:28:62:536:323:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:simultaneously. If goalkeepers had observed to which direction the ball was headed and only then 
12:277:23958:28:28:62:536:295:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:chose to which direction to jump, they would have always jumped to the direction of the kick. If, 
12:278:24056:28:27:62:536:267:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:on the other hand, the kickers had observed to which direction the goalkeepers jumped and only 
12:279:24151:27:28:62:536:240:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:then kicked the ball, they would have always kicked to a different direction from the goalkeeper's 
12:280:24250:28:27:62:537:212:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:jump. The fact that the directions of the kick and the jump match in 43% of kicks rather than in 
12:281:24347:27:28:62:536:185:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:0% or 100% of the kicks suggests that neither the kicker nor the goalkeeper can clearly observe 
12:282:24443:28:28:62:536:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:what the other chose when choosing their action. While the data do not suggest that goalkeepers' 
12:283:24540:28:27:62:536:129:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:and kickers' decisions are completely independent, the interaction between the goalkeeper and the 
12:284:24638:27:0:62:536:102:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:kicker is closer to being a simultaneous interaction than to the other two simple alternatives (the 
13:285:24740:0:27:62:537:768:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:goalkeeper  observing  the  kick  direction  and  only  then  choosing  his  action,  or  vice  versa).6  The  
13:286:24851:27:28:62:536:741:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:data  could  result,  for  example,  from  an  aggregation  of  a  small  percentage  of  kicks  in  which  the  
13:287:24964:28:28:62:536:713:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:goalkeeper realized where the kick goes, and a large percentage of kicks where the kick and jump 
13:288:25061:28:27:62:334:685:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:direction are completely independent (see Appendix B).

13:302:26511:27:28:80:538:297:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Not  surprisingly,  most  of  the  kicks  stopped  occur  when  the  goalkeeper  chooses  the  same  
13:303:26612:28:27:62:536:269:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:direction  to  which  the  ball  was  kicked.  We  can  see,  however,  that  in  a  few  cases  a  goalkeeper  
13:304:26724:27:28:62:535:242:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:who jumped to one of the sides was still able to stop a ball directed towards the center. It is clear 
13:305:26826:28:27:62:536:214:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:why  this  is  possible  if  we  remember  that  a  kick  that  is  classified  as  "Center"  need  not  be  at  the  
13:306:26944:27:30:62:536:187:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:exact center, but rather at any point in cells 4, 5, or 6, so jumping to the left allows the goalkeeper 
13:307:27048:30:8:62:209:157:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:                                                 
13:308:27096:8:27:62:535:149:42:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:6 The data provide evidence that goalkeepers might have some noisy signals, or cues, about the direction of the kick, 
13:309:27214:27:23:62:535:122:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:since they do better (43% match between their jumps and the ball's direction) than the 33.3% rate they could achieve 
13:310:27331:23:23:62:537:99:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:by  choosing  randomly,  or  the  39.2%  they  could  achieve  by  always  jumping  to  the  right  (the  most  common  kick  
13:311:27457:23:0:62:106:76:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f6:direction). 
14:312:27471:0:27:62:536:768:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:to potentially stop a ball directed a bit to the left of the center. It is also possible to stop a ball to 
14:313:27578:27:28:62:403:741:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f8:the center when jumping if the goalkeeper stops the ball with his legs.  
14:314:27650:28:28:80:537:713:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:In  order  to  estimate  the  probability  that  a  goalkeeper  has  to  stop  a  kick,  we  take  the  total  
14:315:27761:28:27:62:536:685:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:number  of  balls  stopped  when  choosing  a  certain  direction, and divide it by the total number of 
14:316:27865:27:28:62:538:658:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:jumps  to  that  direction.  Goalkeepers  in  the  sample,  for  example,  jumped  left  141  times  and  
14:317:27971:28:27:62:537:630:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:stopped  20  balls  when  jumping  left,  yielding  a  14.2%  stopping  rate.  Combining  the  choices  of  
14:318:28079:27:28:62:536:603:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:right and left to an action that we can denote “jump” and comparing the payoff from this action 
14:319:28175:28:28:62:536:575:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:(36 stopped kicks vs. 232 scored goals) to the payoff of “stay in the center” (6 stopped kicks vs. 
14:320:28274:28:27:62:535:547:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:12 scored goals) allows us to reject the null hypothesis that the two actions give the same payoff

14:324:28476:27:28:80:538:437:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Before  we  can  examine  whether  goalkeepers  deviate  from  utility-maximizing  behavior,  we  
14:325:28574:28:27:62:539:409:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:should  find  out  what  is  the  utility-maximizing  behavior  in  the  decision  problem  they  face.  
14:326:28679:27:28:62:538:382:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Assuming  that  the  goalkeeper  tries  to  maximize  the  chances  of  his  team  to  win,  his  optimal  
14:327:28786:28:27:62:536:354:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:decision rule is to choose the direction where his probability of stopping the ball is maximal. We 
14:328:28885:27:28:62:538:327:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:can  see  in  Table  2  that  the  optimal  direction  to  choose  is  center;  the  difference  between  the  
14:329:28996:28:28:62:536:299:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:stopping chances in the center and either left or right are large. While it is optimal for goalkeepers 
14:330:29099:28:27:62:536:271:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:to choose to stay in the center, however, they almost always choose to jump to one of the sides! 
14:331:29196:27:28:62:537:244:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Only  in  6.3%  of  the  cases  they  stay  in  the  center.  This  suggests  that  goalkeepers  might  exhibit  
14:332:29309:28:27:62:184:216:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:biased decision making.  
14:333:29334:27:28:80:537:189:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:A  first  conjecture  about  which  bias  goalkeepers  exhibit  might  be  the  probability  matching  
14:334:29437:28:28:62:537:161:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:bias.  To  give  a  brief  explanation  of  this  principle,  assume  that  subjects  have  option  A,  which  is  
14:335:29552:28:27:62:537:133:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:optimal  with  chances  of  p  >  0.5,  and  option  B,  which  is  optimal  with  chances  of  (1-p).  Also  
14:336:29662:27:28:62:535:106:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:assume that the difference in utility between the two options is constant; for example, one option 
14:337:29761:28:0:62:536:78:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:wins a dollar and another wins nothing, but the winning option can change in each round. When 
15:338:29857:0:27:62:538:768:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:people  learn  the  pattern  of  the  game  (i.e.,  the  value  of  p),  their  optimal  behavior  is  to  always  
15:339:29972:27:28:62:536:741:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:choose option A. In many experiments, however, it has been observed that people often choose A 
15:340:30067:28:28:62:539:713:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:with  probability  p  and  B  with  probability  (1-p),  a  behavior  that  was  coined  "probability  
15:341:30170:28:27:62:356:685:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:matching" (for a review of this literature, see Vulkan, 2000). 
15:342:30233:27:28:80:536:658:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:If goalkeepers behave according to the probability matching principle, they should choose to 
15:343:30326:28:27:62:536:630:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:stay  in  the  center  in  about  28.7%  of  the  kicks  (the  percentage  of  kicks  towards  the  center).  The  
15:344:30441:27:28:62:538:603:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:probability  with  which  they  choose  to  stay  in  the  center,  however  (6.3%),  is  much  lower,  
15:345:30545:28:28:62:535:575:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:suggesting that probability matching is not the bias we see here. Indeed, it has been shown in the 
15:346:30644:28:27:62:532:547:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:past  that  with  experience,  probability  matching  is  gradually  eroded  (see  for  example  Bereby-
15:347:30748:27:28:62:536:520:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Meyer and Erev, 1998), and obviously elite goalkeepers are very experienced subjects in facing 
15:348:30843:28:27:62:537:492:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:penalty  kicks.  This  supports  the  conclusion  that  probability  matching  does  not  seem  to  be  the  
15:349:30952:27:28:62:486:465:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:reason for the surprisingly low frequency of goalkeepers choosing to stay in the center.  
15:350:31042:28:28:80:536:437:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:We  propose  that  the  reason  for  goalkeepers  not  staying  in  the  center  is  action  bias.  Because  
15:351:31151:28:27:62:536:409:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the norm (as can be easily seen in the data) is that goalkeepers choose action (jumping to one of 
15:352:31249:27:28:62:537:382:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the  sides)  rather  than  inaction  (staying  in  the  center),  norm  theory  (see  Kahneman  and  Miller,  
15:353:31359:28:27:62:538:354:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:1986)  predicts  that  a  negative  outcome  would  be  amplified  following  inaction.  That  is,  an  
15:354:31463:27:28:62:538:327:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:identical  negative  outcome  (a  goal  being  scored)  is  perceived  to  be  worse  when  it  follows  
15:355:31568:28:28:62:536:299:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:inaction rather than action. The intuition why is that if the goalkeeper jumps and a goal is scored, 
15:356:31669:28:27:62:536:271:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:he might feel "I did my best to stop the ball, by jumping, as almost everyone does; I was simply 
15:357:31766:27:28:62:537:244:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:unlucky  that  the  ball  headed  to  another  direction  (or  could  not  be  stopped  for  another  reason)."  
15:358:31879:28:27:62:536:216:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:On the other hand, if the goalkeeper stays in the center and a goal is scored, it looks as if he did 
15:359:31980:27:28:62:536:189:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:not do anything to stop the ball (remaining at his original location, the center) – while the norm is 
15:360:32082:28:28:62:536:161:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:to do something – to jump. Because the negative feeling of the goalkeeper following a goal being 
15:361:32179:28:27:62:538:133:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:scored  (which  happens  in  most  penalty  kicks)  is  amplified  when  staying  in  the  center,  the  
15:362:32284:27:28:62:537:106:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:goalkeeper  prefers  to  jump  to  one  of  the  sides,  even  though  this  is  not  optimal,  exhibiting  an  
15:363:32396:28:0:62:132:78:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:"action bias."

16:366:32449:27:28:80:541:713:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Our   explanation   discussed   above   for   the   seemingly   non-optimal   decision   making   by   
16:367:32552:28:27:62:537:685:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:goalkeepers is based on the argument that the norm is to jump to one of the sides rather than to 
16:368:32649:27:28:62:535:658:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:stay in the center. While it is evident from the data that goalkeepers almost always jump to one of 
16:369:32749:28:27:62:537:630:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the  sides  and  therefore  this  can  be  considered  the  norm,  we  wanted  to  test  the  assertion  that  
16:370:32860:27:28:62:536:603:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:jumping is the norm directly, by asking the top professional goalkeepers for their opinion. Since 
16:371:32958:28:28:62:537:575:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:getting  such  top  goalkeepers  to  participate  in  a  survey  provides  a  rare  and  not  easily-obtained  
16:372:33069:28:27:62:537:547:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:opportunity  to  look  into  the  attitudes  of  top  goalkeepers,  we  decided  also  to  examine  whether  
16:373:33178:27:28:62:536:520:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:their attitudes about penalty kicks support our conjecture that goalkeepers feel worse when they 
16:374:33275:28:27:62:539:492:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:do  not  stop  a  penalty  kick  following  inaction  (staying  in  the  center)  than  following  action

16:379:33725:28:27:62:536:354:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:league in Israel), and of the opening (and therefore better) goalkeeper in each of the teams in the 
16:380:33825:27:28:62:536:327:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:National  League  (the  second  highest  league).  Since  each  league  has  12  teams,  this  resulted  in  a  
16:381:33937:28:28:62:538:299:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:list  of  36  goalkeepers,  which  represent  the  top  professional  goalkeepers  in  Israel.  One  of  the  
16:382:34047:28:27:62:537:271:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:authors  used  his  extensive  network  of  connections  in  the  soccer  industry  to  obtain  the  contact  
16:383:34157:27:28:62:537:244:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:details  of  these  professional  goalkeepers.  Eventually  we  were  able  to  obtain  contact  details  and  
16:384:34268:28:27:62:414:216:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:approval to participate in the study from 32 out of these 36 goalkeepers.  
16:385:34343:27:28:80:536:189:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:The results of questions 1 and 2 in the survey can be used to construct for each goalkeeper an 
16:386:34438:28:28:62:537:161:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:order  of  perceived  normality  among  the  three  options  (the  option  that  is  neither  chosen  as  the  
16:387:34549:28:27:62:536:133:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:most  normal  nor  as  the  least  probable  is  the  intermediate  one).  For  example,  we  can  denote  by  
16:388:34660:27:28:62:536:106:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:RLC a goalkeeper who considered Right to be the most normal action and Center to be the least 
16:389:34754:28:0:62:536:78:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:probable. Four different patterns of choice appear in the data. 16 goalkeepers chose RLC, 9 chose 
17:390:34854:0:27:62:536:768:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:LRC,  5  chose  CLR,  and  2  chose  CRL.  Since  we  are  not  interested  in  differences  between  right  
17:391:34963:27:28:62:536:741:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:and left but only in differences between center and jumping (denoted by J), we can combine RLC 
17:392:35058:28:28:62:537:713:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:and  LRC  to  a  choice  category  of  JJC,  and  combine  CLR  and  CRL  to  a  choice  category  of  CJJ  
17:393:35166:28:27:62:536:685:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:(notice  that  no  goalkeeper  exhibited  a  choice  of  the  type  JCJ).  We  therefore  have  25  choices  of  
17:394:35279:27:28:62:536:658:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:JJC, representing goalkeepers who think jumping is more normal than staying in the center, and 7 
17:395:35376:28:27:62:539:630:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:choices  of  CJJ,  representing  the  opposite.  The  results  therefore  support  our  hypothesis  that  
17:396:35482:27:28:62:537:603:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:jumping  is  perceived  as  the  norm  (as  our  data  from  study  1  also  suggested),  χ2  (1,  N  =  32)  =  
17:397:35595:28:28:62:150:575:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:10.13, p = 0.001.  
17:398:35614:28:27:80:536:547:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:The third question tries to measure the regret from the same outcome – a goal being scored – 
17:399:35707:27:28:62:538:520:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:but  following  three  different  possible  actions  –  jumping  right,  left,  or  staying  in  the  center.  
17:400:35818:28:27:62:535:492:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Unfortunately, 15 out of the 32 goalkeepers gave the highest possible rating (10, “feel very bad”) 
17:401:35917:27:28:62:537:465:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:to  all  three  outcomes.  The  ceiling  effect  for  these  goalkeepers  does  not  allow  for  meaningful  
17:402:36026:28:28:62:536:437:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:comparison  between  the  different  situations.  Two  goalkeepers  gave  the  same  response  (but  less  
17:403:36133:28:27:62:535:409:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:than 10) to all three scenarios. Of the remaining 15 goalkeepers, 11 indicated that they would feel 
17:404:36233:27:28:62:535:382:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:worse about a goal being scored when staying in the center than when jumping to either side, and 
17:405:36330:28:27:62:537:354:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:4  indicated  the  opposite  pattern  (χ2  (1,  N  =  15)  =  3.27,  p  =  0.07).  An  exact  calculation  using  a  
17:406:36447:27:28:62:535:327:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:binomial distribution shows that the probability of getting up to 4 successes out of 15 trials (with 
17:407:36548:28:28:62:538:299:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:success  probability  in  each  trial  of  0.5)  is  0.059.  This  implies  that  the  one-tailed  test  of  the  
17:408:36662:28:27:62:536:271:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:hypothesis that goalkeepers feel worse about a goal being scored when staying in the center has a 
17:409:36760:27:28:62:537:244:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:p-value  of  0.059.  While  these  results  are  not  statistically  significant  at  the  5%  level,  they  are  at  
17:410:36878:28:27:62:539:216:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:least  compatible  with  our  hypothesis  that  goalkeepers  feel  worse  about  a  goal  being  scored  
17:411:36983:27:28:62:536:189:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:following inaction (staying in the center) than following action (jumping), which can lead them to 
17:412:37082:28:28:62:282:161:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:jump to the sides more often than is optimal.  
17:413:37129:28:0:80:83:133:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6: 
18:414:37131:0:27:62:134:768:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:5. Conclusion 
18:415:37145:27:28:80:537:741:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:We  hypothesized  that  soccer  goalkeepers  jump  to  the  sides  during  penalty  kicks  more  than  
18:416:37248:28:28:62:538:713:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:they  should.  The  analysis  of  286  penalty  kicks  in  various  soccer  games  in  top  leagues  and  
18:417:37354:28:27:62:536:685:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:championships worldwide shows that while the utility-maximizing behavior for goalkeepers is to 
18:418:37449:27:28:62:537:658:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:stay in the goal's center during the kick, in 93.7% of the kicks the goalkeepers chose to jump to 
18:419:37547:28:27:62:536:630:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:their right or left. This non-optimal behavior suggests that a bias in goalkeepers' decision making 
18:420:37647:27:28:62:536:603:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:might be present. According to our hypothesis, the reason for this non-optimal behavior is "action 
18:421:37746:28:28:62:538:575:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:bias"  –  the  opposite  of  the  more  famous  "omission  bias."  The  reason  that  the  usual  bias  is  
18:422:37854:28:27:62:537:547:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:reversed  here  is  that  usually  the  norm  is  to  choose  inaction,  while  in  the  goalkeepers  case,  the  
18:423:37968:27:28:62:364:520:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:norm is to act (jump to the side rather than stay in the center).  
18:424:38035:28:27:80:537:492:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:According  to  the  norm  theory  (Kahneman  and  Miller,  1986),  people  have  stronger  feelings  
18:425:38136:27:28:62:538:465:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:associated  with  outcomes  when  they  come  from  abnormal  causes.  Consequently,  because  the  
18:426:38236:28:28:62:537:437:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:norm  is  that  goalkeepers  jump  to  one  of  the  sides,  the  disutility  associated  with  missing  a  ball  
18:427:38350:28:27:62:536:409:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:might be greater following a non-common behavior (staying in the center) than following normal 
18:428:38445:27:28:62:538:382:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:behavior  (jumping  to  the  side).  Thus,  we  claim  that  elite  goalkeepers'  behavior  in  our  data,  
18:429:38553:28:27:62:535:354:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:despite their vast experience and the huge incentives involved, exhibits the action bias. The action 
18:430:38654:27:28:62:540:327:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:bias   explains   the   intriguing   difference   between   goalkeepers'   optimal   behavior   and   actual   
18:431:38765:28:28:62:536:299:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:behavior. This study demonstrates that the action/omission bias can exist even in a natural setting 
18:432:38865:28:27:62:537:271:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:with  huge  financial  incentives  to  decide  correctly,  and  where  the  decision  makers  are  highly  
18:433:38972:27:28:62:290:244:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:experienced in the decision they have to make. 
18:434:39019:28:27:80:537:216:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:To  reinforce  the  findings  in  the  first  study  and  our  interpretation  of  them,  we  conducted  a  
18:435:39127:27:28:62:536:189:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:second study in which we elicited the attitudes and opinions of top professional goalkeepers. The 
18:436:39225:28:28:62:536:161:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:results support our claim (which was based on the data collected in the first study) that the norm 
18:437:39324:28:27:62:537:133:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:during  penalty  kicks  is  that  the  goalkeeper  jumps  to  one  of  the  sides  and  does  not  stay  in  the  
18:438:39438:27:28:62:540:106:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:goal's   center.   The   results   are   also   compatible   with   our   explanation   for   the   tendency   of   
18:439:39554:28:0:62:537:78:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:goalkeepers  to  jump  more  than  is  optimal,  which  suggests  that  goalkeepers  feel  worse  about  a  
19:440:39664:0:27:62:539:768:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:goal  being  scored  when  it  follows  from  inaction  (staying  in  the  center)  than  from  action  
19:441:39768:27:28:62:116:741:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:(jumping). 
19:442:39779:28:28:80:535:713:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:We want to stress that the argument that the goalkeepers are better off choosing to stay in the 
19:443:39875:28:27:62:536:685:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:center  is  based  on  the  current  distribution  of  kicks.  If  goalkeepers  will  always  choose  to  stay  in  
19:444:39991:27:28:62:538:658:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the  center,  however,  kickers  will  start  aiming  all  balls  to  the  sides,  and  it  will  no  longer  be  
19:445:40105:28:27:62:537:630:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:optimal  for  the  goalkeeper  to  stay  in  the  center.  The  distribution  of  jumps  and  kicks  that  will  
19:446:40218:27:28:62:536:603:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:constitute  an  equilibrium  (in  which  both  the  kicker  and  the  goalkeeper  will  be  happy  with  their  
19:447:40330:28:28:62:538:575:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:choices  given  what  the  other  players  does)  is  therefore  one  in  which  each  player  randomizes  
19:448:40437:28:27:62:536:547:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:among his various possible actions – known as a mixed-strategy equilibrium. However, here we 
19:449:40530:27:28:62:536:520:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:limit our attention to the question what is optimal  for  goalkeepers  given  the  current  behavior  of  
19:450:40636:28:27:62:536:492:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:kickers; analyzing the mixed-strategy equilibrium of the game is beyond the scope of this article 
19:451:40734:27:28:62:207:465:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:and is left for future research. 
19:452:40767:28:28:80:537:437:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:The  action/omission  bias  has  received  attention  in  psychology,  but  hardly  any  in  economics  
19:453:40871:28:27:62:538:409:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:(one  exception  is  Patt  and  Zeckhauser,  2000).  We  think,  however,  that  it  has  very  important  
19:454:40978:27:28:62:536:382:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:implications for economics and management. For example, the action/omission bias might affect 
19:455:41072:28:27:62:536:354:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the decision of investors whether to change their portfolio (action) or not (inaction). It can affect 
19:456:41174:27:28:62:538:327:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the  choice  of  managers  whether  to  leave  their  company's  strategy  or  investments  unchanged  
19:457:41277:28:28:62:536:299:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:(inaction),  or  to  change  them  (action).  The  bias  may  also  have  implications  for  the  decision  of  
19:458:41389:28:27:62:536:271:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:workers whether to stay in their job (inaction) or look for a better job (action), and one's decision 
19:459:41491:27:28:62:536:244:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:whether to re-locate to another city or not. In the macro-economic level, the action/omission bias 
19:460:41590:28:27:62:537:216:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:may  also  affect  decisions  made  by  governments  and  central  banks  whether  to  change  various  
19:461:41694:27:28:62:538:189:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:policy  variables  (interest  rates,  tax  rates,  various  types  of  expenditures,  etc.),  or  leave  them  
19:462:41805:28:28:62:123:161:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:unchanged.  
19:463:41817:28:27:80:538:133:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Of  particular  relevance  in  these  cases  are  the  results  of  Zeelenberg  et  al  (2002)  about  the  
19:464:41925:27:28:62:536:106:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:effect of previous outcomes on what is considered normal to do. They found that following a bad 
19:465:42021:28:0:62:535:78:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:outcome (losing by a large margin in a previous soccer game), subjects consider action (changing 
20:466:42120:0:27:62:536:768:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the opening team) more normal than inaction, but following a good outcome (winning a previous 
20:467:42214:27:28:62:276:741:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:game), inaction is considered more normal.  
20:468:42258:28:28:80:537:713:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Along  the  same  lines,  we  may  conjecture  that  if  the  economy  has  been  doing  poorly  lately,  
20:469:42364:28:27:62:537:685:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the  central  bank  or  the  government  might  be  tempted  to  "do  something"  and  change  certain  
20:470:42468:27:28:62:537:658:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:economic  variables,  even  if  the  risks  associated  with  the  changes  not  necessarily  outweigh  the  
20:471:42577:28:27:62:538:630:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:possible  benefits.  If  things  turn  bad,  at  least  they  will  be  able  to  say  that  they  tried  to  do  
20:472:42691:27:28:62:536:603:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:something, whereas if they choose not to change anything and the situation continues to be poor 
20:473:42787:28:28:62:537:575:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:(or  becomes  worse),  it  may  be  hard  to  avoid  the  criticism  that  despite  the  warning  signs  they  
20:474:42898:28:27:62:532:547:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:"didn't  do  anything."  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  economy  has  been  doing  well  recently,  policy-
20:475:43006:27:28:62:537:520:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:makers  might  have  a  temptation  not  to  change  anything,  even  if  they  believe  that  changes  can  
20:476:43115:28:27:62:536:492:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:improve the economy further. The reason is that if the economy becomes bad, this might seem a 
20:477:43209:27:28:62:537:465:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:result  of  their  changes  if  they  do  something,  but  if  they  do  nothing,  they  are  less  likely  to  be  
20:478:43325:28:28:62:538:437:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:blamed  for  the  sudden  adverse  change.  Similar  arguments  apply  to  managers  who  consider

25:605:51165:27:28:80:535:741:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:In this appendix we explore what conditions about the independence between the goalkeeper's 
25:606:51257:28:28:62:537:713:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:and  kicker's  choices  are  consistent  with  the  data.  The  hypothesis  of  complete  independence  can  
25:607:51366:28:27:62:536:685:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:be rejected with p-value of 0.006. However, the association between the goalkeeper's and kicker's 
25:608:51464:27:28:62:536:658:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:choices is very weak, leading to the conjecture that the data could result from an aggregation of a 
25:609:51564:28:27:62:538:630:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:small  percentage  of  kicks  in  which  the  goalkeeper  realized  where  the  kick  goes,  and  a  large  
25:610:51672:27:28:62:475:603:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:percentage of kicks where the kick and jump direction were completely independent.  
25:611:51756:28:28:80:536:575:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:Suppose that in C% of the kicks, the way the kicker ran to the ball gave a strong cue about the 
25:612:51852:28:27:62:536:547:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:direction  of  the  kick,  or  the  goalkeeper  took  a  big  risk  and  waited  until  he  clearly  saw  the  kick  
25:613:51969:27:28:62:537:520:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:direction  before  choosing  his  action.  Also  assume  that  in  all  the  other  kicks,  the  kick  and  jump  
25:614:52083:28:27:62:538:492:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:directions  were  completely  independent.  To  see  how  consistent  are  the  results  from  different  
25:615:52189:27:28:62:537:465:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:values  of  C  with  the  data,  we  can  perform  a  Chi-square  test  not  only  based  on  the  marginal  
25:616:52298:28:28:62:536:437:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:distributions (of Table 1), but also taking into account C. For example, suppose that in 10% of the 
25:617:52398:28:27:62:537:409:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:kicks the goalkeeper knew the kick direction before choosing his action (and therefore he chose 
25:618:52494:27:28:62:536:382:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:the same direction as the kick direction). This means that in 9.2 kicks to the left, the goalkeeper 
25:619:52594:28:27:62:535:354:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:chose left because he had information (10% of the 92 kicks to the left), in 8.2 kicks to the center 
25:620:52694:27:28:62:538:327:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:he  chose  center,  and  in  11.2  kicks  to  the  right  he  chose  right.  In  the  other  257.4  kicks,  we  
25:621:52806:28:28:62:538:299:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:compute  the  joint  distribution  of  kicks  and  jumps  based  on  the  marginal  distributions,  i.e.,  
25:622:52913:28:27:62:537:271:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:assuming  independence  between  kicks  and  jumps.  This  gives  us  a  table  of  predicted  values,  
25:623:53017:27:28:62:537:244:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:which  we  can  compare  to  the  actual  data  using  a  Chi-square  test.  For  C  =  10%,  we  obtain  the

26:636:54068:28:27:62:538:490:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:fact,  repeating  this  exercise  for  different  values  of  C  is  interesting,  because  the  p-value  is  not  
26:637:54183:27:28:62:537:463:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:monotonically  increasing  in  C  (because  a  higher  value  of  C  implies  that  the  goalkeeper  knows
