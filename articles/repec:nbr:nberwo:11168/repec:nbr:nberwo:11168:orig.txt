2:25:1135:31:23:71:539:592:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Economists have debated the extent to which strengthening patent protection spurs or detracts from
2:26:1233:23:22:71:539:569:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:technological innovation. In this paper, we examine the reduction of software copyright protection
2:27:1331:22:23:71:539:547:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:in the Lotus v. Borland decision. If patent and copyright protections are substitutes, then weakening
2:28:1432:23:23:71:539:524:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of one form of protection should be associated with an increasing reliance on the other. We find that
2:29:1533:23:22:71:539:501:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the firms affected  by the diminution of copyright protection disproportionately accelerated their
2:30:1631:22:23:71:539:479:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:patenting  in  subsequent  years.  But  little  evidence  can  be  found  for  harmful  effects:  in  fact,  the
2:31:1743:23:30:71:462:456:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:increased reliance on patents is correlated with some positive outcomes for firms.

3:44:2008:27:28:125:524:681:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:One  of  the  most  enduring  questions  in  the  literature  on  the  economics  of 
3:45:2093:28:27:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:technological  change  relates  to  the  impact  of  patent  protection.    Economists  have  hotly 
3:46:2193:27:28:89:524:626:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:debated  the  extent  to  which  allowing  strong  patent  rights  spurs  or  detracts  from 
3:47:2286:28:27:89:220:598:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:technological innovation.   
3:48:2314:27:28:125:128:571:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5: 
3:49:2314:28:28:125:524:543:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:In recent years, a particular hotbed for these discussions has related to the impact 
3:50:2399:28:27:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:of  patents  in  emerging  industries.    A  substantial  literature  on  incomplete  contracting, 
3:51:2498:27:28:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:beginning  with  Grossman  and  Hart  [1986]  and  Hart  and  Moore  [1990],  suggests  that 
3:52:2591:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:firms  will  be  unwilling  to  invest  when  risks  of  expropriation  are  high.    A  number  of 
3:53:2691:27:28:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:critics have charged that these problems are particularly intense in regard to patents: both 
3:54:2784:28:28:89:524:405:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:academic  and  practitioners  have  asserted  that  the  poor  quality  of  patent  reviews  has 
3:55:2881:28:27:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:created   a   “thicket”   of   overlapping   patent   holdings   that   make   these   expropriation 
3:56:2982:27:28:89:524:350:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:problems  likely.    In  particular,  by  granting  large  number  of  property  rights  on  small 
3:57:3081:28:27:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:blocks of technology, patent office officials may make it difficult for firms to access the 
3:58:3173:27:28:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:critical  intellectual  properties  they  need  (see,  for  instance,  Heller  and  Eisenberg  [1998], 
3:59:3276:28:28:89:524:267:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Shapiro [2001], and Ziedonis [2004]).  As a result, firms will have reduced incentives to 
3:60:3366:28:27:89:136:239:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:innovate. 
3:61:3376:27:28:125:128:212:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5: 
3:62:3376:28:27:125:524:184:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:This paper examines these issues by studying the software industry.  Patents have 
3:63:3458:27:28:89:530:157:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:been  intensely  controversial  in  this  industry,  largely  for  the  reasons  delineated  above.   
3:64:3560:28:28:89:524:129:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:The  limited  work  to  date  that  has  made  these  arguments,  especially  Bessen  and  Hunt 
3:65:3656:28:0:89:524:101:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:[2004],  is  frequently  cited  by  policymakers:  see,  for  instance,  the  2003  debate  about 
4:66:3755:0:28:89:524:709:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:software  patents  in  the  European  Parliament.    Other  scholars,  however,  have  disputed 
4:67:3851:28:28:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:these claims (see, for example, Mann [2004]). But to date, the claims regarding impact of 
4:68:3941:28:27:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:patenting  on  the  development  of  the  software  industry  have  received  little  empirical 
4:69:4037:27:28:89:148:626:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:evaluation.  
4:70:4050:28:27:125:128:598:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5: 
4:71:4050:27:28:125:524:571:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:This  paper  is  related  to  earlier  empirical  works,  which  have  largely  focused  on 
4:72:4142:28:28:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:understanding  the  impacts  of  a  single  intellectual  property  policy  reform.    Examples 
4:73:4238:28:27:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:include  studies  of  the  broadening  of  Japanese  patent  scope  (Sakakibara  and  Branstetter 
4:74:4336:27:28:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:[2001]),  the  establishment  of  the  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Federal  Circuit  in  the  United 
4:75:4439:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:States  (Kortum  and  Lerner  [1998],  Hall  and  Ziedonis  [2001]),  and  the  strengthening  of 
4:76:4537:27:28:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:patent protection of pharmaceuticals in such nations as India (Lanjouw [1998]) and Italy 
4:77:4626:28:28:89:250:405:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:(Scherer and Weisburst [1995]).  
4:78:4659:28:27:125:128:377:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5: 
4:79:4659:27:28:125:524:350:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Somewhat  unlike  these  studies,  however,  we  focus  on  a  change  that  involved  an 
4:80:4749:28:27:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:alternative  form  of  intellectual  property  protection:  the  reduction  of  software  copyright 
4:81:4849:27:28:89:525:295:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:protection  in  the Lotus  v.  Borland  decision.    If  patent  and  copyright  protections  are 
4:82:4947:28:28:89:524:267:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:substitutes,  then  the  weakening  of  one  form  of  protection  should  be  associated  with  an 
4:83:5047:28:27:89:524:239:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:increasing reliance on the other.1  We rely on this methodology because there is no single 
4:84:5138:27:57:89:524:212:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:event  that  unambiguously  established  the  patentability  of  software,  while  this  had  the 
4:85:5236:57:7:233:236:155:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:                                                 
4:86:5284:7:17:89:524:148:6:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:1 The view that patents and copyrights are substitutes has emerged from a considerable number of legal and 
4:87:5391:17:11:89:523:131:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:economic analyses of these questions that have been informed by practitioner discussions, including Menell 
4:88:5498:11:12:89:523:120:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:[1989],  Lemley  and  O'Brien  [1997],  and  Mowery  and  Graham  [2003].  It  is  still  possible,  however,  that 
4:89:5614:12:11:89:523:108:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:patents and copyrights are not substitutes. Therefore, their relationship is part of what we are testing when 
4:90:5724:11:11:89:523:97:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:we  examine  empirically  the  impact  of  the  judicial  decisions  concerning  copyright  on  the  level  of  patent 
4:91:5843:11:12:89:119:86:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:filings.

5:93:5853:0:28:89:524:709:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:clear earmarks of a shock to the system.  We examine if the increased reliance on patents 
5:94:5943:28:28:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:after this decision led to a decrease in innovation for the reasons spelled out by the critics. 
5:95:6039:28:27:125:128:653:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5: 
5:96:6039:27:28:125:524:626:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:In  this  analysis,   we  undertake  a  “differences-in-differences”   analysis.    We 
5:97:6126:28:27:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:examine the subset of firms that were most effected by the decision in Lotus v. Borland 
5:98:6213:27:28:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:as determined through an event study around the announcement of the judicial decision, 
5:99:6300:28:28:89:525:543:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:which  we  subsequently  refer  to  as  “interface  firms.”2   (The  results  are  also  robust  to 
5:100:6400:28:27:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:identifying the firms through a subjective classification of which firms were likely to be 
5:101:6491:27:28:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:affected.)  We compare the shifts in the behavior of these firms with other software firms, 
5:102:6583:28:27:89:456:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:which should have been less affected by the increased reliance of patenting. 
5:103:6660:27:28:125:128:433:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5: 
5:104:6660:28:28:125:524:405:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:We  find  that  the  judicial  decision  appears  to  have  had  a  considerable  impact  on 
5:105:6753:28:27:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:patenting.    The  number  of  patent  applications  filed  appears  to  have  increased  more 
5:106:6848:27:28:89:524:350:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:dramatically  for  the  interface  firms  than  the  others.  But  little  evidence  can  be  found  for 
5:107:6953:28:27:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:any  harmful  effects  from  this  policy  shift.  In  fact,  the  increased  reliance  on  patent 
5:108:7052:27:28:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:protection  appears  to  be  correlated  with  significant  growth  in  a  number  of  performance 
5:109:7151:28:28:89:238:267:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f6:measures such as sales levels.

5:111:7182:27:28:125:524:212:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:This  finding  must,  of  course,  be  interpreted  with  caution.    Our  division  between 
5:112:7275:28:27:89:524:184:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:the affected and unaffected firms is somewhat crude.  The environment is a complex one: 
5:113:7363:27:59:89:524:157:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:many  other  changes,  such  as  the  widespread  dissemination  of  the  Internet,  may  have

5:115:7506:8:16:89:520:90:6:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:2  The Lotus v. Borland case concerns the copyrightability of software interfaces. Therefore, we expect that 
5:116:7615:16:0:89:522:74:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:the firms most affected by the judicial decisions develop software in which interfaces are the key elements.

6:126:8249:28:27:125:524:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:The  USPTO  traditionally  was  reluctant  to  grant  patents  on  computer  software 
6:127:8335:27:28:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:inventions.  Through  the  1970s,  the  Office  resisted  granting  such  patents  on  the  grounds 
6:128:8435:28:28:89:524:405:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:that computer programs were mathematical algorithms, and not in the categories allowed 
6:129:8522:28:27:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:by Section 101 of the U.S. Patent Act:  processes, machines, articles of manufacture, and

6:132:8637:27:28:125:524:295:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:The USPTO changed its position after a series of U.S. Supreme Court decisions. 
6:133:8716:28:28:89:524:267:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:In the 1981 case Diamond v. Diehr, the Court ordered the USPTO to grant a patent on an 
6:134:8803:28:27:89:524:239:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:invention involving computer software that determining how rubber should be heated as 
6:135:8889:27:28:89:524:212:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:part of the curing process. The Court stated that because the invention was not merely a 
6:136:8978:28:27:89:524:184:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:mathematical algorithm, but also included steps for processing the rubber, the patent was 
6:137:9068:27:28:89:122:157:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:valid.

7:140:9157:28:28:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f5:v. Bradley, 1981), led to considerable confusion.  Despite the best efforts of lower courts 
7:141:9249:28:27:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:to clarify the decisions, patentees struggled to determine when an invention was merely a 
7:142:9339:27:28:89:524:626:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:mathematical  algorithm,  and  when  it  was  in  fact  a  patentable  invention  that  simply 
7:143:9434:28:27:89:270:598:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:contained a mathematical algorithm.

7:145:9471:28:28:125:524:543:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:In  1995,  the  USPTO  decided  it  was  time  to  develop  guidelines  for  patent 
7:146:9555:28:27:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:examiners  that  reflect  these  recent  court  decisions.  In  its  Final  Computer  Related 
7:147:9649:27:28:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Examination Guidelines, it opened the door to the patentability of most software related 
7:148:9738:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:inventions are now statutory under these guidelines.  In particular, it created "safe harbor" 
7:149:9832:27:28:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:exemptions  for  inventions  having  "significant  post  solution  activity",  meaning  that  the 
7:150:9930:28:28:89:521:405:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:software program is used to control something external to the software program, or "pre-
7:151:10018:28:27:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:computer   process   activity",   meaning   software   programs   that   manipulate   numbers 
7:152:10112:27:28:89:524:350:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:representing  concrete, real world values.  Also, software  can be patented  if it is claimed 
7:153:10206:28:27:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:in connection with a specific machine or product, including such diverse inventions as a 
7:154:10295:27:28:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:graphics  program,  a  spreadsheet,  and  a  word  processing  program.    Many  observers 
7:155:10386:28:28:89:524:267:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:suggested that these guidelines only codified a change that had already been already put 
7:156:10475:28:27:89:155:239:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:into practice.

7:158:10490:28:27:125:524:184:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Meanwhile, the feasibility of copyrights on computer software had been first been 
7:159:10572:27:28:89:524:157:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:suggested  by  the  major  reform  of  the  copyright  system  in  1976.    The  act  had  left 
7:160:10668:28:0:89:524:129:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:ambiguous,  however,  many  of  the  details  about  such  protection.    Through  the  1980 
8:161:10762:0:28:89:524:709:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:amendment  to  the  copyright  act,  Congress  finally  gave  a  statutory  basis  to  copyright 
8:162:10859:28:28:89:410:681:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:protection for software, but important ambiguities still remained.   
8:163:10928:28:27:125:128:653:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5: 
8:164:10928:27:28:125:524:626:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:The  most  important  of  these  related  to  the  scope  of  copyright  protection.    The 
8:165:11020:28:27:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:courts  had  long  recognized  a  distinction  between  copyrights,  which  protects  expression, 
8:166:11118:27:28:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:and  patents,  which  protect  useful  procedures  or  machines.    To  what  extent  did  the 
8:167:11213:28:28:89:356:543:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:protection for software extend beyond the actual code? 
8:168:11268:28:27:125:128:515:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5: 
8:169:11268:27:28:125:524:488:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Three  decisions  in  the  ensuing  dozen  years  highlighted  this  confusion.    In  the 
8:170:11359:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:1986  case, Whelan  v.  Jaslow,  concerned  a  dental  laboratory  management  software 
8:171:11447:27:28:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:system, which a dentist had hired a programmer to write for his minicomputer in the EDL 
8:172:11535:28:28:89:524:405:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:language.    After  a  few  years,  the  programmer  wrote  a  similar  program  for  personal 
8:173:11630:28:27:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:computers in BASIC.  The dentist sued for copyright infringement, even through the new 
8:174:11717:27:28:89:524:350:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:program was in a different language and differed in some respects.  The court, pointing to 
8:175:11808:28:27:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:the  similar  interfaces  used  by  the  new  program,  argued  that  it  was  too  close  to  the 
8:176:11907:27:27:89:340:295:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f7:original program, and thus violated its copyright.

8:178:11959:28:28:125:525:240:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:In  the  1990  case, Lotus  v.  Paperback  Software  and  Mosaic  Software,  the  curt 
8:179:12046:28:27:89:524:212:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:again decided in favor of a plaintiff in an infringement case.  Paperback and Mosaic had 
8:180:12135:27:28:89:524:185:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:both  came  out  with  spreadsheet  pro  grams  that  displayed  extreme  similarities  to  Lotus's 
8:181:12235:28:27:89:524:157:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:1-2-3.  In  the  decision,  the  court  basically  determined  that  a  company  has  the  right  to 
8:182:12336:27:28:89:332:130:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:copyright the "look and feel" of its user interface.

9:184:12391:0:28:125:524:709:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:The  logic  in  these  decisions  was  sharply  criticized  in  the  1991  decision  in 
9:185:12479:28:28:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f5:Computer  Associates  v.  Altai.    In  this  decision,  the  court  found  in  favor  of  the  alleged 
9:186:12583:28:27:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:copyright  infringer,  referring  to  the  precedent  in  the  earlier  cases  as  "inadequate  and 
9:187:12683:27:28:89:524:626:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:inaccurate." In particular, the judge cast doubt on the proposition that the structure of the 
9:188:12777:28:27:89:511:598:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:program or its interfaces could be used to determine whether a program was infringing. 
9:189:12864:27:28:125:128:571:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5: 
9:190:12864:28:28:125:524:543:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:It was against this backdrop that the case between Lotus and Borland was heard. 
9:191:12944:28:27:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Lotus argued that Borland had copied key aspects of its 1-2-3 spreadsheet for the Quattro 
9:192:13034:27:28:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:programs,  including  menu  commands  and  structure,  long  prompts,  keystroke  sequences, 
9:193:13127:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:and  macro  language.    At  the  district  level,  the  court  in  July  1992  made  a  summary 
9:194:13224:27:28:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:judgment  ruling  for  Lotus,  arguing  the  Quattro  program  was  similar  enough  to  infringe 
9:195:13322:28:28:89:524:405:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:on the copyright for the  1-2-3 interface.  Borland appealed to the appellate court for the 
9:196:13414:28:27:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:first  circuit,  which  in  March  1995  reversed  the  decision,  holding  “that  the  Lotus  menu 
9:197:13514:27:28:89:524:350:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:command hierarchy is uncopyrightable subject matter,” because it was little more than a 
9:198:13602:28:27:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:“method of operation.”  Ten months later, this decision was upheld by an equally divided 
9:199:13691:27:28:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Supreme Court.  While the split in the court meant that the decision did not bind beyond 
9:200:13780:28:28:89:524:267:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:the  first  circuit,  the  decisions  attracted  a  great  of  protection  and  were  perceived  as 
9:201:13880:28:27:89:401:239:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:signaling a sharp limitation of the scope of copyright protection.

9:203:13947:28:27:125:527:184:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Thus, the treatment of patenting software changed only gradually over this period.  
9:204:14031:27:28:89:524:157:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:It  seems  hard  to  identify  a  single  event  or  shock  that  shifted  perceptions.    The  value  of 
9:205:14137:28:28:89:524:129:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:copyrights  for  protecting  software,  however,  was  dramatically  revised  downward  as  a 
9:206:14231:28:0:89:525:101:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:means of protecting computer interfaces after the Lotus v. Borland decision.  If these two 
10:207:14323:0:28:89:524:709:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:forms of intellectual property protection were substitutes, the affected firms should have 
10:208:14414:28:28:89:375:681:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:increasingly relied on patent protection after the decision.   
10:209:14477:28:27:89:92:653:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5: 
10:210:14477:27:28:125:524:626:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Although the Computer  Associates v. Altai ruling in 1991 might have influenced 
10:211:14557:28:27:89:525:598:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f6:the affected  firms’ patenting behaviors, its effect  was compounded by the  1992 Lotus v. 
10:212:14648:27:28:89:525:571:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f5:Borland ruling by the district court, in which the Lotus 1-2-3 interface was determined to 
10:213:14739:28:28:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:be  copyrightable.    The  district  court  ruling  also  implies  that  the Altai  ruling  did  not  set 
10:214:14845:28:27:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:much of a precedent for copyrightability of software interfaces. It was the 1996 Supreme 
10:215:14934:27:28:89:525:488:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Court  ruling  of  the Lotus  v.  Borland  case  that  made  the  copyrightability  of  software 
10:216:15031:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:interfaces  abundantly clear. As the 1996 ruling had the clear  earmarks of  a shock to the 
10:217:15123:27:28:89:368:433:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:system, our analysis below will focus on this policy shift.

11:234:16244:28:27:125:521:598:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:In  all,  we  have  51,420  observations  on  15,207  software  companies  for  1990-
11:235:16329:27:28:89:525:571:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:2002.4   The  data  are  available  every  other  year  for  even  years:  1990,  1992,  1994,  1996, 
11:236:16431:28:28:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:1998,  2000  and  2002.    Approximately  12%  of  our  sample  are  firms  that  were  publicly 
11:237:16528:28:27:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:traded  companies  for  all  or  some  of  the  sample  period.  For  these  firms,  we  have  added 
11:238:16629:27:28:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:CUSIPs, allowing the data to be matched to Compustat and CRSP data.  We encountered 
11:239:16713:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:a   few   issues   while   adding   CUSIP   information   to   public   companies.   First,   many 
11:240:16812:27:28:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:companies  in  our  dataset  are  subsidiaries.  We  added  CUSIP  information  of  a  parent 
11:241:16906:28:28:89:524:405:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:company  for  such  companies.  All  information  merged  by  CUSIP  variable,  such  as 
11:242:16995:28:27:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Compustat data, reflects the parent company’s information. Second, we could not locate 
11:243:17082:27:28:89:524:350:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:CUSIP  information  for  about  12  percent  of  all  public  companies  in  our  dataset—some 
11:244:17177:28:27:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:companies  had  ceased  their  operations,  some  companies  became  private,  and  others 
11:245:17268:27:28:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:simply could not be located. Note that some of the firms that report themselves as public 
11:246:17358:28:28:89:524:267:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:in  CorpTech  are  traded  on  the  pink  sheets  or  overseas,  and  thus  are  not  picked  up  by

11:251:17619:12:16:89:524:136:6:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:4 We  define  software  companies  as  those  that  have  at  least  one  detailed  product  classification  beginning 
11:252:17738:16:12:89:523:120:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:with  “SOF.”  That  is,  to  be  included  in  our  dataset,  the  firm  had  to  consider  software  development  as  an 
11:253:17860:12:11:89:523:108:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:intentional  part  of  its  business,  thus  listing  the  category  of  software  it  develops  when  interviewed  by 
11:254:17979:11:11:89:523:97:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:CorpTech.  This  definition  excludes  some  firms  that  patent  software  but  do  not  consider  themselves 
11:255:18090:11:12:89:523:86:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:software companies, such as Hewlett Packard. Subsidiaries of Hewlett Packard (and other such companies) 
11:256:18194:12:0:89:408:74:10:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:are included if they listed at least one software development category (“SOF”). 
12:257:18275:0:28:125:524:709:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:From  patent  data  purchased  from  the  U.S.  Patent  and  Trademark  Office,  we 
12:258:18359:28:28:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:identified  all  software  patents.  We  included  all  patents  classified  under  International 
12:259:18457:28:27:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Classification  (IPC)  G06F  and  granted  between  1976  and  2000––a  total  of  76,920 
12:260:18547:27:28:89:524:626:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:patents. We merged these files using the name and location of the assignee in the USPTO 
12:261:18635:28:27:89:521:598:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:database,  as  well  as  the  subject  of  the  award.    In  total  we  obtained  24,006  patent-to-
12:262:18736:27:28:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:company  matches.    The  unmatched  patents  were  largely  awarded  to  individuals  and 
12:263:18827:28:28:89:193:543:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:foreign corporations.

12:265:18849:27:28:125:524:488:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:The  process  of  matching  the  VentureXpert  data  proceeded  similarly,  exploiting 
12:266:18936:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:the   detailed   name,   location   and   business   line   information   compiled   by   Venture

12:269:19046:28:27:125:524:377:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Table   1   summarizes   the   sample   along   several   key   dimensions   of   firm 
12:270:19133:27:28:89:524:350:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:performance.  The number of patent filings is that in the current and previous year—e.g., 
12:271:19223:28:27:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:for  2000,  the  tabulation  includes  filings  made  in  1999  and  2000—while  for  the  other 
12:272:19320:27:28:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:measures,  the  revenues  and  the  employment  at  the  end  of  the  year  are  tabulated.    The 
12:273:19420:28:28:89:521:267:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:compilation  of  successful  patent  applications  only  includes  patents  awarded  as  of  mid-
12:274:19517:28:27:89:524:239:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:2003.  Thus, the compilation for 2000 is sharply lower than the others, not because fewer 
12:275:19607:27:28:89:524:212:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:flings had been made, but because few of those filed in this period had yet issued.  Little 
12:276:19699:28:27:89:524:184:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:time trend is apparent: this reflects the fact that while many of the established firms grew 
12:277:19792:27:28:89:467:157:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:rapidly over this period, there was also considerably entry of small new firms.

13:280:19889:0:28:125:524:709:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:We now proceed to analyze the patterns seen in the data.  We first discuss the way 
13:281:19972:28:28:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:in  which  we  classify  the  observations  into  the  group  that  are  and  are  not  likely  to  be 
13:282:20075:28:27:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:affected  by  the Lotus  v.  Borland  decision.    We  then  present  the  results  regarding 
13:283:20169:27:28:89:524:626:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:patenting and other indicators of firm success.  Finally, we discuss the robustness of the 
13:284:20260:28:27:89:126:598:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:results. 
13:285:20269:27:28:125:128:571:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5: 
13:286:20269:28:28:143:267:543:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A. Classifying the Firms 
13:287:20293:28:27:125:524:515:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A central challenge here is to separate the firms into those likely to be affected by 
13:288:20379:27:28:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:the  copyright  decision  and  not.    There  was  no  one,  obvious  approach  to  addressing  this 
13:289:20480:28:27:89:306:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:issue.  We thus took a variety of approaches. 
13:290:20526:27:28:125:128:433:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5: 
13:291:20526:28:28:125:524:405:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Our preferred approach was the most objective: to look at the types of firms most 
13:292:20608:28:27:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:affected  by  these  decisions.    To  implement  this,  we  looked  at  the  subset  of  publicly 
13:293:20707:27:28:89:525:350:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f6:traded  software  firms  around  the  time  of  the  three  judicial  decisions  in  the Lotus  v. 
13:294:20806:28:27:89:525:322:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f5:Borland case.5   We  estimated  an  event  study,  where  one  observation  was  used  for  each 
13:295:20903:27:28:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:firm and each judicial decision.  The dependent variable was the actual return of the firm 
13:296:20994:28:28:89:524:267:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:in  a  window  around  the  event.  As  independent  variables,  we  employ  dummy  variables 
13:297:21088:28:27:89:524:239:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:denoting the 359 distinct technology classes into which the firms were sorted, as well as 
13:298:21178:27:28:89:524:212:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:dummy variables for each observation date.  The industry dummy variables are coded as 
13:299:21264:28:27:89:524:184:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:one if the firm was assigned to that class based on the 1994 classification scheme  when 
13:300:21353:27:8:233:236:157:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:                                                 
13:301:21401:8:18:89:524:149:8:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:5 The three judicial decisions are: 1) on July 31, 1992, the district court ruled that the Lotus menu command 
13:302:21511:18:11:89:523:131:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:hierarchy  was  copyrightable  expression  and  Borland  had  illegally  copied  large  parts  of  the  Lotus  1-2-3 
13:303:21628:11:12:89:523:120:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:command structure; 2) on March 9, 1995, the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the 1992 ruling and 
13:304:21733:12:11:89:523:108:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:determined  that  Lotus'  menu  structures,  incorporated  into  Borland's  Quatro  Pro  spreadsheet,  are  "an 
13:305:21845:11:11:89:523:97:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:uncopyrightable method of operation"; and  3) on January 16, 1996 the Supreme Court upholds the ruling, 
13:306:21949:11:12:89:283:86:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:thus affirming the decision by the appeal court.  
13:307:21999:12:0:89:91:74:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5: 
14:308:22001:0:28:89:524:709:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:such  scheme  is  recorded  by  Corptech  or  the  classification  scheme  in  the  closest  year  to 
14:309:22103:28:28:89:128:681:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:1994.    
14:310:22112:28:27:125:128:653:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5: 
14:311:22112:27:28:125:524:626:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:We  alternatively  use  the  absolute  return  of  the  firm  and  the  actual  return  as  a 
14:312:22206:28:27:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:dependent  variable.    In  the  case  of  the  actual  return,  as  the  decision  on  the  district  level 
14:313:22315:27:28:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:was favorable to copyright holders, we negate the actual return in the window around that 
14:314:22405:28:28:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:event.  If  we  wish  to  identify  the  firms  most  adversely  affected  by  the  decisions,  we 
14:315:22504:28:27:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:should look at the ones who have the most persistently negative  reaction.  These should 
14:316:22593:27:28:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:be  the  firms  that  relied  most  heavily  on  copyright  protection.    But  this  view  is  a  little 
14:317:22699:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:problematic:   after   all,   our   dataset   contains   both   copyright   holders   and   copyright 
14:318:22801:27:28:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:infringers.  A judicial decision that is unfavorable to one group would be favorable to the 
14:319:22893:28:28:89:524:405:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:other.  A  better  approach  is  to  examine  the  absolute  returns.    The  firms  that  moved  the 
14:320:22995:28:27:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:most in response to the  decisions, whether in a positive or negative manner, may be the 
14:321:23084:27:28:89:252:350:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:most appropriate ones to employ. 
14:322:23117:28:27:125:128:322:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5: 
14:323:23117:27:28:125:524:295:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:We  use  different  event  windows  to  reflect  possible  delays  in  incorporating  the 
14:324:23207:28:28:89:524:267:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:information  into  the  stock  price.    While  the  judicial  decisions  have  a  clear  timing,  there 
14:325:23312:28:27:89:524:239:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:may be lags associated with understanding the implications of the decisions for particular 
14:326:23403:27:28:89:524:212:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:firms.  We thus use windows from one day before to one day after up to three days before 
14:327:23492:28:27:89:187:184:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:to three days after.   
14:328:23515:27:28:125:128:157:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5: 
14:329:23515:28:28:125:524:129:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:We  then  examine  the  coefficients  on  the  technology  classes  based  on  the 
14:330:23598:28:0:89:524:101:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:regressions.  If the coefficient takes on the expected sign and is significant at the .2 level 
15:331:23695:0:28:89:524:709:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:in  a  two-sided,  we  define  this  as  a  “strongly”  affected  class.    If  the  coefficient  takes  on 
15:332:23803:28:28:89:527:681:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:the expected sign but is significant at a lower level, we define this as a “medium” class.  
15:333:23895:28:27:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Otherwise,  we  regard  it  as  unaffected.    We  then  assign  all  firms—whether  public  or 
15:334:23991:27:28:89:524:626:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:private—in the strong class or alternatively in the strong and medium class to be the ones 
15:335:24082:28:27:89:305:598:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:we anticipate being affected by the decision.

15:337:24128:28:28:125:527:543:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:An  alternative  approach  is  to  rely  on  industry  knowledge  to  classify  the  firms.  
15:338:24221:28:27:89:525:515:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:We  also  undertake  an a  priori classification,  assigning  firms  in  a  variety  of  technology 
15:339:24321:27:28:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:classes to be likely to be affected by the decision.  These are categories where we believe 
15:340:24413:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:interfaces to be particularly important: accounting, banking, education, file management, 
15:341:24503:27:28:89:328:433:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:financial analysis, health services, and insurance.

15:343:24555:28:27:125:524:377:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Table  2  summarizes  the  different  classification  schemes  employed.    It  indicates 
15:344:24645:27:28:89:524:350:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:for  each  approach  the  number  of  firms  assigned  to  the  strong  and  medium  groups.    We 
15:345:24744:28:27:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:also  compare  the  distribution  to  that  in  the  scheme  we  ultimately  relied  on  for  the  base 
15:346:24848:27:28:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:analysis:  using  the  absolute  returns  and  the  window  from  two  days  before  to  two  days 
15:347:24947:28:28:89:524:267:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:after  the  decision.    One  encouraging  aspect  is  the  considerable  degree  of  overlap  across 
15:348:25049:28:27:89:524:239:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:the  different  schemes:  in  each  case,  including  our a  priori classification,  we  are 
15:349:25142:27:28:89:524:212:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:disproportionately  choosing  the  same  firms  as  the  affected  ones.  In  the  following 
15:350:25235:28:27:89:524:184:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:analysis,  we  consider  those  firms  who  are  assigned  to  the  strong  or  median  groups  as 
15:351:25334:27:28:89:168:157:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:interface firms.

15:353:25362:28:0:143:353:101:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B. Impact on Patenting and  Firm Growth 
16:354:25403:0:28:125:524:709:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:We now proceed to understand the impact of the shift on patenting and measures 
16:355:25482:28:28:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:of  firm  performance.    The  patenting  analysis  can  be  understood  as  a  validation  exercise 
16:356:25583:28:27:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:for  our  selection  process.    If  there  is  no  increase  in  relative  number  patent  applications 
16:357:25688:27:28:89:525:626:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:filed for the group presumably affected by the Lotus v. Borland decision, we must worry 
16:358:25776:28:27:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:that  our  identification  of  these  firms  is  problematic  or  that  our  claim  that  patents  and 
16:359:25879:27:28:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:copyrights  are  substitutes  is  problematic.  We  then  focus  on  firm  performance.    If  the 
16:360:25978:28:28:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:arguments  outlined  in  the  introduction  are  valid,  we  should  see  detrimental  effects  from 
16:361:26079:28:27:89:302:515:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:the increasing reliance on patent protection.

16:363:26125:28:27:125:524:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Figure  1  displays  the  basic  pattern  regard  to  patenting.    The  number  of  patent 
16:364:26217:27:28:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:applications  filed  by  interface  firms  exceeds  that  by  non-interface  firms  after  1992.  In 
16:365:26318:28:28:89:524:405:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:particular, beginning with 1995-96 there seems to be a substantial increase in the rate of 
16:366:26409:28:27:89:140:377:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:patenting. 
16:367:26420:27:28:125:128:350:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5: 
16:368:26420:28:27:125:524:322:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Table  3  presents  similar  before  and  after  data  for  seven  indicators  of  firm 
16:369:26508:27:28:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:performance: sales, total assets, market capitalization, the number of employees, sales per 
16:370:26600:28:28:89:524:267:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:employee,  R&D  expenditure  and  the  number  of  product  lines.    In  the  case  of  sales  and 
16:371:26700:28:27:89:524:239:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:employees, as well as the ratio, we have data on the majority of the firms in the CorpTech 
16:372:26791:27:28:89:524:212:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:database.    In  the  case  of  the  others,  we  have  data  only  for  the  much  smaller  subset  of 
16:373:26895:28:27:89:524:184:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:firms that are in Compustat.  The table presents the mean, median and standard deviation 
16:374:26984:27:28:89:524:157:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:of  each  performance  indicator  for  interface  firms  and  non-interface  firms  respectively. 
16:375:27082:28:28:89:521:129:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:We  observe  that  the  growth  rate  for  interface  firms  is  greater  than  the  one  for  non-
16:376:27181:28:0:89:524:101:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:interface firms in several cases such as sales in 1996 and 1998, and number of employees 
17:377:27272:0:28:89:524:709:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:in  1996.  Interestingly,  interface  firms  have  been  expanding  their  product  lines  more 
17:378:27368:28:28:89:446:681:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:rapidly than non-interface firms in all even years between 1990 and 1998.

17:380:27442:27:28:125:524:626:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:We  then  turn  to  examining  these  patterns  in  a  regression  framework.    We  first 
17:381:27533:28:27:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:examine  the  impact  of  the Lotus  v.  Borland  ruling  on  patenting.  We  undertake  a 
17:382:27624:27:28:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:“difference-in-difference”  approach  to  compare  the  differences  in  patenting  activities 
17:383:27719:28:28:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:before  and  after  the  policy  shift  for  those  affected  and  those  not.  Table  4  presents  the 
17:384:27823:28:27:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:results   from   three   different   regression   specifications:   Poisson,   OLS   and   Negative 
17:385:27923:27:28:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Binomial.  For the Poisson and Negative  Binomial specifications, the number of patents 
17:386:28011:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:filed  in  the  current  and  previous  year  is  used  as  the  dependent  variable.  For  the  OLS 
17:387:28112:27:28:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:specification,  the  natural  logarithm  of  (the  number  of  patents  filed  in  the  current  and 
17:388:28213:28:28:89:524:405:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:previous  year  +  1)  is  used  as  the  dependent  variable.  Year  dummies,  the  dummy  for 
17:389:28309:28:27:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:interface  firm  and  the  interaction  terms  between  interface  firm  and  year  dummies  are 
17:390:28406:27:28:89:239:350:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:used as explanatory variables.

17:392:28438:27:28:125:524:295:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:As  the  observed  difference  in  patenting  activities  may  result  from  underlying 
17:393:28526:28:28:89:524:267:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:shifts in firm-level or industry-level characteristics rather than the policy shift, we need to 
17:394:28622:28:27:89:524:239:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:control  for  these  characteristics.  We  thus  include  firm-level  controls  such  as  the  age  of 
17:395:28725:27:28:89:480:212:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:the firm, lagged value of the sales and the lagged total number of patents filed. 6

17:397:28810:27:28:125:524:157:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Entry  rate  in  each  technology  class  is  also  used  to  control  for  industry-level 
17:398:28901:28:20:89:524:129:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:competition, as firms may rely more heavily on patents to gain competitive advantages as

17:400:29038:8:15:89:524:101:6:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:6 In all our regression analyses, lagged values for year t are referring to the values in year t-2 (reflecting the 
17:401:29153:15:12:89:280:86:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:fact we have observations on a biannual basis).

18:403:29203:0:28:89:524:709:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:the industry becomes more competitive. The entry rate is calculated as the ratio between 
18:404:29292:28:28:89:527:681:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:the number of new entries in a technology class and the total number of firms in that class. 
18:405:29385:28:27:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:For firms that have multiple lines of business, we use the average of the entry rate in each 
18:406:29478:27:28:89:524:626:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:technology  class  that  the  firms  have  been  sorted  into.  It  is  possible  that  some  firms  in  a 
18:407:29585:28:27:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:technology  class  are  not  recorded  by  CorpTech.  Those  firms  are  most  likely  small  ones 
18:408:29684:27:28:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:so that they were not on CorpTech’s radar screen. Thus the presence of those firms would 
18:409:29773:28:28:89:366:543:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:not have a large impact on the competitive environment.  
18:410:29830:28:27:125:128:515:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5: 
18:411:29830:27:28:125:524:488:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:As we do not have any observations before year 1990, we are not able to compute 
18:412:29910:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:the entry rates in year 1990.  Therefore, in our analysis we exclude year 1990. Also as our 
18:413:30002:27:28:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:dataset  only  contains  very  few  patent  applications  filed  between  1999  and  2000,  we 
18:414:30097:28:28:89:260:405:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:exclude year 2000 in our analysis.7

18:416:30132:27:28:125:524:350:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:The results in Table 4 are consistent with the hypothesis that the reduction in the 
18:417:30216:28:27:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:copyright  protection  leads  to  more  patenting,  as  evidenced  by  the  significantly  positive 
18:418:30316:27:28:89:527:295:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:coefficients  for  the  interaction  terms  between  the  interface  dummy  and  year  dummies.  
18:419:30413:28:28:89:524:267:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Our results also indicate several things. First, given everything else equal, interface firms 
18:420:30507:28:27:89:524:239:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:tend  to  file  fewer  patents  than  non-interface  firms  on  average.  Second,  firms  tend  to 
18:421:30606:27:28:89:524:212:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:patent  more  if  they  have  filed  many  patent  applications  in  the  past.  Finally,  a  more 
18:422:30705:28:27:89:482:184:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:competitive environment tends to motivate firms to file more patent applications.

18:425:30835:9:19:89:523:105:8:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:7 In  addition,  we  are  concerned  that  the State  Street case  (resolved  by  the  Supreme  Court  in  1999)  may 
18:426:30953:19:12:89:510:86:10:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:have increased the number of financial patents and thus made the regression results difficult to interpret. 
18:427:31061:12:0:89:94:74:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:  
19:428:31065:0:28:125:524:709:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:We   now   proceed   to   examine   the   impact   of   patenting   activities   on   firms’ 
19:429:31158:28:28:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:performance.  The  correlation  between  a  firm’s  patenting  activity  and  its  performance  is 
19:430:31257:28:27:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:difficult  to  examine  directly  as  both  of  them  may  be  caused  by  third  factors  such  as  the 
19:431:31362:27:28:89:525:626:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:size  of  the  firm.  The Lotus  v.  Borland  decision  presents  an  exogenous  shock  and  thus 
19:432:31460:28:27:89:527:598:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:enables  us  to  employ  the  instrumental  estimator  to  address  this  endogeneity  problem.  
19:433:31557:27:28:89:527:571:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Table 5 reports the results. The regressions presented in Table 4 are used as the first stage. 
19:434:31652:28:28:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:In  the  second  stage,  we  use  the  predicted  number  of  patents  from  the  first  stage  as  an 
19:435:31755:28:27:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:instrumented  variable.    In  Table  5,  the  predicted  number  of  patents  is  derived  from  the 
19:436:31857:27:28:89:305:488:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:full-model Poisson specification in Table 4.  
19:437:31903:28:27:125:128:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5: 
19:438:31903:27:28:125:524:433:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:For dependent variables, we use the growth rates of seven measures:  sales, total 
19:439:31985:28:28:89:524:405:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:asset,  market  capitalizations,  employment,  sales  per  employee,  R&D  expenditure  and 
19:440:32077:28:27:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:number of lines of business. As above, each observation of a firm at a two-year interval is 
19:441:32169:27:28:89:268:350:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:used as an independent observation.  
19:442:32206:28:27:125:128:322:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5: 
19:443:32206:27:28:125:524:295:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:We  first  estimate  the  growth  measures  without  using  the  patenting  variable.  The 
19:444:32297:28:28:89:524:267:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:idea here is to examine whether firms in sectors with more generous patent policies grow 
19:445:32386:28:27:89:524:239:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:more  rapidly,  regardless  of  their  specific  patenting  activity.  Then  we  add  the  lagged 
19:446:32484:27:28:89:524:212:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:predicted  number  of  patents  and  its  interaction  with  interface  and  year  dummies  to 
19:447:32579:28:27:89:524:184:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:examine  to  what  extent  the  difference  in  their  patenting  activity  affects  their  financial 
19:448:32681:27:28:89:524:157:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:performance.  As  control  variables,  we  first  employ  the  lagged  value  of  each  growth 
19:449:32776:28:28:89:524:129:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:measure:  for  instance,  the  level  of  sales  at  the  beginning  of  the  two-year  interval  if  the 
19:450:32882:28:0:89:524:101:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:growth rate of sales is used as the dependent variable.  We also include entry rate and the 
20:451:32976:0:28:89:524:709:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:age  of  the  firm.  An  OLS  specification  is  used  for  all  regressions.  We  then  repeat  the 
20:452:33077:28:28:89:530:681:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:above procedures for the inception of venture financing. A probit model is employed here.  
20:453:33168:28:27:125:128:653:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5: 
20:454:33168:27:28:125:524:626:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:As  reported  in  Table  5,  we  find  little  evidence  that  more  generous  or  restrictive 
20:455:33263:28:27:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:patent policies significantly affect the growth rates of the firms: in almost all regressions 
20:456:33357:27:28:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:without the predicted patenting variable, no significant differences between interface and 
20:457:33448:28:28:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:non-interface  firms  are  detected.  Only  in  the  cases  of  sales  growth  in  1996  and 
20:458:33541:28:27:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:employment  growth  in  1998,  we  observe  significant  declines  for  interface  firms.  We  do 
20:459:33639:27:28:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:not have  a  ready  explanation for these declines.  The result for product line expansion is 
20:460:33733:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:consistent  with  our  early  observation  that  interface  firms  in  general  are  more  active  in 
20:461:33835:27:28:89:242:433:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:expanding their business lines.  
20:462:33868:28:28:125:128:405:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5: 
20:463:33868:28:27:125:524:377:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Once we control for firm patenting behavior, we find no evidence for any harmful 
20:464:33949:27:28:89:524:350:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:effects  from  the  judicial  decision:  none  of  the  growth  measures  and  the  inception  of 
20:465:34047:28:27:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:venture  financing  seem  negatively  affected  by  this  policy  shift.  In  fact,  we  find  that  the 
20:466:34152:27:28:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:increased  reliance  on  patent  protection  is  correlated  with  significant  growth  in  sales  and 
20:467:34255:28:28:89:524:267:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:business  lines  in  1996  and  1998,  and  number  of  employees,  market  capitalization  and 
20:468:34351:28:27:89:524:239:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:sales per employee in 1998. We also note that the increased reliance on patenting did not 
20:469:34441:27:28:89:524:212:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:appear to lead to any decrease in innovation, as evidenced by the regression result where 
20:470:34531:28:27:89:321:184:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:R&D growth is used as the dependent variable.

20:472:34578:28:0:143:269:129:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C. Exploring Robustness 
21:473:34603:0:28:125:524:709:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:A natural concern is whether the results above or are a consequence of the way in 
21:474:34685:28:28:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:which the firms were identified or of confounding event.  We thus repeat the analysis in 
21:475:34774:28:27:89:347:653:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:several ways to explore the robustness of the finding. 
21:476:34829:27:28:125:128:626:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5: 
21:477:34829:28:27:125:524:598:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Table  6  summarizes  one  of  these  robustness  analyses.    Rather  than  relying  on  a 
21:478:34921:27:28:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:single  definition  of  what  constitutes  firms  likely  to  be  affected  by  the Lotus  v.  Borland 
21:479:35023:28:28:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:decision, we rely on alternative rules to identify these firms.  In particular, as in Table 2, 
21:480:35118:28:27:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:we  rely  on  different  event  windows  and  relative  rather  than  absolute  returns  for 
21:481:35211:27:28:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:identifying  affected  firms.    The  table  replicates  some  the  analyses  reported  in  Table  4, 
21:482:35313:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:showing  that  the  same  patterns  appear  with  the  alternative  definitions.    In  unreported 
21:483:35412:27:28:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:regressions,  we  show  that  using  the  other  alternative  definitions  in  Table  2  have  little 
21:484:35514:28:28:89:524:405:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:impact on the patenting results, and that the results replicating the analyses in Table 5 are 
21:485:35608:28:27:89:128:377:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:similar. 
21:486:35617:27:28:125:128:350:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5: 
21:487:35617:28:27:125:524:322:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:In  our  analysis,  a  firm  is  considered  as  an  interface  firm  if  it  has  one  or  more 
21:488:35714:27:28:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:business lines in the affected group. This scheme would include firms as interface firms 
21:489:35803:28:28:89:524:267:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:even  if  they  only  have  a  small  portion  of  business  lines  in  the  affected  group.  In  an 
21:490:35905:28:27:89:524:239:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:unreported  analysis,  we  repeat  our  analyses  in  Table  4  and  5  using  a  new  classification 
21:491:36007:27:28:89:524:212:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:scheme  in  which  a  firm  is  considered  affected  only  if  it  has  more  than  50  percent  of  its 
21:492:36113:28:27:89:524:184:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:business  lines  in  the  affected  group.  We  compared  these  firms  to  the  ones  that  have  no 
21:493:36215:27:28:89:506:157:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:business lines in the affected group. The results are similar to those in Tables 4 and 5.  
21:494:36306:28:0:125:128:129:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5: 
22:495:36308:0:28:125:527:709:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:We  were  also  concerned  about  different  user  groups  these  software  firms  target.  
22:496:36400:28:28:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:In  particular,  software  firms  can  develop  software  for  enterprises  or  home  users.  The 
22:497:36498:28:27:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:policy  shift  may  affect  these  two  groups  differently  if  one  group  cares  more  about 
22:498:36594:27:28:89:524:626:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:intellectual  property  protection  than  the  other.  To  address  this  concern,  we  repeat  the 
22:499:36694:28:27:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:analyses,  after  eliminating  all  firms  whose  products  run  on  mainframe  computers.  The 
22:500:36790:27:28:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:results are similar except that when we replicate the analysis in Table 4, the coefficients 
22:501:36882:28:28:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:of  the  interaction  terms,  (interface  *  year  1996)  and  (interface  *  year  1998),  more  than 
22:502:36985:28:27:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:double  in  all  specifications.  This  suggests  that  firms  targeting  at  enterprises  are  less 
22:503:37086:27:28:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:responsive to the judicial decision, possibly due to the fact that interface design is not the 
22:504:37181:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:most important element of their products and they are less affected by the policy shift as a 
22:505:37274:27:28:89:122:433:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:result. 
22:506:37282:28:28:125:128:405:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5: 
22:507:37282:28:27:125:524:377:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Our  fourth  concern  was  whether  the  results  were  shaped  by  confounding  events. 
22:508:37371:27:28:89:524:350:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:In  particular,  was  there  an  event  that  may  have  affected  interface  firms  different  from 
22:509:37472:28:27:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:other  corporations?  We  explore  the  most  visible  candidate:  the  widespread  diffusion  of 
22:510:37570:27:28:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:access  to  the  World  Wide  Web  in  the  mid-1990s.  While  it  is  not  obvious  that  interface 
22:511:37671:28:28:89:524:267:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:firms would be more affected, this possibility is worrisome. To address this concern, we 
22:512:37760:28:27:89:524:239:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:repeat  the  analyses  in  Tables  4  and  5,  now  eliminating  all  firms  geared  towards  the 
22:513:37858:27:28:89:524:212:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Internet  (we  identify  these  by  eliminating  firms  that  develops  products  based  on  Web 
22:514:37955:28:27:89:465:184:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:browsers or have Java as a key software platform.) We obtain similar results.  
22:515:38034:27:28:143:146:157:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6: 
22:516:38034:28:0:107:190:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:5. Conclusions 
23:517:38050:0:28:125:524:709:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:The  growth  of  software  patenting  has  triggered  numerous  concerns  among 
23:518:38130:28:28:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:academics,  practitioners  and  policymakers.    In  particular,  the  diversity  of  the  patent 
23:519:38228:28:27:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:holdings  in  this  area,  and  the  alleged  failure  of  the  patent  awards  to  always  reward  true 
23:520:38333:27:28:89:524:626:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:innovators, have led to concerns of expropriation problems for innovators.  These claims, 
23:521:38423:28:27:89:329:598:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:however, have been little scrutinized empirically. 
23:522:38474:27:28:125:128:571:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5: 
23:523:38474:28:28:125:524:543:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:In  this  paper,  we  focus  on  the  reduction  of  software  copyright  protection  in  the 
23:524:38568:28:27:89:525:515:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f5:Lotus  v.  Borland  decision.    If  patent  and  copyright  protections  are  substitutes,  then  the 
23:525:38671:27:28:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:weakening of one form of protection should be associated with an increasing reliance on 
23:526:38759:28:27:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:the   other.      We   rely   on   this   methodology   because   there   is   no   single   event   that 
23:527:38865:27:28:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:unambiguously   established   the   patentability   of   software,   while   this   had   the   clear 
23:528:38967:28:28:89:257:405:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:earmarks of a shock to the system. 
23:529:39002:28:27:125:128:377:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5: 
23:530:39002:27:28:125:525:350:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f6:We examine the subset of firms that were most affected by the decision in Lotus 
23:531:39082:28:27:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f5:v.  Borland,  as  determined  through  an  event  study  around  the  announcement  of  the 
23:532:39174:27:28:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:judicial  decision,  and  compare  the  shifts  in  the  behavior  of  these  firms  with  other
