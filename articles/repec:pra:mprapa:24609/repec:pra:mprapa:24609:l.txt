2:20:625:14:15:90:525:498:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:piece of financial services regulation to be enacted since the Great Depression, at 
2:21:709:15:14:90:501:483:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:least up to that time.  When the Financial Service Modernization Act of 1999, 
2:22:786:14:15:90:508:469:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:better known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), was signed, the financial 
2:23:861:15:14:90:506:454:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:services industry faced strong pressures for deregulation of the rigid structure 
2:24:942:14:15:90:505:440:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:imposed during the Great Depression. During the 2007-08 financial crises and 
2:25:1017:15:14:90:525:425:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:ensuing debate regarding financial services regulation, the GLBA became a target

3:57:2994:14:13:90:504:583:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:pressures for deregulation of the rigid structure imposed during the Great Depression. 
3:58:3080:13:14:90:493:570:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:During the 2007-08 financial crises and ensuing debate regarding financial services 
3:59:3163:14:14:90:515:556:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regulation, the GLBA became a target as members of the financial sector, academia and 
3:60:3249:14:28:90:466:542:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:government considered possible triggers that may have precipitated the crisis. 
3:61:3327:28:14:90:511:514:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The dramatic events that shook the U.S. financial services sector in 2008, including the 
3:62:3416:14:13:90:524:500:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:deployment of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the failures of some of the 
3:63:3503:13:14:90:512:487:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:C:nation’s largest financial firms, made financial services regulation a heated topic on the 
3:64:3594:14:14:90:521:473:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:national policy agenda. In June 2009, the Obama Administration set forth a new proposal 
3:65:3681:14:14:90:515:459:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:for financial services regulation [see U.S. Treasury (2009)] and the Congress completed 
3:66:3769:14:14:90:509:445:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:action on the reforms in July 2010 in the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection 
3:67:3852:14:13:90:509:431:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Act of 2010, or Dodd-Frank, signed into law on July 21, 2010. While the effects of the 
3:68:3939:13:14:90:491:418:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:new legislation are still uncertain, some lessons about the role of legislation and its 
3:69:4027:14:14:90:524:404:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:implications can be gleaned from reviewing the experience with the GLBA and the recent 
3:70:4112:14:14:90:513:390:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:crisis. Most of the provisions of Dodd-Frank require studies or new regulatory specifics 
3:71:4201:14:14:90:495:376:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:from regulatory authorities, an estimated 500 of them in total. Thus, until those new 
3:72:4286:14:13:90:510:362:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regulations are fleshed out, it is difficult to assess the effects of the Act except to assert 
3:73:4381:13:14:90:521:349:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that it is the largest intrusion of federal regulatory authority since the Glass-Steagall Acts 
3:74:4476:14:14:90:508:335:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of 1933 and 1935.1 This paper reviews the contribution of the GLBA, its critics and its 
3:75:4563:14:28:90:458:321:12:Times New Roman:12:Helvetica:B:effects on the 2007-08 financial crisis and the new Dodd-Frank legislation.   
3:76:4640:28:14:90:361:293:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Why Regulate Banks and Other Financial Institutions 
3:77:4691:14:13:90:499:279:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:After the foreclosure and financial crisis of 2007-09, it may seem strange to ask why 
3:78:4776:13:14:90:497:266:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:political leaders might want to regulate banks or other financial institutions. But this 
3:79:4865:14:14:90:519:252:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:question does not have an answer that is as obvious as it may seem. There are three main 
3:80:4952:14:14:90:513:238:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reasons that have been put forward as justifications for financial regulation.  The first is 
3:81:5045:14:14:90:479:224:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:asymmetric information, that is, that corporations have unequal access to private 
3:82:5124:14:13:90:496:210:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:information that belongs to stockholders and this information is necessary for sound 
3:83:5209:13:14:90:509:197:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:private decision-making by stockholders and other investors. Regulations aim to avoid 
3:84:5295:14:14:90:497:183:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:market failures that would occur if valuable information, which is essentially free or 
3:85:5382:14:14:90:508:169:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:relatively inexpensive, but otherwise private, is not provided to markets; such a failure 
3:86:5471:14:8:90:237:155:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:                                                 
3:87:5519:8:16:90:515:147:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:1 Developing and promulgating new regulations dictated by Dodd-Frank is not the only obstacle.  Most of 
3:88:5622:16:11:90:522:131:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:the issues presented by the financial crisis are unaddressed or not fully addressed by Dodd-Frank so at least 
3:89:5732:11:12:90:522:120:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:another major round in regulatory reform can be expected in the next few years in the United States.  These 
3:90:5840:12:11:90:509:108:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:include a large number of issues raised about fixing too-big-to-fail and how to repair critical holes in the 
3:91:5949:11:12:90:515:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:regulation of complex financial institutions, retirement saving and credit default swaps and other new and 
3:92:6055:12:11:90:504:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:complex instruments, where thoughtful proposals have been developed by the Squam Lake group.  See 
3:93:6153:11:0:90:171:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:French et al (2006). 
4:94:6173:0:14:90:499:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:would reduce capital formation and the size of the corporate sector.  This is the main 
4:95:6257:14:14:90:502:695:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:justification for the regulatory authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
4:96:6341:14:14:90:467:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:which was founded in 1934. This explanation leads to informational reporting 
4:97:6418:14:14:90:515:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:requirements for corporations and disclosure of key financial information that might not 
4:98:6507:14:13:90:524:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:exist, or might not be uniform, otherwise. Note that this does not lead to a special case for 
4:99:6600:13:14:90:487:640:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regulation of banks or financial institutions, only all corporations.2 Some financial 
4:100:6685:14:14:90:524:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economists and analysts, however, believe that these issues are more significant for banks 
4:101:6775:14:14:90:523:612:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and other financial institutions. VanHoose (2010) reviews theories of bank regulation and 
4:102:6864:14:14:90:521:598:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:C:concludes that there is no compelling case for “market failure” to warrant a case for bank 
4:103:6955:14:13:90:494:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regulation. Market failures arising from large external spillovers, significant market 
4:104:7042:13:14:90:520:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:power or so-called informational asymmetries are not found in the empirical literature on 
4:105:7132:14:14:90:134:557:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:banking. 
4:106:7140:14:14:90:93:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
4:107:7140:14:14:90:510:529:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The second rationale is regulatory capture, where efforts by industry incumbents to use 
4:108:7228:14:13:90:491:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:legislation and political authority to secure competitive advantages lead to industry 
4:109:7314:13:14:90:508:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regulation. In this theory, banking firms demand and use state regulation as a means to 
4:110:7401:14:14:90:480:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:protect themselves from competitive entry. VanHoose (2010) concludes that this 
4:111:7477:14:14:90:482:474:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:alternative theory better explains patterns of bank regulation than the asymmetric 
4:112:7560:14:14:90:189:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:information theory.  
4:113:7579:14:13:90:93:446:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
4:114:7579:13:14:90:513:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Another rationale for financial regulation is that fractional reserve banking, the fact that 
4:115:7672:14:14:90:524:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:banks hold cash assets that are a fraction of their liabilities, many of which are payable on 
4:116:7766:14:14:90:478:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:demand, gives rise to an inherent risk of runs on banks that can lead to failure of 
4:117:7849:14:14:90:480:391:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:otherwise solvent banking institutions.  Because of this, legislation providing for 
4:118:7933:14:13:90:524:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:government insurance of bank deposits was adopted in 1933 to create the Federal Deposit 
4:119:8021:13:14:90:513:364:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Not surprisingly, this action led to a further justification 
4:120:8111:14:14:90:513:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:for bank regulation to ensure solvency of banks in order to minimize taxpayer exposure 
4:121:8198:14:14:90:521:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to losses of the FDIC should industry paid premiums be insufficient, as, for example, in a 
4:122:8288:14:14:90:500:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:financial crisis. Such a rationale has led to regulations aimed at limiting competition, 
4:123:8377:14:13:90:499:308:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:such as limits on interest rates paid by banks, entry regulation to protect profit, and a 
4:124:8467:13:14:90:514:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:variety of requirements on asset composition and other operational decisions in order to 
4:125:8556:14:14:90:490:281:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:protect bank profitability and avoid losses and insolvency.  This rationale has been 
4:126:8640:14:14:90:510:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:extended, without serious examination or evidence, to all financial institutions, not just 
4:127:8730:14:14:90:522:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:banks, by the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the U.S. Treasury, with tacit endorsement by the 
4:128:8818:14:13:90:521:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Congress, to encompass the notion that financial institutions can be “too interconnected,” 
4:129:8908:13:14:90:494:226:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:so that shocks in some part of the industry can lead to failures elsewhere.  This may 
4:130:8994:14:14:90:492:212:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f12:B:appear to be similar to the “bank runs” problem, but it is not. There is no end to the 
4:131:9081:14:14:90:480:198:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:potential for losses due to interconnectedness, whether in banking, the rest of the 
4:132:9165:14:14:90:510:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:financial industry or even non-financial business, because all consumers and producers 
4:133:9252:14:13:90:423:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:are connected to varying degrees to others consumers and producers. 
4:134:9319:13:25:90:93:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
4:135:9319:25:8:90:237:132:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:                                                 
4:136:9367:8:16:90:502:124:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:2 Barth, Caprio and Levine (2006), based on a data set of 150 countries, conclude that regulation based 
4:137:9470:16:11:90:489:108:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:upon disclosure and market-based monitoring provide superior outcomes based on a broad range of 
4:138:9566:11:12:90:491:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:desirable regulatory outcomes.  Regulations employing entry restrictions, government ownership or 
4:139:9664:12:11:90:507:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:restrictions on banking activities, such as those arising from regulatory capture adversely affect banking 
4:140:9771:11:0:90:185:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:system performance.     
5:141:9795:0:14:90:500:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:VanHoose (2010) points out that another rationale for financial regulation, consumer 
5:142:9880:14:14:90:489:695:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f12:B:protection, is inadequate. He quotes Benston (2000), who wrote that “most nations 
5:143:9961:14:14:90:497:681:12:g_d0_f12:12:Times New Roman:B:already have broad social regulations to address such issues.”3 This rationale was an 
5:144:10046:14:14:90:511:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:important component of the GLBA and more recently of Dodd-Frank.  VanHoose cites 
5:145:10127:14:13:90:506:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:studies that show that the cost of bank regulation is substantial relative to overall bank 
5:146:10218:13:14:90:522:640:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:expenses; these estimates are striking given the popular notion that deregulation since the 
5:147:10310:14:14:90:358:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:1970s has reduced regulatory costs to negligible levels.

5:149:10366:14:14:90:447:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Looking Back at The GLBA – Great Expectations and Some Skepticism 
5:150:10428:14:13:90:508:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which created the FDIC and other significant banking 
5:151:10513:13:14:90:523:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reforms, contained provisions that prohibited a bank holding company from owning other 
5:152:10600:14:14:90:521:557:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:financial companies.  The GLBA repealed these legal separations, allowing bank holding 
5:153:10686:14:14:90:499:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:companies to own insurance, financial planning/investment firms and other financial 
5:154:10770:14:14:90:515:529:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:service businesses. The “financial holding company” structure allowed banks, securities 
5:155:10858:14:13:90:519:515:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f12:B:firms and insurance companies to offer each other’s products. For example, a bank could 
5:156:10946:13:14:90:524:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:create a financial services holding company to offer insurance or security services; and an 
5:157:11038:14:14:90:514:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:insurance company could provide retail or investment banking services. Essentially, the 
5:158:11126:14:14:90:500:474:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:GLBA broke down the barriers to competition across the financial services portfolio. 
5:159:11210:14:14:90:93:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
5:160:11210:14:13:90:499:446:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The authors of the GLBA expected that the Act would enhance competition between 
5:161:11290:13:14:90:515:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:firms and allow financial services to be provided more efficiently through a streamlined 
5:162:11379:14:14:90:494:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:enterprise. The emergence of electronic and Internet-based banking services largely 
5:163:11463:14:14:90:484:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:negated many of the barriers that had served to make banking a geographic-based 
5:164:11543:14:14:90:524:391:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:delivery system in the past, even without the GLBA. By providing consumers with a “one 
5:165:11629:14:13:90:508:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:stop shop” where they could take care of all of their financial business, the GLBA was 
5:166:11713:13:14:90:479:364:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:intended to optimize consumer convenience. Under the GLBA, banks, insurance 
5:167:11789:14:14:90:482:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:companies, security companies and investment banks could offer their customers 
5:168:11868:14:14:90:498:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:products and services beyond their traditional product portfolios.  Besides, enhanced 
5:169:11953:14:14:90:519:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:competition and efficiency, many thought that the GLBA would open the doors for more 
5:170:12036:14:13:90:519:308:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:product innovation. The reasoning was that if bank holding companies were able to offer 
5:171:12124:13:14:90:515:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:a broader menu of products, they would be inclined to develop new products that would 
5:172:12210:14:14:90:489:281:12:g_d0_f12:12:Times New Roman:B:meet customers’ evolving needs while generating additional revenue for the bank.  
5:173:12290:14:14:90:93:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
5:174:12290:14:14:90:515:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The primary innovations that arose from the GLBA were changes in how products were 
5:175:12373:14:13:90:514:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:distributed as opposed to the development of new products. Under the Act, retail banks, 
5:176:12461:13:14:90:488:226:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:investment banks, insurance companies and securities firms, were able to leverage 
5:177:12543:14:14:90:495:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economies of scope and scale to distribute traditional products from other sectors to 
5:178:12629:14:14:90:465:198:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:better serve the portfolio of financial needs of their customers. This increased 
5:179:12710:14:14:90:515:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:competition in distribution resulted in lower profit margins but also provided new profit 
5:180:12799:14:13:90:505:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:centers in each sector of the industry. For example, while community banks increased 
5:181:12884:13:14:90:486:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:marketing of insurance products and security services, they tended to secure these 
5:182:12967:14:14:90:493:143:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:services from external sources as opposed to developing the services in-house. This 
5:183:13051:14:14:90:520:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:arrangement resulted in security and insurance companies enjoying a sales boost as other 
5:184:13140:14:29:90:507:115:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:institutions promoted their products. Money center and super regional banks benefited 
5:185:13226:29:8:90:237:86:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:

6:187:13305:0:14:90:517:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:from the ease of expanded sales of both variable and fixed annuities and development of 
6:188:13393:14:14:90:226:695:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:their own security products.

6:190:13421:14:14:90:471:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The GLBA allowed banks to develop private equity businesses that could hold 
6:191:13497:14:13:90:514:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:investments for up to ten years, allowing banks to provide equity financing to small and 
6:192:13585:13:14:90:480:640:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:medium-sized firms. Additionally, the Act made it easier for banks of all sizes to 
6:193:13668:14:14:90:514:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:underwrite municipal securities and develop securities sales and origination services, as 
6:194:13758:14:14:90:511:612:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:well as insurance products. Likewise, insurance companies used the GLBA to cultivate 
6:195:13843:14:14:90:509:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:new revenue streams. Met Life became one of the largest financial holding companies. 
6:196:13928:14:13:90:490:584:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:C:Allstate Insurance’s interstate bank emerged as a truly national competitor in retail 
6:197:14014:13:14:90:449:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:banking services by using its agent network to cross-sell banking services.

6:199:14089:14:14:90:493:543:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f12:B:The ability to provide bank financing to investment banks’ corporate clients was an 
6:200:14173:14:14:90:495:529:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:attractive service for large corporations which increased competition for investment 
6:201:14258:14:13:90:506:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:banking services. However, not all investment banks actually became part of financial 
6:202:14344:13:14:90:511:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:holding companies with banking affiliates. This changed after the financial crisis arose. 
6:203:14434:14:14:90:489:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Following the failure of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, two investment banks 
6:204:14514:14:14:90:509:474:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:without significant attachments to bank affiliates, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley 
6:205:14599:14:14:90:504:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:became bank holding companies. Today there is no major investment bank that exists 
6:206:14682:14:13:90:477:446:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:outside of a financial holding company structure.  As the credit crisis continued, 
6:207:14765:13:14:90:500:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:commercial bank charters offered the attractive benefit of immediate access to liquid 
6:208:14851:14:14:90:496:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:funds through the Federal Reserve. The GLBA made possible the bank mergers that 
6:209:14930:14:14:90:506:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:quickly and efficiently resolved two of the largest institutional failures in the financial 
6:210:15022:14:14:90:282:391:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:crisis, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch.  
6:211:15062:14:13:90:93:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
6:212:15062:13:14:90:505:364:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:A key financial innovation brought about by the financial integration permitted by the 
6:213:15148:14:14:90:509:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:GLBA was reduced systematic risk.4 Stock prices rose for banks, insurance companies 
6:214:15231:14:14:90:504:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and security firms on the passage of the GLBA. Bank stocks, especially money center 
6:215:15314:14:14:90:510:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and super regional bank stocks, gained the most, followed by insurance companies and 
6:216:15399:14:13:90:503:308:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f12:B:then security firms. Meanwhile, overseas insurers’ stock prices dropped significantly. 
6:217:15486:13:14:90:483:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Evidence shows that part of the gain in rates of return on stocks was due to lower 
6:218:15569:14:28:90:354:281:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:systematic risk premiums associated with these firms.  
6:219:15623:28:14:90:516:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:As with most new legislation, the GLBA was not accepted warmly by all portions of the 
6:220:15708:14:13:90:517:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:industry. One of the primary concerns in the drafting and eventual passage of the GLBA 
6:221:15795:13:14:90:507:226:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:was the protection of customer privacy. Critics questioned whether the vast amount of 
6:222:15881:14:14:90:506:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:information held by one institution would compromise the privacy of account holders. 
6:223:15966:14:14:90:517:198:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Extensive restrictions on intra- and inter-company sharing of customer information were 
6:224:16053:14:28:90:315:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:included in the Act to address these concerns.  
6:225:16099:28:14:90:497:156:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Another criticism was that the GLBA was enacted to formalize a fait accompli – the 
6:226:16180:14:13:90:482:142:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:merger of Citibank and Travelers Group to create Citigroup, announced in 1998.  
6:227:16258:13:14:90:510:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:However, this was not true. The merger of Travelers Group and Citicorp was approved 
6:228:16342:14:18:90:505:115:12:g_d0_f12:12:Times New Roman:B:by the Fed on the basis that “non-permitted businesses would be divested within a pre-
6:229:16428:18:7:90:237:97:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:                                                 
6:230:16476:7:16:90:522:90:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:4 See Hassan, Mamun and Isik, Chapter 4 below, and Hassan and Mamun, Chapter 5 below, as well as their 
6:231:16578:16:0:90:209:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:references to other studies.     
7:232:16611:0:14:90:505:709:12:g_d0_f12:12:Times New Roman:B:defined time frame.” The passage of the GLBA eased the burden of an agreement that 
7:233:16694:14:14:90:515:695:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:had already been negotiated and eliminated the concerns about the cost or difficulties of 
7:234:16783:14:28:90:305:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:complying with the divesture requirements.  
7:235:16825:28:14:90:504:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:A third concern was that the GLBA would enable large mega-institutions to dominate 
7:236:16908:14:13:90:520:639:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:commercial banking, investment banking, brokerage and insurance business. By creating 
7:237:16994:13:14:90:501:626:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:C:“superstore” banks, some feared that smaller institutions including community banks 
7:238:17078:14:28:90:243:612:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:would not be able to compete.   
7:239:17108:28:28:90:93:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
7:240:17108:28:14:90:284:556:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Did The GLBA Achieve its Intentions? 
7:241:17144:14:13:90:506:542:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Interestingly, many of the outcomes of the GLBA did not play out as both authors and 
7:242:17229:13:14:90:518:529:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:critics thought they might.  The GLBA did not result in a rush of financial services firms 
7:243:17319:14:14:90:519:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:delving into new lines of business, except among the largest institutions. Beyond notable 
7:244:17409:14:14:90:505:501:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:mergers (e.g. Citigroup and Travelers, JP Morgan and Chase) the industries’ response 
7:245:17493:14:14:90:510:487:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:C:was primarily in the sale of nontraditional products, rather than the “manufacturing” of 
7:246:17582:14:13:90:503:473:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:new products.  As of June 29, 2009, there were only 592 financial holding companies 
7:247:17666:13:14:90:479:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:authorized by the Federal Reserve, and most of them were small and had limited 
7:248:17745:14:28:90:289:446:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:availability of nontraditional products.     
7:249:17786:28:14:90:519:418:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The GLBA seems to have been more effective at fostering product delivery than creating 
7:250:17873:14:13:90:517:404:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:new types of products. Around the same time that the GLBA was being introduced, new 
7:251:17957:13:14:90:518:391:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:technology was providing the financial services industry with sophisticated tools such as 
7:252:18047:14:14:90:503:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:marketing customer information files (MCIF) and data warehousing programs. These 
7:253:18128:14:14:90:517:363:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:tools made it easy for marketers to categorize customers by life-stage and create bundles 
7:254:18218:14:14:90:521:349:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of products tailored to life-stages or product usage. For example, a customer with an auto 
7:255:18309:14:13:90:486:335:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:loan would be a prime candidate to cross-sell an insurance policy to; a senior club 
7:256:18392:13:28:90:500:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:member might be interested in a money market or other high-yield deposit account.   
7:257:18474:28:14:90:516:294:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:To some extent, primarily through acquisition, holding companies were formed to allow 
7:258:18560:14:14:90:494:280:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:broader menus of products to be manufactured in house. However, over time, many 
7:259:18640:14:14:90:519:266:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:institutions have opted to source specific financial products from specialists, focusing on 
7:260:18732:14:14:90:378:252:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the distribution of products in response to consumer needs.  
7:261:18791:14:13:90:93:238:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
7:262:18791:13:14:90:511:225:12:g_d0_f12:12:Times New Roman:B:Skeptics’ concerns about privacy have also not borne out. The newly-formed Citigroup 
7:263:18876:14:14:90:496:211:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:led the way in crafting privacy restrictions that are included in the GLBA. The three 
7:264:18961:14:14:90:505:197:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:principal parts to the privacy requirements of the GLBA include the Financial Privacy 
7:265:19045:14:14:90:507:183:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Rule, Safeguards Rule and pretexting provisions. The language and restrictions within 
7:266:19131:14:13:90:489:169:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f12:B:each section of the Act’s privacy components seem to have served their purpose in 
7:267:19213:13:14:90:469:156:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:protecting customer information from wide dissemination across subsidiaries.  
7:268:19289:14:14:90:93:142:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
7:269:19289:14:14:90:273:128:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The GLBA and the Financial Crisis  
7:270:19321:14:14:90:506:114:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:As the financial crisis emerged, debate arose regarding any role that the Act may have 
7:271:19408:14:13:90:462:100:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:played in creating products that were not by definition innovative, but rather, 
7:272:19488:13:0:90:515:87:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:controversial, or other changes that may have contributed to the crisis. Some questioned 
8:273:19577:0:14:90:518:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:whether the innovation that the GLBA fostered had included financial products linked to 
8:274:19662:14:14:90:484:695:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the subprime crisis – specifically mortgage loans and the array of new investment 
8:275:19741:14:14:90:511:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:products created during the housing bubble. It must be noted that rapid growth in home 
8:276:19828:14:14:90:514:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:buying and thus the growth in mortgage assets was a result of public policy pressures to 
8:277:19916:14:13:90:490:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:increase homeownership in the U.S.  The resulting growth of mortgage companies, 
8:278:19996:13:14:90:512:640:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:especially some tied to real estate companies and to thrift institutions, led to substantial 
8:279:20089:14:14:90:511:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:changes in the processing of mortgage applications and to new channels of financing at 
8:280:20176:14:14:90:503:612:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f12:B:increasingly competitive prices. This trend was reinforced by banks’ movement away 
8:281:20259:14:14:90:506:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:from the “originate and hold” model to an “originate and distribute” model. Under the 
8:282:20343:14:13:90:507:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:new model, banks made and serviced mortgage loans, but sold the loans to investment 
8:283:20426:13:14:90:512:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:banks and government sponsored entities (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, who in 
8:284:20507:14:14:90:494:557:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:turn packaged the loans into pools against which they issued securitized mortgages. 
8:285:20591:14:14:90:500:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:These purchasers, especially some investment banks, went one or more steps further, 
8:286:20673:14:14:90:511:529:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:pooling these securities to create collateralized debt obligations and even more esoteric 
8:287:20761:14:13:90:522:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:versions of these instruments. The initial mortgage securitization instruments and process 
8:288:20851:13:14:90:524:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:were not new, however; they had existed for 15 to 20 years. What was new and especially 
8:289:20938:14:14:90:500:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:problematical was including risky subprime mortgages and especially adjustable rate 
8:290:21021:14:14:90:512:474:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:subprime mortgages, in these packages. Adjustable rate subprime loans grew rapidly in 
8:291:21105:14:14:90:517:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2004-2007 just as market interest rates were rising, so that earlier loans of this type were 
8:292:21198:14:13:90:333:446:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:resetting to, in many cases, unaffordable levels.     
8:293:21250:13:14:90:93:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
8:294:21250:14:14:90:502:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:These new products were the creation of investment banks that could have developed 
8:295:21332:14:14:90:498:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:them with or without the GLBA. And they were part of a pattern of new instruments 
8:296:21413:14:14:90:487:391:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:developed there that failed when a more normal appetite for credit risk returned to 
8:297:21497:14:13:90:483:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:markets in 2007 and subsequently. The illiquidity of instruments like auction rate 
8:298:21580:13:14:90:510:364:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:securities, structured finance products was stunning following the rapid growth of such 
8:299:21667:14:14:90:514:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:new products during the previous few years as investors abandoned caution in search of 
8:300:21754:14:14:90:517:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:yield on their investments in what was essentially a very low rate of return environment. 
8:301:21844:14:28:90:367:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Riskier and higher yielding new assets became the rage.   
8:302:21900:28:13:90:508:294:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Even though none of these new instruments could be linked to the GLBA, some critics 
8:303:21984:13:14:90:514:281:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:were quick to blame the law for the financial crisis.  Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman lays 
8:304:22072:14:14:90:524:267:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f12:B:blame on Senator Gramm, the lead author of the GLBA, and on the GLBA noting:  “Aha: 
8:305:22154:14:14:90:514:253:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f12:B:the Politico notices that Phil Gramm, McCain’s presidential economic guru, can also be 
8:306:22241:14:13:90:499:239:12:g_d0_f12:12:Times New Roman:B:viewed as the father of the financial crisis.”5  Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph 
8:307:22325:13:14:90:523:226:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Stiglitz called for the repeal of the GLBA in the January 2009 issue of Vanity Fair. While 
8:308:22416:14:14:90:520:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:political opposition to the GLBA exists, no political leader stepped forward to champion, 
8:309:22506:14:14:90:524:198:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:repeal or revision of the GLBA. President Barak Obama, while a presidential candidate in 
8:310:22595:14:14:90:500:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2008, expressed the view that the GLBA was responsible for the mortgage crisis, but 
8:311:22678:14:14:90:509:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:neither he nor congressional leaders followed up with the repeal of the GLBA.6  Henry 
8:312:22764:14:13:90:522:156:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Kaufman argues that the GLBA caused the crisis and advocates a return to a narrow bank 
8:313:22850:13:34:90:486:143:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regime in line with the Glass-Steagall regulatory structure.7 Paul Volcker has also 
8:314:22933:34:8:90:237:109:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:                                                 
8:315:22981:8:11:90:189:101:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:5 See Krugman (2009).   
8:316:23003:11:12:90:227:90:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:6 See Paletta and Scannell (2009). 
8:317:23036:12:0:90:186:78:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:7 See Kaufman (2010).  
9:318:23058:0:14:90:511:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:expressed regret over the passage of the GLBA and the failure of Dodd-Frank to repeal 
9:319:23143:14:28:90:106:695:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:it.8 
9:320:23147:28:14:90:481:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:One could argue that the partial adoption of the Volcker Rule, which would have 
9:321:23227:14:14:90:491:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:prohibited banks from conducting private equity, hedge fund or proprietary trading 
9:322:23310:14:13:90:492:639:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:businesses, in Dodd-Frank reflected a repeal of the most dangerous elements of the 
9:323:23393:13:14:90:510:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:GLBA. This would be wrong, however, for at least two reasons.  First, Volcker did not 
9:324:23479:14:14:90:504:612:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regard his original proposal as repealing the GLBA,9 and second, Dodd-Frank did not 
9:325:23562:14:14:90:524:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:implement the Volcker Rule. Instead it put limits on the extent of two of these businesses, 
9:326:23654:14:14:90:492:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:with private equity and hedge fund assets limited to no more than 3 percent of total 
9:327:23739:14:13:90:511:570:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:assets, required these activities to be conducted in separate subsidiaries, and eliminated 
9:328:23829:13:14:90:511:557:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:proprietary trading activities of banks. The latter is hard to define and is likely to prove 
9:329:23922:14:14:90:510:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:difficult to eliminate since similar activities are routinely conducted in other traditional 
9:330:24015:14:14:90:517:529:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:parts of the asset management of banks. Its effectiveness will be determined, as so much 
9:331:24104:14:28:90:379:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of Dodd-Frank, by regulators’ new processes to enforce it.   
9:332:24164:28:13:90:482:487:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Opposition to the GLBA appears to be more advanced in Britain, where the Tory 
9:333:24242:13:14:90:504:474:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:leadership is advocating adoption of a Glass-Steagall type separation of banking from 
9:334:24328:14:14:90:509:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:financial services. This is unique in that the British financial system has not had such a 
9:335:24419:14:14:90:497:446:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:separation structure in the past.  George Osborne, new Chancellor of the Exchequer, 
9:336:24500:14:14:90:483:432:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:advocated this approach when he was shadow Chancellor, as did the former Tory 
9:337:24577:14:13:90:522:418:12:g_d0_f12:12:Times New Roman:B:Chancellor, Nigel Lawson, who noted “Capitalism needs a revived Glass-Steagall Act.”10 
9:338:24663:13:14:90:496:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Nonetheless, when the Tories came to power in June 2010, adoption of a policy like 
9:339:24746:14:28:90:306:391:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Glass Steagall was not part of the program.   
9:340:24791:28:14:90:478:363:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The mortgage crisis arose because of the growth of subprime mortgage products 
9:341:24868:14:14:90:505:349:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:developed by mortgage bankers and investment banks, most of them unregulated, and 
9:342:24948:14:13:90:489:335:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:whose products were certainly not under the auspices of the GLBA provisions that 
9:343:25029:13:14:90:485:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:govern bank holding companies or of other commercial banking laws. Significant 
9:344:25107:14:14:90:470:308:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:pressure from Congress, supported by mandates and federal subsidies to foster 
9:345:25185:14:28:90:509:294:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:homeownership helped accelerate the growth and development of subprime products.   
9:346:25266:28:13:90:501:266:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:As a result of the growth in home ownership and specifically the growth of subprime 
9:347:25348:13:14:90:490:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:mortgage assets, incentives were created for investment banks to develop financial 
9:348:25431:14:14:90:507:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:products to leverage and manage their mortgage portfolios. These products were often 
9:349:25516:14:14:90:516:225:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:created by nontraditional companies and thus, marketed outside of traditional regulatory 
9:350:25605:14:14:90:501:211:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:structures. These new products included subprime-based mortgage backed securities, 
9:351:25688:14:14:90:519:197:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, auction rate securities and 
9:352:25782:14:13:90:519:183:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:credit default swaps. While some of these products were sound, many were complex and 
9:353:25867:13:38:90:329:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:unknown, creating a misunderstood risk profile.   
9:354:25915:38:8:90:237:132:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:                                                 
9:355:25963:8:16:90:489:124:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:8 See Uchitelle (2010). Volcker has argued elsewhere that financial deregulation introduced no new 
9:356:26061:16:11:90:506:108:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:innovations beyond the automatic teller machine, but in this article cites derivatives, securitizations and 
9:357:26169:11:7:90:372:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:credit default swaps as products that did not exist before deregulation. 
9:358:26241:7:12:90:185:90:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:9 See Uchitelle (2010).  
9:359:26264:12:0:90:186:78:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:10 See Lawson (2009).   
10:360:26287:0:14:90:515:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Indeed, during the crisis, the large failures of institutions occurred not among banks, but 
10:361:26379:14:14:90:523:695:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:among non-bank financial conglomerates such as Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill 
10:362:26465:14:14:90:500:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Lynch and American International Group (AIG). In short, the financial crisis was the 
10:363:26550:14:14:90:509:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:result of poor regulation of new intermediaries acting outside the traditional regulatory 
10:364:26640:14:13:90:492:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:structure that existed before and after the GLBA. The GLBA did not deregulate the 
10:365:26721:13:14:90:516:640:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:financial services industry beyond allowing for integration of institutions across product 
10:366:26812:14:14:90:492:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:lines. As Wallison points out in the next chapter, without the GLBA, the failures of 
10:367:26895:14:14:90:518:612:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:investment banks and large thrift institutions would not have been so easily resolved and 
10:368:26983:14:28:90:493:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the spillover to all financial institutions and the economy would have been severe.   
10:369:27067:28:13:90:518:570:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The notion that the financial crisis was a banking crisis has been fostered by the political 
10:370:27160:13:14:90:474:557:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:posturing of both the Bush and Obama administrations, led by the adoption and 
10:371:27238:14:14:90:507:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:implementation of TARP.  The TARP program began by forcing banks and a few non-
10:372:27317:14:14:90:509:529:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:bank financial institutions to accept government funds without evidence that they were 
10:373:27404:14:14:90:518:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:confronting any meaningful liquidity or solvency problems. Most of the banks paid back 
10:374:27490:14:13:90:523:501:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:these funds as soon as they were allowed. While TARP had authority to spend up to $700 
10:375:27577:13:14:90:484:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:billion, originally to acquire toxic assets of banks, less than $300 billion was ever 
10:376:27663:14:14:90:523:474:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:disbursed to banks, most of that was repaid with the next 18 months and in 2010 losses to 
10:377:27753:14:14:90:504:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:TARP were projected to arise from funds provided to automobile producers and AIG, 
10:378:27835:14:28:90:413:446:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:with little loss arising from funds advanced to commercial banks.   
10:379:27902:28:13:90:515:418:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Another perspective on whether there was a GLBA or financial-crisis-induced failure of 
10:380:27989:13:14:90:511:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:banks is that the failure experience of depository institutions (banks and thrifts) has not 
10:381:28081:14:14:90:521:391:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:risen to the level of the last real crisis, the savings and loan (S&L) crisis of the late 1980s 
10:382:28177:14:14:90:488:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and early 1990s.  In a new broad historical review of financial crises, Reinhart and 
10:383:28262:14:14:90:492:363:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Rogoff (2009) refer to the S&L crisis as a “bank-centered financial crisis” and they 
10:384:28346:14:13:90:513:349:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:include it in their comparison of the subprime crisis to such crises. It must be noted that 
10:385:28437:13:14:90:519:336:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f12:B:they use the term “milder,” and not their terms “severe” or “systemic,” in referring to the 
10:386:28529:14:14:90:495:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:S&L crisis and they conclude that the subprime crisis was worse than other banking 
10:387:28612:14:14:90:511:308:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:C:crises in advanced countries or in the five crises that they call the “Big Five,” “severe,” 
10:388:28704:14:14:90:497:294:12:g_d0_f12:12:Times New Roman:B:and “systemic,” crises. Certainly this suggests that the subprime crisis was the worst 
10:389:28791:14:13:90:520:280:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:since at least Great Depression, but one natural indicator that Reinhart and Rogoff do not 
10:390:28882:13:14:90:496:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:review, the number of bank failures, suggests otherwise.  In 2008-09 there were 135 
10:391:28966:14:14:90:501:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:failures (there were only three in 2007, the first year of the crisis), and it is likely that 
10:392:29058:14:14:90:516:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:there will be 170-200 failures in 2010. It is possible that, in 2010, the number of failures 
10:393:29148:14:14:90:519:225:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:will reach or surpass the previous high of 179 in 1992, which came toward the end of the 
10:394:29236:14:13:90:512:211:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:S&L crisis.  But a total of 300-350 failures for 2008-2010 pales in comparison with the 
10:395:29323:13:14:90:504:198:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:three to four times larger number of failures in the worst three years of the S&L crisis 
10:396:29411:14:14:90:520:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(1989-1991) , or the six times larger number of failures during the worst five years of the 
10:397:29501:14:14:90:521:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:earlier crisis, 1808 in 1987-92.  For the full 13-year period of elevated bank failures from 
10:398:29594:14:14:90:486:156:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:1981-93, there were 2,335 failures, about seven times as many as are likely in and 
10:399:29677:14:13:90:508:142:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:following the subprime/financial crisis. At least for this indicator of banking crisis, the 
10:400:29769:13:14:90:510:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:recent mortgage and financial crisis is hugely dwarfed by the so-called mild S&L bank-
10:401:29855:14:0:90:210:115:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:centered financial crisis. 
11:402:29883:0:14:90:495:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:A supporting view is offered by Bullard (2010), who argues that commercial banks, 
11:403:29965:14:14:90:506:695:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:especially the smaller community banks, did not cause the crisis and do not need to be 
11:404:30051:14:14:90:516:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reregulated. He points out that 20 financial firms made up 80 percent of the assets of the 
11:405:30141:14:14:90:524:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Standard and Poor’s 500 at the end of 2007. Only one third of the assets of these financial 
11:406:30230:14:13:90:519:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:firms were controlled by bank holding companies, regulated by the Fed, while two thirds 
11:407:30317:13:14:90:523:640:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:were non-bank financial firms, which are not in the bank regulatory system and not under 
11:408:30406:14:14:90:515:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the authority of the Fed. In his view, there were runs on the shadow banking system and 
11:409:30494:14:14:90:510:612:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:these and the non-bank financial firms caused the crisis. He does not recognize that the 
11:410:30583:14:14:90:502:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Fed did have regulatory control over the holding companies, though he is correct that 
11:411:30669:14:27:90:371:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:they did not have authority over non-bank financial firms. 
11:412:30727:27:14:90:482:557:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Dodd-Frank provides more authority for the Fed and FDIC to close bank holding 
11:413:30804:14:14:90:508:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:companies and other financial firms, but it is not likely that this will be the end of “too 
11:414:30895:14:14:90:479:529:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:big to fail” (TBTF) despite claims that it will. The experience in the recent crisis 
11:415:30978:14:14:90:516:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:extended the notion of TBTF to non-banks and even to non-financial firms, such as auto 
11:416:31065:14:13:90:508:501:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:companies. Improved discretionary ability to close banks and bank holding companies 
11:417:31149:13:14:90:500:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:was unnecessary and expanded discretionary control to close other financial and non-
11:418:31233:14:14:90:511:474:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:financial companies is not likely to be used in the event of another crisis. The only new 
11:419:31322:14:14:90:518:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:power is the ability to use a discretionary threat to private sector firms that is likely to be 
11:420:31418:14:13:90:491:446:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:abused in ways that are wholly unrelated to a real financial crisis.  Fortunately, this 
11:421:31506:13:29:90:442:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:congressional overreach is unlikely to survive future judicial challenge.   
11:422:31581:29:13:90:233:404:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The Profitability Perspective 
11:423:31610:13:14:90:493:391:12:g_d0_f12:12:Times New Roman:B:How did the GLBA impact U.S. banks’ overall profitability? Despite gains in stock 
11:424:31692:14:14:90:491:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:prices, there is no conclusive evidence that profitability or productivity rose for the 
11:425:31780:14:14:90:513:363:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:banking industry as a whole. From an asset growth perspective, however, total assets of 
11:426:31868:14:13:90:498:349:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:all banks grew at an 8.1 percent annual rate from 1999 to 2008, much faster than the 
11:427:31950:13:14:90:481:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:gross domestic product (GDP) (4.9%). Assets at the nation’s four largest holding 
11:428:32030:14:14:90:516:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:companies (Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo) grew more 
11:429:32112:14:14:90:518:308:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:than twice as fast, however, expanding at a rate of 16.6 percent, more than three times as 
11:430:32202:14:14:90:506:294:12:g_d0_f12:12:Times New Roman:B:fast as the economy’s GDP. The rest of the banking industry grew a little more slowly 
11:431:32287:14:13:90:426:280:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:than the overall economy, with assets expanding at a 4 percent rate.    
11:432:32357:13:14:90:93:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
11:433:32357:14:14:90:512:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Certainly, the GLBA appears to have helped create jobs in the financial services sector. 
11:434:32446:14:14:90:502:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Prior to the GLBA (1987-99), employment in the financial services sector grew more 
11:435:32528:14:14:90:499:225:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:slowly than overall employment, reflecting stagnation within the industry. However, 
11:436:32612:14:13:90:484:211:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:from 1999 to 2007, financial services employment outpaced overall employment, 
11:437:32690:13:14:90:389:198:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reflecting the improving performance of the financial sector.   
11:438:32753:14:14:90:93:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
11:439:32753:14:14:90:492:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:An increased level of competition within the banking sector is also indicated by the 
11:440:32837:14:14:90:518:156:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:decline in net interest margins. From 1984 to 1999, the average net interest margin of all 
11:441:32928:14:13:90:520:142:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:commercial banks was 4.17 percent. This number declined sharply (54 basis points) after 
11:442:33016:13:14:90:508:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the GLBA, averaging 3.63 percent from 1999 through the second quarter of 2009. The 
11:443:33098:14:14:90:500:115:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:transformation of banking is reflected in a sharp shift in the importance of traditional 
11:444:33187:14:14:90:515:101:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:financial intermediation (borrowing and lending) toward more fee income from services 
11:445:33273:14:0:90:497:87:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:such as insurance and security sales, origination fees and service fees for overdrafts, 
12:446:33363:0:14:90:525:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:loans of credit and other services. From 1969 to 1986, the share of interest income in total 
12:447:33456:14:14:90:517:695:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:commercial bank income was about 90 percent. As the GLBA removed walls separating 
12:448:33537:14:14:90:505:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:banks, insurance and securities firms, the share of interest income fell to 72 percent in 
12:449:33627:14:14:90:488:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:1999 and to 64 percent in 2003. Since then, the share rose to 73 percent in 2008 as 
12:450:33710:14:13:90:328:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:traditional banking has reasserted its importance. 
12:451:33760:13:14:90:93:640:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
12:452:33760:14:14:90:444:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Senator Gramm laid out a market test of the future success of the GLBA: 
12:453:33830:14:14:126:507:612:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The test that I believe we should use – the test I will use, the test I hope people 
12:454:33912:14:14:126:489:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:looking at this bill years in the future will use – is, 'Did it produce a greater 
12:455:33992:14:13:126:518:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:diversity of products and services for American consumers? Were those products 
12:456:34071:13:14:126:499:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:better? And did they sell at a lower price?' I think if the answer to those three 
12:457:34153:14:12:126:384:557:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:questions is yes, then this bill will have succeeded.11  
12:458:34208:12:13:126:129:545:10:Helvetica:10:Helvetica:F: 
12:459:34208:13:14:90:499:532:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:According to the evidence above, the GLBA was a success, especially for the largest 
12:460:34291:14:14:90:515:518:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f12:B:banks. On the other hand, Gramm’s ultimate test of its success is its survival, though his 
12:461:34381:14:14:90:482:504:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:explanation has come under a cloud of doubt, at least temporarily, because of the 
12:462:34463:14:14:90:316:490:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:mortgage and financial crisis. Gramm argued,  
12:463:34508:14:13:90:93:476:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
12:464:34508:13:14:126:522:463:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Ultimately, the final judge of the bill is history. Ultimately, as you look at the bill, 
12:465:34597:14:14:126:523:449:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:you have to ask yourself, 'Will people in the future be trying to repeal it, as we are 
12:466:34684:14:14:126:524:435:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:here today trying to repeal – and hopefully repealing – Glass-Steagall?’ I think the 
12:467:34764:14:14:126:495:421:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:answer will be no. I think it will be no because we are doing something very 
12:468:34841:14:13:126:466:407:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:different from Glass-Steagall. Glass-Steagall, in the midst of the Great 
12:469:34914:13:14:126:495:394:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Depression, thought government was the answer. In this period of economic 
12:470:34988:14:14:126:412:380:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:growth and prosperity, we believe freedom is the answer.12 
12:471:35046:14:14:90:93:366:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
12:472:35046:14:14:90:513:352:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The GLBA survived the assault of leading intellectual and political critics in the United 
12:473:35136:14:13:90:451:338:12:Times New Roman:10:Helvetica:B:States and the United Kingdom, at least in their post-crisis reform efforts.   
12:474:35213:13:15:90:93:325:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
12:475:35213:15:13:90:236:310:12:g_d0_f16:12:Times New Roman:B:What about “Wallet Share”? 
12:476:35239:13:14:90:508:297:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:An early concern upon passage of the GLBA was that financial behemoths would take 
12:477:35321:14:14:90:496:283:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:over the financial services industry. By 2009, only about 600 mostly small local and 
12:478:35406:14:13:90:514:269:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regional financial holding companies exist to facilitate cross-sector product availability. 
12:479:35497:13:14:90:491:256:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:There is some question whether even this small number really provides full service 
12:480:35580:14:14:90:514:242:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:product availability. The expansion of new products and services allowed by the GLBA 
12:481:35665:14:14:90:506:228:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:has not resulted in increased products per household within institutions. Banks did not 
12:482:35753:14:14:90:522:214:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:lure large numbers of customers away from insurance firms, nor did insurance companies 
12:483:35839:14:13:90:490:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:lure significant numbers of customers away from traditional banks. As a result, the 
12:484:35923:13:14:90:474:187:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:GLBA has not resulted in a meaningful diversification of product shares within 
12:485:36001:14:14:90:176:173:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:individual firms.

12:487:36019:14:14:90:522:145:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The GLBA may have helped foster customer retention. While customers appear to have a 
12:488:36103:14:13:90:503:131:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:preference for doing business with specialists across the product spectrum, customers

13:496:36506:14:14:90:204:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Examining the Legacy 
13:497:36526:14:13:90:517:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Like most regulation, the GLBA has been both condoned and vilified, particularly in the 
13:498:36614:13:14:90:477:640:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:context of the economic meltdown. However, the GLBA appears to have been a 
13:499:36689:14:14:90:507:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:significant factor in supporting the vigor and health of U.S. banks by enabling them to 
13:500:36777:14:14:90:471:612:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:deliver products and services that enhance competition and deliver the services 
13:501:36857:14:14:90:468:598:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:C:consumers demand. Notably, the solvency of the nation’s banks has improved 
13:502:36932:14:13:90:516:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:dramatically in the past decade. Banks reached an historical peak in their ratio of capital 
13:503:37024:13:14:90:487:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to assets, or lowest leverage ratio, in mid 2008 – about the same time the financial 
13:504:37107:14:14:90:492:557:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:meltdown was capturing national headlines.  Over the past 10 years, the GLBA has 
13:505:37186:14:14:90:513:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:played a role in the growth of the U.S. banking industry, making it more internationally 
13:506:37275:14:14:90:512:529:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:competitive and more resilient to economic and financial shocks. Despite its critics, the 
13:507:37365:14:13:90:484:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:GLBA has increased innovation as well as enhanced the convenience of financial 
13:508:37444:13:14:90:512:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:services for both consumers and businesses. The GLBA broke down restrictive barriers 
13:509:37527:14:14:90:509:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:brought about during the Great Depression. Despite the criticisms of the GLBA during 
13:510:37611:14:14:90:492:474:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the financial crisis and early stages of the legislative debate for financial regulatory 
13:511:37700:14:14:90:323:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reform, no effort to repeal the GLBA surfaced.   
13:512:37748:14:13:90:93:446:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
13:513:37748:13:14:90:518:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:In the development of the GLBA, primary concerns focused on consumer protection and 
13:514:37832:14:14:90:505:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:privacy issues. Today, systemic risk, subprime credit and mortgage credit crisis issues 
13:515:37919:14:14:90:492:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:introduce new concerns. Dodd-Frank created a new Consumer Financial Protection 
13:516:37998:14:14:90:505:391:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Bureau, housed within the Federal Reserve, but independent of them. The new bureau 
13:517:38081:14:13:90:511:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:will have power to write regulation, examine and enforce it for banks, thrifts and credit 
13:518:38171:13:14:90:500:364:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:unions with assets over $10 billion, mortgage-related businesses, payday lenders and 
13:519:38256:14:14:90:516:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:certain non-bank financial firms, though auto dealers are explicitly exempt. Dodd-Frank 
13:520:38344:14:14:90:499:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:did not retire or consolidate any of the existing financial regulatory bodies, however, 
13:521:38432:14:14:90:496:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:except for merging the federal chartering and regulation of thrifts with that of banks 
13:522:38519:14:13:90:508:308:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:within the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in the U.S. Department of 
13:523:38604:13:14:90:519:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Treasury. This transfers consumer protection rules for thrifts to oversight by the OCC, as 
13:524:38695:14:14:90:505:281:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:well as the new bureau. Thus, Dodd-Frank continues the pursuit of stronger consumer 
13:525:38779:14:14:90:522:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:protection regulation and in this regard it touches on one area that some analysts believed 
13:526:38871:14:14:90:485:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:contributed to the mortgage and financial crisis of 2007-09, the concern to protect 
13:527:38955:14:13:90:476:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:consumers from predatory lending.  There is no evidence that predatory lending 
13:528:39034:13:14:90:506:226:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:contributed to the mortgage crisis, however, as predation with unsustainable mortgage 
13:529:39119:14:14:90:481:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:lending ran from borrowers to lenders and to mortgage-backed asset investors.     
13:530:39200:14:14:90:93:198:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
13:531:39200:14:14:90:490:184:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:C:As new regulatory structures are considered, these “new” questions will need to be 
13:532:39283:14:13:90:499:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:addressed. The subprime crisis was largely due to credit extensions among mortgage 
13:533:39366:13:14:90:512:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:bankers and thrift institutions. Additionally, the creation of complex new products such 
13:534:39455:14:14:90:506:143:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:as mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, collateralized debt 
13:535:39543:14:14:90:522:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:obligations, auction rate securities and credit default swaps were developed and marketed 
13:536:39633:14:14:90:510:115:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:outside traditional regulatory structures. These gaps will certainly be considered in any 
13:537:39723:14:13:90:285:101:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:new system of regulation and oversight. 
13:538:39762:13:0:90:93:88:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
14:539:39764:0:14:90:509:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:On the other hand, some analysts have noted that, without the GLBA, the ability of the 
14:540:39849:14:14:90:514:695:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:financial system to insulate investors from larger losses and instability would have been 
14:541:39938:14:14:90:490:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:more restricted [see Wallison (2009), for example]. Some banks that had extensive 
14:542:40017:14:14:90:518:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:investment banking operations have experienced relatively large losses (Citigroup, Bank 
14:543:40105:14:13:90:482:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of America); but, it was the largely non-bank affiliated Bear Stearns and Lehman 
14:544:40185:13:14:90:415:640:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Brothers whose failure is most closely linked to the financial crisis. 
14:545:40255:14:14:90:93:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
14:546:40255:14:14:90:498:612:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Looking forward, new regulation may or may not affect the GLBA. As noted above, 
14:547:40334:14:14:90:521:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Dodd-Frank did not alter the financial structure or other aspects of the GLBA very much. 
14:548:40422:14:13:90:479:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Dodd-Frank left the product offerings of financial institutions largely intact. The 
14:549:40505:13:14:90:522:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:exceptions are that banks will no longer be able to undertake proprietary trading and their 
14:550:40597:14:14:90:498:557:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:offerings of hedge fund services and private equity services will each be limited to 3 
14:551:40684:14:14:90:521:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:percent of total assets. Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Fed and adviser to President 
14:552:40774:14:14:90:491:529:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Obama, had recommended that all three of these activities be prohibited in the new 
14:553:40857:14:13:90:519:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:legislation.  Instead, only proprietary trading was prohibited and the other activities were 
14:554:40950:13:14:90:513:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:limited.  Of these three activities, only private equity had been expanded for U.S. banks 
14:555:41040:14:14:90:161:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in the GLBA.  
14:556:41053:14:14:90:93:474:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
14:557:41053:14:14:90:506:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:In 2008, Secretary of Treasury Henry Paulson’s Blueprint [(see U.S. Treasury (2008)] 
14:558:41134:14:13:90:504:446:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:called for a move to regulation by risk type rather than function, referred to as a move 
14:559:41223:13:14:90:497:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:from functional regulation to objectives-based regulation. Essentially, the regulatory 
14:560:41309:14:14:90:521:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:structure had remained unchanged by the GLBA, regulating various financial firms along 
14:561:41395:14:14:90:510:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:product lines, despite the possibility of merging products lines under the GLBA. These 
14:562:41482:14:14:90:523:391:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f12:B:regulatory “silos,” regulating according to types of products rather than types of risk were 
14:563:41575:14:13:90:516:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:a target of the Paulson Blueprint. This proposal did not survive into the Obama proposal 
14:564:41662:13:14:90:512:364:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of 2009 [see U.S. Treasury (2009)], though there was otherwise broad agreement in the 
14:565:41748:14:14:90:491:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:two regulatory reform proposals and indeed, Dodd-Frank incorporated many of the 
14:566:41828:14:14:90:520:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:proposals in both documents. For example, Dodd-Frank consolidated the Office of Thrift 
14:567:41913:14:14:90:515:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Supervision in the Office of the Comptroller of Currency and ended the thrift charter, as 
14:568:42002:14:13:90:491:308:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:both sets of proposals had agreed earlier. It also set up a Federal Office of National 
14:569:42089:13:14:90:507:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Insurance to serve as a national center for insurance information and federal policy, as 
14:570:42178:14:14:90:504:281:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:well as a coordinator for federal insurance policy in international policy coordination. 
14:571:42267:14:14:90:519:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Perhaps most importantly, it established a separate and independent consumer protection 
14:572:42355:14:14:90:489:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regulator, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as both earlier proposals had 
14:573:42438:14:13:90:487:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:recommended and, most notably, the most significant aspect of the Paulson plan’s 
14:574:42519:13:14:90:431:226:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:objectives-based regulation that carried through to the new legislation. 
14:575:42591:14:14:90:93:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
14:576:42591:14:14:90:524:198:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Another component of the objectives-based regulatory structure proposed in the Blueprint 
14:577:42678:14:14:90:500:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:called for a regulator of financial stability. Dodd-Frank includes a Financial Stability 
14:578:42767:14:13:90:500:170:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Oversight Council composed of all the various existing regulators and chaired by the 
14:579:42851:13:14:90:505:157:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f12:B:Secretary of Treasury. It does not abolish the Fed’s role in monitoring and controlling 
14:580:42938:14:14:90:506:143:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:financial stability, however, as envisioned by the Blueprint. Creation of the Consumer 
14:581:43025:14:14:90:510:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Financial Protection Bureau and the Financial Stability Oversight Council may be only 
14:582:43110:14:14:90:520:115:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the first steps in moving toward the new structure envisioned in the Blueprint.  However, 
14:583:43200:14:13:90:503:101:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the Blueprint’s notion of having a single regulator for prudential regulation suffered a 
14:584:43288:13:0:90:518:88:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:major setback in its omission from the Obama proposals, its omission from Dodd-Frank, 
15:585:43375:0:14:90:514:709:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f12:B:and from the abolition of the Financial Services Authority, the world’s leading example 
15:586:43463:14:14:90:519:695:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of an objectives-based regulator, in favor of moving prudential regulation back under the 
15:587:43553:14:14:90:481:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Bank of England, the central bank and principal institution for financial stability. 
15:588:43637:14:14:90:96:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:  
15:589:43637:14:13:90:520:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Despite the criticism that the GLBA contributed to the financial crisis, the only two large 
15:590:43729:13:14:90:514:640:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:investment banks that were not previously part of financial holding companies (Morgan 
15:591:43815:14:14:90:506:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Stanley and Goldman Sachs) became financial holding companies in order to improve 
15:592:43895:14:14:90:499:612:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:their strength during the crisis. Smaller investment banks that do not also function as 
15:593:43983:14:14:90:499:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:banks may remain so over the next decade if they survive as independent investment 
15:594:44066:14:13:90:509:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:banks. Several large financial holding companies have emerged over the past ten years 
15:595:44151:13:14:90:500:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:including JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo. There are 
15:596:44231:14:14:90:509:557:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:about seven large foreign universal banks that rely primarily on deposit taking but also 
15:597:44320:14:14:90:521:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:have securities. It is likely that efforts to expand product offerings, which have continued 
15:598:44413:14:14:90:496:529:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:over more than three decades, will continue, even among the large financial holding 
15:599:44497:14:13:90:493:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:companies. Moreover, some midsize and small banks will continue to offer a broad 
15:600:44578:13:14:90:506:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:portfolio of financial products and services. Whether financial holding companies will 
15:601:44665:14:14:90:505:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:remain so in the future will depend in part on how new regulations under Dodd-Frank 
15:602:44749:14:14:90:490:474:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:C:play out.  Since all financial institutions are now subject to the Fed’s new financial 
15:603:44836:14:14:90:491:460:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f12:B:oversight and the new law gives significance to the Fed’s notion of financial firms, 
15:604:44921:14:13:90:503:446:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:C:broadly conceived, being “too interdependent to fail,” there will be little advantage to 
15:605:45010:13:14:90:514:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:being a bank, a bank holding or a financial holding company and only more regular and 
15:606:45096:14:14:90:468:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:pervasive costs associated with the tighter oversight of bank and bank holding 
15:607:45174:14:14:90:504:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:companies. While the Fed could intervene, it is likely that as time makes the financial 
15:608:45262:14:14:90:519:391:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:crisis and passage of Dodd-Frank more distant, some large financial firms that specialize 
15:609:45352:14:13:90:492:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in non-bank activity may give up their status as a financial holding company with a 
15:610:45436:13:14:90:225:364:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:commercial bank affiliate.
