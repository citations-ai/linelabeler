2:30:1536:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:Using data from a field experiment in Kenya, we document that providing individuals with simple
2:31:1631:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:informal savings technologies can substantially increase investment in preventative health and reduce
2:32:1732:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:vulnerability to health shocks. Simply providing a safe place to keep money was sufficient to increase
2:33:1834:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:health savings, through a mental accounting effect. Adding an earmarking feature was only helpful
2:34:1931:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:when funds were put towards emergencies; earmarking for preventative health reduced savings on
2:35:2025:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:average, because the liquidity cost of tying up money was too great. Providing social pressure and
2:36:2123:14:42:72:410:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:credit through a ROSCA-based savings scheme had very large effects.

3:50:2439:0:30:72:208:708:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:1  Introduction
3:51:2454:30:18:72:540:678:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In developing countries, the returns to many types of investments in human or physical
3:52:2540:18:18:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:capital appear to be high, yet investment levels remain quite low. For example, it has been
3:53:2631:18:18:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimated that 63 percent of under-five mortality could be averted if households invested in
3:54:2723:18:18:72:540:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:readily available preventative health products (Jones et al. 2003). Why don’t people make
3:55:2812:18:18:72:540:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:these investments? While credit constraints are the most obvious culprit, and while recent
3:56:2902:18:18:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:evidence does suggest that relieving credit constraints can increase investments in bednets
3:57:2993:18:18:72:540:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(Tarozzi et al. 2011) or clean water connections (Devoto et al. 2011), the upfront costs of
3:58:3084:18:18:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:many preventative products (such as bednets) are not massive. Households should be just
3:59:3171:18:18:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as able to gradually save up for such investments as to take out loans and gradually pay
3:60:3259:18:17:72:129:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:them back.
3:61:3269:17:18:89:539:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To understand why the poor are constrained in their ability to save, we designed a field
3:62:3357:18:18:72:540:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:experiment in rural Kenya in which we randomly varied access to four innovative saving de-
3:63:3447:18:18:72:540:463:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:vices which differed in the degree of commitment they offered. One saving technology offered
3:64:3539:18:18:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:only a very soft form of commitment through mental accounting. Two other products offered
3:65:3628:18:18:72:540:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stronger commitment through earmarking. A final product, in addition to earmarking, of-
3:66:3715:18:18:72:540:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fered credit as well as a social commitment to make regular contributions. By observing the
3:67:3806:18:18:72:540:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:impact of these various technologies on asset accumulation, and by estimating which types
3:68:3895:18:18:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of people benefit most from them, we can identify the key barriers to saving in our study
3:69:3984:18:18:72:113:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:context.
3:70:3992:18:18:89:539:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Though the saving technologies we study could be relevant for any number of purposes,
3:71:4077:18:18:72:540:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we designed them around enabling savings for health investments. The reason for this is
3:72:4164:18:18:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that poor health is very common in Kenya (as in much of Sub-Saharan Africa), so that there
3:73:4254:18:18:72:419:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are likely substantial welfare effects of increasing savings for health.
3:74:4326:18:17:89:539:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our main outcomes are (1) take-up of the savings technologies; (2) investment in preven-
3:75:4414:17:18:72:540:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tative health products; and (3) whether households are able to deal with health emergencies
3:76:4505:18:18:72:540:230:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:when they arise. We compare the four treatment groups to a control group which received
3:77:4592:18:18:72:540:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the same encouragement to save for health but was not offered a savings technology. Our
3:78:4679:18:18:72:540:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:primary data are follow-up surveys conducted after 6 and 12 months with 771 individuals.
3:79:4767:18:18:72:540:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We supplement this with a longer-run follow-up conducted about three years later with a
3:80:4854:18:18:72:171:158:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:random subsample.
3:81:4871:18:18:89:539:140:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our first main result is that the take-up of all four saving technologies was very high.
3:82:4959:18:18:72:540:122:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:After 12 months, the take-up rate for the least popular technology was 66%, while it was
3:83:5047:18:18:72:540:104:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:97% for the most popular. These take-up figures suggest that the primary appeal of the
3:84:5133:18:0:72:540:86:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:devices is in their common feature: providing a safe and designated place to save money for
4:85:5225:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a specific goal. The main mechanism through which the products increased health savings
4:86:5312:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:appears to be mental accounting. In follow-up surveys, respondents reported that once the
4:87:5401:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:money was set aside, they had the strength to resist “unplanned expenditures,” including
4:88:5489:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:transfers to friends and relatives and luxury spending. This mental accounting channel is
4:89:5578:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:why people were able to save even in the product in which the money was readily accessible.
4:90:5669:18:18:89:539:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Turning to impacts on health investment, our second main result is that earmarking
4:91:5751:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for preventative health investments was ineffective for the average individual. By contrast,
4:92:5843:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:earmarking for health emergencies increased people’s ability to cope with shocks. The reason
4:93:5935:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that earmarking for preventative health was not an attractive feature is that earmarking
4:94:6023:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:brings with it the substantial liquidity cost of not being able to access money when it is
4:95:6113:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:needed for other purposes (in particular health emergencies). By contrast, earmarking for
4:96:6202:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:health emergencies allows precisely the types of emergency withdrawals that people are most
4:97:6293:18:18:72:295:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:concerned about, and so was highly valued.
4:98:6335:18:17:89:539:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our third main result is that providing credit and social pressure to make deposits for
4:99:6422:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:health in a group setting (in this case, a Rotating Savings and Credit Association, or ROSCA)
4:100:6515:18:18:72:377:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is a highly effective means of increasing health investments.
4:101:6576:18:18:89:539:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We provide further but somewhat more speculative evidence on the savings barriers that
4:102:6662:18:18:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:these devices helped overcome by examining how impacts varied with background charac-
4:103:6747:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:teristics. First, we find that individuals who, at baseline, were the most “taxed” by their
4:104:6838:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:social networks (people who were giving assistance to others but who received no assistance
4:105:6929:18:18:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in return) are the only subgroup which continued to save when deposits were earmarked for
4:106:7018:18:18:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:preventative health. We conjecture that the demands on their income are strong enough
4:107:7103:18:18:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that limiting liquidity is not as costly for them. While we cannot entirely rule out that the
4:108:7196:18:18:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:differential effects we see for these “providers” are potentially driven by some unobservable
4:109:7289:18:18:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:characteristics correlated with provider status, it is worth noting that our findings are con-
4:110:7383:18:18:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sistent with a number of recent studies in Sub-Saharan Africa, which suggest that people
4:111:7471:18:17:72:355:241:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:might be willing to pay to avoid demands from others.1
4:112:7525:17:18:89:539:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Second, our results suggest that time-inconsistency might be another important con-
4:113:7608:18:35:71:539:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:straint. As might be expected, those with time-inconsistent preferences (who make up about
4:114:7698:35:16:88:540:171:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:1Baland et al. (2007) present evidence from Cameroon consistent with a model in which middle-class
4:115:7796:16:12:71:539:155:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:individuals take on (costly) loans they do not need as a way to signal poverty and avoid requests for financial
4:116:7907:12:12:71:539:143:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:help from friends and relatives. Similarly, a recent experimental study in Western Kenya finds that women
4:117:8012:12:12:71:539:131:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:are willing to pay a substantial cost (in the form of either a fee or foregone returns) in order to hide income

4:119:8231:12:12:71:539:107:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:exist strong social norms in West Africa which necessitate that an individual provides support to friends and
4:120:8340:12:12:71:539:95:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:relatives if she is asked for money and has cash on hand. However, our results do contrast somewhat with a
4:121:8446:12:12:71:539:83:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:recent field experiment in Ghana, which finds no evidence that external pressure to share is responsible for
4:122:8554:12:0:71:528:71:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:the inability of many small entrepreneurs to invest cash grants in their business (Fafchamps et al. 2011).
5:123:8661:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:16% of our sample) did not benefit from gaining access to a simple savings device in which
5:124:8751:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:withdrawals were not restricted. They also did not benefit from earmarking, but did save in
5:125:8842:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the product which offered credit and social commitment to make deposits. We conjecture
5:126:8928:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that this combination worked because the credit aspect induced people to begin saving, and
5:127:9018:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the social pressure aspect compelled them to make regular deposits. These results suggest
5:128:9107:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that people with such preferences may need products which not only earmark savings for a
5:129:9195:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:specific purpose but which also commit them to make regular deposits. That some form of
5:130:9282:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:commitment is needed for people with time-inconsistent preferences resonates well with evi-
5:131:9373:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dence from multiple settings – from retirement savings in the US (Thaler and Benartzi 2004;
5:132:9464:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Choi et al. 2011) to bank savings in the Philippines (Ashraf et al. 2006a) to agricultural
5:133:9554:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investments in Kenya (Duflo et al. 2010) and Malawi (Brune et al. 2011). Our contribution
5:134:9643:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is to show that, in the absence of a direct deposit or deposit collection feature, earmarking
5:135:9736:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:alone is not sufficient to meaningfully increase savings among time-inconsistent individuals.
5:136:9829:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This is consistent with Ashraf et al. (2006a), who find that many time-inconsistent individ-
5:137:9921:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:uals in the Philippines are “sophisticated” enough to sign up for a commitment device, but
5:138:10011:18:18:72:270:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not enough to use it once they have it.
5:139:10050:18:18:89:539:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Third, we also find some tentative evidence of intra-household barriers to individual
5:140:10135:18:18:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:saving. We find somewhat larger effects for married women than for unmarried women. Here
5:141:10223:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:again, we cannot entirely rule out that this is driven by some other characteristic correlated
5:142:10317:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with marital status, but we note that the heterogeneity we observe is consistent with evidence
5:143:10411:18:18:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of savings misallocation due to intra-household heterogeneity in time preferences found in
5:144:10501:18:18:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Kenya by Schaner (2011). It is also related to experimental evidence from the Philippines
5:145:10590:18:18:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:presented in Ashraf (2009), which showed that hiding money from one’s spouse is desirable
5:146:10679:18:18:72:367:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:under certain intra-household decision-making structures.
5:147:10736:18:18:89:539:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:All in all, our results suggest that devices which simply help individuals harness the
5:148:10822:18:18:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:power of mental accounting are beneficial to the majority of people in our sample. Since
5:149:10910:18:17:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:much of the value of a savings product appears to be in the mental accounting it provides,
5:150:11000:17:18:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a product which does not severely limit liquidity is preferred to one that does, especially for
5:151:11095:18:18:72:536:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:people living in an environment in which income shocks are common, such as rural Kenya.
5:152:11182:18:18:89:539:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our results contribute to a fast-growing literature on savings in developing countries. It
5:153:11272:18:18:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:has by now been well established empirically that the reason for low observed savings rates
5:154:11363:18:29:72:540:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is not just that the poor are simply “too poor to save.”2Several studies have investigated
5:155:11453:29:16:88:540:123:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:2For example, Shipton (1990) describes how people in the Gambia make their own wooden lockboxes,
5:156:11549:16:12:71:539:107:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:which they smash open once they have reached their savings goal. Collins et al. (2009) examine a wealth of
5:157:11655:12:12:71:539:95:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:other informal saving tools used by poor families in Bangladesh, India, and South Africa. Rutherford (2000)
5:158:11762:12:11:71:539:83:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:documents how poor households often report wanting to save more. Banerjee and Duflo (2007), looking at
5:159:11864:11:0:71:539:72:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:detailed household survey data form 13 countries, find that even extremely poor households do not use all
6:160:11970:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reasons for such undersaving, but as with developed countries, much of the existing litera-
6:161:12061:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ture puts the emphasis on self-control problems. Bernheim, Ray and Yeltekin (1999, 2011)
6:162:12149:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:propose a model in which self-control problems can lead to a low-asset trap. In their model,
6:163:12241:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:self-discipline through personal rules is harder when one is poor and credit constrained than
6:164:12334:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:when one is rich and has access to credit, because the cost of deviating from personal rules is
6:165:12429:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:limited when one has very little to lose. Banerjee and Mullainathan (2010) argue that there
6:166:12520:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are “temptation goods” (goods whose consumption yields utility in the present, but whose
6:167:12608:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:future consumption yields no utility), so that the consumption of these goods by future
6:168:12695:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:selves serves as a “temptation tax” on savings. If there is satiation in temptation goods such
6:169:12789:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that their consumption share declines with income, then a poverty trap can emerge since
6:170:12876:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:poor people face a higher effective tax and therefore have a lower incentive to save than
6:171:12965:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:richer people. Both theories are consistent with studies which find demand for some form of
6:172:13056:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:commitment among people in developing countries (Ashraf et al. 2006a; Duflo et al. 2010;
6:173:13144:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Brune et al. 2011). A more recent strand of literature puts emphasis on limited attention.
6:174:13234:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Karlan et al.  (2011) provide experimental evidence from a multiplicity of countries that
6:175:13323:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:simple reminders to save can increase saving rates by about as much as access to commit-
6:176:13411:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ment savings products. Likewise, Kast et al. (2011) shows that interventions to encourage
6:177:13500:18:18:72:506:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:deposits (through peer groups or text message reminders) can increase savings rates.
6:178:13584:18:18:89:539:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our evidence is consistent with the presence of both self-control and inattention problems,
6:179:13675:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:but suggests that, for most people, these barriers can be alleviated without resorting to
6:180:13764:18:18:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:services such as formal commitment savings accounts or reminders. In our study, a simple
6:181:13852:18:18:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:safe place to save is enough to increase preventative health investment by at least 68 percent,
6:182:13947:18:18:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and increase the likelihood that people reach their savings goal by 13 percentage points within
6:183:14042:18:18:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a year. This is substantially larger than the 6 percent increase in savings and 3 percentage
6:184:14134:18:18:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:points increase in goal-reaching observed by Karlan et al. (2011) through monthly reminders
6:185:14225:18:18:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:over a 6 or 12 month period. It also compares favorably with the impacts of the commitment
6:186:14315:18:17:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:product studied by Ashraf et al. (2006a) in the Philippines. They find an 81% increase
6:187:14401:17:18:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in bank savings after 12 months, but the effect fades to (a statistically insignificant) 33%
6:188:14493:18:18:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increase after 2.5 years (Ashraf et al. 2006b). Also, in that study, only 10% of those offered
6:189:14587:18:18:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the commitment product actively used it. In contrast, the take-up rate of our most basic
6:190:14675:18:18:72:518:170:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:product was 71 percent in the first year, and still close to 40 percent after three years.3
6:191:14766:18:18:89:539:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the experimental
6:192:14850:18:27:71:539:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:technologies we introduced and the underlying theoretical framework. Section 3 describes
6:193:14938:27:12:72:540:107:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:of their income to afford basic necessities. Dupas and Robinson (2009) find that simple bank accounts can
6:194:15043:12:8:72:387:95:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:increase savings and investments among market vendors in rural Kenya.
6:195:15112:8:15:88:540:87:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:3Note that this long-term figure was measured two years after the last contact with the research team,
6:196:15214:15:0:72:337:72:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:that is, two years after the last potential “reminder” to save.
7:197:15278:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the sample, the timeline of the experiment and the data. We discuss the results in terms
7:198:15366:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of medium-run take-up (Section 4) and impacts (Section 5) before we describe longer-run
7:199:15453:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:evidence in Section 6. We then bring on evidence from exit surveys to discuss mechanisms
7:200:15541:18:45:72:239:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in Section 7, before we conclude.

7:203:15633:25:18:72:540:549:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:As we will describe below, two of our four savings technologies involved a social component.
7:204:15725:18:18:72:540:531:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:For this reason, we had to work with existing social structures in order to implement the
7:205:15814:18:18:72:540:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:study. We chose to work with one of the most common social structures throughout the
7:206:15898:18:18:72:540:495:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:developing world: local saving circles called ROSCAs (Rotating Savings and Credit Associ-
7:207:15987:18:18:72:540:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ations). A ROSCA is a group of individuals who come together and make regular cyclical
7:208:16073:18:18:72:540:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:contributions to a fund (called the “pot”), which is then given as a lump sum to one member
7:209:16164:18:18:72:540:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in each cycle. While people who participate in ROSCAs are clearly a self-selected group,
7:210:16252:18:18:72:540:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:they are still representative of a relatively large share of the population, since over 40% of
7:211:16346:18:18:72:325:405:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:adults in our study area participate in ROSCAs.4
7:212:16394:18:17:89:539:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We worked with 113 ROSCAs in one district of Kenya, and randomly assigned these
7:213:16473:17:18:72:540:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ROSCAs to one of five study arms (one control and four different experimental treatment
7:214:16560:18:18:72:540:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:arms). Individuals in all study arms were encouraged to save for health and were asked to
7:215:16649:18:18:72:540:334:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:set a health goal for themselves at the beginning of the study, but only individuals in the
7:216:16740:18:18:72:451:316:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:treatment arms were offered a saving device to help them reach that goal.
7:217:16813:18:18:89:539:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the first experimental treatment (Safe Box), respondents were given a simple locked
7:218:16899:18:18:72:540:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:box made out of metal. The box had a deposit slit at the top, similar to a piggy bank. The
7:219:16989:18:18:72:540:262:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:box was locked with a padlock, and the key to the padlock was provided to the participants.
7:220:17080:18:18:72:540:244:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Each participant was also given a passbook in which they could record the deposits made
7:221:17167:18:18:72:540:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the box, so that they could keep track of the total amount in the box without having to
7:222:17257:18:18:72:540:208:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:open it. They were asked to record what health product they were saving for, and its cost,
7:223:17347:18:18:72:164:190:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on the front page.
7:224:17365:18:18:89:540:172:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the second experimental treatment (Lockbox), respondents were given a passbook and
7:225:17450:18:18:72:540:154:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a locked box identical to those in theSafe Boxtreatment, except that they were not given
7:226:17538:18:17:72:540:136:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the key to the padlock. Instead, the key was kept by the program officer, so that respondents
7:227:17631:17:32:72:540:119:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:could not open the box on their own. The cell phone number of the program officer was
7:228:17716:32:15:88:540:87:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:4In the Appendix, we use data from a census of rural households in a nearby part of Kenya to examine
7:229:17816:15:0:71:240:72:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:determinants of ROSCA participation.
8:230:17853:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:written on the passbook, and participants were instructed to call the program officer once
8:231:17943:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:they had reached their saving goal. The program officer would then meet the participant
8:232:18030:18:18:72:459:672:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:and open theLockboxat the shop where the product could be purchased.5,6
8:233:18101:18:18:89:539:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the third experimental treatment, we encouraged participants to use their existing
8:234:18186:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ROSCA structure to create a “Health Pot.” TheHealth Potwas simply a side pot that the
8:235:18271:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:members could contribute to in addition to the regular ROSCA pot. As with the regular
8:236:18356:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pot, people would contribute to the health pot at each meeting. The only difference was that
8:237:18448:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this pot would be earmarked for a specific health product. To keep the logistics manageable,
8:238:18540:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we encouraged people to save for the same product (so that contribution amounts and cycle
8:239:18629:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lengths did not vary across people). The size of the health contribution would depend on the
8:240:18721:18:18:72:539:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:health product chosen and the number of people participating in theHealth Potscheme. For
8:241:18809:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:instance, if 10 out of 15 ROSCA participants decided to create a side pot in order to acquire
8:242:18902:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a bednet worth 250 Ksh, each participant would have to contribute 25 Ksh to the side pot
8:243:18990:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at each meeting so that one participant could receive the bednet. To ensure that the health
8:244:19081:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pot would be used to acquire the chosen product, ROSCAs were encouraged to purchase the
8:245:19168:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:health product on the behalf of the pot recipient or to accompany the pot recipient to the
8:246:19258:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shop where the product was to be purchased, instead of letting the recipient walk away from
8:247:19349:18:18:72:247:403:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:the meeting with the pot in cash.7
8:248:19383:18:18:89:539:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The fourth experimental treatment (Health Savings Account, orHSA) also took advan-
8:249:19465:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tage of the ROSCA structure, but this treatment did not require agreement across members.
8:250:19554:18:18:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Each participant was encouraged to make regular deposits into an individualHSAmanaged
8:251:19639:18:18:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by the ROSCA treasurer. The treasurer was given a ledger book in which to record deposits,
8:252:19729:18:18:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:withdrawals and balances for each member’s account. The funds deposited into theHSAs
8:253:19813:18:18:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:were earmarked for health – ROSCA treasurers were encouraged to not allow withdrawals
8:254:19898:18:18:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unless the participant needed money for health expenditures (such as clinic fees or medica-
8:255:19989:18:18:72:539:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tions). The money saved inHSAsby ROSCA members was usually kept by the treasurer of
8:256:20072:18:22:72:439:241:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:the ROSCA, or deposited in a bank account if the ROSCA owned one.8
8:257:20138:22:16:88:540:219:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:5Providing boxes was inspired by the lockbox offered as part of the SEED program designed by Ashraf,
8:258:20238:16:12:71:539:203:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:Karlan, and Yin (2006a). In that study, participants would have to bring their lockbox to the bank to get it
8:259:20346:12:8:71:539:191:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:opened and the money in the box would be immediately deposited into the bank account by the bank teller.
8:260:20450:8:16:88:540:183:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:6While the program officers told individuals that they could only use the money for their health savings
8:261:20554:16:12:71:539:167:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:goal, this could not actually be enforced in the field. If, for example, a respondent called the program officer
8:262:20666:12:12:71:539:155:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:to open the box but demanded to use the cash for something else, the program officer could not force her
8:263:20770:12:12:71:539:143:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:to follow through on her goal. However, the vast majority (74%) of those who called the program officer to
8:264:20876:12:12:71:539:131:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:open the box purchased the product in front of the program officer. The remainder said that they would do
8:265:20981:12:12:71:539:119:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:so later. In a follow-up survey, we asked people if they thought that they were allowed to get the box opened
8:266:21090:12:12:71:539:107:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:to purchase something other than their goal, and only 6% said they thought they could. Thus it seems that,
8:267:21196:12:8:71:403:95:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:as intended, people thought of the lockbox as featuring strong commitment.
8:268:21270:8:12:88:330:87:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:A:7As discussed later, the majority did this (see Table 2).
8:269:21327:12:0:88:540:75:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:8Many ROSCAs hold money with the treasurer, either because they have a welfare insurance fund or
9:270:21424:0:18:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:As we will discuss below, as these technologies differ in the type and amount of commit-
9:271:21512:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ment features they provide, comparing savings under the different technologies will allow us
9:272:21604:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to estimate which features are most important and to back out the relative importance of
9:273:21692:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:various savings barriers. However, the technologies also differ in one other important way:
9:274:21783:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:two of them were geared towards mobilizing savings for preventative health products (the
9:275:21871:18:18:72:539:618:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:B:Lockboxand theHealth Pot), one was geared towards building savings to rely on in case
9:276:21956:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:health shocks occur (theHSA), and one was geared towards both these aims (theSafe Box).
9:277:22043:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Thus, in our empirical analysis, we separately examine the two types of savings in estimating
9:278:22136:18:39:72:107:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effects.
9:279:22144:39:26:72:409:525:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:2.2  Features of the Experimental Technologies
9:280:22190:26:17:72:540:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:As shown in Figure 1, the four experimental saving technologies offered various combinations
9:281:22282:17:18:72:540:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of a set of three features: secure and designated storage, earmarking, and social commitment
9:282:22374:18:39:72:176:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bundled with credit.

9:296:22728:43:18:89:539:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The most basic intervention was theSafe Box, which provided only a designated, secure
9:297:22813:18:17:71:540:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:place to store money. TheLockboxandHSAinterventions differed from theSafe Boxonly
9:298:22894:17:18:71:539:174:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the earmarking they provided: the money stored in these two schemes could not be spent
9:299:22983:18:18:71:539:156:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on anything other than preventative health and medical expenditures, respectively. Finally,
9:300:23074:18:18:71:539:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:theHealth Potfeatured social commitment and credit on top of the earmarking and storage.
9:301:23162:18:18:71:539:120:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The social commitment feature comes from the fact that ROSCAs by definition exert group
9:302:23249:18:30:71:539:102:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pressure to make deposits. This is a much stronger form of commitment than the individual
9:303:23338:30:0:72:465:72:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:offer individual credit to members (in addition to the main pot). See Appendix Table A1.
10:304:23427:0:18:72:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:savings technologies: while any money put into theLockbox,HSA, andHealth Potcould only
10:305:23513:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be used for health, only theHealth Potprovided any pressure to actually make deposits.
10:306:23599:18:18:72:539:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The credit feature of theHealth Potcomes from the fact that all but the last member of the
10:307:23689:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:group would receive the health product earlier than they would if they instead saved alone.
10:308:23780:18:18:89:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:If we callP1,P2, andP3the effects on preventative health investments of, respectively,
10:309:23866:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:theSafe Box, theLockbox, and theHealth Pot, we can estimate the role of having a safe and
10:310:23955:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:designated storage technology for preventative health savings asP1; we can estimate the role
10:311:24047:18:18:72:539:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of earmarking as (P2−P1); and we can estimate the combined roles of social commitment
10:312:24132:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and credit as (P3−P2). Likewise, if we callT1andT4the effects on availability of funds for
10:313:24222:18:18:71:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:health emergencies of, respectively, theSafe Boxand theHSA, thenT1will reflect the role
10:314:24309:18:39:71:486:528:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:of having a storage technology; and (T4−T1) will reflect the role of earmarking.9
10:315:24390:39:25:71:378:489:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:2.3  When Should These Features Matter?
10:316:24429:25:18:71:539:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We expect the three features to have differential effects on health savings, depending on the
10:317:24522:18:35:71:307:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:types of savings barriers that individuals face.
10:318:24570:35:18:71:540:411:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:B:StorageThere are two important ways through which access to a safe storage technology
10:319:24655:18:18:71:323:393:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:designated for savings can affect saving behavior.
10:320:24705:18:18:89:539:375:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:First, even though outright theft of money is not commonly reported by respondents,
10:321:24788:18:18:71:539:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:people may be hesitant to simply leave cash unsecured at home. For this reason, a secure
10:322:24876:18:18:71:539:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:storage technology can enable individuals to avoid carrying loose cash on their person and
10:323:24966:18:18:71:539:321:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:thus allow people to keep some physical distance between themselves and their money. This
10:324:25055:18:17:71:539:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:may make it easier to resist “temptations”, to borrow the terminology in Banerjee and
10:325:25140:17:18:71:539:286:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Mullainathan (2010), or “unplanned expenditures”, as many of our respondents call them.
10:326:25227:18:18:71:539:268:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:While these unplanned expenditures include luxury items such as treats, another important
10:327:25316:18:18:71:425:250:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:category among such unplanned expenditures are transfers to others.
10:328:25383:18:18:89:539:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Second, a storage technology can increase the “mental costs” associated with unplanned
10:329:25469:18:18:71:539:214:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expenditures, thereby reducing such expenditures. Indeed, if people use the storage technol-
10:330:25561:18:18:71:539:196:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ogy to save towards a specific goal, people may consider the money saved as unavailable for
10:331:25652:18:18:71:539:178:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:purposes other than the specific goal – this is what Thaler (1990) coined “mental account-
10:332:25742:18:18:71:539:160:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ing”. By enabling such mental accounting, a designated storage place may give people the
10:333:25830:18:18:71:539:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:strength to resist frivolous expenditures as well as pressure to share with others, including
10:334:25923:18:25:71:136:124:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their spouse.
10:335:25936:25:16:88:539:99:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:9Note that since theSafe Boxoffered the flexibility to save towards something else than health, the
10:336:26035:16:11:72:540:83:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:impact of having a safe and designated storage technology on overall savings may well be larger than the
10:337:26139:11:0:72:275:72:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:sum of the effects we estimate withP1andT1.
11:338:26183:0:18:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In Section 7, we will discuss results from in-depth exit interviews we conducted with a
11:339:26270:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:random subset of respondents. Those interviews yield evidence which shows that both of
11:340:26356:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:these effects (physical distance and mental accounting) were at play and explain the large
11:341:26446:18:35:72:246:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f8:B:observed impacts of theSafe Box.
11:342:26478:35:18:72:539:619:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:B:EarmarkingEarmarking (E) has an obvious liquidity cost. Thus, if earmarking enables
11:343:26561:18:18:72:540:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:savings for some people, it must be that for them the value of the earmarking outweighs the
11:344:26652:18:18:72:540:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:liquidity cost. There are two types of people for whom that might be the case. First, ear-
11:345:26742:18:18:72:540:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:marking might help people for whom the pressure to share is so strong that they need a way
11:346:26832:18:18:72:540:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to tie up money. Second, earmarking might be valuable for people that are trying to over-
11:347:26921:18:17:72:540:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:come intra-personal barriers (those with time-inconsistent preferences). Among this group,
11:348:27011:17:18:72:540:512:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:only “sophisticated” individuals should value earmarking to impose self-control, however,
11:349:27100:18:18:72:483:494:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:since “naive” individuals, by definition, lack the awareness to see the value of it.
11:350:27184:18:18:89:539:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:An important point is that the value attached to earmarking for preventative health in-
11:351:27271:18:18:72:540:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:vestments (P2−P1) might differ from the value attached to earmarking for health emergencies
11:352:27362:18:18:72:539:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(T4−T1). In particular, in our study context, it is likely that earmarking for emergencies is
11:353:27455:18:18:72:540:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:valued more than earmarking for preventative health. This is because the most important
11:354:27542:18:18:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:form of risk facing rural households in Western Kenya is illness, and theHSAwas specifi-
11:355:27630:18:18:72:539:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cally designed to allow withdrawals for such shocks. This means that theHSAhad a much
11:356:27715:18:18:71:539:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lower “liquidity cost” than theLockbox. In addition, people may simply value savings for
11:357:27803:18:34:71:312:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:emergencies more than for preventative health.
11:358:27849:34:18:71:539:316:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:B:Social Commitment and Credit (C)This bundle, given the credit aspect, should ap-
11:359:27929:18:18:71:539:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:peal to everyone in our sample (especially since they are already engaged in the ROSCA).
11:360:28017:18:18:71:539:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Its effect should be largest for those naive present-biased individuals, for whom neither a
11:361:28108:18:45:71:504:262:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:designated storage place nor earmarking alone would be enough, as discussed above.

11:363:28208:35:25:71:366:182:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:3.1  Sampling Frame and Randomization
11:364:28245:25:18:71:539:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Between May and July 2008, we compiled a “census” of all the ROSCAs that could be
11:365:28326:18:18:71:539:139:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:identified around a given set of market places in one administrative division of Western
11:366:28414:18:18:71:539:121:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Kenya. For each ROSCA in the census, we administered a baseline survey to identify the
11:367:28500:18:18:71:539:103:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:size of the ROSCA, the contribution frequency, the services the ROSCA provided, and the
11:368:28587:18:0:71:539:85:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:list of members. ROSCAs that did not have a regular meeting schedule or that met daily
12:369:28674:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:were not eligible for the study (because these types of ROSCAs were usually for very short-
12:370:28765:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:term savings among market vendors). A total of 143 eligible ROSCAs were identified in this
12:371:28855:18:18:72:114:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:manner.
12:372:28862:18:18:89:539:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:These 143 ROSCAs were randomized into 5 groups: one control and four treatment
12:373:28940:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:groups corresponding to the four experimental treatments described above. The randomiza-
12:374:29028:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tion was done after stratifying on three ROSCA characteristics (gender composition, meeting
12:375:29119:18:39:72:422:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:frequency, and whether the ROSCA provided loans to its members).
12:376:29183:39:26:72:318:561:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:3.2  Baseline ROSCA Information
12:377:29214:26:18:72:540:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We were not able to enroll all 143 ROSCAs in the study. By the time we attempted to meet
12:378:29302:18:18:72:540:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with ROSCAs to conduct the baseline (between August and October 2008), 11 ROSCAs
12:379:29382:18:17:72:540:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(7.7%) had been discontinued, and 19 (13.3%) others were not interested in the program.
12:380:29469:17:18:72:540:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This left us with 113 ROSCAs in the final sample. Appendix Table A1 provides character-
12:381:29556:18:18:72:540:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:istics on these 113 ROSCAs. We present means by treatment groups, as well as p-values for
12:382:29645:18:18:72:540:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tests comparing means across treatment groups. Despite the fact that we lost 21% of the
12:383:29732:18:18:72:540:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ROSCAs after the random assignment, the groups appear relatively balanced, suggesting
12:384:29817:18:18:72:540:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that ROSCA attrition was orthogonal to the experimental treatment assignment (which is
12:385:29903:18:18:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to be expected since ROSCAs did not know anything about the treatment at the time they
12:386:29989:18:18:72:119:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:attrited).
12:387:29999:18:18:89:539:356:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Though the characteristics of the ROSCAs themselves are not the focus of our paper,
12:388:30082:18:18:72:540:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:several are of some interest. First, most members are women: 74% of ROSCA participants
12:389:30168:18:18:72:540:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are women, and 32% of ROSCAs have only female members. The average ROSCA in our
12:390:30247:18:18:72:540:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sample has 17 members, meets two to three times a month, and the average monthly con-
12:391:30332:18:18:72:540:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tribution is 393 Ksh (US $5.24). Also of note is that many ROSCAs provide other services,
12:392:30421:18:17:72:540:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:besides the savings pot: 64% provide loans to members, and 54% have an insurance fund
12:393:30506:17:18:72:540:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(principally for funerals or, in some cases, illnesses which require hospitalization). Finally,
12:394:30601:18:18:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:98% of ROSCAs use a fixed, rather than a random order or a bidding process to allocate
12:395:30687:18:39:72:113:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the pot.
12:396:30695:39:26:72:348:174:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:3.3  Offer of Experimental Treatments
12:397:30732:26:18:72:540:148:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In each ROSCA that could be enrolled in the study, the assigned experimental treatment
12:398:30818:18:18:72:540:130:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(if any) was offered to participants during a regular ROSCA meeting. During the meet-
12:399:30903:18:18:72:540:112:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ing, participants in all ROSCAs, including the control group, were given information about
12:400:30993:18:18:72:540:94:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:preventative health products (examples included bednets, water chlorination products, and
12:401:31082:18:0:72:540:76:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ceramic water filters) and were encouraged to save towards investing in these products. Since
13:402:31177:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the control group was given the exact same information and encouragement as the treatment
13:403:31266:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:groups, any observed post-treatment differences in health investments across groups can and
13:404:31357:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:should be interpreted as the impacts of the saving technologies introduced, rather than as
13:405:31447:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:differences in encouragement. For this reason, the comparison group should be thought of as
13:406:31538:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an “Encouragement Group” rather than as a pure control which received no treatment what-
13:407:31626:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:soever. In the four treatment groups, the savings devices were introduced and explained right
13:408:31719:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:after the encouragement was provided. All ROSCA members were offered the treatment (a
13:409:31804:18:39:72:438:582:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:total of about 1,900 people in total across the four treatment groups).10
13:410:31877:39:26:72:207:543:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:3.4  Baseline Data
13:411:31895:26:18:72:540:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:A random subset of ROSCA members were sampled (using a random number table) for data
13:412:31979:18:17:72:540:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:collection during the same meeting at which the encouragement and treatment offer (when
13:413:32066:17:18:72:540:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:applicable) were provided. In total, we enrolled 771 respondents into the surveys across all
13:414:32158:18:18:72:540:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:113 participating ROSCAs.  After obtaining consent, those respondents selected for data
13:415:32245:18:18:72:271:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:collection were given a baseline survey.
13:416:32285:18:18:89:539:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The survey included modules on basic household demographics, time and risk preferences,
13:417:32372:18:18:72:540:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and health investments.  Importantly, the survey also included questions on whether the
13:418:32459:18:18:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:respondent had a health savings goal, what this goal was, how much money the respondent
13:419:32546:18:18:72:540:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:needed to save to reach the goal, and how long the respondent thought it would take to
13:420:32632:18:18:72:540:356:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reach that goal. Likely because people had been primed to think about health from the
13:421:32717:18:18:72:540:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:encouragement, most respondents reported having some type of health savings goal.  In
13:422:32802:18:18:72:540:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fact, over half of respondents reported that their goal was one of the preventative health
13:423:32892:18:18:72:540:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:products that were showcased during the encouragement talk (the most popular products
13:424:32977:18:18:72:540:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:were bednets and water purification products). The average value of the goal was relatively
13:425:33068:18:17:72:540:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:large given average incomes (548 Ksh after trimming the top 1%, around $7.31 US), and
13:426:33153:17:18:72:540:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:respondents estimated they needed 2.5 months on average to reach that goal (as we will see
13:427:33243:18:18:72:410:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:below, this turns out to be an extremely overoptimistic estimate).
13:428:33309:18:18:89:540:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Note that in the treatment groups, goal elicitation took placeafterthe experimental
13:429:33392:18:18:71:539:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:saving technologies had been offered. This means that the treatment could have affected the
13:430:33483:18:18:71:539:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:goal chosen by the respondents. We present results on how the goals varied by treatment
13:431:33570:18:18:71:539:159:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:arms in Appendix Table A2. Overall, we see some differences between the groups, though
13:432:33656:18:18:71:539:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:they are relatively minor. Given that these differences are potentially endogenous, however,
13:433:33748:18:24:71:539:123:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we consider the reaching of one’s specific goal as supportive evidence, rather than the main
13:434:33840:24:16:84:540:99:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:10Note that this means that, even for the individual devices (theSafe Box, theLockbox, or theHSA), the
13:435:33942:16:11:72:540:83:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:offer was made in the presence of others and each participant’s decision to take-up the offer was public (just
13:436:34052:11:0:72:404:72:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:as the decision to participate in theHealth Pothad to be public by nature).
14:437:34129:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:outcome of interest. To estimate impacts, we instead focus on overall health investments
14:438:34217:18:39:72:378:690:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:and savings, measured through detailed follow-up surveys.11
14:439:34276:39:26:72:217:651:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:3.5  Follow-up Data
14:440:34295:26:18:72:540:625:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We conducted two follow-up surveys, a midline after 6 months and an endline after 1 year,
14:441:34384:18:18:72:540:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:both of which included modules similar to those administered at baseline. For respondents
14:442:34473:18:18:72:540:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the treatment groups, treatment-specific modules were administered in addition to the
14:443:34561:18:18:72:540:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:general survey. In particular, respondents in theSafe BoxandLockboxgroups were asked to
14:444:34648:18:18:72:539:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:produce their box. In theSafe Boxgroup, respondents were asked to open the box so that
14:445:34734:18:18:72:539:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the enumerator could record the amount that was in it. In theLockboxgroup, enumerators
14:446:34820:18:18:72:540:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:brought the key with them for the survey; they opened the box, counted the money and
14:447:34904:18:17:72:540:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:then closed the box again. They then offered the respondent the option to keep the key.
14:448:34991:17:18:72:540:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:If the respondent refused the key, the enumerator brought the key back to the office. For
14:449:35080:18:18:72:539:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:respondents in theHSAgroup, the treasurer’s records of all deposits and withdrawals were
14:450:35168:18:18:72:108:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:copied.
14:451:35175:18:18:89:539:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Close to 95% of the sample could be interviewed for the 6-month follow-up, and 92% could
14:452:35263:18:18:72:540:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be interviewed for the 12-month follow-up. Attrition was not differential across experimental
14:453:35356:18:39:72:364:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:arms, either at 6 or 12 months (see Appendix Table A3).
14:454:35411:39:26:72:312:353:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:3.6  Final Sample Characteristics
14:455:35444:26:18:72:540:327:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Table 1 presents baseline characteristics for the final sample available for the analysis. Col-
14:456:35539:18:18:72:540:309:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:umn 1 presents the sample mean and standard deviation for a series of characteristics. To
14:457:35628:18:17:72:540:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:test for balance across groups, columns 2-5 present the coefficient estimates (and standard
14:458:35719:17:18:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:errors) of the difference, for each group, between the baseline mean in the treatment group
14:459:35810:18:18:72:540:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the mean in the control group. Since randomization was done at the ROSCA level, the
14:460:35897:18:18:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:standard errors are adjusted for clustering at that level. Column 6 presents the p-value for
14:461:35989:18:18:72:359:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an F-test of the equality of means across all five groups.
14:462:36047:18:18:89:539:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:A few characteristics of the sample are worth mentioning.  First, since our sample is
14:463:36132:18:18:72:540:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:representative of ROSCA participants, it is heavily female (74%). Second, the great majority
14:464:36224:18:18:72:540:166:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of respondents are married (75% of women and 88% of men). Respondents are around 39
14:465:36307:18:18:72:540:148:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:years old, and have close to 4 children on average. Education levels are relatively low (average
14:466:36403:18:18:72:540:130:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:years of education is just 6.3, much less than the 8 needed to complete primary school). The
14:467:36495:18:25:72:540:112:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sample is also quite poor. Less than a quarter of people have a cement floor in the house
14:468:36584:25:15:84:540:87:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:11We also tested whether knowing one’s experimental treatment status affected the time and risk prefer-
14:469:36687:15:0:72:457:72:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:ences we measured in the baseline survey. We find no evidence that it did (see Table 1).
15:470:36777:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(i.e, they have a dirt floor), and average weekly income reported by respondents is around
15:471:36867:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:600 Ksh (US $8). We do not have data on spousal income, but given the large number of
15:472:36952:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dependents, it is likely that income for the average household in our sample is below the $1
15:473:37044:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:per person per day extreme poverty threshold. Health investments are relatively low – the
15:474:37133:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:average respondent owns just ovet 1.5 bednets for a household size of 5 or more, and only
15:475:37222:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:about half of respondents report using chlorine to treat their water. Consequently, health
15:476:37312:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is also very poor. Respondents reported that 34% of their children under 5 had malaria in
15:477:37401:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the month preceding the baseline survey, and 20% of respondents reported having malaria
15:478:37488:18:18:72:213:564:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:in that month themselves.12
15:479:37515:18:18:89:539:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In terms of time preferences, only about 19% of people are what we call “somewhat
15:480:37596:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:patient” (i.e. prefer 55 Ksh or less in 1 month to 40 Ksh now). About 16% of respondents
15:481:37684:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are present-biased.13Surprisingly, about 18% appear to be more patient in the present than
15:482:37774:18:18:71:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the future.14Finally, a large fraction of respondents (45%) exhibits extreme impatience
15:483:37864:18:17:71:210:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in both present and future.
15:484:37891:17:18:89:539:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Turning to the differences across groups in columns 2-5, the groups appear well-balanced
15:485:37979:18:18:71:539:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:overall, with no more significant differences than should be expected. There are 21 dependent
15:486:38072:18:18:71:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variables, and therefore21×4 = 84coefficients estimated in Table 1.  Only 5, 3 and 0
15:487:38156:18:18:71:539:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:coefficients are significantly different from zero at the 10, 5 and 1 percent level, respectively.
15:488:38254:18:18:89:539:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Note that some respondents belonged to two or more ROSCAs enrolled in the study. Thus
15:489:38339:18:18:71:539:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:some respondents (9% of the sample) were exposed to more than one experimental treatment.
15:490:38428:18:18:71:539:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:While the likelihood of being exposed to more than one treatment is not exogenous (it
15:491:38513:18:18:71:539:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:depends on the number of ROSCAs one participates in), the combination of treatments one
15:492:38600:18:18:71:539:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is exposed to, holding constant the number of ROSCAs, is exogenous. For this reason, we
15:493:38687:18:18:71:539:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:include a dummy for being exposed to more than one treatment as a control in the regression
15:494:38778:18:18:71:148:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:analysis below.
15:495:38793:18:18:89:539:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Before turning to the results, we want to note that our sample is not representative of
15:496:38880:18:22:71:539:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the entire population, but instead is representative only of the roughly 40% of people who
15:497:38970:22:16:84:540:219:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:12These are likely overestimates since malaria is typically self-diagnosed and households tend to call
15:498:39072:16:12:72:540:203:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:“malaria” any illness episodes with fever (Cohen et al. 2011). However, self-reported malaria episodes are
15:499:39178:12:8:72:209:191:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:still relatively severe sicknesses.
15:500:39213:8:16:84:540:183:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:13For measures of time consistency, we assign people to one of four categories: (1) “present-biased”
15:501:39313:16:12:72:540:167:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:individuals who exhibit a higher discount rate in the present than in the future; (2) respondents who exhibit
15:502:39422:12:12:72:540:155:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:maximum possible discount rates in both the present and future (these individuals preferred 40 Ksh to 500
15:503:39527:12:12:72:540:143:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:Ksh in 1 month, and 40 Ksh in 1 month to 500 Ksh in 2 months); (3) respondents who are more patient in
15:504:39629:12:12:72:540:131:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:the future than in the present; and (4) “time-consistent” individuals who have the same discount rate in the
15:505:39737:12:8:72:172:119:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:present and the future.
15:506:39760:8:16:84:540:111:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:14Though this seems counter-intuitive, previous studies have found similar results: about 10% of respon-
15:507:39864:16:12:72:540:95:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:dents from India in Bauer et al. (2010) and 15% of respondents from the Philippines in Ashraf et al. (2006a)
15:508:39972:12:12:72:540:83:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:had preferences of this type. We also found similar levels in a previous study in the same area of study
15:509:40076:12:0:72:197:71:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:(Dupas and Robinson 2009).
16:510:40104:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:participate in ROSCAs. In Appendix A1, we present descriptive evidence of selection into
16:511:40192:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ROSCAs. ROSCA participants are slightly richer and more educated than average, and are
16:512:40278:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more likely to be women. More fundamentally, our sample includes only individuals who
16:513:40363:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:already self-selected into participating into a savings club, which means that we are looking
16:514:40456:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at a group of people who potentially have a higher propensity or desire to save than average.
16:515:40549:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The fact that we find significant barriers to savings among this group suggests that the rest
16:516:40642:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the population might be having even more difficulty saving, but we cannot test that in
16:517:40731:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this study.  We leave this for future work, but to fix ideas, Appendix A2 ventures a few
16:518:40819:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hypotheses as to how the savings devices that we identify as effective in our sample would
16:519:40909:18:45:72:266:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:likely affect non-ROSCA participants.
16:520:40946:45:30:72:245:501:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:4  Results: Take-up
16:521:40965:30:18:72:540:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Table 2 presents summary statistics on take-up of each of the four experimental devices. As
16:522:41056:18:18:72:540:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mentioned above, take-up was measured for the full sample at two points in time, 6 and 12
16:523:41145:18:18:72:397:435:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:months after the introduction of the experimental treatments.15
16:524:41208:18:17:89:539:417:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Overall take-up was very high for all four devices. At the 6-month mark, 74% of those
16:525:41293:17:18:71:540:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sampled for aSafe Boxand 69% of those sampled for aLockboxhad a positive amount of
16:526:41375:18:18:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cash in their box at the time of the (unannounced) survey. These figures had barely changed
16:527:41466:18:18:72:539:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by the 12-month follow-up: 71% of theSafe Boxgroup and 66% of theLockboxgroup still
16:528:41549:18:18:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:had positive amounts in their box. For the ROSCA-level interventions, take-up was equally
16:529:41638:18:18:72:539:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:high.  About 65% of respondents had elected to participate in aHealth Potwith fellow
16:530:41722:18:18:72:540:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ROSCA members at the 6-month follow-up, and this figure had increased to 71% after one
16:531:41808:18:18:72:540:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f8:B:year.16Take-up of theHSAs was even higher: 93% of respondents elected to create anHSA
16:532:41893:18:18:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:within 6 months and 97% created one within 12 months. The high take-up rates for both
16:533:41978:18:18:72:539:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:theHealth Potand theHSAare quite striking given the fact that they both required some
16:534:42063:18:18:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:level of cooperation between ROSCA members. For theHealth Pot, members had to agree
16:535:42146:18:18:72:539:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on a specific health product that everybody wanted. For theHSA, members had to trust
16:536:42230:18:31:72:141:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the treasurer.
16:537:42244:31:16:84:539:171:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f10:F:15Our take-up analysis is limited by the fact that we do not observe total deposits. For theSafe Box
16:538:42344:16:12:71:540:155:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:and theLockboxtreatments, we only observe savings balances when the boxes were opened at follow-up.
16:539:42443:12:12:71:539:143:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:We attempted to collect information on total deposits by asking respondents to show us the passbooks they
16:540:42548:12:12:71:539:131:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:had been given along with the boxes, but most respondents did not keep their passbook up to date. For the
16:541:42653:12:12:71:539:119:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f7:F:Health Pottreatment, we also do not have good measures of actual contribution amounts, since those were
16:542:42756:12:8:71:341:107:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:collected at the ROSCA and the ROSCA records were spotty.
16:543:42813:8:16:84:540:99:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f10:F:16Note that the adoption at the ROSCA level is slightly higher, with 19 out of 23 ROSCAs in theHealth
16:544:42914:16:12:72:539:83:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f7:F:Potgroup starting a health pot, or 82%. Not all ROSCA members elected to participate in the scheme,
16:545:43013:12:0:72:340:71:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:however, so the take-up figure at the individual level is lower.
17:546:43079:0:18:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:While take-up of theLockboxwas almost as high as that of theSafe Box, the intensity
17:547:43162:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of usage was significantly higher for theSafe Box. Among those with a positive balance in
17:548:43251:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:theirSafe Box, average balances were 634 Ksh (US$ 8.4) after 6 months and 311 Ksh (US$
17:549:43337:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:4.1) after 12 months. Since these are total balances, not deposits, they are lower bounds on
17:550:43429:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:amounts saved. The lower balance (and lower variance) after 12 months suggests that most
17:551:43517:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:respondents withdrew money from the box to make a purchase between the first and second
17:552:43604:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:follow-ups. Amounts saved in theLockboxwere also relatively large, but lower than those
17:553:43691:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:observed inSafe Box. While the median balance in theLockboxwas comparable to that of
17:554:43775:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:theSafe Boxgroup at both 6 and 12 months, the average balance was about half that of the
17:555:43863:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:B:Safe Boxafter six months. The average balance in theLockboxhad increased to 570 Ksh at
17:556:43949:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:12 months. For the majority of lockbox users, this represents not only the current balance
17:557:44039:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:but also the total ever deposited, since they never called the program officer to withdraw
17:558:44129:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from the box. Indeed, as Panel B shows, only 18% of respondents had called the program
17:559:44215:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:officer and asked for their box to get opened within the first 6 months. This had increased
17:560:44306:17:18:72:539:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to 31% by 12 months. Overall, while theLockboxappears to be dominated by theSafe Box,
17:561:44391:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the data suggests that theLockboxwas still better than nothing, and that people would have
17:562:44481:18:18:72:369:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:eventually saved up significant sums if given enough time.
17:563:44539:18:18:89:539:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The median and mean balance among those who opened anHSAreached 90 and 189
17:564:44613:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Ksh (US$ 2.5) after 12 months, respectively. These figures are somewhat lower than those
17:565:44701:18:18:72:197:367:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:observed for the boxes.17
17:566:44726:18:18:89:539:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Panels B, C and D provide additional details on how respondents used the four devices.
17:567:44812:18:18:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:To start, Panel B suggests that the demand for the earmarking feature (the unavailability
17:568:44901:18:18:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the key) remained very high over time. After 6 months, lockbox owners were asked: “Do
17:569:44989:18:18:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:you want the key now, or do you want me to hold on to the key?” Of the 88% who still
17:570:45073:18:18:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:had the box after 6 months, the majority (75%) requested that the program officer hold the
17:571:45163:18:18:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:key. At 12 months, when the program ended and the program officer handed the key to the
17:572:45250:18:17:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:participants, about 12% asked if it was possible to extend the program and for the officer to
17:573:45343:17:18:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:keep the key (unfortunately this was not possible for budgetary reasons). Thus, even though
17:574:45434:18:18:72:539:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:theSafe Boxhad the larger impact on health investments (as we will show below), some
17:575:45518:18:18:72:539:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:individuals seemed to have valued the earmarking that theLockboxafforded.18For both box
17:576:45605:18:23:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:groups, secrecy (at least from the spouse) was not a major reason for usage. After 6 months,
17:577:45697:23:16:84:540:147:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:17For both boxes and theHSA, the balances observed are relatively small compared to average monthly
17:578:45796:16:12:72:540:131:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:ROSCA contributions, which are around 393 Ksh per month (see Appendix Table A1). However, since the
17:579:45895:12:8:72:511:119:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:median balance is always lower than the mean, some people used these technologies very intensively.
17:580:45994:8:16:84:540:111:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:18This could be due tostatus quobias. Ideally, to quantify the importance of thestatus quobias, we
17:581:46092:16:12:72:540:95:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:would have askedSafe Boxholders if they were interested in letting the research team hold the key for them.
17:582:46199:12:12:72:539:83:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:We did not offer them that option, but we note that at the follow-up only 4% ofSafe Boxholders reported
17:583:46302:12:0:72:440:71:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:storing the key with someone else, suggesting that thestatus quobias is likely large.
18:584:46389:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:78% ofSafe Boxspouses and 79% ofLockboxspouses knew about the box. This increased
18:585:46470:18:18:72:199:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to over 90% after 1 year.
18:586:46495:18:18:89:539:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Panel C shows that the ROSCAs that formed aHealth Potfor the most part enforced the
18:587:46578:18:18:71:539:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:earmarking feature: the majority of health pot recipients were either given the pot in-kind
18:588:46669:18:18:71:539:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(i.e. they received the agreed upon health product rather than the cash equivalent), or were
18:589:46761:18:18:71:303:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:accompanied to the shop to buy the product.
18:590:46804:18:18:89:539:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, Panel D, based on records kept by ROSCA treasurers in theHSAgroup, shows
18:591:46885:18:18:71:473:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that participants made a substantial number of small deposits into theirHSA.
18:592:46961:18:18:89:539:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:It is possible that the money put into these various devices displaced other types of
18:593:47046:18:18:71:539:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:savings. Some of the evidence we show in section 7.3 suggests it might have. In particular,
18:594:47137:18:18:71:539:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the boxes appear to have somewhat crowded-out ROSCA savings in the long run. On the
18:595:47220:18:18:71:539:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:other hand, the amount households reported spending on durables or on animals were, if
18:596:47306:18:18:71:539:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:anything, higher in the treatment groups than the control group over the study period (data
18:597:47397:18:17:71:539:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not shown). In any case, even if there were crowding out, the take-up results suggest that
18:598:47487:17:46:71:539:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the savings devices we consider here are preferred to the alternative people had been using.

18:615:48170:18:18:89:539:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We consider three measures of health savings/investments: (1) how much the individual
18:616:48255:18:18:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spent on preventative health products in the year between the baseline and endline; (2)
18:617:48342:18:18:72:540:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:whether the individual had to forgo medical treatment over the past three months for herself
18:618:48434:18:18:72:540:146:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or a family member due to lack of cash; and (3) whether the respondent reached her baseline
18:619:48525:18:29:72:139:128:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:saving goal.19
18:620:48539:29:16:84:540:99:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:19As can be seen in Appendix Table A2, most respondents reported a preventative health product as a
18:621:48638:16:11:72:540:83:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:goal, but about 16% listed “savings for emergencies” as a goal. In the case of the preventative products, we
18:622:48746:11:0:72:540:72:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:define a respondent as having reached her goal if she purchased that item. For emergency savings, we do
19:623:48851:0:18:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Estimates of equation (1) are presented in Table 3. We focus on the results at the 12-
19:624:48937:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:month follow-up because it took that long to generate substantial impacts.20Columns 1
19:625:49022:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and 2 present the results for preventative investments, Columns 3 and 4 present the results

19:627:49201:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:results. Regressions without individual controls are shown in the odd numbered columns
19:628:49287:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:while those with the controls are in the even numbered columns. The mean and standard
19:629:49372:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:deviation of the dependent variable for the control group are presented in each column under
19:630:49464:18:18:72:235:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the R-squared of the regression.
19:631:49496:18:18:89:539:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Columns 1 and 2 show that both theSafe Boxand theHealth Pothad significant positive
19:632:49579:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effects on levels of preventative health investments in the 12 months following their intro-
19:633:49671:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:duction. Compared to the control mean, the effects are very large: theSafe Boxincreased
19:634:49758:18:18:72:539:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investment by about 68% while theHealth Potincreased investment by about 129%.21By
19:635:49840:18:18:72:539:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:contrast, theHSAtreatment had no effect on investment, which is not surprising in that it
19:636:49929:18:17:72:347:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:was to be used for saving for health emergencies only.
19:637:49983:17:18:89:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Interestingly, theLockboxhad no effect on investment over the year following its intro-
19:638:50070:18:18:72:539:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:duction. This suggests that the liquidity cost of holding money in theLockboxoutweighed
19:639:50157:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the benefit of earmarking for the average individual. While the take-up results shown in
19:640:50245:18:18:72:539:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Table 2 indicated that people did save in theLockboxso that it is likely that it would have
19:641:50336:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:enabled them to increase preventative health investment if given more time, what is striking
19:642:50428:18:18:72:517:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is that theLockboxwas ineffective over a year, while theSafe Boxwas highly effective.
19:643:50513:18:18:89:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Columns 3 and 4 show that theHSA, which was designed mostly to encourage people to
19:644:50595:18:18:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:build savings to deal with shocks, significantly reduced the likelihood that people would be
19:645:50687:18:18:72:539:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unable to afford medical care. Again, the effect is extremely large: people in theHSAgroup
19:646:50777:18:18:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:were 12 percentage points less likely to be unable to afford treatment, on a base of 31% in
19:647:50868:18:26:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the control group (column 4).22TheSafe Boxalso appeared to be helpful, but the effects
19:648:50954:26:12:72:540:251:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:not have a very good estimate of whether people could reach their goal. While we can observe the amount
19:649:51057:12:12:72:540:239:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:of emergency savings in the HSA and compare that to the listed goal for those in the HSA group, we do not
19:650:51162:12:12:72:540:227:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:have a comparable measure for those in the control group. Instead, for all groups, we define a respondent as
19:651:51270:12:12:72:540:215:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:reaching her health emergency savings goal if she reports having no difficulty paying for medical treatment
19:652:51377:12:12:72:540:203:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:in the past three months. For these 16% of the sample, the likelihood of reaching one’s goal is more than
19:653:51482:12:8:72:322:191:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:double that of those with a preventative investment goal.
19:654:51539:8:16:84:540:183:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:20After 6 months, the effects have the expected sign but none of them are large, nor significant, which is
19:655:51645:16:8:72:480:167:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:not surprising since the amounts needed for the goals were quite large, as shown in Table A2.
19:656:51738:8:16:84:540:159:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:21Note that these increases are not driven by just a few large purchases by a small subsample. While the
19:657:51842:16:12:72:540:143:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:median and mean amounts spent on preventative health products are, respectively, 105 and 207 Ksh in the
19:658:51945:12:12:72:540:131:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:control group, they both increase substantially in the treatment groups: the median and mean are 235 and

19:660:52120:8:16:84:540:111:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:22This effect size appears reasonable. Recall from Table 2, Panel D, that the total deposits recorded in
19:661:52224:16:12:71:540:95:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:theHSAsat the time of the unannounced 12-month follow-up was about 200 Ksh on average. We asked
19:662:52319:12:12:71:539:83:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:those people who couldn’t afford full treatment how much they would have needed to do so. In the control
19:663:52423:12:0:71:539:71:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:group, 200 Ksh corresponded to the 32nd percentile of answers listed. This suggests that the HSA could

20:665:52616:18:18:72:338:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:since they were not designed for this type of saving.
20:666:52669:18:18:89:539:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The last two columns in Table 3 show how the experimental treatments affected the
20:667:52750:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:likelihood that people reached their baseline health goal. While only 34 percent of those in
20:668:52842:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the control group had reached their goal after 12 months, this probability increased by 13
20:669:52932:18:18:72:539:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percentage points in both theSafe Boxand theHealth Potgroups (column 6). Of course, as
20:670:53018:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:discussed earlier, these results should be taken with a grain of salt since people chose their
20:671:53112:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:goals after having received the savings technology, and therefore the goals chosen varied
20:672:53201:18:18:72:515:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:somewhat with the technology received (though not too much, as shown in Table A2).
20:673:53283:18:18:89:539:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:With these estimates, we can attribute the impacts of the experimental saving technolo-
20:674:53370:18:18:72:539:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:gies to one of the three distinct set of attributes: Storage (S), Earmarking (E) and Social
20:675:53461:18:18:72:539:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Credit + Commitment (C). As discussed in Section 2, the relationship between estimates of
20:676:53550:18:32:72:530:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:impacts on preventative health investments and attributes can be summarized as follows:
20:677:53637:32:21:254:305:460:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:?:P1  =S
20:678:53643:21:21:254:333:439:12:g_d0_f13:8:g_d0_f9:?:P2  =S+Ep
20:679:53652:21:33:254:356:418:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:?:P3  =S+Ep+C
20:680:53663:33:18:89:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f8:A:whereP1,P2andP3are the increase in preventative health investments due to theSafe
20:681:53744:18:18:72:329:367:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:B:Box, theLockboxand theHealth Pot, respectively.
20:682:53791:18:18:89:539:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f8:A:From Table 3, Column 2, theSafe Boxincreased investment by 173 Ksh, theLockbox
20:683:53869:18:18:72:539:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by 50 Ksh, and theHealth Potby 332 Ksh. Thus, we estimate that simply having access
20:684:53952:18:18:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to a safe storage place for money (S) accounts for an additional175Ksh in investment.
20:685:54037:18:18:72:539:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Earmarking for preventative health (Ep) is negatively valued at50−175 =−125Ksh. This
20:686:54121:18:17:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:implies that the liquidity cost of earmarking discourages investment on average, compared to
20:687:54213:17:18:72:540:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a storage technology without earmarking. Finally, social commitment and credit (C) have
20:688:54300:18:18:72:539:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the largest impact, estimated at332−50 = 282Ksh. The standard errors on these estimates
20:689:54387:18:39:72:274:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are presented at the bottom of Table 3.

21:707:55075:18:18:71:478:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:people with a given trait is thus the sum of the coefficientsβ+γfor that trait.
21:708:55154:18:18:89:539:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We estimate equation 2 with three traits based on our ex-ante hypotheses as to what
21:709:55237:18:18:71:539:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:savings barriers are most important, as discussed in Section 2.3.  These are (1) whether
21:710:55325:18:18:71:539:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the individual supports other members of the community (this is a dummy equal to 1 if an
21:711:55413:18:18:71:539:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:individual reported giving money to at least one friend or relative in the three months prior
21:712:55506:18:18:71:539:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to the baseline survey, but did not report receiving any money from a friend or relative over
21:713:55599:18:18:71:539:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that same period); (2) whether the individual exhibits present-biased preferences in survey
21:714:55690:18:18:71:539:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:questions; and (3) whether the individual is married. For this latter trait, we must restrict
21:715:55783:18:18:71:539:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the analysis to women only, since there are very few unmarried men in our sample (only 25).
21:716:55874:18:18:89:539:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The results are presented in Tables 4 (preventative investments) and 5 (ability to cope
21:717:55961:18:17:71:539:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with emergencies).  We show four specifications in each table, two with the full sample
21:718:56048:17:18:71:539:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(without and with controls), and two restricted to women only (again, without and with
21:719:56134:18:18:71:539:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:controls). In the first two specifications with the full sample, we include only “provider”
21:720:56225:18:18:71:539:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and “present-bias” dummies in our vector of traits. In the specifications for women, we add
21:721:56316:18:18:71:539:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:“married” in the vector of traits. The estimates and the p-values for the sumsβ+γ, i.e. the
21:722:56407:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:total estimated impacts for those exhibiting a given “trait”, are presented in the column on
21:723:56499:18:35:72:302:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the immediate right of the regression results.
21:724:56545:35:18:72:539:332:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:B:Preventative InvestmentThe results on preventative health investments presented in
21:725:56627:18:18:72:540:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Table 4 suggest substantial heterogeneity in impacts along the three traits considered. First,
21:726:56721:18:18:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we find a significant, positive interaction between “provider” and “lockbox”. This suggests
21:727:56812:18:17:72:540:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that providers are more willing to pay the liquidity cost of earmarking than non-providers
21:728:56902:17:18:72:540:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(likely because having liquidity is less valuable for them since the money would be given away
21:729:56996:18:18:72:540:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:anyway). Similarly, while social commitment and credit are valuable even for non-providers,
21:730:57087:18:18:72:418:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this bundle of features appear to be even more valued by providers.
21:731:57154:18:18:89:539:207:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:People who are not present-biased benefit from theSafe Box, but not from theLockbox.
21:732:57238:18:18:71:539:189:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This result suggests that people who do not need strong commitment are reluctant to tie up
21:733:57328:18:18:71:540:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:money in theLockboxbecause earmarking has little value for them, and so the liquidity cost
21:734:57418:18:18:71:539:153:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dominates. By contrast, those exhibiting present-bias are not able to benefit from the simple
21:735:57511:18:18:71:540:135:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:storage place offered by theSafe Box, since the money is too easily accessible. Interestingly,
21:736:57605:18:18:71:539:117:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:they also do not benefit from the individual earmarking feature offered by theLockbox,
21:737:57691:18:18:71:539:99:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which suggests that they are naive about their present-bias or that they need commitment
21:738:57779:18:0:71:539:81:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to actively save in the device. And indeed, they do benefit from the combination of the
22:739:57868:0:18:72:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stronger commitment to make regular contributions and credit provided by theHealth Pot.
22:740:57955:18:18:89:539:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, the analysis on the female sample in columns 5 to 8 suggests that intra-household
22:741:58045:18:18:71:539:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:issues might be important, but the results are unclear: on one hand, married women seem to
22:742:58135:18:18:71:539:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:benefit from theSafe Boxand theLockboxmore than unmarried women, but on the other
22:743:58216:18:18:71:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hand they benefit less from theHealth Pot. None of these differences between married and
22:744:58304:18:35:71:352:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unmarried women are statistically significant, however.
22:745:58359:35:18:71:539:583:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:B:Coping with EmergenciesTable 5 presents the results on treatment effects heterogeneity
22:746:58445:18:18:71:540:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for the technologies used for emergency savings (theSafe BoxandHSA). Note that the
22:747:58527:18:18:72:540:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dependent variable here is not having enough money to afford full treatment, so that negative
22:748:58620:18:17:72:540:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:coefficients imply that the experimental technologies were effective. We find that the effects
22:749:58714:17:18:72:540:512:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of both theSafe Boxand theHSAare larger for providers than non-providers, larger for
22:750:58798:18:18:71:539:494:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:those do not exhibit present-bias than for those who do, and larger for married women than
22:751:58888:18:18:71:539:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unmarried women. While these differences are not always statistically significant, they are
22:752:58979:18:18:71:352:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:all in line with the predictions discussed in section 2.3.
22:753:59037:18:18:89:539:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, we note that across the entire sample, earmarking is much more valuable here
22:754:59122:18:18:71:539:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f8:B:than it was for preventative investment (which can be seen by comparing the overallLockbox
22:755:59212:18:18:71:540:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effect in Table 4 to the overallHSAeffect in Table 5). This result suggests that people in
22:756:59302:18:18:71:539:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:our sample value earmarking for emergency health savings (a first order concern to many
22:757:59389:18:35:71:311:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:households) more than for preventative health.
22:758:59435:35:17:71:540:333:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:B:DiscussionA possible concern with the heterogeneity analysisis that the various “traits”
22:759:59523:17:18:71:539:316:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we study (being a provider, present-biased or married) are not randomly assigned. These
22:760:59610:18:18:71:539:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:could be correlated with other characteristics. While we cannot entirely rule out that the het-
22:761:59705:18:18:71:539:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:erogeneous treatment effects we observe are due to some unobservable heterogeneity in other
22:762:59796:18:18:71:539:262:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:traits correlated with those we focus on, we take comfort in the fact that the heterogene-
22:763:59886:18:18:71:539:244:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ity in treatment effects along the three traits we had pre-specified matches the underlying
22:764:59977:18:55:71:336:226:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:theoretical framework presented in Section 2.3.23,24
22:765:60029:55:16:84:540:171:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:23The results are mostly robust to the inclusion of interactions between the experimental treatments
22:766:60129:16:12:72:540:155:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:and other observable characteristics such as income. Inclusion of these control interactions is problematic,
22:767:60237:12:8:72:255:143:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:however, since they are likely endogenous.
22:768:60279:8:16:84:540:135:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:24Appendix Table A4 tests how take-up of each savings technology varies along the three traits of interest.
22:769:60386:16:12:72:540:119:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:Those figures must be taken with caution since the sample size for each regression is small (and the standard
22:770:60495:12:12:72:540:107:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:errors are large), and our measures of take-up are only weak measures of actual usage (especially for the box
22:771:60604:12:12:72:540:95:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:groups, since we only know the balance that was in the box at follow-up and not the total amount saved).
22:772:60708:12:12:72:540:83:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:The results are nevertheless supportive of our other results. Providers saved more in the lockbox and in the
22:773:60816:12:0:72:387:71:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f7:F:Health Pot, and those exhibiting present-bias saved less in theSafe Box.
23:774:60890:0:30:72:253:708:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:6  Long-Run Results
23:775:60909:30:18:72:540:678:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The discussion to this point has focused on impacts in the year following the intervention.
23:776:61000:18:18:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Given the large impacts observed, an important question is whether respondents continued
23:777:61088:18:18:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:using these savings devices in the long run, and whether the devices we introduced spread
23:778:61177:18:18:72:212:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to non-treatment ROSCAs.
23:779:61201:18:18:89:539:606:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To answer these questions, we conducted a long-term follow-up in May 2011, almost
23:780:61282:18:18:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:three years (33 months) after the rollout of the savings devices in the treatment arms. We
23:781:61372:18:18:72:540:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:randomly selected a subset of 359 study participants, and successfully followed up with 310
23:782:61463:18:18:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of them (86 percent). In the interview, we updated information on the status of the ROSCAs
23:783:61553:18:18:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and on whether respondents were using the savings products. Perhaps most importantly,
23:784:61638:18:17:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the survey included a number of open-ended questions to better understand why people were
23:785:61727:17:18:72:540:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:using the various savings products and what they thought of them. In this section, we review
23:786:61819:18:39:72:295:481:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:the findings of that longer-term follow-up.25
23:787:61864:39:26:72:226:442:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:6.1  Long-Run Usage
23:788:61883:26:18:72:540:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The longer run take-up results are presented in Table 6. We combine the two box groups
23:789:61969:18:18:72:539:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(Safe BoxandLockbox) into one (calledBox), since the key was given to all lockbox holders
23:790:62058:18:18:72:540:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at either the 6- or the 12-month follow-up survey, thereby transforming theLockboxinto a
23:791:62146:18:18:72:120:362:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:B:Safe Box.
23:792:62155:18:18:89:539:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Usage of the boxes is still substantial after almost 3 years: 39% of people are still saving
23:793:62247:18:18:72:540:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in their box, and for those, the average amount of cash found in the box at the time of
23:794:62334:18:18:72:540:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the survey was above 700 Ksh. Most of the people still saving in their box reported saving
23:795:62424:18:17:72:540:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:towards a specific goal (83%). The majority of them have maintained at least one health
23:796:62511:17:18:72:540:273:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:goal (63%), but people often reported saving towards a multiplicity of goals, including for
23:797:62602:18:18:72:225:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their business, or schools fees.
23:798:62634:18:18:89:539:237:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In addition to observing the amount present in the box at the time of the survey, the
23:799:62719:18:18:72:540:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:enumerator asked respondents how much they had deposited in total over the past 33 months.
23:800:62809:18:18:72:540:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Since most people had not kept records of how much they had been using the box, we allowed
23:801:62899:18:18:72:540:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:people to answer qualitatively if they were unable to estimate: i.e. “a lot,” “a little,” etc.
23:802:62993:18:30:72:540:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Overall, 32% of people with a box could give a numerical answer about their total deposits.
23:803:63084:30:16:84:540:135:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:25We present evidence in Appendix Table A5 that the sample surveyed in the long-term followup is
23:804:63180:16:12:72:540:119:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:representative of the initial sample. As we focus on usage and take-up, the key question is whether those
23:805:63285:12:12:72:540:107:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:in the long-term followup were using the technologies similarly to the entire sample in earlier follow-ups.
23:806:63392:12:12:72:540:95:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:Reassuringly, we find that the patterns of take-up and usage of the four experimental saving technologies at
23:807:63500:12:12:72:540:83:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:the 12-month follow-up are statistically indistinguishable between those in the long-term followup and the
23:808:63606:12:0:72:133:71:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:entire sample.
24:809:63622:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:For these people, the average amount deposited is very high, at 3,369 Ksh. An additional
24:810:63710:18:18:72:225:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:21% report depositing “a lot.”
24:811:63740:18:18:89:539:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We find strong evidence of lasting impacts in the two other treatment groups as well: 48%
24:812:63829:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of people are still participating in theHealth Potand 53% in theHealth Savings Account. Of
24:813:63919:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:those still saving in anHSA, 73% had made a withdrawal, and the majority of withdrawals
24:814:64006:18:39:71:266:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:continue to be for health emergencies.
24:815:64044:39:26:71:171:579:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:6.2  Diffusion
24:816:64058:26:18:71:539:553:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The long-run usage results suggest that the program had a lasting effect on the savings
24:817:64145:18:18:71:539:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:behavior for many individuals. If these technologies are meeting an unmet demand for secure
24:818:64236:18:18:71:539:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:savings and are indeed beneficial for people, then it seems possible that the technologies
24:819:64326:18:17:71:255:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:diffused to non-treatment ROSCAs.
24:820:64359:17:18:89:539:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To test for the presence of such diffusion, in the long-run follow up we asked each ROSCA
24:821:64448:18:18:71:540:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:whether it had adopted aHealth PotorHSAscheme. The results are presented in Table
24:822:64529:18:18:72:540:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:7. We find evidence consistent with diffusion: at the 3-year follow-up, 11 percent of control
24:823:64622:18:18:72:540:428:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f8:B:group ROSCAs had adopted theHealth Potscheme, and 22 percent had adopted theHSA
24:824:64701:18:18:72:539:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f8:B:scheme. In other words, out of 18 ROSCAs in the control group, 2 adopted theHealth Pot
24:825:64787:18:18:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:scheme and 4 adopted theHSAscheme. Adoption of these schemes in theSafe Boxand
24:826:64865:18:18:72:539:374:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:B:Lockboxgroup was lower, with only one or two ROSCAs adopting these schemes. The lower
24:827:64950:18:18:72:540:356:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:adoption figures in the box groups is due in part to the fact that those ROSCAs in those
24:828:65038:18:18:72:540:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:groups were more likely to dissolve, as we will see in section 7.3. In any case, the results in
24:829:65133:18:18:72:539:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Table 7 suggest non-trivial adoption of theHealth PotandHSAsaving strategies in the study
24:830:65222:18:18:72:540:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:area. These adoption rates are unlikely to reflect a general trend among local ROSCAs that
24:831:65312:18:18:72:540:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:would have pre-existed our study, since the technologies we introduced simply did not exist
24:832:65403:18:17:72:540:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:beforehand. The diffusion we observe is therefore almost certainly due to the treatments we
24:833:65494:17:126:72:148:249:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:implemented.26
24:834:65508:126:16:84:540:123:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:26The ideal way to study diffusion would be to examine whether technologies diffused to ROSCAs which
24:835:65608:16:12:72:540:107:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:were geographically close or which had strong social ties to treatment ROSCAs. We are unable to do this,
24:836:65712:12:12:72:540:95:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:however, because we only interviewed a subsample of people in each ROSCA, and so do not have the full set
24:837:65817:12:11:72:540:83:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:of links between ROSCAs. We are similarly unable to exploit geographic location in that we do not have
24:838:65919:11:0:72:202:72:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:GIS coordinates for ROSCAs.

25:840:65961:35:25:72:243:673:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:7.1  Mental Accounting
25:841:65983:25:18:72:540:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Our most striking result is that getting access to a safe and designated storage technology
25:842:66074:18:18:72:540:630:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as simple as a safe box can have large and lasting impacts on health savings and investment
25:843:66165:18:18:72:539:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:behavior.  How is this possible?  All theSafe Boxprovided is some protection against
25:844:66249:18:18:71:539:594:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:theft, but in focus groups conducted before starting the study, theft did not seem to be
25:845:66337:18:18:71:540:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a primary concern for people. What then accounts for the large impact of theSafe Box?
25:846:66422:18:18:72:540:558:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This section presents evidence from open-ended survey questions that we administered to
25:847:66509:18:18:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:our study participants throughout the study period. All in all, the data strongly suggests
25:848:66599:18:18:72:540:522:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that the box served a sort of mental accounting purpose: once money was put into the box,
25:849:66688:18:18:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:it was mentally allocated towards savings, which made it easier to refuse requests or limit
25:850:66779:18:17:72:121:486:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spending.
25:851:66788:17:18:89:539:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:During the long-run follow-up, we asked respondents, in an open-ended way, why they
25:852:66871:18:18:72:540:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:felt that the box was helpful. We then coded their answers into 7 different categories. The
25:853:66962:18:18:72:540:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:results are presented in Panel A of Table 8. Thirty-three percent said it made it easier to
25:854:67053:18:18:72:540:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:save small change; 32% said that the box helped because the money in the box was not on
25:855:67140:18:18:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hand, or “out of sight”; and 19% said it helped them to reduce spending on luxury items (an
25:856:67231:18:18:72:540:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:example of such an item is ready-made food bought on the market, like chips). By contrast,
25:857:67321:18:18:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:only 6% said the box helped because it reduced theft, and only 2% said it was because the
25:858:67410:18:18:72:397:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:box was secure in a secret place that others didn’t know about.
25:859:67473:18:18:89:539:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Panel B of Table 8 presents answers to questions about obligations to share money with
25:860:67559:18:18:72:540:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:others. In the endline conducted after one year, we asked people how much they agreed with
25:861:67649:18:18:72:540:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the following statement: “If somebody comes to ask me for money and I have the money in
25:862:67736:18:18:72:540:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cash, I am obligated to give her something.” Respondents answered on a scale of 1 to 5 where
25:863:67828:18:18:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1 indicated that they “strongly agreed” and 5 was “strongly disagreed.” Thus a response
25:864:67915:18:17:72:540:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:less than 3 indicates agreement with the statement. Overall, respondents agree that there is
25:865:68007:17:18:72:540:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pressure to share: across the entire sample, the average response to this question was 2.35.
25:866:68099:18:18:72:540:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We then asked theSafe Boxgroup the same question, but this time for the case in which
25:867:68184:18:18:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the money was in the box. While the averageSafe Boxgroup had a similar response to the
25:868:68270:18:18:71:539:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cash question as the whole sample (their average was 2.70), they felt much less obligated to
25:869:68362:18:18:71:386:146:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:share when the money was in the box (the average was 4.30).
25:870:68421:18:18:89:539:128:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the longer-term follow-up, we asked a similar question to both box groups: “If some-
25:871:68508:18:18:71:539:110:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:body comes to ask for money, is it easier to say no if the money is in the box?” We asked
25:872:68597:18:18:71:539:92:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:about requests from a hypothetical person outside the household, as well as requests from
25:873:68686:18:0:71:539:74:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the spouse (for married respondents). Eighty-one percent of respondents reported that the
26:874:68777:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:box helps say no to people outside the household, and 43% reported that it helps say no to
26:875:68867:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the spouse (despite the fact that the vast majority of spouses knew about the box, as shown
26:876:68958:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in Tables 2 and 6). Thus, part of the explanation for why theSafe Boxhad such a large
26:877:69043:18:18:72:525:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:impact appears to be because it made it easier to say no to money requests from others.
26:878:69130:18:18:89:539:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The question then becomes: why does the box make it easier to say no? Why don’t people
26:879:69216:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:just open up the box to give people the money they ask for? In the long-run follow-up, we
26:880:69305:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:directly asked people why they thought it was easier to say no to requests for money. A
26:881:69392:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sizeable fraction (51%) report that this is because the money in the box is for a specific goal
26:882:69487:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(which we interpret to mean that the money in the box is mentally allocated to savings). Of
26:883:69578:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the remainder, 24% say that others don’t know about the box; 9% say it can’t be accessed
26:884:69666:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:immediately because it’s kept elsewhere; and 5% say that it’s not easily accessed because
26:885:69755:18:18:72:361:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:it’s hidden (the remainder report various other reasons).
26:886:69812:18:18:89:539:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:While this evidence seems quite compelling, another way to check whether this mental
26:887:69896:18:17:72:539:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:accounting effect is indeed the mechanism through which theSafe Boxmattered would be to
26:888:69983:17:18:72:539:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:look directly at expenditures, and test whether people in theSafe Boxgroup reduced spend-
26:889:70072:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ing on treats and transfers to friends/relatives. We cannot do this since we did not attempt to
26:890:70167:18:18:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:collect such outcomes. Collecting data with enough granularity to observe small decreases in
26:891:70259:18:18:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:daily spending would have been extremely difficult without detailed high-frequency surveys,
26:892:70350:18:39:72:255:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which were not feasible in this case.
26:893:70387:39:26:72:366:346:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:7.2  Ruling out Alternative Explanations
26:894:70427:26:18:72:540:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We can also use the answers observed in our qualitative survey questions to address some
26:895:70515:18:18:72:540:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:possible alternative explanations for our findings. One set of possible concerns is that the
26:896:70607:18:18:72:526:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:experimental treatments offered a fuller set of attributes than we have focused on so far.
26:897:70697:18:17:89:540:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In particular, one could question whether the largeSafe BoxandHSAeffects (and the
26:898:70778:17:18:72:540:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:high take-up of theLockbox, even if it did not translate into an impact on health investments
26:899:70871:18:18:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:within the study period) would have been observed if these saving technologies had been
26:900:70958:18:18:72:540:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:offered to individuals independently of the ROSCA structure. In other words, how much of
26:901:71046:18:18:72:540:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the effects come from the fact that the randomization was done at the ROSCA level, and the
26:902:71136:18:18:72:540:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:delivery of the boxes happened at a group meeting, where everyone could see others receive
26:903:71226:18:18:72:181:159:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a box and set a goal?
26:904:71247:18:18:89:539:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:There are four main channels through which this could matter. First, given that deposits
26:905:71335:18:18:72:539:123:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:onto theHSAwere typically made during regular ROSCA meetings, those meetings might
26:906:71417:18:18:71:540:105:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have acted as “reminders” to save in theHSA. Likewise, if people discussed their progress
26:907:71506:18:0:71:539:87:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with their box savings at ROSCA meetings, this could have had an independent effect. For
27:908:71596:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:example, Kast et al. (2011) find evidence that such self-help group meetings can increase
27:909:71685:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:saving rates through a reminder effect. While we cannot rule out this possibility, we want
27:910:71775:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to point out that those in the control group also had frequent ROSCA meetings that could
27:911:71863:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have acted as reminders to save for health. What’s more, the effects we observe are an order
27:912:71955:18:18:72:391:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of magnitude larger than those observed in Kast et al. (2011).
27:913:72017:18:18:89:539:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Second, given that deposits ontoHSAaccounts were made at ROSCA meetings, it may
27:914:72096:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be the case that people observed what others were doing (especially how much people were
27:915:72184:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:saving) and that this influenced behavior directly. For example, if some members of the
27:916:72271:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ROSCA are also part of one’s informal insurance network, people might be less willing to
27:917:72359:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:help others if they can see they are not saving enough on their own in theirHSA. To test for
27:918:72451:18:18:72:539:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this, we asked respondents in theHSAgroup whether they knew how much other ROSCA
27:919:72531:18:18:72:539:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:members were saving in theirHSA. We present the results in Panel C of Table 8. We find
27:920:72617:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that 23% knew how much every other ROSCA member was saving and 53% knew about
27:921:72694:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the savings of at least some of them. Only 14% reported that others’ behavior influence
27:922:72781:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their savings, however. This suggests that social pressure likely played a minor role in the
27:923:72873:18:18:72:198:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effectiveness of theHSA.
27:924:72897:18:18:89:539:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Third, one could be concerned that ROSCAs offer some features (such as insurance
27:925:72977:18:18:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:funds or credit) that could have interacted with our treatment effects. We do not find much
27:926:73068:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:heterogeneity in treatment impacts by baseline ROSCA characteristics, however (data not
27:927:73155:18:18:72:111:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shown).
27:928:73162:18:18:89:539:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, the fact that the experimental treatments were introduced in groups could matter
27:929:73251:18:18:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:if there are large complementarities in health behavior (for example, if the private returns to
27:930:73346:18:18:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investing in a given health product are low unless everyone else also invests in that product).
27:931:73441:18:18:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:None of the health products that were chosen seem to have that property, however. In fact, if
27:932:73534:18:18:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:anything, we would expect the opposite effect: many of the products chosen as goals generate
27:933:73626:18:18:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:positive health externalities, and thus free-riding should have been optimal. In other words,
27:934:73719:18:17:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:even if study participants knew about the social returns (which we do not think is the case,
27:935:73811:17:18:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:based on results in Dupas (2010)), this would bias our results downwards, as the private
27:936:73899:18:39:72:407:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:returns to a given product would be highest in the control group.
27:937:73964:39:26:72:452:167:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:7.3  Epilogue: Long-run Impacts on ROSCA survival
27:938:74013:26:18:72:540:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This last section examines how ROSCA participation was affected by the introduction of the
27:939:74103:18:18:72:539:123:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:individual saving technologies (theSafe BoxandLockbox). Understanding the motivation
27:940:74187:18:18:72:540:105:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to join a ROSCA has been the subject of a rich theoretical and empirical literature. Besley
27:941:74278:18:0:72:540:87:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:et al.  (1993) argue that ROSCAs enable individuals to acquire indivisible goods faster
28:942:74367:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:than through individual saving.  More recent papers have put the emphasis on ROSCAs
28:943:74450:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:offering a commitment function for individuals to overcome inconsistencies in preferences
28:944:74539:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:across household members (Anderson and Baland 2002) or across time periods (Gugerty
28:945:74622:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2007). In addition to the question of why they exist in the first place, the organization of
28:946:74714:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ROSCAs raises a second fundamental question: why don’t those people who get the pot
28:947:74797:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:early in the cycle quit the ROSCA? Besley et al. (1993) argue that in the absence of cheaper
28:948:74889:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:forms of credit, ROSCAs can exist if defaulters face the threat of being barred from entering
28:949:74982:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:any ROSCA in the future, and Anderson et al. (2009) show that this threat works better
28:950:75068:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in fixed-order roscas (such as those in our study sample) than in random-order roscas. In
28:951:75157:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:contrast, Basu (2008) shows that if ROSCAs are composed of people with quasi-hyperbolic
28:952:75244:18:18:72:449:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time preferences, ROSCAs can survive even if social sanctions are absent.
28:953:75317:18:18:89:539:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our experimental setting lends itself well to studying the question of why ROSCAs exist
28:954:75404:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and how they survive. Indeed, by randomizing access to individual saving strategies (the
28:955:75492:18:17:72:539:474:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:B:Safe Boxand theLockbox), we created exogenous variation in the “autarkic” option. By
28:956:75576:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:testing how these changes in the autarkic option affect ROSCA survival, we can test some
28:957:75664:18:18:72:344:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the explanations proposed in the earlier literature.
28:958:75719:18:18:89:539:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We collected data on ROSCA survival as part of the long-term follow-up. In Table 9, we
28:959:75805:18:18:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:regress the likelihood that the ROSCA has been discontinued on the various experimental
28:960:75892:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:treatment arms.  We find a very strong effect of the individual saving boxes on ROSCA
28:961:75977:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:exit: while the exit rate was only 6 percent over the 33-month study period among ROSCAs
28:962:76065:18:18:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:where no individual saving strategy was introduced, the exit rate was 23-29 percentage points
28:963:76158:18:18:72:391:331:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:higher among ROSCAs where saving boxes were distributed.27
28:964:76216:18:18:89:539:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:What do these results imply for our understanding of ROSCAs in the study context?
28:965:76297:18:18:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:While the box did not offer any form of strong commitment, it helped individuals to over-
28:966:76386:18:18:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:come both inter-personal and intra-personal saving barriers through a mental accounting
28:967:76473:18:18:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effect. This appears to have reduced the incentive to participate in ROSCAs and suggests
28:968:76561:18:17:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that, while the credit motive is an important reason to join ROSCAs (as evidenced by the
28:969:76649:17:18:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:very large effects of theHealth Poton savings for health), it does not fully explain ROSCA
28:970:76739:18:18:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:participation.  Our results also suggest that the form of commitment that ROSCAs of-
28:971:76823:18:18:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fer might be somewhat stronger than what the majority of individuals need. None of the
28:972:76909:18:18:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ROSCAs in our sample allocate the pot through a bidding process, so that savings are not
28:973:76997:18:18:72:540:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:available for emergencies.  In the absence of softer-commitment alternatives, people may
28:974:77085:18:23:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:choose to participate in ROSCAs even if the liquidity restriction is a major cost for them.
28:975:77176:23:16:84:540:111:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:27This data was collected after several cycles would have been completed, so the discontinuation of a
28:976:77277:16:12:72:540:95:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:ROSCA is not equivalent to the “collapse” of a group mid-cycle in which some people might lose money.
28:977:77378:12:11:72:540:83:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:Also note that if we perform the analysis at the individual member level, we find the exact same pattern of
28:978:77485:11:0:72:103:72:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:results.
29:979:77495:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:But when better individual saving strategies are introduced, the appeal of ROSCAs appears
29:980:77584:18:46:72:195:690:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:to somewhat diminish.28
29:981:77607:46:29:72:194:644:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:8  Conclusion
29:982:77620:29:18:72:540:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In both developed and developing countries, many people have difficulty saving as much as
29:983:77709:18:18:72:540:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:they would like. But while households in developed countries have access to many products
29:984:77798:18:18:72:540:579:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to help them surmount their saving difficulties (certificates of deposits, automatic transfers
29:985:77892:18:18:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to 401(k)s, HSAs, etc.), households in developing countries tend to rely on much more
29:986:77977:18:18:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:informal arrangements (Collins et al.  2009; Rutherford 2000).  This paper suggests that
29:987:78065:18:18:72:540:525:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:existing informal mechanisms in rural Kenya are insufficient – introducing a technology as
29:988:78155:18:18:72:540:507:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:basic as a simple box with a lock and key allows the average individual to substantially
29:989:78243:18:18:72:540:489:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increase her investment in preventative health and to reduce her household’s vulnerability
29:990:78333:18:18:72:540:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to health shocks. We present evidence that the mechanism through which this simple safe
29:991:78420:18:18:72:540:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:box enables savings is through a mental accounting purpose. The money put into the box
29:992:78506:18:18:72:540:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:was seen by respondents as “for savings” and was therefore less likely to be spent on luxuries
29:993:78600:18:17:72:540:417:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or given away to others. Usage of the box remained high for (at least) 33 months after it
29:994:78689:17:18:72:152:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:was introduced.
29:995:78704:18:18:89:539:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Such a simple technology is not valuable for everybody, however. In particular, mental
29:996:78790:18:18:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:accounting appears insufficient to enable individuals with present-biased preferences to save
29:997:78883:18:18:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more. For them, an individual commitment savings account or lockbox is not effective either,
29:998:78975:18:18:72:540:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:however. While present-biased people may realize the need to commit money to savings and
29:999:79063:18:18:72:540:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be interested in a commitment device, actually putting money into the lockbox itself requires
29:1000:79156:18:18:72:540:292:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an act of self-control, as discussed in Ashraf et al. (2006a) and Banerjee and Duflo (2011).
29:1001:79248:18:18:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Thus, in the same way that people in the US buy gym memberships but subsequently fail
29:1002:79333:18:18:72:540:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to exercise enough to amortize the cost (DellaVigna and Malmendier 2006), people who are
29:1003:79421:18:18:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:present-biased may sign up for a commitment savings account but never deposit a single
29:1004:79507:18:18:72:540:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:penny in it, unless they can precommit to a direct deposit (as in Thaler and Benartzi (2004)
29:1005:79599:18:18:72:540:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or Brune et al. (2011)) or unless they face social pressure. In our study, we find that present-
29:1006:79695:18:18:72:539:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:biased individuals enthusiastically accepted theLockbox, but failed to save much in it. In
29:1007:79785:18:17:72:540:166:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:contrast, the enthusiasm that led them to sign up for theHealth Pottied their hands not
29:1008:79872:17:18:72:540:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:only to spend the money a certain way, but also to continue to save on a regular basis (i.e., at
29:1009:79968:18:18:72:540:131:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:each ROSCA meeting). This strong social commitment feature is the only one that enabled
29:1010:80055:18:26:72:471:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:present-biased individuals in our sample to overcome their savings difficulties.
29:1011:80135:26:15:84:540:87:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:28Interestingly, the negative effect of the Box treatment on ROSCA survival is concentrated among
29:1012:80232:15:0:72:505:72:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:ROSCAS that do not offer loans to their members in addition to the regular pot (data not shown).
30:1013:80330:0:18:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our sample frame was restricted to those already participating in ROSCAs at baseline.
30:1014:80415:18:18:72:540:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:While this sampling strategy means that our sample is not fully representative of the pop-
30:1015:80505:18:18:72:540:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ulation of rural Kenya (since everybody in the sample had at least some ability to save to
30:1016:80595:18:18:72:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:start with), it is not too selected either since ROSCA participation is common in our area of
30:1017:80688:18:18:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:study, and ROSCA participation rates are even higher in other parts of sub-Saharan Africa
30:1018:80777:18:18:72:540:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(Anderson and Baland 2002). Another piece of evidence which suggests that our results are
30:1019:80866:18:18:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not specific to our sample is that they are generally consistent with previous research we
30:1020:80956:18:18:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:conducted in the same area of Kenya, in which we found that simple bank accounts had
30:1021:81040:18:18:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:substantial impacts on savings and investment levels for about 40 percent of women who run
30:1022:81130:18:18:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a small vending business, but were not used by the remaining 60 percent of women vendors,
30:1023:81219:18:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nor by men in the sample (mostly bicycle taxi drivers) (Dupas and Robinson 2009). Since
30:1024:81306:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the bank accounts did not provide any form of earmarking or a strong commitment feature,
30:1025:81394:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their primary function was likely to provide a designated place to save. The present study
30:1026:81484:18:17:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:suggests that more sophisticated devices that include stronger commitment features might
30:1027:81572:17:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be better suited for some of those individuals who did not use the simple savings account.
30:1028:81662:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:For others, it appears that a less sophisticated but more easily accessible device such as a
30:1029:81754:18:18:72:435:421:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:B:Safe Boxwould be better suited to save small sums on a regular basis.
30:1030:81823:18:18:89:539:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:A key outstanding question is what these individual savings products would do to existing
30:1031:81912:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:social structures such as informal insurance networks. We find evidence that getting access to
30:1032:82006:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a safe box reduced ROSCA participation over time. Potentially, access to such a technology
30:1033:82096:18:18:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:could cause people to exit insurance networks entirely (Ligon et al. 2000). The only empirical
30:1034:82190:18:18:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:evidence to date on this issue comes from a lab experiment implemented with real social
30:1035:82277:18:18:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:networks in India by Chandrasekhar et al. (2011), who find that access to individual saving
30:1036:82368:18:18:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:has only a small impact on informal risk sharing, and overall improves welfare as it allows
30:1037:82459:18:18:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:individuals to smooth consumption over risk that cannot be shared interpersonally. Future
30:1038:82548:18:0:72:393:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:research may usefully explore this issue outside the laboratory.

43:1543:104844:30:18:72:540:630:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:To study the determinants of ROSCA participation, we use data from an ongoing savings
43:1544:104929:18:18:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:project we are conducting with a random sample of households in Western Kenya (Dupas
43:1545:105013:18:18:72:540:594:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:et al. 2011). Unlike the current study, participants in that study were sampled from a census
43:1546:105106:18:18:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ofallhouseholds in three villages, and should therefore be representative of households in
43:1547:105196:18:17:72:540:558:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the area.  We collected background characteristics and ROSCA participation from every
43:1548:105281:17:18:72:540:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:respondent in that sample. In total, we have data on 2,580 adults in 1,693 households. We
43:1549:105370:18:18:72:540:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:present this data in Appendix Table A6, in which we regress ROSCA participation on several
43:1550:105460:18:18:72:211:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:background characteristics.
43:1551:105487:18:18:89:539:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In Column 1, we include standard demographic variables including gender, marital status,
43:1552:105575:18:18:72:540:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:age, and a measure of wealth (the value of animals owned).29Consistent with other studies,
43:1553:105665:18:18:72:540:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we find that women are much more likely to join ROSCAs than men (by close to 15 percentage
43:1554:105755:18:18:72:540:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:points, on an average participation rate of 41 percent), but marital status does not appear
43:1555:105846:18:18:72:540:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to be a driver. We also find that more educated and richer individuals are more likely to
43:1556:105935:18:18:72:332:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:join ROSCAs, and that older people are less likely.
43:1557:105986:18:18:89:539:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In Column 2, we include other controls, including measures of risk aversion and time
43:1558:106070:18:18:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:discounting identical to those presented in Table 1. We find that people who are more risk
43:1559:106160:18:18:72:540:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:loving are more likely to join. We find no evidence that patience or time inconsistency affect
43:1560:106254:18:18:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:participation.  These results suggest that present-bias may not be the primary driver of
43:1561:106342:18:45:72:294:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ROSCA participation in our study context.
43:1562:106383:45:30:72:256:262:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:A2. External Validity
43:1563:106404:30:17:72:540:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:To the extent that our sample is representative of 40% of the population, the impacts that
43:1564:106494:17:18:72:540:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we present in the paper are only applicable to these 40%. How would the four saving devices
43:1565:106585:18:18:72:540:197:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we introduced likely impact the rest of the population? We can only speculate on that point.
43:1566:106677:18:18:72:540:179:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The fundamental question is whether people who are not currently in ROSCAs have a lower
43:1567:106764:18:18:72:540:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or higher unmet demand for savings. If those people who do not participate in ROSCAs are
43:1568:106852:18:18:72:540:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:simply less interested in saving, then the impact of any of our technologies would of course
43:1569:106944:18:18:72:540:125:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be lower.  If, however, some people do not join ROSCAs for other reasons (for example,
43:1570:107030:18:32:72:540:107:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:because they do not have the time for regular meetings), then the impact could be higher
43:1571:107118:32:0:84:327:75:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:A:29We also include village fixed-effects in this regression.
44:1572:107179:0:18:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:since those not in ROSCAs have no less interest in saving but fewer options to save securely.
44:1573:107272:18:18:89:539:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f8:A:Even aside from this issue, the impact of the two ROSCA-level treatments (theHealth
44:1574:107355:18:18:71:540:672:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:B:potand theHealth Savings Account) would also likely differ for non-ROSCA participants.
44:1575:107441:18:18:71:539:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Since both these schemes require some level of trust in others (either the co-contributors to
44:1576:107534:18:18:71:539:636:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the health pot or the treasurer of the HSA), non-ROSCA participants might be less likely
44:1577:107622:18:18:71:539:618:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to take them up since they might not be able to identify a group they trust enough to start
44:1578:107713:18:18:71:539:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:either scheme. Potentially, these schemes could be run by a bank, but even banks are (often
44:1579:107804:18:45:71:404:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rightfully) viewed with suspicion in the area (Dupas et al. 2011).
44:1580:107870:45:27:71:539:537:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:F:A3.  Why Didn’t ROSCAs Start These Programs on
44:1581:107916:27:30:71:172:510:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:Their Own?
44:1582:107926:30:18:71:539:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The last important question is why, if these savings technologies had such big effects, in-
44:1583:108017:18:18:71:539:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dividuals did not come up with them on their own. After all, none of the technologies we
44:1584:108105:18:18:71:540:444:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:introduced required anything new. In fact, theHealth Potwas simply applying the concept
44:1585:108192:18:18:71:539:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the ROSCA specifically to health products. The idea of earmarking was not novel either,
44:1586:108282:18:18:71:539:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:since many ROSCAs use spending agreements for their main pot (Gugerty 2007). Our only
44:1587:108367:18:18:71:540:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f8:B:innovation was the focus on health. Likewise, ROSCAs could easily implement theHSA
44:1588:108449:18:18:71:539:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:scheme on their own. We provided those sampled for theHSAencouragement with a nice-
44:1589:108532:18:18:71:539:354:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:looking ledger to record deposits and withdrawals, but a cheap exercise book available at
44:1590:108621:18:17:71:539:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the local store could have served the same purpose. Finally, the boxes we offered were made
44:1591:108712:17:18:71:539:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by hand by a local artisan. They cost about $2 each, including the lock. People could make
44:1592:108802:18:18:71:539:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the box themselves and would only have to invest in a lock, at a cost of $1. In fact, in other
44:1593:108896:18:18:71:539:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parts of Africa, people make lockboxes that do not actually require a lock – they just have
44:1594:108987:18:18:71:539:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a narrow slit that allows deposits but not withdrawals (Shipton 1990). Why didn’t people
44:1595:109075:18:18:71:272:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in our study area do this on their own?
44:1596:109114:18:18:89:539:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We asked people this question directly (in an open ended way) in our long-term follow-up,
44:1597:109203:18:18:71:539:211:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and coded their answers. Results are presented in Appendix Table A7. For the box, only
44:1598:109289:18:18:71:539:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:3% of respondents reported that they were using a savings box already (typically made out
44:1599:109378:18:18:71:539:175:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of wood). Almost all other respondents answered that they had “never thought of it” (88%).
44:1600:109468:18:18:71:539:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Only 8% reported the problem was the expense. For theHealth Pot, 72% said they had
44:1601:109550:18:18:71:539:139:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:never thought of it. The remainder said that they had not thought of ROSCAs as something
44:1602:109638:18:18:71:539:121:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that could be used for health-specific savings (rather than for savings for other purposes).
44:1603:109730:18:18:71:539:103:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:For theHSA, the answers were similar: 77% reported that they had not thought of the idea
