2:15:357:24:14:120:507:454:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:Risk of sovereign debt default has frequently affected emerging market and de-
2:16:435:14:13:104:507:440:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:veloped economies. Such financial crisis are often accompanied with severe declines
2:17:518:13:14:104:507:427:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:of employment that are hard to justify using a standard dynamic stochastic model.
2:18:599:14:13:104:507:413:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:In this paper, I document that a labor wedge deteriorates substantially around swift
2:19:683:13:14:104:507:400:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:reversals of current accounts or default episodes. I propose and evaluate two different
2:20:770:14:13:104:507:386:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:explanations for these movements by linking the wedges to changes in labor taxes and
2:21:854:13:14:104:507:373:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:in the cost of working capital. By adding these two features in a dynamic model of
2:22:936:14:13:104:507:359:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:equilibrium default I am able to replicate the behavior of the labor wedge observed
2:23:1019:13:14:104:507:346:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:in the data around financial crisis. In the model, higher interest rates are propagated
2:24:1106:14:13:104:507:332:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:into larger costs of hiring labor through the presence of working capital. As an econ-
2:25:1192:13:14:104:507:319:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:omy is hit with a stream of bad productivity shocks, the incentives to default become
2:26:1277:14:14:104:507:305:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:stronger, thus increasing the cost of debt. This reduces firm demand for labor and
2:27:1359:14:13:104:507:291:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:generates a labor wedge. A similar effect is obtained with a counter-cyclical income
2:28:1443:13:14:104:507:278:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:tax rate policy. The model is used to shed light on the recent events of the Euro Area
2:29:1529:14:37:104:367:264:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f10:debt crisis and in particular of the Greek default event.

3:37:2081:0:30:75:205:695:17:g_d0_f15:17:g_d0_f15:1  Introduction
3:38:2096:30:18:92:536:665:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:Sovereign default crises are events usually associated with large economic costs.  In
3:39:2181:18:18:75:537:647:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:particular, countries that experience such events typically experience large drops in both
3:40:2271:18:18:75:537:629:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:output and employment. Mendoza and Yue (2012) notes, by looking at a set of emerging
3:41:2355:18:18:75:537:611:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:economies, that default events are associated with deep recessions where employment falls
3:42:2444:18:18:75:537:593:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:of average by about 15% lower compared with pre-crisis levels. More recently, the same
3:43:2530:18:18:75:537:575:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:kind of patterns have been observed in the advanced economies that were in the epicenter
3:44:2618:18:18:75:537:557:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:of the Euro Area sovereign debt crisis, namely Greece, Portugal, and Ireland. One natural
3:45:2707:18:18:75:537:539:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:question to ask is, therefore, if the observed fall in employment in these events is unusual at
3:46:2802:18:18:75:536:521:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:the light of standard economic theory (e.g.Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan, 2007) given an
3:47:2888:18:18:75:537:503:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:equally large fall in output. Showing evidence suggesting that the answer to this question is
3:48:2981:18:17:75:537:485:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:negative, this paper advances with an explanation where labor markets distortions arise as
3:49:3071:17:18:75:537:468:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:a consequence of limited access to credit markets by governments on the onset of a sovereign
3:50:3163:18:18:75:130:450:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:debt crisis.
3:51:3175:18:18:92:536:432:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:To motivated the claim that labor market distortions are increasing during episodes of
3:52:3261:18:18:75:537:414:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:sovereign default, the Euro Area sovereign debt crisis is used as a main source of empirical
3:53:3353:18:18:75:537:396:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:evidence. One main advantage of using this set of countries resides on the availability of
3:54:3443:18:18:75:537:378:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:high frequency data for series such as output, consumption, and employment. The data
3:55:3527:18:18:75:537:360:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:analysis suggests that European countries that were close or defaulted during the crisis
3:56:3615:18:18:75:537:342:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:are also the ones where the long-term, otherwise, statistically stable correlation between
3:57:3705:18:18:75:537:324:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:employment/output growth - traditionally coined as Okum’s law (Okun, 1962) - breaks
3:58:3788:18:18:75:537:306:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:down on the aftermath of the crisis. Additionally, using the Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan,
3:59:3877:18:18:75:537:288:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:2007 accounting methodology, it is shown that measured labor wedges, often associated
3:60:3962:18:18:75:537:270:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:with distortions, deteriorated much faster for countries that were more severely affected
3:61:4051:18:18:75:537:252:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:by the debt crisis. When regressed against a set of controls, worse labor wedges wedges
3:62:4138:18:17:75:537:234:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:are statistically associated with higher government interest rate spreads thus suggesting
3:63:4227:17:18:75:537:217:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:a channel over which adverse government credit conditions spillover into labor market
3:64:4312:18:18:75:132:199:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:distortions.
3:65:4324:18:18:92:536:181:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:These empirical observations are rationalized with a dynamic stochastic model of de-
3:66:4408:18:18:75:537:163:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:fault with endogenous labor supply. As standard in sovereign default models of the Eaton
3:67:4496:18:18:75:537:145:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:and Gersovitz (1981) type, the government has limited commitment in honoring its debt
3:68:4581:18:18:75:537:127:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:contracts, implying that interest rates on borrowing include a premium over the risk-free
3:69:4670:18:18:75:537:109:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:rate demanded by international investors to compensate for the risk of default. Because the
3:70:4761:18:0:75:537:91:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:government is assumed to be impatient and debt is non-contingent, the interest rate spread
4:71:4852:0:18:75:537:695:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:displays a counter-cyclical as the debt burden become more onerous to the government
4:72:4936:18:18:75:537:677:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:when the economy is in recession with a consequent fall in revenue. Given these interest
4:73:5024:18:18:75:537:659:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:rate spread dynamics, a financial crisis is associated with sharp tightness of credit market
4:74:5116:18:18:75:537:641:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:access triggered by a sequence of negative productivity shocks. To link these financial crises
4:75:5210:18:18:75:537:623:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:with the labor market, the model adds two additional features. First, the government only
4:76:5299:18:18:75:537:605:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:has access to distortionary taxation and debt to finance public consumption.  This im-
4:77:5385:18:18:75:537:587:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:plies that distortionary taxes have to be raised when access to credit markets becomes
4:78:5471:18:18:75:537:569:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:constrained thus distorting the household labor supply decision. Second, the model also
4:79:5558:18:18:75:537:551:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:assumes that firms are required to keep working capital to finance their salary payments.
4:80:5647:18:18:75:537:533:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:Additional, and in line with the literature (Neumeyer and Perri, 2005; Uribe and Yue, 2006;
4:81:5738:18:18:75:537:515:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:Arellano and Kocherlakota, 2014), it is assumed that high government interest rates spill
4:82:5827:18:18:75:537:497:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:over to high corporate interest rates. This creates an additional source of distortions on
4:83:5917:18:18:75:537:479:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:labor markets from the demand end.  In summary, both the distortionary taxation and
4:84:6000:18:17:75:537:461:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:working capital requirements work as frictions that distort labor markets when the gov-
4:85:6087:17:18:75:537:444:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:ernment is close to default. As a result the fall in employment is larger that what would
4:86:6176:18:18:75:537:426:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:been without these frictions. Under this framework, default entails costs in terms of loss
4:87:6266:18:18:75:537:408:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:productivity and financial market access. On the reserve side, repudiating debt can release
4:88:6357:18:18:75:537:390:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:resources to both public and private consumption. At the same time, more resources also
4:89:6444:18:18:75:537:372:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:relaxes the fiscal constraint and allows the government to stop tax increases.  In every
4:90:6532:18:18:75:536:354:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:period the government evaluates the costs and benefits of defaulting and acts accordingly.
4:91:6622:18:18:92:536:336:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:A simulated version of this model is computed to match the economy of Greece. Several
4:92:6707:18:18:75:537:318:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:features of the Greek business cycle moments are captured in the model.  In particular
4:93:6793:18:18:75:537:300:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:the model generates counter-cyclical interest spreads or tax rates, a characteristic usually
4:94:6885:18:18:75:537:282:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:associated to emerging market economies (Cuadra et al., 2010; Vegh and Vuletin, 2012). In
4:95:6974:18:18:75:537:264:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:this paper, counter-cyclical tax rates arise due to imperfect credit market access. It is also
4:96:7068:18:18:75:537:246:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:due to these dynamics of interest and tax rates that explain the main results of the simu-
4:97:7158:18:18:75:537:228:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:lation: on the path to default employment falls substantially and is followed by increased
4:98:7248:18:17:75:537:210:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:distortions in the labor markets. The model accounts for a 13% decline of employment
4:99:7332:17:18:75:537:193:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:from 3 years before default (against an observation of 17% for Greece) from which 4pp is
4:100:7420:18:18:75:533:175:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:accounted by distortionary taxes and an additional 4pp from working capital constraints.
4:101:7508:18:18:92:536:157:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:This paper is builds on the literature on endogenous default risk. Eaton and Gersovitz
4:102:7594:18:18:75:537:139:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:(1981), Aguiar and Gopinath (2006), or Arellano (2008) developed sovereign default models
4:103:7683:18:18:75:537:121:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:where the probability of default is increasing when debt is high or income low. However,
4:104:7771:18:18:75:537:103:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:these papers assume that the government is able to transfer resources to households in a
4:105:7859:18:0:75:537:85:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:non-distortionary fashion, thus abstract from fiscal constraints. In Cuadra et al. (2010), a
5:106:7952:0:18:75:537:695:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:similar model of sovereign default extended to include endogenous labor and distortionary
5:107:8041:18:18:75:537:677:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:consumption and conclude that under imperfect credit access tax rates become counter-
5:108:8126:18:18:75:537:659:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:cyclical. Arellano and Bai (2013) use a similar paper to obtain the result that exogenously
5:109:8217:18:18:75:537:641:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:raising labor taxes may be self-defeating in the sense that the impact of distortions may
5:110:8306:18:18:75:537:623:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:reduce the revenue base used by the government to repay debt. Despite these important
5:111:8391:18:18:75:537:605:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:conclusions, neither paper attempt to quantitatively account for the labor market implica-
5:112:8481:18:18:75:242:587:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:tions of a pro-cyclical tax policy.
5:113:8516:18:18:92:536:569:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:Also related is the literature that uses interest rate shocks as a main source of fluc-
5:114:8603:18:18:75:537:551:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:tuations in emerging economies. Neumeyer and Perri (2005) and Uribe and Yue (2006)
5:115:8685:18:18:75:537:533:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:present models where firms require working capital to pay salaries in advance financed

5:117:8858:18:18:75:537:497:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:An important setback of these models relies on the fact that interest rates are completely
5:118:8948:18:18:75:537:479:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:exogenous and, for that reason, disconnected from the level of government indebtedness.
5:119:9035:18:17:75:537:461:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:Using a model of sovereign default, Mendoza and Yue (2012), assume that some imported
5:120:9120:17:18:75:537:444:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:inputs require working capital financing, thus providing a channel over which endogenous
5:121:9208:18:18:75:537:426:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:interest rate fluctuations affect firms decisions. However, this paper also abstracts from
5:122:9298:18:18:75:537:408:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:fiscal constraints and the model cannot generate a fall in labor at defaults as seen in the
5:123:9389:18:18:75:101:390:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:data.
5:124:9394:18:18:92:536:372:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:Finally, the literature that uses the accounteing methodology developed by Chari, Ke-
5:125:9479:18:18:75:537:354:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:hoe, and McGrattan (2007) to study labor market distortions as measured by labor wedges.
5:126:9567:18:18:75:537:336:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:For example, Karabarbounis (2014), using a set of developed and emerging economies points
5:127:9656:18:18:75:537:318:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:out the the labor wedge is in general pro-cyclical, that is, it deteriorates when output is
5:128:9747:18:18:75:537:300:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:in recession, while Ohanian et al. (2007) regress labor wedges against a set of regressors
5:129:9837:18:18:75:537:282:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:and conclude that labor taxes affect negatively this wedge. Neither of these authors relates
5:130:9929:18:18:75:537:264:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:their wedges with financial crisis. An exception comes from Pratap and Quintin (2011)
5:131:10014:18:18:75:537:246:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:that associate distortions in labor markets to increases in interest rates and tax rates in the
5:132:10109:18:18:75:537:228:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:Mexican crisis of 1994, however, in their model, interest are exogenously determined and
5:133:10197:18:17:75:169:210:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:taxes play no role.
5:134:10216:17:18:92:536:193:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:The rest of this paper is organized in the following way. Section 2 presents empirical
5:135:10302:18:18:75:537:175:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:evidence on labor market distortions arising from the Euro Area debt crisis; section 3
5:136:10388:18:18:75:537:157:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:presents a model that rationalizes such evidence; section 4 calibrates the model for the
5:137:10476:18:18:75:537:139:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:Greek economy and run some robustness checks; and section 5 concludes. The appendix A
5:138:10561:18:0:75:495:121:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:presents some additional evidence and describes the computational methods used.
6:139:10641:0:30:75:260:695:17:g_d0_f15:17:g_d0_f15:2  Empirical Evidence
6:140:10662:30:18:92:536:665:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:The EZ crisis starting in 2008 is marked by a large heterogeneity in the macroeconomic
6:141:10748:18:18:75:537:647:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:responses within each country. Table 1 shows the length and depth of the recession for
6:142:10834:18:18:75:536:629:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:the different countries composing the European monetary union at the beginning of 20081.
6:143:10922:18:18:75:537:611:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:It is quite evident that some countries experienced large and prolonged recessions while
6:144:11010:18:18:75:537:593:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:others did not. For the case of Greece, the recession is even comparable to the US great
6:145:11098:18:18:75:537:575:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:depression with a length of more that 6 years followed by a 27% fall in output and an 20pp
6:146:11188:18:18:75:537:557:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:increase in unemployment (as in figure 1). With the exception of Italy and Slovenia where
6:147:11277:18:18:75:537:539:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:labor markets stayed more contained, this was also the pattern observed for the other
6:148:11362:18:18:75:537:521:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:countries that experienced prolonged recessions.  Given that Greece, Portugal, Ireland,
6:149:11449:18:18:75:537:503:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:Spain all received financial assistance from official creditors, a natural question to ask is if
6:150:11545:18:34:75:431:485:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:that recession, apart from its length depth, had any unusual features.

6:165:12207:25:12:75:537:225:10:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f14:Notes: Data source: OECD. Output and consumption are OECD volume estimates. As in Harding and
6:166:12300:12:12:75:537:213:10:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f14:Pagan (2002), peak and trough turning points are determined using the following methodology: (1) output
6:167:12403:12:12:75:536:201:10:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f8:is measured in logs at quarterly frequency; (2) peaks are selected whenyt= max{yt−2,yt−1,yt,yt+1,yt+2}
6:168:12505:12:12:75:536:189:10:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f14:and troughs whenyt= min{yt−2,yt−1,yt,yt+1,yt+2}; (3) censoring rules apply where peaks and troughs
6:169:12603:12:31:75:465:177:10:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f14:have to alternate and the minimum phase is 2 quarters with a 5 quarters minimum cycle.
6:170:12689:31:18:92:536:146:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:A simple way to analyze this question is look for deviations of the historical relation-
6:171:12777:18:28:75:537:128:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:ship between employment and output change. Figure 1 shows very clearly how output is
6:172:12861:28:15:91:537:100:7:g_d0_f24:10:g_d0_f14:1Luxembourg has a population of 0.5 millions and because of such small size it is not included in this
6:173:12963:15:0:75:112:85:10:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f14:analysis.
7:174:12973:0:18:75:537:695:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:negatively correlated with unemployment, a well identified relationship known as Okun’s
7:175:13060:18:18:75:536:677:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:law. Recent studies2indicate that such relationship has been kept strong and stable for
7:176:13147:18:18:75:537:659:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:most countries, even after including the 2008 Great Recession. Typical analysis point that
7:177:13237:18:18:75:537:641:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:different linear slopes characterizing the relationship employment/output in different coun-
7:178:13329:18:18:75:537:623:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:tries are due to different labor market frictions or market structures.  However, if such
7:179:13418:18:18:75:537:605:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:environments are invariable during the business cycles, then the slope of the relationship
7:180:13508:18:18:75:537:587:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:absorbs such institutional features. In this sense, systematic deviations of that long-term
7:181:13599:18:33:75:311:569:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:relationship can be indicative of a breakdown.

9:387:17684:31:18:92:536:277:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:A different approach to inspect labor market conditions makes use of the accounting
9:388:17767:18:18:75:537:259:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:methodology developed by Chari et al. (2007).  This derives a wedge that reflects the
9:389:17852:18:18:75:537:241:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:difference of what is observed in the data and the prediction of a neoclassical growth
9:390:17938:18:18:75:537:223:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:model in some key variables. The difference measured in the wedge accounts for unknown
9:391:18024:18:18:75:537:205:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:factors that are unaccounted by a frictionless standard economic model. Specifically, the
9:392:18113:18:33:75:440:187:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:methodology presents a labor market equilibrium equation of the form:

10:414:18738:33:18:75:457:502:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:where a variable with an hat represents a log deviation from steady state4.
10:415:18813:18:18:92:536:484:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:Figure 3 measures the cyclical component of these labor wedges for a subset of countries
10:416:18901:18:18:75:537:466:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:in the EZ for a particular choice of the parameter values5. Both measures indicate that
10:417:18988:18:18:75:537:448:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:countries in the EZ were differently affected by the recession. One can easily see that the
10:418:19079:18:18:75:537:430:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:wedges deteriorated substantially for countries such as Greece, Portugal, or Ireland, while
10:419:19170:18:17:75:537:412:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:were very stable for Germany, Finland, or Austria. This observation seem to suggest that
10:420:19258:17:18:75:537:395:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:the severity of the financial crisis may be responsible for the adverse behavior in labor
10:421:19347:18:18:75:537:377:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:markets. To better understand what is driving the labor wedge, the following panel data
10:422:19434:18:33:75:462:359:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:regression is estimated for every quartertand every countryifrom the EZ:

10:426:19714:18:18:75:537:257:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:of the financial crisis. Table 3 shows the results. Across specifications and for both wedge
10:427:19806:18:18:75:537:239:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:measures, the results are consistent at showing that the labor wedge is negatively correlated
10:428:19899:18:17:75:537:221:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:with both the interest rate spread and the output gap. The last result is consistent with
10:429:19988:17:18:75:537:204:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:previous studies (Karabarbounis, 2014) and simply states that the labor wedge is coun-
10:430:20074:18:18:75:537:186:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:tercyclical. The results also show a negative correlation between the labor wedge and the
10:431:20163:18:32:75:537:168:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:domestic financial conditions as captured by the interest rate spread. These, suggest that

11:509:21335:18:45:75:465:259:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:with the sharp increase in interest rate motivated by a sovereign debt crisis.
11:510:21413:45:30:75:234:214:17:g_d0_f15:17:g_d0_f15:3  Model Economy
11:511:21429:30:18:92:536:184:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:The previous section suggests that labor markets and credit access are closely related.
11:512:21516:18:18:75:537:166:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:Here, a typical sovereign default model is presented to account for that relationship. The
11:513:21606:18:17:75:537:148:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:model economy is one based on Eaton and Gersovitz (1981) where a sovereign government
11:514:21691:17:18:75:537:131:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:borrows or saves from international markets in order to maximize consumers utility. Be-
11:515:21778:18:18:75:537:113:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:cause the government cannot commit to honor its debts contracts, international investors
11:516:21866:18:0:75:537:95:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:demand an interest rate premium over the risk free rate to account a default probability.

12:529:22466:34:18:75:537:476:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:The main departure from the model of Eaton and Gersovitz (1981) resides on the labor
12:530:22550:18:18:75:537:458:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:market. On one hand consumers supply labor based on the income tax rate determined by
12:531:22635:18:17:75:537:440:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:the government. On the other hand, firms demand labor under a working capital constrain.
12:532:22723:17:18:75:537:423:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:The first feature links labor supply to credit conditions as a debt constrained government,

12:534:22902:18:18:75:537:387:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:cisions. As for the second feature, under the assumption that higher government interest
12:535:22990:18:18:75:537:369:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:rates spillover to corporate higher interest rates, then, due to the working capital constrain,
12:536:23085:18:18:75:537:351:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:harsher credit conditions affects firms inducing them to hire less labor. The details of this
12:537:23178:18:39:75:301:333:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:model are outlined in the following sections.

12:548:23597:18:0:75:218:104:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:following budget constraint:
13:549:23627:0:26:230:536:677:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f12:ct= (1−τt)·(wtht+πt+et)(3)

13:553:23907:18:25:75:126:597:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:condition:

13:556:23943:0:35:312:536:564:12:g_d0_f19:12:g_d0_f12:= (1−τt)wt(4)
13:557:23956:35:18:75:537:529:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:That is, marginal rate of substitution of hours to consumption equals the wage rate net
13:558:24043:18:18:75:537:511:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:of taxes. Equation (4) together with (3) characterize simultaneously this household labor
13:559:24132:18:18:75:537:493:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:supply and demand for consumption goods. Similar optimality conditions were used within
13:560:24219:18:18:75:537:475:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:the framework of sovereign default models, for example, in Cuadra, Sanchez, and Sapriza
13:561:24306:18:18:75:537:457:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:(2010) and Arellano and Bai (2013). Implicitly in this environment is the restriction that
13:562:24396:18:39:75:365:439:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:the household cannot directly access external borrowing.

13:566:24632:18:18:75:537:339:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:ditions - is also subjected to a multiplicative stochastic productivity shockztthat follows a
13:567:24725:18:18:75:537:321:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:Markov process. As in Neumeyer and Perri (2005) or Uribe and Yue (2006), profits equal
13:568:24811:18:18:75:537:303:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:the difference between revenues and costs that include both the wage bill and working
13:569:24896:18:18:75:537:285:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:capital costs. This means that in order to pay wages to workers, firms need to set aside a
13:570:24986:18:18:75:536:267:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:fractionθ∈[0,1]of the wage bill immediately after the beginning of the period in order to
13:571:25075:18:18:75:537:249:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:pay workers before the end of the the same period. However, because production is only
13:572:25161:18:18:75:537:231:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:available at the end of the period, firms need to borrow an amount equal toθwthtfrom
13:573:25245:18:18:75:537:213:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:households at a gross interest rate ofRt≥16. As such, at the end of timet, profits are
13:574:25331:18:18:75:121:195:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:given by:
13:575:25340:18:26:209:536:177:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f12:πt=ztf(ht)−wtht−(Rt−1)·θwtht(5)
13:576:25371:26:39:92:536:151:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:It follows that profit maximization implies the following equation that characterizes
13:577:25456:39:16:91:537:112:7:g_d0_f24:10:g_d0_f14:6A different way to interpret working capital requirements is that, due to some friction in the technology
13:578:25562:16:11:75:536:96:10:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f14:for transferring resources, workers demand a fractionθof the wage payment before production takes place.
13:579:25666:11:0:75:291:85:10:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f14:For that reason, firms need to borrow in advance.

14:588:25765:29:18:75:537:648:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:Note that the wage rate is equated to the product of the marginal product of labor and a
14:589:25853:18:18:75:537:630:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:term bounded between 0 and 1. It follows that, from the firm’s perspective, an increase in
14:590:25943:18:39:75:415:612:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:its cost of financing is equivalent to a negative productivity shock.

18:745:32000:18:18:75:537:495:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:over other agents are specified. Given these beliefs, each agent must choose actions that are
18:746:32093:18:17:75:537:477:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:the best responses to the strategies of the other agents. The government and international
18:747:32183:17:28:75:319:460:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:investors only use stationary Markov strategies.
18:748:32231:28:28:75:329:432:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f12:Definition 1.A recursive equilibrium is a set of:

18:751:32335:28:28:75:125:348:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:Such that
18:752:32344:28:18:75:537:320:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:a) Given the debt price functionq(D′,z), the value functionv(D,z)solves the government

18:756:32565:28:17:92:536:228:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:Condition (a) requires that the government’s default and borrowing decisions are opti-
18:757:32651:17:18:75:537:211:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:mal given the debt price schedule. Condition (b) requires the equilibrium debt prices that
18:758:32741:18:18:75:537:193:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:determine country risk premia to be consistent with optimal lender behavior. Moreover,

19:766:33374:18:39:75:322:629:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:that way, different functional forms are selected.
19:767:33424:39:26:75:231:590:14:g_d0_f32:14:g_d0_f32:4.1  Functional Forms
19:768:33445:26:18:92:536:564:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:The household utility function is a GHH after Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Huffman

19:771:33706:18:17:75:537:510:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:tion has the advantage of shutting down the wealth effect on labor supply, therefore shocks
19:772:33797:17:18:75:537:493:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:in the productivity process have an output response of the same signal. This is of particular
19:773:33890:18:18:75:537:475:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:relevance for the presence exercise that focus on labor response to a sovereign default crisis.
19:774:33985:18:18:75:536:457:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:For example, with a common CRRA utility function10, a strong negative income shock
19:775:34067:18:18:75:537:439:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:would generate a counter-factual increase in labor supply due to strong wealth effects. For
19:776:34158:18:38:75:337:421:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:that reason, instead, the following function is used:

19:797:34500:18:18:75:537:225:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:(2012). These authors showed that an increasing loss function in productivity is impor-
19:798:34587:18:18:75:536:207:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:tant to generate realistic default frequencies11. Such loss function enables some additional
19:799:34679:18:18:75:537:189:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:contingency to the government by penalizing (disproportionally) less severely if a default

19:801:34855:18:17:75:418:153:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:(2012) endogenizes this loss function using a model of trade credit.

19:805:35133:8:0:87:496:88:7:g_d0_f24:10:g_d0_f14:11This is in contrast with a proportional one as, for example, in Aguiar and Gopinath (2006).

20:807:35320:18:18:75:537:677:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:matching the behavior of spreads in the data. Because the focus of this paper is on labor
20:808:35409:18:18:75:537:659:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:market distortions, a reduced-form approach to this feature is used. The functional form

20:815:35630:18:18:75:537:579:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:recovery schedule as the one derived endogenously in Yue (2010) where, after default, the

20:825:36102:18:18:75:537:424:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:are equal. Here, the same assumption is made with the difference that there is a maximum
20:826:36190:18:18:75:537:406:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:cap on the interest rate charged by firms equal to ̄R. The reason for the imposition of that
20:827:36282:18:18:75:537:388:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:limit resides with the fact that sovereign debt interest rate becomes undefined under default.

20:831:36641:18:18:75:537:316:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:and sovereign interest rates. Also, in the appendix A.1, evidence for Euro Area countries
20:832:36730:18:18:75:537:298:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:is provided where, using the interest rates for new loans to non-financial corporations as a
20:833:36822:18:18:75:537:280:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:proxy of corporate interest rates, it is showed that this correlation can be as large as 0.83
20:834:36915:18:18:75:189:262:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:for the case of Greece.

20:840:37247:31:16:87:537:112:7:g_d0_f24:10:g_d0_f14:12Because in Yue (2010), the level of defaulted debt is irrelevant for negotiation (to the extent that the
20:841:37353:16:11:75:537:96:10:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f14:recovery rate is less than 100%), the recovery rate function is hyperbolic. A similar feature is displayed by

21:844:37535:26:18:92:536:669:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:The model is computed at a quarterly frequency targeting the Greek economy for some
21:845:37618:18:18:75:537:651:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:key data moments. As already mentioned, Greece provides a recent example of the dramatic
21:846:37706:18:18:75:537:633:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:impact of of a financial crisis on labor markets. Greece announced its default in the last
21:847:37796:18:18:75:537:615:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:quarter of 2011 and, between 2009 and 2012, the unemployment rate jumped from 7.96% to
21:848:37882:18:18:75:537:597:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:22.1%, a 14.2pp increase while, during the same period, real GDP fell by 16.3%. Mendoza
21:849:37969:18:18:75:537:579:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:and Yue (2012) shows that these observations are not uncommon for previous default
21:850:38051:18:18:75:537:561:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:episodes on emerging economies.  High frequency data readily available for provides an
21:851:38137:18:18:75:352:543:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:additional advantage of focusing this study to Greece.
21:852:38191:18:17:92:536:525:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:With the numerical solution at hand, the model is then used to interpret the macroeco-

21:854:38365:18:18:75:537:490:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:labor, while other features of simulated economy closed with other features of the observed
21:855:38456:18:18:75:537:472:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:data. Observed data for output, consumption, employment, and trade balance are season-
21:856:38542:18:18:75:537:454:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:ally adjusted quarterly real series obtained from OECD from 1990 to 2015. Government
21:857:38626:18:18:75:537:436:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:debt is taken from the EUROSTAT. The tax series, also taken from the EUROSTAT, refers
21:858:38711:18:18:75:537:418:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:the annual average income tax of a single person with no children and 100% of the average
21:859:38800:18:18:75:537:400:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:income received by a worker in Greece. Output and consumption are in logs while trade
21:860:38885:18:18:75:537:382:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:balance is presented as a percentage of GDP. All series are filtered using a Hodrick–Prescott
21:861:38978:18:18:75:532:364:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:filter with a 1600 smooth parameter with the exception of the tax series that uses a 6.25.
21:862:39068:18:18:92:536:346:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:The fixed parameters used in the calibration can be found in table 4. The risk aversion
21:863:39155:18:18:75:536:328:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:on consumptionσ= 5is adopted from Neumeyer and Perri (2005). The Frisch elasticity
21:864:39237:18:18:75:536:310:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:of1/γ= 2is higher than some used in the literature however is not uncommon to see even
21:865:39323:18:18:75:537:292:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:larger values be some authors13. In the framework, a large Frisch elasticity enables to model
21:866:39416:18:17:75:537:274:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:to generate a strong response of labor supply to shocks affecting the marginal product
21:867:39502:17:18:75:536:257:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:of labor14.  The labor income share is taken directly from averaging one of AMECO’s
21:868:39585:18:18:75:537:239:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:adjusted wage share series.  Parameterζ=  0.2implies an average market exclusion of
21:869:39668:18:18:75:537:221:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:5 periods which coupled with the quarter of exclusion totals 6 quarters and is consistent
21:870:39757:18:18:75:537:203:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:with evidence presented in Gelos, Sahay, and Sandleris (2011) finding that resumption have
21:871:39847:18:18:75:537:185:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:become faster in recent decades. Given that evidence is scarce on the importance of working
21:872:39938:18:18:75:537:167:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:capital, previous values used in the literature are used for guidance on the determination
21:873:40028:18:25:75:536:149:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:ofθ. Because Neumeyer and Perri (2005) uses a value of 1 and Mendoza and Yue (2012)
21:874:40111:25:16:87:537:124:7:g_d0_f24:10:g_d0_f14:13Shimer (2009), uses a Frisch elasticity of 4 in his model in order to justify some large labor movements
21:875:40217:16:8:75:199:108:10:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f14:in some European countries.
21:876:40244:8:15:87:537:100:7:g_d0_f24:10:g_d0_f14:14Note that with a Frisch elasticity of 0, changes in the marginal product of labor would imply no change

22:908:41709:52:18:92:536:104:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:Some comments are in order. First the, the choice for this moments attempts to bring
22:909:41793:18:0:75:537:86:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:some discipline to the model in the sense that the simulated economy resembles Greece.
23:910:41881:0:18:75:537:695:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:Second, some targeted moments try to capture the Greek default event, namely the 50%
23:911:41965:18:18:75:537:677:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:recovery rate offered to Greek bondholder and the fall in employment15. Third, the esti-
23:912:42053:18:18:75:536:659:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:mated parameter of the firms interest rate when the government is in default, ̄R= 1.0572,
23:913:42142:18:18:75:537:641:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:implying a annualized interest rate of 25%, looks a bit high but, for example, evidence from
23:914:42234:18:18:75:537:623:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:the 2002 Argentinean default indicates that such values are not unreasonable as average
23:915:42321:18:18:75:537:605:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:lending rate and the average deposit rate increased to above 50% (Arellano and Kocher-
23:916:42407:18:18:75:537:587:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:lakota, 2014). Finally, as can be seen in the top panel of table 6, the simulated moments
23:917:42496:18:18:75:537:569:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:are in quite close to the data targets although the difference is not exactly zero. In par-
23:918:42587:18:18:75:537:551:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:ticular, the average fall in employment is 13% when in the data is 1.5.  The reason for
23:919:42674:18:18:75:537:533:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:this gap is related with the fact that the model constrains the simulated series in certain
23:920:42765:18:18:75:537:515:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:directions, making it impossible to perfectly match the data moments even in an exactly
23:921:42852:18:18:75:537:497:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:identified estimation, that is, one where the number of parameters is equal to the number
23:922:42941:18:18:75:137:479:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:of moments.
23:923:42952:18:17:92:536:461:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:Table 6 presents the simulation results for both targeted and non-targeted moments.
23:924:43035:17:18:75:537:444:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:Within the targeted moments, it should be underline that the model is able to generate a
23:925:43123:18:18:75:537:426:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:fall in employment of the same magnitude as observed in the data. Moreover, the model
23:926:43208:18:18:75:537:408:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:maintain most of the discipline imposed by the targeted moments. Regarding non-target
23:927:43293:18:18:75:537:390:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:moments, a large degree of proximity with the observed data is also achieved along the
23:928:43379:18:18:75:537:372:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:typical moments that are usually studied in the literature.  In particular, volatility of
23:929:43468:18:18:75:537:354:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:consumption is larger than output and both spreads and trade balance are negatively
23:930:43551:18:18:75:537:336:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:correlated with output. Given the focus of the model on other features, such as employment
23:931:43641:18:18:75:537:318:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:and taxes, moments regarding these dimension, usually not analyzed in previous literature,
23:932:43731:18:18:75:537:300:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:can also be computed. The results shows that, at least qualitatively, the model mimics
23:933:43817:18:18:75:537:282:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:well the data observations. In particular, tax rates are counter-cyclical and also negatively
23:934:43910:18:18:75:537:264:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:associated with employment. The default rate is in line with other studies of sovereign
23:935:43997:18:18:75:537:246:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:default, with a non-targeted annual frequency of 3.1%.  The main discrepancy in this
23:936:44081:18:18:75:537:228:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:calibration is related with the average debt to output where the model generates 21% while
23:937:44171:18:17:75:537:210:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:in the data shows that Greece has a level of government debt of more that 100% of output.

23:939:44343:18:18:75:537:175:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:financial autarky is not a harsh punishment enough to sustain large amounts of debt in
23:940:44429:18:33:75:522:157:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:equilibrium, so the results from the simulation are not inconsistent with those findings.

23:943:44724:12:11:75:537:96:10:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f14:60% and Mendoza and Yue (2012) present evidence showing that, on average, employment is 15% lower

24:967:46032:54:18:92:536:245:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:These results indicate that austerity policies, that is, tax policies that tend to aggravate
24:968:46124:18:18:75:537:227:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:output fluctuations, are a consequence rather than an active policy of governments. When
24:969:46212:18:18:75:537:209:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:an economy is hit by a recession, harder credit conditions forces a government to increase
24:970:46302:18:17:75:537:191:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:tax rates under an impossibility of reducing public consumption.  Such increases affect
24:971:46389:17:18:75:537:174:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:negatively consumers that respond by lowering their market supply of labor. At the same
24:972:46476:18:18:75:537:156:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:time, because firms are also exposed to similar credit conditions as the government, lower
24:973:46566:18:18:75:537:138:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:their labor demand when faced with higher interest rates. Both these adverse effects on
24:974:46653:18:18:75:537:120:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:consumers and firms would not be present under an alternative economy without working

25:976:46827:0:18:75:537:695:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:Thus, such movements in hours can be interpreted as a labor wedge that falls when the
25:977:46912:18:18:75:537:677:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:economy is in recession. Under a default event, all the effects previous described become
25:978:47001:18:39:75:177:659:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:further pronounced.

25:982:47238:18:18:75:537:558:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:as well as the default set. New debt is a increasing function of current debt and produc-
25:983:47327:18:18:75:537:540:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:tivity; the debt price schedule is downward sloping in current debt, and increasing with
25:984:47415:18:18:75:537:522:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:productivity. This reflect the fact that indebted governments have higher probability of
25:985:47503:18:18:75:537:504:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:default, and this probability is smaller when the economy is growing (as depicted in the

26:1082:48647:0:0:465:490:305:7:g_d0_f39:7:g_d0_f39:i spread
27:1083:48657:0:18:92:536:695:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:One first observation is that, although productivity falls by 1%, output falls by about
27:1084:48744:18:18:75:537:677:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:4%. This happens due to an endogenous response of labor that retraces by about 6%. The
27:1085:48830:18:18:75:537:659:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:figure also shows that, in response to the fall in productivity, the government decides to
27:1086:48920:18:18:75:537:641:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:increase the tax rate from 19% to 22%. Additionally, on impact, the interest rate spread
27:1087:49008:18:18:75:537:623:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:increases substantially and that is due to the fact that, given the current debt level, the
27:1088:49099:18:18:75:537:605:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:government is less able to repay in the future. Due to this, the government quickly reduces
27:1089:49190:18:18:75:537:587:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:its debt exposure which, on its turn, implies that interest rates normalize quickly after.
27:1090:49280:18:18:75:537:569:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:It follows that labor demand increases as interest rate are part of firms hiring costs, and
27:1091:49371:18:18:75:537:551:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:this improves also the economies output, expanding the taxation base which allows the
27:1092:49456:18:18:75:537:533:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:government to reduce tax rates. Thus, this chain of events shows how a productivity shock
27:1093:49545:18:18:75:220:515:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:impacts the model economy.

27:1127:50267:18:18:75:537:216:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:fall in the labor wedge, 4% can be accounted due to an increase in the income tax while
27:1128:50354:18:17:75:537:198:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:1% is due to an increase of interest rates through working capital constraints. One can
27:1129:50441:17:18:75:537:181:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:conclude that both channels play an important role to explain the magnitude of the labor

28:1144:50763:25:18:92:536:410:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:To evaluate the performance of the model, the Greek recent crisis is used as an event
28:1145:50848:18:18:75:537:392:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:analysis. That is, the Greek GDP path between 2006-2012 is used to feed the simulated
28:1146:50933:18:18:75:536:374:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:model using a sequence of productivity shocks{zt}. In this sense, the GDP path of the
28:1147:51018:18:18:75:537:356:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:model is matched to what is observed in the data and the remaining variables series, not
28:1148:51106:18:18:75:514:338:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:targeted directly, can be evaluated. The result of this exercise can be seen in figure 7.
28:1149:51195:18:18:92:536:320:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:The figure plots, for both data and model, time series for GDP, hours16, the interest

28:1151:51370:18:112:75:515:284:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:on the 4th quarter of 2010, one year earlier from what happened in the Greek crisis18.
28:1152:51456:112:16:87:537:172:7:g_d0_f24:10:g_d0_f14:16Due to data limitations, Greek employment is being used in this panel and any fluctuations in average
28:1153:51559:16:8:75:205:156:10:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f14:hours is not being considered.
28:1154:51589:8:16:87:537:148:7:g_d0_f24:10:g_d0_f14:17The tax series is taken from the EUROSTAT and refers the annual average income tax of a single

28:1157:51871:8:16:87:537:112:7:g_d0_f24:10:g_d0_f14:18It should be noted however that before the its default event, Greece negotiated a bailout rescue loan
28:1158:51974:16:11:75:537:96:10:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f14:with the IMF and the European Union institutions in the 2nd quarter of 2010. Without such loan it is
28:1159:52074:11:0:75:390:85:10:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f14:uncertain if the government would be able to honor its debt obligations.

29:1209:52506:7:0:471:490:184:7:g_d0_f41:7:g_d0_f41:model
30:1210:52513:0:18:92:536:695:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:The top panel of the figure shows that the model can capture well the evolution of GDP
30:1211:52599:18:18:75:537:677:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:during the Greek crisis with the exception of the periods after the default is triggered in
30:1212:52690:18:18:75:537:659:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:the model when GDP becomes constant. This is because of the output loss function (20)
30:1213:52775:18:18:75:537:641:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:that is used. With this function, when a default occurs, productivity is kept constant at
30:1214:52864:18:18:75:537:623:12:g_d0_f19:12:g_d0_f12:ˆzand for that reason the model economy looks static until redemption occurs. That is
30:1215:52949:18:18:75:537:605:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:also why employment, the interest rate spread, and the tax rate are constant in the model
30:1216:53038:18:18:75:537:587:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:after 2010. The second panel in the figure shows that the employment time series path
30:1217:53123:18:18:75:537:569:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:of the model captures the same dynamics that are observed in the data.  The last two
30:1218:53207:18:18:75:537:551:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:panels shows the main drivers of these dynamics. Both the interest rate spread and the
30:1219:53293:18:18:75:537:533:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:tax rate are increasing in the model as well in the data. In the government the government
30:1220:53383:18:18:75:537:515:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:needs to raise taxes to finance an inelastic public expenditure thus affecting the household
30:1221:53475:18:18:75:537:497:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:supply of labor. At the same time, the prevalence of negative productivity shocks affects
30:1222:53564:18:18:75:537:479:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:the sovereign ability to fulfill its debt obligations, implying that interest rates continue to
30:1223:53659:18:17:75:537:461:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:increase and that, in turn, affects firms given their working capital requirements. These
30:1224:53748:17:18:75:537:444:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:movements combined add pressure on labor markets that subsequently collapse at default
30:1225:53834:18:18:75:396:426:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:with a 12% fall in hours when compared with pre-crisis values.
30:1226:53896:18:18:92:536:408:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:As mentioned before, both the effects of the interest rate spread and taxes affect neg-
30:1227:53983:18:18:75:537:390:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:atively the labour market. It should be noted that such impact is on top of an already
30:1228:54069:18:18:75:537:372:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:adverse path of successive negative productivity shocks.  Contrary to a situation where
30:1229:54156:18:18:75:537:354:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:with full access to credit markets a government facing a recession would lower distortionary
30:1230:54248:18:18:75:537:336:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:taxes (Lucas and Stokey, 1983), taxes rates are countercyclical in this model. Limited com-
30:1231:54339:18:18:75:537:318:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:mitment in debt contracts implies that the interest rate is increasing when the economy is
30:1232:54429:18:18:75:537:300:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:in recession. Because credit markets become more restricted the government is forced to
30:1233:54516:18:18:75:537:282:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:raise taxes. This provides a channel between the possibility of government default and labor
30:1234:54608:18:18:75:537:264:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:market distortions induced by countercyclical tax and interest rates as shown in the bottom
30:1235:54699:18:18:75:537:246:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:panels of figure 7. Using the measure of labor market distortion introduced in equations
30:1236:54787:18:18:75:537:228:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:(21) and (22), figure 8 plots the labor wedge that this event analysis produces. As should
30:1237:54877:18:17:75:537:210:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:be clear, the labor wedge is decreasing - implying stronger labor market distortions - as the
30:1238:54970:17:0:75:521:193:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:Greek economy moves into default, consistent with the evidence presented in section 2.

31:1252:55238:26:17:92:536:418:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:In order to isolate the non-standard features of the baseline model outline before, this

31:1254:55419:18:28:75:512:383:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:of the model are computed under the same calibration summarized in tables 4 and 5:

31:1263:56034:18:32:104:505:203:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:new consumer budget constrain, the counterparts of (14) and (15) simplify to:

33:1338:58319:18:18:104:537:521:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:with respect to the baseline model resides in equation (24) that simply states that

33:1342:58589:18:18:75:537:439:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:the baseline model. The results highlight the relevance of two channels introduced in this
33:1343:58679:18:17:75:537:421:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:paper to explain the large fluctuations of employment during default events. In particular,
33:1344:58770:17:18:75:537:404:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:when the sovereign has access to lump sum taxes, in the column “Lump sum”, the fall of
33:1345:58856:18:18:75:537:386:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:employment during a default is reduced by 4pp to 9%, substantially lower than what is
33:1346:58941:18:18:75:537:368:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:observed in the data. This happens since, under such environment, the government is not
33:1347:59028:18:18:75:537:350:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:pushed into raising income taxes when the economy is in recession. For that reason, part
33:1348:59116:18:18:75:537:332:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:of the tax distortions that increase the instability in labor markets disappear and, as a
33:1349:59205:18:18:75:537:314:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:consequence, the correlation between hours and the interest rate spread lowers as well as
33:1350:59294:18:18:75:537:296:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:the output volatility. When on top of lump sum policies, working capital requirements are

33:1352:59466:18:18:75:537:260:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:5%. These effects highlight importance of the two transmission mechanism of labor market

34:1376:60371:53:18:92:536:231:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:The column “External” shows that, when the working capital channel is not internalized
34:1377:60457:18:18:75:537:213:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:by government, the volatility of the interest rate increases. Without such awareness, the
34:1378:60546:18:17:75:537:195:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:labor becomes more negatively correlated with interest rate and default becomes more
34:1379:60630:17:18:75:537:178:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:frequent22.  Given the magnitude of these effects, it seems reasonable to think that a
34:1380:60716:18:18:75:537:160:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:government takes into consideration that its own borrowing decision should affects firms
34:1381:60804:18:18:75:537:142:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:credit conditions, contrary to previous papers that use working capital requirements to
34:1382:60891:18:18:75:537:124:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:generate a channel between interest rates and labor demand (Neumeyer and Perri, 2005;
34:1383:60976:18:18:75:188:106:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:Uribe and Yue, 2006).
34:1384:60997:18:0:87:316:88:7:g_d0_f24:10:g_d0_f14:22A similar result is found in Kim and Zhang (2012)
35:1385:61050:0:18:92:536:695:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:Finally, in the last column of table 7, government consumption is endogeneized to allow
35:1386:61137:18:18:75:537:677:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:for the fact that government consumption usually falls during default episodes (Cuadra
35:1387:61223:18:18:75:537:659:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:et al., 2010). Qualitatively, this alternative model behaves similarly to the baseline model.
35:1388:61316:18:18:75:537:641:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:However, a few important quantitative differences should be noted. First the correlation
35:1389:61404:18:18:75:537:623:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:of the tax rate with output falls to levels more close to what is observed with the data.
35:1390:61493:18:18:75:537:605:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:This happens because, as productivity falls, both private and public consumption follow,
35:1391:61581:18:18:75:537:587:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:implying that income taxes don’t need to be raised as faster. However, this also implies that
35:1392:61674:18:18:75:537:569:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:the cost of a default becomes less severe than in the baseline model and this increases the
35:1393:61765:18:18:75:537:551:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:default frequency. Given that the model preforms better in some dimensions while worse
35:1394:61851:18:18:75:537:533:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:in others, a more flexible, but also more complex approach may be necessary to properly
35:1395:61938:18:45:75:165:515:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:match the data23.

35:1397:61968:30:18:92:536:440:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:New evidence that supporting the idea that financial crises, arriving in the form of
35:1398:62052:18:17:75:537:422:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:sovereign default, generate distortions in labor markets can be seen in the recent Euro
35:1399:62139:17:18:75:537:405:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:Area debt crisis, where countries most affected, such as Greece, Portugal, or Ireland, were
35:1400:62230:18:18:75:537:387:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:also the same where employment suffered the most dramatic reduction from pre-crisis lev-
35:1401:62318:18:18:75:537:369:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:els. Because standard economic theory is unable to account reasonably for these drops in
35:1402:62406:18:18:75:537:351:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:employment, an alternative explanation relies on un-modeled market distortions. Using a
35:1403:62493:18:18:75:537:333:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:standard labor wedge decomposition to quantify distortions, it was shown that these are
35:1404:62580:18:18:75:537:315:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:positively correlated with government interest rate spreads. Increasing government interest
35:1405:62671:18:18:75:537:297:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:rates, are in fact indicative that credit is less available. For that reason, governments need
35:1406:62765:18:18:75:537:279:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:to rely more on taxation, often distortionary, to finance public expenditures. At the same
35:1407:62855:18:18:75:537:261:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:time, a close link between government and corporate interest rates provides an additional
35:1408:62944:18:18:75:537:243:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:source of through which distortions may affect labor markets when firms are required to
35:1409:63031:18:18:75:206:225:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:maintain working capital.
35:1410:63056:18:18:92:536:207:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:This paper studied the extent to which these two channels can account for labor dy-
35:1411:63139:18:18:75:537:189:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:namics in countries affected by sovereign debt risk using a simple but realistic economic
35:1412:63228:18:17:75:537:171:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:model that highlights in a transparent and intuitive fashion the economic relationship of
35:1413:63317:17:18:75:537:154:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:these dynamics. An otherwise standard sovereign default model is augmented to include
35:1414:63402:18:18:75:537:136:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:distortionary income taxation and firm’s working capital requirements. Calibrated to match
35:1415:63492:18:18:75:537:118:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:several data moments from Greece, the model is able to deliver simulated moments that are
35:1416:63581:18:15:87:537:100:7:g_d0_f24:10:g_d0_f14:23A potential source of additional costs of default may be related with political uncertainty that such
35:1417:63684:15:0:75:410:85:10:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f14:events produce as in, for example, Hatchondo, Martinez, and Sapriza (2009).
36:1418:63761:0:18:75:537:695:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:close to the observations from the data. In particular, the model generates an endogenous
36:1419:63850:18:18:75:537:677:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:increase in tax and interest rates when productivity falls, thus implying a deterioration
36:1420:63939:18:18:75:537:659:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:of the labor wedge. The model can account for an average 13% fall in employment with
36:1421:64023:18:18:75:537:641:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:respect to pre-crisis levels at a default event, a fall comparable to what is observed in the
36:1422:64116:18:18:75:537:623:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:data. From these 13%, 4pp can be associated with the an increase of the tax rate, and an
36:1423:64204:18:18:75:537:605:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:additional 4pp due to a spill-over of high interest rates from the government to corporations.
36:1424:64298:18:18:75:537:587:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:It can be concluded that these channels provide an important quantitative explanation for
36:1425:64387:18:18:75:364:569:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:the labor market dynamics that precede a default event.
36:1426:64442:18:18:92:536:551:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:Because the model was purposely design to be simple, several dimensions were over-
36:1427:64524:18:18:75:537:533:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:looked that can also be important, in particular international trade.  As underlined by
36:1428:64611:18:18:75:537:515:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:Gorodnichenko, Mendoza, and Tesar (2012), a sudden change in import conditions, for
36:1429:64694:18:18:75:537:497:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:example through terms of trade shocks, can impose an important adjustment cost to firms
36:1430:64781:18:18:75:537:479:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:that can be protracted. Relating sovereign debt crises with firm’s international trade condi-
36:1431:64874:18:17:75:537:461:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:tions can be a source improvement of the explanations provided in this paper, especially if
36:1432:64965:17:18:75:537:444:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:there are strong complementarities between imported goods and labor in firm’s production
36:1433:65053:18:0:75:390:426:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f12:function. These ideas should be integrated in future research.
