2:22:838:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:This paper provides a model of the interaction between risk-management practices and market liquidity.
2:23:940:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:On one hand, tighter risk management reduces the maximum position an institution can take, thus
2:24:1035:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:the amount of liquidity it can offer to the market. On the other hand, risk managers can take into account
2:25:1141:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:that lower liquidity amplifies the effective risk of a position by lengthening the time it takes to sell
2:26:1245:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:it. The main result of the paper is that a feedback effect can arise: tighter risk management reduces
2:27:1346:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:liquidity, which in turn leads to tighter risk management, etc. This can help explain sudden drops in
2:28:1447:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:liquidity and, since liquidity is priced, in prices in connection with increased volatility or decreased
2:29:1551:14:28:72:176:490:12:Times:12:Times:risk-bearing capacity.

3:47:1920:60:28:89:539:567:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This paper provides a model of the interaction between risk-management practices and
3:48:2004:28:29:72:540:539:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:market liquidity. Our main finding is that a feedback effect can arise: tighter risk manage-
3:49:2096:29:29:72:512:510:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ment leads to market illiquidity, and this illiquidity further tightens risk management.
3:50:2184:29:29:89:540:481:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Risk management plays a central role in institutional investors’ allocation of capital to
3:51:2273:29:29:72:539:452:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:trading.  For instance, a risk manager may limit a trading desk’sone-day 99% value at
3:52:2358:29:29:72:540:423:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:risk (VaR) to $1 million. This means that the trading desk must choose a position such
3:53:2444:29:29:72:539:394:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that, over the following day, its value drops no more than $1 million with 99% probability.
3:54:2535:29:29:72:540:365:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Risk management thus helps control an institution’s use of capital while limiting default
3:55:2624:29:29:72:540:336:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:risk, and helps mitigate agency problems. Jorion (2000, page xxiii) states that VaR “is now
3:56:2715:29:28:72:540:307:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:increasingly used to allocate capital across traders, business units, products, and even to the
3:57:2810:28:29:72:168:279:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:whole institution.”
3:58:2829:29:29:89:539:250:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We do not focus on the benefits of risk management within an institution adopting such
3:59:2915:29:29:72:540:221:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:controls, but, rather, on the aggregate effects of such practices on liquidity and asset prices.
3:60:3011:29:29:72:539:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:An institution may benefit from tightening its risk management and restricting its security
3:61:3102:29:29:72:540:163:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:position, but as a consequence it cannot provide as much liquidity to others. We show that,
3:62:3193:29:29:72:539:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:if everyone uses a tight risk management, then market liquidity is lowered in that it takes
3:63:3284:29:0:72:540:105:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:longer to find a buyer with unused risk-bearing capacity, and, since liquidity is priced, prices
4:64:3381:0:29:71:90:711:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fall.
4:65:3386:29:29:89:552:682:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Not only does risk management affect liquidity, but liquidity can also affect risk-management
4:66:3479:29:29:71:540:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:practices. For instance, Bank for International Settlements(2001, page 15) states that “For
4:67:3570:29:29:71:539:624:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the internal risk management, a number of institutions are exploring the use of liquidity
4:68:3659:29:29:71:540:595:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:adjusted-VaR, in which the holding periods in the risk assessment are adjusted to account
4:69:3748:29:29:71:540:566:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for market liquidity, in particular by the length of time required to unwind positions.” For
4:70:3840:29:29:71:539:537:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:instance, if liquidation is expected to take two days, a two-day VaR might be used instead
4:71:3930:29:28:71:539:508:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of a one-day VaR. Since a security’s risk over two days is greater than over one day, this
4:72:4020:28:29:71:539:480:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:means that a trader must choose a smaller position to satisfy his liquidity-adjusted value at
4:73:4113:29:29:71:539:451:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:risk (LVaR) constraint. One motivation for this constraint is that, if an institution needs to
4:74:4207:29:29:71:479:422:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sell, its maximum loss before the completion of the sale is limited by the LVaR.
4:75:4287:29:29:89:539:393:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The main result of the paper is that subjecting traders to an LVaR gives rise to a multiplier
4:76:4380:29:29:71:539:364:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:effect: tighter risk management leads to more restricted positions, hence longer expected
4:77:4469:29:29:71:539:335:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:selling times, implying higher risk over the expected selling period, which further tightens
4:78:4561:29:29:71:540:306:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the risk management, and so on.  This snowballing feedback between liquidity and risk
4:79:4646:29:29:71:539:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:management can help explain why liquidity can suddenly drop.We show that this spiraling
4:80:4733:29:28:71:539:248:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:illiquidity can arise if volatility rises, or if more agents face reduced risk-bearing capacity —
4:81:4830:28:29:71:476:220:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for instance, because of investor redemptions, losses, or increasedrisk aversion.
4:82:4911:29:29:89:539:191:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Our link between liquidity and risk management is a testable prediction. While no formal
4:83:4999:29:29:71:539:162:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:empirical evidence is available, to our knowledge, our prediction is consistent with anecdotal
4:84:5093:29:29:71:539:133:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:evidence on financial market crises. For example, in August 1998 several traders lost money
4:85:5184:29:0:71:539:104:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:due to a default of Russian bonds and, simultaneously, market volatility increased. As a
5:86:5273:0:29:71:539:711:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:result, the (L)VaR of many investment banks and other institutions increased. To bring risk
5:87:5364:29:29:71:540:682:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:back in line, many investment banks reportedly asked traders to reduce positions, leading
5:88:5453:29:29:71:539:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to falling prices and lower liquidity. These market moves exacerbated the risk-management
5:89:5542:29:29:71:447:624:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:problems, fueling the crisis in a similar manner to the one modelled here.
5:90:5616:29:29:89:539:595:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We capture these effects by extending the search model for financial securities of Duffie,
5:91:5706:29:29:72:539:566:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Gˆarleanu, and Pedersen (2005, 2007) (DGP). This framework of time-consuming search is
5:92:5792:29:29:72:539:537:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:well suited for modeling liquidity-based risk management as itprovides a natural framework
5:93:5882:29:28:72:540:508:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for studying endogenous selling times. While DGP relied on exogenous position limits, we
5:94:5970:28:29:72:540:480:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:endogenize positions based on a risk-management constraint, and consider both a simple
5:95:6056:29:29:72:539:451:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and a liquidity-adjusted VaR. Hence, we solve the fixed-point problem of jointly calculating
5:96:6148:29:29:72:540:422:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:endogenous positions given the risk-management constraint and computing the equilibrium
5:97:6235:29:29:72:539:393:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(L)VaR given the endogenous positions that determine sellingtimes and price volatility.
5:98:6322:29:29:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Weill (2007) considers another extension of DGP in which marketmaker liquidity provision
5:99:6410:29:29:72:540:335:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is limited by capital constraints. Our multiplier effect is similar to that of Brunnermeier and
5:100:6505:29:29:72:539:306:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Pedersen (2006) who show that liquidity and traders’ margin requirements can be mutually
5:101:6593:29:62:72:130:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reinforcing.
5:102:6605:62:40:71:154:215:17:g_d0_f3:17:g_d0_f3:1  Model
5:103:6613:40:29:71:540:175:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The economy has two securities: a “liquid” security with risk-free returnr(i.e. a “money-
5:104:6702:29:29:72:540:146:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:market account”), and a risky illiquid security. The risky security has a dividend-rate process
5:105:6797:29:0:72:539:117:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f2:Xand a priceP(X), which is determined in equilibrium. The dividend rate is L ́evy with
6:106:6884:0:29:71:540:711:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:finite variance. It has a constant drift normalized to zero, Et(X(t+T)−X(t)) = 0, and a
6:107:6971:29:53:72:182:682:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:volatilityσX>0, i.e.,
6:108:6992:53:53:72:386:629:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:(1)Vart(X(t+T)−X(t)) =σ2XT.
6:109:7019:53:29:72:457:576:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Examples include Brownian motions, Poisson processes, and sums of these.
6:110:7091:29:29:89:539:547:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The economy is populated by a continuum of agents who are risk neutral and infinitely
6:111:7176:29:29:71:539:518:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:lived, have a time-preference rate equal to the risk-free interest rater >0, and must keep
6:112:7266:29:28:71:539:489:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:their wealth bounded from below. Each agent is characterized by an intrinsic typei∈{h, l},
6:113:7356:28:29:71:540:461:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:which is a Markov chain, independent across agents, and switching froml(“low”) toh

6:116:7615:29:53:71:213:374:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:risk-management constraint
6:117:7641:53:53:71:396:321:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:(2)vart(θt[P(Xt+τ)−P(Xt)])≤(σi)2,

6:119:7762:29:28:71:540:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:capacity of the low-type agents can be interpreted as a need for more stable earnings, hedging
6:120:7856:28:29:71:539:211:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reasons to reduce a position, high financing costs, or a need for cash (e.g., an asset manager
6:121:7950:29:29:71:241:182:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f7:whose investors redeem capital).1
6:122:7983:29:18:89:539:153:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We use this constraint as a parsimonious way of capturing risk constraints, such as the

7:126:8309:29:29:71:539:682:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:are robust in that they only rely on two natural properties of the measure of risk: the risk
7:127:8401:29:29:71:538:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:measure increases with the size of the security position and the length of the time periodτ
7:128:8492:29:29:71:539:624:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:over which the risk is assessed. While the constraint is not endogenized in the model, we

7:130:8670:29:29:71:297:566:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:risk, and the need to allocate scarce capital.
7:131:8716:29:29:89:540:537:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We consider two types of risk management: (a) “simple risk management,” in which the
7:132:8800:29:28:72:539:508:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:variance of the position in (2) is computed over a fixed time horizonτ, and (b) “liquidity-
7:133:8891:28:29:72:539:480:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:adjusted risk management,” in which the variance is computed over the time required for
7:134:8978:29:29:72:530:451:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:selling the asset to an unconstrained buyer, which will be a random equilibrium quantity.
7:135:9067:29:29:89:539:422:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Because agents are risk neutral and we are interested in a steady-state equilibrium, we
7:136:9154:29:29:72:540:393:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:restrict attention to equilibria in which, at any given time and state of the world, an agent
7:137:9247:29:29:72:539:364:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:holds either 0 or ̄θunits of the asset, where ̄θis the largest position that satisfies (2) with
7:138:9342:29:29:72:539:335:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f2:σi=  ̄σ, taking the prices and search times as given.3Hence, the set of agent types is
7:139:9428:29:29:71:540:306:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f2:T={ho, hn, lo, ln}, with the letters “h” and “l” designating the agent’s current intrinsic
7:140:9518:29:29:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:risk-bearing state as high or low, respectively, and with “o” or “n” indicating whether the
7:141:9609:29:18:72:540:248:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:agent currently owns ̄θshares or none, respectively. We letμζ(t) denote the fraction at time
7:142:9701:18:16:85:540:230:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:2A VaR constraint stipulates thatP r(−θ[P(Xt+τ)−P(Xt)]≥V aR)≤πfor some risk limit VaR and
7:143:9790:16:12:72:539:214:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:some  confidence  levelπ.   IfXis  a  Brownian  motion,  this  is  the  same  as  (2).   We  note  that  rather  than
7:144:9907:12:13:72:539:202:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:considering  only  price  risk,  we  could  alternatively  consider  the  risk  of  the  gains  process  (i.e.,  including
7:145:10029:13:0:72:280:189:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:dividend risk)Gt,τ=P(X(t+τ))−P(X(t)) +
7:146:10067:0:12:283:302:197:10:g_d0_f13:7:g_d0_f12:∫t+τ
7:147:10071:12:8:287:540:185:7:g_d0_f12:10:g_d0_f10:tX(s)ds.  This yields qualitatively similar results (and
7:148:10127:8:12:72:540:177:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:quantitatively  similar  for  many  reasonable  parameters  since  dividend  riskis  orders  of  magnitude  smaller
7:149:10242:12:9:72:252:165:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:than price risk over a small time period).
7:150:10284:9:15:85:539:156:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:3Note that the existence of such an equilibrium requires that the risk limit  ̄σbe not too small relative to
7:151:10392:15:0:72:333:141:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:the total supply Θ, a condition that we assume throughout.
8:152:10451:0:53:71:476:711:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f2:tof agents of typeζ∈T. These fractions add up to 1 and markets must clear:
8:153:10525:53:32:236:86:658:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:1  =μho+μhn+μlo+μln(3)
8:154:10547:32:53:233:86:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Θ  = ̄θ(μho+μlo),(4)
8:155:10567:53:29:71:350:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:where Θ>0 is the total supply of shares per investor.
8:156:10620:29:29:89:540:544:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Central to our analysis is the notion that the risky security is not perfectly liquid, in the
8:157:10713:29:28:72:539:515:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sense that an agent can only trade it when she finds a counterparty. Every agent finds a
8:158:10801:28:29:72:540:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:potential counterparty, selected randomly from the set of allagents, with intensityλ, where
8:159:10892:29:29:71:540:458:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f2:λ≥0 is an exogenous parameter characterizing the market liquidity for the asset. Hence,
8:160:10979:29:29:71:539:429:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the intensity of finding a type-ζinvestor isλμζ, that is, the search intensity multiplied by
8:161:11071:29:29:71:540:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the fraction of investors of that type. When two agents meet, they bargain over the price,
8:162:11161:29:29:71:325:371:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with the seller having bargaining powerq∈[0,1].
8:163:11208:29:29:89:540:342:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This model of illiquidity captures directly the search that characterizes over-the-counter
8:164:11298:29:29:71:540:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(OTC) markets. In these markets, traders must find an appropriatecounterparty, which
8:165:11382:29:29:71:540:284:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:can be time consuming. Trading delays also arise due to time spentgathering information,
8:166:11470:29:29:71:539:255:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reaching trading decisions, mobilizing capital, etc. Hence, trading delays are commonplace
8:167:11560:29:28:71:539:226:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and, therefore, the model can also capture features of other markets such as specialist and
8:168:11651:28:29:71:540:198:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:electronic limit-order-book markets, although these markets are, of course, distinct from
8:169:11740:29:0:71:145:169:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:OTC markets.
9:170:11753:0:41:71:539:711:17:g_d0_f3:17:g_d0_f3:2  Equilibrium Risk Management, Liquidity, and Prices
9:171:11806:41:29:71:540:670:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We now proceed to derive the steady-state equilibrium agent fractionsμ, the maximum

9:173:11976:29:53:71:270:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ownershnwant to buy, which leads to

9:175:12052:52:29:71:539:507:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and three more such steady-state equations.  Equation (5) states that the change in the
9:176:12139:29:29:71:539:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fraction ofloagents has three components, corresponding to the three termson the right
9:177:12225:29:29:71:540:449:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:hand side: First, whenever anloagent meets anhninvestor, he sells his asset and is no
9:178:12310:29:29:71:540:420:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:longer anloagent. Second, whenever the intrinsic type of aloagent switches to high, he
9:179:12396:29:29:71:539:391:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:becomes anhoagent. Third,hoagents can switch type and becomelo. Duffie, Gˆarleanu,
9:180:12478:29:29:71:540:362:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and Pedersen (2005) show that, taking ̄θas fixed, there is a unique stable steady-state mass
9:181:12570:29:29:71:539:333:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:distribution as long as ̄θ≥Θ. Here, agents’ positions ̄θare endogenous and depend onμ, so
9:182:12659:29:29:71:259:304:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that we must calculate a fixed point.
9:183:12696:29:28:89:539:275:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Agents take the steady-state distributionμas fixed when they derive their optimal strate-

9:185:12876:29:29:71:540:218:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:utility of an agent depends on his current type,ζ(t)∈ T, (i.e., whether he is a high or a

10:195:13321:53:53:71:532:576:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We conjecture, and later confirm, that the equilibrium asset price per share is of the form

11:231:14236:39:29:71:539:566:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:These results are intuitive. The “position limit” ̄θincreases in the risk limit  ̄σand decreases

11:237:14692:29:29:71:540:393:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Naturally, the liquidity discount is larger if there are more low-type owners in equilibrium

11:239:14859:29:29:89:539:335:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Of the equilibria obtaining with liquidity-adjusted risk management, we concentrate on
11:240:14945:29:29:71:540:306:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the ones that are stable, in the sense that increasing ̄θmarginally would result in equilibrium
11:241:15040:29:29:71:539:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:quantities violating the VaR constraint (2).  Conversely, an equilibrium is unstable if a
11:242:15129:29:28:71:540:248:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:marginal change in holdings that violates the constraint would result in the equilibrium

12:273:15968:47:29:71:539:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f8:Proposition 2Suppose that ̄σis large enough for existence of an equilibrium. Consider a
12:274:16055:29:29:71:540:417:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:stable equilibrium with liquidity-adjusted risk management and letτ=12λμhn, which means
12:275:16142:29:28:72:507:388:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:that the equilibrium allocations and price are the same with simple risk management.
12:276:16226:28:29:89:540:360:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Consider any combination of the conditions (a) higher dividend volatilityσX, (b) lower
12:277:16312:29:29:72:539:331:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:risk limit ̄σ, (c) lower meeting intensityλ, (d) lower switching intensityλuto the high risk-
12:278:16405:29:29:72:540:302:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:bearing state, and (e) higher switching intensityλdto the low risk-bearing state. Then, (i)
12:279:16496:29:29:71:540:273:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:the equilibrium position ̄θdecreases, (ii) expected search times for selling increase, and (iii)
12:280:16592:29:39:71:498:244:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:prices decrease. All three effects are larger with liquidity-adjusted risk management.
12:281:16678:39:29:89:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:To see the intuition for these results, consider first the impact of ahigher dividend
12:282:16763:29:29:71:539:176:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:volatility. This makes the risk-management constraint tighter, inducing agents to reduce
12:283:16851:29:29:71:540:147:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:their positions and spreading securities among more agents, thus leaving a smaller fraction
12:284:16942:29:0:71:540:118:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of agents with unused risk-bearing capacity. Hence, sellers’ search time increase and their
13:285:17035:0:29:71:540:711:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:bargaining position worsen, leading to lower prices. This price drop is due to illiquidity, as
13:286:17129:29:29:71:193:682:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f7:agents are risk neutral.4
13:287:17154:29:29:89:539:653:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Importantly, with liquidity-adjusted risk management, the increased search time for sell-
13:288:17243:29:29:71:539:624:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ers means that the risk over the expected liquidation period rises, thus further tightening
13:289:17334:29:29:71:539:595:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the risk-management constraint, further reducing positions, further increasing search times,
13:290:17426:29:29:71:124:566:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and so on.
13:291:17436:29:29:89:539:537:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This multiplier also increases the sensitivity of the economy with liquidity-adjusted risk
13:292:17526:29:28:71:540:508:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:management to the other shocks (b)–(e). Indeed, a lower risk limit (b) is equivalent to a
13:293:17615:28:29:71:539:480:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:higher dividend risk. The “liquidity shocks” (c)–(e) do not affect the equilibrium position ̄θ
13:294:17709:29:29:71:540:451:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with simple risk management, but they do increase the sellers’ search times and reduce prices.
13:295:17803:29:29:71:539:422:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:With liquidity-adjusted risk management, these liquidity shocks reduce security positions,
13:296:17893:29:29:71:525:393:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:too, because of increased search times and, as explained above,a multiplier effect arises.
13:297:17983:29:29:89:540:364:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The multiplier arising from the feedback between trading liquidity and risk management
13:298:18069:29:29:71:540:335:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:clearly magnifies the effects on liquidity and prices of changes in the economic environment.
13:299:18162:29:29:71:540:306:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Our steady-state model illustrate this point using comparativestatic analysis that essentially
13:300:18256:29:29:71:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:compares across economies. Similar results would arise in the time series of a single economy
13:301:18349:29:28:71:539:248:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:if there was random variation in the model characteristic, e.g., parameters switched in a
13:302:18438:28:29:71:539:220:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Markov chain as in Duffie, Gˆarleanu, and Pedersen (2007). In the context of such time-series
13:303:18531:29:29:71:540:191:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:variation, our multiplier effect can generate the abrupt changes in prices and selling times
13:304:18623:29:16:71:192:162:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that characterize crises.

14:322:19291:29:29:71:540:566:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Search times increase and prices decrease with volatility. Importantly, these sensitivities are
