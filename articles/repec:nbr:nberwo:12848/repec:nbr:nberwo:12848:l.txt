2:23:888:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:The Medicare Modernization Act was recently established, to provide limited drug coverage to the
2:24:984:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:elderly. However, there is limited evidence on how drug coverage might affect health. The goal of
2:25:1081:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:this paper is to obtain causal effects of prescription drug coverage on drug use, use of other medical
2:26:1185:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:services and health of the elderly. We use fixed-effects analysis to control for unmeasured person-specific
2:27:1292:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:effects that may confound the relationships of interest. Results show prescription drug coverage, particularly
2:28:1402:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:public coverage, significantly increased the utilization of prescription drugs, but had no discernable
2:29:1504:14:28:72:260:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:effect on hospital admissions or health.

3:47:1925:0:27:107:512:708:144:Times:144:Times:?:In 2005, elderly (65 years of age or above) people in the United States spent $120.6 
3:48:2010:27:28:71:538:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:billion on prescription drugs or an annual out-of-pocket expenditure of $1,113 per person, which 
3:49:2107:28:27:71:516:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:is approximately 5% of the average income of an elderly person (KFF, 2005). These figures 
3:50:2197:27:28:71:495:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:become more worrying when one considers that a substantial portion of the elderly lack 
3:51:2284:28:28:71:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurance coverage for prescription drugs.  For example in 2002, only 55% of the elderly had 
3:52:2377:28:27:71:535:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:uninterrupted prescription drug coverage (KFF, 2005).  Advocates for the elderly worry that the 
3:53:2473:27:28:71:523:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:combination of rising costs of drugs, limited incomes, and limited insurance coverage creates 
3:54:2567:28:27:71:517:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:circumstances for many elderly to go without essential medication, which may have adverse 
3:55:2657:27:28:71:534:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:health outcomes.  Indeed, studies have indicated that the elderly often skip doses, and that some 
3:56:2755:28:28:71:533:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:do not fill prescriptions due to cost (Steinman, Sands & Covinsky, 2001; Kitchman, et al. 2002; 
3:57:2851:28:27:71:246:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:Saver, Doescher & Jackson, 2004).  
3:58:2886:27:28:107:532:405:144:Times:144:Times:?:Until recently, Medicare did not cover outpatient prescription drugs. Elderly people had 
3:59:2975:28:27:71:530:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:to pay out-of-pocket or obtain coverage from other sources such as Public (Medicaid, Veterans 
3:60:3069:27:28:71:517:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:Affair and State Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs), employer-sponsored retiree benefits, 
3:61:3160:28:27:71:515:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:Medicare Advantage plans (HMO), and privately purchased Medigap policies.  In 2003, the 
3:62:3248:27:28:71:529:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Drug Act (MMA) established a 
3:63:3336:28:28:71:536:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:drug benefit for the Medicare population. The program, which started in January 2006, provides 
3:64:3431:28:27:71:530:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:prescription drug coverage through private firms with varying levels of cost sharing based on a 
3:65:3527:27:28:71:359:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:patient’s expenditures for prescription drugs (CCH, 2003).  
3:66:3587:28:27:107:521:184:144:Times:144:Times:?:While political objectives were an important part of the explanation of the timing and 
3:67:3674:27:28:71:533:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:design of the MMA, creation of the MMA was also motivated by a desire to improve the health 
3:68:3766:28:28:71:536:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the elderly by lowering the cost of prescription drugs, which in turn would stimulate their use 
3:69:3865:28:0:71:497:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:and improve health.  Although plausible, there is relatively little evidence to support the 
4:70:3958:0:27:71:526:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:presumed causal relationships underlying the MMA.  Few studies have examined the effect of 
4:71:4049:27:28:71:514:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:prescription drug coverage on prescription drug use among the elderly and even fewer have 
4:72:4139:28:27:71:523:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:examined its effect on health. This study examines the relationship between prescription drug 
4:73:4233:27:28:71:535:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:coverage, prescription drug utilization, hospitalization, and the health of the elderly population.  
4:74:4334:28:28:71:539:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:Analyses are based on a nationally representative sample from the Medicare Current Beneficiary 
4:75:4429:28:27:71:524:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:Survey (MCBS) from the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) for years 1992-
4:76:4516:27:28:71:542:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:2000.  The study paid particular attention to the non-random nature of prescription drug coverage 
4:77:4614:28:27:71:538:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:and the selection bias caused by it.  The goal of the study was to obtain estimates of the effect of 
4:78:4715:27:28:71:539:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:prescription drug coverage on prescription drug utilization and health that can plausibly be given 
4:79:4814:28:28:71:183:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:a causal interpretation. 
4:80:4839:28:27:71:74:432:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
4:81:4839:27:28:71:402:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:Conceptual Framework--Demand for Prescription Drug Coverage 
4:82:4899:28:27:107:529:377:144:Times:144:Times:?:Economic theory assumes that people are risk averse—they prefer a certain outcome to 
4:83:4984:27:28:71:541:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:an uncertain one even if the actuarial value of both is the same.  Therefore, people will be willing 
4:84:5085:28:27:71:531:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:to pay to reduce the financial risk associated with illness by buying insurance.  The willingness 
4:85:5183:27:28:71:512:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:to buy insurance increases with financial risk, which is a function of both the probability of 
4:86:5278:28:28:71:537:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:illness and the size of the expected loss associated with illness.  Willingness to pay also depends 
4:87:5378:28:27:71:536:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:on the degree of risk aversion, as some people’s dislike for risk is stronger than others (Cutler & 
4:88:5478:27:28:71:169:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:Zeckhauser, 2000).  
4:89:5498:28:27:107:526:184:144:Times:144:Times:?: This model of the demand for insurance is consistent with recent trends in prescription 
4:90:5586:27:28:71:541:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:drug use.  Technological advances in both pharmaceutical and medical treatments have increased 
4:91:5681:28:28:71:521:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:the importance of prescription drugs for maintaining good health, particularly for the elderly. 
4:92:5777:28:0:71:480:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:Costs of prescription drugs have also increased significantly over time. Thus there is 
5:93:5865:0:27:71:532:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:considerable uncertainty about the financial risk of illness as it relates to prescription drugs and 
5:94:5966:27:28:71:536:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:this uncertainty has increased over time.  As a result, the demand for prescription drug coverage 
5:95:6064:28:27:71:501:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:among the elderly has been growing in recent years (see Figure 1). The greater desire for 
5:96:6154:27:28:71:416:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:prescription drug coverage among the elderly led, in part, to the MMA. 
5:97:6225:28:28:107:520:598:144:Times:144:Times:?:This model of insurance also has important implications for empirical analyses of the 
5:98:6311:28:27:71:535:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:effect of prescription drug coverage.  It suggests that those with insurance will differ from those 
5:99:6411:27:28:71:491:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:without insurance.  Those with insurance are likely to be at greater risk illness (need of 
5:100:6502:28:27:71:507:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:prescription drugs) and/or be more risk averse. This may be exacerbated by imperfect risk 
5:101:6592:27:28:71:505:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:adjustment.   So prescription drug use would likely differ between those with and without 
5:102:6682:28:28:71:538:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurance even if there was no insurance.  Most empirical studies have not adequately accounted 
5:103:6778:28:27:71:536:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:for this selection effect (Davis, Poisal, Chulis, Zarabozo, & Cooper, 1999; Lillard, Rogowski, & 
5:104:6875:27:28:71:528:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:Kington, 1999; Blustein, 2000; Adams, Soumerai, & Ross- Degnan, 2001).  Thus, it is unclear 
5:105:6967:28:27:71:532:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:how to interpret estimates of the effect of prescription drug coverage reported in earlier studies, 
5:106:7067:27:28:71:535:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:as they might be seriously biased estimates of the causal effect of prescription drug coverage on 
5:107:7165:28:27:71:270:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:prescription drug utilization and health.   
5:108:7209:27:28:107:536:295:144:Times:144:Times:?:A second principle of the simple insurance model is that insurance-induced utilization of 
5:109:7299:28:28:71:483:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:prescription drugs could have relatively few health benefits.  Most elderly people use 
5:110:7386:28:27:71:542:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:prescription drugs, even if they do not have insurance.  So the increased use of prescription drugs 
5:111:7486:27:28:71:537:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:associated with insurance, what we will refer to as marginal use, may have fewer health benefits 
5:112:7583:28:27:71:535:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:than average use of prescription drugs.  Moreover, lower prices are likely to result in some over-
5:113:7681:27:28:71:510:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:utilization—for which the marginal costs are greater than the marginal benefits (Zweifel & 
5:114:7772:28:0:71:157:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:Manning, 2000).  
6:115:7790:0:27:107:542:708:144:Times:144:Times:?:The argument in support of the MMA is that providing prescription drug insurance would 
6:116:7877:27:28:71:538:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:make prescription drugs more affordable, thereby increasing their use. In turn, this increased use 
6:117:7976:28:27:71:527:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:would lead to better health.  While the first part is likely true, the magnitude of the response to 
6:118:8076:27:28:71:518:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurance remains uncertain, as previous studies have not adequately addressed the selection 
6:119:8169:28:28:71:532:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:issue and, therefore, have not credibly identified the causal effect of prescription drug coverage 
6:120:8268:28:27:71:515:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:on utilization.  More importantly, there is little evidence as to the effect of prescription drug 
6:121:8366:27:28:71:498:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:coverage on health.  So even if utilization of prescription drugs increases with insurance 
6:122:8457:28:27:71:504:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:coverage, it is unknown whether such an increase would significantly improve health in a 
6:123:8546:27:28:71:170:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:general population.  
6:124:8567:28:21:71:74:460:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
6:125:8567:21:20:71:156:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:Prior Literature  
6:126:8585:20:28:107:519:419:144:Times:144:Times:?:Our review of the literature is limited to studies of elderly populations that have been 
6:127:8674:28:28:71:531:391:144:Times:144:Times:B:controlled in some way for confounding factors. We begin with studies that use cross-sectional 
6:128:8769:28:27:71:500:363:144:Times:144:Times:B:data. Typically, these studies report that insurance coverage, or more generous insurance 
6:129:8859:27:28:71:534:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:coverage, results in relatively large increases in utilization of prescription drugs (DHHS, 2000). 
6:130:8958:28:27:71:496:308:144:Times:144:Times:B:Stuart and Zacker (1999) reported 15.5% lower annual prescription use for dual eligible 
6:131:9046:27:28:71:539:281:144:Times:144:Times:B:Medicare enrollees living in states that imposed Medicaid co-payments compared to those living 
6:132:9141:28:27:71:531:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:in states with no co-payments.  Blustein (2000) found that drug coverage was associated with a 
6:133:9236:27:28:71:526:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:40% increase in antihypertensive drug purchases by hypertensive patients. Federman, Adams, 
6:134:9327:28:28:71:525:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:Ross-Degnan, Soumerai & Ayanian (2001) reported 84% lower odds of HMG-CoA reductase 
6:135:9411:28:27:71:531:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:inhibitors (statins) use among elderly with high cholesterol without drug coverage as compared 
6:136:9506:27:28:71:534:143:144:Times:144:Times:B:to those with employer-sponsored coverage.  Lillard et al. (1999) found that insurance coverage 
6:137:9602:28:0:71:546:115:144:Times:144:Times:B:significantly increased the probability of any drug use by 12.2% for those with private insurance.   
7:138:9704:0:27:107:532:708:144:Times:144:Times:?:Several studies have used quasi-experimental research designs.  The typical approach is 
7:139:9792:27:28:71:514:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:to compare use of prescription drugs pre and post a change in prescription drug coverage or 
7:140:9884:28:27:71:498:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:policy (e.g., an increase in co-payment, limit on number of prescriptions).  For example, 
7:141:9974:27:28:71:531:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:Soumerai et al., (1991) analyzed the impact of a three prescriptions per month limit in the New 
7:142:10070:28:28:71:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:Hampshire Medicaid program on prescription drug use and hospitalization rates.  New Jersey 
7:143:10161:28:27:71:531:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:was used as a comparison state. Their analysis was limited to non-institutionalized, white, dual-
7:144:10258:27:28:71:538:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:eligible people who had an average of three prescriptions per month at baseline, including use of 
7:145:10356:28:27:71:523:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:at least one prescription drug for a chronic condition. Their results indicated a 35% decline in 
7:146:10453:27:28:71:492:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:drug use after the cap was imposed and no significant changes in hospitalization rates.  
7:147:10542:28:28:107:496:460:144:Times:144:Times:?:Johnson et al. (1997) and Chandra et al. (2007) examined the effect of increased 
7:148:10623:28:27:71:526:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:prescription drug cost sharing in Medicare managed care plans. Johnson et al. (1997) reported 
7:149:10717:27:28:71:527:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:that a 2$ (66%) increase in co-payment resulted in a significant decrease in prescription use of 
7:150:10814:28:27:71:504:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:approximately 8% and that it had no effect on hospitalization rates.  Chandra et al. (2007) 
7:151:10906:27:28:71:539:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:calculated a price elasticity of demand of between -0.46 and -0.2 for Medicare PPOs and -1.4 for 
7:152:11003:28:27:71:528:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:Medicare HMO.  These elasticities imply reductions in prescriptions filled from the pre-policy 
7:153:11098:27:28:71:493:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:mean of 2 to 6% in the PPO and 14.2% in the HMO. In addition, although they found a 
7:154:11182:28:28:71:496:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:significant increase in hospitalization rates in the HMO plan (which had increases in co-
7:155:11271:28:27:71:542:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:payments for both prescription and office visits), there was no effect in the PPO plan (which only 
7:156:11370:27:28:71:295:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:had an increase in prescription co-payments).  
7:157:11417:28:27:107:502:184:144:Times:144:Times:?:Gawrisankaran and Town (2004) examined the effect of Medicare Managed Care 
7:158:11492:27:28:71:500:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:Organization (MCO) penetration with and without prescription drug coverage on elderly 
7:159:11578:28:28:71:516:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:mortality using payments to MCO’s as instruments. Their preferred (instrumental variables) 
7:160:11669:28:0:71:531:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates indicated that a 10-percentage point increase in non-drug MCO penetration increased 
8:161:11764:0:27:71:512:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:mortality by 2.8%.  Yang, Gilleskie and Norton (2004) analyzed the effect of supplemental 
8:162:11854:27:28:71:505:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurance, with and without prescription drug coverage, on prescription drug expenditure, 
8:163:11944:28:27:71:534:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:hospital services, and health using MCBS data. They used a dynamic panel model that modeled 
8:164:12036:27:28:71:510:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:health as a function of current and lagged utilization. Their results indicated drug coverage 
8:165:12130:28:28:71:523:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:increased drug expenditure by 20-35% over a 5-year period and decreased mortality slightly.  
8:166:12223:28:27:107:536:570:144:Times:144:Times:?:The results from these studies consistently show that prescription drug coverage, and the 
8:167:12313:27:28:71:506:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:lower cost sharing associated with it, increased utilization of prescription drugs by elderly 
8:168:12407:28:27:71:496:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:patients.  However, there is a wide range of estimates, which likely reflects the different 
8:169:12499:27:28:71:504:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:populations examined.  In addition, the observational studies lacked a credible strategy to 
8:170:12591:28:28:71:519:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:address selection (Stuart & Zacker, 1999; Lillard et al. 1999; Blustein, 2000; Federman et al. 
8:171:12686:28:27:71:519:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:2001). The quasi experimental studies, while better on this point, have either focused on low-
8:172:12780:27:28:71:531:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:income (Medicaid) population (Soumeari et al. 1991) or on a specific managed care population 
8:173:12873:28:27:71:525:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Johnson et al. 1997; Gawrisankaran & Town, 2004; Chandra et al. 2007).  Therefore, there is 
8:174:12966:27:28:71:516:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:little in these studies that can be used to draw inferences for a broader population of elderly. 
8:175:13063:28:27:71:539:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:With respect to health, there is almost no evidence of the effect of prescription drug coverage.  It 
8:176:13164:27:28:71:532:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:is clear that additional studies are warranted. Specifically, studies that examine a representative 
8:177:13264:28:28:71:515:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:sample of elderly people, that pay special attention to issues of selection, and which include 
8:178:13359:28:27:71:301:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:prescription utilization and health as outcomes.

8:181:13427:27:28:107:513:157:144:Times:144:Times:?:The fundamental identification problem in estimating the effect of prescription drug 
8:182:13512:28:28:71:537:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:coverage on utilization and health is that the same person is never simultaneously observed with 
8:183:13609:28:0:71:514:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:and without prescription drug coverage. It is unlikely that the self-selection into coverage is 
9:184:13706:0:27:71:532:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:random.  To address this issue, we use a multivariate regression model with controls for person-
9:185:13802:27:28:71:529:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:specific fixed-effects.1 Longitudinal data provides a potential solution to the selection problem 
9:186:13900:28:27:72:504:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:because over time people move into and out of prescription drug coverage.  Thus, we can 
9:187:13988:27:28:72:533:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:observe the same person with and without coverage, although at two different points in time.  If 
9:188:14085:28:28:72:528:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:this movement is random (conditional on measured covariates) then we can identify the causal 
9:189:14178:28:27:72:529:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:effect of prescription drug coverage. The time aspect of this approach, however, introduces the 
9:190:14274:27:28:72:529:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:possibility that unmeasured temporal influences (e.g., health status) might change, and bias the 
9:191:14371:28:27:72:364:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates of the causal effect of prescription drug coverage.  
9:192:14434:27:28:108:523:488:144:Times:144:Times:?:There are two conditions that determine the efficacy of the fixed-effect analysis. First, 
9:193:14524:28:28:72:530:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:there should be sufficient variation in prescription drug coverage within individuals over time.  
9:194:14622:28:27:72:500:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:Stuart et al. (2001) reported that 10.6% of non-institutionalized elderly who did not have 
9:195:14713:27:28:72:536:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:coverage in 1995 found coverage in 1996, while 7.4% of those who had coverage in 1995 lost it 
9:196:14807:28:27:72:500:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:in 1996.  Our analysis indicated that, on average, 14% of the sample either gained or lost 
9:197:14898:27:28:72:529:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:coverage each year (see Table 2). So there is evidence of significant within-person variation in 
9:198:14995:28:27:72:527:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:prescription drug insurance. The second condition is that movement into or out of prescription 
9:199:15090:27:28:72:523:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:drug insurance should be random, conditional on controlling for measured characteristics and 
9:200:15183:28:28:72:518:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:unmeasured person-specific fixed-effects.    To assess the plausibility of this assumption, we 
9:201:15278:28:27:72:518:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:conducted a variety of analyses.  All of these analyses provided evidence consistent with the 
9:202:15372:27:28:72:538:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:assumption underlying the fixed-effect approach.  The most compelling of these is a comparison 
9:203:15467:28:27:72:502:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:of changes over time in prescription drug use and health status between those who would 
9:204:15555:27:28:72:526:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:eventually obtain insurance (“treatment group”) and those who either always had insurance or 
9:205:15648:28:28:72:534:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:never had insurance (“comparison group”).  The fixed-effect approach assumes that, changes in 
9:206:15742:28:0:72:484:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:prescription drug use and health over time would be the same for the “treatment” and 
10:207:15828:0:27:71:536:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:“comparison” groups conditional on covariates.  We present the details of this analysis later, but 
10:208:15927:27:28:71:508:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:note here that there was no evidence, that trends in prescription drug use or health differed 
10:209:16021:28:27:71:534:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:between the “treatment” and “comparison” groups.  Similar results were reported by Briesacher 
10:210:16115:27:28:71:494:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:et al. (2005) who examined medical care spending before and after gaining prescription 
10:211:16202:28:28:71:536:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurance coverage of Medicare beneficiaries.  While we cannot definitively test the assumption 
10:212:16298:28:27:71:540:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the fixed effects approach, we believe the evidence supports the plausibility of this approach.

10:233:17147:27:29:71:533:266:144:Times:144:Times:B:socioeconomic factors. PC represents prescription drug coverage of person (i) in state (s) and at

10:235:17344:28:28:71:530:209:144:Times:144:Times:B:coverage, respectively, and e is the error term and represents unmeasured aspect of utilization.  
10:236:17442:28:27:107:523:181:144:Times:144:Times:?:Estimates of equation (1) are obtained using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) for binary 
10:237:17527:27:28:71:542:154:144:Times:144:Times:B:dependent variables and Poisson regression for discrete outcomes.  We recognize that OLS might 
10:238:17622:28:28:71:540:126:144:Times:144:Times:B:not be the most efficient estimator for binary dependent variables, but in the fixed-effect context, 
10:239:17723:28:0:71:520:98:144:Times:144:Times:B:common methods used in these circumstances (e.g. Logistic regression) have limitations that 
11:240:17816:0:27:71:515:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:make OLS preferred.  For example, the fixed-effect Logistic model assumes that the person-
11:241:17906:27:28:71:531:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:specific fixed-effect has an infinite distribution and as a result drops observations for which the 
11:242:18006:28:27:71:534:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:dependent variable does not change over time even though there may be significant variation in 
11:243:18101:27:28:71:541:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:the right hand side variables.  The Poisson model also has an advantage over other methods (e.g., 
11:244:18199:28:28:71:539:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:Negative Binomial) in the fixed-effect context (Cameron & Trivedi, 1998; Allison & Waterman, 
11:245:18292:28:27:71:530:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:2000).2  In both cases (OLS and Poisson), standard errors need to be constructed to account for 
11:246:18388:27:28:72:533:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:likely biases.3  Therefore, we construct what are commonly referred to as robust standard errors 
11:247:18485:28:27:72:534:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Wooldridge, 2002).  Despite the preference for OLS and Poisson, use of Logistic and Negative 
11:248:18579:27:28:71:430:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:Binomial regression yielded qualitatively similar results to those reported.

11:252:18750:28:28:71:533:391:144:Times:144:Times:B:(MCBS)—Cost and Use file from CMS. MCBS is a national representative, continuous, survey 
11:253:18839:28:27:71:534:363:144:Times:144:Times:B:of aged, disabled and institutionalized Medicare beneficiaries (CMS, 2000). The MCBS sample 
11:254:18931:27:28:71:536:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:is drawn from the Medicare enrollment file. When the survey started in 1991, there was no limit 
11:255:19027:28:27:71:517:308:144:Times:144:Times:B:on duration of follow-up. In 1994, it was decided that a panel will retire after 4 years. So for 
11:256:19124:27:28:71:512:281:144:Times:144:Times:B:some individuals there are more than 4 years of data. In addition, approximately 6,000 new 
11:257:19215:28:27:71:524:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:people are added to the survey each year to account for non-response and death, to maintain a 
11:258:19309:27:28:71:523:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:target sample size of 12,000 individuals.  Each respondent is interviewed three times per year 
11:259:19404:28:28:71:528:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:over a 4-year period. However, the bulk of the information is recorded on an annual basis. The 
11:260:19499:28:27:71:531:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:response rate for the first round is 83% and for the 12th round is approximately 70% (ResDAC,

12:264:19779:0:27:71:523:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:health status, and information on access to care is collected. After the first round, subjects are 
12:265:19878:27:28:71:531:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:advised to retain receipts, bills, prescription vials, and any related paperwork to document their 
12:266:19977:28:27:71:523:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:prescription use. In the following rounds, information is obtained on prescriptions purchased, 
12:267:20072:27:28:71:507:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:charges incurred, and sources of payment for the prescriptions obtained since the previous 
12:268:20163:28:28:71:510:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:interview. Respondents are also asked about utilization of other medical services since last 
12:269:20256:28:27:71:532:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:interviewed. Aggregated information on the use of medical services from Medicare claims files 
12:270:20350:27:28:71:208:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:is also included in the data.  
12:271:20381:28:27:107:514:515:144:Times:144:Times:?:For the purpose of this analysis, data from 1992 to 2000 were used. The sample was 
12:272:20464:27:28:71:541:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:restricted to non-institutionalized elderly without end-stage renal disease. Individuals with partial 
12:273:20566:28:28:71:534:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:year information were removed from the analysis.4  We also excluded individuals from four US 
12:274:20659:28:27:72:484:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:territories and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Finally, states with fewer than 100 
12:275:20744:27:28:72:521:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:observations were removed from the analysis due to estimation concerns with small cell size. 
12:276:20837:28:27:72:518:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:The final sample size was 73,490 person-years observation representing an average of 8,166 
12:277:20928:27:28:71:542:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:people per year and a total of 29,120 unique individuals. Of these 29,120 people, 17% had only 1 
12:278:21025:28:27:71:522:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:year of data5, 20% had 2 years of data available data, 51% 3 years, 9% 4 years, and 4% had 5 
12:279:21118:27:28:72:142:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:years of data.  
12:280:21134:28:28:108:537:267:144:Times:144:Times:?:MCBS respondents report multiple sources of prescription drug coverage and some have 
12:281:21219:28:27:72:541:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:coverage for only a few months in the year. Multiple coverage was due to elderly switching from 
12:282:21315:27:28:72:535:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:one source of coverage to another or having more than one source of coverage at the same time. 
12:283:21410:28:27:71:534:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:To account for this, insurance coverage was calculated for each month. Individual who reported 
12:284:21505:27:28:71:504:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:multiple coverage in a month were assigned to the more generous source in the following 
12:285:21593:28:28:71:511:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:hierarchical order: public, employer-sponsored, HMO, Medigap, and no drug coverage.6 A 
12:286:21680:28:0:71:538:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:similar hierarchy was used by Laschober et al. (2002).  Finally, the proportion of months in each 
13:287:21780:0:27:71:497:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:category was calculated. These categories were then used as independent variable in the 
13:288:21868:27:28:71:537:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:regression analysis. In addition, any drug coverage was also defined as the proportion of months 
13:289:21965:28:27:71:261:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:with coverage (all sources combined).7 
13:290:22003:27:28:108:487:626:144:Times:144:Times:?:Several measures of utilization were constructed from self-reported data.  Any 
13:291:22082:28:28:71:523:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:prescription use was a dichotomous variable equal to 1 if any prescription was reported and 0 
13:292:22176:28:27:71:530:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:otherwise. However, 86% of Medicare beneficiaries use at least one prescription drug in a year 
13:293:22271:27:28:71:530:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Davis, et al., 1999).  As a result, measuring use in this way is limited.  Therefore, utilization is 
13:294:22373:28:27:71:419:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:also measured using the reported annual number of prescriptions used.   
13:295:22445:27:28:107:540:488:144:Times:144:Times:?:We also examined the effect of prescription drug coverage on hospitalizations. Assuming 
13:296:22533:28:28:71:497:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:a beneficial effect of prescription insurance coverage on health, one would expect lower 
13:297:22622:28:27:71:529:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:hospitalizations rate for covered individuals, compared to those without prescription coverage. 
13:298:22718:27:28:71:535:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:Here prescription coverage would act as a substitute for hospitalization, which is desirable from 
13:299:22816:28:27:71:513:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:both consumer and provider perspectives because prescription drugs are less invasive, have 
13:300:22907:27:28:71:276:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:fewer complications and have lower cost.  
13:301:22949:28:27:107:515:322:144:Times:144:Times:?:We used a variety of measures of health.  A dichotomous variable representing poor 
13:302:23032:27:28:71:528:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:health was constructed in which poor health was coded if self-reported health was fair or poor, 
13:303:23128:28:28:71:476:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:and good health represent if self–reported health was excellent, very good or good.  
13:304:23213:28:27:107:521:239:144:Times:144:Times:?:A detailed measure of health that is more directly related to prescription use might be 
13:305:23301:27:28:71:516:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:more appropriate.  Several studies have indicated that prescription drugs improve functional 
13:306:23394:28:27:71:539:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:disability.  Antiarthritic drugs have been shown to improve gait and walking ability (Hamilton et 
13:307:23492:27:28:71:510:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:al., 2001; Genovese et al., 2005; Canete et al., 2006). Similarly, studies have indicated that 
13:308:23587:28:28:71:538:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:antidiabetic treatment is associated with improved health status and quality of life (Reza, Taylor, 
13:309:23687:28:0:71:504:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:Towse, Ward & Hendra, 2002; Bech, Moses & Gomis, 2003). Prescription drugs used for 
14:310:23773:0:27:71:537:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:mental, cardiovascular and respiratory disorders have also been shown to improve quality of life 
14:311:23870:27:28:71:504:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Croog et al., 1986; Testa, Anderson, Nackley & Hollenberg, 1993; Israel, Cohn, Dube & 
14:312:23957:28:27:71:526:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:Drazen, 1996; Feldman et al., 2003; Hjalmarson et al., 2000; Roman et al., 2005) .  Given this 
14:313:24052:27:28:71:515:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:evidence, we used activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living 
14:314:24147:28:28:71:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:(IADL) as measures of health. These measures have been used extensively in prior studies of 
14:315:24239:28:27:71:337:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:elderly health (Blustein, 2000; Federman et al., 2001).  
14:316:24296:27:28:107:535:543:144:Times:144:Times:?:Activities of daily living include eating, dressing, bathing, walking, transferring into and 
14:317:24389:28:27:71:531:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:out of a chair, and using the toilet. Instrumental activities of daily living include making meals, 
14:318:24489:27:28:71:524:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:using the phone, going shopping, managing money, and doing light or heavy housework. The 
14:319:24578:28:28:71:537:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:minimum and maximum scores that an elderly person can have on the ADL and IADL are 0 and 
14:320:24667:28:27:71:516:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:6. Finally, a composite measure of functional disability was constructed that sums ADL and 
14:321:24758:27:28:71:502:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:IADL.  The composite score values would; therefore range from 0 to12.  Furthermore, as 
14:322:24845:28:27:71:540:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:prescription drugs can impact some measures of functional disability more than others, the effect 
14:323:24943:27:28:71:508:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:of prescription drug coverage on each item of the ADL and IADL was also assessed. Prior 
14:324:25031:28:27:71:526:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:studies have used each item separately and have shown that each individual item is a sensitive 
14:325:25126:27:28:71:488:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:measure of functional disability (Cook, Richardson, Pietroban, Silva & Turner, 2006). 
14:326:25212:28:28:107:513:267:144:Times:144:Times:?:The analysis controls for age, sex, race, education, urban residence, income, marital

15:334:25494:27:28:71:534:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:presented in Table 1, which reports weighted estimates.8  The average age of the sample was 75 
15:335:25589:28:27:72:541:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:years; 58% were women and 11% were non-white. Almost every respondent was married at least 
15:336:25680:27:28:72:516:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:once in their life and 29% had at least some college education.  Average annual income was 
15:337:25771:28:28:72:191:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:$25,546 (2000 dollars).  
15:338:25796:28:27:108:515:570:144:Times:144:Times:?:It was evident that there was significant use of prescription drugs by this population. 
15:339:25884:27:28:72:538:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:Almost every individual in the sample reported having at least one prescription use. The average 
15:340:25981:28:27:72:488:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:number of annual prescriptions was approximately 20. This figure included refills and 
15:341:26067:27:28:72:538:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:represented approximately 6 prescriptions per person among those with at least one prescription. 
15:342:26164:28:28:72:542:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:Sixty-two percent of the sample had prescription drug coverage with the majority of the coverage 
15:343:26261:28:27:72:532:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:provided by employers. In terms of health, 22% of the elderly respondents reported poor or fair 
15:344:26357:27:28:72:110:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:health.  
15:345:26366:28:27:108:519:377:144:Times:144:Times:?:Table 1 also shows descriptive information by prescription drug insurance coverage.  
15:346:26451:27:28:72:540:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:Elderly people with low incomes and who were living in rural areas were significantly less likely 
15:347:26549:28:27:72:495:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:to have any prescription drug coverage.  Notably, the demographic and socio-economic 
15:348:26634:27:28:72:527:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:differences between those with and without coverage, while often statistically significant were 
15:349:26730:28:28:72:536:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:not very large.  There was, however, significant heterogeneity among those who had coverage—
15:350:26822:28:27:72:526:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:individuals covered by public programs were quite different than individuals covered by other 
15:351:26916:27:28:72:518:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:programs.  People with public insurance coverage were similar to those without insurance in 
15:352:27008:28:27:72:520:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:terms of demographic and socio-economic characteristics.  Therefore, when individuals with 
15:353:27099:27:28:72:527:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:different categories of drug coverage were combined, the socio-economic differences between 
15:354:27191:28:0:72:326:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:those with and without drug coverage were smaller.  
16:355:27245:0:27:107:536:708:144:Times:144:Times:?:Is there a relationship between prescription drug coverage, and prescription drug use and 
16:356:27335:27:28:71:518:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:health evident in Table 1? In the case of use of prescription drugs, those with insurance have 
16:357:27430:28:27:71:511:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:greater use and there is a gradient in terms of use according to the generosity of insurance.  
16:358:27525:27:28:71:519:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:Those with public insurance, who pay nothing out-of-pocket, have the greatest use and those 
16:359:27617:28:28:71:537:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:with Medigap, which is least generous, have the least use.  Part of the greater use of prescription 
16:360:27717:28:27:71:515:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:drugs may be due to differences in health.  Those with public insurance coverage were least 
16:361:27809:27:28:71:527:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:healthy.  Generally, elderly without insurance coverage reported worse health than individuals 
16:362:27904:28:27:71:482:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:with employer, HMO or Medigap insurance coverage. Those in public programs had 
16:363:27983:27:28:71:479:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:significantly worse health compared to all others, even those without drug coverage. 
16:364:28068:28:28:107:531:460:144:Times:144:Times:?:Figure 1 shows trends in drug coverage from 1992 to 2000. In 1992, 52% of the elderly 
16:365:28154:28:27:71:534:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:reported no prescription drug insurance coverage. This dropped to 31% in 2000. Coverage from 
16:366:28247:27:28:71:539:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:public programs remained more or less stable. The gain in coverage came mostly from employer 
16:367:28340:28:27:71:228:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:sponsored and HMO coverage.9 
16:368:28368:27:28:108:532:350:144:Times:144:Times:?:Figure 2, shows number of prescriptions per person.  Elderly in public coverage had the 
16:369:28456:28:27:72:542:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:highest prescription drug utilization. The graph also indicates that utilization increased over time. 
16:370:28558:27:28:72:533:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:The average number of prescriptions increased by 47% for public programs, 59% for employer-
16:371:28649:28:28:72:530:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:sponsored, 42% in HMO plans, and, 46% with Medigap coverage. For those without any drug, 
16:372:28738:28:27:72:344:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:coverage the number of prescriptions increased by 50%. 
16:373:28793:27:28:108:538:212:144:Times:144:Times:?: Was the increase in drug coverage and prescription use associated with improved health? 
16:374:28881:28:27:72:527:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:There does not seem to be any trend toward better health, except for those in public programs. 
16:375:28976:27:28:72:530:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:There was a slight improvement in functional disability (ADL plus IADL) for elderly in public 
16:376:29070:28:28:72:541:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:coverage (Figure 3). For the other groups, it remained stable. The proportion of elderly with poor 
16:377:29169:28:0:72:260:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:health also remained stable (Figure 4). 
17:378:29211:0:27:107:532:708:144:Times:144:Times:?:One issue critical to our research design was whether there was sufficient within-person 
17:379:29300:27:28:71:541:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:variation in prescription drug coverage. Table 2 shows this variation between year t and year t+1. 
17:380:29399:28:27:71:525:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:A series of 2-year constant sample panels were created for 92-93, 93-94, 95-96, 97-98, 98-99, 
17:381:29493:27:28:71:529:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:and 99-00.  The first year of each panel was denoted by year t and the second year by year t+1, 
17:382:29589:28:28:71:530:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:and then the panels were aggregated.  Individuals with only 1 year of data were not included in 
17:383:29685:28:27:71:517:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:this table. In each panel there were approximately 5,000 individuals. The data in Table 2 are

17:385:29874:28:27:71:529:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:the years. On average, 14% of the sample changed coverage in each year. The majority of gain 
17:386:29967:27:28:71:523:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:was through employer-sponsored coverage, but an equal number of individuals lost employer 
17:387:30057:28:28:71:531:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:sponsored coverage. The most stable coverage was public.  Overall, the data in Table 2 suggest 
17:388:30152:28:27:71:523:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:that there was sufficient variation in prescription drug coverage to implement the fixed-effect 
17:389:30248:27:28:71:127:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:approach.

17:392:30280:28:27:107:515:322:144:Times:144:Times:?:Tables 3 to 5 display estimates of the effects of prescription drug coverage on use of 
17:393:30367:27:28:71:503:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:prescriptions drugs and hospitalizations.  Column 2 presents the estimates of the effect of 
17:394:30459:28:28:71:512:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:prescription drug coverage from models that do not include person-specific fixed-effects or 
17:395:30551:28:27:71:541:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:controls for individual health.  In column 3, estimates are from a model that includes measures of 
17:396:30650:27:28:71:497:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:health, as determined by an indicator of poor health and the number of chronic diseases. 
17:397:30739:28:27:71:539:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:Including measures of health is intended to control for unmeasured time-varying determinants of 
17:398:30835:27:28:71:528:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:prescription drug coverage that are not accounted for by fixed-effects and that might confound 
17:399:30930:28:0:71:537:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates.  However, we recognize that this approach could be problematic because health could 
18:400:31027:0:27:71:511:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:be affected by drug coverage. Finally, results from the fixed-effect models are presented in 
18:401:31120:27:28:71:378:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:columns 4 and 5, corresponding to models in columns 2 and 3.  
18:402:31182:28:27:107:508:653:144:Times:144:Times:?:Estimates of the effect of prescription drug insurance coverage on any drug use are 
18:403:31266:27:28:71:534:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:displayed in Table 3 and show that drug coverage had a positive effect on any drug use. Elderly 
18:404:31362:28:28:71:495:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:people with public coverage were 8.7 percentage points more likely to have at least one 
18:405:31450:28:27:71:528:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:prescription than those with no coverage. Those with employer-sponsored and HMO coverage 
18:406:31539:27:28:71:530:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:had a 4.5 percentage point greater probability of having a prescription filled than those without 
18:407:31637:28:27:71:528:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurance.  Finally, for those with Medigap, the probability of at least one prescription was 1.9 
18:408:31735:27:28:71:521:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:percentage points greater than those with no coverage. Adding health indicators to the model 
18:409:31828:28:28:71:511:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:(column 3) had little effect on estimates for HMO and Medigap coverage, but significantly 
18:410:31918:28:27:71:528:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:reduced estimates of public and employer coverage.  This finding suggests that cross-sectional 
18:411:32013:27:28:71:236:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates are likely to be biased.   
18:412:32050:28:27:107:531:377:144:Times:144:Times:?:Columns 4 and 5 present the fixed-effects estimates.  Coefficients on the drug coverage 
18:413:32138:27:28:71:540:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:variables decreased significantly relative to estimates in columns 1 and 2.  Estimates in column 4 
18:414:32237:28:27:71:524:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:are small (close to zero) and are no longer statistically significant. Further, we did not see any 
18:415:32336:27:28:71:528:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:difference in coefficients between column 4 and 5, when measures of health were added to the 
18:416:32429:28:28:71:530:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:fixed-effect models. This suggests that much of the selection into insurance status is accounted 
18:417:32526:28:27:71:533:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:for by including controls for person-specific fixed-effects and lends support to the credibility of 
18:418:32626:27:28:71:194:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:our fixed-effects results.  
18:419:32654:28:27:107:485:184:144:Times:144:Times:?:Table 4 displays estimates of the effect of drug coverage on annual number of 
18:420:32732:27:28:71:529:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:prescriptions. Estimates in column 2 indicate that public coverage increased prescription drugs 
18:421:32828:28:28:71:526:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:use by 46.7%, employer-sponsored coverage increased it by 19.7%, HMO coverage by 14.7% 
18:422:32915:28:0:71:532:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Medigap increased utilization by 17% relative to the uninsured. Adding measures of health 
19:423:33011:0:27:71:512:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:(column 3) had little effect on estimates, except for public coverage.  In general, the results 
19:424:33107:27:28:71:526:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:indicated very high utilization among those insured and are similar to previous cross-sectional 
19:425:33203:28:27:71:505:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:findings (Bluestein, 2000; Federman et al., 2001). Controlling for individual fixed-effects 
19:426:33295:27:28:71:541:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:revealed a different story. Here, at best, prescription drug coverage has only a moderate effect on 
19:427:33395:28:28:71:497:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:utilization. Public coverage increased annual number of prescriptions by 13.7%. Having 
19:428:33482:28:27:71:517:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:employer sponsored or HMO coverage increased the annual number of prescriptions by 6%. 
19:429:33569:27:28:71:541:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:Medigap coverage had no significant impact on prescription use.  Adding measures of health had 
19:430:33664:28:27:71:496:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:no effect on fixed-effect estimates bolstering the plausibility for our research approach.  
19:431:33756:27:28:107:539:488:144:Times:144:Times:?:Table 5 presents estimates of the effect of drug coverage on hospitalization.  Estimates in 
19:432:33848:28:28:71:521:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:column 2 indicate that elderly with public insurance coverage are 6.3 percentage points more 
19:433:33941:28:27:71:523:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:likely to have a hospitalization than those without insurance.  This is a large effect and, as we 
19:434:34039:27:28:71:525:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:will see, primarily a selection effect.  Those with Medigap and employer-sponsored insurance 
19:435:34132:28:27:71:534:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:also have higher rates of hospitalization than the uninsured, but for these people the coefficients 
19:436:34232:27:28:71:539:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:are small—1 to 1.4 percentage points.  Adding health status to the model (column 3) reduced the 
19:437:34328:28:27:71:525:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:effect of public insurance coverage on hospitalization significantly, and fixed-effect estimates 
19:438:34425:27:28:71:543:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:indicated that prescription drug coverage had no statistically significant effect on hospitalization.  
19:439:34528:28:28:71:493:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:Most fixed-effect estimates are small relative to the mean; public insurance coverage is 
19:440:34617:28:27:71:532:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:associated with the largest effect, 2.3 percentage point, which is approximately 9% of the mean 
19:441:34713:27:28:71:470:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the uninsured.  Overall, estimates in Table 5 suggest that prescription drugs and 
19:442:34798:28:27:71:348:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:hospitalization, if related, are complementary treatments. 
19:443:34857:27:28:107:524:157:144:Times:144:Times:?:The next set of tables (Tables 6-8), display estimates of the effect of drug coverage on 
19:444:34946:28:28:71:522:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:health, as measured by: poor health status, functional disability (ADL plus IADL), individual 
19:445:35040:28:0:71:528:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:measures of ADL and IADL. Table 6 shows the effect of prescription drug insurance coverage 
20:446:35133:0:27:71:518:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:on probability of being in poor health.  Estimates from models without person specific fixed-
20:447:35226:27:28:71:535:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:effect suggest that public prescription drug coverage was associated with a higher probability of 
20:448:35324:28:27:71:520:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:poor health and that HMO coverage was associated with a lower probability of being in poor 
20:449:35415:27:28:71:514:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:health.  Adding the number of chronic conditions reduced the magnitude of the estimate for 
20:450:35506:28:28:71:536:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:public coverage. Controlling for person-specific fixed-effects, however, reduced these estimates 
20:451:35603:28:27:71:533:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:greatly and they were no longer statistically significant.  Notably, adding the number of chronic 
20:452:35701:27:28:71:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:conditions to the fixed-effect model had no effect on the estimates of drug coverage. There is 
20:453:35796:28:27:71:479:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:little evidence that prescription drug coverage is related to self-reported poor health. 
20:454:35885:27:28:107:526:488:144:Times:144:Times:?:Tables 7 and 8 present estimates of the effect of drug coverage on functional disability 
20:455:35974:28:28:71:539:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:(ADL plus IADL score in Table 7) and individual IADL and ADL items (Table 8). Here, we just 
20:456:36066:28:27:71:503:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:discuss the fixed-effect estimates and only fixed-effect estimates are reported in Table 8.  
20:457:36159:27:28:71:533:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:Estimates in Tables 7 and 8 provide little evidence that prescription drug coverage is associated 
20:458:36257:28:27:71:492:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:with an improvement in ADL or IADL conditions except for those in the HMO group.  
20:459:36339:27:28:71:541:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:Prescription drug coverage through a Medicare HMO is associated with approximately 8% fewer 
20:460:36431:28:27:71:516:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:functional disabilities.  The average score (ADL plus IADL) for uninsured people was 1.53; 
20:461:36522:27:28:71:533:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:therefore, drug coverage through a Medicare HMO would be expected to decrease it by 0.13. A 
20:462:36614:28:28:71:512:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:similar positive, yet small, impact of HMO coverage was observed for individual ADL and 
20:463:36702:28:27:71:520:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:IADL items (Table 8). Those with HMO coverage experienced reduced disability in bathing, 
20:464:36791:27:28:71:526:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:dressing, getting out of chair, and heavy housework. Estimates remain similar when we added 
20:465:36883:28:27:71:325:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:measures of health to the model (results not shown).

21:468:36991:27:28:107:539:681:144:Times:144:Times:?: It is of interest to investigate whether prescription drug coverage has a different effect for 
21:469:37086:28:27:71:513:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:economically disadvantaged individuals. Economically disadvantaged individuals are more 
21:470:37174:27:28:71:540:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:likely to be in poor health and in greatest need of medical care. Prescription drug coverage might 
21:471:37273:28:28:71:541:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:be more beneficial to them compared to other groups who can still purchase prescription drugs in 
21:472:37370:28:27:71:539:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:the absence of insurance. For example, the RAND Health Insurance Experiment did not find any 
21:473:37463:27:28:71:499:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:effect of health insurance on the health of the general population, but the study indicated 
21:474:37555:28:27:71:538:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:reduction in blood pressure for low-income population with poor health status (Brook, Lynch, & 
21:475:37650:27:28:71:508:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:Riley, 1983). Hence, the effect of prescription drug coverage was assessed for a sample of 
21:476:37741:28:28:71:511:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:elderly with no high school education—the group most likely to be in poor health and with 
21:477:37831:28:27:71:524:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:limited incomes. In general, the results for this group (not shown) were similar to the analysis 
21:478:37928:27:28:71:530:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:using the entire sample. Drug coverage had a positive impact on utilization, and controlling for 
21:479:38025:28:27:71:485:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:person-specific fixed-effects reduced the magnitudes of the estimates but they remain 
21:480:38111:27:28:71:537:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:statistically significant.  Estimates for the low-educated sample suggested a slightly larger effect 
21:481:38212:28:27:71:524:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:for public coverage and smaller effect for employer-sponsored coverage. For example, results 
21:482:38305:27:28:71:490:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:from fixed-effect analyses indicated that public coverage among the low-educated was 
21:483:38390:28:28:71:527:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:associated with 15% increase in annual number of prescriptions; compared with 13.7% for the 
21:484:38482:28:27:71:508:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:entire sample. There was no significant impact of drug coverage on health for this sample.

21:488:38621:14:27:107:535:170:144:Times:144:Times:?: The fixed-effect analysis assumes that, in the absence of any change in prescription drug 
21:489:38711:27:28:71:527:143:144:Times:144:Times:B:coverage, changes in prescription drug use and health would be the same for those who switch 
21:490:38804:28:27:71:519:115:144:Times:144:Times:B:coverage as those who do not switch coverage.  To assess the validity of this assumption, we 
21:491:38897:27:0:71:530:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:examined the trend in prescription drug use pre- and post-switching insurance status for people 
22:492:38995:0:27:71:540:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:who gain coverage (True Switchers), people who never have coverage (Nevers), and people who 
22:493:39087:27:28:71:533:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:always have coverage (Always).  For those who did not switch insurance (Always and Nevers), 
22:494:39179:28:27:71:523:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:we randomly assign them a (pseudo) switch year.  Figure 5 displays these trends.  The X-axis 
22:495:39272:27:28:71:537:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:indexes time prior to and after the switch of insurance; zero represents the switch year and years 
22:496:39371:28:28:71:506:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:pre- and post-switch are labeled accordingly.  The Y-axis is the average annual number of 
22:497:39461:28:27:71:513:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:prescriptions filled. One year prior to switch (-2 to -1), prescription drug use was rising in a 
22:498:39558:27:28:71:521:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:similar way for all groups.  In the year of the switch (-1 to 0), prescription drug use increased 
22:499:39656:28:27:71:522:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:more rapidly for switchers than non-switchers.  In the year subsequent to switching (0-1), the 
22:500:39751:27:28:71:517:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:trend in prescription drug use is again about the same for switchers and non-switchers.  This 
22:501:39845:28:28:71:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:pattern supports the fixed-effect approach because it shows that in the absence of a change in 
22:502:39940:28:27:71:523:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurance status, trends in prescription drug use are the same for those who switch and do not 
22:503:40035:27:28:71:493:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:switch insurance status.  We show a similar figure (Figure 6) for the number of chronic 
22:504:40123:28:27:71:508:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:conditions.  In this case, there is some evidence that the trend in chronic conditions differs 
22:505:40218:27:28:71:528:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:slightly for those who gain insurance after the switch.  In the year of the switch, the number of 
22:506:40316:28:27:71:526:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:chronic conditions increased more for those who switched than for those who did not switch.   
22:507:40410:27:28:107:502:295:144:Times:144:Times:?: To further assess whether the fixed-effect approach is valid, we estimated models 
22:508:40492:28:28:71:505:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:identical to those in Tables 3 through 8, using all observations for non-switchers and only 
22:509:40584:28:27:71:535:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:observations on switchers in years prior to switching.  We randomly assign those who were true 
22:510:40679:27:28:71:510:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:switchers a pseudo-switch year—a year in which they supposedly gained prescription drug 
22:511:40767:28:27:71:532:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:coverage. If switchers and non-switchers have similar trends in outcomes, we would expect the 
22:512:40861:27:28:71:518:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:coefficient on this pseudo insurance coverage variable to be zero, which is exactly what was 
22:513:40954:28:0:71:504:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:found for all outcomes (prescription drug use, hospitalization, poor health, and number of 
23:514:41047:0:27:71:540:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:chronic conditions).  In summary, a variety of specification tests provide strong evidence that the 
23:515:41147:27:28:71:487:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:fixed-effect design is valid and that estimates could plausibly be interpreted as causal. 
23:516:41237:28:27:107:509:653:144:Times:144:Times:?:Given that statistical analyses indicated that changes in prescription drug insurance 
23:517:41323:27:28:71:530:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:coverage appeared to be exogenous (random), conditional on measured covariates and controls 
23:518:41415:28:28:71:500:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:for time-invariant person-specific effects, a natural question to ask is why?  What are the 
23:519:41507:28:27:71:524:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:exogenous factors that caused people to switch insurance coverage?  There are a few possible 
23:520:41600:27:28:71:534:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:explanations.  One factor is the expansion of Medicaid eligibility thresholds (Bruen et al., 1999, 
23:521:41699:28:27:71:540:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:2003; Stone and Yacker, 2002; Schneider et al., 1999). There was also a significant expansion of 
23:522:41796:27:28:71:538:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs (PAP) across states. In 1992, only 19 states had some form 
23:523:41890:28:28:71:537:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:of PAP program by 2000 almost all states had included some form of drug coverage to their low 
23:524:41984:28:27:71:540:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:income elderly who did not qualify for Medicaid. These changes might account for switches into 
23:525:42079:27:28:71:257:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:public coverage observed in Table 2.   
23:526:42118:28:27:107:545:377:144:Times:144:Times:?:Expansion of Medicare managed care might account for some of the changes in coverage.  
23:527:42205:27:28:71:497:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:Between 1996 and 1999, enrollment in Medicare risk plan (e.g., HMO) increased by 5.1 
23:528:42290:28:27:71:532:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:percentage points (Laschober, et al., 2002). However, the 1997 Balanced Budget Act decreased 
23:529:42383:27:28:71:507:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:payments to MCOs and, as a result, many MCOs either terminated or reduced the benefits 
23:530:42470:28:28:71:526:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:provided (Pizer and Frakt, 2002; Booske et al. 2002).  Those disenrolled and living in areas of 
23:531:42566:28:27:71:516:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:low managed care penetration were more likely to enroll in Medigap plans (Laschober et al. 
23:532:42657:27:28:71:207:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:1999; Booske et al. 2002).   
23:533:42686:28:27:107:530:184:144:Times:144:Times:?:For those who gained employer coverage, data from the MCBS indicated that some did 
23:534:42769:27:28:71:535:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:so through their spouses or by starting employment.  Many picked up drug coverage subsequent 
23:535:42862:28:28:71:533:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:to retirement.  A Kaiser/Hewitt 2002 Retiree Health Survey reported that 16% of the employers 
23:536:42956:28:0:71:539:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the survey provided options for stand-alone drug plans or discount cards (KFF, 2002).  Hence, 
24:537:43055:0:27:71:532:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:some employees could be expected to pick-up prescription drug benefits at a later time. Results 
24:538:43151:27:28:71:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:from the same survey indicated that many employers had increased drug co-payments, which 
24:539:43240:28:27:71:500:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:could results in employee’s withdrawing from those plans.  Overall, there appeared to be 
24:540:43329:27:28:71:511:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:plausible explanations for the statistical finding that switches in prescription drug coverage 
24:541:43424:28:28:71:513:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:appear to be exogenous, conditional on measured covariates and controls for time-invariant 
24:542:43515:28:27:71:185:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:person-specific effects. 
24:543:43540:27:28:107:110:543:144:Times:144:Times:?: 
24:544:43540:28:27:71:135:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:Conclusions 
24:545:43552:27:28:107:516:488:144:Times:144:Times:?:January 1, 2006 was a historical day for the elderly in the United States. For the first 
24:546:43641:28:28:71:527:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:time, a drug benefit became part of the Medicare program. The program is estimated to have a 
24:547:43734:28:27:71:532:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:net cost of $593 billion over a 10-year period (CBO, 2005). However, very little is known as to 
24:548:43830:27:28:71:514:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:what can be expected from this expansion as there is little research examining the effects of 
24:549:43924:28:27:71:531:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:prescription drug coverage on prescription drug use, medical care use, and health of the elderly 
24:550:44021:27:28:71:482:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:that can be considered “causal”. In this study, we have tried to address this shortfall.  
24:551:44111:28:27:107:531:322:144:Times:144:Times:?:Several studies have indicated that the elderly skip doses or do not fill prescriptions due 
24:552:44203:27:28:71:508:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:to cost (Steinman et al., 2001; Kitchman et al., 2002; Saver et al., 2004). For these elderly, 
24:553:44298:28:28:71:514:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurance can help because it decreases the price of the drugs, making them accessible. The 
24:554:44390:28:27:71:508:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:results of this study indicated that drug coverage increased drug use and thereby improved 
24:555:44481:27:28:71:525:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:access. However, the magnitude of the effect of drug coverage on utilization was smaller than 
24:556:44575:28:27:71:511:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:that found in most previous studies.  Public insurance coverage increased prescription drug 
24:557:44667:27:28:71:533:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:utilization by 14%, and employer-sponsored and Medicare HMO coverage increased utilization 
24:558:44758:28:28:71:542:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:by 6%. These estimates were statistically significant. Medigap prescription drug coverage did not 
24:559:44856:28:0:71:504:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:have any significant effect on prescription drug use.  These results are consistent with the 
25:560:44951:0:27:71:526:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:generosity of these different insurance plans.  Medicaid is the most generous and Medigap the 
25:561:45045:27:28:71:148:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:least generous.  
25:562:45062:28:27:107:532:653:144:Times:144:Times:?:Did the greater use of prescription drugs associated with insurance improved health and 
25:563:45150:27:28:71:533:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:lower rates of hospitalization?  Generally, we found the answer to this question to be “no.”  We 
25:564:45247:28:28:71:532:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:did not find consistent evidence that prescription drugs are a substitute for hospitalization.  Nor 
25:565:45347:28:27:71:511:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:did we find much evidence that prescription drug coverage improved health and functional 
25:566:45436:27:28:71:514:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:disability.  The lone exception was prescription drug coverage obtained through a Medicare 
25:567:45527:28:27:71:500:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:HMO.  In this case, prescription drug coverage was associated with improved functional 
25:568:45614:27:28:71:452:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:disability.  Similar results were obtained for a sample of low-educated people.  
25:569:45695:28:28:107:509:460:144:Times:144:Times:?:Perhaps it is to be expected that prescription drug insurance would have few health 
25:570:45779:28:27:71:527:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:benefits given that prescription drug coverage had relatively small effects on prescription drug 
25:571:45876:27:28:71:510:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:use.  Alternatively, absence of effect could be due to inappropriate pharmacotherapy either 
25:572:45968:28:27:71:504:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:because of excess unnecessary utilization that could even be harmful or non-adherence to 
25:573:46057:27:28:71:530:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:therapy on the part of consumers (Budnitz et al., 2006; Zhan et al. 2001; Lazarou, Pomeranz & 
25:574:46151:28:27:71:527:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:Corey, 1998). We also acknowledge the limitations of our data in estimating the effect of drug 
25:575:46246:27:28:71:521:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:coverage on health. Perhaps, more appropriate measures of health would be intermediate and 
25:576:46337:28:28:71:504:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:disease specific health outcomes such as reduction in HbA1c for diabetic patients or blood 
25:577:46428:28:27:72:243:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:pressure for hypertensive patients.  
25:578:46465:27:28:108:525:212:144:Times:144:Times:?:So what do these results imply about the benefits of Medicare Part D?  It is difficult to 
25:579:46555:28:27:72:507:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimate the actual impact of Medicare Part D from this study because the program has co-
25:580:46644:27:28:72:534:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:payments and an expenditure range during which coverage is not provided. Based on the results 
25:581:46738:28:28:72:524:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:of fixed-effect analysis, one would expect to observe a relatively small increase in utilization, 
25:582:46836:28:0:72:537:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:particularly because Part D is not very generous.  For example, a 6% increase, which is what we 
26:583:46934:0:27:71:482:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:found for employer-sponsored insurance would result in an increase of 6 to 9 million 
26:584:47019:27:28:71:417:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:prescriptions annually, provided all uninsured avail of the new benefit.  
26:585:47093:28:27:107:500:653:144:Times:144:Times:?:The analysis also has implications for medication therapy management programs 
26:586:47171:27:28:71:534:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:(MTMP) introduced as a part of MMA (CCH, 2003).  It is believed that efficacy of prescription 
26:587:47265:28:28:71:535:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:drugs depends on proper prescribing and compliance to medication. Under MMA, the providers 
26:588:47356:28:27:71:519:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:of drug coverage are required to establish an MTMP for seriously ill beneficiaries. The basic 
26:589:47450:27:28:71:535:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:premise is to improve therapeutic outcomes and reduce adverse event by monitoring medication 
26:590:47543:28:27:71:507:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:use, coordinating therapy, and providing education and training on drug use. Indeed, prior 
26:591:47634:27:28:71:518:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:research supports that intervention by health care providers improves clinical, economic and 
26:592:47727:28:28:71:515:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:humanistic outcomes (Buntig & Cranor 2006). Our finding of no effect of drug coverage on 
26:593:47816:28:27:71:524:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:health suggests simply providing drug coverage might not be sufficient to improve health and 
26:594:47909:27:28:71:363:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:that other interventions such as MTMP might be necessary.

27:607:47979:7:16:72:516:692:42:Times:100:Times:F:1 We also experimented with instrumental variables approach.  However, the instruments (Medicaid eligibility 
27:608:48088:16:12:71:534:676:100:Times:100:Times:F:thresholds, managed care payment rates, employer characteristics) while statistically significant in first stage, were 
27:609:48207:12:7:71:360:664:100:Times:100:Times:F:weak and second stage estimates were too imprecise to be informative.  
27:610:48278:7:16:72:496:657:42:Times:100:Times:F:2 The negative binomial model is not a true fixed effect model. It does not fully eliminate the influence of 
27:611:48387:16:7:71:341:641:100:Times:100:Times:F:unmeasured personal characteristics (Allison & Waterman, 2000).  
27:612:48452:7:16:72:506:634:42:Times:100:Times:F:3 To adjust Poisson standard errors, Allison and Waterman (2000) and Wooldridge (2002) suggest adjusting 
27:613:48557:16:11:71:523:618:100:Times:100:Times:F:standard errors using deviance statistics.  Specifically, the method multiplies the standard error from the Poisson 
27:614:48673:11:7:71:528:607:100:Times:100:Times:F:regression by the square root of the ratio of Pearson chi-square goodness of fit statistics to its degrees of freedom. 
27:615:48792:7:16:72:542:600:42:Times:100:Times:F:4 These are 5,250 individuals whom MCBS label as “ghosts”. Ghosts are individuals who enter the survey in the fall; 
27:616:48908:16:12:72:530:584:100:Times:100:Times:F:these individuals are reassigned identification numbers next year. However as these ghosts identification numbers 
27:617:49022:12:11:72:522:572:100:Times:100:Times:F:were reused in the initials years of surveys, it becomes difficult to follow these individuals. Moreover, as ghosts 
27:618:49138:11:12:72:527:561:100:Times:100:Times:F:enter the survey in the fall they only have part year information available, therefore it was decided to remove this 
27:619:49255:12:11:72:528:549:100:Times:100:Times:F:part year information from the analysis. In addition, elderly who died during the interview year, their information 
27:620:49371:11:7:72:265:538:100:Times:100:Times:F:was not used for that year (4,842 observations). 
27:621:49420:7:16:72:537:531:42:Times:100:Times:F:5 These people will drop out of fixed effects analyses.  However, dropping them from all analyses does not alter the 
27:622:49537:16:7:71:102:515:100:Times:100:Times:F:results. 
27:623:49546:7:16:72:542:508:42:Times:100:Times:F:6 In defining drug coverage from public sources, if the individual reports coverage from either Medicaid or any other 
27:624:49664:16:12:71:529:492:100:Times:100:Times:F:public source besides Medicare, it was assumed that the supplemental coverage provides drug coverage. This was 
27:625:49775:12:11:71:540:480:100:Times:100:Times:F:done because specific drug coverage was not asked when persons reported Medicaid coverage.  The vast majority of 
27:626:49888:11:7:71:290:469:100:Times:100:Times:F:those on Medicaid have drug coverage (DHHS 2000). 
27:627:49938:7:16:72:519:462:42:Times:100:Times:F:7 We also constructed alternative measures of drug coverage using five mutually exclusive categories that were 
27:628:50049:16:12:72:527:446:100:Times:100:Times:F:created based on the proportion of coverage in a year.  For instance, if the person reported Medicaid coverage for 
27:629:50164:12:11:71:506:434:100:Times:100:Times:F:five months but had no coverage for the other seven months this person was assigned to “no drug coverage” 
27:630:50270:11:12:71:530:423:100:Times:100:Times:F:category.  All analyses were done with this alternative set of variables and results were virtually the same as those 
27:631:50388:12:7:71:157:411:100:Times:100:Times:F:presented in the text. 
27:632:50411:7:16:72:531:404:42:Times:100:Times:F:8 The standard errors, presented were calculated using the balanced repeated replication weights provided with the

27:634:50634:11:12:71:529:377:100:Times:100:Times:F:replication weights. Estimates were calculated using both the full sample weight and each of the replicate weights

27:637:50910:7:16:72:532:347:42:Times:100:Times:F:9 In the period from 1999-2000 a slight drop in employer sponsored coverage can be observed, which is consistent 
27:638:51023:16:12:71:533:331:100:Times:100:Times:F:with reports in prior studies (William Mercer Inc. 2001; Stuart, Singhal et al. 2003). However, a more recent study 
27:639:51139:12:11:71:532:319:100:Times:100:Times:F:by Kaiser Family Foundation (2005) reported only 18% uninsured in 2002. Hence, it appears that the overall trend 
27:640:51252:11:0:71:318:308:100:Times:100:Times:F:in drug coverage continued to increase even after year 2000.
