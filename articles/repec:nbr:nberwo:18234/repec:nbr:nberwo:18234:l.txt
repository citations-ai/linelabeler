2:33:1881:28:28:273:338:615:144:Times:144:Times:C:ABSTRACT
2:34:1889:28:14:72:540:587:136:g_d0_f1:136:g_d0_f1:F:We study the competitive forces that shaped ideological diversity in the US press in the early twentieth
2:35:1993:14:14:72:540:573:138:g_d0_f1:138:g_d0_f1:F:century. We find that households preferred like-minded news and that newspapers used their political
2:36:2093:14:14:72:540:559:138:g_d0_f1:138:g_d0_f1:F:orientation to differentiate from competitors. We formulate a model of newspaper demand, entry, and
2:37:2192:14:14:72:540:545:142:g_d0_f1:142:g_d0_f1:F:political affiliation choice in which newspapers compete for both readers and advertisers. We use a
2:38:2291:14:14:72:540:531:130:g_d0_f1:130:g_d0_f1:F:combination of estimation and calibration to identify the model’s parameters from novel data on newspaper
2:39:2396:14:14:72:540:517:140:g_d0_f1:140:g_d0_f1:F:circulation, costs, and revenues. The estimated model implies that competition enhances ideological
2:40:2495:14:14:72:540:503:132:g_d0_f1:132:g_d0_f1:F:diversity, that the market undersupplies diversity, and that optimal competition policy requires accounting
2:41:2602:14:42:72:272:489:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:for the two-sidedness of the news market.

3:64:3103:0:27:72:171:709:206:Times:206:Times:C:1  Introduction
3:65:3118:27:15:72:540:682:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:Decentralized  markets  may not  supply  the socially  optimal  variety  of products  (Steiner  1952;  Dixit  and
3:66:3231:15:16:72:540:667:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:Stiglitz 1977;  Mankiw and Whinston 1986).  This is especially true of the news media, because diversity
3:67:3335:16:15:72:539:651:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:of  news and opinion  can have  beneficial  effects  on political  competition  that  are not  internalized  by the
3:68:3450:15:15:72:540:636:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:market participants (Becker 1958; Downs 1957). According to the US Supreme Court, “the widest possible
3:69:3552:15:16:72:540:621:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources is essential to the welfare of the public”
3:70:3661:16:15:72:253:605:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:(Associated Press v. United States, 1945).
3:71:3703:15:15:88:539:590:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:Competition  policy  toward media has long been shaped  by the perceived  importance  of these  politi-
3:72:3806:15:16:72:540:575:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:cal externalities.  The Postal Act of 1792 created massive subsidies for newspaper distribution (Kielbowicz
3:73:3913:16:15:72:540:559:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:1983,  1990).1Joint operating agreements,  in which newspapers effectively colluded on subscription  and
3:74:4017:15:15:71:539:544:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:advertising sales but remained editorially separate, began in 1933 and later became a legislated exception to
3:75:4126:15:15:71:539:529:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:the Sherman Act (Busterna and Picard 1993).2The Communications Act of 1934 empowered the Federal
3:76:4222:15:16:72:540:514:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:Communications Commission to limit concentration of control over broadcast spectrum (Candeub 2007).
3:77:4321:16:15:72:540:498:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:Concerns about diversity of viewpoints played a major role in the federal antitrust action against the As-
3:78:4427:15:15:72:540:483:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:sociated Press, which ended with the 1945 Supreme Court decision quoted above.  Antitrust exemptions,
3:79:4528:15:16:72:493:468:119:g_d0_f1:64:g_d0_f1:B:ownership regulation, and explicit subsidies remain important policies in the US and elsewhere.3
3:80:4624:16:15:88:539:452:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:We present a historical study of the economic forces that determine ideological diversity, and the impact
3:81:4729:15:15:72:540:437:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:of policies  designed  to increase  it,  using  novel  data from  US daily  newspapers  in 1924.   In this  period,
3:82:4844:15:16:72:540:422:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:hundreds of cities across the country had multiple competing papers, affording us a large cross-section of
3:83:4950:16:15:72:540:406:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:experiments  that  can  be used  to identify  competitive  interactions.   Most  newspapers  had current  or  past
3:84:5064:15:15:72:539:391:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:affiliations with either the Republican or Democratic party, providing a convenient proxy for the political
3:85:5171:15:16:72:540:376:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:slant of their content (Gentzkow et al. 2006; Hamilton 2006).  Ideology was one of the main dimensions of
3:86:5276:16:15:72:540:360:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:differentiation along which competitive lines were drawn. Television had not been introduced, and radio was
3:87:5383:15:15:72:540:345:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:still in its infancy, so newspapers were for most Americans the only source of daily political information.
3:88:5490:15:15:72:540:330:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:Whether a given town had only Republican papers, only Democratic papers, or papers spanning both sides
3:89:5592:15:16:72:540:315:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:of the political spectrum thus had a dramatic effect on the range of views to which its voters were exposed
3:90:5699:16:15:72:159:299:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:(Galvis et al. 2012).
3:91:5720:15:15:88:539:284:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:We model  newspaper  competition  in this period in a framework that  endogenizes  decisions  over en-
3:92:5822:15:16:72:540:269:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:try, political orientation, subscription prices and advertising rates.  The model embeds Gentzkow’s (2007)
3:93:5928:16:15:72:540:253:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:multiple-discrete-choice demand framework in a sequential entry game in the spirit of Bresnahan and Reiss
3:94:6033:15:15:72:539:238:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:(1991) and Mazzeo (2002).  In the model, newspapersfirst decide whether to enter the market, then choose
3:95:6137:15:16:72:539:223:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:either Republican or Democratic affiliation, taking into account household demand, the responses of other
3:96:6242:16:22:72:539:207:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:entering newspapers, and the effect of affiliation choice on subscription and advertising prices.  The model
3:97:6350:22:14:87:539:185:49:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:1Under the 1792 act, a four-page letter cost one dollar to mail 450 miles; a newspaper of the same size cost one and a half
3:98:6473:14:11:71:539:171:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:cents (Kielbowicz 1983).  Debate over the details of the subsidy concerned, among other things, the appropriate diversity of news
3:99:6602:11:8:72:334:160:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:provision from local and national sources (Kielbowicz 1983; John 2009).
3:100:6673:8:14:87:540:152:49:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:2The Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970, which established the antitrust exemption for joint operating agreements, states its
3:101:6798:14:8:72:539:138:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:goal as “maintaining a newspaper press editorially and reportorially independent and competitive in all parts of the United States.”
3:102:6930:8:15:87:539:130:49:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:3House Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently asked Attorney General Eric Holder to consider First Amendment issues when deciding
3:103:7050:15:11:72:539:115:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:antitrust enforcement for local newspaper  consolidation (Pelosi 2009).  The Federal Communications  Commission continues to
3:104:7174:11:11:72:540:104:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:regulate  broadcast  media  ownership  “on  the  theory  that  diversification  of  mass  media  ownership  serves  the  public  interest  by
3:105:7315:11:11:72:540:93:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:promoting diversity of program and service viewpoints” (FCC 2010).  The proposed Newspaper Revitalization Act would grant
3:106:7436:11:11:72:539:82:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:newspapers an implicit federal subsidy in the form of nonprofit status (Priest 2011).  Explicit subsidies to the press are common in
3:107:7568:11:0:72:166:71:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:Europe (Murschetz 1998).
4:108:7593:0:16:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:allows households  to exhibit  a preference  for newspapers  whose ideology  matches their  own,  and to re-
4:109:7701:16:15:72:539:693:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:gard  newspapers  with the  same political  affiliation  as more  substitutable  than  newspapers  with different
4:110:7814:15:15:72:539:678:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:affiliations.  The advertising model is stylized, but it captures the key prediction from the theory literature
4:111:7925:15:16:72:540:663:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:on two-sided markets that advertising-market competition depends on the extent of overlap in newspapers’

4:113:8106:15:15:88:539:632:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:Our key results hinge on the strength of newspapers’ incentives to differentiate ideologically from their
4:114:8211:15:16:72:540:617:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:competitors.   In our  model,  these  incentives  are governed  by two parameters.   First,  they depend  on the
4:115:8323:16:15:72:540:601:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:extent  to  which  same-affiliation  newspapers  are  closer  substitutes  than  opposite-affiliation  papers.   This
4:116:8440:15:15:72:540:586:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:determines the gains to differentiation  through standard Hotelling channels.  Second,  they depend on the
4:117:8546:15:16:72:540:571:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:extent of diminishing returns to impressions in the advertising market. This determines the overall intensity
4:118:8655:16:15:72:508:555:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:of advertising competition, and thus the incentive to differentiate in order to soften this competition.
4:119:8759:15:15:88:539:540:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:To estimate the demand side of the model, we use data on 1924 daily newspaper circulation by town.
4:120:8857:15:15:72:540:525:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:These  data  allow  us  to  compare  the  circulation  of  a given  newspaper  across  many towns  with  differing
4:121:8971:15:16:72:540:510:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:ideology.  Descriptive analysis shows that a 10 percentage point increase in a town’s Republican vote share
4:122:9078:16:15:72:540:494:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:increases circulation of Republican papers relative to Democratic papers by 10 percent. This fact pins down
4:123:9185:15:15:72:539:479:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:consumers’ taste for like-minded news in our model. The relative substitutability of same-affiliation papers
4:124:9293:15:16:72:540:464:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:is  identified  by  variation  in  relative  circulation  with  respect  to  the  number  of  papers  of  each  type.   We
4:125:9415:16:15:72:540:448:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f1:B:find that adding a second Republican paper to a town with one Republican and one Democratic newspaper
4:126:9516:15:15:72:409:433:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:reduces the relative circulation of the existing Republican paper by 4 percent.
4:127:9595:15:16:88:539:418:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:We calibrate several model parameters.  Because we do not have price instruments we believe are cred-
4:128:9696:16:15:72:540:402:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:ible, we estimate the price coefficient by imposing the assumption that observed prices satisfyfirms’first
4:129:9802:15:15:72:540:387:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:order conditions.  Because our circulation data do not record overlap in the readership of different papers,
4:130:9910:15:16:72:540:372:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:we calibrate  the overlap  predicted  by our  model  to match that  observed  in a set  of historical  readership
4:131:10023:16:15:72:540:356:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:surveys.  We calibrate marginal costs and advertisers’ willingness to pay to match historical data for a set
4:132:10131:15:15:72:540:341:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:of representative newspapers. Large markups over marginal costs and significant overlap in readership both
4:133:10237:15:16:72:336:326:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:suggest that newspapers were highly differentiated products.
4:134:10297:16:15:88:540:310:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:To estimate the entry,  affiliation choice,  and advertising parameters of the model, we use data on the
4:135:10401:15:15:72:539:295:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:order of entry and observed affiliations in each 1924 newspaper market. Controlling for the fraction Repub-
4:136:10508:15:15:72:540:280:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:lican, our descriptive analysis suggests that adding an additional Republican incumbent reduces an entering
4:137:10615:15:16:72:539:265:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:paper’s likelihood of choosing a Republican affiliation by 15 percentage points. This relationship identifies
4:138:10724:16:15:71:539:249:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:the strength of differentiation incentives overall. Since the demand estimates pin down the Hotelling portion
4:139:10833:15:15:71:539:234:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:of these incentives, the residual is attributed in our model to diminishing returns to advertising.  The rela-
4:140:10943:15:16:71:539:219:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:tionship between population and the observed number offirms identifies the parameters of the distribution

4:142:11062:15:15:88:540:188:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:An  important  concern  is  that  the  correlations  we  exploit  for  identification  may  be  confounded  with
4:143:11174:15:16:71:539:173:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:unobserved variation in consumer ideology or preferences, biasing downward the estimated incentive to dif-
4:144:11280:16:15:71:539:157:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:ferentiate and the estimated substitutability of same-affiliation newspapers (Aguirregabiria and Nevo 2013).
4:145:11388:15:15:71:539:142:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:We address these issues by allowing explicitly for unobserved variation in household ideology, using a novel
4:146:11496:15:16:71:539:127:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:identification strategy that exploits correlation across markets that are close enough to share similar char-
4:147:11605:16:15:71:539:111:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:acteristics but far enough apart that their newspapers do not compete.  We assume in the spirit of Murphy
4:148:11710:15:15:71:539:96:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:and Topel (1990) and Altonji et al.  (2005) that the spatial correlation in unobservable dimensions of ideol-
4:149:11819:15:0:71:539:81:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:ogy matches that of observable measures.  The resulting spatial structure allows us to infer the distribution
5:150:11929:0:16:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:of market-level unobservables,  much as panel structure facilitates recovering this distribution  in dynamic
5:151:12037:16:15:72:401:693:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:settings (e.g., Collard-Wexler 2013; see also Arcidiacono and Miller 2011).
5:152:12112:15:15:88:539:678:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:We use the estimated model to measure the importance of competitive forces relative to other incentives
5:153:12215:15:16:72:540:663:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:in shaping the ideological  diversity of the news market.  We measure diversity by the number of markets
5:154:12319:16:15:72:539:647:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:with at least one newspaper affiliated with each party, the share of households living in such markets, and
5:155:12426:15:15:72:539:632:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:the share of households reading at least one newspaper affiliated with each party. Wefind that the incentive
5:156:12534:15:16:72:540:617:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:to differentiate from competitors in order to attract more readers and soften price and advertising competition
5:157:12645:16:15:72:540:601:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:(Mullainathan and Shleifer 2005) increases diversity significantly,  offsetting a strong incentive to cater to
5:158:12755:15:15:72:348:586:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:the tastes of majority consumers (George and Waldfogel 2003).
5:159:12816:15:16:88:539:571:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:Next, we compare the market outcomes to those that would be chosen by a social planner maximizing
5:160:12913:16:15:72:539:555:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:economic welfare, but ignoring any externalities from diversity.  Relative to thefirst best, market entry is
5:161:13021:15:15:72:539:540:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:inefficiently low, market prices are inefficiently high,  and the market incentive to differentiate  politically
5:162:13133:15:15:72:540:525:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:from competitors is inefficiently weak.  Thus, there is no conflict between the policy goals of maximizing
5:163:13239:15:16:72:540:510:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:economic welfare and preserving diversity in the marketplace of ideas.  Policies aimed at the latter goal are
5:164:13348:16:15:72:340:494:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:likely to also be beneficial from the perspective of the former.
5:165:13412:15:15:88:539:479:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:Finally,  we consider  a range of competition policy experiments.   Allowing newspapers to collude on
5:166:13513:15:16:72:540:464:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:circulation prices reduces economic welfare and has mixed effects on diversity. By contrast, allowing news-
5:167:13620:16:15:72:539:448:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:papers to collude onadvertisingprices increases both economic welfare and diversity.  Advertising prices
5:168:13724:15:15:72:540:433:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:rise, leading circulation prices to fall as newspapers compete intensely for readers (Rochet and Tirole 2006;
5:169:13833:15:16:72:544:418:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:Dewenter  et  al.   2011).   Entry  increases  dramatically.   Consumer  surplus  increases,  significant  profitis
5:170:13948:16:15:72:540:402:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:transferred from advertisers to newspapers, and the share of households who read diverse papers increases
5:171:14053:15:15:72:540:387:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:significantly. The contrasting effects of circulation and advertising price collusion highlight the importance
5:172:14163:15:16:72:540:372:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:of accounting for the two-sided nature of media markets in policy evaluation. When we allow newspapers to
5:173:14268:16:15:72:540:356:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:form joint operating agreements and collude on both circulation and advertising prices, diversity increases
5:174:14375:15:15:72:540:341:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:at no cost to economic welfare. We show that joint ownership (in which one entity has the exclusive right to
5:175:14483:15:16:72:540:326:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:open and operate newspapers in a market) reduces welfare and diversity, while an explicit subsidy (modeled
5:176:14589:16:15:72:378:310:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:on the US postal subsidy system) increases both welfare and diversity.
5:177:14659:15:15:88:539:295:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:Throughout our analysis, we treat consumer ideology, as measured by Republican vote shares, as ex-
5:178:14757:15:15:72:539:280:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:ogenous to newspaper affiliations. This decision follows ourfinding in Gentzkow et al. (2011) that the entry
5:179:14865:15:16:72:540:265:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:or exit of a partisan newspaper does not change the expected party vote share.  Importantly,  this assump-
5:180:14971:16:15:72:540:249:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:tion is consistent with large political externalities to ideological diversity.  A newspaper’s party affiliation
5:181:15083:15:15:72:540:234:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:need not affect expected vote shares, since rational voters will take an outlet’s bias into account in updating
5:182:15194:15:16:72:540:219:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:their beliefs (Chiang and Knight 2011).  Yet diverse media may still provide more information in aggregate
5:183:15300:16:15:72:540:203:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:(Anderson and McLaren 2012), making beliefs more correlated with the truth even if though they may not
5:184:15402:15:15:72:540:188:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:change on average.  For example, if Democratic papers report more aggressively on scandals affecting Re-
5:185:15506:15:16:72:540:173:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:publican politicians and vice versa (Gentzkow et al.  2006;  Galvis et al.  2012), having a newspaper from
5:186:15612:16:15:72:540:157:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:each party will tend to maximize the chance that consumers learn about a given scandal. In the supplemental
5:187:15719:15:15:72:390:142:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:appendix to this paper, we offer a formal model that captures these ideas.
5:188:15793:15:16:88:539:127:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:Our work builds on other empirical models of entry and product positioning with explicit demand sys-
5:189:15893:16:15:72:540:111:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:tems (Reiss and Spiller 1989;  Einav 2007 and 2010;  Draganska et al.  2009;  Jeziorski  2012;  Berry et al.

5:191:16102:15:0:72:540:81:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:sumers to choose bundles of products.  Like Fan (2013) and Jeziorski (2012), we include a micro-founded
6:192:16206:0:16:72:539:709:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:model of advertising competition. Along with Berry et al. (2013), we are among thefirst to model both entry
6:193:16313:16:15:72:540:693:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:and product positioning decisions in a two-sided market.  An important difference between our model and
6:194:16416:15:15:72:539:678:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:past work is that we allow for both unobserved market characteristics and idiosyncraticfirm-level shocks,
6:195:16521:15:16:72:539:663:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:introducing  a novel  strategy  to separate  causal  effects  of  onefirm’s choices  on its competitors  from  the

6:197:16682:15:15:88:538:632:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:More  broadly,  our  work  relates  to  a  large  literature  on  entry  and  competition  in  advertising-funded

6:200:16987:15:15:88:539:586:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:Our paper also relates to the theoretical literature on two-sided markets. Most existing theoretical mod-

6:205:17511:15:16:72:539:510:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:product positioning. In this sense ourfindings regarding the efficiency of market equilibrium and the effects

6:207:17709:15:15:88:539:479:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:Finally, our paper is related to research on the incentives that shape the political orientation of the news
6:208:17817:15:16:72:540:464:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:media.4Gentzkow  and  Shapiro  (2010)  use  a similar  framework  to  study  ideological  positioning  of  US
6:209:17926:16:15:72:540:448:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:newspapers in recent years.  Because few modern markets have more than one newspaper,  however, they
6:210:18026:15:15:72:540:433:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:cannot address the impact of competition.  Chiang’s (2010) study of US newspapers is the closest to ours

6:213:18342:15:15:72:539:387:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:andfinds that ideologically extreme households in multi-paper markets are more likely to read a newspaper
6:214:18447:15:16:72:224:372:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:than those in single-paper markets.
6:215:18482:16:15:88:539:356:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the historical data that forms the
6:216:18589:15:15:72:540:341:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:basis of our analysis.  Section 3 discusses the historical context for our data.  Section 4 presents descriptive
6:217:18701:15:16:72:539:326:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:evidence on the determinants of newspaper demand and affiliations and lays out our strategy for estimating
6:218:18807:16:15:72:540:310:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:the incentive to differentiate in the presence of unobserved consumer heterogeneity.  Section 5 lays out our
6:219:18915:15:15:72:539:295:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:model.  Sections 6 and 7 detail the estimation and identification of the demand and supply portions of the
6:220:19021:15:38:72:517:280:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:model, respectively. Section 8 presents estimates and counterfactual simulations. Section 9 concludes.

6:223:19142:22:16:72:540:193:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:We use two main data  sources.   To estimate  the  supply  side  of  our  model  — that  is,  newspapers’  entry
6:224:19254:16:15:72:539:177:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:and affiliation decisions — we use 1924 data on the number, affiliations, and circulation prices of papers
6:225:19360:15:15:72:540:162:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:in a cross-section  of daily newspaper markets.  These data come from newspaper directories,  and have a
6:226:19464:15:16:72:540:147:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:single observation  for each newspaper.  To estimate the demand side of the model,  we use 1924 data on
6:227:19567:16:15:72:540:131:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:the circulation  of each  daily  newspaper  by town.   These data  come from  circulation  reports  newspapers
6:228:19677:15:19:72:540:116:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f1:B:file with an auditing agency, and since the typical newspaper circulates in many towns, they have multiple
6:229:19783:19:15:87:539:97:49:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:4See Prat and Strömberg (2011) for a review. More broadly, our paper relates to empirical studies of the effect of competition
6:230:19909:15:11:72:540:82:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:and ownership structure on product variety in the news media (Berry and Waldfogel 2001; Sweeting 2010; Waldfogel 2011), and
6:231:20032:11:0:71:480:71:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:to studies of the extent to which competition creates an incentive todifferentiate (e.g., Borenstein and Netz 1999).
7:232:20149:0:16:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:observations  per  newspaper.   We supplement  these  two primary  data  sets with information  on costs  and
7:233:20258:16:15:72:540:693:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:revenues of representative newspapers, as well as information from a small number of readership surveys,
7:234:20362:15:32:72:349:678:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:which we use to calibrate some of the parameters of our model.
7:235:20424:32:23:72:316:646:143:Times:143:Times:C:2.2  Cross-section of Daily Newspaper Markets
7:236:20469:23:15:72:540:623:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:Our cross section of newspaper markets is based on the US Newspaper Panel introduced in Gentzkow et
7:237:20568:15:15:72:540:608:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:al.  (2011).  The complete panel is drawn from annual directories of US newspapers from 1869 and from
7:238:20669:15:15:72:540:593:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:every presidential  year  from  1872  to 1924,  inclusive.   Our  main analysis  is based  on  the data for  1924.
7:239:20783:15:16:72:539:578:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:We use other years to define the order of entry, to define a historical measure of newspapers’ affiliations,
7:240:20891:16:15:72:539:562:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:and for supplemental descriptive analysis.  In each year, we extract the name, city, political affiliation, and
7:241:21002:15:15:72:540:547:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:subscription price of every English-language daily newspaper.  We match newspapers across years on the
7:242:21104:15:16:72:540:532:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:basis of their title,  city,  and time of day.   Gentzkow  et al.   (2011) provide details  on data collection  and
7:243:21219:16:15:72:183:516:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:validation of data quality.
7:244:21246:15:15:88:539:501:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:We classify a newspaper’s affiliation as Republican if it ever declares a Republican affiliation and as
7:245:21349:15:16:72:539:486:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:Democratic if it ever declares a Democratic affiliation.5This historical measure differs from contempora-
7:246:21454:16:15:72:539:470:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:neous affiliation mainly because by 1924 many newspapers had switched their affiliation to “Independent.”
7:247:21559:15:15:72:540:455:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:As we discuss further in section 3 below, the evidence suggests that such switches were not associated with
7:248:21666:15:15:72:540:440:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:large changes in content, so that historical affiliations are a better proxy for newspapers’ true political types
7:249:21779:15:16:72:539:425:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:than contemporaneous affiliations.  We exclude from our sample 142 newspapers whose only declared af-
7:250:21880:16:15:72:540:409:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f1:B:filiation is Independent and 36 newspapers that never declare an affiliation of any kind.  In appendix A we
7:251:21987:15:15:72:540:394:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:present results for the subsample of markets that do not contain an Independent newspaper in 1924 and the
7:252:22092:15:16:72:355:379:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:subsample that do not contain an unaffiliated newspaper in 1924.
7:253:22156:16:15:88:539:363:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:We define a newspaper’s year of entry as the year in which itfirst appears in a newspaper directory in our
7:254:22262:15:15:71:539:348:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:panel.  For each market with two or more daily newspapers, we define the order of entry of the newspapers
7:255:22367:15:16:71:305:333:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:based on their years of entry, breaking ties at random.
7:256:22422:16:15:88:540:317:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:We  match  markets  to  Census  place  definitions  in  1990  and  match  each  Census  place  to  the  county
7:257:22532:15:15:71:539:302:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:containing the largest share of the place’s population in 1990.  We use the Census place-county match to
7:258:22636:15:16:71:539:287:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:combine city-level newspaper data with county-level voting data from various sources, as in Gentzkow et
7:259:22739:16:15:71:539:271:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:al.  (2011).  Our main measure of consumer ideology is the average share of the two-party presidential vote
7:260:22846:15:15:71:539:256:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:going to Republicans over the period 1868 to 1928.  We exclude a small number of markets for which we
7:261:22947:15:16:71:539:241:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:cannot identify the presidential vote share. In appendix A we present results excluding markets in the South,
7:262:23056:16:15:71:234:225:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:where the Democrats were dominant.
7:263:23090:15:15:88:539:210:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:We define the universe of potential newspaper markets as the set of all cities with populations between
7:264:23193:15:16:71:539:195:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:3,000 and 100,000 and at least oneweeklynewspaper as of 1924.6The wordpotentialis important, because
7:265:23293:16:15:71:539:179:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:we will estimate a model of newspapers’ entry decisions,  so our sample must include markets that could
7:266:23396:15:15:71:539:164:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:have had a daily newspaper but did not.  We exclude very large and very small cities because we expect
7:267:23498:15:15:71:539:149:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:their economic primitives may be sufficiently different that our model will be a poorfit. (New York City, for
7:268:23607:15:16:71:539:134:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:example, had more than 100 newspapers in 1924, and these papers were far more heterogeneous than those
7:269:23709:16:21:71:539:118:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:in the typical market in our data.) In appendix A we present an analysis of the sensitivity of ourfindings to
7:270:23818:21:14:87:540:97:49:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:5In the handful of cases in which a newspaper declares a Republican affiliation in one year and a Democratic affiliation in
7:271:23941:14:8:71:316:83:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:another, we use the affiliation declared most often by the newspaper.
7:272:24010:8:0:87:532:75:49:g_d0_f1:80:Times:A:6Data on the universe of cities and their populations come from the 1924 N. W. Ayer & Son’sAmerican Newspaper Annual.
8:273:24128:0:16:72:504:709:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:tightening the population bounds for the sample and to excluding markets close to very large cities.
8:274:24228:16:15:88:539:693:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:We will use spatial correlation in newspapers’ affiliations to identify the distribution  of unobservable
8:275:24333:15:15:72:540:678:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:market-level heterogeneity in ideology.  Executing this strategy requires identifying geographically proxi-
8:276:24440:15:16:72:540:663:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:mate markets that are likely to have similar unobservable consumer characteristics. We construct such pairs
8:277:24547:16:15:72:540:647:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:as follows.  We identify all pairs of markets in which both markets are located in the same state and are
8:278:24652:15:15:72:540:632:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:between 100 and 400 kilometers  apart.  Among all such pairs,  we identify  the pair with lowest absolute
8:279:24757:15:16:72:540:617:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:difference in log population, breaking ties randomly.  We then remove the matched markets from consider-
8:280:24861:16:15:72:540:601:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:ation andfind the pair with the next lowest population difference.  We repeat this matching process until all
8:281:24970:15:15:72:165:586:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:markets are matched.
8:282:24990:15:16:88:539:571:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:Table 1 presents summary statistics for our cross-section of markets.  Our sample includes 1,910 mar-
8:283:25091:16:15:72:540:555:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:kets, 950 of which have at least one daily newspaper, and 338 of which have more than one daily newspaper.
8:284:25197:15:15:72:539:540:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:Population is highly correlated with the number of newspapers.  In total there are 1,338 newspapers in the
8:285:25303:15:15:72:540:525:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:sample, of which 57 percent are Republican.  Overall, 54 percent of multi-paper markets are ideologically
8:286:25408:15:16:72:540:510:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:diverse in the sense of having at least one Republican and at least one Democratic newspaper. In the average
8:287:25516:16:15:72:540:494:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:market, Republican and Democratic presidential candidates tend to get a similar number of votes, but there
8:288:25622:15:32:72:306:479:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:is substantial cross-market variation in the vote share.

8:290:25710:22:16:72:540:425:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:Our data on circulation by town come from 1924 reports submitted by newspapers to the Audit Bureau of
8:291:25811:16:15:72:540:409:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:Circulations (ABC), an independent organization created to verify circulation claims.  In most cases these
8:292:25917:15:15:72:540:394:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:audits cover a twelve-month period ending in 1924; in some cases the examination period is shorter or ends
8:293:26023:15:16:72:539:379:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:in 1923.  We obtained the reports on microfilm from ABC and converted them to machine-readable  text.
8:294:26124:16:15:72:539:363:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:This is, to our knowledge, thefirst dataset with disaggregated information on circulation for a large number
8:295:26232:15:15:72:285:348:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:of newspapers prior to the late twentieth century.
8:296:26282:15:16:88:539:333:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:From each audit report  we extract  the newspaper’s name,  location,  and circulation  in each town that
8:297:26386:16:15:72:540:317:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:receives “25 or more copies daily through carriers, dealers, agents, and mail.” We compute total circulation
8:298:26494:15:15:72:540:302:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:by town across all editions of the same paper and average circulation by town across all audit reports (if

8:303:26953:16:15:88:539:225:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:We construct  a cross-section  of towns with at least  one matching circulating  newspaper in which no

9:315:28086:15:15:72:540:678:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:ideologically diverse in the sense of having at least one Republican and at least one Democratic newspaper
9:316:28192:15:16:72:540:663:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:available.  Towns have much smaller populations than markets. In appendix A we present results excluding
9:317:28296:16:31:72:280:647:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:the largest and smallest towns from our sample.

9:319:28370:23:15:72:540:593:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:Our circulation data measure total copies circulated but do not tell us anything about patterns of readership
9:320:28479:15:16:72:434:578:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:at the household level. We supplement the data with information from two sources.
9:321:28560:16:15:88:539:562:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:First,  we  use  newly  digitized  aggregate  reports  from  17  newspaper  readership  surveys,  covering  9
9:322:28669:15:15:72:539:547:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:(mostly large) cities over the period 1929-1969.7Survey respondents declared the full set of newspapers
9:323:28772:15:16:72:540:532:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:read by their household. From each report we compute, for each pair of newspapers, the share of subscribers
9:324:28879:16:15:72:540:516:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:to either newspaper who subscribe to both. We use this measure to characterize the extent of multiple read-
9:325:28986:15:15:72:203:501:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:ership in competitive markets.
9:326:29016:15:16:88:539:486:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:Second, we use data from the studyCost of Living in the United States, 1917-1919(ICPSR 8299; see
9:327:29112:16:15:72:539:470:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:also Costa 2001).  This study contains microdata on “number of newspapers purchased by the household”
9:328:29213:15:15:72:540:455:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:for  a  sample  of  “families  of  wage  earners  or  salaried  workers  in  industrial  locales  scattered  throughout
9:329:29332:15:15:72:539:440:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:the United States.”  Though the data are not nationally representative and do not include detail on specific
9:330:29440:15:16:72:540:425:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:newspapers, they provide the earliest microdata we are aware of on the number of newspapers read by US
9:331:29542:16:15:72:540:409:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:families.  We match the geographic codes in the data to those in our cross-section of newspaper markets,
9:332:29646:15:15:72:540:394:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:and we select the subsample of the data consisting of newspaper-reading families that live in a city in our

9:335:29793:23:15:72:540:324:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:To calibrate features of newspaper cost and revenue structure, we obtained income statements for 94 anony-
9:336:29899:15:16:72:540:309:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:mous newspapers in 1927 from the Inland Daily Press Association (Yewdall 1928).  Since the data do not
9:337:30001:16:15:72:540:293:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:identify individual newspapers, we match each record in the US Newspaper Panel to the record in the Inland
9:338:30107:15:15:72:265:278:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:Press data with the closest circulation value.
9:339:30153:15:15:88:538:263:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:We compute the variable cost of each newspaper as the annual per-copy cost of printing and distribution,
9:340:30257:15:16:72:539:248:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:including  paper  and  ink  costs  and  mailing  and  delivery  costs.   We  computefixed  costs  per  copy  as  the
9:341:30373:16:15:72:540:232:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:difference between annual total costs per copy and annual variable costs per copy.  We also compute the
9:342:30476:15:15:72:540:217:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:annual per-copy advertising revenue of each newspaper. Finally, we compute the annual per-copy circulation
9:343:30582:15:38:72:416:202:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:revenue of each newspaper (revenue from subscriptions and single-copy sales).

9:345:30709:26:16:72:540:138:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:The median newspaper in our 1924 cross-section entered its market prior to 1896. During the 1890s, news-
9:346:30813:16:15:72:540:122:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:papers devoted 20−40 percent of their coverage to politics (Baldasty 1992). It was common for newspapers
9:347:30917:15:32:72:539:107:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:to choose an explicit affiliation with either the Democratic or the Republican party. The practice faded over
9:348:31026:32:0:87:365:75:49:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:A:7We provide publication details for each report in the supplemental appendix.
10:349:31104:0:16:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:time: by the mid-twentieth century it was rare for newly-formed newspapers to declare an explicit affiliation
10:350:31213:16:15:72:247:693:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:(Gentzkow et al. 2006; Hamilton 2006).
10:351:31251:15:15:88:540:678:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:We use political affiliation as a proxy for the political orientation of a newspaper’s content and hence
10:352:31355:15:16:72:540:663:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:for its likely appeal to readers of different political stripes. A connection among newspaper affiliation, con-
10:353:31466:16:15:72:540:647:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:tent, and audience was explicit in newspapers’ own pronouncements. For example, in 1868, the Democratic
10:354:31569:15:15:72:540:632:119:Times:119:g_d0_f1:B:Detroit Free Pressannounced, “TheFree Pressalone in this State is able to combine a Democratic point of
10:355:31672:15:16:72:540:617:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:view of our state politics and local issues with those of national importance” (Kaplan 2002, 23).  Similarly,
10:356:31781:16:15:72:540:601:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:in 1872, the RepublicanDetroit Postdeclared as its mission “To meet the demands of the Republicans of
10:357:31882:15:15:72:540:586:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:Michigan and to advance their cause” (Kaplan 2002, 22).  In Gentzkow et al.  (2011) we report quantitative
10:358:31988:15:16:72:540:571:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:evidence for our newspaper panel showing that newspapers devoted more attention to the presidential can-
10:359:32092:16:15:72:540:555:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:didates of their own party than those of the opposing party.  Many other quantitative and qualitative studies
10:360:32201:15:15:72:540:540:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:support a strong connection between affiliation and content (Hamilton 2006; Gentzkow et al. 2006; Kaplan
10:361:32305:15:15:72:171:525:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:2002; Summers 1994).
10:362:32325:15:16:88:540:510:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:We will treat political affiliation as a way for a newspaper to differentiate commercially from its com-
10:363:32429:16:15:72:539:494:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:petitors.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that newspaper owners thought of political affiliation in those terms.
10:364:32538:15:15:72:539:479:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:James E. Scripps declared in 1879 that “As a rule, there is never afield for a second paper of precisely the
10:365:32646:15:16:72:540:464:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:same characteristics  as one already in existence.  A Democratic paper may be established  where there is
10:366:32751:16:15:72:540:448:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:already a Republican; or vice versa; an afternoon paper where there is only a morning; a cheap paper where
10:367:32857:15:15:72:539:433:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:there is only a high-priced one; but I think I can safely affirm that an attempt to supplant an existing newspa-
10:368:32969:15:16:72:540:418:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:per...of exactly the same character has never succeeded” (quoted in Hamilton 2006, 47).  Through the early
10:369:33075:16:15:72:540:402:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:twentieth century, James’ brother, E.W. Scripps, exploited the nominal independence of his newspaper chain
10:370:33181:15:15:72:540:387:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:to adapt editorial content to market conditions, emphasizing Republican ideas in markets with established
10:371:33286:15:16:72:531:372:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:Democratic newspapers, and Democratic ideas when Republicans were entrenched (Baldasty 1999, 139).
10:372:33384:16:15:88:539:356:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:Political affiliations may also have served political aims, but at the time of our study commercial con-
10:373:33488:15:15:72:539:341:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:siderations were likely dominant (Baldasty 1992).  In related work, we show that newspapers’ affiliations
10:374:33593:15:16:72:540:326:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:exerted, on average, at most a small effect on electoral outcomes (Gentzkow et al.  2011), and that in most
10:375:33700:16:15:72:539:310:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:times and places incumbent parties exerted at most a limited influence on newspapers’ political affiliations
10:376:33808:15:15:72:540:295:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:(Gentzkow et al.  2012).  We note, however, that Petrova (2011) provides evidence that political patronage
10:377:33914:15:15:72:292:280:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:influenced newspaper affiliations in the late 1800s.
10:378:33966:15:16:88:540:265:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:We exclude unaffiliated newspapers from our analysis. We do this primarily because the group of news-
10:379:34067:16:15:72:539:249:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:papers  that  never  declare  a  Republican  or  Democratic  affiliation  includes  many  specialized  commercial
10:380:34180:15:15:72:540:234:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:papers (e.g., mining industry trade journals) that can plausibly be treated as separable in demand from af-
10:381:34287:15:16:72:540:219:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f1:B:filiated newspapers.  This decision also has the effect of excluding newspapers that always declared their
10:382:34393:16:15:72:540:203:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:affiliation as Independent,  some of which may well have competed economically with the newspapers in
10:383:34494:15:15:72:540:188:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:our sample.  In appendix A we show that our results are robust to excluding from our sample markets in
10:384:34596:15:16:72:437:173:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:which affiliated papers may have competed with Independent or unaffiliated papers.
10:385:34678:16:15:88:540:157:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:We model a newspaper’s political affiliation as a binary characteristic.  This decision is motivated by
10:386:34781:15:15:72:539:142:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:qualitative and quantitative evidence suggesting that papers of the same affiliation were relatively homoge-
10:387:34889:15:16:72:540:127:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:neous in their content, hewing closely to the party line. Newspaper proprietor Horace Greeley writes in his
10:388:34996:16:15:72:540:111:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:autobiography: “A Democratic, Whig, or Republican journal is generally expected to praise or blame, like or
10:389:35103:15:15:72:540:96:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:dislike, eulogize or condemn, in precise accordance with the views and interest of its party” (Greeley 1872,
10:390:35211:15:0:72:539:81:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:137).  According to Kaplan (2002), “In professing allegiance to a party, the Detroit press assumed specific
11:391:35319:0:16:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:obligations.  The individual journal was the organ of the political community, and commissioned with the
11:392:35423:16:15:72:540:693:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:task of expressing the group’s ideas and its interests” (23). In the rare event that a newspaper deviated from
11:393:35533:15:15:72:540:678:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:the party line, they could be severely punished.8Consistent with this narrative evidence, Gentzkow et al.
11:394:35638:15:16:72:539:663:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:(2011) show that the political orientation of voters strongly predicts the affiliations of local papers, but is
11:395:35749:16:15:72:364:647:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:only weakly correlated with their content conditional on affiliation.
11:396:35818:15:15:88:539:632:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:We  model  affiliation  as  static  even  though  newspapers  often  switched  from  declaring  a  Republican
11:397:35927:15:16:72:540:617:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:or  Democratic  affiliation  to  declaring  an  Independent  affiliation.   We  do  this  because  Gentzkow  et  al.
11:398:36043:16:15:72:540:601:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:(2011) show that differences in Republican candidate mentions between originally Republican and origi-
11:399:36145:15:15:72:539:586:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:nally Democratic papers is similar whether or not their current affiliation is Independent.  That is, formerly
11:400:36255:15:16:72:540:571:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:affiliated newspapers do not become noticeably less partisan after dropping their explicit declaration of party
11:401:36366:16:15:72:118:555:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:allegiance.
11:402:36377:15:15:88:539:540:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:Although the assumption offixed, binary affiliations is reasonable in light of the evidence, it is never-
11:403:36482:15:15:71:539:525:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:theless an approximation.  The historical record provides examples of content differences among papers of
11:404:36587:15:16:71:539:510:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:thesameaffiliation, particularly on issues where disagreements between factions within the party were sig-
11:405:36693:16:15:71:539:494:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:nificant (Summers 1994, 43-58). In the supplemental appendix, we present evidence on the extent to which
11:406:36797:15:15:71:539:479:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:newspapers of a given affiliation adjust their content in response to changes in consumer preferences or the
11:407:36905:15:16:71:539:464:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:competitive landscape.  There is qualitative evidence consistent with such adjustment, but the precision of
11:408:37012:16:15:71:539:448:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:the exercise is limited so we cannot  say confidently  that such adjustment  took place.   To the extent  that
11:409:37122:15:15:71:540:433:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:binary affiliations are a coarse summary of a more continuous space of political content, caution is needed
11:410:37229:15:16:71:539:418:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:in linking our results to effects on underlying  content.  Our results capture diversity at the level of party
11:411:37339:16:37:71:279:402:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:affiliations, not intra-party factions or shadings.

11:417:37687:15:15:88:540:269:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:Table 3 shows that both factors play a significant role in driving observed demand.  The table presents

11:421:38106:15:15:72:540:208:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:ideology, specification (2) includes only counts of substitute newspapers, and specification (3) includes both.
11:422:38217:15:16:72:540:193:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:Given the construction of the dependent measure, coefficients can be interpreted as the marginal effect of a
11:423:38325:16:15:72:441:177:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:given variable on the circulation of Republican papers relative to Democratic papers.
11:424:38410:15:15:88:539:162:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:The greater is the Republican share of households in a town, the greater will be the relative circulation
11:425:38515:15:16:71:539:147:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:of Republican newspapers. However, having more Republican newspapers available will tend to depress the
11:426:38618:16:23:71:539:131:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:circulation of the average Republican paper due to substitution effects. Because Republican newspapers are
11:427:38724:23:15:87:540:108:49:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:8Kaplan (2002,  58-61)  discusses  the case of the DemocraticDetroit Free Press,  which in 1872 refused to endorse  Horace
11:428:38846:15:11:71:539:93:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:Greeley, the Democratic nominee for the presidency.  The paper was widely criticized by party leaders, loyal partisan readers, and
11:429:38976:11:11:71:539:82:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:competitors.   “Influential Democrats” threatened to start a competing Democratic paper in response.   Ultimately,  the rebellious
11:430:39106:11:0:71:452:71:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:owners of theFree Presswere bought out by loyal interests, and the paper switched to supporting Greeley.
12:431:39212:0:16:72:540:709:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:more likely to be available in towns with more Republican households,  these two effects tend to work in
12:432:39316:16:15:72:539:693:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:opposite directions. Therefore, we expect that specification (1) understates the effect of household ideology
12:433:39425:15:15:72:540:678:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:and specification (2) understates the importance of substitutes.  Specification (3) shows that, as expected,
12:434:39533:15:16:72:540:663:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:both effects are estimated to be larger when the regression includes measures of both household ideology
12:435:39637:16:15:72:208:647:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:and the presence of substitutes.
12:436:39669:15:15:88:540:632:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:In the supplemental appendix, we show that the two effects illustrated by specification (3) are robust to
12:437:39774:15:16:72:540:617:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:a number of alternative specifications. We show that both the effect of household ideology and the effect of
12:438:39882:16:15:72:539:601:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:substitutes are robust to a specification with both newspaper and townfixed effects, and to controlling for
12:439:39989:15:15:72:540:586:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:non-political attributes of both newspapers and towns. We also show that the key qualitative patterns in the
12:440:40097:15:16:72:540:571:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:data are present in both large and small towns, and that qualitatively similar patterns emerge when we study
12:441:40205:16:15:72:350:555:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:changes in circulation over time rather than in the cross-section.
12:442:40271:15:15:88:539:540:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:The estimated  relationships  in specification  (3)  are economically  significant.   Increasing  the fraction
12:443:40381:15:15:72:540:525:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:Republican among voters by 10 percentage points increases the relative circulation of Republican papers
12:444:40484:15:16:72:540:510:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:by 10 percent.  Adding a second Republican paper to a market with one Republican and one Democratic
12:445:40583:16:15:72:458:494:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:newspaper reduces the relative circulation of the existing Republican paper by 4 percent.

12:447:40779:15:16:72:540:464:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:readership of Republican papers is increasing in the Republican vote share.  In addition, for any vote share,
12:448:40888:16:32:72:540:448:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:the average Republican paper garners more readership when the majority of its competitors are Democratic.

12:450:41045:22:15:72:540:394:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:Given that households demand own-type newspapers and that same-type papers are more substitutable, we
12:451:41146:15:16:72:538:379:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:would expect that newspaper affiliation would respond both to household ideology and to market structure.
12:452:41251:16:15:88:539:363:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:Table 4 shows that these expectations are borne out in our data.  The table presents OLS regressions of
12:453:41354:15:15:71:539:348:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:a dummy for whether a newspaper chooses a Republican affiliation on measures of household ideology and
12:454:41456:15:16:71:539:333:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:incumbent affiliations.  Specification (1) includes only household ideology, specification (2) includes only
12:455:41564:16:15:71:325:317:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:incumbent affiliations, and specification (3) includes both.
12:456:41624:15:15:88:539:302:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:The more Republican are the households  in a market,  the more likely is an entering paper to choose
12:457:41724:15:16:71:539:287:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:a Republican affiliation.  However, facing a Republican incumbent reduces the likelihood that an entering
12:458:41829:16:15:71:540:271:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:paper affiliates with the Republican party. Because Republican incumbents are more likely in markets with
12:459:41934:15:15:71:539:256:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:more Republican households, these two effects tend to work in opposite directions.  Therefore, we expect
12:460:42038:15:16:71:539:241:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:that specification (1) understates the effect of household ideology, and specification (2) understates the effect
12:461:42151:16:15:71:539:225:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:of incumbent affiliation.  Specification (3) shows that, as expected, both effects are estimated to be larger
12:462:42260:15:15:71:482:210:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:when the regression includes measures of both household ideology and incumbent affiliations.
12:463:42352:15:15:88:539:195:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:In the supplemental appendix we exploit panel structure to show that the correlation between household
12:464:42454:15:16:71:539:180:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:ideology and newspaper affiliation decisions is not driven by reverse causality from newspaper content to
12:465:42559:16:15:71:136:164:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:voter behavior.
12:466:42574:15:15:88:539:149:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:The effects we estimate in specification (3) are economically significant. A 10 percentage point increase
12:467:42679:15:16:71:539:134:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:in the fraction Republican among households increases the likelihood of a Republican affiliation by 23 per-
12:468:42786:16:15:71:539:118:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:centage points.  Having a Republican incumbent instead of a Democratic incumbent reduces the likelihood
12:469:42889:15:15:71:295:103:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:of a Republican affiliation by 28 percentage points.
12:470:42941:15:16:88:540:88:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:Figure 1 illustrates the key patterns in specification (3) of table 4 graphically.  Panel A shows that the
12:471:43047:16:0:71:539:72:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:probability of thefirst entrant choosing a Republican affiliation is increasing in the Republican vote share
13:472:43157:0:16:72:539:709:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:in the market.  Panel B shows that the probability of the second entrant choosing a Republican affiliation is
13:473:43266:16:31:72:511:693:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:increasing in the Republican vote share and is lower when thefirst entrant’s affiliation is Republican.

13:475:43409:23:16:72:539:639:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:Controlling for the Republican vote share greatly affects the strength of the substitution and differentiation
13:476:43519:16:15:72:540:623:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:effects we estimate in tables 3 and 4.  It remains possible that variation in consumer ideology not captured
13:477:43627:15:15:72:539:608:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:by our observable proxy is a source of bias. In this section, we outline an identification strategy that exploits
13:478:43740:15:15:72:540:593:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:spatial correlation in consumer ideology to identify the role of unobserved heterogeneity across towns and
13:479:43846:15:16:72:539:578:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:markets, much in the way that correlation over time facilitates identification in panel settings (e.g., Collard-
13:480:43958:16:15:72:134:562:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:Wexler 2013).
13:481:43971:15:15:88:540:547:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:To illustrate the logic of our strategy, consider newspapers’ affiliation choices.  In markets whosefirst
13:482:44076:15:16:72:540:532:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:entrant  is  Democratic,  the  second  entrant  is  Republican  48  percent  of  the  time.   In  markets  whosefirst
13:483:44193:16:15:72:540:516:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:entrant  is Republican,  the  second  entrant  is Republican  51  percent  of  the  time.   We interpret  this  slight
13:484:44311:15:15:72:540:501:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:positive correlation as the net effect of negative correlation due to differentiation  and positive correlation
13:485:44422:15:16:72:239:486:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:due to variation in consumer ideology.
13:486:44460:16:15:88:539:470:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:Now consider the affiliation choices of the second entrant in a neighboring market—defined in section
13:487:44561:15:15:72:539:455:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:2.2 as a similar-size market between 100 and 400 kilometers away. In markets whosefirst entrant is Demo-
13:488:44665:15:15:72:540:440:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:cratic, the second entrant in the neighboring market is Republican 31 percent of the time. In markets whose
13:489:44772:15:16:72:540:425:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f1:B:first entrant is Republican,  the second entrant in the neighboring  market is Republican 64 percent  of the
13:490:44880:16:15:72:540:409:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:time.  As newspapers at this distance did not compete directly, we interpret this strong positive correlation
13:491:44989:15:15:72:410:394:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:as evidence of underlying spatially correlated variation in consumer ideology.
13:492:45067:15:16:88:539:379:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:We show in the supplemental appendix that a similar pattern is present in the circulation data.  A town
13:493:45170:16:15:72:540:363:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:whose available newspapers are majority Republican exhibits slightly lower relative demand for Republican
13:494:45275:15:15:72:539:348:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:newspapers. A town whoseneighborhas primarily Republican newspapers exhibits greater relative demand
13:495:45375:15:16:71:192:333:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:for Republican newspapers.
13:496:45401:16:15:88:539:317:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:In both cases, comparing the correlation within a location with the correlation across neighboring lo-
13:497:45503:15:15:71:539:302:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:cations reveals information about the importance of unobservable variation in consumer ideology.  We will
13:498:45608:15:16:71:453:287:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:exploit this information to identify our formal model, relying on three key assumptions.
13:499:45696:16:15:88:539:271:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:First, we assume that our pairs of markets and towns are close enough to share similar ideology but far
13:500:45799:15:15:71:539:256:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:enough apart that their newspapers do not interact directly.  Appendixfigure 2 shows direct support for this
13:501:45907:15:16:71:540:241:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:assumption. Two counties located 100−400 kilometers apart have a highly correlated Republican vote share
13:502:46011:16:15:71:539:225:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:and fraction white.  However, newspapers headquartered in thefirst county rarely circulate in the second at
13:503:46118:15:15:71:539:210:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:such distances. Second, we assume that there are no spatially-correlated supply-side variables that affect the
13:504:46228:15:16:71:540:195:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:relative profitability of different affiliations.9Third, we assume that the correlation of the unobservables is
13:505:46339:16:15:72:540:179:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:the same as the correlation of the observables.  In appendix A we present evidence on the sensitivity of our
13:506:46447:15:34:72:311:164:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f1:B:findings to variation in the assumed spatial correlation.
13:507:46504:34:15:87:539:130:49:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:9Variable costs such as paper and ink were not affiliation-specific, and in any case these commodities were traded nationally.
13:508:46630:15:11:71:539:115:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:The cost of hiring editors or reporters could be affiliation-specific, but the market for such talent was geographically broad.  For
13:509:46762:11:11:71:539:104:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:example, in 1920, 49 percent of prime-age (25-55) white male journalists lived in a state other than their state of birth, as against
13:510:46895:11:11:71:540:93:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:33 percent for all prime-age white males (Ruggles et al.  2010).  Common ownership of newspapers in different markets is afinal
13:511:47022:11:11:72:540:82:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:possible source of correlation.  In appendix A we show that removing the small number of market pairs with common ownership
13:512:47145:11:0:72:203:71:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:makes little difference to our results.

14:514:47244:23:15:72:539:686:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:In our model, market performance (the efficiency of entry and pricing decisions) depends on the extent of
14:515:47349:15:16:72:540:671:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:differentiation among newspapers.  The model estimates reported below imply that this differentiation was
14:516:47454:16:15:72:540:655:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:substantial. Several pieces of evidence are consistent with this conclusion, some of which we incorporate in
14:517:47562:15:15:72:352:640:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:estimation, and some of which provide independent verification.
14:518:47625:15:16:88:539:625:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:First, newspaper markups were large even in competitive markets. The average newspaper in our sample

14:521:47940:15:16:72:405:579:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:newspapers in more competitive markets charged, if anything, higher prices.
14:522:48015:16:15:88:539:563:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:Second, circulation changes around newspaper entry suggest limited substitutability. In the supplemental
14:523:48119:15:15:72:540:548:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:appendix, we show that the entry of an average newspaper increases total market circulation by 24 percent. If
14:524:48228:15:16:72:539:533:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:there werenosubstitution with existing newspapers, we estimate that this number would be only moderately
14:525:48332:16:15:72:540:517:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:higher, at 28 percent. Put differently, only about 14 percent of the circulation of an entering newspaper comes
14:526:48443:15:15:72:540:502:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:at the expense of existing newspapers’ circulation.  The rest comes either from households who previously
14:527:48548:15:16:72:379:487:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:did not read a newspaper, or from households reading multiple papers.
14:528:48617:16:15:88:539:471:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:Third,  multiple  readership  was  quantitatively  important  at  the  time  of  our  study.   In  our  1917-1919
14:529:48730:15:15:72:540:456:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:survey data,  15 percent  of households  that  report  reading  a daily newspaper  report  reading  two or more
14:530:48841:15:15:72:540:441:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:newspapers.  In our readership survey data, for the average pair of newspapers, 16 percent of households
14:531:48945:15:16:72:540:426:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:who read either paper read both. And as we document in the supplemental appendix, overlap was if anything
14:532:49050:16:15:72:539:410:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:larger for newspapers with the same political affiliation, suggesting a high degree of differentiation along
14:533:49158:15:38:72:182:395:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:non-political dimensions.

14:536:49201:22:15:72:540:308:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:The goal of our model is to parsimoniously capture the effect of consumer preferences, price competition,
14:537:49306:15:16:72:540:293:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:and advertising competition on equilibrium product diversity. Computational and data limitations mean the
14:538:49411:16:15:72:540:277:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:model is necessarily  stylized.  We approximate a set of economic forces we judge to be most important,
14:539:49514:15:15:72:229:262:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:while abstracting from many others.
14:540:49549:15:16:88:539:247:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:In the  next  two subsections,  we define  the model  and  characterize  its  equilibrium.   In the  following
14:541:49659:16:15:72:540:231:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:subsection, we return to the main assumptions, discussing their limitations, their importance for our main

15:556:50835:16:15:71:539:601:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:process that determines which newspapers are available in which towns, but we allow in estimation for the
15:557:50940:15:15:71:445:586:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:possibility that the choice set may be correlated with unobserved town characteristics.
15:558:51027:15:16:88:539:571:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:The game proceeds infive stages.   First,  the potential  entrants choose sequentially  whether or not to
15:559:51132:16:15:71:539:555:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:enter. Second, the newspapers that have entered sequentially choose their affiliations in order of their indices
15:560:51244:15:15:73:539:540:119:Times:119:g_d0_f1:B:j.  The assignment of these indices is random and not learned until the second stage.  Third, newspapers
15:561:51348:15:15:71:539:525:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:simultaneously choose their circulation prices. Fourth, newspapers simultaneously choose their advertising
15:562:51454:15:16:71:539:510:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:prices, after which each advertiser simultaneously decides whether or not to advertise in each newspaper.
15:563:51559:16:15:71:539:494:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:Finally, households choose to consume any bundle of the available newspapers, or no newspaper at all.  At

15:575:52597:15:16:72:539:286:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:appendix that the affiliations of co-owned newspapers are correlated, suggesting that these residuals may be
15:576:52705:16:15:72:540:270:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:thought of as partly capturing the personal political preferences of owners.  We model these cost shocks as
15:577:52812:15:15:72:539:255:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:proportional to the number of households.  Structurally, this reflects the idea that owners may value greater
15:578:52921:15:16:72:540:240:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:reach for their preferred ideologies. Practically, this assumption makes the affiliation choice game neutral to

16:638:56518:11:11:72:540:82:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:follows.  First, observe that in any equilibrium all advertisers must advertise in all newspapers, since if a newspaper receives no
16:639:56649:11:0:72:539:71:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:advertising, there is always some positive advertising price belowalthat the newspaper would like to charge and that would attract

17:700:59627:11:11:72:539:82:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:price and increase its profits.  With all advertisers advertising in all newspapers, it is straightforward to show that this maximum
17:701:59759:11:0:71:313:71:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:price is given by (6) for all newspapers, implying the desired result.

18:705:60055:23:23:72:155:639:119:Times:119:Times:C:Market Definition
18:706:60072:23:15:72:539:616:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:We make  two important  simplifying  assumptions  in defining  newspaper  markets.   First,  we assume  that
18:707:60180:15:15:72:540:601:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:newspapers only compete with other newspapers headquartered in the same market, and we ignore circula-
18:708:60282:15:16:72:540:586:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:tion in hinterland towns in modeling newspapers’ affiliation, pricing and entry choices.  In reality, the 1924
18:709:60392:16:15:72:540:570:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:ABC data shows that  home-market  papers  constitute  90 percent  of circulation  in news markets,  and the
18:710:60499:15:15:72:539:555:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:average newspaper sold 65 percent of copies in its home market.12Our definition is thus an approximation
18:711:60603:15:16:72:540:540:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:to a reality in which consumers exhibit strong but not exclusive preferences for local papers.  To assess ro-
18:712:60712:16:15:72:540:524:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:bustness to this assumption, we show results in appendix A from a subsample that excludes markets close to
18:713:60818:15:15:72:539:509:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:large cities, and from a specification in which we incorporate hinterland towns into our measure of market
18:714:60924:15:16:72:112:494:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:ideology.
18:715:60933:16:15:88:539:478:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:Second, we aggregate all substitutes for daily newspapers into an outside option whose prices and char-
18:716:61036:15:15:72:540:463:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:acteristics we do not model explicitly.  We deliberately choose a period of study in which there were few
18:717:61141:15:16:72:540:448:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:such substitutes that were also significant source of political information.  In 1924, television did not exist
18:718:61252:16:15:72:540:432:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:and radio was in its infancy as a news source (Sterling and Kittross 2001). Although weekly newspapers and
18:719:61358:15:15:72:540:417:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:magazines existed and played an important role in the media market, neither conveyed the news on a daily
18:720:61462:15:15:72:540:402:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:basis, and neither weekly newspapers nor weekly magazines achieved total weekly circulation in excess of
18:721:61566:15:32:72:330:387:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:the totaldailycirculation of daily newspapers (Field 2006).

18:723:61648:22:16:72:540:333:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:Our  model  endogenizes  political  affiliation  but  not  other  forms  of differentiation.   This  is clearly  a dra-
18:724:61767:16:15:72:539:317:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:matic simplification, as variation in both quality and non-political horizontal dimensions (such as time of
18:725:61874:15:15:72:540:302:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:publication)  was clearly important.  Estimating consumer preferences  for other dimensions is straightfor-

18:731:62434:15:15:72:540:210:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:several  additional  sensitivity  analyses.   In  appendix  A  we show  results  from  a  model  that  allows  utility
18:732:62552:15:16:72:540:195:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:to depend on distance to a newspaper’s headquarters, an important shifter of quality.  We also experiment
18:733:62657:16:15:72:539:179:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:with  specifications  that  use  a newspaper’s  price  and  home  market  circulation  as quality  proxies.   In  the
18:734:62774:15:15:72:540:164:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:supplemental appendix, we show explicitly that the crucial cross-sectional patterns that identify our demand
18:735:62882:15:41:72:438:149:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:system are robust to allowingflexibly for variation in quality at the newspaper level.
18:736:62968:41:15:84:540:108:49:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:12Fan (2013) uses a wider market definition that encapsulates 85 percent of a newspaper’s circulation and includes circulation
18:737:63094:15:11:71:539:93:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:outside a newspaper’s home market. Allowing for this additional realism would be difficult in our model as we estimate newspapers’
18:738:63224:11:11:71:539:82:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:incentive  to  enter  the  market.   Doing  so  in  a  model  with  overlapping  markets  would  mean  computing  post-entry  equilibrium
18:739:63361:11:0:71:506:71:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:configurations taking account of strategic linkages of distant newspapers through chains of partially overlapping markets.
19:740:63485:0:16:88:539:709:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:Ignoring  non-political  horizontal  differentiation  is also an important  simplification.   The more news-
19:741:63593:16:15:72:540:693:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:papers can differentiate on non-political dimensions, the weaker will be their incentive to differentiate on
19:742:63701:15:15:72:540:678:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:politics  (Irmen and Thisse 1998;  Liu and Shuai 2013).   We expect  our  empirical  estimates  to reflect the
19:743:63811:15:16:72:540:663:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:incentive  to differentiate  on political  dimensionsgiventhe extent  of differentiation  on other dimensions.
19:744:63921:16:15:72:540:647:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:As we do not treat differentiation  on other dimensions as endogenous,  we cannot allow it to vary in our
19:745:64026:15:15:72:540:632:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:counterfactuals,  which could impact our conclusions.   For example,  we could overstate or understate  the
19:746:64133:15:16:72:540:617:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:welfare effects of collusion, because collusion can both encourage and discourage non-political differentia-
19:747:64241:16:15:72:539:601:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:tion (Sweeting 2010). In addition, we could overstate the value of variety, because we capture non-political
19:748:64349:15:15:72:413:586:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:differentiation through a symmetric logit error (Ackerberg and Rysman 2005).
19:749:64425:15:16:88:539:571:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:In the supplemental appendix we present sensitivity analyses related to these concerns. We show that our
19:750:64529:16:15:72:539:555:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f1:B:finding that variety is undersupplied survives even if we exogenously cap the number of entering newspapers.
19:751:64637:15:15:72:540:540:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:We also  present  results  from  an experiment  in which we simulate  data  from  a model  with two types  of

19:757:65093:23:15:72:539:425:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:Our demand specification is designed to capture two key elements: consumers’ preferences for like-minded
19:758:65197:15:16:72:540:410:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:political news, and the possibility of a given household reading multiple papers.  The former is obviously
19:759:65303:16:15:72:540:394:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:important given our focus on political differentiation. The latter is equally crucial, because audience duplica-
19:760:65415:15:15:72:540:379:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:tion across papers will be the key driver of advertising competition. It is also consistent with our readership
19:761:65526:15:16:72:355:364:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:surveys, which show a significant amount of multiple readership.
19:762:65590:16:15:88:540:348:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:Our demand model nests several cases of interest.  Whenβ=βandΓd=Γs=0, it is equivalent to a
19:763:65681:15:15:72:543:333:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:model in which each newspaper is a monopolist facing logit demand.  Whenβ=βandΓd,Γs→∞,itisa
19:764:65772:15:16:72:539:318:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:standard logit model in which each household reads at most one newspaper. Whenβ→−∞, it is equivalent
19:765:65872:16:15:72:508:302:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:to a model in which there are two distinct markets, one forRnewspapers and one forDnewspapers.
19:766:65966:15:15:88:539:287:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:An important simplifying assumption is that we allow only two types of consumers:  Republican and
19:767:66063:15:15:72:539:272:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:Democratic.  In reality, of course, some consumers in the period we study did not have a definite partisan
19:768:66169:15:16:72:539:257:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:affiliation, although this group was likely in a minority.13In the presence of unmodeled nonpartisan con-
19:769:66274:16:15:72:540:241:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:sumers, we expect that the gapβ−βthat we estimate will measure the “average” level of partisanship in
19:770:66375:15:15:71:539:226:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:news preferences, i.e. a value between the preferences of partisans and nonpartisans.  The supplemental ap-

19:772:66589:16:76:71:427:195:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:and shows how our counterfactual estimates change with the fraction unaffiliated.
19:773:66670:76:15:84:540:119:49:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:13Using Burnham’s (1965) index based on aggregate election returns, Rusk (1970) estimates that split-ticket voting in the US
19:774:66794:15:11:71:539:104:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:was not more than seven percent during the period 1876-1908.  Millspaugh (1918) reports based on actual ballot records that 21.7
19:775:66922:11:11:71:539:93:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:percent of votes in Rhode Island in 1906 were split-ticket.  Erikson and Tedin (1981) report that 26 percent of voters switched
19:776:67049:11:11:71:539:82:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:parties between the 1924 and 1928 elections and that thisfigure fell to 11 percent by 1944.  (The 1924-28 period coincides with a
19:777:67178:11:0:71:188:71:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:major shift in US party politics.)

20:779:67230:23:15:72:540:686:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:Our model of advertising competition draws heavily on the theoretical literature on competition in two-sided
20:780:67338:15:16:72:540:671:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:markets with multi-homing (Armstrong 2002; Ambrus and Reisinger 2006; Anderson et al.  2011).  Allow-
20:781:67439:16:15:72:540:655:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:ing for advertising competition is important because advertising accounted for the majority of newspaper
20:782:67543:15:15:72:227:640:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:revenue during the period we study.
20:783:67578:15:16:88:540:625:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:The  prediction  of  diminishing  returns  to  duplicate  impressionsfits  with  narrative  evidence  from  the
20:784:67689:16:15:72:540:609:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:period we study.  It was common for advertisers to assess the duplication in readership across publications
20:785:67796:15:15:72:540:594:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:when considering where to place ads, and to consider duplicate impressions to the same household to be less
20:786:67903:15:16:72:540:579:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:valuable than unique impressions.14Indeed, these practices explain the existence of the readership surveys
20:787:68009:16:15:72:538:563:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:that we use for a portion of our analysis, which were typically sponsored by one or more local newspapers.
20:788:68115:15:15:88:539:548:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:Our advertising  model  makes several  important  simplifying  assumptions.   First,  we do not allow the
20:789:68220:15:16:72:540:533:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:quantity of ads to affect the utility of a newspaper to consumers.  In contrast to the literature on broadcast
20:790:68330:16:15:72:540:517:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:media, for print media the evidence is mixed on consumers’ valuations of advertising, with good empirical
20:791:68435:15:15:72:540:502:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:support for a positive value to readers in some settings (Bogart 1981; Kaiser and Wright 2006; Sonnac 2000;
20:792:68542:15:16:72:540:487:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:Kaiser and Song 2009).  Implicitly, our approach follows Dertouzos and Trautman (1990) in assuming the
20:793:68644:16:15:72:540:471:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:consumer treats advertising and news content symmetrically. Second, we assume that advertisers’ valuations
20:794:68750:15:15:72:509:456:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:are homogeneous and do not depend on consumer types (as they do, for example, in Chandra 2009).
20:795:68845:15:15:88:539:441:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:We impose these restrictions because we do not have reliable cross-sectional data on advertising quan-
20:796:68947:15:16:71:539:426:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:tities and rates.  The most important consequence of these assumptions is that all advertisers are served in
20:797:69055:16:15:71:539:410:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:equilibrium in the model, which means that the advertising side of the market is allocatively efficient even
20:798:69163:15:15:71:539:395:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:under imperfect competition.  This is a strong assumption.  However, we note that because display adver-
20:799:69267:15:16:71:539:380:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:tising rates are often negotiated individually, newspapers have substantial scope for price discrimination in
20:800:69376:16:15:71:538:364:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:rates, which means that imperfect competition may not lead to quantity restrictions relative to thefirst-best.
20:801:69486:15:15:88:539:349:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:We also assume that newspaper costs are independent of the number of ads printed. This is primarily for
20:802:69589:15:16:71:539:334:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:simplicity. Equilibrium advertising prices and quantities would be unchanged if we allowed for a per-reader
20:803:69696:16:15:71:456:318:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:cost of printing each advertiser’s ad, provided the printing cost per reader is less thanal.
20:804:69788:15:15:88:540:303:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:For ease of exposition, we assume that circulation prices arefixed at the timefirms set advertising rates.
20:805:69894:15:16:71:539:288:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:This is consistent with the fact that subscription prices are typically posted (and so adjust relatively infre-
20:806:70005:16:15:71:539:272:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:quently), whereas advertising rates are often negotiated.  However, because advertising prices do not affect
20:807:70113:15:15:71:539:257:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:consumer demand, the equilibria of the game we study are equivalent to those of a game with simultaneous
20:808:70217:15:31:71:284:242:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:choice of both circulation and advertising prices.

20:810:70294:23:15:71:539:188:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:Our model of entry and affiliation choice is shaped by three main considerations.  First, to credibly identify
20:811:70404:15:16:71:539:173:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:the strategic interactions offirms that share a market environment, it is important to allow for unobservable
20:812:70513:16:15:71:539:157:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:shocks  at  both  the  market  and  individualfirm level  (Brock  and  Durlauf  2007;  Aguirregabiria  and  Nevo
20:813:70625:15:15:71:539:142:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:2013).  Second, to take advantage of our data, we want the model to reflect the reality that entry in these
20:814:70732:15:30:71:539:127:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:markets happened sequentially, and that we know the order in which it occurred. Third, as a practical matter,
20:815:70841:30:15:84:539:97:49:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:14In his text on advertising campaigns, Martin (1921) writes that “The same advertisement seen in two or three newspapers is
20:816:70965:15:11:71:540:82:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:certainly more effective than if seen in one, but some advertisers are convinced that it is not worth three times as much to have an
20:817:71097:11:0:71:414:71:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:advertisement seen in three papers, reaching largely the same readers, as to have it seen in one.”
21:818:71197:0:16:72:444:709:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:we want to avoid complications related to estimating models with multiple equilibria.
21:819:71282:16:15:88:539:693:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:To meet these goals and still maintain tractability, we combine a relatively rich incomplete information
21:820:71386:15:15:72:539:678:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:model of affiliation choice with a more stylized complete-information model of the entry stage in the style
21:821:71493:15:16:72:539:663:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:of Bresnahan and Reiss (1991).   In the affiliation stage,firms’ decisions  are based on both idiosyncratic
21:822:71600:16:15:72:540:647:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:and market-level  unobservables.   They condition  on the choices  of past  movers,  and take account  of the
21:823:71709:15:15:72:539:632:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:way their decisions will affect those who come later.  In the entry stage, by contrast,firms do not yet know
21:824:71817:15:16:72:540:617:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:their idiosyncratic shocks, and so they are all symmetric. Equilibrium is determined by a simple optimality
21:825:71924:16:15:72:529:601:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:condition, though it still requires numerical integration over the market-level shock as in Mazzeo (2002).
21:826:72030:15:15:88:540:586:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:An important departure from Bresnahan and Reiss (1991) is that we allow the distribution offixed costs
21:827:72132:15:16:71:539:571:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:to depend on market size.  We do this because newspapers’fixed investments, notably editorial costs, are
21:828:72236:16:15:71:539:555:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:endogenous to the quality of the newspaper and hence to the size of the market served (Berry and Waldfogel
21:829:72342:15:15:71:540:540:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:2010).  In section 8 we report evidence that our estimates of thefixed costs of newspapers of different size
21:830:72450:15:15:71:539:525:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:are a good match to the data. In appendix A we show that ourfindings are robust to allowing a moreflexible
21:831:72556:15:16:72:329:510:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:dependence of the distribution offixed costs on population.
21:832:72615:16:15:88:539:494:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:Among the many restrictive assumptions our model embeds, two are particularly important.  First, we
21:833:72714:15:15:72:539:479:119:g_d0_f1:64:Times:B:assume  that  entry  decisions  precede  affiliation  decisions,  withfirms only  learning  their  cost  shocksξjm
21:834:72828:15:16:72:539:464:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:post-entry.15This is clearly an abstraction.  The most important substantive cost is that we shut down entry
21:835:72936:16:15:72:539:448:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:deterrence incentives in affiliation choice. The benefits are that we simplify computation dramatically, since

25:1061:86225:15:15:72:153:453:119:g_d0_f1:64:g_d0_f1:B:is less important.19
25:1062:86245:15:16:88:539:438:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:Our model implies that readership overlaps more between papers of the same affiliation than papers of
25:1063:86346:16:15:72:540:422:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:different affiliations, a fact consistent with evidence reported in the supplemental appendix from our reader-
25:1064:86456:15:15:72:540:407:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:ship surveys. For example, in data simulated from our model for two-paper markets, the average readership
25:1065:86561:15:15:72:539:392:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:overlap  for same-affiliation  papers  is 17 percent,  compared  to 14 percent  for opposite-affiliation  papers.
25:1066:86674:15:16:72:540:377:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:This results from the strong taste for like-minded news (β−β) outweighing the greater substitutability of
25:1067:86779:16:15:72:539:361:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:same-affiliation papers (Γs>Γd).20As noted above, it implies that advertising competition will increase
25:1068:86882:15:15:72:231:346:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:incentives to differentiate politically.
25:1069:86922:15:16:88:540:331:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:The estimated parameters of thefixed cost distribution appear reasonable. In simulation wefind that the
25:1070:87025:16:15:72:539:315:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:meanfixed cost of monopoly newspapers is $9.03 per copy, as against $7.73 in the Inland Press data.  The
25:1071:87129:15:15:72:540:300:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:concept measured by the model incorporates sunk costs and opportunity costs that may not be reflected in
25:1072:87233:15:16:72:539:285:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f1:B:financial data, so it is intuitive that the estimatedfixed costs are somewhat higher than those in the Inland
25:1073:87342:16:15:72:539:269:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:Press data.  The model implies thatfixed costs per capita decline very slowly with the size of the market: a
25:1074:87450:15:15:72:539:254:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:ten percent increase in population reducesfixed costs per capita by only 6 cents. This is consistent with the
25:1075:87559:15:15:72:539:239:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:Inland Press data, which show essentially no relationship betweenfixed costs per copy and the number of
25:1076:87662:15:16:72:123:224:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:copies sold.
25:1077:87674:16:15:88:540:208:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:In the supplemental appendix, we present estimates of the main regression specifications in tables 3 and
25:1078:87778:15:15:72:539:193:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:4 using data simulated from the model at the estimated parameters. We also present afigure illustrating the
25:1079:87885:15:16:72:540:178:119:g_d0_f3:119:g_d0_f1:B:fit of the entry model.  These regressions andfigure show that the estimated modelfits key features of the
25:1080:87991:16:15:72:540:162:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:data well on the whole. An important exception is that the model under-predicts the number of large markets
25:1081:88098:15:17:72:540:147:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:with two papers relative to the number with one or three, possibly due to the functional form imposed by
25:1082:88202:17:14:84:539:130:49:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:19The fact that unobservables are less important in the supply model than in the demand model may come from the fact that
25:1083:88323:14:11:71:539:116:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:county vote share is a better proxy for the ideology of large markets than of small towns.  In the supplemental appendix we show
25:1084:88451:11:11:71:539:105:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:that unobserved heterogeneity matters in the sense that estimates of key demand parameters change meaningfully when we omit

26:1093:89269:15:15:72:540:632:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:factual scenarios.  We measure diversity in three ways:  the number of markets with diverse papers (at least
26:1094:89377:15:16:72:540:617:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:one paper of each type), the share of households in a market with diverse papers, and the share of households
26:1095:89486:16:15:72:242:601:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:reading at least one paper of each type.

26:1101:90059:16:15:71:539:509:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:portance of competition, consumer tastes, and idiosyncratic factors, respectively, in determining equilibrium

26:1104:90284:15:16:71:539:464:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:falls by half.  Eliminating catering to consumer tastes increases diversity by about as much as competition
26:1105:90391:16:32:71:495:448:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:reduces it. Eliminating the role of idiosyncratic factors matters less than eliminating competition.

26:1113:91159:15:15:72:540:302:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:per reader per year is $11.24.  Total surplus is $4.24 per household per year, which breaks down into $3.44

27:1148:93018:16:15:71:539:601:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:papers increases from 143 to 175.  This occurs because newspapers  do not capture the full surplus from

27:1155:93670:16:15:71:539:494:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:of the social optimum. The social planner increases the number of markets with at least one paper from 951

27:1161:94249:16:15:72:540:402:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:result  is not mechanical.   In the standard  symmetric logit model,  which our model nests as a limit case,
27:1162:94357:15:15:72:539:387:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:the number offirms in the free entry equilibrium can be greater or fewer than thefirst-best (Anderson et

27:1164:94570:16:15:72:539:356:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:of surplus and because the significant (and empirically realistic) amount of multiple readership means the

27:1167:94889:16:15:72:373:310:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:is large, and equilibrium entry is consequently found to be excessive.
27:1168:94959:15:15:88:539:295:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:Because the use of a symmetric logit error is known to exaggerate the benefits from additional variety, in

28:1186:96627:15:16:71:539:617:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:slightly,  as a consequence  of less overlap in newspaper  readership.   The number of markets with two or

28:1188:96838:15:15:71:539:586:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:in competitiveness, so total newspaper profit increases only slightly, while consumer surplus and advertiser
28:1189:96946:15:16:71:539:571:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:profit both fall.  Additional entry also offsets the reduced incentive to differentiate due to softer price com-

28:1191:97168:15:15:71:258:540:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:slightly, while the share reading them falls.

28:1199:97958:15:16:72:540:418:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:household per year.  The large increase in entry more than offsets the reduced incentive to differentiate due
28:1200:98067:16:15:72:454:402:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:to reduced advertising competition, and so diversity rises by about half on all measures.

28:1230:99117:8:14:84:539:152:49:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:24We assume that papers in joint operating agreements keep all of their own subscription revenue and that they share advertising
28:1231:99245:14:11:71:539:138:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:revenue in proportion to their circulations. These assumptions are a reasonable match to the revenue-sharing arrangements of joint
28:1232:99375:11:11:71:539:127:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:operating agreements  authorized under the Newspaper  Preservation Act of 1970 (Busterna and Picard,  1993).  In some cases a
28:1233:99500:11:11:72:540:116:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:newspaper’s share of revenue is a “sliding” function of the newspaper’s contribution to revenue or to total advertising sales.  In
28:1234:99630:11:11:72:540:105:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:other cases, the revenue sharing rule isfixed in advance, but in such cases is usually related to the initial capital investment of the
28:1235:99765:11:11:72:540:94:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:newspapers, and hence to theirfinancial health at the time of the agreement.  In both types of arrangements, a newspaper with a
28:1236:99892:11:8:72:402:83:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:greater circulation will generally be entitled to a greater share of the joint venture’s revenue.

29:1245:100820:16:15:71:539:601:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:by assuming that entering newspapers set collusive circulation and advertising prices as in joint operating

29:1249:101164:15:15:88:539:540:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:A:Joint ownership significantly reduces welfare, diversity, and the number of newspapers. Circulation and

29:1251:101376:16:15:71:539:509:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:of reduced entry; the share of multi-paper markets with diverse papers remains roughly stable. This reflects

29:1258:102035:16:15:72:540:402:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:postal subsidies offset a meaningful fraction of newspaper delivery costs for many newspapers (Kielbowicz
29:1259:102140:15:15:72:539:387:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:1994).  We allow the government to transferKdollars per newspaper sold to the newspaper’s owner, at a

29:1263:102510:15:16:72:540:326:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:year, equivalent to a 49 percent reduction in marginal cost. For comparison, the US postal subsidy amounted
29:1264:102617:16:15:72:539:310:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:to a roughly 12 percent reduction in marginal cost.28Of all the policies we consider, this one is the most
29:1265:102723:15:15:72:540:295:119:g_d0_f1:119:g_d0_f1:B:effective in increasing economic welfare and diversity, both because it promotes entry in markets that previ-

29:1273:103405:11:11:71:540:138:80:g_d0_f1:80:g_d0_f1:F:is less common, though it does exist. In France, for example, no newspaper acquisition will be approved if the combined entity will
