2:23:895:30:21:71:539:580:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:In numerous studies, economists have found little empirical evidence that environmental regulations
2:24:994:21:20:71:539:559:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:affect trade flows. In this paper, we propose and test several common explanations for why the effect
2:25:1095:20:20:71:539:539:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:of environmental regulations on trade may be difficult to detect. We demonstrate that while most
2:26:1191:20:21:71:539:519:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:trade occurs among industrialized economies, environmental regulations have stronger effects on
2:27:1286:21:20:71:540:498:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:trade between industrialized and developing economies. We find that for most industries, pollution
2:28:1384:20:20:71:539:478:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:abatement costs are a small component of total costs, and are unrelated to trade flows. In addition,
2:29:1484:20:21:71:539:458:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:we show that those industries with the largest pollution abatement costs also happen to be the least
2:30:1584:21:20:71:539:437:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:geographically  mobile,  or  "footloose."  After  accounting  for  these  distinctions,  we  measure  a
2:31:1687:20:20:71:539:417:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:significant  effect  of  pollution  abatement  costs  on  imports  from  developing  countries,  and  in
2:32:1791:20:33:71:265:397:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:pollution-intensive, footloose industries.

3:47:2227:0:27:71:148:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:1. Introduction
3:48:2242:27:28:71:531:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: Conventional wisdom in the U.S. is that environmental regulations have diminished the 
3:49:2328:28:27:71:554:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ability of U.S. manufacturers to compete internationally, and thus have contributed to the relocation 
3:50:2430:27:28:71:535:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of the U.S. manufacturing sector overseas and to the growing U.S. trade deficit.  Discussion has 
3:51:2527:28:28:71:518:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:centered on the extent to which environmental regulations have imposed significant costs on 
3:52:2619:28:27:71:535:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pollution-intensive industries located in the U.S., and the extent to which these regulations have 
3:53:2718:27:28:71:551:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:caused pollution-intensive industries to migrate to less regulated countries (the so-called “pollution 
3:54:2821:28:27:71:560:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:haven hypothesis”).  The argument that stringent environmental regulations could affect comparative 
3:55:2921:27:28:71:554:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:advantage, altering international patterns of trade, is fairly intuitive and has considerable theoretical 
3:56:3027:28:27:71:544:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:support.1   However, there has been little empirical support for the proposition that environmental 
3:57:3127:27:28:71:541:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:regulations affect trade.  In a survey article, Jaffe, Peterson, Portney and Stavins (1995) conclude 
3:58:3227:28:28:71:546:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:that while environmental regulations do impose large and significant costs on polluting industries, 
3:59:3327:28:27:71:424:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:these costs have not appreciably affected patterns of international trade.   
3:60:3404:27:28:71:546:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: Given that the United States is the only country that has collected pollution abatement cost 
3:61:3497:28:27:71:549:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:data for a significant period of time, researchers have limited options for exploring the relationship 
3:62:3600:27:28:71:534:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:between environmental regulations and competitiveness.  Previous studies have either taken the 
3:63:3695:28:28:71:530:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:approach of examining the effects of environmental controls on U.S. net imports (e.g., see Kalt 
3:64:3791:28:27:71:548:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(1988) and Grossman and Krueger (1993)), or examining international trade patterns by relying on 
3:65:3888:27:28:71:558:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:qualitative measures of regulatory stringency in different countries (e.g., see Tobey (1977)).  Neither 
3:66:3992:28:27:71:536:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of these methods has resulted in quantitatively significant or robust evidence that environmental 
3:67:4090:27:28:71:538:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:regulations influence trade patterns.  However, given the underlying logic of the pollution haven 
3:68:4188:28:43:71:543:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:hypothesis, researchers continue to attempt to explain why effects of environmental regulation on 
3:69:4286:43:8:71:218:86:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:                                                 
3:70:4334:8:0:71:422:78:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:1See Pethig (1976), Siebert (1977), McGuire (1982), and Copeland and Taylor (1994). 
4:71:4419:0:27:71:525:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:competitiveness are so difficult to detect.2  In this paper we provide and test several candidate 
4:72:4517:27:28:71:546:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:explanations for the lack of evidence on the pollution haven hypothesis.  These explanations share 
4:73:4616:28:27:71:534:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the assumption that there is underlying heterogeneity in the relationship between environmental 
4:74:4712:27:28:71:436:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:regulations and trade flows that has been overlooked in previous research.   
4:75:4789:28:28:71:539:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: Our first candidate explanation is that most trade takes place among developed countries, 
4:76:4879:28:27:71:521:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:which share similarly high levels of environmental stringency.3  As a result, the U.S. imports 
4:77:4974:27:28:71:526:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:relatively more from countries with relatively stringent regulations, a seeming violation of the 
4:78:5071:28:27:71:543:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pollution haven hypothesis.  Empirical work that aggregates trade flows across multiple countries 
4:79:5169:27:28:71:560:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:may mask significant effects of environmental costs for countries with distinct patterns of regulation. 
4:80:5273:28:27:71:515:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: Our second hypothesis is that some industries are less geographically mobile, due to 
4:81:5358:27:28:71:558:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:transportation costs, plant fixed costs, or agglomeration economies.  Consequently, these less mobile 
4:82:5460:28:28:71:553:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industries will be insensitive to differences in regulatory stringency between countries because they 
4:83:5562:28:27:71:553:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:are unable to relocate easily.  Cross-industry regressions that average over multiple industries could 
4:84:5665:27:28:71:511:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:conceal the effect of environmental regulations on trade in the more “footloose” industries. 
4:85:5758:28:27:71:516:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: Finally, our third candidate explanation is that, for all but the most heavily regulated 
4:86:5847:27:28:71:525:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industries, environmental regulation represents only a small portion of total production costs.  
4:87:5944:28:28:71:494:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Therefore, for the majority of industries, the effect of differences in these small costs is 
4:88:6037:28:27:71:553:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:overwhelmed by differences in the prices of more important factors, and by noise in the data.  Once 
4:89:6137:27:34:71:505:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:again, empirical approaches that average over multiple industries could mask the fact that 
4:90:6228:34:8:71:218:178:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:                                                 
4:91:6276:8:16:71:520:170:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:2 For example, Ederington and Minier (2003) and Levinson (2003) argue that previous research has found little 
4:92:6386:16:11:71:490:154:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:evidence for the pollution haven hypothesis because it treats the level of environmental regulation as an 
4:93:6492:11:12:71:515:143:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:exogenous variable.  Using instrumental variables, they find statistically significant, economically meaningful 
4:94:6604:12:11:71:523:131:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:negative effects of environmental regulations on economic activities when the level of environmental regulation 
4:95:6716:11:7:71:174:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:is treated as endogenous. 
4:96:6742:7:16:71:518:113:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:3 In addition, even when there are substantial differences in regulations across countries, these differences may 
4:97:6856:16:12:71:521:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:be temporary given the tendency for convergence in environmental standards across countries.  Thus, given the 
4:98:6966:12:11:71:510:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:costs of relocation, foresighted industries may not pursue the short-term gains from locating in less regulated 
4:99:7078:11:0:71:97:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:areas. 
5:100:7086:0:27:71:512:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:environmental regulations do affect trade in those industries where environmental costs are 
5:101:7178:27:28:71:559:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:significant.  Moreover, the most polluting industries may be the least footloose, making the pollution 
5:102:7281:28:27:71:512:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:haven effect particularly difficult to detect.  In the following sections, we test each of these 
5:103:7378:27:28:71:178:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:explanations in turn.

5:105:7402:28:27:71:251:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:2.  Baseline empirical specification 
5:106:7439:27:28:71:560:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: The only country that has collected pollution abatement cost data for a significant time period 
5:107:7535:28:27:71:556:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:is the United States, in the form of the Pollution Abatement Costs and Expenditures (PACE) survey, 
5:108:7634:27:28:71:553:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:which publishes manufacturers’ pollution abatement costs at the 4-digit industry level.  Because the 
5:109:7735:28:27:71:525:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:PACE pertains to U.S. manufacturers, the only way to use these data to estimate the effects of 
5:110:7830:27:28:71:553:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:environmental regulations on trade is to compare imports and exports from the U.S. as a function of 
5:111:7930:28:28:71:546:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industry characteristics.  This is the methodology employed by Grossman and Krueger (1991) in a 
5:112:8026:28:27:71:553:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:cross section, and by Ederington and Minier (2003) and Levinson (2003) exploiting the panel data.  
5:113:8125:27:28:71:549:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:In this paper we use a panel data set, constructed by Ederington and Minier (2003) which includes,

5:121:8669:8:16:71:497:148:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:4 We update the Ederington and Minier (2003) dataset by using the recently revised Feenstra (1996,1997)

5:124:8914:8:16:71:519:113:42:Courier:100:g_d0_f3:5While trade economists recognize that a cross-industry regression of trade flows on factor intensities is not a

5:126:9137:12:11:71:492:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:variables in the regression is simply to act as industry controls to better address the relationship between

6:131:9386:28:28:71:544:676:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The dependent variable (Mit) is net import penetration: U.S. imports minus exports scaled by total 
6:132:9485:28:28:71:556:648:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:U.S. shipments in industry i at time t.  The stringency of environmental regulations (Eit) is measured 
6:133:9588:28:29:71:551:620:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:by the ratio of pollution abatement costs to total costs of materials, while τ is estimated by dividing 
6:134:9692:29:28:71:528:591:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:duties paid by total import volume to give a measure of average ad valorem tariffs.  The factor 
6:135:9787:28:27:71:550:563:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:intensity variables measure the human and physical capital intensity of each industry.  To calculate 
6:136:9888:27:28:71:556:536:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the (direct) factor shares of both types of capital, we follow a procedure suggested by Grossman and 
6:137:9989:28:27:71:551:508:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Krueger (1991) in which the payroll expenses of an industry are divided into payments to unskilled 
6:138:10088:27:28:71:544:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:labor and human capital and then scaled by value added.  The remaining portion of value added is 
6:139:10185:28:27:71:551:453:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:assumed to be payments to physical capital.  We discuss these variables in more detail in Appendix 
6:140:10284:27:28:71:475:426:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A, and descriptive statistics for these variables appear in the first column of table 1. 
6:141:10373:28:28:71:549:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: For comparison to previous empirical work, we begin by estimating equation (1), with year 
6:142:10463:28:27:71:541:370:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and industry fixed effects.6  Here the estimated coefficient on environmental costs (0.20) is small 
6:143:10563:27:28:71:557:343:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and statistically insignificant.  The other coefficient estimates in table 1 are as expected: both human 
6:144:10668:28:27:71:522:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and physical capital are sources of comparative advantage for the U.S. (indicated by negative 
6:145:10762:27:28:71:543:288:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:coefficient estimates), and higher tariffs are correlated with lower net imports.  To understand the 
6:146:10863:28:28:71:549:260:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:magnitude of the estimated effect of environmental costs, consider it in elasticity terms.  Evaluated 
6:147:10965:28:27:71:556:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:at the means of the environmental cost and net import variables, the implied elasticity is about 0.04.  
6:148:11069:27:28:71:555:205:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A 20 percent increase in the environmental costs faced by an industry, relative to other industries, is 
6:149:11173:28:68:71:506:177:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:associated with less than a one percent increase in net import penetration in that industry.  
6:150:11267:68:8:71:218:109:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:                                                 
6:151:11315:8:16:71:505:101:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:6 During the empirical estimation we discovered that our import regression was sensitive to the inclusion of 
6:152:11424:16:11:71:522:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:outlying observations.  We used an approach suggested by Hadi (1992, 1994) to identify outliers in our dataset; 
6:153:11536:11:0:71:502:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:these eight outliers (0.2% of the full sample) were excluded from the analysis. See Appendix A for details. 
7:154:11645:0:27:71:513:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: As is typical in the empirical literature, simple correlations between net imports and 
7:155:11732:27:28:71:522:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:environmental regulations fail to uncover a strong relationship.  However, table 2 presents an 
7:156:11827:28:27:71:541:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:estimate of the average effect of environmental regulations on total trade flows between the U.S. 
7:157:11925:27:28:71:503:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and all other countries, for all industries.  We may be missing some important underlying 
7:158:12015:28:28:71:541:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:heterogeneity across industries or countries in the relationship between regulatory stringency and 
7:159:12114:28:27:71:529:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:competitiveness.  In the following sections, we discuss and test several theories of the possible 
7:160:12212:27:34:71:222:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:sources of such heterogeneity.  
7:161:12244:34:27:71:74:509:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4: 
7:162:12244:27:28:71:312:482:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:3. Trade with high and low-standard countries 
7:163:12290:28:27:71:530:454:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: The first hypothesis we investigate is whether similarities (or expected convergence) in 
7:164:12379:27:28:71:505:427:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:environmental standards across countries obscure the relationship between environmental 
7:165:12467:28:28:71:510:399:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:regulations and trade flows.   Specifically, most of the world’s trade volume occurs among 
7:166:12558:28:27:71:553:371:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:developed countries, which have similar levels of environmental standards.  Consequently, the U.S. 
7:167:12657:27:28:71:560:344:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:imports relatively more from countries with relatively stringent regulations.  Moreover, if differences 
7:168:12761:28:27:71:530:316:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in regulations between developed countries are perceived as temporary, then given the costs of 
7:169:12856:27:28:71:511:289:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:relocation, industries may not pursue the short-term gains from locating in temporarily less 
7:170:12949:28:28:71:210:261:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:stringently regulated areas.   
7:171:12980:28:27:71:551:233:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: As a test of this hypothesis, we reconstruct the data by dividing trade flows in each industry 
7:172:13075:27:28:71:556:206:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:into trade with countries with high environmental standards (i.e., similar to the U.S.), and those with 
7:173:13179:28:27:71:560:178:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:low environmental standards; we also use high- and low-income countries to proxy for differences in 
7:174:13279:27:28:71:544:151:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:environmental standards.  The idea is that an increase in U.S. environmental standards will have a 
7:175:13378:28:28:71:540:123:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:greater effect on U.S. trade with low-standard countries than with other high-standard countries.  
7:176:13477:28:0:71:555:95:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The reason for this is two-fold.  First, during the time period of our empirical analysis (1978-92), an 
8:177:13582:0:27:71:559:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:increase in U.S. environmental regulations was less likely to be matched by a comparable increase in 
8:178:13683:27:28:71:537:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:environmental regulations in countries with low environmental standards.  Second, even if firms 
8:179:13779:28:27:71:546:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:believed the increase in U.S. environmental regulations would eventually be matched in the future 
8:180:13877:27:28:71:557:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:by regulatory increases in other countries, the time horizon for that convergence is likely to be much 
8:181:13980:28:28:71:555:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:longer in the low-standard country, making firms more likely to pursue the gains to relocating to the 
8:182:14082:28:27:71:185:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:low-standard country.   
8:183:14106:27:28:71:551:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: We use two different methods of dividing our sample into trade with high and low-standard 
8:184:14196:28:27:71:537:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:countries.  First, in columns (1) and (2) of table 2, we divide the trading partners of the U.S. into 
8:185:14298:27:28:71:540:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:OECD and non-OECD countries under the assumption that OECD countries have environmental 
8:186:14386:28:27:71:535:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:standards more comparable to the U.S. than do non-OECD countries.  Note that the explanatory 
8:187:14479:27:28:71:552:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:variables for each industry are identical in the two regressions (and identical to the panel regression 
8:188:14583:28:28:71:532:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of column (2) of table 1).  The difference is that the dependent variable is net imports to OECD 
8:189:14680:28:27:71:547:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:countries in column (1) and net imports to non-OECD countries in column (2).  Second, we divide 
8:190:14776:27:28:71:530:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:trade based on an environmental stringency ranking provided by Eliste and Fredriksson (2002) 
8:191:14869:28:27:71:564:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:which is based on the rankings of Dasgupta et.al. (1995); these results appear in columns (3) and (4).   
8:192:14974:27:28:71:556:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: The environmental stringency index in Eliste and Fredriksson (2002) covers 61 countries for 
8:193:15066:28:28:71:510:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:agricultural industries and 30 countries for manufacturing industries.  Since the correlation 
8:194:15160:28:27:71:552:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:coefficient between agricultural and manufacturing stringency is 0.96 for the 30 countries with data 
8:195:15261:27:28:71:559:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:on both, we use the agricultural index to maximize country coverage.  The ranking ranges from 49 to 
8:196:15361:28:27:71:548:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:186: the U.S. rank is 186 and the median is 92. We divided the sample between 117 (South Korea) 
8:197:15457:27:28:71:528:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and 133 (Greece), which is the largest break in the data.  This gives us 20 countries in the high 
8:198:15555:28:32:71:510:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:environmental standards sample, and 33 countries in the low-standard sample.7  Again, the 
8:199:15645:32:7:71:218:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:                                                 
8:200:15693:7:16:71:522:90:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:7 Trade with 43 countries is omitted from this division due to missing data on environmental standards for these 
8:201:15806:16:0:71:139:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:trading partners. 
9:202:15825:0:27:71:525:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:dependent variable is net imports from these countries in regressions 3 and 4 respectively; the 
9:203:15921:27:28:71:411:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:explanatory variables are identical for each industry-year observation. 
9:204:15993:28:27:71:495:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: For each sample we estimate equation (1).  In both cases, the results support our 
9:205:16075:27:28:71:522:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:interpretation.  Specifically, while the coefficient on environmental costs is negative (and not 
9:206:16172:28:28:71:561:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:statistically significant) for trade with the OECD countries, it is positive (and statistically significant) 
9:207:16281:28:27:71:540:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:for the non-OECD countries.8  Intuitively, while an increase in U.S. environmental costs will not 
9:208:16379:27:28:71:507:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:have a significant impact on trade with other OECD countries, it will lead to a statistically 
9:209:16473:28:27:71:533:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:significant increase in net imports from developing countries.  In addition, while the coefficient 
9:210:16572:27:28:71:552:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:estimate on environmental costs for non-OECD countries (0.25) is comparable in magnitude to that 
9:211:16669:28:27:71:534:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:for the full sample (0.20), this implies a larger, more quantitatively significant effect since trade 
9:212:16771:27:28:71:556:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:volume is lower than in the full sample.  Specifically, evaluated at the means of environmental costs 
9:213:16873:28:28:71:560:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and net imports (scaled by industry size), the implied elasticity is about 0.2 for trade with non-OECD 
9:214:16976:28:27:71:558:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:countries (about five times greater than the elasticity for the full sample).  Thus, we do find evidence 
9:215:17081:27:28:71:556:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:that estimating the average effect of an increase in environmental costs over all trade understates the 
9:216:17185:28:27:71:523:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:effect such an increase in regulatory stringency has on trade with low income or low standard 
9:217:17279:27:28:71:130:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:countries.    
9:218:17293:28:28:71:74:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: 
9:219:17293:28:27:71:200:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:4. “Footloose” industries 
9:220:17319:27:28:71:558:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: The second hypothesis that we investigate is whether the relationship between environmental 
9:221:17411:28:27:71:518:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:regulations and trade flows is obscured because pollution-intensive industries tend to be less 
9:222:17506:27:28:71:517:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:geographically mobile, or “footloose,” than other industries.  As is common in the empirical 
9:223:17599:28:20:71:560:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:literature on trade and the environment, in section 2 we estimated the average effect of an increase in 
9:224:17703:20:8:71:218:109:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:                                                 
9:225:17751:8:16:71:501:101:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:8  Perhaps not surprisingly, our results suggest that human and physical capital are sources of comparative 
9:226:17859:16:11:71:515:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:advantage for the U.S. only with respect to trade with low-income countries (indicated by negative coefficient 
9:227:17970:11:0:71:116:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:estimates). 
10:228:17983:0:27:71:524:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:environmental regulation on net imports across U.S. manufacturing industries.  However, this 
10:229:18076:27:28:71:557:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:approach ignores the fact that an increase in environmental costs will likely have different effects on 
10:230:18180:28:27:71:513:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:different industries.  Some industries (because of high transport or relocation costs) may be 
10:231:18274:27:28:71:554:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:insensitive to changing comparative advantage or changes in production cost, while other industries 
10:232:18374:28:28:71:561:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(the footloose industries) are more sensitive.  Cross-industry regressions that find little average effect 
10:233:18481:28:27:71:553:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:could conceal the relationship in more mobile industries. In what follows we explore three potential 
10:234:18582:27:28:71:543:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:determinants of geographic immobility: transportation costs in product markets, plant fixed costs, 
10:235:18681:28:27:71:552:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and agglomeration economies.  Complete definitions, data sources, and descriptive statistics appear 
10:236:18781:27:28:71:148:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in Appendix A. 
10:237:18796:28:27:71:547:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: Our first measure of industry mobility is the product-market transport costs of an industry.  
10:238:18890:27:28:71:516:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Consider a high-transport-cost industry, such as cement (SIC 324).  Even a large increase in 
10:239:18983:28:28:71:554:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:environmental costs will not significantly affect cement trade flows, because transport costs prevent 
10:240:19085:28:27:71:552:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:cement manufacturers from locating far from customers.  By contrast, a low-transport-cost industry 
10:241:19184:27:28:71:520:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:can more freely relocate and will be more sensitive to environmental cost changes.  Thus our 
10:242:19277:28:27:71:533:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:hypothesis is that an increase in environmental costs will have a greater effect on net imports in 
10:243:19376:27:28:71:540:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industries with low transport costs.  We estimate the product market transportation costs for each 
10:244:19475:28:28:71:400:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industry by using freight costs controlling for the distance shipped.9 
10:245:19545:28:27:71:524:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: Our second measure of immobility is the fixed plant costs of an industry.  Consider an 
10:246:19632:27:28:71:538:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industry with significant plant costs, such as building, paper and board mills (SIC 266).  Such an 
10:247:19731:28:27:71:549:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industry would be less likely to relocate or change jurisdictions because the relocation would incur 
10:248:19832:27:28:71:536:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:significant costs, specifically the sinking of a large amount of investment into a plant in the new 
10:249:19932:28:32:71:540:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:jurisdiction.  Industries with large fixed costs may be less sensitive to increases in environmental 
10:250:20033:32:7:71:218:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:                                                 
10:251:20081:7:16:71:521:90:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:9 Specifically, we use the fixed effects coefficients from a regression of transport costs on distance and distance 
10:252:20197:16:0:71:403:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:squared for the 15 largest trading partners of the U.S.; for details see Appendix A. 
11:253:20284:0:27:71:503:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:costs, since the costs of relocation might outweigh the gains to locating in a less stringent 
11:254:20378:27:28:71:561:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:jurisdiction, especially if differences in environmental regulations between jurisdictions were viewed 
11:255:20481:28:27:71:523:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:as temporary.  Alternatively, an industry with few fixed costs might aggressively pursue even 
11:256:20575:27:28:71:531:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:temporary sources of comparative advantage since the costs of relocation are smaller. Thus our 
11:257:20670:28:28:71:533:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:hypothesis is that an increase in environmental costs will have a greater effect on net imports in 
11:258:20769:28:27:71:555:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industries with low plant costs.  As a measure of fixed plant costs, we use data from the NBER-CES 
11:259:20868:27:28:71:541:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Manufacturing Industry Database of Bartelsman, Becker and Gray on real capital structures in an 
11:260:20964:28:27:71:116:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industry. 
11:261:20974:27:28:107:543:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Our third measure of immobility is the extent of agglomeration economies of an industry.  
11:262:21064:28:27:71:550:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:While the sources of agglomeration economies are varied (e.g., knowledge spillovers, labor market 
11:263:21162:27:28:71:529:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pooling), the effect is that firms will have an incentive to locate near one another.  Consider an 
11:264:21261:28:28:71:551:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industry with significant agglomeration economies, such as SIC 227, floor covering mills.  Such an 
11:265:21360:28:27:71:555:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industry may be insensitive to changes in environmental costs if the gain to remaining close to other 
11:266:21462:27:28:71:529:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:firms in the industry outweighs the gain from relocating to a less regulated jurisdiction.10  This 
11:267:21561:28:27:71:534:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:reasoning parallels that commonly given to explain how patterns of specialization can persist in 
11:268:21658:27:28:71:560:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:international trade even as relative production costs change over time.  Thus our hypothesis is that an 
11:269:21762:28:28:71:530:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:increase in environmental costs will have a larger effect on net imports in industries with small 
11:270:21860:28:27:71:557:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:external economies.  To estimate the extent of external economies in an industry, we use an index of 
11:271:21961:27:69:71:532:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:geographic concentration of U.S. manufacturing industries from Ellison and Glaeser (1997).11   
11:272:22056:69:7:71:218:143:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:                                                 
11:273:22104:7:16:71:489:136:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:10 Note that external economies of scale in an industry could lead to a situation where it would be in the 
11:274:22211:16:7:71:505:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:industry’s best interest to change jurisdictions, but not in any firm’s individual interest to do so unilaterally. 
11:275:22326:7:16:71:507:113:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:11 Note that since the Ellison and Glaeser (1997) index is based on geographic concentration, it is not a pure 
11:276:22437:16:12:71:521:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:measure of agglomeration economies and thus industrial immobility.  Specifically, very mobile firms migrating 
11:277:22547:12:11:71:503:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:to an area of comparative advantage could also lead to a geographically concentrated industry, and such an 
11:278:22654:11:0:71:373:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:industry would remain sensitive to changes in environmental regulations.   
12:279:22731:0:27:107:548:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The results are in table 3, where we add interaction terms between environmental costs and 
12:280:22822:27:28:71:511:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:these three measures of immobility, as calculated as in Appendix A, to equation (1).  If our 
12:281:22915:28:27:71:521:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:hypotheses are correct, these interactive terms will have negative coefficients, indicating that 
12:282:23012:27:28:71:552:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:changes in environmental costs only have large effects on trade flows in more footloose industries.  
12:283:23113:28:28:71:543:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:In column (1), the measure of industry immobility is (distance-controlled) transport costs, and the 
12:284:23213:28:27:71:554:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:interaction term is negative and statistically significant.  Evaluated at the average transport costs for 
12:285:23319:27:28:71:555:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:an industry (0.009), this implies a coefficient estimate on environmental costs of 0.17, which is very 
12:286:23422:28:27:71:554:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:similar to that computed in the base regression of Table 1.12  In addition, the negative coefficient on 
12:287:23526:27:28:71:549:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the interactive term implies that, as predicted, industries with above average transport costs will be 
12:288:23629:28:27:71:312:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:less sensitive to changes in environmental costs.   
12:289:23681:27:28:107:538:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Column (2) of table 3 repeats the analysis of column (1), but with plant fixed costs as the 
12:290:23773:28:28:71:559:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:measure of geographic immobility.  In this case, the coefficient estimate for an industry with average 
12:291:23876:28:27:71:556:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:plant costs (0.237) is higher than that of the base regression of table 1 (a coefficient estimate of 0.82 
12:292:23982:27:28:71:542:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:rather than 0.20).  However, as predicted, the negative coefficient on this interactive term implies 
12:293:24083:28:27:71:537:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:that industries with plant costs above (below) average will be less (more) sensitive to changes in 
12:294:24182:27:28:71:546:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:environmental regulations (and this difference is statistically significant).  In column (3) of table 3 
12:295:24286:28:28:71:547:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:we use agglomeration economies as our measure of industry immobility.  Evaluated at the average 
12:296:24382:28:27:71:558:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:degree of agglomeration for an industry (0.051), this implies a coefficient estimate on environmental 
12:297:24484:27:28:71:515:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:costs of 0.22, similar to that calculated in the base regression of Table 1.  As in the previous 
12:298:24581:28:27:71:536:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:regressions, the negative coefficient estimate on the interactive term implies that this coefficient 
12:299:24682:27:48:71:555:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:estimate will be higher for industries with below average agglomeration economies, although in this 
12:300:24782:48:8:71:218:109:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:                                                 
12:301:24830:8:16:71:505:101:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:12  Note that our measure of transport costs is a fixed-effect coefficient, and thus is roughly centered around 
12:302:24940:16:11:71:503:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:zero, with positive measures implying industries with above average transport costs and negative measures 
12:303:25046:11:0:71:314:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:implying industries with lower than average transport costs. 
13:304:25109:0:27:71:546:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:case the interactive term is not statistically significant.  In all three regressions we find support for 
13:305:25215:27:28:71:155:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:our hypotheses.   
13:306:25233:28:27:71:537:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: To compare the quantitative significance of these results, column (4) repeats the analysis 
13:307:25324:27:28:71:544:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:including all three measures of industry immobility.  As can be seen in column (4), the interactive 
13:308:25424:28:28:71:542:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:term on plant costs is the only interactive term that remains statistically significant.  (It is also the 
13:309:25530:28:27:71:523:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:most quantitatively significant, as it explains the majority of the sensitivity differences across 
13:310:25629:27:28:71:525:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industries in the analysis that follows).  Our results suggest that, for an industry which has the 
13:311:25728:28:27:71:555:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:median level of all three immobility measures, an increase in environmental costs of one percentage 
13:312:25828:27:28:71:549:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:point would result in a decrease in net imports of 0.96 percentage points.  Evaluated at the mean of 
13:313:25929:28:27:71:518:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:both environmental cost and net imports, this results in an implied elasticity of about 0.2.  In 
13:314:26026:27:28:71:519:433:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:contrast, in a less mobile industry (in the top 20th percentile of all three measures of industry 
13:315:26124:28:28:71:544:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:immobility), the same increase in environmental costs would result in a decrease in net imports of 
13:316:26223:28:27:71:554:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:only 0.2 percentage points (an implied elasticity of only 0.04).  Likewise, in a more mobile industry 
13:317:26325:27:28:71:555:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(in the bottom 20th  percentile of all three immobility measures), the same increase in environmental 
13:318:26425:28:27:71:553:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:costs would decrease net imports by 1.5 percentage points (an implied elasticity of 0.32,  which is 8 
13:319:26527:27:28:71:551:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:times greater than that for the top 20th percentile).  We interpret this as evidence that estimating the 
13:320:26632:28:28:71:557:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:average effect of an increase in environmental costs over all industries understates the effect such an 
13:321:26736:28:33:71:457:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:increase in regulatory stringency has on trade in the more footloose industries.   
13:322:26819:33:34:71:74:206:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: 
13:323:26819:34:27:71:221:172:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:5. Small environmental costs 
13:324:26848:27:28:71:534:145:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: The final hypothesis that we investigate is whether environmental regulations have little 
13:325:26938:28:28:71:530:117:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:effect on measures of industrial competitiveness because, for all but the most heavily regulated 
13:326:27035:28:0:71:542:89:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industries, the costs of compliance with U.S. environmental regulation make up a relatively small 
14:327:27135:0:27:71:554:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:portion of total production costs.  In our dataset, environmental costs average around one percent of 
14:328:27237:27:28:71:532:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:total material costs.  Thus, the stringency of environmental regulations may not be a significant 
14:329:27335:28:27:71:539:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:determinant of comparative advantage for most U.S. industries, since it may be dwarfed by other 
14:330:27431:27:28:71:538:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:determinants of industry location, such as labor costs or infrastructure.  However, environmental 
14:331:27529:28:28:71:524:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:costs do comprise a large share of total cost for a few pollution-intensive industries (chemical 
14:332:27626:28:27:71:536:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:manufacturing, petroleum, primary metals, etc.).  Environmental regulatory stringency may be a 
14:333:27721:27:28:71:519:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:significant determinant of net imports in these more pollution-intensive industries, and cross-
14:334:27816:28:33:71:548:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industry regressions that estimate the average effect may obscure the effect in high-cost industries. 
14:335:27918:33:28:71:537:482:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: To test this hypothesis, we compute the average of environmental costs for each industry 
14:336:28007:28:27:71:553:454:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:over 1978-92 as a measure of the importance of environmental regulation in that industry.  We then 
14:337:28106:27:28:71:510:427:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:estimate a version of equation (1) in which we include the interaction between the average 
14:338:28196:28:28:71:559:399:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:environmental costs in an industry, and the current level in any year.  If more polluting industries are 
14:339:28301:28:27:71:551:371:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:more sensitive to environmental cost increases, we expect the coefficient on this interactive term to 
14:340:28403:27:28:71:520:344:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:be positive.  Instead, the coefficient in table 4 (-31.13) is negative, although only statistically 
14:341:28503:28:27:71:560:316:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:significant at the 90% level.  This result suggests that the effect of an increase in environmental costs 
14:342:28609:27:34:71:372:289:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:is actually smaller in the more pollution-intensive industries.   
14:343:28675:34:28:71:556:255:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3: One explanation for why industries with large average pollution abatement costs may be less 
14:344:28767:28:27:71:536:227:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:sensitive to increases in those abatement costs over time is because the more pollution-intensive 
14:345:28865:27:28:71:548:200:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industries also may be less footloose.  To test this hypothesis, in column (2) of table 4 we included 
14:346:28967:28:27:71:556:172:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:both an interactive term for average pollution abatement costs and the interactive terms for our three 
14:347:29070:27:28:71:554:145:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:immobility measures.  While the coefficient estimates for our three immobility measures are largely 
14:348:29170:28:28:71:528:117:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:unchanged from table 3, the coefficient estimate on average pollution abatement costs is much 
14:349:29264:28:0:71:559:89:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:smaller than in regression (1) of table 4 (-3.6) and not at all statistically significant.  This result lends 
15:350:29376:0:27:71:548:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:credence to the argument that one reason for the lack of empirical evidence for the pollution haven 
15:351:29476:27:34:71:561:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:hypothesis is the lack of geographic mobility on the part of the more pollution intensive industries.

15:354:29596:34:28:107:552:580:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The lack of empirical support for the proposition that environmental costs affect trade flows 
15:355:29690:28:27:71:543:552:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:has been a puzzle in the trade and environment literature.  In this paper, we propose and test three 
15:356:29791:27:28:71:534:525:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:explanations for why previous research may have failed to find any robust relationship between 
15:357:29886:28:27:71:560:497:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:environmental regulations and trade flows.  We find support for two explanations.  First, we find that 
15:358:29989:27:28:71:547:470:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:estimating the average effect of an increase in environmental costs over all trade flows understates 
15:359:30090:28:27:71:519:442:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the effect of environmental regulations on trade with low-income or low-standard countries.  
15:360:30183:27:28:71:535:415:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Second, we find that estimating the average effect of an increase in environmental costs over all 
15:361:30281:28:28:71:539:387:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industries understates the effect that regulatory stringency has on trade within the geographically 
15:362:30381:28:27:71:531:359:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mobile (i.e., footloose) industries.  Importantly, polluting industries also appear to be relatively 
15:363:30482:27:28:71:530:332:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:immobile.  Failing to take account of this correlation can give the counter-intuitive finding that 
15:364:30581:28:27:71:425:304:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:polluting industries are less sensitive to increases in environmental costs. 
15:365:30658:27:28:107:556:277:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:We find no evidence for our third hypothesis, that trade flows are more sensitive to changing 
15:366:30752:28:28:71:555:249:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:environmental regulations in the more pollution-intensive industries (where environmental costs are 
15:367:30852:28:27:71:519:221:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:a greater percentage of total costs).  In a way, the lack of support for this hypothesis is also a 
15:368:30951:27:28:71:558:194:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:noteworthy finding, as the argument that environmental costs are simply too small in most industries 
15:369:31052:28:27:71:549:166:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:to appreciably affect industry location is one of the most common arguments advanced for the lack 
15:370:31150:27:28:71:543:139:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of empirical evidence for the pollution haven hypothesis.  Indeed, this is typically the explanation 
15:371:31251:28:28:71:549:111:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:that is given both in survey articles (see, e.g., Jaffe, et. al (1995) and Levinson (1996)) and in more 
15:372:31355:28:0:71:554:83:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mainstream discussion of the trade-environmental relationship.  However, we find little relationship 
16:373:31458:0:27:71:520:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:between the stringency of environmental regulations in an industry and the sensitivity of that 
16:374:31553:27:28:71:285:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industry to changes in environmental costs.  
16:375:31598:28:27:107:558:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:In summary, our results suggest that in predicting the effects of environmental regulations on 
16:376:31693:27:28:71:554:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:industries, it is important to account for these industry characteristics:  the amount of trade with low 
16:377:31798:28:28:71:549:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:income countries and the geographic mobility of the industry.  And while this paper focuses on the 
16:378:31897:28:27:71:522:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:effects of environmental regulations, the intuition behind the results applies to any regulatory 
16:379:31994:27:28:71:537:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:change.  It would be an interesting topic of future work to see if the same patterns exist for other 
16:380:32095:28:0:71:398:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:regulations such as health and safety standards or labor regulations.
