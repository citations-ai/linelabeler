2:26:1247:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:We  study  the  consequences  of  dynamic  complementarities  in  the  production  of  child  human 
2:27:1347:14:14:72:545:574:12:Times:12:Times:capital for  the  relationship  between  risk  and  schooling  investment  in  a  low  income  setting.  In 
2:28:1454:14:14:72:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:contrast to previous literature, we explore the ex ante response of schooling to risk. We develop a 
2:29:1553:14:14:71:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:model that incorporates, dynamic complementarity in the education production function, ex-post 
2:30:1647:14:14:71:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:labor  market  responses  by mothers  to  income  shocks,  and  substitutability  between  maternal  and 
2:31:1751:14:14:72:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:child work in the household. We test the model using data from rural India, focusing particularly 
2:32:1848:14:14:72:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:on the schooling of girls. We find that risk substantially reduces the probability that girls attend 
2:33:1948:14:14:72:545:490:12:Times:12:Times:school.  We  then  simulate  the  effects of  an  implicit  social  insurance  program,  modeled  after  the 
2:34:2056:14:14:72:543:476:12:Times:12:Times:National  Rural  Employment  Guarantee Scheme  (NREGS).  Our  results  suggest  that  the  risk-
2:35:2151:14:14:72:546:462:12:Times:12:Times:reducing  effect  of  the  NREGS  may  offset  adverse effects  on  child  education  that  were  evident 
2:36:2256:14:42:72:306:448:12:Times:12:Times:during the NREGS phase-in due to rising wages.

3:50:2608:0:28:72:185:709:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:1    Introduction
3:51:2625:28:16:72:540:681:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Accumulating human capital is an important path to participating in a country’s growth process,
3:52:2720:16:17:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:escaping poverty,  and achieving higher income and prosperity.  However,  we still lack conclusive
3:53:2818:17:16:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:knowledge of how human capital is formed, and what determines the investment in human capital,
3:54:2912:16:16:72:310:632:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and schooling in particular, within the household.
3:55:2962:16:17:88:539:616:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:It is by now well established that economic shocks affect children’s time in school in the absence
3:56:3060:17:16:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of well-functioning markets.  Jacoby and Skoufias (1997) show in the context of India that children
3:57:3159:16:17:72:540:583:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:have  to  drop-out  of  school  and  work  in  case  of  severe  economic  shocks.   Similar  evidence  was
3:58:3266:17:16:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:provided  by  Beegle  et  al.  (2006)  in  the  context  of  Tanzania  and  by  Duryea  et  al.  (2007)  in  the
3:59:3378:16:17:72:540:550:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:context of Brazil.  A related strand of literature has established that children’s school time falls in
3:60:3481:17:16:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the aftermath of economic shocks because households lack the financial resources to send children
3:61:3578:16:16:72:500:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to school (see e.g. Jensen, 2000; Skoufias and Parker, 2006; Gubert and Robilliard, 2008).
3:62:3668:16:17:88:539:501:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Much less attention has been devoted to the possibleex anteeffects of risk on schooling decisions
3:63:3765:17:16:71:539:484:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and human capital accumulation.  Recent works make a strong argument for dynamic complemen-
3:64:3856:16:17:71:539:468:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tarities in the production of human capital (c.f. Cunha and Heckman, 2007; Cunha et al., 2010;
3:65:3950:17:16:71:539:451:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Attanasio et al., 2015).  Dynamic complementarity arises when school investments for a given child
3:66:4048:16:17:71:539:435:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in different periods are complements in the production of human capital.  In such a scenario, the
3:67:4145:17:16:71:539:418:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:returns  to  each  year  of  school  depend  on  past  as  well  as  on  future  investments  in  school.   This
3:68:4257:16:17:71:539:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:relationship also implies that early stage investments in education have to be followed up by in-
3:69:4354:17:16:71:539:385:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:vestments at later stages in order to make that early stage investment productive.  However, the
3:70:4450:16:16:71:539:369:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ability to follow-up on this investment may depend on the realization of shocks in the future.  If
3:71:4548:16:17:71:539:353:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:future school time is not known, then households may be reluctant to invest in schooling in early
3:72:4645:17:16:71:539:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:periods, as they are uncertain about the ability to capture the returns to this investment at later
3:73:4744:16:17:71:539:320:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:stages.  Under such circumstances, the cost of risk in terms of human capital accumulation would
3:74:4840:17:16:71:391:303:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:be considerably higher than the sum of the direct effects of shocks.
3:75:4908:16:17:88:539:287:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A reduction in school time as response to shocks might not only arise from child labor or lack
3:76:5002:17:16:71:539:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in  financial  resources.   Evidence  suggests  that  households  tend  to  increase  their  labor  supply  in
3:77:5112:16:16:71:539:254:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:response to adverse economic shocks (Kochar, 1999; Rose, 2001; Jayachandran, 2006).  If women
3:78:5205:16:17:71:539:238:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:work more in the aftermath of economic shocks, they might have less time available for household
3:79:5301:17:16:71:539:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:activities.   In  the  presence  of  intra-household  substitution,  for  instance  in  the  performance  of
3:80:5409:16:17:71:539:205:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:household chores, increased female labor supply could have negative effects on the time allocation
3:81:5507:17:16:71:539:188:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of their children.  As women have less time available for home production and childcare, and such
3:82:5604:16:17:71:539:172:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:activities can only be foregone at high cost, they might be forced to take older children out of school
3:83:5707:17:16:71:539:155:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:or to cut down on the time they study at home in order for them to fill in for these tasks (Skoufias,
3:84:5808:16:16:71:539:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1993; Ilahi, 2000).1Given that women in India are responsible for most home-production activities,
3:85:5906:16:16:71:539:123:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a labor supply response of mothers might in fact have larger intra-household repercussions than a
3:86:6003:16:15:84:539:107:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:1Shah and Steinberg (2015) for example show that girls in rural India are more likely to drop out of school if their
3:87:6119:15:0:72:239:92:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:mothers’ experience an increase in wages.
4:88:6161:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:labor supply response of fathers.2This also implies that risk might affect the time children spend
4:89:6259:17:16:72:525:692:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in school even in the absence of a child labor market for girls and in contexts of no school fees.
4:90:6357:16:17:88:539:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We study this question in the context in rural India and for girls.  We focus on girls for three
4:91:6453:17:16:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:reasons.  First, previous literature has emphasized the effect of shocks on boys’ labor supply and
4:92:6551:16:17:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:time in school, as they are more likely to be working outside the home than girls.  But while girls are
4:93:6654:17:16:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:not often found to be working outside the home, they are more likely to be performing household
4:94:6749:16:17:72:539:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:chores.  Second, our data suggest that mothers respond to shocks by supplying more laborex post,
4:95:6845:17:16:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:but not fathers.  And given the gendered nature of work in India in general, and of housework in
4:96:6941:16:16:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:particular, girl and mother time are likely to be more closely linked than are boy and mother time,
4:97:7040:16:17:72:540:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:giving us an opportunity to look more closely at underlying mechanisms for any observed responses.
4:98:7138:17:16:72:540:544:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we have no clear way, within the village, of distinguishing
4:99:7236:16:17:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:contemporary effects of risk and future effects of risk.  Because of norms of patrilocal exogamy we
4:100:7335:17:16:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cannot, for men, separately identify the current consumption-smoothing effects of risk on schooling
4:101:7434:16:17:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from longer-term effects of risk on the returns to human capital.  For women, however, who will
4:102:7529:17:16:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:typically leave the village for marriage, we can control for the latter effects by conditioning on risk
4:103:7632:16:16:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:at the level of aggregation of the marriage market (as in Foster and Rosenzweig, 1999) and thus
4:104:7727:16:17:72:239:446:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:isolate the contemporaneous effect.
4:105:7762:17:16:88:539:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This  paper  develops  a  model  of  household  time  allocation  and  human  capital  accumulation
4:106:7861:16:17:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that  highlights  the  effect  of  uncertainty  regarding  future  consumption  on  a  child’s  school  time.
4:107:7970:17:16:72:540:396:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Following  Jacoby  and  Skoufias  (1997),  we  model  schooling  decisions  in  a  unitary  household.   In
4:108:8077:16:17:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:order  to  incorporate  time  allocation  to  home  production,  we  assume  that  the  household  derives
4:109:8183:17:16:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:utility  from  two  consumption  goods,  one  of  which  is  produced  at  home  and  the  other  on  the
4:110:8288:16:16:72:540:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:market.   We  also  assume  that  women  increase  their  labor  supply  in  order  to  cope  with  income
4:111:8394:16:17:72:540:331:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:shocksex  post.  As both the mother and the daughter can perform household chores, shocks not
4:112:8487:17:16:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:only affect labor supply decisions of adult household members, but also reduce the time girls spend
4:113:8586:16:17:72:117:298:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in school.
4:114:8596:17:16:88:539:281:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:By incorporating two periods into the model we are able to show that the presence of risk re-
4:115:8689:16:17:72:540:265:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:duces the time girls spend in school to the extent that marginal utility of second period schooling is
4:116:8791:17:16:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:increasing in first-period schooling.  Whether this is true depends both on the degree of complemen-
4:117:8891:16:17:72:540:232:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tarity in the education production function and the extent of concavity in the preferences for child
4:118:8991:17:16:72:540:215:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:human  capital.   In  particular,  if  household  utility  is  linear  in  child-human  capital  then  negative
4:119:9102:16:16:72:540:199:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:effects are observed except when child school times in different periods are perfect substitutes in
4:120:9201:16:17:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the production of human capital.  In contrast, if household utility is log-linear in human capital,
4:121:9300:17:16:72:540:166:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the predicted effect of risk on school time is negative at high levels of dynamic complementarity

4:123:9466:16:15:84:539:134:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:2The India Time Use survey from 1998/99 revealed that women spend more time than men on activities other
4:124:9570:15:11:72:540:119:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:than leisure.  While women spend 53.4 hours per week on salaried activities and household work combined, men only
4:125:9683:11:11:72:540:108:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:spend 45.6 hours per week on these activities (Government of India, 2000).  Women spend on average 18.7 hours
4:126:9792:11:11:72:540:97:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:per week on wage work and 34.6 hours per week on household-related activities.  These activities are classified as
4:127:9906:11:11:72:540:86:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:extended SNA activities in the Time Use Survey and include household maintenance, as well as care for children,
4:128:10017:11:0:72:137:75:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:sick and elderly.
5:129:10035:0:17:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We therefore explore the case for dynamic complementarity in study hours among children in
5:130:10125:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rural India directly by estimating a production function of cognitive skills.  In the absence of skills
5:131:10228:16:17:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:data  in  the  Rural  Economic  and  Demographic  Survey  (REDS),  we  use  the  Young  Lives  Survey
5:132:10329:17:16:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(YLS)  data  from  Andhra  Pradesh,  a  state  in  the  south  of  India.   While  Attanasio  et  al.  (2015)
5:133:10438:16:17:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:have used these data for a similar study, that paper considers educational expenditures rather than
5:134:10537:17:16:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:study  time.   Using  a  non-linear  instrumental  variables  procedure,  we  cannot  reject  an  elasticity
5:135:10645:16:17:72:540:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of substitution of one between lagged cognitive skills and current study hours in the production
5:136:10741:17:16:72:539:593:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f4:of current cognitive skills.  This elasticity is sufficient, given our model, to produce a negativeex
5:137:10842:16:16:72:539:577:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:anteeffect of risk on schooling if parental utility is linear in human capital but not, for example, if
5:138:10945:16:17:72:290:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:parental utility is log-linear in human capital.
5:139:10993:17:16:88:539:544:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We then test the predictions of our model with the REDS data from 2006.  Our unit of observa-
5:140:11086:16:17:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tion is the mother-daughter pair for girls aged 6 to 16 who live with their mothers.  We observe time
5:141:11187:17:16:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:allocation decision over three different agricultural seasons,  which have a length of four months.
5:142:11286:16:17:72:301:495:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This gives a final sample of 12,918 observations.
5:143:11335:17:16:88:539:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We predict consumption risk at the village level as a function of the historical rainfall distribution
5:144:11437:16:16:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and a village’s share of land that is under irrigation.  Irrigation can mitigate some of the effects of
5:145:11540:16:17:72:540:446:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:adverse rainfall shocks on consumption, such that an increase in the availability of irrigation systems
5:146:11643:17:16:72:540:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in a village contributes to a reduction in the variability of consumption.  Specifically, we estimate
5:147:11744:16:17:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the relationship between consumption, rainfall, village-level agricultural area under irrigation, and
5:148:11845:17:16:72:540:396:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the interaction of these two variables.  Using these estimates,  we predict consumption outcomes
5:149:11941:16:17:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:at  the  village  level  for  each  observed  rainfall  outcome,  given  the  current  share  of  area  that  is
5:150:12053:17:16:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:irrigated.   We  then  use  the  historical  rainfall  distribution  to  obtain  the  probability  distribution
5:151:12164:16:16:72:540:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of rainfall outcomes, and then calculate the probability distribution of predicted consumption for
5:152:12262:16:17:72:540:331:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:each village.  Consumption risk, finally, is defined as the variability in the distribution of predicted
5:153:12366:17:16:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:consumption.  This concept of risk explores the fact that labor markets in rural India are largely
5:154:12464:16:17:72:540:298:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:dominated by agriculture at the time of the survey.  Hence, rainfall shocks not only affect farmers’
5:155:12564:17:16:72:540:281:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:consumption through on-farm production, they also affect consumption levels of landless households
5:156:12662:16:17:72:332:265:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:who mostly engage in casual agricultural employment.
5:157:12714:17:16:88:539:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We find that consumption risk substantially reduces the probability that girls attend school.
5:158:12807:16:17:72:540:232:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This effect is robust to controlling for average risk in sample villages belonging to the same marriage
5:159:12910:17:16:72:540:215:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:market.  Consistent with our theoretical model, we also find that risk increases the probability that
5:160:13011:16:16:72:540:199:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:girls perform household chores,  and stronger effects for older girls.  Our findings are also robust
5:161:13111:16:17:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to controlling flexibly for household income and wealth, as well as for the share of area irrigated
5:162:13210:17:16:72:540:166:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on a household’s own farm for the sub-sample of farm-households.  We also test if our results are
5:163:13307:16:17:72:540:150:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:driven by a savings motive at the household level, acknowledging that one alternative explanation
5:164:13404:17:16:72:540:133:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:could be that households in more risky environments may wish to save more.  This would lead both
5:165:13500:16:17:72:540:117:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:men and women to work more,  such that the observed effect on girls would really be driven by
5:166:13593:17:16:72:540:100:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:an increase in maternal labor supply, not dynamic complementarity in the education production
5:167:13686:16:0:72:540:84:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:function.  We find no evidence that household savings is higher in risk-prone areas.  Finally, we test
6:168:13789:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:if returns to education or the supply of education vary with risk, again finding no evidence that
6:169:13886:17:16:72:251:692:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:these factors may explain our results.
6:170:13924:16:17:88:539:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In order to assess the scope for public policy, we simulate the effects of an income-smoothing
6:171:14018:17:16:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:policy, modeled after the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) in India, on
6:172:14107:16:17:72:539:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:human capital accumulation.  We argue that the policy makes anex  postlabor supply response
6:173:14198:17:16:71:539:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to  shocks  more  effective  by  mitigating  the  negative  effect  of  shocks  on  wages.   We  estimate  the
6:174:14308:16:17:71:539:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:extent to which NREGS reduces variability in consumption and use this reduction in consumption
6:175:14402:17:16:71:539:593:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:risk to simulate the effect of the program on girls’ probability to attend school.  We find that a
6:176:14500:16:16:71:539:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:similar program, that held the level of wages fixed, would increase school attendance of girls by 2.9
6:177:14601:16:17:71:158:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:percentage points.
6:178:14619:17:16:88:539:544:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The wage effects if such programs should not be ignored, however.  Shah and Steinberg (2015)
6:179:14711:16:17:71:539:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and Li and Sekhri (2013) find negative effects of the NREGS on the time girls spend in school using
6:180:14810:17:16:71:539:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the rolled phase-in of NREGS as a source of variation.  It is argued that the NREGS increased the
6:181:14907:16:17:71:539:495:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:opportunity costs of time of adolescents and therefore led them to drop out of school at younger
6:182:15003:17:16:71:540:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ages.3Arguably a risk mitigation effect could not be fully internalized by households at the early
6:183:15101:16:16:71:539:462:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:stages of the program when implementation was spotty and long-term viability was unclear.  It is
6:184:15197:16:17:71:539:446:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:unclear how the direct effect of rising wages and the indirect effect of less variable incomes balance
6:185:15299:17:16:71:539:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:out in the longer term.  However, our results suggest the negative wage consequences for schooling
6:186:15397:16:17:71:539:413:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the NREGS might be mitigated to the extent that the program is recognized as a reliable source
6:187:15494:17:16:71:282:396:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of support during periods of adverse shocks.
6:188:15538:16:17:88:539:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This paper links two significant strands in the development literature.  The first, focuses on the
6:189:15636:17:16:71:539:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:role of risk as a constraint to productive investment in low-income countries (see e.g. Rosenzweig
6:190:15734:16:16:71:539:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and Binswanger, 1993; Fafchamps and Pender, 1997; Dercon and Christiaensen, 2011; Bianchi and
6:191:15827:16:17:71:539:331:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Bobba, 2013; Karlan et al., 2014).  Consistent with much of this literature we find that risk reduces
6:192:15928:17:16:71:539:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:investment.   The  second  strand  considers  the  determinants  of  human  capital  investment  in  low-
6:193:16033:16:17:71:539:298:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:income countries (see e.g. Foster and Rosenzweig, 1996; Glewwe and Jacoby, 2004; Jensen, 2010,
6:194:16127:17:16:71:539:281:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:2012; Oster and Steinberg, 2013).  As noted previously,  there is other work that focuses on how
6:195:16223:16:17:71:539:265:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:income realizations affect schooling investment in a setting where school investments at different
6:196:16321:17:16:71:539:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:points in time are complementary.  However,  we are not aware of other work that considers the
6:197:16415:16:17:71:251:232:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:question from anex anteperspective.
6:198:16450:17:16:88:539:215:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The  remainder  of  the  paper  proceeds  as  follows.   Section  2  discusses  the  theoretical  model.
6:199:16554:16:16:71:539:199:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Section 3 presents evidence for dynamic complementarity in the production of human capital in
6:200:16647:16:17:71:539:183:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:India.  The data are introduced in Section 4, and the estimation strategy in Section 5.  Results are
6:201:16747:17:16:71:539:166:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:discussed in Section 6.  Section 7 simulates the effect of the NREGS on the outcome of interest,
6:202:16843:16:14:71:188:150:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and Section 8 concludes.
6:203:16867:14:15:84:539:136:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:3This effect seems to work through intra-household substitution in household chores for girls,  and through the
6:204:16978:15:0:72:162:121:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:labor market for boys.
7:205:17001:0:22:72:540:709:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:2    A model of household time allocation, risk and human capital
7:206:17066:22:27:96:173:687:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:investment
7:207:17076:27:17:72:540:660:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Our model helps to illustrate the basic mechanisms of anex anteschooling response to risk that is
7:208:17173:17:16:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:particularly relevant to the circumstances of girls in rural India.  It captures, in particular, three im-
7:209:17279:16:17:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:portant features that may lead to a relationship between consumption risk and child schooling.  The
7:210:17378:17:16:72:540:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:first is dynamic complementarity in the education production function as in Jacoby and Skoufias
7:211:17473:16:17:72:540:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(1997); Cunha and Heckman (2007); Cunha et al. (2010).  As a consequence of this complemen-
7:212:17564:17:16:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tarity households may be reluctant to make initial investments in schooling if they are uncertain
7:213:17661:16:16:72:540:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:about the ability to capture the returns to this investment when schooling may be interrupted as
7:214:17757:16:17:72:539:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a consequence of a negative shock.  The second feature is anex postlabor supply response on the
7:215:17852:17:16:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:part of the mother.  The idea is that a mother will enter the labor market in the face of an adverse
7:216:17952:16:17:72:540:512:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:shock (Kochar, 1999; Rose, 2001; Jayachandran, 2006).  The third feature is a substitution between
7:217:18050:17:16:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the mother’s and her daughter’s time in home production.  The idea here is that the opportunity
7:218:18145:16:17:72:540:479:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cost of time for a daughter must rise during bad periods even though she is unlikely to be active
7:219:18242:17:16:72:304:462:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the labor market (Skoufias, 1993; Ilahi, 2000).
7:220:18292:16:17:88:539:446:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We consider a two period model where utilityuin each of the two periods is defined over market

7:229:18948:16:17:72:540:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is entirely governed byρ, whereσ= 1/(1−ρ) is the elasticity of substitution between school time

8:247:20107:17:16:71:539:464:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the second period.  Note that we do not allow the shock to affect the wage; adding such an effect
8:248:20207:16:16:71:539:448:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:substantially increases the analytic complexity as the price and income effects of wages move in
8:249:20303:16:17:71:539:432:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:opposite directions.  Our empirical results suggest that the income effects dominate, i.e.  mothers
8:250:20402:17:16:71:296:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tend to work more when facing adverse shocks.
8:251:20447:16:17:88:539:399:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We first solve for second period maternal home time by equating the marginal return in the
8:252:20537:17:29:71:252:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:market to the marginal time at home:
8:253:20573:29:30:99:540:353:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f3:ha2= (1−α)Ta−αhc2+ (1−α)(I2+θ2)/w2.(7)
8:254:20611:30:17:71:539:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The result is decreasing in the daughter’s home time, increasing in the shock, and decreasing in the
8:255:20711:17:16:71:539:306:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:wage.  With a more favorable shock or a lower wage, mothers spend less time in the labor market
8:256:20806:16:30:71:418:290:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and more time at home.  Similarly first period maternal time at home is:
8:257:20878:30:30:99:540:260:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f3:ha1= (1−α)Ta−αhc1+ (1−α)I1/w1.(8)
8:258:20911:30:16:88:539:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To develop an intuition for how risk affects first-period school time in the presence of dynamic
8:259:21007:16:16:71:539:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:complementarity, we first consider the extreme of a production function with perfect complements
8:260:21103:16:17:71:539:198:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(ρ→−∞) and wherev(H2) =H2/ζis linear in the stock of human capital.  We will subsequently
8:261:21192:17:16:71:535:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:numerically illustrate the effects for intermediate values ofρand alternative specifications ofv().
8:262:21291:16:17:88:539:165:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:When first and second period school times are perfect complements, second period home time of
8:263:21384:17:16:71:539:148:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the daughter will depend on whether or not school investment in the second period is constrained by
8:264:21483:16:17:71:539:132:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:first period school time. By “constrained” we mean that, due to the complementarity in production,
8:265:21581:17:0:71:539:115:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:if  first  period  schooling  were  exogenously  higher,  thenceteris  paribusthe  household  would  also
9:266:21687:0:30:72:497:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:choose higher second period schooling.  In this sense the household will be constrained if:
9:267:21778:30:30:99:540:679:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f3:θ2> w2(ζ−Ta−hc1)−I2,(9)
9:268:21801:30:30:71:134:649:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in which case
9:269:21814:30:29:99:539:619:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f3:hc2=hc1.(10)
9:270:21826:29:30:72:123:590:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Otherwise,
9:271:21836:30:30:99:539:560:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f3:hc2=ζ−Ta−(I2+θ2)/w2.(11)
9:272:21860:30:16:72:540:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Note that in the former, constrained case, child home time does not depend on the shock but in
9:273:21954:16:17:72:540:514:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the second unconstrained case, child home time is decreasing in the shock.  Under either condition
9:274:22052:17:16:72:297:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:maternal home time is decreasing in the shock.
9:275:22098:16:17:88:540:481:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:By substitutingha2,ha1andhc1intoLand taking expectations over the assumed distribution of
9:276:22187:17:16:72:540:464:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:shocks, we can then write the maximand as a function of child home time in the first period only.
9:277:22284:16:16:72:540:448:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This expression is straightforward in the case that the variance of the shock is small enough that
9:278:22382:16:17:72:540:432:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the household’s second period school time is always constrained by the first period time – that is as
9:279:22483:17:16:72:540:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:long as things cannot be not so bad in the second period that the household chooses to provide less
9:280:22582:16:17:72:540:399:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:schooling than was chosen in the first period.  In particular, assuming we have an interior solution
9:281:22682:17:16:72:539:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:we can differentiate with respect tohc1.  While the resulting expression cannot be solved in closed
9:282:22781:16:33:72:487:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:form, we can write a series approximation in the size of the shock for small values ofr:

9:294:22979:17:16:88:540:284:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Taking values for the parameters:Ta=Tc= 4,α=δ= 1/2,ζ= 4,I= 6, andw= 1, this
9:295:23054:16:30:71:166:268:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:expression becomes:

9:297:23098:29:17:72:540:209:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The condition for second period schooling to be constrained by the first period schooling isr≤12;
9:298:23195:17:16:72:540:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:however, this implies home-time of 6, which exceeds the time allocation for the child.  Thus for an
9:299:23294:16:17:72:540:176:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:interior solution and these parameter values, we always have the constrained case and second period
9:300:23393:17:16:72:539:159:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:schooling is equal to first period schooling.  The exact numerical value forhc1is 2 (corresponding to
9:301:23494:16:17:72:437:143:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:schooling of 2) when there is no variance, and 3 (schooling of 1) whenr= 6.
9:302:23569:17:16:88:539:126:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This result shows clearly that – in the constrained case – first period home time is increasing in
9:303:23667:16:17:72:540:110:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the variance of the shock and thus conversely first period schooling is decreasing in the variance of
9:304:23768:17:16:72:540:93:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the shock.  This result also implies that second period school time and thus the eventual stock of
9:305:23866:16:0:72:540:77:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:schooling is decreasing in the variance of the shock.  The intuition is simple.  If risk increases, then
10:306:23971:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the marginal cost of second-period school time – in terms of foregone consumption of the home
10:307:24064:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:produced good – increases more in the event of a bad shock than it decreases in the event of a
10:308:24158:16:17:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:good shock.  Because, in the constrained case, second-period schooling is set equal to first period
10:309:24257:17:16:72:349:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:schooling, an increase in risk lowers first period schooling.
10:310:24318:16:17:88:539:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Note that this is the opposite of a precautionary savings motive.  In a typical precautionary
10:311:24411:17:16:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:savings model, period one investment is a substitute for income in the second period, and thus one
10:312:24509:16:17:72:540:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:avoids the downside risk by reducing consumption in the first period.  Here in effect first period
10:313:24607:17:16:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:investment is a complement with second period investment, so the opposite occurs when faced with
10:314:24703:16:16:72:129:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:greater risk.
10:315:24716:16:17:88:539:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:If  the  variance  is  so  high  that  condition  (9)  is  not  met  in  the  bad  state  of  the  world,  then
10:316:24827:17:16:72:540:544:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:variance  can  have  the  opposite  effect  on  first  period  time  allocation.   In  particular,  in  the  good
10:317:24940:16:17:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:state of the world one obtains (10) and in the bad state of the world one obtains (11).  Thus the
10:318:25037:17:16:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:second  period  downside  risk  is  mitigated  because  it  is  no  longer  tied  to  the  first-period  level  of
10:319:25151:16:17:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:schooling.  On the other hand, the upside risk can fully be realized by setting first period equal to
10:320:25252:17:16:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:second period schooling.  In particular, the series approximation to first-period home time in the
10:321:25350:16:31:72:176:462:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:unconstrained case is:

10:337:25632:16:17:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:borrowing in the case of investment risk:  increasing risk can increase the willingness to take a loan
10:338:25734:17:16:72:540:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:at a given interest rate because it raises the return in the good state and does not decrease it in

10:340:25875:16:17:88:539:316:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:More  generally,  the  effect  of  variance  on  first-period  investment  depends  on  whether  human
10:341:25977:17:16:72:540:299:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:capital demand exhibits dynamic complementarity, that is whether increases in first period school-
10:342:26075:16:17:72:540:283:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ing lead to an increase in the marginal utility of second period schooling.  This depends, in turn,
10:343:26174:17:16:72:540:266:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:both on the elasticity of substitution of the human capital production function and on the extent

10:347:26408:0:15:152:157:209:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1

10:350:26424:32:34:72:532:170:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:withφ >= 0.  By substituting (2) into (15) and differentiating with respect tos1ands2we find:
10:351:26517:34:0:99:124:136:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f3:sign(

10:355:26554:31:16:72:539:105:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Thus forφ= 0, i.e.  linear utility with respect to child human capital, there will always be dynamic
10:356:26654:16:17:72:540:89:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:complementarity in demand, except the extreme case where the human capital production function
10:357:26748:17:0:72:539:72:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:exhibits perfect substitutability (ρ= 1).  On the other hand forφ= 1,  logarithmic utility,  time
11:358:26846:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in school at different points will be dynamic complements if and only if the production function
11:359:26942:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:exhibits complementarity (ρ <0).  Finally, ifφ= 2 then school investments at different points in
11:360:27038:16:17:72:284:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:time will be dynamic substitutes forρ >−1.
11:361:27080:17:16:88:539:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Although we are unable to derive analytic solutions for the effects of risk on first-period schooling
11:362:27181:16:17:71:539:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in  the  general  CES  case,  numerical  solutions  suggest  that  the  sign  of  the  effect  of  variance  on
11:363:27292:17:16:71:539:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:first-period human capital investment maps 1:1 with the presence of dynamic complementarity in
11:364:27386:16:17:71:293:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:demand for human capital as described above.
11:365:27430:17:16:88:539:593:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 1 plots the derivative of first period schooling with respect to the magnitude of the shock
11:366:27528:16:16:71:539:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:against the log of the elasticity of substitutionσ= 1/(1−ρ).5It shows outcomes for three functional
11:367:27627:16:17:71:539:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:forms, linear utility in human capital, and two alternative functions that allow for risk-aversion in
11:368:27728:17:16:71:539:544:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:human  capital:v(H2)  =ln(H2)  andv(H2)  =−1/H2.   Since  we  are  plotting  against  ln(σ),  the
11:369:27825:16:17:71:540:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:y-axis  captures  the  Cobb-Douglas  case.   Asln(σ)→1.5,  the  production  function  approaches  a
11:370:27924:17:16:71:539:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:simple additive function in school times, i.e.  the case of perfect substitutes.  And asln(σ)→−1.5,
11:371:28023:16:17:71:478:495:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the human capital production function exhibits increasing dynamic complementarity.
11:372:28105:17:16:88:539:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:As  can  be  seen,  the  predicted effect  of  risk  is strictly  negative  as  long  as the  human  capital
11:373:28213:16:16:71:539:462:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:production function exhibits strong complementarity.  For more moderate values ofρ, the picture
11:374:28308:16:17:71:539:446:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is somewhat more complex.  With linearvthe predicted effect of risk remains negative throughout,
11:375:28404:17:16:71:539:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and approaches zero only as the human capital production function exhibits perfect substitutability
11:376:28503:16:17:71:539:413:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(ρ= 1).  With concavev, this is no longer the case.  Second period risk will then affect the expected
11:377:28604:17:16:71:539:396:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:marginal utility of the human capital stock, and households will rather invest more in schooling in
11:378:28703:16:17:71:539:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:order to avoid very low stocks of human capital for their children.  Ifv(H2) =ln(H2), for example,
11:379:28801:17:16:71:540:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:first period schooling will increase in risk for allρ >0.  Ifv(H2) =−1/H2, the predicted effect of
11:380:28899:16:16:72:325:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:risk becomes positive already at negative values ofρ.
11:381:28952:16:17:88:539:331:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Whether variance increases or decreases first-period investment thus depends on the presence
11:382:29044:17:16:71:539:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of  dynamic  complementarity  in  the  demand  for  human  capital,  which  depends  in  turn,  at  least
11:383:29149:16:17:71:539:298:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in part, on parental preferences for child human capital.  While we can (and do, below) directly
11:384:29245:17:16:71:539:281:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimate a production function, the shape of human capital preferences is unclear.  If we think about
11:385:29346:16:17:71:539:265:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:equation (1) as overlapping-generations problem, we would expect parents to exhibit diminishing
11:386:29441:17:16:71:539:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:marginal utility with respect to the future consumption of their child,  such as in Becker (1991).
11:387:29539:16:17:71:539:232:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:But we are not maximizing household utility over the daughter’s future consumption, but her final
11:388:29636:17:16:71:539:215:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:stock of human capital.  How the stock of human capital then translates into future earnings and
11:389:29732:16:16:71:539:199:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:consumption  is  essentially  an  empirical  question.   While  returns  to  schooling  seem  to  be  rather
11:390:29840:16:17:71:539:183:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:linear  in  reality  (Banerjee  and  Duflo,  2005),  increasing  evidence  suggests  that  households  have
11:391:29947:17:16:71:539:166:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:inconsistent expectations regarding the exact relationship between years of schooling and future
11:392:30043:16:17:71:539:150:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:income.  Many households seem to expect that marginal returns to schooling increase with years
11:393:30137:17:16:71:539:133:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of schooling (Banerjee and Duflo, 2011; Barrera-Osorio et al., 2011; Akresh et al., 2012).  A linear
11:394:30237:16:16:71:539:117:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:utility in human capital might thus be a reasonable approximation of household decision making
11:395:30331:16:15:84:540:101:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:5Similarly to above we choose the parameter values ofTa=Tc= 4,α=δ= 1/2,I= 6,ζ= 4,  andw= 1.
11:396:30422:15:0:72:306:86:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:Furthermore we setr= 6 and the skill multiplierν= 1/2.
12:397:30477:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:if we combine the expectations of increasing returns to human capital with decreasing marginal
12:398:30571:17:38:72:266:692:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:utility of the child’s future consumption.

12:400:30680:27:17:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:One important component of the predicted effect of risk is the degree of complementarity between
12:401:30776:17:16:72:539:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:each period’s school times.  An exact estimate ofρwould allow us to make more sensible predictions
12:402:30874:16:17:71:256:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:about the effect risk on time in school.
12:403:30914:17:16:88:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In order to estimateρ, we need measures of skills and investment.  Given that the data used in
12:404:31008:16:16:71:539:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:this paper does not contain information about skills, we have to draw on a different data set from
12:405:31106:16:17:71:539:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:India, the Young Lives Survey.  The Young Lives project focuses on child development and follows
12:406:31202:17:16:71:539:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:children from two different cohorts in four different countries since 2002.  For this study, we use the
12:407:31305:16:17:71:259:512:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:India data from rounds two and three.6
12:408:31343:17:16:88:539:495:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We follow Cunha and Heckman (2007), in specifying a constant elasticity of substitution pro-
12:409:31435:16:17:71:539:479:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:duction function, in which the stock of human capital, more precisely of cognitive skills, increases

12:418:31947:17:16:88:539:337:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Skills are likely measured with error.  Therefore, we follow Cunha et al. (2010) in their approach
12:419:32045:16:17:72:540:321:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of estimating a skills production function by first estimating a set of latent factors (H1,H2and
12:420:32141:17:16:72:540:304:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f3:Hp) from multiple measurements of skills (Zj).  This allows to identify the structural parameters of
12:421:32241:16:17:72:540:288:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:eq.  (17) even if skills are measured with error.  To keep the problem simple, we specify linear factor
12:422:32344:17:16:72:539:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:models,  and  as  in  Cunha  et  al.  (2010)  we  assume  that  the  measurementsZjproxy  the  natural
12:423:32446:16:30:72:277:255:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:logarithms of the factors, such that forH1:

12:425:32513:30:16:88:539:195:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We also allow for endogeneity of investment and skills in (17) by instrumenting both variables

12:427:32710:16:17:72:540:163:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:draws children out of school, but this pressure falls with wealth, here captured by land ownership.
12:428:32809:17:16:72:540:146:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The identifying assumption is that conditional on parental skills,  neither land ownership nor its
12:429:32907:16:16:72:540:130:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:interaction with rainfall has a direct effect on skills or investment.  Assuming that the identifying

13:431:33088:0:30:72:442:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:assumption is valid, eq.  (17) can be identified in a control function approach,

13:434:33313:16:17:72:540:633:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Results can be found in Table 1.  Columns (1) - (3) report results for the younger cohort, aged 5
13:435:33410:17:16:72:540:616:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in round 2 (2007) and aged 8 in round 3 (2009-10).  Columns (4)-(6) report results for the older
13:436:33506:16:17:72:539:600:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cohort, aged 12 in 2007 and 15 in 2009-10.7As can be seen the results are fairly similar for both
13:437:33603:17:16:72:540:583:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cohorts and irrespectively of whether we allow investments, or investments and initial skills to be
13:438:33702:16:17:72:539:567:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:endogenous.  The self-productivity parameterν1is 0.26 in the younger cohort and 0.64 is the older
13:439:33799:17:16:72:540:550:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cohort.   The  elasticity  of  substitutionσis  close  to  one  for  both  cohorts:  it  varies  between  0.91
13:440:33909:16:16:72:540:534:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and 1.06 for the younger cohort and between 0.92 and 1.16 for the older cohort.  The results thus
13:441:34006:16:17:72:540:518:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:suggest that the human capital production function can best be approximated by a Cobb-Douglas
13:442:34099:17:16:72:478:501:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:production function, while we can strongly reject perfect substitutability in all cases.
13:443:34187:16:17:88:539:485:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:These results are well in line with Cunha et al. (2010) who use data from the US, as well as
13:444:34279:17:16:72:540:468:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with Attanasio et al. (2015), who also use the Young Lives Survey data from India.  While we focus
13:445:34377:16:17:72:540:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on children’s study time per day as key investment variable, Attanasio et al. (2015) use spending
13:446:34474:17:16:72:540:435:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on school as well as the number of meals per day to proxy investment.  Not surprisingly, the results

13:453:34997:16:17:72:540:288:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:were collected in 1982, 1999, and 2006 to re-visit these households.  The sample was increased over
13:454:35096:17:16:72:540:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:time  by  randomly  sampling  additional  households  from  the  same  villages.   The  sample  in  2006
13:455:35200:16:16:72:540:255:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:consists of roughly 9,500 households in 242 villages.9We can only use the 2006 round because of
13:456:35295:16:17:72:259:239:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:changes in the questionnaire over time.
13:457:35334:17:16:88:539:222:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:There are three reasons for using the REDS data to study the questions outlined above.  First,
13:458:35428:16:17:72:540:206:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the  geographic  coverage  of  almost  the  entire  country  allows  a  comparison  of  households  in  very
13:459:35536:17:16:72:540:189:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:different agro-climatic regions and economic conditions.  Second,  the REDS 2006 survey collects
13:460:35632:16:17:72:540:173:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:detailed information about time allocated to different activities for all household members.  This
13:461:35730:17:16:72:540:156:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:information is collected for three seasons of the year (each of which lasts for four months), which are
13:462:35833:16:15:84:539:140:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:7The estimation is restricted to children who are still in school in the follow-up round.  Summary statistics are
13:463:35946:15:7:72:231:125:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:reported in Table C.1 in the Appendix.
13:464:35984:7:15:84:539:118:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:8Attanasio et al. (2015) find a elasticity of substitution of 0.871 for the younger cohort and of 0.952 for the older
13:465:36101:15:11:72:540:103:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:cohort, and self-productivity parameters around 0.283 and 0.605 for the younger and the older cohorts, respectively.
13:466:36217:11:7:72:540:92:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:In Cunha et al. (2010), the estimated elasticity of substitution varies between 0.421 and 0.547 in the age group 5-14.
13:467:36335:7:0:84:539:85:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:9Due to armed conflict no data were collected in Jammu & Kashmir and in Assam in the 2006 round of interviews.
14:468:36447:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:also marked by very different levels of agricultural activity. Seasons 1 and 2 are the agricultural peak
14:469:36551:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:seasons in which most of the agricultural production takes place.  Season 3 is the dry season, during
14:470:36652:16:17:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:which only very few crops are cultivated and agricultural activity is considerably lower.  We restrict
14:471:36754:17:16:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the sample to households and individuals with complete information on time  allocation,  income
14:472:36849:16:17:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and consumption, and who live in rural areas.10In order to use the available information efficiently,
14:473:36950:17:16:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:we first generate a sample of mothers with children aged 6 to 16.  This sample consists of 4,356
14:474:37046:16:17:72:539:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:households and 4,651 mothers.11Table 2 reports some general household summary statistics for this
14:475:37143:17:16:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sample.  We then restrict the sample to matched daughter-mother information, for all girls aged 6 to
14:476:37243:16:16:72:539:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:16, who still live with their mothers.12This final sample consists of 2,934 households, 3,040 mothers
14:477:37344:16:17:72:540:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and 4,306 daughters.13The unit of observation in the main estimation is the daughter-mother match
14:478:37441:17:16:72:540:544:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:across three agricultural seasons, resulting in a final sample size of 12,918 observations.  Detailed
14:479:37542:16:32:72:491:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:summary statistics for mothers and daughters are reported in the Appendix, Table C.2.
14:480:37627:32:24:72:212:496:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:4.1    Risk in rural India
14:481:37653:24:16:72:540:472:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In rural India, agriculture is the dominant source of income for the majority of households, either
14:482:37752:16:17:72:540:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:through own agricultural production or through casual agricultural employment.  Agriculture em-
14:483:37847:17:16:72:540:439:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ploys 67% of all male workers and 83% of all female workers in 2004/05 (National Sample Survey
14:484:37941:16:17:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Office, 2006).  In the REDS sample, 63% of households cultivate their own land, and labor income
14:485:38037:17:16:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:consists to 59% of income from casual employment in agriculture or own agricultural production
14:486:38131:16:17:72:540:390:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(c.f. Table 2). In addition, employment in agriculture (own agricultural production and agricultural
14:487:38231:17:16:72:409:373:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:casual labor) makes up for 79% of the labor market time of mothers.14
14:488:38300:16:16:88:539:357:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Agricultural income is inherently risky.  As previous literature has shown, wages and employ-
14:489:38393:16:17:72:540:341:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ment levels in the agricultural sector are strongly influenced by rainfall conditions (see e.g. Jay-
14:490:38493:17:16:72:540:324:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:achandran, 2006; Kaur, 2014).  High rainfall leads to good harvests,  high demand for labor and
14:491:38588:16:17:72:540:308:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:high wages.  In contrast, low rainfall levels lead to poor harvests and low demand for agricultural
14:492:38687:17:16:72:540:291:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:labor.  The variability of rainfall combined with the village-level availability of irrigation systems
14:493:38789:16:17:72:405:275:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:should therefore be good proxies for consumption risk in this context.
14:494:38859:17:16:88:539:258:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:In order to predict consumption risk, we merge the REDS data with historical rainfall data.15
14:495:38952:16:16:72:540:242:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We then compute consumption risk as follows.  First, we estimate in the cross-section how strongly
14:496:39050:16:17:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:current rainfall levels determine a household’s consumption per capita (in logs) given a village’s
14:497:39148:17:11:80:507:209:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:10We drop all households living in cities with more than 10,000 inhabitants, based on the Census in 2001.
14:498:39253:11:11:80:373:198:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:11We use this sample to calculate our risk variable and to predict wages.
14:499:39326:11:11:80:422:187:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:12We focus on the age group 6 to 16 because most girls still live at home at this age.
14:500:39412:11:15:80:539:176:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:13The final sample is considerably smaller than the original sample.  By far most households had to be dropped
14:501:39522:15:11:72:540:161:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:because they have no children in the relevant age group (≈2,500), or only boys (≈1,500).  Another 1,000 households
14:502:39636:11:11:71:539:150:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:had to be dropped because they live in cities with more than 10,000 inhabitants, and for roughly 1,000 households it
14:503:39752:11:7:71:351:139:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:was not possible to match mothers and daughters by their identifiers.
14:504:39821:7:11:80:260:132:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:14As reported in Table C.2 in the Appendix.
14:505:39864:11:14:80:539:121:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:15We use precipitation data compiled by the University of Delaware for the period 1960 to 2010.  Data are available
14:506:39979:14:11:71:539:107:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:for 1900 onwards, but the data quality improved a lot over the time period, which is why we prefer working only with
14:507:40095:11:11:71:539:96:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:more recent data.  We merge the data with the geocode of the village center.  Since the data are available for grids of
14:508:40214:11:0:71:483:85:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:0.5 degrees in latitude and longitude (approximately 50 km), some of the villages fall in the same cell.
15:509:40320:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:share of area that is irrigated.16Results are reported in Table 3.  Rainfall is interacted with the
15:510:40419:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:share of agricultural land under irrigation in the village, to capture differential risk exposure.  The
15:511:40522:16:17:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:assumption here is that rainfall shocks will translate less strongly into consumption outcomes the
15:512:40620:17:16:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:higher the share of irrigated land in a village is.  This can be because households are more likely to
15:513:40722:16:17:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:have irrigation on their own land in villages with a high share of area under irrigation or because
15:514:40821:17:16:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:casual agricultural employment will be less affected by current rainfall levels (since most farmers in
15:515:40923:16:17:72:540:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the village do not depend on current rainfall levels for their agricultural output).  We also control
15:516:41024:17:16:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for irrigation levels,  and average annual rainfall separately.  State fixed effects and a linear time
15:517:41126:16:16:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:trend are also included.  To gauge the robustness of these estimates, we add a number of controls
15:518:41223:16:17:72:540:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that could proxy for permanent income such as education,  caste,  religion and land ownership in
15:519:41319:17:16:72:534:544:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:column (2).  As can be seen in Table 3, our results are robust to the inclusion of these controls.17
15:520:41419:16:17:88:539:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Given these estimates, we then simulate the amount of risk faced by every household in a village
15:521:41515:17:16:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:using the historical rainfall distribution and the current share of area that is irrigated in each village.
15:522:41622:16:17:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We use historical rainfall data to calculate the probability of each rainfall outcome.  We then predict
15:523:41725:17:16:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a household’s log consumption per capita for each rainfall outcome given the current availability of
15:524:41825:16:16:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:irrigation in a village.  By multiplying the probability of each rainfall outcome with the predicted
15:525:41925:16:17:72:540:446:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:log consumption at that rainfall level, we obtain a probability distribution of consumption outcomes
15:526:42025:17:16:72:539:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for each household in a particular village.18Finally,  we calculate the interquartile range as well
15:527:42124:16:17:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as the standard deviation of a household’s predicted log consumption per capita as measures of
15:528:42218:17:32:72:157:396:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:consumption risk.

15:530:42283:23:17:72:540:341:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Achieving universal education has been the declared goal of Indian governments since independence.

15:532:42474:16:17:72:540:308:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of children aged 6 to 14.  Since then, substantial improvements have been made in the enrollment
15:533:42570:17:16:72:540:291:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rates of boys and girls and in closing the gender gap in primary school enrollment.  By 2010/11
15:534:42665:16:17:72:540:275:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the gross enrollment ratio reached 114.9% for boys and 116.3% for girls in the classes 1 to 5.  The
15:535:42764:17:16:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:gender gap has also been closing in middle school enrollment:  by 2010/11, 87.5% of the boys were
15:536:42861:16:16:72:495:242:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:enrolled in the classes 6 to 10, as compared to 82.9% of the girls (also in gross figures).19
15:537:42954:16:17:88:539:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Still,  literacy rates remain low,  particularly for women and in rural areas.  According to the
15:538:43050:17:16:71:539:209:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Census in 2011, only 50.6% of the women aged 15 and above living in rural India are literate.  This
15:539:43149:16:16:71:539:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is  not  only  an  issue  among  the  adult  population:  according  to  the  Annual  Status  of  Education
15:540:43256:16:11:80:341:177:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:16This approach is inspired by Dercon and Christiaensen (2011).
15:541:43319:11:15:80:539:166:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:17Still we have to worry that these results are driven by differences in average consumption across villages that
15:542:43432:15:11:72:540:151:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:correlate  with  average  rainfall  levels  rather  than  current  shocks.   We  therefore  employ  two  additional  robustness
15:543:43559:11:11:72:540:140:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:checks.  First, we test if using the deviation in rainfall from the long-term average instead of current precipitation
15:544:43677:11:11:72:540:129:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:changes the results.  Second, we pool the 2006 data with the 2014 follow-up round and test if our results are sensitive
15:545:43796:11:11:72:540:118:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:to the inclusion of village fixed effects.  In both approaches,  the results are qualitatively similar to those reported
15:546:43916:11:7:72:292:107:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:here, and are available from the authors upon request.
15:547:43970:7:15:80:539:100:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:18The probability weights are obtained by dividing the sample rainfall distribution in 0.025 intervals of annual log
15:548:44086:15:7:72:506:85:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:rainfall.  We then calculate the historical probability of village-level rainfall to fall in each of these intervals.

16:557:44921:17:16:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for girls in urban areas and 6.7% for boys in rural areas.  This inequality increases further if we
16:558:45020:16:16:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:consider the age group 15 to 19: in this group, 44.8% of the rural girls are out of school as compared
16:559:45122:16:17:72:540:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to 29.7% of the urban girls and to 34.3% of the rural boys.  In the same survey, more than half
16:560:45217:17:16:72:540:544:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the girls aged 5 to 29 years who were currently not in school but ever attended an educational
16:561:45314:16:17:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:institution stated that attending domestic chores was the single reason for not being enrolled in
16:562:45411:17:16:72:390:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:any educational institution (National Sample Survey Office, 2015).
16:563:45477:16:17:88:539:495:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In the REDS sample, 79% of the girls aged 6 to 16 are currently enrolled in school, as compared
16:564:45572:17:32:72:281:478:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:to 86% of the boys in the same age group.21

16:566:45677:23:17:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The REDS collects two different types of time allocation data.  The demographic section records the
16:567:45776:17:16:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:number of hours per day allocated to different activities on a typical day for all household members
16:568:45876:16:17:72:540:390:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in each of three agricultural seasons.  This section explicitly differentiates between time in school,
16:569:45978:17:16:72:540:373:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:time allocated to household chores, market work and leisure.  Consistent with the ILO definition, we
16:570:46078:16:16:72:540:357:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:define labor supply as the total number of hours per season worked in paid employment or in self-
16:571:46175:16:17:72:540:341:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:employment.  However, we exclude hours worked in own-agricultural production from this variable.
16:572:46271:17:16:72:540:324:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The reason for this is that labor supply to own-agricultural production will be affected by rainfall
16:573:46371:16:17:72:539:308:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:risk in different ways and we want to avoid mixing up different causal mechanisms.22Household
16:574:46464:17:16:72:540:291:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:chores, then, include all activities related to the household:  construction and maintenance of the
16:575:46563:16:17:72:540:275:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:house, farm and other assets, household work and other household-related activities (collecting fuel,
16:576:46664:17:16:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:herding cattle,  fishing,  cutting grass).  We also count the time allocated to livestock production
16:577:46764:16:16:72:540:242:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as home production, arguing that livestock production is mostly a household duty, even though it
16:578:46860:16:17:72:241:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:could also be undertaken for profit.
16:579:46896:17:16:88:539:209:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:As reported in Table 4,  girls in our sample spend on average 6.2 hours per day in school or
16:580:46988:16:17:72:540:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:studying in season 1 (one of the two agricultural peak seasons).  Girls also spend 1.6 hours per day
16:581:47088:17:16:72:540:176:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on household chores, but only 0.1 hours per day working on the labor market.  This exemplifies why
16:582:47186:16:14:80:539:160:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:20ASER is based on an annual survey that assesses children’s schooling status and basic learning levels throughout
16:583:47300:14:11:72:540:146:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:all rural districts of India.  It is facilitated by the Indian NGO Pratham and interviews are conducted by volunteers,
16:584:47418:11:11:72:540:135:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:which has raised a number of doubts regarding data quality.  Still, it is the only India-wide assessment of learning
16:585:47534:11:8:72:173:124:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:levels currently available.
16:586:47561:8:10:80:467:116:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:21Summary statistics are reported in the Appendix:  Table C.2 for girls, and Table C.3 for boys.
16:587:47657:10:15:80:539:106:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:22Labor  supply  to  own-agricultural  production  should  fall  with  increasing  rainfall  risk,  as  this  income  source
16:588:47781:15:11:72:540:91:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:becomes increasingly risky.  Labor has to be allocated to agricultural production partly before the rainfall realizes,
16:589:47899:11:0:72:489:80:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:hence before the household can assess how the harvest, and therefore the returns to that labor, will be.
17:590:48005:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:we need to take into account intra-household substitution effects when thinking about the effect of
17:591:48104:17:16:72:251:692:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:shocks on the time allocation of girls.
17:592:48143:16:17:88:539:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:For all household members aged 10 to 65, the questionnaire also collects information about the
17:593:48237:17:16:72:539:659:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:actual number of days and hours per day allocated to a number of different activities per season.23
17:594:48336:16:17:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We use this section to compute time allocation variables for mothers.  The labor force participation
17:595:48436:17:16:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in our sample of mothers is 21% in the agricultural peak seasons and 15% in the lean season (c.f.
17:596:48533:16:17:72:540:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Table 4).24In all seasons, labor supply is on average slightly higher than time allocated to own-
17:597:48630:17:16:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:agricultural production.  By far the majority of maternal time is spent on household chores:  701
17:598:48727:16:16:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:hours  in  season  1,  which  corresponds  to  roughly  43.8  hours  per  week.   Hours  allocated  to  labor
17:599:48836:16:17:72:540:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:supply and own-agricultural production together make up for about 9.4 hours per week on average
17:600:48931:17:16:72:540:544:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in season 1.  Total time spent on activities other than leisure is thus 53.2 hours per week in season
17:601:49032:16:17:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1,  which  is  very  close  to  the  time  spent  on  those  activities  reported  in  the  Time  Use  Survey  of
17:602:49145:17:16:72:152:511:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:1998/99 (53.4).25
17:603:49162:16:17:88:539:495:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Because this section does not collect time in school or studying, we cannot use this information
17:604:49258:17:16:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to  test  for  the  effects  of  risk  on  time  in  school.   However  having  information  on  time  allocated
17:605:49370:16:16:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to  household  chores  from  two  different  sections,  allows  to  test  if  our  results  are  robust  to  using
17:606:49484:16:17:72:540:446:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:alternative  time  measures.   With  respect  to  time  spent  on  household  chores  by  girls,  we  find
17:607:49590:17:16:72:540:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:correlation coefficients of 0.83, 0.81 and 0.81 between the two time measures for seasons 1, 2 and
17:608:49688:16:38:72:150:413:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:3, respectively.26

17:610:49730:28:29:72:306:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The structural hours function to be estimated is:

17:612:49825:30:17:72:540:288:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:where the dependent variable is the amount of time childi, living in villagej, allocates to schooling
17:613:49926:17:16:72:540:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(or to home production) at timet.  We are particularly interested in estimatingβ1, i.e.  the effect
17:614:50025:16:16:72:539:255:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of  consumption  riskRjton  hours  allocated  to  different  activities.   As  discussed  previously,  this
17:615:50132:16:17:72:540:239:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:variable is predicted at the village level.  The identifying assumption is that,  conditional on the
17:616:50232:17:16:72:540:222:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:control variables, no other (unobserved) characteristics that determine hours in school are correlated
17:617:50334:16:16:72:540:206:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with our regressor of interest, i.e.  consumption risk.  This assumption is quite strong and we will
17:618:50434:16:15:80:539:190:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:23The full list of activities are salaried work,  agricultural casual labor,  own-crop production,  own-livestock pro-
17:619:50552:15:11:72:540:175:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:duction, work for public works programs, non-agricultural casual labor, migration, self-employment in non-farming,
17:620:50666:11:11:72:540:164:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:construction and maintenance of house,  farm and other assets,  household work,  other household-related activities
17:621:50781:11:7:72:512:153:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:(collecting fuel, herding cattle, fishing, cutting grass) and other activities (schooling, unemployment, leisure).
17:622:50895:7:15:80:539:146:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:24This is slightly lower than the 24.5% reported for rural India by the NSSO in 2009/10.  But the NSSO classifies
17:623:51008:15:7:72:320:131:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:own-agricultural production as labor supply, while we do not.
17:624:51069:7:15:80:539:124:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:25There is a substantial time lag between the two surveys,  however.  Also our sample consists only of mothers,
17:625:51180:15:7:72:254:109:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:while the TUS surveys women aged 15 to 65.
17:626:51222:7:15:80:539:102:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:26We  also  find  qualitatively  similar  results  when  using  actual  hours  worked  in  the  household  rather  than  usual
17:627:51348:15:11:72:540:87:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:hours per day as dependent variable when estimating the effect of risk.  Results are reported in the Appendix, Table
17:628:51464:11:0:72:88:76:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:C.4.
18:629:51470:0:17:72:493:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:discuss how we address some possible threats to identification at the end of this section.
18:630:51560:17:16:88:539:692:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In the absence of a labor market for girls and given intra-household substitution effects, maternal
18:631:51659:16:17:72:539:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:wagewijtshould be a good proxy for the opportunity cost of time of girls and needs to be included
18:632:51756:17:16:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the structural hours equation.  Furthermore, we expect time allocation to depend on non-labor
18:633:51852:16:17:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:income and all other household members’ labor incomeNijt(which excludes maternal labor income).
18:634:51947:17:16:71:539:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:These  two  variables  are  expected  to  capture  income  effects  on  time  in  school.   We  assume  that
18:635:52055:16:17:71:540:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:preferences for school can be captured by individual and household characteristicsXijt, i.e.  age,
18:636:52153:17:16:71:539:593:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:caste, religion, the number of children (in the household), household size, and land ownership, as
18:637:52251:16:16:71:539:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:measure of general household wealth.  Finally, the error term can be decomposed into a permanent
18:638:52347:16:17:71:539:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and two transitory components such that-ijt=μj+σjt+ηit, whereμjis a state-level fixed effect,
18:639:52440:17:16:71:498:544:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f3:σjtare village-level shocks andηitis a mean zero, strictly exogenous, idiosyncratic shock.
18:640:52530:16:17:88:539:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:As discussed above, the dependent variable will depend on maternal wages, if there is substitu-
18:641:52625:17:16:71:539:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tion between mother’s time and daughter’s time at home.  But adequately controlling for maternal
18:642:52721:16:17:71:539:495:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:wages is challenging for a number of reasons.  First, observed wages are potentially endogenous to
18:643:52819:17:16:71:539:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:labor supply if wages reflect work effort as well as skills or ability, such that individuals who work
18:644:52921:16:16:71:539:462:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:longer hours are likely to get higher wages.  This is of concern particularly in the labor markets
18:645:53019:16:17:71:539:446:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of developed economies (see e.g. Keane, 2011).  In the context of low-skill agricultural wage work,
18:646:53118:17:16:71:539:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:however, we feel that this is less of an issue, because wage rates are determined by local conditions
18:647:53219:16:17:71:539:413:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rather than individual abilities (Rosenzweig, 1978; Rose, 2001; Jayachandran, 2006).  Second, both
18:648:53317:17:16:71:539:396:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:wages and other household members’ labor income are endogenous to shocks.  There might be gen-
18:649:53411:16:17:71:539:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:eral equilibrium effects of shocks on wages (see e.g. Jayachandran, 2006):  if all households in the
18:650:53511:17:16:71:539:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:village supply more labor due to a shock, equilibrium wages should be lower than in the absence of
18:651:53609:16:16:71:539:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a shock.  We need to be aware of this when testing for effects of rainfall shocks on labor supply:  our
18:652:53712:16:17:71:539:331:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:predicted wages already account for general equilibrium effects of shocks on wages in the village
18:653:53809:17:16:71:539:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:economy,  and this might mask some of the effect of shocks on time allocation decisions.  Third,
18:654:53905:16:17:71:539:298:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:wages are only observed for women who are currently in the labor market, such that we have to
18:655:53998:17:16:71:539:281:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:deal with missing wages for all women who are not participating in the labor market.  Potentially,
18:656:54096:16:17:71:539:265:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the  sample  of  workers  is  not  a  random  sub-sample  of  all  women,  such  that  we  have  to  account
18:657:54204:17:16:71:539:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for selection bias when imputing wages.  Fourth, most women in our sample reported working in
18:658:54297:16:17:71:539:232:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:different activities, at different wages.  Fifth, we have to deal with classical measurement error since
18:659:54401:17:16:71:456:215:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:wages are mostly measured with considerable error in micro data (Keane, 2011).
18:660:54479:16:16:88:539:199:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We address the last three issues by predicting wages for all women in our sample.  Following
18:661:54571:16:17:71:539:183:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Blundell et al. (2007), we predict wages using a Heckman selection correction.  Since women report
18:662:54669:17:16:71:539:166:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:working in a number of different activities at different wage levels, we calculate weighted average
18:663:54768:16:0:71:539:150:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:wages,  i.e.  calculate total income from all activities and divide it by the total number of hours
19:664:54869:0:30:72:318:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:worked.27Assume wages are determined as follows:
19:665:54917:30:30:99:539:679:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:lnwijt=δ0+δ1Xijt+δ2Rjt+μj+σjt+υit.(21)
19:666:54955:30:16:72:539:649:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In eq.  (21),Xijtcaptures age, age squared, caste, number of children in the household, religion,
19:667:55052:16:17:72:540:633:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:education,  land  ownership,  and  non-labor  income.Rjt,μjandσjtagain  capture  consumption
19:668:55144:17:16:71:539:616:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:risk, state fixed effects, and village-level rainfall shocks respectively.  The structural participation
19:669:55248:16:17:71:539:600:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:equation is similar to the wage equation, except that we add wages lnwijt, other household members’
19:670:55347:17:29:71:336:583:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:labor incomeNijt, and augmentXijtby marital status:
19:671:55398:29:30:99:539:554:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f3:pijt=α0+α1lnwijt+α2Xijt+α3Rjt+α4Nijt+μj+σjt+υit.(22)
19:672:55450:30:17:71:539:524:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Substitution eq.  (21) into the structural participation equation, gives the reduced-form participa-
19:673:55550:17:29:71:450:507:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tion equation, which is the selection equation for the Heckman selection model,
19:674:55629:29:30:99:539:478:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f3:pijt=a0+a1Xijt+a2Rjt+a3Nijt+μj+σjt+υit.(23)
19:675:55672:30:16:71:539:448:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We estimate this reduced-form participation equation first and then estimate the log hourly wage
19:676:55768:16:17:71:539:432:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:equation (21) including the inverse Mills ratio obtained from the estimated participation equation
19:677:55866:17:16:71:539:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(23).   In  this  approach,  the  wage  equation  is  identified  from  the  exclusion  of  other  household
19:678:55974:16:17:71:539:399:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:members’ labor income, and marital status from the wage equation, as well as from the normality
19:679:56069:17:16:71:539:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:assumption.28The structural hours equation (20) can then be estimated with imputed mothers’
19:680:56160:16:17:71:102:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:wages.
19:681:56166:17:16:88:539:349:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Since our measure of consumption risk is not directly observed but predicted for each village,
19:682:56260:16:16:71:539:333:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:robust standard errors clustered at the village level probably overstate the estimator’s precision.
19:683:56359:16:17:71:539:317:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We therefore additionally conduct a percentile t-bootstrap method with cluster re-sampling at the
19:684:56456:17:16:71:539:300:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:village level, and 4,999 replications.  Predicted consumption risk is re-calculated for every bootstrap
19:685:56559:16:17:71:539:284:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sample, and the distribution of t-statistics is obtained from regressing the outcome of interest in
19:686:56658:17:16:71:539:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:every bootstrap sample on a newly predicted risk variable. We report bootstrap p-values in addition
19:687:56757:16:17:71:328:251:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:to cluster-robust standard errors where appropriate.29
19:688:56811:17:16:88:539:234:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:As mentioned previously, the identifying assumption warrants some discussion.  Obviously, ir-
19:689:56904:16:17:71:539:218:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rigation systems are not placed randomly and one would expect wealthier villages to have more
19:690:56997:17:15:71:539:201:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:irrigation and lower consumption variability.  If wealthier villages have also higher school invest-
19:691:57097:15:15:80:539:186:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:27Alternatively one could use marginal wages, hence the lowest wages observed at which women supply a positive
19:692:57207:15:11:72:540:171:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:number of hours.  But we are worried that this measure cannot account for necessity-driven labor supply, i.e.  cases
19:693:57323:11:7:72:426:160:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:in which labor supply is high because wages are low in all activities that are performed.
19:694:57412:7:15:80:539:153:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:28Results are reported in the Appendix, Tables C.5 and C.6.  In our sample, 49 women report having a permanent
19:695:57522:15:11:72:540:138:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:job.  We assume that the wages of these women are determined by a different process than the casual wages observed
19:696:57636:11:11:72:540:127:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:for  the  rest  of  the  sample.   Therefore,  we  predict  wages  in  permanent  employment  separately  for  this  group.   As
19:697:57764:11:11:72:540:116:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:the participation in permanent jobs cannot be predicted by other household members’ income, marital status or the
19:698:57877:11:11:72:540:105:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:number of children in the household, we predict these wages without adjusting for self-selection as reported in Table
19:699:57994:11:7:72:88:94:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:C.6.
19:700:57998:7:15:80:539:87:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:29The percentile-t cluster bootstrap has a better asymptotic refinement than the simple pairs cluster bootstrap,
19:701:58110:15:0:72:509:72:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:and seems more appropriate in a sample with 221 clusters.  For more details see Cameron and Miller (2015).
20:702:58218:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ments,  a  regression  of  school  time  on  predicted  consumption  risk  would  yield  biased  estimates.
20:703:58325:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:However, we control for different sources of household income and wealth in all our specifications
20:704:58423:16:17:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and allowing for more flexibility in the relationship between income and hours in school does not
20:705:58520:17:16:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:affect our results.  Additionally, for the subset of farm-households, we control for the share of area
20:706:58622:16:17:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that is irrigated on the farm, to avoid attributing the effect of reduced female irrigation work on
20:707:58721:17:16:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the farm to a reduction in consumption risk.  Again,  our results do not change.  The full set of
20:708:58818:16:38:72:286:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:robustness checks is discussed in Section 6.3.

20:711:58905:23:17:72:540:521:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In the following we want to test explicitly for the validity of two crucial assumptions made in the
20:712:59004:17:16:72:539:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:theoretical model.  First, anex  postlabor supply response by mothers to economic shocks.  And
20:713:59098:16:17:72:527:488:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:second, substitutability in maternal and daughter time in the performance of household chores.
20:714:59192:17:16:88:539:471:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We start by estimating the effect of rainfall shocks on maternal labor supply and time allocated
20:715:59288:16:17:72:540:455:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to households chores (Table 5).  As before, our sample consists of all mothers in our data to use
20:716:59385:17:16:72:540:438:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the available information most efficiently.  We control for age, caste, religion, education, household
20:717:59487:16:17:72:540:422:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:size, number of children in the household, land ownership, non-labor income, other member’s labor
20:718:59584:17:16:72:540:405:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:income, and state fixed effects.  We do not control for risk, nor for wages, because we do not want
20:719:59683:16:16:72:540:389:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to mask the effect of shocks by conditioning on these variables.30We interact rainfall with a lean
20:720:59781:16:17:72:445:373:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:season dummy, to test explicitly for the timing of the labor supply response.31
20:721:59860:17:16:88:539:356:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Column  (1)  presents  the  effect  of  shocks  on  extensive  margin  labor  supply.   We  do  not  find
20:722:59965:16:17:72:540:340:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that  rainfall  affects  extensive  margin  labor  supply  in  either  season.   The  intensive  margin  labor
20:723:60075:17:16:72:540:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:supply response to shocks is shown in column (2).  While rainfall seems to have a positive (albeit
20:724:60173:16:17:72:540:307:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:not statistically significant) effect on labor supply in the agricultural peak seasons,  we find that
20:725:60274:17:16:72:539:290:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:negative rainfall shocks increase labor supply in the agricultural lean season, thusex  postto the
20:726:60372:16:16:72:540:274:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:full realization of rainfall outcomes.  As can be seen in column (3), the time allocation to household
20:727:60474:16:17:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:chores  seems  to  mirror  this,  although  the  coefficient  on  the  interaction  term  in  not  statistically
20:728:60586:17:16:72:123:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:significant.
20:729:60598:16:17:88:539:225:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:If maternal and daughter time are substitutes in the production of the home produced good,
20:730:60688:17:16:72:540:208:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:then any labor supply response of mothers to shocks should translate into the time their daughters
20:731:60786:16:17:72:540:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:allocate to household chores and spend in school.  We therefore test if shocks affect the time girls
20:732:60886:17:16:72:540:175:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:spend  on  those  activities  in  different  seasons  in  Table  6.   Again,  we  also  control  for  age,  caste,
20:733:61000:16:16:72:540:159:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:religion, household size, number of children in the household, land ownership, non-labor income,
20:734:61096:16:17:72:325:143:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:other member’s labor income, and state fixed effects.
20:735:61149:17:16:88:539:126:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:As  shown  in  columns  (1)  and  (2),  rainfall  shocks,  seem  to  affect  time  in  school  only  at  the
20:736:61257:16:16:72:540:110:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:intensive margin – not at the extensive margin–, and only in the lean season, but not in the peak
20:737:61354:16:11:80:367:94:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:30Remember that we allow predicted wages to vary with rainfall levels.
20:738:61424:11:0:80:493:83:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:31For a more direct interpretation of the interaction term, log rainfall is normalized to a mean of zero.
21:739:61531:0:17:72:539:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:seasons.  The seasonality of the effect is consistent with the theoretical model:ex  postto shocks,
21:740:61630:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:mothers have to work in order to generate additional income,  and this puts greater pressure on
21:741:61725:16:17:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f4:the daughter to reduce time in school and to perform household duties.  The fact that anex  post
21:742:61821:17:16:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:response to shocks only materializes at the intensive margin is consistent with the notion of fixed
21:743:61920:16:17:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:costs  of  school  attendance:   since  those  costs  had  to  be  incurred  already  at  the  time  of  shock
21:744:62030:17:16:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:realization, an intensive margin response is “less costly” than an extensive margin response.  Again,
21:745:62131:16:17:72:540:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the time allocation to household chores mirrors the effect on school time, as reported in column
21:746:62227:17:16:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(3).  On average, girls spend more time on household chores in the lean season than in the peak
21:747:62322:16:16:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:season, and only at very high rainfall outcomes that difference approaches zero and is no longer

21:750:62508:23:16:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We continue by examining how risk affects the time girls spend in school.  We have seasonal data
21:751:62604:16:17:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for 4,306 girls in the age group 6 to 16.  Our model predicts a negative effect of consumption risk
21:752:62703:17:16:72:540:472:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on time in school if there is a high degree of dynamic complementarity in the education production
21:753:62801:16:17:72:540:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:function.  At substitution elasticities of one, as observed in the YLS data from India, our model
21:754:62898:17:16:72:540:439:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:predicts a negative effect of risk only if household utility is increasing linearly in the stock of human

21:756:63013:17:16:88:539:406:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Table 7 reports OLS estimates of the effect of risk on time in school at the extensive margin in
21:757:63109:16:17:72:540:390:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:columns (1) and (2), and at the intensive margin in columns (3) and (4).  We use two variables to
21:758:63206:17:16:72:540:373:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:proxy consumption risk, i.e.  the interquartile range as well as the standard deviation of predicted
21:759:63306:16:16:72:540:357:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:log consumption.  As discussed above, we control for predicted wages of mothers and for individual
21:760:63404:16:17:72:540:341:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and  household-level  socio-economic  characteristics  in  all  our  specifications.   In  order  to  account
21:761:63513:17:16:72:540:324:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for the effect of non-labor income on time allocation, we include a measure of all other household
21:762:63611:16:17:72:539:308:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:members’ labor income as well as total household non-labor income per capita.34We also control
21:763:63705:17:16:71:539:291:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for rainfall shocks, state fixed effects, and a lean-season fixed effect.  Standard errors are clustered
21:764:63809:16:17:71:539:275:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:at the village level; i.e.  the level of variation of the main explanatory variable.  Bootstrap p-values
21:765:63913:17:16:71:262:258:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are reported at the bottom of the table.
21:766:63953:16:16:88:539:242:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We find that risk considerably reduces time in school at the extensive margin, but not at the
21:767:64046:16:17:71:539:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:intensive margin.  This suggests that girls drop out of school temporarily or permanently in the
21:768:64142:17:16:71:539:209:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:presence of risk, while there is little scope for adjusting the time in school at the intensive margin.
21:769:64245:16:17:71:539:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This result suggests the presence of an (unmodeled) fixed cost of school attendance, that causes
21:770:64341:17:16:71:539:176:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:households to withdraw a child from school entirely when faced with higher risk.  According to our
21:771:64439:16:16:71:539:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimates, a one standard deviation increase in the interquartile range of predicted log consumption
21:772:64539:16:15:80:539:144:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:32Note that the coefficient of the interaction term is not statistically significant, still marginal effects of the lean
21:773:64659:15:7:72:540:129:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:season are negative and significant at low rainfall levels, and close to zero (and not significant) and high rainfall levels.
21:774:64784:7:15:80:539:122:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:33Remember, a positive effect of risk on time in school could either stem from high risk aversion with respect to
21:775:64897:15:11:72:540:107:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:the final stock of human capital or from perfect substitutability of school times in the production of human capital
21:776:65013:11:7:72:291:96:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:at moderate levels of risk aversion with respect toH2.
21:777:65067:7:0:80:420:89:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:34Other household members’ labor income excludes the labor income of the mother.
22:778:65149:0:17:72:539:709:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:(0.033) reduces the probability that girls attend school by 5.8 percentage points in every season.35
22:779:65249:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This effect is statistically significant at the 1% level for both risk variables (c.f.  bootstrap p-values
22:780:65355:16:17:72:198:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:at the bottom of Table 7).
22:781:65381:17:16:88:539:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Mothers’ wages seem to be positively associated with time in school at the extensive margin,
22:782:65473:16:17:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and negatively at the intensive margin, although the coefficient is statistically significant only at the
22:783:65578:17:16:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:extensive margin. This suggests that the income effect, rather than the intra-household substitution
22:784:65678:16:17:72:540:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:effect dominates at the extensive margin.  However, due to the fact that we have to predict wages,
22:785:65776:17:16:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:we  caution  against  a  causal  interpretation  of  the  coefficient  on  mothers’  wages.   The  remaining
22:786:65884:16:16:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:coefficients have the expected sign:  as girls get older, they are less likely to attend school.  Girls
22:787:65987:16:17:72:540:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:belonging  to  scheduled  castes  and  tribes  are  less  likely  to  attend  school,  while  Hindu  girls  are
22:788:66098:17:16:72:540:544:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:more likely to attend school than girls from other religions.  As non-labor income increases,  the
22:789:66196:16:17:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:probability  of  attending  school,  as  well  as  the  time  spent  in  school  increases,  again  pointing  to
22:790:66308:17:16:72:141:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:income effects.
22:791:66323:16:17:88:539:495:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A potential concern about these measured effects of risk is that risk affects the future returns
22:792:66419:17:16:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to  human  capital  as  well  as  the  opportunity  cost  of  time,  which  is  the  focus  of  our  model.   As
22:793:66531:16:16:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:noted above, this concern is one of the reasons why we focus on daughters, who are likely to leave
22:794:66629:16:17:72:540:446:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the village following marriage.  Nonetheless, because risk is likely correlated across space, marriage
22:795:66731:17:16:72:540:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:market risk may well be correlated with consumption risk in the village of origin.  We address this
22:796:66830:16:17:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:problem by adapting a strategy from Foster and Rosenzweig (1999).  In particular, that paper uses
22:797:66927:17:16:72:540:396:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a radius of 67km to define the marriage market (the 90th percentile of the marriage distance).  It
22:798:67025:16:17:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:then distinguishes the returns to human capital for boys (that in the village) and the returns to
22:799:67122:17:16:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:human capital for girls (among sample villages in the broader marriage market).  In this case, we
22:800:67219:16:16:72:540:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:control  for  the  average  risk  among  sample  villages  within  67km  of  each  village  of  interest.   We
22:801:67329:16:17:72:540:331:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:exclude the village of interest from this mean and drop those villages in which there are no other
22:802:67427:17:16:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sample villages in the marriage market.  Table 8 reports the resulting estimates.  The coefficient
22:803:67525:16:17:72:540:298:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on marriage-market risk is close to zero and its inclusion does not substantially affect the point
22:804:67623:17:16:72:540:281:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimate on the coefficient of interest.  Thus, as posited in our model the risk estimates appear to
22:805:67723:16:32:72:540:265:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:reflect the consequences of risk for the opportunity cost of time of daughters while they are children.
22:806:67826:32:24:72:211:233:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:6.3    Robustness checks
22:807:67850:24:16:72:540:209:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:As girls spend less time in school in the presence of risk, overall household utility can be increased
22:808:67952:16:17:72:540:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:if the daughter spends her available time on household activities.  We test this prediction in Table
22:809:68052:17:16:72:540:176:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:9.  As before columns (1) and (2) report the extensive margin effects, and columns (3) and (4) the
22:810:68150:16:17:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:intensive margin effects.  Consistent with the theoretical model, we find evidence that risk increases
22:811:68252:17:16:72:540:143:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the time girls spend on household activities.  Again the effect is only statistically significant at the
22:812:68356:16:16:72:540:127:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:extensive margin.  The magnitude of the coefficient suggests that a one standard deviation increase
22:813:68455:16:17:72:540:111:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the interquartile range of predicted log consumption (0.033) increases the probability to perform
22:814:68555:17:15:80:539:94:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:35Likewise, an increase in the standard deviation of predicted log consumption by one standard deviation (0.025)
22:815:68667:15:0:72:363:79:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:reduces the probability that girls are in school by 5.2 percentage points.
23:816:68743:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:household chores by 2.9 percentage points.  A one standard deviation increase in our alternative risk
23:817:68844:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:variable, the standard deviation of predicted log consumption, increases the probability to perform
23:818:68943:16:17:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:household chores by 3.4 percentage points.  The effects are statistically significant at the 10% and
23:819:69043:17:16:72:384:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:at the 5% level, respectively, according to the bootstrap p-values.
23:820:69110:16:17:88:539:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The hypothesis that risk reduces time in school rests on the assumption that girls have to fill
23:821:69205:17:16:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in for their mothers in household duties when faced with shocks.  As the probability to perform
23:822:69300:16:17:72:540:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:household work strongly increases with age, this also suggests that the effect of risk should be more
23:823:69401:17:16:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:pronounced for older girls.36And this is precisely what we find, when we split the sample by age
23:824:69497:16:16:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:group.  The coefficient on both risk variables almost doubles in magnitude when moving from the
23:825:69592:16:17:72:371:561:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:group of girls below the age of 11 to girls aged 11 and above.37
23:826:69656:17:16:88:539:544:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:One concern could be that the observed effect of risk is not really a forward looking risk effect.
23:827:69754:16:17:71:539:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Suppose past school time increases the marginal return to current school time, and past school time
23:828:69853:17:16:71:539:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is lower in riskier areas due to more regularly occurring shocks.  Then current school time should
23:829:69951:16:17:71:539:495:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:also be lower given that there was more variation in school time previously.  In order to address this
23:830:70053:17:16:71:539:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:concern, we condition current school time on the stock of human capital – measured as the highest
23:831:70150:16:16:71:539:462:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:level of schooling achieved so far.  Given concerns about endogeneity, we instrument the stock of
23:832:70247:16:17:71:539:446:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:human capital by rainfall shocks occurring in the school history of a child.  Our results are robust
23:833:70347:17:16:71:238:429:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:to the inclusion of these controls.38
23:834:70384:16:17:88:539:413:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We also address the concern that our risk variables might capture wealth rather than variability
23:835:70480:17:16:71:539:396:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in consumption.  First, we test if dropping wealth and income controls, controlling more flexibly for
23:836:70581:16:17:71:539:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:these variables, or allowing for the effect of risk to vary with land ownership (as proxy for wealth)
23:837:70682:17:16:71:540:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:affects our results.39None of these specifications alters our main results.  Second, we test if there
23:838:70783:16:16:71:539:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is a direct relationship between area under irrigation and the probability of attending school for
23:839:70881:16:17:71:539:331:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the subset of farm-households, and if this is driving our results.  Again, controlling for the share
23:840:70981:17:16:71:539:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of area that is irrigated on the farm, its square or the interaction with consumption risk does not
23:841:71080:16:17:71:162:298:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:affect our results.40
23:842:71101:17:16:88:539:281:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Finally, if boys also have to fill in for mothers in household chores, and preferences for boys’
23:843:71197:16:17:72:540:265:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:human capital are similar to preferences for girls’ human capital, then we would expect to see a
23:844:71293:17:16:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:similar effect of risk on boys.  On the other hand, as noted above, boys are more likely than girls to
23:845:71395:16:17:72:540:232:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:remain in the village as adults and risk may affect the returns to human capital in the future.  Such
23:846:71496:17:16:72:540:215:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:effects might be either positive or negative, depending, among other things, on whether education
23:847:71593:16:16:72:540:199:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is seen as way to diversify income risk.  We therefore test if shocks affect the time boys spend in
23:848:71692:16:17:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:school, on household chores and on the labor market and whether risk also affects the schooling
23:849:71787:17:16:72:540:166:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of boys.  We find similar effects of rainfall shocks on boys to those on girls:  conditional on being
23:850:71888:16:15:80:539:150:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:36Figure B.1 in the Appendix plots the probability of performing household chores and of being in school by age.
23:851:72000:15:10:72:540:135:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:The probability that girls perform household duties increases continuously with age, while the probability of being
23:852:72115:10:8:72:244:125:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:in school starts to decline at the age of 11.
23:853:72160:8:11:80:286:117:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:37Results are reported in the Appendix, Table C.7.
23:854:72210:11:11:80:286:106:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:38Results are reported in the Appendix, Table C.8.
23:855:72260:11:11:80:286:95:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:39Results are reported in the Appendix, Table C.9.
23:856:72310:11:0:80:291:84:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:40Results are reported in the Appendix, Table C.10.
24:857:72363:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in school, a negative rainfall shock reduces the time boys spend in school in the agricultural lean
24:858:72462:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:season, and increases the time they spend on household activities.  Interestingly, boys do not seem
24:859:72561:16:17:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to spend more time, but rather less time on the labor market in the lean season when the household
24:860:72659:17:16:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is faced with a negative rainfall shock, perhaps reflecting a wage effect.  However, when we test for
24:861:72760:16:17:72:539:643:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:the effect of risk on boys,  we fail to find a statistically significant effect on school attendance.41
24:862:72863:17:16:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This result could reflect differences in the concavity of household preferences in the stock of human
24:863:72964:16:17:72:540:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:capital of their sons versus their daughters or, as posited above, differences in the return to human
24:864:73065:17:16:72:143:593:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:capital by risk.
24:865:73081:16:16:88:539:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To summarize, our results suggest a strong and robust relationship between risk at the household
24:866:73177:16:17:72:540:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:level and girls’ time allocation, both to school and to household chores, which seem to be driven by
24:867:73277:17:16:72:540:544:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:ex  postlabor supply responses of mothers to income shocks and the intra-household substitution
24:868:73372:16:17:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in  household  work.   These  effects  are  very  harmful  to  the  accumulation  of  human  capital,  and
24:869:73478:17:16:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:potentially for future earnings of these girls.  We will discuss the potential role for public policy
24:870:73579:16:32:72:323:495:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:later and now look at some alternative explanations.
24:871:73631:32:24:72:247:463:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:6.4    Alternative explanations
24:872:73662:24:16:72:540:439:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:An alternative explanation to the effect of consumption risk on daughters’ time in school might be
24:873:73760:16:17:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that her mother is simply trying to work more in order to increase savings, and therefore spends
24:874:73856:17:16:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:less time on household chores.  That households tend to save more in the presence of uninsured risk
24:875:73955:16:17:72:540:390:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is by now well established.  However, it is unclear to which extent this affects labor supply decisions.
24:876:74059:17:16:72:540:373:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Typically,  the literature has looked at foregone current consumption for the sake of higher (and
24:877:74156:16:16:72:540:357:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:more secure) future consumption (Zeldes, 1989; Deaton, 1991).  On the other side, one might think
24:878:74253:16:17:72:540:341:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that women would tend to work harder in order to accumulate savings more easily.  If this is the
24:879:74349:17:16:72:540:324:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:case, then we must worry that the observed effect on child outcomes is only an artifact of maternal
24:880:74448:16:17:72:180:308:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:labor supply decisions.
24:881:74471:17:16:88:539:291:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Table  10  shows  the  effect  of  risk  on  maternal  time  allocation.   In  columns  (1)  and  (2),  we
24:882:74577:16:17:72:540:275:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:test if risk affects maternal labor supply at the extensive margin, and do not find any statistically
24:883:74678:17:16:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:significant effect.  In columns (3) and (4), and (5) and (6) we test if risk affects hours worked on the
24:884:74782:16:16:72:540:242:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:labor market and on household chores, conditional on being in the labor force.  We do find some
24:885:74877:16:17:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:– albeit weak – evidence that mothers, conditional on being in the labor force, spend more time
24:886:74972:17:16:72:540:209:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on the labor market and less time on household chores in the presence of risk.  However, only the
24:887:75069:16:17:72:540:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:effect of risk on time allocated to household chores is statistically significant at the 10% level, when
24:888:75173:17:16:72:540:176:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:inference  is  based  on  the  bootstrap  p-values.   The  bootstrap  p-values  on  intensive  margin  labor
24:889:75281:16:17:72:255:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:supply are 15% and 22%, respectively.
24:890:75318:17:16:88:539:143:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:An alternative explanation for an effect of risk on maternal time allocation is that risk reduces
24:891:75415:16:16:72:540:127:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the time girls spend in school and increases their time in household activities, combined with the
24:892:75513:16:16:72:540:111:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:intra-household substitution in home production.  As a household can increase utility by increasing
24:893:75612:16:15:80:539:95:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:41Because the main substitution seems to work through household chores, we again control for maternal wages in
24:894:75722:15:0:72:429:80:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:the school time regression.  Results are reported in the Appendix, Tables C.11 and C.12.
25:895:75812:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:consumption of the home produced as well as the market produced good, mothers might decrease
25:896:75904:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the time they spend on household activities and work more on the labor market, when their daughter
25:897:76002:16:17:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:spend more time on household chores.  We can thus not conclusively identify the underlying causal
25:898:76099:17:16:72:375:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:mechanisms by looking at the time allocation of mothers alone.
25:899:76161:16:17:88:539:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Another, admittedly imperfect, way to approach this issue is to test if households tend to save
25:900:76256:17:16:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:more in the presence of uninsured risk.  Since households in this context typically have no access
25:901:76354:16:17:72:540:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to  good  liquid  savings,  our  very  crude  measure  of  savings  is  the  difference  between  household
25:902:76461:17:16:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:income and household consumption, which is probably measured with considerable error and also
25:903:76554:16:16:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:becomes negative as households dissave when faced with a shock.  We therefore restrict the sample
25:904:76651:16:17:72:540:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to households with positive savings.  As reported in Table 11, however, we do not find any evidence
25:905:76750:17:16:72:540:544:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that households tend to save more as risk increases.  If anything savings seem to decrease with risk.
25:906:76851:16:17:88:539:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:More importantly, in a multi-period model with known risk distribution, the effect of risk on
25:907:76944:17:16:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:incremental savings should be small in any given period because savings accumulation is substi-
25:908:77039:16:17:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tutable across time.  In contrast, any child human capital response is complementary over time and
25:909:77137:17:16:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tied to child age.  We thus have both theoretical and empirical arguments against the explanation
25:910:77234:16:16:72:487:462:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that observed effects on girls’ school time are driven by precautionary savings motives.
25:911:77322:16:17:88:539:446:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Above we used marriage market data to explore the possibility that the returns to education
25:912:77413:17:16:72:540:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:vary with risk.  An alternative approach is to test directly whether the wage return to education
25:913:77510:16:17:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:varies with risk. We do not find any evidence that risk in fact reduces the returns to education either
25:914:77613:17:16:72:540:396:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for men or for women.  Of course, this approach does not account for other possible consequences of
25:915:77712:16:17:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:risk such as the returns to entrepreneurship or the returns to migration.  But it is at least consistent
25:916:77816:17:16:72:461:363:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:with the idea that our effect of interest is not driven by the return to schooling.42
25:917:77901:16:16:88:539:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Finally, one might worry that any schooling response of girls is driven by supply side constraints
25:918:77999:16:17:71:539:331:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rather than demand side factors. For example, it could be that our risk measure is picking up general
25:919:78100:17:16:71:539:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:differences in village wealth which correlates with irrigation as well as with the supply of education.
25:920:78203:16:17:71:539:298:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We therefore test if our results are affected by controlling for the number of primary or secondary
25:921:78302:17:16:71:539:281:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:schools,  by  the  degree  of  teacher  absenteeism  or  the  availability  of  the  mid-day  meal  scheme  in
25:922:78412:16:38:71:318:265:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:schools.  None of these variables affect our results.43
25:923:78467:38:22:71:539:227:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:7    Simulating the effect of the NREGS on consumption risk, labor
25:924:78533:22:27:96:378:205:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:supply and human capital accumulation
25:925:78570:27:17:71:539:178:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Given the magnitude of the effects of risk observed above, it seems worthwhile to explore potential
25:926:78669:17:16:71:539:161:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:policy tools to mediate these.  Obviously, any policy tool that helps farmers insure against agricul-
25:927:78770:16:17:71:539:145:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tural production risk, could be a viable option.  But as Mobarak and Rosenzweig (2013) pointed
25:928:78864:17:16:71:539:128:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:out,  providing insurance to farmers might actually increase overall (consumption) risk in village
25:929:78962:16:16:71:539:112:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:economies as farmers become more risk taking in their production decisions.  This would then be
25:930:79057:16:11:80:286:96:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:42C.f.  with Tables C.13 and C.14 in the Appendix.
25:931:79107:11:0:80:265:85:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:43As reported in Table C.15 in the Appendix.
26:932:79153:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:particularly  harmful  for  the  poorest  households  with  no  own  land  and  no  access  to  agricultural
26:933:79261:17:16:72:120:692:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:insurance.
26:934:79271:16:17:88:539:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:An alternative could be an income-smoothing policy, such as the Indian National Rural Em-
26:935:79360:17:16:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ployment  Guarantee  Scheme,  that  was  introduced  in  rural  India  in  2006.   The  National  Rural
26:936:79463:16:17:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Employment Guarantee Act is India’s flagship anti-poverty program; it entitles every household in
26:937:79560:17:16:72:494:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rural India to a maximum of 100 days of employment per year at state minimum wages.
26:938:79643:16:17:88:539:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This  scheme  can  affect  schooling  decisions  through  two  effects:   first,  the  NREGS  provides
26:939:79745:17:16:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:employment at higher wages than casual agricultural wages, which affected both total labor supply
26:940:79842:16:16:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and the amount of labor supplied to the private sector,  and therewith equilibrium wages in the
26:941:79937:16:17:72:540:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:private sector (Berg et al., 2012; Imbert and Papp, 2015).  As documented by Shah and Steinberg
26:942:80032:17:16:72:540:544:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(2015) the resulting increase in wages did pull more women into the labor force and reduced the
26:943:80127:16:17:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:time women spent on household chores.  Due to intra-household substitution in home production,
26:944:80221:17:16:72:539:511:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:this also raised the opportunity costs of time for girls and reduced the time they spent in school.44
26:945:80322:16:17:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Second,  the  NREGS  reduces  consumption  risk  in  rural  areas,  because  it  provides  a  minimum
26:946:80423:17:16:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:amount of employment at a fixed wage level independently of rainfall shocks.  Assuming income
26:947:80516:16:16:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:effects dominate maternal wage allocation, the fact that the wage does not fall during periods of
26:948:80613:16:17:72:540:446:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:need is likely to reduce the magnitude of the labor supply response of women relative to case in
26:949:80709:17:16:72:540:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:which there are general equilibrium wage effects.  This effect should in turn reduce the extent of
26:950:80807:16:17:72:539:413:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the response among girlsex post.  This lower response, in turn, increases the return to first-period
26:951:80907:17:16:72:129:396:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:school time.
26:952:80919:16:17:88:539:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The following simulation of the effects of the NREGS seeks to shed light on the importance of
26:953:81012:17:16:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:this second mechanism and is intended to complement existing empirical evidence on the short-
26:954:81105:16:16:72:540:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:term impact of the NREGS on schooling outcomes.  We expect that the risk mitigating effect of
26:955:81198:16:17:72:540:331:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the NREGS is internalized by households only after a certain period of time.  Therefore this effect
26:956:81297:17:16:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cannot  be  captured  by  impact  evaluations  that  explore  the  sequenced  phase-in  of  the  NREGS
26:957:81399:16:17:72:539:298:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and which can thus only provide information about the short-time effects of the program.45This
26:958:81493:17:16:72:540:281:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:simulation is intended to provide insights about potential long-run effects associated with public
26:959:81591:16:17:72:249:265:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:works programs such as the NREGS.
26:960:81624:17:16:88:539:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To estimate the importance of the risk-reduction effect of the NREGS on time in school, we use
26:961:81718:16:17:72:540:232:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the Socio-Economic Profiles of Rural Households in India (SEPRI) data of 2014.  It is a follow-up
26:962:81815:17:16:72:540:215:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:survey to the REDS that was collected in 8 states of India:  Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh,
26:963:81912:16:16:72:540:199:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Haryana, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan.  It samples the entire popula-
26:964:82004:16:17:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tion of the REDS survey villages, but applies a questionnaire that is considerably shorter than in
26:965:82102:17:16:72:131:166:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:the REDS.46
26:966:82113:16:16:88:539:150:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Using the SEPRI data, we estimate the extent to which the presence of the NREGS, or more
26:967:82201:16:11:80:428:134:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:44Li and Sekhri (2013) also find evidence that the NREGS reduced school attendance.
26:968:82284:11:15:80:539:123:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:45Given that we estimate the wage elasticity of different activities, we could also simulate a potential wage effect
26:969:82400:15:11:72:540:108:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:of the NREGS, and attempt to predict a net effect.  But due to the cross-sectional nature of our data we do not trust
26:970:82517:11:11:72:540:97:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:the wage coefficients to be precise enough to perform such an analysis and restrict ourselves to an analysis of the risk
26:971:82637:11:7:72:202:86:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:mitigating effect of the NREGS.
26:972:82668:7:0:80:416:79:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:46Summary statistics of the SEPRI data are shown in Table C.16 in the Appendix.
27:973:82749:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:specifically, the amount of employment generated within the NREGS in a given year, mediates the
27:974:82844:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:effect of rainfall on household consumption.  Formally, we estimate the same equation as in Table
27:975:82941:16:17:72:540:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:3,  but  now  add  employment  per  capita  (in  person-days)  generated  in  a  given  village  within  the
27:976:83049:17:16:72:539:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:NREGS and its interaction with rainfall to the estimation.  Results are reported in Table 12.47We
27:977:83146:16:17:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:find that a one unit increase in employment per capita generated, reduces the effect of rainfall on
27:978:83245:17:16:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:consumption by 4.7 percentage points.48We use these results to predict the standard deviation of
27:979:83341:16:17:72:462:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:predicted log consumption at different levels of employment per capita generated.
27:980:83422:17:16:88:553:593:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To make our simulation comparable to existing studies, we need an estimate of average employment-
27:981:83519:16:16:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:days created within the NREGS for the time period of these studies.  The most well documented
27:982:83612:16:17:72:540:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:paper on the effect of the NREGS is by Imbert and Papp (2015).  Using data from 2004/05 and
27:983:83703:17:16:72:540:544:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:2007/08,  the  authors  estimate  the  effects  of  the  NREGS  on  casual  wages.   In  the  financial  year

27:985:83918:17:16:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:population  of  642  Million.49In  that  year,  the  total  amount  of  employment-days  created  within
27:986:84022:16:17:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the NREGS was 1,435.9 Million (Ministry of Rural Development, 2012).  The average number of
27:987:84113:17:16:72:516:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:person-days of employment generated per capita was thus 2.24 in the implementing districts.
27:988:84204:16:16:88:539:462:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In the SEPRI data, average employment creation per capita within the NREGS is 0.76, with
27:989:84292:16:17:72:540:446:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a standard deviation of 1.23, in 2011/12.  At the mean of irrigation and the minimum of NREGS
27:990:84385:17:16:72:540:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:employment  creation  (i.e.   zero  employment),  an  increase  in  NREGS  employment  by  2.24  days
27:991:84486:16:17:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:per  capita  would  reduce  the  standard  deviation  of  log  consumption  by  0.029  on  average.   This
27:992:84592:17:16:72:540:396:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:corresponds to a 43.0% reduction in risk as compared to the baseline of no NREGS employment in
27:993:84686:16:17:72:180:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:2014 (c.f.  Table C.16).
27:994:84710:17:16:88:539:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:With these estimates we can simulate the risk-mitigating effect of the NREGS on the probability
27:995:84805:16:16:72:540:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that girls attend school.  Using the estimates presented in Table 7,  column (2), the reduction in
27:996:84903:16:17:72:540:331:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:risk exposure by 43% of the mean – as can be attributed to the NREGS – increases the probability
27:997:84999:17:16:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of attending school by 2.9 percentage points.  Our simulation thus suggests that an employment
27:998:85093:16:17:72:540:298:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:guarantee such as the NREGS can have positive effects on girls’ human capital accumulation by
27:999:85186:17:16:72:540:281:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:reducing consumption risk.  However, from previous literature we know that the extent to which
27:1000:85280:16:17:72:540:265:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:such programs affect adult’s wages is also critical.  If the wage effect outweighs the risk reducing
27:1001:85380:17:16:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:effect, or in other words, if the risk reducing effect is not high enough to offset the negative effect of
27:1002:85486:16:17:72:540:232:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:increasing wages, then an employment guarantee such as the NREGS decreases school attendance
27:1003:85578:17:15:72:416:215:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:not only in the first years of program implementation, but permanently.
27:1004:85649:15:15:80:539:200:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:47The rainfall data covers the agricultural year 2012/13, which is presumably the period that determines consump-
27:1005:85762:15:11:72:540:185:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:tion outcomes in 2014.  Due to data limitations we have to use the amount of employment generated in the financial
27:1006:85876:11:7:72:362:174:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:year 2011/12.  The NREGS data of 2012/13 is incomplete in the survey.
27:1007:85945:7:15:80:539:167:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:48In both regressions, we drop 1,786 observations in order to reduce the influence of outliers.  Outliers are detected
27:1008:86063:15:11:72:540:152:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:using the DFBETA statistic for the share of irrigated land and the usual cutoff value of 2/sqrt(N), with N being the
27:1009:86179:11:7:72:168:141:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:number of observations.
27:1010:86202:7:15:80:539:134:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:49This  is  the  projected  population  as  of  March  2007  of  Phase  I  and  Phase  II  districts,  thus  all  districts  that
27:1011:86331:15:11:72:540:119:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:implemented the NREGS by May 2008. To get the population estimates, we apply the India-wide projected population
27:1012:86443:11:11:72:540:108:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:growth rate to the Census 2001 population count of these districts.  The projected growth rate was obtained from

28:1014:86598:0:28:72:180:709:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:8    Conclusions
28:1015:86614:28:16:72:540:681:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This paper develops a model of human capital investment that highlights the joint effect of consump-
28:1016:86714:16:17:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tion risk and dynamic complementarity in the production of human capital.  The model highlights
28:1017:86809:17:16:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that risk affects the time girls spend in school as long as three conditions are met.  First, there is
28:1018:86911:16:16:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:dynamic complementarity in the education production function.  Second, there is substitutability
28:1019:87007:16:17:72:540:616:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of maternal and daughter time in home production, and third, mother’s respond to income shocks
28:1020:87101:17:16:72:263:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:by increasing their labor supplyex post.
28:1021:87141:16:17:88:539:583:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Under these three conditions the effect of risk is consistently negative as long as household utility
28:1022:87242:17:16:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is assumed to increase linearly in the daughter’s final stock of human capital.  If the household’s
28:1023:87341:16:17:72:540:550:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:marginal utility decreases with increasing stocks of human capital – in other words, if the household
28:1024:87442:17:16:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is risk-averse with respect to the stock of human capital – the effect of risk on school investment is
28:1025:87544:16:16:72:540:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:negative at very high levels of dynamic complementarity, and turns positive as school investments
28:1026:87641:16:17:72:322:501:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of different time periods become more substitutable.
28:1027:87693:17:16:88:539:484:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Using the Young Lives Data of India, we estimate the elasticity of substitution in school times
28:1028:87788:16:17:72:540:468:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:between periods.  Using a non-linear instrumental variables approach, we cannot reject substitution
28:1029:87887:17:16:72:540:451:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:elasticities of one.  At this level, the model predicts a negative effect of risk only if household utility
28:1030:87994:16:17:72:540:435:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:increases linearly in human capital.  In contrast, if household utility is log-linear in human capital,
28:1031:88097:17:16:72:307:418:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the predicted effect of risk on school time is zero.
28:1032:88149:16:17:88:539:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We test the model’s assumptions and implications in the context of rural India, and find strong
28:1033:88244:17:16:72:540:385:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:evidence for a negative effect of risk on the probability that girls attend school.  While the main
28:1034:88343:16:16:72:540:369:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:focus of this paper lies on school attendance, we also find evidence that girls who are more exposed
28:1035:88443:16:17:72:540:353:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to risk also spend more time on household activities.  Taken together, these findings point to the
28:1036:88541:17:16:72:383:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:detrimental consequences of risk on human capital accumulation.
28:1037:88604:16:17:88:539:320:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This  effect  can  only  be  explained  by  dynamic  complementarity  in  the  production  of  human
28:1038:88704:17:16:72:540:303:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:capital, and by a household utility that increases linearly (or close to linearly) in the human capital
28:1039:88807:16:17:72:540:287:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:stock of the child.  Such a utility function is consistent with overlapping-generations models as long
28:1040:88909:17:16:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as we account for households expectations of a convex relationship between years of schooling and
28:1041:89006:16:16:72:141:254:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:future income.
28:1042:89020:16:17:88:539:238:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:These findings contribute to a better understanding of the consequences of dynamic comple-
28:1043:89110:17:16:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:mentarity in the production of human capital.  Dynamic complementarity not only calls for early
28:1044:89205:16:17:72:540:205:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:lifetime interventions in order to remedy the consequences of shocks, and to reduce inequality of op-
28:1045:89306:17:16:72:540:188:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:portunities.  We also need to think of better ways to support households, particularly in developing
28:1046:89406:16:17:72:369:172:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:countries, in dealing with various sources of consumption risk.
28:1047:89469:17:16:88:539:155:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Arguably,  a public works program could be a policy that supports households in contexts of
28:1048:89560:16:16:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:high exposure to climate risk, because it off-sets the negative effects of rainfall shocks on wages and
28:1049:89663:16:17:72:540:123:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:incomes.  We simulate the effect of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme on the time
28:1050:89757:17:16:72:540:106:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:allocation of girls.  We estimate the extent to which NREGS reduces variability in consumption
28:1051:89851:16:17:72:540:90:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and use this reduction to simulate the effect of the program on girls’ time in school.  We find that
28:1052:89951:17:0:72:540:73:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the program would increase girls’ school attendance by 2.9 percentage points, holding the level of
29:1053:90051:0:17:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:wages fixed.  These results suggest that income transfers,  either in the form of cash transfers or
29:1054:90150:17:16:72:540:692:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:public works programs could increase investments in human capital by reducing consumption risk.
29:1055:90245:16:17:88:539:676:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:However such programs need to be carefully designed.  As shown in the case of the NREGS, the
29:1056:90337:17:16:72:540:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:fact that public works wages were above market wages let to increasing wages and to declines in the
29:1057:90436:16:17:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:enrollment rates of adolescents.  While we cannot assess if the risk effect could have later mitigated
29:1058:90538:17:16:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the  negative  wage  effect  on  human  capital  accumulation  that  was  evident  during  the  program’s
29:1059:90643:16:17:72:540:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:phase-in, our results do support the idea that policies that support households in smoothing incomes
29:1060:90743:17:16:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:without raising wages, will also increase school investments.  Our results also speak to the design
29:1061:90842:16:16:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of  such  programs:  welfare  effects  can  be  maximized  by  making  access  to  work  transparent  and
29:1062:90947:16:17:72:540:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:reliable, and by differentially targeting such programs at villages that are more regularly affected
29:1063:91047:17:0:72:160:544:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:by adverse shocks.

46:1521:113891:20:14:72:540:629:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The Young Lives survey was collected between 2002 and 2013-14 in Andhra Pradesh, a state in the
46:1522:113986:14:13:72:540:615:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:south of India.  Three rounds of data were available at the time of writing this article, and given our
46:1523:114089:13:14:72:540:602:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:focus on school age children we restrict our analysis to rounds 2 (2007) and 3 (2009-10).  Summary
46:1524:114187:14:13:72:506:588:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:statistics for the variables used in this analysis are reported in Table C.1 of this Appendix.
46:1525:114281:13:14:88:539:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The data contains various features that are crucial to estimating a production function (and
46:1526:114373:14:13:72:540:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:specifically the complementarity parameters) of cognitive skills.  First of all YLS performs different
46:1527:114475:13:14:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cognitive tests: a Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), a math test, a reading comprehension
46:1528:114570:14:14:72:540:534:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:test (EGRA), a Cognitive Development Assessment (CDA) and a verbal test (CLOZE). The test
46:1529:114659:14:13:72:540:520:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:scores of all these tests are internally standardized.  Over time and across cohorts, different tests
46:1530:114760:13:14:72:540:507:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are being administered.  For the younger cohort we use the PPVT and CDA as measurements of
46:1531:114850:14:13:72:540:493:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:past cognition, and the PPVT, the math test and the EGRA for current cognition.  For the older
46:1532:114944:13:14:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cohort, we use the PPVT and the math test as measurements for past cognition, and the PPVT,
46:1533:115035:14:13:72:540:466:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the math test and the CLOZE for current cognition.  We use reported time in school and studying
46:1534:115130:13:14:72:540:453:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as the only investment variable in our production function.  Finally, we use the years of education
46:1535:115229:14:0:72:521:439:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:completed by the mother and the father of each child as measurements for parental cognition.
