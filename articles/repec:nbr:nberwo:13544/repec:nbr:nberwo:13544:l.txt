2:30:1534:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:A:We analyze the policy trade-offs generated by local currency price stability of imports in economies
2:31:1634:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:A:where upstream producers strategically interact with downstream firms selling the final goods to consumers.
2:32:1741:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:A:We study the effects of staggered price setting at the downstream level on the optimal price (and markup)
2:33:1846:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:A:chosen by upstream producers and show that downstream price movements affect the desired markup
2:34:1941:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:A:of upstream producers, magnifying their price response to shocks. We revisit the international dimensions
2:35:2046:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:A:of optimal monetary policy, unveiling an argument in favor of consumer price stability as the main
2:36:2144:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:A:prescription for monetary policy. Since stable consumer prices feed back into a low volatility of markups
2:37:2249:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:A:among upstream producers, this contains inefficient deviations from the law of one price at the border.
2:38:2352:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:A:However, efficient stabilization of different CPI components will not generally result into perfect stabilization
2:39:2465:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:A:of headline inflation. National policies optimally respond to the same shocks in a similar way, thus
2:40:2565:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:A:containing volatility of the terms of trade, but not necessarily of the real exchange rate. The latter will
2:41:2672:14:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:A:be more volatile, among other things, the larger the home bias in expenditure and the content of local
2:42:2774:14:42:72:198:420:12:Times:12:Times:A:inputs in consumer goods.

3:59:3155:0:31:63:176:714:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:1  Introduction
3:60:3170:31:20:63:517:683:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The high degree of stability of import prices in local currency, documented both at the border
3:61:3264:20:21:63:517:663:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and at consumer level, vis--a-vis large movements in exchange rates, raises issues at the core of
3:62:3361:21:20:63:516:642:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the design of national monetary policies in a globalizing world economy.1On the one hand, a
3:63:3452:20:20:63:517:622:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:low elasticity of import prices with respect to the exchange rate can result from the presence
3:64:3546:20:21:63:517:602:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of costs incurred locally before the imported goods reach the consumers, such as distribution
3:65:3639:21:20:63:517:581:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:costs or assembling costs, i.e. costs of combining imported intermediated inputs with domestic
3:66:3733:20:20:63:517:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:inputs. By the same token, it may result from optimal markup adjustment by monopolistic
3:67:3820:20:21:63:517:541:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:\frms, which maximize pro\fts through price discrimination across national markets (\pricing to
3:68:3915:21:20:63:517:520:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:market"). These are real sources of local-currency price stability of imports, which in\ruence
3:69:4009:20:20:63:517:500:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:pricing even in the absence of nominal rigidities. Although these factors may result in ine--
3:70:4102:20:20:63:517:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ciencies | like deviations from the law of one price due to pricing to market | they also shield
3:71:4198:20:21:63:517:460:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:price and wage dynamics from currency volatility, thus helping central banks maintain a low
3:72:4289:21:20:63:517:439:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and stable headline in\ration. On the other hand, stable import prices and low exchange rate
3:73:4381:20:20:63:517:419:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:pass-through can also stem from nominal frictions impeding desired markup adjustment, thus
3:74:4471:20:21:63:517:399:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:interfering with equilibrium movements in relative prices. When local-currency-price stability of
3:75:4568:21:20:63:517:378:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:imports is due to price stickiness, it creates policy trade-o-s between competing objectives, e.g.
3:76:4666:20:20:63:517:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:between stabilizing the prices of domestically produced goods as opposed to the (relative) price
3:77:4762:20:21:63:517:338:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of imported goods, which raise the importance of international considerations in the conduct of
3:78:4857:21:20:63:142:317:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:monetary policy.
3:79:4873:20:20:80:517:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In this paper we reconsider these policy trade-o-s in economies where stable import prices in
3:80:4966:20:21:63:517:277:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:local currency result from both nominal rigidities and endogenous destination-speci\fc markup
3:81:5059:21:20:63:517:256:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:adjustment. We specify a two country model where each economy produces an array of country-
3:82:5150:20:20:63:517:236:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:speci\fc, di-erentiated traded goods.  In each country, we model local downstream \frms as
3:83:5240:20:21:63:517:216:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:using one intermediate traded good, and possibly local inputs, to produce nontradable \fnal
3:84:5331:21:20:63:517:195:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:goods. In other words, each intermediate good is produced by an upstream monopolist and
3:85:5418:20:20:63:517:175:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sold to a continuum of monopolistic downstream \frms, active in each country, from which local
3:86:5512:20:16:63:517:155:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consumers can directly buy further di-erentiated \fnal varieties. Thus, because both upstream
3:87:5605:16:21:75:517:139:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:1See, e.g., Engel and Rogers, [1996]; Goldberg and Knetter, [1997]; Campa and Goldberg, [2005] and Frankel
3:88:5711:21:0:63:114:118:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:et al. [2004].
4:89:5726:0:20:63:517:714:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and downstream \frms have monopoly power, \fnal prices re\rect double marginalization. We
4:90:5815:20:20:63:517:694:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:posit that markets are segmentated across national borders, so that intermediate producers price-
4:91:5912:20:21:63:517:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:discriminate between domestic and foreign local downstream producers as a group, although not
4:92:6005:21:20:63:471:653:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:among individual local producers (charging di-erent prices within the same country).
4:93:6089:20:20:80:517:633:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:As in standard monetary models, we assume that \frms set prices in local currency, adjusting
4:94:6181:20:21:63:517:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:them infrequently according to the Calvo mechanism.2Di-erent from the previous literature,
4:95:6271:21:20:63:517:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:however, we explicitly model strategic interactions among upstream and downstream \frms:
4:96:6359:20:20:63:517:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:upstream \frms exercise their monopoly power by taking into account country-speci\fc di-erences
4:97:6454:20:21:63:517:552:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the properties of the demand for their products. Relative to the literature already modelling
4:98:6550:21:20:63:517:531:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:vertical interactions between exporters and local \frms (e.g. Bacchetta and Van Wincoop [2005],
4:99:6645:20:20:63:517:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Corsetti and Dedola [2005], Devereux and Engel [2007], Monacelli [2005]), an important novel
4:100:6737:20:21:63:517:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:contribution of this paper consists of analyzing the e-ects of staggered price setting at the
4:101:6830:21:20:63:467:470:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:downstream level on the optimal price (and markup) chosen by upstream producers.
4:102:6910:20:20:80:517:450:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Speci\fcally, our analysis establishes three key characteristics of the perceived demand elas-
4:103:7004:20:21:63:517:430:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ticity by upstream producers when nominal rigidities constrain price decisions by downstream
4:104:7096:21:20:63:517:409:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:\frms.First, this elasticity is a decreasing function of the rate of change of \fnal prices in each
4:105:7195:20:20:63:517:389:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:industry: the higher this rate (thus the higher the price dispersion among \fnal producers selling
4:106:7293:20:21:63:516:369:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:an industry product), the higher the intermediate producer's equilibrium markup.Second, the
4:107:7384:21:20:63:517:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:perceived demand elasticity is market-speci\fc, depending on di-erences in industry-speci\fc in-
4:108:7480:20:20:63:517:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:\ration rates across the domestic and the export market. Sticky prices at consumer level create
4:109:7575:20:21:63:517:308:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:an incentive for upstream \frms to price discriminate across borders, which leads to equilibrium
4:110:7671:21:20:63:517:287:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:deviations from the law of one price, independently of the degree of nominal rigidities in the
4:111:7765:20:20:63:516:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:upstream \frms' own prices.Third, if either local inputs in downstream production are good
4:112:7855:20:21:63:517:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:substitute of intermediate imported goods, or their share in the downstream \frms' costs is low,
4:113:7951:21:20:63:517:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the demand elasticity is decreasing in the price charged by upstream producers. In other words,
4:114:8046:20:20:63:517:206:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:downstream nominal rigidities magnify the price response to shocks by upstream monopolists
4:115:8136:20:21:63:517:186:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:who optimally reset their price in any given period. This generates strategic substitutability
4:116:8230:21:20:63:517:165:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:among upstream producers: a rise in marginal costs will lead to an increase in their desired
4:117:8322:20:20:63:107:145:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:markups.

5:119:8377:0:20:80:516:714:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:These results have at least two notable implications for policy modelling and design.First, by
5:120:8471:20:20:63:517:694:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:shedding light on the link between optimal price adjustment at the dock and domestic in\ration
5:121:8565:20:21:63:517:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rates, our results suggest a speci\fc reason why, in line with the observations by Taylor [2000],
5:122:8662:21:20:63:517:653:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:lower CPI in\ration volatility and price dispersion may result in a lower degree of exchange-
5:123:8755:20:20:63:517:633:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rate pass-through: stable in\ration reduces at the margin the producers' incentives to price
5:124:8847:20:21:63:517:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:discriminate across countries, decreasing the sensitivity of their `desired markup' to cost changes.
5:125:8947:21:20:80:516:592:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f3:A:Second, by showing that downstream price rigidities result into strategic substitutability
5:126:9037:20:20:63:517:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:among upstream producers, our results emphasize that adding several layers of nominal rigidi-
5:127:9130:20:21:63:517:552:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ties do not necessarily results into more price inertia. Strategic interactions among vertically
5:128:9226:21:20:63:517:531:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:integrated \frms with sticky prices may create incentive for large price adjustment, feeding back
5:129:9323:20:20:63:173:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:into in\ration volatility.
5:130:9349:20:21:80:517:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In addition, our model speci\fcation implies an important dimension of heterogeneity across
5:131:9440:21:20:63:517:470:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:\frms which has a bearing on optimal monetary policy.  In contrast to standard models, the
5:132:9530:20:20:63:517:450:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:marginal costs of our downstream \frms are generally not symmetric, not even when the economy
5:133:9623:20:21:63:517:430:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is completely closed to foreign trade and there are no markup shocks. Thus, monetary authorities
5:134:9719:21:20:63:354:409:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:are not able to achieve complete stabilization of \fnal prices.3
5:135:9783:20:20:80:517:389:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The mechanism underlying these results is di-erent from that emphasized by the previous
5:136:9870:20:21:63:517:369:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:literature focusing on vertical interactions between upstream and downstream \frms, but that
5:137:9962:21:20:63:517:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:stresses real determinants of the local currency price stability of imports. In previous work of
5:138:10058:20:20:63:517:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ours, we assume that local \frms produce consumer goods by combining intermediate tradable
5:139:10148:20:21:63:517:308:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:goods with local inputs (Corsetti and Dedola [2005], Corsetti, Dedola, and Leduc [2007]). In
5:140:10240:21:20:63:517:287:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:this framework, provided that the tradable goods and the local inputs are poor substitutes
5:141:10330:20:20:63:517:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in production, the presence of local inputs tends to mute the response of upstream prices to
5:142:10422:20:21:63:517:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:shocks (corresponding to a case of strategic complementarity), and makes the exchange-rate
5:143:10512:21:20:63:517:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:pass-through incomplete, even in the absence of nominal rigidities. Building an example of an
5:144:10605:20:20:63:517:206:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:economy encompassing both channels, we analyze conditions under which the properties of the
5:145:10696:20:21:63:517:186:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:demand elasticity faced by upstream producers are dominated by the e-ect of local inputs in
5:146:10787:21:15:63:398:165:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:production, as opposed to the e-ect of downstream nominal rigidities.
5:147:10856:15:21:75:517:150:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:3In standard models with cost-push and markup shocks, monetary authorities can achieve complete price
5:148:10957:21:16:63:517:129:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:stability, but face trade-o-s that motivate deviations from it | see for instance the discussion in Woodford
5:149:11065:16:0:63:377:113:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:[2003]. In our model, instead, stability of all prices is unfeasible to start with.
6:150:11149:0:20:80:517:714:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We characterize the optimal cooperative monetary policy under commitment. In order to
6:151:11234:20:20:63:517:694:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:reduce ine-ciencies due to price stickiness, monetary policy does mitigate \ructuations in the
6:152:11328:20:21:63:517:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:major components of consumer price in\ration. However, it falls short of stabilizing completely
6:153:11423:21:20:63:353:653:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:either the CPI, or the price of domestic intermediate goods.4
6:154:11484:20:20:80:517:633:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Optimal monetary policies address di-erent trade-o-s, speci\fc to both the international and
6:155:11576:20:21:63:517:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the domestic dimensions of the economy. First, as in Corsetti and Pesenti [2005], nominal rigidi-
6:156:11673:21:20:63:517:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ties in local currency at upstream level lead benevolent monetary authorities to attach a positive
6:157:11771:20:20:63:517:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:weight to stabilizing the consumer price of imports, and thus deviate from perfect stabilization
6:158:11867:20:21:63:517:552:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the \fnal prices of domestic goods. Second, downstream technology shocks prevent perfect
6:159:11958:21:20:63:517:531:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:stabilization of all consumer prices, because vertical interactions with upstream \frms, which
6:160:12052:20:20:63:517:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:may or may not adjust their prices, induce heterogeneity of marginal costs at retail level. This
6:161:12148:20:21:63:517:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:e-ect is compounded in an open economy setting, because of the response of the intermediate
6:162:12239:21:20:63:517:470:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:price of imports to exchange rate \ructuations. Third, the elasticity of the producer's demand
6:163:12333:20:20:63:517:450:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:curve falls with the industry's dispersion of \fnal goods prices, motivating policy emphasis on
6:164:12428:20:21:63:175:430:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:\fnal price stabilization.
6:165:12454:21:20:80:517:409:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:None of these trade-o-s, however, entail speci\fc prescriptions regarding the volatility of the
6:166:12549:20:20:63:517:389:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:real exchange rate. In the literature, optimal monetary policy in models with nominal rigidities
6:167:12645:20:21:63:517:369:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in local currency is sometimes associated with a limited degree of real exchange rate volatility,
6:168:12742:21:20:63:517:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:relative to the terms of trade | see e.g. Devereux and Engel [2007]. In contrast, we \fnd that
6:169:12836:20:20:63:517:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:implementing the optimal policy in our economy with nominal rigidities leads the real exchange
6:170:12930:20:21:63:517:308:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rate to be more volatile, and the terms of trade to be less volatile, than in the same economy
6:171:13024:21:20:63:517:287:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:under \rexible prices.  This is because of the combined e-ects of nominal rigidities, and the
6:172:13117:20:20:63:517:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:presence of nontradable components in \fnal goods. We take these \fndings as a caution against
6:173:13211:20:21:63:517:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:strong policy prescriptions on the need to curb the volatility of the real exchange rate. The
6:174:13304:21:20:63:517:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:point is that, while there are good reasons to expect optimal policies to contain the volatility
6:175:13400:20:20:63:517:206:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the terms of trade, these reasons cannot be mechanically extended to the real exchange rate,
6:176:13495:20:21:63:479:186:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:whose volatility is bound to depend on a number of structural features of the economy.
6:177:13581:21:15:80:517:165:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:This paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we will brie\ry survey the literature

7:184:14239:21:20:63:517:653:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:our calibration of the model. Section 6 presents the equilibrium dynamics of prices in response to
7:185:14337:20:20:63:517:633:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:shocks, while Section 7 discusses the allocation under the optimal policy, relative to alternative
7:186:14435:20:21:63:517:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:policy rules and the case of \rexible prices. Section 8 concludes. An appendix provides analytical

7:193:14954:20:20:63:517:430:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:A core issue underlying these debates is whether monetary policy should react to international
7:194:15048:20:21:63:517:410:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:variables, such as the exchange rate or the terms of trade, beyond the in\ruence that these vari-
7:195:15145:21:20:63:517:389:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ables have on the domestic output gap (for example, via external demand) and on the domestic
7:196:15237:20:20:63:517:369:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:good prices | so that it would have a speci\fc `international dimension.' As discussed below,
7:197:15330:20:21:63:517:349:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:models stressing the stability of import prices in local currency have provided one possible an-
7:198:15426:21:20:63:517:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:swer to this question stressing the implications of nominal rigidities for monetary transmission

7:202:15629:27:21:63:517:224:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:At the heart of the international dimension of monetary policy lies the role of the exchange
7:203:15721:21:20:63:517:203:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rate in the international transmission mechanism. Consistent with traditional open macroeco-
7:204:15813:20:20:63:517:183:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:nomic models, the seminal contribution to the New Open Economy Macroeconomics (henceforth
7:205:15902:20:21:63:517:163:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:NOEM) by Obstfeld and Rogo- [1995] embraces the view that exchange rate movements play
7:206:15988:21:20:63:517:142:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the stabilizing role of adjusting international relative prices in response to shocks, when frictions
7:207:16089:20:20:63:517:122:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:prevent or slow down price adjustment in the local currency. The idea is that nominal depre-
7:208:16181:20:0:63:517:102:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ciation transpires into real depreciation, making domestic goods cheaper in the world markets,
8:209:16276:0:20:63:517:714:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:hence redirecting world demand towards them: exchange rate movements therefore have `ex-
8:210:16364:20:20:63:517:694:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:penditure switching e-ects'. Accordingly, NOEM contributions after Obstfeld and Rogo- [1995]
8:211:16456:20:21:63:517:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:draw on the Mundell{Fleming and Keynesian tradition, and posit that \frms preset the price for
8:212:16550:21:20:63:517:653:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:their products in domestic currency, implying that export prices are sticky in the currency of
8:213:16644:20:20:63:517:633:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the producers | this is why such hypothesis is commonly dubbed `producer currency pricing'
8:214:16734:20:21:63:517:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(henceforth PCP). Under this hypothesis, nominal import prices in local currency move one-to-
8:215:16827:21:20:63:517:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:one with the exchange rate and pass-through is perfect. In the baseline model with preset prices,
8:216:16924:20:20:63:517:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to the extent that the demand elasticities are identical across countries, there is no incentive
8:217:17020:20:21:63:517:552:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for producers to charge di-erent prices in di-erent markets: in equilibrium there would be no
8:218:17113:21:20:63:435:531:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:deviations from the law of one price even if national markets were segmented.
8:219:17190:20:20:80:517:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In model economies with PCP, optimal monetary policy rules tend to be `inward-looking' and
8:220:17280:20:21:63:517:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:`iso-morphic' to the rules derived in closed-economy models: welfare-maximizing central banks

8:224:17650:21:20:63:517:409:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:react to international variables | a result that in the baseline NOEM model after Corsetti and
8:225:17744:20:20:63:517:389:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Pesenti [2001] goes through under di-erent assumptions regarding nominal rigidities, including
8:226:17838:20:21:63:517:369:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:staggered price setting and partial adjustment (see, for example, Clarida, Gal-- and Gertler
8:227:17930:21:20:63:452:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:[2002], or Benigno and Benigno [2003] for a generalization of the baseline model).
8:228:18012:20:20:80:517:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The high elasticity of import prices to the exchange rate underlying the contributions after

8:230:18197:21:20:63:517:287:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:showing that the exchange rate pass-through on import prices is far from complete in the short
8:231:18291:20:20:63:517:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:run, and deviations from the law of one price are large and persistent (see, for example, Engel
8:232:18386:20:21:63:517:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and Rogers [1996]; Goldberg and Knetter [1997]; Campa and Goldberg [2005]). Based on this
8:233:18475:21:20:63:517:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:evidence, several contributions have engaged in a thorough critique of the received wisdom on
8:234:18568:20:20:63:517:206:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the expenditure switching e-ects of the exchange rate. Speci\fcally, Betts and Devereux [2000]
8:235:18662:20:21:63:517:186:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and Devereux and Engel [2003], among others, posit that \frms preset export prices in the

8:237:18842:20:20:63:517:145:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:currency pricing' (henceforth LCP), attributes local currency price stability of imports entirely
8:238:18939:20:21:63:517:125:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to nominal frictions. The far-reaching implications of LCP for the role of the exchange rate in
8:239:19034:21:0:63:517:104:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the international transmission mechanism have been widely discussed by the literature (see e.g.
9:240:19130:0:20:63:129:714:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Engel [2003]).
9:241:19144:20:20:80:517:694:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To the extent that import prices are sticky in the local currency, a Home depreciation does
9:242:19235:20:21:63:517:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:not a-ect the price of Home goods in the world markets; hence, it has no expenditure switching
9:243:19329:21:20:63:517:653:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:e-ects.  Instead, it raises the ex-post markups on Home exports:  at given marginal costs,
9:244:19419:20:20:63:517:633:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:revenues in domestic currency from selling goods abroad rise.  In contrast with the received
9:245:19511:20:21:63:517:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:wisdom, nominal depreciation strengthens a country's terms of trade: if export prices are preset
9:246:19607:21:20:63:485:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:during the period, the Home terms of trade improves when the Home currency weakens.

9:248:19781:20:21:63:517:552:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of policies with an `international dimension.' One way to present the argument is as follows.
9:249:19874:21:20:63:517:531:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:To the extent that exporters' revenues and markups are exposed to exchange rate uncertainty,

9:251:20064:20:21:63:517:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:benchmark model by Corsetti and Pesenti [2005], for instance, foreign \frms optimally preset the
9:252:20160:21:20:63:517:470:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:price of their goods in the Home market one period ahead, by charging the equilibrium markup
9:253:20252:20:20:63:517:450:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:over expected marginal costs evaluated in Home currency. The preset price of Home imports
9:254:20341:20:21:63:517:430:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:then depends on the joint distribution of Home monetary policy and Foreign productivity shocks:
9:255:20436:21:20:63:403:409:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the model, it is increasing in the variance of nominal marginal costs.

9:257:20594:20:21:63:517:369:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:breaks down is apparent. Suppose that the Home monetary authorities ignore the in\ruence of
9:258:20685:21:20:63:517:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:their decisions on the price of Home imports. Incomplete stabilization of Foreign \frms marginal
9:259:20781:20:20:63:517:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:costs and markup in local currency will translate into ine-ciently high local prices of their
9:260:20874:20:21:63:517:308:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:product (relative to their level in the \rexible-price allocation). On the other hand, if Home
9:261:20968:21:20:63:517:287:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:monetary authorities wanted to stabilize Foreign \frms' marginal costs, they could only do so
9:262:21061:20:20:63:517:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:at the cost of raising costs and markup uncertainty for Home producers, resulting in ine-cient
9:263:21155:20:21:63:517:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Home good prices.  It follows that, to maximize Home welfare, Home policymakers should

9:266:21427:20:21:63:517:186:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:depends, among other factors, on the degree of openness of the economy, as indexed by the
9:267:21516:21:20:63:517:165:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:overall share of imports in the CPI (see Corsetti and Pesenti [2005], and Sutherland [2005], for
9:268:21612:20:20:63:318:145:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a discussion of intermediate degrees of pass-through).
9:269:21666:20:21:80:517:125:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In section 7 of this paper we will show that these basic principles of the `international

10:271:21844:0:20:63:517:714:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:price adjustment. Namely, in our model monetary authorities will optimally attempt to stabilize
10:272:21939:20:20:63:517:694:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the CPI, although CPI stabilization will not be complete because of the asymmetry in shocks
10:273:22030:20:21:63:517:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:hitting di-erent economies and di-erent sectors of the same national economy, creating the need
10:274:22125:21:20:63:517:653:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for relative price adjustment. At an optimum, welfare-maximizing policymakers will thus trade-
10:275:22219:20:20:63:517:633:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:o- ine-cient misalignment of import prices, with ine-cient relative price dispersion among
10:276:22309:20:36:63:480:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:domestic and foreign goods (see also Smets and Wouters, [2002], and Monacelli [2005]).

10:279:22489:28:20:63:517:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:While most of the discussion in the NOEM literature has focused on incomplete pass-through as
10:280:22582:20:20:63:517:508:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:an implication of nominal rigidities, a low pass-through, in itself, is not necessarily incompatible
10:281:22682:20:21:63:517:488:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:with expenditure switching e-ects | a point stressed by Obstfeld [2000] among others.  In
10:282:22771:21:20:63:517:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:this respect, Obstfeld and Rogo- [2000] points out that, in the data (and consistent with the
10:283:22864:20:20:63:517:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:received wisdom), nominal depreciation does tend to be associated with deteriorating terms of
10:284:22957:20:21:63:517:427:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:trade. This piece of evidence clearly sets an empirical hurdle for LCP models: speci\fcations
10:285:23050:21:20:63:517:406:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:which assume a very high degree of price stickiness in local currency cannot pass this test (see
10:286:23146:20:20:63:517:386:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Corsetti, Dedola, and Leduc [2005], for a quantitative assessment).  Interestingly, estimates
10:287:23239:20:21:63:517:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of LCP models attributing incomplete pass-through exclusively to nominal rigidities in local
10:288:23331:21:20:63:517:345:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:currency, tend to predict that the degree of price stickiness is implausibly higher for imports
10:289:23426:20:20:63:517:325:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:than for domestic goods | a result suggesting model misspeci\fcation (see, for example, Lubik
10:290:23519:20:21:63:178:305:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and Schorfheide [2006]).
10:291:23543:21:20:80:517:284:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The key issue is the extent to which the evidence of local currency price stability of imports
10:292:23637:20:20:63:517:264:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:can be explained by nominal rigidities.  In the literature, it is well understood that the low
10:293:23731:20:21:63:517:244:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:elasticity of import prices at the retail level with respect to the exchange rate is in large part
10:294:23829:21:20:63:517:223:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:due to the incidence of distribution (see Burstein, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo [2006] for a recent
10:295:23923:20:20:63:517:203:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:reconsideration of this point). Namely suppose that import prices at the dock move one-to-one
10:296:24016:20:20:63:517:183:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:with the exchange rate, but the distribution margin account for 50 percent of the retail price,
10:297:24111:20:21:63:517:163:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:mostly covering local costs. A one percent depreciation of the currency will then a-ect the \fnal
10:298:24208:21:20:63:292:142:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:price of the imported good only by 1/2 percent.
10:299:24255:20:20:80:517:122:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In addition, several macro and micro contributions have emphasized that import prices at
10:300:24343:20:0:63:517:102:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the dock do not move one-to-one with the exchange rate because of optimal destination-speci\fc
11:301:24438:0:20:63:517:714:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:markup adjustment by monopolistic \frms. Instances of these studies include Dornbusch [1987],
11:302:24531:20:20:63:517:694:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:stressing market structure, as well as previous work by two of us (Corsetti and Dedola [2005]),
11:303:24626:20:21:63:517:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:where upstream monopolists sell their tradable goods to downstream \frms, which combine them
11:304:24718:21:20:63:517:653:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:with local inputs before reaching the consumer. The latter contribution establishes that, to the
11:305:24814:20:20:63:517:633:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:extent that the tradable goods and the local inputs are not good substitutes in the downstream
11:306:24908:20:21:63:517:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:\frms' production, the demand elasticity faced by upstream monopolists will be (a) market spe-
11:307:25002:21:20:63:517:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ci\fc, causing optimal price discrimination across markets, and (b) increasing in the monopolists
11:308:25099:20:20:63:517:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:price, thus leading to incomplete exchange rate pass-through independently of nominal rigidities.
11:309:25196:20:21:63:517:552:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Based on this principle, that paper then generalizes the model with distribution by Burstein,
11:310:25289:21:20:63:517:531:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Neves and Rebelo [2003], as to encompass local currency price stability due to endogenous move-
11:311:25384:20:20:63:517:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ments of markups implied by the presence of distribution services intensive in local inputs. The
11:312:25480:20:21:63:517:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:same principle nonetheless can be applied to models where intermediate imported inputs are
11:313:25570:21:20:63:517:470:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:assembled using local inputs | a case analyzed by Bacchetta and Van Wincoop 2003. Whether
11:314:25659:20:20:63:517:450:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:one has in mind markets with high distribution margins (such as the market for cups of co-ee
11:315:25751:20:21:63:517:430:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:at Starbucks in the US), or markets for goods with a relatively high incidence of imported parts
11:316:25847:21:20:63:517:409:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(such as the market for cars `made in the US'), incomplete exchange rate pass through can be
11:317:25939:20:20:63:517:389:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:traced back to some degree of complementarity between imported goods and local input/services.
11:318:26033:20:21:80:517:369:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Analyses of the relative importance of these di-erent sources of import price stability (espe-
11:319:26127:21:20:63:517:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cially local costs) are provided by several market-speci\fc studies | such as Goldberg and Ver-
11:320:26222:20:20:63:517:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:boven [2001], Goldberg and Hellerstein [2007], and Hellerstein [2006]. The main result emerging
11:321:26317:20:21:63:517:308:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:from these partial-equilibrium contributions is that real factors can explain a large extent of local
11:322:26418:21:20:63:517:287:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:currency price stability of imports. Most interestingly, similar conclusions can be reached using
11:323:26515:20:20:63:517:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:quantitative, general equilibrium models, as suggested by the numerical exercises in Corsetti
11:324:26608:20:21:63:152:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and Dedola [2005].
11:325:26626:21:20:80:517:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Yet, quantitative studies incorporating these factors also corroborate the idea that a realistic
11:326:26722:20:20:63:517:206:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:degree of nominal rigidities can improve substantially the performance of the model. In Corsetti,
11:327:26819:20:21:63:517:186:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Dedola, and Leduc [2005], we show that a model assuming LCP together with vertical interaction
11:328:26913:21:20:63:517:165:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:between producers and distributors can pass the empirical hurdle set by Obstfeld and Rogo-
11:329:27003:20:20:63:517:145:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:[2000], provided that the average frequency of price adjustment is consistent with the evidence
11:330:27098:20:21:63:194:125:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by Bils and Klenow (2004).
11:331:27124:21:0:80:517:104:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Research is therefore increasingly focused on the interaction between real and monetary

12:337:27671:20:21:63:517:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in domestic or in foreign currency, knowing that price updates will be subject to frictions. A

12:340:27956:20:21:63:173:552:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:[2006], for a synthesis).
12:341:27981:21:20:80:517:531:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Although most of these models are developed assuming an arbitrary monetary policy, the

12:345:28347:20:20:63:517:450:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:currency. Consider a \frm located in a country with noisy monetary policy, i.e. hit by frequent
12:346:28442:20:21:63:517:430:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:monetary shocks unrelated to fundamentals. For such \frm, pricing its exports in foreign cur-
12:347:28535:21:20:63:517:409:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rency (that is, choosing LCP) is attractive in the following sense: it ensures that revenues from
12:348:28632:20:20:63:517:389:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:exports in domestic currency will move in parallel with nominal marginal costs, with stabilizing
12:349:28728:20:21:63:517:369:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:e-ects on the markup. This is because any expansionary monetary shock depreciating the Home
12:350:28819:21:20:63:517:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:currency would simultaneously raise wages and the domestic currency revenue from unit sales
12:351:28910:20:20:63:517:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:abroad (at an unchanged local price). This observation may help explain why exporters from
12:352:29000:20:21:63:517:308:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:countries with relatively unstable domestic monetary policies (e.g. some developing countries)
12:353:29094:21:20:63:517:287:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:prefer to price their exports to developed countries in the importers' currency. The same argu-
12:354:29189:20:20:63:517:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ment, however, suggests that LCP is not necessarily optimal for exporters producing in countries
12:355:29285:20:21:63:517:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:where monetary policy systematically stabilizes marginal costs (see Goldberg and Tille [2005],
12:356:29379:21:20:63:517:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for empirical evidence). For \frms located in these countries, real factors arguably become more
12:357:29475:20:20:63:168:206:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:relevant in the choice.
12:358:29498:20:21:80:517:186:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:A second instance of the new directions taken by the literature consists of studies taking
12:359:29588:21:20:63:517:165:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the LCP choice as given, and combining it with di-erent determinants of pricing to market and
12:360:29681:20:20:63:517:145:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:incomplete pass-through. This is the approach we take in this paper. In contrast from previous
12:361:29775:20:21:63:517:125:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:contributions, where price stickiness is not linked to price discrimination (see e.g. Monacelli
12:362:29870:21:0:63:517:104:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:[2005]), or where nominal rigidities and price discrimination coexist without feeding into each
13:363:29967:0:20:63:517:714:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:other (see e.g.  Corsetti, Dedola, and Leduc [2005]), we specify a model building on the in-
13:364:30059:20:20:63:517:694:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tuitive idea that the frequency of price changes by local downstream \frms selling products
13:365:30150:20:21:63:517:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to consumers, is bound to a-ect the elasticity of demand perceived by upstream producers
13:366:30238:21:20:63:517:653:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of intermediate (tradable inputs or) goods. The novel result of our study is that, looking at
13:367:30331:20:20:63:517:633:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the interactions between nominal and real determinants of price discrimination in an otherwise
13:368:30425:20:21:63:517:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:standard monetary model, nominal rigidities at the retail level do not necessarily lower the
13:369:30517:21:20:63:517:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:equilibrium reaction of \fnal prices to exchange rate movements, thus increasing price inertia.
13:370:30612:20:20:63:517:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:As mentioned in the Introduction, downstream price rigidities tend to generate strategic substi-
13:371:30708:20:21:63:517:552:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tutability among upstream producers and an overall larger sensitivity of all prices to exchange

13:374:30836:31:21:63:516:457:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The world economy consists of two countries of equal size,HandF. Each country specializes
13:375:30925:21:20:63:517:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in one type of tradable good, produced in a number of di-erentiated industries de\fned over a
13:376:31018:20:20:63:517:416:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:continuum of unit mass. Tradable goods are indexed byh2[0;1] in the Home country and
13:377:31102:20:20:63:517:396:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f3:B:f2[0;1] in the Foreign country. In each industry, the \frm producing the tradable goodh(or
13:378:31192:20:21:63:517:376:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f3:B:f) is a monopolistic supplier of one good, using labor as the only input to production. These
13:379:31285:21:20:63:466:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:\frms set prices in local currency units and in a staggered fashion as in Calvo [1983].
13:380:31372:20:20:80:517:335:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:A distinctive feature of our setting is that we model a downstream sector in each country.
13:381:31462:20:21:63:516:315:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Speci\fcally, we assume that each producer's goodhis sold to consumers in many varieties by a
13:382:31555:21:20:63:517:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:continuum of local \frms indexed byrh2[0;1]:These \frms buy thehtradable goods, and turn
13:383:31643:20:20:63:517:274:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:them into consumer goods | which are not traded across borders | with random productivity.
13:384:31733:20:21:63:517:254:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We will distinguish between two cases: one in which local \frms use domestic labor as an input;
13:385:31828:21:20:63:517:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the other in which they do not. Similar to upstream producers, also downstream operate under
13:386:31920:20:20:63:452:213:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:monopolistic competition and set prices in a staggered fashion as in Calvo [1983].
13:387:32002:20:21:80:517:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:By the logic of the Calvo adjustment, local downstream \frms buying goods from upstream
13:388:32089:21:20:63:517:172:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:producers charge di-erent prices to \fnal users, with a constant fraction of them reoptimizing
13:389:32183:20:20:63:517:152:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:prices in each period. In principle, one could assume that upstream \frms exercise their monopoly
13:390:32280:20:21:63:517:132:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:power by charging individual prices which are speci\fc to each downstream \frm. However, we
13:391:32371:21:0:63:517:111:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:\fnd it more realistic and convincing to assume that upstream producers are not able to price-
14:392:32467:0:20:63:517:714:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:discriminate across individual local \frms, but only across groups of them | namely, across
14:393:32558:20:20:63:517:694:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:domestic and foreign local \frms. So, we assume that upstream producers exercise their monopoly
14:394:32653:20:21:63:517:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:power and set prices by taking into account the total demand for their product in each market,
14:395:32747:21:20:63:238:653:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:at Home and in the Foreign country.
14:396:32782:20:20:80:517:633:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In what follows, we describe our set up focusing on the Home country, with the understanding

15:513:36007:27:20:63:517:183:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:International price discrimination is a key feature of the international economy captured by
15:514:36099:20:21:63:517:163:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:our model. In what follows we show that, even if Home and Foreign consumers have identi-
15:515:36187:21:20:63:517:142:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cal constant-elasticity preferences for consumption, vertical interactions between upstream and
15:516:36282:20:20:63:517:122:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:downstream \frms causes di-erences in the elasticity of demand for theh(f) product at whole-
15:517:36374:20:0:63:517:102:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sale level across national markets. Upstream \frms will thus want to charge di-erent prices at
16:518:36470:0:20:63:517:714:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Home and in the Foreign country. We will focus our analysis on Home \frms | optimal pricing
16:519:36561:20:20:63:517:694:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by Foreign \frms can be easily derived from it. To distinguish between upstream and downstream
16:520:36655:20:21:63:408:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:\frms, we will denote variables referred to the former with an upper bar.
16:521:36728:21:20:80:517:653:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We begin by specifying the technology used by upstream \frms producing Home tradables.
16:522:36814:20:20:63:517:633:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:These \frms employ domestic labor to produce a di-erentiated producthaccording to the fol-

16:527:37130:20:21:63:517:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:be speci\fed below. The letterhwill be indi-erently referred to an upstream producer selling to

16:529:37277:20:20:80:516:485:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In each industryh, downstream \frmsrhcombine the traded input, bought from upstream
16:530:37360:20:21:63:517:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:producers, with some local nontraded input. For analytical convenience, in most of our analysis
16:531:37455:21:20:63:517:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:we do not model the local nontraded input explicitly, but posit that the production function of

16:537:37882:21:20:63:151:303:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:downstream \frms.
16:538:37899:20:20:80:517:283:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The use of the local input is consequential for our results, to the extent that it is a poor

16:540:38082:21:20:63:517:242:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:2005 and in Corsetti, Dedola and Leduc 2005), in which we have assumed that downstream \frms

17:547:38526:0:20:80:517:714:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In our previous contributions, we have shown that the above speci\fcation can generate

17:550:38794:21:20:63:517:653:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:point. Namely, we show that vertical interactions among upstream and downstream \frms can
17:551:38883:20:20:63:517:633:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:lead to price discriminationexclusivelyas a consequence of nominal rigidities. To focus sharply
17:552:38978:20:21:63:517:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on the mechanism underlying this new result, throughout our analysis we specify the produc-
17:553:39069:21:20:63:517:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tion function of downstream \frms as in (4), abstracting from the local nontraded input. For
17:554:39161:20:20:63:517:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the sake of comparison, however, in the next sections we will also show analytical results for the
17:555:39259:20:36:63:178:552:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:production function (5).
17:556:39283:36:28:63:294:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:3.3  The problem of downstream \frms
17:557:39319:28:20:63:517:488:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Both upstream and downstream \frms are subject to nominal rigidities -a la Calvo. Hence, at
17:558:39410:20:20:63:517:468:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:any timetdownstream \frms will buy either from a producerhwhich updates its price in the
17:559:39498:20:21:63:517:448:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:same period, or from a producer still charging an old price. Conversely, in each period, upstream
17:560:39595:21:20:63:517:427:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:producers updating their price will need to consider that only a fraction of downstream \frms
17:561:39688:20:20:63:517:407:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:buying their products will also re-optimize in the period.  In characterizing optimal pricing
17:562:39781:20:21:63:517:387:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:decisions, it is instructive to go over these cases one by one. Let-be the probability that a

24:1082:50795:20:21:63:517:454:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:level are captured by the negative term inside the brackets. An important and novel result is
24:1083:50888:21:20:63:517:433:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that the demand price elasticity perceived by upstream \frms under sticky prices is time-varying
24:1084:50984:20:20:63:516:413:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and, up to \frst order9a decreasing function of the cumulated rate of in\ration at the consumer

24:1088:51099:0:21:130:516:393:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:. Namely, with positive in\ration, such elasticity will be lower than with \rexible
24:1089:51182:21:20:63:516:372:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:prices (in which case it is constant and equal to-). Any change in the consumer prices within

24:1091:51367:20:21:63:517:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in response to price changes by the upstream \frms | modi\fes the elasticity of the demand
24:1092:51457:21:20:63:517:311:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:faced by upstream producers in the same industry. A notable implication is that di-erences in
24:1093:51550:20:20:63:517:291:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:national in\ration rates will induce di-erences in demand price elasticities for a product, creating
24:1094:51650:20:21:63:352:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:an incentive for producers to price-to-market across borders.
24:1095:51711:21:20:80:517:250:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To provide an intuitive account of these results, observe that, from the vantage point of an
24:1096:51803:20:20:63:517:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:upstream producer of tradablesh, the marginal revenue from a price change re\rects the fact that
24:1097:51899:20:21:63:517:210:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:only some downstream \frms update their prices in any given period. Speci\fcally, the upstream
24:1098:51993:21:20:63:516:189:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:monopolist does not know which individual \frmrhwill be updating its price in the period, but
24:1099:52086:20:20:63:517:169:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:knows that a fraction 1--of them will do so, while a fraction-will keep their price unchanged.
24:1100:52180:20:21:63:517:149:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Because of the latter, the upstream producers will optimally respond to shocks to own marginal
24:1101:52274:21:20:63:517:128:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:costs by charging a price which is higher than she/he would ideally charge if all downstream
24:1102:52366:20:0:75:517:108:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:9We show below that up to \frst order price dispersionSt(h) is equal to 1 around a zero in\ration steady state.
25:1103:52479:0:20:63:183:714:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:producers set new prices.
25:1104:52504:20:20:80:516:694:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:This leads tostrategic substitutabilityamong producers: namely, a rise in their marginal
25:1105:52592:20:21:63:517:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:costs will lead to an increase in the desired markups by producers. Strategic substitutability in
25:1106:52689:21:20:63:517:653:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:our model is important because it implies that producer prices will be more reactive to shocks
25:1107:52783:20:20:63:517:633:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to their demand conditions and to marginal costs: when vertical interactions among \frms with
25:1108:52876:20:21:63:517:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sticky prices are considered, it may not be necessarily the case that several layers of nominal
25:1109:52971:21:20:63:273:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rigidities bring about more inertia in prices.
25:1110:53017:20:20:80:517:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:It is worth stressing that, if monetary policy stabilized consumer prices completely, removing
25:1111:53111:20:21:63:516:552:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:any within-industry price dispersion for each goodh, such policy would make the producer's
25:1112:53201:21:20:63:517:531:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:demand elasticity and thus its desired markup constant. To wit: in this case, the producer's
25:1113:53293:20:0:63:250:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f8:B:demand elasticity would be given by-

25:1117:53337:9:20:303:517:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:. Through price stabilization, monetary au-
25:1118:53380:20:21:63:517:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:thorities would therefore eliminate the incentive to price discriminate. However, observe that
25:1119:53474:21:20:63:517:470:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the elimination of consumer price variability (and consumer price dispersion) would not make

25:1121:53656:20:0:63:360:430:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of upstream \frms would still be a function of-, and equal to

27:1273:56252:20:20:63:517:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:movements are passed through into local prices according to our analysis. On the one hand,
27:1274:56342:20:21:63:517:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:upstream nominal rigidities (- >0) tend to lower short-run pass-through  irrespective of ver-
27:1275:56435:21:20:63:516:557:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tical interactions. But, as we noted above, downstream nominal rigidities (- >0) lower the
27:1276:56525:20:20:63:517:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:denominator in the above expression below 1 | because of strategic substitutability. Thus, the

27:1279:56810:20:20:63:516:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:For instance, if upstream prices were fully \rexible | corresponding to-= 0 | the structural

32:1643:64985:20:20:63:517:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:chose-so that the trade elasticity is 1.5. As regards the weights of domestic and foreign trad-

32:1646:65259:20:20:63:516:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the U.S. in the last 30 years. We pick the steady state value ofZto ensure that the price of
32:1647:65351:20:21:63:517:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:traded goods accounts for 50 percent of the \fnal price in steady state. This value corresponds
32:1648:65446:21:20:63:517:470:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to the empirical estimates by Burstein, Neves and Rebelo [2003], for the distribution margin

32:1650:65634:20:21:63:360:430:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:suggesting that the value we select is on the conservative side.
32:1651:65698:21:20:80:517:409:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:As benchmark, we set the probability that upstream and downstream \frms update their

32:1663:66381:20:21:63:517:163:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:we assume a symmetric economic structure across countries, we also impose symmetry on the

32:1665:66568:20:20:63:517:122:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:data on productivity, we posit that sectoral shocks follow a rather conventional process. First,
32:1666:66664:20:0:63:517:102:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in line with most of the international business cycle literature | e.g., BKK | we assume that
33:1667:66759:0:20:63:517:714:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:these shocks are very persistent, and set their autocorrelation to 0.95. Second, the standard
33:1668:66852:20:20:63:517:694:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:deviation of the innovations is set to 0.007. For simplicity, we set the shock correlation and the
33:1669:66950:20:37:63:282:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:spillovers across countries and sectors to zero.

33:1671:67018:27:20:63:517:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:To characterize the optimal monetary policy, we let the planner choose the growth rates of money
33:1672:67114:20:21:63:517:590:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the Home and Foreign economies, to maximize the world welfare subject to the \frst-order
33:1673:67205:21:20:63:517:569:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:conditions for households and \frms and the economy-wide resource constraints. We assume that
33:1674:67298:20:20:63:517:549:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the planner places equal weights on Home and Foreign welfare, so that world welfare is given by

33:1681:67526:21:20:63:517:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:an approach similar to that in Khan, King, and Wolman [2003] and consider an optimal policy
33:1682:67617:20:20:63:517:441:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that has been in place for a long enough time that initial conditions do not matter. When solving
33:1683:67714:20:21:63:517:421:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:our economies, we assume the presence of \fscal subsidies, \fnanced via lump-sum taxation, to
33:1684:67807:21:20:63:427:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ensure that all prices would equal marginal costs if prices were fully \rexible.
33:1685:67887:20:20:80:517:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In describing our results, we also compare the optimal policy to other well-known policy
33:1686:67975:20:21:63:517:360:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rules. We \frst consider a Taylor-type rule that sets the short-term nominal interest rate as a

33:1689:68198:31:21:63:517:277:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We conventionally parameterize the policy rule using the estimates in Lubik and Schorfheide

33:1693:68525:16:20:72:517:200:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:14Our price index of Home intermediates is a CES function of the price of Home intermediates in the Home
33:1694:68629:20:17:63:517:180:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:market and the price of Home intermediates sold abroad (expressed in Home currency). We set the weights over
33:1695:68737:17:0:63:233:163:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:those prices to be the same as in the CPI.

34:1697:68839:31:20:63:517:683:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In this section, we use our quantitative framework to discuss key properties of our model re-

34:1699:69026:21:20:63:517:642:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:show the impulse responses of prices, markups and in\ration | all in percentage deviations from
34:1700:69121:20:20:63:517:622:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:their steady state values | to productivity shocks, distinguishing between the intermediate and
34:1701:69216:20:21:63:517:602:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:\fnal production sectors. Throughout these exercises we assume that central banks in the two
34:1702:69308:21:20:63:517:581:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:countries set monetary policy to implement a strict CPI in\ration targeting. Similar results can
34:1703:69404:20:20:63:517:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:however be obtained assuming that central banks implement the optimal policy, discussed in

34:1705:69511:36:28:63:312:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:6.1  Technology shocks to upstream \frms
34:1706:69551:28:20:63:517:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Figure 1 focuses on the e-ects of an unexpected and persistent productivity increase in the Home
34:1707:69647:20:20:63:517:457:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tradable goods sector. Consistent with strict in\ration targeting, the monetary authorities react
34:1708:69744:20:21:63:517:437:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to the shock by expanding the country's monetary stance in line with productivity, causing a
34:1709:69836:21:20:63:517:416:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:depreciation of the nominal exchange rate | given CPI in\ration targeting, the nominal and real
34:1710:69931:20:20:63:454:396:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:exchange rate move together (see the graph in the lower right corner of Figure 1).
34:1711:70013:20:21:80:517:376:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:As shown by Figure 1, upstream producers that update their prices lower them both in the
34:1712:70101:21:20:63:517:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:domestic and the foreign market (see the \frst chart on the upper left corner of the \fgure). The
34:1713:70198:20:20:63:517:335:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:fall in the home good price is however larger abroad than in the domestic market, in violation
34:1714:70292:20:21:63:517:315:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the law of one price. In the graph, a positive deviation from the law of one price means that
34:1715:70388:21:20:63:281:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:domestic prices are larger than foreign prices.
34:1716:70435:20:20:80:517:274:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The behavior of prices is mirrored by the response of the desired and actual markups of the
34:1717:70526:20:21:63:517:254:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:upstream Home producers, shown by the fourth and \ffth graphs of Figure 1. As discussed in
34:1718:70616:21:20:63:517:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Section 4, downstream nominal rigidities lead to pricing substitutability at the level of upstream
34:1719:70714:20:20:63:517:213:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:producers. As a result, thedesired markupby these producers fall with their prices in either
34:1720:70806:20:21:63:517:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:market, but relatively more in the Foreign one.15Nonetheless, since prices are sticky in local
34:1721:70900:21:20:63:517:172:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:currency, the nominal depreciation of the Home exchange rate raises export revenues in the
34:1722:70990:20:16:63:420:152:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:exporters' own currency: theaverage markupin the country actually rises.
34:1723:71062:16:20:72:517:136:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:15Recall that we also show that this result is attenuated when the production function include local labor input,
34:1724:71175:20:0:63:365:116:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:with a low degree of substitutability with the intermediate tradable goods.
35:1725:71252:0:20:80:517:714:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The impact of the same shock onconsumer pricesclearly di-ers, depending on whether the
35:1726:71338:20:20:63:517:694:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:upstream monopolist in a particular industryhupdates its price, or leaves it unchanged. In
35:1727:71428:20:21:63:517:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the former case (shown in the second graph of Figure 1), downstream \frms face a drop in their
35:1728:71522:21:20:63:517:653:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:marginal costs. Hence, those \frms which can reset prices will lower them, both domestically
35:1729:71614:20:20:63:517:633:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and abroad. As we have seen previously, the intermediate good price falls more in the Foreign
35:1730:71707:20:21:63:517:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:country. Thus, Foreign downstream \frms decrease their price by more than the domestic ones,
35:1731:71799:21:20:63:517:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:so that deviations from the law of one price have the same sign at both consumer prices' and
35:1732:71891:20:20:63:167:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:producer prices' level.
35:1733:71914:20:21:80:517:552:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Interestingly, our results show that consumer prices fall also in industries in which the up-
35:1734:72007:21:20:63:517:531:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:stream producersdo notupdate their prices during the period | albeit by a smaller amount
35:1735:72095:20:20:63:517:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:than in the other case (see the third graph of Figure 1).  This is so for two reasons.  First,
35:1736:72189:20:21:63:517:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:although marginal costs of downstream \frms in these industry do not fall in the period, these
35:1737:72283:21:20:63:517:470:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:\frms nonetheless take into account that the productivity shock is persistent: they thus antici-
35:1738:72379:20:20:63:517:450:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:pate that their marginal costs are likely to decrease in the future. Second, a lower price helps
35:1739:72475:20:21:63:517:430:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:these \frms respond to increasing competition by \frms operating in the other industries, where
35:1740:72570:21:20:63:343:409:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the price of intermediate product have already gone down.
35:1741:72627:20:20:80:517:389:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In these industries, the deviations from the law of one price are larger, but of the opposite
35:1742:72720:20:21:63:517:369:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sign, relative to the industries in which the upstream price is updated. This is because, for a
35:1743:72815:21:20:63:517:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:constant upstream price, consumer prices decrease on impact by more at Home than abroad.
35:1744:72903:20:20:63:517:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:To wit: in the \frst period, the sign of the deviations from the law of one price is positive in the
35:1745:73003:20:36:63:320:308:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:second graph, negative in the third graph of Figure 1.
35:1746:73057:36:28:63:328:272:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:6.2  Technology shocks to downstream \frms
35:1747:73099:28:20:63:517:244:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Figure 2 displays the responses to an unexpected persistent increase in the productivity of Home
35:1748:73195:20:20:63:517:224:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:downstream \frms. As in the previous case, under the assumed strict CPI in\ration targeting the
35:1749:73290:20:21:63:517:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Home monetary authorities react with an expansion, which leads to nominal and real deprecia-
35:1750:73382:21:20:63:326:183:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tion of the Home currency (see last graph of Figure 2).
35:1751:73437:20:20:80:517:163:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Recall that downstream technology shocks are also country-speci\fc: they lower the marginal
35:1752:73528:20:21:63:517:143:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:costs of downstream \frms at Home, but do not a-ect the costs of downstream \frms in the
35:1753:73616:21:20:63:517:122:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:industry located in the Foreign country. So, in all industries in which the upstream producers
35:1754:73710:20:0:63:517:102:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:do not update their current price within the period, domestic downstream \frms updating their
36:1755:73805:0:20:63:517:714:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:prices will optimally lower them, while downstream \frms abroad will keep their prices virtually
36:1756:73901:20:20:63:517:694:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:unchanged. This is at the root of the deviations from the law of one price shown in the third
36:1757:73994:20:21:63:517:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:graph of Figure 2, which are further magni\fed by the fact that monetary authorities react to
36:1758:74087:21:20:63:322:653:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the shock by engineering Home currency depreciation.
36:1759:74139:20:20:80:517:633:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:More complex is the case of industries in which upstream producers change their prices (sec-
36:1760:74231:20:21:63:517:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ond graph in the Figure), since the overall e-ects of the shock will depend on a number of general
36:1761:74329:21:20:63:517:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:equilibrium e-ects. Key to understanding these e-ects is the fact that higher productivity by
36:1762:74422:20:20:63:517:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:downstream \frms causes an increase in their output, and thus in real domestic consumption.
36:1763:74513:20:21:63:517:552:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In our model speci\fcation, the increase in downstream output does not a-ect the labor market
36:1764:74606:21:20:63:517:531:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and thus the real wage directly | under the linear production function speci\fed above, a higher
36:1765:74702:20:20:63:517:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:downstream output has no direct impact on the demand for labor, since these \frms are assumed
36:1766:74795:20:21:63:517:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:not to employ any labor input. However, it does so indirectly: higher domestic consumption is
36:1767:74888:21:20:63:517:470:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:associated with a positive income e-ect, which reduces labor supply and ultimately translates
36:1768:74981:20:20:63:517:450:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:into a downward shift in hours worked. Given that at the same time the demand for intermediate
36:1769:75075:20:21:63:517:430:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:products is increasing, the labor market tightens, causing a rise in real wages. Facing higher
36:1770:75169:21:20:63:517:409:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:labor costs, upstream \frms which can reoptimize their prices raise them, thus increasing the
36:1771:75262:20:20:63:517:389:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:marginal costs of downstream \frms. Somewhat surprisingly, as shown in the second graph of
36:1772:75352:20:21:63:347:369:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Figure 2, the feedback e-ect on consumer prices is positive.
36:1773:75412:21:20:80:517:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:This transmission mechanism was discussed early on by Friedman, in his celebrated critical
36:1774:75502:20:20:63:517:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:analysis of cost-push in\ration (see e.g. Nelson [2007] and references within). In the industries
36:1775:75599:20:21:63:517:308:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:where upstream producers adjust their prices, they raise them in response to higher costs in
36:1776:75691:21:20:63:517:287:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the form of higher nominal wages. Yet, one key factor raising wages is the demand expansion
36:1777:75782:20:20:63:517:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:engineered by monetary policy makers in response to productivity improvement at retail level.
36:1778:75875:20:21:63:517:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Changes in prices which appear to be motivated by costs consideration, are actually the result
36:1779:75969:21:20:63:517:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of a demand stimulus, working its way up through the vertical links between downstream and
36:1780:76059:20:20:63:517:206:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:upstream producers, and ultimately raising the price of scarse production inputs supplied in
36:1781:76151:20:21:63:163:186:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:competitive markets.
36:1782:76171:21:20:80:517:165:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Observe that domestic upstream producers slightly lower their wholesale prices in foreign
36:1783:76260:20:20:63:517:145:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:currency.  Nonetheless, because of currency depreciation, these prices in Home currency are
36:1784:76351:20:21:63:517:125:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:higher than the ones charged in the domestic market, again in violation of the law of one price.
36:1785:76447:21:0:63:517:104:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Consistently, the desired markup of Home producers increases in the Home market, while falls
37:1786:76541:0:20:63:517:714:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:abroad | in line with the change in prices. The average markup nonetheless falls everywhere
37:1787:76632:20:43:63:288:694:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the economy, per e-ect of nominal rigidities.

37:1789:76739:32:20:63:517:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:This section is devoted to the analysis of stabilization policies under the assumption of coopera-
37:1790:76837:20:20:63:517:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tion between the Home and Foreign monetary authorities and full commitment. In order to shed
37:1791:76929:20:21:63:517:579:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:light on how policy works in our model, we \fnd it useful to discuss the problem of stabilizing
37:1792:77024:21:20:63:517:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:economies hit by shocks to upstream or downstream shocks in isolation, and then proceed to
37:1793:77114:20:20:63:517:538:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:present results for our complete baseline calibration. Thus, results are shown in 3 tables. For a
37:1794:77211:20:21:63:517:518:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:set of macrovariables, Table 1 and 2 report volatilities conditional on shocks to upstream and
37:1795:77305:21:20:63:517:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:downstream productivity, respectively; Table 3 report results when both shocks are considered.
37:1796:77399:20:20:63:517:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In each table, the \frst column shows result for the \rexible price benchmark, in which monetary
37:1797:77495:20:21:63:517:457:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:policy targets a zero rate of CPI in\ration at all times; the other columns refer to economies

37:1799:77681:20:20:63:517:416:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the optimal cooperative policy, including a case in which there is no home bias in consumption
37:1800:77775:20:20:63:517:396:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:expenditure (i.e.aH=aF= 1=2). Table 3, instead, includes the alternative monetary policies
37:1801:77865:20:21:63:517:376:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:speci\fed in Section 5 | CPI in\ration targeting, GDP in\ration targeting, and the Taylor-type
37:1802:77959:21:20:63:517:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rule. As we assume subsidies that exactly o-set steady-state markups, under the optimal policy
37:1803:78053:20:20:63:517:335:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:long-run in\ration is zero. To facilitate comparison across experiments, we also posit that steady
37:1804:78151:20:37:63:418:315:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:state in\ration is nil when solving the model under the alternative policies.
37:1805:78228:37:27:63:223:278:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:7.1  Upstream shocks only
37:1806:78253:27:20:63:517:251:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Starting from the simplest case, consider \frst the problem of stabilizing technology shocks to
37:1807:78348:20:21:63:517:231:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:upstream production only. As an important benchmark, we \frst establish that, if our Home
37:1808:78437:21:20:63:517:210:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:country were a closed economy, monetary authorities would be able to stabilize completely
37:1809:78526:20:20:63:517:190:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:upstream marginal costs, and therefore upstream prices, preventing any dispersion in the prices
37:1810:78621:20:21:63:517:170:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:charged by adjusting and not-adjusting \frms. Monetary authorities can do so by matching any
37:1811:78713:21:20:63:517:149:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:change in upstream marginal costs driven by productivity, with a change in the monetary stance
37:1812:78807:20:20:63:517:129:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the opposite direction, which ultimately moves nominal wages in tandem with productivity.
37:1813:78899:20:0:63:517:109:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The speci\fc reason why such a policy would stabilize all sticky prices (at both producer and
38:1814:78994:0:20:63:517:714:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consumer level) is that, in our speci\fcation, \ructuations in nominal wages are not consequential
38:1815:79092:20:20:63:517:694:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for downstream \frms, by virtue of our assumption that these \frms employ no labor resources in
38:1816:79187:20:21:63:517:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:producing \fnal goods. So, downstream marginal costs only change with the intermediate goods'
38:1817:79280:21:20:63:517:653:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:prices, or with downstream productivity: without shocks to the latter, once upstream prices are
38:1818:79375:20:20:63:517:633:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:constant in equilibrium, so are downstream prices. Similarly to the standard closed-economy
38:1819:79466:20:21:63:517:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:monetary model, the policy just described would replicate the allocation under \rexible prices
38:1820:79560:21:20:63:517:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:| this policy is optimal in our environment since we assume that steady-state monopolistic
38:1821:79650:20:20:63:370:572:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:distortions in production are corrected with \fscal instruments.16
38:1822:79716:20:21:80:517:552:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The optimality of complete price stabilization, however, does not carry over to an open
38:1823:79803:21:20:63:517:531:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:economy setting, as shown in Table 1. With an optimal monetary policy in place (second column
38:1824:79896:20:20:63:517:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the table), the variability of the CPI is close to, but not zero | domestic and imported goods
38:1825:79993:20:21:63:517:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:prices are actually much more variable than the CPI. Observe that prices and markups in both
38:1826:80085:21:20:63:517:470:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:countries \ructuate much less for domestic goods than for imported goods. This corresponds to
38:1827:80178:20:20:63:517:450:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the fact that monetary policymakers concentrate their e-orts to reduce the volatility of markups
38:1828:80274:20:21:63:517:430:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of domestic producers selling in the domestic markets. The reason has already been laid out in
38:1829:80368:21:20:63:517:409:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Section 2.1, but is worth reconsidering here in the framework of our model with staggered price
38:1830:80463:20:20:63:98:389:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:setting.
38:1831:80471:20:21:80:517:369:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:By mirroring the logic of Corsetti and Pesenti [2005], assume an equilibrium where there is
38:1832:80562:21:20:63:517:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:no price dispersion in either domestic market for domestically produced goods: the monetary
38:1833:80653:20:20:63:517:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:authority completely stabilizes the marginal costs ofupstream\frms, once again matching any
38:1834:80744:20:21:63:517:308:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:increase in productivity with an appropriate expansion in the Home monetary stance. While do-
38:1835:80837:21:16:63:517:287:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:mestic goods prices remain constant and identical to each other, at both intermediate and \fnal
38:1836:80932:16:20:72:517:271:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:16It is worth stressing that, had we assumed that downstream \frms use labor, complete stability of upstream
38:1837:81040:20:16:63:517:251:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:prices would be incompatible with complete stability of downstream prices. Even if prices of intermediate goods
38:1838:81151:16:17:63:517:235:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:were held constant, movements in nominal wages in response to endogenous monetary policy changes would ad-
38:1839:81257:17:16:63:517:218:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:ditionally a-ect marginal costs of \fnal good producers, creating an immediate incentive for these to reset prices
38:1840:81371:16:17:63:517:202:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:when possible, thus generating price variability at the retail level. As a result, relative to our baseline model spec-
38:1841:81490:17:16:63:517:185:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:i\fcation, introducing a labor input in \fnal good production implies that welfare maximizing monetary authorities
38:1842:81604:16:16:63:517:169:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:would face a trade-o- between stabilization of upstream marginal costs, and downstream price dispersion. They
38:1843:81713:16:17:63:517:153:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:would therefore tend to react by less to upstream productivity shocks, with the objective of containing price
38:1844:81822:17:16:63:517:136:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:dispersion at consumer level. As should become clear in the rest of the text, abstracting from labor inputs in
38:1845:81932:16:17:63:517:120:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:downstream production is helpful in focusing most sharply on the policy trade-o-s arising speci\fcally from vertical
38:1846:82048:17:0:63:281:103:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:interactions between downstream and upstream \frms.
39:1847:82101:0:20:63:517:714:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:level, any monetary decision a-ecting the nominal exchange rate would create both a misalign-
39:1848:82194:20:20:63:517:694:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ment of the relative price between domestic and foreign goods, and import price dispersion at
39:1849:82287:20:21:63:516:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consumer level (since a fraction-of Foreign producers would react to, e.g., Home depreciation,
39:1850:82381:21:20:63:412:653:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by ine-ciently raising the price they charge to Home downstream \frms).
39:1851:82452:20:20:80:517:633:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:At the margin, depending on the degree of openness of the economy, it would be optimal
39:1852:82538:20:21:63:517:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to move away from such outcome.  Speci\fcally, it is e-cient to stabilize the marginal costs
39:1853:82630:21:20:63:517:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of domestic intermediate producers by less, as to stabilize somewhat marginal costs and thus
39:1854:82722:20:20:63:517:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:reduce the incentive to move prices in the import sector. Monetary authorities can raise welfare
39:1855:82818:20:21:63:517:552:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by trading-o- lower import price dispersion and misalignment at the consumer level, against
39:1856:82909:21:20:63:365:531:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:some price dispersion in the Home markets for domestic goods.
39:1857:82970:20:20:80:517:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We observe here that optimal Foreign monetary policy would mimic Home monetary policy
39:1858:83055:20:21:63:517:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in response to Home shocks, for essentially the same reason.  For a given Foreign monetary
39:1859:83145:21:20:63:517:470:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:policy, a Home currency depreciation generates price variability in local currency of Foreign
39:1860:83238:20:20:63:517:450:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:imports from Home, as Home exporters updating their price will lower them. An expansion
39:1861:83325:20:21:63:517:430:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:allows the Foreign monetary authorities to contain the variability of import prices, as well as
39:1862:83420:21:20:63:517:409:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:their misalignment relative to the domestic goods prices, at the cost of some price dispersion in
39:1863:83517:20:20:63:517:389:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the domestic market for domestic goods. This is exactly what underlies our numerical results
39:1864:83609:20:21:63:114:369:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in Table 1.
39:1865:83620:21:20:80:517:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:As is well understood in the literature, with LCP, endogenous changes in monetary stance
39:1866:83708:20:20:63:517:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:across countries tend to be positively correlated. In the limiting case in which there is no home
39:1867:83805:20:21:63:517:308:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:bias in consumption (the case reported in the third column in Table 1), domestic and foreign
39:1868:83897:21:20:63:517:287:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:goods in the Home and the Foreign consumer price indexes have exactly the same weights.
39:1869:83984:20:20:63:517:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:This implies that, in response to disturbances to upstream productivity, national monetary
39:1870:84074:20:21:63:517:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:policy stances react to the same weighted average of shocks, becoming perfectly correlated in
39:1871:84167:21:20:63:517:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the optimum. As a result, the nominal exchange rate does not respond to shocks (in the third
39:1872:84259:20:20:63:517:206:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:column of Table 1, the volatility of the real exchange rate is 0), even if shocks are country-speci\fc
39:1873:84361:20:21:63:517:186:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and uncorrelated | a \fnding discussed at length by the literature surveyed in Section 2. What
39:1874:84455:21:20:63:517:165:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:induces optimal exchange rate variability under cooperation is home bias in consumption, which
39:1875:84549:20:20:63:517:145:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:obviously raises the importance of stabilizing the marginal costs of domestic producers relative
39:1876:84645:20:21:63:517:125:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to those of the importers (the case shown in the second column in Table 1). In this respect, our
39:1877:84741:21:0:63:517:104:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:results generalize the point discussed by Corsetti [2006] to an environment with staggered price
40:1878:84839:0:20:63:119:714:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:adjustment.
40:1879:84850:20:20:80:517:694:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:By comparing the \frst and the second column of Table 1, it is apparent that the positive co-
40:1880:84943:20:21:63:517:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f7:B:movements in optimal national monetary policies induced by LCP distortions curb thevolatility
40:1881:85036:21:20:63:516:653:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the terms of trade,relative to the case of \rexible prices. With LCP, nominal exchange rate
40:1882:85130:20:20:63:517:633:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:movements do not help correct international relative prices. The only way in which a nominal
40:1883:85222:20:21:63:517:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:expansion cum exchange rate depreciation can reduce the price of domestic goods sold abroad
40:1884:85313:21:20:63:517:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is via price adjustment in foreign currency, but by the Calvo mechanism only a subset of \frms
40:1885:85407:20:20:63:517:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:can reduce their prices. For all the other \frms, the terms of trade actually move in the direction
40:1886:85506:20:21:63:517:552:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of an appreciation.  In other words, while exchange rate movements induced by a monetary
40:1887:85594:21:20:63:517:531:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:expansion have nothing to do with expenditure switching e-ects, a fall in the relative price of
40:1888:85689:20:20:63:517:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:imports can only materialize at the cost of import price dispersion.  This is why, depending
40:1889:85781:20:21:63:517:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on the relative weight of domestic and imported goods in the CPI, optimal stabilization policy
40:1890:85875:21:20:63:445:470:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tends to contain international relative prices and thus terms of trade variability.
40:1891:85958:20:20:80:517:450:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:However, observe that in our results the volatility of the real exchange rate, like that of
40:1892:86049:20:21:63:517:430:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:consumption and hours worked, is higher with nominal rigidities (under the optimal policy),
40:1893:86140:21:20:63:517:409:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:than with \rexible prices | the opposite of our results on the terms of trade. We will return on
40:1894:86236:20:36:63:195:389:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:this important point below.
40:1895:86263:36:28:63:239:353:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:7.2  Downstream shocks only
40:1896:86290:28:20:63:517:325:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Shocks hitting \fnal good producers substantially modify the monetary policy problem, in at least
40:1897:86387:20:20:63:517:305:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:two respects. First, in our baseline speci\fcation without labor input in downstream production,
40:1898:86483:20:21:63:517:285:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:monetary authorities would never be able to achieve complete stability of \fnal prices, not even
40:1899:86579:21:20:63:517:264:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in a closed-economy environment. In other words, these shocks create policy trade-o-s among
40:1900:86670:20:20:63:517:244:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:competing objective independently of openness. The problem is that complete price stability
40:1901:86761:20:20:63:517:224:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:at consumer level requires monetary policy to respond to technology shocks downstream. Since
40:1902:86853:20:21:63:517:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the resulting \ructuations in wages (see Section 6.2) induce (ine-cient) price dispersion among
40:1903:86948:21:20:63:517:183:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:upstream \frms, it follows that \fnal producers will face di-erent costs of their intermediate input,
40:1904:87049:20:20:63:517:163:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:depending on which industry they operate in. In this sense, vertical interactions in our model
40:1905:87143:20:21:63:517:143:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:bring about an important dimension of heterogeneity across \frms which should be appropriately
40:1906:87237:21:20:63:517:122:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:emphasized. Di-erently from standard sticky price models, the marginal costs of our downstream
40:1907:87331:20:0:63:517:102:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:\frms are generally not symmetric, not even when the economy is completely closed to foreign
41:1908:87425:0:20:63:416:714:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:trade, and there are no markup shocks, due e.g. to stochastic preferences.
41:1909:87499:20:20:80:517:694:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Second, since \fnal producers di-erentiate locally the products they bring to consumers,
41:1910:87587:20:21:63:517:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:downstream shocks add an important element of nontradability to consumer goods.  Hence,
41:1911:87674:21:20:63:517:653:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:even when consumer expenditure is not biased towards domestic goods, consumption baskets
41:1912:87762:20:20:63:516:633:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f16:B:would still be e-ectively di-erent across countries. When the expenditure weightsaHandaF
41:1913:87850:20:21:63:517:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are identical | a case of no home bias in terms of upstream products | monetary authorities
41:1914:87941:21:20:63:517:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:would e-ciently provide the same degree of stabilization across all categories of domestic and
41:1915:88035:20:20:63:517:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:imported goods. Yet, in contrast to the case of upstream disturbances only, the optimal monetary
41:1916:88131:20:21:63:517:552:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:stance will be su-ciently di-erent across countries as to induce nominal and real exchange
41:1917:88221:21:20:63:517:531:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rate \ructuations in response to country-speci\fc shocks at downstream level. This result is a
41:1918:88315:20:20:63:517:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:generalization of Duarte and Obstfeld [2007], who also stress nontradability as a reason for
41:1919:88407:20:21:63:517:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:nominal exchange rate \rexibility. However, they include nontradables as a separate sector in
41:1920:88500:21:20:63:517:470:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the economy (as they abstract from vertical interactions), and focus on the case of one period
41:1921:88594:20:20:63:373:450:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:preset prices (hence abstract from forward looking price setting).
41:1922:88660:20:21:80:517:430:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The above discussion is clearly re\rected in the results in Table 2. When we focus on down-
41:1923:88751:21:20:63:517:409:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:stream shocks only, the variability of CPI in\ration is not zero, and remains remarkably stable
41:1924:88846:20:20:63:517:389:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for di-erent degrees of home bias in consumption. What instead varies considerably with the
41:1925:88937:20:21:63:517:369:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:degree of home bias is the variability of markups across sectors, since home bias shifts the weight
41:1926:89036:21:20:63:517:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of monetary stabilization away from imported goods. Precisely, observe that in the third col-
41:1927:89129:20:20:63:517:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:umn | the case of no home bias | markups are equally stabilized at the retail level, for both
41:1928:89222:20:21:63:517:308:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:domestic and foreign goods. In the second column, instead, the markup of \fnal producers is
41:1929:89313:21:20:63:440:287:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:much less volatile if they sell domestic goods, than if they sell imported goods.
41:1930:89394:20:20:80:517:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Relative to the case of upstream shocks, there are two notable di-erences as regards exchange
41:1931:89487:20:21:63:517:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rate volatility. First, because of nontradability, the real exchange rate is now much more volatile
41:1932:89586:21:20:63:517:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:than the terms of trade, even in the \rexible price allocation. Second, relative to the \rexible
41:1933:89682:20:20:63:517:206:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:price allocation, an economy with nominal rigidities and the optimal policy in place will be
41:1934:89774:20:21:63:517:186:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:characterized by more volatility in both the real exchange rate and the terms of trade. The fact
41:1935:89870:21:20:63:517:165:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that these patterns are quite di-erent from those discussed in the previous subsection makes it
41:1936:89965:20:20:63:517:145:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:clear that optimal monetary policies do not translate into any general prescription about the
41:1937:90058:20:0:63:283:125:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:relative volatility of these international prices.

42:1939:90131:27:20:63:517:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:We now have all the basic elements to analyze our baseline economy with all shocks combined.
42:1940:90223:20:21:63:517:667:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Results are shown in Table 3. Observe that the combination of downstream and upstream shocks
42:1941:90315:21:20:63:517:646:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:raises the volatility in our arti\fcial economy reasonably close to the data for the US and other
42:1942:90412:20:20:63:517:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:large industrial economies: for instance, the standard deviations of real GDP is (realistically)
42:1943:90508:20:21:63:300:606:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:around 2 percent, regardless of nominal rigidities.
42:1944:90559:21:20:80:517:585:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Consider \frst the \rexible-price benchmark, shown in the \frst column of the table. With
42:1945:90648:20:20:63:517:565:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:\rexible prices, the demand elasticity facing producers, and thus the markups they charge, are
42:1946:90742:20:21:63:517:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:constant; therefore the law of one price holds at the dock (the volatility of deviations from the law
42:1947:90843:21:20:63:517:524:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of one price at the dock is correspondingly zero). Nonetheless, the law of one price (cannot and)
42:1948:90940:20:20:63:517:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:does not hold for \fnal goods: country-speci\fc productivity shocks hitting the downstream \frms
42:1949:91036:20:21:63:517:484:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:drive a wedge between \fnal goods' prices across countries (expressed in a common currency). As
42:1950:91131:21:20:63:517:463:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a result, and in accord to stylized facts, the real exchange rate is more volatile than the terms
42:1951:91228:20:20:63:517:443:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of trade; the correlation between the real (and nominal) exchange rate is high and positive
42:1952:91319:20:21:63:517:423:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:| despite the fact that upstream and downstream technology shocks are assumed not to be
42:1953:91406:21:20:63:517:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:correlated. Recall that, in our \rexible price economy, we posit that monetary policy keeps the
42:1954:91501:20:20:63:517:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:CPI constant: consistent with this monetary regime, sectoral in\ration rates are more volatile at
42:1955:91598:20:21:63:517:362:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:producer level than at the \fnal level, and for imported goods than for domestically produced
42:1956:91691:21:20:63:517:341:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:goods, respectively. The latter result clearly re\rects the low weight of foreign goods in the CPI.
42:1957:91790:20:20:80:517:321:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The second column of Table 3 displays results for our sticky-price economy with the opti-
42:1958:91879:20:21:63:517:301:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:mal policy in place. In order to reduce ine-ciencies due to price stickiness, monetary policy
42:1959:91972:21:20:63:517:280:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:mitigates \ructuations in the major components of consumer price in\ration. However, it falls
42:1960:92065:20:20:63:517:260:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:short of completely stabilizing either the CPI or domestic intermediate prices in\ration. Key
42:1961:92158:20:21:63:517:240:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to understanding this result are the di-erent trade-o-s discussed in the text above. First, as
42:1962:92252:21:20:63:517:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in Corsetti and Pesenti [2005], LCP at upstream level leads benevolent monetary authorities
42:1963:92343:20:20:63:517:199:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to attach a positive weight to stabilizing the consumer price of imports, and thus to deviate
42:1964:92436:20:21:63:517:179:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:from perfect stabilization of the \fnal prices of domestic goods. Second, downstream technology
42:1965:92531:21:20:63:517:158:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:shocks prevent perfect stabilization of all consumer prices, because of the heterogeneity of mar-
42:1966:92628:20:20:63:517:138:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ginal costs implied by vertical interactions. This e-ect is of course worse in an open economy
42:1967:92722:20:0:63:517:118:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:setting, because of the response of the intermediate price of imports to exchange rate \ructua-
43:1968:92819:0:20:63:517:714:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tions. Third, the elasticity of the producer's demand curve depends on the industry's dispersion
43:1969:92915:20:20:63:517:694:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of \fnal goods prices, motivating policy emphasis on \fnal price stabilization. The implications
43:1970:93011:20:21:63:517:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of these trade-o-s for the volatilities of prices and markups, real exchange rates and terms of
43:1971:93106:21:20:63:517:653:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:trade are discussed below, together with a comparative analysis of the optimal policy relative
43:1972:93200:20:36:63:163:633:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to other policy rules.
43:1973:93222:36:20:63:517:597:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f3:B:Prices and markupsBecause of limited price adjustment, it is not surprising that real vari-
43:1974:93313:20:20:63:517:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ables generally display more volatility in the sticky-price economy (with the optimal monetary
43:1975:93407:20:21:63:516:557:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:policy in place), than in the \rexible-price economy.17Notable exceptions are the terms of trade
43:1976:93503:21:20:63:517:536:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and hours worked. The reduced volatility of the terms of trade is a consequence of LCP at the
43:1977:93596:20:20:63:517:516:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:intermediate level, as discussed in Section 7.1 above. A reduced volatility of hours worked is
43:1978:93690:20:21:63:517:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:already a feature of optimal monetary policy with downstream shocks only in Table 2, and is
43:1979:93781:21:20:63:491:475:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:essentially a consequences of our assumption that downstream \frms do not employ labor.
43:1980:93868:20:20:80:517:455:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:What is most interesting, instead, is the very large discrepancy in volatilities of producers'
43:1981:93962:20:21:63:517:435:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and distributors' average markups, which are constant in the \rexible-price allocation.  The
43:1982:94054:21:20:63:517:414:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:markup of domestically produced goods is two and a half times as volatile at the upstream level
43:1983:94149:20:20:63:517:394:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:as at the downstream level. This is remarkable in light of the fact that, in our experiments, we
43:1984:94245:20:21:63:517:374:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:assume the same degree of nominal rigidities at either level. The volatility di-erential re\rects the
43:1985:94346:21:20:63:517:353:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:real components of markup movements in producers' prices, arising from vertical interactions.
43:1986:94439:20:20:63:517:333:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Conversely, the markup of imported goods is more volatile at the downstream level than at the
43:1987:94532:20:21:63:517:313:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:upstream level | almost twice as much. Such di-erential re\rects the fact that optimal policy
43:1988:94625:21:20:63:517:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:attaches a large weight to stabilizing domestically produced goods at the retail level | the bulk
43:1989:94722:20:20:63:197:272:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of households' consumption.
43:1990:94749:20:21:80:517:252:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We should stress here that \ructuations in markups translate into ine-cient deviations in the
43:1991:94842:21:20:63:517:231:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:law of one price, both at the border and at the consumer level. Observe that the volatility of
43:1992:94936:20:16:63:517:211:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:deviations from the law of one price in \fnal prices is quite similar to the one in the economy with
43:1993:95036:16:20:72:517:195:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:17The volatility di-erential between our economies with and without nominal rigidities is by no means uniform
43:1994:95145:20:16:63:517:175:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:across sectors. Namely, for domestically produced goods, the ratio in volatility of upstream and downstream prices
43:1995:95259:16:17:63:517:159:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:is 4 in the \rexible price allocation, but it falls down to 2.5 with nominal rigidities. A similar drop can be found in
43:1996:95378:17:16:63:517:142:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:the ratio of volatility of imports prices to domestic goods prices. Conversely, the volatility of the producer price
43:1997:95494:16:17:63:517:126:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:of imported goods, though lower than in the \rexible price economy, is now twice that of domestically produced
43:1998:95604:17:0:63:89:109:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:goods.
44:1999:95612:0:20:63:517:714:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:\rexible prices, notwithstanding that, per e-ect of the exchange rate movements, the markups
44:2000:95704:20:36:63:432:694:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of Home downstream \frms selling imported goods have the highest volatility.
44:2001:95780:36:20:63:517:658:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f3:B:Real exchange rates and terms of tradeA notable international dimension of the optimal
44:2002:95866:20:20:63:517:638:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:policy in Table 3 is that the real exchange rate is more volatile in the economy with nominal
44:2003:95959:20:21:63:517:618:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:frictions than under \rexible prices, while the terms of trade is less volatile, re\recting the e-ects
44:2004:96061:21:20:63:517:597:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of LCP and nontradability discussed above. These \fndings clearly caution against suggestions
44:2005:96154:20:20:63:517:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to drastically curb the volatility of nominal and real exchange rates. For instance, they caution
44:2006:96251:20:21:63:517:557:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:against the strong policy prescription derived by by Devereux and Engel [2007], who argue that
44:2007:96345:21:20:63:517:536:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:under pervasive LCP the optimal stabilization policy should reduce the variability of the real
44:2008:96439:20:20:63:517:516:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:exchange rate signi\fcantly below that of the terms of trade. In these authors' view, the fact that
44:2009:96538:20:21:63:517:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:we observe the opposite pattern in the data suggests that policymakers around the world fail to
44:2010:96633:21:20:63:517:475:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:stabilize currency movements e-ciently. As we argued above, the problem with this and similar
44:2011:96726:20:20:63:517:455:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:views is that, while there are good theoretical reasons to expect optimal policies under LCP to
44:2012:96821:20:21:63:517:435:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:contain the volatility of the terms of trade, these reasons cannot be mechanically applied to the
44:2013:96918:21:20:63:517:414:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:real exchange rate, whose volatility is bound to depend on a number of structural features of
44:2014:97011:20:36:63:133:394:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:B:the economy.18
44:2015:97025:36:20:63:517:358:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f3:B:Simple rulesThe last three columns of Table 3 report results for alternative policy rules,
44:2016:97115:20:20:63:517:338:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:namely, CPI in\ration targeting, GDP in\ration targeting and a standard Taylor rule. Compared
44:2017:97208:20:20:63:517:318:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to the optimal policy, these alternative simple rules bring about noticeably larger volatility in
44:2018:97305:20:21:63:517:298:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:most real variables, particularly in the markups and the deviations from the law of one price for
44:2019:97402:21:20:63:278:277:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:both consumer prices and prices at the dock.
44:2020:97446:20:20:80:517:257:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Focus \frst on the strict CPI in\ration targeting regime, presented in the third column of
44:2021:97536:20:21:63:517:237:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Table 3: such monetary policy regime leads to more volatility in the upstream prices of all
44:2022:97627:21:20:63:517:216:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:goods (imported and domestically produced).  Relative to the optimal policy, the economy
44:2023:97715:20:20:63:517:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:displays higher volatility of markups, terms of trade and the real exchange rate.  This is so
44:2024:97808:20:16:63:517:176:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:because complete stabilization of headline consumer price in\ration brings about suboptimally
44:2025:97901:16:21:72:517:160:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:F:18As discussed above, in our model the optimal ranking of volatility between the real exchange rate and the
44:2026:98008:21:16:63:517:139:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:terms of trade depends, among other things, on the relative degree of price stickiness among upstream and
44:2027:98113:16:16:63:517:123:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:downstream producers. If producer prices are assumed to be completely \rexible, the real exchange rate becomes
44:2028:98223:16:0:63:470:107:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:F:less volatile than the terms of trade | in line with the case discussed by Devereux and Engel [2007].
45:2029:98326:0:20:63:517:714:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:large movements in sectoral (i.e. domestic and imported goods) in\ration rates at retail level,
45:2030:98421:20:20:63:389:694:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:which ultimately a-ect the desired markups by upstream producers.
45:2031:98486:20:21:80:517:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Likewise, stabilizing the prices of domestically produced goods | the case dubbed GDP
45:2032:98571:21:20:63:517:653:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in\ration targeting in the fourth column of Table 3 | also leads to too much volatility in sectoral
45:2033:98670:20:20:63:517:633:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in\ration rates, especially in in\ration of imported goods at the border as well as at the consumer
45:2034:98769:20:21:63:517:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:level. Interestingly, consumption and real GDP are less volatile than under the optimal policy;
45:2035:98864:21:20:63:517:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:but this is achieved by generating more volatility in all other real variables, especially in hours
45:2036:98963:20:20:63:517:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:worked and in the terms of trade, because of the suboptimally low weight attached to stabilizing
45:2037:99059:20:21:63:216:552:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:export and import goods prices.
45:2038:99090:21:20:80:517:531:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, a Taylor rule (following a quite standard parameterization) improves on the strict
45:2039:99181:20:20:63:517:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:CPI in\ration target, by producing less volatility in consumption and hours. However, relative
45:2040:99275:20:21:63:517:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to the optimal policy, both the CPI and its individual components are too volatile, since too
45:2041:99368:21:20:63:517:470:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:much importance is attached to output stabilization. As a result, the volatility of consumption
45:2042:99463:20:43:63:238:450:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is excessive, that of hours is too low.
45:2043:99502:43:31:63:229:407:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:8  Concluding remarks
45:2044:99523:31:21:63:517:376:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The literature in international economics and open macro has so far pursued two distinct expla-
45:2045:99618:21:20:63:517:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:nations of the observed stability of import prices in local currency. According to one modeling
45:2046:99713:20:20:63:517:335:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:strategy, this is the result of optimal markup adjustment by monopolistic \frms, which optimize
45:2047:99808:20:21:63:517:315:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:pro\fts through price discrimination across national markets. In this case, market segmenta-
45:2048:99900:21:20:63:517:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tion is attributed to real factors. According to an alternative modeling strategy, local-currency
45:2049:99997:20:20:63:517:274:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:price-stability re\rects nominal rigidities, which imply suboptimal variations in \frms pro\fts in
45:2050:100095:20:21:63:517:254:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:response to shocks. By considering vertically integrated \frms, our paper emphasizes that a rigid
45:2051:100192:21:20:63:517:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:distinction between these two approaches is unwarranted, since optimal markup adjustments and
45:2052:100285:20:20:63:517:213:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:nominal frictions are likely to act as intertwined factors in causing stable import prices in local
45:2053:100384:20:21:63:517:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:currency.  Speci\fcally, we build a model where, because of market-speci\fc nominal rigidities
45:2054:100478:21:20:63:517:172:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:at the downstream level, di-erent dynamics in \fnal prices provide an incentive for upstream
45:2055:100570:20:20:63:517:152:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:producers to price discriminate across countries, exacerbating the distortions from monopoly
45:2056:100662:20:21:63:517:132:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:power. At the same time, the use of local nontradable inputs by \frms selling goods to \fnal
45:2057:100754:21:0:63:391:111:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:users mutes the response of \fnal prices to exchange rate movements.
46:2058:100824:0:20:80:517:714:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:There are at least three potentially important implications of our \fndings for policymaking.
46:2059:100917:20:20:63:517:694:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:First, by creating price discrimination at the border, consumer price movements feed back to
46:2060:101009:20:21:63:517:674:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:deviations from the law of one price across markets. The transmission mechanism from consumer
46:2061:101102:21:20:63:517:653:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:price in\ration to price discrimination provides monetary authorities with an additional reason
46:2062:101197:20:20:63:517:633:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to stabilize \fnal prices. In this respect, our analysis sheds light on one possible reason why the
46:2063:101296:20:21:63:517:613:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:progressive stabilization of in\ration in the last decade may have contributed to the observed
46:2064:101390:21:20:63:517:592:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:fall in exchange-rate pass-through. By reducing movements in consumer prices, policymakers
46:2065:101480:20:20:63:517:572:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:indirectly a-ect the demand elasticity faced by upstream producers, reducing opportunities for
46:2066:101574:20:21:63:334:552:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:exercising monopoly power through price discrimination.
46:2067:101629:21:20:80:517:531:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Yet, complete CPI stabilization will never be desirable in our economies, because of both
46:2068:101718:20:20:63:517:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:international and domestic policy trade-o-s. Speci\fcally, in addition to the international di-
46:2069:101813:20:21:63:517:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:mensions of monetary policy already discussed in the literature, we show that, with vertical
46:2070:101905:21:20:63:517:470:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:interactions among industries adjusting prices in a staggered fashion, domestic price stability is
46:2071:102003:20:20:63:517:450:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:actually unfeasible. This is due to the fact that nominal rigidities inducing staggered pricing by
46:2072:102101:20:21:63:465:430:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:upstream producers, inherently lead to cost heterogeneity among downstream \frms.
46:2073:102182:21:20:80:517:409:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, as shown by the literature, nominal rigidities in local currency induce positive co-
46:2074:102275:20:20:63:517:389:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:movements in the optimal monetary stance across countries, which tend to curb the volatility of
46:2075:102370:20:21:63:517:369:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the terms of trade. However, our results make it clear that, at an optimum, the real exchange
46:2076:102463:21:20:63:517:348:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rate can be more or less volatile than the terms of trade, depending on a number of structural
46:2077:102557:20:20:63:517:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:features of the economy, like home bias in expenditure and local components of marginal costs
46:2078:102650:20:21:63:517:308:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in consumer goods. In this sense, the empirical regularity that real exchange rates are typically
46:2079:102747:21:20:63:517:287:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:more volatile than the terms of trade does not automatically suggest that policymakers fall short
46:2080:102844:20:43:63:249:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of stabilizing exchange rates e-ciently.
