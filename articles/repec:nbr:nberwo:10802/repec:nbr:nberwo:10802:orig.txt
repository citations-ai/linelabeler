2:24:1074:26:24:71:539:597:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Our  objective  in  this  paper  is  to  define  jurisdictional  advantage,  the  recognition  that  location  is
2:25:1187:24:24:71:539:573:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:critical to firms’ innovative success and that every location has unique assets that are not easily
2:26:1286:24:24:71:539:549:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:replicated.  The purpose is to be normative and policy oriented.   Drawing from the well-developed
2:27:1384:24:24:71:539:525:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:literature  on  corporate  strategy,  we  consider  analogies  to  cities  in  their  search  for  competitive
2:28:1494:24:24:71:539:501:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:advantage.  In contrast to the more passive term locational advantage, our use of the term jurisdiction
2:29:1597:24:24:71:539:477:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:denotes  geographically-defined  legal  and  political  decision-making  authority  and  coordination.
2:30:1699:24:24:71:539:453:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Thus, jurisdictions may be constructed and managed to promote a coherent activity set.  We review
2:31:1796:24:24:71:539:429:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:recent advances in our understanding of patterns of urban specialization and the composition of
2:32:1891:24:24:71:539:405:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:activities within cities, which suggest strategies that may generate economic growth as well as those
2:33:1992:24:24:71:539:381:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:strategies  to  avoid.    This  paper  then  considers  the  role  of  firms  and  their  responsibility  to
2:34:2100:24:24:71:539:357:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:jurisdictions in light of the net benefits received from place-specific externalities, and concludes by

3:56:2581:14:14:71:74:612:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4: 
3:57:2581:14:27:107:548:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Economic  growth  is  a  preoccupation  among  economists  and  government  policy  makers.   
3:58:2675:27:28:71:542:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Traditionally the focus has been  at the national level, however research has shifted the focus to 
3:59:2774:28:28:71:542:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lower geographic units defined as clusters of industrial activities or alternatively as regions.  The 
3:60:2876:28:27:71:542:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:literature suggests that economic growth is a local process and that cities are an important, if not 
3:61:2977:27:28:71:542:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the   most   important   economic   unit,   in   generating   new   development,   competitiveness   and 
3:62:3082:28:27:71:543:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:prosperity.  When we talk about geographically-defined clusters of industrial activity or regional 
3:63:3181:27:28:71:542:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:economic development we are really talking about cities and the activities that take place within 
3:64:3279:28:28:71:543:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the city’s sphere of influence1.  It has not been popular to talk about cities in a policy context for 
3:65:3382:28:27:71:542:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:several  decades  in  the  United  States;  however,  the  new  economic  geography  literature  suggests 
3:66:3488:27:28:71:542:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that  the  time  has  come  to  focus  on  cities  and  the  construction  of  what  we  term  jurisdictional 
3:67:3598:28:27:71:400:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:advantage as a means to promote economic growth and prosperity.   
3:68:3664:27:28:107:542:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Research  has  established  that  cities,  due  to  the  geographic  proximity  of  firms  and  other 
3:69:3766:28:28:71:542:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:institutions,   provide   localized   knowledge   externalities   or   spillovers   that   provide   positive 
3:70:3876:28:27:71:542:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:economic  value.    Moreover,  cities  increase  opportunities  for  interaction  that  facilitates  learning 
3:71:3986:27:28:71:542:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and  the  absorption  of  knowledge,  provide  a  venue  for  experimentation  with  new  ideas  and 
3:72:4087:28:27:71:542:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:enhance the ability to exchange ideas and engage with others who have relevant expertise.  As a 
3:73:4183:27:28:71:542:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:result, firms in these locations enjoy higher productivity, greater innovation and growth, and pay 
3:74:4282:28:0:71:542:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:higher  wages.    A  growing  literature  documents  these  advantages.  However,  these  topics  have 
4:75:4386:0:28:71:542:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:more  than  an  academic  interest.    The  literature  begs  the  question:  if  you  are  responsible  for  a 
4:76:4498:28:28:71:448:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:jurisdiction, what should you do to promote prosperity and economic growth? 
4:77:4574:28:27:107:542:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our  objective  in  this  paper  is  to  define  jurisdictional  advantage,  the  recognition  that 
4:78:4674:27:28:71:542:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:location is critical to firms’ innovative success and that every location has unique assets that are 
4:79:4775:28:27:71:542:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:not  easily  replicated.    The  purpose  is  to  be  normative  and  policy  oriented.      Drawing  from  the 
4:80:4887:27:28:71:542:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:well-developed literature on corporate strategy, we consider analogies to cities in their search for 
4:81:4988:28:28:71:542:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:competitive advantage.  In contrast to the more passive term locational advantage, our use of the 
4:82:5086:28:27:71:542:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:term  jurisdiction  denotes  geographically-defined  legal  and  political  decision-making  authority 
4:83:5189:27:28:71:542:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and  coordination.    Thus,  jurisdictions  may  be  constructed  and  managed  to  promote  a  coherent 
4:84:5294:28:27:71:542:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:activity set.  We review recent advances in our understanding of patterns of urban specialization 
4:85:5392:27:28:71:542:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and  the  composition  of  activities  within  cities,  which  suggest  strategies  that  may  generate 
4:86:5496:28:28:71:542:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:economic growth as well as those strategies to avoid.  This paper then considers the role of firms 
4:87:5595:28:27:71:542:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and  their  responsibility  to  jurisdictions  in  light  of  the  net  benefits  received  from  place-specific 
4:88:5708:27:28:71:542:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:externalities,   and   concludes   by   considering   the   challenges   to   implementing   jurisdictional 
4:89:5816:28:27:71:131:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:advantage.

4:94:5868:14:27:107:542:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:There  are  two  extreme  philosophies  available  to  policy  makers  to  foster  economic 
4:95:5960:27:28:71:542:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:development.  One potential approach is laissez-faire – simply letting market forces work.  The 
4:96:6056:28:27:71:542:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rationale  is  that  industrial  clusters  that  are  part  of  successful  cities  arise  for  a  variety  of 
4:97:6167:27:28:71:542:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:historically contingent or serendipitous factors not easily replicated.  Firms locate and invest in a 
4:98:6269:28:28:71:545:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:particular  city  for  reasons  that  are  not  well  understood,  much  less  predictable  and  controllable.  
4:99:6381:28:0:71:542:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This  view  suggests  that  the  most  constructive  thing  a  jurisdiction  can  do  is  let  market  forces 
5:100:6492:0:28:71:542:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:determine  its  future  fate  and  simply  hope  for  the  best.    Given  the  challenges  of  jurisdictional 
5:101:6603:28:28:71:545:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:decision-making,  the  laissez-faire  approach  has  some  appeal  but  it  is  not  without  drawbacks.  
5:102:6709:28:27:71:542:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Since  industrial  development  demonstrates  high  levels  of  path  dependence  and  increasing 
5:103:6807:27:28:71:542:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:returns,  if  a  city  misses  out  on  an  important  trend,  new  technology  or  infrastructure  investment 
5:104:6918:28:27:71:543:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on  the  basis  of  a laissez-faire  attitude,  it  may  miss  out  for  a  very  long  time.    Moreover,  the 
5:105:7030:27:28:71:542:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:existence of market failures associated with innovative activity inhibits the efficient allocation of 
5:106:7132:28:28:71:442:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:resources, suggesting that there may be a role for government involvement.   
5:107:7209:28:27:107:542:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:An  opposing  philosophy  advocates  aggressive  planning  towards  a  targeted  industry  in 
5:108:7303:27:28:71:542:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:what  is  a  “if  you  build  it  they  will  come”  philosophy.    Typically,  politicians  and  civic  leaders 
5:109:7416:28:27:71:542:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:focus  on  some  emerging,  high-growth  industry  with  great  fanfare,  high-profile  events  and  the 
5:110:7521:27:28:71:542:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:commitment  of  substantial  public  resources.    These  efforts  are  often  mimicked  by  similar 
5:111:7622:28:28:71:542:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:jurisdictions in a classic bandwagon effect.  For example, currently, forty-eight of the fifty states 
5:112:7724:28:27:71:542:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:currently  have  biotechnology  initiatives  (Biotechnology  Industry  Organization,  2001).    Most  of 
5:113:7829:27:28:71:542:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:these  focus  on  human  therapeutics  and  attempt  to  leverage  local  universities  and  medical 
5:114:7930:28:27:71:119:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:schools.   
5:115:7941:27:28:107:542:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:There are numerous examples where governments have not been able to establish clusters

5:117:8137:28:27:71:542:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Silicon  Valley   (Leslie   and  Kargon,  1997).    Despite  the  presence  of  prominent  research 
5:118:8237:27:28:71:542:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:universities and substantial private R&D sector, the net effect was several strategic partnerships 
5:119:8336:28:27:71:542:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rather than broad-based economic development.  Even in cases where policymakers were able to 
5:120:8429:27:28:71:542:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:implement  an  economic  development  vision,  as  in  the  case  of  Research  Triangle  Park,  Link

5:122:8640:28:0:71:542:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:measurable  outcomes.    Even  when  efforts  are  successful  at  generating  start-up  companies  it  is 
6:123:8748:0:28:71:542:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:difficult  for  a  jurisdiction  to  garner  longer  term  benefits  if  complementary  assets  are  lacking

6:125:8904:28:27:107:542:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The nature of innovation makes it difficult to dictate industrial clusters.  Commercializing 
6:126:8997:27:28:71:542:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:technological  breakthroughs  requires  translating  scientific  potential  into  consumer  needs  and 
6:127:9100:28:27:71:542:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:product  markets.    At  its  earliest  stages,  before  applications  are  easily  described  or  generally 
6:128:9209:27:28:71:542:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:appreciated, locating near the center of innovative activity provides critical competitive business 
6:129:9309:28:28:71:542:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:advantage.    Realizing  the  potential  of  a  technological  breakthrough  requires  a  sophisticated 
6:130:9413:28:27:71:542:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:understanding of consumer needs, existing markets for product innovation and factor inputs and 
6:131:9508:27:28:71:543:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:prevailing  production  technology.   Co-location  increases  awareness  of  emerging  trends  and 
6:132:9607:28:27:71:542:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reduces  uncertainty  for  firms.    Innovation  clusters  spatially  in  locations  where  knowledge 
6:133:9709:27:28:71:397:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:externalities reduce the costs of discovery and commercialization.   
6:134:9778:28:28:107:542:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:When  a  technology  reaches  a  stage  when  it  can  be  easily  understood  and  valued,  the 
6:135:9875:28:27:71:542:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:established centers – the first movers – already have an advantage.  Increasing returns is a feature 
6:136:9976:27:28:71:542:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of  innovation  and  knowledge-based  industrial  activity.    As  a  result,  there  is  a  tendency  for 
6:137:10083:28:27:71:542:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:activities which are  ahead to get even further  ahead (Arthur 1996).    By the time an industry is 
6:138:10183:27:28:71:542:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:well-known  enough  to  be  targeted  for  economic  development  other  jurisdictions  have  probably 
6:139:10286:28:28:71:545:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:already  captured  the  lion’s  share  of  the  benefits  and  are  positioned  for  greater  advantage.  
6:140:10392:28:27:71:542:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Moreover, the path of emerging industries is difficult to predict and is extremely fluid.  Planning 
6:141:10492:27:28:71:542:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:efforts   based   on   current   assumptions   will   never   be   able   to   anticipate   future   scientific 
6:142:10604:28:27:71:542:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:developments  and  the  direction  that  a  technology  may  take.    Consider  the  Internet  as  a  case  in 
6:143:10715:27:28:71:542:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:point.    In  1990,  few,  if  any,  jurisdictions  focused  on  this  technology  but  by  the  middle  of  the 
6:144:10828:28:28:71:542:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:decade,  the  country  was  caught  in  dot-com-mania  with  numerous  public  sector  initiatives,  tax 
6:145:10933:28:0:71:435:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:incentives and business incubators that have mostly been abandoned now.   
7:146:11008:0:28:107:542:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A  middle  alternative  to  the  two  philosophies  discussed  may  be  ableto  influence  the 
7:147:11103:28:28:71:542:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:quality  and  shape  of  economic  outcomes  by  making  judicious  investments  and  avoiding  costly 
7:148:11206:28:27:71:542:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mistakes  –  deliberately  constructing  jurisdictional  advantage  by  building  on  existing,  not  easily 
7:149:11315:27:28:71:542:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:replicated resources and by complementing private sector activities.  The pursuit of jurisdictional 
7:150:11415:28:27:71:545:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:advantage is not without challenges because there are so many factors that influence outcomes.  
7:151:11511:27:28:71:542:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:However, given that future prosperity and quality of life are at stake, questions of how this might 
7:152:11611:28:27:71:307:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:be done are of more than just academic interest.  
7:153:11661:27:26:107:115:516:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:   
7:154:11664:26:14:107:110:490:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: 
7:155:11664:14:14:71:249:476:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Corporate Strategy as an Analogy 
7:156:11697:14:13:71:74:462:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4: 
7:157:11697:13:28:107:542:449:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We believe a helpful analogy can be made between jurisdictions and firms with respect to 
7:158:11786:28:27:71:542:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:strategic  advantage.    Certainly,  cities  have  more  complex  objective  functions  overall  than  do 
7:159:11892:27:28:71:542:394:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firms.  However  when  we  think  about  economic  development  specifically  within  the  context  of 
7:160:11995:28:28:71:542:366:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cluster  formation  and  industrial  competitiveness,  the  analogy  is  instructive.    For  firms,  the 
7:161:12101:28:27:71:542:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:overarching  goal  is  to  gain  and  maintain  competitive  advantage,  which  translates  into  above 
7:162:12205:27:28:71:542:311:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:average  returns  for  shareholders.    The  way  to  achieve  competitive  advantage  is  to  create  a 
7:163:12310:28:27:71:542:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:competitive  strategy  that  is  consistent  with  trends  in  the  firm’s  industry  and  appropriate  to  the 
7:164:12422:27:28:71:239:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firm’s resources and capabilities.   
7:165:12459:28:28:107:542:228:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:One  important  school  of  competitive  strategy  holds  that  competitive  advantage  arises 
7:166:12554:28:27:71:542:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from the concept of creating a unique activity system, which is achieved either by an advantage 
7:167:12650:27:28:71:542:173:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of  low  cost  or  by  way  of  differentiation  (Porter  1980).    A  unique  activity  system  is  a  web  of 
7:168:12762:28:27:71:542:145:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:activities  that,  when  working  together,  provide  an  advantage  that  is  difficult,  if  not  impossible, 
7:169:12874:27:28:71:542:118:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for  competitors  to  replicate,  because  the  individual  activities  fit  well  together  and  actually 
7:170:12981:28:0:71:542:90:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reinforce each other.  For example, Southwest Airlines has been the most successful airline in the 
8:171:13081:0:28:71:542:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:US  market  over  the  past  30  years,  in  level  of  profitability,  stability  of  earnings  and  growth  in 
8:172:13194:28:28:71:542:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:market  share.    Competitive  advantage  is  not  achieved  through  any  single  thing  it  does  such  as 
8:173:13303:28:27:71:542:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:flying  a  completely  standard  fleet  of  Boeing  737s,  or  by  flying  from  secondary  airports,  or 
8:174:13409:27:28:71:542:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:having the most frequent daily departures from each of its locations, or by utilizing the Internet 
8:175:13508:28:27:71:542:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rather than travel agents for booking. Rather, Southwest achieves advantage by performing all of 
8:176:13605:27:28:71:542:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:these  (and  more)  activities  in  ways  that  fit  together  and  reinforce  each  other  to  produce  a 
8:177:13712:28:28:71:542:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:significant  and  sustainable  cost  advantage  over  all  of  its  competitors,  while  offering  high  and 
8:178:13821:28:27:71:542:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:consistent service to its  customers. Any  competitor would have to match  every single aspect of 
8:179:13919:27:28:71:542:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Southwest’s  activity  system  to  challenge  the  overall  outcome  –  and  thus  far  no  competitor  has 
8:180:14027:28:27:71:281:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:been successful in doing so (Porter 1996).   
8:181:14072:27:28:107:542:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The activity system can  provide a low cost advantage by  enabling the firm to produce a 
8:182:14161:28:28:71:542:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:product or service for a segment of customers that is roughly equivalent to that of the competitor 
8:183:14260:28:27:71:542:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:at  a  significantly  lower  cost  –  resulting  in  higher  profitability  than  the  average  competitor  as  is 
8:184:14375:27:28:71:542:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the case for Southwest Airlines.   It is important to note that being a low cost firm is not the same 
8:185:14477:28:27:71:542:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:as being a low price firm.  Having the same cost structure as competitors and deciding to sell at a 
8:186:14577:27:28:71:542:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lower profit margin is not a strategy for long term advantage, but rather a strategy of transferring 
8:187:14678:28:28:71:545:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:value from corporate shareholders to customers. It is simply not a sustainable long-term strategy.  
8:188:14778:28:27:71:542:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Any  competitive  firm  that  objects  to  inroads  made  on  the  base  of  a  low  price  approach  can 
8:189:14884:27:28:71:542:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:simply cut its own prices and margins to compete.  This, ultimately, leads to a race to the bottom 
8:190:14983:28:27:71:542:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in terms of profitability.  And any firm with a cost advantage in the industry in question will be 
8:191:15082:27:28:71:542:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:able  to  set  prices  lower  and  force  the  low  price  player  out  of  the  industry.    In  many  respects, 
8:192:15196:28:28:71:542:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:numerous  dot-com  bubble  firms  employed  the  ultimate  low  price  strategy  –  giving  away  their 
8:193:15300:28:0:71:542:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:product or service – and confused both themselves and the capital markets into believing it was a 
9:194:15399:0:28:71:542:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sensible  strategy.    It  was  not  sound  because  low price  is  not  a  viable  strategy  in  the  absence  of 
9:195:15514:28:28:71:128:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:low costs.   
9:196:15527:28:27:107:542:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Alternatively,  a  firm’s  activity  system  can  provide  a  differentiation  advantage  by 
9:197:15620:27:28:71:542:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:enabling the firm to produce a product or service that is considered to be uniquely more valuable 
9:198:15718:28:27:71:542:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:than those of competitors by a segment of customers and for which those customers are willing, 
9:199:15813:27:28:71:542:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:even happy, to pay a premium price.  For example, Progressive Insurance offers a differentiated 
9:200:15909:28:28:71:542:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:automobile  insurance  service  to  a  non-standard  segment  of  drivers.    It  offers  quotes  that  are 
9:201:16017:28:27:71:542:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:better-tailored  to  the  true  risk  category  of  drivers  and  provides  quick  and  easy  settlement  of 
9:202:16126:27:28:71:542:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:claims by way of an extensive fleet of van-based adjusters.  Like Southwest Airlines, Progressive 
9:203:16224:28:27:71:542:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:also  has  a  unique  activity  system  that  features  many  activities,  such  as  its  massive  pricing 
9:204:16331:27:28:71:542:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:database, a fleet of claims-settling vans, unique training and compensation structures, as well as 
9:205:16430:28:28:71:542:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a unique investment philosophy, which fit together and reinforce each other to produce a service 
9:206:16527:28:27:71:444:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that is highly-valued by its customers and is produced at a competitive cost.   
9:207:16607:27:28:107:542:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A competitive cost structure is important to the differentiation strategy because having a 
9:208:16698:28:27:71:539:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:premium  price  with  a  cost  structure  that  eats  up  the  entire  premium  is  not  a  strategy  for  long-
9:209:16810:27:28:71:542:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:term  competitive  advantage.    It  is  a  strategy  for  satisfying  customers  but  not  for  providing 
9:210:16917:28:28:71:542:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:adequate  returns  to  shareholders.    Keeping  the  cost  structure  under  control  requires  an  activity 
9:211:17027:28:27:71:524:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:system that minimizes the total systems cost of providing a differentiated product or service.   
9:212:17124:27:28:107:542:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The concepts of strategy and strategic thinking have become well-accepted by firms over 
9:213:17212:28:27:71:542:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the past thirty  years.  Strategy allows firms to define what they  are about  and most importantly 
9:214:17312:27:28:71:542:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:what they are not about.  In the next section of the paper we argue that a city or region may seek 
9:215:17411:28:28:71:542:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to attain jurisdictional advantage by building an activity system that is unique and is valuable in 
9:216:17511:28:0:71:464:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:producing either a low cost or differentiation advantage over other jurisdictions.

10:221:17721:27:28:71:542:640:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:should  a  jurisdiction  seek  advantage?  John  Locke  argued  that  government  is  the  vehicle  for 
10:222:17825:28:28:71:542:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:collective action (Locke 1967).  Like firms, jurisdictions are socially constructed entities that can 
10:223:17927:28:27:71:542:584:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:raise  funds,  organize  resources  and  live  on  in  perpetuity  or  at  least  do  these  things  better  than 
10:224:18041:27:28:71:542:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:individuals can.  Locke’s argument is that government is a legitimate tool by which individuals 
10:225:18137:28:27:71:542:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:may further their shared interests by acting in common.  While these shared interests should not 
10:226:18234:27:28:71:542:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rest  on  any  particular  conception  of  the  common  good  or  individual  happiness,  it  is  a 
10:227:18334:28:28:71:542:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fundamental  premise  of  Locke’s  argument  that  income  and  wealth  are  instrumental  goods 
10:228:18431:28:27:71:258:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:desired, to some extent, by everyone.   
10:229:18471:27:28:107:542:419:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A measure of the common good is the prevailing wealth in the jurisdiction.  Wealth is a 
10:230:18559:28:27:71:542:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:combination  of  wages  and  investments.    For  most  of  the  world’s  population,  housing  equity 
10:231:18662:27:28:71:542:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:represents  their  single  largest  investment  and  the  value  of  jurisdictional  amenities  and  local 
10:232:18769:28:28:71:542:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:quality of life is capitalized in housing prices.  Higher levels of local public services, higher local 
10:233:18873:28:27:71:542:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wages  and  a  growing  local  economy  all  contribute  to  appreciation  of  real  estate  values  and  the 
10:234:18983:27:28:71:542:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wealth  of  property  owners.    Since  the  majority  of  American  households  own  their  own  homes 
10:235:19087:28:27:71:542:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:increases  in  property  values  are  broadly  distributed  across  the  population.    Moreover,  increases 
10:236:19196:27:28:71:542:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in  property  values  yield  higher  tax  revenues  for  the  jurisdiction  which,  if  used  judiciously, 
10:237:19303:28:28:71:464:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:increase amenities.  In this way, virtuous cycles of economic growth are created.  
10:238:19386:28:27:107:542:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Wages  are  an  important  measure  of  the  wealth  of  the  jurisdiction.    The  greater  the 
10:239:19483:27:28:71:542:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:positive  variance  in  wage  levels  from  the  mean,  the  greater  the  jurisdictional  advantage  from 
10:240:19590:28:27:71:542:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:which  the  residents  benefit,  other  things  being  equal.    However,  there  are  two  adjustments  that 
10:241:19700:27:0:71:542:88:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:should  be  made  to  this  measure.    First,  when  comparing  jurisdictions  across  countries,  wages 
11:242:19807:0:28:71:542:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:adjusted for purchasing power parity should be the measure, as is the case when comparing gross 
11:243:19903:28:28:71:539:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:domestic product (GDP) per  capita.  Second, an  additional refinement would be to adjust after-
11:244:19999:28:27:71:542:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tax wages for major differences in government services and amenities provided.  So if after-tax 
11:245:20095:27:28:71:542:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wages were used to compare jurisdictions of a US city with a Canadian city, there should be an 
11:246:20190:28:27:71:542:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:adjustment for the fact that the residents of the Canadian city receive greater health care benefits 
11:247:20291:27:28:71:542:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:through  government  expenditure.    For  individuals  living  in  the  U.S  more  of  their  health  care 
11:248:20398:28:28:71:292:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:costs would be paid for from after-tax wages. 
11:249:20444:28:13:274:340:515:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Table 1 Here 
11:250:20457:13:14:71:74:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: 
11:251:20457:14:28:107:542:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Table  1  presents  differences  in  wages  by  jurisdiction  for  those  industries  which  have 
11:252:20555:28:27:71:542:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:some  demonstrated  competitive  advantage.    As  a  benchmark,  the  average  annual  wage  for  all 
11:253:20658:27:28:71:539:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:U.S. industries was approximately $33,200 in 2001.   We list city-industries that have a higher-
11:254:20754:28:28:71:542:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:than-average  national  wage  for  the  industry,  a  location  quotient  greater  than  one,  indicating 
11:255:20860:28:27:71:545:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:geographic  concentration  relative  to  national  employment,  and  more  than  10,000  employment.  
11:256:20962:27:28:71:542:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This   table   demonstrates   that   while   cities   specialize   in   certain   industrial   clusters,   that 
11:257:21074:28:27:71:377:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:specialization varies widely across cities in the same industry.   
11:258:21141:27:28:107:542:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Creating  and  sustaining  positive  wage  differentials  is  the  essence  of  jurisdictional 
11:259:21236:28:28:71:542:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:advantage.    It  is  important  to  note  that  this  is  not  synonymous  with  attracting  high-technology 
11:260:21346:28:27:71:542:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:industries, which has been a preoccupation of many economic development initiatives.  Many of 
11:261:21440:27:28:71:542:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  high-technology  industries  offer  substantial  employment  numbers  and  higher  than  national 
11:262:21543:28:27:71:542:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:average wages but they are not the only such industries.  Equally transformative are investments 
11:263:21640:27:28:71:542:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in existing, more mature industries that are already in place and can invest as a means to compete 
11:264:21739:28:28:71:542:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with  lower-cost  locations.    The  relatively  low-technology  financial  services  cluster  is  one  of 
11:265:21846:28:0:71:542:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:highest  paying  clusters.      In  addition,  other  mature  industries,  for  example,  printing  and 
12:266:21952:0:28:71:542:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:publishing  or  metal  manufacturing  have  continued  to  innovate  and  provide  something  that 
12:267:22051:28:28:71:542:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:markets value.  Distribution and logistics is another industry that is based on efficient inventory 
12:268:22151:28:27:71:252:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:control and the process of innovation 
12:269:22189:27:28:107:542:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In addition, many of theses clusters represent well-know associations between places and 
12:270:22278:28:27:71:542:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:industries.    For  example,  distribution  services  in Atlanta  have  a  long  history  as  a  transportation 
12:271:22390:27:28:71:542:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:hub  and  Los  Angeles  as  a  concentration  of  entertainment.    Certain  clusters,  such  as  education 
12:272:22498:28:28:71:542:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and knowledge creation; analytical instruments, aerospace vehicles and defense; communications 
12:273:22593:28:27:71:542:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equipment;  information  technology;  and  medical  devices  appear  to  cluster  together  and  to  be 
12:274:22697:27:28:71:439:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:more conducive to multiple clustering than others industries (Porter 2003).   
12:275:22775:28:27:107:542:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: Across the US economy, average wages differ greatly across and within industry clusters, 
12:276:22864:27:28:71:542:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:demonstrating  that  some  industries  tend  to  produce  higher  prosperity  than  others.    However, 
12:277:22968:28:28:71:542:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wages  in  the  same  cluster  vary  substantially  by  jurisdiction,  indicating  that  jurisdictions  can 
12:278:23076:28:27:71:542:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:influence  the  level  of  prosperity  generated  by  a  given  industry  or  cluster.  Table  2  present  four 
12:279:23188:27:28:71:542:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:representative industries, one from each quartile of the distribution of industry wages.  Financial 
12:280:23288:28:27:71:542:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:services  are  in  the  first  quartile  with  mean  annual  wages  of  $75,000;  medical  devices  are  from 
12:281:23398:27:28:71:542:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the second quartile with mean annual wages of $50,000; metal manufacturing represents the third 
12:282:23494:28:28:71:542:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:quartile with mean annual wages of $37,200; and, building fixture, equipment and services is in 
12:283:23590:28:27:71:542:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  bottom  quartile  with  mean  annual  wages  of  $31,000.    Similarly,  the  four  cities  listed  were 
12:284:23700:27:28:71:542:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:selected  to  represent  quartiles  of  the  distribution  of  wages  within  the  industry.  Each  city 
12:285:23805:28:27:71:542:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:presented  in  Table  2  had  a  location  quotient  greater  than  1,  which  indicates  to  relative 
12:286:23908:27:28:71:542:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:specialization for the industry within the geographic unit2, a minimum of one thousand workers, 
12:287:24004:28:0:71:545:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and average wages that are greater than the average wages for the city as indicated in column (3).  
13:288:24106:0:28:71:542:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Even when the wages are not high relative to the highest wages for the industry, they are higher 
13:289:24203:28:28:71:231:681:12:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:relative to the mean city wages.   
13:290:24238:28:33:275:339:653:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:Table 2 here 
13:291:24251:33:28:107:542:620:11:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: To  construct  jurisdictional  advantage  requires  a  jurisdictional  strategy  –  a  set  of  choices 
13:292:24355:28:27:71:542:592:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:which  produces  a  jurisdictional  activity  system  that  generates  either  low  cost  advantage  or 
13:293:24459:27:28:71:542:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:differentiation  advantage.    The  “customers”  for  a  jurisdiction  are  job-providing  entities  – 
13:294:24562:28:28:71:542:537:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:primarily,  but  not  exclusively,  firms.  Jurisdictions  are,  in  many  respects,  collections  of  firms, 
13:295:24672:28:27:71:542:509:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:both  large  and  small.  And  just  as  firms  are  one  economic  entity  that  organizes  resources  and 
13:296:24780:27:28:71:542:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:production,  jurisdictions  are  themselves  another  economic  entity  that  provides  a  platform  for 
13:297:24885:28:27:71:542:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:similarly  organizing  resources.    High  wage  jobs  are  the  reward  for  the  jurisdiction  that  can 
13:298:24992:27:28:71:542:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:generate  advantage  and  in  doing  so  attract,  incubate  and  grow  firms.  Jurisdictional  advantage 
13:299:25098:28:28:71:542:399:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:produces  an environment that both attracts investments by  existing firms to the jurisdiction and 
13:300:25197:28:27:71:542:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:promotes the creation of start-up businesses in the jurisdiction.  It also produces an environment 
13:301:25296:27:28:71:418:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that helps all of these firms prosper while operating in that jurisdiction.  
13:302:25373:28:27:107:542:316:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The  logic  of  endogenous  growth  suggests  that  new  start-up  firms  will  be  an  important 
13:303:25471:27:28:71:542:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:source  of  growth.    New  firms  are  based  on  the  identification  of  new  market  opportunities  and 
13:304:25579:28:28:71:542:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:they frequently get started as a means to bring new technology to the market.  Most importantly, 
13:305:25676:28:27:71:542:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:these  firms  are  relatively  geographically  immobile  as  entrepreneurs  build  upon  local  networks 
13:306:25781:27:28:71:542:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and expertise.  Individuals start companies based on their prior experience and interests, typically 
13:307:25882:28:27:71:542:178:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fulfilling  some  niche  that  a  larger  firm  may  judge  too  small,  exploiting  a  new  opportunity  that 
13:308:25993:27:28:71:542:151:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:may have a risk profile unsuited to a larger firm, or using a unique set of skills and knowledge to 
13:309:26093:28:28:71:542:123:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:develop applications.  Many individuals have location inertia because of lack of family mobility, 
13:310:26191:28:0:71:542:95:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:simple preferences or the risk of establishing a new company in a new location. In building their 
14:311:26291:0:28:71:542:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:companies,  entrepreneurs  rely  on  their  local  contacts,  connections,  and  knowledge  of  the 
14:312:26391:28:28:71:187:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:business environment.   
14:313:26415:28:27:107:542:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:History is replete with examples of co-located firms defining technological frontiers and 
14:314:26505:27:28:71:542:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:speeding  up  the  rate  of  technological  advance.    The  geographic  concentrations  of  related 
14:315:26606:28:27:71:542:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:industries  create  synergies  that  provide  unique  activity  sets  that  promote  the  emergence  of  new 
14:316:26715:27:28:71:542:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:industries: combining new knowledge with existing expertise is the essence of innovation.  New 
14:317:26810:28:28:71:542:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:industries  typically  begin  with  new  firm  formation  and  the  efforts  of  entrepreneurs.    Some  of 
14:318:26918:28:27:71:542:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:these  new  start-ups  will  be  gazelles  in  terms  of  rapid  growth,  creating  new  industries  and 
14:319:27023:27:28:71:542:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:disrupting existing firms in their wake.  Most will be smaller players that will operate in a niche 
14:320:27123:28:27:71:329:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for which the firm has some competitive advantage.   
14:321:27176:27:28:107:542:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:What is low cost in the context of jurisdictional advantage?  It is not low wages, which is 
14:322:27268:28:28:71:542:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  first  thing  that  comes  to  mind.    A  low-wage  jurisdictional  strategy  is  like  a  low  price 
14:323:27376:28:27:71:542:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:company strategy.  It does not produce advantage.  At a company, a low price strategy produces 
14:324:27471:27:28:71:542:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:low  profits  for  the  shareholders  and  is  dangerous  because  it  leaves  the  company  vulnerable  to 
14:325:27579:28:27:71:542:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:being  out-invested  by  high-profit  competitors.  In  a  jurisdiction,  a  low  wage  strategy  produces 
14:326:27686:27:28:71:542:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wages that are lower than the average of other jurisdictions which connotes disadvantage for its 
14:327:27783:28:28:71:190:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:residents not advantage. 
14:328:27808:28:27:107:542:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Approaches  centered  on  industrial  recruitment  with  special  tax  incentives  and  various 
14:329:27904:27:28:71:542:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:other  inducements  to  lower  the  costs  of  doing  business  for  firms  are  not  low  cost  strategies 
14:330:28012:28:27:71:542:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:either. There is absolutely nothing unique or hard to replicate in terms of giving dollars away to 
14:331:28111:27:28:71:545:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firms.    The  evidence  is  that  this  type  of  strategy  is  a  race  to  the  bottom  in  a  zero-sum  game.  
14:332:28226:28:0:71:542:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:There  is  no  evidence  that  it  leads  eventually  to  higher  wages,  which  is  the  measure  of  a 
15:333:28333:0:28:71:542:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:successful  low  cost  jurisdictional  strategy.    Moreover,  these  types  of  operations  are  frequently 
15:334:28442:28:28:71:336:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the first to be closed when the cost structure changes.   
15:335:28500:28:27:107:542:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A  successful  low  cost  jurisdictional  strategy  would  exist  if  a  jurisdiction  produces  an 
15:336:28600:27:28:71:542:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equivalent  environment  to  other  jurisdictions  but  at  a  lower  cost.    For  example,  the  city  of 
15:337:28708:28:27:71:542:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Edmonton,  Alberta  has  produced  a  K-12  educational  system  that  generates  among  the  highest 
15:338:28810:27:28:71:542:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:results  of  any  North  American  jurisdiction  and  it  accomplished  this  superior  outcome  with 
15:339:28912:28:28:71:542:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:below-average costs through unique approaches to management of the system (Chen and Mintz 
15:340:29002:28:27:71:542:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2004).  This  allows  Edmonton  to  charge  lower  personal  taxes,  other  things  being  equal,  which 
15:341:29107:27:28:71:539:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:increases the after-tax wages of residents, enhancing the competitive outcome of the jurisdiction. 
15:342:29206:28:27:107:542:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A differentiated jurisdictional strategy exists when a set of activities produces a uniquely 
15:343:29299:27:28:71:542:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:attractive  environment  for  a  given  segment  of  job-providing  entities  at  a  similar  cost  to  other 
15:344:29409:28:28:71:542:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:jurisdictions  yet  with  greater  potential  benefits.    An  example  is  the  externalities  available  to  a 
15:345:29522:28:27:71:542:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:biotech firm by locating near a number of industry-leading biotech firms already operating in the 
15:346:29620:27:28:71:542:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:greater-Boston area.  These externalities are outside of the ability of markets to price but there is 
15:347:29722:28:27:71:542:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:evidence  to  suggest  that  firms  gain  economic  value  from  them.    Firms  are  simply  more 
15:348:29821:27:28:71:542:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:productive in certain locations, better able to innovate and create unique value.  It is this greater 
15:349:29923:28:28:71:388:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:productivity that translates into higher profits and higher wages.

15:353:30043:28:27:89:545:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The  next  concern  is  how  a  jurisdiction  may  position  itself  to  capture  economic  growth.  
15:354:30144:27:28:71:542:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Economic growth is not easy to capture: there are no guarantees. But the emerging literatures on 
15:355:30241:28:28:71:542:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:growth   theory   and   the   new   economic   geography   offer   some   insights   that   may   shape 
15:356:30345:28:0:71:542:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:jurisdictional advantage.  This literature is informed by the microeconomics of innovation which 
16:357:30444:0:28:71:542:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:suggests  the  importance  of  skilled  labor  and  the  mix  or  composition  of  activities  within  a 
16:358:30549:28:28:71:542:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:jurisdiction’s activity system.  The success of a firm and the success of the region are interrelated 
16:359:30651:28:27:71:542:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and  endogenous  in  the  terminology  of  economics  and  this  is  the  basis  of  jurisdictional  strategy 
16:360:30761:27:28:71:152:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and advantage.   
16:361:30778:28:27:107:542:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Economists  have  long  known  that  industries  cluster  spatially  for  a  variety  of  reasons: 
16:362:30877:27:28:71:542:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:what  is  critical  is  that  these  clustered  industries  tend  to  be  more  innovative  and  have  greater 
16:363:30988:28:28:71:542:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:productivity which is why we observe wage premia for such clusters.  An important distinction is 
16:364:31085:28:27:71:542:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:between the geographic concentrations of production and the location of innovation. Whereas the 
16:365:31181:27:28:71:542:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:geographic concentrations of production is often due to the location or natural resources, ease of 
16:366:31280:28:27:71:542:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:transportation  or  historical  inertia,  the  location  of  innovation  is  due  to  knowledge  externalities 
16:367:31391:27:28:71:542:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and subject to increasing returns. While innovation yields greater productivity and the increases 
16:368:31489:28:28:71:542:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in wages that jurisdictions seek, jobs associated with routine production remain geographically in 
16:369:31588:28:27:71:542:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:place  as  long  as  the  physical  investments  are  economically  viable.      Once  physical  assets  are 
16:370:31697:27:28:71:542:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:depreciated or obsolete, if the market changes or costs become uncompetitive, these locations are 
16:371:31795:28:27:71:457:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:easily abandoned.  As a result, property values fall and the jurisdiction suffers.   
16:372:31880:27:28:107:542:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The idea that location is beneficial to firms’ innovative success is central to theorizing in 
16:373:31974:28:28:71:542:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:economic  geography  about the benefits of cities.   Certain locations supply localized knowledge 
16:374:32072:28:27:71:542:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:externalities  or  spillovers  that  provide  positive  economic  value  but  are  beyond  the  ability  of 
16:375:32180:27:28:71:542:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:market  mechanisms  to  price  and  efficiently  allocate.    The  significance  of  localized  knowledge 
16:376:32286:28:27:71:542:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:spillovers  as  inputs  to  firms’  innovative  activities  suggest  that  their  most  creative  and  highest 
16:377:32397:27:28:71:542:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:value-added activities do not proceed in isolation, but depend on access to new ideas.  Location 
16:378:32494:28:28:71:542:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mitigates the inherent uncertainty of innovative activity: proximity enhances the ability of firms 
16:379:32593:28:0:71:542:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to   exchange   ideas   and   be   cognizant   of   important   incipient   knowledge,   hence   reducing 
17:380:32701:0:28:71:542:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:uncertainty  for  firms  that  work  in  new  fields.  Innovation  clusters  spatially  where  knowledge 
17:381:32806:28:28:71:542:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:externalities  reduce  the  costs  of  scientific  discovery  and  commercialization.  In  addition,  firms 
17:382:32914:28:27:71:542:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:producing innovations tend to be located in areas where there are necessary resources: resources 
17:383:33011:27:28:71:542:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that have accumulated due to a region’s past success with innovation.  In  this way, firm success 
17:384:33109:28:27:71:542:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and  city  economic  growth  are  endogenous  and  mutually  dependent.    The  cumulative  nature  of 
17:385:33212:27:28:71:542:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:innovation  manifests  itself  not  just  at  firm  and  industry  levels,  but  also  at  the  geographic  level, 
17:386:33327:28:28:71:542:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:creating  an  advantage  for  firms  locating  in  areas  of  concentrated  innovative  activity.    These 
17:387:33434:28:27:71:542:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:factors  can  generate  positive  feedback  loops  or  virtuous  cycles,  as  clusters  attract  additional 
17:388:33542:27:28:71:445:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:specialized labor and other inputs, as well as the greater exchanges of ideas.   
17:389:33623:28:27:107:542:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Economists  and  strategists  are  getting  better  at  understanding  the  dynamics  of  path 
17:390:33718:27:28:71:542:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dependence  and  increasing  returns,  both  of  which  describe  aspects  of  the  dynamics  of  cluster 
17:391:33824:28:28:71:542:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:growth  in  a  given  jurisdiction.    Path  dependency  implies  that  the  course  of  technological 
17:392:33927:28:27:71:542:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:development or technological trajectory of specific localities is historically determined and may 
17:393:34025:27:28:71:539:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:be  the  result  of  serendipity  or  small  events.    Krugman  (1990)  uses  the  example  of  candle-
17:394:34129:28:27:71:542:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wicking, a type of local craft, as a source of  competitive advantage in the carpet industry  and a 
17:395:34229:27:28:71:542:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reason why the industry located in Alabama.  Through such examples, the literature suggests that 
17:396:34326:28:28:71:542:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:clusters  are  seeded  by  a  variety  of  methods;  however,  their  growth  can  only  be  facilitated  by 
17:397:34435:28:27:71:489:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:building upon existing resources. Clusters cannot be built just anywhere from scratch.  
17:398:34523:27:28:89:542:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Successful  jurisdictions  are  characterized  by  a  rich  ecology  of  firms  and  institutions  which 
17:399:34628:28:27:71:542:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:form  a  specialized  activity  set.    A  good  example  is  Carlsson’s  (2002)  study  of  the  polymer 
17:400:34734:27:28:71:542:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cluster in Akron, Ohio which consists of a combination of numerous and diverse small firms as 
17:401:34828:28:28:71:542:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:well  as  larger,  multinational  firms.    Rosenthal  and  Strange  (2003)  find  that  agglomeration 
17:402:34931:28:0:71:542:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:benefits are greater with a larger number of small firms:  the marginal effect of an employee at a 
18:403:35032:0:28:71:542:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:small establishment is greater than that of an employee at a large firm.  This finding suggests that 
18:404:35133:28:28:71:542:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:small  establishments  make  better  neighbors  and  increase  a  nearby  firm’s  own  productivity.    In 
18:405:35240:28:27:71:542:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:addition,  Carlsson  (2002)  found  that  while  the  multinationals  have  shifted  their  production 
18:406:35343:27:28:71:542:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:facilities  elsewhere,  they  have  kept  their  polymer  R&D  facilities  and  operation  headquarters  in 
18:407:35451:28:27:71:542:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the area and close to the top three polymer research institutions in the United States from whom 
18:408:35548:27:28:71:286:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:they source research and hire skilled labor.   
18:409:35595:28:28:107:542:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: Skilled  workers,  known  in  the  literature  as  human  capital,  or  alternatively  as  talent,  are 
18:410:35700:28:27:71:542:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:important to geographic clustering.  Baker and Trefler (2003) confirm that human capital is more 
18:411:35797:27:28:71:542:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:productive  in  cities.    Cities  act  as  magnets  for  human  capital  and  individuals  living  in  cities 
18:412:35908:28:27:71:542:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:receive a wage premium when compared to similar individuals.  Labor is less mobile than capital 
18:413:36004:27:28:71:542:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and workers become more skilled as they age but then correspondingly become more immobile 
18:414:36094:28:28:71:542:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:as they form relationships, raise families and become members of communities.  One important 
18:415:36187:28:27:71:542:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:advantage  of  geographic  clustering  is  that  it  provides  pools  of  skilled  labor  which  are  mutually 
18:416:36298:27:28:71:542:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:beneficial as firms can easily find specialized skilled labor and workers can advance their careers 
18:417:36398:28:27:71:401:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:by moving between firms without incurring the costs of relocating.   
18:418:36467:27:28:107:542:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Within these pools of skilled labor there are potential entrepreneurs who may take ideas 
18:419:36556:28:28:71:542:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:out   of   established   firms   to   form   new   enterprises.      An   observed   anecdote   fact   about 
18:420:36665:28:27:71:542:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:entrepreneurship  is  that  individuals  do  not  relocate  to  start  firms  but  instead  use  existing  local 
18:421:36778:27:28:71:542:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:contacts  and  networks  to  start  their  firms  (Feldman  2001).    This  form  of  locational  inertia 
18:422:36884:28:27:71:542:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:indicates that regions that hold stocks of potential entrepreneurs are more likely to be successful 
18:423:36984:27:28:71:542:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:at promoting new firm start-ups and establishing new industries.  Innovative start-ups frequently 
18:424:37082:28:28:71:545:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:create  new  markets  where  no  competition  exists  and  demand  is  not  sensitive  to  product  costs.  
18:425:37190:28:0:71:542:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Small  firms  frequently  become  the  mechanism  by  which  a  new  technology  is  commercialized 
19:426:37292:0:28:71:545:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and  their  competitive  advantage  lies  in  being  first  to  market  or  offer  a  higher-quality  product.  
19:427:37404:28:28:71:542:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Lacking the resources of their larger counterparts, small firms must leverage capabilities in their 
19:428:37504:28:27:71:175:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:local environments.   
19:429:37526:27:28:107:542:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The  composition  of  activities  in  a  jurisdictional  activity  system  matters.    Jacobs  (1969) 
19:430:37628:28:27:71:542:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:argues  that  diversity  is  important  for  innovation  and  that  cities  are  the  source  of  considerable 
19:431:37739:27:28:71:542:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:innovation because the diversity of knowledge is greatest in cities. According to Jacobs, it is the 
19:432:37839:28:28:71:542:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:exchange of complementary knowledge across diverse firms and economic agents which yield a 
19:433:37930:28:27:71:542:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:greater  return  to  economic  activity.    Feldman  and  Audretsch  (1999)  find  that  diversity  across 
19:434:38037:27:28:71:542:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:complementary  economic  activities  sharing  a  common  science  base  is  more  conducive  to 
19:435:38133:28:27:71:542:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:innovation  than  is local specialisation.  In  addition,  their  results  indicate  that  the  degree  of  local 
19:436:38247:27:28:71:542:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:competition for new ideas within a city is more  conducive to innovative  activity than in a local 
19:437:38346:28:28:71:542:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:monopoly.   Indeed, we may expect that if a local economy becomes too dependent on one firm 
19:438:38438:28:27:71:542:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:or  one  industry  it  may  drive  out  new  ideas.    Florida  and  Gates  (2002)  argue  further  that  a  rich 
19:439:38552:27:28:71:542:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cultural environment in a jurisdiction is correlated with economic success of the city.  They use 
19:440:38650:28:27:71:542:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  share  of  workers  in  artistic  industries  such  as  writers,  dancers,  painters,  and  others  as  an 
19:441:38762:27:28:71:542:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:indicator of cultural richness and find a correlation with economic success.  In addition, they also 
19:442:38863:28:28:71:542:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:find  a  link  between  the  levels  of  open-mindedness  in  a  jurisdiction  to  be  correlated  with 
19:443:38967:28:27:71:172:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:economic success.    
19:444:38988:27:28:107:542:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Porter  (1990)  studied  clusters  around  the  world  and  we  now  know  the  features  of  a 
19:445:39084:28:27:71:542:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:jurisdictional environment in which clusters grow. Porter described clusters as a local “diamond” 
19:446:39182:27:28:71:542:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:–  representing  the  beneficial  interaction  of  1)  demanding  and  sophisticated  local  customers;  2) 
19:447:39290:28:28:71:542:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:intense  rivalry  among  local  firms;  3)  local  presence  of  attractive  factors  of  production;  and  4) 
19:448:39401:28:0:71:542:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:local  presence  of  relating  and  supporting  industries.    These  four  factors  interact  to  drive 
20:449:39508:0:28:71:542:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:continuous innovation and upgrading of the nature of advantage by the firms in the cluster. We 
20:450:39603:28:28:71:542:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are also learning how clusters interact with each other – that is, the clustering of clusters (Porter 
20:451:39705:28:27:71:542:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2003).  Certain clusters, for example, education and knowledge creation; analytical instruments, 
20:452:39802:27:28:71:542:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:aerospace   vehicles   and   defense;   communications   equipment;   information   technology;   and 
20:453:39904:28:27:71:542:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:medical devices appear to cluster with together.  The synergies between these industries provide 
20:454:40001:27:28:71:542:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:unique  activity  sets,  and  areas  with  multiple  and  overlapping  clusters  of  expertise  facilitate  the 
20:455:40113:28:28:71:542:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:emergence    of    new    industries    such    as    nanotechnology,    bioinformatics    and    advanced 
20:456:40220:28:27:71:183:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:telecommunications.    
20:457:40243:27:28:107:542:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:It  is  clear  that  jurisdictional  strategy  is  not  a  winner-take-all  phenomenon  in  which  a 
20:458:40344:28:27:71:542:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:single  city  comes  to  dominate.    No  jurisdiction  found  on  the  planet  is  good  at  most  industries. 
20:459:40456:27:28:71:545:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Each jurisdictional activity system appears to be tuned for certain industries and not for others.  .  
20:460:40559:28:28:71:542:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Moreover,  cities  are  part  of  the  system  of  cities  or  what  urban  economists  call  an  urban 
20:461:40663:28:27:71:542:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:hierarchy:  every  city  has  a  unique  niche  that  is  interrelated  to  other  cities.    Puga  and  Duranton 
20:462:40777:27:28:71:542:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(2001)  find  that  new  products  tend  to  be  developed  in  large,  diversified  cities  which  they  term 
20:463:40888:28:27:71:542:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nursery  cities,  the  places  where  new  products  are  incubated.    Once  an  idea  is  refined,  the  firm 
20:464:41000:27:28:71:542:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:invests in more specialized, smaller cities where  production costs are lower due to an  emphasis 
20:465:41098:28:28:71:542:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on  process  innovation  and  learning-by-doing.    Each  type  of  innovation  requires  a  different  mix 
20:466:41206:28:27:71:542:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of  skills;  however,  innovations  are  complementary  and  each  has  a  role  to  play  in  competitive 
20:467:41313:27:28:71:131:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:advantage.   
20:468:41326:28:27:107:542:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:However,  it  does  appear  in  North  America  at  least,  that  very  large  cities  foster  the 
20:469:41425:27:28:71:542:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:clustering of clusters,  which produces even higher wage levels than would be expected under a 
20:470:41520:28:28:71:542:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:straight  line  regression  (Institute  for  Competitiveness  &  Prosperity  2003).    This  also  appears  to 
20:471:41631:28:0:71:542:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:be the case in the U.K., with London emerging as a cluster of clusters.  Very few cities will be at 
21:472:41733:0:28:71:542:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  top  tier  of  the  urban  hierarchy;  however,  every  jurisdictional  activity  set  has  a  place  in  the 
21:473:41848:28:28:71:542:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:hierarchy.    Understanding how a city is positioned relative to other cities, not in a  competitive 
21:474:41949:28:27:71:520:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sense but in terms of mutual dependence and differentiation offer a potential strategic lever.   
21:475:42046:27:28:107:542:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Uniqueness   and   adaptation,   not   uniformity   and   replication,   provide   jurisdictional 
21:476:42144:28:27:71:542:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:advantage.    In  corporate  strategy,  if  all  competitors  simply  benchmark  against  each  other  and 
21:477:42251:27:28:71:542:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:replicate what each other is doing, there  will be no advantage  and the benefits will  flow to the 
21:478:42351:28:28:71:545:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:customers,  who  will  simply  play  off  the  look-alike  firms  against  each  other  to  suppress  prices.  
21:479:42462:28:27:71:542:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Exactly the same principle may be expected to hold for jurisdictions.  Competive advantage and 
21:480:42557:27:28:71:542:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:economic  growth  may  come  from  the  creation  of  unique  activity  systems,  not  from  simply 
21:481:42657:28:27:71:542:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:replicating   one   another.   Benchmarking   is   currently   a   very   popular   notion   in   economic 
21:482:42764:27:28:71:542:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:development  policy,  but  the  problem  with  benchmarking  is  that  it  appears  to  encourage 
21:483:42862:28:28:71:468:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:duplication and uniformity, not diversity and the exploration of unique advantage.

21:485:42945:14:13:71:312:363:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The Role of Firms in Jurisdictional Advantage 
21:486:42991:13:14:71:74:350:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4: 
21:487:42991:14:28:107:542:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:There is a big question as to the role of firms in jurisdictional advantage. A firm can act 
21:488:43083:28:27:71:542:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:simply  as  a  taker  and  exploiter  of  a  jurisdiction.    However,  a  firm  is  better  served  by  being  an 
21:489:43198:27:28:71:542:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:active  partner  in  jurisdictional  advantage  rather  than  a  passive  taker.    As  soon  as  it  has  made 
21:490:43310:28:27:71:542:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:investments  in  a  jurisdiction,  it  has  an  incentive  to  make  the  jurisdiction  better  so  that  the 
21:491:43420:27:28:71:328:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:jurisdiction provides more advantages in the future.   
21:492:43475:28:28:107:542:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Moreover, the existence of externalities suggests that firms are receiving benefits that are 
21:493:43568:28:27:71:542:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:outside of the market mechanism to price.  While it may be argued that firms pay more taxes as a 
21:494:43665:27:28:71:542:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:result of the higher profits they earn as a result of externalities, it may also be argued that firms 
21:495:43767:28:27:71:542:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:may actively cultivate the sources of the agglomerative benefit by investing in local universities, 
21:496:43867:27:0:71:542:88:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:building infrastructure, etc.  Moreover, these investments are tax deductible and provide a means 
22:497:43967:0:28:71:542:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to  make  targeted  investments  in  jurisdictions  rather  than  relying  on  the  process  of  government 
22:498:44075:28:28:71:542:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:budgeting.  This is to say that firms may actively build the external resources and infrastructure 
22:499:44174:28:27:71:220:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that benefit their bottom line.   
22:500:44208:27:28:107:542:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:There  is  case  study  evidence  that  in  the  process  of  building  their  firm  expertise, 
22:501:44304:28:27:71:542:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:entrepreneurs  also  contribute  to  building  external  resources  and  institutions  that  promote  their 
22:502:44412:27:28:71:542:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:business interest.  In the process of building their firms, entrepreneurs contribute to growing the 
22:503:44512:28:28:71:542:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cluster  (Feldman  2001).  Sponsoring  research  at  local  universities,  endowing  university  training 
22:504:44618:28:27:71:542:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:programs and networking all benefit the initiating firm but also create externalities that will have 
22:505:44719:27:28:71:542:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:local benefit. As entrepreneurial businesses begin to thrive, resources such as money, networks, 
22:506:44816:28:27:71:542:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:experts, and related services develop in, and are attracted to, the region. With this infrastructure 
22:507:44917:27:28:71:542:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in  place,  more  entrepreneurial  ventures  locate  and  thrive  in  the  region,  which  ultimately  may 
22:508:45024:28:28:71:339:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:create a thriving cluster where none previously existed. 
22:509:45081:28:27:107:542:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In addition, there are interesting interplays between firms  and the average wage level of 
22:510:45172:27:28:71:542:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:residents of the jurisdiction.  In many senses, the better definition of advantage may be the total 
22:511:45272:28:27:71:542:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:utility  of  residents,  which  includes  non-pecuniary  benefits  as  well  as  monetary  benefits.    Firms 
22:512:45382:27:28:71:542:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:can positively influence the overall welfare of residents in the jurisdiction by showing aspects of 
22:513:45482:28:28:71:542:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:social  responsibility  which  produce  externalities  that  further  enhance  the  jurisdiction  and  also 
22:514:45590:28:27:71:152:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:benefit the firm. 
22:515:45608:27:28:71:542:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Corporate outsourcing is also interesting in its relation to jurisdictional advantage. Outsourcing is 
22:516:45710:28:27:71:542:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:not  an  issue  of  jurisdictional  advantage  or  disadvantage  per  se.    Bangalore  does  not  have 
22:517:45814:27:28:71:542:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:jurisdictional  advantage  over  Silicon  Valley.    Bangalore  is  a  price  leader,  not  a  cost  leader.    It 
22:518:45929:28:28:71:542:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:produces  dramatically  lower  wage  levels  than  Silicon  Valley,  so  in  this  respect  it  is  highly 
22:519:46036:28:0:71:542:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:disadvantaged.    (Even  as  Bangalore  is  powerfully  advantaged  over  other  parts  of  India.)This  is 
23:520:46146:0:28:71:542:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:not jurisdictional as much as it is individual.  It turns out that many rote programmers, call centre 
23:521:46248:28:28:71:542:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:attendants,  etc.  are  learning  to  their  dismay  that  thanks  to  falling  telecommunications  and 
23:522:46352:28:27:71:542:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:coordination  costs,  the  clearing  price  for  their  skill-set  in  Silicon  Valley  is  a  fraction  of  what  it 
23:523:46470:27:28:71:126:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:used to be. 
23:524:46482:28:27:107:542:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:An  issue,  however,  is  whether  the  firm  has  a  responsibility  to  its  jurisdiction  not  to 
23:525:46583:27:28:71:542:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:outsource because of the dislocation costs that outsourcing causes.  There is no clear answer on 
23:526:46680:28:28:71:542:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:this  issue.   What  is  clear  is  that  as  firms  outsource  jobs  from  Silicon  Valley  to  Bangalore,  they 
23:527:46794:28:27:71:542:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are reducing the number of existing high wage jobs in Silicon Valley.  The question is whether 
23:528:46889:27:28:71:542:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:they can create an equal number of new high paying jobs locally.  If they can’t, the employment 
23:529:46985:28:27:71:542:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:base in Silicon Valley will drop.  To the extent that the jurisdiction benefited from the economies 
23:530:47085:27:28:71:542:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of scale associated with large numbers of skilled workers, firms that engage in the net export of 
23:531:47183:28:28:71:516:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:high-paying jobs may negatively impact the jurisdictional advantage of their home territory. 
23:532:47276:28:27:107:542:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We may ask what firms lose when they outsource.  There are various historical examples, 
23:533:47364:27:28:71:542:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:such   as   semiconductors,   where   the   countries   that   were   the   site   of   outsourcing   became 
23:534:47473:28:27:71:542:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:competitors in subsequent rounds of product development.  What is lost in outsourcing may be a 
23:535:47568:27:28:71:542:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:familiarity with production and product design that suggest the next round of innovation (Pisano 
23:536:47665:28:28:71:542:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:1995).  Chesbrough and Teece (1996) argue that outsourcing may hamper the kind of complex, 
23:537:47756:28:27:71:481:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:systematic innovation that creates new generation valuable business breakthroughs.

23:540:47896:14:14:71:74:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: 
23:541:47896:14:27:107:542:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The challenge for jurisdictional advantage is the translation of theory into practical policy 
23:542:47990:27:28:71:542:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:terms.    Many  existing  recommendations  are  far  too  generic,  emphasizing  the  desirability  of 
23:543:48093:28:27:71:542:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:having  an  educated,  creative,  and  productively  efficient  workforce,  along  with  strong  physical 
23:544:48199:27:0:71:542:88:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:infrastructure and great centers for research and teaching. Specific recommendations are usually 
24:545:48298:0:28:71:542:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:based on reinforcing those activities that a location is currently specialized in – in other  words, 
24:546:48399:28:28:71:487:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:those economic sectors and activities that make up a high share of a city’s activities.    
24:547:48490:28:27:107:542:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Jurisdictional   advantage   depends   on   an   additional   criterion:      those   activities   and 
24:548:48593:27:28:71:542:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:capabilities  which,  in  combination,  create  a  uniquely  favorable  jurisdiction  for  some  set  of 
24:549:48698:28:27:71:542:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:industries.  While generic capabilities are important, there are far too many locations that satisfy 
24:550:48799:27:28:71:542:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:basic  criteria:  a  highly  educated  workforce,  by  itself,  is  no  guarantee  for  a  city-specific 
24:551:48904:28:28:71:131:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:advantage.   
24:552:48917:28:27:107:542:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Similarly, simply being specialized in an activity does not mean that a region has a strong 
24:553:49009:27:28:71:542:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:advantage in that activity. As we have shown earlier, a jurisdiction can have a disproportionately 
24:554:49108:28:27:71:542:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:high  number  of  jobs  in  a  given  cluster  and  still  have  below  average  wage  levels  in  that  cluster. 
24:555:49222:27:28:71:542:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Instead,  jurisdictional  advantage  could  be  established  and  maintained  by  implementing  policies 
24:556:49327:28:28:71:334:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that enhance unique and location-specific capabilities. 
24:557:49383:28:27:107:542:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In this context, a key question is in what practical, action-oriented ways can jurisdictions 
24:558:49476:27:28:71:542:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:build  a  coherent  activity  system?      Given  the  importance  of  the  private  choices  of  firms  and 
24:559:49585:28:27:71:542:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:employees,  it  is  unlikely  that  successful  jurisdictional  activity  systems  will  be  built  exclusively 
24:560:49697:27:28:71:542:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:or  even  primarily  by  governments.  Most  likely,  it  will  require  the  cooperation  of  governments 
24:561:49804:28:28:71:542:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and  firms.    An  important  responsibility  for  governments  will  be  to  create  incentives  that 
24:562:49907:28:27:71:542:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:encourage  firms  and  talented  employees  to  take  positive  cluster  and  jurisdiction-building 
24:563:50007:27:28:71:123:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:activities.  
24:564:50020:28:27:107:542:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Taxation policy is likely to be critical.  It is unlikely that bidding wars based on targeted 
24:565:50114:27:28:71:542:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tax relief to attract a firm to the jurisdiction may create a positive benefit because of the ability of 
24:566:50219:28:28:71:542:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:other jurisdictions to provide the same benefits.    A tax system that understands the needs of the 
24:567:50319:28:0:71:542:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:specific  clusters  of  interest  for  the  jurisdiction  is  most  likely  to  produce  beneficial  results.    For 
25:568:50438:0:28:71:542:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:example,  tradable  tax  credits  allow  start-up  firms  to  sell  their  net  operating  losses  and  research 
25:569:50551:28:28:71:542:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and development spending to profitable companies or selling the credits back to the state.   Mintz 
25:570:50650:28:27:71:542:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(2001)  argues  that  the  marginal  tax  burden  on  capital  and  labor  prevalent  in  a  jurisdiction 
25:571:50756:27:28:71:542:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:influences its prosperity.  Therefore spending programs that are designed to attract firms (directly 
25:572:50857:28:27:71:542:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:or indirectly) may benefit from empirical analysis that quantifies the purported positive impacts 
25:573:50955:27:28:71:542:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:netted  against  their  costs  in  terms  of  higher  marginal  tax  burden  in  order  to  ascertain  whether 
25:574:51066:28:28:71:299:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:these incentives produce net benefits or costs.   
25:575:51116:28:27:107:542:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:One  element  that  has  no  chance  of  being  unique  is  the  payment  of  cash  incentives  to 
25:576:51215:27:28:71:542:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firms.  Cash  is  completely  fungible  and  for  that  reason,  it  is  the  easiest  feature  for  another 
25:577:51324:28:27:71:542:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:jurisdiction  to  match.    Further,  cash  used  as  an  incentive  has  no  effective  leverage.    It  costs 
25:578:51436:27:28:71:542:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:residents  of  the  jurisdiction  dollar  for  dollar  against  potential  personal  after-tax  income  rather 
25:579:51547:28:28:71:542:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:than, for example, a badly needed bridge which has the prospect of earning a very high return on 
25:580:51644:28:27:71:176:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the investment made. 
25:581:51665:27:28:107:542:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The  evidence  is  that  firm  location  decisions  are  not  responsive  to  jurisdictional  tax 
25:582:51763:28:27:71:542:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:differentials except at the intra-metropolitan area (Bartik 1991, Papke 1991).   This suggests that 
25:583:51863:27:28:71:542:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:individual  municipalities  may  gain  if  they  drop  their  tax  rates  or  offer  special  incentives.    Of 
25:584:51975:28:28:71:542:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:course,  this  creates  artificial  competition.    Individual  municipalities  may  benefit  if  they  view 
25:585:52084:28:27:71:546:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:themselves as subsidiaries or divisions of the larger city and cooperate to their mutual advantage.   
25:586:52186:27:28:107:542:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In  the  knowledge-based  economy,  social  policy  may  not  be  discounted  as  something 
25:587:52278:28:27:71:542:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:alien  to  jurisdictional  advantage.    It  appears  to  be  an  integral  part  of  jurisdictional  strategy 
25:588:52389:27:28:71:542:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(Porter 1999, Florida and Gates 2002).  Attributes that make a jurisdiction an attractive place for 
25:589:52489:28:28:71:542:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:talented   workers   to   locate   are   powerful   elements   in   the   activity   system   of   successful 
25:590:52599:28:0:71:542:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:jurisdictions.  The question, as always in jurisdictional strategy, is whether a given social policy 
26:591:52702:0:28:71:542:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:creates  more  benefit  in  raising  the  psychic  income  and  quality  of  life  of  residents  than  it  takes 
26:592:52816:28:28:71:278:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:away in the taxation required to support it. 
26:593:52861:28:27:107:542:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In  establishing  policy,  jurisdictions  will  have  to  find  ways  to  be  as  nimble  as  the  firms 
26:594:52966:27:28:71:542:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:they  host.  Successful  firms  are  constantly  remaking  themselves  and  reinventing  their  core 
26:595:53067:28:27:71:542:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:businesses in response to changing market conditions.  Many times it is easier for them to move 
26:596:53163:27:28:71:542:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to  a  new  location  rather  than  work  with  the  confines  of  an  existing  jurisdiction.  It  might  be 
26:597:53273:28:28:71:542:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:incumbent on jurisdictions to change that equation by being responsive and open to working with 
26:598:53369:28:27:71:542:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:their resident firms.  A frequent complaint is that local government only  pay attention to a firm 
26:599:53468:27:28:71:500:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:when it threatens to leave, rather than cultivating an on-going relationship with the firm.  
26:600:53561:28:27:107:542:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Jurisdictional  advantage  is  not  simply  the  battle  for  high  technology  industries.    In  no 
26:601:53663:27:28:71:542:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:jurisdiction do high technology industries make  up a majority of jobs. Even in high-technology 
26:602:53759:28:28:71:542:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:states such as Massachusetts and California, high-technology clusters account for less than 20% 
26:603:53855:28:27:71:542:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of jobs (Institute for Competitiveness & Prosperity 2003).  While high technology clusters may 
26:604:53950:27:28:71:542:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:be  attractive,  there  is  as  much  to  be  gained  by  creating  a  unique  activity  system  for  a  non-high 
26:605:54064:28:27:71:542:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:technology cluster as to replicate the features of numerous other jurisdictions that are pining after 
26:606:54166:27:28:71:207:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:high technology industries.  
26:607:54195:28:28:107:542:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Cities remake themselves over time, reflecting structural change in the economy. Glaeser 
26:608:54284:28:27:71:542:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(2003)  shows  how  Boston  has  been  able  to  remake  its  economy  three  times  since  the  Colonial 
26:609:54390:27:28:71:542:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:period,  due  to  the  availability  of  local  skilled  capital.  Of  course,  these  transitions  are  costly  to 
26:610:54506:28:27:71:542:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:individuals and their families when skill sets become obsolete and jobs disappear. This reiterates 
26:611:54605:27:28:71:542:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  importance  of  social  policy  as  a  backbone  of  industrial  competitiveness  and  economic 
26:612:54706:28:0:71:117:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:growth.   
27:613:54718:0:28:107:542:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In  corporate  strategy,  there  is  an  immense  variety  of  activity  systems  that  provide 
27:614:54814:28:28:71:542:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:competitive advantage. It is likely to be the case with jurisdictional strategy.  While many firms 
27:615:54913:28:27:71:542:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:look  longingly  at  Walmart  or  Dell  and  decide  they  need  to  pursue  a  “Walmart  strategy”  or  a 
27:616:55020:27:28:71:542:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:“Dell  strategy”,  they  are  much  more  likely  to  produce  a  successful  strategy  by  pursuing  an 
27:617:55125:28:27:71:542:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:approach that is tailored to particular circumstance and assets.  Similarly, jurisdictions that try to 
27:618:55228:27:28:71:542:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:be  the  next  Boston  or  Silicon  Valley  may  be  pursuing  the  wrong  approach  to  jurisdictional 
27:619:55332:28:28:71:542:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:advantage.    Any  commitments  of  resources  to  an  activity  involve  trade-offs  against  other 
27:620:55433:28:27:71:542:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:opportunities.      We   have   suggested   that   building   jurisdictional   advantage   necessitates   an 
27:621:55542:27:28:71:542:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:understanding  of  what  not  to  do  and  how  investments  detract  from  the  coherence  of  the 
27:622:55642:28:27:71:542:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:jurisdictional  activity  set:  policy-makers  will  be  required  to  investigate  further  into  just  how  to 
27:623:55755:27:28:71:338:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:do this at the particular sites they make decisions for.    
27:624:55815:28:28:107:542:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:As with the multiplicity of outcomes of jurisdictional strategy, there are likely to be many 
27:625:55908:28:27:71:542:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:different  models  that  emerge  with  respect  to  how  jurisdictions  organize  themselves  to  facilitate 
27:626:56017:27:28:71:542:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  creation  and  implementation  of  jurisdictional  strategies.    Cities  are  far  from  homogeneous 
27:627:56124:28:27:71:542:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with  different  functional  and  industrial  specialization,  each  with  a  unique  position  relative  to 
27:628:56233:27:28:71:542:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:other cities in the economy.  Even more so than with corporate strategy, jurisdictional strategy is 
27:629:56333:28:28:71:542:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:likely  to  only  in  part  be  an  analytical,  top-down  exercise.    It  is  also  likely  to  be  an  intensely 
27:630:56449:28:27:71:542:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:social  consensus-building  exercise.    As  such,  the  role  of  political  leadership  in  jurisdictional 
27:631:56558:27:28:71:228:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:strategy is likely to be crucial.    
27:632:56595:28:27:107:542:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:At the national level, it will be increasingly important to understand the role of individual 
27:633:56689:27:28:71:542:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:city  jurisdictions  play  in  competitive  advantage.    If  a  nation  is  comprised  of  individual 
27:634:56792:28:28:71:542:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:jurisdictions – each following copy-cat strategies of using cash incentives to attempt to attract the 
27:635:56894:28:0:71:542:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:currently vogue industries (e.g. biotechnology or nanotechnology) to their jurisdiction rather than 
28:636:56996:0:28:71:543:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:another national jurisdiction – the nations’ prosperity potential will be diminished.  If instead, the 
28:637:57099:28:28:71:542:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nation is comprised of individual jurisdictions each attempting to create an activity system that is 
28:638:57200:28:27:71:542:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:uniquely beneficial to a  particular  cluster or  agglomeration of clusters by  investing in attributes 
28:639:57304:27:28:71:542:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that  make  it  particularly  attractive  to  firms  and  talent  in  those  clusters,  the  nation  will  have 
28:640:57416:28:27:71:542:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:increased prosperity potential.  In this paper we have argued that jurisdictions may benefit from a 
28:641:57516:27:28:71:542:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:strategic  orientation  that  considers  1)  the  unique  and  not  easily  replicated  assets,  resources  and 
28:642:57628:28:28:71:542:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:skill  set  contained  in  a  jurisdiction;  2)  the  position  of  the  jurisdiction  vis  a  vis  the  hierarchy  of 
28:643:57747:28:27:71:542:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cities  in  the  national  and  world  economy;  and  3)  maximizes  wages  and  property  values  within 
28:644:57853:27:28:71:542:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  juridiction.    What  we  have  suggested  is  that  the  role  of  jurisdictions  and  jurisdictional 
28:645:57961:28:28:71:315:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:advantage deserves a place on the policy agenda.

38:933:74127:23:23:71:541:594:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:encompasses  multiple  political  or  administrative  units.  Rather  than  viewing  themselves  in  competition  these  units 
38:934:74254:23:18:71:398:571:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:may be conceptualized as subsidiaries, divisions or subunits of a going concern.   
38:935:74337:18:28:71:529:553:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:2 The location quotient is calculated as the percentage of activity in a city and industry normalized by the national 
38:936:74455:28:23:71:527:525:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:percentage of activity in the industry.  A location quotient equal to one indicates that the activity is represented in 
38:937:74575:23:23:71:540:502:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the city exactly as mirrored in the national economy.  When the location quotient is greater than one the industry has 
38:938:74694:23:23:71:528:479:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:a greater representation in the city than would be expected and this is evidence of geographic concentration.   The 
38:939:74810:23:0:71:411:456:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:larger the location quotient, the greater the concentration of the industry in the city.
