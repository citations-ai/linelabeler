2:17:408:36:28:85:513:644:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Egypt suffers from low growth rates, increasing unemployment, poverty and a persistent 
2:18:495:28:27:85:513:616:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:shadow economy. Yet, Egypt is among the top 10 recipients of aid to promote economic 
2:19:580:27:28:85:513:589:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:development. Given this controversy, the purpose of this study is to examine the impact 
2:20:668:28:27:85:513:561:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:of the shadow economy on economic development and on aid effectiveness in Egypt from 
2:21:753:27:28:85:512:534:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:1976 to 2013. There is a limited number of studies focusing on aid-development nexus 
2:22:837:28:27:85:513:506:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:for the case of Egypt which are inconclusive of the main channels that influence this 
2:23:923:27:28:85:513:479:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:nexus. Therefore, this paper adds to the literature by intersecting the shadow economy as 
2:24:1013:28:28:85:513:451:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:an indirect channel affecting the aid-development nexus in Egypt. To this end, the fully 
2:25:1102:28:27:85:513:423:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:modified OLS methodology is applied. The results indicate that the shadow economy has 
2:26:1188:27:28:85:513:396:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:a  negative  impact  on  economic  development  and  a  diminishing  effect  on  aid 
2:27:1273:28:27:85:513:368:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:effectiveness. Because the effect of a change in aid on income is conditional on the size 
2:28:1363:27:28:85:513:341:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:of the shadow economy in Egypt, it is important to calculate the marginal effect of aid on 
2:29:1454:28:28:85:513:313:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:income for different values of the shadow economy. Based on the calculation of the 
2:30:1537:28:27:85:513:285:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:marginal effect, one can conclude that the effect of aid on income is reversed given the 
2:31:1626:27:28:85:513:258:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:presence of the shadow economy. The persistent existence of the shadow economy poses 
2:32:1711:28:27:85:513:230:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:a major challenge for policy makers due its depressing effect on economic development 
2:33:1797:27:36:85:210:203:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:and on aid effectiveness.

3:40:2137:0:22:85:165:745:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:B:1. Introduction 
3:41:2152:22:27:85:513:723:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:The effectiveness of aid for economic growth in developing countries is an important 
3:42:2237:27:28:85:513:696:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:debate for both for recipients and donors. Several  empirical studies have focused on 
3:43:2323:28:27:85:513:668:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:investigating the impact on and effectiveness of aid for development for many countries 
3:44:2411:27:28:85:513:641:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:and across different time spans. For instance, Dowling and Hiemenz (1982), Hansen and 
3:45:2497:28:28:85:513:613:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Trap  (2000),  Burnside  and  Dollar  (2000),  Dalgaard  et  al.  (2004)  and  Karras  (2006) 
3:46:2591:28:27:85:513:585:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:concluded that there is a positive impact of aid on economic growth. However, Boone 
3:47:2675:27:28:85:513:558:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:(1996), Williamson (2009), Remmer (2004) and Brautigam and Knack (2004) argued that 
3:48:2759:28:27:85:513:530:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:aid is ineffective and negatively impacts economic growth. While some authors such as 
3:49:2845:27:28:85:513:503:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Burnside  and  Dollar  (2000)  and  Collier  and  Dollar  (2002)  emphasized  that  the 
3:50:2933:28:28:85:513:475:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:effectiveness of aid is conditional, other authors, including Dalgraad and Hansen (2001), 
3:51:3023:28:27:85:513:447:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Hansen and Trap (2000) and Lenski and White (2001), have found decreasing returns of 
3:52:3108:27:28:85:513:420:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:aid on economic growth. Hence, we can conclude that the literature is mixed regarding 
3:53:3194:28:35:85:377:392:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:the impact on and effectiveness of aid for economic growth. 
3:54:3254:35:28:85:513:357:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Egypt is among the top 10 recipients of foreign aid. Among other forms of aid, Egypt has 
3:55:3343:28:28:85:513:329:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:received significant economic assistance from the US amounting to $76 billion in foreign 
3:56:3432:28:27:85:513:301:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:aid from 1948 to 20151. The objectives of this foreign aid were to improve public health, 
3:57:3522:27:28:85:513:274:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:education,  economic  development,  democracy  and  governance  (Sharp,  2017). 
3:58:3602:28:27:85:513:246:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Additionally, Egypt continues to be a major recipient of development aid (ODA). Since 
3:59:3688:27:28:85:513:219:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:the 1970s, Egypt has received on average $5 million, but in 2013 alone, the country 
3:60:3772:28:69:85:513:191:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:received  $5.6  million  in  the  form  of  development  aid.  This  development  aid  mainly 
3:61:3866:69:9:85:231:122:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:                                                           
3:62:3924:9:15:85:498:113:5:g_d0_f7:7:g_d0_f7:F:1 Egypt receives $1.3 billion in form of military aid from the US since 1987 until today (Sharp, 2017).  
3:63:4029:15:11:85:482:98:7:g_d0_f7:7:g_d0_f7:F:The focus of this paper is on development aid measured by ODA%GNI published by World Bank. 
3:64:4120:11:0:85:87:87:7:g_d0_f7:7:g_d0_f7:F: 
4:65:4122:0:27:85:513:745:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:targets the economic sector ($1234 million in net ODA as of 2015) and the social sector 
4:66:4210:27:36:85:349:718:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:($361 million in net ODA as of 2015) (OECD, 2016).  
4:67:4262:36:28:85:513:682:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:One can conclude that Egypt receives quite high amounts of foreign development aid. 
4:68:4346:28:27:85:513:654:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:However, this aid did not contribute to the institutional development nor to the economic 
4:69:4436:27:28:85:513:627:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:development of Egypt. On a macro level, Egypt suffers from low GDP per capita growth, 
4:70:4522:28:29:85:513:599:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:unemployment, and poverty1, while on a micro level, Egypt has weak institutional quality, 
4:71:4612:29:28:85:513:570:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:weak rule of law and high corruption levels. Most importantly, Egypt still suffers from a 
4:72:4702:28:27:85:513:542:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:persistent shadow economy that limits the country’s long-term development and growth 
4:73:4787:27:28:85:513:515:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:(Hassan and Schneider, 2016). Given these issues, it is interesting to intersect the shadow 
4:74:4879:28:27:85:513:487:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economy with the aid-development nexus and to investigate the impact of the shadow 
4:75:4962:27:36:85:271:460:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economy on aid and its effectiveness.  
4:76:5001:36:28:85:513:424:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:There are limited studies2 focusing on the aid-development nexus in Egypt, and these 
4:77:5086:28:27:85:513:396:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:studies are inconclusive regarding the major indirect channels that might influence this 
4:78:5175:27:28:85:513:369:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:nexus. These studies have concluded that aid does not stimulate development in Egypt in 
4:79:5263:28:27:85:513:341:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:the long run because the shadow economy constitutes a major part of Egypt’s economy, 
4:80:5348:27:28:85:513:314:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:and it still weighs heavily on the income of the country (Hassan and Schneider, 2016). 
4:81:5435:28:28:85:513:286:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Thus,  it  is  important  to  analyze  the  role  and  influence  of  the  shadow  economy  on 
4:82:5530:28:35:85:502:258:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economic development and aid effectiveness for the case of Egypt from 1976 to 2013. 
4:83:5614:35:28:85:513:223:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:The aim of this paper is to add to the mixed empirical literature on the aid-development 
4:84:5703:28:61:85:513:195:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:nexus and analyze the influence of the shadow economy in Egypt by comparing the

4:86:5841:9:15:85:512:125:5:g_d0_f7:7:g_d0_f7:F:1 During the last couple of years, GDP per capita growth was at below zero levels, Unemployment soared 
4:87:5944:15:8:85:480:110:7:g_d0_f7:7:g_d0_f7:F:reaching 13% in 2013 and 25% of the population live in poverty as of 2010 (World Bank, 2016).

5:99:6600:35:28:85:513:473:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:The impact of aid on the recipient country’s development is a controversial matter, and 
5:100:6688:28:27:85:513:445:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:the empirical results are mixed regarding the direction of the impact of aid on growth. 
5:101:6776:27:28:85:513:418:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:One group of studies claims that aid positively impacts economic growth (Asteriou, 2009; 
5:102:6865:28:27:85:513:390:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Clemens et al., 2004; Dalgraad and Hansen, 2001; Hansen and Trap, 2000), while a 
5:103:6946:27:28:85:513:363:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:second  group  of  studies  argue  that  aid  is  ineffective  and  counterproductive,  thus 
5:104:7039:28:28:85:513:335:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:indicating that there is a negative relationship between aid and growth (Ovaska, 2003; 
5:105:7126:28:27:85:513:307:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Prokopijević  2007;  Williamson,  2009).  Importantly,  Burnside  and  Dollar  (2000)  and 
5:106:7217:27:28:85:513:280:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Collier  and  Dollar  (2002)  concluded  that  the  effectiveness  of  aid  and  the  efficient 
5:107:7313:28:36:85:460:252:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:allocation of aid are conditional upon sound policies in the recipient country.  
5:108:7394:36:27:85:513:216:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:The literature on the impact of aid on economic growth can be divided into three different 
5:109:7485:27:28:85:510:189:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:generations (Hansen and Tarp, 2000). The first generation of studies focused on the aid-
5:110:7573:28:27:85:513:161:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:growth nexus within the context of ‘gap models’. These studies argued that aid would 
5:111:7658:27:28:85:513:134:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:alleviate financial gaps, namely savings and investments gaps, and thus in turn would 
5:112:7744:28:0:85:513:106:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:increase growth in the recipient country. Empirical studies at this time largely focused 
6:113:7835:0:27:85:513:745:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:directly on the impact of aid on investments and savings. It has been argued based on the 
6:114:7925:27:28:85:513:718:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Harrod-Domar equation that a significant inflow of aid creates a substantial amount of 
6:115:8012:28:28:85:513:690:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:savings to finance investment, which in turn stimulates economic growth (Dowling and

6:117:8184:27:28:85:513:635:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Thus, the first generation of studies investigated the aid-growth nexus rather indirectly 
6:118:8274:28:35:85:336:607:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:through aid-saving or aid-investment relationships.  
6:119:8327:35:28:85:513:572:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:The second generation of studies focused on directly investigating the aid-growth nexus, 
6:120:8416:28:28:85:513:544:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:rather than indirectly. However, there is no consensus regarding the effectiveness and 
6:121:8503:28:27:85:513:516:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:direction of aid. It has been argued that such inconsistency in the empirical results is due 
6:122:8596:27:28:85:513:489:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:to sample sizes, methodologies, assumptions and data transformations (Museru, et al. 
6:123:8681:28:35:85:369:461:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:2013; Juselius et al., 2013; Nowak-Lehmann et al., 2012).  
6:124:8740:35:28:85:513:426:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:The third generation of studies, developed in the late 1990s, introduced a new debate to 
6:125:8829:28:28:85:513:398:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:the  literature  of  whether  aid  effectiveness  is  conditional  or  unconditional.  The  first 
6:126:8927:28:27:85:513:370:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:researchers  to  introduce  the  concept  of  the  conditionality  of  aid  effectiveness  were 
6:127:9023:27:28:85:513:343:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Burnside and Dollar (2000), followed by Collier and Dollar (2002), Collier and Hoeffler 
6:128:9111:28:35:85:251:315:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:(2004) and Dalgaard et al. 2004).  
6:129:9146:35:28:85:513:280:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Based on a survey of 29 empirical studies across the three generations of studies, Hansen 
6:130:9236:28:27:85:513:252:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:and Tarp (2000) argued that regressions that show a statistically significant and a positive 
6:131:9329:27:28:85:513:225:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:aid-growth nexus had prevailed. A recent time series analysis of the long-run impact of 
6:132:9417:28:28:85:513:197:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:aid on economic growth in 36 sub-Saharan African countries found that aid played a 
6:133:9500:28:27:85:513:169:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:positive developmental role of the macro economy in most of the recipient countries 
6:134:9584:27:0:85:513:142:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:(Juselius et al., 2013). However, based on another time series study, it was argued that 
7:135:9675:0:27:85:513:745:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:aid has an insignificant or only slightly significant negative impact on the per capita 
7:136:9763:27:28:85:396:718:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:income of the recipient country (Nowak-Lehmann et al., 2012).  
7:137:9826:28:28:85:513:690:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Boone (1996) and Remmer (2004) argued that aid negatively impacts economic growth 
7:138:9908:28:27:85:513:662:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:because aid increases the size of government and consumption and reduces tax revenues. 
7:139:9995:27:28:85:513:635:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:The increase in government consumption can either be in the form of an increase in the 
7:140:10082:28:27:85:513:607:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:salaries of public servants or higher military spending. As a result, domestic savings and 
7:141:10173:27:28:85:513:580:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:investment might decrease the slowing of economic growth despite the inflow of aid 
7:142:10256:28:28:85:513:552:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:(Dowling and Hiemenz, 1982). Additionally, it has been argued that the direction of aid 
7:143:10344:28:27:85:513:524:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:limits its effectiveness and its impact on economic growth. For instance, if aid is directed 
7:144:10437:27:28:85:513:497:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:to finance a domestic financial deficit, then inflation and interest rates are expected to 
7:145:10528:28:27:85:513:469:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:increase, thus discouraging private investors and resulting in stagnation in the private 
7:146:10617:27:28:85:513:442:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:sector and a decrease in total investment, which negatively impacts economic growth 
7:147:10701:28:27:85:241:414:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:(Dowling and Hiemenz, 1982).  
7:148:10731:27:28:85:513:387:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Additionally, high aid inflows channeled to corrupt governments can lead to negative 
7:149:10816:28:28:85:513:359:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:impacts due to the high transaction costs associated with aid reform programs. Moreover, 
7:150:10905:28:27:85:513:331:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:aid directed to weak governments with no clear development target agendas might be 
7:151:10988:27:28:85:513:304:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:ineffective due to pressure on  and incentives  for powerful public servants who have 
7:152:11074:28:27:85:513:276:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:conflicts  of  interest  and  moral  hazard  problems  with  regard  to  the  distribution  and 
7:153:11170:27:28:85:513:249:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:allocation of aid (Brautigam and Knack, 2004). By the same token, Williamson (2009) 
7:154:11254:28:28:85:513:221:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:claimed that the aid allocation process is influenced by different stakeholders, special 
7:155:11343:28:27:85:513:193:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:interests and rent-seeking activities. As a result, aid fails to promote growth by increasing 
7:156:11437:27:28:85:513:166:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:savings and investment. It has also been argued by Brautigam and Knack (2004) that high 
7:157:11525:28:27:85:513:138:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:inflows of aid to Africa are associated with a significant weakening of the quality of 
7:158:11612:27:0:85:513:111:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:governance and with lower tax collection efforts, which then created a vicious cycle of 
8:159:11702:0:27:85:513:745:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:weak institutions and economic decline. The continuous large transfers of aid to poor, 
8:160:11789:27:28:85:513:718:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:developing  countries  lead  to  aid  dependence  in  which  the  local  government  fails  to 
8:161:11884:28:28:85:513:690:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:maintain and improve the infrastructure and fails to provide quality public goods and 
8:162:11970:28:27:85:466:662:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:services without aid assistance and aid funding (Brautigam and Knack, 2004).  
8:163:12048:27:28:85:513:635:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:For the case of Egypt,  Ali  (2013), Abuelfoul (2013) and Emara (2013) analyzed the 
8:164:12131:28:27:85:513:607:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:impact of aid on growth in Egypt while controlling for other variables and concluded that 
8:165:12221:27:28:85:513:580:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:aid  negatively  influences  long-run  economic  growth.  This  limited  number  of  studies 
8:166:12314:28:28:85:513:552:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:focusing on the aid-growth nexus in Egypt are inconclusive regarding the major indirect 
8:167:12402:28:27:85:513:524:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:channels that influence this nexus. Because the shadow economy constitutes a major part 
8:168:12490:27:28:85:513:497:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:of the Egypt’s economy, it is important to analyze the role and influence of the shadow 
8:169:12578:28:35:85:453:469:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economy on the effectiveness and impact of aid on economic development.  
8:170:12651:35:36:85:193:434:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:C:2.2 Shadow economy  
8:171:12671:36:28:85:513:398:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Most  countries  around  the  globe  suffer  to  varying  degrees  from  sizable  shadow 
8:172:12760:28:27:85:513:370:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economies. The shadow economy has an invisible nature and is hidden from the legal part 
8:173:12848:27:28:85:513:343:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:of the economy. One of the ongoing concerns facing politicians and scholars is tackling 
8:174:12936:28:27:85:513:315:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:the shadow economy. Generally, the shadow economy involves all currently unrecorded 
8:175:13020:27:28:85:513:288:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economic (market-based) activities that, if registered, would contribute to the officially 
8:176:13111:28:28:85:513:260:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:calculated  national  income  (GDP).  The  agents  participating  in  the  shadow  economy 
8:177:13202:28:27:85:513:232:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:absorb efficient resources from the official economy, yet they are unproductive and add 
8:178:13290:27:36:85:398:205:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:minimum value to the overall economy (Schneider et al., 2010).  
8:179:13354:36:27:85:513:169:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:The shadow economy has diverse effects on the long-term growth and development of a 
8:180:13438:27:28:85:513:142:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:country. The shadow economy might lead to negative effects on development, but it can 
8:181:13524:28:0:85:513:114:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:also have positive impacts. However, the negative effects of the shadow economy are 
9:182:13610:0:27:85:513:745:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:more severe than its positive effects, especially if it has a substantial weight compared to 
9:183:13703:27:28:85:513:718:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:the official economy. Among the negative effects of the shadow economy is a shrinking 
9:184:13789:28:28:85:513:690:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:of the tax base and a lowering of governmental revenues, thus creating a vicious cycle of 
9:185:13879:28:27:85:513:662:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:continuous  inefficient  increases  of  tax  rates.  When  tax  revenues  decrease  due  to  an 
9:186:13975:27:28:85:513:635:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:increase in informal activities, governmental revenues decrease and in turn, the provision 
9:187:14066:28:27:85:513:607:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:of public goods and services deteriorates. Therefore, the shadow economy reduces public 
9:188:14154:27:28:85:513:580:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:finance  and  investment,  which  in  turn  influences  the  development  of  the  economy 
9:189:14245:28:36:85:206:552:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:(Schneider et al., 2010).  
9:190:14272:36:27:85:513:516:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Second, the shadow economy creates distortions in the official statistics and thus provides 
9:191:14364:27:28:85:513:489:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:policy makers with the wrong indicators, leading to ineffective macro policies (Tanzi, 
9:192:14451:28:27:85:513:461:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:1999;  Frey,  2000;  Schneider  et  al.,  2000).  Moreover,  the  shadow  economy  creates 
9:193:14542:27:28:85:513:434:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:distortions  in  resource  allocation  by  absorbing  labor  and  capital  resources  from  the 
9:194:14638:28:28:85:513:406:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:official  economy.  Most  importantly,  a  shadow  economy  has  a  negative  impact  on  a 
9:195:14730:28:27:85:513:378:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:country’s  growth.  Loayaza  (1996)  concluded  that  the  shadow  economy  reduces  the 
9:196:14819:27:28:85:513:351:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:official economic growth in Latin America due to a reduction in the provision of public 
9:197:14907:28:35:85:351:323:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:goods and services and inefficient resource allocation.  
9:198:14964:35:28:85:513:288:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:The shadow economy also has negative impacts on the overall economy that are not 
9:199:15045:28:28:85:513:260:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:necessary related to economic development. These include increased pollution (Biswas 
9:200:15130:28:27:85:513:232:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:et al., 2012), unfair competition for formal firms that abide by the law that adds minimal 
9:201:15220:27:28:85:513:205:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:value to the formal economy due to the low productivity of the informal firms, a reduction 
9:202:15311:28:29:85:513:177:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:in global competitiveness, and diminished working conditions (Bacchetta et al., 2009, La 
9:203:15400:29:28:85:513:148:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Porta and Schleifer, 2014; Gerxhani, 2004, Schneider and Enste, 2000). Additionally, the 
9:204:15489:28:27:85:513:120:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:existence of the shadow economy creates distortions in social norms by encouraging 
9:205:15572:27:0:85:513:93:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:corruption,  the  weak  rule  of  law,  and  disrespect  for  official  institutions.  A  shadow 
10:206:15671:0:27:85:513:745:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economy is thus an indicator of low institutional quality and illegitimacy (Schneider and 
10:207:15761:27:36:85:158:718:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Enste, 2000)1.  
10:208:15777:36:28:85:513:682:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:However, it has been counterargued that the shadow economy might have positive effects. 
10:209:15865:28:27:85:513:654:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:First, the shadow economy acts as a safe-harbor and employer of last resort in times of 
10:210:15953:27:28:85:513:627:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:crisis and turmoil. Additionally, the shadow economy creates stimulating effects, as the 
10:211:16042:28:27:85:513:599:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:income generated in it is further spent in the official economy (Schneider et al., 2010). 
10:212:16132:27:28:85:513:572:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Adam and Ginsburg (1985) concluded that there is a positive relationship between a 
10:213:16215:28:36:85:300:544:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:shadow economy and the official economy.  
10:214:16257:36:27:85:513:508:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:For the case of Egypt, the shadow economy cannot be neglected, as it has retained a highly 
10:215:16348:27:28:85:513:481:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:persistent share of the overall economy over time, which then burdens the growth of the 
10:216:16436:28:27:85:513:453:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:formal economy. According to estimations by Hassan and Schneider (2016), the shadow 
10:217:16520:27:28:85:513:426:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economy as percentage of GDP was significant during the 1970s and 1980s, reaching 
10:218:16602:28:28:85:513:398:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:more than 30% of GDP. Since the 1990s, however, there is evidence of a continuous 
10:219:16684:28:27:85:513:370:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:decline in the size of shadow economy in Egypt, reaching approximately 20% of GDP in 
10:220:16769:27:28:85:513:343:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:2013. As shown in Figure 1, the trend of the shadow economy is decreasing, but this is 
10:221:16856:28:27:85:513:315:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:not  necessary  good  news  because  the  shadow  economy  still  has  substantial  weight 
10:222:16947:27:28:85:513:288:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:compared to the official economy, thus hindering its development. Based on the Egyptian

10:230:17623:15:11:85:513:98:7:g_d0_f7:7:g_d0_f7:F:enhances formal economic activities and thus acts as a complement to the official economy by mitigating

11:240:18051:28:27:85:513:332:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economy, it  is interesting to investigate how the shadow economy  can influence the

11:244:18276:36:28:85:513:214:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:There are different indirect channels through which the shadow economy influences the 
11:245:18362:28:27:85:513:186:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:aid-development nexus and hence the effectiveness of aid. The shadow economy hinders 
11:246:18447:27:28:85:513:159:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:an economy’s development. First, the shadow economy inefficiently absorbs resources 
11:247:18531:28:27:85:513:131:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:such  as  human  (labor)  resources  and  physical  resources  from  the  formal  economy. 
11:248:18622:27:0:85:513:104:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Second, the shadow economy limits public resources that could be used efficiently. Third,

12:256:18759:0:27:85:513:745:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:the  shadow  economy  reduces  government  spending  and  limits  the  ability  of  the 
12:257:18847:27:28:85:513:718:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:government to efficiently finance its public sector (Loayza, 1996; Dell’Anno et al., 2007). 
12:258:18939:28:28:85:513:690:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:As argued by Schneider and Enste (2013), the shadow economy is a waste of resources. 
12:259:19024:28:27:85:513:662:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Agents operating in the shadow economy inefficiently absorb substantial resources from 
12:260:19111:27:28:85:513:635:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:the formal economy, yet such agents are highly unproductive and do not add value to the 
12:261:19199:28:27:85:513:607:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:overall economy. This implies that the shadow economy negatively influences resource 
12:262:19284:27:28:85:513:580:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:allocation. In return, the allocation and effectiveness of aid to recipient countries that have 
12:263:19380:28:36:85:298:552:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:a prominent shadow economy are affected.  
12:264:19422:36:27:85:513:516:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Additionally,  the  shadow  economy  leads  to  misrepresentations  in  macroeconomic 
12:265:19508:27:28:85:513:489:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:indicators. In turn, the quality and direction of governmental policies are erroneous (Tanzi 
12:266:19601:28:27:85:513:461:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:1999; Schneider et al., 2010). Burnside and Dollar (2000) argued that aid effectiveness 
12:267:19689:27:28:85:513:434:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:highly depends on sound governmental policies. This implies that effective aid allocation 
12:268:19779:28:28:85:513:406:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:highly depends on macroeconomic stability and sound fiscal, monetary and trade policies 
12:269:19867:28:27:85:513:378:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:(Burnside  and  Dollar,  2000).  Additionally,  Durbarry  et  al.  (1998)  argued  that  the 
12:270:19960:27:28:85:513:351:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:effectiveness of aid is enhanced when appropriate policies are in place. Because a shadow 
12:271:20050:28:27:85:513:323:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economy is present in weak policy environments and leads to erroneous governmental 
12:272:20133:27:36:85:357:296:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:policies, the effectiveness of aid is highly questionable.  
12:273:20193:36:28:85:513:260:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:By  the  same  token,  aid  might  be  ineffective  and  the  aid  budget  might  be  highly 
12:274:20286:28:27:85:513:232:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:misallocated when it is based on falsified and misrepresented official statistics that do not 
12:275:20380:27:28:85:513:205:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:accurately reflect the true macroeconomic status of the recipient country. The shadow 
12:276:20466:28:27:85:513:177:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economy highly distorts labor statistics. For instance, a country with a low ‘official’ 
12:277:20554:27:28:85:513:150:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:unemployment rate but a large shadow economy would receive less aid than it needs 
12:278:20636:28:28:85:513:122:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:compared to a country  with a high ‘official’ unemployment rate but a small shadow 
12:279:20719:28:0:85:513:94:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economy. Therefore, the failure to capture the true presence of the shadow economy and 
13:280:20809:0:27:85:513:745:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:the subsequently misrepresented official statistics lead to inefficient aid programs and 
13:281:20898:27:36:85:349:718:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:misallocation of aid budgets (Eilat and Zinnes, 2000).  
13:282:20954:36:28:85:513:682:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Moreover, the shadow economy is highly associated with low institutional quality and 
13:283:21039:28:27:85:513:654:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:hence  potentially  higher  levels  of  corruption  and  less  democracy  (Teobaldelli  and 
13:284:21131:27:28:85:513:627:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Schneider, 2013; Schneider, 2010; Razmi et al., 2013). Dreher and Schneider (2006) 
13:285:21214:28:27:85:510:599:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:argued that the shadow economy and corruption are complements to each other in low-
13:286:21297:27:28:85:513:572:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:income countries, meaning that high levels of shadow economy are linked to high levels 
13:287:21384:28:28:85:513:544:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:of corruption. Therefore, corruption distorts the allocation of resources, including aid, 
13:288:21474:28:27:85:513:516:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:enriches corrupt bureaucrats and promotes bad governance. In the presence of corruption, 
13:289:21563:27:28:85:513:489:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:aid encourages rent-seeking behaviors and a further weakening of institutions. Hence, the 
13:290:21653:28:27:85:513:461:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:core objective of aid fails, and economic growth is not achieved (Okumu, 2015, Svensson, 
13:291:21742:27:28:85:513:434:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:2000). Additionally, Svensson (1999) argued that aid effectiveness is conditional on the 
13:292:21831:28:28:85:513:406:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:degree of democracy in the recipient country. In less democratic countries, aid allocation 
13:293:21922:28:27:85:513:378:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:is not productive and is not channeled for development purposes; instead, it is used to 
13:294:22010:27:36:85:446:351:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:finance the government’s own non-productive activities (Svensson, 1999). 
13:295:22083:36:27:85:513:315:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Given the unobservable nature of the shadow economy, aid should target only the legal 
13:296:22169:27:28:85:513:288:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:and official part of the economy. This invisible nature of the shadow economy influences 
13:297:22258:28:28:85:513:260:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:the effectiveness of aid programs. In most cases, informal firms operating in the shadow 
13:298:22347:28:27:85:513:232:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economy do not have access to aid programs and budgets. Therefore, aid allocation and 
13:299:22433:27:28:85:513:205:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:its direction might not be efficient due to a failure to acknowledge the existence of the 
13:300:22523:28:27:85:513:177:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:shadow economy and a failure to target informal labor and firms operating in the hidden 
13:301:22611:27:36:85:338:150:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economy in the aid budget (Eilat and Zinnes, 2000).

15:334:25218:28:27:85:513:607:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:grant (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) (World Bank, 2016). The main 
15:335:25302:27:28:85:513:580:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:objective of ODA is to promote the economic development and welfare of developing 
15:336:25383:28:28:85:513:552:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:countries. The next important variable in our analysis is the relative size of the shadow 
15:337:25473:28:27:85:513:524:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economy compared to the formal economy. Hassan and Schneider (2016) applied the 
15:338:25553:27:28:85:513:497:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) modeling approach to estimate the size of 
15:339:25639:28:27:85:513:469:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:the shadow economy as measured as a percentage of GDP. This confirmatory approach 
15:340:25721:27:28:85:513:442:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:simultaneously considers different causes and indicators of the shadow economy instead 
15:341:25808:28:27:85:513:414:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:of relying on only one proxy to measure the unobserved economy. The time series data 
15:342:25893:27:28:85:513:387:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:are complete and  annual from 1976 to 2013  for the case of Egypt. Table A1 in the 
15:343:25976:28:34:85:453:359:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:appendix presents the details and summary statistics of the above variables.  
15:344:26054:34:35:85:515:325:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Based on the theoretical background discussed above, the main hypothesis is as follows:  
15:345:26143:35:22:85:508:290:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f7:B:Hypothesis: The shadow economy has a decreasing effect on aid effectiveness in Egypt. 
15:346:26229:22:22:85:88:268:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B: 
15:347:26229:22:36:85:207:246:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:C:3.2 Empirical estimation 
15:348:26254:36:27:85:513:210:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:To test for the influence of the shadow economy on the effectiveness of aid in stimulating 
15:349:26345:27:28:85:513:183:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economic development in Egypt, the fully modified OLS (FM-OLS) method is applied. 
15:350:26427:28:27:85:513:155:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:The FM-OLS model was developed by Phillips and Hansen (1990) and is chosen based 
15:351:26508:27:28:85:510:128:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:on its two major advantages. Most importantly, the FM-OLS model accounts for co-
15:352:26588:28:0:85:513:100:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:integration  relationships  among  the  variables  by  estimating  a  single  cointegrating 
16:353:26683:0:27:85:513:745:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:equation. Thus, the first major advantage of FM-OLS is that it addresses the endogeneity 
16:354:26772:27:28:85:513:718:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:problem. FM-OLS applies a semi-parametric correction to modify the least squares to 
16:355:26856:28:28:85:513:690:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:account for serial correlation effects and endogeneity in the regressors that arise due to 
16:356:26947:28:27:85:513:662:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:cointegrating  relationships.  The  second  advantage  is  that  FM-OLS  provides  reliable 
16:357:27039:27:28:85:513:635:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:estimates for small sample sizes (in our case, n=38) without influencing the quality of the 
16:358:27131:28:27:85:513:607:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:estimators in a case of a low number of observations (Phillips and Hansen, 1990; Phillips, 
16:359:27222:27:36:85:122:580:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:1993).  
16:360:27230:36:28:85:513:544:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Most macroeconomic time series data are trending and show data persistence over time. 
16:361:27316:28:27:85:513:516:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Thus, the data must be checked for stationarity. The first step in the FM-OLS model is to 
16:362:27406:27:28:85:513:489:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:determine the order of integration of each variable. In this study, the Augmented Dicky 
16:363:27494:28:27:85:513:461:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Fuller  (ADF)  and  Phillip-Perron  (PP)  unit  root  tests  on  the  level  data  and  the  first 
16:364:27593:27:28:85:513:434:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:differences of the variables are applied to determine the order of integration. Importantly, 
16:365:27686:28:28:85:513:406:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:all of the variables are of order I=1, and none of the variables is I=2, which validates the 
16:366:27779:28:27:85:513:378:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:application  of  the  FM-OLS  model  to  test  the  long-run  relationship  between  aid  and 
16:367:27873:27:28:85:513:351:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economic development given the presence of the shadow economy in Egypt. The results 
16:368:27957:28:35:85:379:323:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:of the unit root tests are shown in Table A3 in the appendix.  
16:369:28020:35:28:85:513:288:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:The second step in estimating the FM-OLS model is to determine whether the data share 
16:370:28106:28:28:85:513:260:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:a common deterministic trend. Thus, the Johansen Test of co-integration is applied in 
16:371:28192:28:27:85:513:232:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:order  to  determine  the  number  of  co-integrated  equations  and  to  verify  the  long-run 
16:372:28288:27:28:85:513:205:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:relationship among the variables. Because the co-integration test is sensitive to the lag 
16:373:28378:28:27:85:513:177:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:length, the optimal lag length chosen given the number of observations is lag =1. The 
16:374:28464:27:28:85:513:150:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Trace and Maximum eigenvalues are reported in Table A4 in the appendix. Based on the 
16:375:28549:28:28:85:513:122:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:results of the unit root tests and the co-integration test, we find evidence of a long-run 
16:376:28640:28:0:85:513:94:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:relationship between the variables; therefore, the FM-OLS model is applied to test for our 
17:377:28734:0:27:85:513:745:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:hypothesized relationship. Notably, differencing is not recommended because it leads to 
17:378:28822:27:28:85:513:718:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:the loss of important long-run information among the cointegrated variables (Sims et al. 
17:379:28911:28:36:85:119:690:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:1990).

17:381:28929:35:28:85:513:619:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:This  section  presents  the  main  results  of  the  FM-OLS  model  to  investigate  the 
17:382:29019:28:27:85:513:591:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:effectiveness of aid (ODA%GNI) for development in Egypt in the presence of the shadow 
17:383:29105:27:28:85:513:564:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economy. To this end, the effectiveness and impact of aid on economic development are 
17:384:29191:28:28:85:513:536:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:compared with and without the introduction of the shadow economy in the nexus while 
17:385:29275:28:35:85:287:508:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:controlling for other important variables.  
17:386:29319:35:28:85:513:473:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:In the first attempt in models (1) and (2) as shown in Table 1, the typical impact of aid on 
17:387:29412:28:27:85:513:445:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:development is tested while controlling for other important variables mentioned in the 
17:388:29499:27:28:85:513:418:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:literature without the introduction of the shadow economy. Based on the results of the 
17:389:29586:28:27:85:513:390:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:estimation, aid has a significantly negative impact on economic development for the case 
17:390:29675:27:28:85:513:363:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:of Egypt in the long run. This conclusion was also reached by Ali (2013), Abuelfoul 
17:391:29759:28:28:85:513:335:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:(2013), and Emara (2013), who also examined the impact of aid on development in Egypt 
17:392:29845:28:27:85:513:307:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:in the long run. This result supports the argument by various authors that aid does not 
17:393:29933:27:28:85:513:280:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:necessarily lead to economic development. For the case of Egypt, the country suffers from 
17:394:30023:28:27:85:513:252:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:a bad policy environment, bureaucratic corruption and macroeconomic instability, which 
17:395:30110:27:28:85:513:225:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:dampens the impact of aid on development. Ali (2013) argued that the negative impact of 
17:396:30198:28:28:85:513:197:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:aid on economic development in Egypt in the long run is mainly due to bad governance 
17:397:30283:28:27:85:286:169:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:and inefficient policy-making processes.

19:577:32745:27:28:85:513:718:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:shadow economy and its impact on aid effectiveness in Egypt are controlled. To this end, 
19:578:32834:28:28:85:513:690:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:an  interaction  term  (SE*AID)  is  added  to  the  specifications,  together  with  the  other 
19:579:32931:28:27:85:513:662:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:controls that might influence the aid-development nexus. We also control for the shadow 
19:580:33019:27:28:85:513:635:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economy in Egypt, i.e., we take into consideration the existence of the shadow economy. 
19:581:33107:28:27:85:513:607:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:The impact of aid on economic development becomes positive and significant. This result 
19:582:33195:27:28:85:513:580:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:implies  that  aid  programs  that  have  an  established  aid  agenda  to  tackle  the  shadow 
19:583:33291:28:28:85:513:552:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economy and to address the weak points in the formal economy that motivate individuals 
19:584:33378:28:27:85:513:524:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:to join the shadow economy have a positive impact on economic development in Egypt 
19:585:33461:27:28:85:513:497:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:over  the  long  run  by  helping  with  the  transition  to  formalize  the  shadow  economy. 
19:586:33556:28:27:85:513:469:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:However, the shadow economy has a diminishing and negative impact on the efficiency 
19:587:33640:27:28:85:399:442:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:of aid for the case of Egypt, as indicated by the interaction term.  
19:588:33709:28:27:85:513:414:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Additionally, the impact of the shadow economy on the formal economy; i.e., economic 
19:589:33794:27:28:85:513:387:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:development  in  Egypt,  is  negative.  This  negative  relationship  between  the  shadow 
19:590:33885:28:28:85:513:359:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economy and economic development was also found by Loayza (1996). The shadow 
19:591:33962:28:27:85:513:331:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economy leads to different negative externalities that influence the official economy. The 
19:592:34053:27:28:85:513:304:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:shadow  economy  distorts  the  tax  system,  which  leads  to  inefficient  policy-making 
19:593:34144:28:27:85:513:276:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:processes and the misallocation of official resources. Additionally, the shadow economy 
19:594:34232:27:28:85:513:249:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:is persistent in corrupt and unstable political and economic economies, which discourages 
19:595:34322:28:28:85:411:221:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:private foreign and local investors as well as foreign aid programs.  
19:596:34392:28:27:85:513:193:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:The results shed light on the importance of  considering the existence of the shadow 
19:597:34477:27:28:85:513:166:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economy and its interactions with the overall economy. The shadow economy reduced 
19:598:34559:28:27:85:513:138:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:the efficiency of the aid received by Egypt, which has important implications for policy 
19:599:34648:27:0:85:513:111:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:makers to consider the importance of tackling the shadow economy. To observe the full 
20:600:34737:0:27:85:513:745:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:picture regarding the impact and efficiency of aid, policy makers in Egypt need to take 
20:601:34825:27:28:85:257:718:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:into account the shadow economy.  
20:602:34859:28:28:85:513:690:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:The impact of education on development is positive and significant. This result implies 
20:603:34947:28:27:85:513:662:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:that higher investment in education improves the quality of the labor force and increases 
20:604:35037:27:28:85:513:635:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:productivity and output in the economy, thus increasing economic development. Elewa 
20:605:35121:28:27:85:513:607:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:(2015) recently concluded that increased investment in human capital, i.e., education, 
20:606:35208:27:28:85:513:580:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:increases economic development in Egypt over the long run. The author argued that 
20:607:35290:28:28:85:513:552:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:education led to an increase in public revenues due to the increased capacity of labor to 
20:608:35380:28:27:85:513:524:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:produce  and  increased  employment  levels,  thus  encouraging  economic  development 
20:609:35467:27:28:85:513:497:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:(Elewa, 2015). By the same token, increases in employment and the expansion of the 
20:610:35550:28:27:85:513:469:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:labor  market  increase  labor  productivity,  output,  consumption,  and  public  revenues, 
20:611:35643:27:28:85:513:442:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:which then leads to economic expansion and higher rates of economic development. 
20:612:35724:28:27:85:513:414:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Employment development decreases unemployment, which has a major negative impact 
20:613:35805:27:28:85:513:387:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:on a country’s general economy and leads to economic stagnation and lower economic 
20:614:35888:28:28:85:247:359:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:growth (El-Agrody et al., 2010).  
20:615:35922:28:27:85:513:331:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:The impact of FDI on economic development through the integration of the domestic 
20:616:36004:27:28:85:513:304:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economy with global economies, through increased competition in the domestic economy 
20:617:36089:28:27:85:513:276:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:of  the  host  country,  and  through  the  transfer  of  new  technologies  and  know-how  is 
20:618:36184:27:28:85:513:249:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:negative in the case of Egypt. The main argument is that the effects of FDI on the host 
20:619:36272:28:28:85:513:221:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:country depend heavily on the country’s internal characteristics and conditions (Moura 
20:620:36359:28:27:85:513:193:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:and Forte, 2010). Egypt’s economic, social and political status limits the positive effects 
20:621:36451:27:28:85:513:166:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:of FDI on economic development. Egypt suffers from a prominent shadow economy, a 
20:622:36532:28:27:85:513:138:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:high level of corruption of public servants, weak rule of law, high unemployment levels 
20:623:36620:27:0:85:203:111:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:and population growth.  
21:624:36647:0:27:85:513:745:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:On the other hand, openness to trade has a positive and significant impact on economic 
21:625:36734:27:28:85:513:718:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:development in the case of Egypt. Trade openness is considered an important engine of 
21:626:36820:28:28:85:513:690:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economic development, especially for developing countries. The positive link between 
21:627:36905:28:27:85:513:662:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:increased  openness  and  economic  development  occurs  through  increased  production 
21:628:36993:27:28:85:513:635:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:levels and investment capacity and higher employment (Idris et al., 2016). Based on a 
21:629:37079:28:27:85:510:607:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:recent  study,  the  impact  of  openness  on  trade  for  the  case  of  Egypt  given  the  aid-
21:630:37176:27:28:85:513:580:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:development nexus is positive and significant in the long run (Sabra and Eltalla, 2016; 
21:631:37264:28:28:85:186:552:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Eamar et al., 2013).  
21:632:37286:28:27:85:513:524:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Furthermore,  financial  market  development  is  a  major  contributor  to  economic 
21:633:37372:27:28:85:513:497:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:development, especially in a developing country such as Egypt. Financial development 
21:634:37457:28:27:85:513:469:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:impacts development positively through a reduction in the information and transaction 
21:635:37543:27:28:85:513:442:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:costs required to obtain credit and by providing easy access to capital for productive 
21:636:37630:28:27:85:513:414:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:projects (Hassan et al., 2011; Durusu-Ciftci, 2017). For the case of Egypt, Abu-badr and 
21:637:37719:27:28:85:513:387:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Abu-Qarn  (2008)  found  evidence  that  financial  development  leads  to  economic 
21:638:37804:28:28:85:513:359:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:development through enhanced efficiency and the mobilization of capital and resources 
21:639:37890:28:27:85:164:331:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:for investment.  
21:640:37907:27:28:85:513:304:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Consistent with the literature on the case of Egypt, capital formation has a significantly 
21:641:37998:28:27:85:513:276:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:negative impact on economic development. It has been argued that inefficiency in capital 
21:642:38087:27:28:85:513:249:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:accumulation strategies and the combination of weak economic and political policies are 
21:643:38175:28:28:85:510:221:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:major  contributors  to  the  negative  impact  of  gross  capital  formation  on  the  aid-
21:644:38267:28:27:85:284:193:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:development nexus in Egypt (Ali, 2013). 
21:645:38307:27:28:85:513:166:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Finally, the impact of remittances on development for the case of Egypt1 is positive yet 
21:646:38396:28:27:85:513:138:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:insignificant. Remittances are one of the most important sources of income from abroad; 
21:647:38484:27:9:85:231:111:8:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f8:F:                                                           
21:648:38542:9:15:85:512:102:5:g_d0_f7:7:g_d0_f7:F:1 For microeconomic studies on remittances in Egypt, please refer to Adams (1991) and Elbadaway and 
21:649:38642:15:0:85:155:87:7:g_d0_f7:7:g_d0_f7:F:Rouchdy (2010). 
22:650:38661:0:27:85:513:745:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:however,  they  do  not  have  a  significant  impact  on  long-term  development  because 
22:651:38752:27:28:85:513:718:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:especially in a developing country such as Egypt, remittances are used for household 
22:652:38837:28:28:85:513:690:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:consumption rather than productive investments that would boost long-term development 
22:653:38923:28:27:85:327:662:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:(Giuliano and Ruiz-Arranz, 2006; Glytsos, 2005). 
22:654:38972:27:28:85:513:635:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Additionally, the importance of the impact of the policy and institutional environment 
22:655:39059:28:27:85:513:607:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:and its interaction with aid on economic development in Egypt has been controlled. As a 
22:656:39147:27:28:85:513:580:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:proxy of policy, the Vanhanen Index of Democracy is used. For the case of Egypt, a good 
22:657:39235:28:28:85:513:552:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:policy environment does not play a significant role in influencing aid and its effectiveness 
22:658:39328:28:27:85:513:524:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:in promoting economic development. Easerly et al. (2004) and Dalgraad and Hansen 
22:659:39409:27:28:85:513:497:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:(2001) argued that the significance of the policy-aid interaction becomes weak when 
22:660:39493:28:27:85:513:469:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:additional data become available, for example by expanding the dataset by a number of 
22:661:39579:27:28:85:513:442:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:countries or adding controls and/or years. The authors also argued that Burnside and 
22:662:39664:28:27:85:513:414:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Dollar (2000) provided a major contribution to the literature, yet they did not furnish the 
22:663:39756:27:28:85:513:387:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:final answer on aid effectiveness (Easterly et al., 2004), as policy and other channels such 
22:664:39849:28:28:85:513:359:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:as the presence of the shadow economy also play roles in the effectiveness of aid, as 
22:665:39935:28:27:85:513:331:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:shown  by  the  results  here.  It  is  critical  to  note  that  the  addition  of  the  policy  and 
22:666:40037:27:28:85:513:304:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:institutional environment variable to models (13) and (14) in Table 1 shows that the 
22:667:40122:28:27:85:513:276:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:importance of the direct impact of the shadow economy on the effectiveness of aid is still 
22:668:40213:27:28:85:513:249:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:negative, yet it became not very important. The insignificance of both interaction terms 
22:669:40302:28:28:85:513:221:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:highlights that neither the shadow economy nor the policy environment has a dominating 
22:670:40389:28:27:85:513:193:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:role in influencing aid and its effectiveness. One can therefore conclude that the shadow 
22:671:40479:27:28:85:513:166:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economy in Egypt has a negative impact on aid and economic development, while a good 
22:672:40564:28:26:85:346:138:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:policy environment promotes the effectiveness of aid. 
22:673:40618:26:0:85:87:112:7:g_d0_f7:7:g_d0_f7:F: 
23:674:40621:0:27:85:513:745:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:Finally, the marginal impact of a 1% increase in aid on the income level is calculated at 
23:675:40711:27:28:85:513:718:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:a  95%  confidence  interval,  as  shown  in  Figure  2,  at  different  levels  of  the  shadow 
23:676:40808:28:28:85:513:690:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economy in Egypt based on model 11 in Table 1. Because the effect of a change in aid on 
23:677:40896:28:27:85:513:662:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:the income level is conditional on the size of the shadow economy in Egypt, it is important 
23:678:40988:27:28:85:513:635:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:to go beyond the model coefficients per se and calculate the marginal effects of aid on 
23:679:41076:28:27:85:513:607:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:income for different values of the shadow economy. This analysis shows that the positive 
23:680:41165:27:28:85:513:580:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:impact of each additional increase in aid received by Egypt decreases as the size of the 
23:681:41254:28:28:85:513:552:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:shadow economy increases. This result implies that an increasing size of the shadow 
23:682:41338:28:27:85:513:524:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economy in Egypt reduces the impact of aid on the level of income. Therefore, it is

23:686:41563:36:28:85:513:398:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:This  paper  investigates  the  impact  of  the  shadow  economy  on  aid  and  economic 
23:687:41652:28:27:85:513:370:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:development for the case of Egypt over a long period of time. Although many studies 
23:688:41736:27:28:85:513:343:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:have focused on the aid-development nexus over recent decades, its application in Egypt 
23:689:41824:28:35:85:398:315:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:and a focus on the existence of the shadow economy are limited. 
23:690:41888:35:28:85:513:280:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:The shadow economy in Egypt is non-negligible and has retained a persistent share of the 
23:691:41977:28:27:85:513:252:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:overall economy over time. Therefore, it is quite interesting to intersect the impact of the 
23:692:42070:27:36:85:507:225:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:shadow economy with the aid-development literature, especially for the case of Egypt.  
23:693:42157:36:28:85:513:189:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:The main contribution of this paper is the investigation of the impact of the shadow 
23:694:42242:28:27:85:513:161:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economy on economic development and aid effectiveness. The impact of the shadow 
23:695:42322:27:28:85:513:134:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economy  on  economic  development  is  negative  and  has  a  dampening  effect  on  aid 
23:696:42412:28:0:85:513:106:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:effectiveness. The shadow economy affects the efficiency of the tax system through tax 
24:697:42502:0:27:85:513:745:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:evasion, which reduces government revenues and thus the quality of public goods and 
24:698:42586:27:28:85:513:718:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:services. Additionally, the shadow economy is a source of resource misallocation that 
24:699:42672:28:28:85:513:690:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:leads to the inefficient use and allocation of resources; namely, human resources, aid and 
24:700:42763:28:27:85:513:662:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:capital resources. Additionally, the shadow economy distorts policy decisions due to the 
24:701:42852:27:28:85:513:635:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:biases  in  official  publicly  available  information  and  macroeconomic  data.  Most 
24:702:42940:28:27:85:513:607:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:importantly, the existence of the shadow economy promotes corruption and instability, 
24:703:43026:27:28:85:513:580:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:which ultimately discourages private foreign and local investors as well as foreign aid 
24:704:43114:28:28:85:513:552:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:programs that have the objective of increasing economic development and enhancing the 
24:705:43200:28:35:85:138:524:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:economy.  
24:706:43210:35:28:85:513:489:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:A major policy implication is that the persistent existence of the shadow economy over 
24:707:43297:28:27:85:513:461:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:time in Egypt poses a major challenge for policy makers due to its negative impact on the 
24:708:43387:27:28:85:513:434:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:official  economy  and  its  dampening  effect  on  aid  effectiveness.  Analyzing  the 
24:709:43475:28:28:85:513:406:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:intersection of the shadow economy in the aid-development nexus is novel and highlights 
24:710:43563:28:27:85:513:378:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:the importance of tackling and formalizing the shadow economy in Egypt. Hence, the 
24:711:43646:27:28:85:513:351:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:complete separation  of  the  shadow  economy  and  eliminating  its  interaction  with  the 
24:712:43739:28:35:85:251:323:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:B:official economy are not possible.
