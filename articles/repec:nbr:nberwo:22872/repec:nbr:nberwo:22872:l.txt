2:29:1461:28:28:273:338:616:12:Times:12:Times:F:ABSTRACT
2:30:1469:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:Using  an  uneven  panel  of  135  countries  from  1995  to  2014,  we  investigate  the  link  between 
2:31:1574:14:14:72:545:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:interest rates and private saving, and focus on whether the interest rate effect is dominated by the 
2:32:1674:14:14:71:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:income (i.e., negative) or the substitution (i.e., positive) effect. With the baseline estimation, we 
2:33:1775:14:14:71:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:find that the real interest rate has the substitution effect on private saving only for a full-country 
2:34:1877:14:14:71:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:sample and a group of Asian economies. We also examine if low real - or nominal - interest rates 
2:35:1973:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:have any impact on the link between the real interest rate and the private saving rate. We find that 
2:36:2073:14:14:72:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:among  developing  countries, when  the  nominal  interest  rate  is  not  too  low,  we  detect  the 
2:37:2174:14:14:72:545:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:substitution  effect  of  the  real  interest  rate on  private  saving.  However,  among  industrial  and 
2:38:2280:14:14:72:546:476:12:Times:12:Times:F:emerging  economies,  the  substitution  effect  is  detected only  when  the  nominal  interest  rate  is 
2:39:2386:14:14:72:546:462:12:Times:12:Times:F:lower  than  2.5%.  In  contrast,  emerging-market  Asian  countries are  found  to  have  the  income 
2:40:2488:14:14:72:545:448:12:Times:12:Times:F:effect  when  the  nominal  interest  rate  is  below  2.5%.  When  we  examine the  interactive  effects 
2:41:2593:14:14:72:546:434:12:Times:12:Times:F:between the real interest rate and the variables for economic conditions and policies, we find that 
2:42:2692:14:14:72:545:420:12:Times:12:Times:F:the real interest rate has a negative impact - i.e., income effect - on private saving if any output 
2:43:2792:14:14:72:546:406:12:Times:12:Times:F:volatility,  old  dependency,  or  financial  development  is  above  a  certain  threshold.  Further, when 
2:44:2899:14:14:72:545:392:12:Times:12:Times:F:the real interest rate is below 1.5%, greater output volatility would lead to higher private saving in 
2:45:3001:14:14:72:545:378:12:Times:12:g_d0_f1:F:developing  countries.  Lastly,  we  find  that  old  dependency  ratios,  public  healthcare  expenditure, 
2:46:3108:14:14:72:546:364:12:Times:12:Times:F:and financial development have negative impacts on private saving, but such impacts in absolute 
2:47:3204:14:28:72:406:350:12:Times:12:Times:F:values tend to become smaller as the real interest rate becomes lower.

3:65:3577:0:27:72:162:702:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:C:1. Introduction 
3:66:3592:27:27:112:543:675:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:In the summer of 2014, when the European Central Bank changed its interest rate on 
3:67:3675:27:27:72:543:648:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:excess bank reserves to -0.1%—a negative policy interest rate for the first time in not only its own 
3:68:3776:27:27:72:543:621:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:history  but  also  in  the  history  of  major  central  banks—advanced  economies  implementing 
3:69:3874:27:27:72:543:594:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:unconventional monetary policies entered a new phase.1  Eighteen months later, this action was 
3:70:3969:27:27:72:543:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:followed by the Bank of Japan’s decision to adopt negative interest rates. As of the fall 2016, 19 
3:71:4068:27:27:72:542:540:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:euro countries, plus Japan, Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland, have adopted negative policy 
3:72:4159:27:27:72:145:513:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:interest rates.   
3:73:4177:27:27:112:543:486:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:As unconventional actions often face opposition in general, negative interest-rate policies 
3:74:4269:27:27:72:539:459:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:have also faced challenges against their effectiveness. Conventionally speaking, lower interest-
3:75:4365:27:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:rate monetary policy is supposed to encourage present-day consumption (as opposed to future 
3:76:4457:27:27:72:542:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:consumption), by lowering the rewards for postponing consumption. More simply, lowering the 
3:77:4549:27:27:72:542:378:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:policy interest rate is expected to stimulate consumption and investment while discouraging people 
3:78:4648:27:27:72:542:351:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:to save. Expected as a further drastic action, negative interest rates would not just discourage, but 
3:79:4750:27:27:72:542:324:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:also penalize people if they postpone consumption. Hence, conceptually, negative interest rates 
3:80:4846:27:27:72:464:297:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:may lead people to spend now rather than later and therefore discourage saving.   
3:81:4928:27:27:112:542:270:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Recently, debates have proliferated regarding the effectiveness of negative interest-rate 
3:82:5018:27:27:72:543:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:policy. Some people have argued that negative interest rates may not work as central bankers 
3:83:5111:27:27:72:115:216:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:expect.   
3:84:5121:27:27:112:543:189:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:As for the link between the interest rate and saving, the argument is as follows: lower or 
3:85:5212:27:27:72:543:162:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:negative interest rates may contribute to higher, not lower, saving rates because the rate of return 
3:86:5313:27:21:72:542:135:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:per financial instrument is so low that people may try to compensate by increasing their aggregate 
3:87:5412:21:8:72:219:114:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:                                                 
3:88:5461:8:15:72:542:106:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:1  As an exception, Denmark had lowered its benchmark rate to a negative figure in mid-2012. Another exception is 
3:89:5575:15:12:71:542:91:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:Switzerland, which levied negative interest rates on CHF deposits from non-residents in 1972 to curb rapid capital 
3:90:5690:12:0:71:225:79:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:inflows. This policy lasted until 1978. 
4:91:5732:0:27:72:543:702:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:amount of saving. This scenario can be especially true in an economy with an aging population, as 
4:92:5830:27:27:72:543:675:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:people might want to target their saving to be better prepared for retirement. Such a tendency can 
4:93:5929:27:27:72:543:648:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:also be strong in an economy in which sufficient social protections such as social securities and 
4:94:6027:27:27:72:543:621:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:unemployment benefits are not available. Generally, people may want to increase their aggregate 
4:95:6123:27:27:72:543:594:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:amount of saving in response to lower interest rates if they face a gloomy and more volatile 
4:96:6216:27:27:72:543:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:economic outlook. Thus, the behavior of precautionary saving may change depending on economic 
4:97:6310:27:27:72:174:540:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:or policy conditions. 
4:98:6332:27:27:112:542:513:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:This is not just an issue for advanced economies with low or negative interest rates, but 
4:99:6422:27:27:72:542:486:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:for developing economies as well. In fact, in a developing economy with financial repression, 
4:100:6516:27:27:72:542:459:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:nominal interest rates tend to be artificially repressed and therefore the real rates of return tend to 
4:101:6620:27:27:72:542:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:be low. This situation can be exacerbated if the economy of concern experiences high inflation. If 
4:102:6719:27:27:72:542:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:such an economy is also coupled with underdeveloped public social-protection programs, people 
4:103:6813:27:27:72:474:378:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:have reason to increase the aggregate amount of saving for precautionary purposes. 
4:104:6896:27:27:112:543:351:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:While the interest rate effect on private saving is commonly perceived to be positive, 
4:105:6983:27:27:72:542:324:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Nabar (2011) notes that China experienced a combination of rising household saving and declining 
4:106:7080:27:27:72:543:297:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:real interest rates during the 2000s. Using province-level data over the 1996–2009 period, Nabar 
4:107:7177:27:27:72:474:270:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:empirically shows that when the return to saving declines, household saving rises.   
4:108:7262:27:27:112:542:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Is China’s documented interest-rate-saving link an isolated instance or an example of the 
4:109:7352:27:27:72:542:216:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:negative income effect of the interest rate? To shed some light on this question, we employ a panel 
4:110:7452:27:27:72:542:189:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:of countries to conduct an extensive empirical study on the link between interest rates and private 
4:111:7552:27:27:72:543:162:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:saving. At the outset, we recognize that the interest rate effect on private saving can be ambiguous. 
4:112:7654:27:27:72:542:135:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:As noted earlier, low interest rates can discourage saving because of the substitution effect, or 
4:113:7752:27:27:72:512:108:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:conversely, encourage saving via the income effect to achieve, say, a targeted saving goal.   
4:114:7846:27:0:112:543:81:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Because of the conflicting channels, the observed or final effect of the interest rate on 
5:115:7938:0:27:72:542:702:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:saving can depend upon the level of the interest rate itself as well as on other contributing factors. 
5:116:8041:27:27:72:543:675:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:In an environment in which the interest rate is extremely low, the income effect may, for example, 
5:117:8140:27:27:72:542:648:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:outweigh the substitution effect. In other words, in such an environment, agents may be worried 
5:118:8235:27:27:72:543:621:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:about  the  possibility  of  not  meeting  financial  investment  objectives  such  as  retirement,  and 
5:119:8340:27:27:72:542:594:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:therefore try to overcome the low return by increasing the aggregate volume of saving. In this case, 
5:120:8441:27:27:72:542:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:lower interest-rate levels would lead to higher levels of saving. Or, the effect of the interest rate on 
5:121:8546:27:27:72:543:540:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:saving  may  differ  depending  on  macroeconomic  or  demographical  conditions  or  policy 
5:122:8639:27:27:72:139:513:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:environment. 
5:123:8652:27:27:112:543:486:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Examining the link between the interest rate and saving is important. In the short term, 
5:124:8741:27:27:72:543:459:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:whether policy interest rates and saving rates have a positive or negative relationship also refers to 
5:125:8844:27:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the kind of impact a monetary policy would have on consumption and is therefore related to the 
5:126:8939:27:27:72:247:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:question of stabilization measures.   
5:127:8977:27:27:112:543:378:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Furthermore, this issue is also important in the context of the global imbalance debate. In 
5:128:9069:27:27:72:542:351:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the years leading up to the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, many emerging market economies in 
5:129:9164:27:27:72:543:324:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:East Asia (most notably China) and oil exporters persistently ran current-account surpluses during 
5:130:9263:27:27:72:543:297:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the global trend of lower real interest rates. Some economists argue that high savings in rapidly 
5:131:9361:27:27:72:542:270:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:growing emerging markets are responsible for such current account surpluses and thus contributing 
5:132:9459:27:27:72:542:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:to global economic instability (Greenspan, 2005a, b, and Bernanke, 2005). Hence, investigating 
5:133:9554:27:27:71:543:216:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:how  an  ultra-low-interest  rate  environment  would  contribute  to saving  on  a  global  scale  is 
5:134:9657:27:27:71:130:189:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:important.   
5:135:9670:27:27:112:542:162:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:In the long term, the impact of the interest rate on saving is related to the question of 
5:136:9760:27:27:71:542:135:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:capital  accumulation,  which  would  determine  future  income  level  and  thereby  present-day 
5:137:9858:27:27:71:542:108:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:consumption and saving. Thus, the nature of the interest-rate-saving link can be an important 
5:138:9952:27:0:71:421:81:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:determinant for the sustainability of long-term economic development.   
6:139:10026:0:27:112:543:702:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Therefore, we investigate whether the interest rate has the income (i.e., negative) effect or 
6:140:10120:27:27:72:542:675:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the substitution (i.e., positive) effect on private saving by using panel data of 135 countries over 
6:141:10221:27:27:72:543:648:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the 1995–2014 period while controlling for other factors that can affect the behavior of private 
6:142:10318:27:27:72:543:621:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:saving. Furthermore, we will empirically examine whether and how the impact of the interest rate 
6:143:10415:27:27:72:451:594:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:on saving can be affected by economic, demographical, and policy conditions. 
6:144:10492:27:27:112:542:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:In the next section, we introduce potential determinants of private saving and discuss their 
6:145:10585:27:27:72:543:540:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:impacts. In the same section, we present some stylized facts of private saving and the real interest 
6:146:10686:27:27:72:543:513:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:rates to show general trends of these variables. In Section 3, we introduce our estimation model 
6:147:10783:27:27:72:542:486:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and discuss the results from the baseline estimations. We extend our analysis and examine whether 
6:148:10881:27:27:72:543:459:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:any interactive effects exist between the real interest rate and other macroeconomic and structural 
6:149:10981:27:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:conditions in Section 4. In this section, we also discuss the implications of our estimation results 
6:150:11082:27:27:72:542:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:for Asian economies and several advanced economies. In Section 5, we offer concluding remarks.

6:153:11220:27:27:72:296:324:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:C:2.1 What Kind of Saving Do We Focus On? 
6:154:11259:27:27:112:543:297:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:A large number of studies have investigated the determinants of saving; a sample of these 
6:155:11349:27:27:72:543:270:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:studies include Masson et al. (1998), Loayza et al. (2000a, 2000b), Aizenman et al. (2015), and 
6:156:11445:27:27:72:543:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Aizenman and Noy (2013). Since these studies have provided comprehensive reviews on theory 
6:157:11536:27:27:72:543:216:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and  empirical  evidence  pertaining  to  the  determinants  of  saving,  we  focus  on  the  theoretical 
6:158:11642:27:27:72:360:189:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:predictions of the factors relevant to our empirical analysis. 
6:159:11705:27:27:112:543:162:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Before introducing potential determinants of saving, we need to clarify the kind of saving 
6:160:11796:27:27:72:543:135:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:we are referring to. In this paper, we consider private saving, which we define as the difference 
6:161:11894:27:27:72:543:108:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:between domestic saving and public saving. Considering that our interest is to assess the relative 
6:162:11993:27:0:72:542:81:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:importance of income and substitution effects on shaping the interest-rate impact on saving, it 
7:163:12091:0:27:72:431:702:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:would have been ideal if we had been able to focus on household saving.   
7:164:12165:27:27:112:543:675:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:However, we have two reasons for avoiding using household saving data—one conceptual 
7:165:12250:27:27:72:542:648:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and the other practical. First, in a practical sense, household saving data are extremely limited. 
7:166:12349:27:27:72:543:621:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:One reason for this scarcity is that household saving data are typically derived from government 
7:167:12446:27:27:72:543:594:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:surveys that could be based on a wide variety of methods across countries (and over time). Even 
7:168:12542:27:27:72:546:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:if we had a uniform survey method, disagreements could arise over what to include in consumption, 
7:169:12640:27:27:72:542:540:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:saving, or disposable income when calculating the saving rate. For example, the question exists 
7:170:12736:27:27:72:543:513:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:whether capital gains from financial investments should be included in saving or disposal income, 
7:171:12834:27:27:72:543:486:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:or both. Similar concerns arise for social security payments, or depreciation of household assets in 
7:172:12935:27:27:71:543:459:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:saving or income. Depending on the methodologies of data construction, there can be a wide 
7:173:13026:27:27:71:546:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:variety of household saving.2  Different types of household saving data exist for different countries. 
7:174:13129:27:27:72:542:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Also, the type of items that should be included in saving and income to compute the saving rate 
7:175:13225:27:27:72:542:378:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:depends on the aspect of saving behavior a researcher chooses to study. Hence, a data set of 
7:176:13318:27:27:72:543:351:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:household saving rate that is consistently compiled is hard to obtain. Although the OECD publishes 
7:177:13417:27:27:72:542:324:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:consistent household saving data for 33 countries, the data are mostly composed from advanced 
7:178:13511:27:27:72:135:297:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:economies.   
7:179:13524:27:27:112:543:270:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:There is also a conceptual reason that makes it difficult to use household saving data. The 
7:180:13616:27:27:72:543:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:line between household and corporate saving, which sum up to define private saving, can be blurry. 
7:181:13715:27:27:72:543:216:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:This issue is prevalent among developing countries because of the existence of vast informal labor 
7:182:13814:27:27:72:542:189:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:markets that make it difficult to separate corporate income from household income and vice versa. 
7:183:13912:27:27:72:542:162:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:To a certain extent, there are also difficulties in disentangling household, corporate income, and 
7:184:14011:27:44:72:261:135:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:consumption in advanced economies.   
7:185:14048:44:8:72:219:91:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:                                                 
7:186:14097:8:0:72:426:83:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:2  There can also be gross or net household saving. See Audenis et al. (2004) for details. 
8:187:14190:0:27:114:542:702:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Hence, we focus on private saving as a share of GDP, in which we obtain the amount of 
8:188:14276:27:27:72:543:675:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:private saving by subtracting the general government-budget balance from domestic saving while 
8:189:14371:27:27:72:454:648:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:assuming the latter equals the sum of household, corporate, and public savings.

8:191:14451:27:27:71:407:594:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:C:2.2 Theoretical Predictions of the Determinants of Private Saving 
8:192:14516:27:27:112:543:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:We now discuss the theories underlying the determinants of private saving and, hence, the 
8:193:14606:27:27:72:444:540:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:expected signs of estimated coefficients in the following empirical analysis.   
8:194:14686:27:27:112:543:513:144:Times:144:g_d0_f4:A:Persistence: Considering that economic agents usually try to smooth their consumption, 
8:195:14773:27:27:72:543:486:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:private saving should also be smoothed out, and therefore, it tends to be serially correlated. Also, 
8:196:14874:27:27:72:543:459:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the determinants of private saving can have impact with some time lags; thus, private saving tends 
8:197:14973:27:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:to show inertia. A number of empirical studies include the lagged dependent variable as one of the 
8:198:15072:27:27:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:explanatory  variables,  and  the  lagged  dependent  variable  tends to  be  highly  significant  with 
8:199:15176:27:27:72:214:378:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:relatively large magnitudes.   
8:200:15207:27:27:112:542:351:144:Times:144:g_d0_f4:A:Public  saving:  The theory of Ricardian equivalence predicts that, in a world where tax 
8:201:15296:27:27:72:542:324:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:policy creates no distortion, any change in public saving can be offset exactly by the same but 
8:202:15392:27:27:72:542:297:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:opposite change in private saving, which makes its estimate negative with a magnitude of one. 
8:203:15486:27:27:72:543:270:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:However, empirical studies usually show that a full offset is not existent, but that a partial offset is 
8:204:15591:27:27:72:416:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:often prevalent, with the average absolute estimate ranging 0.25–0.60.3 
8:205:15662:27:27:114:543:216:144:Times:144:g_d0_f4:A:Credit growth: If credit constraint is mitigated by credit growth, agents would increase 
8:206:15751:27:27:72:542:189:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:their consumption, and hence, decrease saving (Loayza et al., 2000a, 2000b). Therefore, we can 
8:207:15846:27:27:72:542:162:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:expect the estimate on credit growth to be negative. We include the growth rate of private credit 
8:208:15944:27:44:72:450:135:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:creation (as a share of GDP) as a proxy for credit growth or credit availability. 
8:209:16026:44:8:72:219:91:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:                                                 
8:210:16075:8:0:72:189:83:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:3  See de Mello et al. (2004). 
9:211:16108:0:27:112:543:702:144:Times:144:g_d0_f4:A:Financial development: Further financial development or deepening could induce more 
9:212:16192:27:27:72:543:675:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:saving through increased depth and sophistication of the financial system. As a contrasting view, 
9:213:16290:27:27:72:543:648:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:more developed financial markets lessen the need for precautionary saving and thereby lower the 
9:214:16386:27:27:72:543:621:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:saving rate. Thus, the predicted sign of the estimate for the financial development variable is 
9:215:16482:27:27:72:552:594:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:ambiguous. We use private credit creation (as a share of GDP) as a proxy for financial development.   
9:216:16584:27:27:112:543:567:144:Times:144:g_d0_f4:A:Financial  openness:  The impact of financial openness on saving behavior can also be 
9:217:16669:27:27:72:542:540:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:explained similarly to that of financial development. To measure the extent of financial openness, 
9:218:16768:27:27:72:421:513:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:we use the Chinn-Ito index (2006, 2008) of capital account openness.4  
9:219:16839:27:27:112:543:486:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Both financial development and financial openness could affect the level of private saving 
9:220:16930:27:27:72:543:459:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:through  the  price  channel. That  is,  financial  development  and  liberalization  usually  mitigates 
9:221:17035:27:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:financial repression, in which the interest rate tends to be artificially depressed due to regulatory 
9:222:17137:27:27:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:controls and lack of competition. Once financial repression is mitigated, higher interest rates can 
9:223:17237:27:27:72:542:378:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:prevail and affect private saving, although the effect of interest rates on saving can be ambiguous. 
9:224:17338:27:27:72:543:351:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:We  can  expect,  at the very  least,  to  see  interactive  effects  between  financial  development  or 
9:225:17444:27:27:72:219:324:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:openness and the interest rate. 
9:226:17476:27:27:112:543:297:144:Times:144:g_d0_f4:A:Output volatility: Risk-averse consumers who face more volatile income flows might set 
9:227:17563:27:27:72:542:270:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:resources aside for precautionary reasons in order to mitigate unexpected future income shocks

10:238:18468:27:27:71:543:675:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:on other factors including credit constraint. Vast empirical literature has shown that income levels 
10:239:18569:27:27:71:252:648:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:are positively correlated with saving.

10:247:19184:27:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:development can be negative. However, both the permanent income hypothesis (Friedman, 1957) 
10:248:19276:27:27:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and the lifetime-cycle hypothesis (Modigliani and Brumberg, 1954) predict that the impact of 
10:249:19369:27:27:72:542:378:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:income shocks on consumption—i.e., saving—depends on whether the shocks are temporary or 
10:250:19458:27:27:72:542:351:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:permanent. Although temporary positive shocks to income would lead merely to an increase in 
10:251:19550:27:27:72:543:324:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:saving but no change in consumption, permanent shocks might lead to an increase in consumption, 
10:252:19646:27:27:72:542:297:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:that is, a decrease in saving.7  In either case, per capita income should lead positively to saving 
10:253:19746:27:27:72:543:270:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:based on these hypotheses. Furthermore, more practically, a measure of per capita income can be 
10:254:19842:27:27:72:543:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:highly  correlated  with  the  level  of  institutional  or  legal  development.  Economies  with  more 
10:255:19946:27:27:72:543:216:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:developed institutions or legal systems can provide a friendly environment for saving, which also 
10:256:20044:27:27:72:543:189:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:suggests a positive impact of income level. Thus, the predicted sign of a measure of economic 
10:257:20138:27:27:72:251:162:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:development should be ambiguous.

11:263:20617:27:27:72:542:648:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:effect on saving; for example, the lower the interest rate, the higher the level of consumption—i.e., 
11:264:20719:27:27:72:544:621:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:leading to a lower level of saving. On the other hand, changes in the interest rate could have an 
11:265:20817:27:27:72:542:594:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:income effect. In other words, the lower the interest rate, the higher the expected level of saving, 
11:266:20918:27:27:72:542:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:because the lower rate of return from investment must be compensated by a higher saving rate.

12:289:22573:27:27:72:543:621:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:falls in the late 1990s and rebounds in the early 2000s. IDCs’ private saving rates start rising again 
12:290:22676:27:27:71:542:594:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:in 2007, followed by EMG in 2008, with both peaking in 2010. Considering the mortgage crisis in 
12:291:22772:27:27:71:542:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the U.S. and Europe in 2007 and the 2008 GFC, one interpretation is that people increased their 
12:292:22868:27:27:71:542:540:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:savings in response to heightened economic uncertainty, which was accompanied with falls in

12:294:22978:27:27:112:543:486:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:When we compare individual economies and regional groups of economies (Panel (b)), 
12:295:23061:27:27:71:543:459:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:China, with high saving rates, appears as an outlier—a fact that has been documented by many 
12:296:23154:27:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:observers. China is followed, with some gaps, by other emerging Asian market economies. The

12:298:23347:27:27:72:542:378:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:over the last two decades. All individual economies or country groups appear to have experienced 
12:299:23444:27:27:72:543:351:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:a discrete rise in saving rates in 2009, followed by a moderate fall in the last five years of the

12:303:23680:27:27:112:543:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:From the late 1990s through the mid-2000s, many countries have experienced persistent 
12:304:23766:27:27:72:543:216:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:declines in the real interest rates. Both panels on the top row show that the real interest rates have 
12:305:23869:27:27:72:543:189:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:been converging throughout that period. At the same time, the nominal interest rate has continued 
12:306:23967:27:27:72:543:162:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:to fall while the inflation rate has remained stable. All of these factors point to characteristics of a 
12:307:24072:27:27:72:542:135:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Great Moderation. In 2008, the real interest rates fell sharply, which reflected a sharp rise in 
12:308:24169:27:27:72:542:108:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:inflation mostly due to high energy prices, as well as sharp drops in the nominal interest rates that 
12:309:24271:27:0:72:542:81:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:were implemented as stabilization measures in response to the GFC. In the post-GFC period, 
13:310:24365:0:27:72:542:702:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:advanced economies implemented the zero interest-rate policy, which was followed by declines in

13:312:24554:27:27:72:543:648:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:nominal  interest  rates  remained  relatively  constant  (i.e.,  constantly  low  or  constantly  zero), 
13:313:24660:27:27:72:543:621:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:inflation rates continuously fell after 2011. All of these factors contributed to a continuous rise in 
13:314:24763:27:27:72:178:594:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the real interest rates.

13:316:24875:27:27:72:543:540:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:between the first five years (i.e., 1995–1999) of the sample period—when the real interest rates 
13:317:24972:27:27:72:543:513:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:were generally high—and the last five years (i.e., 2010–2015)—when the real interest rates were 
13:318:25068:27:27:72:542:486:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:generally low.9  The correlation for the full sample is significantly negative for the last five years, 
13:319:25172:27:27:72:543:459:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:suggesting  that  the  interest  rate  has  had  an  income  effect  on  private  saving,  while  it  is  only 
13:320:25283:27:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:insignificantly negative in the first five years. The slopes in the two periods are significantly 
13:321:25381:27:27:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:different. When we look at the subgroups, the correlation is significantly positive for the EMG 
13:322:25477:27:27:72:540:378:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:countries in both periods with no significant change in the slope between the two periods. The non-
13:323:25576:27:27:72:543:351:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:EMG LDC group has a significantly negative slope only in the last five-year period, which is 
13:324:25669:27:27:72:543:324:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:significantly different from the first five years. For the IDC group, interestingly, the correlation 
13:325:25770:27:27:72:543:297:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:becomes positive in the last five-year period, although it is significantly negative in the first period. 
13:326:25876:27:27:72:543:270:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Lastly, for the Asian EMG subgroup, the correlation is more significantly negative with a larger 
13:327:25973:27:27:72:543:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:magnitude in the last five years compared to the first period. Overall, there is evidence that the 
13:328:26072:27:27:72:543:216:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:nature of the correlation has changed over the two periods, and that the correlation becomes more

13:330:26245:27:27:112:543:162:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Naturally, there are limits to this kind of exercise with unconditional correlations. Hence, 
13:331:26338:27:32:72:397:135:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:we implement a more formal empirical analysis in the next section.

13:333:26454:9:15:72:542:94:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:9  To exclude outliers, we remove the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of private saving and real interest rate observations for 
13:334:26575:15:0:71:451:79:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:each sample. We also remove country years for which the rate of inflation is greater than 40%.

14:338:26723:27:27:72:543:621:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B: With the above theoretical discussions and stylized facts in mind,  we  estimate  the 
14:339:26809:27:27:72:382:594:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:determinants of private saving using the empirical specification:

14:341:26875:26:28:337:424:541:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:,     (1) 
14:342:26885:28:27:108:111:513:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: 
14:343:26885:27:27:72:543:486:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:where yit is private saving (normalized by GDP); X is a vector of endogenous variables; Z is a 
14:344:26980:27:26:71:545:459:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:vector of exogenous variables; and rit is the real interest rate. ui refers to unobserved, time-invariant, 
14:345:27087:26:28:72:542:433:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:country-specific effects, whereas  is a time-specific effect variable.      is the i.i.d. error term.   
14:346:27191:28:27:114:542:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Equation (1) entails a few possible technical issues. First, as we have already discussed, 
14:347:27282:27:27:72:543:378:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:private saving can involve inertia. To allow for persistency in private-saving data, we need to 
14:348:27378:27:27:72:542:351:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:estimate a dynamic specification that can address both short- and long-term effects of explanatory 
14:349:27477:27:27:72:542:324:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:variables. Second, some of the explanatory variables can be jointly determined with the saving 
14:350:27572:27:27:72:543:297:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:rate. Hence, we have to account for joint endogeneity of the explanatory variables. Last, we need 
14:351:27670:27:27:72:543:270:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:to  control  for  unobserved  country-specific  effects  correlated  with  the  regressors. The  system 
14:352:27774:27:27:72:543:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation method, which can consistently estimate a 
14:353:27863:27:27:72:543:216:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:dynamic panel while allowing for joint endogeneity and controlling for potential biases arising 
14:354:27959:27:27:72:542:189:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:from country-specific effects, is therefore adopted for our empirical exercise (Arellano and Bond, 
14:355:28058:27:27:72:369:162:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:1991; Arellano and Bover, 1995; Blundell and Bond, 1998).   
14:356:28118:27:27:114:543:135:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:In  the  vector  X  of  endogenous  variables,  we  include  public  saving  (i.e.,  the  general

15:362:28560:27:27:72:543:675:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:in the GMM estimation. As exogenous variables, vector Z includes young and old dependency 
15:363:28650:27:27:72:543:648:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:ratios, public healthcare expenditure (as a share of GDP), financial openness, output volatility, and 
15:364:28752:27:27:72:206:621:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:per capita income growth.   
15:365:28780:27:27:114:543:594:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:The variable of our focus is the real interest rate r. If the substitution effect outweighs the 
15:366:28876:27:27:72:542:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:income effect, the estimate of β1 is expected to be positive. That is, the higher the interest rate, the 
15:367:28981:27:27:72:542:540:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:more the country would save. On the other hand, if the income effect outweighs the income effect, 
15:368:29079:27:27:72:458:513:144:g_d0_f10:144:g_d0_f4:B:β1 would be negative; that is, the higher the interest rate, the less private saving.

15:371:29187:27:27:117:543:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Table 1 reports the results of the estimations for the full sample and the subsamples of 
15:372:29276:27:27:72:542:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:industrialized  countries  (IDC),  less  developing  countries  (LDC),  emerging  market  countries 
15:373:29376:27:27:72:543:378:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:(EMG), Latin American EMG (LATAM EMG), Asian economies, (Asia), and the emerging market 
15:374:29464:27:27:72:234:351:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:countries in Asia (Asian-EMG).   
15:375:29497:27:27:117:546:324:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Before  discussing  the  system  GMM  estimates,  we  conduct  diagnostic tests for the 
15:376:29585:27:27:72:542:297:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:validity of the instruments and serial correlation in estimated residuals. For the former, we conduct 
15:377:29687:27:27:72:543:270:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the Hansen-J test against the null hypothesis that the instrumental variables are uncorrelated with 
15:378:29787:27:27:72:542:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the residuals. If the test fails to reject the null hypothesis, the specification is free of the issue of 
15:379:29893:27:27:72:542:216:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:over-identification. As for serial correlation, we conduct an AR(2) test with the null hypothesis 
15:380:29991:27:27:72:542:189:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:that the errors in the differenced equation exhibit no second-order correlation. This is because the 
15:381:30092:27:27:72:543:162:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:system GMM method involves a first-difference transformation of the original estimation model 
15:382:30186:27:27:72:328:135:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:to eliminate the unobserved country-specific effect.   
15:383:30241:27:27:117:542:108:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:The estimated system GMM model specification is supported if no evidence exists of 
15:384:30324:27:0:72:543:81:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:second-order autocorrelation (even there is first-order autocorrelation) and the over-identifying 
16:385:30425:0:27:72:384:702:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:restrictions are not rejected at conventional levels of confidence. 
16:386:30493:27:27:117:542:675:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:In Table 1 and the other tables, the reported diagnostic test results—both the Hansen-J 
16:387:30581:27:27:72:542:648:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and AR(2) test results—support the use of the system GMM model specification for all of these 
16:388:30675:27:27:72:543:621:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:samples. That is, the Hansen test fails to reject the null hypothesis of over-identifying restrictions, 
16:389:30779:27:27:72:539:594:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and the AR(2) test confirms that the estimated errors in the differenced equation exhibit no second-
16:390:30879:27:27:72:175:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:order correlation.10  
16:391:30901:27:27:117:501:540:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Generally, the estimation results are consistent with our theoretical discussions. 
16:392:30984:27:27:117:542:513:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:First, the real interest rate, the variable of our focus, enters the estimation significantly 
16:393:31078:27:27:72:542:486:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:for the full sample and the subsample of Asian economies group with a positive sign. This means 
16:394:31174:27:27:72:543:459:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:we detect that the substitution effect outweighs the income effect for these groups of countries. For 
16:395:31276:27:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the other samples, the estimates are positive, except in the cases of LATAM and Asian EMG, which 
16:396:31373:27:27:72:171:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:are not significant.   
16:397:31396:27:27:117:542:378:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:The  behavior  of  private  saving  is  found  to  be  somewhat  persistent.  The  degree  of 
16:398:31490:27:27:72:543:351:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:persistency is 0.390 for the full sample, although this varies across different subsamples. The 
16:399:31586:27:27:72:543:324:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:groups of Asian economies and Asian EMG have higher degrees of persistency, which is consistent 
16:400:31682:27:27:71:498:297:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:with the prevailing observation that Asian economies’ saving rates are consistently high. 
16:401:31772:27:27:116:543:270:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:We can observe evidence for the partial Ricardian offset. The results of the full sample 
16:402:31861:27:27:71:543:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:indicate that about 44% of an improvement in public saving would be offset by a worsening of 
16:403:31954:27:33:72:542:216:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:private  saving.  The  size  of  the  offset  is  much  larger  among  industrialized  countries  than  in 
16:404:32061:33:8:72:219:183:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:                                                 
16:405:32110:8:15:72:542:175:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:10  However, Roodman (2006) argues that including too many instruments cannot only overly fit endogenous variables, 
16:406:32226:15:12:71:542:160:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:but also weaken the power of the Hansen test to detect over-identification. He suggests that high p-values (such as 
16:407:32342:12:11:71:542:148:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:“1.00”) for the Hansen test may signal that the test wrongly failed to detect over-identification. In fact, in Table 1 and 
16:408:32465:11:12:71:542:137:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:others, we see that the smaller the sample (such as IDC, EMG, and regional country groups), the more tendency for 
16:409:32579:12:11:71:542:125:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:the Hansen test’s p-value to take the value of “1.00.” This can be related to the fact that in a smaller sample, N (= the 
16:410:32701:11:12:71:542:114:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:number of countries) tends to be small relatively to T (= the number of years)—the GMM estimation is more suitable 
16:411:32816:12:11:71:542:102:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:for a data set with the dimension of large N and small T. However, when we apply the random effect model (not 
16:412:32926:11:12:71:542:91:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:reported), the estimation results are qualitatively intact; in fact, they tend to become more robust. Hence, we focus on 
16:413:33047:12:0:71:273:79:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:discussing the results from the GMM estimations. 
17:414:33099:0:27:72:543:702:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:developing economies, which may be because the tax system in the former is less distortive than 
17:415:33195:27:27:72:138:675:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:in the latter.   
17:416:33212:27:27:117:543:648:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:While  the  level  of  financial  development  only  matters  for  industrialized  economies, 
17:417:33306:27:27:72:543:621:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:credit  growth  is  found  to  be  a  negative  contributor  for  developing  economies.  Once  credit 
17:418:33409:27:27:72:543:594:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:conditions improve, a developing country tends to experience growth in its consumption—that is, 
17:419:33505:27:27:72:190:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:a fall in its saving rate.   
17:420:33534:27:27:117:543:540:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Financial openness, in contrast, is a positive contributor, although only for the IDC and 
17:421:33624:27:27:72:542:513:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the LATAM EMG. For these economies, financial openness helps increase private saving through 
17:422:33717:27:27:72:249:486:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:increasing investment opportunities. 
17:423:33754:27:27:117:542:459:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Although both the level and the growth of per capita income are found to positively 
17:424:33838:27:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:contribute to private saving, output volatility has opposing effects for developed countries and the 
17:425:33939:27:27:72:234:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:group of Asian-EMG economies. 
17:426:33969:27:27:117:543:378:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:The higher the country’s level of old dependency, the lower the rate of private saving it 
17:427:34059:27:27:72:543:351:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:tends to experience. Although the estimate on the old dependency variable is not significant for 
17:428:34156:27:27:72:542:324:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the LDC or EMG group, the estimates for the subgroups of LATAM, Asia, and Asian-EMG are 
17:429:34244:27:27:72:542:297:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:significant and their magnitudes tend to be large. However, smaller numbers of countries are 
17:430:34337:27:27:72:543:270:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:included in each of the estimations, which indicate that demographical change happened rather 
17:431:34431:27:27:72:542:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:drastically in the sample period and had significant impact on private saving for the countries in 
17:432:34530:27:27:71:160:216:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:these subsamples. 
17:433:34548:27:27:116:542:189:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Healthcare expenditure, which we measure by public health expenditure as a share of 
17:434:34632:27:27:71:543:162:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:GDP, has a negative impact on private saving. That is, if healthcare is more readily available with 
17:435:34732:27:27:71:543:135:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the support of the public sector, people reduce saving because they would not have to save for 
17:436:34827:27:27:71:543:108:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:precautionary reasons. The estimate is robust across the different country groups based on income 
17:437:34925:27:0:71:542:81:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:levels (i.e., full, IDC, LDC, and EMG). Also, when we use social expenditure as a share of GDP 
18:438:35023:0:27:72:452:702:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:that is available in the OECD database, the results are essentially unchanged.11 
18:439:35103:27:27:117:543:675:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:We also test property prices and net (foreign) investment as potential determinants of 
18:440:35190:27:27:72:156:648:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:private savings.   
18:441:35209:27:27:117:543:621:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:A  rise  in  house  prices  could  create  a  “wealth  effect”  on  consumption  while 
18:442:35296:27:27:72:543:594:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:simultaneously  mitigating  credit  constraint.  Either  way,  we  expect  property  prices  to  have  a 
18:443:35401:27:27:72:542:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:negative impact on saving. We find such a negative impact only for EMG (Appendix 3, Table 
18:444:35490:27:27:72:543:540:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:A1).12  However, when we test the growth-rate impact of property prices, we find that its estimate 
18:445:35589:27:27:72:542:513:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:is significantly negative for the full sample and the LDC subgroup (Table A2). In these samples, 
18:446:35686:27:27:72:542:486:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:what matters is not so much the level of property prices as its growth rate. A rapid rise in property 
18:447:35788:27:27:72:402:459:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:prices may signal an increase in future or permanent income flows.   
18:448:35857:27:27:112:543:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Another determinant of our concern is net investment position. Foreign saving can either 
18:449:35946:27:27:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:complement domestic private saving or crowd out domestic private saving. Facing credit constraint 
18:450:36044:27:27:72:543:378:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:domestically, developing countries often try to import foreign saving. However, they also have to 
18:451:36142:27:27:72:543:351:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:face external borrowing constraints, such as difficulties in borrowing in their own currencies or 
18:452:36240:27:27:72:542:324:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:for the long terms (i.e., the “original sin” argument). In fact, Aizenman et al. (2007) estimate that 
18:453:36342:27:27:72:543:297:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:only 10% of the capital stock in developing countries is funded with foreign saving, which means 
18:454:36439:27:27:72:205:270:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:that 90% is self-financed.13 
18:455:36467:27:27:112:542:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:We test whether net investment positions affect the private saving rate by including a 
18:456:36554:27:33:72:543:216:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:dummy for country-years in which the net position is negative.14  The estimation results (Table

18:458:36699:8:12:72:542:175:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:11  The data are available only for OECD countries as well as for 1980, 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2009–2014. 
18:459:36816:12:11:72:352:163:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:12  Nabar (2011) and Geerolf and Grjebine (2013) find similar results. 
18:460:36887:11:15:72:542:152:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:13  They also show that countries with higher self-financing ratios grew significantly faster than countries with low 
18:461:37005:15:8:72:157:137:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:self-financing ratios. 
18:462:37028:8:15:72:542:129:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:14  For the dummy variable, we use the data of external assets and liabilities from the Lane-Ferretti data set (2001, 
18:463:37146:15:12:71:542:114:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:2007, updates). We use this data set because we find that the net investment position as a share of GDP does not have 
18:464:37264:12:11:71:543:102:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:a significant impact for all the samples. This insignificant result is not surprising given that the data for financial center 
18:465:37390:11:12:71:542:91:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:countries (e.g., Ireland, Hong Kong, Singapore) and heavily indebted countries can be outliers affecting the estimation

19:468:37621:27:27:72:229:675:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:complements domestic saving.

19:471:37695:27:27:112:543:594:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:The weak evidence of the real interest-rate effect in Table 1 is likely to be attributable to 
19:472:37789:27:27:72:543:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:its dependency on other economic conditions affecting the saving decision. Our sample period, for 
19:473:37887:27:27:72:543:540:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:instance, includes the GFC and consequential implementations of unconventional monetary policy 
19:474:37982:27:27:72:542:513:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:by advanced economies, such as quantitative easing and negative interest-rate policies. These 
19:475:38076:27:27:72:542:486:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:unconventional monetary policies were implemented primarily in response to financial instabilities 
19:476:38175:27:27:72:543:459:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:experienced by the U.S. and several euro member countries. However, these policies also created 
19:477:38271:27:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:repercussions among emerging market economies through surges of capital flows triggered by 
19:478:38362:27:27:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:extremely low rate of returns in advanced economies and now possible retrenchment of such flows 
19:479:38458:27:27:72:542:378:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:due to U.S. monetary contraction, which began in late 2015. Thus, spillovers of the GFC and 
19:480:38550:27:27:72:542:351:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:unconventional monetary policy heightened the level of uncertainty among advanced economies 
19:481:38642:27:27:72:543:324:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:as  well  as  emerging  market  economies,  which  may  have  impacted  saving  behavior.  More 
19:482:38738:27:27:72:542:297:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:specifically,  low  interest  rates  may  signal  future  monetary  uncertainty  or  financial  condition 
19:483:38844:27:27:72:424:270:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:uncertainty and thereby encourage people toward precautionary saving.   
19:484:38916:27:27:112:542:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Against this backdrop, we examine whether low real- or nominal-interest rates have any 
19:485:39003:27:27:72:435:216:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:impact on the link between the real interest rate and the private saving rate. 
19:486:39082:27:27:112:542:189:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:The estimation model shown below includes the interaction between the real interest rate 
19:487:39171:27:27:72:543:162:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and  the  dummy  for  a  certain  threshold  of  the  real  or  nominal  interest  rate.  In  the  following 
19:488:39280:27:27:72:542:135:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:regression equation, D takes a value of one when the interest rate of concern is below a certain 
19:489:39377:27:27:72:345:108:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:threshold; that is D = I (interest rate < threshold value),

20:493:39508:27:27:112:543:639:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Here, we are interested in examining whether any threshold impact exists regarding the 
20:494:39595:27:27:72:543:612:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:real or nominal, or both, interest rates. Conceptually, it is reasonable to simply focus on the real 
20:495:39696:27:27:72:542:585:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:interest rate as a threshold. However, since the implementation of zero- or negative-interest rate 
20:496:39795:27:27:72:542:558:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:policies,  the  nominal  interest  rate  has  received  more  general  attention. Also,  given  nominal 
20:497:39899:27:27:72:543:531:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:rigidities that create a money illusion, setting the nominal interest rate at an extremely low level 
20:498:40000:27:27:72:542:504:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:can have more than mere announcement effects. Hence, we investigate whether and how low real- 
20:499:40094:27:27:72:308:477:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and nominal interest rates impact private saving. 
20:500:40144:27:27:112:542:450:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Table 2 reports the estimation results. The first column of the top of Panel (a) reports only 
20:501:40238:27:27:72:542:423:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the estimates for the real interest-rate variable (β1), and the interaction term between the real 
20:502:40336:27:26:72:542:396:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:interest rate and the dummy variable that assumes a value of one when the real interest rate is 
20:503:40432:26:28:72:542:370:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:below -2% (2).    The other estimates are omitted to conserve space. The second column reports 
20:504:40528:28:27:72:543:342:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the estimates for the real interest rate and its interaction term but the threshold is -1%, with the 
20:505:40629:27:27:72:543:315:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:other columns showing the cases of 0%, 1%, and 2% thresholds, respectively, toward the farthest

20:507:40825:27:27:71:542:261:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:dummy variable is assigned based on the threshold of the nominal interest instead of the real 
20:508:40919:27:27:71:542:234:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:interest rate, taking the values of 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, or 2.5%, as seen from the farthest left

20:510:41036:27:43:112:542:180:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:While Panel (a) uses the full sample for the estimation, Panels (b) through (f) report the 
20:511:41127:43:8:72:219:137:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:                                                 
20:512:41176:8:15:72:542:129:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:15  For example, column 1 of the top of Panel (a) shows that the estimate on the real interest rate (0.104) is the response 
20:513:41300:15:12:71:542:114:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:of private saving to the real interest rate when it is above -2%, whereas the response is (0.104-0.048) when the real 
20:514:41418:12:11:71:542:102:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:interest rate is below -2%, although both estimates are statistically insignificant. When the nominal interest rate is 
20:515:41537:11:12:71:542:91:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:used as the threshold, the response would not be different from when the nominal interest rate is above 2.5% because 
20:516:41654:12:0:71:354:79:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:the estimate of the interaction (i.e., 0.045) is statistically insignificant. 
21:517:41735:0:26:72:393:702:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:results for IDC, LDC, EMG, Asia, and Asian EMG, respectively.   
21:518:41799:26:28:112:543:676:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:When the estimate (2) is found to be significant, it would mean that the impact of the 
21:519:41887:28:27:72:543:648:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:real interest rate on private saving changes when the real or nominal interest rate is below a certain 
21:520:41990:27:27:72:101:621:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:level. 
21:521:41997:27:26:112:542:594:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:In Panel (a), in the presence of real interest rate regime variables, there is no evidence of 
21:522:42091:26:28:72:543:568:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:significant the real interest rate effect (1). However, when we control for low nominal interest 
21:523:42189:28:27:72:542:540:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:rate regime, the real interest rate effect becomes significantly positive – the estimated substitution 
21:524:42292:27:27:72:544:513:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:effect is in accordance with the full sample result in Table 1.16   As far as the full sample is 
21:525:42389:27:27:72:531:486:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:concerned, low nominal interest rates affect the way the real interest rate affects private saving. 
21:526:42489:27:27:108:544:459:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:For the subsample of industrialized countries (Panel (b)), the real interest rate has the 
21:527:42579:27:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:substitution effect when the real interest rate is lower than -1% or the nominal interest rate is lower 
21:528:42683:27:27:72:542:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:than 2.5%. In fact, when we test the threshold of 3%, the interaction term is still significant, and it 
21:529:42787:27:27:72:542:378:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:becomes  insignificant  at  the  3.5%  threshold  (not  reported).  For  this  group  of  countries,  the 
21:530:42893:27:27:72:479:351:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:substitution effect is dominant but only when the real or nominal interest rate is low. 
21:531:42981:27:27:112:542:324:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Results in Panel (c) are quite similar to the results of the full sample. According to the

21:533:43176:27:27:71:543:270:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:on  private  saving  whereas  countries  with  nominal  interest  rates  below  0.5%  have  stronger 
21:534:43277:27:27:72:543:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:substitution effects.17  These results indicate that, overall, the positive real interest rate effect is the 
21:535:43386:27:27:72:542:216:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:norm, and the threshold of the nominal interest rate is more relevant than that of the real interest

22:543:44020:0:27:112:543:702:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:When we look at the EMG group, the significant real interest effect appears when the 
22:544:44105:27:27:72:543:675:144:Times:144:g_d0_f4:B:nominal interest rate is below 2.5%, indicating that when the nominal interest rate is below 2.5%, 
22:545:44204:27:27:72:542:648:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the real interest rate has the positive effect on private saving among these economies.18  Also, it is 
22:546:44307:27:27:72:323:621:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:noted that the magnitude of the effect is quite large. 
22:547:44362:27:27:112:543:594:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:When we restrict our sample to Asian economies (Panel (e)), we only find that the real 
22:548:44449:27:27:72:542:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:interest  rate  generally  has  a  substitution  effect  on  private  saving.  The  group  of Asian  EMG 
22:549:44554:27:26:72:543:540:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:economies, however, displays a different pattern of real interest rate effects. In Panel (f), the

22:551:44752:28:27:72:543:486:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:interest rate is below 2.5%, private saving for Asian EMG would negatively respond to the real 
22:552:44847:27:27:72:474:459:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:interest rate movement. That is, the income effect outweighs the substitution effect.

22:556:44980:27:27:112:543:351:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Results in the previous section show that the real interest-rate effect, if significant, tends 
22:557:45075:27:27:72:542:324:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:to be positive; the substitution effect tends to dominate the income effect. The effect varies across 
22:558:45177:27:27:72:542:297:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:different country groups, and its magnitude can be influenced by the level of nominal interest rate. 
22:559:45278:27:27:72:543:270:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:In the case of the Asian EMG group, the real interest-rate effect has become negative when the 
22:560:45373:27:27:72:542:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:nominal interest rate is lower than 2.5%. Overall, these results suggest that the effect of the real 
22:561:45474:27:27:72:467:216:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:interest rate on private saving can depend on the economic environment at large.   
22:562:45557:27:27:112:543:189:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:In this section, we use interaction variables to explore the real interest-rate effect under 
22:563:45650:27:46:72:542:162:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:alternative economic conditions. For example, when an economy experiences a high level of

22:566:45858:18:0:72:337:86:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:19  The threshold of 3% is found to be insignificant (not reported).

23:568:46029:27:27:72:543:675:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:can strengthen the saving incentive. Alternatively, for an economy in which old dependency is 
23:569:46123:27:27:72:542:648:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:increasing, a lowering of the interest rate might encourage people to increase their rates of saving 
23:570:46224:27:27:71:353:621:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:to reach pre-determined target levels of retirement saving. 
23:571:46284:27:27:112:542:594:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:In the following, we investigate influences of the economic environment that are captured 
23:572:46374:27:26:72:542:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:by output volatility, old dependency, healthcare expenditure, financial development, and financial

23:585:47276:27:27:72:542:216:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:subsample of LDC. The output volatility is insignificant in the four cases under consideration. The

24:598:48246:27:27:72:458:675:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:subsample, as the IDC subsample has a significant positive coefficient estimate. 
24:599:48327:27:27:114:543:648:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Results in Table 3 indicate the possibility that, when output volatility increases, the real 
24:600:48420:27:27:72:543:621:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:interest-rate effect can change from positive to negative in the cases of the full-country sample and 
24:601:48522:27:27:72:543:594:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the LDC sample. For instance, the estimates from the full sample suggest that when the output 
24:602:48616:27:27:72:543:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:volatility is less than 9.24%, the marginal real interest-rate effect is positive, and when it is larger 
24:603:48721:27:27:72:542:540:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:that amount, the marginal effect will be negative.21  The threshold is found to be 9.68% for the 
24:604:48818:27:27:72:543:513:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:LDC subsample, which is driving the results of the full sample. When output volatility is higher 
24:605:48915:27:27:72:543:486:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:than the threshold, the income effect tends to strengthen and dominate the substitution effect. This 
24:606:49016:27:27:72:542:459:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:interpretation is in accordance with the notion that a high level of output volatility and a low level 
24:607:49119:27:27:72:542:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:of the real interest rate signal uncertainty and encourage people to increase precautionary saving 
24:608:49218:27:27:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:to meet pre-determined saving targets. However, the level of output volatility greater than the 
24:609:49314:27:27:72:543:378:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:threshold only happens in 3.2% of the LDC sample, which indicates that the interest rate effect is 
24:610:49413:27:27:72:316:351:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:negative only when output volatility is fairly high. 
24:611:49466:27:27:72:543:324:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B: This interactive effect is depicted graphically in the left panel of Figure 4. Because the 
24:612:49557:27:27:72:543:297:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:results of the full sample seem to be driven by developing countries, the figure is created using the 
24:613:49659:27:27:72:543:270:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:estimates from the LDC group. The linear line in the figure represents the effect of real interest 
24:614:49758:27:27:72:542:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:rates conditional upon the level of output volatility; the higher the level of output volatility, the

25:624:50492:27:27:72:543:675:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:with the dotted vertical line). Hence, for these economies, the real interest-rate movement would 
25:625:50590:27:26:72:266:648:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:have a positive effect on private saving. 
25:626:50632:26:28:114:543:622:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:When we focus on, we can see that the results for the full sample and LDC 
25:627:50706:28:27:72:543:594:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:indicate that output volatility would increase private saving if the real interest rate is lower than a 
25:628:50810:27:27:72:542:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:certain level. Based on these estimation results, the threshold is 0.93% for the full sample and 1.5% 
25:629:50912:27:27:72:542:540:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:for the LDC sample. These results suggest that when output movements become volatile in a very 
25:630:51007:27:27:72:542:513:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:low-interest rate environment, agents would respond to such an environment by increasing saving.

25:636:51505:27:27:71:543:351:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:negative for the full sample and the LDC subsample. The estimation results indicate that the real 
25:637:51603:27:27:71:542:324:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:interest rate has a negative impact (income effect) on private saving if the economy of concern has 
25:638:51703:27:27:71:542:297:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:a higher ratio of old dependency than 15.3% for the full sample and 16.1% for the LDC subsample. 
25:639:51800:27:27:71:543:270:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:In the full sample, 34.2% of the countries have higher old-dependency ratios than the threshold, 
25:640:51897:27:27:71:513:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:while 18% of the sample has higher ratios than the threshold among developing countries.   
25:641:51988:27:27:113:542:216:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Thus, an aging economy would tend to have higher saving when the real interest falls. 
25:642:52074:27:27:71:543:189:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Moreover, based on the estimates for the old dependency ratio and its interaction term with the 
25:643:52170:27:27:71:543:162:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:real interest rate, an economy with a higher level of old dependency tends to have lower private 
25:644:52267:27:27:71:542:135:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:saving, as predicted by the lifetime income hypothesis. However, the negative impact on private 
25:645:52363:27:27:71:543:108:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:saving tends to be smaller when its real interest rate is lower, suggesting that lower real-interest 
25:646:52464:27:0:71:545:81:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:rates would give people in aging populations less incentives to dissave. Thus, based on these results,

26:648:52579:0:27:72:542:702:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:an economy such as Hong Kong, which has both a low real-interest rate and a high old- dependency 
26:649:52676:27:27:72:297:675:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:ratio, tend to experience higher private saving. 
26:650:52725:27:27:114:542:648:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:In Table 5, while the real interest rate has a positive impact (substitution effect) on private 
26:651:52821:27:27:72:542:621:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:saving, its impact can become negative (income effect) if the economy of concern is equipped with 
26:652:52919:27:27:71:542:594:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:more developed financial markets. The thresholds in terms of private credit creation (as a share of 
26:653:53019:27:27:71:543:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:GDP) are 31.5% for the full sample and 27.9% for the LDC sample, accounting for 56.3% and 
26:654:53109:27:27:71:543:540:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:49.1% of each respective sample. At the same time, an economy with highly developed financial 
26:655:53202:27:27:71:542:513:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:markets tends to have lower private saving (as there is less need for precautionary saving). The 
26:656:53299:27:27:71:543:486:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:level of financial development alone contributes negatively to private saving, although the estimate 
26:657:53400:27:27:71:542:459:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:of  the  level  term  for  financial  development  is  not  significant. The  negative  effect,  however, 
26:658:53506:27:27:71:543:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:becomes  weaker  as  the  real  interest  rate  falls,  because  agents would  need  to  save  more  to 
26:659:53610:27:27:71:277:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:compensate for the low real-interest rate.   
26:660:53655:27:27:113:305:378:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Our analysis yields interesting results.   
26:661:53698:27:27:113:542:351:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:First, the positive effect of the real interest rate on saving appears to be the common 
26:662:53786:27:27:71:543:324:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:wisdom, which tends to be supported by many empirical studies, only a few of which have reported 
26:663:53883:27:27:71:409:297:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:a negative effect. Our baseline estimations affirm the positive effect.   
26:664:53957:27:27:113:542:270:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:However, we are able to reveal that an economic environment in which an interest rate 
26:665:54043:27:27:71:370:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:policy is implemented can mask negative interest-rate effects. 
26:666:54106:27:27:113:543:216:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:The  marginal  negative  effect  is  likely  to  occur  among  LDC  when certain  economic 
26:667:54197:27:27:71:542:189:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:conditions are met. Extremely high levels of output volatility could make the interest rate effect 
26:668:54296:27:27:71:542:162:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:negative. In economies with high levels of old dependency, lower interest rates are associated with 
26:669:54396:27:27:72:543:135:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:higher saving (i.e., the income effect of the lower interest rate dominates), and thus in countries 
26:670:54496:27:27:72:265:108:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:with more developed financial markets. 
26:671:54535:27:0:113:543:81:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:A low nominal-interest rate policy can yield different effects across country groups under 
27:672:54629:0:27:72:542:702:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:different economic environments. This means that low-interest rate policies adopted by advanced 
27:673:54725:27:27:72:542:675:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:countries to stimulate their economies could yield contractionary effects on developing countries, 
27:674:54824:27:27:72:369:648:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:leading them to increase saving while reducing consumption.

27:677:54926:27:27:72:543:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B: In the previous subsection, we showed that the impact of the real interest rate on private 
27:678:55017:27:27:72:542:540:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:saving depends on several macroeconomic or demographical conditions and economic policies. 
27:679:55108:27:27:72:551:513:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Let us now look into these conditions as they apply to several selected countries and country groups.   
27:680:55212:27:27:72:543:486:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B: The triangle charts in Figure 7 are helpful for tracing the patterns of output volatility, old 
27:681:55307:27:27:72:543:459:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:dependency, and financial development, all of which were found to have interactive effects with 
27:682:55403:27:39:72:383:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the real interest rate. Each of these variables are normalized as:   
27:683:55472:39:43:72:382:393:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:   ,     (3) 
27:684:55484:43:26:72:542:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:where    is the average of W over the 2011–2014 period and W refers to output volatility, old 
27:685:55578:26:27:72:542:324:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:dependency, and financial development. In each triangle, three vertices measure the three variables 
27:686:55678:27:27:72:543:297:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:with the origin normalized so as to represent zero (i.e., the minimal value) level. The observed 
27:687:55775:27:27:72:542:270:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:(and normalized) values of the three variables shown in solid lines are also compared with the 
27:688:55870:27:27:72:543:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:normalized thresholds based on the estimation models for the LDC sample shown in Tables 3 
27:689:55960:27:27:72:543:216:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:through 5.22  The thresholds are illustrated with dotted lines in each figure—the shape of the dotted 
27:690:56062:27:27:71:539:189:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:lines is the same in each triangle. The figure illustrates the triangles for the groups of EMG, non-
27:691:56162:27:27:71:509:162:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:EMG LDC, Latin American EMG, and ex-China Asian EMG, as well as China and Korea. 
27:692:56243:27:32:71:542:135:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B: Based on the results of Tables 3 through 5 and their illustrations in Figures 4 through 6,

27:694:56383:9:15:72:542:94:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:22  While we found significant results for the full sample, we conclude that the estimation results for the full sample 
27:695:56503:15:0:71:513:79:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:are primarily driven by developing countries. Hence, we focus our discussions on the LDC estimation results.

28:709:56661:0:27:72:543:702:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the real interest rate has a negative impact—i.e., income effect—on private saving if any output 
28:710:56758:27:27:72:441:675:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:volatility, old dependency, or financial development is above the threshold.   
28:711:56837:27:27:72:542:648:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B: We  can  see  that  on  average,  EMG  countries  have  an  average  level  of  financial 
28:712:56927:27:27:72:542:621:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:development above the threshold. However, the other conditions are below the threshold, which 
28:713:57021:27:27:72:542:594:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:applies to the group of ex-China Asian EMG, and, to a lesser extent, Latin American EMG, and 
28:714:57114:27:27:72:166:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:non-EMG LDC.     
28:715:57131:27:27:72:542:540:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B: Both China and Hong Kong stand out from the EMG group with their high levels of 
28:716:57211:27:27:72:543:513:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:financial development, which contribute to these two countries facing the negative impact of the 
28:717:57308:27:27:71:543:486:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:real  interest  rate.  Furthermore,  Hong  Kong  has  an  average  old  dependency  ratio  above  the 
28:718:57410:27:27:72:543:459:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:threshold, providing an example in which the real interest rate can have an income effect on an 
28:719:57506:27:27:72:212:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:aging-population economy.   
28:720:57534:27:27:72:542:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B: Table 3 and Figure 4 show that when the real interest rate is below 1.5%, greater output 
28:721:57623:27:27:72:542:378:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:volatility would lead to higher private saving. Tables 4 and 5 (and Figures 5 and 6) show that the 
28:722:57722:27:27:72:542:351:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:old dependency ratio and financial development can have negative impacts on private saving, but 
28:723:57818:27:27:72:543:324:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:such negative impacts in absolute values tend to become smaller as the real interest rate falls. Thus, 
28:724:57921:27:27:72:542:297:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:under low real interest rates, output volatility tends to increase private saving, and old dependency 
28:725:58023:27:27:72:540:270:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:ratio and the stage of financial development display a reduced negative impact on private saving. 
28:726:58121:27:27:72:543:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B: Figure 10 illustrates the ratios of private saving in GDP and the real interest rates, but only 
28:727:58217:27:27:72:543:216:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:for selected Asian economies, EMG, non-EMG LDC, and Latin American EMG. The dotted line 
28:728:58305:27:27:72:508:189:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:depicts the threshold of 1.5% for the impact of output volatility for developing countries.   
28:729:58399:27:27:72:542:162:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B: In this figure, we can see that Asian developing economies are distributed at lower levels 
28:730:58490:27:27:72:543:135:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:of the interest rate, with all of them, except for Sri Lanka, below the 1.5% threshold. Thus, these 
28:731:58590:27:27:72:542:108:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:economies tend to respond negatively to output volatility and less negatively to shocks to old 
28:732:58685:27:0:72:292:81:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:dependency, thus, to financial development.

29:735:58747:27:27:112:542:648:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:In the aftermath of the GFC, unconventional monetary policies, such as quantitative easing 
29:736:58838:27:27:72:542:621:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and negative interest-rate policies were implemented by advanced economies. While such policies 
29:737:58934:27:27:72:543:594:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:may  have  contributed  to  jumpstarting  these  economies,  their  implementation  also  created 
29:738:59032:27:27:72:542:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:uncertainty over the future direction of the economies and the financial systems. In particular, the 
29:739:59133:27:27:71:542:540:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:effectiveness of interest rate policies such as zero or negative interest-rate policies have been 
29:740:59231:27:27:72:542:513:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:questioned, along with implications for the financial sector. One frequently asked question is 
29:741:59326:27:27:72:543:486:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:whether  an  extremely  low  or  negative  interest-rate  policy  would  lead  to  lower  or  higher 
29:742:59427:27:27:72:543:459:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:consumption or saving. In this paper, we focus on this question and empirically investigate the link 
29:743:59528:27:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:between the interest rate and private saving. Our primary focus is whether the interest rate effect 
29:744:59628:27:27:72:472:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:is dominated by the income (i.e., negative) or the substitution (i.e., positive) effect. 
29:745:59717:27:27:113:542:378:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:First, our baseline estimations generally affirm the positive effect of the real interest rate 
29:746:59812:27:27:72:542:351:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:on private saving, although its estimate is significant only for the full sample and marginal for the 
29:747:59914:27:27:71:231:324:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:subsample of Asian economies.   
29:748:59946:27:27:113:542:297:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Given the weakly positive estimates, we suspect that if the interest rate has any impact on 
29:749:60038:27:27:71:543:270:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:private saving, its effect can be masked by uncertain economic environment. Our motive for this 
29:750:60134:27:27:71:543:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:investigation is that recent low interest rates may be coupled with greater uncertainty of future 
29:751:60232:27:27:71:543:216:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:monetary or financial conditions and thereby encourage people to engage in precautionary saving 
29:752:60328:27:27:71:252:189:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:when interest rates become very low. 
29:753:60365:27:27:113:543:162:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:When  we  investigate  whether  the  real  interest  rate  affects  private  saving  differently 
29:754:60462:27:27:71:543:135:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:depending on whether the real, or nominal, interest rate is below a certain threshold, we find some 
29:755:60562:27:27:71:542:108:144:g_d0_f4:144:Times:B:evidence that the impact of the real interest rate on private saving changes when the nominal 
29:756:60656:27:0:71:542:81:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:interest  rate  is  below  a  relatively  low  level. This  finding  may  indicate  that  certain  economic 
30:757:60767:0:27:72:545:702:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:environments affect the way interest rate policy is conducted and can impact interest rate effects.   
30:758:60869:27:27:113:542:675:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Therefore, we examine the impact of the real interest rate conditional upon economic 
30:759:60954:27:27:71:542:648:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:circumstances such as output volatility, old dependency ratio, and financial development. From 
30:760:61049:27:27:72:543:621:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:this investigation, we find that these conditions matter. Extremely high levels of output volatility 
30:761:61150:27:27:72:543:594:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:could make the interest rate effect negative. In economies with high levels of old dependency, the 
30:762:61249:27:27:72:542:567:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:income effect associated with a low interest rate dominates, and a similar observation applies to 
30:763:61347:27:27:72:308:540:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:countries with well-developed financial markets. 
30:764:61396:27:27:113:543:513:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:We also find that the impacts of such economic factors could also be affected by the real 
30:765:61486:27:27:72:542:486:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:interest rate. The impact of output volatility is found to be conditional upon the real interest rate, 
30:766:61589:27:27:72:542:459:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:especially when it is at a low level. That is, when the real interest rate is below 1.5%, greater output 
30:767:61694:27:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:volatility would lead to higher private saving in developing countries. Lastly, we find that an old 
30:768:61793:27:27:72:542:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:dependency ratio and financial development have negative impacts on private saving, but that 
30:769:61886:27:27:72:502:378:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:negative impacts in absolute values tend to become smaller as the real interest rate falls.   
30:770:61980:27:27:112:543:351:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Thus, a low-interest rate environment can yield different effects on private saving across 
30:771:62071:27:27:72:542:324:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:country groups under different economic environments. This means that low-interest rate policies 
30:772:62168:27:27:72:543:297:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:adopted by advanced countries to stimulus their economies can yield contractionary effects on 
30:773:62262:27:27:72:445:270:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:developing countries through encouraging saving and reducing consumption. 
30:774:62336:27:27:112:542:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Such  findings  are  relevant  to Asian  economies.  Many  of  them  are  characterized  by 
30:775:62428:27:27:72:543:216:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:relatively  well-developed  financial  markets.  Some  of  these  economies  are  also  experiencing 
30:776:62529:27:27:72:542:189:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:rapidly aging populations. Our empirical findings suggest that these factors are associated with the 
30:777:62630:27:27:72:321:162:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:dominance of the income effect on private saving.   
30:778:62682:27:27:112:543:135:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:It has been documented that advanced economies’ monetary or financial conditions can 
30:779:62767:27:27:72:542:108:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:have spillover effects on emerging market economies (e.g., Aizenman et al., 2016a and 2016b). 
30:780:62861:27:0:72:542:81:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:This means that, in emerging market economies, unconventional monetary policies can guide 
31:781:62954:0:27:72:542:702:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:interest rates to lower levels. Low interest rates could then contribute to higher private saving. All 
31:782:63057:27:27:72:542:675:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:of  these  findings  suggest  that  an  active  low-interest  rate  policy  in  advanced  economies  can 
31:783:63162:27:27:72:317:648:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:contribute to keeping global imbalances perennial.
