2:33:757:14:14:72:75:345:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
2:34:757:14:13:72:514:331:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:In this paper, we employ a spatial equilibrium growth model to examine the role of housing 
2:35:847:13:14:72:537:318:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:supply for differences in housing price and population growth across the provinces, autonomous 
2:36:941:14:14:72:518:304:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regions and municipalities of mainland China for 1999-2013. A distinguishing feature of the 
2:37:1031:14:14:72:512:290:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:model used from other spatial equilibrium models is a time-varying and regionally-varying 
2:38:1119:14:14:72:540:276:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:elasticity of housing supply. Regions in the East are found to have had the most inelastic housing 
2:39:1216:14:13:72:488:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:supply, while northern regions had the most elastic housing supply. The differences in 
2:40:1301:13:14:72:514:249:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:exogenous housing supply growth are shown to have significantly affected relative regional 
2:41:1391:14:14:72:512:235:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:population growth over the period, suggesting that housing policies can be used to promote 
2:42:1481:14:14:72:111:221:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:growth. 
2:43:1488:14:14:72:75:207:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
2:44:1488:14:27:72:152:193:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:1. Introduction 
2:45:1503:27:28:108:531:166:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The housing sector in China has undergone significant transformation in first becoming 
2:46:1590:28:27:72:534:138:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:privatized with reforms in 1988 and then becoming market-based with the 1998 reforms (Wang 
2:47:1681:27:28:72:539:111:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and Murie, 2000; Ye et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2009; Man et al., 2011). The move to a market-based 
2:48:1776:28:0:72:524:83:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:housing sector was accompanied by rapid urbanization and growth of housing supply. Across 
3:49:1867:0:28:72:523:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:provinces and municipalities, housing prices on average more than tripled. However, housing 
3:50:1958:28:28:72:480:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:price increases have been uneven across China (Yu, 2011; Wang and Zhang, 2014).  
3:51:2037:28:27:108:530:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Studies of regional housing markets in China have identified numerous determinants of 
3:52:2122:27:28:72:515:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regional and urban housing price increases (e.g., Yu, 2011; Hanink et al., 2012; Bian, 2013; 
3:53:2215:28:27:72:540:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Huang, 2014; Wang and Zhang, 2014). Variables identified in the studies include the availability 
3:54:2312:27:28:72:530:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of credit, construction costs, housing policies, income, land supply, population, preferences for 
3:55:2410:28:28:72:532:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:housing, tax treatment and speculative demand. Empirically identifying all the factors affecting 
3:56:2505:28:27:72:529:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:housing prices is extremely difficult. Some factors affect the demand for housing, while others 
3:57:2601:27:28:72:160:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:affect the supply.  
3:58:2620:28:27:108:527:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The housing price determinants identified in the above studies reveal then that housing 
3:59:2708:27:28:72:514:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:investment and prices can be affected by regional economic performance, in which housing 
3:60:2794:28:28:72:533:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:supply in turn can affect regional economic performance (Chen, 2011). Limited housing supply 
3:61:2885:28:27:72:529:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:cause housing prices to rise in the face of rising demand, making cities (regions) less attractive 
3:62:2984:27:28:72:501:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:for households for a given wage level (Quigley, 2008). A shortage of habitable land may 
3:63:3071:28:27:72:539:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:fundamentally limit future economic development in China (Keng, 2006). To be sure, policies to 
3:64:3166:27:28:72:511:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:increase housing or land supply can be used with the expressed purpose of increasing local 
3:65:3257:28:28:72:464:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economic competitiveness (Lin and Yi, 2011; Morrison, 2013; He et al., 2014).    
3:66:3337:28:27:108:516:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Therefore, in this paper, we use the spatial equilibrium growth model of Glaeser and 
3:67:3419:27:28:72:529:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Tobio (2008) to estimate the effects of differences in land and housing supply across mainland 
3:68:3513:28:27:72:510:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:China (i.e., excluding Hong Kong and Macao) over the period of 1999 to 2013. The model 
3:69:3599:27:28:72:474:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:separates changes in housing prices arising from innovations to firm and household 
3:70:3681:28:28:72:513:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:attractiveness from innovations in land supply. We then examine geographic patterns in the 
3:71:3769:28:0:72:526:101:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:differences in housing supply elasticity for the provinces and municipalities. We also estimate 
4:72:3865:0:28:72:511:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the proportions of relative housing price changes attributable to housing supply differences 
4:73:3958:28:28:72:497:681:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:across China’s regions and then assess the role of housing supply in influencing relative 
4:74:4046:28:27:72:250:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:population growth across the nation. 
4:75:4081:27:28:108:535:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:In the next section, we briefly discuss the literature on incorporating housing supply into 
4:76:4173:28:27:72:535:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regional growth analysis. Section 3 presents the theoretical framework of the model and derives 
4:77:4269:27:28:72:522:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the expression for innovations in regional land supply and the expressions for their effects on 
4:78:4362:28:28:72:508:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regional housing prices and population growth. Section 4 presents and discusses empirical 
4:79:4451:28:27:72:523:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:implementation of the model for the provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities under 
4:80:4541:27:28:72:524:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:central government control in China. Section 5 discusses the findings of the analysis. Primary 
4:81:4634:28:27:72:500:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:findings include the significant geographical differences in housing price growth and the 
4:82:4722:27:28:72:521:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:importance of differences in regional housing supply in explaining the differences in housing 
4:83:4816:28:28:72:512:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:price growth. Regions in the East had the most inelastic housing supply, while the northern 
4:84:4905:28:27:72:530:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regions had the most elastic housing supply. The differences in the elasticity of housing supply 
4:85:5002:27:28:72:537:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:are then demonstrated to greatly affect relative population growth, significantly reducing growth 
4:86:5100:28:27:72:516:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in the East, and to a lesser extent, increasing growth in the northern regions. The conclusion 
4:87:5193:27:28:72:330:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:contains a brief summary and concluding statements. 
4:88:5244:28:28:72:381:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2. Regional Housing Supply in Spatial Equilibrium Analysis 
4:89:5302:28:27:108:537:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The spatial equilibrium growth model of Glaeser and Tobio (2008) is an extension of the 
4:90:5390:27:28:72:529:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:canonical Rosen-Roback spatial equilibrium model (Rosen, 1979, Roback 1982). In the Rosen-
4:91:5480:28:27:72:531:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Roback model, land is used by both households and firms, and can be transferred between uses 
4:92:5572:27:28:72:524:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:without frictions. Perfect mobility of households and firms equalizes utility and profits across 
4:93:5669:28:0:72:537:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:space. Therefore, in spatial equilibrium wages and land rents reflect relative location advantages 
5:94:5769:0:28:72:539:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:for firms and households. Land rents increase (decrease) in response to higher (lower) household 
5:95:5866:28:28:72:296:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:amenity attractiveness and firm productivity.   
5:96:5912:28:27:72:523:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: The spatial equilibrium model has been used extensively to estimate both the regional 
5:97:5998:27:28:72:533:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:quality of life and the regional quality of the business environment in countries including China 
5:98:6095:28:27:72:539:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(Zheng et al., 2014b), Germany (Buettner and Ebertz, 2009), Russia (Berger et al., 2008) and the 
5:99:6192:27:28:72:537:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:United States (e.g., Roback, 1982; Blomquist et al., 1988; Beeson and Eberts, 1989; Gabriel and 
5:100:6287:28:28:72:536:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Rosenthal, 2004). Assuming that spatial equilibrium holds continuously, the effects of changing 
5:101:6383:28:27:72:546:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:household amenity attractiveness and productivity across regions can be examined (Gabriel et al., 
5:102:6480:27:28:72:521:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2003; Partridge et al., 2010). However, Rickman (2014) notes the passive role of the housing 
5:103:6572:28:27:72:520:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:sector in the traditional spatial equilibrium model, whereby regionally-uniform elasticities of 
5:104:6667:27:28:72:541:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:housing supply are assumed and exogenous changes in housing supply are not allowed in growth 
5:105:6760:28:28:72:121:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:analyses.  
5:106:6769:28:27:108:542:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:A number of studies then have incorporated differing elasticities of housing supply within 
5:107:6858:27:28:72:538:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:a spatial equilibrium model. Glaeser et al. (2006) retain the assumption of spatial equalization of 
5:108:6958:28:27:72:539:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:utility but do not impose equalization of profits. They then allow the elasticity of housing to vary 
5:109:7059:27:28:72:528:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:spatially and demonstrate empirically that labor demand innovations have larger housing price 
5:110:7153:28:28:72:528:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:effects and lower population growth in areas with less elastic housing supply. This can explain 
5:111:7249:28:27:72:523:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:why in declining U.S. cities there are larger responses in housing prices and lower population 
5:112:7344:27:28:72:510:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:outflows (Glaeser and Gyourko, 2005); houses are built more quickly than they depreciate, 
5:113:7433:28:27:72:518:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:making housing supply relatively inelastic in declining areas. Krupka and Donaldson (2013) 
5:114:7522:27:28:72:528:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:likewise expand the Rosen-Roback model such that household amenity attractiveness and firm 
5:115:7612:28:28:72:497:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:productivity do not solely determine wages and rents and impose additional equilibrium 
5:116:7697:28:0:72:301:101:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:conditions for the labor and housing markets.    
6:117:7743:0:28:108:494:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Glaeser and Tobio (2008) take the spatial equilibrium model one step further by 
6:118:7823:28:28:72:527:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:incorporating innovations in residential land supply. Local areas may enact restrictive housing 
6:119:7916:28:27:72:492:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:development policies in response to concerns with adverse effects of growth or may be 
6:120:8001:27:28:72:542:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:especially aggressive in promoting growth through expansive housing supply policies. Therefore, 
6:121:8097:28:27:72:519:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the model becomes fairly comprehensive in its ability to account for the primary channels of 
6:122:8189:27:28:72:114:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:growth.  
6:123:8197:28:28:108:543:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The first use of the model by Glaeser and Tobio (GT) (2008) was their examination of the 
6:124:8284:28:27:72:529:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:sources of growth in the southern region of the United States over the last half of the twentieth 
6:125:8382:27:28:72:536:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:century. A notable finding of the study was that rather than increased demand by households for 
6:126:8478:28:27:72:514:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:natural amenities, such as a favorable climate, the most important growth factor in the most 
6:127:8571:27:28:72:515:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:recent decades was a more favorable housing regulatory environment in southern states that 
6:128:8662:28:28:72:244:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:made housing supply more elastic.  
6:129:8696:28:27:108:508:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Rickman and Rickman (2011) used the model of GT to assess the changing role of 
6:130:8774:27:28:72:535:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:natural amenity demand in nonmetropolitan county growth for 1990-2000, while accounting for 
6:131:8864:28:27:72:523:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the elasticity of housing supply and labor demand. They found household amenity demand as 
6:132:8954:27:28:72:541:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:underlying stronger population growth in areas with higher levels of natural amenities. However, 
6:133:9050:28:28:72:536:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:they found amenities becoming fully capitalized in housing prices in the most amenity attractive 
6:134:9147:28:27:72:540:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:areas, which reduced their relative population growth. But they did not find housing supply to be 
6:135:9243:27:28:72:213:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:more inelastic in these areas. 
6:136:9273:28:27:108:522:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Rickman and Wang (2015) found that both differences in natural amenities and urban 
6:137:9356:27:28:72:540:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:agglomeration underpinned U.S. regional growth differences post-2000. In contrast to the 1990s, 
6:138:9451:28:28:72:524:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Rickman and Wang found more inelastic housing supply in the highest natural amenity areas, 
6:139:9542:28:0:72:540:101:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:particularly in nonmetropolitan areas. Davidsson and Rickman (2011) used the GT framework to 
7:140:9633:0:28:72:526:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:examine population growth differences in micropolitan areas across the U.S. from 1990-2000. 
7:141:9724:28:28:72:512:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:They found significant Census Division effects, which they assessed as primarily driven by 
7:142:9814:28:27:72:524:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:productivity growth differences, followed by amenity demand, with innovations in household 
7:143:9904:27:28:72:246:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:housing supply the least important.  
7:144:9939:28:27:72:341:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:3. Deriving Innovations to Regional Housing Supply 
7:145:9988:27:28:72:532:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: The spatial equilibrium model of Glaeser and Tobio (GT) (2008) is used in this study to 
7:146:10076:28:28:72:537:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:derive expressions for innovations in regional land (housing) supply, in which we closely follow 
7:147:10172:28:27:72:540:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the presentations of the spatial equilibrium model by GT and Rickman and Rickman (2011). The 
7:148:10264:27:28:72:532:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:model contains two optimizing agents: the household and the firm. The household supplies one 
7:149:10356:28:27:72:525:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:unit of labor and is assumed completely mobile across regions. Subject to a budget constraint, 
7:150:10448:27:28:72:531:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the household consumes a composite traded good with a normalized price of unity and housing 
7:151:10536:28:28:72:523:405:12:g_d0_f10:12:Times New Roman:B:(퐻) with price Ph to maximize utility. Amenities (퐴ℎ) serve as a utility shifter across regions. 
7:152:10626:28:28:72:530:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Utility of the household is assumed to be represented by the Cobb-Douglas constant-returns-to-
7:153:10718:28:27:72:533:349:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:scale function, with housing expenditure share α, and is equalized across regions in equilibrium 
7:154:10813:27:28:72:494:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:because of perfect household mobility. Equalized indirect utility (V0) can be written as: 
7:155:10901:28:27:108:526:294:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: V0= αα(1-α)(1-α)AhwPh-α  .                                                                                                                                            (1) 
7:156:11069:27:28:108:503:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The firm produces a nationally-traded good, with normalized price equal to unity, 
7:157:11150:28:29:72:512:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:according to a constant-returns-to-scale Cobb-Douglas function using labor (푁), nationally 
7:158:11238:29:29:72:539:210:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:B:mobile capital (퐾), and locally fixed capital (푍), with input expenditure shares equal to β, γ, and 
7:159:11337:29:29:72:523:181:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(1- β-γ), respectively. In addition, site-specific characteristics cause productivity (퐴푓) to vary 
7:160:11433:29:28:72:477:152:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regionally. Profit maximization yields the following inverse labor demand function: 
7:161:11516:28:0:72:527:124:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:                  w = βγ(γ/(1- γ))Af1/(1-γ)N(β+γ-1)/(1-γ)Z(1-β-γ)/(1-γ)                                                                (2) 
8:162:11654:0:28:108:528:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Equation (2) stands in contrast to the formulation in the canonical Rosen-Roback static 
8:163:11740:28:28:72:510:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:spatial equilibrium model. First, land is not used in production of the traded good. So, only 
8:164:11833:28:27:72:520:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:households are affected by land prices. Second, profits are not constrained to be equal across 
8:165:11928:27:28:72:540:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regions. As such, spatial differences in productivity do not directly affect land prices, which they 
8:166:12027:28:28:72:305:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:do in the traditional spatial equilibrium model.1  
8:167:12076:28:29:108:528:570:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The supply of housing is given by the fixed level of land (퐿) and housing structure (ℎ) 
8:168:12162:29:27:72:520:541:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:on the land. The cost per unit of land is 푃푙; the cost of housing structure is ξ0ℎ훿 where ξ0 is a 
8:169:12257:27:28:72:518:514:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:constant and δ>1. Housing supply is then directly affected by land supply and the amount of 
8:170:12348:28:28:72:509:486:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:housing structure per unit of land. Free entry and zero economic profits are assumed in the 
8:171:12440:28:27:72:526:458:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:housing sector in equilibrium. Using the first-order profit maximizing level of h, total housing 
8:172:12537:27:28:72:496:431:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:supply is given as: hL=(ph/ξ0δ)(1/(δ-1)). Equating housing demand with housing supply in 
8:173:12626:28:27:72:436:403:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:equilibrium yields the following equilibrium expression for housing prices: 
8:174:12701:27:28:72:546:376:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:                                ph=((N/L)αw)((δ-1)/ δ )δ(1/δ)ξ0(1/δ)  .                                                            (3)          
8:175:12844:28:28:72:536:348:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The housing market equilibrium condition is required because of the absence of land as an input 
8:176:12940:28:27:72:355:320:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:into production and the absence of a firm profit constraint.

8:184:13427:8:17:72:520:102:6:g_d0_f6:10:Times New Roman:F:1 In the traditional static spatial equilibrium model, with land transferable between residential and firm uses, the 
8:185:13543:17:11:72:534:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:assumptions of equalization of utility and profits across space are sufficient to derive equilibrium wages, land rents 
8:186:13662:11:0:72:136:74:10:Times New Roman:10:g_d0_f6:F:and population. 
9:187:13678:0:28:72:522:708:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f10:B:where 퐾푁, 퐾푤 and 퐾퐻 are constant terms derived from the solutions and 훥=훿(1−훽−훾)+

9:189:13764:28:27:108:512:652:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Equations (4)-(6) can be used to assess the influence of housing supply elasticity on 
9:190:13850:27:28:72:518:625:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regional outcomes by estimating regressions for the three variables, and include measures of 
9:191:13943:28:27:72:499:597:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:labor demand and supply innovations that are interacted with proxies for housing supply 
9:192:14031:27:28:72:517:570:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:elasticity (Glaeser et al., 2006). Labor demand and supply innovations will increase housing 
9:193:14124:28:28:72:517:542:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:prices more relative to population in areas with less elastic housing supply. Other sources of 
9:194:14218:28:27:72:538:514:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:growth can come from increased household amenity attractiveness through life cycle factors and 
9:195:14313:27:28:72:383:487:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:increased national income (Graves, 1979; Gyourko et al., 2013). 
9:196:14376:28:27:108:525:459:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:However, to derive corresponding spatial equilibrium growth equations, unanticipated 
9:197:14461:27:28:72:535:432:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:exogenous innovations to amenity demand (labor supply), firm productivity (labor demand) and 
9:198:14551:28:28:72:522:404:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:land supply are added to equations (4) to (6) (Rickman and Rickman, 2011). From the above, 
9:199:14639:28:27:72:538:376:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:exogenous changes in residential land supply then lead to exogenous changes in housing supply. 
9:200:14734:27:28:72:535:349:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Assuming that the static equilibrium conditions hold between periods t and t+1, equations (4) to 
9:201:14830:28:32:72:301:321:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(6) can be transformed into growth equations:

9:207:15222:28:0:72:457:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:common to all regions, while the ε represent innovations idiosyncratic to areas.  
10:208:15302:0:28:108:519:708:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Let 푩푵,푩푾 and 푩푯 represent the expressions multiplied by R in Equations (7) to (9), 
10:209:15381:28:28:72:533:680:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:respectively. The expressions associated with them can then be solved simultaneously to obtain 
10:210:15474:28:28:72:537:652:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the innovations in productivity, amenity attractiveness and land supply. It is possible that factors 
10:211:15574:28:27:72:499:624:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:such as the Hukou household registration system prevent Equations (4)-(6) from holding 
10:212:15660:27:28:72:520:597:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:precisely. However, to the extent such factors do not differentially change across regions (R) 
10:213:15755:28:27:72:537:569:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:over time, the interpretations of the expressions multiplied by R hold.2 We focus on deriving the 
10:214:15851:27:28:72:539:542:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:innovations to land (housing) supply.3Various policies are available and have been used to affect 
10:215:15949:28:28:72:422:514:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regional housing supply in China (Ye et al., 2011; He, 2013; Wu, 2015). 
10:216:16020:28:29:108:531:486:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Solving the three expressions for 푩푵,푩푾 and 푩푯 for relative growth in land supply (λL)

10:219:16247:28:27:72:521:402:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Strong population and wage growth relative to housing price growth is evidence of increased 
10:220:16338:27:28:72:504:375:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:elasticity of land (housing) supply. Lower growth in the supply of land (housing) restricts 
10:221:16426:28:28:72:393:347:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:population growth and increases housing prices relative to wages.  
10:222:16491:28:27:108:529:319:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:To estimate the impacts of the land supply innovations on housing prices we derive the

10:232:17266:11:7:72:444:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:incomplete interregional migration responses to household utility differentials (Clark, 2003). 
10:233:17360:7:16:72:534:90:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:3 Derivations of innovations to firm productivity and household amenity attractiveness can be found in Glaeser and 
10:234:17474:16:0:72:269:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:Tobio (2008) and Rickman and Rickman (2011). 
11:235:17520:0:28:108:538:709:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:A: According to the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China, China’s administrative 
11:236:17608:28:28:72:526:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:units are currently based on a three-tier system.4 The first tier includes provinces, autonomous 
11:237:17703:28:27:72:523:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regions and municipalities directly under central government control; the second tier includes 
11:238:17796:27:28:72:484:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:autonomous prefectures, autonomous counties and cities that comprise provinces and 
11:239:17879:28:27:72:539:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:autonomous regions; the third tier includes townships, ethnic minority townships, and towns that 
11:240:17975:27:28:72:540:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:comprise counties, autonomous counties and cities. In this paper, the analysis focuses on the first 
11:241:18073:28:28:72:539:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:tier that includes 23 provinces, 5 autonomous regions and 4 municipalities directly under control 
11:242:18171:28:27:72:537:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of the central government.5 Table 1 presents the areas of study, including their classification and 
11:243:18270:27:28:72:255:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:region of location in mainland China. 
11:244:18307:28:27:108:519:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The regional data we utilize in this paper are all publicly available. Data are obtained 
11:245:18396:27:28:72:525:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:from the National Bureau of Statistics of the People’s Republic of China for population, wage 
11:246:18489:28:28:72:534:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and salary income per capita, and the average regional housing price.6 We calculate the average 
11:247:18584:28:27:72:529:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:annual compounded growth rates for the variables over the period of 1999-2013. We begin the 
11:248:18674:27:28:72:475:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:analysis with 1999 because of the timing of market-based housing reforms in 1998. 
11:249:18755:28:27:72:529:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:  According to China Statistical Yearbooks, population in 1999 and 2013 were estimated 
11:250:18839:27:28:72:512:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:on the sample surveys on population changes that cover about one per thousand of the total 
11:251:18929:28:28:72:533:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:population of the country. The military personnel were not included in the regional population.

11:254:19202:28:27:72:513:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Data are obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics of the People’s Republic of China. 
11:255:19291:27:25:72:534:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Regarding wage and salary income per capita, we can only obtain data for urban and rural areas

11:258:19551:11:16:72:531:113:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:5 This paper focuses only on mainland China. Thus, the two special administrative regions Hong Kong and Macao

11:261:19785:16:0:72:443:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:Data are not available for all three variables at a finer geographical level across all of China. 
12:262:19884:0:28:72:528:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:separately. Thus, we use the urbanization ratio, calculated as urban population divided by total 
12:263:19980:28:28:72:539:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:population, to weight the urban and rural per capita incomes.7 For Tibet, because of missing data 
12:264:20076:28:27:72:412:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in 1999 we calculate the average annual growth rate from 2000-2013.

12:266:20187:28:27:72:529:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: Annual compounded growth rates for housing prices, per capita income and population 
12:267:20271:27:28:72:536:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:by area of study for the post-market reform period of 1999 to 2013 appear in Table 2. As shown 
12:268:20366:28:28:72:538:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in the first column of Table 2, housing prices increased the most in the East. The increases in the 
12:269:20466:28:27:72:511:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:East could have been affected by both housing demand and supply influences, which is the 
12:270:20555:27:28:72:483:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:subject of the analysis below. The four municipalities under the control of the central 
12:271:20643:28:27:72:532:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:government experienced the next fastest growth.  Note, for example, that Shanghai is classified 
12:272:20738:27:28:72:510:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:as both in the East and as a municipality. The Northeast provinces experienced the slowest 
12:273:20829:28:28:72:533:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:growth in housing prices. Strongest growth in per capita income occurred in the Central region, 
12:274:20924:28:27:72:517:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:followed closely by those in the East and Northwest regions. Municipalities experienced the 
12:275:21015:27:28:72:489:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:slowest growth in per capita income. Yet, municipalities also had the fastest growth in 
12:276:21103:28:27:72:475:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:population. Slowest growth in population occurred in the Northeast and Southwest.

13:294:22395:28:27:72:512:514:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: For Glaeser and Tobio (2008), in the base regressions R represented whether a U.S.

13:296:22568:28:27:72:534:459:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Rickman (2011), R corresponded to a vector of binary variables for the amenity ranking of U.S.

13:304:23094:28:27:72:541:238:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Table 3. The reported t-statistics reflect White heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors.9 The

13:306:23291:28:27:108:529:183:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:As shown in the first column of Table 3, the differences in housing price growth across 
13:307:23379:27:35:72:539:156:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regions of China are statistically significant below the 0.10 based on the F-test. Areas in the East

13:309:23537:7:17:72:531:114:6:g_d0_f6:10:Times New Roman:F:8 In addition to representing binary indicator variables as in the other studies, in Davidsson and Rickman (2011) R 
13:310:23651:17:12:72:526:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:also represented time varying variables. Such variables included industry composition and state and local tax and 
13:311:23764:12:7:72:164:85:10:Times New Roman:10:g_d0_f6:F:expenditure variables.  
13:312:23786:7:0:72:259:78:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:9 The regressions were estimated in EViews 7. 
14:313:23832:0:28:72:539:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:experienced over two percent greater annual compounded growth in housing prices than those in 
14:314:23926:28:28:72:504:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the Central region. Provinces in the Northeast experienced nearly two percent less annual 
14:315:24016:28:27:72:530:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:compounded growth. Autonomous provinces as a group, and municipalities as a group, did not 
14:316:24107:27:28:72:540:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:experience significantly different growth in housing prices relative to their respective geographic 
14:317:24206:28:27:72:113:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regions. 
14:318:24214:27:28:108:507:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The second column of Table 3 shows that collectively the areas did not experience 
14:319:24296:28:28:72:540:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:statistically different growth in per capita income relative to the Central region. Yet, provinces in 
14:320:24397:28:27:72:528:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the Northeast and municipalities under central government control experienced nearly two and 
14:321:24490:27:28:72:521:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:one-half percent slower per capita income growth. In results not shown, re-estimating the per 
14:322:24584:28:27:72:531:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:capita income growth equation after removing all variables other than the indictor variables for 
14:323:24681:27:28:72:536:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the Northeast and municipal areas produced a statistically significant regression (p=0.056), with 
14:324:24779:28:28:72:520:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:each coefficient approximately equal to negative two. This confirms the results for these two 
14:325:24873:28:27:72:343:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regions relative to Central provinces shown in the table. 
14:326:24929:27:28:108:509:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Regression results for population growth are shown in the third column of Table 3. 
14:327:25012:28:27:72:517:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Population growth has the most statistically significant regional pattern, as evidenced by the 
14:328:25105:27:28:72:522:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:highest r-squared and largest F-statistic. Only municipalities though had statistically different 
14:329:25203:28:28:72:501:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:population growth than Central provinces and their respective geographic regions, where 
14:330:25290:28:27:72:461:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:municipalities on average experienced over two percent greater growth per year. 
14:331:25369:27:28:72:229:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:5.2 Base Decomposition Results 
14:332:25398:28:29:108:531:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The coefficients from Table 3 are 푩푵,푩푾 and 푩푯 in Equation (10), which produces the 
14:333:25478:29:27:72:506:155:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:estimates of λL. The values for λL can then be used with Equation (11) to estimate the land 
14:334:25568:27:28:72:510:128:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(housing) supply effects on housing prices and population growth. Equations (10) and (11) 
14:335:25656:28:0:72:542:100:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:require parameters for the model. For the base case, the following values from Glaeser and Tobio 
15:336:25754:0:27:72:515:708:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(2008) are specified for the model parameters: β=0.3, γ=0.6, α=0.3 and δ alternatively is set 
15:337:25846:27:28:72:521:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:equal to 1.5 and 3.0 for translating land supply into housing supply. In sensitivity analysis, to 
15:338:25943:28:28:72:540:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:demonstrate that the results qualitatively hold up for alternative model parameter values, they are 
15:339:26043:28:28:72:248:625:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:set as follows β=0.6, γ=0.3, α=0.15. 
15:340:26079:28:27:108:495:597:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The first two columns of Table 4 show the differences in residential land supply 
15:341:26160:27:28:72:542:570:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:innovations (λL) relative to the omitted category, Central China, for δ=1.5 and δ=3.0, respectively. 
15:342:26259:28:28:72:526:542:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:A value of 1.5 implies an elasticity of price with respect to density of 0.5, while a value of 3.0 
15:343:26358:28:27:72:532:514:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:implies an elasticity of 3 (Glaeser and Tobio, 2008). In column (1), the Northeast provinces are 
15:344:26455:27:28:72:543:487:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:estimated to have had the most positive land supply innovations, followed next by the Northwest. 
15:345:26551:28:27:72:533:459:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The most negative land supply innovations are estimated to have occurred in the East, followed 
15:346:26645:27:28:72:534:432:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:by Municipalities (relative to their respective geographic regions) and the Southwest. As shown 
15:347:26741:28:28:72:540:404:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in column (2), specifying a larger elasticity of price to density instead predicts the Northwest and 
15:348:26842:28:27:72:517:376:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the North to have had the most elastic land supply. The most negative land (housing) supply 
15:349:26931:27:28:72:516:349:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:continues to be the East, followed next by the Southwest and then Municipalities. Note, that 
15:350:27023:28:27:72:518:321:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Shanghai, as a municipality under central government control and in the East region, has the 
15:351:27116:27:28:72:515:294:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:most negative land supply innovation in China. Overall, with the exception of the Northeast 
15:352:27206:28:28:72:520:266:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:region, the results are not much affected by varying the elasticity of housing price to density. 
15:353:27301:28:27:108:521:238:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The third and fifth columns reflect the results of using the estimated innovations with 
15:354:27389:27:28:72:505:211:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Equation (11) to predict the relative change in housing prices from the differences in land 
15:355:27481:28:27:72:547:183:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(housing) supply innovations. Positive (negative) predicted housing price increases in columns (3) 
15:356:27578:27:28:72:515:156:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and (5) reflect negative (positive) land (housing) supply innovations in columns (1) and (2), 
15:357:27671:28:28:72:533:128:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:respectively. The fourth and sixth columns are the ratios of the predicted housing price changes 
15:358:27767:28:0:72:520:100:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in columns (3) and (5) to the actual relative changes in housing prices given in column (1) of 
16:359:27862:0:28:72:525:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Table 3. The multipliers are the same across regions, so the pattern of differences in predicted 
16:360:27959:28:28:72:439:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:effects reflect that of the differences in innovations in the first two columns. 
16:361:28039:28:27:108:538:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:From the fourth column, regions with the largest positive innovations in the first column, 
16:362:28130:27:28:72:524:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the Northeast and Northwest, had thirty-seven percent and eighty-two percent of their relative 
16:363:28225:28:27:72:534:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:changes in housing prices explained by relative land supply innovations, respectively. The East, 
16:364:28322:27:28:72:530:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the region with the most negative land supply innovations in the first column, had seventy-five 
16:365:28417:28:28:72:524:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:percent of its relative increase in housing prices explained by its relative negative land supply 
16:366:28512:28:27:72:532:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:innovations. Thus, for the East and Northwest regions most of their relative changes in housing 
16:367:28607:27:28:72:538:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:prices are attributable to differential innovations in land supply, not fundamental demand factors 
16:368:28705:28:27:72:511:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:related to the attractiveness of the regions to firms and households. For the large municipal 
16:369:28798:27:28:72:530:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regions relative negative innovations in land supply can explain nearly all of the actual relative 
16:370:28896:28:28:72:196:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:change in housing prices. 
16:371:28921:28:27:108:527:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The Southwest, North and Autonomous regions had predicted changes in excess of the 
16:372:29004:27:28:72:515:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:actual changes. Thus, fundamental forces worked to dampen or offset the relative effects on 
16:373:29096:28:27:72:534:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:housing prices from land (housing) supply innovations. For the North provinces, housing prices 
16:374:29190:27:28:72:535:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:would have been lower had it not been for stronger relative fundamental demand forces. For the 
16:375:29285:28:28:72:521:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Autonomous provinces, negative effects from fundamental demand factors on housing prices 
16:376:29373:28:27:72:495:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:were in the opposite direction of the increased prices from negative relative land supply 
16:377:29461:27:28:72:516:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:innovations. In fact, the negative sign for Autonomous provinces indicate the actual relative 
16:378:29554:28:27:72:502:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:prices were negative, despite housing supply predicting there to be relative positive price 
16:379:29646:27:28:72:121:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:increases. 
16:380:29656:28:28:108:532:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The results in the sixth column, reflecting δ=3.0, are qualitatively similar to those in the 
16:381:29749:28:0:72:514:101:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:fourth column. The only switch in signs occurs for the Northeast provinces, in going from a 
17:382:29842:0:28:72:476:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:small positive number to barely negative as the weighted housing price growth now 
17:383:29923:28:28:72:514:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:approximately equals the sum of the change in the sum of income and population growth in 
17:384:30011:28:27:72:540:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Equation (10). This suggests that for this region, the significantly lower growth in housing prices 
17:385:30111:27:28:72:509:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(from column (1) of Table 3) results almost exclusively from relatively lower fundamental 
17:386:30200:28:27:72:116:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:demand. 
17:387:30207:27:28:108:527:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Negative housing supply innovations can feed speculative price bubbles (Rickman and 
17:388:30291:28:28:72:521:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Guettabi, 2015). Thus, the most negative exogenous land (housing) supply effects in the East 
17:389:30382:28:27:72:535:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(particularly Shanghai) is consistent with the evidence reported by Wang and Zhang (2014) that 
17:390:30477:27:28:72:512:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:housing prices were higher in several coastal cities than suggested by fundamentals such as 
17:391:30569:28:27:72:539:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:income and population. Yu (2011) similarly reports significant housing price bubbles since 2005 
17:392:30665:27:28:72:439:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in the eastern cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hangzhou and Ningbo. 
17:393:30739:28:28:108:515:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The predicted effects of the land (housing) supply innovations on population growth 
17:394:30822:28:27:72:530:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:using Equation (11b) are shown in Table 5. From Equation (11b), the multiplier effect of a one 
17:395:30916:27:28:72:537:350:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:B:unit change in land supply innovation on population growth is approximately 0.31 for δ=1.5 and 
17:396:31008:28:27:72:521:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:0.5 for δ=3.0. Thus, the predicted effects in Table 5 are approximately 0.31 and 0.5 times the 
17:397:31102:27:28:72:399:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:innovation values in the first two columns of Table 4, respectively.  
17:398:31169:28:28:108:531:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The results in Table 5 suggest that annualized population growth in the East region was 
17:399:31257:28:27:72:496:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reduced by as much as two percent by having more inelastic land (housing) supply. The 
17:400:31342:27:28:72:527:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Southwest and municipalities under central government control also grew significantly slower 
17:401:31435:28:27:72:510:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:because of inelastic land (housing) supply, while autonomous provinces grew only slightly 
17:402:31524:27:28:72:497:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:slower. Recall that for municipalities under central government control and autonomous 
17:403:31611:28:28:72:529:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:provinces, the coefficients are interpreted relative to the regions in which they are located. The 
17:404:31710:28:0:72:538:101:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:North and Northwest regions had significantly higher population growth because of more elastic 
18:405:31807:0:28:72:520:709:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:housing, in which the Northeast would only be predicted to have grown faster for δ=1.5. The 
18:406:31898:28:28:72:538:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:strong result for housing supply affecting population growth in the East region fit the time series 
18:407:31998:28:27:72:525:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:findings by Chen (2011) that housing investment Granger causes GDP in the East in the short 
18:408:32090:27:28:72:468:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:run and long run, whereas, a much weaker relationship was found for the West.     
18:409:32169:28:27:72:316:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:5.3 Sensitivity Analysis for Decomposition Results 
18:410:32218:27:28:108:504:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:In sensitivity analysis, Table 6 shows alternative decomposition results to those in 
18:411:32302:28:28:72:521:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:columns (3)-(6) in Table 4. The results are obtained by specifying different factor production 
18:412:32396:28:28:72:515:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:shares and household expenditure share on housing: α=0.15 and β=0.6, γ=0.3. These reflect 
18:413:32486:28:27:72:536:487:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:greater labor intensity (twice the labor factor share) in production in China (Marshall, 2011) and 
18:414:32582:27:28:72:504:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:a smaller Chinese expenditure share on housing (i.e., one-half the US share) (Lockett and 
18:415:32670:28:27:72:512:432:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Henderson, 2014; Stratford and Cowling, 2016). Estimated land supply innovations are not 
18:416:32759:27:28:72:517:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:affected by these changes (Equation (10)), so the first two columns of Table 4 (the predicted 
18:417:32853:28:28:72:373:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:innovations) do not change and are not reproduced in Table 5. 
18:418:32913:28:27:108:527:349:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:As shown in Table 6, the pattern of results across the regions holds when assuming the 
18:419:33000:27:28:72:538:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:alternative values of the model parameters. The signs do not switch because they are determined 
18:420:33095:28:27:72:537:294:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:by the estimated innovations. Thus, all the magnitudes are affected proportionately because only 
18:421:33192:27:28:72:517:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the multipliers change. The predicted effects on relative housing prices are about 0.65 of the 
18:422:33287:28:28:72:509:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Table 4 predicted effects for δ=1.5 and 0.53 of the predicted effects for δ=3.0. Overall, the 
18:423:33381:28:27:72:534:211:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:estimated roles of relative innovations in land supply are still quantitatively significant for most 
18:424:33481:27:28:72:513:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regions. A notable change though is that only about one-half, rather than the approximately 
18:425:33571:28:27:72:526:156:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:ninety percent in Table 4, of the change in relative housing prices in municipal regions is now 
18:426:33666:27:28:72:482:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:estimated to have occurred because of relatively negative innovations in land supply. 
18:427:33751:28:0:72:526:101:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Nevertheless, the predicted effects on population growth in Table 7 are only reduced by about 
19:428:33846:0:28:72:493:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:twelve percent from those in Table 5 because of the lower influence on the land supply-
19:429:33931:28:28:72:342:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:population growth multiplier of the parameter changes.  
19:430:33985:28:27:72:144:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:6. Conclusion 
19:431:33998:27:28:108:533:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:In this study, we apply a spatial equilibrium growth model (Glaeser and Tobio, 2008) to 
19:432:34084:28:27:72:539:598:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities under central government control in mainland 
19:433:34174:27:28:72:513:571:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:China from 1999-2013 to assess the role of differences in land (housing) supply in regional 
19:434:34264:28:28:72:540:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:differences in housing price and population growth. Innumerable factors can underlie differences 
19:435:34359:28:27:72:523:515:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in economic fundamentals and housing supply across regions, and the general structure of the 
19:436:34450:27:28:72:529:488:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:spatial equilibrium framework can account for them (Ottaviano and Pinelli, 2006; Tabuchi and 
19:437:34541:28:27:72:542:460:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Thisse, 2006). For example, the relaxing of Hukou restrictions would increase household demand 
19:438:34634:27:28:72:537:433:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:for cities with higher amenities, increasing their population growth and housing prices (Zheng et 
19:439:34730:28:28:72:535:405:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:al., 2014a). Promotion of housing supply such as through relaxing housing regulations or public 
19:440:34824:28:27:72:531:377:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:provision of housing (Cao and Keivani, 2014) would increase population growth relative to the 
19:441:34917:27:28:72:199:350:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:change in housing prices.  
19:442:34942:28:27:108:538:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:We first find that there were significant geographical differences in housing price growth 
19:443:35033:27:28:72:523:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:across mainland China during the post-market reform era. We find that relative differences in 
19:444:35127:28:28:72:521:267:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:land (housing) supply played major, if not dominant roles, in the differences in housing price 
19:445:35221:28:27:72:528:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:growth. This is a result that is robust to alternative parameterizations of the spatial equilibrium 
19:446:35321:27:28:72:522:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:model. We then find that the land (housing) supply differences significantly affected regional 
19:447:35414:28:27:72:169:184:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:population growth.  
19:448:35433:27:28:108:502:157:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:While the factors potentially underlying the land (housing) supply differences are 
19:449:35515:28:28:72:524:129:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:numerous and difficult to fully identify, the results from the spatial equilibrium growth model 
19:450:35611:28:0:72:531:101:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:highlight the important role of land (housing) supply in determining regional housing price and 
20:451:35706:0:28:72:526:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:population growth in mainland China. More research is needed on what specific policies most 
20:452:35797:28:28:72:471:681:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:increase regional housing supply and promote regional economic competitiveness.
