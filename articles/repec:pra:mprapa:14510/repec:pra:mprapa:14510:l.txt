2:20:761:17:13:91:526:597:121:Times:121:Times:A:The  paper  analyses  from  a  statistical  and  comparative  perspective  the  structural  determinants  of  
2:21:871:13:12:72:528:584:121:Times:121:Times:B:labour  productivity  (and  income)  and  the  dynamics  of  (non-monetary)  trade  competitiveness.  The  
2:22:978:12:13:72:529:572:121:Times:121:Times:B:research  focuses  on  developing  countries,  and  more  particularly  on  a  comparison  between  two  
2:23:1083:13:13:72:530:559:121:Times:121:Times:B:emblematic  regions:  Latin  America,  which  was  the  best  performer  during  the  first  phase  of  
2:24:1187:13:12:72:527:546:121:Times:121:Times:B:globalisation  (XIX  century  up  to  the  crisis  of  1929)  and  Asia,  which  came  to  stand  out  since  the  
2:25:1302:12:13:72:528:534:121:Times:121:Times:B:1960s,  first  with  Japan,  then  with  the  Newly  Industrialized  Economies  (NIE),  and  now  with  the  
2:26:1411:13:17:72:258:521:121:Times:121:Times:B:emergence of giants like China and India. 
2:27:1453:17:12:91:527:504:121:Times:121:Times:A:After  an  introduction  presenting  the  respective  regional  trends  in  labour  productivity,  the  paper  
2:28:1564:12:13:72:527:492:121:Times:121:Times:B:analyses  these  trends  following  a  growth  accounting  protocol,  applied  to  a  selection  of  Asian  and  
2:29:1677:13:12:72:526:479:121:Times:121:Times:B:Latin American countries. The empirical model refers itself to a structuralist theoretical référent. The 
2:30:1782:12:13:72:527:467:121:Times:121:Times:B:results  obtained  offer  a  disaggregated  estimate  of  the  respective  structural  sources  of  the  changes  in  
2:31:1900:13:13:72:526:454:121:Times:121:Times:B:total labour productivity observed in both regions. The paper documents the divergences in structural 
2:32:2002:13:12:72:527:441:121:Times:121:Times:B:transition paths, Asia showing complementarities in the development of its productive sectors, while 
2:33:2103:12:13:72:526:429:121:Times:121:Times:B:in Latin America the transition towards a fully industrialised economy has been truncated, and a new 
2:34:2204:13:13:72:527:416:121:Times:121:Times:B:dualism  emerged.  Because  non-monetary  (or  "real")  competitiveness  is  closely  related  with  labour  
2:35:2313:13:12:72:527:403:121:Times:121:Times:B:productivity,  the  comparative  dynamic  analysis  provides  interesting  indicators  on  the  evolution  of  
2:36:2424:12:13:72:529:391:121:Times:121:Times:B:comparative  advantages.  It  provides  also  a  new  approach  on  the  origins  of  the  Latin  American  
2:37:2532:13:17:72:445:378:121:Times:121:Times:B:phenomenon of growing informality, a preoccupying source of income inequalities.  
2:38:2614:17:12:91:526:361:121:Times:121:Times:A:In the third section, macroeconomic aspects are introduced in order to provide an explanation for 
2:39:2712:12:13:71:528:349:121:Times:121:Times:B:the  divergence  in  structural  paths  observed  when  comparing  Asia  with  Latin  America.  The  paper  
2:40:2820:13:13:71:527:336:121:Times:121:Times:B:argues  that  the  phenomenon  of  truncated  industrialisation  and  substitutive  informal  services  in  Latin  
2:41:2935:13:12:71:526:323:121:Times:121:Times:B:America may have some of its proximate roots in monetary and balance of payments considerations. 
2:42:3032:12:13:71:526:311:121:Times:121:Times:B:After revising some policy options that could be derived from the analysis, a conclusion sums-up the 
2:43:3133:13:17:71:130:298:121:Times:121:Times:B:main results. 
2:44:3147:17:16:91:94:281:121:Times:121:Times:A: 
2:45:3147:16:17:91:256:265:121:Times:121:Times:A: 1. Trade, productivity and income 
2:46:3181:17:17:91:94:248:121:Times:121:Times:A: 
2:47:3181:17:12:91:526:231:121:Times:121:Times:A:Trade liberalisation was meant to be a win-win strategy, where all participants were expected to 
2:48:3278:12:13:72:527:219:121:Times:121:Times:B:gain  from  the  increased  economic  exchanges.  Indeed,  there  is  little  doubt  that  free  trade  is  welfare  
2:49:3395:13:13:72:529:206:121:Times:121:Times:B:enhancing  in  absolute  term  at  global  level.  Thanks  in  particular  to  the  high  export-led  growth  
2:50:3505:13:12:71:530:193:121:Times:121:Times:B:experienced   by   those   developing   countries   that   were   willing   and   able   to   seize   their   global   
2:51:3624:12:13:71:528:181:121:Times:121:Times:B:opportunities,  the  world  has  recorded  a  considerable  decrease  in  the  number  of  people  living  in  
2:52:3735:13:12:71:527:168:121:Times:121:Times:B:poverty.  In  Eastern  Asia,  the  percentage  of  population  below  $1  purchasing  power  parity  dropped  
2:53:3845:12:13:71:526:156:121:Times:121:Times:B:from  33.0%  in  1990  to  9.9%  in  2004,  weighting  heavily  in  the  total  decline  from  31.6%  to  19.2%,  
2:54:3959:13:13:71:529:143:121:Times:121:Times:B:respectively,  observed  for  the  total  of  developing  countries  (United  Nations,  2007).  The  related  
2:55:4069:13:33:71:446:130:121:Times:121:Times:B:figures for Latin America and the Caribbean are 10.3% for 1990, and 8.7% in 2004.  
2:56:4152:33:7:71:219:97:121:Times:121:Times:B:                                                      
2:57:4205:7:16:108:526:90:42:Times:100:Times:F:1 The views expressed in this document, which has not been submitted to formal editing, are those of

3:59:4414:0:12:91:528:759:121:Times:121:Times:A:Yet,  distributional  considerations  request  to  somewhat  moderate  this  positive  conclusion.  In  
3:60:4518:12:13:71:525:747:121:Times:121:Times:B:actual facts, the variance of the distribution of benefits between and within countries has been so large 
3:61:4624:13:13:71:528:734:121:Times:121:Times:B:that  income  inequality  has  increased.  As  it  became  clear  that  there  was  a  "winner  group"  among  
3:62:4735:13:12:71:527:721:121:Times:121:Times:B:developing  and  transition  economies,  in  terms  of  both  income  growth  and  market  shares  (v.g.  the  
3:63:4846:12:13:71:526:709:121:Times:121:Times:B:emerging Asian countries; Eastern and Central Europe). It became also tempting to define the not-so 
3:64:4946:13:13:71:526:696:121:Times:121:Times:B:successful  as "losers", even if only in relative term compared to the more successful; and it was easy 
3:65:5050:13:16:71:304:683:121:Times:121:Times:B:to blame increased trade openness for this outcome.  
3:66:5103:16:13:91:528:667:121:Times:121:Times:A:Table  1  shows  that  growth  patterns  in  labour  productivity  –a  proxy  for  per  capita  income–  
3:67:5208:13:12:72:527:654:121:Times:121:Times:B:differed  considerably  across  regions,  stagnating  in  the  Middle  East  and  growing  more  than  3%  per  
3:68:5320:12:13:72:527:642:121:Times:121:Times:B:year  in  Asia.    The  higher  growth  is  shared  by  most  developing  Asia,  as  evidenced  by  the  low  and  
3:69:5435:13:13:72:529:629:121:Times:121:Times:B:decreasing  coefficient  of  variation  (even  lower  now,  than  the  homogeneous  group  of  Western  
3:70:5539:13:12:72:526:616:121:Times:121:Times:B:European economies).   This group of countries is not only closing the productivity gap with the most 
3:71:5641:12:17:72:439:604:121:Times:121:Times:B:advanced countries, but also show evidences of within-group income convergence.

4:124:7956:0:12:91:527:759:121:Times:121:Times:A:From  an  international  trade  perspective,  because  non-monetary  international  competitiveness  is  
4:125:8061:12:13:72:526:747:121:Times:121:Times:B:closely related to comparative labour productivity, understanding the dynamics of productivity puts an 
4:126:8164:13:13:72:526:734:121:Times:121:Times:B:interesting light on the evolution of comparative advantages in international trade. In this comparative 
4:127:8269:13:12:72:528:721:121:Times:121:Times:B:framework,  real  competitiveness  relates  to  labour  productivity  compared  to  a  benchmark  (usually  
4:128:8377:12:13:72:528:709:121:Times:121:Times:B:given  by  the  USA  or  other  mature  industrialized  economy).  But  understanding  the  reasons  of  the  
4:129:8487:13:13:72:527:696:121:Times:121:Times:B:apparently  increasing  gaps  between  the  so-called  "winners"  and  "losers"  of  globalisation  is  not  an  
4:130:8600:13:16:72:120:683:121:Times:121:Times:B:easy task.  
4:131:8612:16:13:91:529:667:121:Times:121:Times:A:Globalisation  unleashed  a  completely  new  set  of  business  practices,  and  coincided  with  the  
4:132:8716:13:12:72:527:654:121:Times:121:Times:B:Information Technology (IT) revolution. These two phenomena are intricately mixed; this makes the 
4:133:8814:12:13:72:527:642:121:Times:121:Times:B:relationship  between  the  dynamics  of  globalisation,  comparative  advantages,  international  trade  and  
4:134:8925:13:13:72:529:629:121:Times:121:Times:B:external  imbalances  a  very  complex  issue  which  encompasses  many  technical,  managerial  and  
4:135:9027:13:12:72:527:616:121:Times:121:Times:B:institutional issues. This fast evolving branch of economics is producing a series of new "new" trade 
4:136:9129:12:17:72:484:604:121:Times:121:Times:B:theories to capture the complexity of the micro-macro relationships created by globalisation.  
4:137:9224:17:13:91:527:587:121:Times:121:Times:A:As  trade  in  semi-finished  products  and  intra-firm  transactions  tends  to  dominate  trade  in  some  
4:138:9333:13:12:71:526:574:121:Times:121:Times:B:leading manufacture sectors such as electronics or automobiles, "trade in tasks" theory is increasingly 
4:139:9437:12:13:71:523:562:121:Times:121:Times:B:eating  into  the  more  traditional  analysis  of  comparative  advantages.  The  argument  of  the  new-
4:140:9543:13:13:71:526:549:121:Times:121:Times:B:paradigm trade theory is that international competition takes place also at the level of individual tasks 
4:141:9649:13:12:71:527:536:121:Times:121:Times:B:performed  by  internationally  integrated  firms.  International  competition  is  not  only  between  firms  
4:142:9760:12:13:71:527:524:121:Times:121:Times:B:producing  substitutable  goods,  but  also  between  workers  performing  similar  tasks.  Since  some  tasks  
4:143:9872:13:13:71:527:511:121:Times:121:Times:B:can  be  off-shored  more  easily  than  others,  the  identification  of  winners  and  losers  at  workers  level  
4:144:9989:13:16:71:179:498:121:Times:121:Times:B:becomes more difficult. 
4:145:10013:16:13:91:526:482:121:Times:121:Times:A:The existence and evolution of a trade-induced income gap is itself an empirical debate (Winters 
4:146:10110:13:13:71:526:469:121:Times:121:Times:B:et al, 2007). Reviewing a large amount of evidence from several developing countries regarding their 
4:147:10211:13:12:71:526:456:121:Times:121:Times:B:exposure to globalization and the parallel evolution of inequality, Goldberg and Pavcnik (2006) find 
4:148:10312:12:13:71:526:444:121:Times:121:Times:B:for example that the effect of globalization on inequality depends on many factors, several of which 
4:149:10413:13:17:71:209:431:121:Times:121:Times:B:are country- and time-specific.

5:166:10915:0:12:91:528:759:121:Times:121:Times:A:Globalisation  and  IT  may  have  shaken  the  old  beliefs,  rooted  in  the  Solow  model,  that  rich  
5:167:11022:12:13:72:528:747:121:Times:121:Times:B:countries  will  be  exporting  capital  to  the  developing  world,  allowing  labour  productivity  to  grow  
5:168:11134:13:13:72:527:734:121:Times:121:Times:B:faster  in  these  economies  and  close  the  income  gap.  Mirroring  this  prediction,  the  emerging  Asian  
5:169:11247:13:12:72:527:721:121:Times:121:Times:B:countries are registering a steady growth in their labour productivity, and receive an increasing share 
5:170:11351:12:13:72:528:709:121:Times:121:Times:B:of  foreign  investment.  Yet,  after  a  period  of  slow  growth,  where  its  leadership  over  European  
5:171:11460:13:13:72:528:696:121:Times:121:Times:B:economies  was  eroded,  the  US  is  also  registering  a  boom  in  its  labour  productivity  (the  so-called  
5:172:11574:13:12:72:526:683:121:Times:121:Times:B:"New Economy" factor). In the same time, the US economy is showing  a wide and persistent current 
5:173:11672:12:17:72:348:671:121:Times:121:Times:B:account deficit, attracting the savings of the rest of the world.  
5:174:11739:17:12:91:523:654:121:Times:121:Times:A:Despite the renewed dynamism of US productivity, the Asian economies are closing the labour-
5:175:11831:12:13:72:527:642:121:Times:121:Times:B:productivity  gap  (figure  1).  But  closing  the  gap  with  the  leading  economies  is  not  a  monotonous  
5:176:11943:13:13:72:527:629:121:Times:121:Times:B:process,  from  an  historical  perspective,  as  evidenced  by  the  diverging  trend  experienced  by  Latin  
5:177:12055:13:12:71:527:616:121:Times:121:Times:B:America.  Because  the  productivity  frontier  is  a  moving  target,  each  country's  relative  position  may  
5:178:12169:12:13:71:527:604:121:Times:121:Times:B:improve  or  deteriorate.  Trade  openness  may  probably  play  a  strong  positive  role,  as  exemplified  by  
5:179:12283:13:13:71:525:591:121:Times:121:Times:B:the accelerating trend observed in China after joining the WTO. But opening the economies it is not a 
5:180:12385:13:12:71:526:578:121:Times:121:Times:B:sufficient factor, and if Latin America could stop for a while the decreasing trend after the structural 
5:181:12490:12:17:71:270:566:121:Times:121:Times:B:reforms of the 1990s, it could not reverse it.  
5:182:12538:17:13:91:526:549:121:Times:121:Times:A:As figure 2 suggests, this is perhaps simply the reflect of convergence. At the end of the 1960s, 
5:183:12636:13:12:72:525:536:121:Times:121:Times:B:Asian countries were poorer or least advanced in terms of value added per worker than Latin America, 
5:184:12737:12:13:72:526:524:121:Times:121:Times:B:and may have registered a faster growth of productivity in a typical process of catching-up. But this is 
5:185:12842:13:13:72:528:511:121:Times:121:Times:B:just  a  possibility  and  even  if  convergence  is  at  work,  it  explains  only  part  (34%)  of  the  variance  
5:186:12959:13:12:72:526:498:121:Times:121:Times:B:observed in the graph. Indeed, this convergence effects vanishes when the same simple regression is 
5:187:13059:12:13:72:528:486:121:Times:121:Times:B:applied  to  a  wider  sample  of  developed  and  developing  countries.  Evidently,  the  dynamic  of  the  
5:188:13169:13:13:72:528:473:121:Times:121:Times:B:productivity  gap  is  the  resultant  of  a  process  which  is  much  more  complex  than  the  "simple"  or  
5:189:13281:13:16:72:361:460:121:Times:121:Times:B:"conditional" convergence that was predicted by Solow's model.

6:233:14284:12:13:72:528:697:121:Times:121:Times:B:growth  studies,  starting  with  "founding  fathers"  of  the  profession  such  as  A.  Smith  or  D.  Ricardo.  
6:234:14399:13:13:72:527:684:121:Times:121:Times:B:When  it  comes  to  modern  development  economics,  the  obvious  conceptual  reference  is  the  model  
6:235:14506:13:16:72:197:671:121:Times:121:Times:B:devised by Lewis (1954). 2  
6:236:14534:16:13:91:526:655:121:Times:121:Times:A:Arthur Lewis model of a closed economy with unlimited supplies of labour analyses the mutation 
6:237:14629:13:12:72:529:642:121:Times:121:Times:B:of  an  homogeneous  traditional  society,  where  subsistence  activities  predominate,  into  a  modern  
6:238:14736:12:13:72:528:630:121:Times:121:Times:B:"industrialised"  economy.  Labour  is  abundant,  and  its  productivity  is  much  higher  in  the  modern  
6:239:14846:13:13:72:528:617:121:Times:121:Times:B:sector.  As  long  as  the  two  sectors  coexists,  the  dynamic  of  productivity  cannot  be  captured  by  an  
6:240:14961:13:12:72:527:604:121:Times:121:Times:B:aggregate  production  model  "à  la  Solow"  (Ros,  2000).  During  the  labour  surplus  phase,  the  capital  
6:241:15074:12:13:72:527:592:121:Times:121:Times:B:intensity  of  the  whole  economy  rises,  and  with  it  the  per  capita  income.  But  at  the  difference  of  the  
6:242:15195:13:13:72:527:579:121:Times:121:Times:B:Solow model, this rise is predominantly due to the reallocation effect of labour from the subsistence 
6:243:15297:13:12:72:528:566:121:Times:121:Times:B:economy  to  the  capital  intensive  sector,  and  can  occur  even  if  there  is  no  gain  in  "productivity  
6:244:15411:12:17:72:111:554:121:Times:121:Times:B:proper". 
6:245:15420:17:13:91:527:537:121:Times:121:Times:A:The  conceptual  framework  used  here  is  also  closely  related  with  the  analytical  works  on  labour  
6:246:15530:13:12:72:526:524:121:Times:121:Times:B:policies in dualistic markets that derived from the well known Harris-Todaro (1970) model (see Fields

6:255:16110:12:13:72:526:395:121:Times:121:Times:B:to aggregate labour productivity. The presentation will follow as far as possible the growth accounting 
6:256:16214:13:13:72:528:382:121:Times:121:Times:B:notation  used  by  Van  Ark  and  Timmer  (2003),  to  facilitate  cross-references  with  the  Groningen  
6:257:16322:13:12:72:527:369:121:Times:121:Times:B:Growth  and  Development  Centre,  which  provides  a  world  wide  data  base  and  research  papers  on  
6:258:16429:12:17:72:134:357:121:Times:121:Times:B:productivity.  
6:259:16444:17:13:91:526:340:121:Times:121:Times:A:Because of the lack of systematic and detailed information on sectoral capital stock in developing 
6:260:16543:13:12:71:528:327:121:Times:121:Times:B:economies,  the  analysis  will  focus  on  labour  productivity.  It  should  be  noted,  nevertheless,  that  
6:261:16655:12:13:71:527:315:121:Times:121:Times:B:leaving out the investment side does not incur in a large loss of relevant information for our present 
6:262:16758:13:13:71:528:302:121:Times:121:Times:B:purpose.  Indeed,  previous  studies  indicate  that  the  effect  of  capital  reallocation  is  very  reduced  
6:263:16871:13:12:71:527:289:121:Times:121:Times:B:(Poirson,  2000).  This  tends  to  confirm  the  intuitive  perception  that  capital  markets  (with  the  notable  
6:264:16989:12:13:71:526:277:121:Times:121:Times:B:exception of agricultural land, but it is not an flexible asset) are less segmented than labour markets in 
6:265:17096:13:17:71:169:264:121:Times:121:Times:B:developing countries. 
6:266:17118:17:12:91:527:247:121:Times:121:Times:A:The  intuition  behind  the  method  is  simple:  when  sectors  of  very  different  labour  productivity  
6:267:17226:12:13:72:527:235:121:Times:121:Times:B:coexist  in  a  single  economy,  total  factor  productivity  shall  improve  when  labour  migrates  to  the  
6:268:17338:13:13:72:528:222:121:Times:121:Times:B:higher  productive  sectors,  even  in  the  absence  of  additional  technical  progress.  This  structuralist  
6:269:17451:13:12:72:527:209:121:Times:121:Times:B:approach  differs  from  the  neo-classic  "Solow"  models  that  assume  that  sectors  are  not  differentiated  
6:270:17566:12:42:72:318:197:121:Times:121:Times:B:and can be represented by a single production function. 
6:271:17622:42:8:71:219:155:121:Times:121:Times:B:                                                      
6:272:17675:8:16:108:525:147:42:Times:100:Times:F:2 See Syrquin (1988) for an overview of the role of structural changes in development economics, and 
6:273:17776:16:7:72:285:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:Ranis (2003) for an update on the theoretical debate. 
6:274:17830:7:16:108:526:124:42:Times:100:Times:F:3  In  particular,  rural  development  is  the  first-best  policy  in  the  context  of  the  Harris-Todaro  models,  
6:275:17950:16:11:72:530:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:because   an   emphasis   on   modern-sector   urban   employment   may   create   more   income   inequality   and   
6:276:18068:11:12:72:527:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:underemployment.  Some  income  restraints  in  the  urban  sector  are  also  considered  as  a  welfare  enhancing  
6:277:18186:12:11:72:527:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:option. The "structuralist" school of development, at the contrary, privileged higher growth rates based on fast 
6:278:18299:11:0:72:212:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:(and subsidised) industrialization.  
7:279:18337:0:12:91:526:759:121:Times:121:Times:A:Starting from a Lewis model with two sectors, one "traditional" and one "modern" economy, and 
7:280:18431:12:13:72:526:747:121:Times:121:Times:B:using standard growth accounting relations, the aggregate labour productivity can be decomposed as 
7:281:18530:13:17:72:111:734:121:Times:121:Times:B:follows: 
7:282:18539:17:16:91:94:717:121:Times:121:Times:A:

7:284:18562:17:17:91:121:684:121:Times:121:Times:A:where 
7:285:18568:17:16:91:158:667:121:Times:121:Times:A:Y = total GDP 
7:286:18582:16:17:91:236:651:121:Times:121:Times:A:Yi = Value added in sector i=1,2

7:288:18615:16:13:91:529:618:121:Times:121:Times:A:L  being  the  total  labour  force  employed  in  the  economy,  we  can  write,  using  the  same  
7:289:18716:13:17:72:129:605:121:Times:121:Times:B:convention:

7:294:18917:16:17:91:217:522:121:Times:121:Times:A:which can be simplified as : 
7:295:18946:17:17:91:516:505:121:Times:121:Times:A:PT = P 1T  S 1T   + P 2T  S 2T          [4] 
7:296:18990:17:16:91:116:488:121:Times:121:Times:A:with: 
7:297:18996:16:17:91:366:472:121:Times:121:Times:A:P iT : Value added per employed worker in sector i=1,2 at t=T  
7:298:19059:17:17:91:368:455:121:Times:121:Times:A:S iT : Share of labour force employed in sector i (i=1,2) at t=T.

7:300:19125:16:13:91:528:422:121:Times:121:Times:A:At  the  initial  stage  described  by  Lewis  (1954),  most  labour  force  is  (under)employed  in  the  
7:301:19232:13:13:72:527:409:121:Times:121:Times:B:traditional  sector,  leading  to  very  low  per  capita  income  in  this  sector,  at,  or  close  to,  subsistence  
7:302:19352:13:16:72:500:396:121:Times:121:Times:B:level. Added value per worker in the modern sector is much higher than the subsistence income.

7:308:19507:16:13:91:529:297:121:Times:121:Times:A:When  a  developing  economy  transits  to  higher  level  of  industrialization  and  income,  labour  
7:309:19611:13:13:72:525:284:121:Times:121:Times:B:moves from sector 1 to sector 2. The large structural differences in labour productivity indicated in [6] 
7:310:19717:13:12:72:526:271:121:Times:121:Times:B:implies that the aggregate labour productivity may raise thanks to sectoral reallocation effects, even if 
7:311:19823:12:17:72:209:259:121:Times:121:Times:B:there is no technical progress.  
7:312:19856:17:13:91:529:242:121:Times:121:Times:A:The  two-sectors  framework  can  be  used  also  to  model  the  evolution  of  the  Gini  income  
7:313:19956:13:12:72:525:229:121:Times:121:Times:B:concentration coefficient (Escaith, 2006). As transition occurs, the Gini describes an inverted U curve 
7:314:20060:12:13:72:526:217:121:Times:121:Times:B:"à la Kuznets", being maximum when L1 = L2 = ½ for any given level of income differential between 
7:315:20158:13:17:71:146:204:121:Times:121:Times:B:sector 1 and 2.4  
7:316:20176:17:12:91:526:187:121:Times:121:Times:A:For growth accounting purposes, the two sector model can be easily generalised to n sectors. In a 
7:317:20274:12:13:72:525:175:121:Times:121:Times:B:multisectoral context, changes in labour productivity between two disconnected period of time (t = 0 ; 
7:318:20377:13:17:72:225:162:121:Times:121:Times:B:T) can be decomposed as follows: 
7:319:20410:17:13:91:94:145:121:Times:121:Times:A: 
7:320:20410:13:8:72:219:132:121:Times:121:Times:B:                                                      
7:321:20463:8:16:108:526:124:42:Times:100:Times:F:4 This result holds even when discarding the Solow hypothesis of factor remuneration at the marginal 
7:322:20564:16:11:72:526:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:productivity, as long as wages are in relation with sectoral added value (for example using a conceptual référent 
7:323:20677:11:12:72:523:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:based  on  reservation  or  efficiency  wages).  The  received  theory  of  urban-rural  migration,  based  on  the  Harris-
7:324:20801:12:11:72:523:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:Todaro   model,   is   also   based   on   the   assumption   that   formal   urban   wages   are   set   above   marginal-

8:351:21070:16:13:91:528:705:121:Times:121:Times:A:It  should  be  noted  that,  because  the  analysis  applies  to  discrete  changes  (and  not  to  marginal  
8:352:21181:13:12:72:526:692:121:Times:121:Times:B:continuous ones), various weighting sets of parameters can be used, and decomposition is not unique. 
8:353:21282:12:13:72:526:680:121:Times:121:Times:B:For practical and statistical reasons,5 we decided to use the arithmetic average of start and end points 
8:354:21387:13:17:71:417:667:121:Times:121:Times:B:[(Si0 + SiT)/2 and (Pi0 + PiT)/2] to weight the changes (PiT – Pi0 ) and (SiT – Si0 ). 
8:355:21474:17:12:91:526:650:121:Times:121:Times:A:From a statistical and growth accounting perspective, Maddison (1952) attributes to S. Fabricant 
8:356:21571:12:13:72:530:638:121:Times:121:Times:B:the   paternity   of   the   fundamental   formula   used   to   separate   the   rise   in   productivity   into   two   
8:357:21693:13:13:72:528:625:121:Times:121:Times:B:components:  the  change  in  productivity  in  each  sector  of  the  economy,  which  he  calls  the  rise  in  
8:358:21807:13:12:72:526:612:121:Times:121:Times:B:"productivity  proper"  and  the  changes  in  the  productive  structure.  The  first  sum  on  the  right  side  of  
8:359:21926:12:13:72:526:600:121:Times:121:Times:B:[7] represents changes in "productivity proper" observed for the n sectors. The second sum indicates 
8:360:22027:13:13:72:525:587:121:Times:121:Times:B:the reallocation effect of labour between sectors (when labour shifts from a low-productivity to a high 
8:361:22131:13:16:72:426:574:121:Times:121:Times:B:productivity sector, the net effect is positive on aggregate labour productivity).   
8:362:22216:16:13:91:527:558:121:Times:121:Times:A:We  can  expect  the  first  element  to  be  positive,  as  developing  countries  incorporate  more  and  
8:363:22324:13:13:71:526:545:121:Times:121:Times:B:more technical progress in their production process. The second term should also be positive as long 
8:364:22425:13:12:71:526:532:121:Times:121:Times:B:as  the  labour  markets  are  segmented  and  the  economy  transits  from  a  traditional  to  an  industrialized  
8:365:22542:12:13:71:526:520:121:Times:121:Times:B:state. In this case, one should expect workers to shifts to more productive employment opportunities. 
8:366:22644:13:13:71:530:507:121:Times:121:Times:B:This  is,  for  example,  one  of  the  force  behind  the  rapid  urbanization  observed  in  developing  
8:367:22751:13:12:71:530:494:121:Times:121:Times:B:economies.      The   difference   in   labour   productivity   and   expected   wages,   which   explains   the   
8:368:22866:12:17:71:413:482:121:Times:121:Times:B:urbanization process, is also the key factor behind the Harris-Todaro models. 
8:369:22944:17:13:91:526:465:121:Times:121:Times:A:When the economy reaches its steady state, labour markets are more homogeneous and structural 
8:370:23038:13:12:72:527:452:121:Times:121:Times:B:shifts  should  not  be  as  important  compared  with  the  transition  phase.  In  this  case,  marginal  sectoral  
8:371:23156:12:13:72:527:440:121:Times:121:Times:B:productivity  tends  to  be  the  same  across  sectors,  and  the  economy  starts  behaving  according  to  the  
8:372:23271:13:16:72:187:427:121:Times:121:Times:B:Solow aggregated model. 
8:373:23295:16:13:91:526:411:121:Times:121:Times:A:From a statistical standpoint, the decomposition formula [8] can be used on national account data 
8:374:23393:13:13:72:527:398:121:Times:121:Times:B:which  are  generally  available  at  constant  process  for  most  countries  in  the  world,  provided  that  the  
8:375:23510:13:12:72:527:385:121:Times:121:Times:B:corresponding  disaggregation  exists  for  labour  force  employed.  The  latter  is,  unfortunately,  quite  a  
8:376:23624:12:13:72:526:373:121:Times:121:Times:B:restricting factor. For many developing countries, comprehensive labour force estimates by sectors of

8:382:23900:17:17:127:242:280:121:g_d0_f13:121:Times:A:• Sources and coverage 
8:383:23922:17:12:91:526:263:121:Times:121:Times:A:Two different sources were used for the purpose of comparing the dynamic of productivity and its 
8:384:24019:12:17:72:325:251:121:Times:121:Times:B:sources, sectoral recomposition or "productivity proper": 
8:385:24077:17:13:91:526:234:121:Times:121:Times:A:      -      For      Asia, we use the results of Van Ark y Timmer (2003), from the Groningen Growth and 
8:386:24182:13:12:72:526:221:121:Times:121:Times:B:Development Centre. They were computed using a very similar formula for nine Asian economies, at 
8:387:24279:12:13:72:526:209:121:Times:121:Times:B:different stages of industrialization (Korea, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, 
8:388:24382:13:13:72:529:196:121:Times:121:Times:B:Thailand  y  Taiwan.)  The  authors  find  that  the  traditional  source  of  reallocating  resources  from  
8:389:24492:13:12:72:528:183:121:Times:121:Times:B:agriculture  to  industry  is  still  quite  powerful  for  South  Asian  and  South  East  Asian  developing  
8:390:24603:12:13:72:527:171:121:Times:121:Times:B:countries.  The  structural  factor  has  not  yet  disappeared  in  the  most  advanced  East  Asian  countries.  
8:391:24718:13:13:72:526:158:121:Times:121:Times:B:These  finding  can  be  completed  and  reinforced  with  the  results  of  a  recent  IMF  publication,  which  
8:392:24832:13:12:72:527:145:121:Times:121:Times:B:uses  similar  decomposition  approach  and  include  more  Asian  countries,  albeit  at  a  more  aggregated  
8:393:24944:12:24:72:526:133:121:Times:121:Times:B:sectoral level. The results show that sectoral shifts have been particularly important in explaining the 
8:394:25049:24:8:71:219:109:121:Times:121:Times:B:                                                      
8:395:25102:8:16:108:527:101:42:Times:100:Times:F:5  On  practical  aspects,  using  an  average  value  avoids  making  arbitrary  assumptions  on  the  choice  of  
8:396:25218:16:11:72:526:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:weighting parameters and bridges the gap with alternative dynamic shift-share models; more formally, is allows 
8:397:25329:11:0:72:252:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:for symmetry in the decomposition formula. 
9:398:25373:0:12:72:527:759:121:Times:121:Times:B:catching-up process. Within Asia, and especially in China, labour moved out of agriculture at a faster 
9:399:25476:12:13:72:528:747:121:Times:121:Times:B:rate.  Another  reason  explaining  the  strength  of  the  sectoral  reallocation  effect  is  that  the  initial  
9:400:25592:13:13:72:528:734:121:Times:121:Times:B:intersectoral  productivity  differentials  were  higher  in  Asia  than  in  other  developing  regions  (IMF,  
9:401:25705:13:16:72:103:721:121:Times:121:Times:B:2006). 
9:402:25712:16:13:91:526:705:121:Times:121:Times:A:      -      For      Latin America, we use the results of Escaith (2006). The decomposition [8] was used 
9:403:25818:13:13:71:526:692:121:Times:121:Times:B:on  a  set  of  nine  Latin  American  countries:  Argentina,  Bolivia,  Brazil,  Chile,  Colombia,  Costa  Rica,  
9:404:25933:13:12:71:529:679:121:Times:121:Times:B:Mexico,  Peru  and  Venezuela.  The  main  findings  of  the  reference  paper  are  that  inter-sectoral  
9:405:26040:12:13:71:525:667:121:Times:121:Times:B:reallocation of resources was also relevant in explaining total labour productivity. But the labour shift 
9:406:26146:13:12:71:527:654:121:Times:121:Times:B:was  not  predominantly  from  agriculture  to  industry,  but  from  agriculture  to  services.  Indeed,  while  
9:407:26260:12:13:71:528:642:121:Times:121:Times:B:industry  was  able  to  increase  its  "productivity  proper",  it  was  not  creating  enough  job  for  the  
9:408:26372:13:13:71:529:629:121:Times:121:Times:B:expanding  urban  population.  As  a  result,  the  share  on  labour  in  manufacture  decreased.  This  
9:409:26478:13:12:71:529:616:121:Times:121:Times:B:phenomenon  was  perceptible  since  the  1970s.  Because  the  jobs  created  in  services  were  of  
9:410:26581:12:13:71:526:604:121:Times:121:Times:B:diminishing productivity, the end result was a slower increase in total value added per worker. Once 
9:411:26682:13:13:71:528:591:121:Times:121:Times:B:again,  these  results  can  be  compared  with  the  findings  of  the  IMF  (2006),  with  Latin  America  
9:412:26791:13:12:71:526:578:121:Times:121:Times:B:registering lower share of manufacturing employment and lower share of manufacturing value-added 
9:413:26888:12:13:71:527:566:121:Times:121:Times:B:than  Asia.  Indeed,  according  to  this  publication,  "unlike  Asia,  Latin  America  experienced  a  decline  
9:414:27002:13:13:71:526:553:121:Times:121:Times:B:over time in manufacturing productivity related to the United States", while "by contrast [with Asia] 
9:415:27104:13:16:71:449:540:121:Times:121:Times:B:sectoral shifts were too weak to help promote convergence toward the United State".

9:417:27189:17:13:91:528:507:121:Times:121:Times:A:Albeit  using  different  approaches  in  the  normalization  of  national  account  data  and  adopting  
9:418:27295:13:12:72:526:494:121:Times:121:Times:B:slightly different version of the Fabricant Formula, the methodological approaches used in these two 
9:419:27396:12:13:72:527:482:121:Times:121:Times:B:sources  remain  sufficiently  similar  to  allow  for  a  direct  comparison  of  the  respective  dynamics  of  
9:420:27510:13:13:72:527:469:121:Times:121:Times:B:labour  productivity.6  The  period  covered  corresponds  to  the  1985-2001  period,  corresponding  to  the  
9:421:27622:13:16:71:409:456:121:Times:121:Times:B:years for which most data were available in Van Ark and Timmer (2003). 7  
9:422:27696:16:13:91:526:440:121:Times:121:Times:A:As always in descriptive statistics, the choice of the sample, in this case start and end years, may 
9:423:27797:13:13:72:529:427:121:Times:121:Times:B:influence  the  results.  The  period  1985-2001  corresponds  for  Latin  America  to  the  depth  of  two  
9:424:27906:13:12:72:528:414:121:Times:121:Times:B:economic  recessions,  the  first  one  being  harder  than  the  second.  In  that  sense,  it  makes  sense  to  
9:425:28021:12:13:72:526:402:121:Times:121:Times:B:compare them as they correspond to the same recessive phase of two successive economic cycles. As 
9:426:28119:13:12:72:526:389:121:Times:121:Times:B:far as Asia is concerned, 2001 was a year of stagnation in many countries, after the 1997-1998 crisis. 
9:427:28222:12:13:72:528:377:121:Times:121:Times:B:This  may  perhaps  introduce  a  negative  bias  in  the  Asian  indicators  (especially  for  the  financial

9:432:28377:16:13:91:528:297:121:Times:121:Times:A:Tables  3.a  and  3.b  show  the  results  obtained  from  the  two  references  studies,  using  the  nine  
9:433:28486:13:13:72:526:284:121:Times:121:Times:B:sectors of national accounts. The first fact that literally jump to the eyes is that very few numbers from 
9:434:28593:13:12:72:527:271:121:Times:121:Times:B:table  3.a  (Asia)  are  negative,  while  they  represent  more  than  40%  on  the  numbers  appearing  on  the  
9:435:28708:12:13:72:526:259:121:Times:121:Times:B:Latin  American  sheet.  As  a  matter  of  facts,  average  annual  productivity  growth  (a  close  indicator  of  
9:436:28825:13:13:72:528:246:121:Times:121:Times:B:real  wages  income)  has  been  negative  in  Bolivia,  Mexico,  Peru  and  Venezuela,  while  it  almost  
9:437:28933:13:16:72:416:233:121:Times:121:Times:B:stagnated in all other Latin American economies, with the exception of Chile. 
9:438:29011:16:13:91:528:217:121:Times:121:Times:A:Indeed,  with  a  3.6%  average  annual  increase  in  labour  productivity,  Chile  is  the  only  Latin  
9:439:29118:13:13:72:526:204:121:Times:121:Times:B:economy that approximates the Asian pattern of productivity growth.  If we exclude Japan, a mature

11:557:33563:17:16:91:390:260:121:Times:121:Times:A:From a comparative perspective, two major aspects merit attention: 
11:558:33630:16:17:91:94:244:121:Times:121:Times:A: 
11:559:33630:17:13:91:527:227:121:Times:121:Times:A: - First, the structural role of the industrial sector in "explaining" productivity growth in Asia, 
11:560:33729:13:12:72:527:214:121:Times:121:Times:B:based  on  advances  in  both  "productivity  proper"  and  "labour  shifts".  In  Latin  America,  it  proved  
11:561:33841:12:13:72:526:202:121:Times:121:Times:B:almost  impossible  for  the  manufacturing  sector  to  advance  simultaneously  in  both  productivity  and  
11:562:33952:13:13:72:526:189:121:Times:121:Times:B:labour share, Costa Rica being the exception. In general the two components of productivity growth 
11:563:34051:13:12:72:531:176:121:Times:121:Times:B:evidenced   opposite   signs,   and   were   sometime   negative   in   both   dimensions   (Colombia   and   
11:564:34161:12:17:72:129:164:121:Times:49:Times:B:Venezuela).8
11:565:34173:17:13:91:530:147:121:Times:121:Times:A:       -   Second,   the   service   sectors   in   Asia   did   not   experience   an   outstanding   growth   in   
11:566:34290:13:12:72:527:134:121:Times:121:Times:B:employment,  relative  to  other  sectors.  Parallel  to  job  creation  in  services,  added  value  per  employee  
11:567:34407:12:13:72:527:122:121:Times:121:Times:B:increased,  with  a  few  exceptions  (finance  in  Honk  Kong  and  Indonesia  being  the  most  notable,  and  
11:568:34520:13:8:71:219:109:121:Times:121:Times:B:                                                      
11:569:34573:8:16:108:527:101:42:Times:100:Times:F:8  Contrary  to  the  standard  Cobb-Douglas  function,  labour  inputs  can  increase  together  with  labour  
11:570:34685:16:11:72:527:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:productivity  as  a  result  of  intra-sector  shifts  from  low-productivity  firms  to  higher  ones,  scale  effects  due  to  
11:571:34815:11:0:72:277:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:increased market shares, or a combination of both. 
12:572:34868:0:12:72:527:759:121:Times:121:Times:B:related  probably  to  the  1997-1998  financial  crisis).  In  addition,  shifts  out  of  the  agricultural  sectors  
12:573:34988:12:13:72:530:747:121:Times:121:Times:B:were   moderate.   Thus,   Asian   countries   remain   basically   good-producing   economies,   with   an   
12:574:35098:13:13:72:528:734:121:Times:121:Times:B:continuing  shift  towards  industrialization.  On  the  contrary,  in  many  Latin  American  countries,  the  
12:575:35210:13:16:72:366:721:121:Times:121:Times:B:service sectors absorbed an increasing share of the working force.  
12:576:35278:16:13:91:527:705:121:Times:121:Times:A:It would be wrong to pretend that this occurs because Latin American countries represent a more 
12:577:35374:13:13:72:528:692:121:Times:121:Times:B:advanced  subset  of  economies,  that  are  transiting  towards  a  post-industrialised  "service  oriented"  
12:578:35485:13:12:72:528:679:121:Times:121:Times:B:society.  In  Latin  America,  the  jobs  offered  by  the  service  sectors  were  generally  of  low  and  
12:579:35594:12:13:72:527:667:121:Times:121:Times:B:decreasing  productivity.  This  denotes  a  dysfunctional  situation  where  the  highly  productive  sectors  
12:580:35706:13:12:72:527:654:121:Times:121:Times:B:are  not  able  to  create  new  jobs,  and  new  entrants  in  the  labour  market  have  to  settle  for  low-quality  
12:581:35827:12:13:72:527:642:121:Times:121:Times:B:jobs. These shortcomings were identified as the sources of the increasing wage gaps observed in the 
12:582:35927:13:17:72:446:629:121:Times:121:Times:B:1990s, and the reappearance of a large informal sector in this region (Escaith, 2006)  
12:583:36014:17:12:91:525:612:121:Times:121:Times:A:From a view point of systemic competitiveness and international trade, it would also be erroneous 
12:584:36112:12:13:72:526:600:121:Times:121:Times:B:to reduce the debate between two models, the outwards-oriented one stressing tradable goods in Asia 
12:585:36212:13:13:72:526:587:121:Times:121:Times:B:and the inwards-oriented post-industrialized Latin American case, with most jobs created in services. 
12:586:36314:13:12:72:527:574:121:Times:121:Times:B:As  in  the  business  management  distinction  between  back  office  and  front  office  functions  in  a  firm,  
12:587:36430:12:13:72:525:562:121:Times:121:Times:B:both being necessary to the firm competitiveness and efficiency, many services are complementary to 
12:588:36530:13:13:72:533:549:121:Times:121:Times:B:the    production    functions.    As    investment    in    infrastructure    (roads,    electricity    network)    is    
12:589:36653:13:12:72:527:536:121:Times:121:Times:B:complementary  to  production,  the  same  can  be  said  of  telecommunication  services  and  other  similar  
12:590:36765:12:13:72:527:524:121:Times:121:Times:B:activities.  The  systemic  competitiveness  of  the  economy  depends  not  only  on  its  exporting  industry,  
12:591:36879:13:17:72:437:511:121:Times:121:Times:B:but also on the quality of the "infrastructure" services provided to these industries. 
12:592:36966:17:17:91:94:494:121:Times:121:Times:A: 
12:593:36966:17:17:127:335:477:121:g_d0_f13:121:Times:A:• Tradable, infrastructure and other services. 
12:594:37012:17:12:91:529:460:121:Times:121:Times:A:Taking  into  consideration  the  above  mentioned  arguments,  the  initial  nine  National  Account  
12:595:37115:12:13:72:528:448:121:Times:121:Times:B:sectors  were  aggregated  into  three  categories:  tradable  goods  production,  "infrastructure"  services,  
12:596:37227:13:17:72:464:435:121:Times:121:Times:B:and the rest of sectors (representing basically public and private services to households). 
12:597:37319:17:12:91:529:418:121:Times:121:Times:A:Table  4  shows  a  summary  of  the  two  regions,  with  a  sectoral  aggregation  between  Good  
12:598:37419:12:13:72:526:406:121:Times:121:Times:B:production (Agriculture, Mining, Manufacture); Infrastructure services (Public Utilities, Construction 
12:599:37522:13:13:72:530:393:121:Times:121:Times:B:and  Transport  and  Communication)  and  the  other  non  specified  services.  The  classification  is  
12:600:37628:13:12:72:528:380:121:Times:121:Times:B:arbitrary,  as  it  is  usual.  For  example,  economic  theory  indicates  that  financial  services  are  key  to  
12:601:37745:12:13:72:526:368:121:Times:121:Times:B:enhance firms' productivity, especially by screening out investment projects. On the other hand, most 
12:602:37847:13:13:72:528:355:121:Times:121:Times:B:jobs  created  in  banking  were  to  serve  households,  which  justified  its  classification  in  the  third  
12:603:37960:13:16:72:115:342:121:Times:121:Times:B:category. 
12:604:37970:16:17:91:94:326:121:Times:121:Times:A: 
12:605:37970:17:12:91:528:309:121:Times:121:Times:A:The  summary  table  4  reveals  the  contrast  between  the  two  regions.  True  to  their  respective  
12:606:38076:12:13:72:527:297:121:Times:121:Times:B:cultural background, Asia is showing more harmony and equilibrium while Latin America stands for 
12:607:38173:13:13:72:526:284:121:Times:121:Times:B:the contrasts and oppositions. But the consequences of these contrasting results for Latin America are 
12:608:38276:13:12:72:527:271:121:Times:121:Times:B:preoccupying in terms of international competitiveness and population welfare. Once again, the poor 
12:609:38376:12:13:72:527:259:121:Times:121:Times:B:quality  of  the  Latin  American  jobs  created  in  other  services  is  appalling.  In  Asia,  these  services  are  
12:610:38496:13:13:72:526:246:121:Times:121:Times:B:also gaining importance in the labour market, but are doing so in line with the development of the rest 
12:611:38600:13:12:72:527:233:121:Times:121:Times:B:of the economies, and the job created are of good quality (productivity proper raises in these sectors,

13:630:39275:11:10:72:515:495:81:Times:81:Times:F:Notes: Accumulated variation refer to average across country, in 1990 USD. The respective contributions for each sectoral

13:633:39469:17:13:91:528:456:121:Times:121:Times:A:Information  gathered  from  secondary  data  sources  seems  to  validates  the  contrasting  sectoral  
13:634:39574:13:12:72:529:443:121:Times:121:Times:B:results  obtained  between  Asia  and  Latin  America.  For  example,  IMF(2006)  indicates  that  "the  
13:635:39679:12:13:72:526:431:121:Times:121:Times:B:movement of labor into the services sector was at least as large as that toward industry. Also [except 
13:636:39782:13:13:72:530:418:121:Times:121:Times:B:in  Japan  and  the  NIEs]  in  most  of  Asia  the  share  of  industry  in  total  employment  is  still  growing.    
13:637:39902:13:12:72:526:405:121:Times:121:Times:B:Unlike Asia, Latin America experienced a decline over time in manufacturing productivity relative to 
13:638:40003:12:17:72:165:393:121:Times:121:Times:B:the United States...". 
13:639:40026:17:13:91:527:376:121:Times:121:Times:A:Thus,  it  seems  safe  to  conclude  this  empirical  section  on  sectoral  decomposition  of  productivity  
13:640:40137:13:12:72:527:363:121:Times:121:Times:B:growth  by  stating  that  productivity  increase  in  Asia  is  based  on  a  virtuous  structural  transformation,  
13:641:40255:12:13:72:526:351:121:Times:121:Times:B:which in turn sets the grounds for a sustainable projection of the present trend. Obviously, one should 
13:642:40359:13:13:72:529:338:121:Times:121:Times:B:expect  the  contribution  of  structural  changes  to  total  labour  productivity  to  diminish  with  the  
13:643:40469:13:12:72:527:325:121:Times:121:Times:B:reduction  of  surplus  labour  from  agriculture,  but  for  the  time  being  the  transition  is  functioning.  It  
13:644:40588:12:13:72:523:313:121:Times:121:Times:B:means,  as  a  corollary,  that  Asia  should  keep  on  reducing  its  productivity  gap  and  increase  its  non-
13:645:40703:13:13:72:529:300:121:Times:121:Times:B:monetary  competitiveness  on  the  international  markets.  Latin  America,  on  the  contrary,  seems  
13:646:40808:13:12:72:527:287:121:Times:121:Times:B:engaged  in  a  perverse  transition  from  one  dualist  model,  where  subsistence  sector  is  located  in  the  
13:647:40924:12:13:72:527:275:121:Times:121:Times:B:tradition  rural  area,  to  a  new  dualist  society,  with  a  growing  urban  informal  sector  similar  to  the  
13:648:41041:13:16:72:364:262:121:Times:121:Times:B:"murky sector" analysed in Fields (1975) and larger income gaps. 
13:649:41106:16:13:91:527:246:121:Times:121:Times:A:Returning  to  our  conceptual  "référent",  the  sectoral  data  presented  in  this  section  tends  also  to  
13:650:41219:13:13:72:526:233:121:Times:121:Times:B:show that Asia is going through the transition from traditional to modern as expected from the Lewis 
13:651:41320:13:12:72:526:220:121:Times:121:Times:B:model,  while  the  Latin  American  case  indicate  a  trounced  transition.  The  external  sector  mimics  the  
13:652:41435:12:13:72:528:208:121:Times:121:Times:B:internal  situation:  because  differences  in  domestic  sectoral  productivity  (and  wages)  remain  large,  
13:653:41547:13:13:72:527:195:121:Times:121:Times:B:Latin  America  finds  difficult  to  close  the  systemic  productivity  gap  with  industrialised  economies,  
13:654:41660:13:16:72:292:182:121:Times:121:Times:B:and loses external competitiveness vis-à-vis Asia.

13:657:41795:17:16:91:94:132:121:Times:121:Times:A: 
13:658:41795:16:13:91:526:116:121:Times:121:Times:A:This part reinserts nominal and financial aspects into "real" structural analysis, to examines how a 
13:659:41896:13:13:72:529:103:121:Times:121:Times:B:broad  fall  in  trading  and  financial  transaction  costs  may  have  affected  the  key  determinants  of  
13:660:42007:13:12:72:527:90:121:Times:121:Times:B:structural  adjustment,  positively,  in  the  case  of  Asia,  and  negatively  in  Latin  America.  The  initial  
13:661:42123:12:0:72:526:78:121:Times:121:Times:B:Lewis model was of a closed economy, and the speed of the transition from traditional to modern was 
14:662:42225:0:12:72:526:759:121:Times:121:Times:B:constraint by internal investment and savings capacities. The liberalization of international goods and 
14:663:42329:12:13:71:527:747:121:Times:121:Times:B:financial  markets  was  supposed  to  reduce  these  internal  restrictions  by  opening  new  export  markets  
14:664:42442:13:13:71:528:734:121:Times:121:Times:B:for  the  national  products  and  facilitating  capital  accumulation  in  the  modern  sector  by  attracting  
14:665:42555:13:16:71:150:721:121:Times:121:Times:B:external savings.  
14:666:42574:16:13:91:527:705:121:Times:121:Times:A:The statistical evidence shows that globalisation was effective in opening both real and financial 
14:667:42673:13:13:72:527:692:121:Times:121:Times:B:markets. The development of international financial markets has been far more dynamic than that of 
14:668:42772:13:12:72:527:679:121:Times:121:Times:B:trade in goods and services. Nevertheless, international trade has been increasing much more rapidly 
14:669:42873:12:13:72:527:667:121:Times:121:Times:B:than  global  GDP,  and  one  of  the  most  important  feature  behind  this  process  has  been  the  growing  
14:670:42986:13:12:72:527:654:121:Times:121:Times:B:importance  of  emerging  market  economies  in  world  trade.    Our  results  show  that  Asia  was  able  to  
14:671:43099:12:17:72:494:642:121:Times:121:Times:B:thrive on this trend to foster domestic production and productivity, while Latin America failed.  
14:672:43197:17:13:91:529:625:121:Times:121:Times:A:One  plausible  interpretation  is  that,  in  Asia,  the  creation  of  new  jobs  in  the  service  sectors  
14:673:43308:13:12:72:527:612:121:Times:121:Times:B:responded  to  a  growing  effective  demand  for  this  type  of  activity.  As  this  supply  responded  to  an  
14:674:43423:12:13:72:528:600:121:Times:121:Times:B:actual  demand  (e.g.,  from  an  expanding  industrial  sector  in  need  of  business  services,  or  from  
14:675:43533:13:13:72:527:587:121:Times:121:Times:B:households with the raise of a middle class), additional value added was created in this process. This 
14:676:43636:13:12:72:526:574:121:Times:121:Times:B:means that sectoral and average labour productivity kept on increasing, and the higher salaries paid to 
14:677:43740:12:17:72:322:562:121:Times:121:Times:B:the service sector helped in turn sustaining the demand.  
14:678:43798:17:13:91:526:545:121:Times:121:Times:A:At the contrary, the Latin American data indicates a situation where industry faced difficulties to 
14:679:43898:13:12:71:526:532:121:Times:121:Times:B:increase  its  sales  on  the  international  market,  and  was  forced  instead  into  a  process  of  productivity  
14:680:44016:12:13:71:526:520:121:Times:121:Times:B:enhancing  investment  to  defend  its  market  shares.  9    As  a  consequence,  the  modern  manufacturing  
14:681:44127:13:13:72:527:507:121:Times:121:Times:B:sector has not been able to absorb the surplus labour force originating from the traditional sector, or 
14:682:44231:13:12:72:528:494:121:Times:121:Times:B:resulting  from  the  natural  increase  in  the  active  population.  In  absence  of  social  protection  for  the  
14:683:44349:12:13:72:528:482:121:Times:121:Times:B:unemployed,  working  in  the  (informal)  service  sector  remained  the  only  feasible  strategy  for  job  
14:684:44460:13:13:72:527:469:121:Times:121:Times:B:seekers. As job creation in these sectors did not respond to an increase in demand for their services, 
14:685:44563:13:16:72:231:456:121:Times:121:Times:B:value-added per worker decreased.  
14:686:44598:16:13:91:528:440:121:Times:121:Times:A:The  truncated  transition  in  Latin  America  is  therefore  most  probably  attributable  to  demand  
14:687:44703:13:13:72:527:427:121:Times:121:Times:B:constraints.  These  restrictions  from  the  demand  side  impede  the  expected  transition  to  a  competitive  
14:688:44818:13:12:72:527:414:121:Times:121:Times:B:industrial  economy  (once  again,  competitiveness  here  is  systemic:  persistent  dualism  implies  that,  
14:689:44929:12:13:72:527:402:121:Times:121:Times:B:even  if  it  is  possible  to  find  islands  of  competitiveness  in  Latin  America,  these  islands  do  not  play  
14:690:45049:13:16:72:265:389:121:Times:49:Times:B:their expected role of development poles).10
14:691:45093:16:13:91:525:373:121:Times:121:Times:A:Effective demand, when one refers to developing countries, is chiefly limited to external demand. 
14:692:45191:13:13:72:527:360:121:Times:121:Times:B:This reductionism is explained usually by the shallowness on internal market and, more importantly, 
14:693:45291:13:12:72:527:347:121:Times:121:Times:B:its limited multiplier effect due to the necessity of importing capital and high technology goods. This 
14:694:45395:12:13:72:527:335:121:Times:121:Times:B:tradition  of  analysis  starts  with  the  Harrod-Domar's  warranted  rate  of  growth  in  a  closed  economy  
14:695:45508:13:13:72:528:322:121:Times:121:Times:B:model,  and  extends  it  to  the  case  of  open  developing  economies  as  in  the  well  known  "two-gaps"  
14:696:45620:13:12:72:526:309:121:Times:121:Times:B:models. Foreign capital can raise their growth rate by temporarily lifting their saving constraints, and 
14:697:45725:12:13:72:527:297:121:Times:121:Times:B:providing  the  foreign  exchange  to  pay  from  necessary  imports.  But  in  the  long  run  debt  should  be  
14:698:45839:13:13:72:528:284:121:Times:121:Times:B:repaid,  and  developing  countries  need  to  export  in  order  to  grow.  A  strategy  focused  on  internal  
14:699:45952:13:12:72:526:271:121:Times:121:Times:B:demand would quickly face balance of payment constraints, as it happened in Latin America with the 
14:700:46051:12:17:72:200:259:121:Times:121:Times:B:external debt crisis of 1982.  
14:701:46082:17:13:91:526:242:121:Times:121:Times:A:The  structural  reforms  implemented  during  the  1980s  intended  to  reshape  the  productive  sector  
14:702:46189:13:12:72:529:229:121:Times:121:Times:B:along  an  export-led  model  of  development,  inspired  by  the  "Asian  Miracle".  By  opening  their  
14:703:46295:12:16:72:526:217:121:Times:121:Times:B:economies, the reformers expected to correct the allocation efficiency gap of previous inward-oriented 
14:704:46398:16:8:71:219:201:121:Times:121:Times:B:                                                      
14:705:46451:8:16:108:526:193:42:Times:100:Times:F:9 Escaith (2006) shows that "productivity proper" increased dramatically in Latin America in the early 
14:706:46554:16:11:72:526:177:100:Times:100:Times:F:1990s, returning to the growth rate registered during the "golden years" of the 1960s. But at the same time, the 
14:707:46667:11:12:72:528:166:100:Times:100:Times:F:industry  reduced  its  participation  in  the  labour  force.  This  suggests  that  reforms  in  LA  were  successful  at  
14:708:46792:12:11:72:528:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:microeconomic  level,  but  were  less  so  from  a  macro  perspective.  This  pattern  differs  from  what  is  been  
14:709:46912:11:12:72:526:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:observed in Asia , were investment in manufacturing increase both productivity and capacity, resulting in higher 
14:710:47025:12:7:72:130:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:employment.  
14:711:47038:7:16:108:526:124:42:Times:100:Times:F:10 It is tempting to blame the "maquiladora" mode of industrialisation for this outcome. But the Asian 
14:712:47141:16:11:71:526:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:example shows that processing manufactured goods for exports can be used by emerging economies to rapidly 
14:713:47247:11:12:71:526:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:close  the  productivity  gap  and  build  an  industrial  base  out  of  the  production  of  labour-intensive  parts.  Indeed,  
14:714:47377:12:11:71:526:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:from  the  dual  perspectives  of  development  macroeconomics  (binding  external  constraints)  and  new  "trade-in  
14:715:47496:11:0:71:378:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:tasks" paradigm, "maquiladoras" should be considered part of the solution.  
15:716:47574:0:12:72:530:759:121:Times:121:Times:B:policies,   and   to   foster   the   development   of   labour   intensive   and   internationally   competitive   
15:717:47690:12:13:72:525:747:121:Times:121:Times:B:manufactures. As a matter of fact, the reverse was observed. Most of the investment that took place in 
15:718:47793:13:13:71:526:734:121:Times:121:Times:B:these sectors was to increase efficiency and gain competitiveness in the face of external competitors. 
15:719:47896:13:12:71:526:721:121:Times:121:Times:B:It led to an increase in the capital/output ratio, but not to an increase in total capacity nor in the use of 
15:720:48006:12:13:71:526:709:121:Times:121:Times:B:more labour. At the contrary, employment in these sectors reduced its share of the total labour force, 
15:721:48109:13:17:71:349:696:121:Times:121:Times:B:as is exemplified by the negative signs affecting labour-shifts.  
15:722:48175:17:12:91:526:679:121:Times:121:Times:A:This may not be surprising, if one remembers that most analysis of the success behind the Asian 
15:723:48271:12:13:72:526:667:121:Times:121:Times:B:Newly Industrialized Economies in the 1970s stressed that the demand-side factors were as likely –or 
15:724:48372:13:12:72:526:654:121:Times:121:Times:B:more– to explain the success of export-led strategies, than supply-side considerations. By adopting an 
15:725:48475:12:13:72:527:642:121:Times:121:Times:B:export-led  orientation,  these  countries  did  not  immediately  benefit  from  greater  growth  in  technical  
15:726:48589:13:13:72:529:629:121:Times:121:Times:B:efficiency  (the  Maddison's  "productivity  proper");  but  the  expanding  demand  linked  to  export  
15:727:48694:13:12:72:526:616:121:Times:121:Times:B:orientations did help them to maintain productivity levels in the face of a rapid increase in production 
15:728:48799:12:13:72:526:604:121:Times:121:Times:B:(Pack, 1988). Viewed from this perspective, the advantage of the first phase of export orientation was 
15:729:48902:13:13:72:527:591:121:Times:121:Times:B:more  quantitative  than  qualitative:  labour  could  be  moved  rapidly  from  low  productivity  sectors  to  
15:730:49015:13:16:72:378:578:121:Times:121:Times:B:high productivity activities without confronting diminishing returns.  
15:731:49086:16:13:91:526:562:121:Times:121:Times:A:This implied that real competitiveness (the capacity to efficiently produce what was demanded by

15:733:49296:13:12:72:529:536:121:Times:121:Times:B:exchange  rate  (nominal  competitiveness).  The  difficulties  faced  by  Latin  America  to  seize  the  
15:734:49403:12:13:72:526:524:121:Times:121:Times:B:opportunities offered by international trade may be related to a lack of competitiveness, itself related 
15:735:49508:13:17:72:419:511:121:Times:121:Times:B:to a misalignment of the effective exchange rates during the transition period.  
15:736:49589:17:12:91:526:494:121:Times:121:Times:A:This relative overvaluation is symptomatic of the so called "resource curse": from an international 
15:737:49689:12:13:72:527:482:121:Times:121:Times:B:perspective,  Latin  America  is  comparatively  rich  in  natural  resources,  which  attract  investments  and  
15:738:49803:13:13:72:529:469:121:Times:121:Times:B:appreciate  the  real  exchange  rate.  By  the  time  of  trade  liberalization,  on  the  other  hand,  Asian  
15:739:49916:13:12:72:527:456:121:Times:121:Times:B:developing  countries  with  large  pools  of  unskilled  labour  force  and  lower  wages,  such  as  China  and  
15:740:50031:12:13:72:527:444:121:Times:121:Times:B:India,  were  already  emerging  in  the  world  trade  scene,  rapidly  gaining  market  shares  in  the  OECD  
15:741:50144:13:17:72:121:431:121:Times:121:Times:B:countries.  
15:742:50156:17:12:91:530:414:121:Times:121:Times:A:These  effects  put  a  cap  to  the  development  of  internationally  competitive  labour-intensive  
15:743:50259:12:13:72:528:402:121:Times:121:Times:B:industries  in  Latin  America  and  forced  a  pattern  of  specialization  based  on  higher-skilled  labour  
15:744:50371:13:12:72:526:389:121:Times:121:Times:B:(Perry  and  Olarreaga,  2006).  11  But  this  niche  of  specialization  is  capital  intensive,  and  was  already  
15:745:50490:12:13:72:527:377:121:Times:121:Times:B:occupied  by  the  NIEs  such  as  Korea  or  Taiwan.  Therefore,  this  strategy  could  not  generate  enough  
15:746:50603:13:13:72:526:364:121:Times:121:Times:B:jobs  to  absorb  the  new  entrants  in  the  urban  labour  market,  and  lower  wages  in  the  industrial  sector  
15:747:50722:13:12:72:528:351:121:Times:121:Times:B:would  not  solve  the  excess  labour  supply.  At  the  contrary,  salaries  for  higher-skill  workers  and  
15:748:50834:12:13:72:529:339:121:Times:121:Times:B:professional  increased  as  firms  were  competing  to  attract  the  needed  technicians.  Infrastructure

15:753:51346:13:12:72:526:271:121:Times:121:Times:B:America, the oversupply of labour had to be absorbed by the non-infrastructure service sector. As the 
15:754:51448:12:13:72:531:259:121:Times:121:Times:B:domestic   market   for   such   services   was   not   expanding   accordingly,   labour   absorption   was   
15:755:51559:13:13:72:523:246:121:Times:121:Times:B:accompanied  by  a  decrease  in  value-added  per  worker  (and  real  salary)  in  the  formal  sector,  and  –
15:756:51672:13:12:72:527:233:121:Times:121:Times:B:increasingly–  by  the  rise  of  the  urban  informal  sector.  The  share  of  informal  sector  in  total  urban  
15:757:51789:12:13:72:528:221:121:Times:121:Times:B:employment  increased  from  43%  in  1990  to  47%  in  2003,  in  a  context  of  increased  intersectoral  
15:758:51899:13:17:72:229:208:121:Times:121:Times:B:income differential (Weller, 2005).

15:762:52274:13:12:72:527:153:121:Times:121:Times:B:prediction;  in  the  case  of  Asia,  it  reflects  the  rise  of  an  urban  middle  class  as  workers  move-up  the

16:774:53121:17:13:91:526:680:121:Times:121:Times:A:The prospects for Latin American income distribution are not bright, if the recent simulation from 
16:775:53220:13:12:72:528:667:121:Times:121:Times:B:World  Bank  are  to  be  believed.  According  to  its  simulations,  the  share  of  Latin  American  in  the

16:777:53424:17:12:91:528:638:121:Times:121:Times:A:Albeit  "comparaison  n'est  pas  raison",  the  Asian  example  could  serve  as  a  guide  for  future  
16:778:53530:12:13:72:527:626:121:Times:121:Times:B:policy.  Macroeconomic  policy  has  been  carefully  managed  in  most  Asian  country  to  complement  
16:779:53635:13:13:72:526:613:121:Times:121:Times:B:export-led policies, but such a strategy is not easily put into practice. 12First, nominal wage increases 
16:780:53741:13:12:72:527:600:121:Times:121:Times:B:have  to  be  kept  under  control  in  order  to  maintain  the  overall  favourable  competitive  position  and  
16:781:53856:12:17:72:341:588:121:Times:121:Times:B:control the income gap between rural and urban population.  
16:782:53916:17:13:91:528:571:121:Times:121:Times:A:Writing  on  China  economic  policy  challenges,  Flasbeck  (2005)  recommends  that,  if  it  is  not

16:784:54134:12:13:72:529:546:121:Times:121:Times:B:might  be  the  second  best  solution.  But  one  should  be  reminded  that  real  exchange  rate,  which  
16:785:54243:13:13:72:527:533:121:Times:121:Times:B:determines  nominal  competitiveness,  is  not  a  flexible  policy  variable,  even  with  the  capital  controls  
16:786:54359:13:12:72:527:520:121:Times:121:Times:B:recommended  by  this  author.  The  experience  of  Thailand  when  such  controls  were  implemented  to  
16:787:54467:12:13:72:526:508:121:Times:121:Times:B:curb currency appreciation are an example. More importantly, competitive devaluations undertaken at 
16:788:54567:13:17:72:365:495:121:Times:121:Times:B:global level are at best a zero-sum games, and are not sustainable. 
16:789:54635:17:12:91:523:478:121:Times:121:Times:A:On  the  other  hand,  prudent  macroeconomic  management  may  be  able  to  prevent  the  non-
16:790:54731:12:13:72:526:466:121:Times:121:Times:B:structural appreciation of real exchange rate that accompany the over-heating phases of the economy.

16:798:55447:16:13:91:527:357:121:Times:121:Times:A:(i) Fostering sectoral and geographical labour mobility, not only in the restricted sense of labour 
16:799:55547:13:13:72:526:344:121:Times:121:Times:B:market flexibility, but also by helping workers to move to better paid or more promising jobs (putting

16:806:56197:17:12:91:526:247:121:Times:121:Times:A:(iii) Seizing the opportunity offered by off-shoring and out-sourcing from industrial countries, to 
16:807:56297:12:13:72:528:235:121:Times:121:Times:B:generate  a  critical  mass  of  manufacturing  jobs,  especially  within  the  low-to-middle  qualification

17:844:59759:13:12:72:526:444:121:Times:121:Times:B:resources  from  agriculture  to  industry  is  still  quite  a  powerful  factor  in  both  regions,  albeit  in  Latin  
17:845:59881:12:13:72:529:432:121:Times:121:Times:B:America  it  does  not  always  lead  to  a  favourable  outcome  as  far  as  total  labour  productivity  is  
17:846:59993:13:17:72:125:419:121:Times:121:Times:B:concerned.  
17:847:60005:17:12:91:527:402:121:Times:121:Times:A:The data indicate also a very contrasted situation between both developing regions. While Asian 
17:848:60101:12:13:71:527:390:121:Times:121:Times:B:real  economy  appears  to  be  engaged  in  a  relatively  smooth  transition  from  the  low  productivity  
17:849:60211:13:12:71:525:377:121:Times:121:Times:B:traditional activities to a more industrialized economy, the pattern emerging out of the Latin American 
17:850:60315:12:17:71:444:365:121:Times:121:Times:B:data indicates a polarizing trend, with a tendency to create a new dualistic economy. 
17:851:60401:17:13:91:527:348:121:Times:121:Times:A:While  industry  in  Asia  was  able  to  close  the  productivity  gap  with  industrialised  countries  and  
17:852:60512:13:12:71:526:335:121:Times:121:Times:B:gain international competitiveness in manufacturing, its firms were also capable of using globalisation 
17:853:60616:12:13:71:527:323:121:Times:121:Times:B:to  expand  their  market  and  create  more  jobs.  In  Latin  America,  industries  adopted  a  more  defensive  
17:854:60731:13:13:71:527:310:121:Times:121:Times:B:strategy;  industrial  investment  was  meant  to  preserve  competitiveness  in  the  international  market  by  
17:855:60845:13:16:71:527:297:121:Times:121:Times:B:improving productivity, but was not meant to increase production capacity, at least on a sectoral scale.  
17:856:60951:16:13:91:527:281:121:Times:121:Times:A:As  a  result,  the  Asian  productive  sectors  were  able  to  offer  jobs  of  increasing  quality  to  their  
17:857:61065:13:13:71:527:268:121:Times:121:Times:B:economic  active  population  in  both  goods  and  services  sectors.  From  a  structural  perspective,  Asia  
17:858:61178:13:12:71:526:255:121:Times:121:Times:B:followed the predictions of the Lewis model. In Latin America, structural reforms were successful at 
17:859:61279:12:13:71:526:243:121:Times:121:Times:B:microeconomic level, as firms improved their competitiveness, but less so from a macro perspective 
17:860:61378:13:13:71:526:230:121:Times:121:Times:B:as  few  new  jobs  were  created.  Because  industries  did  not  create  new  job  opportunities  in  the  low  to  
17:861:61496:13:12:71:526:217:121:Times:121:Times:B:middle qualification brackets, Latin America experienced a truncation of its structural transition. The 
17:862:61600:12:13:71:528:205:121:Times:121:Times:B:relative  excess  supply  of  labour  was  absorbed  reactively  by  the  service  sector,  in  a  context  of  
17:863:61712:13:13:71:529:192:121:Times:121:Times:B:decreasing  value-added  per  head.  Dualism,  typical  of  the  initial  phases  of  the  Lewis  model,  
17:864:61818:13:16:71:339:179:121:Times:121:Times:B:reappeared with the growth of a large urban informal sector. 
17:865:61879:16:13:91:528:163:121:Times:121:Times:A:To  explain  the  diverging  trajectories,  the  paper  advances  that  a  mixture  of  real  and  nominal  
17:866:61987:13:12:72:526:150:121:Times:121:Times:B:factors may be at work. When Latin America tried to apply the Asian export-led strategy and adopted 
17:867:62087:12:13:72:528:138:121:Times:121:Times:B:trade  liberalization  to  solve  the  structural  imbalances  that  caused  the  1982  crisis,  it  faced  strong  
17:868:62203:13:16:72:527:125:121:Times:121:Times:B:competition  from  a  new  wave  of  Asian  developing  countries  with  large  pools  of  cheaper  labour.  In  
17:869:62316:16:12:71:526:109:121:Times:121:Times:B:                                                                                                                                                                     
17:870:62480:12:12:72:527:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:the  Latin  American  structuralist  school  has  privileged  vertically  integrated  "national  champions"  to  be  the  
17:871:62602:12:11:72:527:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:leading  agents  behind  changes  in  production  patterns  and  increase  in  total  factor  productivity.  We  argue  that  
17:872:62728:11:0:72:293:74:100:Times:100:Times:F:both strategies are complementary, and not substitute.  
18:873:62786:0:12:72:527:759:121:Times:121:Times:B:this competition, Latin America may have also suffered from structurally overvalued exchange rates, 
18:874:62886:12:13:72:531:747:121:Times:121:Times:B:because   it   is   comparatively   richer   than   Asia   in   natural   resources.   The   resulting   lack   of   
18:875:63003:13:13:72:528:734:121:Times:121:Times:B:competitiveness  on  labour  intensive  manufactures  squeezed  the  Latin  American  manufacture  into  
18:876:63108:13:12:72:526:721:121:Times:121:Times:B:higher productivity types of activity, which increased the demand for higher skills and depressed the 
18:877:63210:12:17:72:252:709:121:Times:121:Times:B:offer of more traditional industrial jobs.  
18:878:63254:17:13:91:527:692:121:Times:121:Times:A:The  deterioration  of  the  income  distribution  in  Latin  America  resulted  from  two  trends:    (i)  a  
18:879:63365:13:12:72:527:679:121:Times:121:Times:B:higher demand for high qualification workers, pushing up the salary of professionals and technicians 
18:880:63466:12:13:72:526:667:121:Times:121:Times:B:(like in Asia), (ii) an excess supply of labour in the services sector leading to a decline in value added 
18:881:63573:13:12:72:526:654:121:Times:121:Times:B:per worker and lower salaries. The emergence of a large urban informal sector, with the resurgence of 
18:882:63675:12:17:72:345:642:121:Times:121:Times:B:a new dualism in the labour market, epitomizes this situation. 
18:883:63738:17:13:91:529:625:121:Times:121:Times:A:Because  nominal  factors  are  part  of  the  determinants  of  the  international  competitiveness,  
18:884:63841:13:12:72:529:612:121:Times:121:Times:B:appropriate  demand  management  at  the  macroeconomic  level  are  therefore  needed  to  avoid  real  
18:885:63946:12:13:72:527:600:121:Times:121:Times:B:exchange rate cycles and provide the domestic firms with a favourable competitive environment. But 
18:886:64045:13:13:72:527:587:121:Times:121:Times:B:structural  issues  call  for  structural  remedies,  and  the  rationale  behind  the  Lewis  and  Harris-Todaro  
18:887:64160:13:12:72:530:574:121:Times:121:Times:B:models  suggests  some  lines  of  action.  Considering  the  importance  of  the  labour  reallocation  
18:888:64265:12:13:72:526:562:121:Times:121:Times:B:component in explaining total factor productivity, the structural policies should include actions aimed 
18:889:64369:13:13:72:531:549:121:Times:121:Times:B:at   facilitating   resource-shifts   from   low   to   high   productivity   sectors,   while   promoting   rural   
18:890:64486:13:12:72:528:536:121:Times:121:Times:B:development  to  limit  spurious  inter-sectoral  shifts.  As  small  and  medium  firms  are  the  dominant  
18:891:64596:12:13:72:530:524:121:Times:121:Times:B:employers  in  most  developing  countries,  they  should  also  be  the  main  beneficiaries  of  trade  
18:892:64702:13:17:72:165:511:121:Times:121:Times:B:facilitation policies.  
18:893:64726:17:12:91:526:494:121:Times:121:Times:A:Finally, the Latin American region should look for export opportunities outside the manufacturing 
18:894:64824:12:13:72:526:482:121:Times:121:Times:B:sector. Thanks to the IT revolution and the new international business models, its large services sector 
18:895:64929:13:13:72:526:469:121:Times:121:Times:B:has a potential for developing new export activities, a way that has been successfully taken by India. 
18:896:65032:13:12:72:527:456:121:Times:121:Times:B:Health  and  tourism  sectors  are  particularly  attractive  labour  intensive  activities,  because  they  create  
18:897:65149:12:17:72:318:444:121:Times:121:Times:B:jobs across the full range of low to high qualifications.
