2:32:1785:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:Intertemporal preferences are difficult to measure. We estimate time preferences using a structural
2:33:1884:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:buffer stock consumption model and the Method of Simulated Moments. The model includes stochastic
2:34:1981:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:labor income, liquidity constraints, child and adult dependents, liquid and illiquid assets, revolving
2:35:2083:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:credit, retirement, and discount functions that allow short-run and long-run discount rates to differ.
2:36:2185:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:Data on retirement wealth accumulation, credit card borrowing, and consumption-income comovement
2:37:2281:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:identify the model. Our benchmark estimates imply a 40% short-term annualized discount rate and
2:38:2376:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:a 4.3% long-term annualized discount rate. Almost all specifications reject the restriction to a constant
2:39:2481:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:discount rate. Our quantitative results are sensitive to assumptions about the return on illiquid assets
2:40:2585:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:F:and the coefficient of relative risk aversion. When we jointly estimate the coefficient of relative risk
2:41:2689:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:F:aversion and the discount function, the short-term discount rate is 15% and the long-term discount
2:42:2787:14:28:72:132:448:12:Times:12:Times:C:rate is 3.8%.

3:59:3094:0:31:72:185:683:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:1  Introduction
3:60:3109:31:20:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Though intertemporal preferences play a critical role in most important economic decisions, econo-
3:61:3207:20:20:72:557:632:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mists have not identied a reliable method for measuring them (Frederick, Loewenstein and ODonoghue
3:62:3307:20:21:72:540:612:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:2002).  The vast majority of research on time preferences has used laboratory studies in which the
3:63:3405:21:20:72:540:591:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:experimenter controls the choices that subjects face.  Laboratory experiments often ask subjects
3:64:3501:20:20:72:540:571:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to weigh immediate rewards against delayed rewards.  A typical study asks subjects if they would
3:65:3597:20:21:72:298:551:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:prefer $Xnow or $Yat a specied future date.
3:66:3641:21:20:89:540:530:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Despite the advantages of controlled laboratory experimentation, such studies may confound
3:67:3731:20:20:72:540:510:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:time preferences with other considerations, like the trustworthiness of the experimenter, the abstract
3:68:3833:20:20:72:540:490:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:nature of the laboratory task, or the outside investment options of the subject.  It is not clear
3:69:3930:20:21:72:540:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:whether laboratory experiments measure the discount function, market interest rates, curvature of
3:70:4027:21:20:72:461:449:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the utility function, some combination of these factors, or something else entirely.
3:71:4111:20:20:89:539:429:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Research using structural modelling andelddata has its own strengths and weaknesses. Field
3:72:4202:20:21:72:540:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:data reect choices from real-world markets and hence have greater external validity than ab-
3:73:4295:21:20:72:540:388:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:stract and unfamiliar laboratory decisions.  Research with eld data can also take advantage of
3:74:4390:20:20:72:540:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:existing large datasets on household behavior.  However, eld data are di¢cult to interpret since
3:75:4487:20:21:72:540:348:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the researcher does not know exactly what tradeo¤s households actually face in the marketplace.
3:76:4582:21:20:72:540:327:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Structural modelling helps to pin down some of these tradeo¤s but such modelling relies on a large
3:77:4680:20:20:72:262:307:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:set of explicit and implicit assumptions.
3:78:4721:20:21:89:540:287:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Given all of these considerations, laboratory and eld research complement each other. Hence
3:79:4813:21:20:72:539:266:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:it is surprising that e¤orts to estimate discount rates have primarily used laboratory evidence.1
3:80:4910:20:20:72:539:246:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:This imbalance is particularly true of the recent research ongeneralizedtime preferences (i.e.,
3:81:5005:20:20:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:discount functions that are not restricted to the class of exponential functions).   Hundreds of
3:82:5101:20:21:72:540:206:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:studies beginning with Chung and Herrnstein (1967) and reviewed in Ainslie (1992) and Frederick
3:83:5196:21:20:72:540:185:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:et al. (2002) have estimated generalized discount functions with laboratory evidence while only a
3:84:5293:20:26:72:315:165:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:handful have attempted to do this with eld data.2
3:85:5343:26:15:84:540:139:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:1Notable exceptions include Carroll and Samwick (1997), Gourinchas and Parker (2002), Hausman (1979),

3:87:5532:7:15:84:539:117:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:2Prominent eld studies include Attanasio and Weber (1995),Attanasio, Banks, Meghir and Weber (1999), Paser-
3:88:5640:15:0:72:358:102:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:man (2004), Fang and Silverman (2004), and Shui and Ausubel (2004).
4:89:5708:0:20:89:540:683:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The current paper contributes to the literature estimating generalized discount functions using
4:90:5803:20:20:72:540:663:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:eld data. We use lifecycle consumption data to estimate time preferences and to formally test the
4:91:5901:20:21:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:restriction to exponential discounting.  Specically, we use numerical methods to recursively solve
4:92:6000:21:20:72:540:622:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and simulate a structural bu¤er stock model of lifecycle consumption and investment choices
4:93:6093:20:20:72:540:602:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(Deaton 1991, Carroll 1992, Carroll 1997).  Our model includes a rich array of nancial instru-
4:94:6188:20:20:72:540:582:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ments, constraints, demographic factors, and stochastic events   e.g., liquid and illiquid assets,
4:95:6287:20:21:72:540:562:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:revolving credit, liquidity constraints, household dependents, mortality, retirement, Social Secu-
4:96:6385:21:20:72:540:541:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rity, and stochastic labor income  and thus controls for a number of relevant factors that a¤ect
4:97:6482:20:20:72:185:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:intertemporal decisions.
4:98:6506:20:21:89:540:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We estimate the models time preference parameters using a two-stage Method of Simulated
4:99:6594:21:20:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Moments (MSM) procedure (McFadden 1989, Pakes and Pollard 1989, Du¢e and Singleton 1993),
4:100:6683:20:20:72:539:460:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:which was rst used to study lifecycle consumption behavior by Gourinchas and Parker (2002).3
4:101:6776:20:21:72:540:440:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The MSM procedure extends the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) to account for numerical
4:102:6866:21:20:72:540:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:simulation error. In the rst stage of the MSM procedure we estimate inputs to the life-cycle model,
4:103:6966:20:20:72:540:399:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:including the parameters of the stochastic labor income process, interest rates, credit card borrowing
4:104:7068:20:21:72:540:379:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:limits, and parameters that describe variation in household size over the lifecycle.  In the second
4:105:7167:21:20:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:stage of the MSM procedure we use the simulation model to estimate time preference parameters.
4:106:7261:20:20:72:540:338:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:These preference parameters are identied by empirical patterns of wealth accumulation, credit
4:107:7355:20:20:72:540:318:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:card borrowing, and consumption-income comovement.  Uncertainty in estimates of the rst stage
4:108:7449:20:21:72:540:298:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:parameters propagates to the standard errors for the time preference parameters estimated in the
4:109:7545:21:20:72:540:277:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:second stage.  Formal incorporation of the rst stage is critical since it raises our second-stage
4:110:7643:20:20:72:306:257:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:standard errors by nearly an order of magnitude.
4:111:7691:20:21:89:540:237:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Our analysis has three goals.  First, this paper uses eld data to estimate time preference
4:112:7782:21:20:72:540:216:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:parameters for households with a high school degree but not a college degree, comprising 59% of the
4:113:7881:20:20:72:540:196:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:US population. We study both the (restricted) exponential discount function and an (unrestricted)
4:114:7978:20:26:72:539:176:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:generalization that nests the exponential case. The unrestrictedquasi-hyperbolicdiscount function
4:115:8075:26:15:84:539:150:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:3Gourinchas and Parker (2002) and French (2005) use MSM to estimate di¤erent aspects of consumption models.
4:116:8182:15:11:72:539:135:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:Gourinchas and Parker identify the exponential discount function and the coe¢cient of relative risk aversion from
4:117:8295:11:11:72:539:124:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:lifecycle consumption proles.  French assesses how the opportunity to save and self-insure a¤ects the impact of
4:118:8407:11:11:72:539:113:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:legislated Social Security and Medicare eligibility ages on the retirement decision.  Most other applications of MSM
4:119:8523:11:0:72:276:102:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:have been in the industrial organization literature.
5:120:8576:0:20:72:540:683:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:allows the discount rate to di¤er in the short-run and the long-run.  Second, we formally test the
5:121:8674:20:20:72:540:663:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:restricted and unrestricted models, using both t-tests and overidentication tests.  Finally, we ask
5:122:8774:20:21:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:whether these models accurately predict important empirical regularities in the lifecycle literature.
5:123:8875:21:20:89:540:622:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:When we estimate a restricted (exponential) discount function, the MSM procedure estimates
5:124:8965:20:20:72:539:602:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a single annual discount rate of 16.7%.4By contrast, when we estimate an unrestricted (quasi-

5:126:9156:20:21:72:540:562:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:39.5% and a long-run annualized discount rate of only 4.3%. All of these estimates are statistically
5:127:9256:21:20:72:540:541:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:signicant at the 1% level.  Our estimates also imply a formal rejection of the restricted case: i.e.,
5:128:9358:20:20:72:527:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:we reject the hypothesis that the short-run discount rate is equal to the long-run discount rate.
5:129:9455:20:21:89:540:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Overidentication tests reinforce these conclusions. Only the exponential model is consistently
5:130:9550:21:20:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rejected by overidentication tests.   Intuitively, the exponential model cannot simultaneously
5:131:9645:20:20:72:540:460:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:explain high levels of credit card borrowing and high levels of retirement wealth accumulation.
5:132:9740:20:21:72:540:440:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:By contrast, the quasi-hyperbolic discount function implies that consumers will simultaneously
5:133:9834:21:20:72:540:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:act patiently and impatiently, because consumers have conicting short-run and long-run discount
5:134:9930:20:20:72:540:399:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rates.5In theory, low long-run discount rates explain why households accumulate substantial
5:135:10021:20:21:72:540:379:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(illiquid) retirement wealth at real interest rates of about 5%, while high short-run discount rates
5:136:10121:21:20:72:539:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:imply that thesamehouseholds borrow regularly on credit cards at real interest rates of 12%. By
5:137:10216:20:20:72:540:338:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:accumulating wealth in illiquid form, households commit themselves to act patiently in the future
5:138:10313:20:20:72:540:318:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(i.e., not to spend down accumulated assets).  However, when liquid assets and unused credit card
5:139:10410:20:21:72:493:298:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:balances are available, households spend when they can and therefore appear impatient.
5:140:10496:21:20:89:540:277:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We conclude the paper by reporting a wide range of robustness checks that reinforce some of
5:141:10587:20:20:72:540:257:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:our previous ndings and identify the limits of our results.  In 19 of 21 cases we nd a signicant
5:142:10686:20:21:72:540:237:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:gap between long-term and short-term discount rates, and in the other two cases we nd a very
5:143:10779:21:20:72:540:216:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:large gap that is swamped by even larger standard errors. Quantitatively, our parameter estimates
5:144:10876:20:20:72:540:196:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and standard errors are robust to many assumptions  e.g., about the persistence of the income
5:145:10970:20:26:72:540:176:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:process, the bequest motive, returns to scale within the household, and the credit card interest rate
5:146:11071:26:15:84:539:150:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:4By contrast, most authors who calibrate exponential discount functions with lifecycle consumption and wealth
5:147:11180:15:11:72:539:135:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:data have adopted discount rates that are around 5% (Engen, Gale and Scholz 1994, Hubbard, Skinner and Zeldes

6:155:11875:21:20:72:540:622:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimating it simultaneously with the discounting parameters.  The MSM procedure results in
6:156:11966:20:20:72:540:602:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimates of the coe¢cient of relative risk aversion between 0.2 and 0.3 in both the exponential
6:157:12062:20:20:72:540:582:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and quasi-hyperbolic cases.  In the exponential case, the estimated discount rate falls, and the

6:159:12254:21:20:72:540:541:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:long-term discount rates also fall but continue to di¤er statistically, and all three parameters are

6:169:13133:20:20:72:540:338:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:hypothesis of exponential discounting.  Their results in the naive case are very similar.  Finally,

7:195:15423:20:20:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:heterogeneity among households, credit card borrowing is ubiquitous across the entire distribution
7:196:15521:20:21:72:540:382:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of wealth. Table 2 of Laibson et al. (2003) reports the fraction of households borrowing on credit
7:197:15619:21:20:72:539:361:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cards by age and by wealth quartile.9Among households with a head between ages 20-29 that are
7:198:15712:20:20:72:540:341:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the top wealth quartile for their age group, three-fourths did not repay their credit card bills in

7:200:15916:20:21:72:540:301:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of median wealth-holders had credit card debt.  Even among the households with a head between

8:243:19584:15:11:72:540:117:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:because wealth is so strongly skewed to the right. For instance, the ratio of mean to median is six times greater for

10:282:23041:21:20:72:539:622:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:For computational tractability, capital gains equal zero (i.e.,RZ= 1)and the annual consumption

10:288:23566:20:21:89:540:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Four observations motivate these assumptions aboutZ.   First, despite increasing nancial
10:289:23655:21:20:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sophistication many household assets continue to be partially illiquid and were certainly illiquid
10:290:23753:20:20:72:540:460:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:during our sample period (1978 to 1998). Accessing equity in homes, cars and retirement plans like
10:291:23851:20:21:72:540:440:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:401(k)s entails at least small transactions costs and delays.  Second, theory (Laibson 1997) and
10:292:23947:21:20:72:540:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:simulations (Laibson et al. 2003) have shown that for the quasi-hyperbolic case, small transactions
10:293:24046:20:20:72:539:399:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:costs have the same impact on consumers as complete illiquidity.  Third, illiquidity ofZmimics

10:297:24423:20:20:72:540:318:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:robustness of our set-up by makingZmore attractive, and we highlight the potential drawbacks
10:298:24515:20:26:72:496:298:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of assuming thatZis illiquid when we discuss extensions of the model in Subsection 6.4.
10:299:24602:26:15:80:539:272:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:18Specically, from the quarterly interest rates reported inthe Federal Reserve Boards G-19 historical series,
10:300:24713:15:11:72:539:257:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:we subtract the CPI-U and the bankruptcy rate. We calculate the latter by dividing the number of bankruptcies
10:301:24822:11:11:72:539:246:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:(American Bankruptcy Institute) by the number of US households that have credit cards (SCF). This attributes all
10:302:24934:11:11:72:282:235:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:US bankruptcies to households holding credit cards.
10:303:24985:11:11:81:539:224:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:These calculations omit two considerations that would further lower the e¤ective credit card rate.  First, without
10:304:25099:11:11:72:539:213:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:declaring bankruptcy, households might be able to default on their credit card debt.  Second, consumption may be
10:305:25211:11:11:72:539:202:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:unusually low in the bankruptcy/default state, which reduces the cost of borrowing since repayment only occurs in
10:306:25324:11:11:72:539:191:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:good states.  On the other hand, we also omitted two bankruptcy-related considerations that raise the e¤ective
10:307:25436:11:11:72:539:180:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:credit card rate.  The model does not account for the stigma associated with bankruptcy (Gross and Souleles 2002b)
10:308:25550:11:11:72:539:169:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:or for the cost of future exclusion from credit markets.  Robustness checks  using a wide range of credit card

13:439:32823:11:11:72:540:153:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:example, if labor supply were instead endogenously chosen,then households could insure idiosyncratic shocks by
13:440:32933:11:11:72:540:142:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:working more hours or postponing retirement.  Introducing such features into the model would make credit card

18:627:42564:21:20:89:540:534:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:At the estimated parameter values, the quasi-hyperbolic model generates the moment predic-

20:688:47497:27:20:72:539:552:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We perturb the return on the illiquid asset (\r)and the credit card interest rate (rCC)one-by-one

20:691:47719:20:20:89:539:491:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:A:In Column 1 we reproduce the benchmark results as a reference. In Column 2 we set\r= 3:38%;
20:692:47810:20:21:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:corresponding to the average tax- and ination-adjusted mortgage interest rate from 1980-2000, as
20:693:47907:21:20:72:540:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:calculated from Freddie Macs historical series of nominal mortgage interest rates and the CPI-U,
20:694:48004:20:20:72:540:430:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:assuming a marginal tax rate of 25%.  Intuitively, this choice for\rreects the interest savings
20:695:48100:20:21:72:540:410:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:resulting from paying o¤ a dollar of mortgage debt. We interpret 3.38% as being at the low end of
20:696:48197:21:20:72:540:389:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a range of possible assumptions about returns to the illiquid assetZ:In Column 2 we estimate a

20:698:48386:20:20:72:540:349:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:asset is relatively low, consumers will only invest in the illiquid asset if they have a low long-run
20:699:48487:20:21:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:discount rate.  Lowering the long-run discount rate makes the consumer more patient generally,
20:700:48581:21:20:72:540:308:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:so the MSM procedure generates a greater short-run discount rate (i.e., a lower value of\f) to
20:701:48675:20:20:72:540:288:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:o¤set this e¤ect and thereby maintain high rates of credit card borrowing and consumption-income
20:702:48771:20:21:72:534:268:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:comovement.  As a net result of these changes, the over-identifying restrictions are now rejected.
20:703:48869:21:20:89:540:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In Column 3, we consider the case\r= 6:59%:Flavin and Yamashita (2002) calculate this as

20:705:49055:20:21:72:539:207:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and taxes.34We view this gure as falling toward the upper end of a range of possible returns to
20:706:49151:21:20:72:540:186:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the illiquid asset in our model.  If our model distinguished between average and marginal returns
20:707:49248:20:26:72:540:166:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:we would want to use the marginal return not the average return on housing.35Moreover, even the
20:708:49343:26:11:80:539:140:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:33Our measure ofrCCis constructed from aggregate data, so its true variabilityis underestimated in the rst stage.
20:709:49457:11:15:80:539:129:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:34Flavin and Yamashita (2002) assume that use-value is equal to the real return on nancial assets plus housing
20:710:49568:15:7:72:205:114:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:depreciation plus property taxes.
20:711:49601:7:15:80:540:107:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:35Because of transaction costs, at the margin it may be optimalto pay o¤ the mortgage rather than buying a larger
20:712:49714:15:0:72:403:92:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:house.  The marginal return to paying o¤ a mortgage is 3.38% aswe argue above.
21:713:49794:0:20:72:540:683:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:average return to housing may be lower than 6.59% because of transaction costs of buying/selling

21:724:50719:20:20:72:539:460:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:formal incorporation of uncertainty inrCCthrough the rst stage correction only accounts for
21:725:50811:20:21:72:540:440:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:variation in population average interest rates.  Additional tests in Columns 4 and 5 could capture
21:726:50909:21:20:72:540:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:individual-level variation.  In addition, these changes correspond to di¤erent perspectives on how
21:727:51007:20:20:72:540:399:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:bankruptcy matters for the cost of credit card borrowing. Our benchmark value forrCCequals the
21:728:51101:20:21:72:540:379:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:debt-weighted average interest rate from the Fed, minus ination, minus the personal bankruptcy
21:729:51196:21:20:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rate.  This ignores the fact (i) that the marginal utility of consumption may be especially high
21:730:51292:20:20:72:540:338:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the bankruptcy state, and that households may default without declaring bankruptcy, implying
21:731:51387:20:20:72:540:318:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that our correction is too small, and (ii) that bankruptcy carries stigma (Gross and Souleles 2002b),
21:732:51488:20:21:72:540:298:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:implying that our correction is too large.  We favor the middle specication as our benchmark,
21:733:51582:21:20:72:539:277:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and note that changes inrCCof about 150 basis points reported in Columns 4 and 5 have little
21:734:51674:20:20:72:540:257:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:quantitative e¤ect on the time preference estimates.  However, these perturbations do lead to a
21:735:51769:20:21:72:277:237:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rejection of the overidentifying restrictions.
21:736:51815:21:20:89:539:216:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In the bottom panel of the table we estimate the model with the restriction\f= 1:In every

21:738:51975:26:15:80:540:170:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:36In columns 2 and 3, the exponential results are nearly identical to the benchmark case; the point estimates do not

22:751:53158:21:20:72:540:473:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:theoretical work casts doubt on the prevailing approach to modeling risk attitudes.  Kahneman

23:783:55916:21:20:72:337:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:credit card moments, lifecycle accumulation is minimal.

23:786:56063:36:27:72:304:343:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:C:5.3.3  Returns to Scale in Household Size
23:787:56104:27:20:72:540:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The household utility function depends on the number of people in the household and the intra-
23:788:56198:20:21:72:539:296:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f7:B:household returns to scale.  In the benchmark case, we assume that the e¤ective household sizent
23:789:56294:21:20:72:540:275:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:at timetequals two spouses, plus the number of adult dependents, plus 0.4 times the number of
23:790:56387:20:20:72:155:255:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:child dependents.
23:791:56404:20:21:89:540:235:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In this subsection we analyze two modications to these assumptions.  First, we implement
23:792:56493:21:27:72:540:214:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the square root scale, (Ruggles 1990, Atkinson, Rainwater and Smeeding 1995), in which period
23:793:56588:27:0:72:235:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f8:B:utility equalsu(Ct; Zt; Nt) =Nt-

23:800:56685:17:20:72:540:166:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:household.   This formulation treats household heads, child dependents, and adult dependents
23:801:56777:20:20:72:540:146:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:symmetrically, but still captures returns to scale since the square root function is concave.  The
23:802:56875:20:20:72:540:126:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:e¤ect of this change is reported in Column 6 of Table 4A.  In the quasi-hyperbolic case, we nd
23:803:56970:20:0:72:539:106:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that\ffalls slightly,-rises slightly, and goodness of t worsens slightly. The overidentication test
24:804:57073:0:20:72:364:683:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:fails at the 5% level.  In the exponential case,-rises slightly.
24:805:57137:20:20:89:540:663:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Second, we study a partial individual mortality assumption. In the benchmark case mortality
24:806:57230:20:21:72:539:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:occurs at the level of the household, so the two household heads die simultaneously.37In contrast,
24:807:57328:21:20:72:539:622:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:under partial individual mortality we incorporate individual mortality directly intont.38We
24:808:57419:20:20:72:540:602:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:assume that utility depends continuously on the expected number of heads that remain alive until
24:809:57515:20:20:72:540:582:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:age 84, at which point the expected number of surviving heads falls below 1.  After age 84, under
24:810:57612:20:21:72:540:562:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:partial individual mortality, we retain our original assumption that mortality is a discrete event.
24:811:57711:21:20:72:539:541:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:This change generates the estimates in Column 7 of Table 4A. Relative to the benchmark,\ffalls
24:812:57805:20:36:72:375:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and-rises. Now the overidentication restrictions are rejected.
24:813:57868:36:27:72:205:485:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f1:C:5.3.4  Compound Cases
24:814:57889:27:20:72:540:458:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We also consider four compound cases to evaluate the consequences of letting\r; rCC; -;and

24:817:58163:20:20:72:539:397:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and-= 1;in Case C we assume\r= 3:38%; rCC= 13%; -= 5, the square root scale, and
24:818:58243:20:20:72:501:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:individual mortality; and in Case D we assume\r= 6:59%,rCC= 10%;and-= 0:2196.
24:819:58322:20:21:89:540:357:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Case A combines three perturbations of rst stage parameters that we discussed and reported
24:820:58413:21:20:72:539:336:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:above.  In isolation, each of those perturbations lowers the estimates of\f:In Column 6 of Table
24:821:58509:20:20:72:540:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:4B we report that their combined e¤ect results in estimates of^\f= 0:375and^-= 0:972.  When
24:822:58600:20:21:72:539:296:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:we restrict\fto equal 1 (Column 6) we estimate^-= 0:770:With such a low^-;the exponential
24:823:58689:21:20:72:540:275:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:discounting model predicts credit card borrowing and excess sensitivity quite well, but predicts
24:824:58785:20:20:72:260:255:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:approximately no wealth accumulation.
24:825:58822:20:21:89:540:235:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In Case B we combine the three perturbations that are opposite to those in Case A, and we
24:826:58911:21:20:72:540:214:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimate^\f= 0:908and^-= 0:943(Column 7 of Table 4B). This estimate carries a small standard
24:827:59003:20:20:72:539:194:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:error, implying that even under aggressive assumptions about\r; rCC;and-, we still nd that^\fis
24:828:59099:20:26:72:187:174:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:signicantly less than 1.
24:829:59124:26:15:80:539:148:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:37This assumption induces two o¤-setting biases (Laibson et al. 2003). First, it rules out partial intra-household
24:830:59238:15:11:72:539:133:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:longevity insurance through independent mortality outcomes. Second, it does not account for the rise in per-capita
24:831:59352:11:7:72:323:122:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:consumption needs when one of the two household heads dies.
24:832:59411:7:15:80:539:115:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:38For comparability to our benchmark case, we use our benchmark assumptions about returns to scale in the
24:833:59516:15:0:72:261:100:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:household, in contrast to the square root scale.
25:834:59566:0:20:89:540:683:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The third compound case, Case C, combines all the perturbations discussed above that have
25:835:59655:20:17:72:540:663:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:decreased^\f;and also assumes-= 5:Now, reported in Column 8, we obtain^\f= 0:178and

25:837:59815:24:20:89:539:622:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, in Case D we adopt-= 0:2196the value of-we obtained when estimating\f; -;
25:838:59898:20:20:72:539:602:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and-simultaneouslyand we also assume\r= 6:59%andrCC= 10%. As expected, this is the
25:839:59981:20:20:72:539:582:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:combination of assumptions that pushes\fclosest to 1. We nd^\f= 0:947and^-= 0:946:However,
25:840:60072:20:21:72:540:562:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:B:the standard error on^\fhas shrunk, as in Case B and in the simultaneous estimation of\f; -;and-
25:841:60168:21:20:72:539:541:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:reported above, so even in this case the\f= 1null hypothesis is rejected with at-statistic of 3.31.
25:842:60267:20:20:89:540:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In the bottom half of Columns 6-9 we report estimates in the compound cases for the restricted

25:845:60555:20:43:72:288:460:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:also rejects the overidentication restrictions.

25:847:60616:31:37:72:374:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:This papers ndings suggest several directions for future work.
25:848:60680:37:27:72:148:349:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:6.1  Naivete
25:849:60692:27:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Strotz (1955), Akerlof (1991) and ODonoghue and Rabin (1999a, 1999b) propose that decision
25:850:60783:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:makers with dynamically inconsistent preferences make current choices under the naive belief
25:851:60877:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that later selves will act in the interests of the current self.  Angeletos et al. (2001) nd that
25:852:60975:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:naive and sophisticated quasi-hyperbolic agents behave similarly in consumption models like the
25:853:61070:20:20:72:203:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:one discussed in this paper.
25:854:61098:20:21:89:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:However, two puzzles remain that perhaps a model of naivete could address. First, the sophis-
25:855:61191:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ticated quasi-hyperbolics in these simulations would be better o¤ if they had no access to credit
25:856:61288:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cards.  Specically, according to a comparison of value functions, at age 20, sophisticated quasi-
25:857:61386:20:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f4:B:hyperbolics would be willing to pay $2000 to get rid of their credit cards immediately andnever
25:858:61481:21:20:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:have access to them in the future. This begs the question of why only a tiny fraction of consumers
25:859:61579:20:20:72:191:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cut up their credit cards.
25:860:61605:20:0:89:542:99:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Second, the spread between the cost of funds and the credit card interest rate is too high. 
26:861:61701:0:20:72:540:683:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:As Ausubel (1991) has pointed out, the spread cannot be accounted for by standard explanations
26:862:61795:20:20:72:540:663:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:like default probabilities; instead consumers seem to pick their credit card under the naive belief
26:863:61894:20:21:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that they will not borrow in the future. Teaser rates may also be explained by a model of naive
26:864:61989:21:36:72:341:622:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:quasi-hyperbolic discounting (Shui and Ausubel 2004).39

26:866:62100:27:20:72:540:559:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Standard models study the one-parameter exponential discount function, and we have explored a
26:867:62193:20:21:72:540:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:two-parameter generalization. We may nd that richer representations better describe discounting
26:868:62289:21:20:72:538:518:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:patterns. It is also possible that the nature of discounting changes over the course of the lifecycle,40
26:869:62393:20:20:72:540:498:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:providing another possible framework for explaining patterns of wealth accumulation and credit
26:870:62487:20:36:72:147:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:card borrowing.
26:871:62502:36:28:72:185:442:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:6.3  Heterogeneity
26:872:62520:28:20:72:540:414:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Another important direction for future work is to relax the assumption of homogeneous preferences.
26:873:62618:20:20:72:540:394:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Specically, one might wonder whether two groups of exponential consumers, one patient and the
26:874:62712:20:21:72:540:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:other impatient, could account for the facts.  To us, the data suggest that there is substantial
26:875:62808:21:20:72:540:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:heterogeneity in the population, but that the heterogeneity does not explain why the median
26:876:62899:20:20:72:539:333:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:householdboth borrows on its credit cardsand invests in illiquid assets. Laibson et al. (2003) nd
26:877:62997:20:21:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that credit card borrowing is pervasive across the entire wealth distribution. Nevertheless, a model
26:878:63097:21:20:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with heterogeneous preferences may resolve some of the empirical tensions discussed in this paper.
26:879:63195:20:20:89:540:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Interest rate heterogeneity might also explain the lifecycle wealth accumulation and credit card
26:880:63291:20:21:72:540:252:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:borrowing facts. A model of exponential consumers facing sharply di¤erent interest rates could
26:881:63385:21:20:72:540:231:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:simultaneously match the frequencies of credit card borrowing and the levels of midlife wealth

26:883:63578:20:20:72:540:191:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Households surveyed in the 1998 Survey of Consumer Finances were asked about the interest rate
26:884:63672:20:21:72:540:171:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:they paid on their credit cards. Households in the top quartile of the distribution of wealth reported
26:885:63774:21:26:72:540:150:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:an average nominal rate of 13.27%, whereas households in the lowest quartile of wealth reported an

26:887:63948:11:14:80:539:113:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:40Our assumption that marginal utility varies with demographics (and thus with age) is a special case of the general
26:888:64064:14:0:72:475:99:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:class of age-specic discounting studied by Attanasio and Weber (1995) and Attanasio et al. (1999).
27:889:64165:0:20:72:540:683:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:average of 13.59%.41Hence, households with substantial wealth do not face low credit card interest
27:890:64263:20:36:72:462:663:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rates  e.g. teaser rates  that could explain their frequent credit card borrowing.
27:891:64347:36:27:72:252:627:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:6.4  Institutional assumptions
27:892:64377:27:21:72:540:600:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The assets in the model are stylized and it would be natural to make our institutional assumptions
27:893:64475:21:20:72:540:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:more realistic.  In a richer model households would be able to declare bankruptcy, default on their
27:894:64574:20:20:72:539:559:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:credit card debt, sell theirZassets, borrow against theirZassets, and engage in many other types
27:895:64670:20:21:72:540:539:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:B:of nancial transactions.  We are most interested in exploring changes in assumptions aboutZ;
27:896:64763:21:20:72:539:518:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:since theZasset plays a central role in driving our results.  For example, if theZasset were
27:897:64855:20:20:72:540:498:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:perfectly liquid our model would be unable to explain credit card borrowing (since consumers
27:898:64947:20:21:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with liquid retirement assets would spend down these liquid assets rather than borrowing on a
27:899:65040:21:20:72:539:457:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:high-interest credit card).  Hence, the illiquidity ofZis critical for the predictive power of the
27:900:65138:20:20:72:540:437:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:model.  Illiquidity ofZalso mimics the optimal mechanisms that have recently been derived for
27:901:65231:20:20:72:310:417:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:quasi-hyperbolic consumers (Amador et al. 2004).
27:902:65279:20:21:89:539:397:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Other work has explored the consequences of makingZless illiquid (i.e., by introducing a
27:903:65367:21:20:72:539:376:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:transaction cost for liquidatingZ).42This does not change the models qualitative predictions.
27:904:65461:20:20:72:540:356:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:However, such transaction cost models may be too crude to capture the implications of collateralized
27:905:65561:20:21:72:539:336:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:borrowing againstZ.  For example, home equity lines of credit are rapidly gaining popularity in
27:906:65656:21:20:72:540:315:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the U.S. and such instruments make heretofore illiquid home equity relatively easy to access.  If
27:907:65753:20:20:72:540:295:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:home equity lines of credit provide immediate liquidity with little or no transactions costs, then
27:908:65851:20:21:72:539:275:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:B:Zis really not an illiquid asset.  However, if applying for a home equity line of credit generates
27:909:65949:21:20:72:540:254:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:immediate e¤ort costs as well as bureaucratic delays, then quasi-hyperbolic consumers will prefer
27:910:66046:20:20:72:463:234:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to use their credit cards rather than applying for such credit lines (Laibson 1997).
27:911:66130:20:21:89:540:214:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:To explore these issues, researchers should develop high frequency models in which the units of
27:912:66225:21:20:72:539:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:time are days and not years (and\fmultiplies all utility ows starting tomorrow).  In such models
27:913:66322:20:20:72:540:173:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the nature of the e¤ort costs and the bureaucratic delays will play an important role. For example,
27:914:66421:20:26:72:540:153:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:if an application for a home equity credit line yields immediate e¤ort costs and only delayed liquidity
27:915:66524:26:11:80:494:127:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:?:41The means refer to high school educated households with outstanding balances on their credit cards.
27:916:66625:11:15:80:539:116:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:42Laibson et al. (2003) report simulations in which liquidating part of the illiquid asset generates a xed cost of
27:917:66740:15:0:72:233:101:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:$10,000 and a proportional cost of 10%.
28:918:66781:0:20:72:539:683:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(say in a week), such credit maynotbe tempting to quasi-hyperbolic consumers.  However, if a
28:919:66873:20:20:72:540:663:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:home equity application has vanishingly small e¤ort costs and yields immediate liquidity, then
28:920:66967:20:21:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:such a loan will be appealing to quasi-hyperbolic consumers and the model will then predict that
28:921:67063:21:20:72:289:622:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:splurges willnotbe funded from credit cards.
28:922:67107:20:20:89:540:602:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Such high frequency models are beyond the scope of the current paper.   As home equity
28:923:67193:20:20:72:540:582:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:lines of credit and other technologies for making illiquid assets liquid become increasingly popular
28:924:67293:20:21:72:540:562:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(only 7.8% of homeowners in the 1998 SCF had such loans), it will become more important for
28:925:67384:21:20:72:540:541:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:economists to study the micro-structure and micro-timing of the loan application process. Though
28:926:67480:20:20:72:540:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the parameters of this papers model are identied o¤ data from a time period when home equity
28:927:67574:20:21:72:540:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:was more illiquid than today, if consumers sharply devalue rewards that are delayed by only a few
28:928:67671:21:36:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:days, models of the credit application process will need to reect these high frequency preferences.
28:929:67771:36:27:72:223:444:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:6.5  Consumption shocks
28:930:67794:27:20:72:540:417:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In addition to income uncertainty, consumers also face stochastic shocks to preferences and con-
28:931:67890:20:21:72:540:397:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sumption needs (Amador et al. 2004). Expenses for car repairs and health care, for example, often
28:932:67987:21:20:72:540:376:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:come unexpectedly.  In principle this additional volatility could generate higher levels of (illiquid)
28:933:68089:20:20:72:540:356:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:wealth accumulation and credit card borrowing by promoting saving after unusually good shocks
28:934:68182:20:21:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and borrowing after unusually bad shocks.  We examine this possibility qualitatively by proxying
28:935:68278:21:20:72:539:315:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for consumption shocks with increased income uncertainty. Specically, we re-estimate\fand-af-
28:936:68372:20:20:72:539:295:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ter doubling the variances of the parameters of our calibrated income process.43This yields results
28:937:68471:20:21:72:540:275:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:very similar to the benchmark run discussed above:  the estimate of\f, 0.62, is signicantly less
28:938:68568:21:20:72:540:254:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:than 1; the specication test on the quasi-hyperbolic model is borderline; and the specication test
28:939:68668:20:20:72:539:234:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on the exponential model, when\fis restricted to equal 1, is rejected. Though these results support
28:940:68767:20:21:72:540:214:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the intuition that volatility can not explain why the same time-consistent consumers would both
28:941:68862:21:20:72:540:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:accumulate illiquid assets and borrow on credit cards, subsequent analyses might formally calibrate
28:942:68961:20:26:72:422:173:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and incorporate stochastic shocks to the marginal utility of consumption.
28:943:69034:26:15:80:539:147:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:43We consider this a plausible upper bound, as it increases theconditional and unconditional standard deviations
28:944:69146:15:10:72:539:132:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:of income by about 50%.  Hubbard, Skinner and Zeldes (1995) and Palumbo (1999) estimate dynamic processes of
28:945:69254:10:11:72:539:122:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:health expenditures, nding conditional and unconditional standard deviations equivalent to roughly one-third and
28:946:69367:11:11:72:539:111:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:one-fth, respectively, of the conditional and unconditional standard deviations in income that we document in the

29:949:69517:27:20:72:540:656:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:As is well known from GMM theory, the choice of moments can be crucial to the outcome of the
29:950:69609:20:21:72:539:636:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:analysis. We chose to focus on the four moments discussed above:%visa; mean visa; CY; wealth.
29:951:69702:21:20:72:540:615:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We could have matched other moments, including the wealth-to-income ratio at agesotherthan
29:952:69792:20:20:72:540:595:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the pre-retirement age that we study; or the consumption-to-income ratio at various points in the
29:953:69889:20:20:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:lifecycle; or the proportion of homeowners; or the fraction of wealth that is illiquid; and so on.
29:954:69987:20:21:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f2:B:Ifour model is correctly specied, analyzing di¤erent moments should not change our estimated
29:955:70080:21:20:72:540:534:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:parameter values.   Hence, analyzing di¤erent moments is a potential test of our model and a
29:956:70172:20:20:72:202:514:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:priority for future research.
29:957:70201:20:21:89:540:494:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Data on synthetic cohort consumption proles are used by Gourinchas and Parker (2002) to
29:958:70289:21:20:72:540:473:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimate a long-term discount factor of 0.949 (0.015) for their high-school-graduate group.  We
29:959:70384:20:20:72:540:453:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:believe that low-frequency lifecycle dynamics for average consumption are a good way to identify
29:960:70480:20:21:72:540:433:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:long-run discount rates. Wealth accumulation provides an alternative strategy to identify long-run
29:961:70578:21:20:72:540:412:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:discount rates. These di¤erent estimation strategies are likely to produce similar results, since the
29:962:70679:20:20:72:540:392:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:wealth-based strategy we adopt generates simulations that exhibit the hump-shaped consumption

29:964:70869:21:20:72:540:351:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sets of moments in a single estimation exercise.  The calibrated quasi-hyperbolic model predicts a

29:970:71354:20:21:72:540:230:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:explain several puzzles involving consumption during retirement, including the measured pattern

32:1031:76316:20:20:72:234:602:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:moments were estimated usingbxi.
32:1032:76348:20:20:89:539:582:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Forwealth, we restrict the sample to households with heads between ages 50-59. We include all
32:1033:76441:20:21:72:540:562:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:real and nancial wealth (e.g., home equity and CDs) as well as all claims on dened contribution
32:1034:76538:21:20:72:540:541:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:pension plans (e.g., 401(k)).  The measure does not include Social Security wealth and claims

32:1037:76823:21:20:72:540:480:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:we set home equity equal to the max of 0 and the value of home minus outstanding mortgages

32:1047:77246:20:21:72:540:379:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:population weights.  We use this arctan scaling in order to downweight outliers.  This function
32:1048:77341:21:20:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:has noteworthy properties.  First, it is symmetric around the origin.  Second, it is approximately

32:1060:77977:21:20:72:540:216:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:probabilities we use in the simulations.  The standard error is computed directly from the weights
32:1061:78075:20:20:72:328:196:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and the standard errors on the age dummy estimates.
32:1062:78126:20:21:89:539:176:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Construction ofmean V isais complicated by the fact that aggregate credit card borrowing
32:1063:78214:21:29:72:540:155:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:data from the Fed indicate that 1995 and 1998 SCF borrowing magnitudes are biased downward
32:1064:78304:29:7:72:263:126:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:to Table 3 and Laibson et al. (2003) for details.
32:1065:78353:7:15:80:539:119:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:48In the 1983 SCF,1:7%of homeowners with a high school degree reported having a credit line secured by home
32:1066:78460:15:0:72:99:104:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:equity.
33:1067:78469:0:20:72:540:683:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:by a factor of three.  We correct for this bias as follows.  First we compute average outstanding
33:1068:78566:20:20:72:540:663:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:interest-bearing balances. According to the Fed, aggregate debt outstanding at year-end 1995 and
33:1069:78662:20:21:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:1998 were $443 billion and $561 billion, respectively.  From these gures we subtract an upper
33:1070:78756:21:20:72:540:622:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:bound on the oat (the balances that are still in their one-month grace period, which do not accrue
33:1071:78855:20:20:72:540:602:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:interest).  This upper bound is obtained by dividing total purchase volume, approximately $1
33:1072:78947:20:20:72:540:582:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:trillion in 1998, by 12.  We then divide by the number of U.S. households with credit cards, using
33:1073:79045:20:21:72:540:562:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Census Bureau data on total households and SCF data on the percentage of households with cards.
33:1074:79140:21:20:72:540:541:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We obtain average household borrowing conditional on having a card of $5115 in 1995 and $6411
33:1075:79233:20:20:72:540:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in 1998. These gures are consistent with those from a proprietary account-level data set analyzed
33:1076:79331:20:21:72:253:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:by Gross and Souleles (2002a, 2002b).

34:1095:80804:27:20:72:539:656:11:g_d0_f20:11:g_d0_f20:F:We use PSID data from 1978 to 1992 to estimate theCYmoment.   In the data, we dene
34:1096:80887:20:21:72:540:636:11:g_d0_f20:11:g_d0_f20:F:consumption to include food, rent, and utilities (the most general denition available in the PSID).
34:1097:80987:21:20:72:540:615:11:g_d0_f20:11:g_d0_f20:F:The rental value of an owner-occupied home is assumed to be 5% of the value of the home.  If
34:1098:81079:20:20:72:540:595:11:g_d0_f20:11:g_d0_f20:F:the household neither owns nor rents, rent is the self-reported rental value of the home if it were
34:1099:81178:20:20:72:105:575:11:g_d0_f20:11:g_d0_f20:C:rented.

34:1107:81744:20:21:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f20:11:g_d0_f20:F:in the other years we estimate wealth using the intertemporal budget constraint and a projected
34:1108:81839:21:20:72:540:359:11:g_d0_f20:11:g_d0_f20:F:value of total consumption.  Total consumption was projected from the PSIDs partial measure
34:1109:81931:20:20:72:540:339:11:g_d0_f20:11:g_d0_f20:F:using the CEX: in the CEX we regress total consumption on food, rent and utilities consumption,
34:1110:82026:20:44:72:516:319:11:g_d0_f20:11:g_d0_f20:C:and then we use the coe¢cients to infer total consumption from the available PSID measure.

34:1114:82331:26:15:80:539:198:6:g_d0_f20:9:g_d0_f20:F:50Unfortunately, the PSID contains limited information on consumption. Our CY measure may be sensitive to
34:1115:82436:15:11:72:539:183:9:g_d0_f20:9:g_d0_f20:F:the denition of consumption. Using the Consumer Expenditure Survey, Dynarski and Gruber (1997) report a lower
34:1116:82546:11:11:72:539:172:9:g_d0_f20:9:g_d0_f20:F:sensitivity of food and housing expenditures than of total consumption to changes in the earnings of the head of
34:1117:82658:11:11:72:539:161:9:g_d0_f20:9:g_d0_f20:F:the household.  Hence, the comovement moment that we use in our analysis is biased down, which implies that our
34:1118:82769:11:11:72:539:150:9:g_d0_f20:9:g_d0_f20:F:estimate of\fis probably (slightly) biased up, since low\fvalues generate more comovement. We conjecture that this
34:1119:82883:11:11:72:540:139:9:g_d0_f20:9:g_d0_f20:F:bias in\fis slight because the comovement moment has a minimal impacton our estimates due to the high standard
34:1120:82993:11:7:72:253:128:9:g_d0_f20:9:g_d0_f20:F:errors that are associated with that moment.
