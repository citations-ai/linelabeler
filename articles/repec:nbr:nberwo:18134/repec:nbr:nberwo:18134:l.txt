2:27:1305:28:28:273:338:602:12:Times:12:Times:F:ABSTRACT
2:28:1313:28:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:From 2000 to 2010, more than 20 states passed laws that make it easier to use lethal force in self-defense.
2:29:1420:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F: Elements of these laws include removing the duty to retreat in places outside of one’s home, adding
2:30:1520:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:a presumption of reasonable belief of imminent harm, and removing civil liability for those acting
2:31:1618:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:under the law.  This paper examines whether aiding self-defense in this way deters crime or, alternatively,
2:32:1725:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:increases homicide.  To do so, we apply a difference-in-differences research design by exploiting the
2:33:1826:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:within-state variation in law adoption.  We find no evidence of deterrence; burglary, robbery, and
2:34:1924:14:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:aggravated assault are unaffected by the laws.  On the other hand, we find that homicides are increased
2:35:2027:14:14:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:by around 8 percent, and that these homicides are largely classified by police as murder.  This suggests
2:36:2131:14:14:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:that a primary consequence of strengthened self-defense law is a net increase in homicide.  Finally,
2:37:2231:14:14:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:we present back-of-the-envelope calculations using evidence on the relative increase in reported justifiable
2:38:2339:14:14:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:homicide, along with assumptions about the degree and nature of underreporting, to assess whether
2:39:2436:14:42:72:262:420:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:the entire increase was legally justified.

3:54:2732:0:29:85:166:705:127:Times:127:Times:B:1. Introduction 
3:55:2747:29:30:125:507:676:127:Times:127:Times:A:A  long-standing  principle  of  English  common  law,  from  which  most  of  U.S.  
3:56:2832:30:29:85:505:646:127:Times:127:Times:B:self-defense  law  is  derived,  is  that  one  has  a  “duty  to  retreat”  before  using  lethal  force  
3:57:2939:29:29:85:506:617:127:Times:127:Times:B:against  an  assailant.    The  exception  to  this  principle  is  when  one  is  threatened  by  an  
3:58:3042:29:30:85:504:588:127:Times:127:Times:B:intruder  in  one’s  own  home,  as  the  home  is  one’s  “castle”.      In  2005,  Florida  became  the  
3:59:3149:30:29:85:504:558:127:Times:127:Times:B:first in a recent wave of states to extend castle doctrine to places outside the home, and to 
3:60:3243:29:29:85:506:529:127:Times:127:Times:B:expand  self-defense  protections  in  other  ways.    Since  then,  more  than  20  states  have  
3:61:3342:29:30:85:503:500:127:Times:127:Times:B:followed in strengthening their self-defense laws by passing versions of “castle doctrine” or 
3:62:3436:30:29:85:506:470:127:Times:127:Times:B:“stand-your-ground”  laws.    While  the  specific  components  vary  across  states,  the  laws  
3:63:3534:29:29:85:504:441:127:Times:127:Times:B:eliminate the duty to retreat from a list of specified places, and often remove civil liability 
3:64:3630:29:30:86:506:412:127:Times:127:Times:B:for  those  acting  under  the  law  and  establish  a  presumption  of  reasonableness  as  to  the  
3:65:3732:30:29:86:506:382:127:Times:127:Times:B:beliefs  and  actions  of  the  individual  claiming  self-defense.      For  ease  of  exposition,  we  
3:66:3837:29:30:86:357:353:127:Times:127:Times:B:subsequently refer to these laws as castle doctrine laws.       
3:67:3901:30:29:125:506:323:127:Times:127:Times:A:These  laws  alter  incentives  in  two  important  ways.    First,  the  laws  reduce  the  
3:68:3994:29:29:86:507:294:127:Times:127:Times:B:expected  cost  of  using  lethal  force.    Castle  doctrine  lowers  the  expected  legal  costs  
3:69:4094:29:30:86:505:265:127:Times:127:Times:B:associated  with  defending  oneself  against  criminal  and  civil  prosecution,  as  well  as  the  
3:70:4196:30:29:86:505:235:127:Times:127:Times:B:probability  that  one  is  ultimately  found  criminally  or  civilly  liable  for  the  death  or  injury  
3:71:4305:29:29:86:505:206:127:Times:127:Times:B:inflicted.    In addition, the laws increase the expected cost of committing violent crime, as 
3:72:4400:29:30:86:505:177:127:Times:127:Times:B:victims  are  more  likely  to  respond  by  using  lethal  force.      The  purpose  of  our  paper  is  to  
3:73:4510:30:29:86:505:147:127:Times:127:Times:B:examine empirically whether people respond to these incentives, and thus whether the laws 
3:74:4600:29:29:86:430:118:127:Times:127:Times:B:lead to an increase in homicide, or to deterrence of crime more generally.     
3:75:4679:29:0:125:512:89:127:Times:127:Times:A:In  doing  so,  our  paper  also  informs  a  vigorous  policy  debate  over  these  laws.    
4:76:4776:0:29:85:506:705:127:Times:127:Times:B:Proponents  argue  these  statutes  provide  law-abiding  citizens  with  additional  necessary  
4:77:4873:29:30:85:505:676:127:Times:127:Times:B:protections  from  civil  and  criminal  liability.    They  argue  that  since  the  decision  to  use  
4:78:4978:30:29:85:506:646:127:Times:127:Times:B:lethal  force  is  a  split-second  one  that  is  made  under  significant  stress,  the  threatened  
4:79:5081:29:29:85:503:617:127:Times:127:Times:B:individual should be given additional legal leeway.    Critics argue that existing self-defense 
4:80:5177:29:30:85:509:588:127:Times:127:Times:B:law   is   sufficient   to   protect   law-abiding   citizens,   and   extending   their   scope   will   
4:81:5283:30:29:85:506:558:127:Times:127:Times:B:unnecessarily  escalate  violence.    These  potential  consequences  have  been  of  particular  
4:82:5381:29:29:85:506:529:127:Times:127:Times:B:interest  recently  following  some  highly  publicized  cases.1    In  examining  the  empirical  
4:83:5480:29:30:85:503:500:127:Times:127:Times:B:consequences of these laws, this study informs the debate over their costs and benefits.         
4:84:5577:30:29:125:505:470:127:Times:127:Times:A:    We use state-level crime data from 2000 to 2010 from the FBI Uniform Crime 
4:85:5656:29:29:85:511:441:127:Times:127:Times:B:Reports  to  empirically  analyze  the  effects  of  castle  doctrine  on  two  types  of  outcomes.    
4:86:5760:29:30:85:507:412:127:Times:127:Times:B:First,  we  examine  whether  these  laws  deter  crimes  such  as  burglary,  robbery,  and  
4:87:5854:30:29:85:504:382:127:Times:127:Times:B:aggravated  assault.      In  doing  so,  we  join  a  much  larger  literature  on  criminal  deterrence  
4:88:5961:29:30:85:503:353:127:Times:127:Times:B:generally (e.g., Becker, 1968; Ehrlich, 1973; Di Tella and Schargrodsky, 2004; Donohue and 
4:89:6052:30:29:85:506:323:127:Times:127:Times:B:Wolfers,  2009).    More  specifically,  however,  we  join  a  smaller  literature  focused  on  
4:90:6150:29:29:85:505:294:127:Times:127:Times:B:whether  unobserved  victim  precaution  can  deter  crime.      For  example,  Ayres  and  Levitt  
4:91:6250:29:30:85:505:265:127:Times:127:Times:B:(1998)  examine  whether  LoJack  reduces  overall  motor  vehicle  thefts,  while  others  have  
4:92:6348:30:29:85:507:235:127:Times:127:Times:B:examined  whether  laws  that  make  it  easier  to  carry  concealed  weapons  deter  crime  
4:93:6442:29:29:85:504:206:127:Times:127:Times:B:(Bronars and Lott, 1998; Dezhbakhsh and Rubin, 1998; Lott  and  Mustard,  1997;  Ludwig, 
4:94:6531:29:29:85:135:177:127:Times:127:Times:B:1998).2   
4:95:6541:29:7:85:223:148:98:g_d0_f3:98:g_d0_f3:F:                                                               
4:96:6604:7:13:85:503:141:32:Times:72:Times:F:1  The most publicized case is that of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed teenager who was shot and killed by a neighborhood 
4:97:6721:13:10:85:88:128:72:Times:32:Times:F:watch volunteer (Alvarez, 2012).     2
4:98:6759:10:10:88:503:118:72:Times:72:Times:F:  Our view is that relative to shall-issue concealed carry laws, the potential for castle doctrine law to deter crimes is quite 
4:99:6887:10:10:85:503:108:72:Times:72:Times:F:large.    For example, in Texas only 1.5 percent of adults age 18 and older have a concealed carry permit, and presumably 
4:100:7009:10:9:85:503:98:72:Times:72:Times:F:only  a  fraction  of  those  carry  a  gun  on  a  regular  basis  (Texas  Department  of  Public  Safety,  2006;  Texas  Department  of  
4:101:7148:9:10:85:503:89:72:Times:72:Times:F:State  Health  Services,  2006;  and  author’s  calculations).      In  contrast,  Gallup  polls  indicate  that  from  2000  to  2009,  44  
4:102:7289:10:10:85:505:79:72:Times:72:Times:F:percent of households own a gun that could be used in self-defense against a burglar or assailant (Saad, 2011).    Moreover, 
4:103:7414:10:0:85:379:69:72:Times:72:Times:F:strengthened self-defense laws lower the cost of using a concealed carry weapon.         
5:104:7506:0:29:105:504:705:127:Times:127:Times:A:  We  then  examine  whether  lowering  the  expected  cost  of  using  lethal  force  results  
5:105:7602:29:30:85:510:676:127:Times:127:Times:B:in an increase in homicide, defined as the sum of murder and non-negligent manslaughter.   
5:106:7693:30:29:85:504:646:127:Times:127:Times:B:We  also  examine  the  effects  of  the  laws  on  other  outcomes  in  order  to  shed  light  on  why 
5:107:7797:29:29:85:270:617:127:Times:127:Times:B:homicides are affected by the laws.         
5:108:7841:29:30:125:506:588:127:Times:127:Times:A:To  distinguish  the  effect  of  the  laws  from  confounding  factors,  we  exploit  the  
5:109:7933:30:29:85:509:558:127:Times:127:Times:B:within-state   variation   in   the   adoption   of   laws   to   apply   a   difference-in-differences   
5:110:8039:29:29:85:505:529:127:Times:127:Times:B:identification  strategy.      Intuitively,  we  compare  the  within-state  changes  in  outcomes  of  
5:111:8143:29:30:85:505:500:127:Times:127:Times:B:states  that  adopted  laws  to  the  within-state  changes  in  non-adopting  states  over  the  same  
5:112:8247:30:29:85:506:470:127:Times:127:Times:B:time  period.    Moreover,  we  primarily  identify  effects  by  comparing  changes  in  castle  
5:113:8345:29:29:85:506:441:127:Times:127:Times:B:doctrine  states  to  other  states  in  the  same  region  of  the  country  by  including  Census  
5:114:8446:29:30:85:507:412:127:Times:127:Times:B:region-by-year  fixed  effects.    Thus,  the  crucial  identifying  assumption  is  that  in  the  
5:115:8546:30:29:85:505:382:127:Times:127:Times:B:absence  of  the  castle  doctrine  laws,  adopting  states  would  have  experienced  changes  in  
5:116:8646:29:30:85:504:353:127:Times:127:Times:B:crime similar to non-adopting states in the same region of the country.    Our data allow us 
5:117:8739:30:29:85:507:323:127:Times:127:Times:B:to  test  and  relax  this  assumption  in  several  ways.    First,  we  empirically  test  whether  
5:118:8841:29:29:86:504:294:127:Times:127:Times:B:outcomes in the two groups of states diverge in the year prior to adoption.    In addition, we 
5:119:8936:29:30:86:507:265:127:Times:127:Times:B:show  that  our  findings  are  robust  to  the  inclusion  of  time-varying  covariates  such  as  
5:120:9036:30:29:86:506:235:127:Times:127:Times:B:demographics,  policing,  economic  conditions,  and  public  assistance,  as  well  as  to  the  
5:121:9134:29:29:86:504:206:127:Times:127:Times:B:inclusion of contemporaneous crime levels unaffected by castle doctrine laws that proxy for 
5:122:9226:29:30:86:505:177:127:Times:127:Times:B:general  crime  trends.      Along  similar  lines,  we  offer  placebo  tests  by  showing  that  castle  
5:123:9333:30:29:86:505:147:127:Times:127:Times:B:doctrine  laws  do  not  affect  crimes  that  ought  not  be  deterred  by  the  laws,  such  as  vehicle  
5:124:9441:29:29:86:506:118:127:Times:127:Times:B:theft  and  larceny.    Failing  to  find  effects  provides  further  evidence  that  general  crime  
5:125:9544:29:0:86:509:89:127:Times:127:Times:B:trends   were   similar   in   adopting   and   non-adopting   states.      Finally,   we   allow   for   
6:126:9653:0:29:85:243:705:127:Times:127:Times:B:state-specific linear time trends.     
6:127:9692:29:30:85:505:676:127:Times:127:Times:B:    Results  indicate  that  the  prospect  of  facing  additional  self-defense  does  not  deter  
6:128:9792:30:29:85:505:646:127:Times:127:Times:B:crime.     Specifically,  we  find  no  evidence  of  deterrence  effects  on  burglary,  robbery,  or  
6:129:9896:29:29:85:507:617:127:Times:127:Times:B:aggravated  assault.    Moreover,  our  estimates  are  sufficiently  precise  as  to  rule  out  
6:130:9994:29:30:85:236:588:127:Times:127:Times:B:meaningful deterrence effects.     
6:131:10029:30:29:85:511:558:127:Times:127:Times:B:    In  contrast,  we  find  significant  evidence  that  the  laws  lead  to  more  homicides.    
6:132:10128:29:29:85:505:529:127:Times:127:Times:B:Estimates  indicate  that  the  laws  increase  homicides by a statistically significant 8 percent, 
6:133:10228:29:30:85:504:500:127:Times:127:Times:B:which translates into an additional 600 homicides per year across states that adopted castle 
6:134:10321:30:29:85:505:470:127:Times:127:Times:B:doctrine.    The  magnitude  of  this  finding  is  similar  to  that  reported  in  a  new  paper  by  
6:135:10425:29:29:85:504:441:127:Times:127:Times:B:McClellan  and  Tekin  (2012),  who  examine  these  laws’  effect  on  firearm-related  homicide  
6:136:10524:29:30:85:504:412:127:Times:127:Times:B:using death certificate data from Vital Statistics.3,4    We further show that this divergence in 
6:137:10622:30:29:85:506:382:127:Times:127:Times:B:homicide  rates  at  the  time  of  castle  doctrine  enactment  is  larger  than  any  divergence  
6:138:10722:29:30:85:504:353:127:Times:127:Times:B:between the same groups of states at any time in the last 40 years, and that magnitudes of 
6:139:10813:30:29:85:511:323:127:Times:127:Times:B:this    size    arise    rarely    by    chance    when    randomly    assigning    placebo    laws    in    
6:140:10922:29:29:85:504:294:127:Times:127:Times:B:similarly-structured data sets covering the years prior to castle doctrine.    In short, we find 
6:141:11019:29:30:85:504:265:127:Times:127:Times:B:compelling evidence that by lowering the expected costs associated with using lethal force, 
6:142:11111:30:29:85:271:235:127:Times:127:Times:B:castle doctrine laws induce more of it.     
6:143:11155:29:39:85:504:206:127:Times:127:Times:B:  This increase in homicides could be due either to the increased use of lethal force 
6:144:11239:39:10:85:88:167:98:g_d0_f3:32:Times:F:                                                               3
6:145:11303:10:10:88:495:157:72:Times:72:Times:F:  One advantage of using FBI UCR data is that it allows us to assess both how the laws affect the use of lethal force and 
6:146:11425:10:10:85:488:147:72:Times:72:Times:F:whether they deter violent crime.    In addition, the nature of the UCR data enables us to measure all homicides, rather 
6:147:11546:10:9:85:494:137:72:Times:72:Times:F:than just those caused by firearms.    The data also allow us to examine homicide subclassifications and relative changes 
6:148:11668:9:10:85:499:128:72:Times:72:Times:F:in reported justifiable homicide from the SHR, along with assumptions about the degree of underreporting, to address the 
6:149:11789:10:10:85:487:118:72:Times:72:Times:F:issue of whether the additional homicides are legally justified.    This is not possible using data originating from death 
6:150:11912:10:10:85:486:108:72:Times:72:Times:F:certificates.    The primary disadvantage of the UCR homicide data is that while the annual state-level data we use are 
6:151:12032:10:9:85:475:98:72:Times:72:Times:F:regarded as accurate and there is no reason to believe that any total homicide reporting issue at any level should be 
6:152:12150:9:10:85:88:89:72:Times:32:Times:F:systematically correlated with changes in castle doctrine law, the monthly data from Vital Statistics are more complete.       4
6:153:12278:10:10:88:474:79:72:Times:72:Times:F:  Our findings contrast with those of Lott (2010) in More Guns, Less Crime, who reports that castle doctrine laws 
6:154:12392:10:0:85:349:69:72:Times:72:Times:F:adopted from 1977 through 2005 reduced murder rates and violent crime.       
7:155:12472:0:29:85:505:705:127:Times:127:Times:B:in  self-defense  situations  that  are  classified  by  police  as  murder,  or  to  the  escalation  of  
7:156:12579:29:30:85:506:676:127:Times:127:Times:B:violence  in  otherwise  non-lethal  conflicts.  In  an  attempt  to  shed  light  on  whether  the  
7:157:12680:30:29:85:507:646:127:Times:127:Times:B:increase  is  driven  entirely  by  legally  justified  homicide,  we  look  at  two  things.    For  
7:158:12782:29:29:85:503:617:127:Times:127:Times:B:evidence of escalation by criminals, we look at whether criminals are more likely to carry a 
7:159:12875:29:30:85:507:588:127:Times:127:Times:B:gun  while  committing  robbery,  and  whether  there  is  an  increase  in  felony-type  and  
7:160:12970:30:29:85:504:558:127:Times:127:Times:B:suspected  felony-type  murder,  in  which  a  murder  is  committed  during  the  commission  of  
7:161:13069:29:29:85:505:529:127:Times:127:Times:B:another  felony.      There  is  little  robust  evidence  of  an  increase  in  criminals’  propensity  to  
7:162:13178:29:30:85:505:500:127:Times:127:Times:B:carry  a  weapon.      Estimated  effects  on  felony-type  and  suspected  felony-type  murder  are  
7:163:13280:30:29:85:304:470:127:Times:127:Times:B:positive and large, but imprecisely estimated.     
7:164:13331:29:29:85:506:441:127:Times:127:Times:B:    In  addition,  we  look  at  justifiable  homicide,  which  is  a  separate  classification  
7:165:13428:29:30:85:507:412:127:Times:127:Times:B:available  in  the  Supplemental  Homicide  Reports.    One  concern  with  these  data  is  
7:166:13521:30:29:85:503:382:127:Times:127:Times:B:underreporting; Kleck (1988) estimates that only one-fifth of legally justified homicides are 
7:167:13615:29:30:85:505:353:127:Times:127:Times:B:classified  that  way  by  police.    Nevertheless,  we  would  still  expect  relative  changes  in  
7:168:13717:30:29:85:505:323:127:Times:127:Times:B:reported  justifiable  homicides  before  and  after  the  laws  to  be  informative,  and  show  that  
7:169:13821:29:29:85:507:294:127:Times:127:Times:B:while  our  best  back-of-the-envelope  estimate  is  that  roughly  half  of  the  additional  
7:170:13917:29:30:85:505:265:127:Times:127:Times:B:homicides  caused  by  castle  doctrine  are  legally  justified,  stronger  assumptions  about  the  
7:171:14019:30:29:85:504:235:127:Times:127:Times:B:degree  of  underreporting  (e.g.,  one-tenth  compared  to  one-fifth)  can  lead  one  to  conclude  
7:172:14122:29:29:85:505:206:127:Times:127:Times:B:that  all  of  the  additional  homicides  caused  by  castle  doctrine  are  legally  justified.    We  
7:173:14227:29:30:85:504:177:127:Times:127:Times:B:emphasize that any conclusion depends on assumptions regarding the degree and nature of 
7:174:14315:30:29:85:326:147:127:Times:127:Times:B:underreporting of justifiable homicide by police.5   
7:175:14368:29:29:85:506:118:127:Times:127:Times:B:    Collectively,  these  findings  suggest  that  incentives  do  matter  in  one  important  
7:176:14463:29:10:85:88:89:98:g_d0_f3:32:Times:F:                                                               5
7:177:14527:10:10:88:494:79:72:Times:72:Times:F:  Of course, there is also the issue of whether all legally justified homicides under castle doctrine are socially desirable, 
7:178:14653:10:0:85:231:69:72:Times:72:Times:F:which is beyond the scope of this paper.     
8:179:14701:0:29:85:504:705:127:Times:127:Times:B:sense: lowering the threshold for the justified use of lethal force results in more of it.    On 
8:180:14798:29:30:85:504:676:127:Times:127:Times:B:the other hand, there is also a limit to the power of incentives, as criminals are apparently 
8:181:14892:30:29:85:448:646:127:Times:127:Times:B:not deterred by empowering victims to use lethal force to protect themselves.     
8:182:14974:29:29:125:505:617:127:Times:127:Times:A:These  findings  also  have  significant  policy  implications.      The  first  is  that  these  
8:183:15072:29:30:85:504:588:127:Times:127:Times:B:laws  do  not  appear  to  offer  any  hidden  spillover  benefits  to  society  at  large.      Rather,  the  
8:184:15183:30:29:85:504:558:127:Times:127:Times:B:evidence  indicates  that  the  benefits  of  strengthening  self-defense  laws  begin  and  end  with  
8:185:15287:29:29:85:504:529:127:Times:127:Times:B:the  added  protections  to  actual  victims  of  violent  crime.      On  the  other  hand,  the  primary  
8:186:15395:29:30:85:505:500:127:Times:127:Times:B:potential  downside  of  the  law  is  the  increased  number  of  homicides.      Thus,  our  view  is  
8:187:15500:30:29:85:505:470:127:Times:127:Times:B:that  any  evaluation  of  these  laws  ought  to  weigh  the  benefits  of  increased  self-defense  
8:188:15602:29:29:85:362:441:127:Times:127:Times:B:against the net increase in loss of life caused by the laws.

8:190:15669:30:29:85:287:382:127:Times:127:Times:B:2. Castle Doctrine Law and Identification 
8:191:15711:29:30:85:209:353:127:Times:127:Times:B:2.1    Castle  Doctrine  Law  
8:192:15741:30:29:125:505:323:127:Times:127:Times:A:U.S.  self-defense  law,  which  stems  from  English  common  law,  has  long  favored  
8:193:15830:29:29:85:504:294:127:Times:127:Times:B:the  principle  of  “retreat  to  the  wall”,  which  means  that  only  after  no  longer  being  able  to  
8:194:15939:29:30:85:516:265:127:Times:127:Times:B:retreat  safely  could  one  respond  to  an  attacker  with  deadly  force  (Vilos  and  Vilos,  2010).        
8:195:16051:30:29:85:504:235:127:Times:127:Times:B:The  exception  to  this  rule  is  if  the  attack  is  inside  one’s  home,  or  “castle”,  in  which  case  
8:196:16162:29:29:85:504:206:127:Times:127:Times:B:there is no longer a duty to retreat.    In 2005, a wave of states began removing the duty to 
8:197:16256:29:30:85:504:177:127:Times:127:Times:B:retreat from places outside the home, as well as strengthening self-defense laws in several 
8:198:16348:30:29:85:504:147:127:Times:127:Times:B:other ways.    For example, most laws added language that explicitly states individuals are 
8:199:16440:29:29:85:504:118:127:Times:127:Times:B:justified  in  using  deadly  force  in  certain  circumstances  when  they  reasonably  believe  that  
8:200:16544:29:0:85:505:89:127:Times:127:Times:B:they  face  a  serious  risk  of  imminent  death  or  serious  bodily  harm.    In  addition,  castle  
9:201:16651:0:29:85:504:705:127:Times:127:Times:B:doctrine  laws  removed  the  duty  to  retreat  in  a  list  of  special  places  such  as  one’s  vehicle,  
9:202:16761:29:30:85:505:676:127:Times:127:Times:B:place  of  work  and,  in  some  cases,  any  place  one  has  a  legal  right  to  be.      Additionally,  
9:203:16869:30:29:85:504:646:127:Times:127:Times:B:many of these laws also added a presumption of reasonable fear of imminent serious injury 
9:204:16959:29:29:85:507:617:127:Times:127:Times:B:or  death,  which  shifts  the  burden  of  proof  to  the  prosecutor  to  show  someone  acted  
9:205:17057:29:30:85:505:588:127:Times:127:Times:B:unreasonably.6      Similarly,  many  laws  also  grant  immunity  from  civil  liability  when  using  
9:206:17161:30:29:85:505:558:127:Times:127:Times:B:defensive  force  in  a  way  justified  under  law.      Collectively,  these  laws  lower  the  cost  of  
9:207:17269:29:29:85:505:529:127:Times:127:Times:B:using lethal force to protect oneself, though they also lower the cost of escalating violence 
9:208:17363:29:30:85:178:500:127:Times:127:Times:B:in other conflicts.     
9:209:17387:30:29:125:507:470:127:Times:127:Times:A:Our  understanding  is  that  the  main  rationale  for  these  laws  was  to  provide  
9:210:17475:29:29:85:510:441:127:Times:127:Times:B:additional  legal  leeway  to  potential  victims  in  self-defense  situations,  not  to  deter  crime.     
9:211:17584:29:30:85:504:412:127:Times:127:Times:B:Thus, there is little reason to believe that the enactment of these laws coincided with either 
9:212:17679:30:29:85:505:382:127:Times:127:Times:B:other  policies  expected  to  affect  crime  or  homicides,  or  with  expectations  about  future

9:214:17790:30:29:125:505:323:127:Times:127:Times:A:To  determine  if  and  when  states  passed  castle  doctrine  laws,  we  searched  news  
9:215:17881:29:29:85:504:294:127:Times:127:Times:B:releases and other sources such as the Institute for Legislative Action of the National Rifle 
9:216:17975:29:30:85:504:265:127:Times:127:Times:B:Association  to  determine  whether  a  state  appeared  to  have  passed  a  law  that  strengthened  
9:217:18078:30:29:85:504:235:127:Times:127:Times:B:self-defense  law  these  ways.      Specifically,  we  coded  the  specific  attributes  of  each  state  
9:218:18185:29:29:85:503:206:127:Times:127:Times:B:statute found, and classified whether the law i) removed the duty to retreat from somewhere 
9:219:18277:29:39:85:504:177:127:Times:127:Times:B:outside the home, ii) removed the duty to retreat from any place one has a legal right to be,

9:221:18434:7:13:85:504:131:32:Times:72:Times:F:6   For  example,  the  law  passed  in  Florida  states  that  “a  person  is  presumed  to  have  held  a  reasonable  fear  of  imminent  
9:222:18575:13:10:85:503:118:72:Times:72:Times:F:peril  of  death  or  bodily  injury  to  himself  or  herself  or  another  when  using  defensive  force  that  is  intended  or  likely  to  
9:223:18719:10:10:85:88:108:72:Times:32:Times:F:cause death or bodily injury to another.”       7
9:224:18768:10:9:88:503:98:72:Times:72:Times:F:  The National Rifle Association (NRA) was a major proponent of these laws (Goode, 2012).    We are unaware of any 
9:225:18883:9:10:85:503:89:72:Times:72:Times:F:statement by the NRA that suggests their support for the laws is due to a belief that the law will deter crime, or that the 
9:226:19007:10:10:85:503:79:72:Times:72:Times:F:law is a necessary response to recent changes in violent crime.    Rather, our understanding is that supporters view castle 
9:227:19131:10:0:85:277:69:72:Times:72:Times:F:doctrine as an issue of individual and victim rights.         
10:228:19196:0:29:85:506:705:127:Times:127:Times:B:iii)  added  a  presumption  of  reasonable  fear  for  the  person  using  lethal  force,  and  iv)  
10:229:19298:29:30:85:504:676:127:Times:127:Times:B:removed civil liability for those acting under the law.    We then classified a state as having 
10:230:19394:30:29:85:510:646:127:Times:127:Times:B:a  castle  doctrine  law  if  they  remove  the  duty  to  retreat  in  some  place  outside  the  home.     
10:231:19503:29:29:85:503:617:127:Times:127:Times:B:Our goal in doing so was to create a list of states that extended castle doctrine and generally 
10:232:19599:29:30:85:482:588:127:Times:127:Times:B:passed meaningful changes to their self-defense law that would be widely reported.8   
10:233:19685:30:29:125:504:558:127:Times:127:Times:A:Table 1 shows the list of states classified as those enacting castle doctrine between 
10:234:19771:29:29:85:505:529:127:Times:127:Times:B:2000  and  2010.      We  classify  21  states  as  having  passed  castle  doctrine  laws,  as  each  of  
10:235:19878:29:30:85:505:500:127:Times:127:Times:B:these  states  extended  the  castle  doctrine  to  places  outside  the  home.9      Of  these,  17  states  
10:236:19988:30:29:85:506:470:127:Times:127:Times:B:removed  the  duty  to  retreat  in  any  place  one  has  the  legal  right  to  be,  13  included  a  
10:237:20092:29:29:85:507:441:127:Times:127:Times:B:presumption  of  reasonable  fear,  and  18  explicitly  removed  civil  liability.    Our  main  
10:238:20190:29:30:85:504:412:127:Times:127:Times:B:analysis groups all of these laws together, and thus captures the average effect of passing a 
10:239:20284:30:29:85:505:382:127:Times:127:Times:B:law  similar  to  those  passed  in  these  21  states.      However,  since  that  approach  is  perhaps  
10:240:20391:29:30:85:505:353:127:Times:127:Times:B:unnecessarily  blunt,  in  appendix  Table  A1  we  show  results  from  different  subgroups  and  
10:241:20491:30:29:85:504:323:127:Times:127:Times:B:find that the results are largely similar to the average effects.    We note, however, that due 
10:242:20587:29:29:85:506:294:127:Times:127:Times:B:to  the  high  degree  of  collinearity  and  the  potential  for  interaction  effects,  distinguishing  
10:243:20693:29:30:85:417:265:127:Times:127:Times:B:between effects caused by different attributes of these laws is difficult.     
10:244:20772:30:29:85:88:235:127:Times:127:Times:B:

10:247:20835:7:13:85:499:170:32:Times:72:Times:F:8  We are aware of four states that passed laws removing civil liability that that made no other changes to self-defense law 
10:248:20960:13:10:85:483:157:72:Times:72:Times:F:over this time period, including Idaho (2006), Maryland (2010), Maine (2007), and Illinois (2004).    We do not code 
10:249:21077:10:10:85:501:147:72:Times:72:Times:F:those states as castle doctrine states.    We also do not classify Wyoming as having passed a castle doctrine law, though we 
10:250:21202:10:9:85:485:137:72:Times:72:Times:F:note that they removed civil liability and added a presumption of reasonable fear (provisions that removed the duty to 
10:251:21321:9:10:85:501:128:72:Times:72:Times:F:retreat were stripped out prior to passage) (Vilos and Vilos, 2010).    Finally, we note that in an earlier version of the paper 
10:252:21450:10:10:85:481:118:72:Times:72:Times:F:we defined these laws somewhat more broadly, and somehow missed that Oklahoma passed a castle doctrine law on 
10:253:21560:10:10:85:493:108:72:Times:72:Times:F:November 1st of 2006.    We thank McClellan and Tekin (2012) for helpful conversations about the specific attributes of 
10:254:21680:10:9:85:88:98:72:Times:32:Times:F:laws passed in different states.     9
10:255:21718:9:10:88:485:89:72:Times:72:Times:F:  To avoid confusion over which states are driving the within-state variation used in our study, we intentionally leave 
10:256:21838:10:10:85:496:79:72:Times:72:Times:F:states off Table 1 if they had passed a law that extended castle doctrine prior to 2000 or after 2010, which are outside our 
10:257:21963:10:0:85:145:69:72:Times:72:Times:F:sample period.

11:259:22005:29:30:85:504:676:127:Times:127:Times:B:  Outcome data come from the FBI Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) and cover all 50 
11:260:22081:30:29:85:508:646:127:Times:127:Times:B:states  from  2000  –  2010.10    Specifically,  we  use  homicide,  burglary,  robbery,  and  
11:261:22176:29:29:85:506:617:127:Times:127:Times:B:aggravated  assault  data  from  the  official  UCR  data  published  online  by  the  FBI.11    In  
11:262:22277:29:30:85:504:588:127:Times:127:Times:B:addition,  for  the  other  variables  not  available  from  the  online  UCR,  we  use  data  from  the  
11:263:22383:30:29:85:399:558:127:Times:127:Times:B:FBI’s Master files (Return A and Supplemental Homicide Report).     
11:264:22451:29:29:125:506:529:127:Times:127:Times:A:We  use  these  data  to  test  whether  making  it  easier  for  individuals  to  use  lethal  
11:265:22547:29:30:85:505:500:127:Times:127:Times:B:force  in  self-defense  deters  crime  or  increases  homicide.    For  deterrence,  we  focus  on  
11:266:22648:30:29:85:504:470:127:Times:127:Times:B:three criminal outcomes.    The first is burglary, which is defined as “the unlawful entry of 
11:267:22742:29:29:85:504:441:127:Times:127:Times:B:a structure to commit a felony or a theft” (FBI, 2004).    The second is robbery, defined as 
11:268:22835:29:30:85:504:412:127:Times:127:Times:B:“the  taking  or  attempting  to  take  anything  of  value  from  the  care,  custody,  or  control  of  a  
11:269:22944:30:29:85:508:382:127:Times:127:Times:B:person or persons by force or threat of force or violence and/or by putting the victim in fear” 
11:270:23040:29:30:85:504:353:127:Times:127:Times:B:(FBI,  2004).      Finally,  we  also  examine  aggravated  assault,  which  the  FBI  defines  as  “an  
11:271:23145:30:29:85:507:323:127:Times:127:Times:B:unlawful  attack  by  one  person  upon  another  for  the  purpose  of  inflicting  severe  or  
11:272:23242:29:29:85:505:294:127:Times:127:Times:B:aggravated  bodily  injury”,  and  is  typically  accompanied  by  the  use  of  a  weapon  (FBI,  
11:273:23341:29:30:85:504:265:127:Times:127:Times:B:2004).12    In all cases, one might expect rational criminals to be less likely to commit such 
11:274:23436:30:58:85:504:235:127:Times:127:Times:B:crimes under castle doctrine, as the increased scope for the use of justifiable lethal force on

11:276:23595:7:13:85:503:170:32:Times:72:Times:F:10  There are relatively few cases of missing data. Data on whether robbery was committed with a gun were missing from 
11:277:23714:13:10:85:503:157:72:Times:72:Times:F:2000  to  2005  for  Illinois.      Justifiable  homicide  data  were  missing  for  Florida,  so  we  requested  and  received  those  data  
11:278:23856:10:10:85:91:147:72:Times:32:Times:F:directly from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement Office.     11
11:279:23926:10:9:91:504:137:72:Times:72:Times:F:   These  data  include  corrections  by  the  FBI  to  adjust  for  under-reporting  by  police  agencies.      We  note,  however,  that  
11:280:24066:9:10:85:504:128:72:Times:72:Times:F:results  are  qualitatively  and  quantitatively  similar  if  we  instead  use  data  from  the  Supplemental  Homicide  Report  and  
11:281:24201:10:10:85:503:118:72:Times:72:Times:F:Return  A  from  the  FBI  Master  files,  which  were  acquired  directly  from  the  FBI  and  include  statistics  reported  after  the  
11:282:24341:10:10:85:503:108:72:Times:72:Times:F:deadline, but do not correct for under-reporting.    For example, estimates corresponding to the homicide estimates in the 6 
11:283:24466:10:9:85:503:98:72:Times:72:Times:F:columns of Panel A in Table 5 are 0.0853, 0.0926, 0.0850, 0.0892, 0.0729, and 0.128, respectively.    All are significant at 
11:284:24591:9:10:85:91:89:72:Times:32:Times:F:the 1 percent level.     12
11:285:24618:10:10:91:503:79:72:Times:72:Times:F:  Results are similar using data on all assaults, including simple assault, which were obtained from Return A of the FBI 
11:286:24739:10:0:85:138:69:72:Times:72:Times:F:Master files.     
12:287:24761:0:29:85:385:705:127:Times:127:Times:B:the part of the victim raises the expected cost to the criminal.13   
12:288:24830:29:30:85:505:676:127:Times:127:Times:B:    Our  last  set  of  outcomes  is  intended  to  measure  the  escalation  of  violence.      The  
12:289:24932:30:29:85:503:646:127:Times:127:Times:B:primary outcome we examine is total homicides, which is defined as the sum of murder and 
12:290:25021:29:29:85:507:617:127:Times:127:Times:B:non-negligent  manslaughter,  although  we  also  look  at  murder  separately  to  determine  
12:291:25116:29:30:85:380:588:127:Times:127:Times:B:exactly how police are classifying the additional homicides.14   
12:292:25181:30:29:85:506:558:127:Times:127:Times:B:    An  increase  in  homicide  could  represent  either  an  increase  in  legally  justified  
12:293:25277:29:29:85:506:529:127:Times:127:Times:B:homicide  that  is  reported  as  murder  or  non-negligent  manslaughter,  or  the  escalation  of  
12:294:25378:29:30:85:512:500:127:Times:127:Times:B:violence  by  criminals,  or  the  escalation  of  violence  in  otherwise  non-violent  situations.15  
12:295:25482:30:29:85:504:470:127:Times:127:Times:B:In order to shed light on that issue, we look at two other outcomes, both of which measure 
12:296:25573:29:29:85:507:441:127:Times:127:Times:B:the  escalation  of  violence  by  criminals  in  response  to  castle  doctrine.    The  ratio  of  
12:297:25674:29:30:85:504:412:127:Times:127:Times:B:robberies committed with a gun measures whether criminals respond by being more likely 
12:298:25761:30:29:85:505:382:127:Times:127:Times:B:to  carry  and  use  weapons  during  the  commission  of  a  crime,  as  one  might  expect  if  they  
12:299:25865:29:30:85:504:353:127:Times:127:Times:B:believe they will be faced with lethal force by the victim.    We also look at felony-type and 
12:300:25960:30:29:85:509:323:127:Times:127:Times:B:suspected felony-type murders, which also measure the escalation of violence by criminals.   
12:301:26053:29:29:85:504:294:127:Times:127:Times:B:We expect to see increases in these outcomes if castle doctrine laws induce criminals to be 
12:302:26145:29:30:85:455:265:127:Times:127:Times:B:more likely to carry and use deadly weapons during the commission of crimes.     
12:303:26226:30:29:125:504:235:127:Times:127:Times:A: In addition, we also ask whether the laws increase homicides that are reported 
12:304:26305:29:29:85:505:206:127:Times:127:Times:B:to  the  FBI  as  “justifiable  homicides  by  private  citizens”,  which  the  FBI  defines  as  “the  
12:305:26409:29:29:85:506:177:127:Times:127:Times:B:killing of a felon during the commission of a felony” (Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook, 
12:306:26498:29:7:85:223:148:98:g_d0_f3:98:g_d0_f3:F:                                                               
12:307:26561:7:13:85:503:141:32:Times:72:Times:F:13  To the extent castle doctrine increases homicide, however, the hierarchy rule means that our results are (slightly) biased 
12:308:26688:13:10:85:504:128:72:Times:72:Times:F:in favor of finding deterrence effects.    The hierarchy rule instructs reporting agencies to only code the highest, or most 
12:309:26813:10:10:85:504:118:72:Times:72:Times:F:serious, offense in multiple-offense situations.    Thus, a burglary that escalates into a homicide due to castle doctrine will 
12:310:26941:10:10:85:91:108:72:Times:32:Times:F:be coded as a homicide, which would lead us to (slightly) overstate the magnitude of deterrence.         14
12:311:27048:10:9:91:503:98:72:Times:72:Times:F:  Homicide figures come from the UCR data published online and do not include justifiable homicides.    Murder figures 
12:312:27167:9:10:85:91:89:72:Times:32:Times:F:come from the FBI’s Return A, since murder is not available as a separate category in the published UCR.             15
12:313:27286:10:10:91:497:79:72:Times:72:Times:F:  The general possibility that disputes can escalate dramatically in environments perceived to be dangerous is discussed 
12:314:27407:10:0:85:202:69:72:Times:72:Times:F:in O’Flaherty and Sethi (2010).     
13:315:27447:0:29:85:506:705:127:Times:127:Times:B:2004).    The  major  disadvantage  of  these  data  is  that  they  are  widely  believed  to  be  
13:316:27547:29:30:85:504:676:127:Times:127:Times:B:underreported;  Kleck  (1988)  estimates  that  around  one-fifth  of  legally  justified  homicides  
13:317:27649:30:29:85:504:646:127:Times:127:Times:B:are  reported  that  way  to  the  FBI.      However,  note  that  we  use  these  data  only  to  look  for  
13:318:27759:29:29:85:505:617:127:Times:127:Times:B:evidence  of  relative changes  in  legally  justified  homicide,  and  then  use  those  estimates  
13:319:27860:29:30:85:504:588:127:Times:127:Times:B:along with varying assumptions about the degree of underreporting in order to determine if 
13:320:27951:30:29:85:506:558:127:Times:127:Times:B:the  entire  increase  in  homicides  can  be  explained  by  legally  justified  homicide.    What  
13:321:28052:29:29:85:506:529:127:Times:127:Times:B:would  complicate  our  analysis  is  if  reporting  changed  over  time  in  a  way  that  was  
13:322:28149:29:30:85:506:500:127:Times:127:Times:B:systematically  correlated  with  the  passage  of  castle  doctrine.    While  the  FBI  Uniform  
13:323:28248:30:29:85:506:470:127:Times:127:Times:B:Crime Reporting Handbook makes it look to us that this should not be the case,16  our  view  
13:324:28341:29:29:85:507:441:127:Times:127:Times:B:is  that  if  anything,  police  agencies  are  probably  more  likely  to  report  homicides  as  
13:325:28440:29:30:85:506:412:127:Times:127:Times:B:justifiable  after  the  passage  of  these  laws.    Thus,  we  interpret  our  estimates  as  upper  
13:326:28543:30:29:85:451:382:127:Times:127:Times:B:bounds on the relative effect of castle doctrine on legally justifiable homicide.     
13:327:28629:29:30:85:506:353:127:Times:127:Times:B:    The  data  also  allow  us  to  perform  several  placebo,  or  falsification  tests.    For  
13:328:28727:30:29:85:503:323:127:Times:127:Times:B:example, because the focus of castle doctrine laws is on civilians, and not law enforcement, 
13:329:28820:29:29:85:512:294:127:Times:127:Times:B:we  examine  whether  we  detect  effects  of  the  laws  on  justifiable  homicide  by  police.    
13:330:28920:29:39:85:504:265:127:Times:127:Times:B:Similarly, we use data on the rate of larceny and motor vehicle theft to determine whether 
13:331:29011:39:7:85:223:226:98:g_d0_f3:98:g_d0_f3:F:                                                               
13:332:29074:7:13:85:503:219:32:Times:72:Times:F:16  For example, the handbook emphasizes that “law enforcement agencies must report the willful (non-negligent) killing 
13:333:29194:13:10:85:504:206:72:Times:72:Times:F:of  one  individual  by  another,  not  the  criminal  liability  of  the  person  or  persons  involved”  (Uniform  Crime  Reporting  
13:334:29329:10:10:85:503:196:72:Times:72:Times:F:Handbook,  2004).      In  addition,  the  handbook  emphasizes  that  by  definition,  justifiable  homicide  occurs  in  conjunction  
13:335:29465:10:10:85:503:186:72:Times:72:Times:F:with other offenses, and those other offenses must be reported.    The handbook explicitly states that “reporting agencies 
13:336:29588:10:9:85:503:176:72:Times:72:Times:F:should take care to ensure that they do not classify a killing as justifiable or excusable solely on the claims of self-defense 
13:337:29715:9:10:85:510:167:72:Times:72:Times:F:or  on  the  action  of  a  coroner,  prosecutor,  grand  jury,  or  court”  (Uniform  Crime  Reporting  Handbook,  2004).    
13:338:29841:10:10:85:503:157:72:Times:72:Times:F:Additionally, the handbook gives examples of specific hypothetical events that would and would not qualify as justifiable 
13:339:29963:10:10:85:503:147:72:Times:72:Times:F:homicide under the guidelines.    An example given of an incident that would qualify as a justifiable homicide is “When a 
13:340:30085:10:9:85:504:137:72:Times:72:Times:F:gunman  entered  a  store  and  attempted  to  rob  the  proprietor,  the  storekeeper  shot  and  killed  the  felon”  (Uniform  Crime  
13:341:30222:9:10:85:503:128:72:Times:72:Times:F:Reporting Handbook, 2004).    Note that in the absence of castle doctrine law, this may not qualify as a self-defense case 
13:342:30345:10:10:85:503:118:72:Times:72:Times:F:(though it could, of course), but according to the guidelines should still have been reported as a justifiable homicide.    An 
13:343:30472:10:10:85:508:108:72:Times:72:Times:F:example  of  what  would  NOT  qualify  as  a  justifiable  homicide  is  “While  playing  cards,  two  men  got  into  an  argument.     
13:344:30610:10:9:85:504:98:72:Times:72:Times:F:The  first  man  attacked  the  second  with  a  broken  bottle.      The  second  man  pulled  a  gun  and  killed  his  attacker.      The  
13:345:30752:9:10:85:503:89:72:Times:72:Times:F:police arrested the shooter; he claimed self-defense” (Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook, 2004).    Note here that under 
13:346:30872:10:10:85:503:79:72:Times:72:Times:F:castle  doctrine,  the  shooter  may  well  have  been  justified  as  acting  in  self-defense,  though  again  the  reporting  handbook  
13:347:31011:10:0:85:397:69:72:Times:72:Times:F:explicitly states that this would not qualify as a justifiable homicide under the guidelines.     
14:348:31113:0:29:85:505:705:127:Times:127:Times:B:castle  doctrine  laws  appear  to  affect  those  crimes.17      In  both  cases  we  expect  to  find  no  
14:349:31222:29:30:85:506:676:127:Times:127:Times:B:effects  so  long  as  the  identifying  assumptions  of  our  difference-in-difference  research  
14:350:31321:30:29:85:366:646:127:Times:127:Times:B:design hold, which we discuss at length in the next section.     
14:351:31386:29:29:85:504:617:127:Times:127:Times:B:  Finally, we have data on several time-varying control variables.    Specifically, we 
14:352:31471:29:30:85:506:588:127:Times:127:Times:B:have  measures  of  the  number  of  full-time  equivalent  police  per  100,000  state  residents  
14:353:31571:30:29:85:503:558:127:Times:127:Times:B:(Uniform Crime Reports, 2000-2010).    We also include both contemporaneous and lagged 
14:354:31658:29:29:85:506:529:127:Times:127:Times:B:measures  of  the  number  of  persons  incarcerated  in  state  prison  per  100,000  residents  
14:355:31756:29:30:85:504:500:127:Times:127:Times:B:(Bureau  of  Justice  Statistics  Bulletin,  2000-2010).      These  variables  capture  the  effects  of  
14:356:31863:30:29:85:504:470:127:Times:127:Times:B:deterrence and incapacitation caused by additional policing or incarceration.    In addition, 
14:357:31957:29:29:85:504:441:127:Times:127:Times:B:we  have  two  variables  from  the  American  Community  Survey  of  the  U.S.  Census  Bureau  
14:358:32054:29:30:85:512:412:127:Times:127:Times:B:that measure local legal opportunities, including median family income and the poverty rate.   
14:359:32149:30:29:85:504:382:127:Times:127:Times:B:We also have data on the share of white and black men in the 15-24 and 25-44 age groups 
14:360:32237:29:30:85:504:353:127:Times:127:Times:B:for each state over time (American Community Survey, 2000-2010).    Finally, we measure 
14:361:32325:30:29:85:506:323:127:Times:127:Times:B:the  generosity  of  public  assistance  in  each  state  by  measuring  per  capita  spending  on

14:363:32525:29:30:85:142:265:127:Times:127:Times:B:2010).

14:366:32559:29:30:85:504:177:127:Times:127:Times:B:  To distinguish the effect of the castle doctrine laws from confounding factors, we 
14:367:32642:30:29:85:507:147:127:Times:127:Times:B:exploit  the  within-state  variation  induced  by  the  fact  that  21  states  passed  such  laws  
14:368:32743:29:29:85:504:118:127:Times:127:Times:B:between  2000  and  2010.      Specifically,  we  use  a  difference-in-differences  research  design

14:370:32911:10:10:91:504:79:72:Times:72:Times:F:   While  it  may  be  possible  for  castle  doctrine  law  to  deter  these  crimes  as  well,  our  view  is  that  deterrence  should  be  
14:371:33054:10:0:85:403:69:72:Times:72:Times:F:considerably less likely for these crimes than for burglary, robbery, and aggravated assault.

15:373:33260:29:30:85:411:676:127:Times:127:Times:B:states that do not, and focus primarily on within-region comparisons.     
15:374:33334:30:29:85:507:646:127:Times:127:Times:B:    Formally,  we  estimate  fixed  effects  ordinary  least  squares  (OLS)  panel  data  
15:375:33425:29:29:85:506:617:127:Times:127:Times:B:models,  where  we  typically  use  the  log  of  the  outcome  per  100,000  population  as  the  
15:376:33524:29:30:85:507:588:127:Times:127:Times:B:dependent  variable.    In  addition,  because  a  significant  number  of  states  report  zero  
15:377:33622:30:29:85:504:558:127:Times:127:Times:B:justifiable  homicides  in  a  given  year,  we  estimate  a  fixed  effects  negative  binomial  model  
15:378:33727:29:29:85:504:529:127:Times:127:Times:B:for that outcome as well as OLS models that use the number of justifiable homicides as the 
15:379:33818:29:30:85:506:500:127:Times:127:Times:B:dependent  variable  and  control  for  population  on  the  right-hand  side.    Ordinary  least  
15:380:33917:30:29:85:504:470:127:Times:127:Times:B:squares  models  are  estimated  with  and  without  weighting  by  state  population.      The  OLS

15:390:34775:29:30:85:504:177:127:Times:127:Times:B:at  the  state  level,  though  we  also  do  additional  exercises  in  the  spirit  of  Bertrand,  Duflo,  
15:391:34884:30:29:85:504:147:127:Times:127:Times:B:and Mullainathan (2004) to ensure standard errors are being estimated accurately, as well as 
15:392:34977:29:38:85:512:118:127:Times:127:Times:B:to  perform  inference  using  placebo  estimates  from  simulated  pre-castle  doctrine  data.    
15:393:35076:38:7:85:223:80:98:g_d0_f3:98:g_d0_f3:F:                                                               
15:394:35139:7:0:85:343:73:32:Times:72:Times:F:18  There are four Census Regions: West, Midwest, Northeast, and South.     
16:395:35219:0:29:85:505:705:127:Times:127:Times:B:This last approach of using distributions of placebo  estimates  to  do  inference  is  similar  in  
16:396:35320:29:30:85:506:676:127:Times:127:Times:B:spirit to the permutation inference approach used in the synthetic control method by Abadie, 
16:397:35413:30:29:85:258:646:127:Times:127:Times:B:Diamond, and Hainmueller (2010).     
16:398:35450:29:29:125:507:617:127:Times:127:Times:A:Since  we  primarily  rely  on  specifications  that  include  state  fixed  effects  and  
16:399:35541:29:30:85:504:588:127:Times:127:Times:B:region-by-year fixed effects, the identifying assumption is that in the absence of the castle 
16:400:35635:30:29:85:507:558:127:Times:127:Times:B:doctrine  laws,  adopting  states  would  have  experienced  changes  in  crime  similar  to  
16:401:35729:29:29:85:504:529:127:Times:127:Times:B:non-adopting states in the same region of the country.    Our data allow us to test and relax 
16:402:35823:29:30:85:504:500:127:Times:127:Times:B:this identifying assumption in several ways.    First, we offer a formal statistical test of this 
16:403:35921:30:29:85:511:470:127:Times:127:Times:B:by  including  an  indicator  in  equation  (1)  for  the  year  prior  to  the  passage  of  the  laws.    
16:404:36029:29:29:85:503:441:127:Times:127:Times:B:That is, we ask whether states that pass the laws diverge even before they pass the laws.    If 
16:405:36125:29:30:85:484:412:127:Times:127:Times:B:they do, it suggests that the identifying assumption of our research design is violated.     
16:406:36218:30:29:125:504:382:127:Times:127:Times:A:We also examine whether time-varying determinants of crime are orthogonal to the 
16:407:36299:29:30:85:505:353:127:Times:127:Times:B:within-state  variation  in  castle  doctrine  laws.      Under  our  identifying  assumption,  factors  
16:408:36404:30:29:85:505:323:127:Times:127:Times:B:such  as  economic  conditions,  welfare  spending,  and  policing  intensity  should  not  change  
16:409:36504:29:29:85:504:294:127:Times:127:Times:B:more over time in adopting states than non-adopting states, as this would suggest that crime 
16:410:36597:29:30:85:507:265:127:Times:127:Times:B:in  the  two  groups  might  have  diverged  even  in  the  absence  of  treatment.    Thus,  we  
16:411:36695:30:29:85:503:235:127:Times:127:Times:B:examine whether adding these controls changes our estimates in a meaningful way.    To the 
16:412:36786:29:29:85:506:206:127:Times:127:Times:B:extent  that  our  difference-in-differences  estimates  remain  unchanged,  it  provides  some  
16:413:36883:29:30:85:329:177:127:Times:127:Times:B:assurance that our research design is reasonable.19   
16:414:36937:30:29:125:509:147:127:Times:127:Times:A:Along   similar   lines,   we   also   show   results   from   specifications   that   include   
16:415:37034:29:19:85:505:118:127:Times:127:Times:B:contemporaneous  motor  vehicle  theft  and  larceny  as  controls.      While  it  is  possible  that

16:417:37203:10:10:91:505:89:72:Times:72:Times:F:  The  primary  concern  is  not  that  observed  determinants  vary  systematically  over  time—we  can  control  for  those  
16:418:37330:10:10:85:503:79:72:Times:72:Times:F:variables directly—but that if they do, it may suggest that unobserved determinants also change systematically over time 
16:419:37451:10:0:85:225:69:72:Times:72:Times:F:in the treatment and control groups.         
17:420:37500:0:29:85:505:705:127:Times:127:Times:B:castle  doctrine  laws  could  affect  these  crimes,  we  would  expect  any  such  effects  to  be  
17:421:37602:29:30:85:506:676:127:Times:127:Times:B:second-order  and  at  most  small  in  magnitude.    Thus,  we  use  these  crime  measures  as  
17:422:37700:30:29:85:510:646:127:Times:127:Times:B:controls  that  pick  up  any  differential  trends  in  crime  in  adopting  and  non-adopting  states.     
17:423:37809:29:29:85:505:617:127:Times:127:Times:B:We  also  perform  falsification  exercises  using  these  crimes  as  outcomes  to  explicitly  test  
17:424:37912:29:30:85:506:588:127:Times:127:Times:B:whether  castle  doctrine  laws  appear  to  affect  crimes  unrelated  to  self-defense.    If  our  
17:425:38014:30:29:85:464:558:127:Times:127:Times:B:identifying assumption holds, we would expect to see no effects on these crimes.     
17:426:38099:29:29:125:505:529:127:Times:127:Times:A:Finally, we allow for state-specific linear time trends, thereby allowing each state 
17:427:38184:29:30:85:218:500:127:Times:127:Times:B:to follow a different trend.

17:431:38263:30:29:85:505:382:127:Times:127:Times:B:  One way to test the identifying assumption is to directly examine whether crimes 
17:432:38344:29:30:85:503:353:127:Times:127:Times:B:that ought not be affected by the laws—and thus proxy for general crime trends—appear to 
17:433:38433:30:29:85:505:323:127:Times:127:Times:B:be affected by the laws.20    Finding effects on crimes that ought to be exogenous to castle 
17:434:38526:29:29:85:327:294:127:Times:127:Times:B:doctrine law would invalidate our research design.     
17:435:38581:29:30:85:505:265:127:Times:127:Times:B:    Thus,  we  examine  whether  castle  doctrine  laws  appear  to  affect  larceny  or  motor  
17:436:38678:30:29:85:503:235:127:Times:127:Times:B:vehicle theft.    While it is possible that these outcomes are affected directly by self-defense 
17:437:38775:29:29:85:388:206:127:Times:127:Times:B:laws, we argue that such effects should be second-order, at best.     
17:438:38845:29:30:85:505:177:127:Times:127:Times:B:    Results  are  shown  in  Table  3,  which  uses  a  format  similar  to  subsequent  tables  
17:439:38942:30:29:85:503:147:127:Times:127:Times:B:showing other outcomes.    Columns 1 through 6 represent OLS estimates that are weighted 
17:440:39031:29:29:85:505:118:127:Times:127:Times:B:by  population,  while  Columns  7  through  12  are  unweighted  OLS  estimates.    The  first

17:442:39193:10:10:91:504:79:72:Times:72:Times:F:   Similar  tests  are  performed  by  Ayres  and  Levitt  (1998),  when  they  look  for  effects  of  Lojack  on  crimes  other  than  
17:443:39330:10:0:85:164:69:72:Times:72:Times:F:motor  vehicle  theft.

18:445:39468:29:30:85:504:676:127:Times:127:Times:B:adds region-by-year fixed effects, while the third column adds time-varying controls.    The 
18:446:39561:30:29:85:506:646:127:Times:127:Times:B:fourth  column  additionally  includes  an  indicator  variable  for  the  year  before  the  castle  
18:447:39663:29:29:85:507:617:127:Times:127:Times:B:doctrine  law  was  adopted;  the  fifth  drops  the  leading  indicator  but  adds  controls  for  
18:448:39763:29:30:85:505:588:127:Times:127:Times:B:contemporaneous  larceny  and  motor  vehicle  theft.      Finally,  the  last  column  controls  for  
18:449:39866:30:29:85:505:558:127:Times:127:Times:B:state  fixed  effects,  region-by-year  fixed  effects,  time-varying  controls,  and  state-specific  
18:450:39969:29:29:85:181:529:127:Times:127:Times:B:linear time trends.     
18:451:39993:29:30:85:506:500:127:Times:127:Times:B:    Estimates  for  larceny  are  close  to  zero  and  statistically  insignificant  across  all  
18:452:40092:30:29:85:504:470:127:Times:127:Times:B:specifications.    Estimates of the effect on the log of the motor vehicle theft rate are more 
18:453:40187:29:29:85:505:441:127:Times:127:Times:B:interesting.      Results  in  columns  1  and  7  in  which  only  state  and  year  fixed  effects  are  
18:454:40294:29:30:85:504:412:127:Times:127:Times:B:included provide suggestive evidence of increases in motor vehicle theft of 5 to 8 percent, 
18:455:40386:30:29:85:509:382:127:Times:127:Times:B:the   latter   of   which   is   significant   at   the   10   percent   level.      However,   including   
18:456:40494:29:30:85:504:353:127:Times:127:Times:B:region-by-year fixed effects in columns 2 and 8 causes the estimate to drop to zero or even 
18:457:40586:30:29:85:505:323:127:Times:127:Times:B:turn  negative,  and  both  are  statistically  insignificant.      This  suggests  that  accounting  for  
18:458:40693:29:29:85:505:294:127:Times:127:Times:B:differences  in  regional  trends  in  some  way  may  be  important  in  assessing  the  impact  of  
18:459:40795:29:30:85:192:265:127:Times:127:Times:B:castle doctrine laws.

18:461:40819:29:29:85:154:206:127:Times:127:Times:B:4.2 Deterrence 
18:462:40834:29:30:85:507:177:127:Times:127:Times:B:    We  now  examine  whether  strengthening  self-defense  law  deters  crime.    We  
18:463:40921:30:29:85:503:147:127:Times:127:Times:B:examine three types of crime: burglary, robbery, and aggravated assault.    To the extent that 
18:464:41016:29:29:85:504:118:127:Times:127:Times:B:criminals respond to the higher actual or perceived risk that victims will use lethal force to 
18:465:41111:29:0:85:505:89:127:Times:127:Times:B:protect  themselves,  we  would  expect  these  crimes  to  decline  after  the  adoption  of  castle  
19:466:41218:0:29:85:142:705:127:Times:127:Times:B:doctrine.      
19:467:41233:29:30:122:505:676:127:Times:127:Times:A:Results  are  shown  in  Table  4,  where  the  first  6  columns  show  estimates  from  an  
19:468:41327:30:29:85:507:646:127:Times:127:Times:B:OLS  regression  weighted  by  state  population,  while  the  second  6  columns  are  from  
19:469:41421:29:29:85:504:617:127:Times:127:Times:B:unweighted OLS regressions.    Results in Column 1 in Panel A for burglary are similar to 
19:470:41511:29:30:85:505:588:127:Times:127:Times:B:the  finding  for  motor  vehicle  theft,  in  that  estimates  range  from  6  to  8  percent  and  are  
19:471:41617:30:29:85:505:558:127:Times:127:Times:B:statistically  significant  at  the  5  percent  level.      Again,  however,  including  region-by-year  
19:472:41723:29:29:85:506:529:127:Times:127:Times:B:effects  in  columns  2  and  8  reduces  the  estimates  considerably,  and  all  are  statistically  
19:473:41826:29:30:85:323:500:127:Times:127:Times:B:indistinguishable from zero at the 5 percent level.     
19:474:41882:30:29:122:503:470:127:Times:127:Times:A:Importantly, there is little evidence of deterrence effects in any specification for any 
19:475:41971:29:29:85:504:441:127:Times:127:Times:B:outcome: of the 36 estimates reported, none are negative and statistically significant at the 
19:476:42065:29:30:85:505:412:127:Times:127:Times:B:10  percent  level.    The  estimates  are  sufficiently  precise  as  to  rule  out  large  deterrence  
19:477:42170:30:29:85:506:382:127:Times:127:Times:B:effects.    For  example,  in  our  preferred  specification  in  column  3,  the  lower  bounds  of  
19:478:42272:29:30:85:505:353:127:Times:127:Times:B:estimates  on  burglary,  robbery,  and  aggravated  assault  are  -2.1  percent,  -1.9  percent,  and  
19:479:42376:30:29:85:505:323:127:Times:127:Times:B:-2.5  percent.    Put  differently,  our  estimates  and  standard  errors  from  column  3  indicate  
19:480:42479:29:29:85:505:294:127:Times:127:Times:B:that  if  we  were  to  perform  this  castle  doctrine  policy  experiment  many  times,  we  would  
19:481:42581:29:30:85:503:265:127:Times:127:Times:B:expect that 90 percent of the time we would find deterrence effects of less than 0.7 percent, 
19:482:42675:30:29:85:504:235:127:Times:127:Times:B:0.4 percent, and 0.5 percent for burglary, robbery, and aggravated assault, respectively.    In 
19:483:42771:29:29:85:505:206:127:Times:127:Times:B:short,  these  estimates  provide  strong  evidence  against  the  possibility  that  castle  doctrine  
19:484:42875:29:30:85:505:177:127:Times:127:Times:B:laws  cause  economically  meaningful  deterrence  effects.      Thus,  while  castle  doctrine  law  
19:485:42977:30:29:85:504:147:127:Times:127:Times:B:may well have benefits to those protecting themselves in self-defense, there is no evidence 
19:486:43069:29:29:85:449:118:127:Times:127:Times:B:that the law provides positive spillovers by deterring crime more generally.         
19:487:43154:29:0:85:88:89:127:Times:127:Times:B: 
20:488:43158:0:29:85:155:705:127:Times:127:Times:B:4.3  Homicide  
20:489:43173:29:30:85:513:676:127:Times:127:Times:B:    We  now  turn  to  whether  strengthening  self-defense  laws  increases  homicide.    
20:490:43264:30:29:85:505:646:127:Times:127:Times:B:Given  that  the  laws  reduce  the  expected  costs  associated  with  using  violence,  economic  
20:491:43364:29:29:85:505:617:127:Times:127:Times:B:theory  would  predict  that  there  would  be  more  of  it.    This  could  be  driven  by  any  of  
20:492:43467:29:30:85:504:588:127:Times:127:Times:B:several possibilities.    For example, the increase could be due to additional legally justified 
20:493:43564:30:29:85:504:558:127:Times:127:Times:B:killings that are not reported that way by police.    Perhaps more troubling is the possibility 
20:494:43660:29:29:85:504:529:127:Times:127:Times:B:that under castle doctrine, conflicts or crimes that might not have otherwise turned deadly 
20:495:43752:29:30:85:504:500:127:Times:127:Times:B:now do.    For example, a criminal may not have intended to kill someone he was robbing 
20:496:43840:30:29:85:506:470:127:Times:127:Times:B:until  the  victim  attempted  to  use  a  weapon  in  self-defense.    Alternatively,  criminals  may  
20:497:43944:29:29:85:491:441:127:Times:127:Times:B:escalate violence in response to castle doctrine laws and cause in increase in homicide.     
20:498:44037:29:30:85:509:412:127:Times:127:Times:B:                 Results   are   shown   in   Panels   A,   B,   and   C   of   Table   5,   which   show   
20:499:44145:30:29:85:504:382:127:Times:127:Times:B:population-weighted OLS estimates, unweighted OLS estimates, and unweighted estimates 
20:500:44231:29:30:85:506:353:127:Times:127:Times:B:from  a  negative  binomial  model.    Estimates  from  the  negative  binomial  regression  are  
20:501:44329:30:29:85:505:323:127:Times:127:Times:B:interpreted  in  the  same  way  as  those  from  a  log-linear  OLS  model.    Results  from  the  
20:502:44429:29:29:85:505:294:127:Times:127:Times:B:population-weighted shown in Panel A indicate that the homicide rate is increased by 8 to 
20:503:44519:29:30:85:505:265:127:Times:127:Times:B:10  percent;  all  6  estimates  are  statistically  significant  at  the  5  percent  level,  and  3  are  
20:504:44627:30:29:85:504:235:127:Times:127:Times:B:significant  at  the  1  percent  level.      Estimates  from  unweighted  OLS  regressions  shown  in  
20:505:44731:29:29:85:504:206:127:Times:127:Times:B:Panel  B  range  from  5  to  9  percent,  though  all  are  measured  imprecisely:  t-statistics  range  
20:506:44837:29:30:85:505:177:127:Times:127:Times:B:from  0.6  to  1.5.     Estimates  in  Panel  C  from  a  negative  binomial  model  indicate  castle  
20:507:44940:30:29:85:504:147:127:Times:127:Times:B:doctrine leads to a 6 to 11 percent increase in homicide.    All negative binomial estimates 
20:508:45033:29:29:85:505:118:127:Times:127:Times:B:that  include  region-by-year  fixed  effects  are  significant  at  the  5  percent  level,  and  that  
20:509:45138:29:0:85:386:89:127:Times:127:Times:B:which does not (column 1) is significant at the 10 percent level.     
21:510:45212:0:29:85:505:705:127:Times:127:Times:B:    We  have  also  done  additional  tests  in  order  to  ensure  that  we  are  making  correct  
21:511:45312:29:30:85:506:676:127:Times:127:Times:B:inferences  about  statistical  significance.    Toward  that  end,  we  do  tests  in  the  spirit  of  
21:512:45417:30:29:85:504:646:127:Times:127:Times:B:Bertrand et al. (2004), in which we randomly select 11-year panels from 1960 to 2004, and 
21:513:45507:29:29:85:510:617:127:Times:127:Times:B:then randomly assign states to the treatment dates found in our data, without replacement.   
21:514:45600:29:30:85:504:588:127:Times:127:Times:B:Thus, we assume that one state adopted castle doctrine on October 1st of the 6th year of the 
21:515:45693:30:29:85:504:558:127:Times:127:Times:B:11-year panel (just as Florida actually adopted in 2005, the 6th year of our panel), and that 
21:516:45787:29:29:85:504:529:127:Times:127:Times:B:13 more states adopted in the 7th year of the 11-year panel, etc.    We generate distributions 
21:517:45882:29:30:85:504:500:127:Times:127:Times:B:of estimates, and ask how often we reject the null hypothesis of no effect at the 5 percent 
21:518:45974:30:29:85:506:470:127:Times:127:Times:B:level,  as  well  as  what  proportion  of  the  placebo  estimates  are  larger  than  the  actual  
21:519:46075:29:29:85:505:441:127:Times:127:Times:B:estimated effect of (real) castle doctrine.    The latter figure corresponds to a p-value and is 
21:520:46172:29:30:85:504:412:127:Times:127:Times:B:similar to the method used in synthetic control methods (Abadie et al., 2010), as well as by 
21:521:46265:30:29:85:258:382:127:Times:127:Times:B:Chetty, Looney, and Kroft (2009).       
21:522:46305:29:30:85:508:353:127:Times:127:Times:B:    The  resulting  placebo  distributions  are  shown  in  Figures  1,  2,  and  3,  and  
21:523:46396:30:29:85:504:323:127:Times:127:Times:B:correspond to Table 5 results from column 2 of Panels A, B, and C, respectively.    Results 
21:524:46488:29:29:85:506:294:127:Times:127:Times:B:from  population-weighted  OLS  placebo  estimates  suggest  that  robust  clustered  standard  
21:525:46584:29:30:85:505:265:127:Times:127:Times:B:errors  may  be  a  bit  too  small:  11.9  percent  of  simulated  estimates  are  significant  at  the  5  
21:526:46693:30:29:85:504:235:127:Times:127:Times:B:percent  level.    However,  the  estimate  of  9.46  percent  in  column  2  ranks  in  the  95th 
21:527:46791:29:29:85:504:206:127:Times:127:Times:B:percentile of placebo estimates, which means only 5 percent of placebo estimates are larger 
21:528:46883:29:30:85:141:177:127:Times:127:Times:B:than it is.     
21:529:46899:30:29:85:505:147:127:Times:127:Times:B:    Results  for  unweighted  OLS  simulation  results  are  also  interesting.      On  the  one  
21:530:46998:29:29:85:505:118:127:Times:127:Times:B:hand,  simulations  corresponding  to  the  specification  in  column  2  of  Panel  B  in  Table  5  
21:531:47100:29:0:85:504:89:127:Times:127:Times:B:suggest  that  clustered  standard  errors  from  unweighted  OLS  regressions  are  accurate:  6.3  
22:532:47205:0:29:85:504:705:127:Times:127:Times:B:percent of the simulated estimates are significant at the 5 percent level.    At the same time, 
22:533:47301:29:30:85:505:676:127:Times:127:Times:B:however, the estimate of 8.1 percent shown in Table 5 corresponds to the 94.7th percentile 
22:534:47392:30:29:85:504:646:127:Times:127:Times:B:(see Figure 2), which would give it a p-value of 5.3 percent using the Abadie et al. (2010) 
22:535:47484:29:29:85:506:617:127:Times:127:Times:B:approach  to  inference.    This  suggests  that  results  in  Panel  B  of  Table  5  understate  the  
22:536:47588:29:30:85:258:588:127:Times:127:Times:B:degree of statistical significance.         
22:537:47632:30:29:85:504:558:127:Times:127:Times:B:  Finally, simulations for the fixed effect negative binomial model corresponding to 
22:538:47715:29:29:85:504:529:127:Times:127:Times:B:column  2  in  Panel  C  indicate  that  9.7  percent  of  placebo  estimates  are  significant  at  the  5  
22:539:47824:29:30:85:505:500:127:Times:127:Times:B:percent  level,  while  15.6  percent  are  significant  at  the  10  percent  level.    As  shown  in  
22:540:47928:30:29:85:504:470:127:Times:127:Times:B:Figure 3, the estimate of 7.3 percent in Table 5 ranks at the 95.4th percentile, as fewer than 
22:541:48023:29:29:85:485:441:127:Times:127:Times:B:5 percent of placebo estimates were larger than the actual estimate in the simulations.     
22:542:48115:29:30:85:504:412:127:Times:127:Times:B:  On the basis of these exercises, we conclude that it is unlikely that we would have 
22:543:48199:30:29:85:505:382:127:Times:127:Times:B:obtained estimates of the magnitude and statistical significance shown in Panels A, B, and 
22:544:48290:29:30:85:223:353:127:Times:127:Times:B:C of Table 5 due to chance.     
22:545:48322:30:29:85:504:323:127:Times:127:Times:B:  We have also performed simulations to see if the homicide rates of these particular 
22:546:48406:29:29:85:510:294:127:Times:127:Times:B:21 states ever diverged in the way they did after adopting castle doctrine in the late 2000s.   
22:547:48502:29:30:85:507:265:127:Times:127:Times:B:To  do  so,  we  created  40  panel  data  sets,  each  covering  separate  11-year  time  periods  
22:548:48602:30:29:85:505:235:127:Times:127:Times:B:between  1960  and  2009.    In  each  11-year  panel,  we  assume  that  Florida  adopts  castle  
22:549:48701:29:29:85:504:206:127:Times:127:Times:B:doctrine on October 1st of the 6th year, and that the 13 states that adopted in 2006 adopted in 
22:550:48797:29:30:85:510:177:127:Times:127:Times:B:the   7th   year,   etc.   None   of   the   40   estimates   corresponding   to   either   the   OLS   
22:551:48901:30:29:85:504:147:127:Times:127:Times:B:population-weighted regressions or from the negative binomial regression were larger than 
22:552:48991:29:29:85:504:118:127:Times:127:Times:B:those shown in column 2 of Table 5.    In the case of the OLS unweighted regressions, only 
22:553:49082:29:0:85:505:89:127:Times:127:Times:B:1  of  the  40  placebo  estimates  was  larger  than  the  actual  estimate  of  8.1  percent  shown  in  
23:554:49193:0:29:85:506:705:127:Times:127:Times:B:Column  2,  Panel  B,  of  Table  5.21      Thus,  there  is  no  evidence  that  the  homicide  rates  in  
23:555:49301:29:30:85:504:676:127:Times:127:Times:B:castle doctrine states show a general tendency  to  diverge  from  their  regional  counterparts:  
23:556:49400:30:29:85:504:646:127:Times:127:Times:B:in the last 40 years they have almost never done so as much as they did immediately after 
23:557:49490:29:29:85:242:617:127:Times:127:Times:B:they  passed  castle  doctrine.            
23:558:49533:29:30:85:504:588:127:Times:127:Times:B:  The relative increase in the homicide rate can be seen graphically as well.    Figure 
23:559:49619:30:29:85:505:558:127:Times:127:Times:B:4 shows the log of homicide rate for the 13 states  that  adopted  castle  doctrine  in  2006,  as  
23:560:49719:29:29:85:506:529:127:Times:127:Times:B:well as for the 29 states that did not extend castle doctrine from 2000 to 2010.22    It  shows  
23:561:49816:29:30:85:505:500:127:Times:127:Times:B:that  while  the  trends of  the  two groups  track  each  other  closely  prior  to  castle  doctrine,  
23:562:49920:30:29:85:506:470:127:Times:127:Times:B:afterward  homicides  in  adopting  states  increase  relative  to  control  states.    Importantly,  
23:563:50022:29:29:85:505:441:127:Times:127:Times:B:Figure  1  also  gives  us  little  reason  to  believe  that  even  in  the  absence  of  castle  doctrine,  
23:564:50132:29:30:85:506:412:127:Times:127:Times:B:adopting  states  would  have  experienced  an  increase  in  homicides  after  2005  relative  to  
23:565:50232:30:29:85:201:382:127:Times:127:Times:B:non-adopting states.23   
23:566:50257:29:30:85:505:353:127:Times:127:Times:B:    Collectively,  we  view  these  findings  as  compelling  evidence  that  castle  doctrine  
23:567:50353:30:29:85:504:323:127:Times:127:Times:B:increases homicide.    However, we note that one downside of the homicide measure is that 
23:568:50443:29:29:85:503:294:127:Times:127:Times:B:it could well include homicides that are justified under the new self-defense law, but are not 
23:569:50538:29:30:85:505:265:127:Times:127:Times:B:reported  separately  as  justifiable  homicides.      Thus,  this  increase  may  not  be  viewed  by  
23:570:50642:30:39:85:508:235:127:Times:127:Times:B:everyone   as   unambiguously   bad.      For   example,   the   increase   could   be   driven   by   
23:571:50745:39:10:85:91:196:98:g_d0_f3:32:Times:F:                                                               21
23:572:50810:10:10:91:91:186:72:Times:32:Times:F:  The one larger estimate was 10.5 percent, and was from the 1975 to 1985 time period.     22
23:573:50903:10:9:91:503:176:72:Times:72:Times:F:  It is more difficult to show a meaningful graph for the entire sample of adopting states, as they enacted castle doctrine 
23:574:51027:9:10:85:507:167:72:Times:72:Times:F:in different years.    Also, note that this graph does not rely on within-regional variation, unlike most of our specifications.  
23:575:51156:10:10:85:503:157:72:Times:72:Times:F:Nevertheless, we think that showing results graphically for the largest subset of states that passed the law in the same year 
23:576:51282:10:10:85:91:147:72:Times:32:Times:F:gives the reader a rough idea of the raw variation in the data.         23
23:577:51356:10:9:91:508:137:72:Times:72:Times:F:  As shown in Figure 1, adopting states have homicide rates that are about 30 percent higher than non-adopting states.   
23:578:51477:9:10:85:503:128:72:Times:72:Times:F:However, because we are using a difference-in-differences research design that conditions on year and state fixed effects, 
23:579:51600:10:10:85:504:118:72:Times:72:Times:F:differences in levels is not a concern for identification.    Instead, what would worry us is if the homicide rate in adopting 
23:580:51727:10:10:85:503:108:72:Times:72:Times:F:states increased more than in non-adopting states even before treatment, as that would suggest that the groups might have 
23:581:51849:10:9:85:503:98:72:Times:72:Times:F:continued to diverge afterward, regardless of castle doctrine.   We see no evidence of that, which suggests that the relative 
23:582:51975:9:10:85:504:89:72:Times:72:Times:F:increase  seen  after  2005  is  caused  by  castle  doctrine.      Moreover,  note  that  homicide  estimates  remained  similar  even  
23:583:52112:10:10:85:503:79:72:Times:72:Times:F:after controlling for time-varying police and incarceration rates and other controls, including region-by-year fixed effects, 
23:584:52238:10:0:85:262:69:72:Times:72:Times:F:and allowing for state-specific linear time trends.     
24:585:52298:0:29:85:503:705:127:Times:127:Times:B:individuals protecting themselves from imminent harm by using lethal force.    On the other 
24:586:52390:29:30:85:504:676:127:Times:127:Times:B:hand, the increase could be driven by the escalation of violence in situations that otherwise 
24:587:52484:30:29:85:506:646:127:Times:127:Times:B:would  not  have  ended  in  serious  injury  for  either  party.    Note,  however,  that  the  net  
24:588:52586:29:29:85:506:617:127:Times:127:Times:B:increase  cannot  be  driven  by  a  one-to-one  substitution  of  homicides  of  assailants  for  
24:589:52685:29:30:85:504:588:127:Times:127:Times:B:homicides of innocent victims.    In contrast, in order for the entire increase in homicide to 
24:590:52780:30:29:85:503:558:127:Times:127:Times:B:be driven by life-saving use of force, there would have to be at least some cases of multiple 
24:591:52874:29:29:85:302:529:127:Times:127:Times:B:killed assailants by a would-be-killed victim.     
24:592:52925:29:30:85:508:500:127:Times:127:Times:B:      Results   in   Panel   D   of   Table   5   show   results   for   murder,   which   excludes   
24:593:53027:30:29:85:504:470:127:Times:127:Times:B:non-negligent  manslaughter  classifications that one might think would be used more often 
24:594:53118:29:29:85:507:441:127:Times:127:Times:B:in  self-defense  killings  not  classified  as  justifiable  homicides.    Estimates  indicate  a  
24:595:53218:29:30:85:504:412:127:Times:127:Times:B:similarly sized increase in murder, which suggests that police are largely classifying these 
24:596:53311:30:29:85:248:382:127:Times:127:Times:B:additional homicides as murders.     
24:597:53348:29:30:85:508:353:127:Times:127:Times:B:    Given  the  robustness  of  the  estimates  to  various  specifications,  it  is  worth  
24:598:53441:30:29:85:504:323:127:Times:127:Times:B:considering what one would have to believe for a confounding factor to cause the observed 
24:599:53531:29:29:85:506:294:127:Times:127:Times:B:increase  in  murder/homicide,  rather  than  castle  doctrine.    That  is,  one  would  have  to  
24:600:53631:29:30:85:505:265:127:Times:127:Times:B:believe  that  something  else  caused  homicides  to  increase  relative  to  non-adopting  states  
24:601:53732:30:29:85:504:235:127:Times:127:Times:B:immediately after castle doctrine was enacted, but not in the years prior to enactment.    In 
24:602:53826:29:29:85:504:206:127:Times:127:Times:B:addition, this confounder must have only caused a divergence in homicide rates in the late 
24:603:53917:29:30:85:504:177:127:Times:127:Times:B:2000s coincidental with the passage of castle doctrine, and not at any point in the 40 years 
24:604:54010:30:29:85:503:147:127:Times:127:Times:B:prior.    Furthermore, this confounder must cause an increase in homicides in castle doctrine 
24:605:54104:29:29:85:505:118:127:Times:127:Times:B:states  after  adoption,  but  not  cause  a  similar  increase  in  states  in  the  same  region  of  the  
24:606:54213:29:0:85:504:89:127:Times:127:Times:B:country that did not adopt castle doctrine at that time.    Additionally, the confounder must 
25:607:54311:0:29:85:506:705:127:Times:127:Times:B:cause  adopting  states  to  diverge  from  their  own  pre-adoption  trend  in  homicide  rate,  
25:608:54409:29:30:85:505:676:127:Times:127:Times:B:coincidental  with  the  enactment  of  castle  doctrine.    The  confounder  must  also  increase  
25:609:54509:30:29:85:506:646:127:Times:127:Times:B:homicides  in  adopting  states  after  adoption  without  causing  proportionate  increases  in  
25:610:54607:29:29:85:507:617:127:Times:127:Times:B:motor  vehicle  theft  and  larceny.    Finally,  the  confounder  must  be  uncorrelated  with  
25:611:54704:29:30:85:504:588:127:Times:127:Times:B:changes in the economic conditions, welfare generosity, and the rates of incarceration and 
25:612:54795:30:29:85:503:558:127:Times:127:Times:B:policing in adopting states immediately following adoption.    We are unable to think of any 
25:613:54888:29:29:85:505:529:127:Times:127:Times:B:confounding  factor  that  would  fit  this  description,  and  thus  we  interpret  the  increase  in  
25:614:54992:29:30:85:317:500:127:Times:127:Times:B:homicides as the causal effect of castle doctrine.     
25:615:55047:30:29:85:151:470:127:Times:127:Times:B:       
25:616:55051:29:29:85:217:441:127:Times:127:Times:B:4.4 Homicide: Interpretation 
25:617:55080:29:30:85:504:412:127:Times:127:Times:B:  While it is clear that the increase in homicide is largely being classified by police 
25:618:55166:30:29:85:505:382:127:Times:127:Times:B:as  murder,  it  is  possible  that  this  represents  a  misclassification  by  police.      Here  we  look  
25:619:55276:29:30:85:503:353:127:Times:127:Times:B:directly for evidence of this and other interpretations.      We   start   by   assessing   whether 
25:620:55376:30:29:85:504:323:127:Times:127:Times:B:criminals  appear  to  escalate  violence  in  response to castle doctrine laws.    For example, a 
25:621:55475:29:29:85:507:294:127:Times:127:Times:B:rational  criminal  may  respond  to  a  real  or  perceived  increase  in  the  likelihood  of  
25:622:55572:29:30:85:503:265:127:Times:127:Times:B:encountering a victim willing to use lethal force by using a deadly weapon himself.    Thus, 
25:623:55665:30:29:85:507:235:127:Times:127:Times:B:we  examine  whether  castle  doctrine  increases  felony-type  and  suspected  felony-type  
25:624:55758:29:29:85:504:206:127:Times:127:Times:B:murders, which appeared to be committed during a felony.    Results are shown in Panel A 
25:625:55847:29:30:85:505:177:127:Times:127:Times:B:of  Table  6.      The  estimate  from  column  1,  which  controls  only  for  state  and  year  fixed  
25:626:55952:30:29:85:506:147:127:Times:127:Times:B:effects,  is  10  percent  and  is  statistically  indistinguishable  from  zero.    Estimates  from  
25:627:56054:29:29:85:506:118:127:Times:127:Times:B:specifications  including  region-by-year  fixed  effects  are  more  suggestive  of  a  criminal  
25:628:56153:29:0:85:507:89:127:Times:127:Times:B:escalation  effect:  estimates  in  columns  2  through  5  are  around  20  percent  and  are  
26:629:56253:0:29:85:505:705:127:Times:127:Times:B:statistically  significant  at  the  10  percent  level,  though  we  note  the  estimate  goes  to  zero  
26:630:56360:29:30:85:503:676:127:Times:127:Times:B:when allowing for state-specific time trends in column 6.       We    also    examine    whether 
26:631:56457:30:29:85:505:646:127:Times:127:Times:B:criminals  are  more  likely  to  use  guns  during  robberies.24      Results  in  Panel  B  of  Table  6  
26:632:56565:29:29:85:504:617:127:Times:127:Times:B:indicate  that  there  is  little  evidence  of  this  type  of  escalation,  at  least  once  one  compares  
26:633:56675:29:30:85:505:588:127:Times:127:Times:B:states  to  others  in  their  same  region.25    In short, while we find some suggestive evidence 
26:634:56774:30:29:85:444:558:127:Times:127:Times:B:of escalation by criminals, the evidence is far from conclusive.                     
26:635:56858:29:29:85:504:529:127:Times:127:Times:B:  Finally, we turn to evidence on whether the laws increase the reported number of 
26:636:56939:29:30:85:507:500:127:Times:127:Times:B:justifiable  homicides.    The  problem  with  these  data  is  that  justifiable  homicides  are  
26:637:57038:30:29:85:504:470:127:Times:127:Times:B:believed to be underreported: Kleck (1988) estimates that only one-fifth of legally justified 
26:638:57132:29:29:85:507:441:127:Times:127:Times:B:homicides  by  civilians  are  reported.    However,  even  though  the  level  of  justifiable  
26:639:57229:29:30:85:506:412:127:Times:127:Times:B:homicides  may  be  underreported,  relative changes  in  justifiable  homicide  may  still  be  
26:640:57326:30:29:85:507:382:127:Times:127:Times:B:informative.    As  a  result,  we  focus  on  examining  the  relative  increase  in  reported  
26:641:57423:29:30:85:506:353:127:Times:127:Times:B:justifiable  homicide,  and  then  estimate  how  many  additional  legally  justified  homicides  
26:642:57522:30:29:85:498:323:127:Times:127:Times:B:there really are by scaling the pre-castle doctrine figure by estimates of underreporting.       
26:643:57619:29:29:85:505:294:127:Times:127:Times:B:    Results  are  shown  in  Panels  C,  D,  and  E  of  Table  6.      Panel  C  shows  estimates  
26:644:57719:29:30:85:504:265:127:Times:127:Times:B:from  population-weighted  regressions  in  which  the  number  of  justifiable  homicides  is  the  
26:645:57820:30:29:85:504:235:127:Times:127:Times:B:dependent  variable.      Results  range  from  1  to  9  additional  justifiable  homicides,  which  is  
26:646:57926:29:29:85:504:206:127:Times:127:Times:B:relative to a baseline population-weighted average of 10.0 justifiable homicides per state in 
26:647:58020:29:29:85:504:177:127:Times:127:Times:B:the year prior to castle doctrine enactment.    Thus, the estimate when controlling for only 
26:648:58113:29:7:85:223:148:98:g_d0_f3:98:g_d0_f3:F:                                                               
26:649:58176:7:13:85:504:141:32:Times:72:Times:F:24   We  also  look  at  the  proportion  of  assaults  in  which  a  gun  was  used  and  find  no  evidence  of  an  increase,  though  the  
26:650:58319:13:10:85:504:128:72:Times:72:Times:F:baseline rate is small (3 percent).    We also note that examining these ratios as outcome variables could be problematic if 
26:651:58444:10:10:85:504:118:72:Times:72:Times:F:the  laws  were  found  to  reduce  robbery  or  aggravated  assault.      However,  as  we  show  in  Table  4  there  is  no  effect  on  
26:652:58584:10:10:85:91:108:72:Times:32:Times:F:robberies or aggravated assaults.     25
26:653:58624:10:9:91:503:98:72:Times:72:Times:F:   It  is  difficult  to  think  of  how  using  other  FBI  classifications could help answer this question.    For example, the FBI 
26:654:58758:9:10:85:503:89:72:Times:72:Times:F:classifies some non-felony-type homicides as having originated in an argument.    It is difficult to know, however, whether 
26:655:58882:10:10:85:503:79:72:Times:72:Times:F:the argument would have resulted in serious injury to the killer, had that person not used lethal force, or if the argument 
26:656:59006:10:0:85:503:69:72:Times:72:Times:F:escalated from, say, a fistfight into a homicide.    Yet most would agree that the latter is more disturbing than the former.     
27:657:59140:0:29:85:506:705:127:Times:127:Times:B:state  and  year  fixed  effects  suggests  that  there  is  a  statistically  significant  90  percent  
27:658:59245:29:30:85:504:676:127:Times:127:Times:B:increase  in  justifiable  homicide  as  a  result  of  the  law,  though  we  note  that  the  estimate  in  
27:659:59355:30:29:85:505:646:127:Times:127:Times:B:our  preferred  specification  in  column  3  is  4.6,  is  statistically  significant  at  the  10  percent  
27:660:59465:29:29:85:303:617:127:Times:127:Times:B:level, and represents a 46 percent increase.26   
27:661:59514:29:30:85:505:588:127:Times:127:Times:B:    Panel  D  shows  estimates  from  unweighted  regressions  of  similar  form.      Results  
27:662:59610:30:29:85:504:558:127:Times:127:Times:B:range  from  1  to  4.3  additional  justifiable  homicides  per  state  per  year  as  a  result  of  castle  
27:663:59721:29:29:85:505:529:127:Times:127:Times:B:doctrine.      The  estimate  in  our  preferred  specification  is  3.4,  is  statistically  significant  at  
27:664:59832:29:30:85:503:500:127:Times:127:Times:B:the 5 percent level, and represents a 70 percent increase over the pre-castle doctrine average 
27:665:59927:30:29:85:264:470:127:Times:127:Times:B:of 4.9 justifiable homicides per year.     
27:666:59970:29:29:85:504:441:127:Times:127:Times:B:  Panel E reports estimates from a negative binomial model.    Estimates range from 
27:667:60052:29:30:85:504:412:127:Times:127:Times:B:an insignificant 22 percent increase to a significant 57 percent increase in column 1, which 
27:668:60145:30:29:85:325:382:127:Times:127:Times:B:does not control for region-by-year fixed effects.       
27:669:60202:29:30:85:506:353:127:Times:127:Times:B:    Using  these  estimates,  we  now  turn  to  assessing  whether  the  relative  increases  
27:670:60297:30:29:85:505:323:127:Times:127:Times:B:observed  in  Table  6  can  explain  the  entire  increase  in  homicide,  given  estimates  of  the  
27:671:60400:29:29:85:507:294:127:Times:127:Times:B:degree  of  underreporting  of  legally  justified  homicide.    The  largest  estimated  relative  
27:672:60500:29:30:85:504:265:127:Times:127:Times:B:increase from a specification in Table 6 that controls for region-by-year fixed effects is 70 
27:673:60594:30:29:85:503:235:127:Times:127:Times:B:percent, which is relative to a baseline total of 103 justifiable homicides across the 21 states 
27:674:60691:29:29:85:504:206:127:Times:127:Times:B:in  the  year  prior  to  castle  doctrine  enactment.      We  assume  that  i)  police  departments  are  
27:675:60799:29:30:85:504:177:127:Times:127:Times:B:not less likely to report an otherwise-identical homicide as justifiable after castle doctrine, 
27:676:60895:30:29:85:504:147:127:Times:127:Times:B:and ii) the relative increase in legally justified homicide due to castle doctrine is no lower 
27:677:60990:29:29:85:507:118:127:Times:127:Times:B:for  reporting  agencies  than  for  non-reporting  agencies.    We  view  the  first  of  these  
27:678:61088:29:10:85:91:89:98:g_d0_f3:32:Times:F:                                                               26
27:679:61153:10:10:91:474:79:72:Times:72:Times:F:  In contrast, we find no evidence of an increase in justifiable homicide by police, consistent with the identifying 
27:680:61270:10:0:85:321:69:72:Times:72:Times:F:assumption.    Results are shown in Table A2 of the web appendix.     
28:681:61344:0:29:85:503:705:127:Times:127:Times:B:assumptions as likely to hold, and the second as reasonable, though we emphasize that they 
28:682:61435:29:30:85:506:676:127:Times:127:Times:B:are  in  fact  assumptions.    Combining  these  assumptions  with  our  estimates  in  Table  5  
28:683:61533:30:29:85:505:646:127:Times:127:Times:B:suggests that the true castle-doctrine-induced relative increase in legally justified homicide 
28:684:61628:29:29:85:351:617:127:Times:127:Times:B:across the 21 states should be no larger than 70 percent.     
28:685:61690:29:30:85:504:588:127:Times:127:Times:B:  Kleck (1988) reports that approximately one-fifth of legally justified homicides are 
28:686:61775:30:29:85:505:558:127:Times:127:Times:B:reported  correctly,  while  the  others  are  classified  as  homicides.      Given  the  103  reported  
28:687:61881:29:29:85:505:529:127:Times:127:Times:B:pre-castle  doctrine  justifiable  homicides,  that  suggests  that  the  true  figure  is  515.      A  70  
28:688:61990:29:30:85:507:500:127:Times:127:Times:B:percent  increase  means  that  castle  doctrine  causes  an  additional  361  legally  justified  
28:689:62089:30:29:85:504:470:127:Times:127:Times:B:homicides,  of  which  289  (80  percent)  would  be  (mis)reported  as  homicides.      Recall  that  
28:690:62192:29:29:85:506:441:127:Times:127:Times:B:estimates  from  Table  5  indicate  that  castle  doctrine  causes  approximately  an  8  percent  
28:691:62292:29:30:85:506:412:127:Times:127:Times:B:increase  in  homicide,  which  translates  to  an  additional  611  homicides  given  the  7,632  
28:692:62391:30:29:85:506:382:127:Times:127:Times:B:pre-castle  doctrine  homicides.    Thus,  under  these  assumptions,  our  best  guess  is  that  
28:693:62490:29:30:85:495:353:127:Times:127:Times:B:around half of the additional homicides caused by castle doctrine were legally justified.     
28:694:62584:30:29:85:508:323:127:Times:127:Times:B:    Of  course,  different  assumptions  yield  different  conclusions.    For  example,  
28:695:62674:29:29:85:504:294:127:Times:127:Times:B:assuming  that  only  10  percent  of  legally  justified  homicides  are  reported  correctly,  along  
28:696:62778:29:30:85:506:265:127:Times:127:Times:B:with  a  70  percent  relative  increase  and  the  second  assumption  outlined  above,  would  
28:697:62875:30:29:85:394:235:127:Times:127:Times:B:suggest that all of the additional homicides were legally justified.     
28:698:62948:29:29:85:510:206:127:Times:127:Times:B:  In summary, we find no evidence that strengthening self-defense law deters crime.   
28:699:63032:29:30:85:504:177:127:Times:127:Times:B:On the other hand, we find that a primary consequence of castle doctrine laws is to increase 
28:700:63125:30:29:85:507:147:127:Times:127:Times:B:homicide  by  a  statistically  and  economically  significant  7  to  10  percent.    Relative  
28:701:63222:29:29:85:506:118:127:Times:127:Times:B:increases  in  justifiable  homicide  along  with  Kleck’s  (1988)  estimate  of  the  degree  of  
28:702:63321:29:0:85:504:89:127:Times:127:Times:B:underreporting suggest that it is unlikely, but not impossible, for the increase in homicides 
29:703:63419:0:29:85:506:705:127:Times:127:Times:B:to  consist  entirely  of  legally  justified  homicides.    We  emphasize,  however,  that  one’s  
29:704:63519:29:30:85:508:676:127:Times:127:Times:B:conclusion   on   that   issue   depends   on   assumptions   about   the   nature   and   degree   of   
29:705:63624:30:29:85:315:646:127:Times:127:Times:B:underreporting of legally justified homicides.         
29:706:63679:29:30:85:88:617:127:Times:127:Times:B: 
29:707:63679:30:29:85:164:587:127:Times:127:Times:B:5.    Conclusion  
29:708:63697:29:29:122:505:558:127:Times:127:Times:A:In  recent  years,  more  than  20  states  have  strengthened  their  self-defense  laws  by  
29:709:63792:29:29:85:503:529:127:Times:127:Times:B:adopting castle doctrine laws.    These statutes widen the scope for the justified use of lethal 
29:710:63889:29:30:85:504:500:127:Times:127:Times:B:force in self-defense by stating the circumstances under which self-defense is justified and 
29:711:63982:30:29:85:504:470:127:Times:127:Times:B:removing the duty to retreat from a list of protected places outside the home.    In addition, 
29:712:64077:29:29:85:510:441:127:Times:127:Times:B:in  some  cases  they  establish  a  presumption  of  reasonableness  and  remove  civil  liability.     
29:713:64182:29:30:85:493:412:127:Times:127:Times:B:Thus, these laws could hypothetically deter crime or, alternatively, increase homicide.       
29:714:64276:30:29:85:514:382:127:Times:127:Times:B:         Results   presented   indicate   that   castle   doctrine   law   does   not   deter   crime.      
29:715:64384:29:30:85:505:353:127:Times:127:Times:B:Furthermore, our estimates are sufficiently precise as to rule out moderate-sized deterrence 
29:716:64477:30:29:85:504:323:127:Times:127:Times:B:effects.    Thus, while our view is that it is a priori reasonable to expect that strengthening 
29:717:64573:29:29:85:386:294:127:Times:127:Times:B:self-defense law would deter crime, we find this is not the case.     
29:718:64643:29:30:125:509:265:127:Times:127:Times:A:More   significantly,   results   indicate   that   castle   doctrine   laws   increase   total   
29:719:64741:30:29:85:507:235:127:Times:127:Times:B:homicides  by  around  8  percent.    Put  differently,  the  laws  induce  an  additional  600  
29:720:64838:29:29:85:511:206:127:Times:127:Times:B:homicides  per  year  across  the  21  states  in  our  sample  that  enacted  castle  doctrine  laws.     
29:721:64945:29:30:85:506:177:127:Times:127:Times:B:This  finding  is  robust  to  a  wide  set  of  difference-in-differences  specifications,  including  
29:722:65049:30:29:85:504:147:127:Times:127:Times:B:region-by-year fixed effects, state-specific linear time trends, and controls for time-varying 
29:723:65144:29:29:85:504:118:127:Times:127:Times:B:factors such as economic conditions, state welfare spending, and policing and incarceration 
29:724:65236:29:0:85:505:89:127:Times:127:Times:B:rates.    These  findings  provide  evidence  that  lowering  the  expected  cost  of  lethal  force  
30:725:65342:0:29:85:229:705:127:Times:127:Times:B:causes there to be more of it.     
30:726:65377:29:30:125:506:676:127:Times:127:Times:A:A  critical  question  is  whether  all  of  the  additional  homicides  that  occur  were  
30:727:65469:30:29:85:505:646:127:Times:127:Times:B:legally  justified.      Using  results  on  the  effect  of  the  laws  on  justifiable  homicide,  along  
30:728:65577:29:29:85:505:617:127:Times:127:Times:B:with  assumptions  about  the  degree  to  which  justifiable  homicides  are  underreported,  we  
30:729:65676:29:30:85:505:588:127:Times:127:Times:B:report back-of-the-envelope calculations that make it difficult to explain the entire increase 
30:730:65771:30:29:85:504:558:127:Times:127:Times:B:in homicide with an increase in legally justified homicide.    Our view is that this provides 
30:731:65865:29:29:85:506:529:127:Times:127:Times:B:suggestive evidence that at least some of the additional homicides were not legally justified, 
30:732:65960:29:30:85:504:500:127:Times:127:Times:B:though  we  emphasize  that  conclusions  on  this  issue  depend  on  assumptions  regarding  the  
30:733:66060:30:29:85:479:470:127:Times:127:Times:B:degree and nature of the underreporting of justifiable homicide by police to the FBI.     
30:734:66150:29:29:125:505:441:127:Times:127:Times:A:   With  respect  to  policy,  our  findings  suggest  that  an  informed  debate  over  these  
30:735:66246:29:30:85:506:412:127:Times:127:Times:B:laws  will  weigh  the  increased  protections  given  to  victims  against  the  net  increase  in  
30:736:66347:30:29:85:503:382:127:Times:127:Times:B:violent deaths that result.    More broadly, our findings indicate that incentives and expected 
30:737:66443:29:30:85:428:353:127:Times:127:Times:B:costs matter when it comes to the decision of whether to use lethal force.
