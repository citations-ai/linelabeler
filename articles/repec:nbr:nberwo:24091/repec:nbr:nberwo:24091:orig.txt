2:38:2302:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:We  study  the  relationship  between  homebuyers'  beliefs  about  future  house  price  changes  and 
2:39:2405:14:14:72:545:574:12:Times:12:Times:their mortgage  leverage  choices.  From  a  theoretical  perspective,  whether  more  pessimistic 
2:40:2503:14:14:72:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:homebuyers choose  more  or  less  leverage  is  ambiguous  and  depends  on  their  willingness  to 
2:41:2603:14:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:reduce  the  size  of  their housing  investment.  When  households  primarily  maximize  the  levered 
2:42:2705:14:14:72:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:return  of  their  property  investment, more  pessimistic  homebuyers  reduce  their  leverage  to 
2:43:2804:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:purchase  smaller  houses.  On  the  other  hand, when  considerations  such  as  family  size  pin  down 
2:44:2909:14:14:72:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:the desired property size, pessimistic homebuyers reduce their financial exposure to the housing 
2:45:3005:14:14:72:546:490:12:Times:12:Times:market  by  making  smaller  downpayments  to  buy  similarly-sized homes.  To  determine  which 
2:46:3101:14:14:72:546:476:12:Times:12:Times:scenario  better  describes  the  data,  we  empirically  investigate  the  cross-sectional relationship 
2:47:3205:14:14:72:545:462:12:Times:12:g_d0_f1:between  beliefs  and  leverage  choices  in  the  U.S.  housing  market.  Our  data  combine  mortgage 
2:48:3308:14:14:72:546:448:12:Times:12:g_d0_f1:financing information and a housing market expectations survey with anonymized social network 
2:49:3401:14:14:72:546:434:12:Times:12:Times:data from Facebook. The survey shows that an individual's belief distribution about future house 
2:50:3498:14:14:72:546:420:12:Times:12:Times:price changes  is  affected  by  the  recent  house  price  experiences  of  her  geographically  distant 
2:51:3603:14:14:72:545:406:12:Times:12:Times:friends,  allowing us  to  use  these  experiences  as  quasi-exogenous  shifters  of  individuals'  house 
2:52:3709:14:14:72:546:392:12:Times:12:Times:price beliefs. We find that more pessimistic homebuyers make smaller downpayments and choose 
2:53:3801:14:14:72:546:378:12:Times:12:Times:higher  leverage,  in  particular in  states  where  default  costs  are  relatively  low,  as  well  as  during 
2:54:3913:14:14:72:545:364:12:Times:12:Times:periods when house prices are expected to fall on average. Overall, our results provide evidence 
2:55:4009:14:14:72:542:350:12:Times:12:Times:for  an  important  role  of  heterogeneous  beliefs in  explaining  individuals'  financial  decision-
2:56:4111:14:38:72:111:336:12:Times:12:Times:making.

3:81:4531:0:15:75:553:729:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Aggregate leverage ratios in the economy vary substantially over time and play a key role in driving economic
3:82:4640:15:16:60:553:714:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:fluctuations (see Krishnamurthy and Muir, 2016; Mian, Sufi and Verner, 2016). Understanding the determinants of
3:83:4751:16:16:60:553:698:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:investors’ leverage choices is therefore a question of central economic importance. Leverage choices in the housing
3:84:4866:16:15:60:553:682:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:market are of particular interest to policy makers (see DeFusco, Johnson and Mondragon, 2017): mortgages are
3:85:4974:15:16:60:553:667:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the primary liability on households’ balance sheets, and increased household leverage plays a key role in many
3:86:5084:16:16:60:553:651:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:accounts of the recent Financial Crisis (e.g., Mian and Sufi, 2009). In this paper, we explore the role of homebuyers’
3:87:5202:16:15:60:484:635:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:beliefs about house price growth as one potential determinant of their mortgage leverage choices.
3:88:5299:15:16:75:553:620:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We first develop a parsimonious model that characterizes the channels through which homebuyers’ beliefs
3:89:5402:16:16:60:553:604:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:about future house price growth can affect their mortgage leverage choices. We show that the direction of the
3:90:5511:16:15:60:553:588:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:combined effect of beliefs on leverage choices is ambiguous, and depends on the willingness of relatively pessimistic
3:91:5628:15:16:60:553:573:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:homebuyers to reduce the size of their housing market investment by either renting or buying a smaller house in a
3:92:5741:16:16:60:553:557:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:cheaper neighborhood. We then empirically investigate the relationship between homebuyers’ beliefs about future
3:93:5852:16:15:60:552:541:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:house price growth and their leverage choices, and find that more pessimistic homebuyers take on more leverage.
3:94:5963:15:16:75:553:526:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Our model adapts the portfolio choice framework of Geanakoplos (2010) and Simsek (2013) to the housing
3:95:6065:16:16:60:553:510:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:market. We consider individuals who optimally choose non-housing consumption in addition to home size and
3:96:6170:16:15:60:553:494:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:mortgage leverage given a schedule of loan-to-value ratios and interest rates offered by lenders.  Introducing
3:97:6280:15:16:60:553:479:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:consumption as an additional choice margin allows households to separately determine the size of their home and
3:98:6391:16:16:60:553:463:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:their leverage. House price beliefs affect leverage choices through two forces. The first force works through the
3:99:6504:16:15:60:553:447:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:perceived expected return on housing investments (“expected return force”). More optimistic agents want to buy
3:100:6614:15:16:60:553:432:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:larger houses, since they expect each dollar invested in housing to earn a higher return. In order to afford the larger
3:101:6733:16:16:60:553:416:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:home, they need to further lever up their fixed resources. The second force works through the protection against
3:102:6845:16:15:60:553:400:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:house price declines offered by the ability to default on mortgages (“downpayment protection force”).1Holding
3:103:6954:15:16:60:553:385:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:house size fixed, more pessimistic agents, who perceive a higher probability of defaulting on their mortgage, choose
3:104:7070:16:16:60:520:369:10:g_d0_f2:7:g_d0_f3:lower downpayments and higher leverage to limit the potential loss of their own funds in case of default.2
3:105:7176:16:15:75:553:353:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Our model captures an additional important feature of housing markets.  Since owner-occupied housing is
3:106:7279:15:16:60:553:338:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:both an investment and a consumption good, the optimal home is not just determined by homebuyers’ investment
3:107:7387:16:16:60:553:322:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:motives, but also by consumption-driven motives such as family size and neighborhood preferences. This introduces
3:108:7500:16:15:60:554:306:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:a“collateral adjustment friction”that reduces homebuyers’ willingness to adjust their property size in response to
3:109:7614:15:16:60:553:291:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:changes in house price beliefs.3For example, a large collateral adjustment friction could be the result of pessimists
3:110:7731:16:16:60:553:275:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:not being willing to purchase in a less-safe neighborhood, or not wanting to buy a much smaller house. Our main
3:111:7842:16:15:60:553:259:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:theoretical result is to show that the strength of this friction is central to determining the relationship between
3:112:7957:15:16:60:358:244:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:homebuyers’ house price beliefs and their mortgage leverage choices.
3:113:8025:16:16:75:553:228:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We highlight the key mechanisms in our model by considering two polar scenarios for which we can obtain
3:114:8128:16:14:60:554:212:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:explicit analytical results.  We first consider ahousing-as-investmentscenario in which there is no collateral
3:115:8238:14:13:71:553:198:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:1We show that this force is active independent of whether mortgage default is primarily strategic, with homeowners defaulting
3:116:8363:13:9:60:553:185:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:as soon as their home is sufficiently “underwater,” or whether mortgage default only occurs when households also receive a negative
3:117:8494:9:7:60:413:176:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:income shock that makes it impossible for them to continue their monthly mortgage payments.
3:118:8585:7:12:71:553:169:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:2As will become evident below, an equivalent exposition of the second force describes pessimists as perceiving a lower marginal
3:119:8712:12:7:60:537:157:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:cost of borrowing, since they expect to repay their loan in fewer states of the world. This makes higher leverage more appealing.
3:120:8841:7:12:71:553:150:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:3We use the term friction to capture any force that reduces the willingness of individuals to adjust their exposure to the housing
3:121:8971:12:9:60:553:138:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:collateral for pure investment motives. In our setting, this force comes from the preferences of homebuyers, who view their house not
3:122:9104:9:10:60:553:129:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:just as an investment, but also as a place to live, which puts additional constraints on house size. Our discussion of the collateral
3:123:9237:10:9:60:553:119:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:adjustment friction focuses on the intensive margin of housing investment. In housing markets, renting rather than buying can give
3:124:9367:9:10:60:553:110:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:individuals the option to separate their decision of what house to live in from the decision of the size of their housing market investment.
3:125:9507:10:9:60:553:100:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:However, in many cases, the set of properties available for rent is very different from the set of properties available for sale; indeed, large
3:126:9650:9:10:60:553:91:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:single-family residences are almost exclusively owner-occupied. Therefore, reducing one’s housing market exposure through renting
3:127:9779:10:9:60:553:81:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:will usually also involve a potentially costly adjustment to the type of housing that can be consumed. This force will have the same
3:128:9911:9:0:60:398:72:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:effect as the collateral adjustment friction we consider for the intensive margin adjustment.
4:129:10005:0:15:60:553:729:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:adjustment friction and property size and leverage are determined by both the expected return force and the
4:130:10112:15:16:60:553:714:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:downpayment protection force. Under the appropriate definition of optimism, this scenario recovers the predictions
4:131:10226:16:16:60:553:698:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:from the portfolio choice problem in Simsek (2013): more pessimistic homebuyers reduce their leverage to purchase
4:132:10339:16:15:60:476:682:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:smaller houses because the expected return force dominates the downpayment protection force.
4:133:10431:15:16:75:554:667:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We then consider ahousing-as-consumptionscenario, in which the size of the housing investment is completely
4:134:10538:16:16:60:553:651:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:pinned down by factors such as family size, and households allocate their resources between consumption and
4:135:10645:16:15:60:553:635:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:making a downpayment to purchase the house.  In this scenario, which corresponds to an infinite collateral
4:136:10751:15:16:60:553:620:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:adjustment friction, the expected return force is inactive, but the downpayment protection force continues to
4:137:10860:16:16:60:553:604:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:operate. As a result, more pessimistic agents make smaller downpayments to protect their assets against losses
4:138:10970:16:15:60:553:588:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:in case of house price declines. In particular, a pessimistic homebuyer might think: “I need at least a 3-bedroom
4:139:11083:15:16:60:553:573:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:house given my family size, but I think house prices are likely to fall, so I do not want to invest much of my own
4:140:11197:16:16:60:553:557:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:money.” Such a borrower would then naturally choose higher leverage. As a reader explained to the Washington
4:141:11305:16:15:60:553:541:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Post (2011): “An acquaintance once told me he doesn’t believe in putting much money down on a mortgage loan
4:142:11412:15:16:60:553:526:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:because that way he can ‘just walk away’ if things ever get bad. And walk away he did. His property is now in
4:143:11521:16:16:60:551:510:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:foreclosure.” In the paper, we provide extensive evidence for the prevalence of such thinking among homebuyers.
4:144:11632:16:15:75:553:494:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:When we move away from these polar cases, whether more pessimistic agents take on more or less leverage
4:145:11735:15:16:60:553:479:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:depends on the magnitude of the collateral adjustment friction that captures the extent to which optimal home
4:146:11844:16:16:60:553:463:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:size is determined by investment or consumption motives. The empirical contribution of this paper is to investigate
4:147:11959:16:15:60:553:447:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:which of these forces dominates in practice. This analysis faces a number of challenges. Testing the implications of
4:148:12075:15:16:60:553:432:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:models with belief heterogeneity is difficult because individuals’ beliefs are high-dimensional and hard-to-observe
4:149:12190:16:16:60:553:416:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:objects. In addition, even if we could cleanly elicit homebuyers’ house price beliefs, we rarely observe forces that
4:150:12306:16:15:60:553:400:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:induce heterogeneity in these beliefs without also inducing variation in their economic resources or other variables
4:151:12422:15:16:60:296:385:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:that might independently affect their leverage choices.
4:152:12477:16:16:75:553:369:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Our empirical approach builds on Bailey et al. (2017a), who document that the recent house price experiences
4:153:12585:16:15:60:553:353:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:in an individual’s geographically distant social network affect her beliefs about the attractiveness of local housing
4:154:12702:15:16:60:553:338:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:market investments. Indeed, we verify that the recent house price experiences of geographically distant friends
4:155:12813:16:16:60:553:322:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:can be used as shifters of individuals’ beliefs about the distribution of expected future house price changes. We
4:156:12926:16:15:60:553:306:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:also show that friends’ house price experiences are unlikely to affect leverage choices through channels other than
4:157:13041:15:16:60:553:291:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:beliefs. This allows us to explore the empirical relationship between beliefs and leverage by analyzing the cross-
4:158:13155:16:16:60:553:275:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:sectional relationship between the leverage choices of individuals borrowing from the same lender to purchase
4:159:13264:16:15:60:553:259:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:homes at the same time and in the same neighborhood, and the house price experiences of these homebuyers’
4:160:13369:15:16:60:191:244:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:geographically distant friends.
4:161:13400:16:16:75:553:228:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:In our data, we observe an anonymized snapshot of U.S. individuals’ friendship networks on Facebook, the
4:162:13504:16:15:60:553:212:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:largest online social network, with over 231 million users in the U.S. and Canada. Our first empirical step combines
4:163:13620:15:16:60:553:197:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:these data with responses to a housing market expectation survey that was conducted by Facebook in April 2017.
4:164:13730:16:16:60:553:181:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:The survey, which targeted Facebook users in Los Angeles through their News Feeds, elicited a distribution
4:165:13836:16:15:60:553:165:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of respondents’ expectations for future house price changes in their own zip codes.  Individuals whose friends
4:166:13946:15:16:60:553:150:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:experienced more recent house price increases expect higher average future house price growth. Quantitatively, a
4:167:14058:16:16:60:553:134:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:one-percentage-point higher house price appreciation among an individual’s friends over the previous 24 months
4:168:14168:16:15:60:553:118:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:is associated with individuals expecting a 33 basis points higher house price growth over the subsequent year. We
4:169:14281:15:16:60:553:103:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:also find that individuals whose friends experienced more heterogeneous recent house price changes report a more
4:170:14393:16:16:60:553:87:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:dispersed distribution of expected future house price growth. This suggests that the house price experiences within
4:171:14508:16:0:60:553:71:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:an individual’s social network do not just affect her beliefs on average, but that other moments of the distribution
5:172:14625:0:15:60:419:729:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of friends’ experiences affect the corresponding moments of the belief distribution.
5:173:14709:15:16:75:553:714:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:To study the role of house price beliefs in shaping mortgage leverage choice, we match anonymized social
5:174:14813:16:16:60:553:698:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:network data on Facebook users from 2,900 U.S. zip codes to public record housing deeds data, which contain
5:175:14920:16:15:60:553:682:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:information on both transaction prices and mortgage choices. We observe information on homebuyers’ leverage
5:176:15027:15:16:60:388:667:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:choices for about 1.35 million housing transactions between 2008 and 2014.
5:177:15101:16:16:75:553:651:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We first test the predictions of our model under the assumption that beliefs over future house price changes are
5:178:15213:16:15:60:553:635:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:normally distributed.4We find that individuals whose friends have experienced lower recent house price growth,
5:179:15323:15:16:60:553:620:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:and who are thus more pessimistic about future house price growth, take on more leverage. Quantitatively, a one-
5:180:15435:16:16:60:553:604:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:percentage-point decrease in the average house price experiences among an individual’s friends over the prior two
5:181:15548:16:15:60:553:588:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:years is associated with an increase in the loan-to-value ratio of about 9 basis points. Combined with the estimates
5:182:15664:15:16:60:553:573:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:from the survey, this suggests that a one-percentage-point decrease in the expected house price appreciation over
5:183:15777:16:16:60:553:557:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the next twelve months leads individuals to increase their loan-to-value ratio by 26 basis points. These findings are
5:184:15894:16:15:60:553:541:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:aligned with the predictions of the housing-as-consumption scenario, and suggest a sizable collateral adjustment
5:185:16006:15:16:60:553:526:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:friction in the choice of financing owner-occupied housing. Consistent with predictions from this scenario, we also
5:186:16121:16:16:60:553:510:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:find that a higher cross-sectional variance of friends’ house price experiences is associated with choosing higher
5:187:16235:16:15:60:553:494:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:leverage: holding mean beliefs fixed, individuals who have a more dispersed belief distribution perceive a higher
5:188:16348:15:16:60:318:479:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:probability of default, and thus reduce their downpayment.
5:189:16406:16:16:75:553:463:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We test a number of additional predictions from the model about the relationship between beliefs and leverage
5:190:16515:16:15:60:553:447:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:choice in the housing-as-consumption scenario. First, the model suggests that the effects of beliefs on leverage
5:191:16627:15:16:60:553:432:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:choices should be particularly large when the cost of default is relatively small, so that household would consider
5:192:16742:16:16:60:553:416:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:defaulting in response to declining house prices a less costly proposition.  Consistent with this, we find that
5:193:16853:16:15:60:553:400:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:more pessimistic individuals in non-recourse states, where lenders cannot recover losses on a mortgage by going
5:194:16964:15:16:60:553:385:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:after borrowers’ non-housing assets, are more likely to reduce their downpayments than pessimistic individuals in
5:195:17077:16:16:60:553:369:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:recourse states, where the ability of lenders to go after non-housing assets translates into a higher cost of default.
5:196:17195:16:15:75:553:353:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Second, in the housing-as-consumption scenario, changes in beliefs have larger effects on leverage choices
5:197:17301:15:16:60:553:338:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:for individuals that are relatively pessimistic to begin with. This is because, in this scenario, the key driver of
5:198:17416:16:16:60:553:322:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:differences in leverage choice is disagreement about the probability of default. Following large house price increases,
5:199:17535:16:15:60:553:306:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:even relatively pessimistic individuals assign small probabilities to default states of the world. The quantitative
5:200:17650:15:16:60:553:291:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:effects of cross-sectional differences in beliefs on optimal leverage are therefore relatively small. Consistent with
5:201:17767:16:16:60:553:275:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:this, we find the magnitude of the relationship between house price beliefs and leverage choice to be the strongest
5:202:17882:16:15:60:494:259:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:among individuals who are relatively more pessimistic and during periods of declining house prices.
5:203:17981:15:16:75:553:244:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Third, the relative strength of the downpayment protection force compared to the expected return force
5:204:18083:16:16:60:553:228:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:should be increasing in the collateral adjustment friction faced by homebuyers.  Consistent with this, we find
5:205:18193:16:15:60:553:212:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:that pessimists reduce their downpayment more when buying homes in areas with a high homeownership rate,
5:206:18297:15:16:60:553:197:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:where they have fewer opportunities to reduce their exposure to the housing market by renting instead of buying.
5:207:18409:16:16:75:553:181:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Throughout the analysis, we argue that the house price experiences of a homebuyer’s geographically distant
5:208:18515:16:15:60:553:165:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:friends affect her mortgage leverage choice only through influencing her beliefs about future house price changes.
5:209:18629:15:16:60:553:150:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We rule out other channels that could have explained the observed relationship. For example, we show that the
5:210:18738:16:16:60:553:134:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:results are not driven by wealth effects whereby a higher house price appreciation in areas where an individual has
5:211:18853:16:15:60:553:118:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:friends increases her resources for making downpayments. Our results are also not explained by correlated shocks
5:212:18965:15:15:60:507:103:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:to individuals and their friends, or by individuals learning about the cost of default from their friends.
5:213:19071:15:12:71:553:88:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:4By studying the case of normally distributed beliefs, we can derive unambiguous predictions for changes in the level and dispersion
5:214:19203:12:10:60:553:76:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:of beliefs (the mean and standard deviation of beliefs about house price growth). Our non-parametric results highlight the importance
5:215:19336:10:0:60:519:66:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:of using the appropriate definitions of optimism to generate unambiguous predictions about the effect of beliefs on leverage.
6:216:19462:0:15:75:553:729:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We provide ancillary for the mechanisms described above. First, we show that, in a correlational sense, the
6:217:19569:15:16:60:553:714:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:negative relationship between optimism and leverage can also be detected in the New York Fed Survey of Consumer
6:218:19680:16:16:60:553:698:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Expectations. Second, we conduct an additional survey on SurveyMonkey in which we presented 1,600 individuals
6:219:19789:16:15:60:553:682:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:with hypothetical house price scenarios, and asked them to recommend a mortgage option to a friend who has
6:220:19895:15:16:60:553:667:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:already decided on a particular house to buy. Survey respondents were more likely to recommend making smaller
6:221:20004:16:16:60:553:651:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:downpayments under scenarios with a higher probability of large house price declines, even though this entailed
6:222:20115:16:15:60:553:635:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:paying higher interest rates. When asked to explain their reasoning, many individuals described a thought process
6:223:20228:15:16:60:553:620:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:consistent with the downpayment protection force (e.g., “If he defaults and housing prices decrease so that he
6:224:20338:16:16:60:553:604:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:cannot sell to recoup his investment, he loses less deposit if he puts less down”).  We also document that a
6:225:20446:16:15:60:553:588:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:similar logic is often described on financial advice websites and blogs that discuss what downpayments individuals
6:226:20560:15:16:60:553:573:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:should make. We then show that many individuals do not consider mortgage default particularly costly, another
6:227:20669:16:16:60:553:557:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:requirement for a strong downpayment protection force. Lastly, we present evidence for a substantial collateral
6:228:20780:16:15:60:554:541:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:adjustment friction. In particular, we explore Zillow’sConsumer Housing Trends Report 2017, which highlights how
6:229:20892:15:16:60:553:526:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:consumption aspects such as location and home size are usually the most important determinants of individuals’
6:230:21002:16:16:60:409:510:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:property choice, and that potential investment returns are much less important.
6:231:21081:16:15:75:553:494:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Overall, our evidence points to an important role for house price beliefs in determining individuals’ mortgage
6:232:21191:15:16:60:553:479:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:leverage choices. In the presence of sizable collateral adjustment frictions, more pessimistic individuals do not
6:233:21304:16:16:60:553:463:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:buy substantially smaller houses, but instead reduce their exposure to the housing market by making a smaller
6:234:21413:16:15:60:422:447:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:downpayment, particularly when the costs of mortgage default are relatively small.
6:235:21495:15:16:75:553:432:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Our paper contributes to the theoretical literature on collateralized credit with heterogeneous beliefs developed
6:236:21608:16:16:60:553:416:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:by Geanakoplos (1997, 2003, 2010) and Fostel and Geanakoplos (2008, 2012, 2015, 2016).5Within that literature,
6:237:21718:16:15:60:553:400:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:which has focused on environments in which investors exclusively make levered purchases of risky assets, our
6:238:21826:15:16:60:553:385:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:model is most closely related to the baseline environment studied by Simsek (2013).  We show that the same
6:239:21932:16:16:60:553:369:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:theoretical framework can deliver new predictions when (i) an additional margin of adjustment — a consumption-
6:240:22042:16:15:60:553:353:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:savings decision — is introduced, and (ii) homebuyers’ housing choices are not exclusively driven by the pecuniary
6:241:22156:15:16:60:553:338:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:investment return on housing. We operationalize the theory by developing implementable tests of how borrowers’
6:242:22266:16:16:60:553:322:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:beliefs affect their leverage choices. Our results provide support for theories in which investors’ beliefs are an
6:243:22380:16:15:60:553:306:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:important determinant of individual and aggregate behavior, and are complementary to the findings of Koudijs
6:244:22488:15:16:60:493:291:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:and Voth (2016), who document the positive relation between lenders’ optimism and high leverage.
6:245:22584:16:16:75:553:275:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Our theoretical observation that the relationship between borrowers’ beliefs and leverage choices depends on the
6:246:22696:16:15:60:553:259:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:magnitude of the collateral adjustment friction is likely to be important across a number of other settings. In the
6:247:22811:15:16:60:553:244:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:housing market, the consumption aspect of housing reduces households’ desire to adjust the size of their housing
6:248:22923:16:16:60:553:228:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:market investment based on their beliefs about future house price growth.  In a similar way, firms borrowing
6:249:23031:16:15:60:553:212:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:against their machinery might not be able to sell any collateral that remains important in the current production
6:250:23144:15:16:60:553:197:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:process, even if the firms expect the collateral to lose value in the future. Even for pure investment assets, such as
6:251:23262:16:16:60:553:181:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:stock holdings, an investor’s ability to dispose of those assets quickly might be affected by market liquidity, which
6:252:23379:16:15:60:553:165:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:could also introduce a collateral adjustment friction. In all of these settings, our model predicts that pessimistic
6:253:23495:15:16:60:553:150:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:agents would engage in significant (non-recourse) collateralized borrowing against any asset that they are unable
6:254:23608:16:16:60:554:134:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:to sell. To our knowledge, we are the first toidentifythe ability or willingness to adjust collateral positions as the
6:255:23726:16:15:60:553:118:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:key feature that determines the relation between borrowers’ beliefs and leverage choices, although the primitive
6:256:23838:15:15:60:337:103:10:g_d0_f2:7:g_d0_f3:forces driving our model are important in many environments.6
6:257:23899:15:12:71:553:88:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:5Other applications of collateral equilibrium include Araújo, Schommer and Woodford (2015), Cao (2017), Gottardi and Kubler
6:258:24022:12:7:60:359:76:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:(2015), Geanakoplos and Zame (2014), Geerolf (2015) and He and Xiong (2012).
6:259:24098:7:0:71:553:69:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:6For example, the mechanism behind the downpayment protection force is also present in models of sovereign default, as those
7:260:24223:0:15:75:553:729:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:On the empirical side, we provide evidence for the importance of beliefs in determining housing and leverage
7:261:24331:15:16:60:553:714:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:decisions. We also show that leverage choice in the housing market is best described by a housing-as-consumption
7:262:24443:16:16:60:553:698:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:paradigm with a sizable collateral adjustment friction. This potentially sets it apart from other markets, such as
7:263:24557:16:15:60:553:682:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the stock market, where investment motives are the primary driving force determining the size of the investment.
7:264:24669:15:16:60:553:667:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Our empirical findings also contribute to the growing literature that studies belief formation. Some recent work
7:265:24781:16:16:60:553:651:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:includes Malmendier and Nagel (2011, 2015), Greenwood and Shleifer (2014), and Kuchler and Zafar (2015). Much
7:266:24890:16:15:60:553:635:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of this literature has focused on explaining how individuals’ own experiences affect their expectations. We expand
7:267:25004:15:16:60:553:620:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:on the findings in Bailey et al. (2017a) to show that various moments of the experiences of individuals’ friends
7:268:25116:16:16:60:406:604:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:also affect the corresponding moments of those individuals’ belief distributions.
7:269:25197:16:15:75:553:588:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Our results speak to the active debate about the extent to which the joint movement in house prices and
7:270:25300:15:16:60:553:573:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:mortgage leverage during the 2002-2006 housing boom period was the result of homebuyer optimism or other
7:271:25404:16:16:60:553:557:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:forces in the economy, such as credit supply shocks (Adelino, Schoar and Severino, 2016; Burnside, Eichenbaum
7:272:25513:16:15:60:553:541:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:and Rebelo, 2016; Case, Shiller and Thompson, 2012; Cheng, Raina and Xiong, 2014; Di Maggio and Kermani, 2016;
7:273:25623:15:16:60:553:526:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Foote, Loewenstein and Willen, 2016; Glaeser, Gottlieb and Gyourko, 2012; Landvoigt, Piazzesi and Schneider,

7:275:25842:16:15:60:553:494:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:by itself, increased household optimism does not induce higher leverage, and that other forces, such as shifts in the
7:276:25959:15:16:60:554:479:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:credit supply function, also played an important role during the recent housing cycle.7This does not mean that
7:277:26069:16:16:60:553:463:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:homebuyer optimism was not important in explaining the boom-bust cycle inhouse prices. However, it does mean
7:278:26177:16:15:60:553:447:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:that a singular focus on homebuyer beliefs would have counterfactually predicted a decline in mortgage leverage
7:279:26288:15:16:60:553:432:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:during this period.8More broadly, our findings provide support for a literature that explores the role of beliefs as
7:280:26404:16:16:60:553:416:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:drivers of credit and business cycles (see Gennaioli, Shleifer and Vishny, 2012; Xiong, 2012; Angeletos and Lian,

7:282:26583:38:26:60:483:362:14:g_d0_f7:14:g_d0_f7:1  A Model of Leverage Choice with Heterogeneous Beliefs
7:283:26639:26:15:60:553:336:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:In this section, we develop a parsimonious model of leverage choice that allows us to characterize the various
7:284:26749:15:33:60:438:321:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:channels through which homebuyers’ beliefs can affect their mortgage leverage choices.
7:285:26835:33:22:60:167:288:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:1.1  Environment
7:286:26851:22:15:60:554:266:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We consider an economy with two dates,t={0,1}, populated by two types of agents: borrowers, indexed byi,
7:287:26955:15:18:60:450:251:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:and lenders, indexed byL.9There is a numeraire consumption good and a housing good.
7:288:27038:18:9:60:553:233:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:described in Aguiar and Amador (2013) and Uribe and Schmitt-Grohé (2017). For instance, a sovereign with pessimistic expectations
7:289:27167:9:10:60:553:224:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:about the performance of the economy anticipates the possibility of defaulting, which generates an incentive to borrow more. As
7:290:27294:10:9:60:553:214:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:described in Section 2.2.1, this effect is modulated by the costs of default, which are endogenous in the sovereign context, as emphasized
7:291:27432:9:7:60:372:205:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:by Bulow and Rogoff (1989) and Gennaioli, Martin and Rossi (2014), among others.
7:292:27512:7:12:71:553:198:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:7We show that, in both housing-as-consumption and housing-as-investment scenarios, lenders’ optimism can generate an increase
7:293:27637:12:10:60:553:186:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:in leverage. Intuitively, access to cheaper credit makes borrowers more willing to borrow. This result establishes that shifts in the
7:294:27770:10:9:60:75:176:8:g_d0_f6:6:g_d0_f5:distribution of borrowers’ and lenders’ beliefs have an asymmetric impact on equilibrium leverage.8
7:295:27869:9:10:75:553:167:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:This is consistent with the evidence in quantitative models of the housing market such as Kaplan, Mitman and Violante (2015),
7:296:27994:10:9:60:553:157:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:who show that more optimistic homebuyers can precipitate price increases, but that without a simultaneous relaxation in credit
7:297:28120:9:9:60:553:148:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:constraints, leverage will likely decrease. Such quantitative models incorporate general equilibrium effects of beliefs on house prices
7:298:28255:9:10:60:553:139:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:that our cross-sectional empirical strategy cannot speak to. For example, if more optimistic beliefs drive up house prices, this can
7:299:28387:10:9:60:553:129:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:provide an additional positive force on equilibrium leverage if the same downpayment to purchase the same house now involves taking
7:300:28518:9:10:60:553:120:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:on larger leverage. Quantitatively, the results in Kaplan, Mitman and Violante (2015) suggest that general equilibrium forces are not
7:301:28651:10:7:60:526:110:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:strong enough to overturn the negative correlation between homebuyer beliefs and leverage we uncovered in the cross section.
7:302:28775:7:12:71:553:103:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:9For simplicity, we present our results in a principal-agent formulation in which borrowers and lenders have predetermined roles.
7:303:28904:12:9:60:553:91:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:A common theme in existing work is that optimists endogenously become asset buyers and borrowers while pessimists become asset
7:304:29030:9:10:60:553:82:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:sellers and lenders. This type of sorting is natural if belief disagreement is the single source of heterogeneity. However, in housing
7:305:29164:10:9:60:553:72:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:markets, additional dimensions of heterogeneity (e.g., life-cycle motives, wealth, risk preferences, access to credit markets, etc.) also
7:306:29301:9:0:60:317:63:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:determine which agents become buyers and borrowers in equilibrium.

8:310:29576:16:16:60:554:656:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:given their beliefs. We assume that the borrowers’ discount factor satisfiesβ <1and thatui(·)is an increasing
8:311:29685:16:15:60:553:640:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:and concave function that satisfiesu′i(·)>0,u′′i(·)<0, andlimc→0u′i(c) =∞. Our formulation preserves the
8:312:29789:15:16:60:553:625:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:linearity of borrowers’ preferences with respect to future wealth, which allows us to derive sharp results while
8:313:29901:16:16:60:308:609:10:g_d0_f2:7:g_d0_f3:allowing for a meaningful date-0 consumption decision.10
8:314:29957:16:15:75:554:593:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Borrowers are endowed withn0i>0andn1i>0dollars at dates0and1, respectively. At date0, borrowers use

8:317:30277:15:16:60:553:547:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of the house they acquire. Formally, in exchange for receivingp0h0iΛi(δi)dollars at date0, borrowers promise

8:320:30603:15:29:60:283:500:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:borrowers’ date-0budget constraint corresponds to

8:322:30680:29:16:60:554:442:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:At date1, borrowers have the option to default. In case of default, borrowers experience a private lossκih0i,

8:351:31889:12:9:60:553:125:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:of introducing curvature in borrowers’ date-1 utility. Our theoretical results can be interpreted as a first-order approximation to the
8:352:32024:9:7:60:128:116:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:more general case.
8:353:32042:7:12:68:553:109:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:11Formally, assuming that the default cost is proportional to the house size preserves the homogeneity of the borrowers’ problem.
8:354:32171:12:10:60:553:97:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:This assumption can be relaxed without affecting our insights, though we believe that it is reasonable to assume that individual default

9:362:32896:16:15:60:553:640:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:When the home size constraint binds, homebuyers’ housing investment decision is completely pinned down by
9:363:33001:15:16:60:553:625:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:consumption aspects of housing, such as the homebuyer’s family size, the house quality or location, or the local
9:364:33113:16:16:60:554:609:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:amenities.14Considering this case allows us to study the relationship between beliefs and leverage with an infinite

9:366:33341:15:16:60:553:578:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:in the absence of collateral adjustment frictions. These two polar cases, which we study below, provide extreme

9:373:34046:16:21:60:395:463:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:different from those of borrowers, are given by a distribution with cdfFL(·).

9:382:34841:22:16:60:553:294:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We characterize the equilibrium of the model backwards.  We first study borrowers’ default decisions, then

9:404:35967:9:7:60:446:173:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:predictions under those assumptions are the same as the predictions when the housing constraint binds.
9:405:36069:7:12:68:553:166:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:14While we model housing as an homogeneous good to maintain tractability, the collateral adjustment friction also proxies for
9:406:36194:12:10:60:553:154:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:households’ willingness to adjust their housing choice in other dimensions. For example, it does not just capture households’ willingness
9:407:36331:10:9:60:553:144:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:to buy a smaller house in the same neighborhood, but also their willingness to move to a cheaper neighborhood in other to reduce the

9:409:36512:7:12:68:553:128:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:15Our results remain valid under weaker assumptions on the determination of credit supply. For instance, our results are unchanged
9:410:36642:12:10:60:553:116:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:if lenders are restricted to offering a single loan-to-value schedule to all borrowers. A correct interpretation of our empirical findings
9:411:36780:10:9:60:553:106:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:requires that potentially unobserved characteristics used by lenders’ to offer loan-to-value schedules to borrowers must be orthogonal

10:432:37696:16:15:60:553:572:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:represent strategic, ruthless defaults by households walking away from homes with negative equity (“underwater
10:433:37806:15:16:60:553:557:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:homes”), even though they have the resources to continue making mortgage payments (see Elul et al., 2010;
10:434:37911:16:16:60:553:541:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Bhutta, Dokko and Shan, 2017; Gerardi et al., 2017). This literature concludes that default usually happens at
10:435:38021:16:15:60:553:525:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:levels of negative equity that are larger than what would be predicted by a frictionless default model. Our model
10:436:38134:15:16:60:553:510:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:incorporates these findings through the size of the parameterκi, which captures other, non-financial default costs
10:437:38248:16:16:60:553:494:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:(e.g., social stigma). As we discuss below, our theoretical and empirical findings do not depend on whether default
10:438:38363:16:15:60:553:478:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:is purely strategic or the result of also receiving negative income shocks. Indeed, our results only require that
10:439:38476:15:16:60:553:463:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:default ismore likelywhen house prices decline; in other words, the results are robust as long as negative equity
10:440:38589:16:21:60:337:447:10:g_d0_f2:7:g_d0_f3:is a necessary condition for default, even if it is not sufficient.16

11:533:43003:16:15:60:553:220:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:thinks that house prices might decrease is more inclined to choose a lower downpayment (higher repayment and
11:534:43111:15:16:60:553:205:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:higher LTV ratio), since the perceived probability of repaying the mortgage is low. Equivalently, an optimistic
11:535:43222:16:16:60:553:189:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:borrower with a similar house size target who thinks that house prices are likely to increase, expects to repay
11:536:43333:16:15:60:553:173:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:her mortgage in more states of the world. This increase in the perceived marginal cost of borrowing leads more
11:537:43443:15:16:60:450:158:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:optimistic borrowers to invest more of their own funds by making a larger downpayment.
11:538:43529:16:16:75:553:142:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:An alternative way of understanding borrowers’ behavior is by considering the three possible uses for a dollar

11:540:43753:15:12:68:553:111:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:18The derivation of Equation (7) uses the envelope theorem. Even though borrowers take into account that adjusting their leverage

11:542:44010:10:9:60:553:89:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:additional terms appear in Equation (7) to account for this effect, since borrowers make default decisions optimally.  Intuitively,
11:543:44141:9:10:60:553:80:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:because borrowers are indifferent between defaulting and repaying at the default threshold, a small change in the default threshold

12:596:46142:15:16:60:553:375:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:housing size, and (ii) a scenario in which borrowers’ housing size is fixed due to non-investment-related forces such
12:597:46259:16:16:60:553:359:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:as family (infinite collateral adjustment friction), we can provide comparative statics on the effects of beliefs shifts.
12:598:46380:16:15:75:553:343:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f4:We refer to the case in which borrowers freely adjust their housing choice as thehousing-as-investment

12:600:46594:16:15:60:553:312:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:considerations. In this case, borrowers make housing decisions purely based on its return as a levered investment
12:601:46707:15:16:60:553:297:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:and there is no collateral adjustment friction.  We refer to the second case in which the housing decision is

13:663:50182:13:9:60:553:140:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:our formulation is that it highlights that borrowers’ optimism only increases leverage indirectly – through Equation (6), not Equation
13:664:50316:9:7:60:521:131:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:(7) – through the fact that more optimistic borrowers need to lever up a given amount of resources to buy larger properties.
13:665:50440:7:12:68:553:124:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:20Throughout the paper, we compare belief distributions along dimensions that allow us to guarantee that truncated expectations and
13:666:50571:12:9:60:553:112:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:default probabilities, when defined as functions of the default threshold, shift “point-wise.” We could establish additional predictions
13:667:50707:9:10:60:553:103:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:from “local” changes in truncated expectations (starting from a given equilibrium). We do not pursue that route, because our empirical
13:668:50841:10:7:60:461:93:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:strategy only uses shifts in the distributionFi(·)and does not use information on actual default thresholds.
13:669:50949:7:12:68:553:86:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:21In a more general setup, borrowers will also be indifferent at the margin between consuming and investing in other assets. See

16:834:56700:0:15:60:553:729:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:likely to be lost in case of default. In that case, more pessimistic borrowers optimally decide to make smaller
16:835:56811:15:16:60:553:714:10:g_d0_f2:7:g_d0_f12:downpayments and borrow more. In this scenario, when the probability of default is less than50%, a higherσi
16:836:56918:16:16:60:553:698:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:increases the probability of default (i.e., it reduces the probability mass to the right of the threshold), reducing the
16:837:57038:16:15:60:553:682:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:probability of repayment and reducing also the return on borrowers’ downpayment. Higher variance of expected
16:838:57146:15:16:60:378:667:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:house price changes will thus induce borrowers to increase their leverage.
16:839:57220:16:16:75:553:651:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:It is worth highlighting that borrowers’ ability to default is crucial for our results.  Had we assumed that
16:840:57328:16:15:60:553:635:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:borrowers are always forced to repay (κi→∞), the downpayment protection force would be inactive, and changes
16:841:57436:15:16:60:553:620:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:in borrowers’ beliefs would have no impact on leverage choice in the housing-as-consumption scenario. As discussed
16:842:57550:16:16:60:553:604:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:above, our theoretical and empirical results do not depend on whether default is purely strategic (i.e., sizable
16:843:57662:16:15:60:553:588:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:negative equity is a sufficient condition for default), or whether households only default if negative income shocks
16:844:57778:15:16:60:553:573:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:make it impossible for them to continue making their mortgage payments. This is because even in response to
16:845:57885:16:16:60:553:557:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:income shocks, households will only default when they have negative equity, and the mortgage is worth more
16:846:57991:16:15:60:553:541:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:than their house – if they had positive equity, they could just sell the house, repay the mortgage, and keep the
16:847:58103:15:16:60:553:526:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:difference. This means that in either scenario, mortgage default is more likely when house prices decline (negative
16:848:58218:16:16:60:553:510:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:equity is either sufficient, when default is strategic, or necessary, when default is in response to negative income
16:849:58334:16:32:60:274:494:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:shocks), which is what we require for our results.

16:851:58420:22:16:60:553:440:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:The results in Proposition 1 establish that changes in beliefs can have differential implications for borrowers’
16:852:58532:16:15:60:553:424:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:leverage choices depending on the active margins of adjustment. In this section, we derive additional testable
16:853:58642:15:16:60:553:409:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:predictions from our theoretical framework. Specifically, we study how the relationship between beliefs and leverage
16:854:58758:16:16:60:553:393:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:choices characterized in Proposition 1 varies with the magnitude of the default cost. We also analyze how this
16:855:58868:16:15:60:553:377:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:relationship varies with the average optimism of homebuyers.  As highlighted in the introduction, we find the
16:856:58977:15:16:60:553:362:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:empirical evidence to be more consistent with the housing-as-consumption scenario. In the interest of brevity, we
16:857:59090:16:16:60:553:346:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:therefore derive these additional predictions for the housing-as-consumption scenario in the body of the paper,

16:867:60122:16:15:60:553:161:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:default costs dampen the effects of belief changes on leverage. Formally, the predictions for equilibrium LTV ratios

16:869:60371:12:9:60:553:134:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:and average beliefs. As we describe in the Appendix, second-order comparative statics exercises are determined by both direct effects

17:901:61055:16:15:60:554:592:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:are low, borrowers perceive that default is relatively more likely, so a given change inμiandσishifts a larger mass

18:978:64139:30:22:60:230:470:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:2.3  Role of Lenders’ Beliefs
18:979:64168:22:16:60:553:448:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Although our empirical findings build on cross-sectional variation on homebuyers’ beliefs, it is valuable to separately
18:980:64287:16:15:60:553:432:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:characterize the effect of changes in lenders’ beliefs on the equilibrium leverage choices of borrowers. This allows
18:981:64403:15:16:60:553:417:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:us to draw implications of our cross-sectional results for aggregate variables, as we discuss in the conclusion. We
18:982:64518:16:16:60:553:401:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:show that an increase in lenders’ optimism can increase equilibrium leverage in both the housing-as-consumption
18:983:64629:16:21:60:554:385:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:and the housing-as-investment scenarios. We assume that lenders have normally distributed beliefs with meanμL.
18:984:64739:21:16:60:553:364:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f4:Proposition 4.(Role of lenders’ beliefs.)In the housing-as-investment scenario and the housing-as-consumption
18:985:64848:16:16:60:553:348:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:scenario, higher optimism by lenders, in the form of a higher average beliefμL, holding all else constant, including
18:986:64964:16:22:60:349:332:10:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f4:borrowers’ beliefs, is necessary to generate an increase in leverage.
18:987:65033:22:15:75:553:310:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:In Appendix A, we formally show that a change in the average belief of lendersμLis associated with point-
18:988:65138:15:16:60:554:295:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:wise shifts inΛi(·)andΛ′i(·). Intuitively, when lenders become more optimistic, borrowers have access to cheaper
18:989:65250:16:16:60:553:279:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:funding. In the housing-as-investment scenario, we show that access to cheaper credit increases the maximum
18:990:65357:16:15:60:553:263:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:levered return that a borrower can achieve, generating a substitution effect towards higher leverage in equilibrium.
18:991:65473:15:16:60:553:248:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:In the housing-as-consumption scenario, in addition to the substitution effect, there is an income effect that works
18:992:65589:16:16:60:553:232:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:in the opposite direction: lower interest rates make borrowers feel richer, which generates a force towards higher
18:993:65703:16:15:60:553:216:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:consumption and lower leverage.  The findings of Propositions 1 and 4 thus show that shifts in the beliefs of
18:994:65812:15:38:60:529:201:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:borrowers and lenders, when considered in isolation, can have opposite predictions for equilibrium leverage.
18:995:65920:38:26:60:459:163:14:g_d0_f7:14:g_d0_f7:3  Beliefs and Leverage Choice: Empirical Investigation
18:996:65975:26:15:60:553:137:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:The previous sections showed that the effect of homebuyer beliefs on leverage choice is ambiguous. If households are
18:997:66091:15:16:60:553:122:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:able to substantially adjust the size of their property in response to changes in expected house price growth, then
18:998:66206:16:16:60:553:106:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:more pessimistic buyers will buy smaller houses with lower overall leverage. On the other hand, some homebuyers’
18:999:66318:16:15:60:553:90:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:property choices might be primarily determined by factors related to the consumption aspect of the house, such as
18:1000:66431:15:16:60:553:75:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:family size. Such a collateral adjustment friction limits the ability of pessimistic homebuyers to reduce their home
18:1001:66547:16:0:60:553:59:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:size, and the only way to minimize their financial exposure to the housing market is to reduce their downpayment.
19:1002:66662:0:15:60:553:729:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:In practice, individuals’ behavior will be in between the extreme cases studied in Section 2.1. Indeed, whether
19:1003:66773:15:16:60:553:714:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:collateral adjustment frictions are sufficiently large such that more optimistic individuals will choose lower leverage
19:1004:66892:16:16:60:553:698:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:is an empirical question that is central to understanding the role of homebuyer beliefs in driving mortgage leverage.
19:1005:67009:16:15:75:553:682:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:In this section, we analyze the effects on equilibrium leverage of changes in homebuyer beliefs, holding lender
19:1006:67120:15:16:60:553:667:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:beliefs fixed.  Our tests use the recent house price experiences of geographically distant friends as shifters of
19:1007:67233:16:16:60:553:651:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:individuals’ beliefs about the distribution of future house price changes. Specifically, we compare the leverage
19:1008:67345:16:15:60:553:635:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:choices of otherwise similar individuals purchasing houses at the same point in time and in the same neighborhood,
19:1009:67459:15:16:60:553:620:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:where one individual’s friends have experienced more positive, or more widely dispersed recent house price growth.
19:1010:67573:16:16:75:553:604:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:This empirical approach builds on recent evidence in Bailey et al. (2017a), who show that the recent house price
19:1011:67685:16:15:60:553:588:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:changes experienced within an individual’s social network affect that individual’s beliefs about the attractiveness
19:1012:67800:15:16:60:553:573:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of local housing market investments. We expand on these findings, and analyze responses to a new survey that
19:1013:67908:16:16:60:553:557:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:elicits individuals’ distribution of beliefs about future house price changes.  We document that the mean and
19:1014:68017:16:15:60:553:541:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:standard deviation of the house price experiences across an individual’s friends shift the corresponding moments
19:1015:68129:15:16:60:554:526:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of the distribution of individuals’ house price beliefs. Bailey et al. (2017a) also show that there is no systematic
19:1016:68245:16:16:60:553:510:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:relationship between the house price experiences of an individual’s geographically distant friends and other
19:1017:68353:16:15:60:553:494:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:characteristics of that individual that might also affect her housing market investment behavior.  This means
19:1018:68462:15:16:60:553:479:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:that the house price experiences of an individual’s geographically distant friends are likely to only affect leverage
19:1019:68579:16:16:60:553:463:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:choice through their effects on beliefs. Indeed, in our empirical analysis we will rule out a number of other initially
19:1020:68698:16:32:60:141:447:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:plausible channels.
19:1021:68717:32:22:60:337:415:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:3.1  Data Description and Summary Statistics
19:1022:68761:22:16:60:553:393:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Our empirical analysis is based on the combination of two key data sets. First, to measure different individuals’
19:1023:68874:16:15:60:553:377:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:social networks, we use anonymized social network data from Facebook. Facebook was created in 2004 as a college-
19:1024:68986:15:16:60:553:362:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:wide online social networking service for students to maintain a profile and communicate with their friends. It has
19:1025:69101:16:16:60:553:346:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:since grown to become the world’s largest online social networking service, with over 1.9 billion monthly active
19:1026:69213:16:15:60:553:330:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:users globally and 234 million monthly active users in the U.S. and Canada (Facebook, 2017). Our baseline data
19:1027:69323:15:16:60:553:315:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:include a de-identified snapshot of all U.S.-based active Facebook users from July 1, 2015. For these users, we
19:1028:69434:16:16:60:553:299:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:observe the county of residence as well as the set of other Facebook users they are connected to. Using the language
19:1029:69550:16:15:60:553:283:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:adopted by the Facebook community, we call these connections “friends.” Indeed, in the U.S., Facebook serves
19:1030:69658:15:16:60:553:268:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:primarily as a platform for real-world friends and acquaintances to interact online, and people usually only add
19:1031:69770:16:16:60:553:252:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:connections to individuals on Facebook whom they know in the real world (Hampton et al., 2011; Jones et al.,
19:1032:69878:16:15:60:176:236:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:2013; Bailey et al., 2017b).
19:1033:69906:15:16:75:553:221:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:To construct a measure of the house price experiences in different individuals’ social networks, we combine the
19:1034:70017:16:16:60:553:205:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:data on the county of residence of different individuals’ friends with county-level house price indices from Zillow.
19:1035:70133:16:15:60:553:189:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:As we describe below, this allows us to analyze the full distribution of recent house price experiences across any
19:1036:70247:15:16:60:553:174:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:group of Facebook users. For example, we can calculate the standard deviation of house price experiences across
19:1037:70358:16:16:60:275:158:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:every individuals’ out-of-commuting zone friends.
19:1038:70407:16:15:75:553:142:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:In order to measure homebuyers’ leverage choice, we merge individuals on Facebook with three snapshots
19:1039:70509:15:16:60:553:127:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:from Acxiom InfoBase for July 2010, July 2012, and July 2014.23These data are collected by Acxiom, a leading
19:1040:70617:16:15:60:553:111:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:marketing services and analytics company, and contain a wide range of individual-level demographic information
19:1041:70727:15:12:68:553:96:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:23This merge involves a scrambled merge-key based on common characteristics. 53% of merges relied on email address. Other
19:1042:70848:12:9:60:553:84:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:characteristics were full date of birth (51%) or year-month of date of birth (28%), last name (45%) and first name (84%), location at
19:1043:70981:9:10:60:553:75:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:the level of zip code (44%), county (37%), Core Based Statistical Area (8%), and telephone number (2%). Most matches are based on
19:1044:71110:10:0:60:148:65:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:multiple characteristics.
20:1045:71137:0:15:60:553:729:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:compiled from a large number of sources (e.g., public records, surveys, and warranty registrations). We observe
20:1046:71248:15:16:60:553:714:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:information on age, marital status, education, occupation, income, household size, and homeownership status. For
20:1047:71360:16:16:60:553:698:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:current homeowners, the data also include information on housing transactions after 1993 that led to the ongoing
20:1048:71472:16:15:60:553:682:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:homeownership spell, compiled from public records deeds recordings. These data include the transaction date, the
20:1049:71584:15:16:60:428:667:10:g_d0_f2:7:g_d0_f3:transaction price, and details on any mortgage used to finance the home purchase.24
20:1050:71667:16:16:75:553:651:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Since we can only analyze origination mortgages that have not been refinanced by the time we observe the
20:1051:71771:16:15:60:553:635:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:transaction in an Acxiom snapshot, we focus our analysis on home purchases between 2008 and 2014. There are
20:1052:71878:15:16:60:553:620:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:at most two years between these transaction and the closest Acxiom snapshot, allowing us to observe virtually
20:1053:71987:16:16:60:553:604:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:all of the initial mortgages. We want to study the mortgage choices for home purchases across a dispersed set of
20:1054:72099:16:15:60:553:588:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:geographies, in order to provide us with cross-sectional heterogeneity in the cost of default created by differences
20:1055:72215:15:16:60:553:573:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:in the legal environment across states. To achieve this, we first define a set of eligible geographies as those with
20:1056:72331:16:16:60:553:557:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:good Acxiom coverage and complete reporting of house prices and mortgage amounts; this excludes, for example,
20:1057:72440:16:15:60:553:541:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:property transactions from non-disclosure states such as Texas, where housing transaction prices are not reported
20:1058:72553:15:16:60:553:526:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:in the public record. We select all transactions in our data since January 2008 from a random sample of 2,900 zip
20:1059:72666:16:16:60:553:510:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:codes from these eligible geographies. This provides us with about 1.35 million housing transactions for which we
20:1060:72779:16:15:60:553:494:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:can match the buyer to Facebook.25These transactions come from 33 different states, with the most prominently
20:1061:72888:15:16:60:553:479:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:represented states being California (24.6%), Florida (12.4%), and Arizona (9.5%), with Ohio, Washington, Nevada

23:1179:81138:22:15:60:553:299:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:The first step of our empirical analysis is to verify that the moments of the distribution of house price experiences
23:1180:81255:15:16:60:553:284:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:across an individual’s friends affect that individual’s distribution of beliefs about future house price changes in
23:1181:81370:16:16:60:553:268:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:their own zip code. To do this, we analyze responses to a short survey conducted by Facebook in April 2017.
23:1182:81477:16:15:60:553:252:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:The survey targeted Facebook users living in Los Angeles through a post on their News Feed. Figure 6 shows
23:1183:81583:15:16:60:553:237:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the survey interface. We observe 504 survey responses. The respondents’ average age was 38 years, with a 10-90
23:1184:81693:16:16:60:340:221:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:percentile range of 23 to 58 years. 62% of respondents are male.
23:1185:81757:16:15:75:553:205:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:The first survey question elicits how often individuals talk to their friends about whether buying a house is a
23:1186:81868:15:16:60:553:190:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:good investment. Regular conversations with friends about housing investments are important in order for there
23:1187:81978:16:16:60:553:174:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:to be a channel through which the house price experiences of friends can influence an individual’s own house price
23:1188:82092:16:15:60:553:158:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:beliefs. Panel (a) of Figure 7 shows the distribution of responses to this question. About 43% of respondents gave
23:1189:82206:15:16:60:553:143:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the modal answer, “sometimes.” The other possible responses were “never” (16% of responses), “rarely” (21% of
23:1190:82315:16:16:60:246:127:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:responses) and “often” (20% of responses).
23:1191:82357:16:15:75:553:111:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:To measure an individual’s beliefs about future house price changes, we use responses to the second question,
23:1192:82466:15:16:60:553:96:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:which asked individuals to assign probabilities to various scenarios of house price growth in their zip codes over
23:1193:82580:16:0:60:553:80:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the following 12 months. The survey enforced the assigned probabilities to add up to 100%. We use the responses

24:1198:83059:16:15:60:553:300:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:disagreement about expected house price growth among individuals living in the same local housing markets: while
24:1199:83171:15:16:60:553:285:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the median person expects house prices to increase by 5.3% over the next year, the 10-90 percentile range for this
24:1200:83285:16:16:60:334:269:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:estimate is 0.8% to 10.0%, and the standard deviation is 3.8%.
24:1201:83347:16:15:75:553:253:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:As a first test for whether individuals provide sensible and consistent responses to the expectation survey, Panel

24:1203:83576:16:16:60:553:222:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:responses to Question 3, which asks if the respondents expect the average home price in their zip code to increase,
24:1204:83691:16:15:60:553:206:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:stay the same, or decrease over the next 12 months. As a response to that question, 79.8% of individuals said they
24:1205:83805:15:16:60:553:191:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:expected house prices in their zip code to increase over the next 12 months, 14.6% said they would expect them
24:1206:83915:16:16:60:553:175:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:to stay about the same, and 5.6% expected them to decline. As a reference point, in the 12 months running up
24:1207:84023:16:15:60:553:159:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:to the survey, Los Angeles house prices increased by 7.4%. Individuals that thought it was most likely that house
24:1208:84136:15:16:60:553:144:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:prices in their zip code would increase over the next twelve months have a median belief about house price growth
24:1209:84249:16:16:60:553:128:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of 6.0%; the median expected house price growth of respondents who said house prices would stay about the same
24:1210:84359:16:15:60:553:112:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:(decline) was 2.0% (-2.4%). While there are a small number of individuals who indicate they expect house price
24:1211:84469:15:12:68:553:97:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:28To do this, we take the mid-point of each bucket, as well as the probabilities that individual agents assign to that bucket. For
24:1212:84599:12:10:60:553:85:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:the open-ended buckets “Increase by more than 12%” and “Decrease by more than 8%”, we use point-estimates of 14% and -10%,
24:1213:84721:10:9:60:553:75:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:respectively, but our results are robust to using different values assigned to these buckets. The roughly 15% of respondents who only
24:1214:84854:9:0:60:372:66:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:assign probabilities to one bucket are assigned a standard deviation of beliefs of 0%.

26:1284:90253:16:15:60:553:165:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A one-percentage-point increase in the house price experiences of all friends is associated with a 0.33 percentage
26:1285:90367:15:14:68:553:150:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:29The effect ofFriendHPExpOut−CZi,April2017on the R-squared is relatively modest: conditional on the control variables, the house price
26:1286:90502:14:10:60:553:136:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:experiences of an individual’s out-of-commuting zone friends explain an additional 1.1% - 1.6% of the observed variation in the mean
26:1287:90634:10:9:60:553:126:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:of house price beliefs. Specifically, the OLS regression without controlling for out-of-commuting zone friends’ average house price
26:1288:90765:9:10:60:553:117:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:experiences, but including all the other control variables, has an R-squared of 0.362; the within-zip code R-squared is 0.074. When
26:1289:90896:10:9:60:553:107:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:we include the out-of-commuting zone friends’ house price experiences as an additional control variable, the R-squared increases to
26:1290:91027:9:10:60:553:98:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:0.373, and the within-zip code R-squared increases to 0.090. However, given the large sample sizes in the leverage choice regressions in
26:1291:91163:10:9:60:553:88:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:Sections 3.3 and 3.4, the belief shifter has sufficient power to identify statistically significant effects of beliefs on leverage. The number
26:1292:91305:9:9:60:553:79:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:of observations in Table 2 is lower than the total number of responses we observe. This is because 78 responses are from individuals
26:1293:91437:9:0:60:522:70:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:who are the only respondents from their own zip code. Their responses are thus fully explained by the zip code fixed effects.

27:1295:91673:15:16:60:553:714:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:3, we also include the (instrumented) standard deviation of house price experiences across individuals’ friends,

27:1297:91902:16:15:60:205:682:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:average house price expectations.
27:1298:91935:15:16:75:553:667:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:The dependent variable in columns 4 to 6 of Table 2 is the standard deviation of the distribution of individuals’

27:1301:92274:15:16:60:553:620:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:in the standard deviation of the belief distribution.  In column 5, the main explanatory variable of interest is
27:1302:92386:16:16:60:554:604:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the standard deviation of house price experiences across all friends,StDFriendHPi,April2017, instrumented for
27:1303:92495:16:15:60:554:588:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:by its counterpart among out-of-commuting zone friends,StDFriendHPOut−CZi,April2017.  The estimated effect of a

27:1305:92715:16:16:60:553:557:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:0.18 percentage points. In column 6, we also includeFriendHPExpi,April2017as a control variable, but it has no
27:1306:92825:16:15:60:412:541:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:statistically significant effect on the standard deviation of the belief distribution.
27:1307:92911:15:16:75:553:526:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Overall, these findings confirm that the mean and variance of the house price experiences across an individual’s
27:1308:93023:16:16:60:553:510:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:friends can shift the corresponding moments of the distribution of these individuals’ house price beliefs. In the
27:1309:93136:16:32:60:504:494:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:following section we will use this insight to analyze the effect of house price beliefs on leverage choice.

27:1311:93260:22:16:60:553:440:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:In this section, we test how moments of the distribution of house price experiences across a homebuyer’s friends
27:1312:93372:16:15:60:553:424:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:affect that homebuyer’s leverage choice in the sample of transactions described in Section 3.1.  Based on the
27:1313:93481:15:16:60:554:409:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:evidence in Section 3.2 and in Bailey et al. (2017a), we argue that these house price experiences provide shifters
27:1314:93595:16:16:60:553:393:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of individuals’ distributions of beliefs about future house price changes that are orthogonal to other factors that
27:1315:93710:16:15:60:197:377:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:might influence leverage choice.
27:1316:93742:15:16:75:553:362:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:In our baseline regression specification R1, the unit of observation is a housing transaction. We run regressions
27:1317:93855:16:16:60:553:346:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of the combined loan-to-value (CLTV) ratio for transactioniat timetin countycand financed by mortgage lender

27:1319:94072:15:16:60:554:315:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:loan-to-value ratio includes all mortgages originated to finance the home purchase.31We also control for a rich set
27:1320:94187:16:16:60:554:299:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of homebuyer characteristics,32and include county by purchase month by lender fixed effects,ψt,c,l.33This allows
27:1321:94299:16:15:60:553:283:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:us to compare the leverage choices across individuals who borrow from the same lender in the same county and
27:1322:94407:15:16:60:553:268:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:at the same point in time, and who therefore faced the same schedule of loan-to-value ratios and interest rates to

27:1326:94710:15:12:68:553:180:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:30One can provide a structural interpretation of this estimate as a Kalman gain in the context of standard linear-gaussian bayesian
27:1327:94841:12:7:60:96:168:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:updating.
27:1328:94850:7:12:68:553:161:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:31For example, many homebuyers that choose to borrow more than 80% of the value of the house split their borrowing into a first
27:1329:94977:12:10:60:553:149:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:mortgage with an LTV of 80%, for which they do not have to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI), and a higher-interest piggy-back
27:1330:95106:10:9:60:75:139:8:g_d0_f6:6:g_d0_f5:loan for the remaining amount.32
27:1331:95138:9:10:75:553:130:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:With the exception of age, which can be observed at the point of the transaction, other homebuyer characteristics are observed
27:1332:95264:10:9:60:553:120:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:as of the points of the Acxiom snapshots. We assign the value from the most proximate snapshot. We flexibly control for homebuyer
27:1333:95393:9:10:60:553:111:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:income, age, household size, family status, occupation, and education level. We also control for the number of friends, the number of
27:1334:95526:10:9:60:75:101:8:g_d0_f6:6:g_d0_f5:out-of-commuting zone friends, and the number of counties in which an individual has friends.33
27:1335:95621:9:10:75:553:92:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:Even though Hurst et al. (2016) have shown that most lenders do not vary their mortgage pricing geographically, this choice of
27:1336:95747:10:9:60:553:82:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:fixed effects is conservative, and ensures that we are comparing the leverage choices of individuals facing the same trade-offs between
27:1337:95882:9:9:60:553:73:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:making a smaller downpayment and paying higher interest rates. In the rare cases where the first and second mortgages are by different
27:1338:96016:9:0:60:425:64:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:lenders, we use the identity of the lender of the first mortgage to determine the lender fixed effect.
28:1339:96120:0:15:60:553:729:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:housing-as-investment scenario, we need to ensure that our key explanatory variables,MeanFriendHPand
28:1340:96220:15:16:60:554:714:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f2:StDFriendHP, only affect leverage choice through their effect on homebuyers’ beliefs about the distribution
28:1341:96327:16:16:60:553:698:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of future house price changes. A first concern is that individuals who have more local friends, and for whom higher
28:1342:96442:16:15:60:553:682:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:local house prices would thus lead to a higherMeanFriendHP, might also be more affected by this local house
28:1343:96549:15:16:60:553:667:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:price growth through channels other than the effect on their house price expectations. For example, if individuals
28:1344:96663:16:16:60:553:651:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:with more local friends were more likely to own local property, then they would be more likely to benefit from higher
28:1345:96780:16:15:60:553:635:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:capital gains, allowing them to make a larger downpayment on any subsequent property purchase. To rule out
28:1346:96886:15:16:60:553:620:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:confounding effects through such alternative channels, we estimate regression R1 using an instrumental variables
28:1347:96998:16:16:60:553:604:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:(IV) strategy, where we instrument for the mean and standard deviation of all friends’ house price experiences
28:1348:97108:16:15:60:519:588:10:g_d0_f2:7:g_d0_f3:with the mean and standard deviation of the house price experiences of out-of-commuting zone friends.34
28:1349:97211:15:16:75:553:573:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Table 3 shows the results of regression R1. The baseline estimate in column 1, which does not control for
28:1350:97316:16:16:60:553:557:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:homebuyer demographics, suggests that individuals whose friends experienced a one-percentage-point higher house
28:1351:97427:16:15:60:553:541:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:price appreciation over the past 24 months increase their downpayment (and reduce their CLTV ratio) by between
28:1352:97537:15:16:60:553:526:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:8 and 9 basis points. A one within-zip-code-month standard deviation increase in friends’ house price experience
28:1353:97649:16:16:60:553:510:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:is thus associated with a 31 basis points larger downpayment. Combining this with the estimates from the survey
28:1354:97760:16:15:60:553:494:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:analyzed in Section 3.2 suggests that individuals that expect a one-percentage-point lower house price growth
28:1355:97869:15:16:60:553:479:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:over the coming twelve months would choose a0.0840.326= 26basis points lower downpayment. This finding suggests
28:1356:97980:16:16:60:553:463:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:that individuals behave more like in the housing-as-consumption scenario rather than in the housing-as-investment
28:1357:98093:16:15:60:553:447:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:scenario.35Column 1 also shows that individuals whose friends had more dispersed house price experiences, and
28:1358:98202:15:16:60:553:432:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:who thus expected more variance in future house price changes, chose higher leverage. A one-percentage-point
28:1359:98310:16:16:60:553:416:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:increase in the across-friends standard deviation of house price experiences over the past 24 months is associated
28:1360:98424:16:15:60:553:400:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:with a 35 basis points increase in the combined loan-to-value ratio. This result is also consistent with the predictions
28:1361:98544:15:16:60:553:385:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:from the housing-as-consumption scenario: individuals that expect future house price growth to be more dispersed
28:1362:98656:16:16:60:553:369:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:perceive large house price drops to be more likely. This increases the benefits of not putting all their savings into
28:1363:98773:16:15:60:338:353:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the house, and therefore increases their optimal leverage choice.
28:1364:98838:15:16:75:553:338:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:In column 2 of Table 3, we also control flexibly for a large number of borrower characteristics. The estimated
28:1365:98948:16:16:60:553:322:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:effects of the house price experiences of a person’s friends is remarkably stable with respect to the addition of these
28:1366:99067:16:15:60:553:306:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:observable controls. This provides additional evidence consistent with Bailey et al. (2017a) that the house price
28:1367:99180:15:16:60:553:291:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:experiences of a person’s friends in a given year are uncorrelated with that person’s observable characteristics,
28:1368:99293:16:16:60:553:275:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:and reduces concerns that the results are driven by selection on unobservable buyer characteristics (see Altonji,
28:1369:99406:16:15:60:553:259:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Elder and Taber, 2005). In column 3, we interact the buyer demographics with year fixed effects. This allows, for
28:1370:99519:15:16:60:553:244:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:example, the effect of having a different education or a different profession on leverage choice to vary by year. This
28:1371:99637:16:16:60:553:228:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:specification provides a first test of whether our findings could be explained by correlated shocks to homebuyers
28:1372:99750:16:15:60:553:212:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:and their friends. For example, one might have worried that less-educated Los Angeles residents have more friends
28:1373:99863:15:16:60:553:197:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:in regions with a relatively less-educated population. In that case, a positive shock to the income prospects of
28:1374:99975:16:16:60:553:181:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:less-educated individuals in a given year might both raise house prices where less-educated buyers have friends, and
28:1375:100091:16:14:60:553:165:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:would increase the ability of these less-educated buyers to make larger downpayments. Our results are essentially

28:1379:100521:7:12:68:553:122:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:35This does not mean that more pessimistic individuals did not also reduce their housing market investments, as in the extreme
28:1380:100647:12:9:60:554:110:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:case with infinite collateral adjustment friction studied above. Indeed, Bailey et al. (2017a) document that individuals whose friends
28:1381:100781:9:10:60:553:101:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:experienced lower recent house price growth did buy smaller houses: a one-percentage-point smaller friends’ house price experience
28:1382:100911:10:9:60:553:91:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:was associated with purchasing a 0.3 percentage points smaller property. Instead, the estimate in column 1 of Table 3 suggests that as
28:1383:101045:9:10:60:553:82:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:individuals got more pessimistic, their desire to reduce their financial exposure to potential house price declines increased faster than
28:1384:101182:10:9:60:553:72:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:the reduction in that exposure that was possible to achieve by buying a smaller house. As a result, they ended up buying (slightly)
28:1385:101313:9:0:60:218:63:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:smaller houses with larger overall leverage.

30:1429:103980:15:16:60:301:714:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We provide additional robustness checks in Section 3.4.
30:1430:104035:16:16:75:553:698:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Column 4 of Table 3 tests the predictions from Section 2.2.1, which show that the downpayment protection
30:1431:104139:16:15:60:553:682:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:force at the heart of the housing-as-consumption scenario is particularly strong when the cost of mortgage default
30:1432:104253:15:16:60:553:667:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:is low. We proxy for the cost of default by whether or not the transaction occurred in a recourse state. In recourse
30:1433:104369:16:16:60:553:651:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:states, lenders can collect on debt not covered by the sale of a foreclosed property by going after other assets of the
30:1434:104488:16:15:60:554:635:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:defaulting borrowers. This substantially increases the cost of default for borrowers in recourse states.36Table 1
30:1435:104601:15:16:60:553:620:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:shows that about half of our transactions come from recourse states. Consistent with the predictions from Section
30:1436:104714:16:16:60:553:604:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:2.2.1 for the housing-as-consumption scenario, we find that the effect of friends’ average house price experiences
30:1437:104828:16:15:60:553:588:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:on individuals’ leverage choice is about twice as large for transactions in non-recourse states. Similarly, the effect
30:1438:104946:15:16:60:553:573:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of a higher standard deviation of friends’ house price experiences on mortgage leverage choice is over five times
30:1439:105059:16:16:60:553:557:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:as large in non-recourse states as it is in recourse states. This provides strong evidence that the downpayment
30:1440:105170:16:15:60:553:541:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:protection force, which is central to the housing-as-consumption scenario, is indeed stronger in legal environments
30:1441:105285:15:16:60:245:526:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:that feature relatively low costs of default.
30:1442:105330:16:16:75:553:510:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Columns 5 and 6 of Table 3 test the predictions from Section 2.2.2, which highlight that in the housing-as-
30:1443:105437:16:15:60:553:494:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:consumption scenario, the effects of changes in house price beliefs on optimal leverage choice should be smaller if
30:1444:105552:15:16:60:553:479:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the baseline house price belief is more optimistic. When comparing the beliefs of relatively optimistic borrowers,
30:1445:105666:16:16:60:553:463:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:either in the time-series, or the cross-section, all borrowers expect to repay their mortgage most of the time, and
30:1446:105781:16:15:60:553:447:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:there is little disagreement about the probability of default that is central to leverage choices in the housing-
30:1447:105894:15:16:60:553:432:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:as-consumption scenario. Column 5 interacts our measures of friends’ house price experiences with the mean of
30:1448:106003:16:16:60:553:416:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:friends’ house price experiences. The estimates show that changes in both the mean and the variance of friends’
30:1449:106114:16:15:60:553:400:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:house price experiences have smaller effects for individuals’ already starting from an already higher mean house
30:1450:106226:15:16:60:553:385:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:price expectation.  This concavity in the effect of mean house price experiences is a central prediction of the
30:1451:106337:16:16:60:205:369:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:housing-as-consumption scenario.
30:1452:106369:16:15:75:553:353:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:In column 6, we interact the mean and the standard deviation of friends’ house price experiences with a dummy
30:1453:106478:15:16:60:553:338:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:variable that captures whether or not the average house price experiences of all buyers in the purchase zip code-
30:1454:106591:16:16:60:553:322:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:month were above the sample median value. These transactions usually occur during the later years of our sample,
30:1455:106703:16:15:60:553:306:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:when the housing market had started to enter a recovery period, and when homebuyers were generally expecting
30:1456:106811:15:16:60:553:291:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:future house price increases (see Case, Shiller and Thompson, 2012, and Kuchler and Zafar, 2015, for evidence on
30:1457:106923:16:16:60:553:275:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:such extrapolative house price expectations). Consistent with the predictions from the housing-as-consumption
30:1458:107032:16:15:60:553:259:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:framework, the effects of both the mean and standard deviation of friends’ house price experiences on the leverage
30:1459:107146:15:16:60:553:244:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:choice are significantly larger in absolute terms during the housing bust period than they are during the recovery
30:1460:107260:16:16:60:553:228:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:period.37This is consistent with the downpayment protection force being particularly strong during periods when
30:1461:107371:16:15:60:542:212:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:there is a comparatively large disagreement between optimists and pessimists about the probability of default.
30:1462:107481:15:16:75:553:197:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:In column 7, we interact the mean and variance of the house price experiences of a homebuyers’ friends with
30:1463:107588:16:15:60:553:181:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the homeownership rate in the zip code of the transaction. The homeownership rate is one proxy for the extent of
30:1464:107700:15:12:68:553:166:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:36Ghent and Kudlyak (2011) analyze mortgage default behavior across U.S. states, and find strong evidence that the recourse/non-
30:1465:107828:12:9:60:553:154:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:recourse environment does indeed have significant effects on the default behavior of borrowers, as would be predicted if it induced
30:1466:107959:9:10:60:553:145:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:significant differences in the costs of default. Specifically, the authors find that at the average value of negative equity, the monthly
30:1467:108096:10:9:60:553:135:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:probability of default is 1.3 times higher in non-recourse states than it is in recourse states. All else equal, this means that it takes
30:1468:108233:9:10:60:553:126:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:8.6% more negative equity to make the probability of default in a recourse state the same as the probability of default in a non-recourse
30:1469:108370:10:9:60:75:116:8:g_d0_f6:6:g_d0_f5:state. See also the discussion in Kuchler and Stroebel (2009).37
30:1470:108434:9:10:75:553:107:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:A potential concern when interpreting these differential effects across time comes from the fact that we only observe the friendship
30:1471:108566:10:9:60:553:97:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:network at one point in time, July 2015.  This networks becomes a noisier measure of individuals’ contemporaneous network the
30:1472:108691:9:10:60:553:88:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:further back we go, which could induce increased attenuation bias for measuring friends’ house price experiences for buyers in earlier
30:1473:108825:10:9:60:553:78:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:transactions. However, given that the housing bust period preceded the housing recovery period, such an attenuation bias would
30:1474:108951:9:0:60:522:69:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:reduce the measured effect during the housing bust period, and therefore work against producing the effect that we uncover.

31:1476:109188:15:16:60:553:714:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:In markets with a low homeownership rate, individuals wanting to live in a certain zip code (for example, because
31:1477:109301:16:16:60:553:698:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of proximity to work or good schools) are more likely to find a suitable rental property than individuals wanting
31:1478:109414:16:15:60:553:682:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:to live in zip codes with extremely high homeownership rates. The estimates show that the effects of house price
31:1479:109526:15:16:60:553:667:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:beliefs on leverage choices are of the same direction across the entire support of the distribution of homeownership
31:1480:109642:16:16:60:553:651:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:rates. However, in regions with high homeownership rates, the effects of increased perceptions of the possibility
31:1481:109755:16:15:60:553:635:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of default on leverage choice are larger, because, in those regions, reducing the downpayment is a comparatively
31:1482:109867:15:16:60:382:620:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:easier way for households to reduce their exposure to the housing market.
31:1483:109940:16:16:75:553:604:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Taken together, the behavior of the homebuyers in our sample corresponds to the predictions from the housing-
31:1484:110049:16:15:60:553:588:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:as-consumption scenario, with a sizable collateral adjustment friction preventing relatively pessimistic homebuyers
31:1485:110164:15:16:60:553:573:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:from purchasing a substantially smaller home to live in.38These pessimistic homebuyers therefore make smaller
31:1486:110273:16:16:60:553:557:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:downpayments in order to reduce their housing market exposures, in particular in states where the cost of default
31:1487:110386:16:15:60:553:541:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:is comparatively smaller, and in particular during time periods when there are concerns about substantial price
31:1488:110497:15:33:60:186:526:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:drops in the housing market.
31:1489:110525:33:22:60:451:493:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:3.4  Robustness Checks and Ruling Out Alternative Explanations
31:1490:110587:22:15:60:553:471:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Our interpretation of the results in Section 3.3 is that the relationship between friends’ house price experiences and
31:1491:110705:15:16:60:553:456:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:leverage was driven by the effects of friends’ experiences on an individual’s belief about future house price growth.
31:1492:110822:16:16:60:553:440:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:In this section, we rule out a number of alternative interpretations of the correlation between friends’ house price
31:1493:110938:16:15:60:553:424:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:experiences and individuals’ mortgage leverage choice. As we address these alternative interpretations, we note
31:1494:111049:15:16:60:553:409:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:that most of these stories could have potentially explained the effect of friends’ average house price experiences
31:1495:111163:16:16:60:553:393:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:on leverage. However, the effect of the dispersion of friends’ house price experiences on leverage choices are much
31:1496:111278:16:15:60:553:377:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:harder to rationalize with alternative mechanisms, as are the differential effects across recourse/non-recourse states,
31:1497:111397:15:16:60:540:362:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:across periods with relatively high/low average beliefs, and across regions with different homeownership rates.
31:1498:111508:16:16:75:553:346:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A first concern we address is that the instruments in our baseline regression, the moments of the house price
31:1499:111617:16:15:60:553:330:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:experiences of out-of-commuting zone friends, might still be correlated with the individuals’ own house price
31:1500:111726:15:16:60:553:315:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:experiences, and therefore potentially with their own capital gains, in particular for individuals who have more
31:1501:111838:16:16:60:553:299:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:friends in close-by commuting zones that have house price movements similar to those in their own commuting
31:1502:111945:16:15:60:553:283:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:zone. In column 1 of Table 4, we therefore use moments of the house price experiences of out-of-state friends as
31:1503:112057:15:16:60:553:268:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:instruments. Reassuringly, the magnitudes of the effects in this specification are, if anything, slightly larger than
31:1504:112174:16:16:60:187:252:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:in our baseline specifications.
31:1505:112205:16:15:75:553:236:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:In column 2 of Table 4, we restrict the sample to purchases by individuals who have more than 50 out-of-
31:1506:112309:15:16:60:553:221:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:commuting zone friends; in column 3, we restrict the sample to transactions by individuals with friends in at
31:1507:112418:16:16:60:553:205:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:least 35 counties. These specifications address concerns that the effects of the dispersion of friends’ experiences
31:1508:112533:16:15:60:553:189:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:on leverage could be driven by individuals without sufficiently many geographically distant friends to construct
31:1509:112645:15:16:60:553:174:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:powerful shifters of the belief distribution. Reassuringly, the magnitude of the estimates are very similar to those
31:1510:112761:16:16:60:183:158:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:in the baseline specification.
31:1511:112791:16:15:75:554:142:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A further possible concern is that unobserved shocks to an individual’sabilityto make a downpayment in
31:1512:112893:15:16:60:553:127:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:a given year might be correlated with her friends’ house price experiences in that year.  Such an alternative
31:1513:113002:16:15:60:553:111:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:interpretation requires a shock to an individual’s wealth or income that contemporaneously moves house prices
31:1514:113111:15:12:68:553:96:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:38One caveat regarding the generalizability of these findings is that our sample is restricted to purchases by owner-occupiers, since
31:1515:113244:12:9:60:553:84:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:we cannot match buyers making investment purchases to their respective Facebook accounts. While we do not have the data to analyze
31:1516:113374:9:10:60:553:75:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:the leverage choices of these investment buyers, our theoretical framework suggests that those individuals should face a much smaller
31:1517:113507:10:0:60:539:65:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:collateral adjustment friction. They might therefore respond to increasing optimism by buying more houses with higher leverage.

32:1556:114800:9:10:60:553:433:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:include controls and fixed effects as in column 2 of Table 3. In columns 1, we instrument for moments of the house price experiences
32:1557:114932:10:9:60:553:423:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:of the buyers total friends with the corresponding moments of the distribution of house price experiences of the buyers’ out-of-state
32:1558:115065:9:10:60:553:414:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:friends. In column 2, we restrict the sample to purchases by individuals with at least 50 out-of-commuting zone friends, in column 3
32:1559:115197:10:9:60:553:404:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:to purchases by individuals with friends in at least 35 unique counties. Column 4 also controls for the average income changes in the
32:1560:115330:9:9:60:553:395:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:counties where an individual has friends. In column 5, we focus on purchases by individuals working in geographically non-clustered
32:1561:115461:9:10:60:553:386:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:professions (e.g., teachers and lawyers). Column 6 also controls for the average foreclosure share in the counties where an individual

32:1563:115728:9:10:60:553:367:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:house price experiences of all friends. Standard errors are clustered at the zip code×transaction-month level. Significance Levels: *

32:1565:115897:32:15:60:553:325:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:in geographically distant regions where she has friends.  As discussed above, our baseline regressions already
32:1566:116007:15:16:60:553:310:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:minimize the scope for such potentially confounding effects, by including year-specific controls for a large number
32:1567:116122:16:16:60:553:294:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of observable characteristics of homebuyers. We next address the one additional potential confounder that we were
32:1568:116235:16:15:60:553:278:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:able to identify. In particular, many people have friends that work in the same sector of the economy. If economic
32:1569:116349:15:16:60:553:263:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:activity in that sector features significant geographic clustering (e.g., tech in Silicon Valley), positive shocks to
32:1570:116466:16:16:60:553:247:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:that sector in a given year might both enable an individual to make a larger downpayment and drive up aggregate
32:1571:116577:16:15:60:397:231:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:house prices in those sector-exposed regions where the individual has friends.
32:1572:116655:15:16:75:553:216:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:To rule out this explanation of our findings, column 4 includes the average income change in the county where
32:1573:116764:16:16:60:553:200:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the person has friends as a control, in addition to the average house price change. We measure income annually at
32:1574:116877:16:15:60:553:184:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the county level using data from the Tax Statistics of Income (SOI). In addition, in column 5 we restrict the sample
32:1575:116993:15:16:60:553:169:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of transactions to those in which the homebuyer works in geographically non-clustered professions (e.g., lawyers
32:1576:117105:16:16:60:553:153:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:and teachers). Any positive shocks to such professions, which might increase those individuals’ ability to make a
32:1577:117218:16:15:60:553:137:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:larger downpayment, should not affect house prices in regions where they have friends. This is because there are
32:1578:117330:15:16:60:553:122:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:no parts of the country where there are so many teachers or lawyers that positive shocks to those professions can
32:1579:117443:16:16:60:553:106:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:shift aggregate house prices. In both specifications the estimates are similar to our baseline estimates, confirming
32:1580:117559:16:15:60:553:90:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:that common shocks to individuals and their friends that shift house prices in areas where their friends live cannot
32:1581:117675:15:16:60:149:75:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:explain our findings.
32:1582:117696:16:0:75:553:59:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Lastly, a potential alternative interpretation of our findings is that when house prices decline in counties where
33:1583:117812:0:15:60:553:729:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:an individual has friends, and there are subsequently more foreclosures in those counties, individuals might update
33:1584:117927:15:16:60:553:714:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:both their own house price beliefs as well as their expectations about the cost of default or the benefits of the
33:1585:118040:16:16:60:553:698:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:foreclosure process, both of which might also directly affect their leverage choice. To address such concerns, column
33:1586:118157:16:15:60:553:682:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:6 also includes measures of the share of all properties in friends’ counties that experienced a foreclosure over the
33:1587:118273:15:16:60:553:667:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:previous 24 months, based on data provided by Zillow. While a higher foreclosure rate in friends’ locations is
33:1588:118383:16:16:60:553:651:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:associated with larger leverage and a smaller downpayment, the inclusion of this additional control variable does
33:1589:118496:16:15:60:553:635:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:not significantly affect the estimated effect of friends’ house price experiences on mortgage leverage choice.39In
33:1590:118610:15:16:60:553:620:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:column 7, we only use the house price experiences of friends in recourse states to instrument for the house price
33:1591:118723:16:16:60:553:604:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:experiences of all friends. If most of the effect came through individuals learning about the cost of default when
33:1592:118837:16:15:60:553:588:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:house prices fall where their friends live, then the estimated effect should be smaller when only using variation in
33:1593:118953:15:16:60:553:573:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:house prices in recourse states where house price changes translate less into foreclosures. However, the estimated
33:1594:119067:16:22:60:266:557:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:coefficients are, in fact, almost identical in size.

33:1618:120542:9:10:60:553:247:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:our baseline specification on the restricted sample for comparability. In columns 2, 4, and 6, we use the house price experiences of an
33:1619:120677:10:9:60:553:237:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:individual’s geographically distant work friends, college friends, and family members, respectively, to instrument the corresponding
33:1620:120809:9:10:60:553:228:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:moments of the house price experiences among all friends. In column 7, we only include transactions of individuals who report a

33:1622:121064:9:10:60:553:209:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:instrument for the house price experiences of all friends. Standard errors are clustered at the zip code×transaction-month level.

33:1624:121252:27:16:75:553:172:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:An additional challenge to our interpretation is the potential for wealth effects: if an individual has family in
33:1625:121365:16:16:60:553:156:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:those areas where she has friends, and if those family members own real estate, then house price increases in those
33:1626:121480:16:15:60:553:140:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:areas might increase her expected bequest. This wealth channel could then provide an alternative explanation
33:1627:121588:15:16:60:553:125:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:for why individuals make larger downpayments when their geographically distant friends have experienced higher
33:1628:121698:16:15:60:553:109:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:house price increases. We rule out such an explanation in a number of ways. First, columns 1 to 6 of Table 5
33:1629:121806:15:12:68:553:94:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:39While the house price experiences and foreclosure rate across friends’ counties are naturally correlated, they are far from collinear.
33:1630:121942:12:9:60:553:82:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:Specifically, the extent to which declining house prices translate into more foreclosures depends both on the legal environment across
33:1631:122076:9:10:60:553:73:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:states as well as on the initial level of equity that individuals have in their homes, which, in turn, depends on the entire house price
33:1632:122212:10:0:60:553:63:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:history in the county. In addition, there is a substantial time-lag between the initial house price decline and default/foreclosure activity.
34:1633:122355:0:15:60:553:729:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:separately explore the house price experiences across an individual’s social network of work friends, family friends,
34:1634:122472:15:16:60:553:714:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:and college friends.  Since not all individuals report their family member, their employer, or their college on
34:1635:122583:16:16:60:553:698:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Facebook, these regressions have fewer observations than our baseline estimates. In columns 1, 3, and 5, we run
34:1636:122694:16:15:60:553:682:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:our baseline regression (corresponding to column 2 of Table 3), but only on the set of individuals for whom we can
34:1637:122808:15:16:60:553:667:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:identify at least ten work friends, family friends, and college friends. In columns 2, 4, and 6, we then run the same
34:1638:122925:16:16:60:553:651:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:regression, but only use the house price experiences among out-of-commuting zone work friends, family friends,
34:1639:123035:16:15:60:553:635:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:and college friends, respectively, to instrument for all friends’ house price experiences.40While one might expect
34:1640:123149:15:16:60:553:620:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:to inherit a house from a family member, this is much less likely for a work friend or college friend. Yet, our results
34:1641:123268:16:16:60:553:604:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:are very similar when exploiting variation in house price experiences across these three networks, suggesting that
34:1642:123382:16:15:60:553:588:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:wealth effects are not a key driver of our findings. Finally, in column 7 we restrict our sample to individuals who
34:1643:123497:15:16:60:553:573:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:report their hometown on Facebook, and who purchase a property in their home state. We use the house price
34:1644:123603:16:16:60:553:557:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:experiences of their out-of-state friends as an instrument. For those individuals, the exposure of their expected
34:1645:123716:16:15:60:553:541:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:bequest to out-of-state house price movements is more limited, since most of the properties they might inherit
34:1646:123826:15:16:60:553:526:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:are likely to be located in their home state, yet we find, if anything, a larger correlation between the house price
34:1647:123942:16:39:60:390:510:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:experiences of their geographically distant friends and their leverage choice.

34:1649:124082:25:16:60:553:446:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:The previous section documented that more optimistic individuals make larger downpayments, consistent with the
34:1650:124192:16:15:60:553:430:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:directional predictions from the housing-as-consumption scenario. In this section, we show that this relationship
34:1651:124305:15:16:60:553:415:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:between house price beliefs and mortgage leverage choice is consistent with various additional survey data. We
34:1652:124415:16:16:60:550:399:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:also provide evidence for the importance of the key mechanism underlying the housing-as-consumption scenario.
34:1653:124524:16:15:75:553:383:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:First, we consider data from the New York Fed Survey of Consumer Expectations to corroborate that, in
34:1654:124625:15:16:60:553:368:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:these data, respondents’ anticipated leverage choice is also decreasing in their expectations about future house
34:1655:124737:16:16:60:553:352:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:price growth, and increasing in their expected default probabilities. Second, we use SurveyMonkey to conduct a
34:1656:124847:16:15:60:553:336:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Downpayment Motivation Survey (DMS) that allows us to explore individuals’ leverage choices under various
34:1657:124952:15:16:60:553:321:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:scenarios for future house price growth.  In the survey, individuals select smaller downpayments when the
34:1658:125057:16:16:60:553:305:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:probability of large house price declines increases. We also explore the thought-process behind individuals’ leverage
34:1659:125174:16:15:60:553:289:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:choices. In particular, the DMS elicits a “free text” response asking individuals to describe why they adjusted their
34:1660:125291:15:16:60:553:274:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:downpayment choice across different house price beliefs. Many individuals report to reduce their downpayments
34:1661:125400:16:16:60:553:258:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:in response to a larger probability of house price declines for reasons that are aligned with the key mechanism
34:1662:125511:16:15:60:553:242:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:in the housing-as-consumption scenario, namely that lower downpayments minimize the financial exposure to
34:1663:125616:15:16:60:553:227:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:adverse house price movements. We also show that financial advice websites and blogs regularly highlight the
34:1664:125724:16:16:60:553:211:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:tradeoffs behind the housing-as-consumption scenario when discussing how large a downpayment to make. Lastly,
34:1665:125833:16:15:60:553:195:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:we explore survey evidence on households’ perceived cost of mortgage default, to highlight that these perceived
34:1666:125944:15:16:60:553:180:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:default costs are often small enough to not make defaulting on a mortgage prohibitively expensive, consistent with
34:1667:126058:16:15:60:369:164:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:an important assumption behind the housing-as-consumption scenario.
34:1668:126125:15:12:68:553:149:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:40Bailey et al. (2017a) documented that the average house price experiences across these three separate out-of-commuting zone
34:1669:126250:12:9:60:553:137:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:networks are relatively uncorrelated. This suggests that homebuyers’ family friends do not, in general, live in the same parts of the
34:1670:126383:9:0:60:207:128:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:country as their work or college friends.

35:1684:127378:22:16:60:553:424:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We first analyze survey data from the 2014 Real Estate and Housing Module of the New York Fed Survey of
35:1685:127481:16:16:60:553:408:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Consumer Expectations (SCE).41Within these data, we consider the determinants of individuals’ (anticipated)
35:1686:127588:16:15:60:553:392:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:leverage choice. Our key outcome variable is the answer to the following question asked of current homeowners:
35:1687:127698:15:16:60:553:377:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:“What is the percent chance that over the next 12 months you will apply for an additional loan on your primary
35:1688:127808:16:16:60:553:361:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:residence?” In Figure 8, we explore how the answer to this question differs with respondents’ expectations. In the
35:1689:127922:16:15:60:553:345:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:left panel, we sort respondents by their beliefs about house price growth in their neighborhood over the coming
35:1690:128033:15:16:60:553:330:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:12 months, which was also elicited in the survey. In the right panel, we sort respondents by their answer to the

35:1694:128401:16:15:60:553:267:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:leverage going forward, thereby reducing their financial exposure to the housing market. However, while these
35:1695:128510:15:16:60:553:252:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:results are highly consistent with the key mechanism in the housing-as-consumption scenario, there are other
35:1696:128618:16:16:60:553:236:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:possible explanations for the observed correlations. For example, in regions where the economy is doing badly,
35:1697:128728:16:15:60:553:220:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:individuals might expect house prices to decline and might also fear they have to tap into home equity to smooth
35:1698:128840:15:16:60:553:205:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:out income shocks. Such possibly confounding stories highlight the value of the quasi-orthogonal belief shifters in
35:1699:128955:16:15:60:492:189:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:our main empirical analysis for identifying causal relationships between beliefs and leverage choice.
35:1700:129056:15:12:68:553:174:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:41The Survey of Consumer Expectations is a monthly online survey of a rotating panel of household heads launched by the Federal
35:1701:129183:12:10:60:553:162:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:Reserve Bank of New York in 2013. A household head is defined as the person in the household who owns, is buying, or rents the home.
35:1702:129315:10:9:60:553:152:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:It is nationally representative. New respondents are drawn monthly to match demographic targets from the American Community
35:1703:129438:9:10:60:553:143:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:Survey (ACS), and stay on the panel for up to twelve months before rotating out. The Housing Module is an annual 30-minute add-on
35:1704:129567:10:9:60:553:133:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:to the SCE conducted in February; the set of questions varies by year. In the 2014 implementation, 85% of SCE household heads
35:1705:129692:9:0:60:243:124:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:completed the module, for a sample size of 1,213.
36:1706:129743:0:22:60:289:729:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:4.2  Downpayment Motivation Survey
36:1707:129777:22:16:60:553:707:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:To provide direct evidence on the motivations behind individuals’ mortgage choices, we designed a short
36:1708:129880:16:15:60:553:691:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Downpayment Motivation Survey (DMS) to elicit how and why individuals’ mortgage choices depend on their
36:1709:129983:15:16:60:553:676:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:beliefs about future house price changes.  The most important purpose of this survey is to provide direct
36:1710:130088:16:16:60:553:660:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:evidence that the mechanism behind the housing-as-consumption scenario features regularly in the narratives
36:1711:130195:16:15:60:336:644:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:that individuals have about their own mortgage choice process.
36:1712:130257:15:16:75:553:629:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:The DMS was administered to current homeowners via SurveyMonkey in September 2017. The demographics
36:1713:130356:16:15:60:553:613:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of the survey respondents are described in Appendix C.3. The survey presented individuals with different scenarios
36:1714:130470:15:16:60:553:598:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:about future house price growth, and asked them to recommend one of three possible downpayment choices to a
36:1715:130577:16:24:60:530:582:10:g_d0_f2:7:g_d0_f3:friend. Specifically, the first wave of the survey, administered to 826 respondents, was designed as follows:42
36:1716:130688:24:15:85:528:558:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Your friend is buying a house, and is asking you for advice on what downpayment to choose. The

36:1730:131654:24:16:60:553:287:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:The order of the mortgage options and the order of the optimistic and pessimistic scenarios were randomized
36:1731:131761:16:15:60:553:271:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:across respondents. If the respondent did not change the downpayment recommendation across the two house
36:1732:131865:15:16:60:553:256:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:price scenarios, we asked the following free-text question: “Why did you decide not to change the mortgage
36:1733:131971:16:15:60:553:240:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:recommendation for your friend?”; if the respondent did change the downpayment recommendation, we asked:
36:1734:132075:15:16:60:366:225:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:“Why did you change the mortgage recommendation for your friend?”
36:1735:132140:16:16:75:553:209:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:The second wave of the survey, which had 794 respondents, presented different house price scenarios.  In
36:1736:132244:16:15:60:553:193:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:that wave, the optimistic scenario was house prices that stayed flat with certainty, while the pessimistic scenario
36:1737:132359:15:16:60:553:178:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:involved an equal probability each of a 25% increase and a 25% decrease in house prices. We call this second
36:1738:132467:16:16:60:553:162:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:scenario, which involves a mean-preserving increase in the spread, more pessimistic, because it entails a higher
36:1739:132579:16:15:60:262:146:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:probability of substantial house price declines.
36:1740:132627:15:16:75:553:131:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:For each of the two survey waves, we begin by exploring if and how individuals changed their leverage choices
36:1741:132736:16:16:60:553:115:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:across the two house price scenarios. The left column of Figure 9 analyzes responses to the first survey wave,

38:1784:135370:16:15:60:553:682:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:as-consumption scenario, there is a noticeable shift in the distribution of recommendations towards lower

38:1787:135694:16:15:60:553:635:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:more pessimistic house price scenario than there are people that recommend making a larger downpayment.44In
38:1788:135801:15:16:60:553:620:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Appendix C.3, we explore how changes in downpayment recommendations across the two scenarios differ with
38:1789:135905:16:16:60:553:604:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:demographic characteristics. We find that individuals across all gender, income, and location groups are more
38:1790:136014:16:22:60:503:588:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:likely to recommend reduced downpayments in response to the more pessimistic house price scenario.

38:1841:137783:10:9:60:553:313:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:recommended a smaller downpayment in the more pessimistic house price scenario.  The free-text question asked respondents to
38:1842:137907:9:9:60:553:304:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:explain their decision for changing the mortgage recommendation. In the left panels, we show responses from survey wave 1, where the
38:1843:138039:9:10:60:553:295:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:optimistic scenario was a 50% probability of constant house prices, and a 50% probability of a 25% increase in house prices, and the
38:1844:138171:10:9:60:553:285:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:pessimistic scenario was a 50% probability of constant house prices and a 50% probability of a 25% house price decrease. In the right
38:1845:138304:9:10:60:553:276:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:panels, we show responses from survey wave 2, where the optimistic scenario was house prices that stayed flat, while the pessimistic
38:1846:138436:10:9:60:553:266:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:scenario was a 50% chance each of a 25% house price increase and a 25% house price decrease. The top row shows responses from
38:1847:138561:9:10:60:553:257:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:individuals who were first shown the optimistic scenario, and then recommended a smaller downpayment for the more pessimistic
38:1848:138686:10:9:60:553:247:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:scenario. The bottom row shows responses from individuals who were first shown the pessimistic scenario, and then recommended a
38:1849:138813:9:15:60:258:238:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:larger downpayment for the more optimistic scenario.
38:1850:138865:15:12:68:553:223:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:43Across all house price scenarios and survey waves, the most common recommendation is to make a downpayment of 20%. In
38:1851:138984:12:9:60:553:211:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:addition, the majority of respondents did not change their downpayment recommendation in response to changes in house price
38:1852:139107:9:10:60:553:202:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:expectations.  This is consistent with other factors besides beliefs playing an important role in determining individuals’ leverage
38:1853:139238:10:9:60:553:192:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:choices. The “free text” responses of those individuals who did not change their recommendation provide some insights into what
38:1854:139365:9:10:60:553:183:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:these reasons are. Very common explanations for keeping the downpayment recommendation fixed, usually at 20%, are a desire to
38:1855:139490:10:9:60:553:173:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:reduce the interest rate as much as possible (e.g., “Choice is based on objective to reduce interest as much as possible”; “No matter
38:1856:139623:9:10:60:553:164:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:what, better to have lower interest rate on smaller mortgage”) or to borrow as little as possible (e.g., “Debt, even mortgage debt,
38:1857:139754:10:9:60:553:154:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:makes me uncomfortable.”; “Proverbs 22:7, Romans 13:8”; “Debt is a four-letter word. Don’t borrow one penny more than you need
38:1858:139880:9:10:60:553:145:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:to. Most people live in their homes for more than a few years, anyway.”). Consistent with this last response, a second set of responses
38:1859:140015:10:9:60:553:135:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:suggested that house price beliefs didn’t matter so much for households that did not plan on selling/moving any time soon (e.g.,
38:1860:140143:9:10:60:553:126:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:“Because the interest rate makes the biggest difference to savings over time. Nothing indicated the friend might want to sell in the
38:1861:140275:10:9:60:553:116:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:near future.”; “Because it did not state whether or not he would be staying in the house long term.”) Finally, a number of individuals
38:1862:140409:9:9:60:553:107:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:explicitly recommend at least a 20% downpayment, if at all possible, in order to avoid having to pay private mortgage insurance (“By
38:1863:140541:9:10:60:553:98:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:putting down 20% they eliminate the required mortgage insurance”; “with 20% down you do not have to have mortgage insurance,
38:1864:140665:10:7:60:158:88:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:which is a great savings”).
38:1865:140692:7:12:68:553:81:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:44Individuals are substantially more likely to report a lower downpayment recommendation in the pessimistic scenario if they first
38:1866:140822:12:0:60:485:69:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:get presented with the more optimistic scenario than if they first get presented with the more pessimistic scenario.
39:1867:140940:0:15:75:553:729:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:While it is reassuring to find the same relationship between house price beliefs and mortgage leverage choice
39:1868:141049:15:16:60:553:714:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:in the Downpayment Motivation Survey as in the detailed empirical analysis in Section 3.3, the primary benefit
39:1869:141159:16:16:60:553:698:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of the DMS is our ability to investigate the mechanism behind this relationship, by directly asking individuals to
39:1870:141273:16:15:60:553:682:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:explain why they suggested a smaller downpayment in the more pessimistic house price scenario. Table 6 presents
39:1871:141384:15:16:60:553:667:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:a number of representative explanations by the survey respondents. Importantly, many of the explanations reflect
39:1872:141496:16:16:60:553:651:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:a desire to reduce the financial exposure to the housing asset in case of higher expected default probabilities, which
39:1873:141614:16:15:60:553:635:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:maps directly into the mechanism behind the housing-as-consumption scenario.45Indeed, a number of individuals
39:1874:141723:15:16:60:553:620:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:explicitly mention that through bankruptcy or default a smaller downpayment can allow individuals to avoid the
39:1875:141833:16:32:60:309:604:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:potential capital loss coming from declining house prices.

39:1877:141921:22:16:60:553:550:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Many homebuyers turn to the internet for help in the home purchase and mortgage choice process (see Piazzesi,
39:1878:142030:16:16:60:553:534:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Schneider and Stroebel, 2015). Indeed, financial advice websites and blogs regularly discuss the tradeoffs behind
39:1879:142143:16:15:60:553:518:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:choosing the size of the downpayment, and therefore offer another window into how considerations about future
39:1880:142252:15:16:60:553:503:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:house price changes affect leverage choices. In surveying these financial advice websites, we came across many
39:1881:142362:16:16:60:553:487:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:instances of financial advisors highlighting the risk-shifting benefits of taking out smaller mortgages that are at the
39:1882:142481:16:15:60:553:471:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:heart of the mechanism in the housing-as-consumption scenario. For example, Ric Edelman (2014), the number-
39:1883:142588:15:16:60:553:456:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:one independent financial adviser as ranked by Barron’s in 2009, 2010, and 2012, described the benefits of a large
39:1884:142702:16:24:60:148:440:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:mortgage as follows:
39:1885:142722:24:15:85:528:416:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Have you noticed that your home is worth much more than it was 10 years ago? You might be worried
39:1886:142819:15:16:85:528:401:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:that your home’s value will fall. If you’re afraid that your home’s value might decline, you should sell
39:1887:142923:16:16:85:528:385:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the house before that happens. But you don’t want to do that! It’s your home, after all. You have
39:1888:143020:16:15:85:528:369:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:roots in the community. Uproot the kids? And where would you move? No, selling is not a practical
39:1889:143117:15:16:85:528:354:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:idea. Still, you fret that your home’s equity is at risk. Can you protect it without having to sell? Yes!
39:1890:143222:16:16:85:528:338:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Simply get a new mortgage, and pull the equity out of the house. It’s the same thing as selling, except
39:1891:143325:16:23:85:203:322:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:that you don’t have to sell!
39:1892:143353:23:16:60:553:299:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:In the language of our model: pessimistic homebuyers with a large collateral adjustment friction can reduce their
39:1893:143466:16:16:60:553:283:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:exposure to house price changes by taking on higher leverage. Similarly, the following discussion on The Mortgage
39:1894:143579:16:15:60:553:267:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Reports (2017) highlights that making a 20% downpayment may not be the ideal choice, since “you’re at risk when
39:1895:143690:15:24:60:426:252:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:[your] home value drops. A down payment protects the bank, not the home buyer:”
39:1896:143769:24:16:85:528:228:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Home values are tied to the U.S. economy. Most of the time, the economy is making incremental gains,
39:1897:143869:16:15:85:528:212:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:and home prices rise. But sometimes, the economy falters. This usually happens after extended periods
39:1898:143970:15:20:85:510:197:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of too-hot growth. That happened in the late 2000s. In this situation, consider two home buyers:
39:1899:144066:20:19:85:292:177:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:- Buyer A: Puts 20% down on a $300,000 home
39:1900:144109:19:15:85:349:158:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:- Buyer B: Uses FHA to put 3.5% down on a $300,000 home
39:1901:144164:15:12:68:553:143:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:45While respondents usually provided a reasonable explanation for why they did or did not change their mortgage recommendation,
39:1902:144291:12:10:60:553:131:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:there is a fair amount of noise in the responses (e.g., respondents posting random YouTube links). In addition, some individuals
39:1903:144419:10:9:60:553:121:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:responded with comments along the lines of “no clue,” “not sure,” and “just a feeling.” The presence of such responses is unsurprising
39:1904:144553:9:10:60:553:112:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:given the non-incentivized nature of the survey. Also, when asked why they changed their mortgage recommendation, a small number
39:1905:144681:10:9:60:553:102:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:of individuals responded “I did not.” Investigating these cases suggests that they were most likely responses from individuals who
39:1906:144811:9:10:60:553:93:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:had picked the answer in the same “position” as their previous one, but which, due to the randomization of the downpayment choices
39:1907:144941:10:9:60:553:83:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:presented to respondents, now corresponded to a different downpayment recommendation. The complete set of survey responses is

40:1912:145403:16:15:85:528:682:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:no longer make her payments. This is because banks know they will take a bigger loss repossessing a
40:1913:145502:15:16:85:528:667:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:home with a larger outstanding loan balance. So, really, which home buyer is more conservative? The
40:1914:145601:16:24:85:249:651:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:one who puts the least amount down.
40:1915:145636:24:15:60:553:627:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Appendix C.1 shows additional examples of financial advice websites and blogs highlighting that one benefit of small
40:1916:145752:15:16:60:553:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:downpayments is the limited exposure to potential house price declines. This evidence, combined with the responses
40:1917:145866:16:16:60:553:596:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:to the Downpayment Motivation Survey analyzed in Section 4.2, provides evidence for the channel through which
40:1918:145975:16:15:60:553:580:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:concerns about falling house prices can motivate individuals to make smaller downpayments. Importantly, we
40:1919:146081:15:16:60:553:565:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:do not want to suggest that house beliefs are the only, or even the most important determinant of mortgage
40:1920:146187:16:16:60:553:549:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:leverage choice. However, to the extent that beliefs do affect households’ downpayment decision, there appears to
40:1921:146300:16:15:60:553:533:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:be strong support for the mechanism through which more pessimistic individuals choose lower downpayments in
40:1922:146407:15:33:60:222:518:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the housing-as-consumption scenario.
40:1923:146443:33:22:60:252:485:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:4.4  Beliefs about Default Costs
40:1924:146475:22:15:60:553:463:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:One important reason why more pessimistic individuals make smaller downpayments in the housing-as-
40:1925:146573:15:16:60:553:448:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:consumption scenario is their perception that walking away from an underwater mortgage is not overly costly,
40:1926:146681:16:16:60:553:432:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:either financially or socially. This is very consistent with some of the responses from the Downpayment Motivation
40:1927:146795:16:15:60:553:416:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Survey presented in Table 6. In this final section, we explore additional data to investigate households’ beliefs
40:1928:146908:15:16:60:214:401:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:about the cost of mortgage default.
40:1929:146943:16:16:75:553:385:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We first analyze responses to the following question from the SCE described in Section 4.1: “If somebody with
40:1930:147052:16:15:60:553:369:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:a mortgage like yours and living in your state went through foreclosure, do you think their lender could legally
40:1931:147164:15:16:60:553:354:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:go after some of their other assets (e.g. bank accounts, cars, other property, etc.) to cover the remaining amount
40:1932:147278:16:16:60:553:338:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:they owe?” 55% or respondents said that the bank could legally go after other assets, 45% responded that the
40:1933:147386:16:15:60:553:322:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:bank could not. (As discussed above, the true legal authority of the bank depends on state-level recourse laws.
40:1934:147497:15:16:60:553:307:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Unfortunately, the public release data from the SCE do not contain state identifiers that would allow us to explore
40:1935:147612:16:16:60:553:291:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:whether individual perceptions of banks’ legal authority are correlated with banks’ true legal authority). However,
40:1936:147727:16:15:60:553:275:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:only 77% of those respondents who said that the bank could go after their other assets (which corresponds to 42%
40:1937:147839:15:16:60:553:260:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of all respondents) believed that the bankwouldactually do this.46This suggests that the majority of survey
40:1938:147946:16:16:60:553:244:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:respondents believe that walking away from an underwater mortgage would allow them to discard any negative
40:1939:148052:16:15:60:248:228:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:equity without putting other assets at risk.
40:1940:148096:15:16:75:553:213:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We also review the evidence reported in Guiso, Sapienza and Zingales (2013), who conducted a quarterly survey
40:1941:148205:16:16:60:553:197:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:on the mortgage default beliefs and attitudes of a representative sample of U.S. households between December 2008
40:1942:148318:16:15:60:553:181:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:and September 2010. Consistent with the evidence from the SCE, respondents reported an average probability
40:1943:148424:15:16:60:553:166:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of 53.4% that lenders would go after other assets of defaulters.47In addition, 23% of respondents said that they
40:1944:148536:16:16:60:553:150:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:would walk away from their house (default on their mortgage) if they had more than $100,000 negative equity
40:1945:148643:16:14:60:553:134:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:in the house, even if they were able to repay their loans; this is despite the fact that 82% of respondents argued
40:1946:148757:14:13:68:553:120:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:46The precise question from the SCE is: “If somebody with a mortgage like yours and living in your state went through foreclosure,
40:1947:148887:13:9:60:553:107:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:do you think their lender actually would go after some of their other assets (e.g. bank accounts, cars, other property, etc.) to cover
40:1948:149021:9:7:60:186:98:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:the remaining amount they owe?”
40:1949:149052:7:12:68:553:91:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:47The exact question was: “When people default on their mortgage, the lender repossesses the house. Sometimes the mortgage is
40:1950:149177:12:9:60:553:79:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:more than the value of the house. On a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 equals “absolutely no chance” and 100 equals “absolutely certain”
40:1951:149310:9:10:60:553:70:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:what do you expect are the chances that the lenders will go after people who default on their mortgage for the full amount of the
40:1952:149439:10:0:60:102:60:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:mortgage?”
41:1953:149451:0:15:60:553:729:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:that it was morally wrong to default on a mortgage if it were possible to keep making mortgage payments. While
41:1954:149561:15:16:60:553:714:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:this survey suggests that default costs appear low enough that a substantial proportion of the population would
41:1955:149672:16:16:60:553:698:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:consider defaulting strategically, recall that strategic default is not a necessary condition for our mechanism to
41:1956:149786:16:32:60:159:682:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:work (see Section 1.2).
41:1957:149809:32:22:60:272:650:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:4.5  Collateral Adjustment Friction
41:1958:149844:22:16:60:553:628:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:The behavior of households documented in Section 3 implies the presence of a significant collateral adjustment
41:1959:149954:16:15:60:553:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:friction. As discussed above, this friction captures that individuals’ decisions about what house to buy are not
41:1960:150066:15:16:60:553:597:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:just determined by their investment motives, but also by their consumption motives. A high collateral adjustment
41:1961:150178:16:16:60:553:581:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:friction means that more pessimistic homebuyers could not reduce their exposure to house price movements by
41:1962:150285:16:15:60:553:565:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:buying a smaller property or moving to a different neighborhood without a substantial decline in their utility from
41:1963:150400:15:16:60:553:550:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:living in their house. Instead, these pessimistic households chose to reduce their downpayment to minimize their
41:1964:150512:16:16:60:553:534:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:housing market exposure. In this section, we analyze data from Zillow’s “Consumer Housing Trends Report 2017”
41:1965:150621:16:15:60:430:518:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:to provide direct evidence for the presence of a sizable collateral adjustment friction.
41:1966:150709:15:16:75:553:503:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:In the survey, a sample of about 3,000 representative homebuyers were asked about the requirements in the
41:1967:150814:16:16:60:553:487:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:selection of their property. With respect to location, 71% of buyers required the home to be in a safe neighborhood,
41:1968:150930:16:15:60:553:471:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:40% required off-street parking, 39% required that the house was in their preferred neighborhood, and 29% required
41:1969:151044:15:16:60:553:456:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:that the house was in their preferred school district. Other neighborhood requirements were proximity to shopping
41:1970:151157:16:16:60:553:440:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:(29% of respondents), proximity to work (28%), proximity to family and friends (26%) and proximity to public
41:1971:151265:16:15:60:553:424:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:transportation (18%). With respect to the actual property, 67% of respondents required the home to be within
41:1972:151373:15:16:60:553:409:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:their initial price range, 62% required that the property had air conditioning, 62% required that it had their
41:1973:151483:16:16:60:553:393:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:preferred number of bedrooms, and 53% that it had the preferred number of bathrooms.  Other requirements
41:1974:151587:16:15:60:553:377:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:were that the property had private outdoor space (48% of respondents), that it had the preferred square footage
41:1975:151698:15:16:60:553:362:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:(47%), that it had a layout that fit the buyers’ preferences (47%), that it had ample storage (41%), and that it
41:1976:151810:16:16:60:553:346:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:had the buyers’ preferred utilities (40%). Only 40% of respondents required that the property had good potential
41:1977:151922:16:15:60:553:330:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:to increase in value.  This suggests that, consistent with a sizable collateral adjustment frictions, homebuyers
41:1978:152034:15:39:60:535:315:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:regularly perceive the consumption aspect of the property to be more important than the investment aspect.
41:1979:152140:39:25:60:161:276:14:g_d0_f7:14:g_d0_f7:5  Conclusion
41:1980:152153:25:16:60:553:251:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We develop a parsimonious model of mortgage leverage determination in the presence of heterogeneous beliefs
41:1981:152260:16:16:60:553:235:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:to show that the relationship between homebuyers’ optimism and leverage crucially depends on the degree of
41:1982:152366:16:15:60:553:219:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:collateral adjustment frictions faced by homebuyers. When households primarily maximize the levered return of
41:1983:152475:15:16:60:553:204:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:their property investment (small collateral adjustment friction), more pessimistic homebuyers reduce their leverage
41:1984:152590:16:16:60:553:188:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:to purchase smaller houses (housing-as-investment scenario). However, when the collateral adjustment friction is
41:1985:152702:16:15:60:553:172:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:large and considerations such as family size pin down the desired property size, the only way for pessimistic
41:1986:152811:15:16:60:553:157:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:homebuyers to reduce the size of their exposure to the housing market is by reducing their downpayment and
41:1987:152917:16:16:60:553:141:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:increasing their leverage (housing-as-consumption scenario). Our empirical findings show that borrowers’ beliefs
41:1988:153029:16:15:60:553:125:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:indeed play an important role in determining borrowers’ leverage decisions.  We show that more pessimistic
41:1989:153135:15:16:60:553:110:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:individuals take on more leverage, in particular during periods of declining house prices, and in particular in states
41:1990:153253:16:16:60:553:94:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:with a relatively low cost of default. These findings are consistent with a large collateral adjustment friction, and
41:1991:153370:16:0:60:313:78:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:map most closely to the housing-as-consumption scenario.

46:2189:164652:13:12:60:553:512:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:decoupled into two problems. First, borrowers maximize the levered return on a housing investment. Second, borrowers solve

51:2886:178978:13:12:60:553:135:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:approach is to consider cross-sectional comparisons among borrowers that do not rely on parametric assumptions. This

53:2977:183514:21:13:60:553:696:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:Proposition 5 shows that borrowers’ optimism, measured as hazard rate dominance, has opposite predictions in the polar
53:2978:183632:13:12:60:553:683:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:scenarios we consider for any value ofκi. More optimistic borrowers take on more leverage in the housing-as-investment
53:2979:183750:12:13:60:553:671:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:scenario, but they take on less leverage in the housing-as-consumption scenario. These results generalize the insights from
53:2980:183873:13:12:60:553:658:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:the case with normally distributed beliefs, but they are not exactly identical. We show in the Appendix that, when beliefs
53:2981:183995:12:13:60:553:646:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:are normally distributed, a distribution with a higher mean dominates in a hazard rate sense a distribution with a lower
53:2982:184115:13:13:60:553:633:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:mean (holding its variance constant).  Hence, when comparing means in the normal case, the results of Proposition 1
53:2983:184230:13:12:60:553:620:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:are implied by those of Proposition 5. However, we also show that, in the normal context, a distribution with a higher
53:2984:184348:12:13:60:553:608:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:variance does not dominate in a hazard rate sense a distribution with a lower variance (holding its mean constant). This
53:2985:184468:13:12:60:553:595:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:illustrates that hazard rate dominance is only a sufficient (not a necessary) condition to derive unambiguous predictions for
53:2986:184593:12:27:60:274:583:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:the relationships between beliefs and leverage choice.

53:3152:186269:19:12:60:553:142:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:The empirical results presented in Sections 3.3 and 3.4 test the predictions from our model under the assumption
53:3153:186381:12:13:60:553:130:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:that individuals’ beliefs about future house price changes are normally distributed.  We argued that this is a realistic
53:3154:186501:13:13:60:553:117:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:approximation, given the shape of the distribution of actual house price changes. In Section B.1, we also derived non-
53:3155:186619:13:12:60:553:104:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:parametric predictions on the relative mortgage leverage choices of individuals with arbitrary belief distributions.  In
53:3156:186739:12:13:60:553:92:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:particular, we showed that an individual whose belief distribution dominated that of an otherwise identical individual in
53:3157:186860:13:12:60:553:79:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:the sense of hazard rate dominance would choose higher leverage in the housing-as-investment scenario, but lower leverage
53:3158:186981:12:0:60:221:67:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:in the housing-as-consumption scenario.
54:3159:187022:0:12:75:553:729:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:While we are not able to measure the full belief distribution of each individual, we can compare how the leverage
54:3160:187135:12:13:60:553:717:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:choices of individuals vary with the full distribution of the house price experiences of their friends.51Specifically, we
54:3161:187256:13:13:60:553:704:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:conduct pairwise comparisons of the distributions of the house price experiences of all friends (and all out-of-commuting
54:3162:187377:13:12:60:553:691:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:zone friends) of individuals purchasing houses in the same county in the same month, and who borrow from the same
54:3163:187490:12:13:60:553:679:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:lender. We then test whether one distribution dominates the other in a hazard rate dominance sense. We only focus on
54:3164:187606:13:12:60:553:666:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:county-month-lender combinations with at least three mortgage originations: at the average (median) such combination, we
54:3165:187726:12:13:60:553:654:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:have 9.8 (5) mortgage originations. Of all the pairwise comparisons across these originations, we can rank the distribution
54:3166:187849:13:13:60:553:641:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:of all friends’ house price experiences in a hazard rate sense for 3.5% of transaction pairs, and the distributions of out-
54:3167:187972:13:12:60:553:628:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:of-commuting zone friends’ house price experiences for 8.1% of transaction pairs. When comparing the mortgage leverage
54:3168:188090:12:13:60:553:616:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:choices across the individuals with a clear ranking using the experience distribution of all friends, we find that individuals
54:3169:188216:13:12:60:553:603:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:with an experience distribution that is hazard rate dominant will choose 90 basis points lower leverage; this difference is
54:3170:188339:12:13:60:553:591:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:highly statistically significant. When comparing the experience distribution of individuals’ out-of-commuting zone friends,
54:3171:188462:13:13:60:553:578:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:those with a hazard rate dominant distribution choose a 68 basis points lower leverage.  Both of these results provide
54:3172:188580:13:12:60:553:565:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:additional evidence that the housing-as-consumption scenario with a sizable collateral adjustment friction is dominant in

54:3184:189201:19:12:60:553:128:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:As discussed in Section 4, many personal financial advice websites and blogs discuss the tradeoffs between making larger
54:3185:189321:12:13:60:553:116:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:and smaller downpayments.  Many of these highlight explicitly the tradeoffs that we formally model in Section 1.  For
54:3186:189438:13:13:60:553:103:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:example, the real estate brokerage website Home Point Real Estate describes one of the benefits of high leverage as follows:
54:3187:189562:13:12:68:553:90:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:51This test builds on the survey evidence in Section 3.2, which showed that, on average, the first and second moments of the house
54:3188:189692:12:10:60:553:78:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:price experiences of an individual’s friends affect the corresponding moments of her belief distribution about future house price changes.
54:3189:189830:10:9:60:553:68:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:The assumption underlying the test in this section is that additional moments of the distribution of individuals’ friends’ house price
54:3190:189964:9:0:60:407:59:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:experiences will also shift the corresponding moments of those individuals’ belief distribution.
55:3191:190063:0:12:85:528:729:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:This last reason for putting down a small down payment is kind of twisted, but sadly practical. I doubt we
55:3192:190169:12:13:85:528:717:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:are going to have any down turn in the market soon, and I really doubt it will be like the one we just came
55:3193:190276:13:13:85:528:704:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:through if it does come; but the less you put down the less you lose. Yet, if you are upside down on your home
55:3194:190386:13:16:85:498:691:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:and have to walk away (or lose to foreclosure) the less down payment you put into it the less you lose.
55:3195:190489:16:17:60:364:675:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:Reuters (2011) outlines similar reasons for making a smaller downpayment:
55:3196:190562:17:12:85:528:658:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:Even if you have the money for a bigger down payment, there can be good reasons to save your cash. Mortgage
55:3197:190669:12:13:85:528:646:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:rates continue to skirt all-time lows: Why not put your money to work for yourself and borrow as much as you
55:3198:190777:13:12:85:528:633:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:can reasonably afford, on a monthly basis, at today’s rates? You can put the money you’re not paying into a
55:3199:190884:12:13:85:528:621:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:down payment to work elsewhere. If home values rise, you will have done your best to leverage a small down
55:3200:190990:13:13:85:528:608:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:payment into bigger equity. If they fall, you’ll have less skin in the game, and that could put more pressure on
55:3201:191102:13:16:85:327:595:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:your banker to improve your loan terms lest you walk away.
55:3202:191160:16:17:60:369:579:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:US News (2017) described the benefits of a smaller downpayment as follows:
55:3203:191234:17:12:85:528:562:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:The last major housing crash scared some people away from low down payments after many homeowners
55:3204:191331:12:13:85:528:550:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:found themselves owing more than their homes were worth when values plummeted. But even a 20 percent
55:3205:191431:13:12:85:528:537:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:down payment won’t protect you against a 50 percent drop in home values. In fact, if you lost your home to
55:3206:191537:12:17:85:476:525:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:foreclosure or did a short sale, you may have lost less money if you made a small down payment.
55:3207:191632:17:12:60:553:508:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:MK Real Estate (2016) describes why making smaller downpayments is the more conservative choice for home buyers
55:3208:191743:12:17:60:231:496:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:worried about potential house price drops.
55:3209:191785:17:13:85:528:479:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:The link between the economy and home prices is the third reason to consider a small down payment. In
55:3210:191886:13:12:85:528:466:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:general, as the U.S. economy improves, home values rise. When the U.S. economy sags, home values sink.
55:3211:191988:12:13:85:528:454:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:Buyers with large down payments find themselves over-exposed to economic downturns compared to buyers
55:3212:192089:13:14:85:217:441:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:whose down payments are small.
55:3213:192119:14:13:85:528:427:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:Consider the purchase of a $400,000 home and two home buyers, each with different ideas about how to buy a
55:3214:192225:13:12:85:528:414:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:home. One buyer makes a 20% down payment to avoid Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI). The other buyer
55:3215:192324:12:13:85:528:402:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:wants to stay as liquid as possible, and puts down just 3.5%. The first buyer takes $80,000 from the bank and
55:3216:192433:13:15:85:415:389:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:converts it to illiquid home equity. The second buyer puts $14,000 into the home.
55:3217:192514:15:12:85:528:374:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:Over the next few years, the economy falters. Our two buyers lose 20% of the value of each of their homes,
55:3218:192620:12:13:85:528:362:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:bringing their values down to $320,000. Neither buyer has any equity left. Our first buyer lost all $80,000 of
55:3219:192730:13:12:85:528:349:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:their money. That money is lost and cannot be recouped except through the housing market’s recovery. The
55:3220:192834:12:13:85:528:337:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:second buyer lost only $14,000. While the second buyer’s home is “underwater,” with more money owed on
55:3221:192936:13:15:85:431:324:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:the home than the home is worth, the bank has the risk of loss and not the borrower.
55:3222:193020:15:12:85:528:309:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:Let’s say that both borrowers default and no longer make their payments. Which homeowner will the bank
55:3223:193122:12:13:85:528:297:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:be more likely to foreclose upon? It’s counter-intuitive, but the buyer who made a large down payment is less
55:3224:193231:13:12:85:528:284:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:likely to get relief during a time of crisis and is more likely to face foreclosure. A bank’s losses are limited to
55:3225:193346:12:13:85:528:272:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:when the home is sold at foreclosure. The homeowner’s twenty percent home equity is already gone, so the
55:3226:193450:13:13:85:528:259:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:remaining losses (legal and home prep costs) are easily absorbed by the bank. Foreclosing on an underwater
55:3227:193556:13:12:85:528:246:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:home will lead to great losses. All of the borrower’s money is already lost. The bank will not only have legal
55:3228:193666:12:15:85:392:234:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:and home prep costs, but will also have to write down $66,000 in lost value.
55:3229:193742:15:12:85:528:219:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:Conservative borrowers recognize that risk increases with the size of the down payment. The smaller your down
55:3230:193851:12:29:85:211:207:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:payment, the smaller your risk.

55:3232:193916:18:13:60:553:160:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:In Section 4.2, we described results from our Downpayment Motivation Survey. In this Appendix, we provide additional
55:3233:194032:13:13:60:553:147:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:information on the respondent demographics, and more details on how the responses vary with these demographics. For
55:3234:194147:13:12:60:384:134:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:complete disclosure, the full data set is available from the authors upon request.
55:3235:194229:12:13:75:553:122:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:We ran two waves of the survey between September 19, 2017, and September 21, 2017. The survey was designed using
55:3236:194341:13:12:60:553:109:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:the SurveyMonkey survey. Each wave was targeted at approximately 800 homeowners, and no additional filters for the
55:3237:194455:12:13:60:553:97:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:target audience were selected. In each wave, respondents were presented with two different house price growth scenarios,
55:3238:194575:13:13:60:553:84:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:and asked to select one of three different mortgage choices for each house price scenario. In Table A1, we show the changes
55:3239:194698:13:12:60:553:71:9:g_d0_f48:9:g_d0_f48:in the downpayment recommendation between the optimistic and the pessimistic scenario (“Decreased Downpayment”
