2:18:558:20:21:106:555:609:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Abstract. Religious  freedom  after  1989  would  decisively  contribute  to  changes  in  the 
2:19:653:21:21:70:555:588:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:religious structure. From a religious point of view, the fall of the communist regime meant the end 
2:20:753:21:20:70:555:567:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of a time of abuse or interdictions for many people and communities. Discussing about ecumenism 
2:21:849:20:21:70:555:547:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and  interreligious  or  inter-confessional  dialogue  in  Bihor  is,  according  to  current  demographic 
2:22:956:21:21:70:555:526:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:realities,  a  need  entailed  by  the  ethno-confessional  diversity  and  multiculturalism  specific  to  the 
2:23:1068:21:21:70:555:505:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:area. The great religious diversity has led not only to inter-community tensions but also to a better 
2:24:1170:21:20:70:556:484:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:knowledge,  a  phenomenon  that  has  finally  led  to  dialogue  and  relationships. There  is  a  visible 
2:25:1278:20:21:70:555:464:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:tendency  towards  the  realization  of  a  unity  in  diversity,  at  the  same  time  seeing  the  obstacles  that 
2:26:1395:21:21:70:556:443:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exist in front of this vision. Beyond the energetic discourse of high Christian officials, contemporary 
2:27:1499:21:20:70:555:422:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f7:ecumenism has several impediments imposed by the reality of some “small” local issues that have 
2:28:1595:20:21:70:555:402:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:remained unsolved throughout years. Few times, these disputes have a theological understatement 
2:29:1691:21:21:70:313:381:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:meant to prevent a genuine ecumenical dialogue.

2:37:2222:21:20:70:556:215:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:prevent  a  genuine  ecumenical  dialogue.  Debates  such  as  the  one  between  the  priest  of the Sfânta 
2:38:2330:20:21:70:555:195:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Treime Orthodox church in Oradea and Bishop Laszlo Tokes for the sports ground of the Lorantffy 
2:39:2426:21:21:70:555:174:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Zsuzsanna  Secondary-school coordinated by the “Piatra Craiului” Reformed Bishopric  (that  lasted 
2:40:2524:21:21:70:555:153:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for  over  four  years)  turned  into  a  local  and  national  media  argument  leading  to  the  boycott  of  the 
2:41:2640:21:20:70:555:132:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Ecumenical  Assembly  in  Sibiu  (September  2007)  by  the Reformed Bishop.  The Reformed Bishop

3:46:3168:0:21:70:555:755:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:made serious allegations regarding the “discrimination against minority churches in Romania”. The 
3:47:3266:21:21:70:556:734:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:allegations  of  the  Bishop  were  a  consequence  of  the  fact  that  he  and  other  representatives  of  the 
3:48:3380:21:20:70:555:713:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Reformed Church  were  subpoenaed  to  the  Supreme  Court  in  a  trial  sued  by  the  Orthodox  priest 
3:49:3485:20:21:70:555:693:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:Aurel Puşcaş1.  On  the  other  hand,  the Reformed official was accused of “stirring anti-Romanian 
3:50:3584:21:21:70:556:672:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:spirits” and of “making God a private concern”2.  The  tensions  were  encouraged and  local  media 
3:51:3683:21:20:70:555:651:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:expanded them; thus, a natural process for interethnic and inter-confessional dialogue in the  Bihor 
3:52:3784:20:21:70:555:631:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:area was troubled. Beyond these tensions, most of the times isolated, and the ecumenism partisans’ 
3:53:3883:21:21:70:555:610:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:discourse, we can see an opening to dialogue. Most of the times, this dialogue is easy to realise due 
3:54:3985:21:20:70:555:589:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to human dialogue in the daily life of Christian  confessions parishioners. Such a trend is provided 
3:55:4086:20:21:70:555:569:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:by  secularisation  and  globalisation  specific  to  contemporary  time.  Interreligious  dialogue  is also 
3:56:4195:21:21:70:555:548:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:envisaged  in  the  process  of  European  construction,  of  establishing  a  European  identity  (such  a 
3:57:4303:21:21:70:469:527:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:process goes beyond mere respect for European law in point of minorities’ rights).

3:60:4462:21:21:106:555:465:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  political  events  that  took  place  in  1989,  marked  especially  by  the  fall  of  communism 
3:61:4565:21:20:70:555:444:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:globalization, emerged The European Union, which will incorporate all the other European states in 
3:62:4664:20:21:70:123:424:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the future. 
3:63:4675:21:21:106:556:403:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  new  Europe  will  bring  together  a  plurality  of religions,  traditions  and  cultures.  The 
3:64:4777:21:20:70:555:382:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:process  of  European  integration  has  not  only  political  implications,  but  also  economic,  political, 
3:65:4888:20:21:70:538:362:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:social and religious implications. A political structure can not exist without religious consensus3. 
3:66:4988:21:21:70:556:341:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: But what kind of religious consensus is required nowadays? What will the religious identity 
3:67:5080:21:20:70:555:320:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of the New Europe be like? These questions need to be answered in the context of postmodernism 
3:68:5175:20:21:70:555:300:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and  secularization.  The  Europeans  are  less  and  less  interested  in  the  church  and  in religion  in 
3:69:5285:21:21:70:555:279:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:general. René Rémond talks about Christianity being abandoned in Europe. In England and in the 
3:70:5380:21:21:70:443:258:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Scandinavian countries, only 1-2% of the population go to church regularly4. 
3:71:5456:21:20:70:555:237:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:  On  the  other  hand,  we  can  also  notice  an  ideological  and  religious  division  between 
3:72:5553:20:21:70:555:217:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Western and Eastern Europe. The Catholics and the Protestants live in the West, while the Orthodox 
3:73:5652:21:21:70:555:196:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:live in the East. Moreover, if in the past Europe used to be considered a Christian continent, we can 
3:74:5754:21:20:70:555:175:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:no longer assert this nowadays. On the European continent, there are millions of Muslims; only in 
3:75:5852:20:21:70:555:155:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Great  Britain,  Germany  and  France  there  are  more  than  twelve  million  Muslims5.  Besides  the 
3:76:5956:21:21:70:400:134:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Muslims, we could also mention Judaism and the Oriental religions. 
3:77:6022:21:20:70:556:113:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: In  this  context,  the  building  of  a  New  Europe  requires  a  coherent  interreligious  dialogue. 
3:78:6126:20:0:70:555:93:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:The problem of the importance that Christianity had in forging the „European identity”  has recently 
4:79:6357:0:21:70:555:755:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:come to the fore, in conjunction with the pressing institutional crisis created by the much disputed 
4:80:6458:21:21:70:466:734:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:European constitution which was rejected by the French and Dutch referendums6. 
4:81:6536:21:20:106:555:713:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  continuation  of  the  process  of  European  construction  imposes  the  realization  of  some 
4:82:6637:20:21:70:555:693:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:important  progress  in  what  the  inter-cultural  dialogue  is  concerned,  meaning  at  the  same  time  the 
4:83:6749:21:21:70:555:672:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:realization  of  a  bridge  between  religious  confessions  and  movements  that  exist  in  Europe.  The 
4:84:6856:21:20:70:555:651:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:importance of this matter results from the „heritage” of the European space. The renegotiation of 
4:85:6954:20:21:70:555:631:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  socio-cultural  status  and  the  guarantee  of  the  juridical  acknowledgement  of  the  religious 
4:86:7060:21:21:70:555:610:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:phenomenon  at  the  European  level    is,  in  this  respect,  the  collective  wish  which  guarantees  the 
4:87:7171:21:20:70:300:589:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:European identity, but also its natural borders7. 
4:88:7220:20:21:106:556:569:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: On the other hand, the idea of the „Christian unity” of Europe has been promoted at least at 
4:89:7313:21:21:70:555:548:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:the discourse level (if we are to take into account the „no” given to the European constitution by the 
4:90:7416:21:21:70:555:527:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:French  for  example,  then  we  notice  that  the  anti-Muslim  discourse  has  been  extended  over  the 
4:91:7523:21:20:70:555:506:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reaction  of  the  population  too)  during the  various  projects  of  reformation  and  extension  of  the 
4:92:7632:20:21:70:555:486:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:European  Union8.  Moreover,  Christian  ecumenism  is  seen  as  a  crucial  factor  of  European  unity. 
4:93:7739:21:21:70:508:465:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:Starting from Christian unity, they try to trace the „ideal” borders of the European Union9. 
4:94:7831:21:20:106:555:444:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:From  the  partial  dissolution  of  some  frictions  existent  among  the  European  confessions,  to 
4:95:7934:20:21:70:555:424:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the first signals addressed to the politicians, or the pleading in favour of environmental problems – 
4:96:8035:21:21:70:406:403:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:all are important if we are to set faith at the foundation of the society. 
4:97:8109:21:20:106:555:382:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f13:Christian unity is beyond the walls of buildings, beyond rituals, beyond dogmas – in Jesus’ 
4:98:8200:20:21:70:555:362:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:being itself: it is the phreatic water and the essence that unites us, even if we want it or not, even if 
4:99:8306:21:21:70:555:341:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:we know it and will find it out sometime. The need for ecumenism is synonymous with the need for 
4:100:8403:21:20:70:179:320:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:spiritual maturation10. 
4:101:8426:20:21:106:555:300:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The   European   Union   decided   that   the   year   2008   would   be   The   European   Year   of 
4:102:8528:21:22:70:402:279:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Intercultural Dialogue. The objectives of this initiative are manifold: 
4:103:8599:22:21:97:343:257:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Enhancing the importance of dialogue in Europe 
4:104:8646:21:22:97:438:236:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: The encouragement of common values and of the notion of dialogue 
4:105:8711:22:21:97:389:214:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: The encouragement of cultural changes and of the debates 
4:106:8768:21:20:106:427:193:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A special attention will be given to the interconfessional dialogue. 
4:107:8836:20:21:70:556:173:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: During this thematic year, a series of events will take place for which there is a budget of 10 
4:108:8932:21:21:70:555:152:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:million  euros.  The  European  Union  will  also  initiate  some  studies  and  consultations  which  will 
4:109:9040:21:20:70:555:131:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:allow  a  long-term  monitoring.  The  thematic  year  will  end  with  an  intercultural  forum  which  will 
4:110:9150:20:21:70:450:111:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reunite the civil society, representatives of various confessions and politicians. 
4:111:9232:21:21:70:555:90:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f13: After the American tragedy of September 11, 2001, European governments „discovered” the 
4:112:9320:21:0:70:555:69:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:importance  of  the  interconfessional  and  interreligious  dialogue,  finally  accepting  the  fact  that  the 
5:113:9563:0:21:70:555:755:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:parallel  and  purely  theoretic  approaches  cannot  replace  the  dialogue  between  those  who  make 
5:114:9667:21:21:70:555:734:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:political decisions and those who represent the religions of the world, starting with the exponents of 
5:115:9770:21:20:70:556:713:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the three monotheisms. The secretary general of The Council of Europe has organised an enlarged 
5:116:9866:20:21:70:555:693:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:group    that  will  deal  with    this  dialogue.  To  this,  Romania  will  participate  with  an  embryonic 
5:117:9977:21:21:70:555:672:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:project11.  [the  creation  in  Bucharest  of  a  European  observatory  for  multicultural  and  interreligious

5:122:10461:20:21:70:555:569:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:European institutions, but the secular modesty regarding the Christian subject will remain for a long 
5:123:10563:21:21:70:555:548:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:time, in the same way as the temptation of the Church to demonize postmodernism will preserve for 
5:124:10661:21:21:70:229:527:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:a while its manipulative vigour.  
5:125:10694:21:20:70:555:506:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: The  European  dignitaries  are  mainly  Catholics  or  Protestants  (we  could  not  talk  about  the 
5:126:10797:20:21:70:555:486:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:presence  of  the  Orthodox,  except  for  those  from  Greece,  Bulgaria,  Romania  and  Cyprus).  It  is 
5:127:10904:21:21:70:555:465:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:desirable that their personal or family links with their churches (until recently important) should not 
5:128:11008:21:20:70:379:444:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:„influence” their professional discourse or official statements12. 
5:129:11074:20:21:70:555:424:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f13: The  ecumenical  movement  has  been  the  horizon  to  which  many  Christians’  hopes  and 
5:130:11167:21:21:70:555:403:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:illusions  headed.  Some  talked  about  manipulations, others  considered  it  devilish.  The  noble, 
5:131:11269:21:20:70:555:382:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:generous  aspects  of  the  ecumenical  movement  and  the  Christian,  spiritual  dimensions    have  been 
5:132:11377:20:21:70:555:362:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:too often forgotten. Moreover, at the third European Ecumenical Assembly, some could notice the 
5:133:11473:21:21:70:556:341:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:presence  of    representatives  belonging  to  other  religions  (Islam,  Judaism),  so  that  we  could  talk 
5:134:11585:21:20:70:359:320:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:about a door open to what is called „extended ecumenism”.

5:137:11711:21:21:106:556:258:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:The term „ecumenical” was first used by the Evangelical Alliance and by the Young Men’s 
5:138:11799:21:20:70:556:237:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Christian Association (YMCA)13  and expresses the idea of Christian unity. According to the latest 
5:139:11898:20:21:70:555:217:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:definition given to the ecumenical movement, ecumenism „covers the search for Christian unity 
5:140:11992:21:21:70:555:196:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:realized by theological study, common testimony for the benefit of the universal task of mission and 
5:141:12093:21:20:70:344:175:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:evangelism, but also by promoting  justice and peace”14. 
5:142:12149:20:21:70:555:155:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: At  the  beginning  of  the  20th  century,  following  the  efforts  of  the  Archbishop  of  Uppsala, 
5:143:12253:21:21:70:555:134:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:Nathan Soderbloms, „the ecumenical movement” became typically known15 for  its  efforts  to  unite 
5:144:12350:21:20:70:555:113:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:the  Christian  churches.  The  term  „ecumenism”  was  first  used    by  Yves  Congar  in  his  book 
5:145:12453:20:21:70:183:93:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:„Chrétiens Desunis”16. 
5:146:12475:21:0:70:472:72:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: The world ecumenical  movement can be divided into three main periods17: 
6:147:12677:0:21:70:555:755:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:- the  beginnings  of  ecumenism  from    the  middle  of  the  19th  century  until  the  beginning  of  the 
6:148:12786:21:21:88:155:734:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:20th century. 
6:149:12799:21:20:70:555:713:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:- The  development  of  the  interconfessional  and  intercontinental  ecumenical  movement  initiated 
6:150:12901:20:21:88:555:693:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:by  the  church,  in  order  to  offer  the  world  a  common  Christian  message  and  a  common 
6:151:12999:21:21:88:359:672:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:testimony of unity – in the first half of the 20th century. 
6:152:13057:21:20:70:555:651:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:- The  conscience  of  the  human  unity  has  become  more  and  more  obvious – since  1950  to  the 
6:153:13158:20:21:88:152:631:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:present day.  
6:154:13171:21:21:70:73:610:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
6:155:13171:21:20:106:298:589:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The European Ecumenical Movement 
6:156:13203:20:21:106:555:569:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In  Europe,  there  are  two  big  ecumenical  organizations:  The  Conference  of  the  European 
6:157:13301:21:21:70:468:548:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Churches – CEC and Consilium Conferentiarum Episcoporum Europae - CCEE18. 
6:158:13371:21:21:106:555:527:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The Conference of the European Churches – CEC. The Ecumenical Council of the Churches 
6:159:13456:21:20:70:555:506:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:from  Vancouver  (1983)  encouraged  the  formation  of  some  regional  or  continental  ecumenical 
6:160:13557:20:21:70:556:486:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:organizations.  This  is  how  the  Conference  of  the  European  Churches  (CEC)19 appeared  in  1959. 
6:161:13661:21:21:70:554:465:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Europe was in the middle of the Cold War and was divided into two divergent political and military 
6:162:13760:21:20:70:555:444:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:blocs.  In  1959  the  first  Conference of  the  European  Churches  took  place,  where  40  European 
6:163:13863:20:21:70:555:424:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:churches  participated.  The  initial  purpose20 of  CEC  was  to  promote  reconciliation,  dialogue  and 
6:164:13969:21:21:70:555:403:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:friendship among the European churches and to build bridges between the West and the East. They 
6:165:14065:21:20:70:555:382:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:insisted on the fact that, although there was a curtain which divided Europe, there was no curtain to 
6:166:14167:20:21:70:555:362:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:divide the European churches. To prove that this was how things were regarded, the 4th Assembly 
6:167:14263:21:21:70:555:341:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of CEC was organized on board of a ship in the Baltic Sea21, and this was due to a desire to surpass 
6:168:14364:21:20:70:555:320:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the problems associated with obtaining the visas. In the present, the declaration of purpose of CEC 
6:169:14464:20:21:70:555:300:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:seeks „to build bridges between minority and majority churches, between different generations and 
6:170:14562:21:21:70:555:279:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:confessions  and  to  encourage  the  Christians  belonging  to  different  confessions  to  live  in  an 
6:171:14668:21:21:70:555:258:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f13:ecumenical  spirit  and  reciprocal  respect22. That’s why when the third Assembly took place, CEC 
6:172:14767:21:20:70:556:237:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:had their own constitution (1964) and starting with April 1968 they had a permanent secretariat. In 
6:173:14867:20:21:70:555:217:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2005, CEC consisted of 126 Orthodox, Protestant, Anglican and Catholic Churches. It also had 43 
6:174:14963:21:21:70:555:196:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:associated organizations23. The headquarters are in Geneva. The supreme authority  belongs to the 
6:175:15061:21:20:70:555:175:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:General  Assembly  who  meet  every  6  years.  In  the  period  between  the  meetings,  CEC  is  run  by  a 
6:176:15171:20:21:70:555:155:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Committee  who  meet  every  year.  Since  1999,  besides  the  Conference  of  the  European  Churches, 
6:177:15276:21:21:70:555:134:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:there has also been „The European Ecumenical Committee for Church and Society”. Its main duty 
6:178:15370:21:20:70:555:113:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:is to involve the  churches in  the process of European integration, realizing the permanent contact 
6:179:15470:20:0:70:546:93:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:with the European Committees, but also with other international institutions like UNO or OSCE24. 
7:180:15696:0:21:106:555:755:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Consilium Conferentiarum Episcoporum Europae – CCEE25. Not being a member of CEC, 
7:181:15776:21:21:70:556:734:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the Roman-Catholic church founded a special committee for the ecumenical dialogue with the other 
7:182:15873:21:20:70:555:713:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:churches that were members of the CEC. This Committee was called the  Council of the European 
7:183:15967:20:21:70:556:693:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:Bishop’s  Conferences  (CCEE)  and  has  its  headquarters  in  Saint  Galen,  Switzerland26.  The 
7:184:16066:21:21:70:555:672:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:perspectives of the world and European ecumenical movement concern the realization of the unity 
7:185:16162:21:20:70:555:651:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:among churches, in the spirit of the prayer „that Jesus addressed to His Heavenly Father for his 
7:186:16259:20:21:70:556:631:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:disciples and for those who trusted in him to be one” (The Bible, John, 17, 22)27. This Prayer, says 
7:187:16360:21:21:70:555:610:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:Gennadios von Sassima, „needs to be understood not as a simple wish that the Lord had expressed, 
7:188:16457:21:20:70:555:589:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:but  as  a  mandate  given  to  those  who  follow  Him  and,  especially,  to  the  churches  ...  Seeking  the 
7:189:16570:20:21:70:555:569:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:unity and the renewal of the church makes us feel deeply the huge responsibility which is placed on 
7:190:16670:21:21:70:555:548:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:our shoulders, that of confessing the truth. Today’s Europe needs to be led on an alternative way in 
7:191:16771:21:21:70:555:527:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:order  to  reach  a life of communion in diversity”28. The  perspectives  are  those  of  hope,  unity  and 
7:192:16878:21:20:70:555:506:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:renewal. There is a visible tendency towards the realization of a unity in diversity, at the same time 
7:193:16981:20:21:70:555:486:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:seeing the obstacles that  exist in front of this vision29. A big step forward in Europe  was made by 
7:194:17083:21:21:70:559:465:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the cooperation between CEC and CCEE to organize the European Ecumenical Assemblies and to  
7:195:17175:21:20:70:325:444:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:elaborate the document entitled Charta Oecumenica. 
7:196:17225:20:21:106:555:424:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: From  a  Christian  perspective,  the  participation  to  the  ecumenical  movement  results  and 
7:197:17323:21:21:70:555:403:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:leads  to  the  shared  faith  in  the  Trinity  and  in  the  common  values.  Before  being  crucified,  Jesus 
7:198:17436:21:20:70:555:382:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:prayed for his disciples and for all Christians to” be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in 
7:199:17538:20:21:70:555:362:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me.” (John : 17, 21). 
7:200:17637:21:21:70:555:341:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:„Therefore, we  are  persistently  called  to  transform  our  egocentric  mentality  into  an  unconditioned 
7:201:17747:21:20:70:555:320:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:love  for  the  others  and  for  the  society  that  we  live  in.  As  Christ  is  one  with  the  Father,  we,  as 
7:202:17865:20:21:70:555:300:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Christians, are also called to unity. We have the  duty to show that Christianity is a unity in which 
7:203:17967:21:21:70:555:279:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:we are all one. Their common affiliation is based on the unity of action of God the Father, the Son 
7:204:18067:21:21:70:555:258:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and  the  Holy  Spirit.  As  a  consequence,  the  renewal  of  the  ecumenical  movement  invites  all  those 
7:205:18178:21:20:70:511:237:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:who have been enabled to cross the present borders, to act together and with the society”30. 
7:206:18270:20:21:70:555:217:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:It  is  known  that  ecumenism  is  regarded  with  suspicion  in  certain  milieus  that  are  in  the  churches 
7:207:18384:21:21:70:556:196:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that participate to the dialogue. The supporters of the antiecumenical way  of thinking fear that the 
7:208:18486:21:20:70:555:175:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:ecumenical  movement  can  degenerate  into  a  pietistic  sentimentalism,  irresponsible  in  relation  to 
7:209:18594:20:21:70:555:155:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:doctrine, or into a syncretistic metaconfessional utopia, or into a pan-humanistic ideology, which is 
7:210:18696:21:21:70:555:134:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:based on an egalitarian philanthropic concept, or into a transactionist ethos, according to which the 
7:211:18798:21:20:70:555:113:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:Truth of faith is relativized into a „human family” lacking a distinct profile. In such circumstances, 
7:212:18901:20:0:70:555:93:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:ecumenism becomes not a solution, but part of the problem: it leads neither to Christian Unity, nor 
8:213:19131:0:21:70:555:755:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:does it allow the followers of Jesus to discuss honestly about some issues which can not be turned 
8:214:19229:21:21:70:269:734:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:into an object of political „negotiations”. 
8:215:19272:21:20:70:555:713:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: Like the postwar multilateral diplomacy, the ecumenical movement has some standards, its 
8:216:19361:20:21:70:555:693:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:own  conceptual  vocabulary  and  an  institutional  network  supported  by  subscriptions,  but  it  has 
8:217:19467:21:21:70:415:672:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:remained quite far from the ecclesial „field” of the member churches31. 
8:218:19538:21:20:70:555:651:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: After 1990, the theological dialogue has remained – as always – tributary to the immediate 
8:219:19627:20:21:70:555:631:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:history. The fall of communism and the legalization of the churches united to Rome determined the 
8:220:19725:21:21:70:555:610:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:withdrawal, self-suspension or waning of the level of representation of the Orthodox churches from 
8:221:19824:21:20:70:556:589:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Serbia,  Bulgaria  and  the  Czech  Republic,  which – confronted  with  inner  problems  related  to  the 
8:222:19930:20:21:70:555:569:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:adjustment  to  the  new  democratic  society – have  slowed  down  the  current  agenda  of  the 
8:223:20027:21:21:70:184:548:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:programmed meetings. 
8:224:20047:21:21:70:555:527:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: Since  2002,  the  dialogue  remains  in  an  unpredictable  state  and  is  characterized  by  an 
8:225:20146:21:20:70:555:506:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:unstable  balance  between  the  preservations  of  the  recent  acquisitions  and  the  discouragement  of 
8:226:20254:20:21:70:556:486:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:innovation.  The  two  apostolic  churches  have  realized  a  Pan-European  attitudinal  potential  which 
8:227:20361:21:21:70:555:465:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:has  not  been  fructified:  their  common  center-left  position  is  reflected  in  dogmatic,  canonical  and 
8:228:20473:21:20:70:555:444:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cult  matters,  but also  in  the  bio-ethic,  social  and  political    approach,  thus  isolating  itself  from  the 
8:229:20591:20:21:70:540:424:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Protestant positions – which were spread or oriented towards world extra-European cooperation.  
8:230:20685:21:21:70:556:403:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: The  decades  of  dialogue  have  defused  the  obsession  of  the  Papal  Primacy (in  favour  of 
8:231:20784:21:20:70:555:382:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:conciliarism), have eliminated the ecclesiologic outlooks associated with Vatican I („there is no 
8:232:20882:20:21:70:555:362:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:salvation outside the Catholic church”), have asserted that the unity is not hindered by the problem 
8:233:20983:21:21:70:555:341:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of the sacerdotal celibacy (obligatory for the Catholics, optional for the Orthodox), have rejected – 
8:234:21084:21:20:70:556:320:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:with traditional arguments – the perspective of women ordination, have accepted the homology of 
8:235:21179:20:21:70:555:300:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  sacramental  theology – independent  of  the  variety  of  liturgical  forms – they  adopted  texts  of 
8:236:21286:21:21:70:555:279:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:compromise  on  the  most  sensitive  topics  like  uniatism  and  proselytism  and  have  established  the 
8:237:21394:21:21:70:340:258:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:practice of the ecumenical prayers in an irenic spirit32.   
8:238:21453:21:20:70:555:237:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: In  spite  of  the  many  significant  evolutions,  the  dialogue  between  the  Orthodox  and  the 
8:239:21553:20:21:70:555:217:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Catholics  stagnates,  without  explanation  from  the  Greek-Catholic  patrimonial  litigation  and  the 
8:240:21659:21:21:70:555:196:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:ecclesial crisis of identity of „the uniate” communities. At the start of the 3rd millennium – at  a 
8:241:21759:21:20:70:555:175:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:European level too - it is still far from playing an important role on the agenda of the political and 
8:242:21861:20:21:70:555:155:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:civil  society.  This  dialogue,  which  started  several  centuries  too  late,  distorted  by  the  postwar 
8:243:21971:21:21:70:555:134:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:history,  discouraged  by  the  post-totalitarian  confusion  and  though  always  nourished,  remains  a 
8:244:22077:21:20:70:555:113:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:semi-civilized territory, which the next generations will approach from the same need for progress 
8:245:22176:20:0:70:152:93:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:and „miracle”33. 
9:246:22322:0:21:70:555:755:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: The  ecumenical  movement  is  led  today,  at  different  levels,  by  churches  which  act  through 
9:247:22424:21:21:70:555:734:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:synodic  organisms  (like  the  Ecumenical  Council  of  the  Churches,   the  regional  ecumenical 
9:248:22524:21:20:70:555:713:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:organizations,  sub-regional  associations  and  the  National  Committees  of  the  churches),  world 
9:249:22627:20:21:70:555:693:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Christian    communities,    ecumenical    communities,    missionary    organizations,    faculties    and 
9:250:22735:21:21:70:555:672:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:theological  associations,  ecumenical    institutions  and  training  centres  for  the  secular,  as  well  as 
9:251:22848:21:20:70:555:651:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:organisms   or   specialized   ministries,   international   ecumenical   organisations   and   many   other 
9:252:22957:20:21:70:555:631:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:ecumenical organizations. It is obvious that the ecumenical movement goes beyond any institution 
9:253:23054:21:21:70:556:610:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and includes all those who aspire to unity and dream of hearing a common Christian voice uttering 
9:254:23152:21:20:70:235:589:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the present important questions34. 
9:255:23186:20:21:70:555:569:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: The  ecumenical  dialogue  is  practically  based  on  the  phenomenon  of  the  concentric  circles. 
9:256:23288:21:21:70:556:548:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:What  is  important  is  in  fact  how  much  the  parts  have  in  common  or  how  far  a  Christian 
9:257:23391:21:21:70:555:527:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:denomination has gone from the doctrinal, administrative and juridical point of view. The closest to 
9:258:23492:21:20:70:555:506:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:one another are the sister churches that keep the doctrine, sacrality and spirituality in the line of the 
9:259:23598:20:21:70:556:486:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:apostolic  tradition  unaltered,  going  to  the  Christian  groups  and  denominations  that  deny  any 
9:260:23703:21:21:70:292:465:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:traditional hierarchy or institutional aspect35.  
9:261:23752:21:20:106:555:444:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:At a more local level, the legitimate religious pluralism of a certain cultural space makes the 
9:262:23848:20:21:70:555:424:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Roman-Catholics and the Protestants who live and work together, who belong to the same cultural 
9:263:23944:21:21:70:555:403:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:environment, feel closer to one another than to the Catholic believers belonging to a different rite or 
9:264:24048:21:20:70:555:382:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to  the  Orthodox,  although  from  a  theological  perspective  the  situation  is  precisely  the  other  way 
9:265:24160:20:21:70:104:362:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:round. 
9:266:24166:21:21:106:109:341:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
9:267:24166:21:20:106:259:320:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The dimensions of ecumenism 
9:268:24193:20:21:106:555:300:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:There  are  three  fundamental  dimensions  in  the  exigencies  imposed  on  the  ecumenical 
9:269:24287:21:21:70:555:279:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:movement:  the  theological  ecumenism,  the  secular  ecumenism  and  the  spiritual  ecumenism, 
9:270:24385:21:21:70:555:258:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Beyond  these,  at  the  European  level,  we  can  also  notice  another  dimension  of  ecumenism:  the 
9:271:24491:21:20:70:555:237:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cultural   ecumenism   which   has   social   practices   and   behaviours   which   converge   towards 
9:272:24595:20:21:70:147:217:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:globalization36. 
9:273:24611:21:21:106:555:196:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  theological  ecumenism is  the  dialogue  among  theologians  belonging  to  different 
9:274:24702:21:20:70:556:175:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f13:Christian confessions, among different churches. „The way of ecumenism is the way of the church. 
9:275:24799:20:21:70:555:155:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:All  those  who  pray  to  God  in  the  Holy  Trinity  and  confess  Jesus  Christ  as  Lord  and  Saviour 
9:276:24907:21:21:70:555:134:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:participate to this movement of union. Thus, the universal church is the people that find unity in the 
9:277:25010:21:20:70:556:113:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Trinity. „De unitate  Patris  et  Filii  et  Spiritus  Sancti  plebs,  adunata”, said  Saint  Ciprian.  The 
9:278:25117:20:21:70:555:93:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:importance of an ecclesiology  of the communion is obvious. Back in 1947, Wisser Hooft stated: „If 
9:279:25216:21:0:70:555:72:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:there  were  an  ecclesiology  accepted  by  all  (Christians),  the  ecumenical problem  would  be  solved 
10:280:25454:0:21:70:555:755:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and the ecumenical movement would be superfluous, because in matters of faith we are confronted 
10:281:25550:21:21:70:555:734:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:with the fundamental truths like ministry, hierarchy and primacy”. After 50 years, there has been 
10:282:25648:21:20:70:391:713:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:some progress; there are common points, but not yet a consensus.  
10:283:25713:20:21:106:556:693:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The secular ecumenism means the cooperation among Christians in various activities for the 
10:284:25803:21:21:70:555:672:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:benefit of the people. The pluralist societies are less and less interested in the dogmatic divergences. 
10:285:25908:21:20:70:555:651:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  credibility  of  Christians  is measured  by  way  of  the  quality  of  the  common  engagement  in  the 
10:286:26018:20:21:70:555:631:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:service of man and humanity. „The painful image of humanity today imposes on all Christians the 
10:287:26114:21:21:70:555:610:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mandatory  task  of  making  obvious  the  fact  that  the  technical  and  scientific  achievements  are  not 
10:288:26224:21:20:70:555:589:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:enough  to  create  a  world  society  without  the  spiritual,  religious  and  moral  basis,  without  Jesus 
10:289:26335:20:21:70:556:569:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:Christ, the one who gives the world love, peace and justice.” (Patriarch  Athenagoras,  1987) The 
10:290:26433:21:21:70:556:548:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reconciliation between man and God, between man and his fellows, between churches are the main 
10:291:26528:21:21:70:247:527:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:purposes of the secular ecumenism.  
10:292:26562:21:20:106:555:506:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  spiritual  ecumenism is  another  dimension  of  the  ecumenical  movement.There  is  no 
10:293:26655:20:21:70:555:486:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:genuine  ecumenism  without  an  inner  transformation,  a  renewal  of  the  soul,  a  self-denial,  without 
10:294:26765:21:21:70:555:465:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:humbleness,  kindness  and  a  desire  to  serve  others.  The  soul  of  this  renewal  is  prayer.  The 
10:295:26871:21:20:70:555:444:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:„ecumenical” prayer, the community of prayer of the brothers and sisters in Christ expresses the 
10:296:26968:20:21:70:556:424:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:evangelic truth of the statement „Your father is one, in heaven” (Matthew 23, 9).  Although divided, 
10:297:27069:21:21:70:555:403:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:they are united in Christ with a strong hope, entrusting the future of their union and communion to 
10:298:27169:21:20:70:555:382:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Him6.  The  preoccupation  for  unity  cannot  be  absent  from  the  intimate  dialogue  between  any 
10:299:27272:20:21:70:555:362:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Christian and God. Each prayer is the full and unconditional sacrifice offered to the Father, through 
10:300:27374:21:21:70:202:341:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the Son in the Holy Spirit.  
10:301:27402:21:20:106:555:320:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The interreligious dialogue is not only  an exchange of ideas, but also an  exchange of  gifts, 
10:302:27498:20:21:70:555:300:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:as it is founded on prayer. It means a mature way of thinking, a desire for reconciliation and unity in 
10:303:27601:21:21:70:554:279:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:truth. It is not only a renewal of the way in which you express  your faith, but also of the way  you 
10:304:27703:21:21:70:555:258:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:live  it.  It  is  a  dialogue  of  salvation.  When  Christians  pray  together,  the  purpose  of  the  unity  is 
10:305:27819:21:20:70:555:237:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:closer.  Christ  is  present  in  this  communion  of  prayer;  He  prays  in  us,  with  us  and  for  us.  The 
10:306:27932:20:21:70:554:217:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:ecumenical prayer is in the service of the Christian mission and of its credibility. An example is the 
10:307:28035:21:21:70:555:196:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:week  of  prayer  for  the  unity  of  Christians37. „The dialogue is the last fibre of creation” – father 
10:308:28141:21:20:70:418:175:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:Stăniloaie once said and this dialogue is put into practice by all  sides38. 
10:309:28217:20:21:106:556:155:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The octave of prayer for the unity of all Christians, celebrated between 18-25 January every 
10:310:28310:21:21:70:555:134:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:year, is an invitation launched by all those aware of the uselessness of the division in the Christian 
10:311:28413:21:20:70:555:113:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:community. They ask for the help of God in what is not possible for people to become possible for 
10:312:28511:20:0:70:186:93:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Him (cf. Mark:10, 27).  
11:313:28665:0:21:106:555:755:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  dialogue  is  the  ideal  means  in  putting  face  to  face  the  different  points  of  view,  in 
11:314:28770:21:21:70:555:734:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:examining  the  divergences  that  separate  Christians.  In  the  ecumenical  dialogue,  the  seriousness  of 
11:315:28881:21:20:70:555:713:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the engagement and the depth of the problems that require a solution are obvious. The force to end 
11:316:28980:20:21:70:556:693:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:this long an difficult pilgrimage is in „this submission to the will of  the  Father,  repentance  and 
11:317:29083:21:21:70:418:672:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:absolute trust in the power of the truth, which is Christ, to reconciliate”. 
11:318:29159:21:20:106:555:651:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Depending  on  the  domains  within  which  the  ecumenical  mandate  is  applied,  in  the 
11:319:29251:20:21:70:555:631:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Protestant   world,   taking   into   account   the   diversity   of   the   Protestant and   Neo-Protestant 
11:320:29360:21:21:70:555:610:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:denominations,   an   intraconfessional   and   an   interconfessional   ecumenism   are   brought   into 
11:321:29466:21:20:70:126:589:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:discussion. 
11:322:29477:20:21:106:555:569:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  intraconfessional  ecumenism  represents  the  existence  of  a  pluralism  in  the  same 
11:323:29572:21:21:70:556:548:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:denomination. Karl Barth said: „We are not unanimous where we should be as a church, meaning in 
11:324:29668:21:21:70:424:527:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:the substance itself of the Christian faith ... We are not united in Christ”.  
11:325:29746:21:20:106:555:506:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The interconfessional ecumenism is ecumenism in the traditional sense and is manifested at 
11:326:29837:20:21:70:236:486:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the national or international level. 
11:327:29873:21:21:106:555:465:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:So far, the interchristian dialogue has brought forward three hypothetical models  of church 
11:328:29966:21:21:70:101:444:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:unity: 
11:329:29972:21:21:79:555:423:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: The  organic  unity (according  to  which  the  ultimate  loyalty  of  each  Christian  concerns  the 
11:330:30074:21:21:97:555:402:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:whole  body  of  the  Church  and  not  only  some  of  it).  This  model  requires  the  consensual 
11:331:30175:21:20:97:555:381:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:suppression of the separate confessional realities and the reformation of the local churches as 
11:332:30271:20:22:97:269:361:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:members of the Universal Church.  
11:333:30304:22:20:79:555:339:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: The conciliar fellowship – which claims that all local churches should a confess periodically a 
11:334:30400:20:21:97:555:319:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:common credo, in a conciliar environment: from this perspective, the diversity of the Christian 
11:335:30495:21:21:97:555:298:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:world is unnatural, as a consequence of the fact that „the people of God” appear through the 
11:336:30588:21:22:97:437:277:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:natural insertion of the Gospel into all the cultural texts on the Globe.  
11:337:30662:22:20:79:555:255:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: The  communion  of  communions – a  concept  that  was  suggested  in  the  1970s  by  the  cardinal 
11:338:30763:20:21:97:555:235:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:Willebrands, who assumes  that the present „confessions” are a bunch of „ecclesial types” 
11:339:30853:21:21:97:556:214:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reunited in fact by the dogmatic, sacramental  communion and by a unique sacerdocy. In other 
11:340:30945:21:20:97:555:193:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:words, „confessions are the forms and expressions of ecumenism”- the Bishop of Rome being 
11:341:31034:20:21:97:396:173:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:only „the servant” and guarantee – of this unity in diversity39. 
11:342:31097:21:21:70:73:152:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
11:343:31097:21:20:106:407:131:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The European Ecumenical Assembly – Charta Oecumenica  
11:344:31149:20:21:106:556:111:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The   European   interconfessional   dialogue was   strongly   intensified   through   the   tight 
11:345:31248:21:21:70:555:90:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cooperation  between  CEC  and  CCEE.  The  fruit  of  this  cooperation  consists  in  two  important 
11:346:31351:21:0:70:555:69:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:projects:  the  first  project  is  the  European  Ecumenical  Assembly  and  the  second  is  Charta 
12:347:31584:0:21:70:555:755:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Oecumenica. It is an important document both as a constructive philosophy but also as a test of the 
12:348:31684:21:21:70:555:734:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:distance between the Christian vision on „the future of Europe” and the vision of the European 
12:349:31779:21:20:70:555:713:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:political  class:  in  fact,  the  level  of  address  differs  fundamentally,  because  the  churches  want 
12:350:31887:20:21:70:555:693:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:communitary and personalist democracies, while politicians envisage a pragmatic Europe, based on 
12:351:31984:21:21:70:347:672:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:guaranteed civil rights and on secular moral standards40 . 
12:352:32041:21:20:106:555:651:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  European  Ecumenical  Assembly  is  an  ecumenical  project  with  a  calendar  of  three 
12:353:32136:20:21:70:555:631:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:conferences: Basel (1989), Graz (1997) and Sibiu (2007). The European Ecumenical Assembly has 
12:354:32230:21:21:70:451:610:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:been the greatest ecumenical event since the beginning of the 3rd millennium.  
12:355:32308:21:20:70:555:589:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  European  Ecumenical  Assembly  reunites  the  traditional  churches  of  Europe.  Part  of  the 
12:356:32410:20:21:70:519:569:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Conference of the European Churches are the Orthodox, Protestant and Anglican churches41. 
12:357:32498:21:21:106:555:548:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  First  European  Ecumenical  Assembly  (EEA1) was  organized  in  Basel, Switzerland, 
12:358:32587:21:21:70:555:527:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:between 15-21 May 1989, with the theme „Peace and justice”42. More than 700 delegates from all 
12:359:32682:21:20:70:555:506:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Europe  participated  to  this  event.  The  conference  proposed  three  steps  to  be  followed  in  order  to 
12:360:32795:20:21:70:260:486:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:continue the initiative of the assembly: 
12:361:32835:21:21:106:555:465:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:- establishing a period every year, from a week to ten days, in which to pray and discuss in 
12:362:32927:21:20:70:349:444:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:order to promote justice, peace and integrity of  creation.  
12:363:32987:20:21:106:556:424:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:- organizing an ecumenical group that is supposed to promote the process of reconciliation, 
12:364:33078:21:21:70:200:403:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:after the meeting of Basel. 
12:365:33105:21:20:106:479:382:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:- organizing a second European Ecumenical Assembly after about five years. 
12:366:33178:20:21:106:555:362:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The Second European Ecumenical Assembly (EEA2) took place in Graz, in Austria between 
12:367:33263:21:21:70:555:341:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:23-29 June 1997. 700 delegates from 124 churches, that were members of CBE and from Episcopal 
12:368:33357:21:20:70:555:320:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Conferences  of  the  CCEE,  participated.  Among  the  participants,  there  were  also  about  150 
12:369:33458:20:21:70:555:300:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:representatives  from  the  ecumenical  and  ecclesial  movements,  guests  from  other  continents  and 
12:370:33563:21:21:70:555:279:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:from  other  religious  communities  and  up  to  10000  guests  from  all  Europe43 . The  theme  of  the 
12:371:33669:21:21:70:555:258:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:conference  was  “Reconciliation.  A  gift  from  God  and  Source  of  New  Life”.  Viorel  Ioniţă, 
12:372:33770:21:20:70:555:237:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:representative of the Romanian Orthodox Church at CEC says: “EEA2 elaborated a final document, 
12:373:33865:20:21:70:555:217:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:a fundamental text”, which consisted in the fundamental declarations related to the theme of the 
12:374:33962:21:21:70:556:196:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f13:Assembly  and  developed  ethical  directions  for  reflection, a set of “Operative Recommendations”. 
12:375:34063:21:20:70:555:175:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:The second operative recommendation invited all the churches of Europe to “elaborate a common 
12:376:34157:20:21:70:555:155:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:document   containing    a   series   of   obligations   and   fundamental   ecumenical   rights.   This 
12:377:34262:21:21:70:556:134:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:recommendation  represented  the  basis  for  the  so-called Charta  Oecumenica44 which can  be 
12:378:34356:21:20:70:556:113:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:considered the most important initiative of EEA2”45. Charta Oecumenica, signed in April 22nd 2001 
12:379:34453:20:21:70:555:93:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:at  Strasbourg  contains  the  premise  for  the  development  of  the  cooperation  among  the  churches  of 
12:380:34563:21:0:70:555:72:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Europe. Charta Oecumenica is   the   most   important   document   of   the   European   ecumenical 
13:381:34794:0:21:70:555:755:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:movement and the clearest evidence of the interconfessional dialogue open among the Churches of 
13:382:34890:21:21:70:122:734:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Europe46.  
13:383:34900:21:20:106:555:713:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The Third European Ecumenical Assembly took place in Sibiu between 4-9 September 2007. 
13:384:34985:20:21:70:555:693:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  discussions  initiated  on  the  occasion  of  this meeting  are  founded  on  Charta  Oecumenica.  The 
13:385:35094:21:21:70:555:672:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Catholic  church  was  represented  at  Sibiu  by  the  Committee  of  the  European  Catholic  Episcopal 
13:386:35200:21:20:70:556:651:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Conferences, which comprises all the Catholic Episcopal Conferences of all the European countries. 
13:387:35299:20:22:70:479:631:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Unlike the first two Assemblies, the third assembly was planned to have four stages: 
13:388:35383:22:21:88:555:609:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f13: Rome:  24-27 January 2006, under the motto “The light of Christ shines upon all. Let’s 
13:389:35471:21:20:106:555:588:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f13:discover in Christ, the crucified one, the new light on the way of the European  Christians’ 
13:390:35564:20:22:106:530:568:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:getting closer to one another”. 150 delegates from Europe participated to the assembly.  
13:391:35652:22:20:88:555:546:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: The  local  ecumenical  events  organised  at  the  end  of  the  year  2006,  especially  prayers 
13:392:35752:20:21:106:556:526:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:together under the motto: “The light of Christ shines upon all. Renewal and unity at the local 
13:393:35847:21:22:106:141:505:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:level”. 
13:394:35854:22:20:88:555:483:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Wittenberg:  15-18  February  2007  organised  with  the  purpose  of  presenting  the  Protestant 
13:395:35954:20:22:106:198:463:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:heritage to Europe 
13:396:35972:22:21:88:501:441:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman: Sibiu: 4-9 September 2007. 2500 delegates from all Europe participated to Sibiu.  
13:397:36054:21:20:106:555:420:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:At Sibiu, the suggested theme was “The light of Christ shines upon all. Hope for renewal 
13:398:36143:20:21:70:555:400:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:and unity in Europe”. Concerning what was expected from EEA3, the Pope Benedict XVI declared: 
13:399:36237:21:21:70:555:379:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:“We  have  set  off  together  on  a  common  road,  we  have  prayed  and  worked  together  in  order  to 
13:400:36345:21:21:70:555:358:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:create an atmosphere dominated by trust and reciprocal understanding. We have all tried to live a 
13:401:36443:21:20:70:556:337:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:spirituality  that  is  rooted  in  the  word  of  God.  We  hope  to  re-arouse  the  enthusiasm  for  the 
13:402:36551:20:21:70:555:317:12:g_d0_f7:12:Times New Roman:ecumenical way through prayers and action.” 47. Walter Kasper expressed his hope that ecumenical 
13:403:36647:21:21:70:425:296:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Christianity would become the nucleus of a renewed European culture48.  
13:404:36718:21:20:106:555:275:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:Vincenzo Paglia considers that „the different European traditions – Catholic, Orthodox and 
13:405:36808:20:21:70:555:255:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Protestant – need  to  find  new  ways  of  working  together  in  order  to  trace  a  way  on  which  the 
13:406:36915:21:21:70:555:234:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f13:Europeans  to  live  the  great  humanistic  values  and  offer  them  to  the  entire  planet”. The European 
13:407:37025:21:21:70:555:213:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Ecumenical  Assembly,  organised  for  the  first  time  in  an  Orthodox  country,  developed  under  the 
13:408:37132:21:20:70:301:192:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sign of solidarity among religious confessions.  
13:409:37180:20:21:106:555:172:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:„I remember with great satisfaction the atmosphere created at Sibiu in September 2007, 
13:410:37267:21:21:70:555:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:where under the same roof or in the same square, the Christians belonging to different confessions 
13:411:37366:21:20:70:555:130:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f13:declared Christ the Light of the World, Unique Lord and Redeemer”, stated Lucian, Bishop of Alba 
13:412:37463:20:21:70:556:110:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:Iulia and Făgăraş-Blaj, Major Archbishop of the Romanian Church united with the Greek-Catholic 
13:413:37558:21:21:70:116:89:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Rome49 .

14:415:37696:0:21:70:556:755:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: Premises  of  ecumenism and  interrconfessional dialogue  in Bihor.  Urban – rural

14:417:37795:21:20:106:555:713:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Discussing  about  ecumenism  and  interreligious  or  inter-confessional  dialogue  in Bihor is, 
14:418:37893:20:21:70:556:693:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:according to current demographic realities, a need entailed by the ethno-confessional diversity and 
14:419:37993:21:21:70:552:672:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:multiculturalism  specific  to  the  area.  The  great  religious diversity  has  led  not  only  to  inter-
14:420:38101:21:20:70:555:651:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:community tensions but also to a better knowledge,  a phenomenon that has finally led to dialogue 
14:421:38199:20:21:70:555:631:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and relationships. From a religious point of view, the fall of the communist regime meant the end of 
14:422:38300:21:21:70:555:610:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:a  time  of  abuse  or  interdictions  for  many  people  and  communities.  Religious  freedom  after  1989 
14:423:38409:21:20:70:555:589:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:would  decisively  contribute  to  changes  in  the  religious  structure.  The  Greek-Catholic  church  has 
14:424:38518:20:21:70:556:569:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:been re-established, new confessions have appeared, certain  religious practices have been revived; 
14:425:38618:21:21:70:555:548:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Romanians  in  general  have  became  more  religious  after  that  date.  They  all  brought  important 
14:426:38723:21:21:70:219:527:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:changes on the religious level. 
14:427:38754:21:18:106:443:506:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In 1992, there was the following confessional structure of the county:

15:455:39554:20:21:106:555:446:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:If we analyse both charts, it is easy to notice the fact that there was a time for expansion of 
15:456:39650:21:21:70:555:425:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  Neo-Protestant  confessions  (mainly  Pentecostal  and  Baptist)  and  a  decrease  of  the  Orthodox, 
15:457:39758:21:20:70:289:404:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Roman-Catholic, and Protestant confessions. 
15:458:39801:20:21:106:555:384:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In order to seize the degree of opening of the Oradea inhabitants to interreligious dialogue, 
15:459:39895:21:21:70:555:363:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:we  start  with  our  own  research  by  carrying  out  a  comparative  investigation  in  the  urban  and  rural 
15:460:40009:21:20:70:555:342:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:environments. We  therefore  resorted  to  an  inquiry  based  on  an  interview  applied  to  some  people 
15:461:40116:20:21:70:555:322:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(lay parishioners or ecclesiastics) with different religious convictions. From a methodological point 
15:462:40218:21:21:70:556:301:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of view, we chose Oradea and the village of Ferice (commune of Bunteşti) in order to see the more 
15:463:40316:21:21:70:247:280:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:acute conservatism in the rural area. 
15:464:40353:21:20:106:555:259:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In our investigation, we started from the premise that in a city like Oradea, with a complex

15:466:40544:21:21:70:555:218:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:a  greater  flexibility  in  perceiving  religious  behaviour.  On  the  other  hand,  in  the  village  of  Ferice, 
15:467:40661:21:20:70:555:197:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:located in the hilly area of the Beiuş Depression,  the  population  is  less  receptive  to  contemporary 
15:468:40767:20:21:70:555:177:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f13:changes.  The  reduced community here is “compelled” to dialogue irrespective of their confession 
15:469:40864:21:21:70:555:156:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:yet respecting the conservatory traditional norms characteristic of each confessional group. Another 
15:470:40965:21:20:70:555:135:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:aspect worth mentioning is the fact that in Oradea there is a much higher religious diversity than in 
15:471:41067:20:21:70:480:115:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Ferice, where there are only two confessions (Orthodox – 2/3 and Pentecostal – 1/3). 
15:472:41149:21:21:106:555:94:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:68  interview  guides  were  spread  in  Oradea  and  26  in  Ferice.  They  were  relatively  equally 
15:473:41252:21:0:70:340:73:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:distributed according to sex and age of the respondents.

16:502:41797:20:21:70:555:474:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:balanced distribution, in Oradea the higher education is predominant (which is due to the reality of

16:504:42000:21:20:70:555:432:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:this  point  of  view,  we  expect  a  different  expression  in  the  two  places  concerning  religious  issues,

16:506:42149:21:21:106:555:391:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The nationality of the interviewed people is also important due to the analysis: in Ferice, all

18:585:44079:0:21:70:555:755:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:confession. Such a premise is highly important in the equation of building a real dialogue between 
18:586:44178:21:21:70:555:734:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:confessions. Orthodox and Pentecostals in both Ferice and Oradea proved to be the most exclusivist

18:588:44376:20:21:70:555:693:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:and the Calvinists, as well as the Baptists (100% of them accepted that the “Truth” did not belong to

18:590:44500:21:20:106:556:651:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:As far as the question Are you willing to give up your confession/religion to adopt a newly

18:592:44688:21:21:70:369:610:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:willing to give up their own confession to an ecumenical one. 
18:593:44749:21:20:106:556:589:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:An interesting question showing the mechanism of accepting the other is: Do you think that

18:622:45377:21:21:106:556:238:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:From the perspective of worldwide ecumenism, an interesting question is the following: Do

19:667:46838:21:0:70:242:86:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:seems to confirm the investigation. 
20:668:47004:0:21:106:556:755:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Concerning the question Which is the Christian confession/religion you feel close to  (other 
20:669:47097:21:21:70:555:734:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:than  the  one  you  belong  to)?,  the  answers  differ  depending  on  the  confession  of  the  individuals 
20:670:47208:21:20:70:555:713:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:chosen.  Generally,  Orthodox,  Catholics  and  Greek-Catholics  feel  close  to  one  another.  The  same 
20:671:47315:20:21:70:555:693:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:can  be  noticed  in  the  case  of  Neo-Protestants  (Pentecostals, Baptists,  Adventists)  or  Protestants

20:673:47447:21:20:106:555:651:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The extent to which the  inhabitants of Bihor  are  willing to accept ecumenism is not totally

20:676:47747:21:20:70:555:589:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:movement, at least in the area of Bihor, is more a subject of debates amongst theologians and less

20:701:48324:20:21:70:555:242:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:issue of ecumenical movement. Despite the fact that religion is considered as important, the people 
20:702:48424:21:21:70:555:221:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:in  Bihor  prove  their  concern  with  religious  issues  and  also  that  they  are  “avoided”  by  the

21:722:49558:20:21:70:556:412:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rejected  the  idea  of  women being  ordained  in  church,  while  26.5%  of  the  respondents  in  Oradea

22:749:50407:21:20:70:555:713:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:movement in the curriculum. In the spirit of ecumenism, the people in Bihor blame to a great extent

22:752:50586:21:20:106:397:651:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:From this survey, we can draw certain relevant conclusions: 
22:753:50645:20:21:82:555:631:12:g_d0_f20:12:Times New Roman: God  is  unique,  all  have  the  opportunity  for  redemption;  yet  parishioners  from  different 
22:754:50746:21:21:100:340:610:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:confessions won’t accept the others dogmatically 
22:755:50794:21:20:82:555:589:12:g_d0_f20:12:Times New Roman: In  general,  Orthodox,  Catholics  and  Greek-Catholics  feel  close  to one  another.  The  same 
22:756:50893:20:21:100:556:569:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:holds   true   in   the   case   of   Neo-Protestants   (Pentecostals,   Baptists and   Adventists)   or 
22:757:50997:21:21:100:272:548:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Protestants (Lutherans, Calvinists). 
22:758:51033:21:21:82:555:527:12:g_d0_f20:12:Times New Roman: The extent to which people in Bihor are willing to accept ecumenism is not totally related to 
22:759:51128:21:20:100:555:506:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:accepting  dialogue   amongst  confessions.  Most  respondents  are  not  aware  of  the  real 
22:760:51223:20:21:100:555:486:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:significance  of  the  term  ecumenism.  Considering  this  reality,  we  may  think  that  the 
22:761:51319:21:21:100:555:465:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:ecumenical  movement,  at  least  in  the  Bihor  area,  is  mostly  an  issue  of  debate  amongst

22:765:51719:21:20:100:341:382:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the confessional conservatism of the respondents. 
22:766:51768:20:21:82:555:362:12:g_d0_f20:12:Times New Roman: People  in  Bihor  are  in  the  first  place  against  the  presence  of  the  Church  in  politics  but  they 
22:767:51881:21:21:100:432:341:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:agree to a great extent to State funding the activity of religious cults. 
22:768:51954:21:20:82:555:320:12:g_d0_f20:12:Times New Roman: Respondents  in  the  rural  area  are  clearly  against  women  being  ordained  in  church,  while 
22:769:52056:20:21:100:400:300:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:inhabitants of the urban area are more open to such an option. 
22:770:52118:21:21:82:555:279:12:g_d0_f20:12:Times New Roman: People in Bihor know next to nothing on ecumenism, but they and their children are willing 
22:771:52210:21:21:100:184:258:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to find out more.

22:773:52227:21:20:106:174:216:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Conclusions  
22:774:52238:20:21:106:555:196:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:There  are three  fundamental  dimensions  in  the  exigencies  imposed  on  the  ecumenical 
22:775:52330:21:20:70:555:175:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:movement:  the  theological  ecumenism,  the  secular  ecumenism  and  the  spiritual  ecumenism, 
22:776:52428:20:21:70:555:155:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Beyond  these,  at  the  European  level,  we  can  also  notice  another  dimension  of  ecumenism:  the 
22:777:52534:21:21:70:555:134:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cultural   ecumenism   which   has   social   practices   and   behaviours   which   converge   towards 
22:778:52638:21:20:70:139:113:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:globalization. 
22:779:52652:20:21:106:555:93:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  ecumenical  movement  is  led  today,  at  different  levels,  by  churches  which  act  through 
22:780:52754:21:0:70:555:72:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:synodic  organisms  (like  the  Ecumenical  Council  of  the  Churches,   the  regional  ecumenical 
23:781:52985:0:21:70:555:755:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:organizations,  sub-regional  associations  and  the  National  Committees  of  the  churches),  world 
23:782:53088:21:21:70:555:734:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Christian    communities,    ecumenical    communities,    missionary    organizations,    faculties    and 
23:783:53196:21:20:70:555:713:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:theological  associations,  ecumenical institutions  and  training  centres  for  the  secular,  as  well  as 
23:784:53305:20:21:70:555:693:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:organisms   or   specialized   ministries,   international   ecumenical   organisations   and   many   other 
23:785:53414:21:21:70:555:672:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:ecumenical organizations. It is obvious that the ecumenical movement goes beyond any institution 
23:786:53511:21:20:70:555:651:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and includes all those who aspire to unity and dream of hearing a common Christian voice uttering 
23:787:53609:20:21:70:227:631:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the present important questions. 
23:788:53641:21:21:106:555:610:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:At a more local level, the legitimate religious pluralism of a certain cultural space makes the 
23:789:53737:21:20:70:556:589:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Roman-Catholics and the Protestants who live and work together, who belong to the same cultural 
23:790:53833:20:21:70:555:569:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:environment, feel closer to one another than to the Catholic believers belonging to a different rite or 
23:791:53937:21:21:70:555:548:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to  the  Orthodox,  although  from  a  theological  perspective  the  situation  is  precisely  the  other  way 
23:792:54049:21:21:70:104:527:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:round. 
23:793:54055:21:20:106:555:506:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The new evolution promises an improvement of the dialogue between the churches and the 
23:794:54141:20:21:70:555:486:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:European institutions, but the secular modesty regarding the Christian subject will remain for a long 
23:795:54243:21:21:70:555:465:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:time, in the same way as the temptation of the Church to demonize postmodernism will preserve for 
23:796:54341:21:20:70:226:444:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:a while its manipulative vigour. 
23:797:54373:20:21:106:555:424:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f13:The  ecumenical  movement  has  been  the  horizon  to  which  many  Christians’  hopes  and 
23:798:54466:21:21:70:555:403:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:illusions  headed.  Some  talked  about  manipulations,  others  considered  it  devilish.  The  noble, 
23:799:54570:21:20:70:556:382:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:generous  aspects  of  the  ecumenical  movement  and  the  Christian,  spiritual  dimensions    have  been 
23:800:54678:20:21:70:555:362:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:too often forgotten. Moreover, at the third European Ecumenical Assembly, some could notice the 
23:801:54774:21:21:70:555:341:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:presence  of    representatives  belonging  to  other  religions  (Islam,  Judaism),  so  that  we  could  talk 
23:802:54886:21:21:70:359:320:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times New Roman:about a door open to what is called „extended ecumenism”.
