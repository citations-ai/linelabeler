2:27:1284:35:24:72:540:561:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:In this paper, we develop a simple model of international outsourcing and apply it to processing
2:28:1380:24:24:72:539:537:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:trade in China. We observe China's processing exports broken down by who owns the plant and by
2:29:1474:24:24:72:540:513:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:who controls the inputs the plant processes. Multinational firms engaged in export processing in
2:30:1570:24:24:72:539:489:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:China tend to split factory ownership and input control with managers in China: the most common
2:31:1665:24:24:72:539:465:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:outcome is to have foreign factory ownership but Chinese control over input purchases. To account
2:32:1762:24:24:72:540:441:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:for this organizational arrangement, we appeal to a property-rights model of the firm. Multinational
2:33:1862:24:24:72:539:417:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:firms and the Chinese factory managers with whom they contract divide the surplus associated with
2:34:1959:24:24:72:539:393:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:export processing by Nash bargaining. Investments in input search, production, and marketing are
2:35:2055:24:24:72:540:369:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:partially relationship specific. In our benchmarks estimates, this relationship specificity is lowest
2:36:2156:24:24:72:539:345:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:in southern coastal provinces, where export markets are thickest, and highest in interior and northern
2:37:2258:24:24:72:539:321:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:provinces. The probability contracts are enforced has a similar pattern and is the lowest along the
2:38:2357:24:32:72:278:297:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:southern coast and the highest in the north.

3:52:2628:0:13:71:154:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:1.  Introduction 
3:53:2645:13:14:71:74:695:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
3:54:2645:14:28:71:518:681:144:Times:144:Times:B: Global production is a common feature of the modern firm.  Businesses as diverse as 
3:55:2729:28:27:71:535:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:Mattel, which makes plastic dolls, Dell, which sells personal computers, and Intel, which makes 
3:56:2825:27:28:71:521:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:semiconductors, operate supply chains that span multiple countries.  Typically, multinational 
3:57:2919:28:27:71:510:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:firms produce components in one location, process components into final goods in another 
3:58:3008:27:28:71:523:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:location, and manage these operations from headquarters in yet another location.  While trade 
3:59:3102:28:28:71:512:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:theory has used general-equilibrium models to examine location decisions by multinational 
3:60:3192:28:27:71:523:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:firms,1 the literature has tended to abstract away from how multinationals set firm boundaries 
3:61:3287:27:28:71:517:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:within global supply chains.  Until recently, trade theory has not sought to explain why Intel 
3:62:3382:28:27:71:537:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:would use wholly-owned subsidiaries in China and Costa Rica to assemble its microchips, while 
3:63:3476:27:28:71:524:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:Dell and Mattel subcontract production to outside firms in many countries.  Nor has it tried to 
3:64:3572:28:28:71:540:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:account for why Dell would control who buys what from whom along its PC supply chain, while 
3:65:3664:28:27:71:487:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:Mattel grants the suppliers that make its dolls latitude in finding sources for materials. 
3:66:3755:27:28:71:530:350:144:Times:144:Times:B: In a new body of work, trade theorists have started to bring modern theories of the firm 
3:67:3844:28:27:71:540:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:into models of international trade.2  Grossman and Helpman (2002a,b) and Antras (2001) use the 
3:68:3939:27:28:71:538:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:property-rights theory of Grossman and Hart (1986) and Hart and Moore (1990) to model global 
3:69:4032:28:28:71:530:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:outsourcing and intra-firm trade.  Grossman and Helpman (2002c) apply the incentive-systems 
3:70:4124:28:27:71:515:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:framework of Holmstrom and Milgrom (1994) to model managerial compensation in global 
3:71:4209:27:28:71:537:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:production, and Marin and Verdier (2001, 2003) and Puga and Trefler (2002) extend the Aghion 
3:72:4302:28:27:71:418:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Tirole (1997) theory of delegating authority to general equilibrium. 
3:73:4375:27:28:71:534:157:144:Times:144:Times:B: In this paper, we build a simple model of international outsourcing and apply this model 
3:74:4464:28:31:71:535:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:to China.  We consider a multinational firm that has decided to setup an export processing plant 
3:75:4561:31:8:71:218:98:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                 
3:76:4609:8:11:71:355:90:42:Times:99:Times:F:1 See Markusen (2002) and Markusen and Maskus (2003) for surveys. 
3:77:4675:11:0:71:525:79:42:Times:99:Times:F:2 For early work on firm boundaries in international trade, see Ethier and Markusen (1996) and McLaren (2000). 
4:78:4788:0:28:71:529:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:in a low-wage country.  In this arrangement, the firm sends intermediate inputs to a processing 
4:79:4884:28:28:71:519:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:factory, which converts the inputs into finished goods and then exports the final output.  The 
4:80:4979:28:27:71:511:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:decisions facing the multinational include who should own the processing factory and who 
4:81:5068:27:28:71:537:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:should control input-purchase decisions the factory makes.  Following recent trade literature, we 
4:82:5166:28:27:71:522:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:use the Grossman-Hart-Moore property-rights (PR) theory as the basis for our model.  In this 
4:83:5259:27:28:71:515:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:framework, parties use control rights over productive assets to ameliorate hold-up problems 
4:84:5351:28:28:71:526:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:created by incomplete contracts.  We also build simple contracting costs into the model, in the 
4:85:5447:28:27:71:403:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:spirit of the Holmstrom-Milgrom incentive-systems (IS) framework. 
4:86:5513:27:28:71:527:488:144:Times:144:Times:B: The application to China is motivated by the importance of export processing to global 
4:87:5600:28:27:71:509:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:trade and by the availability of detailed trade data on China.  As described in section 2, we 
4:88:5694:27:28:71:540:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:observe China’s processing exports broken down by who owns the plant and by who controls the 
4:89:5787:28:28:71:515:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:inputs the plant processes.  Since the early 1980s, China has permitted foreign ownership of 
4:90:5880:28:27:71:516:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:export processing plants.  It stipulates that all processing plants (whether Chinese or foreign 
4:91:5976:27:28:71:524:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:owned) operate according to one of two regimes:  a pure-assembly regime, in which a foreign 
4:92:6068:28:27:71:513:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:buyer supplies a plant in China with inputs and hires the plant to process them into finished 
4:93:6162:27:28:71:536:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:goods, all the while retaining ownership over the inputs; and an import-and-assembly regime, in 
4:94:6258:28:28:71:536:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:which a plant in China imports inputs of its own accord, processes them, and sells the processed 
4:95:6355:28:27:71:542:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:goods to a foreign buyer.  This level of contractual detail is rarely observed in international trade. 
4:96:6458:27:28:107:512:212:144:Times:144:Times:A:In our model of export processing, presented in section 3, parties have the option of 
4:97:6544:28:27:71:532:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:writing a legal contract to govern trade, where with some probability the contract will be not be 
4:98:6642:27:28:71:529:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:verifiable and parties will be forced to divide gains from trade by Nash bargaining.  The threat-
4:99:6739:28:28:71:537:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:point payoffs associated with bargaining do not fully compensate parties for their investments in 
4:100:6837:28:0:71:509:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:human capital and depend, in standard fashion, on who has the relevant control rights (i.e., 
5:101:6932:0:28:71:534:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:ownership of the factory or control over input decisions).  Whether factory ownership and input 
5:102:7028:28:28:71:529:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:control should be given to the same or to different parties depends on parameters of the model, 
5:103:7124:28:27:71:497:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:including the specificity of human-capital investments in the project, value-added in the 
5:104:7214:27:28:71:524:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:processing factory, and the Nash bargaining weights.  When human-capital specificity is low, 
5:105:7307:28:27:71:531:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:value added is high, or the bargaining weight of the multinational is high, the multinational can 
5:106:7405:27:28:71:533:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:ameliorate the hold-up problem by transferring control of input purchases to the manager.  This 
5:107:7501:28:28:71:518:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:will improve the manager’s incentive to make investments specific to the multinational even 
5:108:7593:28:27:71:534:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:when she does not own the factory, so that ownership and control are given to different parties.  
5:109:7691:27:28:71:515:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:However, when human-capital specificity is high, value added is low, or the multinational’s 
5:110:7783:28:27:71:497:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:bargaining weight is low, then ownership and control should be given to the same party. 
5:111:7871:27:28:107:506:433:144:Times:144:Times:A:On the basis of the model, we develop a stochastic specification for organizational 
5:112:7955:28:28:71:537:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:decisions in export processing, which is presented in section 4.  Previewing the empirical results 
5:113:8054:28:27:71:535:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:in section 5, we find that multinational firms engaged in export processing in China tend to split 
5:114:8153:27:28:71:541:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:factory ownership and input control with factory managers in China:  the most common outcome 
5:115:8246:28:27:71:540:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:is to have foreign factory ownership but Chinese control over input purchases.  This is consistent 
5:116:8345:27:28:71:500:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:with moderate or low human-capital specificity, which our estimates of these parameters 
5:117:8433:28:28:71:537:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:confirm.  In our benchmarks estimates, the specificity of human-capital investments is estimated 
5:118:8530:28:27:71:540:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:at 28 – 51% in interior and northern provinces but only about 22% in southern coastal provinces, 
5:119:8627:27:28:71:514:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:where export production is concentrated.  Thus, the specificity of investments appears to be 
5:120:8720:28:27:71:534:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:lowest where export markets are thickest.  The probability of legal enforcement of contracts has 
5:121:8817:27:28:71:539:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:a similar pattern and is the lowest in the southern coastal provinces, and the highest in the north.  
5:122:8919:28:28:71:512:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:Our preferred estimate of the Nash bargaining weight for multinational firms is 0.7, but the 
5:123:9012:28:0:71:522:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:confidence interval includes the value of 0.5, which corresponds to simple Nash bargaining.   
6:124:9108:0:28:71:541:709:144:Times:144:Times:B: Our findings are relevant to several bodies of literature.  While incomplete contracts are a 
6:125:9201:28:28:71:532:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:staple feature of recent trade models, there is little empirical work on whether contracting costs 
6:126:9300:28:27:71:516:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:matter for international trade.3  We estimate sources of contractual incompleteness in global 
6:127:9394:27:28:71:534:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:production.  A second body of literature to which our work relates is empirical work on modern 
6:128:9489:28:27:71:533:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:theories of the firm.  Despite intense theoretical interest in the PR and other models, few papers 
6:129:9588:27:28:71:489:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:have tested them.4  A notable exception is Baker and Hubbard (2000a,b) who examine 
6:130:9671:28:28:71:536:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:contractual arrangements in U.S. trucking.  They exploit the introduction of on-board computers 
6:131:9767:28:27:71:525:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:in trucks, which changed the costs of monitoring truck drivers.  They find evidence consistent 
6:132:9862:27:28:71:512:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:with the PR and IS models.  Our work, which exploits the interaction between choices over 
6:133:9952:28:27:71:505:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:ownership and input-purchase regimes, is similar in spirit to theirs.  Our work extends the 
6:134:10044:27:28:71:517:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:literature by estimating contracting costs in a developing-country context, where contractual 
6:135:10138:28:28:71:461:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:incompleteness is often assumed to be severe but is rarely estimated empirically.

6:138:10250:27:28:71:527:336:144:Times:144:Times:B: Export processing plays a major role in China’s foreign trade.  Table 1 shows that over 
6:139:10338:28:27:71:538:308:144:Times:144:Times:B:the years 1997-2002, which spans our sample period, processing exports accounted for 55.6% of 
6:140:10432:27:28:71:537:281:144:Times:144:Times:B:China’s total exports.  Export processing in China is broadly similar to that in other countries.  It 
6:141:10534:28:27:71:540:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:involves a firm in China importing intermediate inputs, processing the inputs, and then exporting 
6:142:10632:27:28:71:513:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:the finished goods.  The inputs are imported duty-free (as are any investment goods used in 
6:143:10724:28:28:71:510:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:export processing) as long as these goods are only used to produce exports.  China has two 
6:144:10815:28:61:71:272:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:regulatory regimes for export processing. 
6:145:10857:61:8:71:218:109:144:Times:144:Times:B:

7:149:11188:0:28:71:526:709:144:Times:144:Times:B: The Pure-Assembly Regime.5  In this arrangement, a foreign firm supplies a factory in 
7:150:11274:28:28:71:503:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:China with materials from abroad (Naughton, 1996).  The factory in China, whose role is 
7:151:11362:28:27:71:530:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:relatively passive, receives orders from and delivers processed goods to the foreign client, who 
7:152:11459:27:28:71:537:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:then sells the goods outside China.  While the factory takes possession of the imported materials 
7:153:11557:28:27:71:513:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:during processing, the foreign firm retains ownership over them.  The foreign firm pays the 
7:154:11649:27:28:71:532:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:factory in China a fee for its processing services.  To obtain clearance from Chinese customs to 
7:155:11746:28:28:71:541:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:import materials and to export processed goods, the terms of the transaction between the Chinese 
7:156:11843:28:27:71:533:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:factory and the foreign firm must be stipulated in a written contract and presented in advance to 
7:157:11941:27:28:71:510:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:Chinese customs officials for approval.6  Legally, the processing factory may use imported 
7:158:12032:28:27:71:442:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:materials for the sole purpose of meeting its obligations to the foreign client. 
7:159:12113:27:28:71:536:433:144:Times:144:Times:B: The Import-and-Assembly Regime.  In this arrangement, the processing factory in China 
7:160:12199:28:28:71:520:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:plays a more active role.  Table 1 shows that this regime is the more common form of export 
7:161:12291:28:27:71:536:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:processing, accounting for 70.7% of processing exports over the 1997-2002 period.  The factory 
7:162:12386:27:28:71:537:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:imports materials of its own accord and takes ownership of these materials during processing.  It 
7:163:12484:28:27:71:520:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:may broker deals to process goods for multiple foreign firms (World Bank, 1994).  Thus, the 
7:164:12576:27:28:71:523:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:factory in China controls both the import of inputs and the export of processed goods (though 
7:165:12670:28:28:71:523:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:usually not the marketing and sale of the good to end users).  Legally, Chinese customs treats 
7:166:12765:28:27:71:508:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:processing plants under this regime as bonded warehouses – facilities that are permitted to 
7:167:12857:27:28:71:526:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:import inputs duty free under the proviso that they export all output.  Bonded goods cannot be 
7:168:12952:28:41:71:514:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:transferred to another party without the approval of Chinese customs.  To become a bonded

7:170:13090:7:16:71:528:136:42:Times:99:Times:F:5 In Chinese trade statistics, the pure-assembly arrangement is called “processing and assembling” or “processing 
7:171:13204:16:7:71:536:120:99:Times:99:Times:F:with supplied materials,” and the import-and-assembly arrangement is called “processing with imported materials.” 
7:172:13318:7:16:71:507:113:42:Times:99:Times:F:6 The contract must specify the materials (and any equipment) to be imported, the processing activities to be 
7:173:13428:16:11:71:523:97:99:Times:99:Times:F:performed, the fees to be paid, and the ports of entry and exit, among other items.  See “Regulations Concerning 
7:174:13541:11:12:71:523:86:99:Times:99:Times:F:Customs Supervision and Control over the Inward Processing and Assembling Operation (Amended),” Customs 
7:175:13645:12:0:71:351:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:General Administration, October 5, 1990, http://www.moftec.gov.cn. 
8:176:13714:0:28:71:517:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:warehouse, a plant must apply to the Chinese government and have warehouse facilities and 
8:177:13804:28:28:71:511:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:accounting personnel that meet government standards.7  Under either regime, exporters are 
8:178:13894:28:27:71:534:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:required to submit monthly reports on the status of their contracts and to verify that the contract 
8:179:13994:27:28:71:432:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:has been completed within a month of having exported the finished goods. 
8:180:14067:28:27:71:541:598:144:Times:144:Times:B: There are several important distinctions between the two processing regimes.  One relates 
8:181:14157:27:28:71:509:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:to the responsibilities of the factory manager in China.  Under pure-assembly, the manager 
8:182:14248:28:28:71:505:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:appears to play a small role in searching for inputs or in other activities that precede input 
8:183:14343:28:27:71:512:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:processing.  Under import-and assembly, the factory manager has greater responsibility.  A 
8:184:14434:27:28:71:498:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:second distinction has to do with to controls rights over imported materials.  Under pure-
8:185:14524:28:27:71:511:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:assembly, the foreign buyer of the processed goods owns the materials used in processing.  
8:186:14615:27:28:71:528:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:Without this buyer’s consent, the factory in China cannot legally use the imported materials to 
8:187:14711:28:28:71:540:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:process goods for another client.  Under import-and-assembly, in contrast, the processing factory 
8:188:14809:28:27:71:531:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:owns the imported materials.  It may use them to produce for the foreign buyer of its choice, so 
8:189:14906:27:28:71:513:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:long as the goods are exported.  A third distinction between the two regimes is that they are 
8:190:15000:28:27:71:511:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:subject to different approval processes and regulations.  In particular, import-and-assembly 
8:191:15093:27:28:71:529:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:factories are required to make greater investments in inventory storage and management.  This 
8:192:15187:28:28:71:536:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggests that a processing plant cannot costlessly or quickly change from one regime to another. 
8:193:15284:28:27:71:508:239:144:Times:144:Times:B: Processing factories may be owned by either Chinese or foreign interests.  Foreign-
8:194:15367:27:28:71:542:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:invested enterprises (FIEs) play a major role in China’s trade.  Table 1 shows that over the period 
8:195:15467:28:27:71:530:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:1997-2002 FIEs accounted for 62.8% of China’s processing exports.  The Chinese government 
8:196:15557:27:28:71:539:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:recognizes two categories of FIEs, wholly foreign-owned enterprises and equity joint ventures in 
8:197:15654:28:31:71:500:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:which a foreign interest has at least a 25% ownership stake.  One issue is whether a 25% 
8:198:15743:31:8:71:218:98:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                 
8:199:15791:8:16:71:527:90:42:Times:99:Times:F:7 See “Measures on the Administration of the Customs of the People’s Republic of China for Bonded Warehouse 
8:200:15899:16:0:71:539:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:Factory Engaged in Processing Trade,” Customs General Administration, April 6, 1988, http://www.moftec.gov.cn.  
9:201:16013:0:28:71:512:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:ownership share gives a foreign party effective control over a processing factory.  Standard 
9:202:16106:28:28:71:542:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:definitions of whether an enterprise is foreign controlled set a lower ownership threshold, such as 
9:203:16206:28:27:71:541:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:10% in the case of the U.S. government.  Following this precedent, we treat as foreign controlled 
9:204:16304:27:28:71:341:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:both wholly owned factories and equity joint ventures.8 
9:205:16359:28:27:71:540:598:144:Times:144:Times:B: Export processing began to take off in China in the late 1980s.  The pioneers in the sector 
9:206:16451:27:28:71:502:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:included Hong Kong trading companies that set up processing plants across the border in 
9:207:16539:28:28:71:516:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:Guangdong Province and used Hong Kong as a base from which to manage their operations 
9:208:16625:28:27:71:521:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Sung, 1991).  Hong Kong continues to mediate a large fraction of China’s processing trade.  
9:209:16718:27:28:71:500:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:Table 1 shows that over the sample period, 45.9% of China’s processing exports were re-
9:210:16805:28:27:71:525:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:exported through Hong Kong.  Hong Kong traders provide a range of intermediation services, 
9:211:16896:27:28:71:525:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:including finding foreign buyers, sorting and grading goods according to quality, labeling and 
9:212:16991:28:28:71:532:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:packaging, and coordinating processing in China with processing in other countries (Naughton, 
9:213:17085:28:27:71:528:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:1997; Feenstra and Hanson, 2002).  We shall examine whether processing exports re-exported 
9:214:17176:27:28:71:519:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:through Hong Kong differ systematically from those shipped directly to destination markets.

9:216:17268:14:27:71:145:308:144:Times:144:Times:B:3.  The Model 
9:217:17282:27:28:71:518:281:144:Times:144:Times:B: We begin by describing the problem faced by a foreign firm wanting to locate export 
9:218:17366:28:27:71:496:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:processing operations in China.  The parties choose who should own the factory used in 
9:219:17453:27:28:71:535:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:production and who should control the purchase of inputs processed by this factory.  Our model 
9:220:17548:28:28:71:543:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:follows closely the PR approach of Grossman and Hart (1986) and Hart and Moore (1990).  
9:221:17635:28:27:107:509:170:144:Times:144:Times:A:Consider a foreign firm, denoted by f, transacting with a factory manager in China, 
9:222:17719:27:23:71:541:143:144:Times:144:Times:B:denoted by g.  The project requires the parties to purchase one unit of an input, to use a factory to 
9:223:17821:23:7:71:218:120:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                 
9:224:17869:7:16:71:537:113:42:Times:99:Times:F:8 The government also recognizes cooperative joint ventures as a mode of inward foreign investment (Sung, 1998).  
9:225:17983:16:11:71:521:97:99:Times:99:Times:F:These are often non-equity arrangements between a foreign firm and a domestic partner that account for a small 
9:226:18094:11:12:71:512:86:99:Times:99:Times:F:fraction of exports.  Since these arrangements may not involve foreign investment, we exclude them from our 
9:227:18202:12:0:71:484:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:definition of foreign-owned plants.  Counting them as foreign-owned plants does not affect the results. 
10:228:18308:0:28:71:518:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:process the input into one unit of a final product, and to market and to sell the final product.  
10:229:18406:28:28:71:539:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:Timing is as follows:  In period 0 the parties choose who should own the factory and who should 
10:230:18502:28:27:71:528:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:control input purchases; in period 1 the parties simultaneously make effort investments; and in 
10:231:18598:27:28:71:533:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:period 2 the parties undertake input purchases, input processing, and final sales.  All actions are 
10:232:18698:28:30:71:431:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:observable to the two parties but not necessarily verifiable to a third party. 
10:233:18777:30:35:107:531:568:144:Times:144:Times:A:The efforts undertaken in period 1 are as follows:  e1 = effort devoted to searching for a 
10:234:18868:35:34:71:532:533:144:Times:144:Times:B:low-priced input, by either party f or g;  e2 = effort devoted to preparing the factory to produce, 
10:235:18968:34:32:71:533:499:144:Times:144:Times:B:by the factor manager g;  e3 = effort devoted to marketing the final good, by the foreign firm f.  
10:236:19067:32:27:71:538:467:144:Times:144:Times:B:The subscripts on these effort levels denote the stages of production rather than the timing, since 
10:237:19167:27:31:71:543:440:144:Times:144:Times:B:all efforts are undertaken in period 1, before production and sale.  The price of the input in period 
10:238:19269:31:36:71:529:409:144:Times:145:Times:B:2 is given by the linear function P·(1-e1), P>0, 1e01≤≤, so that more search effort lowers the 
10:239:19364:36:33:71:526:373:145:Times:145:Times:B:input price.  The cost of input processing in period 2 is given by A·(1-e2), A>0, 1e02≤≤, so 
10:240:19457:33:29:71:540:340:145:Times:145:Times:B:that preparation effort lowers processing costs in period 2.  Revenues from final sales in period 2 
10:241:19557:29:31:71:485:311:145:Times:145:Times:B:are given by B·(1+λe2+e3), where 10≤λ<,               1e03≤≤ and B>(A+P)>0, so that more

10:246:19866:14:30:107:534:199:145:Times:145:Times:A:Notice that we have introduced an element of joint production between input processing 
10:247:19953:30:32:71:522:169:145:Times:145:Times:B:and sales revenue, with effort e2 by the factory manager affecting both.  It is perhaps obvious 
10:248:20049:32:28:71:515:137:145:Times:145:Times:B:that effort by the manager can reduce factory costs.  An example, taken from Grossman and 
10:249:20139:28:30:71:525:109:145:Times:145:Times:B:Helpman (2002c), where such effort also affects final sales is when the project is “successful” 
10:250:20235:30:0:71:537:79:145:Times:145:Times:B:(leading to positive sales) with some probability that is increasing in e2.  Joint production means 
11:251:20337:0:28:71:532:709:145:Times:145:Times:B:that it may be difficult to compensate the manager at the first-best level, reflecting the marginal 
11:252:20437:28:30:71:392:681:145:Times:145:Times:B:contributions of her effort to both processing costs and final sales. 
11:253:20507:30:35:107:528:651:145:Times:145:Times:A:The period 1 effort investments, ei, i=1,2,3, impose a cost on the parties involved.  The 
11:254:20597:35:34:71:506:616:145:Times:145:Times:B:variable δ1 ∈ {0,1} indicates whether the foreign firm f (δ1 = 0) or the manager g (δ1 = 1) 
11:255:20688:34:37:71:522:582:145:Times:145:Times:B:expends search effort e1.  We refer to this indicator variable as control over input purchases.

11:267:21258:34:34:72:506:351:144:Times:144:Times:B: In addition to input control, δ1, we introduce the ownership variable δ2 ∈ {0,1} to 
11:268:21340:34:32:71:534:317:144:Times:144:Times:B:indicate whether the foreign firm f (δ2 = 0) or whether the Chinese manager g (δ2 = 1) owns the 
11:269:21436:32:28:72:539:285:144:Times:144:Times:B:processing factory.  While this indicator variable does not appear in the profits (1) or surplus (2), 
11:270:21538:28:30:72:546:257:144:Times:144:Times:B:ownership of the factory certainly affects the effort levels of f and g, as will be made clear below.  
11:271:21641:30:35:72:539:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:With the effort levels depending on δ1 and δ2, the surplus in (2) also depends on these, which we 
11:272:21739:35:31:72:534:192:144:Times:144:Times:B:write as W(δ1, δ2).  The goal of our analysis is to see how W varies with δ1 and δ2.  If W(0,0) + 
11:273:21837:31:31:72:514:161:144:Times:144:Times:B:W(1,1) > W(0,1) + W(1,0) then W is strictly supermodular, so the highest values for W are 
11:274:21927:31:32:71:530:130:144:Times:144:Times:B:obtained when δ1 and δ2 take on the same values and it is optimal for the same party to control 
11:275:22023:32:0:71:530:98:144:Times:144:Times:B:the inputs and to own the factory.  Conversely, when W(0,0) + W(1,1) < W(0,1) + W(1,0) then 
12:276:22193:0:32:71:534:706:144:Times:144:Times:B:W is strictly submodular, so it is optimal for δ1 and δ2 to take on different  values, meaning that 
12:277:22293:32:27:71:493:674:144:Times:144:Times:B:one party controls input purchases and the other owns the factory.  As we shall see, our 
12:278:22382:27:28:71:498:647:144:Times:144:Times:B:application of the PR model can lead to either outcome, depending on parameter values. 
12:279:22469:28:14:71:74:619:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
12:280:22469:14:27:71:217:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:3.1  Incomplete Contracting 
12:281:22497:27:28:71:502:578:144:Times:144:Times:B: Essential to modern theories of the firm is that idea that contracts are imperfect or 
12:282:22583:28:28:71:530:550:144:Times:144:Times:B:incomplete, so that the first-best effort levels cannot necessarily be obtained.  In Grossman and 
12:283:22681:28:27:71:519:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:Hart (1986), contracts are unenforceable, so there is Nash bargaining over ex post profits.  In 
12:284:22777:27:28:71:533:495:144:Times:144:Times:B:Holmstrom and Milgrom (1994), effort is observed with a random error, so wage compensation 
12:285:22868:28:28:71:540:467:144:Times:144:Times:B:imperfectly rewards effort.  We will combine elements of both approaches by assuming that with 
12:286:22963:28:30:71:540:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:probability (1– φ) the parties’ efforts can be verified, so that a first-best contract can be enforced, 
12:287:23067:30:29:71:522:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:and with probability φ there is no verifiability and no contract, in which case the parties Nash 
12:288:23164:29:29:71:530:380:144:Times:144:Times:B:bargain over profits.  Thus, the parameter φ serves as a measure of contractual incompleteness. 
12:289:23260:29:28:107:520:351:144:Times:144:Times:A:We will allow for generalized Nash bargaining where the foreign firm has bargaining 
12:290:23344:28:30:71:537:323:144:Times:144:Times:B:weight θ and the Chinese manager has weight (1 – θ).  The status quo or threat point payoffs for 
12:291:23441:30:34:72:517:293:144:Times:144:Times:B:the two parties will be denoted by fˆπ and gˆπ (as specified below).  Total ex post profits are 
12:292:23537:34:32:72:403:259:144:Times:144:Times:B:given by (1), and the profits πf and πg earned by each party are then:

12:298:23866:29:29:71:478:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:contracts occur with probability (1 – φ), the expected payoffs to each party are then:

13:317:24678:31:28:108:514:454:144:Times:144:Times:A:In order to solve these problems, we need to be more specific about the threat point  
13:318:24764:28:28:72:523:426:144:Times:144:Times:B:payoffs received by each party.  Our general assumption is that when Nash bargaining breaks 
13:319:24856:28:28:72:535:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:down, the party not owning the factory can still make an arrangement with another factory.  But 
13:320:24952:28:29:72:532:370:144:Times:144:Times:B:in that case, the marginal product of his or her effort investment is reduced by ψ, so the payoffs 
13:321:25051:29:29:72:503:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:are (1 – ψ) times their first-best level.  Thus, ψ measures the specificity of human-capital 
13:322:25144:29:29:72:523:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:investments by either party in the project.  For example, when the Chinese manager owns the 
13:323:25236:29:31:71:524:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:factory (δ2 = 1) and Nash bargaining breaks down, then the foreign firm will seek out another 
13:324:25330:31:27:71:456:252:144:Times:144:Times:B:factory to work with.  In that case, the threat-point payoff to the foreign firm is: 
13:325:25414:27:16:107:110:225:144:Times:144:Times:A:

13:328:25515:14:28:71:509:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:Meanwhile, the manager can still use the factory to process the input for another firm.  We 
13:329:25607:28:30:71:507:142:144:Times:144:Times:B:suppose that the transfer price received depends imperfectly on the marketing effort of the 
13:330:25699:30:30:71:533:112:144:Times:144:Times:B:manager, Tˆ= T + λ(1 – ψ)Be2, but otherwise the manager has property rights over the residual  
13:331:25794:30:0:71:321:82:144:Times:144:Times:B:profits of the firm.   Her threat-point payoff is then:

14:335:25993:15:28:72:476:651:144:Times:144:Times:B: Next, suppose that the foreign firm owns the factory (δ2 = 0).   In the case of 
14:336:26073:28:28:72:506:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:disagreement over the ex post division of profits, the foreign firm retains ownership of the 
14:337:26166:28:28:71:537:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:factory and hires another manager.  There is no reason to expect that a new manager would have 
14:338:26261:28:30:71:540:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:made prior effort investments, so in that event the profits of the foreign firm should be computed 
14:339:26360:30:32:71:375:537:144:Times:144:Times:B:with e2=0.  Thus, the threat-point payoff of the foreign firm is:

14:344:26609:29:28:71:520:422:144:Times:144:Times:B:her effort investments is again reduced by ψ.  We make the further assumption that when the 
14:345:26701:28:28:71:514:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:manager does not own the factory her effort investments are valued more highly by another 
14:346:26791:28:28:71:511:366:144:Times:144:Times:B:factory if she controls input purchases.  In other words, a manager who is separated from a 
14:347:26883:28:27:72:528:338:144:Times:144:Times:B:foreign firm is more productive in another firm if she brings with her the knowledge of how to 
14:348:26978:27:28:71:521:311:144:Times:144:Times:B:purchase inputs; otherwise, she becomes part of the general labor pool, where her prior effort

14:350:27171:27:28:71:422:256:144:Times:144:Times:B:threat point payoff to the manager when she does not own the factory is:

14:358:27817:14:12:71:519:120:99:Times:99:Times:F:manager’s investments in the threat point for case (δ1,δ2) = (0,0) to zero, but this is not essential.  We assume a 
14:359:27932:12:11:71:526:108:99:Times:99:Times:F:similar asymmetry does not apply to the foreign firm (but all that is essential here is that any asymmetry between 
14:360:28047:11:11:71:515:97:99:Times:99:Times:F:ownership regimes in how gaining control over input purchases affects outside options is larger for the factory 
14:361:28159:11:12:71:536:86:99:Times:99:Times:F:manager than for the foreign firm).  Since the foreign firm may transact with many managers, the impact of gaining 
14:362:28274:12:0:71:528:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:control over input purchases on the firm’s outside options is less likely to depend on whether it owns the factory.  
15:363:28469:0:28:71:539:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:Substituting (7)-(10) into the objective functions (5) and (6), we can determine the optimal effort 
15:364:28569:28:28:71:291:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:investments, as discussed in the next section. 
15:365:28616:28:14:71:74:653:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
15:366:28616:14:27:71:263:639:144:Times:144:Times:B:3.3  Solutions for Effort Investments  
15:367:28655:27:30:107:529:612:144:Times:144:Times:A:Let us first consider the case where the foreign firm owns the factory, and also controls 
15:368:28745:30:32:71:527:582:144:Times:144:Times:B:the input, so that (δ1,δ2) = (0,0) in the upper-left cell of Table 2.  In the disagreement point the 
15:369:28845:32:28:71:528:550:144:Times:144:Times:B:foreign firm receives the full marginal value from it’s own effort investments, as shown in (9), 
15:370:28942:28:30:71:517:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:since it owns the factory.  It follows that the foreign firm’s effort levels are at their first-best 
15:371:29042:30:34:72:533:492:144:Times:144:Times:B:levels of e1 = P/γf and e3 = B/γf.  The manager, on the other hand, faces the threat-point payoffs 
15:372:29141:34:34:71:519:458:144:Times:144:Times:B:in (10).  When δ1 = 0, the manager’s effort investments have no value in her outside option.  
15:373:29235:34:33:71:512:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:Since the threat-point payoff has weight θ in (7), then g2/)BA)(1(eγλ+φθ−=, which is 
15:374:29320:33:32:71:272:391:144:Times:144:Times:B:below its first-best level by the factor φθ. 
15:375:29365:32:31:71:535:359:144:Times:144:Times:B: The case (δ1,δ2) = (0,0) is particularly simple because the foreign firm retains ownership 
15:376:29455:31:29:71:539:328:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the factory, and since it also makes the input decision, the manager has no property rights.  To 
15:377:29555:29:31:71:509:299:144:Times:144:Times:B:discuss other cases in Table 2, recall our assumption that a party loses 0 < ψ < 1 times her 
15:378:29647:31:32:71:521:268:144:Times:144:Times:B:marginal product if she works with another factory.  In particular, consider the case (δ1,δ2) = 
15:379:29742:32:27:72:538:236:144:Times:144:Times:B:(1,0) in the lower-left cell of Table 2, so the foreign firm retains ownership of the factory but the 
15:380:29844:27:29:72:522:209:144:Times:144:Times:B:factory manager now controls the input decision.  In that case, if the manager goes to another 
15:381:29939:29:30:72:521:180:144:Times:144:Times:B:factory then she loses ψ times the marginal product of her effort investments.  So the optimal 
15:382:30034:30:36:72:525:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:investment towards processing the inputs is now g2/)BA)(1(eγλ+φψθ−=, which exceeds 
15:383:30117:36:29:195:519:114:85:Times:144:Times:A:g2/)BA)(1(eγλ+φθ−=, as applies when the foreign firm has both factory ownership and 
15:384:30201:29:0:71:516:85:144:Times:144:Times:B:input control.  Thus, giving the manager control over input-search improves her incentive to 
16:385:30372:0:31:71:539:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:make investments in processing the input.  This is because the threat-point earnings from outside 
16:386:30470:31:33:71:506:678:144:Times:144:Times:B:employment in (13) are conditional on having control over the input, δ1=1.  However, her 
16:387:30559:33:34:72:484:645:144:Times:144:Times:B:optimal effort in input-search isg1/P)1(eγφψθ−=, which is less than the first-best. 
16:388:30643:34:24:71:535:611:144:Times:144:Times:B: In order to compute the levels of surplus W(δ1, δ2), we make use of the following result:

16:414:30982:14:28:72:486:402:144:Times:144:Times:B:This result follows by straightforward computation, and shows that the welfare loss is 
16:415:31069:28:27:72:533:374:144:Times:144:Times:B:proportional to the square of the deviation of each effort level from its first-best value.  Making 
16:416:31169:27:31:71:529:347:144:Times:144:Times:B:use of (11) and the efforts shown in the first column of Table 2, it is readily shown that W(0,0) 
16:417:31267:31:34:71:540:316:144:Times:144:Times:B:cannot be ranked in general with W(1,0):  effort e1 is higher when the foreign firm controls input 
16:418:31366:34:32:71:520:282:144:Times:144:Times:B:purchases, but effort e2 in processing the input is higher when the manager has input control. 
16:419:31461:32:28:71:532:250:144:Times:144:Times:B: Now consider the situation where the manager owns the processing factory (δ2=1).  The 
16:420:31547:28:27:72:536:222:144:Times:144:Times:B:solutions for the effort investment are shown in the second column of Table 2.  When δ1 = 0, the 
16:421:31644:27:28:72:514:195:144:Times:144:Times:B:foreign firm controls input purchases.  As summarized in the upper-right cell of Table 2, all 
16:422:31738:28:28:72:536:167:144:Times:144:Times:B:effort investments are below their first-best level.  For the foreign firm, the marginal value of its 
16:423:31840:28:32:72:531:139:144:Times:144:Times:B:investments are reduced by ψ in its threat-point payoff, and since this occurs with probability φ 
16:424:31937:32:0:72:480:107:144:Times:144:Times:B:and has weight (1–θ) in (3), its optimal efforts levels are e1=f/P])1(1[γψθ−φ− and 
17:425:32098:0:35:71:538:706:144:Times:144:Times:B:e3=f/B])1(1[γψθ−φ−.  The manager chooses e2, which has marginal value A+(1– ψ)λB in her 
17:426:32186:35:31:72:539:671:144:Times:144:Times:B:threat-point payoff (8), compared with (A+λB) in profits π.  Since the threat-point has weight φθ 
17:427:32283:31:35:72:475:640:144:Times:144:Times:B:in (4), it follows that  e2=g/]B)1(A[γλφθψ−+, which is below the first-best level. 
17:428:32366:35:28:72:539:605:144:Times:144:Times:B: Suppose now that the manager controls input purchases, δ1 = 1.  In that case, she receives 
17:429:32457:28:30:72:538:577:144:Times:144:Times:B:full marginal value of P from search effort in both her threat-point payoff (8) and in total profits, 
17:430:32559:30:32:72:518:547:144:g_d0_f7:144:Times:B:π.  It follows that her optimal search investment is at her own first-best level, e1 = P/γg.  The 
17:431:32657:32:27:72:541:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:other efforts levels are unchanged from when the foreign firm controls the input decision.  So the 
17:432:32756:27:31:72:539:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:only difference between having one or the other party control the input decision is in their search 
17:433:32856:31:32:72:505:457:144:Times:144:Times:B:efforts.  With differing disutility of efforts, we cannot rank W(0,1) and W(1,1).  If γf = γg, 
17:434:32951:32:30:72:530:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:however, then it is clearly better to have the manager search for the input, since she undertakes 
17:435:33049:30:32:72:386:395:144:Times:144:Times:B:this activity at her first-best level.  So W(1,1) > W(0,1) if γf = γg. 
17:436:33120:32:27:107:517:363:144:Times:144:Times:A:Using the effort levels in Table 2, the value of surplus in each case is computed as in 
17:437:33208:27:28:72:528:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:(11).  Then a convenient summary statistic is the modularity of the surplus function, computed 
17:438:33303:28:27:72:543:308:144:Times:144:Times:B:by taking the sum of its values using the diagonal elements of Table 2, minus the sum of its value 
17:439:33402:27:28:72:289:281:144:Times:144:Times:B:using the off-diagonal elements.  We obtain:

18:531:34301:15:28:107:540:498:144:Times:144:Times:A:Notice that the parameter φ, indicating the degree of contractual incompleteness, does not 
18:532:34392:28:29:72:498:470:144:Times:144:Times:B:appear in condition (13), so the modularity of the surplus function is independent of this 
18:533:34483:29:30:72:540:441:144:Times:144:Times:B:parameter.  This is because φ does not affect the relative bargaining power of the two parties.  To 
18:534:34583:30:35:72:524:411:144:Times:144:Times:B:interpret condition (13), recall that (A+λB) is the marginal product of the manager’s effort e2, 
18:535:34680:35:31:71:529:376:144:Times:144:Times:B:while g*2/)BA(eγλ+= is the first-best effort level, so that g2/)BA(γλ+ would be the labor 
18:536:34770:31:32:71:509:345:144:Times:144:Times:B:income received by the manager or value-added in the first-best.  Similarly, if the manager 
18:537:34862:32:36:71:531:313:144:Times:144:Times:B:controls the input decision, then P is the marginal product of her effort e1 and g*1/Peγ= is the 
18:538:34959:36:0:71:196:277:144:Times:144:Times:B:first-best effort level, so P
18:539:34988:0:7:197:202:284:81:Times:81:Times:F:2
18:540:34989:7:32:201:542:277:144:Times:144:Times:A:/γg would be the labor income or value-added in the search activity.  It 
18:541:35062:32:30:71:536:245:144:Times:144:Times:B:follows that [(A+λB)/P]2  is interpreted as the ratio of value-added in the factory relative to that 
18:542:35163:30:29:71:386:215:144:Times:144:Times:B:in input search, or simply the value-added ratio, in the first-best. 
18:543:35232:29:28:107:513:186:144:Times:144:Times:A:Then (13) shows that if the value-added ratio is low, the parameter ψ measuring the 
18:544:35316:28:28:71:535:158:144:Times:144:Times:B:specificity of human-capital investments is high, or the foreign firm’s Nash bargaining weight θ 
18:545:35412:28:28:71:513:130:144:Times:144:Times:B:is low, then supermodularity of the surplus function is obtained.  To explain this result, low 
18:546:35507:28:27:71:527:102:144:Times:144:Times:B:value-added means that incentive problems are more acute in input search than in processing.  
18:547:35601:27:0:71:539:75:144:Times:144:Times:B:Then from Table 2, the first-best levels of input search are obtained along the diagonal, when the 
19:548:35778:0:30:71:530:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:same party has ownership of the factory and control over input sourcing.  Relatedly, when ψ is 
19:549:35873:30:30:71:529:678:144:Times:144:Times:B:high (say, ψ = 1) then the outside options are irrelevant and the disincentive for the manager to 
19:550:35971:30:30:71:520:648:144:Times:144:Times:B:engage in processing effort e2 is the same in all cells of Table 2:  e2 =(A+λB)/2γg when ψ=1, 
19:551:36065:30:28:71:518:618:144:Times:144:Times:B:which is one-half of its first-best level.  Then again, the relevant incentive problem occurs in 
19:552:36162:28:27:71:500:590:144:Times:144:Times:B:input search rather than processing, which obtains its first-best along the diagonal, when 
19:553:36253:27:28:71:480:563:144:Times:144:Times:B:ownership and control is given to the same party.  In this case the surplus function is 
19:554:36341:28:28:71:374:535:144:Times:144:Times:B:supermodular, as is also obtained when θ is sufficiently low.10 
19:555:36404:28:27:107:520:507:144:Times:144:Times:A:When value-added is high, however, or human-capital specificity is low, then surplus 
19:556:36489:27:28:71:489:480:144:Times:144:Times:B:depends more on ameliorating the incentive problem in processing.  In these cases, the 
19:557:36576:28:27:71:504:452:144:Times:144:Times:B:manager’s effort is improved by giving her better outside options.  In particular, when the 
19:558:36668:27:28:71:520:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:foreign firm owns the factory then the manager’s outside options are improved by giving her 
19:559:36759:28:28:71:538:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:control over the inputs.  Because ownership and control are given to opposite parties, this means 
19:560:36857:28:28:71:271:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:that the surplus function is submodular.   
19:561:36900:28:29:107:538:341:144:Times:144:Times:A:We can think of a low value of ψ, the measure of human-capital specificity, as indicating 
19:562:36990:29:27:71:539:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:“thick labor markets” for the manager, since her outside options are improved.  We might expect 
19:563:37086:27:28:71:539:285:144:Times:144:Times:B:this to occur in coastal regions of China or in the country’s special economic zones where export 
19:564:37184:28:28:71:530:257:144:Times:144:Times:B:processing plants have agglomerated and where rules governing employment and firm creation 
19:565:37275:28:30:71:517:229:144:Times:144:Times:B:are less restrictive.  A lower value of ψ, or higher productivity in processing as measured by 
19:566:37370:30:28:71:535:199:144:Times:144:Times:B:(A+λB), both give more submodular values of the surplus function.  This result follows directly 
19:567:37466:28:36:71:265:171:144:Times:144:Times:B:from the measure of modularity in (12): 
19:568:37506:36:8:71:218:135:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                 
19:569:37554:8:16:71:530:127:42:Times:99:Times:F:10 When θ is low (say, θ=0) and the factory manager has all the bargaining power, then she maximizes π so all her 
19:570:37668:16:13:71:530:111:99:Times:99:Times:F:effort decisions are at their first-best level.  Likewise for the foreign firm provided that it owns the factory.  When 
19:571:37788:13:12:71:539:98:99:Times:99:Times:F:the manager owns the factory, however, then the foreign firm makes second-best effort choices on e3, and also on e1 
19:572:37903:12:12:71:512:86:99:Times:99:Times:F:when the foreign firm controls inputs.  Thus, the worst outcome in this case is to have Chinese ownership and 
19:573:38013:12:0:71:316:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:foreign control of inputs, leading to supermodular welfare.

20:600:38262:21:28:71:526:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:Below, we apply this result by examining how processing exports vary across the four factory-
20:601:38355:28:27:71:540:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:ownership and input-control regimes.  More generally, the goals of our empirical analysis will be 
20:602:38453:27:28:71:485:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:to assess the modularity of the surplus function and to estimate the model parameters.

20:606:38618:27:28:107:511:453:144:Times:144:Times:A:The modularity of the surplus function cannot be tested directly, because we do not 
20:607:38702:28:27:71:506:425:144:Times:144:Times:B:observe the value of surplus from outsourcing activity; instead, we observe the processing 
20:608:38793:27:28:71:540:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:exports accounted for by each ownership and control regime.  To move from the value of surplus 
20:609:38888:28:27:71:496:370:144:Times:144:Times:B:in (12) to the frequency of contractual regimes in our data, we adopt a simple stochastic 
20:610:38978:27:31:71:517:343:144:Times:144:Times:B:specification.  In particular, we suppose that ownership and control in our data are chosen to 
20:611:39073:31:31:71:511:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:maximize W(δ1, δ2) plus an i.i.d. extreme value random error that varies across contractual 
20:612:39165:31:28:71:523:281:144:Times:144:Times:B:types.11  Then it is well known (see, e.g., Train, 1986) that the probabilities of observing each 
20:613:39263:28:28:71:261:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:contractual type take on the logit form:

20:620:39494:14:27:107:514:146:144:Times:144:Times:A:To measure the probabilities on the left of (15), we shall use the share of processing 
20:621:39581:27:33:71:508:119:144:Times:144:Times:B:trade accounted for by each contractual type.  Denoting these export shares by S(i, j), our

20:623:39722:7:0:71:373:79:42:Times:99:Times:F:11  A stochastic specification of this type is suggested by Whinston (2001). 
21:624:39877:0:28:71:351:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:measure of the modularity of the welfare function is then: 
21:625:39936:28:15:107:110:681:144:Times:144:Times:A: 
21:626:39936:15:28:143:403:666:144:Times:144:Times:A:MOD ≡ [ln S(0,0) + ln S(1,1) – ln S(1,0) – ln S(0,1)]  
21:627:39991:28:28:179:526:638:144:Times:144:Times:A:= [W(0,0) + W(1,1) – W(1,0) – W(0,1)] ,    (16) 
21:628:40036:28:14:179:182:610:144:Times:144:Times:A: 
21:629:40036:14:27:71:538:596:144:Times:144:Times:B:where the second line follows from replacing Pr(i, j) by S(i, j) in (17).  We assess the modularity 
21:630:40136:27:28:71:539:569:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the welfare function in Chinese export processing by calculating the expression for the sum of 
21:631:40234:28:27:71:540:541:144:Times:144:Times:B:log export shares in the first line of equation (16).  We then see how this expression varies across 
21:632:40335:27:28:71:275:514:144:Times:144:Times:B:Chinese regions and trade policy regimes. 
21:633:40377:28:28:107:521:486:144:Times:144:Times:A:Turning to parametric techniques, if we observed individual export processing plants, 
21:634:40463:28:27:71:539:458:144:Times:144:Times:B:then we could estimate (15) using standard multinomial logit techniques, in which the dependent 
21:635:40559:27:28:71:524:431:144:Times:144:Times:B:variable would indicate which of the four factory-ownership/input-control regimes is chosen.  
21:636:40653:28:27:71:508:403:144:Times:144:Times:B:Our data, while not at the factory level, are still highly disaggregated.  For each of the four 
21:637:40749:27:28:71:523:376:144:Times:144:Times:B:ownership/control regimes, we observe exports by year, Chinese city, type of economic zone, 
21:638:40841:28:28:71:535:348:144:Times:144:Times:B:product, and destination market, yielding approximately 170,000 observations per year.  For the 
21:639:40937:28:27:71:524:320:144:Times:144:Times:B:vast majority of these year-city-zone-product-destination country cells, exports are positive in 
21:640:41034:27:28:71:539:293:144:Times:144:Times:B:only one of the four input-country/ownership regimes.  This makes it feasible to use multinomial 
21:641:41131:28:27:71:514:265:144:Times:144:Times:B:logit to estimate the underlying parameters of the welfare function.  The dependent variable 
21:642:41224:27:28:71:511:238:144:Times:144:Times:B:indicates for a given cell which of the four ownership/control regimes has positive exports. 
21:643:41317:28:28:107:523:210:144:Times:144:Times:A:To apply multinomial logit, we measure welfare for a given ownership/control regime 
21:644:41401:28:29:71:539:182:144:Times:144:Times:B:choice relative to welfare for some base choice, which we select to be W(0,0).  For convenience, 
21:645:41498:29:0:71:513:153:144:Times:144:Times:B:we shall weight welfare by the inverse of σ(A+λB)2/γg, where (A+λB)2/γg is the (first-best) 
22:646:41668:0:29:71:540:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:value-added in the processing factory, and σ is a parameter related to the variance of the extreme 
22:647:41767:29:27:71:488:679:144:Times:144:Times:B:value error.12  Using the effort levels shown in Table 2, the relative welfare levels are:

22:888:43126:0:7:313:318:110:81:Times:81:Times:F:2
22:889:43127:7:16:318:530:103:99:Times:99:Times:F:/6, so that μ = 1. Our assumption is that the variance 
22:890:43182:16:0:71:188:87:99:Times:99:Times:F:parameter μ equals σ(A+λB)
22:891:43208:0:7:188:193:94:81:Times:81:Times:F:2
22:892:43209:7:13:192:531:87:99:Times:99:Times:F:/γg, so that by dividing each observation by this, we effectively obtain μ = 1.  We do 
22:893:43296:13:0:71:325:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:not attempt to identify σ, but shall treat it as a fixed parameter. 
23:894:43442:0:27:71:120:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:4.2  Data 
23:895:43452:27:28:107:523:681:144:Times:144:Times:A:Data are from the Customs General Administration of the People’s Republic of China 
23:896:43535:28:27:71:535:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:and show processing imports and exports by year (1997-2002), 8-digit harmonized system (HS) 
23:897:43627:27:28:71:520:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:product, origin or destination city-districts in China (including trade zone status), destination 
23:898:43725:28:27:71:538:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:country (including whether goods are exported directly or through Hong Kong), customs regime 
23:899:43818:27:28:71:526:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:(pure-assembly or import-and-assembly), and ownership type (foreign or Chinese-owned).  In 
23:900:43909:28:28:71:536:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:addition, we make use of import and re-export data for Hong Kong by year (1997-2001), source 
23:901:44002:28:27:71:524:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:and destination country, and 8-digit HS product.  The detail in these data approach that which 
23:902:44097:27:28:71:535:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:might be available from a firm level dataset, even though the fundamental observation available 
23:903:44192:28:27:71:520:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:to us is the 8-digit HS product, Chinese city-district, and destination market.  For example, if 
23:904:44289:27:28:71:516:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:there is a single factory processing “women’s or girl’s suit-type jackets of wool” in Pudong, 
23:905:44383:28:28:71:522:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:Shanghai, operating in a SEZ, and exporting goods directly to the U.S., then the Chinese data 
23:906:44477:28:27:71:535:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:would show its ownership and control regime along with its export value.  However, if there are 
23:907:44573:27:28:71:528:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:several such processing factories in Pudong (located in the same economic zone and exporting 
23:908:44666:28:27:71:523:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:the same product directly to the U.S.), then the exports of each ownership and control regime 
23:909:44760:27:28:71:538:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:represented there would be listed.  Thus, a given city-economic zone-product-destination market 
23:910:44856:28:28:71:486:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:cell might show positive exports for more than one type of contractual arrangement.13 
23:911:44941:28:27:107:530:239:144:Times:144:Times:A:To estimate the parameters of the welfare function, we need measures of the two value- 
23:912:45028:27:28:71:533:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:added ratios appearing on the right of (17).  As discussed in the data appendix, we will measure 
23:913:45125:28:27:71:511:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:the value-added in processing trade within China using an estimated input-output table that 
23:914:45217:27:28:71:529:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:differs across provinces, and we shall measure the value-added in input search by the markups 
23:915:45311:28:32:71:535:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:charged on goods re-exported from Hong Kong to China.  From these two data sources the ratio 
23:916:45404:32:7:71:218:97:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                 
23:917:45452:7:16:71:525:90:42:Times:99:Times:F:13 In our data 82.7% of observations have positive exports in one ownership/control regime, 13.4% have positive 
23:918:45564:16:0:71:544:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:exports in two regimes, 3.4% have positive exports in three regimes, and 0.5% have positive exports in four regimes.  
24:919:45760:0:30:71:539:707:144:Times:144:Times:B:[P/(A+λB)]2 is constructed, which we refer to as the inbound value-added ratio, since it depends 
24:920:45857:30:28:71:516:677:144:Times:144:Times:B:on the effort devoted to bringing inputs into China.  It is more difficult to measure the value-
24:921:45953:28:28:71:536:649:144:Times:144:Times:B:added in marketing the final good since this depends on the destination market for the processed 
24:922:46050:28:27:71:539:621:144:Times:144:Times:B:good, but we attempt to do so using the markup on goods leaving China and re-exported through 
24:923:46144:27:30:71:518:594:144:Times:144:Times:B:Hong Kong.  The ratio of this to the value-added on processing trade within China is used to 
24:924:46236:30:0:71:192:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:(imperfectly) measure (B
24:925:46260:0:7:193:198:571:81:Times:81:Times:F:2

24:927:46273:0:7:258:263:571:81:Times:81:Times:F:2
24:928:46274:7:30:262:514:564:144:Times:144:Times:A:/γg], which we refer to as the outbound value-added 
24:929:46326:30:28:71:482:534:144:Times:144:Times:B:ratio, since it depends on the effort in marketing the final good exported from China. 
24:930:46413:28:27:107:541:506:144:Times:144:Times:A:Because of the errors involved in estimating the Hong-Kong markup and the input-output 
24:931:46500:27:28:71:528:479:144:Times:144:Times:B:table for processing trade within China, both the value-added ratios are measured at the 1-digit 
24:932:46597:28:27:71:532:451:144:Times:144:Times:B:SITC level rather than the 8-digit HS level; these ratios also vary across years, across provinces 
24:933:46696:27:28:71:541:424:144:Times:144:Times:B:(since the processing input-output table differs across provinces),  and across destination markets 
24:934:46796:28:29:71:534:396:144:Times:144:Times:B:(for the outbound ratio).  The coefficients of the two value-added ratios along with the intercept 
24:935:46895:29:29:71:531:367:144:Times:144:Times:B:terms in (17) are estimated by multinomial logit, from which the underlying parameters φ, θ, ψ 
24:936:46989:29:28:71:493:338:144:Times:144:Times:B:are obtained once we specify σ as a parameter.14  We correct the standard errors for the 
24:937:47078:28:28:71:535:310:144:Times:144:Times:B:correlation across errors because the value-added ratios are measured across 1-digit SITC rather 
24:938:47175:28:28:71:520:282:144:Times:144:Times:B:than 8-digit HS products.  Our estimates will be sensitive to the Hong Kong markups that we 
24:939:47267:28:27:71:523:254:144:Times:144:Times:B:use, and as discussed by Feenstra et al (1999), there are several methods available to estimate 
24:940:47363:27:28:71:497:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:these.  After reporting benchmark results, we investigate the sensitivity of the parameter 
24:941:47454:28:40:71:316:199:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates to alternative measures of the markups.   
24:942:47506:40:11:71:218:159:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                 
24:943:47554:11:7:71:300:148:42:Times:99:g_d0_f7:F:14   Because we do not accurately measure the ratio (B2/γ
24:944:47611:7:0:300:344:141:81:Times:99:Times:F:f)/[(A+λB)
24:945:47621:0:8:344:355:149:81:Times:99:g_d0_f7:F:2/γ
24:946:47624:8:10:355:526:141:81:Times:99:Times:F:g] appearing in (17b) and (17c), we do not 
24:947:47667:10:16:71:529:131:99:Times:99:Times:F:expect to identify the intercepts in those equations.  So we rely on the single intercept term of (17a), together with 
24:948:47786:16:0:71:218:115:99:Times:99:Times:F:the three coefficients of  [P/(A+λB)]
24:949:47823:0:7:218:223:122:81:Times:81:Times:F:2
24:950:47824:7:0:222:535:115:99:Times:99:g_d0_f7:F:, to measure the four parameters φ, θ, ψ, and (γg/γf).  It is readily shown that φ
24:951:47906:0:7:535:540:122:81:Times:81:Times:F:2
24:952:47907:7:13:539:541:115:99:Times:99:Times:F: 
24:953:47907:13:15:71:542:102:99:Times:99:Times:F:is proportional to the choice of σ, so we can only measure the relative magnitude of this parameter (across regions or 
24:954:48026:15:13:71:523:87:99:Times:99:Times:F:time).  The ratio (γg/γf) is also quite sensitive to the choice of σ, so we do not report this parameter.  The human-
24:955:48143:13:0:71:423:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:capital specificity parameter ψ is independent of σ, while θ depends on σ only slightly.

25:957:48332:27:28:71:169:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:5.1  Export Shares 
25:958:48351:28:27:71:512:653:144:Times:144:Times:B: To evaluate the modularity of the welfare function nonparametrically, we report the 
25:959:48435:27:28:71:537:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:average values of export-shares across the four factory-ownership and input-control regimes.  In 
25:960:48532:28:27:71:503:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:Table 3, the first two columns show export shares in the total sample, and the second two 
25:961:48622:27:28:71:534:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:columns show export shares for all provinces expect those on the southern coast (i.e., excluding 
25:962:48719:28:28:71:525:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and Hainan).  Reading down the diagonal of the first 
25:963:48811:28:27:71:494:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:matrix, foreign control of the inputs (the pure-assembly regime) combined with foreign 
25:964:48898:27:28:71:530:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:ownership of the factory accounts for an average of 8.3% of processing exports, while Chinese 
25:965:48992:28:27:71:520:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:ownership of the factory and control of the inputs accounts for 14.6% of processing exports.  
25:966:49086:27:28:71:530:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:Much more weight occurs on the off-diagonal, where Chinese control of the inputs (the import-
25:967:49179:28:28:71:523:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:and-assembly regime) combined with foreign ownership of the factory accounts for 49.6% of 
25:968:49269:28:27:71:507:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:exports, and foreign control of the inputs combined with Chinese ownership of the factory 
25:969:49359:27:28:71:529:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:accounts for 27.1% of processing exports.  Computing MOD as in (16), this is highly negative, 
25:970:49453:28:27:71:540:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:confirming that dispersed control/ownership is more likely than concentrated control/ownership.  
25:971:49550:27:28:71:507:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:Thus, in the full sample, the data support the submodularity of the surplus function.  From 
25:972:49642:28:28:71:536:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:Proposition 1, this is consistent with some combination of high value-added in input processing, 
25:973:49739:28:27:71:497:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:low human-capital specificity, and a relatively high bargaining weight for foreign firms. 
25:974:49829:27:28:71:497:212:144:Times:144:Times:B: From Proposition 2, we expect the welfare function to be less submodular where 
25:975:49908:28:27:71:511:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:productivity in export processing is lower or human-capital specificity is higher.  In China, 
25:976:50002:27:28:71:514:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:export processing activities are highly concentrated in coastal provinces.  Given the relative 
25:977:50097:28:28:71:536:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:absence of export processing in interior provinces, we might expect human-capital specificity to 
25:978:50194:28:0:71:529:101:144:Times:144:Times:B:be higher in these regions.  Managers or foreign firms who separate from their trading partners 
26:979:50368:0:28:71:539:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:would presumably be less able to find an alternative partner in the interior than they would along 
26:980:50467:28:28:71:535:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:the coast.  In the second two columns of Table 3, we separate out processing exports for interior 
26:981:50565:28:27:71:539:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:China.  For the interior provinces we find that the MOD measure is positive rather than negative, 
26:982:50663:27:28:71:472:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:indicating supermodular welfare.  This appears to be consistent with Proposition 2. 
26:983:50747:28:27:71:533:598:144:Times:144:Times:B: One reason that coastal China has developed more export processing than the rest of the 
26:984:50835:27:28:71:541:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:country is that over the last two decades trade policies have varied substantially across regions of 
26:985:50936:28:28:71:532:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:the country.  In the early stage of China’s economic opening, the government permitted foreign 
26:986:51031:28:27:71:518:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:trade and investment only in Special Economic Zones (SEZs) located in the southern coastal 
26:987:51122:27:28:71:521:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:provinces of Guangdong and Fujian.   In the mid to late 1980s, the government expanded the 
26:988:51213:28:27:71:536:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:number of regions in which foreign trade and investment were permitted.  By the 1990s, foreign 
26:989:51308:27:28:71:517:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:trade and investment were allowed (subject to government approval) throughout the country 
26:990:51398:28:28:71:515:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:(Demurger et al, 2001).  Still, much export activity continued to be concentrated in SEZs.15  
26:991:51492:28:27:71:529:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:Advantages to being in a zone may include expedited treatment by customs of imported inputs 
26:992:51584:27:28:71:535:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:and exported outputs, more freedom to import or export goods directly rather than through state-
26:993:51680:28:27:71:535:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:owned foreign trade corporations, greater opportunities to retain foreign exchange earnings, and 
26:994:51777:27:28:71:512:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:access to various types of tax incentives.  There are is also a separate court system set up to 
26:995:51873:28:28:71:422:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:handle civil and commercial legal cases in trade zones (Wang, 2000).      
26:996:51947:28:27:71:537:239:144:Times:144:Times:B: Being in a SEZ may affect the choice of input-control and factory-ownership regime in a 
26:997:52035:27:28:71:531:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:variety of ways.  Since SEZs are the center of import and export activities in China, it might be 
26:998:52133:28:27:71:517:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:relatively easy for a foreign firm or Chinese factory with a presence in an SEZ to find a new 
26:999:52227:27:37:71:539:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:export supplier or foreign buyer.  We hypothesize that this would lower the specificity of human-
26:1000:52324:37:7:71:218:120:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                 
26:1001:52372:7:16:71:536:113:42:Times:99:Times:F:15 SEZs have been succeeded by second and third generation trade and development zones, including bonded areas, 
26:1002:52484:16:11:71:519:97:99:Times:99:Times:F:Economic and Technological Development Areas, and Hi-Technology Development Areas.  At risk of blurring 
26:1003:52588:11:12:71:539:86:99:Times:99:Times:F:definitions, we refer to all of these zones as SEZs.  These zones are managed by provincial governments and so may 
26:1004:52703:12:0:71:332:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:exhibit regional variation in their organization and effectiveness. 
27:1005:52849:0:28:71:531:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:capital investments by factory managers and foreign buyers, and by Proposition 2, would make 
27:1006:52942:28:28:71:537:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:concentrated input-control and factory-ownership less likely inside SEZs than outside SEZs.  To 
27:1007:53038:28:27:71:542:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:evaluate this, Table 4 replicates the results in Table 3 breaking out processing exports by whether 
27:1008:53138:27:28:71:526:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:or not they are produced in one of China’s Special Economic Zones (SEZs).  Being inside and 
27:1009:53230:28:27:71:538:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:SEZ puts over 75% of the export mass in the lower-left cell, with foreign ownership but Chinese 
27:1010:53326:27:28:71:538:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:control of the inputs.  Outside the SEZs, there is 44% of the export share with foreign ownership 
27:1011:53424:28:28:71:525:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Chinese control, but another 32% with the reverse case of Chinese ownership and foreign 
27:1012:53516:28:27:71:542:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:control of the input, so again the preponderance of export mass is on the off-diagonal of Table 4.  
27:1013:53616:27:28:71:539:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:So being outside the SEZ does affect the type of contract used in outsourcing, but the modularity 
27:1014:53714:28:27:71:350:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:measures within or outside the SEZ are not that different. 
27:1015:53773:27:28:71:522:433:144:Times:144:Times:B: Another useful way to split the sample is according to whether the processing exports 
27:1016:53859:28:28:71:501:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:from China are re-exported through Hong Kong or not.  Re-exports are not simply goods 
27:1017:53945:28:27:71:526:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:transshipped through Hong Kong; rather, they are goods that clear customs in Hong Kong and 
27:1018:54036:27:28:71:513:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:that are taken into possession (and subject to intermediation services) by firms there.  Hong 
27:1019:54130:28:27:71:535:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:Kong traders typically grade them according to quality, package and label them, and arrange for 
27:1020:54226:27:28:71:523:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:their shipment to final destination markets (Sung, 1991).  As compared to direct exports from 
27:1021:54320:28:28:71:532:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:China, we conjecture that Hong Kong firms have a higher relatively high marginal productivity 
27:1022:54414:28:28:71:532:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:of investment (B) in export processing activities and relatively low specificity of human-capital 
27:1023:54512:28:29:71:528:211:144:Times:144:Times:B:investments (ψ).  By Proposition 2, we then expect export processing involving Hong Kong to 
27:1024:54604:29:27:71:542:182:144:Times:144:Times:B:exhibit more dispersed ownership and control.  Table 5 separates Chinese processing exports into 
27:1025:54701:27:28:71:521:155:144:Times:144:Times:B:those shipped directly to destination markets and those re-exported through Hong Kong.  For 
27:1026:54793:28:0:71:522:127:144:Times:144:Times:B:Hong Kong re-exports, there is more mass along the off-diagonal in dispersed ownership and 
28:1027:54962:0:28:71:526:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:control regimes.  Thus, for re-exports through Hong Kong, MOD is more negative, as is again 
28:1028:55054:28:28:71:223:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:consistent with Proposition 2.   
28:1029:55087:28:27:71:524:653:144:Times:144:Times:B: Lastly, we investigate how ownership and control differs across various industries.  In 
28:1030:55175:27:28:71:538:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:Tables 6 and 7 we contrast two low value-added industries (apparel and footwear) with two high 
28:1031:55270:28:27:71:517:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:value-added industries (office machines and electrical machinery).16  In Table 6, apparel has 
28:1032:55364:27:28:71:522:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:export shares that are rather evenly spread across the four ownership/control regimes (though 
28:1033:55458:28:28:71:535:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:somewhat less in Chinese ownership and control), and its measure of modularity MOD is closer 
28:1034:55551:28:27:71:498:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:to zero than the overall sample in Table 3.  Footwear also has a less negative measure of 
28:1035:55641:27:28:71:515:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:modularity, though it is closer to the overall sample.  From Proposition 1, industries are less 
28:1036:55737:28:27:71:540:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:likely to be submodular when the value-added in input processing is low, and this is true for both 
28:1037:55836:27:28:71:539:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:these industries.  In contrast, office machines in Table 6 has nearly 70% of its export share in the 
28:1038:55937:28:28:71:517:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:Chinese control/foreign ownership regime, and the modularity measure MOD is much more 
28:1039:56023:28:27:71:512:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:negative than for the entire sample.  Electrical machinery is also more submodular than the 
28:1040:56115:27:28:71:508:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:overall sample.  These are both high value-added industries, so the lower value of MOD is 
28:1041:56205:28:27:71:251:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:consistent with Propositions 1 and 2. 
28:1042:56243:27:28:71:529:295:144:Times:144:Times:B: The differing pattern of ownership/control across industries may account in part for the 
28:1043:56332:28:28:71:535:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:differing magnitude of MOD across regions of China:  the coastal provinces have roughly equal 
28:1044:56426:28:27:71:539:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:processing exports within SITC 7 (which includes office machines and electrical machinery) and 
28:1045:56521:27:28:71:534:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:outside of SITC 7, whereas the interior provinces have four times more exports outside of SITC 
28:1046:56616:28:27:71:535:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:7, and especially within SITC 8 (which includes apparel, footwear, and toys).  In our parametric 
28:1047:56713:27:37:71:521:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimation we will control for differences in value-added across industries by using this as an 
28:1048:56809:37:7:71:218:120:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                 
28:1049:56857:7:16:71:519:113:42:Times:99:Times:F:16 Over the sample period, apparel accounts for 16.9% of China’s total processing exports, electrical machinery 
28:1050:56969:16:11:71:526:97:99:Times:99:Times:F:accounts for 11.7%, office machines accounts for 11.4%, and footwear accounts for 6.5%, making these the first, 
28:1051:57081:11:12:71:530:86:99:Times:99:Times:F:third, fourth, and sixth largest Chinese industries for processing exports (the second and fifth largest industries are 
28:1052:57201:12:0:71:338:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:jewelry and telecommunications and sound recording equipment). 
29:1053:57342:0:29:71:509:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:independent variable.  In addition, we allow for other differences across coastal and inland 
29:1054:57435:29:29:71:427:680:144:Times:144:Times:B:provinces by letting the model parameters ψ and φ differ across regions.   
29:1055:57510:29:13:71:74:651:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
29:1056:57510:13:29:71:252:638:144:Times:144:Times:B:5.2  Parametric Estimation Results 
29:1057:57545:29:28:71:515:609:144:Times:144:Times:B: We turn now to the estimation of the model parameters:  ψ, the specificity of human 
29:1058:57629:28:29:71:540:581:144:Times:144:Times:B:capital in a factory manager-foreign firm relationship; θ, the bargaining weight for foreign firms; 
29:1059:57729:29:29:71:538:552:144:Times:144:Times:B:and φ, the probability that contracts will be unenforceable.  The latter parameter is very sensitive 
29:1060:57830:29:29:71:541:523:144:Times:144:Times:B:to our choice of σ, which is related to the variance of the extreme-value distribution.  We choose  
29:1061:57930:29:29:71:532:494:144:g_d0_f7:144:Times:B:σ = 0.1 to ensure that φ lies between zero and unity, and focus on the relative magnitude of this 
29:1062:58028:29:28:71:461:465:144:Times:144:Times:B:parameter across various dimensions of the data rather than its absolute level.17   
29:1063:58112:28:27:107:520:437:144:Times:144:Times:A:In Table 8, we report the results from MNL estimation of the three equations in (17).  
29:1064:58199:27:28:71:529:410:144:Times:144:Times:B:With six years of data (1999 – 2002) and thirty Chinese provinces, we can allow parameters to 
29:1065:58293:28:27:71:507:382:144:Times:144:Times:B:change over time and across regions.  We adopt a parsimonious specification whereby the 
29:1066:58381:27:28:71:493:355:144:Times:144:Times:B:coefficients of the two valued-added ratios appearing on the right of (17) have constant 
29:1067:58470:28:28:71:530:327:144:Times:144:Times:B:coefficients, whereas the intercept terms vary across inland and coastal regions and also years.  
29:1068:58568:28:27:71:537:299:144:Times:144:Times:B:In addition, we allow for interaction terms between the four coastal regions (northern provinces; 
29:1069:58666:27:28:71:533:272:144:Times:144:Times:B:those around Beijing; those around Shanghai; and southern provinces) and the two time periods 
29:1070:58760:28:27:71:529:244:144:Times:144:Times:B:1997-99 and 2000-02.  The usefulness of this fixed-effects specification will be apparent when 
29:1071:58855:27:28:71:245:217:144:Times:144:Times:B:we discuss the parameter estimates. 
29:1072:58891:28:28:107:515:189:144:Times:144:Times:A:In Table 8, the sign pattern of the coefficients in the three MNL equations meets our 
29:1073:58977:28:29:71:539:161:144:Times:144:Times:B:expectations from (17).  For example, in the first regression, the inbound value-added ratio has a 
29:1074:59076:29:30:71:506:132:144:Times:144:Times:B:negative coefficient in (17a) provided that (γg/γf) is not too small, and this negative sign is 
29:1075:59172:30:11:71:218:102:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                 
29:1076:59220:11:7:71:204:91:42:Times:99:g_d0_f7:F:17   As discussed in note 14, the γ
29:1077:59255:7:10:204:526:84:81:Times:99:Times:F:g/γf is also quite sensitive to the choice of σ, so we do not report this parameter, 
29:1078:59340:10:0:71:255:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:which is typically slightly greater than unity.  
30:1079:59467:0:28:71:535:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:confirmed in the estimated equation (17a) in Table 8.  The outbound value-added ratio does not 
30:1080:59562:28:29:71:539:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:appear at all in (17a), and its estimated coefficient in Table 8 is very small.  The intercept term is 
30:1081:59665:29:31:71:505:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:positive in (17a), where it equals φ2θ2(1 – ψ2)/σ, and also in the estimate of Table 8.  Our 
30:1082:59758:31:27:71:533:621:144:Times:144:Times:B:inclusion of Hong-Kong and SEZ indicator variables, as well as the regional indicator variables 
30:1083:59854:27:28:71:511:594:144:Times:144:Times:B:for the four coastal regions, clearly affects the estimate of the intercept term in Table 8 and 
30:1084:59950:28:28:71:529:566:144:Times:144:Times:B:therefore affects the implied parameters.  Using equations (17) and the estimates from Table 8, 
30:1085:60046:28:29:71:523:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:we can solve for the implied parameters ψ, φ and θ, as reported in Table 9.  We also compute 
30:1086:60139:29:28:71:530:509:144:Times:144:Times:B:standard errors by bootstrapping equations (17) with 100 replications.  For convenience, we do 
30:1087:60234:28:27:71:516:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:not report the standard error for each estimate and region, but instead indicate the maximum 
30:1088:60327:27:29:71:221:454:144:Times:144:Times:B:standard error across regions.   
30:1089:60360:29:28:107:539:425:144:Times:144:Times:A:From Table 9, we see that the estimates of ψ, the degree of human-capital specificity, are 
30:1090:60451:28:29:71:526:397:144:Times:144:Times:B:highest in Beijing and lowest in the southern coast.  Since this parameter reflect the loss in the 
30:1091:60550:29:28:71:510:368:144:Times:144:Times:B:return to human-capital investments when bargaining breaks down, lower values of ψ may 
30:1092:60637:28:28:71:521:340:144:Times:144:Times:B:indicate a “thicker” labor market and stronger outside options for the Chinese managers.  We 
30:1093:60730:28:27:71:529:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:find it highly plausible human-capital specificity is lowest in the southern coastal provinces of  
30:1094:60829:27:28:71:501:285:144:Times:144:Times:B:Guangdong, Fujian and Hainan Island due to the concentration of export activity in these 
30:1095:60918:28:28:71:497:257:144:Times:144:Times:B:regions.  It is somewhat surprisingly that this parameter is highest in Beijing, though the 
30:1096:61010:28:28:71:518:229:144:Times:144:Times:B:difference between Beijing and the northern or inland provinces is very small in the 2000-02 
30:1097:61103:28:29:71:539:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:period, whereas the southern coastal provinces still have a markedly lower value of ψ, indicating 
30:1098:61201:29:29:71:536:172:144:Times:144:Times:B:less human-capital specificity.  Just below the estimates of ψ for each time period, we report the 
30:1099:61300:29:27:71:522:143:144:Times:144:Times:B:range of these parameters across regions.  Generally, these ranges are reduced in the 2000-02 
30:1100:61394:27:28:71:537:116:144:Times:144:Times:B:period as compared to 1997-99.  These results are suggestive of labor markets that are becoming 
30:1101:61490:28:0:71:327:88:144:Times:144:Times:B:more integrated within and across regions over time. 
31:1102:61621:0:29:71:537:708:144:Times:144:Times:B: In addition, the estimates of ψ depend on whether the goods are processed in SEZ or not, 
31:1103:61710:29:27:71:522:679:144:Times:144:Times:B:and whether they are re-exported through Hong Kong or not.  Comparing the estimates in the 
31:1104:61801:27:29:71:523:652:144:Times:144:Times:B:first two columns of Table 9 with those in the second two columns, we see that direct exports 
31:1105:61895:29:28:71:541:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:have slightly higher estimates of ψ than do re-exports through Hong-Kong.  That is, by not using 
31:1106:61992:28:28:71:518:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:Hong-Kong traders to handle processed exports, Chinese entrepreneurs or foreign firms face 
31:1107:62083:28:28:71:530:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:slightly higher project specificity of human-capital investments (presumably because the Hong 
31:1108:62177:28:27:71:536:539:144:Times:144:Times:B:Kong traders can help arrange a new match).  This human-capital specificity is increased further 
31:1109:62274:27:28:71:542:512:144:Times:144:Times:B:when processing occurs outside of SEZ.  An exception to this rule occurs for the southern coastal 
31:1110:62372:28:27:71:540:484:144:Times:144:Times:B:provinces, where the loss in returns to human-capital investments remains close to 0.22 (or 22%) 
31:1111:62469:27:28:71:523:457:144:Times:144:Times:B:regardless of whether processing occurs in SEZ or whether the goods are re-exported through 
31:1112:62561:28:28:71:528:429:144:Times:144:Times:B:Hong Kong.  That estimate for Fujian, Guangdong and Hainan compares with the range 0.28 – 
31:1113:62651:28:28:71:317:401:144:Times:144:Times:B:0.51 (or 28 – 51%) for the other regions and years. 
31:1114:62703:28:29:107:513:373:144:Times:144:Times:A:Next in Table 9 we report the estimates of φ, which is the probability that a contract 
31:1115:62790:29:28:71:527:344:144:Times:144:Times:B:cannot be enforced so that Nash bargaining is used.  Recall that the absolute magnitude of this 
31:1116:62886:28:30:71:541:316:144:Times:144:Times:B:parameter depends on σ, which is related to the variance of the extreme-value distributions in the 
31:1117:62985:30:29:71:537:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:MNL specification.  We have chosen σ = 0.1 so that φ lies between zero and unity, and focus on 
31:1118:63080:29:28:71:520:257:144:Times:144:Times:B:the relative magnitude of this parameter rather than its absolute level.  Our estimates of φ are 
31:1119:63177:28:28:71:529:229:144:Times:144:Times:B:lowest in Beijing, suggesting the highest degree of legal enforcement there.  While we have no 
31:1120:63272:28:28:71:519:201:144:Times:144:Times:B:direct evidence on legal institutions across provinces, there is data on the level of “trust” that 
31:1121:63371:28:27:71:530:173:144:Times:144:Times:B:businesses perceive within each province, from Ke and Zhang (undated).18  According to these 
31:1122:63464:27:37:71:539:146:144:Times:144:Times:B:authors, Beijing and Shanghai rank as the most trustworthy locations.  Our estimates accord with 
31:1123:63561:37:8:71:218:109:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                 
31:1124:63609:8:15:71:528:101:42:Times:99:Times:F:18   These authors received a response from over 5,000 businesses on the question: “From your experience, which

32:1127:63871:0:30:71:529:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:theirs for Beijing, but not for Shanghai, where our estimates of φ in Table 9 are higher than for 
32:1128:63969:30:28:71:527:678:144:Times:144:Times:B:Beijing.  More surprisingly, our estimates shown the highest value of φ in the southern coastal 
32:1129:64065:28:28:71:537:650:144:Times:144:Times:B:provinces.  We would not have expected to have the highest probability of Nash bargaining (and 
32:1130:64160:28:27:71:539:622:144:Times:144:Times:B:lowest likelihood of legal enforcement) in these locations.  Ke and Zhang rank Guangdong as 4th 
32:1131:64255:27:28:71:533:595:144:Times:144:Times:B:in terms of “trust,” Fujian as 11th, but Hainan at 30th out of 31 provinces or autonomous regions 
32:1132:64353:28:29:71:529:567:144:Times:144:Times:B:(including Chongqin, which is a newly added 31st region).  While our finding that the southern 
32:1133:64448:29:28:71:538:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:coastal provinces have a much higher value of φ is surprising, we note that the disparity between 
32:1134:64546:28:28:71:532:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:these provinces and Beijing is somewhat lower in the 2000-02 period than in 1997-99.  In other 
32:1135:64641:28:27:71:455:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:words, there is evidence of regional convergence in legal institutions over time. 
32:1136:64723:27:28:107:516:455:144:Times:144:Times:A:Lastly in Table 9 we report the estimate of θ, the Nash bargaining weight for foreign 
32:1137:64809:28:28:71:537:427:144:Times:144:Times:B:firms, which is 0.69 (standard error of 0.12) across all regions and time periods.  It turns out that 
32:1138:64911:28:30:71:530:399:144:g_d0_f7:144:Times:B:θ depends only on the slope coefficients of the inbound and outbound value-added ratios, so in 
32:1139:65006:30:28:71:507:369:144:Times:144:Times:B:our specification it does not vary with region or time period, as do ψ and φ.  However, the 
32:1140:65098:28:28:71:519:341:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates of the bargaining weight would be sensitive to the measurement of the Hong Kong 
32:1141:65188:28:27:71:529:313:144:Times:144:Times:B:markups, used to compute the inbound and outbound value-added ratios.  Feenstra et al (1999) 
32:1142:65281:27:28:71:527:286:144:Times:144:Times:B:describe three methods for computing markups, and method C is used in Tables 6 and 7.19  By 
32:1143:65373:28:28:71:536:258:144:Times:144:Times:B:way of sensitivity analysis, we re-estimate (17) using the alternative methods A and B.  In Table 
32:1144:65471:28:28:71:522:230:144:Times:144:Times:B:10 we report parameter estimates using these methods, focusing on 2000-02 for convenience. 
32:1145:65562:28:29:107:532:202:144:Times:144:Times:A:Considering first the estimates of ψ, method B gives estimates that are larger than those 
32:1146:65652:29:30:71:541:173:144:Times:144:Times:B:for methods A or C.  Despite the differences in magnitude, the overall pattern of estimates across 
32:1147:65751:30:7:71:218:143:144:Times:144:Times:B:                                                 
32:1148:65799:7:16:71:522:136:42:Times:99:Times:F:19   These methods are described in the data appendix.  The difficulty in measuring the re-export markups is that 
32:1149:65913:16:12:71:532:120:99:Times:99:Times:F:Hong Kong re-exports are distinguished by destination country whereas Hong Kong imports are not, so the bundle 
32:1150:66024:12:11:71:527:108:99:Times:99:Times:F:of goods differs even at the 8-digit HS level.  Method A compares the Hong Kong  import unit-value for each HS 
32:1151:66135:11:11:71:541:97:99:Times:99:Times:F:product to the unit-value for re-exports to a destination country, whereas method B compares the Hong Kong import 
32:1152:66249:11:12:71:533:86:99:Times:99:Times:F:unit-value to the unit-value for all re-exports (regardless of destination country).  Method C attempts to correct the 
32:1153:66368:12:0:71:385:74:99:Times:99:Times:F:import unit-value to reflect the ultimate destination country for the re-exports. 
33:1154:66528:0:29:71:521:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:regions is similar in Table 9 and 8.  In all cases, Beijing has the highest estimate of ψ and the 
33:1155:66626:29:28:71:541:679:144:Times:144:Times:B:southern coastal provinces have the lowest, though the range of estimates across regions in Table 
33:1156:66724:28:29:71:525:651:144:Times:144:Times:B:10 is somewhat smaller than in Table 9.  Again, the lower values of ψ for the southern coastal 
33:1157:66819:29:28:71:468:622:144:Times:144:Times:B:provinces indicate less human-capital specificity and “thicker” labor market there. 
33:1158:66903:28:30:107:539:594:144:Times:144:Times:A:The estimates of φ in Table 10 are also larger than those reported in Table 9, and in some 
33:1159:66994:30:29:71:536:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:cases φ exceeds unity.  This could be readily corrected by choosing a lower value of σ, whereas  
33:1160:67091:29:29:71:516:535:144:Times:144:Times:B:we have maintained σ = 0.1 in both Tables 7 and 8.  The absolute magnitude of σ is not that 
33:1161:67183:29:28:71:532:506:144:Times:144:Times:B:relevant, but its relative magnitude across regions is still of interest.  Again, we obtain the same 
33:1162:67284:28:29:71:535:478:144:Times:144:Times:B:pattern of estimates in Table 10 and in our benchmark results of Table 9:  φ is lowest in Beijing, 
33:1163:67383:29:27:71:535:449:144:Times:144:Times:B:indicated the greatest degree of legal enforcement of contracts there, and highest in the southern 
33:1164:67482:27:28:71:518:422:144:Times:144:Times:B:coastal provinces.  Evidently, this pattern is not sensitive to the precise measure of the Hong 
33:1165:67578:28:28:71:395:394:144:Times:144:Times:B:Kong markups that we use in constructing the value-added ratios.   
33:1166:67645:28:29:107:533:366:144:Times:144:Times:A:Finally in Table 10 we report the estimate of θ, which is the Nash bargaining weight for 
33:1167:67734:29:27:71:537:337:144:Times:144:Times:B:the foreign firm.  It varies between 0.42 and 0.65 in Table 10, which is somewhat lower than the 
33:1168:67831:27:28:71:541:310:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimates of 0.69 in our benchmark results.  This range of estimates includes the value 0.5, which 
33:1169:67930:28:28:71:523:282:144:Times:144:Times:B:corresponds to simple Nash bargaining as used by Grossman and Hart (1986).  It appears that 
33:1170:68022:28:27:71:534:254:144:Times:144:Times:B:this simple bargaining rule is adequate to account for the contractual choices observed in export 
33:1171:68120:27:28:71:509:227:144:Times:144:Times:B:processing in China, provided that differences in human capital-specificity and contractual 
33:1172:68212:28:27:71:312:199:144:Times:144:Times:B:enforcement across regions are also incorporated. 
33:1173:68262:27:14:71:74:172:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
33:1174:68262:14:28:71:151:158:144:Times:144:Times:B:6.  Conclusions 
33:1175:68278:28:27:107:533:130:144:Times:144:Times:A:This paper reports a new empirical finding:  that the allocation of ownership and control 
33:1176:68368:27:28:71:537:103:144:Times:144:Times:B:in processing exports of China tends to be shared between foreign and local parties, with foreign 
33:1177:68466:28:0:71:513:75:144:Times:144:Times:B:firms likely to have (at least partial) ownership in the Chinese plant, but the Chinese parties 
34:1178:68640:0:28:71:534:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:having control over input-purchase decisions.  Based on anecdotal evidence, we expect that this 
34:1179:68736:28:28:71:539:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:pattern might apply in other developing countries as well, such as India.  A goal of our paper has 
34:1180:68835:28:27:71:534:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:been to reconcile this finding with available theories of the ownership/control structure within a 
34:1181:68934:27:28:71:528:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:firm.  We have drawn on the property-rights model due to Grossman and Hart (1986) and Hart 
34:1182:69025:28:27:71:530:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Moore (1990), while also including simple contracting costs into the model, in the spirit of 
34:1183:69122:27:28:71:537:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:the Holmstrom-Milgrom incentive-systems (IS) framework.  To conclude, it is useful to contrast 
34:1184:69217:28:28:71:398:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:these two models to see to which framework our results are closest. 
34:1185:69285:28:27:107:512:515:144:Times:144:Times:A:Holmstrom and Milgrom show that under certain conditions the IS model leads to a 
34:1186:69366:27:28:71:522:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:complementarity in the allocation of ownership/control instruments, so that these instruments 
34:1187:69460:28:27:71:514:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:tend to be given to the same party.  In our simple model of outsourcing, we find that the PR 
34:1188:69553:27:28:71:532:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:model leads to that outcome when value-added in the factory is low or the specificity of human-
34:1189:69648:28:28:71:503:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:capital investments is high.  But the PR model leads to the alternative arrangement with a 
34:1190:69739:28:27:71:528:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:sharing of the ownership/control instruments between the parties when value-added is high, or 
34:1191:69832:27:28:71:521:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:human-capital specificity is low.  The evidence from China strongly supports the finding that 
34:1192:69926:28:27:71:534:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:ownership and control is divided between the parties, and more so as we consider subsets of the 
34:1193:70022:27:28:71:527:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:data that focus on exports through Hong Kong, or that exclude the interior provinces:  in these 
34:1194:70118:28:28:71:528:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:cases, an even greater magnitude of exports occur in the foreign-ownership/local-input-control 
34:1195:70213:28:27:71:530:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:regime.  The finding that ownership and control is divided between parties therefore supports a 
34:1196:70309:27:28:71:518:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:PR framework with a low or moderate degree of human-capital specificity, meaning that the 
34:1197:70399:28:27:71:511:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:effect of outside options on incentives becomes very important.  There is some evidence of 
34:1198:70490:27:28:71:533:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:regional convergence in the contractual environment, which would be consistent with a gradual 
34:1199:70584:28:28:71:526:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:harmonization of legal institutions and equalization of access to world markets across regions.

35:1202:70772:27:14:71:371:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:A.  Estimating Value Added in Chinese Export Processing 
35:1203:70828:14:14:107:110:667:144:Times:144:Times:A: 
35:1204:70828:14:13:107:539:653:144:Times:144:Times:A:An initial measure of value-added in Chinese export processing is the difference between 
35:1205:70916:13:14:71:512:640:144:Times:144:Times:B:the value of processing exports and processing imports (relative to processing exports).  As 
35:1206:71009:14:14:71:526:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:shown at the bottom of column (3) in Table A1, average value-added is 36% over all products 
35:1207:71101:14:14:71:528:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:and years 1997-2002.  It is not possible to measure this by individual harmonized system (HS) 
35:1208:71195:14:14:71:534:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:products, however, since it is not known what other HS products they use as inputs.  Even if we 
35:1209:71291:14:13:71:504:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:aggregate the trade data to the 1-digit SITC level, as shown in Table A1, we see that for a 
35:1210:71383:13:14:71:525:571:144:Times:144:Times:B:number of SITC categories the value of processing imports exceeds exports:  obviously, these 
35:1211:71476:14:14:71:535:557:144:Times:144:Times:B:imports are being used to produce exports in alternative SITC products.  In order to measure the 
35:1212:71573:14:14:71:521:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:value-added within HS or SITC products, we therefore cannot rely on the difference between 
35:1213:71664:14:14:71:527:529:144:Times:144:Times:B:processing exports and imports.  Instead, we make use of the provincial-level processing trade 
35:1214:71759:14:13:71:505:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:data at the 1-digit SITC level to estimate an input-output table between SITC categories.   
35:1215:71851:13:14:107:110:502:144:Times:144:Times:A: 
35:1216:71851:14:14:107:531:488:144:Times:144:Times:A:There is considerable variation in the processing trade by 1-digit SITC industries across 
35:1217:71941:14:14:71:503:474:144:Times:144:Times:B:provinces.  In Table A2, we compare SITC 7 (machinery and transport equipment, which 
35:1218:72026:14:14:71:510:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:includes office machines) with all other SITC categories, across provinces.  For the coastal 
35:1219:72119:14:13:71:524:446:144:Times:144:Times:B:provinces, there is roughly equal processing exports within SITC 7 and outside this category.  
35:1220:72214:13:14:71:505:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:But the inland provinces have about four times as much processing exports outside of this 
35:1221:72304:14:14:71:492:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:category.  The most important sector for the inland provinces is SITC 8 (miscellaneous 
35:1222:72391:14:14:71:394:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:manufactured articles, which includes apparel, footwear and toys). 
35:1223:72458:14:14:107:110:391:144:Times:144:Times:A: 
35:1224:72458:14:13:107:525:377:144:Times:144:Times:A:Making use of the variation in processing trade across provinces, we estimate an input-
35:1225:72545:13:14:72:541:364:144:Times:144:Times:B:output table for processing trade, as discussed in section B.  This input-output table differs across 
35:1226:72647:14:14:72:517:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:provinces and years, reflecting the productivity with which processing imports are used.  By 
35:1227:72740:14:14:72:542:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:construction, the demand for processing imports from the input-output table exactly equals actual 
35:1228:72838:14:14:72:539:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:imports in each province, year, and 1-digit SITC product.  The average value-added estimates by 
35:1229:72934:14:13:72:370:308:144:Times:144:Times:B:1-digit SITC industries are shown in column (4) of Table A1. 
35:1230:72995:13:14:108:111:295:144:Times:144:Times:A: 
35:1231:72995:14:14:108:504:281:144:Times:144:Times:A:We do not obtain a value-added estimate in SITC 0 (food and live animals) that is 
35:1232:73077:14:14:72:512:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:significantly different from zero, and we are also unable to estimate value-added in SITC 9 
35:1233:73169:14:14:72:537:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:(special commodities and transactions).  There is little trade in either of these industries.  But for 
35:1234:73272:14:13:72:532:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:the remaining 1-digit SITC industries, the value-added estimates in Table A1 appear plausible.  
35:1235:73368:13:14:72:494:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:The industries with the greatest processing exports are SITC 6 (manufactured goods), 7 
35:1236:73455:14:14:72:520:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:(machinery and transport equipment) and 8 (miscellaneous manufactured goods).  We obtain 
35:1237:73544:14:14:72:536:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:relatively low value-added of 16% in SITC 6 and 8, and higher value-added of  55% in SITC 7.  
35:1238:73638:14:14:72:533:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:As described by Yeats (2001), SITC 7 includes a number of individual products and their parts, 
35:1239:73733:14:13:72:534:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:such as:  automobiles and their parts; computers and their parts; various types of machinery and 
35:1240:73830:13:14:72:531:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:their parts; etc.  So as a rough check on our value-added estimate of 55% from the input-output 
35:1241:73926:14:14:72:519:143:144:Times:144:Times:B:table, we can compare this to value of processing exports and processing imports (relative to 
35:1242:74020:14:14:72:517:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:processing exports), obtaining 50% as shown in column (3).  This is quite close to our input-
35:1243:74113:14:14:72:502:115:144:Times:144:Times:B:output estimate of 55% for this industry in column (4), giving us added confidence in the

37:1343:77585:14:14:107:541:397:144:Times:144:Times:A:The measurement of these Hong Kong markups is discussed in  Feenstra et al (1999), and 
37:1344:77672:14:13:71:529:383:144:Times:144:Times:B:is based on a comparison of unit-values for Hong Kong imports and re-exports of disaggregate 
37:1345:77765:13:14:72:537:370:144:Times:144:Times:B:commodities (as the 8-digit HS level).  This comparison is complicated, however, because when 
37:1346:77859:14:14:72:510:356:144:Times:144:Times:B:a good is imported into Hong Kong, it is not known whether it is intended for the domestic 
37:1347:77950:14:14:72:528:342:144:Times:144:Times:B:market or for re-export to some destination market.  So comparing the import unit-value to the 
37:1348:78045:14:14:72:539:328:144:Times:144:Times:B:unit-value for re-exports to China involves some error, and sometimes the computed Hong Kong 
37:1349:78138:14:13:72:306:314:144:Times:144:Times:B:markups can be negative rather than positive.20

37:1351:78188:14:14:107:540:287:144:Times:144:Times:A:Feenstra et al (1999) discuss several alternative methods for the markups calculation, and 
37:1352:78279:14:14:71:517:273:144:Times:144:Times:B:in Table A5 we summarize method A, B, and C for goods entering China, and method A for 
37:1353:78366:14:14:71:510:259:144:Times:144:Times:B:goods leaving China, averaged over 1-digit SITC categories.  Consider first goods entering 
37:1354:78457:14:13:71:536:245:144:Times:144:Times:B:China from Hong Kong (the “inbound” markups).  Method A compares the import unit-value of 
37:1355:78547:13:14:71:522:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:all Hong Kong imports of each HS product to the unit-value for re-exports to China, whereas 
37:1356:78639:14:14:72:529:218:144:Times:144:Times:B:method B compares the unit-value of all Hong Kong imports to the unit-value of all re-exports 
37:1357:78732:14:14:72:519:204:144:Times:144:Times:B:(of which about 80% on average go to China).21   From columns (1) and (2) in Table A5, the 
37:1358:78823:14:14:71:511:190:144:Times:144:Times:B:average markups is only 1.4% over all products and years using method A, and 4.1% using 
37:1359:78911:14:13:71:534:176:144:Times:144:Times:B:method B.  Method C attempts to improve on these estimates by using only 8-digit HS products 
37:1360:79004:13:14:71:531:163:144:Times:144:Times:B:for which the quantity of imports into Hong Kong are at least 90% of the quantity of re-exports 
37:1361:79100:14:14:71:523:149:144:Times:144:Times:B:to China, i.e., these HS products are nearly entirely destined for China.  From column (3), the 
37:1362:79196:14:26:71:539:135:144:Times:144:Times:B:average markup using method C is 4.2%, but there are some substantial differences in the 1-digit

37:1364:79341:8:15:71:529:101:42:Times:99:Times:F:20   Feenstra and Hanson (2002) argue that negative markups might be a genuine feature of the market, rather than 
37:1365:79455:15:7:71:364:86:99:Times:99:Times:F:just measurement error, due to “quality sorting” of goods in Hong Kong. 
37:1366:79527:7:0:71:393:79:42:Times:99:Times:F:21   We are excluding re-exports that originate in China from these calculations. 
38:1367:79687:0:14:71:541:709:144:Times:144:Times:B:markups across the various methods.  We choose method C for our benchmark estimates because 
38:1368:79779:14:14:71:509:695:144:Times:144:Times:B:it appears to give the most accurate comparison of goods imported into Hong Kong and re-
38:1369:79867:14:14:71:532:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:exported to China.  In cases where we obtain negative markups for the 1-digit SITC categories, 
38:1370:79962:14:14:71:491:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:these products are omitted from the calculation of the value-added ratios, and from our

38:1374:80157:14:14:71:522:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:(the “outbound” markups), these are calculated for each destination market.  In column (4) of 
38:1375:80251:14:14:71:526:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:Table A5 we report the average value of these markups across destination markets, and across 
38:1376:80344:14:13:71:541:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:years.  It can be seen that the outbound markups are much higher than the inbound markups, with
