2:32:1761:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:This paper studies the effect of top tax rates on inventors' international mobility since 1977. We put
2:33:1863:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:special emphasis on “superstar” inventors, those with the most abundant and most valuable patents.
2:34:1961:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:We use panel data on inventors from the United States and European Patent Offices to track inventors'
2:35:2062:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:locations over time and combine it with international effective top tax rate data. We construct a detailed
2:36:2168:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:set of proxies for inventors' counterfactual incomes in each possible destination country including,
2:37:2268:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:among others, measures of patent quality and technological fit with each potential destination. Exploiting
2:38:2374:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:the differential impact of changes in the top tax rate on inventors of different qualities, we find that
2:39:2478:14:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:superstar top 1% inventors are significantly affected by top tax rates when deciding where to locate.
2:40:2579:14:14:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:The elasticity to the net-of-tax rate of the number of domestic superstar inventors is relatively small,
2:41:2683:14:14:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:around 0.03, while the elasticity of the number of foreign superstar inventors is around 1. Inventors
2:42:2784:14:14:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:who work in multinational companies are more likely to take advantage of tax differentials. On the
2:43:2882:14:14:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:other hand, if the company of an inventor has a higher share of its research activity in a given country,
2:44:2987:14:42:72:351:420:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:the inventor is less sensitive to the tax rate in that country.

3:66:3440:0:28:72:185:701:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:1    Introduction
3:67:3457:28:16:72:540:673:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, and created the Bell Telephone Company
3:68:3550:16:17:72:540:657:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:one year later.  By 1886, more than 150,000 people in the United States owned telephones.  In 1916,
3:69:3649:17:16:72:540:640:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:James L. Kraft patented a pasteurization technique for cheese and established his company, Kraft
3:70:3745:16:16:72:540:624:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Foods Inc., that would grow into a conglomerate responsible for creating some of the United States’
3:71:3844:16:17:72:540:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:most popular food products and employing more than 100,000 people.  In 1968, Ralph Baer created
3:72:3939:17:16:72:540:591:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a TV game unit that allowed players to control on-screen action with paddle controls.  Today, the
3:73:4036:16:17:72:540:575:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:video gaming industry is worth $66 billion.  In the early 1970s, Michael Ter-Pogossian developed
3:74:4132:17:16:72:540:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the positron emission tomography (PET) scanner, used today in countless medical examinations.
3:75:4225:16:17:72:540:542:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In the mid-1970s, Samar Basu, through a series of patents, invented the technology that allowed
3:76:4320:17:16:72:540:525:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the lithium ion batteries used in innumerable consumer products to be recharged multiple times.
3:77:4415:16:16:72:540:509:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In 1981, Charles Simonyi started developing some of Microsoft Office’s most profitable products.
3:78:4511:16:17:72:540:493:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In addition to being very prolific inventors, these innovators had something else in common:  they
3:79:4609:17:17:72:168:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:were allimmigrants.
3:80:4628:17:16:88:539:459:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:According to World Intellectual Property Organization data, inventors are highly mobile geo-
3:81:4720:16:17:72:540:443:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:graphically with a migration rate around 8%.1But what determines their patterns of migration?
3:82:4813:17:16:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In particular, how does tax policy affect migration?  The fear of a “brain drain” and the exodus of
3:83:4912:16:17:72:540:410:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:economically valuable agents in response to higher taxation has led to a vivid public debate regard-
3:84:5012:17:16:72:540:393:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ing the taxation of high income people.  For instance, in response to the New York Times’ (Feb,
3:85:5107:16:16:72:540:377:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:2013) article entitled “The Myth of the Rich Who Flee From Taxes,”2following Gerard Depardieu’s
3:86:5202:16:17:72:540:361:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Russian exodus for tax purposes,  Forbes issued an article entitled “Sorry New York Times,  Tax
3:87:5297:17:16:72:539:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Flight of the Rich Is Not a Myth.”3In this paper, we study the effects of top income taxes on the
3:88:5394:16:17:72:465:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:international migration of inventors, who are key drivers of technological progress.
3:89:5478:17:17:88:539:311:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:While an important issue, international migration responses to taxation have remained under-
3:90:5570:17:16:72:540:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:explored due to the lack of a large-scale international panel dataset.  One important exception is
3:91:5668:16:16:72:540:278:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the  study  of  the  migration  responses  of  football  players,  a  set  of  economic  agents  very  different
3:92:5780:16:17:72:540:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:from inventors, byKleven, Landais, and Saez (2013).  In our analysis, we use a unique international
3:93:5879:17:16:72:540:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:panel data on all inventors from the U.S. and European patent offices in an unusual way, namely to
3:94:5977:16:17:72:540:229:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:track the international location of inventors since the 1970s.  The benchmark data is a panel data
3:95:6075:17:16:72:539:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:from the Disambiguated Inventor Data byLaiet al.(2012), based on inventors who patent with
3:96:6165:16:17:72:540:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the United States Patent Office (USPTO). The focus is on the 8 OECD countries that represent
3:97:6257:17:16:72:540:179:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the bulk of USPTO patents for the period 1977-2000:  Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain,
3:98:6349:16:16:72:540:163:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Italy, Japan, Switzerland, and the United States.  The new disambiguated European inventor data
3:99:6444:16:17:72:540:147:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is fromCoffano and Tarasconi(2014).  The U.S. and European patent offices together account for
3:100:6538:17:17:72:540:130:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a  very  large  fraction  of  worldwide  patents,  so  that  our  sample  contains  most  of  the  universe  of
3:101:6649:17:15:84:540:113:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:F:1For a recent study using this data, seeMiguelez and Fink(2013).  High skilled workers are in general more mobile
3:102:6762:15:7:71:407:98:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:that low skilled workers, with inventors being among most high-skilled immigrants.

4:130:8132:11:11:72:540:271:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:Patent Office data 1977-2000 from 8 countries:  Canada, Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Switzerland,
4:131:8246:11:11:72:540:260:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:and the United States.  For the sake of visual clarity, the x-axis is truncated at 600 citations.  For a detailed description

4:133:8399:21:16:88:539:228:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:There are three major challenges that arise when studying the migration responses to taxation.
4:134:8493:16:16:72:540:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:These  challenges  come  in  addition  to  the  aforementioned  usual  obstacle  of  lack  of  international
4:135:8601:16:17:72:540:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:panel data – a hurdle we are able to resolve in this paper thanks to the use of the patent data.
4:136:8697:17:16:72:540:179:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:First, conceptually, migration decisions should depend on thecounterfactualincome that an agent
4:137:8792:16:17:72:540:163:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:expects to receive in each potential location, which is naturally not observed.  Second, migration
4:138:8890:17:16:72:540:146:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:decisions should depend on the counterfactual average tax rate that the agent expects to pay in each
4:139:8990:16:17:72:540:130:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:potential location, which itself depends on the (unknown) counterfactual income earned.  Finally,
4:140:9087:17:16:72:488:113:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:average tax rates may be endogenous to other factors in a country and in a given year.
4:141:9173:16:17:88:539:97:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Our  strategy  to  study  mobility  proceeds  in  three  steps  in  order  to  address  these  three  chal-
4:142:9280:17:0:84:380:80:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:A:4See Section 2.3for references to the literature studying patent citations.
5:143:9408:0:16:72:540:701:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:lenges, making use of some unique features of the patent data.  First, we construct detailed proxies
5:144:9508:16:17:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for inventors’ counterfactual earnings in each potential destination country, which include, among
5:145:9606:17:16:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:others, measures of inventors’ qualities.  Indeed, the patent data provides us with a rare opportu-
5:146:9705:16:16:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:nity to directly measure inventor productivity and quality.  Our benchmark measure of quality is
5:147:9801:16:17:72:540:636:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:citations-adjusted patents, but we also consider the number of patents, average citations per patent,
5:148:9902:17:16:72:540:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the maximum citations per patent, as well as measures of the breadth of patents and breadth of
5:149:9996:16:17:72:540:603:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:impact of an inventor.5We focus on inventors who are employees of companies and, hence, not the
5:150:10091:17:17:71:184:586:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:owners of their patents.
5:151:10115:17:17:88:539:569:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The  quality  measures  based  on  citations,  are  important  determinants  of  inventors’  incomes,
5:152:10216:17:16:71:539:552:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:directly and indirectly.  Directly, more citations mean a higher economic value of the patent (Tra-
5:153:10315:16:17:71:539:536:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:jtenberg, 1990) and companies would typically reward inventors through bonuses or “fair-share”
5:154:10409:17:16:71:539:519:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:agreements.  Indirectly, employers should try to promote and retain their star employees, as char-
5:155:10507:16:16:71:539:503:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:acterized by high patent qualities (see also the papers reviewed in Section2.4which document the
5:156:10603:16:18:71:275:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:link between patent citations and income).
5:157:10645:18:16:88:539:469:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In addition to inventor quality, we also proxy for counterfactual earnings through a variety of
5:158:10740:16:17:71:539:453:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:variables, such as inventors’ technological field, their technological fit with each potential destina-
5:159:10843:17:16:71:539:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tion country, their tenure, and ability-technological field-country specific trends.  We also exploit
5:160:10944:16:17:71:539:420:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:information about what type of institution the inventor works for, notably whether he is employed
5:161:11041:17:16:71:539:403:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:by  a  multinational,  and  the  share  of  the  innovative  activity  of  his  company  performed  in  each
5:162:11149:16:18:71:212:387:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:potential destination country.
5:163:11179:18:16:88:539:369:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Based on our benchmark quality measure (and for each of the other measures), we construct
5:164:11268:16:16:71:539:353:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a corresponding quality distribution, conditional on region of origin and year, and determine the
5:165:11365:16:17:71:540:337:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rank of each inventor in this distribution.6We define superstar inventors as those in the top 1%
5:166:11461:17:16:71:539:320:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the quality distribution, and similarly construct the top 1-5%, the top 5-10%, and subsequent
5:167:11557:16:18:71:150:304:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:quality brackets.
5:168:11574:18:16:88:539:286:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Second, regarding the counterfactual average tax rate, we focus on the elasticity of migration
5:169:11668:16:17:71:539:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to the top marginal income tax rate.  The resulting elasticity is a reduced form parameter and our
5:170:11766:17:16:71:539:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:estimates are not necessarily interpretable as the “elasticities of migration to net-of-tax income,”
5:171:11866:16:17:71:539:237:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for several reasons.  First, top marginal tax rates are not equal to effective top average tax rates
5:172:11966:17:16:71:539:220:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:because of the nonlinearity of the tax system.  This should be a minimal concern in the case of
5:173:12061:16:16:71:539:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:very  high  earners  who  are  well  above  the  top  tax  bracket.   Second,  there  are  other  potentially
5:174:12170:16:21:71:540:188:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:relevant taxes for inventors, such as capital or corporate taxes.7To minimize the latter concern,
5:175:12267:21:14:84:539:167:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:F:5See Section 2.3 for a detailed description of how we construct quality measures for inventors and for alternative
5:176:12381:14:8:72:180:153:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:definitions of “superstars.”
5:177:12409:8:14:84:539:145:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:F:6The  three  benchmark  regions  used  to  construct  the  per  region  and  year  quality  distributions  are  based  on
5:178:12530:14:11:72:540:131:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:comparable patenting intensities.  They are i) the U.S., ii) European countries and Canada, and iii) Japan, but we
5:179:12644:11:7:72:385:120:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:also use per-country rankings for robustness checks (in Appendix TableA16).
5:180:12719:7:15:84:540:113:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:F:7Note however that we are not trying to understand the effects of the taxation ofdirectpatent income (such as
5:181:12828:15:11:72:540:98:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:royalties or corporate income).  We are instead interested in the taxation of salary and bonus earnings,  for which
5:182:12943:11:11:72:540:87:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:personal income taxes are the main consideration.  Appendix TableA14shows that the effect of capital gains taxes
5:183:13055:11:0:72:335:76:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:on migration is insignificant once income taxes are controlled for.
6:184:13157:0:16:72:540:701:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:we restrict our benchmark sample to those inventors who are employees of companies and who are
6:185:13251:16:17:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:not the assignees of the patents – this ensures that personal ordinary income tax should be the
6:186:13346:17:16:72:539:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:main tax affecting decisions.8Furthermore, firms’ decisions and institutional factors (such as the
6:187:13444:16:16:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:visa system) influence the response to taxes.  Incidentally, the estimated elasticity to the top tax
6:188:13544:16:19:72:449:636:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rate may also be interestingper seas it captures the effects of a “success” tax.
6:189:13624:19:16:88:539:617:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Third, turning to the identification, the simplest strategy is to exploit variation in top marginal
6:190:13723:16:17:71:539:601:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tax  rates  across  time  and  countries,  controlling  for  country  fixed  effects,  year  fixed  effects,  and
6:191:13836:17:16:71:539:584:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:country  specific  linear  trends  to  filter  out  longer-term  country-specific  evolutions  in  innovation,
6:192:13946:16:17:71:539:568:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:incomes, and migration.  We do this analysis merely as a first pass as there may be other factors
6:193:14043:17:16:71:539:551:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:correlated with top marginal tax rates which vary at the same time in a given country.  Instead,
6:194:14139:16:16:71:539:535:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:our preferred identification filters out all country-year level variation and exploits the differential
6:195:14242:16:17:71:539:519:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:impact of changes in the top marginal tax rate on top superstar inventors and slightly lower quality
6:196:14342:17:16:71:539:502:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:inventors within a given country and year.  Top 1% inventors and those of slightly lower qualities are
6:197:14444:16:17:71:539:486:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:similar enough to be subject to the same country-year level policies and economic effects.  However,
6:198:14544:17:16:71:539:469:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:only inventors who are actually in the top bracket are directly affected by the changes in top tax
6:199:14642:16:17:71:539:453:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rates.   The  evidence  presented  suggests  that  top  1%  superstar  inventors  are  well  in  the  top  tax
6:200:14752:17:16:71:539:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:bracket.  While the top 1-5% are still very likely to be in the top bracket, the likelihood of being
6:201:14852:16:16:71:539:420:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the top tax bracket declines sharply as we move down through the top 5-10% to the top 10-25%
6:202:14947:16:17:71:539:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:or below top 25% inventors.9Hence, the lower quality, top 5-10%, top 10-25%, and below top 25%
6:203:15041:17:18:72:331:387:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:groups serve as control groups for the top 1% group.10
6:204:15095:18:17:88:539:369:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We perform the analysis at three, successively more detailed levels.  We start by documenting
6:205:15188:17:16:72:540:352:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:some stylized macroeconomic facts about the relation between mobility and top tax rates.  Since
6:206:15283:16:17:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the  1970s  there  is  a  negative  correlation  between  the  top  tax  rate  and  the  share  of  top  quality
6:207:15395:17:16:72:540:319:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:foreign inventors who locate in a country,  as well as the share of top quality domestic inventors
6:208:15493:16:19:72:238:303:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:who remain in their home country.
6:209:15526:19:16:88:539:284:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Delving  deeper  into  three  specific  case  studies,  we  exploit  the  quasi-experimental  variation
6:210:15629:16:24:72:540:268:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:provided  by  migration  or  tax  reforms.   First,  we  consider  the  special  case  of  Russian  inventors–
6:211:15739:24:11:84:530:244:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:A:8We also check that our results hold for the full sample which includes non-employees in Appendix Table A16.
6:212:15847:11:15:84:539:233:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:F:9As explained in Section 5.1, “below top 25%” refers here to a relatively high quality group of inventors who at
6:213:15959:15:7:72:420:218:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:some point have been or will be in the top 25%, but are not currently in the top 25%.
6:214:16044:7:15:80:539:211:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:F:10Conceptually,  this  main  identification  strategy  is  akin  to  a  “fuzzy  regression  discontinuity  design,”  where  the
6:215:16171:15:11:72:540:196:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:quality ranking generates a fuzzy threshold above which inventors are “treated” by the top tax rate changes.  The
6:216:16284:11:11:72:540:185:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:design is fuzzy because we do not know counterfactual income and use quality rankings instead. This is similar in spirit
6:217:16404:11:11:72:540:174:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:to papers using the differential impact of tax changes across income tax brackets (Eissa, 1995) or across households
6:218:16520:11:10:72:540:163:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:with different non-labor income and family size (Eissa and Hoynes, 2006) rather than quality brackets like we do.
6:219:16633:10:11:72:540:153:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:It is most closely related to the differential propensities of being “treated,” as inHoynes and Schanzenbach(2009)
6:220:16747:11:11:72:540:142:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:orHoynes and Schanzenbach(2012) who multiply Food Stamp program introduction by propensity to participate
6:221:16852:11:11:71:539:131:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:(proxied by group-level food stamp participation): in our case, we interact the top tax rate with the inventor’s quality
6:222:16972:11:11:71:539:120:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:ranking (which proxies the propensity of being in the top bracket).  When choosing the control group for top 1%

6:224:17203:11:11:71:539:98:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:top 5-10%) and minimizing the control group’s propensity of being treated (i.e., choosing a group further down the
6:225:17317:11:11:71:539:87:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:quality distribution, e.g., the below top 25%).  We therefore report the estimated coefficients for all inventor quality
6:226:17437:11:0:71:414:76:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:groups and the implied elasticities relative to three different choices of control group.
7:227:17579:0:16:72:540:701:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a group whose migration opportunities were severely restricted before the collapse of the Soviet
7:228:17675:16:17:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Union.   We  show  that,  in  accordance  with  our  main  identification  strategy,  top  quality  Russian
7:229:17782:17:16:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:inventors, relative to lower quality Russian inventors, tended to migrate to lower top tax countries
7:230:17882:16:16:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:after  the  Soviet  Union  collapsed.   We  then  exploit  two  large  tax  reforms,  namely  the  U.S.  Tax
7:231:17990:16:18:72:409:636:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:reform Act of 1986 and Denmark’s “Researchers’ Tax” reform of 1992.
7:232:18057:18:17:88:539:618:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, we estimate a full-fledged multinomial location choice model to obtain the micro elas-
7:233:18152:17:16:72:540:601:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ticities to top tax rates for foreign and domestic inventors.  We use the two identification strategies
7:234:18255:16:17:72:540:585:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:previously described exploiting, first, country-by-year variation in top tax rates and, second, the
7:235:18354:17:18:72:443:568:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:differential effective impact of top tax rates on inventors of different qualities.
7:236:18437:18:16:88:539:550:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We find that the superstar top 1% inventors are significantly affected by top tax rates when
7:237:18529:16:17:72:540:534:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:choosing where to locate.  As explained in the text, we provide the effects relative to several possible
7:238:18633:17:16:72:540:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:control groups for the top 1% inventors.  At the lower end, using the top 5-10% as a control group
7:239:18731:16:17:72:540:501:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:yields an elasticity of the number of domestic superstar top 1% inventors to the net-of-tax rate of
7:240:18830:17:16:72:540:484:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:0.02, which, as explained below, may be a lower bound.  Using the top 10-25% or the below top 25%
7:241:18927:16:16:72:540:468:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:as control groups yields elasticities of, respectively, 0.02 and 0.03.  On the other hand, the elasticity
7:242:19032:16:17:72:540:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of  the  number  of  foreign  top  1%  superstar  inventors  to  the  net-of-tax  rate  is  much  larger,  with
7:243:19143:17:16:72:540:435:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:corresponding values of 0.63, 0.84, and 1.  To put these numbers into perspective, the elasticity of
7:244:19243:16:17:72:540:419:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the number of domestic football players inKleven, Landais, and Saez (2013)to the net-of-tax rate
7:245:19339:17:16:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ranges from 0.07 to 0.16 depending on the specification, and the elasticity of the number of foreign
7:246:19439:16:17:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:players ranges from 0.6 to 1.3.  We also find some evidence consistent with sorting by ability and
7:247:19537:17:18:72:227:369:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:general equilibrium wage effects.

7:249:19671:16:17:72:540:335:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:who have worked for multinationals in the previous period are more likely to take advantage of tax
7:250:19769:17:16:72:540:318:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:differentials.  On the contrary,  they are much less sensitive to the tax rate in a given country if
7:251:19869:16:18:72:447:302:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:their company has a significant share of its innovative activity in that country.
7:252:19950:18:17:88:539:284:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We then perform extensive robustness checks on these benchmark results.  First, we consider
7:253:20041:17:16:72:540:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:five  different  measures  of  inventor  quality,  both  static  and  dynamic,  and  alternative  proxies  for
7:254:20151:16:16:72:540:251:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:earnings.  Second, we contrast short-term and long-term mobility in response to taxation.  Third,

7:258:20542:17:16:72:540:185:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:find very similar elasticities of the number of domestic and foreign top 1% superstar inventors to
7:259:20640:16:27:72:307:169:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the net-of-tax rate of, respectively, 0.02 and 0.76.

9:317:25848:24:16:71:539:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Inventors are the authors of innovations.  They can be employees of companies, work for research
9:318:25944:16:17:71:539:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:institutions, or be self-employed “garage inventors.”  Patents protect the intellectual property of the
9:319:26047:17:16:71:539:412:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:innovation.  They are legally granted to an assignee.  The assignee is either an individual (possibly,
9:320:26149:16:17:71:539:396:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:but not necessarily, one of the inventors on a given patent), a national, local, or state government,
9:321:26250:17:16:71:355:379:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:an institute, a hospital or medical institute, or a university.
9:322:26313:16:17:88:539:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Inventors  seem  to  be  more  mobile  than  the  general  population,  which  is  consistent  with  a
9:323:26415:17:16:71:540:346:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:positively documented relation between skill and mobility.  As summarized inMiguelez and Fink
9:324:26508:16:17:71:539:330:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(2013), the global migration rate in 2000 for the population above 25 years old was 1.8%, ranging
9:325:26605:17:16:71:539:313:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:from 1.1% for the unskilled to 5.4% for those with tertiary education.  In our benchmark sample,

9:329:26903:24:17:71:539:223:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:To motivate our empirical analysis, consider the following very simple model of inventor migration.
9:330:27002:17:16:71:539:206:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:There areCcountries, labeled asc∈ {1,...,C}.  The wage of inventoriin countryc′at timetis
9:331:27091:16:16:71:539:190:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:denoted bywic′t.  Let   ̃wic′tdenote the corresponding marginal product.  Indexiallows the marginal
9:332:27190:16:17:71:539:174:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:product to depend on several inventor characteristics, such as his technological class, his age, as
9:333:27289:17:16:71:539:157:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:well as characteristics of the firm or employer he works for.  If the international labor market is
9:334:27388:16:17:71:515:141:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:perfectly competitive, each inventor is paid his marginal product, so that   ̃wic′t=wic′t,∀c′,t,i.
9:335:27486:17:16:88:540:124:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Suppose that in countryc, an inventor with home countryhihas to pay a tax rateτchiton his
9:336:27575:16:21:71:540:108:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:total income at timet.  The tax rate is allowed to depend on the country of origin because foreigners
9:337:27676:21:11:72:539:87:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:migration elasticities (seeCosar, Guner, and Tybout (2010)).  The migration channel could also further bolster recent
9:338:27793:11:0:71:519:76:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:findings that the room for higher tax revenue through more progressive taxes is limited inGuneret al.(2014).
10:339:27936:0:16:72:540:701:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:can sometimes face different tax regimes in different countries.  For instance, U.S. citizens are taxed
10:340:28039:16:18:72:201:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on their worldwide income.
10:341:28065:18:16:88:539:667:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:In addition to the income earned, there is also a net utility benefit denotedμictfrom locating
10:342:28159:16:17:72:539:651:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in countrycat timetfor inventori.  This benefit is person-specific and can include, among others,
10:343:28256:17:16:72:540:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a  home  bias,  technological  strengths  and  characteristics  of  the  country,  language  differences,  or
10:344:28365:16:16:72:540:618:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:distance to the home country.  It can also capture country-specific characteristics of the company
10:345:28463:16:17:72:540:602:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the inventor works for, such as the share of innovative activities the company performs in country
10:346:28561:17:18:72:167:585:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f3:B:cat any given time.
10:347:28580:18:34:88:435:567:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Total utility from choosing countrycat timetfor inventoriis given by:

10:365:28948:18:16:88:539:457:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:This dispenses us from having to make potentially unrealistic assumptions about the expecta-
10:366:29040:16:16:72:540:441:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tions of future tax rates, on which there is little empirical evidence and which could be country-
10:367:29138:16:17:72:540:425:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:specific.  Note that for any two countries, none of which is the home country of the inventor, the
10:368:29236:17:16:72:540:408:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:utility  from  living  in  one  of  these  countries  does  not  depend  on  the  other  country  –  this  is  the
10:369:29350:16:17:72:540:392:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sense  in  which  there  are  no  adjustment  costs.   However,  the  utility  from  living  in  any  country
10:370:29459:17:16:72:540:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:does depend on the home country, for instance, through a home bias, geographical distance to or
10:371:29554:16:17:72:540:359:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:language differences with the home country (which are the factors we control for in the estimation).
10:372:29654:17:16:72:540:342:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In that sense, the home country plays a special role because it enters as a time-invariant individual
10:373:29755:16:18:72:235:326:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:characteristic through the indexi.
10:374:29789:18:16:88:539:308:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The model highlights that, conceptually, it is the average tax that should matter for the supply
10:375:29885:16:17:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of inventors in a country.  The probability that inventorilocates in countrycwill normally depend
10:376:29982:17:16:72:539:275:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on the full vector of tax rates in all countries, (τ1hit,...,τchit,....,τChit).  However, for the empirical
10:377:30089:16:16:72:540:259:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:analysis,  we  make  the  assumption  that  the  tax  rate  of  any  other  country  only  has  a  negligible
10:378:30198:16:17:72:539:243:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:impact on the supply of inventors in countryc.  This is a good approximation if there are many
10:379:30292:17:16:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:possible origin and destination countries and each is relatively small.  Hence, to a first order, the
10:380:30393:16:17:72:540:210:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:probability  that  inventors  from  countryklocate  in  countrycwill  depend  only  onτcktand  the
10:381:30491:17:17:72:223:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:relationship should be negative.
10:382:30523:17:17:88:539:176:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Note that the personal location preferences captured byμcould be so strong that they com-
10:383:30612:17:16:72:540:159:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:pletely  dominate  any  considerations  of  tax  differences.   As  a  result,  strong  location  preferences
10:384:30721:16:17:72:540:143:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:unrelated to net income will reduce the observed sensitivity to tax rates.  In the empirical analysis,
10:385:30823:17:16:72:540:126:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:we will explore such factors related to the type of job and company the inventor works in, in addition
10:386:30925:16:18:72:510:110:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to the standard factors such as home bias, language differences, and geographical distances.
10:387:31017:18:16:88:539:92:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:If the labor market for inventors is not perfectly flexible,  and employers instead have a rigid
10:388:31113:16:0:72:540:76:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:demand for inventors, the wage need not be equal to the marginal product and may be a function
11:389:31260:0:16:72:540:701:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the tax system.  This type of general equilibrium effects can be one of the potential reasons for
11:390:31360:16:37:72:437:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:endogeneity of top tax rates.  We return to this issue in Sections 5.1 and5.2.

11:392:31462:25:16:72:539:623:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Our main data source is the Disambiguated Inventor Data (hereafter, DID) byLaiet al.(2012),
11:393:31553:16:17:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:which  identifies  unique  inventors  in  the  U.S.  Patent  Office  (USPTO)  data.   The  USPTO  data
11:394:31655:17:16:72:540:590:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:contains  4.2  million  granted  patents  and  3.1  million  inventors  for  the  period  1975-2010,  which
11:395:31762:16:17:72:426:574:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:represents 18% of worldwide direct patent filings and 26% of all patents.15
11:396:31837:17:17:88:539:557:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We limit the sample to the 8 major countries which account for 89% of all patents granted by

11:399:32125:17:16:72:540:507:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for 1.3%.  These representation differences reflect the different propensities that countries have for
11:400:32227:16:17:72:540:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:filing a patent with the USPTO: 58% of U.S. patent filings, 48% of Canadian filings, 19% of British
11:401:32326:17:16:72:540:474:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:filings, 16% of German filings, 20% of Italian filings, 13% of Japanese filings, 17% of French filings,
11:402:32429:16:17:72:324:458:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:and 12% of Swiss filings are filed with the USPTO.17
11:403:32481:17:17:88:539:441:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:But  filing  propensities  and  representation  in  the  patent  data  are  not  necessarily  correlated
11:404:32585:17:16:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:with migration propensities.  Indeed, while it is true that the largest migration corridors are the
11:405:32684:16:17:72:540:408:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Great Britain-U.S. and Canada-U.S. corridors,  other migration corridors such as the Japan-U.S.
11:406:32779:17:16:72:540:391:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and Switzerland-U.S. ones are very small, although these countries have a high propensity of filing
11:407:32878:16:17:72:165:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:patents in the U.S..
11:408:32898:17:17:88:539:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The DID contains inventors’ disambiguated names and residential address, which allows us to
11:409:32989:17:16:72:540:341:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:track the location of the inventor over time.  Each of the inventor’s patents has a patent number,
11:410:33087:16:16:72:540:325:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:application year, grant year, and assignee name.  In addition, to get information on each patent’s
11:411:33185:16:17:72:540:309:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:characteristics, such as citations or technological class, we merge the inventor data to the NBER
11:412:33282:17:16:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:patent data. Because of the truncation issue for patents’ citations (more recent patents mechanically
11:413:33383:16:17:72:540:276:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:have less time to accumulate citations), we limit the sample to the years 1977-2000. Table1 provides
11:414:33483:17:17:72:295:259:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:some summary statistics for the inventor data.

12:455:35926:14:14:72:540:306:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:Notes:  Summary statistics are based on inventor and patents data set described in Section2.3for the period 1977-
12:456:36039:14:11:72:540:292:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:2000.  The data includes inventors in 8 countries: Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, Switzerland,
12:457:36156:11:11:72:540:281:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:and the United States.  The sample contains 4,154,792 observations with 1,868,967 unique inventors.  The benchmark
12:458:36270:11:37:72:381:270:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:estimation sample contains all inventors who have ever been in the top 25%.
12:459:36345:37:17:72:539:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:alternative data source on inventors’ locations.  This dataset is described in detail byMiguelez and
12:460:36445:17:16:72:540:216:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Fink(2013) and extracted from patent applications that are filed under the Patent Cooperation
12:461:36538:16:17:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Treaty (PCT), a treaty administered by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) that
12:462:36633:17:16:72:540:183:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:offers some advantages for seeking international patent protection.  The PCT data contains 54% of
12:463:36730:16:16:72:540:167:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:all international patent applications, but accounts for only 8% of worldwide patent filings.  However,
12:464:36832:16:17:72:540:151:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:there has been no inventor name disambiguation and it is not yet possible to track inventors by
12:465:36927:17:16:72:540:134:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:name over time in a panel.  As a result, we cannot construct dynamic quality measures for inventors
12:466:37026:16:17:72:540:118:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:as will be described below.  The migration counts could be somewhat biased as, for instance, every
12:467:37124:17:16:72:540:101:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:inventor could be counted several times as a migrant.  However, the great advantage of this dataset
12:468:37223:16:0:72:540:85:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is that it contains nationality information.  In addition, many smaller countries which are essentially
13:469:37380:0:16:72:540:701:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:non-existent in the DID are better represented in the PCT data, which allows us to provide results
13:470:37478:16:17:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for a larger set of countries than our benchmark 8 countries.  Thus, this data serves as a robustness
13:471:37579:17:16:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:check on the results using our benchmark data, while also providing an independent and different
13:472:37675:16:31:72:176:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:angle for the analysis.

13:474:37791:17:16:71:540:604:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:as measures of the economic and technological significance of a patent (seePakes(1986),Pakes and

13:477:38072:16:17:71:539:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:construct four different dynamic measures of the inventor’s quality, which place different importance
13:478:38173:17:16:71:540:538:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on the quantity versus value of an inventor’s patents.  Letpijbe the number of truncation-adjusted

13:480:38369:16:17:71:539:506:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:counts all the forward citations that patent will ever receive, not the citations received until time
13:481:38470:17:16:71:539:489:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f3:B:t.   The  truncation  adjustment,  which  takes  into  account  the  fact  that  more  recent  patents  have
13:482:38578:16:17:71:539:473:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:less time to accumulate citations, is described inHall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg (2001).  LetPit−1be
13:483:38676:17:16:71:540:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the set of patents of inventoriby the end of periodt−1.  Our benchmark measure is the lagged

13:492:39095:16:30:71:299:339:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the lagged patent count of the inventor namely:

13:494:39157:30:16:71:540:279:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:where|Pit−1|is the cardinality of the setPit−1.  This measure ignores the quality of patents and
13:495:39253:16:17:71:539:263:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:purely focuses on their quantity and is hence not our preferred measure.18The third measure,q3it,
13:496:39350:17:35:71:313:246:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is the lagged mean number of citations per patent:

13:503:39523:17:30:71:409:159:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is the max number of citations ever received on a patent by inventori:

13:508:39728:15:0:72:194:76:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:Akcigit, and Popadak (2013)).

14:510:39898:16:17:72:539:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:invention.  The additional results for our non-benchmark measuresq2,q3, andq4 are in Section6.
14:511:39992:17:16:88:539:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Based on these quality measures, we can define a ranking for inventors and, in particular, identify
14:512:40091:16:16:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:“superstar” inventors.  We could in principle use a worldwide ranking of inventors.  However, the
14:513:40188:16:17:72:540:636:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:patenting intensity is quite different for different countries and thus the quality measures are not
14:514:40288:17:16:72:540:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:necessarily  directly  comparable  at  a  global  level.   This  is  why  we  group  our  8  countries  into  3
14:515:40399:16:17:72:540:603:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:regions based on comparable patenting intensity:  1) the U.S., 2) Japan, 3) European countries and
14:516:40497:17:16:72:540:586:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Canada.  The U.S. and Japan stand out as the biggest patenting countries with 55% and 26% of all
14:517:40593:16:17:72:539:570:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:granted patents in the sample period (1977-2000).19We assign each inventor to a region based on
14:518:40688:17:16:72:540:553:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:whether his “home” country is in that region.  Since we do not observe actual nationality in this
14:519:40785:16:16:72:540:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:data, we call home country the country in which the inventor is first observed in our sample.  We
14:520:40882:16:17:72:540:521:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:define superstars at timetas those in top 1% of the regional quality distribution at timet.The
14:521:40976:17:16:72:540:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:top 5%,  top 10%,  and top 25% are calculated in a similar way.  These are dynamic measures in
14:522:41070:16:17:72:540:488:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the sense that they can change over an inventor’s life, depending on where he falls in the regional
14:523:41169:17:16:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:distribution of quality in any given year.20Henceforth, we use the notation “top 1-5%” to denote
14:524:41265:16:17:72:540:455:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:inventors who are in the top 5% excluding the top 1%, and, similarly the top 5-10% and top 10-25%
14:525:41362:17:16:72:540:438:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to respectively denote inventors in the top 10% excluding the top 5%, and in the top 25%, excluding
14:526:41461:16:16:72:540:422:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the top 10%.  Whenever we write “below top 25%” we refer to the inventors who have been or will
14:527:41556:16:32:72:442:406:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:be in the top 25% during their lifetime, but are not currently in the top 25%.

14:530:41786:17:16:72:540:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in each potential destination, measuring the counterfactual tax rate, and finding exogenous variation
14:531:41887:16:21:72:358:318:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the tax rate.  Accordingly, we take a three step approach.
14:532:41948:21:17:72:540:297:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f3:B:Step 1: Proxying for counterfactual earnings.Our model highlighted that migration decisions
14:533:42039:17:16:72:540:280:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:should conceptually depend on the income an inventor expects to earn in each potential destination,
14:534:42138:16:17:72:311:264:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:which is a counterfactual, unobservable variable.21
14:535:42189:17:16:88:539:247:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Fortunately,  the patent data gives us a rich set of measures that can proxy for an inventor’s
14:536:42283:16:16:72:540:231:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:counterfactual earnings.  Among them are the previously described quality measures,q1−q4, in
14:537:42375:16:17:71:539:215:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:formulas (1)-(4).  Patent quality to date is a composite, dynamic statistic that takes into account an
14:538:42477:17:16:71:539:198:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:inventor’s past achievements.  In that sense, it is a measure of inventor ability or earnings potential,
14:539:42581:16:17:71:277:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and a reflection of the inventor’s “resume.”

14:541:42721:16:15:71:539:149:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:way.  First, there are direct rewards and bonuses for specific innovations, driven potentially by legal
14:542:42824:15:14:80:539:134:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:F:19The other countries each account from 1.16% to 8.85% of patents.  Furthermore, the mean number of patents per
14:543:42935:14:7:72:435:120:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:inventor in the U.S., Japan and the rest of the countries is, respectively, 3.95, 4.7 and 3.3.
14:544:43029:7:15:80:539:113:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:F:20As  a  check,  we  also  defined  the  reference  distribution  and  ranking  separately  for  each  country,  instead  of  by
14:545:43157:15:7:72:360:98:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:region, and the results, available on demand, were virtually unchanged.
14:546:43228:7:15:80:539:91:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:F:21Grogger  and  Hanson  (2015)  show  that  high  ability  immigrants  are  more  likely  to  stay  where  there  is  a  high
14:547:43353:15:0:72:440:76:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:premium for high skill workers.  Hence, proxying well for the counterfactual wage is crucial.
15:548:43500:0:16:72:540:701:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:or contractual arrangements, such as “fair share” agreements in many countries.22These rewards
15:549:43594:16:17:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:depend on the value of the patent to the company, and patent citations are a clear marker for the
15:550:43691:17:18:72:377:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:economic value of patents (Trajtenberg,1990;Hall et al.,2001).
15:551:43753:18:16:88:539:650:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Second, and most relevant for our purposes, there can be indirect compensation for an inventor’s
15:552:43849:16:17:71:539:634:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ability. An employer could pay a higher salary or promote star innovators, with a stellar track record
15:553:43951:17:16:71:539:617:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of patent quality,  in order to both attract and retain crucial talent with the best patenting and
15:554:44049:16:17:71:539:601:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:innovation ability (Chesbrough,2006).23For a lot of companies, patent licensing is also a major
15:555:44144:17:16:72:540:584:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:source of revenues, justifying the need to hire the best innovators.  For instance, IBM collects more
15:556:44245:16:17:72:540:568:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:than $1 billion in licensing revenues (Ryder and Madhavan,2014).  The importance of “stars,” who
15:557:44341:17:16:72:540:551:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:play a crucial role in the formation or transformation of many industries, has been emphasized by
15:558:44438:16:16:72:539:535:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Zucker and Darby(2014).  Note that we are not just trying to measure the income flow from any
15:559:44531:16:17:72:540:519:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:given patent but rather to proxy for an inventor’s full earnings using quality measures based on his
15:560:44631:17:28:72:110:502:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:patents.
15:561:44639:28:17:72:539:474:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f3:B:Link  between  income  and  citations:  Whether  it  arises  from  the  direct  or  indirect  channel,
15:562:44741:17:16:72:540:457:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:there  appears  to  be  a  strong  link  between  the  value  and  quality  of  patents  and  the  inventor’s
15:563:44850:16:16:72:540:441:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:income.  The distribution of rewards for patents seems to be highly skewed towards high quality
15:564:44945:16:17:72:539:425:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:inventors.Toivanen and V ̈a ̈an ̈anen(2012) find that Finnish inventors receive a temporary reward
15:565:45043:17:16:71:539:408:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:equal to 3% of earnings for any patent grant.  This hides important heterogeneities based on patent
15:566:45142:16:17:71:539:392:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:quality:  moderately cited patents (with 20 to 30 citations) generate a premium of around 20% in
15:567:45238:17:16:71:539:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:annual earnings, while highly cited patents receive an earnings premium of 30% three years after
15:568:45334:16:17:71:540:359:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the grant.Harhoff and Hoisl(2007) use data for Germany, where the employer has the right to
15:569:45425:17:16:71:539:342:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:claim the invention and, if he does, needs to reasonably compensate the employee in proportion to
15:570:45522:16:17:71:539:326:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the value of the invention.  They also find that the share of the salary received as a compensation
15:571:45621:17:16:71:539:309:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for an invention is highly skewed with a few top inventions doubling the inventor’s salary.  Top 5%
15:572:45720:16:16:71:539:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:inventors receive a 20-50% increase in their salary per invention.  Similarly, as a compensation for
15:573:45820:16:17:71:539:277:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:all inventions, the top inventors’ salaries can be multiplied by a factor of 5.Giuriet al.(2007)find
15:574:45920:17:16:71:539:260:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the PatVal European inventors survey that 42% of inventors receive a monetary award for their
15:575:46016:16:17:71:539:244:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:patents, and that for 4% of the respondents, these monetary rewards are permanent.  In Swedish
15:576:46110:17:16:71:539:227:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:administrative data, numbers provided to us by Olof Ejermo show that the most cited inventors
15:577:46203:16:17:71:539:211:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:earn 60% more than the less cited ones.Bellet al.(2015)find using administrative data covering

15:579:46393:16:16:71:539:178:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:towards  superstar inventors with  many  citations.  In their  data,  the  mean income at  ages 40-50
15:580:46494:16:17:71:539:162:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is close to $700,000 for inventors with 300 citations, and around $350,000 for inventors with 100
15:581:46591:17:22:71:115:145:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:citations.
15:582:46601:22:14:80:539:123:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:F:22From our own calculations and reading of the legal rules, 14% of patents in our data come from legislations where
15:583:46716:14:11:72:540:109:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:by law the employer owns the patent, 30% come from legislations where the employee owns the patents, and the rest
15:584:46829:11:7:72:401:98:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:come from legislations where ownership is determined by contractual agreements.
15:585:46908:7:15:80:539:91:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:F:23Chesbrough (2006) states that “R&D managers often use the number of patents generated (...)  as a metric to
15:586:47017:15:0:72:305:76:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:judge the productivity of (...)  [a] person or organization.”
16:587:47114:0:16:88:539:701:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:As described in detail in Section5.1, we will allow the ability of the inventor to be rewarded
16:588:47208:16:17:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:differently in different countries and we will introduce ability and country specific trends in com-
16:589:47308:17:16:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:pensation.   Additional  characteristics  used  to  control  for  the  counterfactual  wage  are  described
16:590:47415:16:16:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:there as well (such as quality measures,  technological field,  goodness of fit with the destination,
16:591:47516:16:24:72:425:636:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tenure/experience, ability-technological-field-country-specific trends, etc.).
16:592:47594:24:16:72:540:612:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f3:B:Step 2:  Using the effective top marginal tax rate.We use the effective top marginal tax
16:593:47682:16:16:72:540:596:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rate as our tax measure.24The estimate obtained is not necessarily interpretable as “the migration
16:594:47780:16:17:72:540:580:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:elasticity to net-of-tax income” for several reasons.  First, the average tax rate is not equal to the
16:595:47882:17:16:72:540:563:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:marginal tax rate because the tax system is not linear.  Nevertheless,  the top marginal tax rate
16:596:47979:16:17:72:539:547:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is likely a good approximation to the average tax rate for top earners.25In addition, conditional
16:597:48076:17:16:72:540:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on being in the top tax bracket, the top tax rate is exogenous to earnings, unlike the average tax
16:598:48174:16:17:72:539:514:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rate.  The estimate is also interestingper sesince the top marginal tax rate can also be viewed as
16:599:48272:17:16:72:148:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a “success tax.”
16:600:48288:16:17:88:539:481:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Second, the estimated response will combine firm and worker responses (more on this in Section
16:601:48382:17:16:72:540:464:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:5.4) and will be a function of institutional features (e.g., visa regulations, as illustrated starkly for
16:602:48487:16:17:72:540:448:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the  case  of  Russian  inventors  in  Section4.1),  both  of  which  prevent  an  easy  mapping  from  the
16:603:48594:17:16:72:303:431:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:reduced form estimates to behavioral primitives.
16:604:48642:16:17:88:539:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, there are other taxes which may influence migration decision, such as corporate taxes
16:605:48736:17:16:72:540:398:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:or  capital  gains  taxes.   However,  we  limit  the  sample  to  inventors  who  are  employees  and  who
16:606:48843:16:17:72:540:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:hence  receive  the  bulk  of  their  income  as  ordinary  personal  income.   These  inventors  innovate
16:607:48949:17:16:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:within companies and, typically, their employers are the owners of the patents obtained.  To a first
16:608:49049:16:17:72:540:349:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:order, this allows us to abstract from other forms of taxation such as capital taxation, corporate
16:609:49147:17:16:72:540:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:taxation, or royalties’ taxation, and instead focus on personal income taxation.  We do control for
16:610:49246:16:16:72:539:316:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:capital gains and corporate taxes in Appendix TableA14and check our results on the full sample,
16:611:49341:16:17:72:306:300:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:including non-employees in Appendix TableA16.
16:612:49386:17:17:88:539:283:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:There  are  certainly  some  complications  with  foreign  tax  rules  and  regimes  across  different
16:613:49488:17:16:71:539:266:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:countries,  which we are not able to account for given our data.  For instance,  an inventor living
16:614:49587:16:16:71:539:250:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:temporarily in the UK but domiciled abroad can choose to some extent how to be taxed on his
16:615:49678:16:17:71:539:234:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:income  earned  abroad  (on  an  “arising  basis”  or  on  a  “remittance  basis”).   Depending  on  the
16:616:49782:17:16:71:539:217:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:inventor’s (unobservable) legal arrangements and future plans, this might lead to somewhat different
16:617:49882:16:17:71:539:201:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:effective marginal tax rates.  In the analysis, we assume that, to a first order, the inventor pays the
16:618:49985:17:17:71:539:184:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:taxes of the country he physically resides in.  The exception is for U.S. inventors who are taxed on
16:619:50085:17:14:80:539:167:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:F:24One way to interpret the obtained elasticity is as a reduced form estimate, where the top marginal tax rate can
16:620:50198:14:11:72:540:153:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:act like an instrument for the top average tax rate.  The implicit “first-stage” is indeed significant:  from our own
16:621:50315:11:11:72:540:142:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:computations,  we  see  that  changes  in  the  top  marginal  tax  rate  are  very  strongly  correlated  with  changes  in  the
16:622:50444:11:8:72:308:131:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:average tax rate on the top 1% of the income distribution.
16:623:50502:8:14:80:539:123:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:F:25Reassuringly, Kleven, Landais, and Saez (2013) show that the elasticities obtained for football players using the
16:624:50617:14:11:72:540:109:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:marginal top tax rate versus actual average tax rates are very similar.  This hinges on the fact that those football
16:625:50733:11:11:72:540:98:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:players  considered  are  well  above  the  top  tax  bracket  in  terms  of  earnings.   In  our  data  we  find  a  very  strong
16:626:50863:11:11:72:540:87:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:correlation between the average tax rate on top earners (evaluated using the tax codes for different countries) and
16:627:50978:11:0:72:177:76:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:the top marginal tax rate.
17:628:51058:0:16:72:194:701:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:their worldwide income.26
17:629:51083:16:17:88:539:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The effective top marginal tax rate is computed including all relevant taxes on labor income:
17:630:51176:17:16:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the  individual  local,  state,  and  national  tax  rates,  the  uncapped  payroll  taxes,  and  value-added
17:631:51285:16:17:72:539:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:taxes.  These series come fromPiketty,  Saez,  and Stantcheva (2014).  For U.S. citizens,  who are
17:632:51383:17:16:72:540:635:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:taxed on worldwide income, a special top tax rate is computed for each possible location choice,
17:633:51479:16:17:72:540:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:taking into account the Foreign Tax Credit formula.27We drop people in the years in which they
17:634:51573:17:16:72:540:602:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are observed in different countries within the same year, as it is not clear what tax rate their yearly
17:635:51676:16:23:72:257:586:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:income was subject to in those years.28

17:637:51806:17:16:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:there have been many,  both small and large,  top tax rate changes in our sample.  The simplest
17:638:51901:16:16:72:540:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:identification  strategy  exploits  these  variations  across  countries  and  time  (i.e.,  country-by-year
17:639:52009:16:17:72:540:514:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:variation) in top marginal tax rates.  In this case, it is still important to control for country fixed
17:640:52112:17:16:72:540:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:effects,  year  fixed  effects,  as  well  as  for  country  specific  linear  trends  to  filter  out  longer-term

17:642:52324:17:16:72:540:464:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a first pass,  as there may be other factors correlated with top marginal tax rates which vary at
17:643:52421:16:17:72:540:448:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the same time in a given country, such as the business friendliness of the environment or research
17:644:52519:17:16:72:540:431:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:stimulating policies.  If there are general equilibrium effects of top taxes at the country-year level,
17:645:52622:16:17:72:386:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:these will also be loaded on the estimated coefficient of top taxes.
17:646:52690:17:16:88:539:398:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Our main and preferred identification instead filters out all variation at the country-year level
17:647:52787:16:17:72:540:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and exploits the differential impact of changes in the top marginal tax rate on the top superstar
17:648:52884:17:16:72:540:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:inventors  and  slightly  lower  quality  inventors.   The  idea  is  that  the  top  1%  inventors  and  those
17:649:52995:16:17:72:540:349:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of slightly lower qualities should be subject to the same country-year level policies and economic
17:650:53093:17:16:72:540:332:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:effects because they are all very high quality inventors.  However, only inventors who are actually
17:651:53192:16:16:72:540:316:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the top bracket are directly affected by the changes in top tax rates.  The evidence presented
17:652:53289:16:17:72:540:300:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:below  suggests  that  top  1%  superstar  inventors  are  well  in  the  top  tax  bracket.   While  the  top
17:653:53399:17:16:72:540:283:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:1-5% are still very likely to be in the top bracket, the likelihood of being in the top tax bracket
17:654:53498:16:17:72:540:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:declines sharply as we move down through the top 5-10% to the top 10-25% or the below top 25%
17:655:53591:17:16:72:138:250:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:of inventors.29
17:656:53606:16:17:88:539:234:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Conceptually, this main identification strategy is akin to a “fuzzy regression discontinuity de-
17:657:53702:17:16:72:540:217:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sign” where the quality ranking generates a fuzzy threshold above which inventors are “treated” by
17:658:53800:16:17:72:540:201:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the top tax rate changes.  The lower quality, top 5-10%, top 10-25%, or below the top 25% groups
17:659:53896:17:17:72:540:184:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:serve as control groups for the top 1%.  The top 1-5% is treated as a buffer group, and not as a
17:660:53992:17:14:80:539:167:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:F:26Incidentally, in Section 6.3, we consider long-term mobility, which potentially allows a clearer equivalence between
17:661:54110:14:11:72:540:153:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:geographical location and tax residency, since it is harder to shift income abroad when residing long-term in a different
17:662:54231:11:8:72:107:142:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:location.
17:663:54240:8:14:80:539:134:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:F:27Given the Foreign Tax Credit rules for U.S. citizens, we set the tax rate for U.S. citizen abroad equal to the U.S.
17:664:54357:14:11:72:540:120:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:tax if and only if the foreign tax rate is smaller than the U.S. tax rate:  this was frequently the case before 1985 for
17:665:54477:11:7:72:369:109:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:the 8 countries under consideration, but not the case anymore after 1985.
17:666:54550:7:11:80:343:102:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:A:28Less than 0.2% of the observations are dropped for this reason.
17:667:54615:11:15:80:540:91:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:F:29As explained in Section5.1, the “below top 25%” group refers to inventors who have been or will be in the top
17:668:54726:15:0:72:427:76:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:25% at some point during their life in the sample, but are not currently in the top 25%.
18:669:54850:0:16:72:461:701:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:good control group, since inventors in this group are too likely to also be treated.
18:670:54934:16:17:88:539:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The discontinuity is fuzzy because tax brackets differ across countries and because we do not
18:671:55027:17:16:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:know counterfactual income and have to instead use quality rankings.  We hence establish in two
18:672:55122:16:17:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:steps, by reference to the literature, that, first, quality is highly positively related to income and
18:673:55224:17:16:72:540:635:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that, second, inventor’s income distributions are such that the top income inventors are in the top
18:674:55323:16:17:72:540:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:bracket (this is done further below).  A useful way to think about this is that the quality groups
18:675:55421:17:16:72:400:602:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:capture the propensity to be “treated” by the top marginal tax rate.
18:676:55489:16:17:88:539:586:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:When choosing the control group, there is a typical trade-off between maximizing comparability
18:677:55583:17:16:72:540:569:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(i.e., choosing a group very close in quality e.g., the top 5-10%) and minimizing the control group’s
18:678:55684:16:17:72:540:553:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:propensity of being treated (i.e., choosing a lower quality group such as the below top 25%).  For
18:679:55782:17:16:72:540:536:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:instance,  the  top  1%  (the  treatment  group)  and  the  top  5-10%  are  likely  extremely  comparable
18:680:55888:16:16:72:540:520:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:groups  along  all  dimensions.   However,  the  top  5-10%  may  still  include  quite  a  few  “treated”
18:681:55994:16:17:72:540:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:inventors  in  the  top  bracket.   In  addition,  inventors  in  the  top  5-10%  may  still  feel  the  indirect
18:682:56108:17:16:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:motivational effect of the “success tax.”  As a result, we may underestimate the “treatment” effect
18:683:56207:16:17:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the top tax rate if comparing only to the top 5-10% group.  We therefore find it useful to show
18:684:56305:17:16:72:540:454:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the estimated coefficients for all inventor groups and to compute the elasticities for different choices
18:685:56409:16:17:72:540:438:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of control group.  We hence include in the regression the full set of interactions of the retention rate
18:686:56513:17:16:72:540:421:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:with indicator variables for being in the top 1%, the top 1-5%, the top 5-10%, the top 10-25%, and
18:687:56611:16:16:72:540:405:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the below top 25%.  To reiterate, this identification allows us to include country-year fixed effects
18:688:56712:16:17:72:482:389:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the estimation in order to filter out other contemporaneous changes in the country.
18:689:56798:17:17:88:539:372:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Our strategy is similar in spirit to that in other studies which exploit the differential impact
18:690:56894:17:16:72:540:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of tax changes across income tax brackets, using lower income brackets as control groups for top
18:691:56990:16:16:72:539:339:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:brackets (Eissa,1995), or across households with different non-labor income and family size (Eissa
18:692:57088:16:17:72:539:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and  Hoynes,2006).   We  are  most  closely  inspired  by  a  strategy  that  captures  the  differential
18:693:57193:17:16:72:540:306:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:propensities of being “treated,” as inHoynes and Schanzenbach(2009) orHoynes and Schanzenbach
18:694:57286:16:17:72:540:290:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(2012) who multiply Food Stamp program introduction by propensity to participate (proxied by
18:695:57378:17:16:72:540:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:group-level food stamp participation):  in our case, we interact the top tax rate with the inventor’s
18:696:57479:16:17:72:540:257:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:quality  ranking  (which  proxies  the  propensity  of  being  in  the  top  bracket).   Note  that  we  are
18:697:57587:17:16:72:540:240:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:unable to compute an actual propensity to be treated as inHoynes and Schanzenbach(2009).  The
18:698:57680:16:16:72:540:224:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:problem for doing this is bigger than just the fact that we do not have data on inventor income
18:699:57775:16:17:72:539:208:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:distributions conditional on quality: we do not knowcounterfactualincome (and there is no dataset
18:700:57872:17:16:72:540:191:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that contains it) and so we would not be able to know the inventor’s actual propensity to be treated
18:701:57972:16:17:72:312:175:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in each potential destination country in each year.
18:702:58023:17:16:88:539:158:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:For this identification, we may worry that changes in top tax rates are correlated with changes
18:703:58118:16:17:72:540:142:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in  the  average  tax  rate  of  the  slightly  lower  quality  groups.   Historically,  this  does  not  seem  to
18:704:58232:17:16:72:540:125:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:have been the case in our setting.  There have overall been 218 top tax rate changes in our sample.
18:705:58331:16:17:72:540:109:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:For  only  7  of  these  have  the  top  marginal  tax  rate  and  the  tax  rate  in  the  bracket  below  both
18:706:58443:17:16:72:540:92:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:increased, and for only 14 have they both decreased.  Note here that we would mostly be worried
18:707:58538:16:0:72:540:76:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:about situations in which the top marginal tax rate and the rate in the bracket below would move
19:708:58688:0:16:72:540:701:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the opposite direction, which is the only case that would lead us to overestimate the effect of
19:709:58786:16:25:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the top MTR with this identification strategy.  Fortunately, this has never occurred in our sample.
19:710:58885:25:17:72:539:660:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f3:B:Inventors’ income distributions:Because of our identification strategy, we need to check that
19:711:58978:17:16:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the top quality inventors are in the top income tax bracket, while the propensity of being in the
19:712:59075:16:17:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:top bracket declines for lower quality inventors.  This is done in two steps.  First,  recall that we
19:713:59176:17:16:72:540:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:established a very significant positive link between citations and income above.  We now focus on
19:714:59273:16:16:72:540:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the income distribution of inventors – keeping this link in mind– to show which percentiles of the
19:715:59371:16:18:72:451:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:inventors’ income distribution are in the top bracket and which ones are below.

19:719:59728:16:16:71:540:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:A more reliable source is the administrative data used inBell et al.(2014) which shows that, in
19:720:59823:16:17:71:539:495:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:terms  of  income,  the  top  1%  inventor  earns  $1.6  million  and  the  top  5%  earns  $500,000.   The
19:721:59930:17:16:71:539:478:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:median inventor earns $114,000 and the mean inventor earns $192,000.  The top 1% highest quality
19:722:60026:16:17:71:539:462:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:inventors  are  hence  quite  likely  to  be  very  high  up  in  the  income  distribution.   The  top  1-5%
19:723:60135:17:16:71:539:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:inventors by quality are still very high up and have a large propensity of being in the top bracket.

20:735:60967:0:16:72:540:701:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of  income  are  clearly  comfortably  in  the  top  income  tax  brackets,  and  the  top  1-5%  or  the  top

20:748:61922:17:16:88:539:416:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Panel A focuses on the fraction of domestic inventors who remain in their home country.  Figure
20:749:62017:16:17:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:4a shows that the decision to remain in the home country is significantly affected by top tax rates,

24:913:72181:21:17:88:539:109:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Next we move beyond correlations and exploit our main identification strategy, which consists
24:914:72274:17:16:71:539:92:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in comparing the effects of the top tax rate on top quality relative to lower quality inventors.  For

25:916:72526:0:16:72:539:701:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:DID with the ethnicity data byKerr(2008), to circumvent the problem of the lack of nationality

25:918:72717:17:16:71:539:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:which inventors have Russian ethnicity.  Hence, there are of course inventors of Russian ethnicity
25:919:72815:16:16:71:460:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:abroad even before 1991 (unlike for the pure nationality measure from the PCT).
25:920:72894:16:17:88:539:636:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We can now exploit the differential impact of the top tax rate on higher versus lower quality
25:921:72987:17:16:71:539:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:inventors.   Low  quality  Russian  inventors  can  here  serve  as  a  control  group  that  shares  similar

25:924:73295:16:17:71:539:570:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:may want to move to specific countries.  Low quality Russian inventors,  however,  should not be

26:967:76966:16:17:72:540:403:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:experimental variation provided by two large tax reforms:  the U.S. Tax Reform Act of 1986 and
26:968:77060:17:16:72:332:386:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Denmark’s 1992 preferential tax scheme for foreigners.
26:969:77114:16:16:88:539:370:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To study the effects of these reforms on inventor migration, we use the synthetic control method
26:970:77210:16:17:72:539:354:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:byAbadie et al.(2010). It consists in building a synthetic control country that is a weighted average
26:971:77311:17:16:72:540:337:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of  other  countries  in  the  sample.   The  weights  are  chosen  to  minimize  the  pre-reform  distance
26:972:77418:16:17:72:540:321:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:between the country under consideration (i.e., U.S. or Denmark) and the synthetic country along
26:973:77513:17:16:72:540:304:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:dimensions of interest.  The synthetic country plausibly represents what would have happened in
26:974:77608:16:17:72:417:288:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the control country absent the reform.  AppendixD provides the details.
26:975:77679:17:16:88:539:271:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:To estimate the elasticities to top tax rates, we regress at the country-year level the log of each
26:976:77778:16:17:72:540:255:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:outcome  variable  on  the  log  retention  rate,  a  dummy  for  the  post-reform  period  and  a  dummy
26:977:77883:17:16:72:540:238:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for country (there are two “countries” here, namely the treated country and the synthetic control
26:978:77980:16:16:72:540:222:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:country),  where the log retention rate is instrumented by the interaction of the country dummy
26:979:78075:16:17:72:243:206:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and the post-reform period dummy.
26:980:78108:17:16:88:540:189:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The U.S. Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced top marginal tax rates from 50% to 28%.33The
26:981:78192:16:17:72:540:173:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:corresponding change in average tax rates was very concentrated at the top of the income distri-
26:982:78288:17:14:80:539:156:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:F:32Note  that  because  Kerr  (2008)  assigns  ethnicity  (not  nationality),  it  is  expected  to  see  some  ethnic  Russian
26:983:78414:14:11:72:540:142:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:inventors  abroad  in  the  Soviet  Union  era.   What  matters  here  is  how  the  elasticity  changed  in  the  post  collapse
26:984:78543:11:11:72:540:131:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:period.  For low bottom 50% Russian inventors, as expected, the correlation between migration and top tax rates did
26:985:78658:11:7:72:228:120:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:not change post-Soviet Union collapse.
26:986:78696:7:15:80:539:113:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:F:33There is still a debate about the extent to which the decrease in marginal tax rates was offset by base broadening,
26:987:78813:15:11:72:540:98:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:which was one of the goals of the reform.Gravelle and Hungerford(2012) argue that the tax base of the individual
26:988:78925:11:11:72:539:87:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:income tax was not widely broadened.Bakija and Steuerle(1991) find an overall modest increase in the tax base of
26:989:79037:11:0:72:94:76:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:3.8%.
27:990:79096:0:16:72:540:701:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:bution.  According to our own calculations, average tax rates decreased by a large 7.6% for the top
27:991:79195:16:17:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:1%, decreased by only 2% for the top 5% of inventors, and actually increased by 0.7% for the top
27:992:79291:17:16:72:223:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:10% of the income distribution.

27:1011:80316:11:11:72:540:323:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:top tax rates in the U.S. In each panel,  the fraction of foreign inventors in the U.S. versus the fraction of foreign
27:1012:80434:11:11:72:540:312:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:inventors in the synthetic control country are depicted.  The weights on countries forming the synthetic country are
27:1013:80550:11:11:72:539:301:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:set to minimize the distance to the U.S. in the pre-reform years (see the text and Appendix Dfor details).  Panel8a
27:1014:80665:11:11:72:539:290:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:shows the number of top 1% foreign inventors in the U.S., while panel8bdisplays the number of top 10-25% foreigners
27:1015:80780:11:11:72:540:279:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:in the U.S. Both are normalized by a base year (1986).  The red line shows the top tax rate differential between the
27:1016:80896:11:11:72:540:268:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:U.S. and the synthetic control country (on the right axis), i.e.,τUS/τsynthetic−1.  We report the difference-in-difference
27:1017:81018:11:20:72:238:257:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:elasticity estimates described in the text.
27:1018:81061:20:16:88:539:237:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Indeed, the differential effect of the top tax rate change on the foreign superstar top 1% inventors
27:1019:81161:16:17:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is visible in two ways.  First, purely exploiting the logic of the synthetic control method, we can
27:1020:81260:17:16:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:show  that  the  number  of  foreign  top  1%  superstar  inventors  increased  drastically  relative  to  a
27:1021:81368:16:17:72:540:188:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:scenario with no reform (as proxied by the synthetic control), while this was not the case for the
27:1022:81466:17:16:72:540:171:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:lower quality top 10-25% foreign inventors.  In panel (a), the red line (on the y axis) is the top tax
27:1023:81568:16:21:72:539:155:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:differential between the U.S. and the synthetic country, defined asτUSτsynthetic−1.  While top tax rates
27:1024:81672:21:14:80:539:134:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:F:34Some normalization is necessary because the U.S. is the largest country in the data and it would not make sense
27:1025:81785:14:11:72:540:120:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:to try and match levels.  It would also not make sense to look at the fraction of foreigners, since the reform was not
27:1026:81903:11:7:72:453:109:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:preferentially targeting foreigners (unlike Denmark’s reform discussed in the next Subsection).
27:1027:81998:7:15:80:539:102:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:F:35Recall that the top 1-5% group still has a very high propensity of being treated and is hence not a good control
27:1028:82112:15:11:72:540:87:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:group.  The results described next naturally also hold if we consider even lower quality inventors, e.g., the below top
27:1029:82231:11:0:72:483:76:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:25%, etc., subject to the trade-offs involved in choosing the control group, as described in Section2.4.
28:1030:82371:0:16:72:540:701:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:were about the same in the U.S. and in the control country, they diverge sharply post reform.36The
28:1031:82469:16:17:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:pre-reform trends are extremely close in the U.S. and the synthetic country.  However, the series for
28:1032:82570:17:16:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:top 1% foreign superstar inventors diverge exactly at the time of the U.S. tax reform between the
28:1033:82667:16:16:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:U.S. and the synthetic control country.  When we repeat the analysis for the lower quality group
28:1034:82763:16:17:72:540:636:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of inventors (the top 10-25%),  we do not see such an effect:  there is no break in the trend post
28:1035:82861:17:16:72:540:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:reform and, if anything, the U.S. series for the top 10-25% foreign inventors fall a bit relative to
28:1036:82961:16:17:72:540:603:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the synthetic control.  Hence, the lower quality top 10-25% foreign inventors, fare similarly in the
28:1037:83061:17:16:72:540:586:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:U.S. (which decreased its top tax rates) and in the other countries (which did not decrease top tax
28:1038:83160:16:26:72:102:570:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rates).
28:1039:83167:26:16:88:539:544:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The second way to see the differential effect of the reform on foreign superstar top 1% inventors
28:1040:83264:16:16:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is  to  directly  consider  the  structural  break  in  their  series  relative  to  that  of  foreign  top  10-25%
28:1041:83379:16:17:72:540:512:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:inventors.  Naturally, all the series for foreigners are growing due to the general growth in patents,
28:1042:83481:17:16:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:inventors,  and innovation over time,  but we can directly compare what happened to the growth
28:1043:83575:16:17:72:540:479:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rates of the top 1% foreign inventors and of the top 10-25% foreign inventors after the 1986 reform.
28:1044:83675:17:16:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Comparing the two solid black lines in panels (a) and (b), we see that while the top 10-25% group
28:1045:83772:16:17:72:540:446:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:was  growing  faster  before  the  reform,  it  is  the  top  1%  that  started  growing  much  more  rapidly
28:1046:83881:17:16:72:540:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:post reform.  More specifically, pre-reform, the top 10-25% series was growing on average at 12.7%
28:1047:83979:16:16:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:per year,  while the top 1% was growing at only 6.8% per year during the same period.  On the
28:1048:84072:16:17:72:540:397:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:other hand, after the reform, the top 10-25% was still growing at about the same rate (11.3% per
28:1049:84168:17:16:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:year), while the top 1% drastically accelerated to 16.4% per year.  As a result, the composition of
28:1050:84267:16:17:72:540:364:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:foreign inventors in the U.S. dramatically changed after the 1986 reform, and the ratio of the top
28:1051:84365:17:38:72:379:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:1% foreigners to the top 10-25% foreigners drastically increased.
28:1052:84430:38:25:72:241:309:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:4.3    Denmark’s 1992 reform
28:1053:84458:25:17:72:539:284:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:Next, we consider the Danish 1992 reform, studied inKleven et al.(2013) andKleven et al.(2014).37
28:1054:84555:17:16:71:539:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The Danish tax reform created a preferential tax scheme for foreign researchers and high-income
28:1055:84650:16:16:71:539:251:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:foreigners.  Instead of the usual top tax rate (of 60%), foreigners were taxed for 3 fiscal years at a flat
28:1056:84757:16:17:71:539:235:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rate of 30% for their 1991-1995 income and then at another reduced rate of 25% after 1995.  Since
28:1057:84854:17:16:71:539:218:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:our inventors would typically qualify as “researchers,” we can study whether they were affected by
28:1058:84952:16:26:71:148:202:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:this tax scheme.
28:1059:84968:26:16:88:539:176:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We revert to using the PCT data, since Denmark is essentially not represented in the USPTO
28:1060:85058:16:17:71:539:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:data.   Recall  that  in  the  PCT  data,  we  do  not  have  inventor  quality  measures  since  it  is  not  a
28:1061:85170:17:20:71:539:143:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:panel data.  Looking at the effect on all inventors is likely to give us a lower bound of the effects of
28:1062:85274:20:14:80:539:123:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:F:36The approach puts significant weight on Canada and on Switzerland for the top quality series and on Canada,
28:1063:85383:14:7:72:461:109:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:Great Britain, and Japan for the lower quality series (see AppendixD and Appendix tableA12)
28:1064:85474:7:15:80:539:102:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:F:37Unfortunately, other such reforms, such as the Spanish law of 2004 studied byKleven et al.(2013) took place
28:1065:85583:15:11:72:540:87:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:too late given our sample years (and the problem of truncation of patent citations) and cannot be studied well in our
28:1066:85700:11:0:72:102:76:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:setting.

30:1114:89412:17:16:71:539:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Recall that we restrict the sample to the 8 countries which account for around 90% of all patents

30:1124:90236:17:16:71:539:269:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:indicator variables for whether the inventor is in the top 1%, top 1-5%, top 5-10%, top 10-25%,

30:1127:90521:16:16:71:539:220:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:from formulas (1)-(4).  The effect of these individual characteristics is allowed to vary by country
30:1128:90621:16:17:71:539:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(i.e., they are all interacted with country fixed effects).  We assign one of six technological fields to

30:1136:91401:15:11:72:540:87:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:the top 25% in their lifetime, while the ranking within that sample is dynamic and can change for a given inventor
30:1137:91515:11:0:72:510:76:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:from year to year.  Table 9 considers how the results change if we also rank inventors by the static measures.

31:1160:93670:17:16:71:539:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tax rate on different quality inventors.  In the case of identification 2, this captures the propensities

31:1175:94644:16:21:71:479:112:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:quality rankrit(equivalent to interacting the top retention rate with rank dummies).
31:1176:94728:21:15:80:539:91:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:F:41Note that including year fixed effects does not change anything since the multinomial logit already filters out all
31:1177:94845:15:0:72:232:76:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:variables which do not vary by country.
32:1178:94920:0:16:88:539:701:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:For  our  preferred  identification  2,  to  compute  the  effect  of  the  top  tax  rate  on  the  top  1%
32:1179:95028:16:17:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:inventors, we need to pick a control group.  As explained previously, given the fuzzy design, it is
32:1180:95127:17:16:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:not a priori obvious which group is the best control group.  This is why we provide the results for
32:1181:95226:16:16:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:three choices of control groups, the top 5-10%, the top 10-25%, and the below top 25%. Bear in mind
32:1182:95325:16:17:72:540:636:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that in this estimation sample, the “below top 25%” refers to a still relatively high quality group
32:1183:95424:17:16:72:540:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of inventors, which have been or will at some point be in the top 25%, but are not currently there.
32:1184:95523:16:17:72:539:603:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:If we consider groupgas the control group, whereg∈ {top 5-10%, top 10-25%, below top 25%},
32:1185:95613:17:24:72:482:586:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:then the corresponding effect on the top 1% will be computed as ∆αg=αtop 1%−αg.
32:1186:95692:24:16:72:540:562:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f3:B:Controlling for the counterfactual wage:As explained earlier, a crucial challenge is to control
32:1187:95787:16:17:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for the counterfactual wagewctithat inventoriwould receive in any countrycat timet.  Part of the
32:1188:95883:17:16:72:540:529:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:wage variation is well absorbed by the aforementioned controls (i)-(iii), which capture aggregate
32:1189:95980:16:17:72:540:513:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:effects at the country-year level and the technological class level. In addition, we consider three more
32:1190:96084:17:16:72:539:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:benchmark specifications that progressively add the following, more detailed proxies for log(wcti).
32:1191:96183:16:17:72:326:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Overall, we estimate the following four specifications:
32:1192:96238:17:17:88:250:463:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:1) Including only controls (i)-(iii).
32:1193:96275:17:17:88:539:446:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:2)  Adding  the  quality  of  the  inventor  at  timet,  interacted  with  country  fixed  effects.   This
32:1194:96381:17:16:72:540:429:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:controls  for  aggregate  country-specific  effects  that  vary  by  ability.   Our  benchmark  measure  is,
32:1195:96489:16:17:72:539:413:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:as explained in Section2.3,  citation-weighted patents to date (measureq1).  Alternative quality
32:1196:96585:17:17:72:368:396:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:measures are considered in the robustness checks in Table9.42

32:1198:96745:16:16:71:539:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:effect times the ability measure, in order to capture differential evolutions over time in the wage
32:1199:96844:16:17:71:219:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:premium in different countries.
32:1200:96875:17:17:88:539:330:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:4) Adding country, ability and technological field specific trends by controlling for year trend

32:1204:97236:16:24:72:244:256:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:be estimated as a multinomial logit.
32:1205:97272:24:17:72:539:232:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f3:B:Computing Elasticities:To go from the coefficients on the retention rate to elasticities, we follow

33:1314:99807:16:17:72:456:182:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:which provides some reassurance about the controls for the counterfactual wage.
33:1315:99886:17:17:88:539:165:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The top 1% of inventors and the top 1-5% of inventors are significantly sensitive to the top tax
33:1316:99982:17:16:72:540:148:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rate.  The elasticity of domestic superstar top 1% inventors is (in the most detailed specification)
33:1317:100082:16:19:72:540:132:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:0.024 and that of foreign top 1% superstar inventors is 0.8.  Note that these match very well the

34:1365:103912:32:17:88:539:109:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:It is interesting that the top 10-25% and below the top 25% are actually negatively driven by
34:1366:104005:17:16:72:540:92:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:top tax rate decreases, which can be due to the presence of sorting and general equilibrium effects.
34:1367:104105:16:0:72:539:76:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Indeed, the lack of country×year fixed effects here means that sorting and general equilibrium
35:1368:104253:0:16:72:540:701:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:effects could be loaded on the estimated coefficients on the log retention rate.  The migration of
35:1369:104351:16:17:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:some inventors can have general equilibrium effects and spillovers on other inventors, depending on
35:1370:104450:17:16:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the structure of the labor market.  For instance, if demand for inventors by companies in different
35:1371:104549:16:16:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:countries  is  rigid,  a  lower  top  tax  rate  could  lead  to  sorting  by  higher  quality  inventors,  to  the

35:1378:105183:17:16:72:540:507:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:still exhibit a very significantly positive effect of top tax rates, as can be expected since inventors
35:1379:105286:16:17:72:540:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in this group have a very high propensity of being treated.  The top 5-10% inventors also show a
35:1380:105382:17:16:72:540:474:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:positive effect, albeit insignificant, since their propensity to be treated is lower.  The coefficients

35:1387:106009:17:16:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:As already discussed above, a control group such as the top 5-10% may give a lower bound estimate,
35:1388:106107:16:16:72:540:342:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:since inventors in this group may still be partially treated.  A control group such as the below top

35:1390:106305:17:16:72:540:309:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:hence yield a larger estimated effect of the top tax rate on superstar top 1% inventors.  For the

38:1494:113662:16:16:71:539:635:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that  the  average  value  of  a  patent  is  $  810,000  (in  1972  dollars),  which  represents  $  2.7  million
38:1495:113776:16:17:71:539:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in 2000 dollars.48Naturally,  this is likely to be a lower bound on the value of the patents from
38:1496:113873:17:16:71:539:602:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:superstar top 1% inventors. Superstar inventors are by definition those who create the most valuable
38:1497:113973:16:17:71:539:586:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:breakthrough patents.  Indeed, while the median patent in our sample receives 8 citations, the most
38:1498:114072:17:16:71:539:569:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:valuable top 1% patents receive on average 171 citations, which is 21 times higher.  Hence, we can
38:1499:114170:16:17:71:539:553:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:perform a second calculation, supposing that the value per patent of superstar top 1% inventors
38:1500:114265:17:16:71:539:536:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is  close  to  the  value  of  the  top  1%  most  valuable  patents  (which  could  be  approximated  by  21
38:1501:114374:16:16:71:539:520:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:times the average value of $ 2.7 million, i.e., $ 57 million.49)  The potential gains in economic value
38:1502:114477:16:17:71:539:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:from top tax decreases are shown in Table7 for a 5 percentage point and a 10 percentage point
38:1503:114570:17:16:71:539:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:top  tax  decrease.   Naturally,  these  are  only  the  gains  through  the  migration  channel  of  top  1%
38:1504:114679:16:17:71:539:471:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:inventors and there are of course many other economic gains or losses from reducing the top tax
38:1505:114774:17:16:71:540:454:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rate through other channels in the rest of the economy.50These effects could also be a lower bound
38:1506:114872:16:17:71:539:438:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the economic value lost if there are positive spillovers from having superstar inventors locally
38:1507:114971:17:16:71:540:421:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(as documented in the papers cited in the Introduction and in Section2.3).  As we show in Section
38:1508:115068:16:16:71:539:405:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:6.1, superstar inventors also have more patent breadth and breadth of impact, above and beyond
38:1509:115162:16:17:71:429:389:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:pure citations, which may imply that their patents are even more valuable.
38:1510:115236:17:17:88:539:372:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:The  economic  gains  per  country  from  decreasing  top  tax  rates  depend  on  the  domestic  and
38:1511:115337:17:16:71:540:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:foreign elasticities (in Table6), but also on the size of the inventor base.  The U.S. has the largest
38:1512:115439:16:17:71:539:339:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:economic gain, despite the small elasticities, while Italy has the smallest economic gains, which is
38:1513:115539:17:16:71:539:322:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:a combination of a relatively low elasticity of domestic inventors and a relatively small inventor
38:1514:115637:16:17:71:539:306:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:base.  To a first-order we could imagine that these yearly gains would scale up for a tax decrease
38:1515:115735:17:35:71:183:289:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that lasts several years.
38:1516:115760:35:25:71:240:254:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:5.4    The Role of Companies
38:1517:115788:25:16:71:539:229:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:What is the role of employers in determining inventors’ mobility?  One might expect that role to
38:1518:115884:16:17:71:539:213:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:be important.  Indeed, large companies often recruit internationally.  In the U.S., Qualcomm Inc.
38:1519:115981:17:16:71:539:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and  Microsoft  have  ratio  of  foreign  inventors  to  total  inventors  in  the  company  of,  respectively,
38:1520:116092:16:16:71:539:180:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:51% and 57%.  In Switzerland, Alstom Technology Ltd.  and Syngenta Participation AG both have
38:1521:116185:16:19:71:540:164:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:immigration rates of 67%.51There are two related questions when talking about the role of the
38:1522:116278:19:11:80:508:145:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:A:48We use the GDP deflator provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to adjust the nominal numbers.
38:1523:116378:11:11:80:400:134:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:A:49Assuming that the value of patents scales approximately linearly in citations.
38:1524:116458:11:14:80:539:123:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:F:50Because  this  is  clearly  just  a  very  small  fraction  of  all  the  effects  that  lower  top  tax  rates  could  have,  these
38:1525:116592:14:11:72:540:109:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:numbers are not meant to be compared to the lost tax revenue.  They are just meant to illustrate the “dollar value”
38:1526:116707:11:7:72:185:98:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:of the elasticities estimated.

39:1549:117421:11:11:72:539:487:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:chosen is the below top 25% of inventors from Table5.  To compute the change in domestic inventors and the change
39:1550:117534:11:11:72:540:476:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:in foreign inventors, we consider a 5 and 10 percentage points decrease in top tax rates from the actual tax rate in
39:1551:117650:11:11:72:540:465:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:each country.  The economic gain per year is computed as in formula (11).  Columns 1 and 2 assume a patent value
39:1552:117762:11:11:72:540:454:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:per superstar top 1% inventor equal to the average patent value of $ 2.7 million.  Columns 3 and 4 assume a large
39:1553:117875:11:11:72:540:443:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:patent value equal to $ 57 million.  These values are obtained using patent value estimates fromPakes(1985) and
39:1554:117986:11:11:72:540:432:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:our own calculations provided in the text.  These effects could be underestimating the economic value lost if there
39:1555:118101:11:11:72:540:421:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:are positive spillovers from having superstar inventors locally (as documented in the papers cited in the Introduction
39:1556:118219:11:38:72:150:410:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:and in Section2.3).
39:1557:118238:38:16:72:540:372:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:employer.  The first is whether employer characteristics, in particular whether it is a multinational
39:1558:118339:16:17:72:540:356:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:company and how concentrated it is in some countries, matters. The second is whether the employer
39:1559:118436:17:16:72:540:339:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:contributes to the decision of where to locate and, as a result, the estimated elasticity is a mix of
39:1560:118537:16:17:72:211:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:employee and firm responses.
39:1561:118565:17:16:88:539:306:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Regarding  the  latter  question,  the  top  personal  income  tax  rate  affects  the  surplus  available
39:1562:118671:16:17:72:540:290:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:from a firm-employee match.  Depending on the bargaining setup between firms and employees, the
39:1563:118766:17:16:72:540:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:firm should internalize to varying degrees the level of the personal income tax rate.  In the limit, if
39:1564:118869:16:17:72:540:257:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the firm had to pay full compensating differentials for higher top tax rates to star workers, it should
39:1565:118972:17:16:72:540:240:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:perfectly internalize personal income tax rates.  At the same time, the company might bring to the
39:1566:119070:16:16:72:540:224:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:table other considerations for relocating the worker, which are orthogonal to the personal income
39:1567:119167:16:17:72:540:208:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tax rate.  In this latter case, the observed sensitivity to the top personal income tax rates should
39:1568:119267:17:16:72:540:191:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:be lowered relative to a case where workers and firms decide unitarily.  To sum up, any observed
39:1569:119363:16:17:72:540:175:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:response to personal income taxes may be driven by the employee or by the firm, depending on the
39:1570:119459:17:16:72:247:158:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:bargaining and wage setting process.
39:1571:119495:16:17:88:539:142:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Regarding  the  role  of  the  type  of  employer,  in  theory,  the  effects  on  international  mobility
39:1572:119601:17:16:72:540:125:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of  working  for  a  multinational  company  are  ambiguous.   On  the  one  hand,  it  might  make  an
39:1573:119704:16:17:72:540:109:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:international  move  easier  for  the  worker  either  directly  within  the  company,  or  by  giving  him
39:1574:119811:17:16:72:540:92:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:access to a wider international network built over the course of his career in a multinational.  Of
39:1575:119910:16:0:72:540:76:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:course, workers more likely to take advantage of tax differentials in the future could also simply
40:1576:120044:0:16:72:540:701:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:self-select  into  a  multinational  with  the  expectation  to  move  in  response  to  tax  rates.   On  the
40:1577:120154:16:17:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:other hand, multinationals may be more able to relocate their workers internationally for strategic
40:1578:120253:17:16:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:corporate reasons, rather than because of personal income tax rates, which would tend to dampen
40:1579:120348:16:16:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the estimated elasticity to top personal tax rates.  The role of companies for inventor mobility is

40:1614:121441:11:11:72:540:154:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:explanatory notes to Table5.  All regressions contain the same covariates as Table5, column 4.  Column 1 adds an
40:1615:121553:11:11:71:539:143:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:interaction term of the log retention rate with whether the inventor was employed by a non-multinational company
40:1616:121665:11:11:71:539:132:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:in the last period observed.  Employees from non multinationals appear significantly less sensitive to the tax rate,
40:1617:121781:11:11:71:539:121:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:which can indicate that they are less able to move internationally to take advantage of lower taxes.  Column 2 adds
40:1618:121896:11:11:71:539:110:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:as a control the share of innovative activity of the inventor’s company that takes place in the destination country
40:1619:122011:11:10:71:539:99:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:and an interaction of the activity share with the top retention rate.  Inventors are significantly less sensitive to the
40:1620:122131:10:8:71:539:89:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:top tax rate in any destination country if their company has a large share of its innovative activity in that country.

41:1622:122331:0:16:88:539:701:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Column 1 of Table8 reports the results from the benchmark specification, adding the interaction
41:1623:122426:16:17:71:539:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of the top retention rate with a dummy equal to 1 if the inventor didnotwork for a multinational
41:1624:122522:17:16:71:539:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:company in the previous period during which he was observed in the sample.  Inventors who are not
41:1625:122619:16:16:71:539:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in multinationals are significantly less sensitive to the top tax rate.  It seems, then, that working
41:1626:122720:16:17:71:435:636:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:for a multinational company facilitates taking advantage of tax differentials.
41:1627:122798:17:16:88:539:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Next, we compute the share of innovative activity of the inventor’s company that takes place in
41:1628:122893:16:17:71:539:603:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:each potential destination country, defined as the fraction of yearly patents of the company assigned
41:1629:122994:17:16:71:539:586:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to inventors from that country.  Column 2 shows that if the company of the inventor has a higher
41:1630:123090:16:17:71:539:570:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:share of its innovative activities in some destination country, the inventor is less sensitive to the
41:1631:123191:17:16:71:539:553:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:retention rate in that destination country.  The elasticity for those inventors whose company has
41:1632:123288:16:16:71:539:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:no share of activity in the foreign country is very large, but declines very rapidly in the share of
41:1633:123388:16:17:71:146:521:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:activity abroad.
41:1634:123404:17:16:88:539:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:This does not give us much indication as to who (the employee or the firm) ultimately takes
41:1635:123495:16:17:71:539:488:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the decision where to locate the worker.  Indeed, a higher activity share abroad might mean that
41:1636:123591:17:16:71:539:471:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the idiosyncratic preferenceμof the inventor is large for that destination country, due to career
41:1637:123688:16:17:71:539:455:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:concerns, and this difference is sufficiently large to outweigh tax differentials.  But it may instead be
41:1638:123793:17:16:71:539:438:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the company that wants to relocate inventors to high activity places for strategic corporate reasons
41:1639:123893:16:16:71:539:422:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:unrelated to the personal income tax.  Both scenarios would generate the reduced elasticity to tax
41:1640:123991:16:17:71:202:406:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rates observed in column 2.
41:1641:124018:17:16:88:539:389:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:While  companies  may  or  may  not  be  relocating  workers  due  to  personal  tax  considerations,
41:1642:124119:16:17:71:539:373:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:we can at least provide some evidence that they do not relocate inventors in our sample based on
41:1643:124215:17:16:71:540:356:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:corporate taxation.  Appendix TableA14reports the results from regressions identical to those in
41:1644:124311:16:17:71:539:340:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Table4, to which we add the corporate tax as an explanatory variable.  The corporate tax rate has
41:1645:124408:17:16:71:331:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:no explanatory power for inventors’ location decisions.
41:1646:124463:16:17:88:539:307:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Overall, even though we cannot ultimately detect who makes the decision to move, we showed
41:1647:124553:17:38:71:470:290:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that employer characteristics matter for the elasticity of migration to top tax rates.

41:1649:124699:27:16:71:539:225:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:This section provides an extensive series of robustness checks on our benchmark results and several
41:1650:124798:16:32:71:123:209:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:extensions.

41:1652:124853:24:16:71:539:153:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Our measure of inventor quality and the corresponding ranking of inventors is central to our analysis.
41:1653:124955:16:28:71:508:137:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Therefore, we explore here how the results change if we consider different quality measures.
41:1654:125047:28:17:71:539:109:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f3:B:Static  versus  dynamic  measures,  wage  formation  and  employer  expectations:Recall
41:1655:125134:17:16:71:539:92:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that our benchmark quality measure is dynamic citations-weighted patents.  This means that an
41:1656:125227:16:0:71:539:76:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:inventor could be classified as a superstar today (if he is ranked in the top of the regional quality
42:1657:125364:0:16:72:540:701:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:distribution in that year), but may not have been a superstar yesterday and may also no longer
42:1658:125458:16:17:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:be a superstar tomorrow.  I.e., dynamic superstar rankings can change over time and it is assumed
42:1659:125555:17:16:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that only the current quality ranking matters for income.  This corresponds to a situation in which
42:1660:125654:16:16:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the employer has no foresight at all about the inventor’s future potential or there are no job search
42:1661:125755:16:17:72:540:636:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and matching frictions that would prevent firms from firing a worker and hiring a better one in a
42:1662:125852:17:16:72:540:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:future period in which information about the inventor’s quality is revealed.  Symmetrically, it also
42:1663:125952:16:17:72:540:603:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:implies that, conditional on the current value of the quality measure and rank, past rankings do
42:1664:126048:17:17:72:127:586:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:not matter.
42:1665:126059:17:16:88:539:569:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Of  course,  the  wage  setting  process  is  a  complicated  one  and  might  depend  both  on  past
42:1666:126160:16:17:72:540:553:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:performance  and  future  expectations,  which  provide  the  employer  with  additional  information
42:1667:126261:17:16:72:540:536:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:about the inventor’s productivity not necessarily reflected in his current patents to date.  To take a
42:1668:126363:16:17:72:540:520:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:concrete example from academia, a university might hire a promising young Ph.D. graduate without
42:1669:126459:17:16:72:540:503:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:any publication or patent record, based on his revealed skills during conversations and seminars.
42:1670:126556:16:16:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:This new hire may have a high marginal product as measured by his impact on graduate students
42:1671:126649:16:17:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:and colleagues that is not yet reflected in his publication record.  Alternatively, a senior professor
42:1672:126751:17:16:72:540:454:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:with several very high impact publications, but who is no longer producing at a level that would
42:1673:126847:16:17:72:540:438:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:classify  him in  the  current top  1%  of researchers is  probably still  highly  paid based  on his  past
42:1674:126954:17:17:72:105:421:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:record.
42:1675:126961:17:16:88:539:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:If these situations apply in practice, a more appropriate component of the income of an inventor
42:1676:127057:16:17:72:540:388:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:would be based on a lifetime, static quality. In particular, we can redefine an inventor as being in the
42:1677:127161:17:16:72:540:371:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:top 1% of inventors if, over the course of his life in the sample, he has ever been or will ever be in the
42:1678:127267:16:17:72:539:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:top 1%.  The results for this alternative quality measure are in column 1 of Table9.  The elasticity
42:1679:127367:17:16:72:539:338:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:measures are very close to the benchmark (column 4 in Table5).  In reality, wages are probably set
42:1680:127465:16:16:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to some extent based on current marginal product and to some extent based on potential future
42:1681:127558:16:17:72:540:306:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:information and on realized past information, especially if there are search and matching frictions
42:1682:127657:17:16:72:540:289:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that make the employer want to lock in promising employees.  It is hence reassuring that even a
42:1683:127752:16:17:72:317:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:fully static measure still maintains our main result.
42:1684:127805:17:17:88:539:256:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We  also  consider  the  case  in  which  an  inventor  is  defined  as  a  superstar  if  he  has  ever  been
42:1685:127915:17:16:72:539:239:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in the top 1%in the past(even if he currently no longer is in the top 1%).  This corresponds to
42:1686:128010:16:17:72:540:223:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the case in which an inventor is always rewarded for past success, even independent of his current
42:1687:128108:17:16:72:540:206:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:performance,  but  is  not  rewarded  in  anticipation  of  future  success,  or  there  is  no  advance,  lead
42:1688:128219:16:17:72:540:190:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:information about the inventor.  The results are almost perfectly identical to the static measure in
42:1689:128319:17:31:72:365:173:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:column 1 of Table9 and hence not reported to save on space.

42:1691:128468:17:16:72:540:125:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:sible quality measures based on patents and citations that put different emphasis on the quality
42:1692:128564:16:17:72:540:109:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:versus the quantity of patents.  The correlations of these various measures, although significantly
42:1693:128663:17:16:72:539:92:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:positive at the 5% level, are not always large.  For instance, the correlation between measureq1
42:1694:128759:16:0:71:539:76:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:(citations-weighted patents) andq2 (number of patents) is 0.70, the correlation betweenq1 andq3

43:1734:131223:27:17:88:539:142:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We  may  be  worried  that  our  benchmark  quality  measure  (citations-weighted  patent,q1)  is
43:1735:131320:17:16:71:539:125:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:correlated with the likelihood of observing an inventor in the sample, and, consequently, with the
43:1736:131418:16:17:71:540:109:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:likelihood of observing a move.  Therefore, we provide three more tests by using patent counts (q2),
43:1737:131518:17:16:71:540:92:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:average citations per patent (q3), and max citations per patent (q4) as alternative measures to show
43:1738:131618:16:0:71:539:76:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that it is really the quality of an inventor that matters, rather than the pure quantity of patents.
44:1739:131754:0:16:72:539:701:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:Column 2 of Table 9reassures us that the results are not artificially driven by observing people with
44:1740:131855:16:17:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:more patents more frequently.  Using simple patent counts, the coefficient on the top retention rate
44:1741:131955:17:16:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:becomes much smaller and insignificant for top 1% inventors, while positive and significant for the
44:1742:132054:16:16:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:below top 25% inventors.  On the other hand, using purely quality driven measures such as average
44:1743:132151:16:17:72:540:636:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:citations per patent (in column 3) or max citations per patent (in column 4), maintains or even
44:1744:132246:17:16:72:540:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:strengthens our benchmark results.  Hence, the relation is not mechanically driven by frequency of
44:1745:132344:16:30:72:129:603:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:observation.
44:1746:132356:30:16:72:540:573:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f3:B:Patent breadth and breadth of impact measures:Another way to assess an inventor’s impact
44:1747:132444:16:16:72:540:557:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:is through the breadth of his innovations, and the extent of his new and original ideas.  We hence
44:1748:132542:16:17:72:540:541:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:construct two additional quality measures.  The first measure, which we call “breadth of impact”
44:1749:132638:17:16:72:540:524:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:considers the number of technology classes that end up building on an inventor’s patents.  Formally,
44:1750:132738:16:17:72:539:508:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:we take the set of patents of an inventor until timet−1 and count the number of technological
44:1751:132831:17:16:71:539:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:classes  which  contain  patents  that  ever  cite  those  patents.   The  second  measure,  called  patent
44:1752:132938:16:17:71:539:475:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:breadth,  is  the  dynamic  claims-adjusted  patent  stock,  i.e.,  the  number  of  claims  on  all  patents
44:1753:133047:17:16:71:540:458:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:received by the inventor by timet−1 (constructed exactly as our benchmark measureq1, but using
44:1754:133141:16:17:71:539:442:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:claims instead of citations).  It is common in the literature to use patent claims to proxy for patent
44:1755:133243:17:16:71:539:425:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:breadth (Lerner,1994;Lanjouw and Schankerman,2004).  In Appendix TableA10, we show that,
44:1756:133331:16:16:71:539:409:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:as expected, superstar inventors according to our benchmark definition, also have significantly more
44:1757:133431:16:17:71:539:393:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:patent breadth and breadth of impact.  The results using the breadth of impact and the patent
44:1758:133524:17:33:71:443:376:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:breadth as quality measures are, respectively, in columns 1 and 2 of Table10.

44:1760:133642:24:16:71:539:319:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:One  problem  about  using  the  patent  data  to  track  inventors’  locations  is  that  we  only  observe
44:1761:133750:16:17:71:539:303:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:inventors  in  years  in  which  they  patent,  but  not  in  the  years  between  consecutive  patents.   We
44:1762:133859:17:16:71:539:286:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:perform two analyses to address this problem.  First, we make sure that the results do not change
44:1763:133956:16:17:71:539:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:much when we impute the inventors’ locations for missing years.  Second, we estimate a selection
44:1764:134052:17:23:71:103:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:model.

44:1766:134148:16:17:71:539:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:not  patent,  we  use  the  following  imputation  algorithm:  if  the  inventor  is  seen  in  countryAin
44:1767:134254:17:16:71:540:197:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:yearXand  in  countryBin  yearY > X,  we  assume  that  he  has  been  in  countryAuntil  year
44:1768:134348:16:16:71:539:181:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f3:B:X+ (Y−X)/2 and in countryBthereafter and until yearY.  We do not impute years before the
44:1769:134436:16:17:71:540:165:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:first or after the last patent.  Column 5 of Table9 shows that the elasticities are slightly smaller,
44:1770:134537:17:23:71:322:148:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:but still very similar when we use the imputed data.
44:1771:134589:23:16:71:539:125:11:g_d0_f14:11:g_d0_f3:B:Binary Selection Model:To check for selection based on the number of patents, we also use a
44:1772:134680:16:17:71:539:109:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:formal selection model.  To simplify the computational burden, we only study the mobility between
44:1773:134777:17:16:71:539:92:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the U.S. and Canada.  The U.S.-Canada corridor is very large and among inventors who migrate
44:1774:134869:16:0:71:539:76:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:within this corridor, very few also migrate to another country.  Among 863,406 U.S.-born inventors,

45:1808:136229:17:16:72:540:232:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:country.  Among 44,321 Canada-born inventors, 946 are observed only in the U.S. later and 18 are
45:1809:136325:16:21:72:313:216:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:observed both in the U.S. and some third country.
45:1810:136374:21:16:88:539:195:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:First, we estimate a simple probit model for the inventors born and observed only in Canada

45:1812:136576:17:16:72:540:162:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The  dependent  variables  are  analogous  to  the  ones  described  in  Section5.1,  with  some  small
45:1813:136679:16:17:72:540:146:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:modifications.  Again, we include the same set of controls i)-iii), and we consider progressively more
45:1814:136781:17:16:72:540:129:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:detailed specifications for the counterfactual wages,  by adding quality measures,  quality-country

45:1816:136984:17:20:72:368:96:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rate, interacted with inventor rankings (top 1%, top 1-5%, ..).
45:1817:137047:20:0:88:539:76:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Next, we perform a formal Heckman selection model with exactly the same controls and compare
46:1818:137175:0:16:72:540:701:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:its results with those from the simple probit model without selection.  We exploit a reform enacted
46:1819:137274:16:17:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:in 1995 and introduced by the “Patent Term and Publication Reform Act of 1994” to synchronize
46:1820:137367:17:16:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:patent terms with requirements of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act.  The main changes were
46:1821:137457:16:16:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that the patent term of 17 years (counted from the patent grant year) was changed to 20 years from
46:1822:137555:16:17:72:540:636:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the patent’s earliest application year.  Given that on average the patent grant period is less than
46:1823:137654:17:16:72:540:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:3 years, this is typically an effective increase in the patent term.  Indeed, the average lag between
46:1824:137755:16:17:72:540:603:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the application and the grant was 2 years, which effectively implies that the reform has increased
46:1825:137853:17:16:72:539:586:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f16:B:the average duration of patent protection upon patent grant by 1 year to 18 years (=20 years−
46:1826:137946:16:17:72:540:570:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:2 years).  Appendix Table A9 provides the average gap between the application and grant years
46:1827:138039:17:16:72:540:553:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:on average, as well as for inventors of different qualities and industries.  This reform increased the
46:1828:138141:16:16:72:539:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:likelihood of patenting, and, hence, of observing inventors in the data (see Table11below), but
46:1829:138236:16:17:72:540:521:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:should not have affected location choices.  Hence, we use a dummy for post-1994 in the first stage
46:1830:138334:17:18:72:180:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:of our selection model.

46:1832:138449:16:41:72:517:470:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:It confirms that the effects of top tax rates remain very similar after controlling for selection.

47:1858:139865:0:16:72:540:701:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:measure showed that the relation between patenting and moving was not mechanical.  Combined

47:1860:140067:17:28:72:236:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:likely not the driver of our results.

47:1862:140204:16:17:72:540:624:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:innocuous for foreign inventors.  First, it could be that inventors who plan to migrate to the U.S.
47:1863:140303:17:16:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tend to patent more heavily with the USPTO. This would tend to make the observed sample more
47:1864:140395:16:17:72:540:591:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:mobile on average than a fictitious sample in which inventors are randomly assigned to patent offices.
47:1865:140497:17:16:72:540:574:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:On the other hand, however, conditional on appearing in the sample, those who had planned to
47:1866:140589:16:17:72:540:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:migrate to the U.S. (and, accordingly, had decided to patent with the USPTO) may not be driven
47:1867:140683:17:16:72:540:541:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:at all by tax considerations, which would tend to reduce the elasticity to taxes.  To address this
47:1868:140781:16:16:72:540:525:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:issue we first repeat the analysis on inventors who patent with the EPO. Many more inventors in
47:1869:140876:16:17:72:540:509:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the EPO data are Europeans.  These results are presented in Section 7 and confirm our previous
47:1870:140970:17:16:72:540:492:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:results.   Second,  we  drop  all  movers  to  the  U.S.  from  both  the  USPTO  and  the  EPO  samples.
47:1871:141075:16:17:72:540:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:These results are reported in Appendix Tables A15 and A17.  These tables show that the effect of
47:1872:141171:17:43:72:460:459:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:the top retention rate is still very significant on the superstar top 1% inventors.52

47:1874:141281:28:16:72:540:388:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:The mobility of inventors has different economic implications if it is short-term versus long-term.  In
47:1875:141384:16:16:72:540:372:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:this section, we consider the effects of taxation exclusively on long-term mobility.  We define a long-
47:1876:141487:16:17:72:540:356:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:term move as a move that is never followed by a move back to the origin country during the time the
47:1877:141586:17:16:72:540:339:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:inventor is in the sample.  Recall that the average time in the benchmark sample for an inventor is
47:1878:141685:16:17:72:540:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:12 years.  On the one hand, long-term mobility may be much less sensitive to contemporaneous tax
47:1879:141781:17:16:72:540:306:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:rates, since people should normally re-optimize only once future tax changes happen.  On the other
47:1880:141879:16:17:72:540:290:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:hand, long-term mobility could be even more strongly correlated with tax changes if tax changes
47:1881:141974:17:16:72:540:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are highly persistent and people are aware of this fact, or if people overestimate the persistence of
47:1882:142075:16:16:72:540:257:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tax changes and are then faced with moving costs that prevent them from moving back during the
47:1883:142169:16:17:72:539:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:average period of 12 years that we observe them.  The results in column 1 of Table12show that
47:1884:142262:17:16:71:539:224:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:domestic inventors’ long-term mobility is slightly less sensitive to tax rates.  For foreign inventors,
47:1885:142365:16:17:71:539:208:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:it is slightly more sensitive to tax rates.  When it comes to long-term moves, it does not seem to
47:1886:142463:17:16:71:539:191:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:matter significantly whether the inventor works for a multinational (column 2).  It still seems to
47:1887:142561:16:17:71:539:175:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:matter how concentrated the research activity of the employer is (column 3), although the effects
47:1888:142658:17:24:71:534:158:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are weakened.  This may indicate that for long-term mobility career concerns continue to matter.
47:1889:142754:24:14:80:539:134:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:F:52Note that for the USPTO sample, overall the estimated coefficients are larger, but the elasticities for domestic
47:1890:142868:14:11:72:540:120:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:superstar inventors are a bit smaller and the elasticities of foreign superstar inventors are a bit larger.  This is due
47:1891:142988:11:11:72:540:109:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:to the lower overall number of moves once we drop moves to the U.S. (see our discussion of how the elasticities are
47:1892:143103:11:11:72:540:98:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:derived from the multinomial logit as in (9) and (10) and related to the probability of staying in one’s home country).
47:1893:143222:11:11:72:540:87:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:F:For the EPO data described in Section 7, there is barely any change at all in the estimated elasticities of domestic

48:1935:145308:17:16:71:539:142:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:heavily dominated by U.S. inventors.  Therefore, it is very valuable to test whether the sensitivity of

50:2010:150867:39:27:72:173:284:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:8    Conclusion
50:2011:150882:27:17:72:540:257:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:In this paper, we consider the effects of taxation on the international mobility of inventors, who
50:2012:150980:17:16:72:540:240:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:are economically highly valuable agents and key drivers of economic growth.  We put particular
50:2013:151074:16:17:72:540:224:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:emphasis on superstar inventors, those with the most and most valuable inventions.  We use dis-
50:2014:151169:17:16:72:540:207:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:ambiguated inventor data, based on USPTO and EPO data, to track the international location of
50:2015:151262:16:16:72:540:191:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:inventors over time, and combine it with effective top marginal tax rate data.  We exploit varia-
50:2016:151359:16:17:72:540:175:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tions in the top tax rate across time and countries, as well as its differential impact on inventors
50:2017:151459:17:16:72:288:158:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:at different points in the quality distribution.
50:2018:151507:16:17:88:539:142:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We first provided stylized macroeconomic facts that highlight the responses of superstar inven-
50:2019:151602:17:16:72:540:125:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:tors to top taxes.  We then presented quasi-experimental evidence from three country case studies
50:2020:151699:16:17:72:540:109:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:that  exploited  large  changes  in  migration  policies  or  tax  policy.   We  estimate  a  multinomial  lo-
50:2021:151809:17:16:72:540:92:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cation model and find that the baseline elasticity of the number of superstar domestic inventors
50:2022:151905:16:0:72:540:76:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to the top net-of-tax rate is small (around 0.03 in our preferred specification).  This translates on
51:2023:152008:0:16:72:540:701:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:average into an increase of 1% in domestic superstar top 1% inventors at home for a 10 percentage
51:2024:152105:16:17:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:points  decrease  in  top  tax  rates  from  a  level  of  60%.   The  elasticity  of  the  number  of  superstar
51:2025:152218:17:16:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:top 1% foreign inventors to the net-of-tax rate is much higher, around 1, which translates into a
51:2026:152315:16:16:72:540:652:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:26% increase in foreign superstar top 1% inventors for the same 10 percentage points decrease in
51:2027:152411:16:17:72:540:636:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:top tax rates.  Inventors who have worked for multinationals in the previous period are more likely
51:2028:152510:17:16:72:540:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to take advantage of tax differentials, possibly because working for a multinational makes a move
51:2029:152607:16:17:72:540:603:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:abroad easier and grants the inventor international exposure.  On the other hand, inventors whose
51:2030:152704:17:16:72:540:586:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:company has a research activity that is highly concentrated in a given country are less sensitive
51:2031:152801:16:17:72:540:570:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:to tax differentials in that country, presumably because career concerns (being located where the
51:2032:152898:17:16:72:540:553:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:company’s main research activity is) outweigh tax considerations.  We also find evidence for sorting
51:2033:152998:16:17:72:468:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:effects by ability and negative spillovers from high quality to low quality inventors.
51:2034:153084:17:16:88:539:520:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:We  then  perform  extensive  robustness  checks  on  the  measures  of  earnings  and  quality  used,
51:2035:153186:16:17:72:540:504:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:the length of the migration spells studied, and potential selection based on patenting behavior.  In
51:2036:153286:17:16:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:these extensions and robustness checks, our results persist.  We also reproduce the analysis on a

51:2038:153487:17:16:72:540:454:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:elasticities to the net-of-tax rate of 0.02 for domestic top 1% superstar inventors and of 0.76 for
51:2039:153586:16:17:72:240:438:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:foreign top 1% superstar inventors.
51:2040:153621:17:16:88:539:421:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:These results suggest that, if the economic contribution of these key agents is very important,
51:2041:153716:16:17:72:540:405:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:their migratory responses to tax policy might represent a cost to tax progressivity.  Our estimates
51:2042:153815:17:16:72:540:388:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:could fruitfully be used to calibrate the models of optimal taxation in the presence of migration
51:2043:153912:16:16:72:540:372:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:cited in the Introduction.  An additional relevant consideration is that inventors may have strong
51:2044:154010:16:17:72:540:356:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:spillover effects on their geographically close peers, making it even more important to attract and
51:2045:154109:17:17:72:193:339:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:retain them domestically.
51:2046:154134:17:16:88:539:322:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A:Because inventors are key determinants of economic growth, this paper speaks to the relation
51:2047:154226:16:17:72:540:306:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:between taxation and growth.  An interesting direction for future research would be to include the
51:2048:154324:17:16:72:540:289:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:B:migration margin of inventors, together with their externalities, into a structural economic growth
