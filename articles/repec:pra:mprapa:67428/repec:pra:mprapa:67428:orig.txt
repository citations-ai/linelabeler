2:17:450:26:21:108:542:544:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:It is striking why the resource-rich States in India are income poor. This calls for analyzing 
2:18:544:21:21:72:542:523:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the fiscal policy practices in the resource-rich new States, particularly the fiscal space created by 
2:19:645:21:20:72:543:502:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:the mining proceeds; and in turn what the fiscal  space is used for. Inquiring the “use of mining 
2:20:741:20:21:72:543:482:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:fiscal space” has high policy relevance in India, against the backdrop of recent Mines and Minerals 
2:21:841:21:21:72:542:461:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Development  and  Regulation  (MMDR)  Amendment  Bill, 2015. Such  policy  imperatives  are 
2:22:933:21:20:72:543:440:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:comparable to the global initiatives like “oil-to-cash policy”. This  paper explores the plausible 
2:23:1031:20:21:72:542:420:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:impacts of MMDR 2015 (9B), which stipulates a portion of mining royalty and auction proceeds 
2:24:1121:21:21:72:543:399:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to redress the resource curse. Though nebulous estimates from the coal auction proceeds are on 
2:25:1215:21:30:72:546:378:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:board, ambiguity remains how the newly generated fiscal space would resolve spatial inequalities.

3:47:2481:31:20:108:543:615:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:It is striking why the resource-rich States in India are income poor; and suffer from large 
3:48:2570:20:21:72:543:595:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:deficits in social and economic development. Why the newly formed States in India – Chhattisgarh 
3:49:2664:21:21:72:543:574:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and Jharkhand - has failed to translate their natural resource abundance to economic growth and 
3:50:2757:21:21:72:542:553:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:human development? As per the India Human Development Report 2011, Chhattisgarh was ranked 
3:51:2848:21:20:72:543:532:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:last  among  all  States  in India,  with an HDI of  0.358, against  the  national  average  of 0.467. 
3:52:2948:20:21:72:542:512:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Jharkhand also remains  at bottom level in the human development with an HDI of 0.376.  This 
3:53:3037:21:21:72:543:491:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:calls for analyzing the significance of fiscal policy practices in these resource-rich new States, with 
3:54:3139:21:20:72:543:470:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:special reference to the fiscal space created by the mining revenues and in turn what the mining 
3:55:3236:20:31:72:189:450:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:fiscal space is used for.  
3:56:3262:31:21:108:542:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Theoretically, finding a sustainable fiscal space for human development involves asking 
3:57:3350:21:20:72:542:398:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:what the purpose of fiscal space is, the timeframe for the analytical framework, and the political 
3:58:3449:20:21:72:542:378:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:economy context within which it is implemented (Roy, 2015). Specifically, to what extent do local 
3:59:3547:21:21:72:543:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:jurisdictions benefit from mining proceeds? This question of “use of mining fiscal space” has high 
3:60:3646:21:20:72:542:336:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:policy relevance in India against the backdrop of the recent Mining Industrial Policy - Mines and 
3:61:3742:20:21:72:542:316:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Minerals Development and Regulation (MMDR) Amendment Bill, 2015 - which states a provision 
3:62:3831:21:21:72:543:295:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for District Mineral Foundation (DMF) for linking mining royalty and auction proceeds to improve 
3:63:3928:21:21:72:543:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  quality  of  life  of  the  local  populace,  primarily  the  tribals, and improving the  social 
3:64:4029:21:30:72:264:253:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:infrastructure of these mining districts.  
3:65:4070:30:21:108:543:223:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:The  “district”  is  taken  as  the  unit  of  analysis  of  mining  industrial  regulation  and 
3:66:4166:21:21:72:543:202:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:development policy in India. Can this create regional disparities, as only a few districts in India 
3:67:4266:21:20:72:543:181:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:contribute  to  mining regime?    If  so,  can  DMF  mining  industrial  policy  create  socio-economic 
3:68:4369:20:21:72:543:161:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:inequalities? This paper analyses the effect of mining and resource abundance on socioeconomic 
3:69:4464:21:21:72:542:140:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:outcomes  at  the  district  level, in  retrospect, of  two  resource-rich  new  States  in  India,  viz., 
3:70:4571:21:0:72:217:119:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand.   
4:71:4601:0:21:108:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The paper is organized into seven sections. Section 1 presents a macro policy backdrop of 
4:72:4689:21:21:72:542:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:new  mining  regulations  and  state  capacity; while  Section  2  analyses  the fiscal  fiat  and  royalty 
4:73:4797:21:20:72:543:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:regimes.  Section 3 examines  the  effect  of  mining  regulations  on  economic  growth. Section 4 
4:74:4893:20:21:72:543:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:analyses the plausible effects of MMDR 2015 on the socioeconomic outcomes at the district level, 
4:75:4988:21:21:72:542:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of two resource-rich new States in India, viz., Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. Section 5 explores the 
4:76:5087:21:21:72:543:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reasons for resource curse while section 6 examines the recent Mining Industry Policy initiatives 
4:77:5185:21:31:72:494:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to address the problems of resource curse and spatial inequalities. Section 7 concludes.  
4:78:5272:31:30:72:524:553:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:I.  STATE CAPACITY AND MINING REGULATIONS: A POLICY BACKDROP 
4:79:5331:30:21:108:542:523:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:The drafting of regulations often reflect “state capacity”, which is the power of the state to 
4:80:5425:21:21:72:542:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:raise the fiscal  capacity (Besley,  2013,  Skocpol,  1985,  Besley  and  Persson,  2011). The  natural 
4:81:5527:21:20:72:542:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:resource reliance is a significant determinant of the state capacities, though the political economy 
4:82:5626:20:21:72:543:461:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:play  a  major  role in  the link between the  two (McAdam,  Tarrow  and  Tilly  2001,  Mann  1984, 
4:83:5724:21:21:72:542:440:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:World  Bank,  1992). In  order  to  increase  the  investment  in  the  mining  sector  and  promote 
4:84:5825:21:20:72:543:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sustainable  mining  practices  to  adequately  meet  the  requirements  of  the  industry  without 
4:85:5925:20:21:72:543:399:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sacrificing  environmental  concerns,  the  Mines  and  Minerals  (Development  and  Regulations) 
4:86:6023:21:21:72:542:378:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(MMDR)  Act,  1957  had  been  amended.  The  new  Act is named  as  The  Mines  and  Minerals 
4:87:6118:21:30:72:350:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(Development and Regulation) (Amendment) Bill, 2015.  
4:88:6171:30:21:108:542:327:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:MMDR 2015 has suggested a creation of District Mineral Funds (DMF) for the welfare of 
4:89:6252:21:21:72:542:306:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the project affected people. The new bill also provides greater decentralisation of power to States 
4:90:6352:21:20:72:542:285:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:governments for allocation of resources. The amended Act under section 9(B) says that the State 
4:91:6447:20:21:72:542:265:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Governments shall establish a non-profit body called District Mineral Foundation (DMF) in all the 
4:92:6545:21:21:72:543:244:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mining affected districts. The objective of the DMF is to work for the interest and benefits of the 
4:93:6645:21:21:72:543:223:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:persons and the areas affected by the mining operations in accordance with the State Government. 
4:94:6742:21:20:72:543:202:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The holder of a Mining Lease has to pay an annual amount to the DMF of the district for which 
4:95:6836:20:21:72:543:182:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  percentage  of  royalty  to  be  paid  may  be  prescribed  by  the  Central  Government  in  case  of 
4:96:6944:21:21:72:543:161:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:minerals  other  than  minor  minerals  and  prescribed  by  the  State  Government  in  case  of  minor 
4:97:7049:21:20:72:542:140:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:minerals. In the earlier version of MMDR, it was suggested through profit sharing formula - 26 
4:98:7142:20:21:72:543:120:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:per  cent  of  profits  from  the  coal  miners  and  100  per  cent  royalty  equivalent  money  from  other 
4:99:7252:21:21:72:542:99:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:miners-, which has become controversial, and dropped in the present Bill.  However, the ambiguity 
4:100:7350:21:0:72:465:78:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:remains about the new levies in addition to the existing mining taxes and royalty. 
5:101:7433:0:31:72:214:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:MMDR, 2015 proposed that  
5:102:7458:31:21:72:543:678:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:9B.  (1)  In  all  districts  affected  by  mining  related  operations,  the  State  Government  shall,  by 
5:103:7567:21:31:72:539:657:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:notification, establish a trust to be called the District Mineral Foundation, as a non-profit body.  
5:104:7666:31:20:72:543:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(2) The composition and functioning of the District Mineral Foundation shall be regulated in such 
5:105:7764:20:31:72:344:606:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:manner as may be prescribed by the State Government.  
5:106:7816:31:21:72:542:575:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(3) The object of the District Mineral Foundation shall be to work for the interest and benefit of 
5:107:7914:21:20:72:543:554:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:persons, or areas, affected by mining related operations in such manner as may be prescribed by 
5:108:8010:20:31:72:184:534:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the State Government.  
5:109:8031:31:21:72:543:503:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(4) The holder of a mining lease or a prospecting license-cum-mining lease shall pay annually to 
5:110:8127:21:31:72:541:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the District Mineral Foundation of the District in which the mining operations are carried on,—  
5:111:8222:31:20:72:542:451:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(a) in case of minerals other than minor minerals, such percentage of the royalty paid during the 
5:112:8319:20:21:72:543:431:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:financial year as may be prescribed by the Central Government; and  
5:113:8385:21:31:72:512:410:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(b) in case of minor minerals, such amount as may be prescribed by the State Government; 
5:114:8473:31:20:108:542:379:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:The new draft says, “for the purpose of granting a mining lease in respect of any notified 
5:115:8564:20:21:72:543:359:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:minerals, the state government shall select, through auction by a method of competitive bidding, 
5:116:8661:21:21:72:542:338:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:including e-auction, an applicant who satisfies the eligibility conditions.” So it cleared the way for 
5:117:8764:21:20:72:543:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the auction of iron ore and other non-coal minerals. Aiming to improve transparency in allocation 
5:118:8862:20:21:72:542:297:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and  to  get  fair  share  of  the value  of  minerals  for  the  government,  the  new  bill  prescribed 
5:119:8968:21:21:72:543:276:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:competitive bidding by auction for the allocation of mining leases. The proposed method has its 
5:120:9064:21:20:72:542:255:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:roots in the National Mineral Policy 2005 (Hoda Committee), constituted by erstwhile Planning 
5:121:9158:20:21:72:542:235:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Commission, Government of India. It says that “the scheme envisages that the successful bidder 
5:122:9253:21:21:72:543:214:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:will conduct the exploration and prospecting work at his own risk and cost. In case there is any 
5:123:9350:21:21:72:542:193:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:find, he will have to abide by the bid conditions which could be in the form of a production share,

5:125:9551:20:21:72:543:152:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:act  made  the  offence  of  illegal  mining  a  cognizable  offence.  The  bill  enabled  the  State

6:131:10031:31:21:108:543:657:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Mining taxation regime of iron and coal in India is in a state of flux. Particularly, the current 
6:132:10129:21:20:72:543:636:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:methodology of royalty estimation for mining sector requires a relook. The mining royalty regime 
6:133:10226:20:21:72:542:616:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in India is onerous. India has one of highest royalty rates in the world. Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand 
6:134:10327:21:21:72:543:595:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:have the significant share of iron and coal deposits in India. Though there has been an increasing 
6:135:10426:21:20:72:543:574:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:trend in the regime shift in mining royalty away from the tonnage royalty regime to ad valorem, 
6:136:10522:20:21:72:543:554:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the   rationalization of   rates   to   internationally   competitive   rates   has   not   yet   materialized 
6:137:10632:21:21:72:542:533:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(Chakraborty, 2015). Every three years, the royalty rates are revised upwards in India. In ferrous 
6:138:10730:21:20:72:543:512:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:royalty  regime,  though  there  has  been  a  shift  from  tonnage  to ad  valorem,  the  base  estimation 
6:139:10838:20:21:72:542:492:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:suffers from discretion in deciding the grade content (ʎ1,2,3...n in  the  following  formula)  of  the

6:147:11244:31:21:108:543:256:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:There  is  a  regime  shift  in  ferrous  royalty  since  2012.  Prior  to  2012,  the  Fe  royalty was 
6:148:11348:21:20:72:542:235:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:estimated on the basis of tonnage method. The grade percent was different for ore lumps and fines, 
6:149:11447:20:21:72:543:215:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and also within each category. The recent royalty rate for iron is as high as 15 per cent ad valorem

7:161:11898:35:20:108:543:520:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We  have  explored  two  data  sources  to  arrive  at  the  fiscal  proceeds  from  mining  sector: 
7:162:11999:20:21:72:543:500:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Finance Accounts and individual State Budgets. As the Finance Accounts data do not contain the 
7:163:12094:21:21:72:543:479:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mining proceeds at disaggregated levels, we have explored the State Budget documents to extract 
7:164:12189:21:20:72:546:458:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the disaggregated budget heads related to mining using a recent methodology of "budget tagging2”.  
7:165:12287:20:21:72:542:438:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The budget tagging analysis intends to identify the budget codes that are relevant to mining actions; 
7:166:12389:21:21:72:543:417:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and report such revenue heads related to mining operations. However, the negative inferences from 
7:167:12483:21:21:72:543:396:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:this exercise reinforced that the fiscal space from mining to State exchequer is negligible, less than 
7:168:12586:21:20:72:543:375:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:10 per cent, in both new states and no relevant budget heads with appropriations are available at 
7:169:12680:20:35:72:517:355:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:disaggregated levels in the State Budgets, other than what is reported in Finance Accounts.   
7:170:12771:35:21:108:542:320:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:Methodologically, we have used an encompassing criteria for selecting the “mining tags” 
7:171:12858:21:20:72:543:299:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in  the  revenue  budget  of  the  States, incorporating different  phases  of  mining  operations,  viz., 
7:172:12963:20:21:72:546:279:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:prospecting (which involves reconnaissance and detailed exploration), development and operation.  
7:173:13061:21:21:72:543:258:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:For  instance,  this  analysis  defines  mining  revenues  from different  phases  of  mining,  viz.,  (i) 
7:174:13167:21:20:72:543:237:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:reconnaissance permit fee, (ii) prospecting fee, (iii) dead rent, (iv) royalties and some other levies 
7:175:13270:20:21:72:543:217:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:are levied at the different stages of a mining operation. However, the inference from the budget 
7:176:13367:21:21:72:543:196:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:tagging analysis revealed that the time series data on revenue from tax and nontax sources other 
7:177:13463:21:43:72:421:175:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:than mining royalty and fees is not available in the budget documents3.   
7:178:13533:43:9:72:218:132:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:                                                           
7:179:13591:9:15:72:520:123:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:2 The budget tagging is a recent methodology used to prepare climate responsive budgeting (CRB). However in 
7:180:13696:15:8:72:289:108:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:CRB, the tagging is confined to expenditure budgets.  
7:181:13747:8:15:72:508:100:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:33 The taxes (direct and indirect) collected from mining firms are unavailable in budget documents. We have 
7:182:13854:15:11:72:532:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:therefore collated the details of direct and indirect taxes paid by the mining companies from the PROWESS CMIE 
7:183:13965:11:0:72:104:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:dataset. 
8:184:13974:0:21:108:542:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We have therefore decided to use Finance Accounts data, as the disaggregation exercise 
8:185:14057:21:21:72:542:688:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:using the budget tagging methodology to identify the “mining tags” left  us  with  insignificant 
8:186:14154:21:20:72:543:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:additional  inferences.  This  disaggregated  exploration  is also not  helpful  to  analyse  the  link 
8:187:14257:20:21:72:542:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:between fiscal   proceeds   from mining and   its   utilisation on local   area   development   and 
8:188:14356:21:21:72:542:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rehabilitation. There is no proceeds under mining in the State budgets, earmarked so far to redress 
8:189:14455:21:21:72:542:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:spatial  or  human  inequalities. This  is  not  to  understate  the  relevance  of  budget  tagging 
8:190:14555:21:20:72:543:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:methodology,  all we  wanted  to  highlight is  the  irrelevance  of  this  methodology  in  identifying 
8:191:14658:20:21:72:543:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mining tags. However, the new policy formulation based on DMF in MMDR Act 2015 is in anvil 
8:192:14748:21:21:72:543:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to link the mining proceeds to the benefit of local populace, and the DMF provisions could be a 
8:193:14844:21:35:72:322:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:plausible budget head to study such links in future.

10:226:16654:20:21:72:543:523:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:growth. The contribution of mining sector to the economic growth has been on the decline. The 
10:227:16746:21:21:72:543:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:industrial sector in India consists of three sub-sectors: (i) manufacturing, (ii) mining and quarrying 
10:228:16849:21:21:72:542:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and (iii) electricity, gas and water supply. During the year 2013-14, the share of the industry sector 
10:229:16952:21:20:72:540:460:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was about 26.1 per cent and the ‘mining and quarrying’ sub-
10:230:17043:20:21:72:543:440:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sector had a contribution of 1.9 per cent (Table 1). Mining sector provides basic and strategic raw

11:249:17979:21:21:72:543:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(Figure  4). The  declining  trend  of  share  of  mining  sector  in  the  GSDP  across  States  affects  the

11:251:18183:20:21:72:540:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:consistent performers since 2004-05 with an average contribution of around 10% between 2004-

11:258:18672:31:21:108:543:280:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:After the bifurcation of States, the new States gained in terms of mining than the parental

11:260:18863:20:21:72:542:239:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:evidences do not suggest that creation of new states led to any distinctive fiscal agency, in terms 
11:261:18963:21:21:72:542:218:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of enhancing the fiscal autonomy from mining proceeds as both States rely  around half of their 
11:262:19058:21:21:72:543:197:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:revenue from intergovernmental fiscal transfers. The Figure 5 revealed that Bihar has not seen a 
11:263:19153:21:20:72:543:176:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:change in share since 2004-05, i.e. 0.1% of GSDP, while Figure 6 revealed that Madhya Pradesh

13:290:20579:30:21:108:543:193:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The empirical analysis of impact of mining activity on the socioeconomic development of 
13:291:20667:21:21:72:543:172:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the region is an elusive area of research. While several studies analyzed the resource curse problem 
13:292:20767:21:20:72:542:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:from national economy’s perspective, a  few  studies  have attempted  to  look  for  the  problem  of 
13:293:20867:20:21:72:542:131:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:resource-curse  at  the  disaggregated  level  of  district. A Policy  Research  Working  Paper  of  the 
13:294:20972:21:21:72:542:110:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:World Bank (Loayza et al, 2013) shows that mining activity in Peru has had a positive impact on 
13:295:21068:21:0:72:543:89:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:local  communities  in  terms  of  higher  economic  growth  and  a  better  performance  on  human 
14:296:21170:0:21:72:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:development indicators. The analysis tries to compare the performance of a mining district with a 
14:297:21268:21:21:72:543:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:non-mining district in the same mineral producing province and non-mining in the non-mineral 
14:298:21361:21:20:72:543:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:producing  province.  The  analysis  reveals  higher  inequalities  across  districts  stemming  from  the 
14:299:21468:20:21:72:542:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relatively better performance of the producing district, which counteracts the benefits and becomes 
14:300:21568:21:21:72:543:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:a   potential   source   of   societal   tensions.   The   alleviated   poverty   levels   persist   despite   the 
14:301:21683:21:31:72:358:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:redistributive programmes to uplift the local communities.  
14:302:21741:31:20:108:542:574:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Another  study  is  in  the  Indian  context  that  attempts  to  do  a  district-level  analysis  of  the 
14:303:21848:20:21:72:542:554:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Maoist conflict in India (Hoelscher et al, 2012). The major finding of their study is that the districts 
14:304:21951:21:21:72:543:533:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:with the highest percentage of SC/ST population are the most affected by Maoist operations. Most 
14:305:22048:21:20:72:542:512:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:socio-economic and government capacity factors only marginally explain the conflict issue. The 
14:306:22143:20:21:72:542:492:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:relationship between mining and violence is observed to be positive, but is weak. The findings also 
14:307:22242:21:21:72:543:471:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:revealed that it is not a lack of development per se that triggers conflict, but the development that 
14:308:22343:21:21:72:543:450:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:disregards  the  interests  of  the  most  vulnerable  inhabitants  of  land  and  provides  no  safeguard 
14:309:22450:21:20:72:543:429:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:against corruption or other illegal and unjust practices.  The extensive literature on civil conflict 
14:310:22552:20:21:72:542:409:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cites  strong  illustrations  of  civil  conflicts  originating  from  appropriation  of  rents  from  natural 
14:311:22663:21:21:72:542:388:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:resources  that  impedes  economic  growth  and  severely  impairs  the  economic  and  socio-political 
14:312:22767:21:30:72:546:367:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:environment of the country in the long-run (Ross, 2004a, 2004b; de Soysa and Binningsbø, 2009).

14:316:23152:20:21:72:540:275:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the globe, one is bound to see striking overlaps. A significant number of resource-abundant Sub-

14:318:23353:21:21:72:543:233:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:percentile on all six indicators. Empirical evidences across globe suggests that it seems to be a case 
14:319:23454:21:20:72:543:212:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:where  the  availability  of  natural  wealth  has  become  the  main  source  of  economic  and  political 
14:320:23562:20:21:72:542:192:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:instability;  of  foreign  private  and  public competitiveness;  and  of  rent-seeking  behaviour  in 
14:321:23665:21:21:72:542:171:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:vulnerable states, with all its accompanying features of  attempts at illegal  extraction, leading to 
14:322:23767:21:30:72:186:150:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:soaring poverty levels.  
14:323:23791:30:21:108:542:120:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Against this backdrop we carry out our preliminary analysis of the socio-economic impacts

15:328:24275:21:20:72:543:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:brings  out  an  interesting  finding that the  resource-rich  states  perform  badly  on  the  growth  and 
15:329:24382:20:21:72:542:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:development. Presently, both the states have an HDI value lower than the national average on all

16:392:26867:24:21:108:542:314:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Despite  being  endowed  with  rich  reserves  of  minerals,  the  states  have  not  been  able  to 
16:393:26968:21:20:72:543:293:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:utilize its resource wealth to set the trajectory of growth and development. In fact, a closer look at 
16:394:27071:20:21:72:543:273:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the indicators reveals that the two states are among the poorest performing states in India on human 
16:395:27172:21:21:72:542:252:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:development. But we need to study the data at a district-disaggregated level in order to find the 
16:396:27269:21:31:72:303:231:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:impact of mining on socio-economic outcomes. 
16:397:27313:31:20:108:543:200:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  district-level  data  on four indicators  namely, effective literacy  rate,  infant  mortality 
16:398:27413:20:21:72:543:180:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rate, total fertility rate, and institutional deliveries, are listed below in Table 5 and 6, for the 16 
16:399:27516:21:21:72:543:159:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:districts of Chhattisgarh and 18 districts of Jharkhand respectively. So for the purpose of finding 
16:400:27616:21:20:72:542:138:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the worst pockets, those districts have been selected that perform worse than the respective state 
16:401:27715:20:21:72:542:118:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:figures. Not only does this reflect the intra-state spatial inequalities but also brings to the table the 
16:402:27821:21:21:72:543:97:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:dire need of policy measures to alleviate the existing gaps on the development in order to achieve 
16:403:27920:21:0:72:542:76:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:inclusive  growth.  Those  figures  are  highlighted  under  each  indicator  where  the  performance  is 
17:404:28028:0:21:72:542:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:worse than the respective state average. We observed that more than half of the districts in each 
17:405:28124:21:21:72:542:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:state lag far behind on development where the infrastructure for the provision of basic health and 
17:406:28222:21:20:72:542:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:education facilities seems to be in a shambles. Extending the analysis further, the districts with the 
17:407:28325:20:21:72:543:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:highest share of Scheduled Tribe (ST) population (highlighted figures under last columns of Table 
17:408:28423:21:21:72:542:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:5 and 6) are also seen to be the districts which are the among the worst performers on the above 
17:409:28520:21:21:72:543:605:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mentioned four indicators, with an exception of the district of Bastar and Korba in Chhattisgah, 
17:410:28616:21:20:72:543:584:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and the districts of Ranchi and Purbi (East) Singhbhum in Jharkhand. The ST population, mostly 
17:411:28711:20:21:72:543:564:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rural  dwellers,  lives  in  relatively  isolated  and  inaccessible  areas  and  is  highly  deprived  and 
17:412:28819:21:21:72:543:543:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:marginalized.  In  fact,  eight  of  the  tribal  groups  of  the  state  of  Jharkhand  namely;  Asur,  Birhor, 
17:413:28932:21:20:72:543:522:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Birajia, Korwa, Savar, Pahariya (Baiga), Mal Pahariya and Souriya Pahariya have been declared 
17:414:29026:20:21:72:542:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:as  particularly  vulnerable  tribal  Groups  (PTGs).  They  live  in  small,  dispersed  and  inaccessible 
17:415:29134:21:21:72:540:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:habitations  (Economic  Survey  of  Jharkhand  2013-14).  The  districts  identified  are  mineral-

19:538:31585:30:21:108:542:320:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:This reveals a preliminary evidence that the extensive mining activities carried out in the 
19:539:31677:21:20:72:543:299:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:districts have not yielded socio-economic gains to the districts and the finding is contrary from the 
19:540:31778:20:21:72:543:279:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:results  given  in  literature  that  supports  higher  economic  performance  for  the  mining  districts 
19:541:31885:21:21:72:543:258:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(Loayza et al, 2013) and the reason for the same can be the complex interplay of economic, social 
19:542:31983:21:20:72:542:237:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and political factors operational in the Indian context. We attempt to explore these reasons in the 
19:543:32083:20:31:72:135:217:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:next section. 
19:544:32096:31:31:108:275:186:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:V. WHY RESOURCE CURSE? 
19:545:32118:31:20:108:543:155:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  finding  in  the  preceding  section  is  certainly  an  illustration  of  what  is  termed  as 
19:546:32219:20:21:72:543:135:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:‘resource curse’ i.e. the abundance of resources does not  translate  into  improved  growth  and 
19:547:32316:21:21:72:543:114:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:development of the regions endowed with the mineral wealth. The reasons that can be identified 
19:548:32411:21:0:72:542:93:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for  the  abysmal  performance  of  the  resource-rich  districts could  be inadequate  investment  in 
20:549:32516:0:21:72:542:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:building up the requisite physical and human infrastructure, the presence of crony capitalism that 
20:550:32615:21:31:72:546:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:perpetuates corruption and siphons resources off the state, and the persisting problem of “conflict”.  
20:551:32717:31:21:108:543:657:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Exploring further into these reasons show that the problem faced by the states is resource 
20:552:32808:21:20:72:542:636:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:curse  and,  to  be  more  specific,  resource  (mis)appropriation. It  is also  significant to  analyse  the 
20:553:32916:20:21:72:543:616:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:effectiveness of public spending on health and education in the state and also for rural development 
20:554:33017:21:21:72:543:595:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:especially when the states have a significantly high rural population, around 76 per cent for both 
20:555:33114:21:30:72:461:574:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the states (for details, see Economic Survey 2013, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh).  
20:556:33193:30:31:108:220:544:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:V.1: Crony Capitalism 
20:557:33214:31:21:108:543:513:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:Conceptually, crony capitalism is a ‘regulatory-capture collusion’ (Bo, 2006; Albino et al, 
20:558:33306:21:20:72:542:492:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2013). A phenomenon  plaguing  the  Indian  economy,  the  mining  sector  in  particular,  is  crony 
20:559:33407:20:21:72:543:472:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:capitalism. Despite efforts to bring increased accountability and transparency to functioning at all 
20:560:33508:21:21:72:543:451:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:levels of the economy, the official announcement of the recent losses to the extent of Rs 1.86 lakh 
20:561:33607:21:21:72:542:430:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:crores  in  allocation  of  coal  blocks  since  1993  (Report  of  the  Comptroller  and  Auditor  General 
20:562:33715:21:20:72:542:409:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(CAG) of India). This is a reflection of the extent of crony capitalism. Not only are rules and laws 
20:563:33814:20:21:72:542:389:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:completely  overlooked  or  compromised  with,  such  practices  increase  the  extent  of  elite capture 
20:564:33919:21:21:72:542:368:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:through rampant rent-seeking. The wealth from such rent-seeking activities is then used to distort 
20:565:34018:21:20:72:542:347:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:decisions in the allocation of resources, in a lure of potentially higher wealth generation from such 
20:566:34120:20:31:72:177:327:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:allocations in future.  
20:567:34143:31:21:108:542:296:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In the context of the mining sector, the recent scandal in allocation of 216 coal blocks since 
20:568:34238:21:20:72:543:275:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1993 points to the state of affairs where principles were sacrificed in distributing national wealth, 
20:569:34338:20:21:72:542:255:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to meet the vested interests. The mineral under scrutiny was coal, which serves more than half of 
20:570:34434:21:21:72:543:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  electricity  needs  of  the  country  and  is  important  in  manufacture  of  cement,  steel  and  other 
20:571:34545:21:21:72:543:213:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:manufacturing products. What is even striking is that despite holding substantial reserves of coal, 
20:572:34643:21:20:72:542:192:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the country continues to rely on imports to an extent of 20-25 per cent in recent years, in order to 
20:573:34744:20:35:72:406:172:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:meet its total requirements (Ministry of Coal, Government of India).  
20:574:34813:35:21:108:543:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Even  though efforts were  made  to  allocate coal  blocks  in  a  transparent  manner  through 
20:575:34909:21:20:72:543:116:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:open competitive bidding in public auctions, the  end results (now exposed) amounted to severe 
20:576:35004:20:21:72:542:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:losses  to  the  exchequer (Reports  from  the  Special  CBI  court  judgment,  2015).  Stemming  from 
20:577:35107:21:0:72:539:75:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:such  unfair  corporate  practices  is  illegal  mining  activities  being  conducted  in  the  resource-
21:578:35214:0:21:72:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:abundant sates of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, West 
21:579:35309:21:21:72:543:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Bengal  and  Maharashtra.  The  revenues  generated  are  funding  the  armed  insurgency  operations 
21:580:35411:21:20:72:543:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India) while also causing loss in coal production that 
21:581:35507:20:21:72:543:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:has a direct bearing on in infrastructure development in the country. An annual loss to the extent

21:585:35742:30:21:108:542:544:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The logic of accumulation by dispossession is one of the plausible reasons for the problem 
21:586:35833:21:21:72:542:523:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of “conflict” in the newly created states of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh.  The roots of the problem 
21:587:35932:21:21:72:543:502:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:can be traced to the displacement of local inhabitants of land endowed with rich mineral resources, 
21:588:36032:21:20:72:441:481:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:without due compensation and provision of decent livelihood opportunities.

21:590:36107:21:21:108:543:440:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Mining-induced  displacement  and  resettlement  (MIDR)  poses  major  risks  to  societal 
21:591:36198:21:20:72:542:419:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sustainability and this was getting increasingly recognized in policy circles. To cite World Bank 
21:592:36296:20:21:72:543:399:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(2001), “(i)nvoluntary resettlement under development projects, if unmitigated, often gives rise to 
21:593:36396:21:21:72:542:378:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:severe economic, social and environmental risks: productive systems are dismantled; people face

21:595:36588:20:21:72:543:337:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:environments  where  their  productive  skills  may  be  less  applicable  and  the  competition  for

23:678:39404:21:20:72:542:223:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:conflicts  in Chhattisgarh,  44.44  per  cent  occurred  in  district  Sukma (in  South  Bastar  region) in 
23:679:39510:20:21:72:542:203:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2013 (Figure  5). Similarly,  in  Jharkhand,  out  of  total  conflicts  in  2013,  21 per  cent  occurred  in

25:754:41532:21:21:72:543:451:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Act mandates the holder of a mining lease to pay to the DMF, in addition to the royalty, an amount 
25:755:41631:21:21:72:542:430:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:which  is  equivalent  to  such  percentage  of  the  royalty  paid,  not  exceeding  one-third  of  royalty. 
25:756:41741:21:20:72:543:409:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand are one of the few states where contribution of mining sector to the 
25:757:41837:20:21:72:542:389:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:GSDP is relatively higher than other states and also expected to increase in future (Strategy Paper 
25:758:41936:21:21:72:543:368:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for Ministry of Mines, 2011). MMDR 2015 also stipulates that the proceeds from coal e-auctioning 
25:759:42033:21:20:72:543:347:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:should also be linked to DMF. There are  ambiguities regarding the process of linking the fiscal 
25:760:42130:20:21:72:543:327:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:space  generated  from  coal  auctions  to  redress  spatial  inequalities.  However,  the MMDR  2015 
25:761:42232:21:21:72:542:306:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:policy announcements call for creating fiscal space and utilizing it to solve the problem of resource 
25:762:42334:21:30:72:110:285:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:curse5.  
25:763:42342:30:31:108:356:255:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:VI.1: Nascent Estimates of Coal Auction Proceeds  
25:764:42391:31:21:72:543:224:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015 has been implemented and aims at creating more 
25:765:42484:21:25:72:542:203:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:fiscal  space  for  the  mining  sector. Three  rounds  of  coal  auctions  have  been  completed  in  India 
25:766:42592:25:9:72:218:178:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:                                                           
25:767:42650:9:16:72:542:169:7:g_d0_f9:10:Times New Roman:55 Pursuant  to  the  judgments,  guidelines  were  laid  down  for  e-auction  of  Schedule  II  and Schedule  III  coal  mines. 
25:768:42779:16:12:72:542:153:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:Schedule  II  coal  mines  are  42  of  the  204  cancelled  blocks  (redefined  as  Schedule  I  coal  blocks/mines)  that  are 
25:769:42908:12:11:72:542:141:10:g_d0_f8:10:Times New Roman:‘Producing’ and ‘Ready to produce’ coal mines. Schedule III coal mines are the other 32 substantially developed of 
25:770:43022:11:12:72:542:130:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:the Schedule I coal mines, meant for specified end-use, and the Central Government may add any other Schedule I 
25:771:43134:12:11:72:542:118:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:coal  mine  for the purposes of specified end-use in this category, in public interest (for details, see The Coal Mines 
25:772:43254:11:12:72:542:107:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:(Special  provisions)  Act,  2015).   The  Coal  Auction  Methodology for  coal  blocks is  followed  for  the  two  sectors 
25:773:43377:12:11:72:542:95:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:namely,  Regulated  Sectors  and  Non-Regulated  Sectors  (for  details,  see  Approach  paper, Auctions,  Government  of

26:775:43592:0:21:72:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:recently and significant revenue has been generated from the new e-auction process of coal. The

27:826:45284:30:20:108:543:420:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:As  is  brought  out  clearly  from  the Table  13,  the  six  coal-rich  states, especially 
27:827:45376:20:21:72:542:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Chhattisgarh7 and  Jharkhand,  are  expected  to  benefit  significantly  from  the  proceeds  of  coal 
27:828:45479:21:21:72:542:379:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:auctions.  This  expanded  fiscal  space from  coal  auction  proceeds can  contribute  in  reducing  the 
27:829:45585:21:20:72:543:358:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:social infrastructure deficit of the states. While the e-auction procedure has so far been transparent 
27:830:45687:20:21:72:543:338:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and  fetched  a  fair  amount  of  revenue  to  the  government,  there  have  been  complaints  regarding 
27:831:45794:21:31:72:202:317:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:“cartelization” in bidding.  
27:832:45821:31:21:100:542:286:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:India has adopted the e-auction route that is practiced in other countries including USA and 
27:833:45912:21:20:72:542:265:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Indonesia. However, as India has onerous royalty regime and one of the highest royalty rates in 
27:834:46007:20:21:72:543:245:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the world, linking the auction procedure to royalty  can be detrimental to the competitiveness of 
27:835:46105:21:31:72:478:224:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the sector and in turn revenue argumentation to the State exchequer in the long run.  
27:836:46190:31:20:100:542:193:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Having said that, the policy initiative to link the fiscal space from mining proceeds to the 
27:837:46283:20:21:72:543:173:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:spatial  and  human  development  is  a  positive  step  to  redress  the  inequalities,  and  for  inclusive 
27:838:46393:21:21:72:543:152:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:development  process. This  is theoretically comparable  to  the “oil-to-cash  policy” initiative 
27:839:46490:21:33:72:543:131:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:implemented  in  Uganda  (Moss  and  Majerowicz,  2013).  In  Uganda,  a  certain  proportion  of  the 
27:840:46593:33:9:72:218:98:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f9:                                                           
27:841:46651:9:15:72:537:89:6:Times New Roman:10:g_d0_f8:7 Of the three blocks successfully auctioned, Chhattisgarh’s Bhaskarpara mine is expected to fetch Rs.712 Crores to 
27:842:46766:15:0:72:111:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:the State. 
28:843:46778:0:21:72:543:709:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:government receipts from oil revenues are transferred instantly to the bank accounts of families 
28:844:46875:21:21:72:543:688:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:via mobile network, after deducting a small tax share. The aim is to create a participatory approach 
28:845:46976:21:20:72:543:667:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:whereby oil becomes a common property and an  active constituency of citizens is created. And 
28:846:47070:20:21:72:542:647:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:international  cross-country  studies  have  strong  evidence  that such  revenue  proceeds  linked  to 
28:847:47174:21:21:72:542:626:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:redress  capability  deprivation are  usually  spent  on  healthcare,  education  and  opening  of  small

28:851:47307:30:21:100:540:513:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We  examined  the political  economy  context  of  the  newly  generated  fiscal  space  from  e-
28:852:47404:21:20:72:542:492:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:auction mining proceeds in India and its intended use to redress the resource curse problem. Such 
28:853:47500:20:21:72:542:472:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:policy imperatives are comparable to the global initiatives like recent “oil-to-cash policy”. Within 
28:854:47600:21:21:72:542:451:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the  constraints  of  data  paucity, our  analysis  cautions  that  existing  roadmap  of  DMF  (MMDR, 
28:855:47703:21:21:72:542:430:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2015) to plough back a portion of royalty and fresh e-auction mining proceeds exclusively to the 
28:856:47798:21:30:72:326:409:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:mining districts may exacerbate spatial inequalities.
