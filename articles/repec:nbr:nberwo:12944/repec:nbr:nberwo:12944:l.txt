2:25:1097:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:We document key facts about marriage and divorce, comparing trends through the past 150 years and
2:26:1194:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:outcomes across demographic groups and countries.  While divorce rates have risen over the past 150
2:27:1293:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:years, they have been falling for the past quarter century.  Marriage rates have also been falling, but
2:28:1396:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:more strikingly, the importance of marriage at different points in the life cycle has changed, reflecting
2:29:1501:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:rising age at first marriage, rising divorce followed by high remarriage rates, and a combination of
2:30:1601:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:increased longevity with a declining age gap between husbands and wives.  Cohabitation has also
2:31:1696:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:become increasingly important, emerging as a widely used step on the path to marriage.  Out-of-wedlock
2:32:1798:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:fertility has also risen, consistent with declining "shotgun marriages".  Compared with other countries,
2:33:1902:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:F:marriage maintains a central role in American life.  We present evidence on some of the driving forces
2:34:2004:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:F:causing these changes in the marriage market: the rise of the birth control pill and women's control
2:35:2104:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:F:over their own fertility; sharp changes in wage structure, including a rise in inequality and partial closing
2:36:2213:14:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:F:of the gender wage gap; dramatic changes in home production technologies; and the emergence of
2:37:2307:14:14:72:540:420:12:Times:12:Times:F:the internet as a new matching technology.  We note that recent changes in family forms demand a
2:38:2403:14:14:72:540:406:12:Times:12:Times:F:reassessment of theories of the family and argue that consumption complementarities may be an increasingly
2:39:2509:14:28:72:539:392:12:Times:12:Times:F:important component of marriage.  Finally, we discuss the welfare implications of these changes.

3:57:3079:0:27:104:543:712:144:Times:144:Times:?: The family is not a static institution.  In recent decades, marriage rates have fallen, divorce 
3:58:3175:27:28:68:505:685:144:Times:144:Times:B:rates have risen, and the defining characteristics of marriage have changed.  The economic 
3:59:3266:28:28:68:533:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:approach to the family seeks to explain these trends by reference to models that can also explain 
3:60:3364:28:27:68:540:629:144:Times:144:Times:B:how and why families form.  Gary Becker’s 1981 Treatise on the Family proposed a theory based 
3:61:3458:27:28:68:513:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:on “production complementarities”, in which husband and wife specialize in the market and 
3:62:3548:28:27:68:525:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:domestic spheres, respectively, and hence are more productive together than apart.  Production 
3:63:3643:27:28:68:514:547:144:Times:144:Times:B:complementarities also arise in the production and rearing of one’s own children.  However, 
3:64:3735:28:28:68:541:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:production complementarities—at least as initially described—are decreasingly central to modern 
3:65:3831:28:27:68:535:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:family life.  Increased longevity and declining fertility mean that most of one’s adult life is spent 
3:66:3933:27:28:68:512:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:without one’s own children in the household, and the rise in marital formation at older ages, 
3:67:4027:28:27:68:528:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:including re-marriage, means that many families form with no intention of producing children.  
3:68:4122:27:28:68:536:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:Moreover, increases in female labor force participation suggest that household specialization has 
3:69:4220:28:28:68:299:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:either declined or taken on a different meaning. 
3:70:4269:28:27:104:527:353:144:Times:144:Times:?:These changes have come about as what is produced in the home has been dramatically 
3:71:4353:27:28:68:538:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:altered both by the emergence of labor-saving technology in the home and by the development of 
3:72:4448:28:27:68:529:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:service industries that allow much of what was once provided by specialized homemakers to be 
3:73:4541:27:28:68:533:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:purchased in the market.  The availability of birth control and abortion has affected the potential 
3:74:4641:28:28:68:533:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:consequences of sex both in and out of marriage, while changes in divorce laws have altered the 
3:75:4737:28:27:68:545:215:144:Times:144:Times:B:terms of the marital bargain.  These forces also have important feedback effects, changing the pool 
3:76:4837:27:28:68:542:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:of marriageable singles across the age distribution, thereby affecting search, marriage, remarriage, 
3:77:4938:28:27:68:323:160:144:Times:144:Times:B:and the extent of “churning” in the marriage market. 
3:78:4991:27:28:104:531:133:144:Times:144:Times:?:To remain relevant to the 21st century, the theory of the family will need to push beyond 
3:79:5081:28:28:68:540:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:the production of own children and traditional notions of specialization, and must seek to uncover 
3:80:5180:28:0:68:500:77:144:Times:144:Times:B:the forces that yield the modern family form.  This may mean re-conceiving the notion of 
4:81:5271:0:27:68:518:712:144:Times:144:Times:B:household production or, as we argue, extending models of the family beyond the notion of a 
4:82:5363:27:28:68:464:685:144:Times:144:Times:B:household-based firm, and toward emphasizing motivations such as consumption, 
4:83:5441:28:28:68:540:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:complementarities, and insurance as central to marriage.  Furthermore, the theory of the family as 
4:84:5540:28:27:68:537:629:144:Times:144:Times:B:originally developed was a theory of household formation rather than a theory of legal marriage.  
4:85:5638:27:28:68:525:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:Couples have become increasingly likely to form households without entering into a marriage, 
4:86:5731:28:27:68:543:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:adding a new dimension for considering decisions surrounding family formation.  This article lays 
4:87:5829:27:28:68:526:547:144:Times:144:Times:B:the groundwork for a reconsideration of the theory of the family, by describing the tremendous 
4:88:5924:28:28:68:500:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:changes in family forms, pointing to some of their driving forces, and suggesting ways of 
4:89:6014:28:27:68:412:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:expanding our thinking about the family to better understand its future.

4:93:6119:27:28:104:536:381:144:Times:144:Times:?:Figure 1 lays out some facts about marriage and divorce in the United States over the last 
4:94:6210:28:27:68:531:353:144:Times:144:Times:B:150 years: the divorce rate—measured as the number of new divorces each year, on a per capita 
4:95:6304:27:28:68:517:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:basis—has risen, while the marriage rate has fluctuated around a relatively stable mean.  The 
4:96:6398:28:27:68:539:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:timing of these changes suggests that social and economic factors strongly influence the marriage 
4:97:6496:27:28:68:530:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:market.  Marriage rates rose during, and in the wake of, the two World Wars and fell during the 
4:98:6592:28:28:68:546:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:Great Depression.  The divorce rate fell during the Depression and spiked following World War II. 
4:99:6690:28:27:104:538:215:144:Times:144:Times:?:Developments since the 1960s appear to reflect more subtle influences, and have been the 
4:100:6779:27:28:68:511:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:focus of heated political debate as the heyday of marriage gave way to rapid social change.  
4:101:6872:28:27:68:516:160:144:Times:144:Times:B:Divorce rates rose sharply, doubling between the mid-1960s and the mid-1970s.  During this 
4:102:6963:27:28:68:518:133:144:Times:144:Times:B:period, family life was potentially altered by many factors: the rise of the women’s liberation 
4:103:7059:28:28:68:531:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:movement, the sexual revolution, the Supreme Court’s granting of marriage as a “fundamental” 
4:104:7152:28:0:68:544:77:144:Times:144:Times:B:right under the U.S. Constitution and thus the abolition of laws restricting marriage between races, 
5:105:7255:0:27:68:519:712:144:Times:144:Times:B:the elimination in many states of fault-based divorce, and a sharp rise in women’s labor force 
5:106:7350:27:28:68:517:685:144:Times:144:Times:B:participation.  Yet when viewed over the longer time period, we see that while the 1970s had 
5:107:7443:28:28:68:529:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:exceptionally high divorce rates, the low divorce rates in previous decades were also somewhat 
5:108:7538:28:27:68:539:629:144:Times:144:Times:B:exceptional.  Fitting a simple trend line to the divorce rate between 1860 and 1945 (excluding the 
5:109:7637:27:28:68:524:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:post-World War II surge in divorce), as shown in Figure 1, suggests that some of the run-up in 
5:110:7732:28:27:68:540:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:divorce in the latter third of the 20th century reflects the divorce rate reverting to levels consistent 
5:111:7837:27:28:68:536:547:144:Times:144:Times:B:with earlier trends, following unusually low divorce in the 1950s and early 1960s.  Indeed, based 
5:112:7935:28:28:68:511:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:on extrapolation, family scholars as early as the turn of the last century had predicted future 
5:113:8031:28:27:68:543:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:divorce rates like those actually witnessed in the 1980s (Coontz, 2005).  While the 1970s overshot 
5:114:8130:27:28:68:546:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:the trend, the subsequent fall in divorce has put the divorce rate back on the trend-line and by 2005 
5:115:8232:28:27:68:512:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:the annual divorce rate projected by the pre-1946 trend is quite close to actual divorce rates. 
5:116:8328:27:28:104:505:409:144:Times:144:Times:?:Figure 1 also points to a remarkable and often overlooked fact: the divorce rate per 
5:117:8413:28:28:68:546:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:thousand people actually peaked in 1981, and has been declining over the ensuing quarter century.  
5:118:8512:28:27:68:527:353:144:Times:144:Times:B:The divorce rate in 2005—3.6 divorces per thousand people—is at its lowest level since 1970.  
5:119:8606:27:28:68:526:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:The number of people entering marriage, as a proportion of the population, in the U.S. has also 
5:120:8702:28:27:68:538:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:been falling for the past 25 years, and the marriage rate is currently at its lowest point in recorded 
5:121:8805:27:28:68:546:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:history.  Marriage rates rose as the divorce rate rose, but reached an earlier peak in 1972.  Yet even 
5:122:8908:28:28:68:540:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:when measuring the number of divorces relative to the “at-risk population” (that is, those who are 
5:123:9007:28:27:68:543:215:144:Times:144:Times:B:currently married), we see a similar decline in the divorce rate over the last 25 years falling from a 
5:124:9110:27:28:68:533:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:peak of 22.8 divorces per 1,000 married couples in 1979 to 16.7 divorces in 2005. The sustained 
5:125:9206:28:27:68:537:160:144:Times:144:Times:B:decline in divorce over the past quarter century provides an ideal testing ground for assessing the 
5:126:9306:27:28:68:529:133:144:Times:144:Times:B:validity of alternative theories of why the divorce rate rose in the late 1960s and into the 1970s; 
5:127:9406:28:0:68:409:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:unfortunately, such tests are mostly absent from the existing literature. 
6:128:9482:0:27:104:540:712:144:Times:144:Times:?:Figure 2 analyzes data from marital histories to assess the fate of first marriages, grouping 
6:129:9576:27:28:68:516:685:144:Times:144:Times:B:them by the decade in which the wedding occurred.  For those marriages that occurred in the 
6:130:9668:28:28:68:519:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:1950s through the 1970s, we know a lot about their eventual outcomes, and the figure clearly 
6:131:9761:28:27:68:529:629:144:Times:144:Times:B:shows that the probability of divorce before each anniversary rose for each successive marriage 
6:132:9857:27:28:68:538:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:cohort until the 1970s.  For marriages that occurred in the 1970s, 48 percent had dissolved within 
6:133:9956:28:27:68:504:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:25 years, roughly confirming—for this specific cohort—the popular claim that “half of all 
6:134:10046:27:28:68:538:547:144:Times:144:Times:B:marriages end in divorce.”1  Yet for first marriages that occurred in the 1980s, the proportion that 
6:135:10147:28:28:68:540:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:had dissolved by each anniversary was consistently lower, and it is lower again for marriages that 
6:136:10246:28:27:68:524:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:occurred in the 1990s.  While it will take several more decades for the long-term fate of recent 
6:137:10343:27:28:68:511:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:marriages to be realized, it appears likely that fewer than half of these recent marriages will 
6:138:10439:28:27:68:113:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:dissolve. 
6:139:10449:27:28:104:538:409:144:Times:144:Times:?:Much of the concern over the high divorce rates in the 1970s stemmed from the impact of 
6:140:10537:28:28:68:518:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:divorce on children.  Indeed, as divorce rose in the 1960s and 1970s so too did the number of 
6:141:10631:28:27:68:529:353:144:Times:144:Times:B:children involved in each divorce.  In the 1950s, the average divorce involved 0.78 children; by 
6:142:10728:27:28:68:506:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:1968 that number had risen to 1.34.  However, since 1968, the average number of children 
6:143:10817:28:27:68:534:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:involved in each divorce has fallen dramatically, and in 1995 the average was 0.91, only slightly 
6:144:10915:27:28:68:532:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:above the 1950 average.  Similar patterns are evidence in data on the proportion of divorces that 
6:145:11013:28:28:68:532:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:involve any children.  While the collection of detailed national divorce statistics ceased in 1995, 
6:146:11113:28:27:68:519:215:144:Times:144:Times:B:recent data from individual states suggest that the number of children involved in divorce has 
6:147:11208:27:37:68:306:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:continued to decline over the subsequent decade. 
6:148:11257:37:7:212:215:151:144:Times:144:Times:?:                                                 
6:149:11305:7:16:68:514:144:42:Times:100:Times:F:1 There are many alternative sources for this claim.  The simplest approach is to take the ratio of the number of 
6:150:11419:16:12:68:537:128:100:Times:100:Times:F:divorces to the number of marriages, which would correspond to the proportion of marriages ending in divorce if the 
6:151:11535:12:11:68:544:116:100:Times:100:Times:F:marriage market were in a steady state (an assumption that Figure 1 shows to be markedly false).  “Life tables” offer a 
6:152:11655:11:12:68:541:105:100:Times:100:Times:F:somewhat more refined, but related approach, adding age-specific divorce rates to come up with the probability that a 
6:153:11773:12:11:68:539:93:100:Times:100:Times:F:marriage ends in divorce.  This approach effectively simulates the likely course of a cohort were age-specific divorce 
6:154:11892:11:12:68:535:82:100:Times:100:Times:F:rates measured at a point in time to remain unchanged.  Yet as Figure 2 makes clear, there are strong cohort-specific 
6:155:12010:12:0:68:299:70:100:Times:100:Times:F:influences on these rates, confounding such an inference. 
7:156:12070:0:27:104:524:712:144:Times:144:Times:?:There exists substantial controversy—and uncertainty—about the impact of divorce on 
7:157:12154:27:28:68:526:685:144:Times:144:Times:B:children.  While children from divorced households fare worse along a range of outcomes than 
7:158:12247:28:28:68:527:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:those from intact households, this observation does not speak to the policy-relevant question of 
7:159:12344:28:27:68:536:629:144:Times:144:Times:B:whether those children would have been better off if their parents had not divorced.  The conflict 
7:160:12443:27:28:68:547:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:in these households may be such that children are actually better served by their parents divorcing.  
7:161:12545:28:27:68:544:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:Thus, comparisons of the “happily married” with the “unhappily divorced” are likely irrelevant for 
7:162:12644:27:28:68:545:547:144:Times:144:Times:B:those choosing between an unhappy marriage and an unhappy divorce.  Moreover, the difficulty in 
7:163:12740:28:28:68:532:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:establishing a causal link between divorce decisions and children’s outcomes is compounded by 
7:164:12834:28:27:68:522:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:the possibility that the type of parents and households that end up divorced are likely different 
7:165:12932:27:28:68:529:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:from those who do not.  These differences may themselves lead to worse outcomes for children 
7:166:13025:28:27:68:515:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:even if the parents were to remain married.  Additionally, unobserved negative shocks to the 
7:167:13118:27:28:68:543:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:family may both lead to divorce and negative outcomes for children, further confounding attempts 
7:168:13215:28:28:68:169:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:at causal inference.   
7:169:13238:28:27:104:536:353:144:Times:144:Times:?:With entry into marriage falling, but exit through divorce also falling, what has happened 
7:170:13329:27:28:68:544:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:to the proportion of the population living in a married relationship?  Figure 3 shows the proportion 
7:171:13430:28:27:68:520:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:of the population currently married, by age, for every other decade, from 1880 to the present.  
7:172:13526:27:28:68:522:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:Four striking patterns emerge from this analysis.  First, the proportion married at each age has 
7:173:13623:28:28:68:539:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:been surprisingly stable over more than a century; the pattern in 1980, for instance, is remarkably 
7:174:13723:28:27:68:516:215:144:Times:144:Times:B:similar to that in 1880.  Second, consistent with our earlier analysis, the 1960s were unusual, 
7:175:13819:27:28:68:529:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:reflecting not only more marriage, but earlier marriage.  Third, the data for 2000 suggest a very 
7:176:13917:28:27:68:523:160:144:Times:144:Times:B:different pattern, with marriage less prevalent among young adults, but more prevalent among 
7:177:14010:27:28:68:544:133:144:Times:144:Times:B:those at older ages.  This trend toward rising age at first marriage represents both a return to, and a 
7:178:14114:28:28:68:529:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:departure from, earlier patterns.  The return to earlier patterns is the later age at which men first 
7:179:14216:28:0:68:521:77:144:Times:144:Times:B:marry; in 1890, the median age at which men first married was 26, declining to 23 by the mid-
8:180:14311:0:27:68:513:712:144:Times:144:Times:B:1950s, and then returning to 27 in 2004.  The departure is that the age gap between men and 
8:181:14403:27:28:68:528:685:144:Times:144:Times:B:women has declined through the past century, with the median age at which women first marry 
8:182:14495:28:28:68:386:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:rising from 22 in 1890 to 26 in 2004 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2005). 
8:183:14560:28:27:104:510:629:144:Times:144:Times:?:This shrinking gap between the ages of husbands and wives helps explain the fourth 
8:184:14643:27:28:68:534:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:striking fact in Figure 3: those over 65 are now much more likely to be married than at any other 
8:185:14741:28:27:68:539:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:time in the past.  In fact, those over 65 are now as likely to be married as are those aged 16 to 65.  
8:186:14844:27:28:68:541:547:144:Times:144:Times:B:The larger proportion of people married at older ages reflects greater life expectancy for both men 
8:187:14944:28:28:68:536:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:and women and a decreasing gap in the difference between men’s and women’s life expectancy.  
8:188:15037:28:27:68:541:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:Additionally, some of this increase in the proportion of those over 65 who are married stems from 
8:189:15135:27:28:68:523:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:an increase in the proportion marrying at older ages, with these later-age marriages potentially 
8:190:15232:28:27:68:539:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:being facilitated by a thicker remarriage market in recent decades that allowed greater remarriage 
8:191:15331:27:28:68:307:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:following either divorce or the death of a spouse. 
8:192:15382:28:28:104:543:381:144:Times:144:Times:?: This changing age profile of marriage also points to the declining role of fertility and child-
8:193:15477:28:27:68:532:353:144:Times:144:Times:B:rearing in married life.  In 1880, 75% of married people lived in a household in which their own 
8:194:15574:27:28:68:528:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:children were present.  That proportion has fallen steadily over the past 125 years, and by 2005 
8:195:15671:28:27:68:544:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:only 41% of married people had their own children present in their household.  This dramatic shift 
8:196:15770:27:28:68:499:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:reflects the confluence of many factors, including declining fertility, increased longevity, 
8:197:15863:28:28:68:531:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:increasing rates of marriage at later, post-childbearing ages, rising non-marital births, and rising 
8:198:15964:28:27:68:110:215:144:Times:144:Times:B:divorce.

9:204:16185:27:28:68:541:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:and in many cases may be succeeded by divorce, remarriage, and for some people further “churn” 
9:205:16280:28:27:68:507:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:may follow.  Figure 4 illustrates, showing marital status through the life cycle for the 1940-
9:206:16374:27:28:68:545:547:144:Times:144:Times:B:45 birth cohorts—the most recent group for which complete marital histories through to age 55 are

9:208:16482:28:27:104:542:491:144:Times:144:Times:?:By age 30, six out of seven of these men and women had entered into a first marriage; one-
9:209:16572:27:28:68:544:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:sixth of these marriages had already ended, and of these, one-half had subsequently remarried.  By 
9:210:16671:28:27:68:542:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:age 45, only 7 percent remained never married and around one-third of first marriages had ended.  
9:211:16769:27:28:68:537:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:The share of the previously married population that had subsequently remarried remained around 
9:212:16864:28:28:68:536:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:one half.  By age 55, all but 5 percent of this cohort had married at some point, and 53 percent of 
9:213:16964:28:27:68:305:353:144:Times:144:Times:B:the population remained in intact first marriages. 
9:214:17015:27:28:104:530:326:144:Times:144:Times:?:Table 1 provides further detail on life cycle patterns both comparing the 1940-45 cohort 
9:215:17104:28:27:68:521:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:with the cohort born a decade later and exploring variation by demographic group in the more 
9:216:17197:27:28:68:544:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:recent cohort.  In order to allow us to explore this younger cohort (those born in 1950-55), Table 1 
9:217:17298:28:28:68:518:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:assesses outcomes through to age 45.  Thus, the first two columns compare the 1940-45 birth 
9:218:17390:28:27:68:523:215:144:Times:144:Times:B:cohort discussed in the previous paragraph with the subsequent cohort born between 1950 and 
9:219:17482:27:28:68:528:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:1955.  These data suggest that by age 45 the more recent cohort was less likely to have married 
9:220:17578:28:27:68:538:160:144:Times:144:Times:B:and more likely to have divorced than the preceding cohort.  Moreover, conditional on divorcing, 
9:221:17675:27:28:68:531:133:144:Times:144:Times:B:those in the more recent cohort exit their marriages faster and have slightly lower, but still high, 
9:222:17776:28:28:68:543:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:levels of remarrying within five years of divorce.  Based on life patterns like these, Cherlin (1981) 
9:223:17878:28:0:68:457:77:144:Times:144:Times:B:described the increasingly typical life course as “marriage, divorce, remarriage.” 
10:224:17962:0:27:104:507:712:144:Times:144:Times:?:As Ellwood and Crane (1990) have noted in this journal (and as a huge literature in 
10:225:18046:27:28:68:509:685:144:Times:144:Times:B:sociology has discussed) there is a stark racial divide in family structure.  This difference is 
10:226:18143:28:28:68:520:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:evident in Table 1.  This racial divide is driven almost entirely by lower and slower entry into 
10:227:18240:28:27:68:546:629:144:Times:144:Times:B:marriage by blacks, rather than higher or more rapid divorce.  By age 45, nearly one-in-four blacks 
10:228:18340:27:28:68:538:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:born between 1950 and 1955 had never married, while the equivalent statistic for whites was one-
10:229:18436:28:27:68:544:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:in-ten.  Yet, among those marrying, divorce rates for blacks and whites were similar, and blacks in 
10:230:18536:27:28:68:546:547:144:Times:144:Times:B:fact spent more time in their marriages before divorce than whites.  As with first marriage, re-entry 
10:231:18638:28:28:68:474:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:into marriage among blacks was both rarer, and typically slower than that of whites. 
10:232:18723:28:27:104:536:491:144:Times:144:Times:?:Figure 5 shows that for much of the first half of the twentieth century, blacks were in fact 
10:233:18816:27:28:68:520:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:more likely than whites to marry.  In the 1940s and 1950s, the proportion of whites who were 
10:234:18909:28:27:68:507:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:married rose, closing and ultimately reversing the racial gap in marriage.  The incidence of 
10:235:19002:27:28:68:547:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:marriage has subsequently declined for all groups, but most dramatically among blacks: 71 percent 
10:236:19100:28:28:68:529:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:of blacks born in 1945 had married by age 25, compared with 51 percent of those born in 1955. 
10:237:19194:28:27:104:532:353:144:Times:144:Times:?:While the changing racial gap in the incidence of marriage largely reflects differences in 
10:238:19285:27:28:68:518:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:entry into marriage, not divorce rates, differences across education levels reflect an emerging 
10:239:19381:28:27:68:538:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:“divorce gap.”  Table 1 highlights a 10 percentage point gap between college graduates and those 
10:240:19478:27:28:68:543:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:with less than a college education in the probability of a first marriage surviving to age 45, and the 
10:241:19581:28:28:68:542:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher divorce propensity among those without a college degree is too large to simply reflect their 
10:242:19681:28:27:68:542:215:144:Times:144:Times:B:earlier entry into marriage.  Furthermore, conditional on divorcing, those without a college degree 
10:243:19781:27:28:68:489:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:are less likely to remarry, and if they do remarry, they are again more likely to divorce. 
10:244:19872:28:27:104:525:160:144:Times:144:Times:?:Although the data in Table 1 show similar marriage rates across education levels, these 
10:245:19960:27:28:68:483:133:144:Times:144:Times:B:data hide interesting differences which become evident only when the data are further 
10:246:20046:28:28:68:546:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:disaggregated by gender.  For men, those with a college degree are 3 percentage points more likely 
10:247:20145:28:0:68:524:77:144:Times:144:Times:B:to have married by age 45 than those without, while female college graduates are 3 percentage 
11:248:20241:0:27:68:521:712:144:Times:144:Times:B:points less likely to have married.  Yet, marriage rates for college-educated women have been 
11:249:20335:27:28:68:544:685:144:Times:144:Times:B:rising over time and—while still below those of their less-educated peers—are at an historic high.  
11:250:20435:28:28:68:532:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:In the late nineteenth century almost half of all college-educated women never married (Coontz, 
11:251:20531:28:27:68:528:629:144:Times:144:Times:B:2005).  In the 1960 census, 29 percent of the college-educated women in their sixties had never 
11:252:20627:27:28:68:529:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:married.  By contrast, four decades later, the equivalent proportion was only 8 percent.  Indeed, 
11:253:20725:28:27:68:546:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:highly educated women are now as likely—and may eventually be more likely—to marry than less 
11:254:20818:27:28:68:516:547:144:Times:144:Times:B:educated women.  The difficulty in comparing marriage rates across education groups is that 
11:255:20910:28:28:68:542:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:highly-educated women marry much later than do those with less education, so comparisons early 
11:256:21005:28:27:68:538:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the life span tend to show that those with less education are more likely to have married.  Even 
11:257:21105:27:28:68:525:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:so, the 2004 American Community Survey suggests that college-educated women between the 
11:258:21193:28:27:68:539:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:ages of 35 and 40, were as likely to have ever married as those without a college degree and were 
11:259:21291:27:28:68:491:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:10 percentage points more likely to be currently married than their less educated peers.  
11:260:21381:28:28:104:534:381:144:Times:144:Times:?:Table 1 shows that divorced women are less likely than divorced men to remarry—a fact 
11:261:21467:28:27:68:529:353:144:Times:144:Times:B:that has been pointed to by scholars concerned with women’s poverty following divorce.  Once 
11:262:21560:27:28:68:544:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:again, this average masks big differences in remarriage rates by education (not shown in Table 1).  
11:263:21660:28:27:68:542:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:Among those without a college degree, divorced women are as likely as divorced men to remarry: 
11:264:21755:27:28:68:536:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:71 percent of both groups have remarried by age 45.  In contrast, nearly three-quarters of college-
11:265:21854:28:28:68:540:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:educated divorced men remarry, compared with two-thirds of college-educated divorced women.  
11:266:21947:28:27:68:543:215:144:Times:144:Times:B:Counter to the conventional wisdom that it is women with the least resources that are less likely to 
11:267:22048:27:28:68:532:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:remarry, it appears to be those best equipped to cope outside of marriage who are more likely to 
11:268:22145:28:27:68:270:160:144:Times:144:Times:B:eschew marriage the second time around.

12:272:22202:0:27:104:495:712:144:Times:144:Times:?: So far we have discussed patterns in formal marriage.  Yet the decision to form a 
12:273:22284:27:28:68:535:685:144:Times:144:Times:B:household with another is increasingly becoming decoupled from the decision to marry.  Indeed, 
12:274:22379:28:28:68:544:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:in recent decades, cohabitation has emerged as an important institution, as both a precursor to, and 
12:275:22480:28:27:68:525:629:144:Times:144:Times:B:sometimes a substitute to, marriage.  This decoupling of domestic arrangements from the legal 
12:276:22574:27:28:68:525:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:(and social) status of relationships raises important new questions for economic analysis of the 
12:277:22671:28:27:68:544:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:family, as early models treated marriage and household formation almost identically.  These labels 
12:278:22770:27:28:68:516:547:144:Times:144:Times:B:also have substantive economic content, determining the default allocation of property rights 
12:279:22864:28:28:68:519:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:following separation, tax treatment of the couple, and eligibility for both social programs and 
12:280:22960:28:27:68:538:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:employment-related family benefits.  Growing social acceptance of non-marital relationships and 
12:281:23056:27:28:68:536:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:the changing legal institutions surrounding marriage, leads one to ask: what distinguishes marital 
12:282:23155:28:27:68:465:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:relationships from cohabiting relationships, and how has this distinction changed? 
12:283:23238:27:28:104:538:409:144:Times:144:Times:?:However empirical analysis related to these questions is beset by a simple difficulty: until 
12:284:23331:28:28:68:483:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:recently, few available data collections contain information on non-marital cohabiting 
12:285:23418:28:27:68:516:353:144:Times:144:Times:B:relationships.  The available data documenting the rise of cohabitation suggests that levels of 
12:286:23514:27:28:68:546:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:cohabitation were low prior to 1970 and that they have grown at a roughly constant rate since then, 
12:287:23614:28:27:68:535:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:with perhaps faster growth in the past decade.  This assessment comes from three sources.  First, 
12:288:23712:27:28:68:508:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:in 1995 the Current Population Survey started allowing people to identify themselves as an 
12:289:23803:28:28:68:542:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:“unmarried partner” of the householder (rather than just “partner/roommate”).  These data suggest 
12:290:23901:28:27:68:533:215:144:Times:144:Times:B:that cohabitation rates among adults have risen from 2.9 percent in March 1995 to 4.7 percent in 
12:291:23998:27:28:68:526:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:March 2005.  Second, a similar change was made for the Census, which recorded a 3.5 percent 
12:292:24090:28:0:68:546:160:144:Times:144:Times:B:cohabitation rate among adults in 1990 and 5 percent in 2000, one-in-nine of whom were same-sex 
13:293:24189:0:27:68:539:712:144:Times:144:Times:B:couples (with roughly equal numbers involving male and female same-sex couples).2  Finally, for 
13:294:24285:27:28:68:494:685:144:Times:144:Times:B:earlier periods, Fitch et al. (2005) analyze Census data and calculate a proxy measure of 
13:295:24375:28:28:68:517:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:cohabitation, the number of persons of the opposite sex sharing living quarters (“POSSLQ”), 
13:296:24467:28:27:68:538:629:144:Times:144:Times:B:documenting that there was virtually no rise in cohabitation between 1880 and 1970, followed by 
13:297:24563:27:28:68:281:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:roughly constant growth in the years hence. 
13:298:24607:28:27:104:534:574:144:Times:144:Times:?:The 2002 National Survey of Family Growth found that 50 percent of women aged 15 to 
13:299:24691:27:28:68:521:547:144:Times:144:Times:B:44 had cohabited at some point and 9 percent were currently cohabiting.  In the United States, 
13:300:24786:28:28:68:526:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:cohabitation has thus far largely been a stepping stone toward marriage, with most people who 
13:301:24880:28:27:68:528:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:cohabit either ending their relationship or marrying within a few years.  Among those currently 
13:302:24976:27:28:68:522:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:cohabiting, the vast majority expect their cohabitation to lead to marriage.  Indeed, 34 percent 
13:303:25073:28:27:68:539:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:enter cohabitation having announced a plan to marry.  Even among the remaining two-thirds who 
13:304:25167:27:28:68:543:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:enter cohabitation without being engaged, 36 percent were “almost certain” that they would marry 
13:305:25264:28:28:68:535:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:their current partner, and another 46 percent thought that there was either “a pretty good chance” 
13:306:25363:28:27:68:509:353:144:Times:144:Times:B:or “a 50-50 chance” of marrying their partner (National Survey of Fertility Growth, 2002).  
13:307:25455:27:28:68:526:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:Contrary to stereotypes, men and women express similar expectations about their likelihood of 
13:308:25549:28:27:68:522:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:marrying their cohabiting partners.  Such beliefs regarding their future likelihood of marriage, 
13:309:25646:27:28:68:537:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:however, are not always warranted.  Among those couples who were cohabiting in January 1997, 
13:310:25739:28:28:68:515:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:slightly more than half were no longer together 5 years later, and only a quarter had married. 
13:311:25834:28:27:104:500:215:144:Times:144:Times:?:While most cohabitations do not end in marriage, most marriages are preceded by 
13:312:25914:27:28:68:534:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:cohabitation.  Among those entering first marriages in the early 2000s, 59 percent had cohabited 
13:313:26011:28:27:68:526:160:144:Times:144:Times:B:with their future spouse prior to marriage.  Pre-marital cohabitation with one’s future spouse is 
13:314:26109:27:28:68:500:133:144:Times:144:Times:B:even more common among those who have previously divorced, with 75 percent of those

13:316:26241:7:16:68:507:98:42:Times:100:Times:F:2 The 1990 Census cohabitation estimates need to be interpreted with some caution as the Census “corrected” 
13:317:26349:16:12:68:529:82:100:Times:100:Times:F:responses by same-sex couples, either recoding the gender of one partner, or their relationship status.  For more on

14:319:26541:0:27:68:538:712:144:Times:144:Times:B:remarrying in the early 2000s preceding their wedding with a period of cohabitation.  (Moreover, 
14:320:26638:27:28:68:537:685:144:Times:144:Times:B:this differential is robust to controlling for the higher age of most remarriages.)  This trend to pre-
14:321:26741:28:28:68:538:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:marital household formation may also explain some of the rise in measured age at first marriage.  
14:322:26839:28:27:68:544:629:144:Times:144:Times:B:Cohabiting couples represent a bit more than half of all first marriages, and these couples typically 
14:323:26941:27:28:68:523:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:entered into domesticity about two years prior to marriage, thus high recent rates of premarital 
14:324:27038:28:27:68:446:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:cohabitation may explain up to a year of the rise in mean age at first marriage. 
14:325:27119:27:28:104:533:547:144:Times:144:Times:?:While it might seem that cohabiting before marriage should reduce uncertainty about the 
14:326:27207:28:28:68:546:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:quality of a couple’s match, U.S. couples who cohabit before marriage have been historically more 
14:327:27305:28:27:68:506:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:likely to divorce than those who do not.  This pattern may reflect differential selection into 
14:328:27400:27:28:68:531:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:cohabitation, as those who live together prior to marriage may be doing so because they are less 
14:329:27497:28:27:68:521:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:certain of the quality of their match, or because they stand to gain less from marriage (Lillard, 
14:330:27595:27:28:68:523:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:Brien, and Waite, 1995; Brien, Lillard, and Stern, 2006).  In other words, those who choose to 
14:331:27690:28:28:68:486:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:cohabit may have been more likely to divorce even if they had not lived together first.  
14:332:27779:28:27:68:544:353:144:Times:144:Times:B:Cohabitation may also be responsible for some of the reduction in divorce rates witnessed over the 
14:333:27878:27:28:68:540:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:past 25 years as separations that previously occurred while legally married may now occur during 
14:334:27975:28:27:68:529:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:pre-marital cohabitation.  The difficulty in making any of these attributions convincingly lies in 
14:335:28074:27:28:68:514:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:constructing a counterfactual: Would the cohabitating couple still have separated if they had 
14:336:28168:28:28:68:147:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:married earlier? 
14:337:28185:28:27:104:542:215:144:Times:144:Times:?:Cohabitation is clearly evolving, and some couples are currently entering cohabitation as a 
14:338:28277:27:28:68:529:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:permanent or semi-permanent state. Among those cohabiting in 2002, a little over one-fifth had 
14:339:28372:28:27:68:529:160:144:Times:144:Times:B:been doing so for five years or more, indicating that some couples are treating cohabitation as a 
14:340:28470:27:28:68:539:133:144:Times:144:Times:B:more permanent state. While for some the decision to cohabit may reflect a lower commitment to 
14:341:28565:28:28:68:535:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:one’s partnership, for others this choice may reflect a lower value of the institutional structure of 
14:342:28667:28:0:68:518:77:144:Times:144:Times:B:marriage rather than a lower commitment.  For instance, an increasing number of dual-career 
15:343:28762:0:27:68:509:712:144:Times:144:Times:B:couples, combined with high marginal tax rates on secondary earners may face a “marriage 
15:344:28851:27:28:68:536:685:144:Times:144:Times:B:penalty”, while increasing social acceptance of cohabitation may have diminished social stigma.  
15:345:28948:28:28:68:543:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:Additionally, the incremental value of formal marriage in enforcing intertemporal commitments is 
15:346:29045:28:27:68:533:629:144:Times:144:Times:B:smaller when divorce laws allow one partner to unilaterally dissolve the relationship.  Similarly, 
15:347:29144:27:28:68:524:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:pre-nuptial contracts have reduced the role of family law as an important default for allocating 
15:348:29241:28:27:68:165:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:property at divorce. 
15:349:29262:27:28:104:516:547:144:Times:144:Times:?:It remains an open question as to whether cohabitation might evolve from the largely 
15:350:29347:28:28:68:536:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:transitional role it currently plays in the U.S. to being a viable alternative to marriage. Turning to 
15:351:29450:28:27:68:513:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:international comparisons, as we do in the next section, we see that cohabitation is poised to 
15:352:29545:27:28:68:385:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:become an important family form, in several comparable nations.

15:357:29635:27:28:104:521:326:144:Times:144:Times:?:Family life varies widely across industrialized nations.  Table 2 shows that Americans 
15:358:29722:28:27:68:536:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:marry, divorce, and remarry at rates higher than in most other countries with comparable income 
15:359:29818:27:28:68:513:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:levels.  This greater “churning” in marriage is reminiscent of the cross-country labor market 
15:360:29912:28:28:68:497:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:literature, in which the United States is known for its greater labor market entry and exit. 
15:361:30005:28:27:104:540:215:144:Times:144:Times:?:Marriage appears to be more central and cherished in the United States than in many other 
15:362:30095:27:28:68:521:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries.  Italy is similar to the U.S. in many respects—both countries have low cohabitation 
15:363:30190:28:27:68:537:160:144:Times:144:Times:B:rates and few consider marriage to be an outdated institution, although the United States is by far 
15:364:30290:27:28:68:521:133:144:Times:144:Times:B:the greatest outlier in the low proportion agreeing with that sentiment.  Yet a major difference 
15:365:30387:28:28:68:517:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:arises when examining divorce rates.  In Italy divorce rates are extremely low and those who 
15:366:30480:28:0:68:504:77:144:Times:144:Times:B:divorce in Italy remain divorced (which accounts for why the proportion of the population 
16:367:30573:0:27:68:542:712:144:Times:144:Times:B:“currently divorced” remains at levels similar to the United States).  While Americans reveal their 
16:368:30673:27:28:68:544:685:144:Times:144:Times:B:willingness to exit bad marriages in their high rates of divorce, only 43 percent agree that “divorce 
16:369:30775:28:28:68:501:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:is usually the best solution when a couple can’t seem to work out their marriage options,” 
16:370:30866:28:27:68:459:629:144:Times:144:Times:B:compared with an overwhelming majority in every other country including Italy. 
16:371:30945:27:28:104:537:602:144:Times:144:Times:?:Sweden provides a particularly stark counterpoint to the United States and Italy, and is an 
16:372:31037:28:27:68:521:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:interesting example of the “Nordic model” of the family.  Swedish marriage rates are low and 
16:373:31130:27:28:68:526:547:144:Times:144:Times:B:cohabitation rates are high.  Yet fertility—and particularly non-marital fertility—remains quite 
16:374:31227:28:28:68:543:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:high, consistent with an emerging social norm in Sweden that childbirth and formal marriage need 
16:375:31324:28:27:68:514:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:not be linked.  Other high-income countries may be moving toward the Nordic model, albeit 
16:376:31414:27:28:68:539:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:slowly.  For instance, France, Canada, and the United Kingdom have cohabitation rates similar to 
16:377:31511:28:27:68:322:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:Sweden and high rates of out-of-wedlock childbirth. 
16:378:31563:27:28:104:536:409:144:Times:144:Times:?:Another point in which the United States seems exceptional is the relatively young age at 
16:379:31653:28:28:68:533:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:which women are giving birth.  The age at which women have children has been rising in all the 
16:380:31748:28:27:68:534:353:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries, and in 2002, the average age at child birth was over 30 in Italy and Sweden, and 29 or 
16:381:31846:27:28:68:422:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher everywhere, save the United States where the average age was 27. 
16:382:31918:28:27:104:533:298:144:Times:144:Times:?:Earlier, we documented the declining importance of children to married life—at least for 
16:383:32007:27:28:68:537:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:the United States, where today only a minority of married households include own children.  The 
16:384:32103:28:28:68:534:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:data in Table 2 suggest that this may be even more evident in other industrialized nations, where 
16:385:32201:28:27:68:517:215:144:Times:144:Times:B:the trend toward out-of-wedlock childbirth is also paired with a greater proportion of women 
16:386:32294:27:28:68:526:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:marrying at older (post-fertility) ages.  For instance, in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., France, and 
16:387:32393:28:27:68:544:160:144:Times:144:Times:B:Sweden, between a quarter and a third of marriages involved women at least 35 years old.  In Italy 
16:388:32492:27:28:68:512:133:144:Times:144:Times:B:the proportion was only 15%, partially reflecting the country’s very low rate of remarriage.  
16:389:32586:28:0:68:537:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:Moreover, aggregate fertility—whether married or not—is currently quite low in many European 
17:390:32682:0:27:68:528:712:144:Times:144:Times:B:nations, a fact that beyond portending changes in the family, points to a looming “demographic 
17:391:32777:27:28:68:194:685:144:Times:144:Times:B:crisis” in many countries.

17:394:32842:28:27:68:71:601:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
17:395:32842:27:27:104:538:574:144:Times:144:Times:?:The economic approach to the family seeks to explain how and why families form, and in 
17:396:32929:27:28:68:519:547:144:Times:144:Times:B:so doing, this approach highlights the potential forces that change family formation.  Couples 
17:397:33024:28:28:68:543:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:marry, and stay married, when the gains from marriage exceed the gains from being single.  These 
17:398:33121:28:27:68:535:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:gains come from production complementarities (such as household specialization and the raising 
17:399:33216:27:28:68:540:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:of one’s children), the benefits of risk pooling, and from consumption complementarities (such as 
17:400:33314:28:27:68:523:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:from the joint consumption of public goods and from shared leisure activities).  Thus, reduced 
17:401:33409:27:28:68:528:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:market discrimination against women and technological advances that allow much of what was 
17:402:33500:28:28:68:544:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:once produced by skilled-labor in the home to be purchased or produced with little skill reduce the 
17:403:33600:28:27:68:527:353:144:Times:144:Times:B:benefits from specialization of spouses in the home and market spheres, thereby decreasing the 
17:404:33695:27:28:68:537:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:gains from marriage. Simultaneously, increasing leisure time and wealth along with the changing 
17:405:33791:28:27:68:461:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:landscape defining sexual relations potentially raises the gains from consumption 
17:406:33873:27:28:68:544:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:complementarities.  These changes in tastes, technology, and the institutional or legal environment 
17:407:33973:28:28:68:491:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:have altered gains from marriage.  With an eye to these drivers of family formation and 
17:408:34061:28:27:68:533:215:144:Times:144:Times:B:dissolution, we now review some of the fundamental changes in the purpose, function, and form 
17:409:34155:27:28:68:268:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:of family life over the past half century.

17:411:34200:27:28:104:264:133:144:Times:144:Times:?:The Technology of Birth Control 
17:412:34232:28:28:104:525:105:144:Times:144:Times:?:The Economist (1999) cited the birth control pill as the invention that “defined the 20th 
17:413:34322:28:0:68:523:77:144:Times:144:Times:B:century.”  In 1960, the first birth control pill was approved by the FDA and diffused rapidly to 
18:414:34422:0:27:68:532:712:144:Times:144:Times:B:married woman; by 1965, 41 percent of married women under 30 who used contraceptives were 
18:415:34512:27:28:68:513:685:144:Times:144:Times:B:on “the pill” (Goldin and Katz, 2002).  However, laws limiting the distribution to unmarried 
18:416:34605:28:28:68:523:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:women slowed broader diffusion of the pill until the early 1970s, when such laws were finally 
18:417:34699:28:27:68:491:629:144:Times:144:Times:B:overturned by the Supreme Court in Eisenstadt v. Baird.  This ruling quickly facilitated 
18:418:34788:27:28:68:520:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:distribution of the pill to unmarried women and by 1976, three-quarters of ever-contracepting 
18:419:34882:28:27:68:408:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:single 18 and 19 year olds had used the pill (Goldin and Katz, 2002).   
18:420:34954:27:28:104:546:547:144:Times:144:Times:?:The birth control pill was an important innovation in two respects: it was far more effective 
18:421:35048:28:28:68:533:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:than other forms of birth control and, unlike many other forms of contraception, the pill allowed 
18:422:35146:28:27:68:537:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:contraceptive decisions to be made privately by a woman, rather than jointly with her partner.  In 
18:423:35245:27:28:68:541:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:the early 1970s, women also gained greater access to abortion through the legalization of abortion 
18:424:35344:28:27:68:536:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:by five states in 1970 and nationwide through the Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. Wade (410 
18:425:35439:27:28:68:543:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:U.S. 113) three years later.  Both the birth control pill and abortion decreased the probability of an 
18:426:35542:28:28:68:524:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:unwanted pregnancy.  This improved control over fertility changed the timing of marriage and 
18:427:35635:28:27:68:543:353:144:Times:144:Times:B:births, and also facilitated the increase in women’s accumulation of human capital by reducing the 
18:428:35734:27:28:68:371:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:risk of disruption to women’s education or labor market plans. 
18:429:35797:28:27:104:522:298:144:Times:144:Times:?:The pill also reduced the cost of waiting to marry, by allowing sex outside of marriage 
18:430:35885:27:28:68:516:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:with little fear of an unwanted pregnancy.  The lower cost of delaying marriage led to longer 
18:431:35979:28:28:68:535:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:courtships, and courtship was also more informative (due to greater sexual contact).  Thus, those 
18:432:36077:28:27:68:517:215:144:Times:144:Times:B:entering marriage did so with less uncertainty about their compatibility, thereby reducing the 
18:433:36172:27:28:68:545:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:number of bad matches.  One effect of this change was to lower the probability of divorce; another 
18:434:36271:28:27:68:533:160:144:Times:144:Times:B:effect was to encourage others to wait longer to marry, as fears receded that those left unmarried 
18:435:36370:27:28:68:533:133:144:Times:144:Times:B:by their mid-twenties would confront an adversely-selected set of potential spouses.  Examining 
18:436:36466:28:28:68:533:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:college-educated women, Goldin and Katz (2002) demonstrate that differential access to the pill 
18:437:36562:28:0:68:504:77:144:Times:144:Times:B:across states and cohorts robustly predicts subsequently higher age at first marriage, lower 
19:438:36658:0:27:68:523:712:144:Times:144:Times:B:divorce, and lower marriage rates.  They also demonstrate qualitatively similar, albeit smaller, 
19:439:36755:27:28:68:265:685:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects from the legalization of abortion. 
19:440:36797:28:28:104:533:657:144:Times:144:Times:?:While greater access to birth control and abortion did reduce unplanned pregnancies, out-
19:441:36886:28:27:68:542:629:144:Times:144:Times:B:of-wedlock births increased following these technological innovations.  Akerlof, Yellen, and Katz 
19:442:36984:27:28:68:533:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:(1996) address this puzzle by arguing that women’s newfound control over pregnancy increased 
19:443:37077:28:27:68:522:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:pressure on them to engage in premarital sexual relations and reduced their ability to extract a 
19:444:37174:27:28:68:540:547:144:Times:144:Times:B:commitment to marry in the event of a pregnancy.  Thus, those who did not adopt the pill, or who 
19:445:37271:28:28:68:497:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:suffered contraceptive failure, gained the option of choosing between abortion instead of 
19:446:37361:28:27:68:545:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:pregnancy, but if choosing pregnancy, typically lost the offer of a subsequent “shotgun marriage.”  
19:447:37461:27:28:68:506:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:Akerlof, Yellen, and Katz document a decline between the late 1960s and late 1980s in the 
19:448:37551:28:27:68:539:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:percentage of parents marrying when faced with an out-of-wedlock pregnancy and argue that—at 
19:449:37644:27:28:68:536:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:least in an accounting sense—this failure to marry subsequent to pregnancy explains much of the 
19:450:37740:28:28:68:331:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:growth in out-of-wedlock births seen over this period. 
19:451:37795:28:27:104:540:353:144:Times:144:Times:?:While birth control has made sex safer in terms of an unwanted pregnancy, the emergence 
19:452:37883:27:28:68:483:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:of AIDS has made sex riskier.  Specifically, AIDS changes the benefit of sex within a 
19:453:37969:28:27:68:513:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:monogamous relationship relative to that from casual sexual encounters, which may involve 
19:454:38059:27:28:68:543:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:greater health risks, or costs of prevention through safe sex practices.  Differences in infection and 
19:455:38162:28:28:68:535:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:transmission rates across sub-groups also changes the costs of some pairings, and Francis (2006) 
19:456:38259:28:27:68:543:215:144:Times:144:Times:B:provides intriguing evidence that greater knowledge of the risk of AIDS reduces the probability of 
19:457:38358:27:28:68:525:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:men choosing same-sex partners, while increasing prevalence of same-sex partnerships among 
19:458:38449:28:27:68:508:160:144:Times:144:Times:B:women.  Recent improvements in HIV treatments have substantially reduced AIDS-related 
19:459:38535:27:28:68:511:133:144:Times:144:Times:B:mortality and Lakdawalla, Sood, and Goldman (2006) provide evidence that access to these 
19:460:38624:28:28:68:293:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:treatments partly undoes some of these trends. 
19:461:38671:28:0:104:107:77:144:Times:144:Times:?: 
20:462:38674:0:27:104:218:712:144:Times:144:Times:?:Household Technology 
20:463:38695:27:28:104:522:685:144:Times:144:Times:?:The spread of indoor plumbing and electricity in the first half of the twentieth century, 
20:464:38785:28:28:68:491:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:along with the myriad of household appliances that diffused throughout the last century 
20:465:38873:28:27:68:516:629:144:Times:144:Times:B:(particularly in the 1950s and 1960s), led to vast increases in the productivity of housework.  
20:466:38969:27:28:68:514:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:Homemakers suddenly had freezers, washing machines, dryers, steam iron, and a lucky few, 
20:467:39058:28:27:68:541:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:dishwashers, at their disposal.  Greenwood, Seshadri, and Yorukoglu (2005) document this rise in 
20:468:39155:27:28:68:540:547:144:Times:144:Times:B:household appliances over the last century and cite evidence that the time required to clean a load 
20:469:39255:28:28:68:535:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:of laundry fell from four hours using manual methods to only 41 minutes when aided by a 1940s 
20:470:39349:28:27:68:512:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:era electric washing machine and dryer.  These breakthroughs in the invention of household 
20:471:39440:27:28:68:506:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:appliances heralded a new age of freedom for housewives, freeing them of the drudgery of 
20:472:39529:28:27:68:490:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:household production and turning them into “household managers” of an electric army. 
20:473:39614:27:28:104:531:409:144:Times:144:Times:?:Electricity and household appliances are “labor-saving” in that one can now produce the 
20:474:39702:28:28:68:531:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:same bundle of home-produced goods in less time.  While substitution effects may lead to some 
20:475:39796:28:27:68:541:353:144:Times:144:Times:B:increased consumption of home-produced goods, income effects from these time-saving advances 
20:476:39889:27:28:68:505:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:may also be important, increasing the household’s consumption of both home- and market-
20:477:39976:28:27:68:545:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:produced goods.  Greenwood, Seshadri, and Yorukoglu (2005) suggest that the time-saving effects 
20:478:40072:27:28:68:540:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:of these new technologies dominated, leading women to spend less time working in the home and 
20:479:40166:28:28:68:438:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:more time in the market, thereby increasing female labor force participation. 
20:480:40244:28:27:104:528:215:144:Times:144:Times:?:Moreover, this technical change is unlikely to have been skill-neutral.  Even basic tasks 
20:481:40334:27:28:68:530:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:like laundry take much less skill with a modern washer and dryer.  (Anyone who has tried to do 
20:482:40429:28:27:68:496:160:144:Times:144:Times:B:laundry on a scrub board or rock knows that it is quite difficult!)  In turn, this lower skill 
20:483:40524:27:28:68:511:133:144:Times:144:Times:B:requirement has reduced the returns to specialization in home production.  Indeed, this skill-
20:484:40618:28:28:68:539:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:substituting technical change parallels the decline in the field of home economics, the historically 
20:485:40719:28:0:68:473:77:144:Times:144:Times:B:female-dominated subject devoted to developing skills such as sewing and cooking. 
21:486:40804:0:27:104:541:712:144:Times:144:Times:?:Additionally, a growing service sector and increasing commoditization have created ready 
21:487:40893:27:28:68:524:685:144:Times:144:Times:B:market substitutes for products that were previously the exclusive domain of home producers.  
21:488:40987:28:28:68:538:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:Perhaps most significantly, technological improvements in the mass production of food led to the 
21:489:41084:28:27:68:533:629:144:Times:144:Times:B:increased availability of factory-prepared food.  Cutler, Glaeser, and Shapiro (2003) credit these 
21:490:41183:27:28:68:544:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:innovations with the 50 percent reduction in food preparation and clean-up times for both working 
21:491:41281:28:27:68:312:574:144:Times:100:Times:B:and non-working women between 1965 and 1990. 
21:492:41325:27:28:104:523:547:144:Times:144:Times:?:These changes in household technology have implications for family formation.  If the 
21:493:41411:28:28:68:520:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:returns to specialization within a household fall, then the opportunity cost of remaining single 
21:494:41508:28:27:68:539:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:rather than marrying falls.  Moreover, in a time when men were specialized in market production, 
21:495:41605:27:28:68:541:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:and household production required specialized labor inputs, it was not surprising that women with 
21:496:41703:28:27:68:545:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:specialized market skills had less to gain from marriage, and were therefore less likely to marry.  It 
21:497:41806:27:28:68:539:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:is only as women have entered the labor market en masse that the education gap in marriage rates 
21:498:41903:28:28:68:198:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:among women has closed. 
21:499:41927:28:27:104:534:353:144:Times:144:Times:?:Consider a further implication of these changes.  Greenwood and Vandenbroucke (2005) 
21:500:42012:27:28:68:529:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:credit technological progress with reducing the workweek from 70 hours in 1830 to 41 hours in 
21:501:42106:28:27:68:495:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:2002, and Aguiar and Hurst (2007) document a rise in leisure over the past 40 years that 
21:502:42195:27:28:68:530:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:corresponds roughly to an additional 5-10 weeks of vacation per year.  As the mix of household 
21:503:42290:28:28:68:520:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:activities has shifted, optimal matching in the marriage market has likely changed.  Thus, one 
21:504:42385:28:27:68:509:215:144:Times:144:Times:B:might expect these changes to have made leisure and consumption complementarities more 
21:505:42472:27:28:68:514:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:important drivers of matching than the production complementarities emphasized by Becker 
21:506:42561:28:27:68:519:160:144:Times:144:Times:B:(1981).  For instance, while Becker had predicted that those with high wage rates will tend to 
21:507:42656:27:28:68:534:133:144:Times:144:Times:B:marry those with lower wage rates (“negative assortative mating”) because the benefits from the 
21:508:42752:28:28:68:521:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:division of labor within a household can make the earning abilities of the man and the woman 
21:509:42845:28:0:68:534:77:144:Times:144:Times:B:substitutes, this argument loses force in two-career couples.  Thus, as marriage comes to be built 
22:510:42947:0:27:68:511:712:144:Times:144:Times:B:more around consumption complementarities we might expect it to increasingly involve the 
22:511:43036:27:28:68:374:685:144:Times:144:Times:B:pairing of those with similar income and interests (Lam, 1998). 
22:512:43100:28:28:104:541:657:144:Times:144:Times:?:An alternative complementarity arises from thinking about households as insurance units.  
22:513:43190:28:27:68:528:629:144:Times:144:Times:B:While the increase in female labor force participation has reduced specialization in the home, it 
22:514:43288:27:28:68:521:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:may have increased the benefit from household risk-sharing.  As such, we may see a different 
22:515:43381:28:27:68:501:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:form of negative assortative matching, as people seek spouses whose labor income risk is 
22:516:43470:27:28:68:248:547:144:Times:144:Times:B:negatively correlated with their own.

22:519:43535:27:28:104:546:464:144:Times:144:Times:?:A large literature in labor economics (surveyed in the Spring 1997 issue of this journal) has 
22:520:43629:28:27:68:526:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:documented increasing wage inequality since the 1970s.  These changes reflect several factors, 
22:521:43724:27:28:68:535:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:including: skill-biased technical change, a declining real value of the minimum wage, and the de-
22:522:43821:28:28:68:516:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:unionization of the American workforce.  Gould and Paserman (2003) argue that this change 
22:523:43911:28:27:68:532:353:144:Times:144:Times:B:directly impacts marriage markets, raising the importance of “searching for Mr. Right.”  That is, 
22:524:44009:27:28:68:524:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:rising wage inequality has increased the returns to further search and thus increased the option 
22:525:44106:28:27:68:522:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:value of remaining unmarried.  Gould and Paserman test this effect of inequality on marriages 
22:526:44200:27:28:68:530:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:rates by examining the consequences of differences across cities in the rates at which inequality 
22:527:44298:28:28:68:538:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:grew through the 1970s and 1980s.  They find that in cities in which wage inequality rose fastest, 
22:528:44397:28:27:68:540:215:144:Times:144:Times:B:the proportion of young women who were married fell quite dramatically.  Indeed, their estimates 
22:529:44494:27:28:68:511:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggest that this rising wage inequality may account for up to one-third of the decline in the 
22:530:44589:28:27:68:273:160:144:Times:144:Times:B:marriage rate of 21 to 30 year old women. 
22:531:44631:27:28:104:521:133:144:Times:144:Times:?:Another important change in the wage structure derives from the decline in the gender 
22:532:44717:28:28:68:544:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:wage gap.  Blau and Kahn (2000) describe these changes as emanating from a decline in explicitly 
22:533:44814:28:0:68:506:77:144:Times:144:Times:B:sexist personnel policies (partly driven by the increasing reach of anti-discrimination law), 
23:534:44911:0:27:68:512:712:144:Times:144:Times:B:increased labor market experience among women (and increased returns to this experience), 
23:535:45001:27:28:68:493:685:144:Times:144:Times:B:declining occupational segregation, and de-unionization.  In the face of these trends, the 
23:536:45092:28:28:68:532:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:comparative advantage of wives in home rather than market production has declined, driving an 
23:537:45186:28:27:68:514:629:144:Times:144:Times:B:increasing share of men into home production, or reducing the value of specialization within 
23:538:45279:27:28:68:120:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:marriage.  
23:539:45290:28:27:104:524:574:144:Times:144:Times:?:Beyond possibly reducing the attractiveness of marriage, the reduction in the wage gap 
23:540:45377:27:28:68:520:547:144:Times:144:Times:B:may have other, subtle effects.  For instance, Becker, Landes, and Michael (1977) explain the 
23:541:45471:28:28:68:534:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:historically younger age at which women marry by noting that the specialized investments made 
23:542:45565:28:27:68:538:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:by women in home economics were much less useful to singles.  Indeed, as women have come to 
23:543:45657:27:28:68:520:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:invest more in market skills, so too the age at which they choose to marry has drawn closer to 
23:544:45752:28:27:68:527:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:parity with men.  Caucutt, Guner, and Knowles (2002) argue that rising returns to labor market 
23:545:45847:27:28:68:523:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:experience may also have important dynamic effects, raising the incentive for highly educated 
23:546:45941:28:28:68:536:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:women to delay the timing of fertility in favor of developing stronger prospects in both labor and 
23:547:46040:28:27:68:161:353:144:Times:144:Times:B:marriage markets.

23:549:46149:28:27:68:515:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:outcomes is that a strong reverse channel likely confounds any easy inference.  For instance, 
23:550:46243:27:28:68:530:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:women who forecast later or more fragile marriages may choose to invest more in their careers, 
23:551:46338:28:28:68:531:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:leading to better labor force outcomes for women.  As one example of such a dynamic, Johnson 
23:552:46431:28:27:68:539:215:144:Times:144:Times:B:and Skinner (1986) find that women who anticipate a future divorce are more likely to participate 
23:553:46529:27:28:68:511:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the labor market.  Similarly, Stevenson (2006) finds that unilateral divorce laws led to an 
23:554:46624:28:27:68:437:160:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase in labor force participation for both married and unmarried women.

24:558:46832:28:28:68:520:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:parameters define who is to be granted marriages, divorces, and parental rights, and articulate 
24:559:46928:28:27:68:544:629:144:Times:144:Times:B:subsequent obligations.  The law also provides a set of default property rights in case of separation

24:563:47296:28:28:68:542:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:steadily diminished.  In the 1950s some state legislatures began to repeal laws restricting marriage 
24:564:47397:28:27:68:541:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:between racial groups.  These anti-miscegenation laws were eliminated nationwide in 1967 by the 
24:565:47493:27:28:68:539:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:Supreme Court ruling in Loving v. Virginia  (388 U.S. 1).which argued that marriage was “one of

24:567:47692:27:28:68:530:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:time).  This ruling set the stage for further deregulation of marriage, including providing a legal 
24:568:47792:28:28:68:540:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:challenge to state marriage bars for those deemed “unsuitable”, such as felons, the disabled, those

24:571:48008:28:27:68:533:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:relationships by eliminating many of the legal distinctions stemming from the marital status of a 
24:572:48106:27:28:68:520:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:child’s parents.  In 1968 the Supreme Court ruling in Levy v. Louisiana (391 U.S. 68) granted 
24:573:48200:28:28:68:530:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment to illegitimate children.  Five years later, the 
24:574:48297:28:27:68:503:215:144:Times:144:Times:B:1973 ruling in Gomez v. Perez  (409 U.S. 535) overturned state laws exempting men from

25:583:49094:27:28:68:488:685:144:Times:144:Times:B:shotgun marriages. This remains an under-researched topic in need of further scrutiny.  
25:584:49182:28:28:104:548:657:144:Times:144:Times:?:During this period, states also began to consider reducing their role in divorce proceedings.  
25:585:49277:28:27:68:513:629:144:Times:144:Times:B:In the 1950s, most states required evidence of marital fault before allowing a marriage to be 
25:586:49371:27:28:68:523:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:dissolved.  Beginning in the late 1960s, many states introduced “irreconcilable differences” as 
25:587:49467:28:27:68:515:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:grounds for divorce; effectively ushering in a period of unilateral divorce—divorce upon the 
25:588:49560:27:28:68:535:547:144:Times:144:Times:B:request of either spouse, regardless of the wishes of his or her partner.  In addition to the passage 
25:589:49662:28:28:68:515:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:of unilateral divorce laws during this period, many states removed fault as a consideration in 
25:590:49757:28:27:68:505:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:property division and some states changed laws governing property division subsequent to 
25:591:49846:27:28:68:529:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:divorce.  Currently all but five states have some form of unilateral divorce and two-thirds allow 
25:592:49944:28:27:68:221:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:unrestricted unilateral divorce.  
25:593:49978:27:28:104:535:409:144:Times:144:Times:?:These legal changes fundamentally alter the basis of the marriage contract.  They remove 
25:594:50067:28:28:68:526:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:the ability to make intertemporal contracts within marriage—one spouse cannot promise not to 
25:595:50160:28:27:68:538:353:144:Times:144:Times:B:leave his or her spouse in the future. They shift the right to divorce (and hence bargaining power) 
25:596:50260:27:28:68:539:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:from the party most interested in preserving the marriage to the person who most wants out of the 
25:597:50358:28:27:68:532:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:marriage.  While the old laws had allowed divorce only if there was sufficient evidence of fault, 
25:598:50456:27:28:68:537:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:many divorces involved couples where there was mutual consent to divorce.  These couples used 
25:599:50550:28:28:68:542:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:private bargaining to determine uncontested (and often manufactured) claims of fault to present to 
25:600:50649:28:27:68:510:215:144:Times:144:Times:B:the courts. Thus, the fault-based system essentially allowed mutual consent divorce, but not 
25:601:50742:27:28:68:158:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:unilateral divorce. 
25:602:50762:28:27:104:541:160:144:Times:144:Times:?:Becker, Landes, and Michael (1977) argued that the divorce rate would be unaffected by a 
25:603:50851:27:28:68:523:133:144:Times:144:Times:B:shift from consent to unilateral divorce laws.  They argued that this shift simply represents the 
25:604:50949:28:28:68:509:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:reallocation of an existing property right from one spouse to the other—namely the right of 
25:605:51041:28:0:68:502:77:144:Times:144:Times:B:oneself or one’s spouse to remarry.  Invoking the Coase theorem, they suggested that “the 
26:606:51134:0:27:68:517:712:144:Times:144:Times:B:allocation of property rights or legal liability does not influence resource allocation when the 
26:607:51231:27:28:68:514:685:144:Times:144:Times:B:parties involved can bargain with each other at little cost.”  Yet the assumptions required for 
26:608:51327:28:28:68:518:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:Coasian bargaining, including symmetric information, transferable utility, and the absence of 
26:609:51421:28:27:68:416:629:144:Times:144:Times:B:important transaction costs, may be unrealistic for the marginal divorce. 
26:610:51495:27:28:104:542:602:144:Times:144:Times:?:Many empirical papers have investigated whether unilateral divorce laws have led to a rise 
26:611:51586:28:27:68:538:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the divorce rate with several reaching conflicting findings (Peters, 1986 and 1992, Allen 1992, 
26:612:51685:27:28:68:541:547:144:Times:144:Times:B:Friedberg 1998). Most recently, Wolfers (2006) tests these competing views by analyzing divorce 
26:613:51781:28:28:68:543:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:rates and divorce laws across U.S. states from 1956-1998.  He finds that divorce rates rose sharply 
26:614:51881:28:27:68:541:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the two years following the adoption of unilateral divorce laws, as the courts catered to pent-up 
26:615:51982:27:28:68:519:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:demand for divorce.  Subsequently, the divorce rate reverted back toward earlier levels, and a 
26:616:52077:28:27:68:521:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:decade after these reforms there is no discernable effect on the divorce rate.  Despite apparent 
26:617:52174:27:28:68:540:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:conflict in this literature, it is worth emphasizing the point of substantial agreement: each of these 
26:618:52277:28:28:68:529:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:authors finds that liberalized divorce laws had at most a small effect on divorce rates, and these 
26:619:52376:28:27:68:426:353:144:Times:144:Times:B:reforms explain very little of the rise in divorce over the past half century.

26:622:52646:27:28:68:511:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:hence their bargaining position.  Stevenson and Wolfers (2006) find that female suicide and 
26:623:52738:28:28:68:540:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:domestic violence fell in states that adopted unilateral divorce laws.  They interpret these findings 
26:624:52840:28:27:68:539:215:144:Times:144:Times:B:as suggesting that unilateral divorce laws shift bargaining power to women.  These laws may also 
26:625:52937:27:28:68:536:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:affect both the likelihood of marriage and intertemporal decision making within marriage.  Rasul 
26:626:53034:28:27:68:522:160:144:Times:144:Times:B:(2006) finds that the reduced gains from marriage under unilateral divorce led to a decrease in 
26:627:53130:27:28:68:503:133:144:Times:144:Times:B:marriage rates.  Research by Stevenson (2007) focuses on the difficulty in intertemporally 
26:628:53221:28:28:68:536:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:contracting when marriages can be unilaterally dissolved.  Analyzing a sample of newlyweds (so 
26:629:53316:28:0:68:511:77:144:Times:144:Times:B:as to minimize selection due to changes in divorce), she finds that the adoption of unilateral 
27:630:53414:0:27:68:530:712:144:Times:144:Times:B:divorce laws led to a decrease or delay in several forms of investment whose returns are at least 
27:631:53512:27:28:68:525:685:144:Times:144:Times:B:partly marriage-specific, including having children, household specialization, and the financial

27:635:53690:28:27:104:533:574:144:Times:144:Times:?:A key insight of “search” models of the labor market is that the ease with which workers 
27:636:53779:27:28:68:527:547:144:Times:144:Times:B:can locate relevant job openings determines equilibrium employment, unemployment duration, 
27:637:53870:28:28:68:533:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:and bargained wages.  So too, in the marriage market, the ease with which potential partners can 
27:638:53967:28:27:68:511:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:meet and decide whether to date affects if, when, and to whom marriage occurs.  Moreover, 
27:639:54057:27:28:68:533:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:changes in the marriage market “matching function” have effects beyond the dating phase, as an 
27:640:54152:28:27:68:497:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:important factor shaping behavior within marriage is the threat that a spouse may file for 
27:641:54243:27:28:68:503:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:divorce—a threat whose impact is shaped by an assessment of one’s likely chances on the 
27:642:54331:28:28:68:162:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:remarriage market.

27:644:54433:27:28:68:522:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:sexually-integrated workplaces now create greater opportunities for men and women to meet.  
27:645:54525:28:27:68:507:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:Analyzing data from the 1990 census, she shows that working in an industry or occupation 
27:646:54614:27:28:68:530:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:comprised of a greater share of members of the opposite sex is more likely to lead a marriage to 
27:647:54711:28:28:68:542:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:end in divorce, a phenomenon she labels “another form of on-the-job search.”  While she does not 
27:648:54808:28:27:68:518:215:144:Times:144:Times:B:analyze effects on marriage, these effects could plausibly go in either direction: the increased 
27:649:54905:27:28:68:540:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:likelihood (and speed) with which one meets an acceptable spouse could increase marriage, while 
27:650:55001:28:27:68:547:160:144:Times:144:Times:B:greater current, and future, exposure to potential mates raises the option value of remaining single.  
27:651:55104:27:28:68:534:133:144:Times:144:Times:B:A related shock to future marital patterns—and surely a useful focus for future research—comes 
27:652:55199:28:0:68:522:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:from sharply changing gender ratios on college campuses: Goldin, Katz and Kuziemko, 2006, 
28:653:55292:0:27:68:537:712:144:Times:144:Times:B:report that while women were a distinct minority of undergraduates in 1960, they are now a clear 
28:654:55389:27:28:68:115:685:144:Times:144:Times:B:majority.

28:656:55485:28:27:68:537:629:144:Times:144:Times:B:important shock.  Indeed, it inspired a bold claim in Wired (Griscom, 2002): “Twenty years from 
28:657:55581:27:28:68:520:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:now, the idea that someone looking for love without looking for it online will be silly, akin to 
28:658:55678:28:27:68:537:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:skipping the card catalog to instead wander the stacks because ‘the right books are found only by 
28:659:55776:27:28:68:534:547:144:Times:144:Times:B:accident’... serendipity is the hallmark of inefficient markets, and the marketplace of love, like it 
28:660:55878:28:28:68:513:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:or not, is becoming more efficient.”  Data from Forrester Research suggests that in 2004, 16 
28:661:55971:28:27:68:505:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:percent of singles are using online personals, and a September 2005 Internet Tracking Poll 
28:662:56062:27:28:68:544:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggests that 3 percent of internet users who are currently coupled first met online.4  Online search 
28:663:56164:28:27:68:527:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:differs from offline search in two important ways: it expands the set of potential partners and it 
28:664:56263:27:28:68:542:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:affords a degree of anonymity.  Each of these characteristics shapes the contours of online dating.  
28:665:56364:28:28:68:503:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:For instance, Forrester data suggest that over one-third of those using online personals are 
28:666:56457:28:27:68:158:353:144:Times:144:Times:B:currently married. 
28:667:56476:27:28:104:509:326:144:Times:144:Times:?:The Internet’s potential to change matching is perhaps greatest for those facing thin 
28:668:56562:28:27:68:541:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:markets or difficulty in meeting potential mates.  Indeed, the Forrester data reveals that those who 
28:669:56663:27:28:68:525:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:perceive themselves as facing such markets are more likely to use online personals: blacks and

28:671:56858:28:27:68:532:215:144:Times:144:Times:B:those without, and gays are four times as likely as straights.  Not surprisingly then, several large 
28:672:56959:27:59:68:526:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:dating sites exist to serve these niche matching markets, including various ethnic groups, gays,

29:681:57503:28:28:104:541:657:144:Times:144:Times:?:The larger mainstream dating sites also allow for narrowly-tailored searches, reversing the 
29:682:57595:28:27:68:533:629:144:Times:144:Times:B:typical temporal pattern of courtship from assessing attraction before suitability, to one in which 
29:683:57695:27:28:68:541:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:couples can ensure that they are appropriately matched on information about religion, fertility and 
29:684:57795:28:27:68:544:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:marriage aspirations, income or other important factors, before ever meeting.  While this may hark 
29:685:57894:27:28:68:512:547:144:Times:144:Times:B:back to the days of parents selecting suitable mates for their children, these matches may be 
29:686:57988:28:28:68:534:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:importantly different in the characteristics desired for matching than those selected by parents or 
29:687:58088:28:27:68:540:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:other matchmakers.  The targeted search offered by the Internet might lead one to forecast greater 
29:688:58187:27:28:68:486:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:endogamy (within-group matching).  Hitsch, Hortaçsu, and Ariely (2006) examine the 
29:689:58270:28:27:68:531:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:characteristics of couples whose dates were arranged through an online dating service, and find, 
29:690:58367:27:28:68:533:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:however, that the correlations of characteristics such as age, height, weight, beauty, income, and 
29:691:58466:28:28:68:532:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:education were qualitatively similar to those observed among married couples.  Yet even within 
29:692:58561:28:27:68:513:353:144:Times:144:Times:B:these groups, Internet search allows for the selection of mates with similar consumption and 
29:693:58654:27:28:68:279:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:leisure preferences (e.g. “must love dogs”). 
29:694:58699:28:27:104:527:298:144:Times:144:Times:?:While the Internet may yet transform marriage markets, it is too early to assess whether 
29:695:58788:27:28:68:537:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:those matched on the Internet are better matched than they would have been without the Internet, 
29:696:58885:28:28:68:523:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:whether marriage rates will subsequently rise, and what impact this will have on divorce.  The 
29:697:58980:28:27:68:547:215:144:Times:144:Times:B:tremendous amount of search being done online by those already married is potentially a harbinger 
29:698:59078:27:28:68:513:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:of rising divorce rates, yet this affect may be ameliorated by improved match quality in new 
29:699:59171:28:27:68:121:160:144:Times:144:Times:B:marriages. 
29:700:59182:27:28:104:510:133:144:Times:144:Times:?:Finally, search and matching can have an important role in amplifying shocks to the 
29:701:59266:28:28:68:521:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:marriage market.  For instance, Chiappori and Weiss (2000) note that if the divorce rate rises, 
29:702:59362:28:0:68:542:77:144:Times:144:Times:B:then—assuming undirected search—one might meet more divorcees in the course of a day.  Thus, 
30:703:59458:0:27:68:521:712:144:Times:144:Times:B:were one to divorce, the probability of remarrying is higher, making divorce a more attractive 
30:704:59553:27:28:68:440:685:144:Times:144:Times:B:option; this thick market externality creates a self-reinforcing rise in divorce.

30:706:59635:28:28:68:203:629:144:Times:144:Times:B:Interpreting the Evidence 
30:707:59661:28:27:68:71:601:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
30:708:59661:27:27:104:536:574:144:Times:144:Times:?:Our analysis of the family has pointed to trends in family life and possible driving forces, 
30:709:59754:27:28:68:500:547:144:Times:144:Times:B:but we have provided little interpretation of the welfare implications of these trends.  It is 
30:710:59849:28:28:68:519:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:commonly noted that , on average, divorced people are worse off—and married people better 
30:711:59939:28:27:68:524:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:off—financially, physically, and emotionally.  These associations often lead to a belief that all 
30:712:60037:27:28:68:538:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:marital dissolution is welfare decreasing, and that all marriage is welfare increasing (for instance, 
30:713:60139:28:27:68:508:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:Waite and Gallagher, 2000).  Yet, there is little hard evidence that preventing couples from 
30:714:60232:27:28:68:535:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:divorcing is welfare-enhancing.  Instead, much of the public concern about divorce stems from a 
30:715:60328:28:28:68:538:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:belief that divorce causes people to be worse off, rather than that people who are worse off face a 
30:716:60428:28:27:68:494:353:144:Times:144:Times:B:greater risk of divorce.  Furthermore, it is important to differentiate between the average 
30:717:60520:27:28:68:540:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:marriage—which is likely a happy one—and the marginal marriage that may be created or spared 
30:718:60613:28:27:68:463:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:by changes in the environment governing marriage, which may be quite different. 
30:719:60693:27:28:104:512:271:144:Times:144:Times:?:Indeed, the economic theory of the family points precisely in this direction.  Becker, 
30:720:60780:28:28:68:539:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:Landes, and Michael (1977, p. 1144) argue that “the majority of divorces results from uncertainty 
30:721:60878:28:27:68:539:215:144:Times:144:Times:B:and unfavorable outcomes.”  Thus, we would expect to see those who suffer adverse shocks to be 
30:722:60973:27:28:68:511:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:more likely to both divorce and remain unmarried following a divorce, thereby contributing 
30:723:61064:28:27:68:534:160:144:Times:144:Times:B:disproportionately to the stock of the currently divorced.  Empirical research has found evidence 
30:724:61162:27:28:68:517:133:144:Times:144:Times:B:for such a pattern: Charles and Stephens (2004) find that the divorce hazard rises following a 
30:725:61257:28:0:68:498:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:spouse’s layoff and they suggest that this increased probability of divorce stems from the 
31:726:61351:0:27:68:523:712:144:Times:144:Times:B:information conveyed about the person’s suitability as a spouse, rather than stemming directly 
31:727:61446:27:28:68:174:685:144:Times:144:Times:B:from financial losses. 
31:728:61469:28:28:104:513:657:144:Times:144:Times:?:The theory of the family also suggests that marriage is most likely to occur when the 
31:729:61555:28:27:68:543:629:144:Times:144:Times:B:potential gains from marriage are large.  Individuals with high earning potential have more to gain 
31:730:61655:27:28:68:545:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:from domestic arrangements that allow them to specialize in market production; those with a “love 
31:731:61753:28:27:68:537:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:of fun” have more to gain from shared leisure and consumption; and those with good health have 
31:732:61848:27:28:68:539:547:144:Times:144:Times:B:more to gain due to the greater potential longevity of their marriage.  Thus, we should expect that 
31:733:61948:28:28:68:515:519:144:Times:144:Times:B:the wealthy, healthy, and happy are more likely to marry.  Indeed, even as surveys show that 
31:734:62041:28:27:68:543:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:married people are happier than those who are not married, our analysis of self-reported happiness 
31:735:62140:27:28:68:510:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:and marital histories in the British Household Panel Survey reveals that singles who are the 
31:736:62233:28:27:68:521:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:happiest are also the most likely to marry in the future.  If we follow those who were single in 
31:737:62330:27:28:68:545:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:1996 through time, we find that those who married by 2004 experienced gains in happiness similar 
31:738:62427:28:28:68:537:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:to gains experienced by those who didn’t marry.  Similarly, Gardner and Oswald (2006) find that 
31:739:62523:28:27:68:529:353:144:Times:144:Times:B:while people are less happy the year that they separate, a year after the divorce they are happier 
31:740:62622:27:28:68:215:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:than they were while married. 
31:741:62652:28:27:104:539:298:144:Times:144:Times:?:Ultimately, purely observational studies cannot convincingly establish whether people are 
31:742:62742:27:28:68:518:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:better or worse off as a result of marriage or divorce. The problem is that a number of factors 
31:743:62838:28:28:68:531:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:linking wellbeing and marital status are unobservable to the researcher.  One response is to seek 
31:744:62936:28:27:68:520:215:144:Times:144:Times:B:natural experiments that may lead to a sort of random variation across marital status.  A small 
31:745:63032:27:28:68:523:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:number of quite promising studies have taken this tack and found quite surprising results.  For 
31:746:63128:28:27:68:529:160:144:Times:144:Times:B:instance, an earlier literature had shown that the economic status of divorced women was lower 
31:747:63223:27:28:68:518:133:144:Times:144:Times:B:than that for married women, a fact that had led to concern that divorce impoverishes women 
31:748:63315:28:28:68:539:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:(rather than a concern that low income drives divorce).  Bedard and Deschênes (2005) exploit the 
31:749:63412:28:0:68:521:77:144:Times:144:Times:B:fact that divorce is more likely to follow if the first child born is a girl than a boy to assess the 
32:750:63517:0:27:68:538:712:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects of those “random” divorces caused by child gender.  They find that divorced women have 
32:751:63612:27:28:68:494:685:144:Times:144:Times:B:higher household income and annual earnings than never-divorced women, a fact that is 
32:752:63698:28:28:68:543:657:144:Times:144:Times:B:attributable to divorced women working more intensively and the potential for divorced women to 
32:753:63794:28:27:68:506:629:144:Times:144:Times:B:join higher income households (such as their parents’).  In another study, Dahl (2006) uses 
32:754:63886:27:28:68:505:602:144:Times:144:Times:B:variation in state laws restricting the minimum age of marriage to show that those who are 
32:755:63977:28:27:68:541:574:144:Times:144:Times:B:prevented from marrying while young are substantially less likely to end up living in poverty later 
32:756:64077:27:28:68:134:547:144:Times:144:Times:B:in their lives. 
32:757:64093:28:28:104:533:519:144:Times:144:Times:?:Even while these studies seek to separate correlation from causation, they do not provide 
32:758:64183:28:27:68:536:491:144:Times:144:Times:B:directly welfare-relevant metrics.  For instance, even if we isolate factors that create more or less 
32:759:64285:27:28:68:531:464:144:Times:144:Times:B:divorce, these insights would only yield insight to maximizing social welfare if coupled with an 
32:760:64382:28:27:68:548:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:understanding of whether we currently have an efficient number of divorces, too many, or too few.  
32:761:64481:27:28:68:539:409:144:Times:144:Times:B:To understand this point, consider an analogy to the labor market.  The U.S. labor market, like its 
32:762:64581:28:28:68:544:381:144:Times:144:Times:B:marriage markets, differs from Europe in having substantially greater “churn”; in any given month 
32:763:64679:28:27:68:529:353:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the U.S., workers are more likely to be fired, and those without a match are more likely to be 
32:764:64777:27:28:68:531:326:144:Times:144:Times:B:hired, than are their European counterparts.  There is an emerging consensus that restrictions on 
32:765:64875:28:27:68:492:298:144:Times:144:Times:B:churning in European labor markets yields inefficient labor markets, with “too few” job 
32:766:64963:27:28:68:533:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:separations.  We do not mean to infer by analogy that Europe is afflicted with too few divorces.  
32:767:65061:28:28:68:539:243:144:Times:144:Times:B:Rather, we highlight this parallel because it makes the case that a combination of empirical work, 
32:768:65160:28:27:68:545:215:144:Times:144:Times:B:attention to causal inference, and general equilibrium theorizing are required to assess implications 
32:769:65262:27:28:68:523:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:for aggregate well-being changes in marriage markets.  With the economics of the family now

32:771:65455:27:0:68:300:133:144:Times:144:Times:B:25 years will provide progress toward this goal.
