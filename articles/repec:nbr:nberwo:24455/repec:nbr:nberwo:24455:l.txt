2:32:1630:28:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:This paper studies international joint ventures, where foreign direct investment is performed by a 
2:33:1729:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:foreign and  a  domestic  firm  that  together  set  up  a  new  firm,  the  joint  venture.  Employing 
2:34:1832:14:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:administrative  data on  all  international  joint  ventures  in  China  from  1998  to  2007—roughly  a 
2:35:1936:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:quarter of all international joint ventures in the world—we find, first, that Chinese firms chosen 
2:36:2034:14:14:72:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:to be partners of foreign investors tend to be larger, more productive, and more likely subsidized 
2:37:2132:14:14:72:546:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:than other Chinese firms. Second, there is substantial international technology transfer not only to 
2:38:2232:14:14:71:546:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:the joint venture itself but also to the Chinese joint venture partner firm. Third, with technology 
2:39:2331:14:14:71:546:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:spillovers typically outweighing negative competition effects, joint ventures generate net positive 
2:40:2430:14:14:71:545:462:12:Times:12:Times:C:externalities  to  other  Chinese  firms  in  the  same  industry. Joint  venture  externalities  are  large, 
2:41:2539:14:14:71:546:448:12:Times:12:Times:C:perhaps twice the size of wholly-owned FDI spillovers, and it is R&D-intensive firms, including 
2:42:2634:14:14:71:546:434:12:Times:12:Times:C:the joint ventures themselves, that benefit most from these externalities. Furthermore, the positive 
2:43:2734:14:14:71:546:420:12:Times:12:Times:C:external joint venture effect is larger if the foreign firm is from the U.S. rather than from Japan or 
2:44:2836:14:14:71:545:406:12:Times:12:Times:C:Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, while this effect is virtually absent in broad sectors that include 
2:45:2933:14:28:71:452:392:12:Times:12:Times:C:economic activities for which China’s FDI policy has prohibited joint ventures.

3:68:3474:0:36:57:193:722:17:g_d0_f5:17:g_d0_f5:C:1  Introduction
3:69:3489:36:24:75:554:686:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:International joint ventures (or IJVs—business partnerships between firms headquartered in
3:70:3579:24:24:57:554:662:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:different countries to form a new commercial entity) are a major vehicle by which foreign direct
3:71:3675:24:24:57:554:638:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:investment (FDI) is conducted. Nowhere is the role of IJVs as prominent as in China, where in the
3:72:3772:24:23:57:554:614:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:wake of the country’s opening to FDI in 1979, a flood of foreign investment has entered one of
3:73:3866:23:24:57:554:591:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the world’s largest economies. In 2015 alone, just over 6,000 new IJVs, amounting to $27.8 billion
3:74:3964:24:24:57:554:567:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of FDI inflows, were established in China.1On the part of the host country, a major reason for
3:75:4058:24:24:57:554:543:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:favoring IJVs relative to wholly foreign-owned FDI is the idea that joint ventures generate more
3:76:4154:24:24:57:554:519:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:local technological learning, as well as access to intellectual property and foreign capital. Foreign
3:77:4255:24:24:57:554:495:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:firms benefit from IJVs because they can avoid some of the complexities—regulatory, cultural, and
3:78:4352:24:24:57:554:471:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:otherwise—inherent in entering the local market but need to balance this with the technology
3:79:4444:24:24:57:555:447:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:transfer through the joint venture, especially to any firm that might be a future competitor. Yet,
3:80:4542:24:24:57:554:423:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:while this trade-off and the prominence of IJVs have put them often at the forefront of economic
3:81:4638:24:24:57:554:399:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:policy discussions, to date there is little quantitative evidence on the technology transfer impact of
3:82:4740:24:24:57:554:375:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:IJVs.2Using administrative data on the universe of IJVs from China’s Ministry of Commerce’s
3:83:4831:24:23:56:553:351:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f6:B:Name List of Foreign and Domestic Joint Ventures in Chinamatched to micro data on Chinese
3:84:4920:23:24:57:554:328:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:producers, we quantify the extent to which IJVs shape the development of the host country between
3:85:5017:24:24:57:364:304:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:1998 and 2007, both inside and outside of the joint venture.
3:86:5077:24:24:75:554:280:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:By matching the IJVs to micro data from China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), our
3:87:5165:24:24:57:554:256:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:analysis gives a comprehensive picture of the types of firms that shape both joint venture patterns
3:88:5264:24:24:57:554:232:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and technology transfer as well as market outcomes (see Figure 1). First, there are the foreign and
3:89:5363:24:24:57:554:208:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Chinese partner firms that agree on a new joint venture. Second, there is the joint venture firm
3:90:5459:24:24:57:554:184:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:itself, and third, there are other Chinese firms that are not associated with the joint venture. We
3:91:5558:24:24:57:554:160:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:begin by isolating the characteristics of firms, be it market share, stock of technology, or regulatory
3:92:5661:24:18:57:554:136:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:expertise, that are conducive to being picked as Chinese partners by foreign investors seeking to

3:94:5829:11:16:71:554:107:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:2For example, in Spring of 2018 it has been argued by advisors to the Trump White House that U.S. firms are
3:95:5936:16:12:57:555:91:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:harmed by China’s ‘forced joint ventures’ policy (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/26/kevin-hassett-us-firms-get-

4:101:6423:34:24:57:554:430:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:enter the Chinese market. Next, we quantify the effects of the IJV subsequent to the creation of
4:102:6519:24:24:57:555:406:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the joint venture. To begin with, there is the technology transfer from foreign firm to joint venture,
4:103:6621:24:23:57:554:382:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:an internalized effect. Furthermore, there are externalities generated by IJVs to other Chinese
4:104:6716:23:24:57:556:359:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:firms, which can be positive (technology spillovers) or negative (such as market share rivalry).
4:105:6812:24:24:57:554:335:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Finally, based on information on thousands of joint venture-Chinese partner firm pairs we quantify
4:106:6910:24:24:57:554:311:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:a new, intergenerational technology transfer effect: that some of the foreign technology transferred
4:107:7010:24:24:57:554:287:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:to the joint venture leaks to the Chinese partner firm that, together with the foreign firm, set the
4:108:7110:24:24:57:215:263:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:joint venture up to begin with.
4:109:7141:24:24:75:554:239:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Our first set of findings examines what foreign investors are looking for in Chinese joint venture
4:110:7239:24:24:57:554:215:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:partners. Generally, foreigners favor profitable, large, and highly productive firms, and high rates
4:111:7339:24:24:57:554:191:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of export participation and patenting are other advantages. In addition, firms that receive subsidies
4:112:7440:24:24:57:554:167:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:are attractive, while government ownership in general does not matter. Second, after their creation
4:113:7539:24:23:57:555:143:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:we find that joint ventures benefit from international technology transfer, an internalized effect
4:114:7637:23:24:57:556:120:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:that is manifested by higher sales, productivity, export sales, product innovation, and patenting.
4:115:7735:24:24:57:554:96:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Furthermore, we present evidence for indirect technology transfer: in fact, the formation of the
4:116:7831:24:0:57:453:72:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:joint venture leads to better performance of the Chinese partner firm as well.
5:117:7910:0:24:75:554:722:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Third, IJVs generate positive externalities to local Chinese firms that operate in the same
5:118:8001:24:24:57:554:698:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:industry. Economically, productivity spillovers from joint ventures appear to be larger than those
5:119:8099:24:24:57:554:674:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:from wholly-owned FDI, and even Chinese partner firms generate positive productivity spillovers
5:120:8194:24:24:57:554:650:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:to other Chinese firms in the same industry.3Strikingly, while purely domestic firms benefit from
5:121:8291:24:24:57:555:626:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:these externalities, joint ventures benefit even more from externalities from other joint ventures,
5:122:8390:24:24:57:554:602:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:indicating that the joint venture’s advanced technology makes them relatively receptive to benefit
5:123:8488:24:23:57:554:578:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:from the advanced technology of other firms. External effects from joint ventures are highest
5:124:8581:23:24:57:554:555:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in R&D-intensive industries, and, on average, investors from the U.S. typically generate higher
5:125:8676:24:24:57:554:531:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:benefits than investors from Japan or Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. Finally, we find little

5:127:8868:24:24:57:230:483:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ventures are explicitly prohibited.
5:128:8903:24:24:75:554:459:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:This paper makes a number of contributions. First, with the arrival of the new paradigm in
5:129:8993:24:24:57:554:435:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the late 1970s that international openness facilitates economic development, a large literature on
5:130:9091:24:24:57:554:411:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the impact of international trade and FDI on host country performance has emerged. With early
5:131:9184:24:24:57:554:387:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:studies at the country or industry level showing general correlations, the recent availability of data
5:132:9286:24:24:57:554:363:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:sets with firm-level data has enabled researchers to ask not only whether attracting FDI leads to
5:133:9383:24:23:57:554:339:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:benefits but also whether these effects are internal or external to the investing firm. This paper
5:134:9481:23:24:57:554:316:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:provides a unified analysis by shedding light both on internal and external effects from FDI, which
5:135:9580:24:24:57:554:292:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:matters because the policy case for public subsidies to attract FDI rests on positive externalities
5:136:9679:24:24:56:554:268:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:(see Keller 2010). One challenge in quantifying spillovers is that they are typically inferred from the
5:137:9782:24:24:57:554:244:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:extent of FDI or foreign presence in an industry or sector rather than directly measured through a
5:138:9880:24:24:57:554:220:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:firm-to-firm link (Van Reenen and Yueh 2012). Recently, progress has been made by Javorcik and
5:139:9974:24:24:57:554:196:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Spatareanu (2009) who employ information on whether local firms sell to a foreign multinational
5:140:10069:24:24:57:554:172:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:for a sample of Czech firms, and to the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first paper to
5:141:10163:24:24:57:554:148:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:employ information on the ownership link between two specific firms. The information on pairs of
5:142:10259:24:24:57:554:124:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f8:B:joint venture and partner firms from theName List of Foreign and Domestic Joint Ventures in
5:143:10350:24:17:56:554:100:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f6:B:Chinaallows us to assess the importance of firm-to-firm links for generating spillovers to the host
5:144:10449:17:0:71:386:83:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:3An exception is patenting, where we find a negative net external effect.
6:145:10523:0:24:57:554:722:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:country. If the foreign investor transfers technology to the joint venture firm it may also trigger
6:146:10622:24:24:57:554:698:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:technology leakage gains for the Chinese partner firm, given its link to the joint venture.4We will
6:147:10721:24:24:57:331:674:12:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:B:refer to this as intergenerational technology transfer.5
6:148:10777:24:24:75:555:650:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Second, while there are hundreds of papers on the benefits of either trade or FDI, quantitatively
6:149:10874:24:24:57:554:626:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:we still know quite little on the effects of international joint ventures.6Much of the literature
6:150:10971:24:24:57:554:602:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:presents qualitative characterizations of the incentives and organizational issues underlying partner
6:151:11072:24:23:57:554:578:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:selection (Kogut 1988, Geringer 1991), and discussions of the benefits and costs from the IJV
6:152:11165:23:24:57:554:555:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:for the foreign investor and Chinese partner firm.7Our analysis goes beyond this by examining
6:153:11258:24:24:57:554:531:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:quantitatively the empirical determinants of joint venture choice (see also Arnold and Javorcik
6:154:11353:24:24:57:554:507:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:2009 on the choice of FDI targets). Furthermore, with few exceptions (e.g., Geringer and Hebert
6:155:11448:24:24:57:554:483:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:1991, Reuer and Koza 2000, Howell 2016) work on the effects of joint ventures on firm performance
6:156:11545:24:24:57:554:459:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:is lacking, and to the extent that it exists it tends to derive its principal empirical findings from
6:157:11646:24:24:57:554:435:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:descriptive evidence or small data samples applied in non-econometric settings. In contrast, we
6:158:11741:24:24:57:554:411:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:employ a comprehensive data set together with a difference-in-difference estimation strategy to
6:159:11836:24:24:57:554:387:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:show a number of new results, including that industry spillovers from joint ventures are large
6:160:11930:24:24:57:482:363:12:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:B:compared to those typically estimated for wholly-owned foreign direct investment.8
6:161:12012:24:23:75:554:339:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Third, we produce a number of important new results for the case of China. Based on existing
6:162:12104:23:24:57:554:316:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:work there appear to be tangible impacts from FDI on local outcomes, with the results suggesting
6:163:12200:24:24:57:554:292:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:that industry-level heterogeneity and the ownership structure of FDI matter. One advantage of
6:164:12293:24:24:57:554:268:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:this paper is that we employ several sources of administrative micro data to create a sample that
6:165:12390:24:18:57:554:244:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:covers not only financial but also operative and technological dimensions of FDI in China, in
6:166:12483:18:16:71:554:226:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:4Outside the context of FDI spillovers, there have recently been advances in the analysis of firm-to-firm
6:167:12588:16:8:57:456:210:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:relationships in production networks (e.g., Tintelnot, Kikkawa, Mogstad, and Dhyne 2017).
6:168:12677:8:16:71:554:202:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:5In development economics, intergenerational transfers are typically thought of as in-kind or monetary transfers
6:169:12789:16:11:57:556:186:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:from children to their parents, perhaps in exchange for prior human capital investments made by the parents (e.g.
6:170:12902:11:9:57:152:175:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:Raut and Tran 2005).
6:171:12922:9:15:71:554:166:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:6The survey by Harrison and Rodríguez-Clare (2010) alone discusses 175 studies on the benefits of openness
6:172:13028:15:9:56:263:151:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:(mostly trade) and 47 studies of FDI spillovers.
6:173:13076:9:15:71:554:142:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:7Other countries in which joint ventures have played a major role for FDI include India, South Africa, and
6:174:13182:15:9:57:176:127:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:Malaysia (UNCTAD 2003).
6:175:13205:9:15:71:554:118:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:8See section 3.3 below. Our result that IJV industry spillovers are relatively large is consistent with Van Reenen
6:176:13319:15:12:57:554:103:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:and Yueh (2012) who can directly compare the impact on productivity of international technology transfer to joint
6:177:13432:12:0:57:404:91:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:ventures versus to wholly foreign-owned firms, finding that the former is larger.
7:178:13514:0:24:57:555:722:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:contrast to more aggregated data that may obscure the true effects of FDI.9Some of the earliest
7:179:13609:24:24:57:554:698:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:empirical research in this area examines productivity spillovers from FDI in China’s electronics
7:180:13705:24:24:57:554:674:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and textile industries, showing negative effects on domestic firms in the short-run aftermath of FDI
7:181:13805:24:24:57:554:650:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:penetration that diminish in the long run as foreign firms’ technology and know-how are eventually
7:182:13903:24:24:57:554:626:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:diffused to domestic firms (Hu and Jefferson 2002). More recent work has produced mixed results
7:183:13998:24:24:57:555:602:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:on FDI externalities,10which is in part because FDI generates both negative (market share rivalry)
7:184:14096:24:23:57:554:578:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and positive (technology spillovers) externalities for domestic firms (Bloom, Schankerman, and
7:185:14190:23:24:57:554:555:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Van Reenen 2013, Lu, Tao, and Zhu 2017). In addition to shifting the focus on joint ventures our
7:186:14286:24:24:57:554:531:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:analysis goes some way to incorporate joint venture selection into the analysis, we study several
7:187:14383:24:24:57:554:507:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:outcomes of joint venture formation, including productivity, exporting, and innovation, and we
7:188:14477:24:24:57:554:483:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:examine heterogeneity by industry and foreign investor.11Compared to recent work on the impact
7:189:14571:24:24:57:554:459:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of joint ventures in China (Van Reenen and Yueh 2012), the most important difference is that
7:190:14663:24:24:57:554:435:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:our analysis encompasses externalities generated by these joint ventures in addition to internal
7:191:14759:24:24:57:554:411:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:effects. Externalities, it has been suggested, might be even more important than internal effects
7:192:14856:24:24:57:554:387:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:for economic development (e.g., Greenstone, Hornbeck, and Moretti 2010, Van Reenen and Yueh
7:193:14947:24:24:57:88:363:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:2012).
7:194:14953:24:23:75:554:339:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we give background on the
7:195:15043:23:24:57:554:316:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:policy environment for FDI and IJVs in China, and describe our firm-level data set. In Section 3 we
7:196:15142:24:24:57:554:292:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:empirically explore various aspects of IJVs, first estimating the determinants of domestic partner
7:197:15240:24:24:57:554:268:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:selection and characterizing the types of Chinese firms most likely to be picked to form a joint
7:198:15336:24:24:57:556:244:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:venture with a foreign partner. We then turn to estimating the role of joint venture status in firms’
7:199:15437:24:24:57:554:220:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:performance with regard to several outcomes, quantifying the technology transfer effects internal
7:200:15534:24:24:57:554:196:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:to joint ventures as well as the externalities on other Chinese firms that arise from the proliferation
7:201:15637:24:24:57:555:172:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of IJVs. We then break our empirical analysis down along several dimensions of heterogeneity,
7:202:15730:24:18:57:554:148:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:considering the foreign investor’s country-of-origin and differences across industries, and evaluate
7:203:15830:18:12:71:344:130:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:9As argued, for example, by Buckley, Wang, and Clegg (2007).
7:204:15890:12:15:67:555:118:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:10E.g., Huang (2004) finds evidence for neither intra-industry nor inter-industry FDI spillovers on productivity,
7:205:16003:15:9:57:218:103:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:while Wei and Liu (2006) finds both.
7:206:16039:9:15:67:554:94:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:11See also Buckley, Wang, and Clegg (2007). A handful of papers have examined the impact of FDI on innovation
7:207:16148:15:0:57:398:79:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:in China (Cheung and Lin 2004, Ito, Yashiro, Xu, Chen, and Wakasugi 2012).
8:208:16223:0:24:57:554:722:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the role of China’s restrictions on foreign investment in specific economic activities in determining
8:209:16324:24:24:57:554:698:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the magnitude of technology transfer from IJVs. Section 4 provides a concluding discussion and
8:210:16418:24:54:57:309:674:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:elucidates the policy implications of our findings.

8:212:16493:42:31:57:178:578:14:g_d0_f5:14:g_d0_f5:C:2.1  Background
8:213:16508:31:24:75:555:547:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:As part of a broad effort to enact economic reforms, China started to open to foreign investment
8:214:16604:24:24:57:554:523:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in 1979. Only in the early 1990s, however, did FDI enter the country in significant volumes, in the
8:215:16703:24:24:57:554:499:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:wake of reforms enacted by Deng Xiaoping; namely, the gradual relaxation of rules on FDI and the
8:216:16799:24:24:57:554:475:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:establishment of special economic zones which offered favorable regulatory environments to foreign
8:217:16897:24:24:57:554:451:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:investment (OECD 2000). Today China is one of the world’s top destinations for FDI. Figure
8:218:16987:24:24:57:554:427:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:2 shows the evolution of foreign investment in China over the last four decades. The left-hand
8:219:17081:24:24:57:554:403:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:vertical axis is the value of FDI inflows (in billion USD), while the right-hand axis corresponds
8:220:17178:24:24:57:554:379:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:to the number of signed foreign investment contracts (in thousands). The value of inflows has
8:221:17271:24:23:57:554:355:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:expanded unabated since the beginning of the 1990s, while the number of new contracts (after the
8:222:17367:23:24:57:554:332:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:spike around 1993 resulting from the establishment of several new special economic zones to attract
8:223:17466:24:24:57:554:308:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:foreign investment) has generally settled at between 20 and 30 thousand projects registered per
8:224:17561:24:24:57:554:284:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:year. The sample period we cover, from 1998 to 2007, is a time of steady expansion in the value of
8:225:17659:24:24:57:554:260:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:FDI inflows, and an overall upward trend in the number of new projects. Figure 3 illustrates the
8:226:17755:24:24:57:554:236:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:number of IJV partnerships in our sample by the origin countries of the foreign partners. The large
8:227:17854:24:24:57:554:212:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:majority of foreign IJV partners originate from three sources: Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan
8:228:17945:24:24:56:554:188:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:(HMT for short), Japan, and the United States, with other high-income countries comprising most
8:229:18040:24:24:57:554:164:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of the remainder.12In our empirical analysis, we will consider the role of the foreign partner’s
8:230:18136:24:18:57:385:140:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:origin in determining the magnitude of intra-industry spillovers.
8:231:18201:18:15:67:554:122:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:12A sizable portion of the recorded FDI into China from Hong Kong actually initially originates from China—a
8:232:18309:15:12:57:554:107:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:process known as “round-tripping,” wherein outward capital flows re-enter the Chinese market via Hong Kong for

9:263:19437:24:24:57:554:202:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:which FDI has entered the Chinese market: equity joint ventures, contractual joint ventures, and
9:264:19533:24:24:57:554:178:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:wholly foreign-owned enterprises (WFOEs).13Table 1, which summarizes the value of each of these

9:266:19722:17:16:67:555:137:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:13Equity joint ventures differ from contractual joint ventures in a number of ways. Unlike equity joint ventures,
9:267:19835:16:12:57:554:121:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:contractual joint ventures need not be separate legal entities from their parents. Equity joint ventures require a
9:268:19949:12:12:57:554:109:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:minimum share of foreign ownership to be classified as such, whereas contractual joint ventures require no such
9:269:20060:12:12:57:554:97:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:provision. In contractual joint ventures, profits are shared between partners on a contractually-agreed upon basis (as
9:270:20178:12:12:57:554:85:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:opposed to in proportion to each partner’s capital contribution). Further, in contractual joint ventures the degree of
9:271:20296:12:12:57:554:73:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:foreign control embedded in the structure of the joint venture—management, voting, staffing rights, etc.—can be
9:272:20407:12:0:57:360:61:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:negotiated over, and not necessarily allocated based on equity shares.

10:301:21032:24:24:57:554:364:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the 1990s, but have since been supplanted by WFOEs.14WFOEs today account for around 78%
10:302:21119:24:24:57:554:340:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of all FDI flows into China, their increasing prevalence owing to both the occasional mistrust by
10:303:21216:24:23:57:554:316:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:foreign investors of Chinese joint venture partners and the regulatory liberalization resulting from
10:304:21316:23:24:57:554:293:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:China’s 2001 accession to the World Trade Organization, which allowed greater scope for both the
10:305:21412:24:24:57:555:269:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:establishment of green-field investments and for the acquisition of Chinese firms. Despite this shift,
10:306:21514:24:24:57:431:245:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:IJVs continue to account for a sizable portion of all Chinese FDI inflows.
10:307:21588:24:24:75:554:221:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:What makes joint ventures an attractive mode for FDI? In the case of China, the reasons
10:308:21675:24:24:57:556:197:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:reflect both the regulatory environment along with the general benefits arising from joint ventures.
10:309:21775:24:24:57:554:173:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Though the regulations on foreign investment have been liberalized in recent years, China’s
10:310:21866:24:24:57:554:149:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:foreign investment policy still mandates that foreign firms bring on board a local partner to
10:311:21959:24:18:57:554:125:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:conduct business in restricted industries, while in some industries (typically those dealing with
10:312:22056:18:16:67:554:107:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:14FDI has also increasingly been conducted via share companies with foreign investment, i.e. publicly traded
10:313:22164:16:12:57:554:91:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:companies established in China by foreign companies, though the volume of FDI flows conducted via this mode is
10:314:22274:12:0:57:212:79:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:still dwarfed by other types of FDI.
11:315:22311:0:24:57:554:722:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:national security or other critical areas) foreign investment remains strictly off limits. China’s
11:316:22409:24:24:57:555:698:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Catalogue of Industries for Foreign Direct Investment classifies industries based on four categories:
11:317:22510:24:24:55:553:674:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:“encouraged,” “restricted,” “prohibited,” and “permitted” (the last of which refers to industries
11:318:22607:24:24:57:554:650:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:for which special rules of operation for foreign firms are not explicitly mentioned). It is in the
11:319:22705:24:24:57:554:626:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:restricted activities (which include endeavors such as, for example, the production of various
11:320:22799:24:24:57:554:602:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:chemicals and pharmaceuticals, the manufacture of certain electronics and machinery, such as
11:321:22891:24:23:57:554:578:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:cameras or car engines, and the operation of rail and freight companies) that foreign firms are
11:322:22986:23:24:57:554:555:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:legally required to partner with a domestic firm in a Sino-foreign joint venture. Today, the number
11:323:23085:24:24:57:554:531:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of “restricted” economic activities—those in which Sino-foreign partnerships are mandated for
11:324:23178:24:24:57:554:507:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:foreign investors—stands at 38. This figure is considerably lower than it was in the recent past; for
11:325:23279:24:24:57:554:483:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the period covered by our sample, the requirement of partial domestic ownership was much more
11:326:23372:24:46:57:466:459:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:pervasive. We will show results on these various categories of FDI policy below.

11:338:24424:24:24:57:554:142:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Ministry of Commerce. The Name List Database contains a multitude of details on each joint
11:339:24514:24:24:57:554:118:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:venture, such as its name, address, industry code, year of establishment, contracted operation

12:348:25278:24:23:75:556:578:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:To obtain our sample, we merge these three databases together for our empirical analysis.
12:349:25367:23:24:57:554:555:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:First, we match the Name List Database to ASIFP to identify both the IJV and the domestic IJV
12:350:25460:24:24:57:554:531:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:partner firms in the ASIFP database, which allows us to observe information on their firm-level
12:351:25555:24:24:57:554:507:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:attributes. The match quality is important for our empirical findings. Fortunately, according to

12:355:25949:24:24:57:554:411:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:identifier might be Chongqing (administrative region) Changan (name) Automobile (industrial
12:356:26040:24:24:57:554:387:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:sector) Co., Ltd. (legal entity identifier). Firms in the same industrial sector cannot use the same
12:357:26140:24:24:57:554:363:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:name. Moreover, firms have an exclusive right to their names on a regional basis. Therefore, if
12:358:26235:24:23:57:554:339:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the firm’s name, location, and industry code are entered the same in both the ASIFP and Name
12:359:26327:23:24:57:555:316:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:List databases, this information identifies the same entity. Because of this, we use company name,
12:360:26425:24:24:57:554:292:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:location, and industry code to identify both the joint venture firms and the domestic IJV partner
12:361:26522:24:24:57:554:268:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:firms in the ASIFP database and the Name List Database year by year. Then, we match the
12:362:26609:24:24:57:554:244:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ASIFP and SIPO data together to incorporate information on each firm’s patenting activities. We
12:363:26704:24:24:57:554:220:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:employ data matching strategies from the NBER Patent Data Project to ensure the accuracy of
12:364:26795:24:24:57:554:196:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the matching. Specifically, we use firm name, location (at the municipal level), and the 2-digit
12:365:26891:24:24:57:554:172:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Chinese Standard Industrial Classification (CSIC) industry code to merge the data sets with each
12:366:26987:24:24:57:554:148:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:other. Our empirical results are based on IJVs in China’s mining and logging, manufacturing, and
12:367:27083:24:24:57:554:124:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:utilities industries observed between 1998 and 2007; specifically, our study covers all domestic
12:368:27179:24:24:57:554:100:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:partner firms with annual sales of at least 5 million RMB in operation at any point between 1998
12:369:27275:24:0:57:554:76:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and 2007. Based on the description above, our data strongly relies on the representativeness of the
13:370:27376:0:24:57:554:722:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ASIFP database. We compare the data in the ASIFP data for 2004 to the 2004 Chinese Economic
13:371:27467:24:24:57:554:698:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Census—the earliest year in which the Economic Census was conducted, and which covers all firms
13:372:27562:24:24:57:554:674:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in China. Based on the Census, the total sales in 2004 for all industrial firms totaled 218 billion
13:373:27661:24:24:57:554:650:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:RMB, whereas the sales for all industrial firms in the ASIFP data totaled 196 billion RMB. The
13:374:27755:24:24:57:554:626:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:enterprises covered by the ASIFP thus account for almost all (more than 91%) of the total sales of
13:375:27853:24:24:57:554:602:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:all industrial firms in China in 2004. This evidence is consistent with other work, e.g. Brandt, Van
13:376:27953:24:23:57:219:578:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Biesebroeck, and Zhang (2014).
13:377:27983:23:24:75:554:555:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Our sample of IJV firms covers all of the industries in the full ASIFP database, ensuring the
13:378:28076:24:24:57:554:531:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:representativeness of the IJV sample.15The domestic partner firms chosen as IJV partners are more
13:379:28173:24:24:57:555:507:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:likely to come from either labor-intensive manufacturing industries such as textile goods (CSIC 17)
13:380:28272:24:24:57:554:483:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:or high-tech industries such as electronic equipment manufacturing (CSIC 39), with relatively fewer
13:381:28371:24:24:57:554:459:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:IJVs formed in resource extraction and utilities (owing to activities in these industries frequently
13:382:28471:24:24:57:279:435:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:being classified as prohibited or restricted).
13:383:28517:24:24:75:554:411:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:The firms involved in the formation of IJVs also vary in where they tend to be located. Figure
13:384:28611:24:24:57:555:387:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:4 shows the geographical distribution of the partner firms at the provincial level. Immediately
13:385:28706:24:24:57:554:363:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:apparent is that IJV partner firms tend to be more common in highly developed coastal areas such
13:386:28802:24:23:57:554:339:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:as Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai and Shandong, with comparatively fewer partner firms
13:387:28896:23:24:57:554:316:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:located in the western, central, and northern areas of the country. To account for the regional
13:388:28991:24:47:57:556:292:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:component of IJV formation, we control for geographical characteristics in our empirical analysis.
13:389:29089:47:31:57:234:245:14:g_d0_f5:14:g_d0_f5:C:2.3  Variable Definitions
13:390:29114:31:24:75:554:214:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:We focus on several firm attributes in our analysis—some directly available in the data and
13:391:29205:24:24:57:554:190:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:some that we estimate. First, we consider total factor productivity (TFP). We measure TFP
13:392:29294:24:24:57:554:166:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:with two approaches:TFP (OLS)is the OLS residual from a log-linear production function and
13:393:29384:24:24:55:554:142:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f6:B:TFP (OP)is estimated following the methodology of Olley and Pakes (1996). Both methods are
13:394:29474:24:18:57:554:118:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:well-established in the firm productivity literature. The advantage of the latter is that it addresses
13:395:29576:18:15:67:554:100:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:15The ASIFP data reports firms’ industries by CSIC Rev. 1994 code from 1998 to 2002, and CSIC Rev. 2002 for

13:397:29798:12:12:57:554:73:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:Economic Activities (ISIC) industrial classification. Appendix Table A1 shows the CSIC industrial breakdown of
13:398:29908:12:0:57:349:61:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:the firms in the ASIFP database as well as domestic partner firms.

14:407:30290:24:24:57:323:385:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and, for example, strictly positive investment levels.
14:408:30344:24:24:75:554:361:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Next, we focus on both technological output and commercialized output.Patentsis the count

14:411:30631:24:24:57:554:289:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:applications in a particular year. As mentioned before, our patent data are from SIPO, which
14:412:30723:24:23:57:554:265:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:compiles complete information for all patents filed in China since 1996.New Product Ratiois a

14:414:30918:24:24:57:539:218:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:activity,Export Ratiois the ratio of a firm’s export volume in a given year over its total sales.
14:415:31015:24:24:75:556:194:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:We also want to capture the domestic partners’ ownership structures, and any political connec-

14:417:31206:24:24:57:555:146:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:is the ratio of government-owned equity over total equity. In addition, we useSubsidy, a dummy
14:418:31300:24:24:57:556:122:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:variable equal to 1 if the domestic firm receives any subsidy from the government and 0 otherwise,
14:419:31398:24:24:57:331:98:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:to account for a domestic firm’s political connections.
14:420:31453:24:0:75:555:74:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Three additional firm controls are included in our empirical model, includingEmployment,Age,
15:421:31547:0:24:57:553:722:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:andLeverage.Employmentcounts the total number of employees of the firm, a measure of firm

15:443:32530:23:24:56:554:356:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:(within-industry) FDI spillover measures, the variablesSPILLJVjtandSPILLP Tjtcapture the idea
15:444:32623:24:24:57:554:332:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:that the potential for externalities may be higher in industries where joint ventures are relatively
15:445:32723:24:24:57:103:308:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:common.
15:446:32730:24:24:75:554:284:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:The summary statistics for the above variables are presented in Table 2 for the full sample
15:447:32821:24:24:57:555:260:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of Chinese firms, joint venture firms, domestic IJV partners, and other (non-JV, non-partner)
15:448:32914:24:24:57:554:236:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Chinese firms. All of the variables are winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles to eliminate the
15:449:33013:24:24:57:554:212:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:effect of outliers. It is apparent that there appear to be underlying pre-existing differences between
15:450:33115:24:24:57:554:188:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:IJV firms and non-IJV firms. Domestic IJV partners are on average older, larger, have smaller
15:451:33208:24:24:57:555:164:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:government ownership stakes, are more export-oriented, and patent more that non-IJV partners;
15:452:33301:24:23:57:554:140:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:we will control for these underlying differences in firm attributes when estimating the determinants

15:455:33567:16:12:57:554:85:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:venture firm from its inception, whereas a joint venture partner firm switches from being a non-partner firm to
15:456:33678:12:0:57:246:73:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:being a partner firm at some point in time.

17:464:36324:23:24:57:554:555:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:rapidly raises the TFP of the joint venture, while other Chinese firms benefit only with a lag of
17:465:36421:24:24:57:555:531:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:about three years. Note that the former is an internal effect, the latter an external effect. Finally,
17:466:36523:24:24:57:554:507:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the figure is consistent with Chinese partner firms beginning to benefit from the joint venture in
17:467:36621:24:24:57:554:483:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:terms of their own TFP about six years after JV inception. Why might it take longer for Chinese
17:468:36716:24:24:57:554:459:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:partner firms to benefit from the joint ventures, even though as the firms who set up joint ventures
17:469:36816:24:24:57:554:435:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:they are in a sense more closely related to them? One reason might be that Chinese partner firms
17:470:36912:24:24:57:554:411:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:are, as we show below, relatively large and close to the technology frontier compared to other
17:471:37006:24:24:57:554:387:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Chinese firms, so it takes longer until technology transferred from the joint venture leads to a net
17:472:37106:24:24:57:329:363:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:increase in the productivity of Chinese partner firms.
17:473:37160:24:23:75:556:339:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Note that the evolution of productivity of these firms is affected by a multitude of other factors,
17:474:37259:23:24:57:554:316:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and in our econometric analysis below we will seek to isolate the part that is caused by joint

19:503:39523:0:24:57:554:722:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:results from logistic regressions of this equation.18We include various covariates one by one in
19:504:39619:24:24:57:214:698:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:order to isolate their influence.
19:505:39652:24:24:75:554:674:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Larger firms are more likely to be chosen as IJV partners (column (1)), as are younger firms
19:506:39744:24:24:56:554:650:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:(column (2)). One might expect a large amount of heterogeneity across years, provinces, and
19:507:39835:24:24:57:554:626:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:industries, and we include fixed effects in these dimensions in column (3). The results pool across

19:509:40036:24:23:57:307:578:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:does not strongly affect the results (column (4)).
19:510:40086:23:24:75:555:555:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:IJV partner selection is higher for Chinese firms that are partly foreign-owned, while government
19:511:40183:24:24:57:554:531:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ownership does not enter significantly (column (5)). Firms that are subsidized are more likely to
19:512:40280:24:24:57:554:507:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:be chosen to be a JV partner (column (6)), as are firms that sell a large fraction of their output
19:513:40378:24:24:57:554:483:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:abroad (column (7)). Foreigners interested in Chinese JV partners prefer profitable firms (column
19:514:40475:24:24:56:554:459:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:(8)); note that the coefficient on subsidization falls, consistent with the idea that subsidization
19:515:40574:24:24:57:555:435:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:increases the profitability of the firm. The final column in Table 3 shows that conditional on size,
19:516:40674:24:24:57:554:411:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:industry, and profitability, firms that are more productive are significantly more likely to be picked
19:517:40776:24:24:57:194:387:12:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:B:as partners (column (9)).19
19:518:40803:24:24:75:554:363:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:We are also interested in the role of past innovation for IJV partner choice in China; see Table
19:519:40899:24:23:57:556:339:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:4. The first variable is the sum of all invention, design, and utility model patent applications,
19:520:40996:23:24:57:554:316:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:cumulative over the three years preceding (and inclusive of) the observation year; we see that a
19:521:41092:24:24:57:554:292:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:higher level of patenting activity raises the chance that a Chinese firm is picked as a joint venture
19:522:41193:24:24:57:554:268:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:partner (column (1)). Invention patents are also positively correlated with IJV selection (see
19:523:41287:24:24:57:554:244:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:column (2)), although not quite as strongly as the lowerR2indicates. It is plausible that utility
19:524:41384:24:24:57:554:220:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:patents also matter for an emerging economy such as China. Furthermore, does product innovation
19:525:41479:24:24:57:554:196:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:matter for partner choice? The results show that firms with a relatively high ratio of new products
19:526:41578:24:24:57:556:172:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in their total sales make for more likely joint venture partners for international firms (column (3)).
19:527:41680:24:24:57:554:148:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:The new product ratio and patent measures capture different aspects of the innovation activity of
19:528:41777:24:24:57:554:124:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:these firms, with the results being somewhat stronger for the broad patent measure (see columns
19:529:41872:24:16:56:128:100:12:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:B:(4) and (5)).20
19:530:41887:16:12:67:340:84:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:18Employing probit regressions we find broadly similar results.
19:531:41950:12:12:67:467:72:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:19Our main results are robust across OLS and OP methods of computing firm productivity.
19:532:42037:12:0:67:554:60:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:20We have also considered the firm’s return on assets, leverage, and total assets as determinants of international
22:533:45042:0:46:75:475:722:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:We will take column (4) as the baseline specification in the following analysis.

22:544:45945:24:24:57:554:389:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:time-varying–implying that we cannot include firm fixed effects in this specification (as in Van

22:547:46234:23:24:57:554:318:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:whether, after controlling for firm characteristics (Xit), the outcomeyitdiffers for a joint venture

22:549:46398:24:24:75:554:270:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:The first outcome we consider is the firm’s TFP. We show results employing two methods
22:550:46484:24:24:56:554:246:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:(OLS and Olley-Pakes) of estimating firm-level TFP figures. According to either method, joint
22:551:46577:24:24:57:556:222:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ventures have a productivity that is about 30% higher than comparable non-joint venture firms.
22:552:46671:24:24:57:556:198:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:This indicates beneficial technology transfer from the foreign IJV partner to the joint venture firm.
22:553:46772:24:24:57:555:174:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:We also see that joint venture firms have higher sales as well as higher export and new-product
22:554:46867:24:24:57:554:150:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ratios. These results are important not only because they constitute new quantitative evidence for
22:555:46965:24:21:57:554:126:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:international technology transfer through joint ventures but also because in principle, other Chinese

22:558:47217:8:16:67:554:85:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:21We constrain our sample for the estimation to include only those firms that have at least five observations, for
22:559:47331:16:12:57:554:69:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:the purpose of making valid within-firm before-and-after outcome comparisons. Our results are robust to changing

23:595:48647:34:24:57:554:293:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:firms may either benefit from this technology transfer (positive spillovers) or they could be harmed
23:596:48747:24:24:57:554:269:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:by it, for example because the new international technology transfer makes joint ventures more
23:597:48841:24:24:57:554:245:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:formidable competitors and lowers sales of other Chinese firms.22We also see that joint ventures
23:598:48937:24:24:57:554:221:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:patent significantly more than comparable non-joint ventures, with a coefficient of 2.2%. This
23:599:49031:24:24:57:554:197:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:evidence across several dimensions is consistent with beneficial international technology transfer to
23:600:49132:24:24:57:155:173:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:joint venture firms.
23:601:49152:24:23:75:556:149:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Turning to the firm characteristics, we find that larger firms typically have better outcomes,
23:602:49246:23:24:57:554:126:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:while firm age is associated with lower performance. A high government ownership share tends to
23:603:49341:24:18:57:554:102:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:be associated with lower performance, while on the other hand a high share of foreign ownership
23:604:49436:18:0:67:376:84:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:22Bloom, Schankerman, and Van Reenen (2013) highlight these effects.
24:605:49506:0:24:57:554:722:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:comes with improved firm outcomes. Finally, there is evidence that firms that receive subsidies
24:606:49601:24:24:57:254:698:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:perform better than firms that do not.
24:607:49639:24:24:75:556:674:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:We now move from these newly ‘born’ joint venture firms to the Chinese IJV partner firms.
24:608:49728:24:24:57:554:650:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Typically, these firms are considerably larger than the joint venture firms (see Table 2), and while
24:609:49828:24:24:57:554:626:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:international firms have an incentive to transfer technology to the joint venture, this incentive does
24:610:49930:24:24:57:554:602:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:not to the same extent exist with regard to the Chinese partner firm. Thus, to the extent that
24:611:50024:24:23:57:554:578:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:there is internal technology transfer to Chinese partner firms, this could be a purely external effect
24:612:50126:23:24:57:554:555:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:that also exists for non-partner, non-joint venture firms, or it may be associated with a leakage
24:613:50223:24:24:57:554:531:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:effect that we refer to as intergenerational technology transfer. We estimate the same specification
24:614:50323:24:24:57:554:507:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:as in equation(2)above except that the indicator variable for a joint venture,JVi, is replaced by
24:615:50420:24:24:57:554:483:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the indicator variablePTitwhich is one for a Chinese joint venture partner firm in that year, and
24:616:50517:24:48:57:133:459:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:zero otherwise:
24:617:50532:48:34:188:554:411:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f6:A:yit=α+β1PTit+X′itγ+λj+λr+λt+εit.(3)
24:618:50567:34:24:75:554:377:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:We emphasize two strategies that help us to identify the causal impact of joint venture formation
24:619:50664:24:24:57:554:353:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:instead of spurious factors. First, we account for differences in the probability that a Chinese firm
24:620:50765:24:24:57:554:329:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:is picked to form a joint venture by applying inverse probability weights (IPWs) to each observation
24:621:50865:24:24:57:556:305:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in the regression (known as inverse probability weighting with regression adjustment, IPWRA).
24:622:50958:24:24:57:556:281:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:These weights are constructed with the predicted values from the logistic regression in Table 4,
24:623:51054:24:24:57:554:257:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:column (4), with each variable averaged at the firm level for the entire sample of firms (including
24:624:51153:24:24:57:554:233:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:firms that became partners in joint ventures prior to the beginning of the sample period), and are
24:625:51251:24:24:57:149:209:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:defined as follows:

24:634:51393:24:24:57:554:127:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:its average characteristics over the sample period. The weights in equation(4)are formulated in
24:635:51488:24:24:57:554:103:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:such a way that the firms with the largest sampling weights are those that (1) are estimated as
24:636:51583:24:0:57:554:79:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:beingunlikelyto be picked for a joint venture, butwerepicked (i.e.ˆpiis low, soP Titˆpiis high when

25:638:51778:24:24:56:554:698:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f6:B:notpicked (i.e.ˆpiis high, so1−P Tit1−ˆpiis high whenPTit= 0). As detailed in Imbens and Wooldridge
25:639:51877:24:24:56:553:674:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:(2009), the estimation ofˆpicaptures the differences between firms in their propensity to be chosen
25:640:51976:24:24:57:293:650:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:to partner with a foreign firm to form an IJV.
25:641:52022:24:24:75:554:626:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:The IPWs account for the fact that relatively larger, innovative, and exporting firms (among the
25:642:52118:24:24:57:554:602:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:other determinants of selection that we control for) are more likely to be observed as partners in
25:643:52216:24:23:57:554:578:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:joint ventures. Given these weights, the regression adjustment component of the analysis compares
25:644:52313:23:24:57:554:555:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the average differences in outcomes between “treated” firms (IJV partners) and “untreated” firms
25:645:52409:24:24:56:554:531:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:(non-IJV partners), conditioning on the firm-level variables that influence the outcome variable as
25:646:52508:24:24:57:555:507:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in a standard OLS regression, while placing more weight in the regression on treated (untreated)
25:647:52604:24:24:57:553:483:12:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:B:firms that are most similar to typical untreated (treated) firms in terms of selection probability.23
25:648:52705:24:24:57:554:459:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Second, the inclusion of fixed effects implies that our specification compares the joint venture
25:649:52801:24:24:57:554:435:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:partner firms to otherwise “similar” firms, where similar is defined as operating in the same industry
25:650:52903:24:24:57:126:411:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and province.
25:651:52916:24:24:75:553:387:12:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f13:A:Results are shown in Table 6. First of all, we see that the joint venture partner variablePTit
25:652:53010:24:24:57:555:363:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:enters with a positive coefficient that is typically also significantly different from zero. For example,
25:653:53115:24:23:57:554:339:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Chinese IJV partner firms have about 23% higher sales than other firms (column (5)). The inclusion
25:654:53213:23:24:57:554:316:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of firm employment as regressor means that this amounts to a substantial premium not only in
25:655:53305:24:24:57:554:292:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:sales but also (revenue-based) labor productivity, and note that the TFP (OLS) advantage is still
25:656:53402:24:24:57:554:268:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:around 5% (column (1)). This is consistent with a sizable intergenerational technology transfer
25:657:53497:24:24:57:554:244:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:effect. It is identified mostly from a comparison with the Chinese firms that are not associated
25:658:53593:24:24:57:554:220:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:with joint ventures, given their relatively large number. The finding of a productivity advantage of
25:659:53693:24:24:57:554:196:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Chinese partner firms over other Chinese firms is interesting in light of Figure 5 which shows that
25:660:53792:24:24:57:556:172:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:TFP of other firms rises faster than that of IJV partner firms. The results are not inconsistent,
25:661:53889:24:24:57:554:148:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:however, and can be resolved by taking into account externalities generated by joint ventures, as
25:662:53986:24:24:57:158:124:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:we will show below.
25:663:54005:24:17:75:554:100:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Second, note that the productivity effects on Chinese partner firms are smaller than those on

30:817:62257:24:24:57:554:698:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:9; on the left are results for the effects from joint ventures, on the right for externalities from the
30:818:62360:24:24:57:554:674:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Chinese partner firms that set up the joint ventures. Given our discussion above, the main focus
30:819:62456:24:24:57:199:650:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:now is the variableSPILL.
30:820:62481:24:24:75:554:626:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:We find evidence that both joint ventures and Chinese partner firms affect other firms. Note
30:821:62573:24:24:57:554:602:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:that most of the coefficients are positive, indicating that technology spillovers outweigh competition
30:822:62675:24:23:57:554:578:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:effects. In particular, the estimate for joint venture productivity externalities,SPILLJV, is around
30:823:62775:23:24:57:556:555:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:1. This figure is high compared to existing estimates for wholly-owned FDI spillovers. For example,
30:824:62874:24:24:57:554:531:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Keller and Yeaple (2009) estimate FDI spillovers of about 0.5, roughly half the size of our joint
30:825:62971:24:24:57:556:507:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:venture spillovers, and Keller and Yeaple’s estimates are larger than found in most papers. Second,
30:826:63070:24:24:57:554:483:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the results show that externalities from joint ventures tend to be larger than externalities from joint
30:827:63173:24:24:57:554:459:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:venture partner firms. This result is in line with the earlier finding that the direct, internalized
30:828:63273:24:24:57:554:435:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:effect of technology transfer from the international firm to the joint venture is stronger than
30:829:63368:24:24:57:554:411:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the intergenerational effect, because the relatively strong internalized transfer translates into a
30:830:63467:24:24:57:554:387:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:relatively high intra-industry externality. The largest gains are for sales, followed by increases in
30:831:63568:24:24:57:554:363:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:productivity. In contrast we find negative coefficients in the patenting equations, significantly so
30:832:63668:24:23:57:555:339:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:for Chinese (joint venture) partner firms. One explanation for this may be the role of competition,
30:833:63767:23:24:57:548:316:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:which may be particularly strong because patent races are by definition winner-takes-all events.
30:834:63863:24:24:75:554:292:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:An important question is whether all Chinese firms benefit to the same extent from these
30:835:63951:24:24:57:554:268:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:industry-level externalities. To see whether there is evidence for heterogeneous effects we have
30:836:64047:24:24:57:554:244:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:re-estimated these specifications for several subsamples. Generally, we find that the joint ventures
30:837:64147:24:24:57:554:220:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:themselves benefit most from the externalities of other joint ventures and the more established
30:838:64242:24:24:57:555:196:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Chinese partner firms. Table 10 gives theSPILLcoefficients in the TFP (OLS) regression for four

32:856:66861:24:24:57:555:522:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Across all four samples in Table 10 the TFP coefficient is estimated quite similarly, which is not
32:857:66959:24:24:57:554:498:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:surprising since the non-JV, non-Partner firms are the large majority of the sample.26While our
32:858:67054:24:24:57:554:474:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:estimates across samples are not significantly different in a statistical sense, nevertheless the point
32:859:67157:24:23:57:556:450:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:estimates provides useful information on the size of spillovers to different firms (Table 10, first row).
32:860:67262:23:24:57:554:427:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:If we drop the joint venture firms, the point estimate falls from 1 to 0.97, whereas if instead we drop
32:861:67365:24:24:57:554:403:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the Chinese partner firms the point estimate increases to 1.05. The latter is evidence that spillovers
32:862:67467:24:24:57:554:379:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:from joint ventures benefitotherjoint ventures most strongly, while the former suggests that other
32:863:67565:24:24:57:556:355:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Chinese firms benefit from joint venture spillovers more than the more established partner firms.
32:864:67662:24:24:57:554:331:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Turning to spillovers from Chinese partner firms, we also see here evidence that other Chinese firms
32:865:67762:24:24:57:556:307:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and in particular joint ventures benefit more than other Chinese partner firms (Table 10, row 2).
32:866:67859:24:24:57:554:283:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Thus, there is evidence for two-way technology transfer between joint ventures and Chinese partner
32:867:67957:24:24:57:554:259:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:firms. Partner firms benefit from intergenerational technology transfer from the joint venture they
32:868:68056:24:24:57:554:235:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:set up, while joint ventures benefit from industry-level externalities generated by Chinese partner
32:869:68155:24:24:57:86:211:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:firms.
32:870:68161:24:23:75:555:187:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Why might joint venture firms themselves be the greatest beneficiaries from positive technology
32:871:68256:23:24:57:554:164:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:externalities through joint ventures in China? One explanation is the notion of the so-called
32:872:68349:24:24:57:554:140:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:absorptive capacity. Cohen and Levinthal (1990) argue that there are two reasons why firms
32:873:68439:24:24:57:554:116:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:make technology investments: first, because they want to innovate, and second, because they
32:874:68530:24:16:57:554:92:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:want to be able to benefit from the innovation efforts of others—Cohen and Levinthal’s notion of
32:875:68626:16:0:67:468:76:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:26We include the other Chinese firms in all samples because it provides a useful benchmark.
33:876:68719:0:24:57:554:722:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:absorptive capacity. Joint ventures in China are typically technologically advanced and innovative
33:877:68817:24:24:57:554:698:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:through the technology transfer from their international partner. Those firms will tend to have a
33:878:68914:24:24:57:554:674:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:higher absorptive capacity to benefit from technological developments external to the firm than the
33:879:69013:24:46:57:555:650:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:average Chinese firm, and consequently, they benefit more strongly from industry-level spillovers.

33:882:69188:31:24:75:554:541:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Joint venture effects might vary across several dimensions. It may be that firms in particular
33:883:69282:24:24:57:554:517:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:industries are impacted differently from those in other industries, or that the country from which
33:884:69380:24:24:57:554:493:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the foreign partner in an IJV originates matters. In this section we examine whether the country
33:885:69476:24:24:57:554:469:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of origin of a firm’s joint venture partner plays a role in determining the magnitude of the effects
33:886:69576:24:24:57:554:445:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:uncovered in the previous section. We distinguish three sources of foreign joint venture partner
33:887:69672:24:24:57:555:421:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:that account for the large majority (see Figure 3 in Section 2) of all joint ventures in China: (1)
33:888:69771:24:24:57:554:397:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan (HMT); (2) Japan; and (3) the United States of America. As we
33:889:69861:24:24:57:554:373:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:will see, the effects vary substantially across the country of origin of the joint venture partner. We
33:890:69963:24:24:57:507:349:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:begin with the technology transfer to joint ventures. The results are shown in Table 11.

33:893:70230:23:24:57:554:278:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Macau, or Taiwan partner is negative (not significant), suggesting that technology transfer from an
33:894:70329:24:24:57:554:254:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:international partner in these economies is below-average (column (2)). The interaction coefficient
33:895:70428:24:24:57:554:230:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:for Japanese partners is positive but small, while in contrast the U.S. coefficient is positive and
33:896:70527:24:24:57:554:206:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:significant (columns (3) and (4)). According to our estimates, U.S. partners roughly double the
33:897:70622:24:24:57:554:182:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:productivity gains of joint ventures, relative to non-U.S. foreign partners. One explanation for this
33:898:70723:24:24:57:554:158:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:is that U.S. firms tend to be closer to the world’s technology frontier than non-U.S. firms, and as a
33:899:70824:24:24:57:493:134:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:consequence they transfer more (or better) technology to their Chinese joint venture.

33:902:71099:24:0:57:554:62:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:joint ventures formed with U.S. partners generate higher positive spillovers than joint ventures

35:964:73248:24:24:57:554:333:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ventures there would be no significantly positive spillover effect from joint ventures in China. At the

35:969:73740:24:24:57:554:213:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:which may be different given Japan’s relative geographic proximity to China in comparison with
35:970:73834:24:24:57:554:189:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the U.S., or it could be related to the industry composition of Japanese versus U.S. joint ventures
35:971:73933:24:24:57:499:165:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in China if positive spillovers vary by industry. We will turn to industry effects below.
35:972:74022:24:23:75:554:141:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:In Table 13 we examine the propensity to export as an alternative performance measure. We see

36:1002:75639:24:23:57:554:227:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:with other Chinese firms, and it may reflect to some extent that industries with a strong presence
36:1003:75737:23:24:57:554:204:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of Japanese joint ventures generate learning effects for other Chinese firms about how to break
36:1004:75832:24:24:57:190:180:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:into the Japanese market.
36:1005:75857:24:24:75:557:156:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:We have also considered differences by foreign investor country for Chinese partner firm effects.
36:1006:75954:24:24:57:554:132:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Generally, there is less evidence for significant differences across countries, in part because the
36:1007:76053:24:24:57:554:108:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:intergenerational transfer effects are smaller to begin with (see above). At the same time, the
36:1008:76148:24:0:57:554:84:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:patterns of point estimates are consistent with stronger technology transfers from the U.S. than
37:1009:76246:0:24:57:554:722:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:from Japan or HMT.27This indicates that the relatively strong technology transfer effects from
37:1010:76340:24:24:57:554:698:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:U.S. firms to their joint ventures in China carry over to relatively strong intergenerational effects
37:1011:76441:24:41:57:275:674:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:to the Chinese joint venture partner firms.

37:1013:76513:31:24:75:554:602:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:A large literature examines heterogeneity of FDI spillovers across industries. The extent of the
37:1014:76609:24:24:57:554:578:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:internal and external technology transfer effects of joint ventures might depend on the characteristics
37:1015:76712:24:24:57:554:554:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of particular industries, such as the degree to which firms in a given industry possess the absorptive
37:1016:76814:24:24:57:554:530:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:capacity to benefit from foreign know-how.28A well-known result in the area of intra-industry
37:1017:76907:24:24:57:554:506:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:spillovers is that they are increasing with the R&D intensity of the industry (Keller and Yeaple
37:1018:77003:24:24:57:554:482:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:2009). In this section we provide evidence on industry variation in both internalized and external
37:1019:77101:24:23:57:223:458:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:effects of Chinese joint ventures.
37:1020:77135:23:24:75:555:435:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Figure 6 shows industry variation in the effects of international technology transfer to joint
37:1021:77229:24:24:57:554:411:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ventures, analogous to the results of Table 5. On the left side there is evidence for stronger
37:1022:77323:24:24:57:554:387:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:international technology transfer to joint ventures in more R&D-intensive industries. This is
37:1023:77416:24:24:57:554:363:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:plausible because it is these industries, especially in manufacturing, in which the technology gap
37:1024:77514:24:24:57:554:339:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:between foreign and local firms tends to be largest. Furthermore, on the right we see that technology
37:1025:77615:24:24:57:554:315:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:transfer to the joint venture is increasing in the foreign ownership share. A likely reason for this is
37:1026:77718:24:24:57:554:291:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:that a relatively high foreign ownership share means less technology leakage from the point of view
37:1027:77817:24:24:57:554:267:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:of the foreign investor; alternatively, a higher degree of foreign ownership might further incentivize
37:1028:77919:24:24:57:405:243:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the foreign investor to transfer more know-how to the joint venture.
37:1029:77987:24:24:75:554:219:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:We have seen above that there are positive industry externalities from both Chinese partner
37:1030:78078:24:23:57:554:195:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:firms and the joint ventures they set up with foreign partners. The source of the partner firm effects
37:1031:78180:23:24:57:555:172:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:is the intergenerational transfer effect from joint venture to Chinese partner firm, which, in turn,
37:1032:78280:24:18:57:554:148:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:depends on the technology transfer between foreign firm and joint venture. An important question
37:1033:78376:18:16:67:554:130:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:27For example, the point estimates for the U.S., Japan, and HMT for Chinese partner firm effects analogous to
37:1034:78485:16:8:57:391:114:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:the joint venture effects of Table 11 are 0.193, 0.005, and 0.004, respectively.
37:1035:78565:8:16:67:554:106:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:28Howell (2016) is a recent study of joint venture effects in China’s automobile industry. Estimating the impact
37:1036:78677:16:12:57:554:90:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:of higher fuel efficiency standards starting in 2009 on innovative activity, she finds that Chinese partners to IJVs fall
37:1037:78798:12:12:57:554:78:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:behind compared to foreign firms because the partner firms re-direct their focus on lower-quality cars while leaving
37:1038:78914:12:0:57:489:66:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:at the same time the high-quality market segment with higher fuel efficiency to their joint venture.

39:1113:80708:46:23:57:554:418:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:concerns the relative size of the technology transfers, and whether they depend on characteristics
39:1114:80806:23:24:57:554:395:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:such as foreign ownership share. Figure 7 shows evidence on this. Depicted is the difference
39:1115:80898:24:24:57:554:371:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:between the partner spillover TFP effect and the joint venture spillover TFP effect across industries
39:1116:80999:24:24:56:554:347:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:(by quintiles). This difference is generally negative, confirming our result from above that joint
39:1117:81097:24:24:57:554:323:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ventures generate larger industry externalities than partner firms. However, the figure also shows
39:1118:81195:24:24:57:555:299:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:that except for a small set of industries in which foreign ownership is essentially ruled out by law,
39:1119:81296:24:24:57:556:275:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:quintile 1, there is a positive relationship between the relative partner effect and foreign ownership.
39:1120:81399:24:24:57:554:251:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:This means that while high foreign ownership of the joint venture is associated with relatively high
39:1121:81499:24:24:57:554:227:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:levels of foreign technology transfer to the joint venture, which is plausible from an internalization
39:1122:81601:24:24:57:554:203:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:perspective, it is also associated with relatively high technology leakage as evidenced by relatively
39:1123:81702:24:24:57:554:179:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:high industry externalities generated by Chinese partner firms. Overall, this result highlights that
39:1124:81802:24:23:57:555:155:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:foreign firms’ optimal investment strategies in China have to balance a number of key factors,
39:1125:81896:23:0:57:432:132:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:including the amount of technology transfer and foreign ownership share.

40:1154:83106:31:24:75:553:249:12:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:A:The entry of China into the WTO in December 2001 led to a number of changes in FDI policy.29
40:1155:83198:24:24:57:554:225:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:Here we are interested in whether the WTO accession has affected the magnitude of industry-level
40:1156:83294:24:24:57:554:201:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:spillovers in China. To address this issue we perform separate regressions for the years 1998 to
40:1157:83390:24:24:57:554:177:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:2001 and 2002 to 2007. This sample split is natural given that 2002 was China’s first full year of
40:1158:83488:24:24:57:554:153:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:WTO membership, even though there may have been some anticipation effects before 2002, as well
40:1159:83582:24:24:57:379:129:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:as other effects that manifest themselves only with a short lag.
40:1160:83646:24:18:75:554:105:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Table 15 shows the results, with results for industry spillovers generated by joint ventures on the
40:1161:83745:18:15:67:554:87:7:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f10:F:29Lu, Tao, and Zhu (2017), for example, have studied the impact of FDI on firm productivity in China by
40:1162:83848:15:12:57:554:72:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:exploiting the fact that China opened up an additional 24% of manufacturing industries to FDI. See also section
40:1163:83959:12:0:57:108:60:10:g_d0_f10:10:g_d0_f10:F:3.4.4 below.
41:1164:83973:0:24:57:554:722:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:left and those generated by Chinese partner firms on the right. We see that as before, productivity
41:1165:84072:24:24:57:556:698:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:spillovers generated by the joint venture firms are larger than those due to Chinese partner firms.
41:1166:84171:24:24:57:554:674:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:The key finding of Table 15, however, is that both industry externalities are much larger (and
41:1167:84265:24:24:57:554:650:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:significant) in the post-WTO entry period. There might be a number of reasons for this. One
41:1168:84356:24:24:57:554:626:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:possibility may be that externalities increased due to new sectoral composition, given that China
41:1169:84453:24:24:57:554:602:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:opened up additional sectors to FDI, although it is hard to see that composition effects explain
41:1170:84549:24:23:57:554:578:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the entire finding. Another possibility is that China’s entry into the WTO reduced uncertainty
41:1171:84643:23:24:57:554:555:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:about a future policy change towards a more restrictive regime. Finally, given the well-established
41:1172:84742:24:24:57:554:531:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:result that Chinese firm performance has improved with China’s accession to the WTO, another
41:1173:84834:24:24:57:554:507:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:explanation for our results is an absorptive capacity argument: China’s stronger firms have become
41:1174:84932:24:24:57:432:483:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:more successful in benefiting from industry-level technology externalities.
41:1175:85007:24:24:75:554:459:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:These explanations, of course, are not mutually exclusive and it will be important in future
41:1176:85099:24:41:57:318:435:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:research to distinguish between these explanations.

41:1178:85194:31:24:75:554:363:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:It is interesting to examine technology transfer effects of joint ventures in relation to China’s

41:1189:86266:24:24:57:554:100:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:incentives for foreign investors such as lower tax rates. Conversely, those industries comprised of

42:1219:87903:24:24:57:554:187:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:transfer due to international joint ventures occurs only in broad sectors which are generally open
42:1220:88001:24:24:57:554:163:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:to international joint ventures, and they do not occur in sectors characterized by frequent joint

42:1222:88188:24:24:75:554:115:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:As column (2) of Table 16 shows, we find parallel results for positive industry externalities from
42:1223:88286:24:24:57:554:91:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:joint ventures. They essentially do not materialize in sectors that include activities in which joint
42:1224:88387:24:0:57:554:67:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ventures are prohibited. One interpretation of this is that China’s policy towards certain types of
43:1225:88488:0:54:57:415:722:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:foreign investment effectively deters international technology transfer.

43:1227:88574:36:24:75:554:632:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:IJVs comprise a major channel for FDI, particularly for multinationals that establish operations
43:1228:88670:24:24:57:554:608:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in China. The effects of IJV formation are multifaceted, and we delineate our analysis in several
43:1229:88767:24:24:57:554:584:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ways. Importantly, our empirical approach allows us to distinguish the Chinese firm forming the
43:1230:88862:24:24:57:554:560:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:joint venture from the newly set-up joint venture firm itself in a comprehensive data set of Chinese
43:1231:88962:24:24:57:554:536:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:firms. We have investigated the attributes of firms, be it market share, stock of technology, or
43:1232:89058:24:24:57:554:512:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:regulatory expertise, that are conducive to being picked as Chinese partners to foreign investors
43:1233:89155:24:23:57:554:488:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:seeking to enter the Chinese market. Generally, foreign investors seek out profitable, large, and
43:1234:89252:23:24:57:554:465:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:highly productive firms, as well as firms that demonstrate high rates of export participation and
43:1235:89349:24:24:57:554:441:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:patenting. Firms that receive government subsidies—implicitly, those firms with well-developed
43:1236:89443:24:24:57:554:417:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:political connections—also tend to be more likely to be chosen as joint venture partners. While
43:1237:89538:24:24:57:554:393:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the existing literature has explored such issues in partner choice, the fact that we approach the
43:1238:89635:24:24:57:554:369:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:question with a novel data set in an econometric framework deepens our understanding of the
43:1239:89726:24:24:57:239:345:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:empirical determinants of selection.
43:1240:89762:24:24:75:556:321:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:We then explore the effects that materialize subsequent to the creation of the joint venture,
43:1241:89855:24:24:57:556:297:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:not only on the joint venture itself but also on the domestic partner and other Chinese firms.
43:1242:89949:24:24:57:554:273:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:The firms created by IJVs benefit from their foreign parentage, as evidenced by their enhanced
43:1243:90043:24:24:57:554:249:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:performance along multiple dimensions, including in their sales, productivity, and innovation
43:1244:90136:24:23:57:554:225:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:activities—compelling evidence for the internal effect of international technology transfer arising
43:1245:90235:23:24:57:554:202:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:from joint ventures. Further, we find evidence for the existence of indirect technology transfer
43:1246:90331:24:24:56:555:178:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:(a phenomenon that we characterize as the intergenerational technology transfer effect) whereby
43:1247:90426:24:24:57:554:154:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the domestic partners of joint ventures themselves perform better after the inception of the joint
43:1248:90524:24:24:57:98:130:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:venture.
43:1249:90532:24:24:75:554:106:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Extending this analysis to the industry level, we show that joint venture firms—beneficiaries of
43:1250:90628:24:24:57:554:82:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:advanced foreign technology and know-how—generate positive externalities to domestic firms that
43:1251:90723:24:0:57:555:58:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:operate in the same industry. Foreign technology diffuses beyond the confines of the joint venture,
44:1252:90824:0:24:57:554:722:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and the resulting productivity spillovers from joint ventures we find to be larger than those arising
44:1253:90925:24:24:57:554:698:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:from other forms of FDI. The Chinese partner firms in IJVs likewise generate positive spillovers
44:1254:91021:24:24:57:554:674:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:when they operate in the same industry, though this effect is more muted than that arising from the
44:1255:91120:24:24:57:554:650:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:joint venture firms themselves (which accords with our finding of the intergenerational technology
44:1256:91218:24:24:57:554:626:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:transfer effect being smaller than the direct internal effect). Both types of externalities are realized
44:1257:91322:24:24:57:554:602:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:most strongly by the joint venture firms, suggesting that their advanced technology bolsters their
44:1258:91420:24:23:57:554:578:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:absorptive capacity to benefit from such spillovers. We also consider several aspects of heterogeneity
44:1259:91522:23:24:57:554:555:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:in how these effects are transmitted. In line with previous literature, external effects from joint
44:1260:91621:24:24:57:554:531:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:ventures are highest in R&D-intensive industries, and the largest externalities tend to arise in
44:1261:91717:24:24:57:554:507:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:industries with a large concentration of joint ventures with a U.S. partner. Finally, with regard
44:1262:91814:24:24:57:554:483:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:to Chinese policy towards foreign investment, we show that positive technology externalities are
44:1263:91910:24:24:57:554:459:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:effectively negated in industries with a large number of prohibitions on what types of foreign
44:1264:92004:24:24:57:177:435:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:investment are allowed.
44:1265:92027:24:24:75:554:411:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:Ultimately, IJVs occupy an important role in the arena of foreign investment. Based on our
44:1266:92117:24:24:57:554:387:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:findings, the unique nature of such arrangements between domestic firms and foreign partners
44:1267:92209:24:24:57:555:363:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:generates far-reaching impacts manifest themselves both for the firms within the arrangements,
44:1268:92303:24:23:57:554:339:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and for firms outside the joint venture. The literature on multinationals has expended significant
44:1269:92401:23:24:57:554:316:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:effort in quantifying the effects of FDI; however, the specific role of joint ventures has remained
44:1270:92500:24:24:57:554:292:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:underexplored. At a broad level, our results serve to inform our understanding of effective foreign
44:1271:92599:24:24:57:554:268:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:investment policy. As China has liberalized its foreign investment environment, encouraging the
44:1272:92694:24:24:57:554:244:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:establishment of WFOEs and opening more sectors to foreign entry, the ensuing reduction in the
44:1273:92788:24:24:57:554:220:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:utilization of joint ventures promises to impact the way in which knowledge is transmitted between
44:1274:92886:24:24:57:554:196:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:firms. While channels for learning and technology transfer might arise from WFOEs (perhaps via
44:1275:92980:24:24:57:554:172:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:labor turnover, intermediate input sourcing, or broader learning effects), the fact that domestic
44:1276:93077:24:24:57:554:148:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:firms play no direct role in this type of investment shuts down the potential international technology
44:1277:93179:24:24:57:554:124:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:transfer effects revealed in joint venture firms and the intergenerational effects accruing to partner
44:1278:93281:24:24:57:554:100:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:firms. Additionally, WFOEs are likely to be better equipped to safeguard their intellectual property
44:1279:93381:24:0:57:554:76:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:and proprietary technologies from being disseminated to domestic firms, dampening the innovation
45:1280:93479:0:24:57:554:722:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:externalities that we find evidence for, while potentially sapping market share from domestic
45:1281:93572:24:24:57:554:698:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:competitors—in other words, the move away from IJVs might amplify the negatives and attenuate
45:1282:93665:24:24:57:554:674:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:the positives arising from foreign investment. Future work might consider the effects of the various
45:1283:93765:24:24:57:554:650:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:modes of foreign investment jointly, particularly in light of the explosion of WFOEs in China in
45:1284:93861:24:0:57:121:626:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:B:recent years.
