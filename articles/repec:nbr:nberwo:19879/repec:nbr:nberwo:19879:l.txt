2:28:1489:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:This article develops two points.  First, insurance against the risk of legal change is largely unavailable,
2:29:1597:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:primarily because of the correlated nature of the losses that legal change generates.  Second, given
2:30:1697:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:the absence of insurance against legal change, it is generally desirable for legal change to be attenuated.
2:31:1804:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:Specifically, in a model of uncertainty about two different types of legal change—in regulatory standards,
2:32:1910:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:and in payments for harm caused—it is demonstrated that the optimal new regulatory standard is less
2:33:2009:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:than the conventionally efficient standard, and that the optimal new payment for harm is less than

3:57:3047:14:13:72:149:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:1.  Introduction 
3:58:3063:13:14:108:509:488:144:Times:144:Times:A:One of the major categories of risk facing individuals and firms is that the law may 
3:59:3148:14:14:72:496:474:144:Times:144:Times:B:change.  Homeowners, for example, confront the prospect that the mortgage interest tax 
3:60:3235:14:14:72:516:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:deduction will be eliminated; firms bear the risk that new regulations concerning workplace 
3:61:3327:14:14:72:512:446:144:Times:144:Times:B:safety or environmental harm will be enacted; and fishermen live with the possibility that a 
3:62:3420:14:13:72:540:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:fishery will be declared off-limits.  Such risks of legal change are inevitable, as they are a natural 
3:63:3523:13:14:71:390:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:byproduct of economic, technological, and political uncertainties. 
3:64:3590:14:14:107:536:405:144:Times:144:Times:A:A hallmark of the risk of legal change is that it is largely uninsurable.  As is described in 
3:65:3684:14:14:71:508:391:144:Times:144:Times:B:Section 2.1, insurance against legal change is for the most part nonexistent as an empirical 
3:66:3777:14:14:71:521:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:matter.  In contrast, insurance against property losses, medical needs, and all manner of other 
3:67:3873:14:13:71:222:363:144:Times:144:Times:B:adverse events is widespread.   
3:68:3905:13:14:107:540:350:144:Times:144:Times:A:Why is insurance coverage against legal change mainly unavailable?  I suggest in Section 
3:69:3994:14:14:72:526:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:2.2 that the root of the explanation lies in the correlated nature of the losses usually associated 
3:70:4094:14:14:72:508:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:with changes in legal rules.  If, for instance, the use of a fishery were barred, all fishermen 
3:71:4190:14:13:72:492:308:144:Times:144:Times:B:earning income from it would simultaneously suffer losses.  Hence, insurers could face 
3:72:4277:13:14:72:507:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:substantial risks were they to sell coverage against changes in the law.  However, as I also 
3:73:4370:14:14:71:518:281:144:Times:144:Times:B:discuss, insurers should be able to alleviate these risks in various ways, implying that a fully 
3:74:4467:14:14:71:505:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:satisfactory explanation of reality involves factors in addition to the correlation of losses.  
3:75:4563:14:14:108:523:253:144:Times:144:Times:A:In any event, because insurance against legal change is generally unavailable in fact, I 
3:76:4652:14:13:72:522:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:assume that such coverage cannot be purchased in a model of uncertainty about the law that I 
3:77:4745:13:14:72:540:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:analyze in Section 3.  Under that assumption, as well as the assumption that parties subject to the 
3:78:4845:14:14:72:536:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:law are risk averse, the principal analytical point of the article is developed: legal change should 
3:79:4946:14:14:72:498:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:be attenuated, that is, legal change should be less than would be conventionally efficient 
3:80:5037:14:29:72:529:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:(efficient in a risk-neutral world—efficient according to the customary cost-benefit calculus).

4:88:5741:0:13:108:533:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:To amplify, in the model, there is a risk that an activity will be discovered to be harmful 
4:89:5833:13:14:72:527:695:144:Times:144:Times:B:by the state.  In that case, a law addressing the harmful activity will be adopted; thus there is a 
4:90:5933:14:14:72:517:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:risk of legal change.  If the activity is found to be harmful, individuals are able to reduce the 
4:91:6031:14:14:71:445:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:likelihood of harm by exercising costly care (effort or investment in safety).   
4:92:6112:14:14:107:530:653:144:Times:144:Times:A:One type of legal change that is considered is the adoption of a regulation, under which 
4:93:6201:14:13:71:537:639:144:Times:144:Times:B:the state would mandate a level of care.  (Regulation may also be interpreted as effective control 
4:94:6300:13:14:71:535:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:of care by the courts through the application of the negligence rule.)  The uninsurable risk borne 
4:95:6399:14:14:71:511:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:by parties involved in the activity is that, if it is revealed to be harmful, a regulation will be 
4:96:6498:14:14:71:510:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:employed and parties will have to expend resources to meet the required level of care.  For 
4:97:6590:14:14:71:538:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:example, gasoline service station owners might have to replace their gasoline holding tanks with 
4:98:6687:14:13:71:528:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:different tanks that are less likely to leak in order to satisfy new environmental regulations.  In 
4:99:6787:13:14:71:523:557:144:Times:144:Times:B:the presence of such risks of bearing regulatory compliance costs, it is shown that the optimal 
4:100:6883:14:14:71:404:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:regulatory standard is less than the conventionally efficient standard. 
4:101:6955:14:14:107:543:529:144:Times:144:Times:A:The rationale for this basic result is, in essence, that if the stipulated standard of care were 
4:102:7052:14:14:71:518:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:equal to the conventionally efficient level, a marginal relaxation of the standard would leave 
4:103:7147:14:13:71:517:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:expected social costs essentially unchanged.1  But the slight reduction of the standard would 
4:104:7241:13:14:72:502:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:produce a social benefit by lowering risk-bearing for the risk-averse parties subject to the 
4:105:7334:14:14:72:505:474:144:Times:144:Times:B:standard.  Thus, it is always socially desirable for the standard of care to be less than (and 
4:106:7429:14:14:72:452:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:perhaps to be much less than) the level that would be conventionally efficient.  
4:107:7510:14:14:108:538:446:144:Times:144:Times:A:The other type of legal change that is analyzed is the adoption of strict liability, requiring 
4:108:7605:14:13:72:534:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:a payment of damages to victims of harm.  (Strict liability is effectively equivalent in the model 
4:109:7704:13:14:72:522:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:to fines or corrective taxes.)  Here the risk that individuals bear concerns damages2 as well as 
4:110:7801:14:14:72:534:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:costs of care (for individuals will be induced to take care if the activity is found to be harmful).  
4:111:7903:14:14:72:524:391:144:Times:144:Times:B:It is shown that the optimal magnitude of damages is less than the harm.3  The ground for this 
4:112:7998:14:14:72:526:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:conclusion is similar to that for the conclusion about the desirable regulatory standard of care. 
4:113:8096:14:13:107:507:363:144:Times:144:Times:A:In Section 4, I make several concluding comments about the model, concerning its 
4:114:8177:13:14:71:521:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:generality and importance, the attenuation of legal change in reality (such as through delayed 
4:115:8272:14:14:71:537:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:implementation of laws and grandfathering), and a policy of government compensation for legal 
4:116:8366:14:14:71:114:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:change.  
4:117:8375:14:13:107:535:308:144:Times:144:Times:A:Before proceeding, let me comment on prior writing on which I build.  The most closely 
4:118:8462:13:14:71:506:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:related articles to this one are by Blume and Rubinfeld (1984), who address governmental 
4:119:8551:14:14:71:529:281:144:Times:144:Times:B:takings, and by Masur and Nash (2010), who examine legal change generally.  In both of these 
4:120:8644:14:14:71:517:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:articles, the authors observe that insurance against the legal risks that they consider does not 
4:121:8741:14:14:71:539:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:exist, and they propose that the provision of compensation by the government might be desirable 
4:122:8837:14:27:71:506:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:as a substitute.  I consider a different policy response to the absence of insurance, namely, 
4:123:8931:27:7:107:254:212:144:Times:144:Times:A:                                                 
4:124:8980:7:16:108:538:205:42:Times:100:Times:F:1 At the conventionally efficient level of care, the marginal gain from the cost savings due to a reduction in 
4:125:9091:16:12:72:443:189:100:Times:100:Times:F:the level of care must equal the marginal loss from the resulting increase in expected harm.

4:127:9186:7:16:108:542:170:42:Times:100:Times:F:2 More precisely, the risk is of having to pay expected damages.  In particular, I assume in the model that, if 
4:128:9298:16:11:72:505:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:strict liability is adopted, individuals can then purchase liability insurance coverage at actuarially fair rates.  
4:129:9414:11:12:72:541:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:Therefore, individuals do not turn out to bear a risk of having to pay actual damages.  However, individuals still face 
4:130:9534:12:11:72:499:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:the risk of having to pay the insurance premium for the damages coverage that they will elect to purchase. 
4:131:9641:11:7:108:111:120:100:Times:100:Times:F: 
4:132:9641:7:16:108:542:113:42:Times:100:Times:F:3 This is true whether victims of harm are risk neutral or risk averse, as shown in Propositions 3 and 4.  It is  
4:133:9755:16:12:72:507:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:also demonstrated that the optimal level of damages is zero for all harms sufficiently low; see Proposition 3.

5:135:9870:0:13:72:503:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:attenuation of legal change.4  Moreover, I offer an alternative primary explanation for the 
5:136:9962:13:14:72:471:695:144:Times:144:Times:B:absence of insurance coverage—correlation of the losses caused by legal change.5  
5:137:10044:14:14:108:510:681:144:Times:144:Times:A:The foregoing articles are part of a larger, economically-oriented literature on legal 
5:138:10131:14:14:72:540:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:change.  This literature began with Graetz (1977) and Kaplow (1986), and continued with Logue 
5:139:10225:14:14:72:497:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:(1993), Levmore (1999), Shaviro (2000),  and Nash and Revesz (2007), among others.6  
5:140:10310:14:13:72:537:639:144:Times:144:Times:B:Somewhat surprisingly, with the exception of the two articles noted in the preceding paragraph,  
5:141:10407:13:14:72:529:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:none of the writing on legal change recognizes the unavailability of insurance against it.7  As a 
5:142:10505:14:14:71:531:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:partial consequence, Graetz (1977) and Kaplow (1986) come to the judgment that legal change 
5:143:10597:14:14:71:516:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:should be guided by conventional efficiency criteria and that compensation for legal change 
5:144:10689:14:14:71:537:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:ordinarily should not be provided.  Although other writers sometimes differ in their conclusions, 
5:145:10787:14:13:71:438:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:that is not because of the absence of insurance coverage for legal change.     
5:146:10866:13:14:107:512:557:144:Times:144:Times:A:Also of relevance is an earlier article of mine, Shavell (1982), which begins with an 
5:147:10952:14:14:71:539:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:analysis of optimal liability rules in the absence of insurance.  I show there that optimal damages 
5:148:11052:14:14:71:542:529:144:Times:144:Times:B:under strict liability are less than harm, which is similar to the result here when there is a risk that 
5:149:11157:14:14:71:509:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:a strict liability rule will be adopted.  But my earlier article also concludes that the optimal 
5:150:11254:14:13:71:510:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:standard of care equals the conventionally efficient level, which is different from the result 
5:151:11349:13:14:71:484:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:demonstrated here when there is a risk that a new standard of care will be employed.8

5:155:11486:14:13:72:266:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:2.1 The fact of the absence of insurance 
5:156:11527:13:14:108:535:419:144:Times:144:Times:A:Insurance against legal change is not generally sold in the insurance market.  That this is 
5:157:11619:14:14:72:531:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:so can be verified in a number of ways.  First, the categories of coverage that insurers state that 
5:158:11719:14:14:72:516:391:144:Times:144:Times:B:they market do not include legal change.  For example, insurers such as Allstate, Geico, and 
5:159:11812:14:14:72:523:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:Travelers list as major categories of coverage automobile, property, life, health, homeowners, 
5:160:11907:14:13:72:537:363:144:Times:144:Times:B:liability, and a number of others, but none mention legal change as a type of coverage.9  Second, 
5:161:12005:13:43:72:523:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:reference works and textbooks on insurance do not describe legal change as a distinct risk for

5:163:12149:8:16:108:542:299:42:Times:100:Times:F:4 Neither Blume and Rubinfeld (1984) nor Masur and Nash (2010) analyze the policy of relaxing regulatory 
5:164:12254:16:11:72:539:283:100:Times:100:Times:F:standards.  Instead, as just stated, they focus on the policy of government compensation for legal change.  Similarly, 
5:165:12373:11:12:72:495:272:100:Times:100:Times:F:other writing about legal change (see the next paragraph) also mainly considers the policy of government 
5:166:12478:12:11:72:394:260:100:Times:100:Times:F:compensation for legal change, not the policy of reducing regulatory standards.

5:168:12562:7:16:108:516:242:42:Times:100:Times:F:5 Blume and Rubinfeld (1984) emphasize moral hazard as the main explanation, and Masur and Nash 
5:169:12658:16:12:72:458:226:100:Times:100:Times:F:(2007) focus on the inability of insurers to price coverage.  I discuss their views in Section 2.2.

5:175:12996:16:11:72:539:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:change exists.  Kaplow, however,  considers the theoretical possibility of this type of insurance (at pp. 536-550) and 
5:176:13115:11:12:72:435:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:argues that there should be no significant problem with its efficient supply by the market.

6:182:13499:0:13:72:531:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:which coverage is available.10  Third, knowledgeable individuals whom I have contacted in the 
6:183:13593:13:14:72:507:695:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurance industry and in academia concur that insurance coverage against legal change is 
6:184:13683:14:14:72:180:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:chiefly unavailable.11  
6:185:13707:14:14:108:539:667:144:Times:144:Times:A:Thus, if we ask whether the risks due to legal change that I mentioned in the Introduction 
6:186:13798:14:14:72:538:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:are insurable, the answer is no.  It does not seem possible for homeowners to purchase insurance 
6:187:13895:14:13:72:533:639:144:Times:144:Times:B:coverage against elimination of the mortgage interest tax deduction, for gasoline service station 
6:188:13993:13:14:72:540:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:owners to arrange coverage for the expense of having to install new gasoline holding tanks or for 
6:189:14091:14:14:72:541:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:businesses generally to secure coverage against the cost of meeting new regulatory requirements, 
6:190:14188:14:14:72:368:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:or for fishermen to obtain coverage against bans on fishing.12 
6:191:14250:14:14:108:534:584:144:Times:144:Times:A:There is, however, an implicit exception to the absence of coverage against legal change 
6:192:14339:14:13:72:520:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:of note.  Namely, significant protection against modifications in liability rules is provided by 
6:193:14436:13:14:72:539:557:144:Times:144:Times:B:standard liability insurance policies.  Although the principal role of liability insurance is to cover 
6:194:14539:14:14:72:512:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:insureds against the risk of liability resulting from the application of existing laws, liability 
6:195:14637:14:14:72:530:529:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurance also shields insureds against changes in liability rules as long as the changes concern 
6:196:14735:14:14:72:513:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:the insured categories of liability.13  Hence, for instance, physicians and other professionals 
6:197:14831:14:13:72:534:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:would likely be covered under their malpractice policies against expansions in their exposure to 
6:198:14928:13:14:72:539:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:liability for malpractice.  Nevertheless, this type of protection against changes in liability rules is 
6:199:15032:14:14:72:536:474:144:Times:144:Times:B:incomplete: it does not compensate insureds for the costs of any additional precautions that they 
6:200:15130:14:144:72:511:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:are led to take, and it does not prevent insurers from raising premiums at the time of policy

6:202:15273:8:16:108:539:308:42:Times:100:Times:F:10 I have examined Appleman (1996) and Couch (2009), major treatises on insurance law; Abraham (2010) 
6:203:15375:16:11:72:540:292:100:Times:100:Times:F:and Baker (2008), leading casebooks on insurance law and policy; and Harrington and Niehaus (2004) and Vaughan 
6:204:15486:11:12:72:525:281:100:Times:100:Times:F:and Vaughan (2008), well-known textbooks on the business and economics of insurance.  These resources cover 
6:205:15594:12:11:72:512:269:100:Times:100:Times:F:mainly the following major categories of insurance: health, disability, life, homeowners, marine, commercial, 
6:206:15704:11:12:72:472:258:100:Times:100:Times:F:automobile, fire, property, theft, and liability.  None discusses legal change as an area of coverage.  
6:207:15808:12:7:108:111:246:100:Times:100:Times:F: 
6:208:15808:7:16:108:479:239:42:Times:100:Times:F:11 These individuals include David Bassi of Plymouth Rock Assurance Company and Micah 
6:209:15894:16:11:72:535:223:100:Times:100:Times:F:Woolstenhulme of Guy Carpenter & Company, Kenneth Abraham and Tom Baker, legal academics whose focus is 
6:210:15998:11:12:72:525:212:100:Times:100:Times:F:on insurance law, and Patricia Danzon and Scott Harrington, academic economists whose primary research is on 
6:211:16107:12:11:72:539:200:100:Times:100:Times:F:insurance.  (They also agree with the essence of the qualification that I make below about the coverage against legal 
6:212:16225:11:12:72:294:189:100:Times:100:Times:F:change that is bound up in liability insurance policies.) 
6:213:16283:12:7:108:111:177:100:Times:100:Times:F: 
6:214:16283:7:16:108:530:170:42:Times:100:Times:F:12 To my knowledge, no insurance exists against a long term ban on fishing.  It might be asked, however, 
6:215:16388:16:11:72:539:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:whether business interruption insurance coverage would compensate fishermen against a temporary ban, such as for 
6:216:16501:11:12:72:514:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:a period after an oil spill due to the risk of contamination.  The answer appears to be negative, mainly because 
6:217:16614:12:11:72:533:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:business interruption coverage ordinarily requires that a loss be associated with property owned by the insured and 
6:218:16730:11:12:72:524:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:that this property have actually sustained physical damage.  See, for example, Abraham (2010, pp. 226-232) and 
6:219:16841:12:11:72:201:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:Baker (2008, pp. 41, 314-321).  
6:220:16873:11:7:108:111:97:100:Times:100:Times:F: 
6:221:16873:7:0:108:546:90:42:Times:100:Times:F:13 Baker (2004) makes this point in a broad discussion of the risks of change that liability insurance covers.    
7:222:16989:0:13:72:492:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:renewal,14 from excluding new liability risks at that time,15 or from canceling coverage 
7:223:17078:13:14:72:137:695:144:Times:144:Times:B:altogether.16  
7:224:17093:14:14:108:542:681:144:Times:144:Times:A:There also exist scattered explicit exceptions to the absence of insurance coverage against 
7:225:17185:14:14:72:471:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:legal change, such as coverage against expropriation of corporate assets by foreign 
7:226:17269:14:14:72:514:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:governments17 and individually-negotiated coverage against specific changes in tax laws.18  
7:227:17361:14:13:107:541:639:144:Times:144:Times:A:Another proviso concerning the unavailability of insurance coverage against legal change 
7:228:17450:13:14:71:503:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:is that parties can sometimes hedge against it through the use of market transactions.  For 
7:229:17542:14:14:71:540:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:instance, homeowners facing the risk of elimination of the mortgage interest tax deduction might 
7:230:17639:14:14:71:498:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:consider selling short shares in home building companies, for these companies would be 
7:231:17726:14:14:71:523:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:expected to suffer from a fall in demand for new homes if the deduction was disallowed.  Yet 
7:232:17819:14:13:71:540:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:such hedging opportunities may not be practical,19 or limited,20 and, in any case, require a degree 
7:233:17919:13:14:72:316:557:144:Times:144:Times:B:of sophistication that many parties do not possess. 
7:234:17971:14:14:72:75:543:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
7:235:17971:14:14:72:310:529:144:Times:144:Times:B:2.2  The explanation for the absence of insurance 
7:236:18021:14:14:108:523:515:144:Times:144:Times:A:Subject to the qualifications discussed above, parties are unable to insure against legal 
7:237:18111:14:13:72:534:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:change.  What is the explanation for this fact?  Are there distinctive aspects of legal change that 
7:238:18211:13:14:72:515:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:set it apart from the broad swath of risks—from automobile accidents, to fires, to theft—for 
7:239:18304:14:14:72:274:474:144:Times:144:Times:B:which insurance coverage is widely sold? 
7:240:18345:14:14:108:517:460:144:Times:144:Times:A:A salient characteristic of legal change is that it tends to affect many parties at once.  
7:241:18436:14:14:71:523:446:144:Times:144:Times:B:Thus, as I observed, if a restriction on fishing were imposed, all fishermen subject to it would 
7:242:18533:14:13:71:517:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:suffer concurrent losses of income, and similarly if the mortgage interest tax deduction were 
7:243:18627:13:14:71:525:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:eliminated or if a requirement that gasoline service stations install new gasoline holding tanks 
7:244:18724:14:14:71:469:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:were adopted, all individuals with mortgages and all service station owners would 
7:245:18806:14:29:71:221:391:144:Times:144:Times:B:simultaneously sustain losses.

7:247:18887:8:16:108:542:354:42:Times:100:Times:F:14 See, for example, Priest (1987), finding that insurers raised liability insurance premiums dramatically due 
7:248:18998:16:11:71:535:338:100:Times:100:Times:F:to the expansion of tort liability, Viscusi (1991, pp. 176-177), stating that insurers raised product liability insurance 
7:249:19120:11:12:71:533:327:100:Times:100:Times:F:premiums due to heightened product liability exposure, and Abraham (1977, pp. 489-491), suggesting that insurers

7:264:20062:16:11:72:193:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:new gasoline holding tanks?   
7:265:20092:11:7:108:111:143:100:Times:100:Times:F: 
7:266:20092:7:16:108:532:136:42:Times:100:Times:F:20 The ability to sell short shares in home building companies seems circumscribed because the aggregate 
7:267:20197:16:12:72:515:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:capitalization of these companies is probably only a fraction of the total risk facing owners of mortgages from 
7:268:20309:12:11:72:541:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:elimination of the deduction, because there are costs of selling short, and because selling short requires an individual 
7:269:20430:11:12:72:537:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:to have a brokerage account with short-selling privileges.  Moreover, selling short involves its own risks—the price 
7:270:20547:12:0:72:271:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:of shares in home building companies could rise. 
8:271:20598:0:13:108:534:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:It follows that if an insurer were to sell coverage against legal change, the insurer would 
8:272:20690:13:14:72:521:695:144:Times:144:Times:B:tend to bear a substantial risk and would need to hold large reserves.  Suppose that an insurer 
8:273:20786:14:14:71:511:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:writes $1 billion of coverage against the risk of a change in the law.  Then the insurer must 
8:274:20880:14:14:71:539:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:maintain reserves fully equal to $1 billion in order to honor its contracts with policyholders—for 
8:275:20979:14:14:71:542:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:regardless of how low the probability of claims is, such as only 1%, the triggering of its coverage 
8:276:21079:14:13:71:539:639:144:Times:144:Times:B:responsibilities would occur simultaneously for its insureds.21  In contrast, if an insurer writes $1 
8:277:21181:13:14:71:540:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:billion worth of coverage against, say, car theft involving a 1% risk of a $25,000 loss per car that 
8:278:21282:14:14:71:537:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:is independent across car owners, the insurer could maintain reserves of only $12 million and be 
8:279:21379:14:14:71:319:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:able to fulfill its contracts with virtual certainty.22   
8:280:21437:14:14:107:534:584:144:Times:144:Times:A:Such a pronounced difference in required reserves illustrates why positive correlation of 
8:281:21527:14:13:71:514:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:losses is a stock reason given in the insurance literature for the nonexistence of coverage.23  
8:282:21623:13:14:71:525:557:144:Times:144:Times:B:Holding large reserves, like $1 billion, is much more expensive than holding modest reserves, 
8:283:21717:14:14:71:538:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:like $12 million, and thus could dramatically increase insurance premiums.24  Moreover, the risk 
8:284:21814:14:14:72:513:529:144:Times:144:Times:B:of losing large reserves could further raise premiums if insurers are considered risk averse.  
8:285:21909:14:14:72:517:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:Hence, the premiums that insurers would be likely to charge for provision of coverage when 
8:286:22000:14:13:72:408:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:losses are correlated could well exceed insureds’ willingness to pay.   
8:287:22072:13:14:108:537:488:144:Times:144:Times:A:Correlation of losses therefore seems to provide a plausible candidate explanation for the 
8:288:22163:14:14:72:412:474:144:Times:144:Times:B:general absence of insurance coverage against changes in legal rules.   
8:289:22235:14:14:108:528:460:144:Times:144:Times:A:It should also be noted that the correlation-of-losses hypothesis is reconcilable with the 
8:290:22326:14:14:72:531:446:144:Times:144:Times:B:fact that liability insurance policies furnish implicit coverage against changes in liability rules.  
8:291:22428:14:13:72:527:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:In particular, a change in a liability rule does not lead to simultaneous losses for the holders of 
8:292:22528:13:14:72:524:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:liability insurance coverage.  When a liability rule changes, typically only a small minority of 
8:293:22625:14:14:72:534:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:insureds will make claims as a consequence, for only those insureds who turn out to cause harm 
8:294:22720:14:14:72:526:391:144:Times:144:Times:B:and are found liable as a result of the modification of the liability rule would add to the claims 
8:295:22819:14:15:72:179:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:the insurer must pay.  
8:296:22842:15:8:108:255:362:144:Times:144:Times:A:                                                 
8:297:22891:8:16:108:507:354:42:Times:100:Times:F:21 An insurer might choose to hold reserves of $1 billion in order to prevent bankruptcy and to give 
8:298:22992:16:11:72:540:338:100:Times:100:Times:F:insureds confidence in their insurance.  Another possibility is that an insurer would be forced to hold the reserves by 
8:299:23112:11:12:72:530:327:100:Times:100:Times:F:an insurance regulator.  A different possibility is that an insurer would purchase reinsurance to cover its $1 billion 
8:300:23231:12:11:72:531:315:100:Times:100:Times:F:risk.  In that case, though, the reinsurers might need to hold reserves of $1 billion in order to be able to honor their 
8:301:23352:11:12:72:108:304:100:Times:100:Times:F:policies. 
8:302:23362:12:7:108:113:292:100:Times:100:Times:F:  
8:303:23364:7:16:108:536:285:42:Times:100:Times:F:22 Since the assumption is that the insurer writes $1 billion of coverage and each individual’s loss from car 
8:304:23474:16:11:71:534:269:100:Times:100:Times:F:theft would be $25,000, the insurer must be covering 40,000 individuals.  The standard deviation of an individual’s 
8:305:23590:11:12:71:535:258:100:Times:100:Times:F:loss if not insured is $2,487 (namely, [.01($25,000 – $250)2 + .99(–$250)2]1/2), implying that the standard deviation 
8:306:23708:12:11:72:541:246:100:Times:100:Times:F:of the average loss among the 40,000 insured individuals is only $2,487/(40,000)1/2 = $12.44.  Now if the insurer has 
8:307:23826:11:12:71:525:235:100:Times:100:Times:F:$12 million in reserves, it will have reserves of $300 per individual.  Hence, for the reserves to be exhausted, the 
8:308:23943:12:11:71:533:223:100:Times:100:Times:F:average loss must exceed $300.  Since the mean loss per individual is $250, the average loss would have to exceed 
8:309:24057:11:12:71:507:212:100:Times:100:Times:F:the mean by at least $50 for reserves to be depleted.  But $50/$12.44 is 4.02, which is to say, more than four 
8:310:24168:12:11:71:478:200:100:Times:100:Times:F:standard deviations.  The odds of such an event are less than one in 10,000 for a normal distribution.  
8:311:24272:11:7:107:110:189:100:Times:100:Times:F: 
8:312:24272:7:16:108:519:182:42:Times:100:Times:F:23 See, for example, Harrington and Niehaus (2004, p. 182) and Vaughan and Vaughan (2008, p. 43).   
8:313:24372:16:7:107:112:166:100:Times:100:Times:F:  
8:314:24374:7:16:108:535:159:42:Times:100:Times:F:24 Suppose that the financing cost of maintaining liquid reserves is 4% a year.  Then to hold reserves of $1 
8:315:24483:16:12:72:540:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:billion would cost an insurer $40 million a year.  This implies that, if the insurer is risk-neutral, its premium revenue 
8:316:24605:12:11:72:539:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:must be five times its expected losses of $10 million a year, because its premium revenue must support its financing 
8:317:24722:11:12:72:507:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:cost and its expected losses.  Such a high ratio of premiums to expected losses could discourage purchase of 
8:318:24831:12:11:72:529:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:insurance coverage, that is, eliminate the market for coverage.   In contrast, for an insurer to hold reserves of only 
8:319:24950:11:12:72:537:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:$12 million would cost only $480,000.  This implies that, if the insurer is risk-neutral, its premium revenue must be 
8:320:25068:12:0:72:432:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:only $12.48 million, which is only1.248 times the expected losses of $10 million a year.   
9:321:25161:0:13:108:484:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:However, correlation of losses needs to be supplemented with other factors to 
9:322:25239:13:14:72:533:695:144:Times:144:Times:B:satisfactorily explain the observed absence of insurance coverage against legal change.  Among 
9:323:25334:14:14:72:530:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:the reasons are that many risks of legal change affect relatively small numbers of parties,25 that 
9:324:25433:14:14:71:517:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:legal risks can be set off against each other,26 and that legal risks are often uncorrelated with 
9:325:25531:14:14:71:521:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:other categories of risk, including natural disasters and macroeconomic events.  These points 
9:326:25625:14:13:71:527:639:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggest that reinsurers and the capital markets could find risk-sharing with insureds and/or the 
9:327:25722:13:14:71:509:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurance industry attractive and thus qualify the significance of correlation of losses as an 
9:328:25817:14:14:71:383:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:explanation for the absence of coverage against legal change.27   
9:329:25883:14:14:108:533:598:144:Times:144:Times:A:Finally, let me consider several possible explanations for the unavailability of insurance 
9:330:25974:14:14:72:500:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:that are different from correlation of losses.  One standard reason for the nonexistence of 
9:331:26066:14:13:72:509:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurance is adverse selection.  Namely, when an insurer sells a type of coverage, say theft 
9:332:26159:13:14:72:536:557:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurance, high-risk individuals will be more likely to buy it than low-risk individuals, implying 
9:333:26258:14:14:71:528:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:that the price of coverage (which must reflect the average risk experienced by the insurer) will 
9:334:26355:14:14:71:508:529:144:Times:144:Times:B:become relatively unattractive for low-risk individuals and could lead some of them not to 
9:335:26446:14:14:71:525:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:continue to buy coverage.  This could engender an unraveling process in which more low-risk 
9:336:26538:14:13:71:495:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:individuals among the remaining insureds decide not to continue to buy theft insurance, 
9:337:26626:13:14:71:508:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:ultimately vitiating the market for that coverage.  Crucially, for adverse selection to occur, 
9:338:26721:14:14:71:513:474:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurers must be unable to identify who are high-risk individuals, for otherwise the insurers 
9:339:26815:14:14:71:368:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:could and would charge them appropriately high premiums.   
9:340:26874:14:14:107:530:446:144:Times:144:Times:A:The phenomenon of adverse selection appears to be of little importance in our context.  
9:341:26962:14:13:71:513:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:On one hand, adverse selection could not possibly occur if insurance were offered against a 
9:342:27054:13:14:71:541:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:specific change in the law (such as a ban on the use of the cod fishery off the coast of Maine), for 
9:343:27155:14:14:71:526:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:then the risk would by definition be the same for all policy holders (namely, the probability of 
9:344:27252:14:14:71:526:391:144:Times:144:Times:B:the named ban on the cod fishery)—in other words, there could not be any high-risk buyers of 
9:345:27345:14:14:71:523:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:the coverage.  On the other hand, adverse selection would be a logical possibility if insurance 
9:346:27441:14:13:71:540:363:144:Times:144:Times:B:were offered against a category of changes in the law (such as any kind of restriction on any type 
9:347:27540:13:14:71:504:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:of fishing on the East Coast), for then there could be high-risk buyers of coverage, that is, 
9:348:27634:14:14:71:527:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:individuals who know that a particular legal change within the covered category is likely.  But 
9:349:27730:14:14:71:535:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:such adverse selection seems implausible, because it could occur only if a significant number of 
9:350:27827:14:13:71:478:308:144:Times:144:Times:B:individuals know more about the likelihood of a change in the law than do insurers.  
9:351:27912:13:14:107:539:295:144:Times:144:Times:A:A second standard reason for the nonexistence of insurance is moral hazard, which arises 
9:352:28001:14:14:71:524:281:144:Times:144:Times:B:when a person who purchases insurance behaves in such a way as to increase the risk of loss.  
9:353:28095:14:14:71:532:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:This would result in an elevated premium rate and could discourage the purchase of insurance.  
9:354:28190:14:14:71:540:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:If, for example, a person purchases insurance against loss of his cellphone, he would probably be 
9:355:28288:14:15:72:537:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:less careful with it than otherwise; he might lose his cellphone with a fairly high probability, say 
9:356:28389:15:8:107:254:224:144:Times:144:Times:A:                                                 
9:357:28438:8:16:108:528:216:42:Times:100:Times:F:25 Consider, for instance, a change in the tax laws that would apply to only a small subset of farmers or a 
9:358:28546:16:11:71:432:200:100:Times:100:Times:F:change in a municipality’s fire code that would pertain only to local fast food restaurants. 
9:359:28639:11:7:107:110:189:100:Times:100:Times:F: 
9:360:28639:7:16:108:360:182:42:Times:100:Times:F:26 Consider the two legal risks mentioned in the previous note. 
9:361:28703:16:7:107:110:166:100:Times:100:Times:F: 
9:362:28703:7:16:108:510:159:42:Times:100:Times:F:27 A number of economists have asked me whether the observations of this paragraph imply that the 
9:363:28801:16:12:72:524:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:correlation problem of insurers should be largely overcome, not merely qualified.  But important evidence to the 
9:364:28914:12:11:72:526:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:contrary is the paucity of insurance coverage against (and high premiums charged for) catastrophic risks, such as 
9:365:29028:11:12:72:513:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes—even though these correlated risks should in theory also be substantially 
9:366:29138:12:11:72:508:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:alleviated through reinsurance and the participation of the capital markets.  On the puzzle represented by the 
9:367:29249:11:12:72:524:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:shortage of coverage against catastrophic risks and possible explanations for it, see especially Froot (2001), who 
9:368:29364:12:0:72:354:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:emphasizes in part 5 various problems with the supply of reinsurance. 
10:369:29438:0:13:72:540:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:50 percent, over the course of a year, rather than with only a low probability, say 5 percent, if his 
10:370:29540:13:14:72:515:695:144:Times:144:Times:B:cellphone is not insured.  Hence, the person might well prefer not to be insured and bear a 5 
10:371:29634:14:14:72:523:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:percent risk of loss of his cellphone instead of paying an annual premium of 50 percent of the

10:373:29755:14:14:108:531:653:144:Times:144:Times:A:Blume and Rubinfeld (1984, pp. 593-597) suggest that moral hazard could explain why 
10:374:29839:14:13:72:528:639:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurance against takings does not exist.  Their thought is that, if a person were to own takings 
10:375:29937:13:14:72:537:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurance, he would be less likely to resist a taking (such as at a hearing before a zoning board).  
10:376:30038:14:14:72:337:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:Their view seems sensible in the context of takings.28   
10:377:30095:14:14:108:518:598:144:Times:144:Times:A:But the moral hazard argument does not appear to extend from takings to the general 
10:378:30179:14:14:72:523:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:setting of changes in the law.  For instance, would a single fisherman’s purchase of insurance 
10:379:30274:14:13:71:540:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:against a ban on the use of a fishery be likely to measurably affect the probability of such a ban?  
10:380:30375:13:14:72:506:557:144:Times:144:Times:B:I assume that the answer is no—because impeding a ban would ordinarily be a substantial 
10:381:30463:14:14:72:540:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:undertaking and require the assent of many.29  Hence, moral hazard should not usually operate to 
10:382:30560:14:14:71:521:529:144:Times:144:Times:B:reduce an individual fisherman’s motive to buy insurance coverage against a ban.  This point 
10:383:30653:14:14:71:522:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:must be distinguished from a different one: If a mass of fishermen were to purchase coverage 
10:384:30746:14:13:71:518:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:against a ban on the use of a fishery, then the probability of a ban could well rise, since their 
10:385:30844:13:14:71:516:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:collective incentive to resist a ban would be dulled.  That phenomenon, however, would not 
10:386:30935:14:14:71:518:474:144:Times:144:Times:B:necessarily depress the demand for insurance coverage—it could easily raise the demand for 
10:387:31026:14:14:71:497:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:coverage—and thus would not constitute a clear reason for coverage not to be offered.30 
10:388:31113:14:14:108:537:446:144:Times:144:Times:A:An additional reason for the nonexistence of insurance against legal change is offered by 
10:389:31203:14:13:72:539:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:Masur and Nash (2010, pp. 421-426), namely, that it would be difficult for insurers to price such 
10:390:31301:13:14:72:520:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:coverage because of uncertainty surrounding the probability of legal change.  However, their 
10:391:31394:14:14:72:519:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:hypothesis does not seem consistent with the theory of insurance or with insurance practice.  
10:392:31488:14:14:72:528:391:144:Times:144:Times:B:With regard to theory, an insurer should in principle be indifferent between pricing and selling 
10:393:31585:14:14:72:535:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:coverage against a change in the law that will occur with a probability of 50 percent and pricing 
10:394:31683:14:13:72:525:363:144:Times:144:Times:B:and selling coverage against a change in the law that will occur either with a probability of 25 
10:395:31780:13:14:72:516:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:percent or with a probability 75 percent, each with equal likelihood.31  (This is not to deny a 
10:396:31876:14:20:72:536:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:different point—that an insurer would decidedly prefer to sell coverage against independent and 
10:397:31972:20:8:108:255:316:144:Times:144:Times:A:                                                 
10:398:32021:8:16:108:541:308:42:Times:100:Times:F:28 Still, other reasons for the absence of takings insurance coverage are also plausible.  Notably, the demand 
10:399:32132:16:11:71:515:292:100:Times:100:Times:F:for coverage may be low because the government often pays compensation for takings (supposedly always for 
10:400:32238:11:12:71:348:281:100:Times:100:Times:F:physical takings of property, and sometimes for regulatory takings).  
10:401:32308:12:7:107:112:269:100:Times:100:Times:F:  
10:402:32310:7:16:108:510:262:42:Times:100:Times:F:29 In contrast, a single individual faces a much less daunting task if he is seeking only to prevent the 
10:403:32415:16:11:71:305:246:100:Times:100:Times:F:application of takings law to his particular parcel of land.  
10:404:32477:11:7:107:112:235:100:Times:100:Times:F:  
10:405:32479:7:16:108:519:228:42:Times:100:Times:F:30 After a mass of fishermen buy coverage and the probability of a ban rises, the demand for insurance 
10:406:32582:16:12:72:537:212:100:Times:100:Times:F:coverage could either increase or decline.  In particular, it is well known that the demand for insurance is a function 
10:407:32702:12:11:72:534:200:100:Times:100:Times:F:of the probability p of loss, rising from zero when p is 0 to a maximum at some probability p* less than 1, and then 
10:408:32819:11:12:72:540:189:100:Times:100:Times:F:falling to zero when p is 1.  (In particular, if x > 0 is the possible loss, U a person’s utility function, and y his wealth, 
10:409:32945:12:11:72:537:177:100:Times:100:Times:F:then the expected utility value of insurance coverage (which reflects the strength of demand for coverage), if sold at 
10:410:33064:11:12:72:526:166:100:Times:100:Times:F:actuarially fair rates, is given by U(y – px) – [(1 – p)U(y) + pU(y – x)].  This function equals 0 at p = 0 and p = 1, 
10:411:33183:12:11:72:533:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:achieves a maximum at p* determined by U(y) – U(y – x) = xU′(y – px), and is concave.)  Thus, for example, if the 
10:412:33297:11:12:72:523:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:probability of a ban is less than p* before insurance is sold and increases to a probability that is still less than p* 
10:413:33417:12:11:72:520:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:after insurance is sold, the demand for insurance will increase; and if the probability of a ban exceeds p* before 
10:414:33532:11:12:71:420:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:insurance is sold, then after insurance is sold the demand for insurance will decrease.   
10:415:33622:12:7:107:110:108:100:Times:100:Times:F: 
10:416:33622:7:16:108:532:101:42:Times:100:Times:F:31 In both cases, the insurer would face a 50 percent risk of a change in the law, and thus a 50 percent risk 
10:417:33732:16:0:71:315:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:that all insureds would simultaneously make claims for loss. 
11:418:33797:0:13:72:542:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:identical risks of known magnitude, such as 50 percent, than to sell coverage against independent 
11:419:33895:13:14:72:501:695:144:Times:144:Times:B:and identical risks of unknown magnitude.32)  With regard to insurance practice, insurers 
11:420:33985:14:14:71:501:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:routinely sell negotiated policies against a wide range of risks that would be described as 
11:421:34077:14:14:71:526:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:subjective (such as the risk of the destruction of the World Trade Center or the risk of harm to 
11:422:34174:14:14:71:538:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:actress Betty Grable’s legs).  Moreover, if the subjective nature of the risks of legal change were 
11:423:34274:14:13:71:525:639:144:Times:144:Times:B:a bar to its sale by insurers, why would liability insurers sell coverage that includes protection 
11:424:34373:13:14:71:177:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:against legal change? 
11:425:34395:14:14:107:535:612:144:Times:144:Times:A:To summarize and conclude the discussion, we have seen in Section 2.1 that, as a matter 
11:426:34483:14:14:71:531:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:of observation, insurance coverage against legal change is mainly unavailable.  It has also been 
11:427:34580:14:14:71:512:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:suggested in Section 2.2 that the correlation of losses due to legal change provides a partial 
11:428:34675:14:13:71:519:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:explanation for the absence of coverage and that several major alternative explanations for it 
11:429:34770:13:14:71:518:557:144:Times:144:Times:B:seem problematic.  Nevertheless, the correlation hypothesis is not entirely satisfying.  In any 
11:430:34866:14:14:71:528:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:case, given that insurance against legal change is largely unavailable in reality, I will make the 
11:431:34965:14:14:72:531:529:144:Times:144:Times:B:simplifying assumption in the model below that insurance against legal change does not exist.   
11:432:35061:14:14:107:110:515:144:Times:144:Times:A: 
11:433:35061:14:13:71:142:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:3.  The Model 
11:434:35075:13:14:108:518:488:144:Times:144:Times:A:Parties called injurers engage in an activity that may turn out to be harmful to parties 
11:435:35164:14:14:72:540:474:144:Times:144:Times:B:called victims.  In particular, the state will learn at a future date whether the activity of injurers is 
11:436:35270:14:14:72:540:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:potentially harmful or is instead harmless.  If the activity is determined to be potentially harmful, 
11:437:35372:14:14:72:525:446:144:Times:144:Times:B:the state will announce a legal rule to address the danger.  Thus, the risk of legal change is the 
11:438:35471:14:13:72:536:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:risk that the state discovers that the activity is potentially harmful and as a consequence enacts a 
11:439:35572:13:14:72:526:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:legal rule to control the danger.  After the announcement of the rule, injurers choose a level of 
11:440:35670:14:14:72:512:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:care to reduce the probability of harm.33  Injurers are identical to each other, as are victims. 
11:441:35767:14:14:108:204:391:144:Times:144:Times:A:Specifically, define 
11:442:35788:14:14:108:553:377:144:Times:144:Times:A:q = probability that the state learns that the activity is harmful and announces a legal rule;     
11:443:35887:14:13:126:175:363:144:Times:144:Times:A:0 < q < 1; 
11:444:35898:13:14:107:515:350:144:Times:144:Times:A:x = expenditure on care by an injurer to reduce the probability of an accident if the    
11:445:35987:14:14:126:250:336:144:Times:144:Times:A:activity is harmful; x ≥ 0; 
11:446:36014:14:14:107:525:322:144:Times:144:Times:A:        p(x) = probability of an accident if the activity is harmful; 0 < p(x) < 1; p′(x) < 0;  
11:447:36110:14:13:107:198:308:144:Times:144:Times:A:      p′′(x) > 0; and  
11:448:36133:13:14:107:329:295:144:Times:144:Times:A:            h  = harm if an accident occurs; h > 0. 
11:449:36185:14:23:107:411:281:144:Times:144:Times:A:If the activity is harmful, the sum of care and expected harm is 
11:450:36250:23:7:107:254:258:144:Times:144:Times:A:                                                 
11:451:36299:7:16:108:534:251:42:Times:100:Times:F:32 To illustrate, suppose that an insurer sells coverage against many identical, independent risks of 50% of 
11:452:36408:16:12:72:534:235:100:Times:100:Times:F:loss of $100 each.  Then, by the law of large numbers, if the insurer charges a premium of slightly over $50, it will 
11:453:36526:12:11:72:509:223:100:Times:100:Times:F:be virtually certain to cover the claims it will have to pay (see also note 22).  Now suppose that the insurer is 
11:454:36640:11:12:72:519:212:100:Times:100:Times:F:uncertain about the common risk of loss—that it is either 25% or 75%, each with equal probability.  Then even 
11:455:36750:12:11:72:532:200:100:Times:100:Times:F:though 50% is the expected risk, it would be folly for the insurer to charge a premium in the neighborhood of $50, 
11:456:36865:11:12:72:531:189:100:Times:100:Times:F:for then if the common risk turns out to be 75%, the insurer would go bankrupt.  In fact, the insurer would have to 
11:457:36981:12:11:72:537:177:100:Times:100:Times:F:charge a premium slightly above $75 to avoid a 50% chance of bankruptcy.  One way to express these points is that 
11:458:37095:11:12:72:516:166:100:Times:100:Times:F:in the classic context of insurance, where the insured risks are independent and identical, uncertainty about the 
11:459:37209:12:11:72:536:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:common risk generates a species of correlation problem.  See, for example, Harrington and Niehaus (2004, p. 182). 
11:460:37323:11:7:108:111:143:100:Times:100:Times:F: 
11:461:37323:7:16:108:522:136:42:Times:100:Times:F:33 Although this model captures in a stylized way the basic elements of many legal changes, it does not 
11:462:37427:16:12:72:501:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:directly describe all examples of legal change, such as the possible elimination of the mortgage interest tax 
11:463:37537:12:11:72:533:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:deduction.  But some such examples can be accommodated with minor modifications of the model (see note 47 on 
11:464:37646:11:12:72:536:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:the mortgage interest tax deduction), and in any case, it does not seem that the main qualitative conclusion depends 
11:465:37763:12:0:72:318:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:on the particulars of the model (as is suggested by note 41).   
12:466:37830:0:13:72:151:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:(1)     x + p(x)h. 
12:467:37849:13:14:72:529:695:144:Times:144:Times:B:Let the x that minimizes (1) be denoted x*; and call x* the conventionally optimal level of care 
12:468:37946:14:14:72:529:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:because in models with risk-neutral actors, it is usually assumed that minimization of (1) is the 
12:469:38044:14:14:72:536:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:social objective.34  Since the case in which x* is zero is uninteresting, it will be supposed that x* 
12:470:38146:14:14:72:229:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:is positive, or equivalently, that  
12:471:38182:14:13:72:157:639:144:Times:144:Times:B:(2)     p′(x)h = –1 
12:472:38202:13:14:71:528:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:holds for a positive x.  Note that since p′′(x) > 0 for x ≥ 0, condition (2) holds for a positive x if 
12:473:38304:14:14:72:130:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:and only if  
12:474:38317:14:14:72:160:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:(3)     p′(0)h < –1, 
12:475:38338:14:14:72:264:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:so that this inequality will be assumed.  
12:476:38380:14:13:108:130:570:144:Times:144:Times:A:Let  
12:477:38385:13:14:108:305:557:144:Times:144:Times:A:U(·) = utility of wealth of an injurer, and 
12:478:38429:14:14:108:276:543:144:Times:100:Times:A:     u = initial wealth of an injurer.  
12:479:38468:14:14:72:529:529:144:Times:144:Times:B:Injurers are assumed to be risk averse or risk neutral, but the case in which they are risk averse 
12:480:38567:14:14:72:529:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:will be emphasized because the risk aversion of those subject to the law is the main concern of 
12:481:38663:14:13:72:540:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:this article.  When injurers are assumed to be risk neutral, the utility of an injurer will be taken to 
12:482:38767:13:14:72:226:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:equal the amount of his wealth. 
12:483:38799:14:14:108:537:474:144:Times:144:Times:A:It is assumed that injurers cannot purchase insurance against legal change for the reasons 
12:484:38890:14:14:72:483:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:given in Section 2.  The meaning of this assumption will be discussed further below.  
12:485:38976:14:14:108:155:446:144:Times:144:Times:A:Also, let  
12:486:38987:14:13:108:297:432:144:Times:144:Times:A:V(·) = utility of wealth of a victim, and 
12:487:39029:13:14:108:259:419:144:Times:144:Times:A: v = initial wealth of a victim.   
12:488:39063:14:14:72:515:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:Both the case in which victims are risk neutral (with the utility function of a victim taken to 
12:489:39159:14:14:72:538:391:144:Times:144:Times:B:equal the amount of his wealth) and the case in which they are risk averse will be analyzed.  The 
12:490:39257:14:14:72:531:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:case of risk-neutral victims is considered both because it is expositionally simpler (the effect of 
12:491:39357:14:13:72:514:363:144:Times:144:Times:B:injurer risk aversion on optimal legal change is most easily understood in isolation from the 
12:492:39451:13:14:72:523:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:possible risk aversion of victims) and because it is sometimes descriptive of reality (when the 
12:493:39547:14:14:72:531:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:harm to each victim is limited or, often, when the government bears the harm).  The qualitative 
12:494:39643:14:14:72:489:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:nature of most of the results does not change, however, when victims are risk averse.   
12:495:39731:14:13:72:541:308:144:Times:144:Times:B:Assumptions about victims’ ability to insure in the case in which they are risk averse will also be 
12:496:39831:13:14:72:156:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:discussed below. 
12:497:39848:14:14:108:540:281:144:Times:144:Times:A:We will determine Pareto optimal legal rules.35  A rule is defined to be Pareto optimal for 
12:498:39939:14:14:72:510:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:the parties given an initial situation if there does not exist an alternative rule, and a transfer 
12:499:40038:14:14:72:515:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:payment between injurers and victims, under which the expected utility of both injurers and 
12:500:40130:14:13:72:534:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:victims would be higher.  To identify Pareto optimal legal rules, it is necessary and sufficient to 
12:501:40230:13:37:72:214:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:solve the following problem: 
12:502:40259:37:7:108:255:189:144:Times:144:Times:A:                                                 
12:503:40308:7:16:108:380:182:42:Times:100:Times:F:34 See, for example, Landes and Posner (1987) and Shavell (1987).  
12:504:40375:16:7:107:110:166:100:Times:100:Times:F: 
12:505:40375:7:16:108:525:159:42:Times:100:Times:F:35 It does not make sense to treat minimization of x + p(x)h as the optimality criterion, for that objective 
12:506:40484:16:12:71:532:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:does not reflect risk-bearing by risk-averse parties.  (As will be observed, however, the problem of maximizing (4) 
12:507:40600:12:11:71:537:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:subject to (5) reduces to minimization of x + p(x)h when both injurers and victims are risk neutral.)  It also does not 
12:508:40720:11:12:71:514:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:make sense to employ the sum of expected utilities as the optimality criterion, for although that goal would be 
12:509:40832:12:11:71:516:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:promoted by bettering the allocation of risk, it would also be furthered by redistribution from wealthy to poor.  
12:510:40946:11:12:71:523:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:(Hence, if some policy advances the sum of expected utilities, the explanation could be that the policy favorably 
12:511:41060:12:0:71:359:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:redistributes wealth rather than that it improves the allocation of risk.)

13:514:41235:14:14:108:246:681:144:Times:144:Times:A:subject to the constraint that 
13:515:41266:14:14:72:511:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:(5)     the expected utility of victims EV is held constant by means of a transfer payment by 
13:516:41360:14:14:99:192:653:144:Times:144:Times:A:injurers to victims, 
13:517:41381:14:13:72:107:639:144:Times:144:Times:B:where  
13:518:41388:13:14:108:317:626:144:Times:144:Times:A:t = transfer payment by injurers to victims. 
13:519:41433:14:14:72:534:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:It is assumed that t is made before the state learns whether the activity is harmful, that is, before 
13:520:41535:14:14:72:219:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:legal uncertainty is resolved.   
13:521:41568:14:14:108:531:584:144:Times:144:Times:A:I now consider Pareto optimal legal rules when the rules concern regulation of behavior 
13:522:41656:14:13:72:317:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:and then when they concern payments for harm.36  
13:523:41705:13:14:107:110:557:144:Times:144:Times:A: 
13:524:41705:14:14:71:203:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:3.1 Regulation of behavior 
13:525:41732:14:14:108:541:529:144:Times:144:Times:A:Assume here that if the state learns that injurers’ activity is harmful, the legal rule that the 
13:526:41829:14:14:72:529:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:state adopts is regulation, by which is meant a standard of care that injurers must exercise.  Let 
13:527:41928:14:13:108:498:501:144:Times:144:Times:A: xs = required standard of care if the state learns that injurers’ activity is harmful. 
13:528:42015:13:14:72:489:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:It will be assumed that injurers meet the standard xs, for consideration of its method of 
13:529:42105:14:14:72:513:474:144:Times:144:Times:B:enforcement by the state (through public enforcement or private, under the negligence rule) 
13:530:42197:14:14:72:258:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:would be distracting for our purposes. 
13:531:42236:14:14:108:507:446:144:Times:144:Times:A:Consider first the determination of a Pareto optimal standard of care assuming that 
13:532:42320:14:13:71:390:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:victims are risk neutral.   The expected utility of an injurer is then 
13:533:42391:13:14:71:277:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:(6)   EU = (1 – q)U(u – t) + qU(u – t – xs). 
13:534:42436:14:14:72:527:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:Note that this expression reflects the assumption that the transfer payment t is made before the 
13:535:42533:14:14:72:537:391:144:Times:144:Times:B:state learns whether the activity is harmful, that the risk borne by an injurer is having to spend xs 
13:536:42634:14:14:72:538:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:to meet the standard, and that injurers do not have insurance coverage against the risk of xs.  The 
13:537:42734:14:13:71:371:363:144:Times:144:Times:B:expected wealth of a victim is v + t – qp(xs)h and must satisfy 
13:538:42798:13:14:72:187:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:(7)   v + t – qp(xs)h = r, 
13:539:42825:14:14:72:526:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:where r is a reference level of expected wealth.  The Pareto optimal standard xs maximizes (6) 
13:540:42920:14:14:72:247:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:subject to (7).37  From (7), we have  
13:541:42958:14:13:72:204:308:144:Times:144:Times:B:(8)       t = r – v + qp(xs)h,  
13:542:42990:13:14:72:318:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:so that the problem at issue reduces to maximizing 
13:543:43041:14:14:72:433:281:144:Times:144:Times:B:(9)      EU(xs) = (1 – q)U(u – r + v – qp(xs)h) + qU(u – r + v – qp(xs)h – xs) 
13:544:43120:14:14:71:436:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:over xs.  Denote the Pareto optimal standard xs that maximizes (9) by xs*.38  
13:545:43198:14:14:108:540:253:144:Times:144:Times:A:Before determining the Pareto optimal standard when injurers are risk averse, let me note 
13:546:43288:14:13:72:390:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:what the Pareto optimal standard is when injurers are risk neutral. 
13:547:43356:13:14:108:111:226:144:Times:144:Times:A: 
13:548:43356:14:14:108:508:212:144:Times:144:Times:A:Remark 1.  Assume that both injurers and victims are risk neutral.  Then the Pareto 
13:549:43440:14:32:72:431:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:optimal standard of care xs* is the conventionally optimal level of care x*. 
13:550:43517:32:7:108:255:166:144:Times:144:Times:A:                                                 
13:551:43566:7:16:108:527:159:42:Times:100:Times:F:36 In Shavell (1982), I consider Pareto optimal legal rules in an accident model with possibly risk-averse 
13:552:43673:16:12:72:520:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:parties, but with the crucial difference that there is no uncertainty about legal change—whether a legal rule will 
13:553:43788:12:11:72:383:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:apply.  See notes 39 and 53 below for further comments on my prior article.   
13:554:43866:11:7:108:113:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:  
13:555:43868:7:16:108:524:113:42:Times:100:Times:F:37 That is, maximization of (4) subject to (5) is maximization of (6) subject to (7) in the present context. 
13:556:43977:16:7:108:111:97:100:Times:100:Times:F: 
13:557:43977:7:0:108:364:90:42:Times:100:Times:F:38 Since EU′′(xs) < 0 will be shown in (11) below, xs* is unique. 
14:558:44046:0:13:108:541:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:The claim in this remark holds because, when injurers are risk neutral, the right-hand side 
14:559:44138:13:14:72:526:695:144:Times:144:Times:B:of (9) reduces to u – r + v – q(p(xs)h + xs), which is maximized when p(xs)h + xs is minimized 
14:560:44233:14:14:72:110:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:over xs. 
14:561:44242:14:14:108:277:667:144:Times:144:Times:A:We now have the following result. 
14:562:44276:14:14:108:111:653:144:Times:144:Times:A: 
14:563:44276:14:13:108:517:639:144:Times:144:Times:A:Proposition 1.  Assume that injurers are risk averse and that victims are risk neutral.  
14:564:44365:13:14:72:483:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:Then the Pareto optimal standard of care xs* is such that 0 < xs* < x*, where x* is the 
14:565:44453:14:14:71:516:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:conventionally optimal level of care.  The Pareto optimal standard xs* is determined by (14) 
14:566:44546:14:14:72:107:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:below. 
14:567:44553:14:14:108:111:584:144:Times:144:Times:A: 
14:568:44553:14:13:108:535:570:144:Times:144:Times:A:Notes.  (a) The explanation for why xs* is positive is as follows.  If xs were zero, injurers 
14:569:44647:13:14:72:516:557:144:Times:144:Times:B:would bear no risk—if the activity was discovered to be harmful, the state would impose no 
14:570:44738:14:14:72:538:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:standard.  But since a risk-averse party is effectively risk neutral when he begins to bear risk, we 
14:571:44839:14:14:72:539:529:144:Times:144:Times:B:infer that it would be desirable for xs to be raised slightly from zero if that would be desirable for 
14:572:44941:14:14:72:493:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:a risk-neutral injurer.  For a risk-neutral injurer, it would be desirable for xs to be raised 
14:573:45036:14:13:72:495:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:marginally from zero, since we know from Remark 1 that it would be desirable for xs to 
14:574:45123:13:14:72:512:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:minimize p(xs)h + xs that for such an injurer.  Hence, it must be desirable for xs to be raised 
14:575:45219:14:14:72:515:474:144:Times:144:Times:B:slightly from zero for a risk-averse injurer.  In other words, doing so will lower the required 
14:576:45315:14:14:72:422:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:payment t by enough to make the cost of meeting xs worthwhile for him. 
14:577:45386:14:14:107:515:446:144:Times:144:Times:A:(b) The explanation for why xs* is below x*39 flows from the observation that if xs is 
14:578:45473:14:13:72:498:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:marginally reduced from x*, then, because x* minimizes x + p(x)h, the increase in t will 
14:579:45562:13:14:71:501:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:essentially equal the expected reduction in xs.40  Thus, if the injurer were risk neutral, the 
14:580:45657:14:14:72:526:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:marginal effect of the reduction in xs on his well-being would be zero.  But since the injurer is 
14:581:45755:14:14:72:539:391:144:Times:144:Times:B:risk averse and is bearing positive risk when xs is x*, he benefits from a reduction in risk-bearing 
14:582:45856:14:14:71:459:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:from the marginal reduction in xs, implying that his expected utility must rise.41  
14:583:45940:14:13:108:111:363:144:Times:144:Times:A: 
14:584:45940:13:14:108:236:350:144:Times:144:Times:A:Proof.  First, observe that  
14:585:45969:14:14:72:497:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:(10)      EU′(xs) = –qp′(xs)h(1 – q)U′(w – qp(xs)h) – (qp′(xs)h + 1)qU′(w – qp(xs)h – xs),    
14:586:46063:14:14:108:395:322:144:Times:144:Times:A:where w denotes u – r + v for notational simplicity.  Hence 
14:587:46123:14:13:71:475:308:144:Times:144:Times:B:(11)    EU′′(xs) = –qp′′(xs)h(1 – q)U′(w – qh(xs)) +  (qp′(xs)h)2(1 – q)U′′(w – qp(xs)h) 
14:588:46212:13:14:107:557:295:144:Times:144:Times:A:                         – qp′′(xs)hqU′(w – qp(xs)h – xs) + (qp′(xs)h + 1)2qU′′(w – qp(xs)h – xs) < 0,       
14:589:46321:14:14:72:210:281:144:Times:144:Times:B:since each term is negative.  
14:590:46351:14:14:108:307:267:144:Times:144:Times:A:To show that xs* > 0, note from (10) that 
14:591:46393:14:17:72:461:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:(12)    EU′(0) = –qp′(0)h(1 – q)U′(w – qp(0)h) – (qp′(0)h + 1)qU′(w – qp(0)h)

14:593:46525:7:16:108:531:229:42:Times:100:Times:F:39 In Shavell (1982), I considered the Pareto optimal standard of care assuming, unlike here, that possibly 
14:594:46633:16:12:72:506:213:100:Times:100:Times:F:risk-averse injurers know ex ante that their activity of injurers is subject to control.  Then the Pareto optimal 
14:595:46747:12:11:72:451:201:100:Times:100:Times:F:standard equals the conventionally efficient level x*; see Proposition 3(a) in my earlier article. 
14:596:46846:11:7:107:110:190:100:Times:100:Times:F: 
14:597:46846:7:16:108:464:183:42:Times:100:Times:F:40 Since t = r – v + qp(x*)h, the marginal increase in t from a marginal reduction in xs is  
14:598:46938:16:12:107:539:167:100:Times:100:Times:F:–qp′(x*)h.  Since the expected cost of meeting the standard is qx*, the marginal reduction in expected costs 
14:599:47047:12:19:71:385:155:100:Times:100:Times:F:is q.  And since, by (2), x* satisfies p′(x*)h = –1, we know that –qp′(x*)h = q. 
14:600:47128:19:16:108:536:136:42:Times:100:Times:F:41 Note that this logic explaining the key result that xs* < x* does not depend on the fact that, in the model, 
14:601:47240:16:11:72:535:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:xs affects other parties by influencing expected harm, p(xs)h.  It is readily verified that xs* < x* would still be true if 
14:602:47364:11:12:71:535:109:100:Times:100:Times:F:xs were to affect other parties via any positive cost function f(xs) that is decreasing in xs, in which case (7) would be 
14:603:47486:12:0:71:357:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:replaced by v + t – f(xs) = r and x* would be the x minimizing  x + f(x).

15:605:47608:13:14:72:203:695:144:Times:144:Times:B:since p′(0)h + 1 < 0 by (3). 
15:606:47637:14:14:108:512:681:144:Times:144:Times:A:To show that xs* < x*, it suffices to show that EU′(x*) < 0, since EU′′(xs) < 0.  Now

15:614:48178:14:13:72:535:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:On the left is the marginal benefit to an injurer of raising the standard; it is the amount –qp′(xs)h 
15:615:48279:13:14:71:533:557:144:Times:144:Times:B:by which the payment to victims falls, weighted by the expected marginal utility of money.  On 
15:616:48374:14:14:71:524:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:the right is the marginal cost of raising the standard, which involves a high marginal utility of 
15:617:48472:14:14:71:413:529:144:Times:144:Times:B:money because the cost is incurred when the standard is imposed.42  ~

15:619:48541:14:14:108:542:501:144:Times:144:Times:A:Let us next consider the case where victims are risk averse.  Then the expected utility of a 
15:620:48634:14:13:72:117:487:144:Times:144:Times:B:victim is 
15:621:48644:13:14:72:324:474:144:Times:144:Times:B:(15)     EV(xs) = (1 – q)V(v + t) + qV(v + t – p(xs)h). 
15:622:48700:14:14:72:503:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:The risk borne by the victim is the expected harm given the standard, p(xs)h, because it is 
15:623:48792:14:14:72:537:446:144:Times:144:Times:B:assumed that a victim pays the actuarially fair premium for insurance coverage against suffering 
15:624:48889:14:14:72:519:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:a loss h.43  The Pareto optimal standard is therefore determined by maximizing (6) subject to 
15:625:48983:14:13:72:300:418:144:Times:144:Times:B:(16)      (1 – q)V(v + t) + qV(v + t – p(xs)h) = r, 
15:626:49035:13:14:71:352:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:where r is a reference level of expected utility of victims.  
15:627:49097:14:14:107:530:391:144:Times:144:Times:A:I wish to show that an analogue of Proposition 1 holds.  A way to view Proposition 1 is 
15:628:49185:14:14:71:533:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:that it shows that when victims are risk neutral, the effect of injurer risk aversion is to lower the 
15:629:49287:14:14:71:533:363:144:Times:144:Times:B:Pareto optimal standard from what it would otherwise be (for when injurers are risk neutral, the 
15:630:49384:14:14:71:529:349:144:Times:144:Times:B:Pareto optimal standard is x* by Remark 1).  Hence, a natural analogue of Proposition 1 is that 
15:631:49480:14:13:71:542:335:144:Times:144:Times:B:when victims are risk averse, the effect of injurer risk aversion is also to lower the Pareto optimal 
15:632:49582:13:14:71:280:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:standard from what it would otherwise be.  
15:633:49625:14:14:107:113:308:144:Times:144:Times:A:  
15:634:49627:14:14:107:537:294:144:Times:144:Times:A:Proposition 2.  Assume that injurers are risk averse and that victims are also risk averse.  
15:635:49720:14:13:71:528:280:144:Times:144:Times:B:Then the Pareto optimal standard of care xs* is such that 0 < xs* < x**, where x** is the Pareto 
15:636:49817:13:14:71:522:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:optimal standard of care when injurers are risk neutral and victims are risk averse.  Here x* < 
15:637:49913:14:14:71:283:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:x**, and xs* is determined by (A11) below.

15:639:49956:14:14:108:532:225:144:Times:144:Times:A:Notes.  (a) The explanation for why xs* is positive is similar to that given in Proposition 
15:640:50048:14:13:71:537:211:144:Times:144:Times:B:1.  The only difference is that here, because victims are risk averse, the reduction in the payment 
15:641:50148:13:14:71:537:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:t that injurers make if xs is raised slightly from zero is greater than when victims are risk neutral, 
15:642:50251:14:14:72:521:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:for risk averse victims benefit from a reduction in risk bearing.  This reinforces the benefit to 
15:643:50349:14:15:72:241:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:injurers from raising xs from zero.  
15:644:50386:15:8:108:255:155:144:Times:144:Times:A:                                                 
15:645:50435:8:16:108:540:147:42:Times:100:Times:F:42 I will not comment on first-order conditions in later propositions because their interpretations are similar. 
15:646:50548:16:7:108:113:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:  
15:647:50550:7:16:108:523:124:42:Times:100:Times:F:43 If the premium for insurance coverage is actuarially fair, it is a standard result that risk-averse parties 
15:648:50661:16:11:72:534:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:would maximize their expected utility by purchasing full coverage; see, for example, Shavell (1987, chapter 8).  In 
15:649:50777:11:12:72:498:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:any event, even if victims cannot insure against h, the essential nature of the conclusion I draw in the next 
15:650:50887:12:0:72:196:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:proposition would not change. 
16:651:50920:0:13:108:544:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:(b) The explanation for why xs* < x** is analogous to that given in Proposition 1 for why  
16:652:51011:13:14:72:533:695:144:Times:144:Times:B:xs* < x*.  Namely, if xs is marginally reduced from x**, then since the injurer is risk averse and 
16:653:51110:14:14:71:529:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:is bearing positive risk, he benefits from a reduction in risk-bearing, whereas this benefit is not 
16:654:51210:14:14:71:261:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:reflected in the determination of  x**.   
16:655:51252:14:14:108:525:653:144:Times:144:Times:A:(c) The explanation for why x* < x** is that when victims are risk averse, they benefit 
16:656:51340:14:13:71:519:639:144:Times:144:Times:B:from higher xs not only because care lowers expected harm but also because care lowers risk-
16:657:51432:13:14:72:532:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:bearing.  Thus, the reduction in t is greater when xs is raised.  Accordingly, risk-neutral injurers 
16:658:51533:14:14:72:362:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:find a higher xs desirable than when victims are risk neutral. 
16:659:51596:14:14:108:111:598:144:Times:144:Times:A: 
16:660:51596:14:14:108:235:584:144:Times:144:Times:A:Proof. See the Appendix.

16:662:51622:13:14:72:183:557:144:Times:144:Times:B:3.2  Payment for harm 
16:663:51644:14:14:108:539:543:144:Times:144:Times:A:Now assume that if the state learns that the activity is harmful, the legal rule that the state 
16:664:51740:14:14:71:536:529:144:Times:144:Times:B:adopts requires injurers to make payments to victims based on harm.  Two rules of this type that 
16:665:51837:14:14:71:505:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:will be equivalent under our assumptions will be considered: strict liability and corrective 
16:666:51930:14:13:71:493:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:taxes.44 Under strict liability, injurers must pay damages to victims if harm occurs.  Let 
16:667:52021:13:14:108:432:488:144:Times:144:Times:A:d = damages payment that an injurer must make if he causes harm. 
16:668:52086:14:14:71:517:474:144:Times:144:Times:B:In our legal system, d is generally intended to equal h, but here we will determine the Pareto 
16:669:52181:14:14:71:534:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:optimal d, which need not equal h.  Under strict liability, it will be assumed that, if the injurer is 
16:670:52284:14:14:71:505:446:144:Times:144:Times:B:risk averse and strict liability is imposed, the injurer can purchase liability insurance at an 
16:671:52380:14:13:71:529:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:actuarially fair rate.  Hence, if strict liability is imposed, the injurer will purchase full coverage 
16:672:52483:13:14:71:536:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:against d and pay a premium of p(x)d.45  (Note that the assumption that injurers can buy liability 
16:673:52582:14:14:72:527:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:insurance if the activity is found harmful is consistent with the assumption that injurers cannot 
16:674:52680:14:14:72:519:391:144:Times:144:Times:B:buy coverage against legal change, that is, the risk that the state will employ the rule of strict 
16:675:52779:14:14:72:483:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:liability.  In any event, the assumption that liability insurance can be purchased is not 
16:676:52869:14:13:72:300:363:144:Times:144:Times:B:essential.46)  Hence, the injurer’s utility will be 
16:677:52921:13:14:72:323:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:(17)    EU = (1 – q)U(u – t) + qU(u – t – x – p(x)d).  
16:678:52976:14:14:108:543:336:144:Times:144:Times:A:Under corrective taxes, injurers are required to make a payment of p(x)d if the state learns 
16:679:53069:14:14:72:530:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:that the activity is harmful.47  Hence, if d equals h, the payment equals the expected harm from 
16:680:53166:14:27:72:515:308:144:Times:144:Times:B:the activity.  The expected utility of an injurer under the corrective tax is also given by (17). 
16:681:53264:27:7:108:255:281:144:Times:144:Times:A:                                                 
16:682:53313:7:16:108:538:274:42:Times:100:Times:F:44 A fine paid to the state would also be equivalent to damages paid to victims given the assumptions in the 
16:683:53422:16:12:72:102:258:100:Times:100:Times:F:model. 
16:684:53429:12:7:108:113:246:100:Times:100:Times:F:  
16:685:53431:7:16:108:537:239:42:Times:100:Times:F:45 This presumes that liability insurers can observe x and base the premium on it; see, for example, Shavell 
16:686:53540:16:11:71:147:223:100:Times:100:Times:F:(1987, chapter 8).  
16:687:53560:11:7:107:110:212:100:Times:100:Times:F: 
16:688:53560:7:16:108:536:205:42:Times:100:Times:F:46 If instead it was assumed that injurers could not purchase liability insurance, the conclusion to be shown 
16:689:53670:16:12:71:517:189:100:Times:100:Times:F:that d < h is Pareto optimal would only be reinforced, as injurer risk-bearing due to legal uncertainty would be 
16:690:53783:12:11:71:104:177:100:Times:100:Times:F:greater. 
16:691:53792:11:7:107:110:166:100:Times:100:Times:F: 
16:692:53792:7:16:108:529:159:42:Times:100:Times:F:47 It would be straightforward to consider a variation of the model in which, in the initial situation before 
16:693:53902:16:12:72:524:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:uncertainty is resolved, a subsidy (a negative corrective tax) is enjoyed by the individuals with utility function U 
16:694:54018:12:11:72:531:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:because of the existence of a positive externality generated by their choice of x. Then, it would be discovered with 
16:695:54135:11:12:72:536:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:probability q that the positive externality does not exist.  Hence, the Pareto optimal subsidy would fall to zero if the 
16:696:54256:12:11:72:512:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:parties who had enjoyed the subsidy were risk-neutral, but the subsidy would not fall to zero if they were risk 
16:697:54368:11:12:72:541:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:averse.  This variation of the model can be viewed as describing the possible elimination of the mortgage interest tax 
16:698:54486:12:0:72:538:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:deduction, since it is a form of subsidy that could be interpreted as justified by a positive externality associated with 
17:699:54628:0:13:108:526:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:Note that the risk borne by the injurer is the cost of care x plus the (premium) payment 
17:700:54717:13:14:71:396:695:144:Times:144:Times:B:p(x)d (whereas under regulation the risk was only the cost of care). 
17:701:54786:14:14:107:489:681:144:Times:144:Times:A:The level of care that an injurer chooses maximizes (17),48 so that it minimizes 
17:702:54867:14:14:71:156:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:(18)     x + p(x)d. 
17:703:54887:14:14:71:522:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:Since (18) is strictly convex in x, there exists a unique x minimizing it, which will be denoted 
17:704:54984:14:13:72:533:639:144:Times:144:Times:B:x(d).  Further, since the derivative of (18) is 1 + p′(x)d, we know that if 1 + p′(0)d ≥ 0, then x(d) 
17:705:55085:13:14:71:530:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:= 0.  Consequently, if d ≤ –1/p′(0), then x(d) = 0.  Otherwise, x(d) is positive and is determined 
17:706:55182:14:14:71:86:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:by 
17:707:55185:14:14:71:178:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:(19)    1 + p′(x)d  = 0. 
17:708:55210:14:14:71:501:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:From implicit differentiation of (19), we obtain that p′′(x)x′(d)d + p′(x) = 0, implying that 
17:709:55304:14:13:71:233:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:(20)    x′(d) = –p′(x)/(p′′(x)d) > 0. 
17:710:55342:13:14:71:522:557:144:Times:144:Times:B:If victims are risk neutral, the expected wealth of a victim will be v + t – qp(x)(h – d),49 since 
17:711:55441:14:14:71:343:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:victims bear h – d of their losses.50  Thus, we must have 
17:712:55499:14:14:72:219:529:144:Times:144:Times:B:(21)    v + t – qp(x)(h – d) = r, 
17:713:55533:14:14:72:325:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:where r is again a reference level of wealth.  Hence, 
17:714:55587:14:13:72:220:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:(22)    t = r – v + qp(x)(h – d). 
17:715:55621:13:14:72:511:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:The Pareto optimal level of damages d for risk-averse injurers and risk neutral victims thus 
17:716:55714:14:14:72:444:474:144:Times:144:Times:B:maximizes (17) subject to (22).  Hence, d* is determined by maximization of 
17:717:55790:14:14:72:323:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:(23)   EU(d) = (1 – q)U(u – r + v – qp(x(d))(h – d))

17:719:55910:14:13:72:336:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:Before we determine this d*, let us note the following.

17:721:55966:14:14:108:508:405:144:Times:144:Times:A:Remark 2.  Assume that both injurers and victims are risk neutral.  Then the Pareto 
17:722:56050:14:14:72:279:391:144:Times:144:Times:B:optimal level of damages d* is the harm h. 
17:723:56093:14:14:108:111:377:144:Times:144:Times:A: 
17:724:56093:14:13:108:537:363:144:Times:144:Times:A:Remark 2 confirms that when parties are risk neutral, the conventionally optimal level of 
17:725:56183:13:14:71:536:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:liability equal to the harm is Pareto optimal and that the conventionally best corrective tax equal 
17:726:56283:14:14:71:523:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:to the expected harm is Pareto optimal.  To demonstrate these conclusions, observe that when 
17:727:56376:14:14:71:267:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:injurers are risk neutral, (23) reduces to  
17:728:56420:14:13:71:252:308:144:Times:144:Times:B:(24)     u – r + v – q[p(x(d))h + x(d)]. 
17:729:56461:13:14:71:538:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:To maximize (24), [p(x(d))h + x(d)] must be minimized over d.  That is achieved if d is h, for by 
17:730:56559:14:14:71:288:281:144:Times:144:Times:B:definition, x(h) minimizes p(x)h + x over x.   
17:731:56606:14:14:107:452:267:144:Times:144:Times:A:Now let me describe the result when injurers are risk averse.  We have

17:733:56678:14:13:107:517:239:144:Times:144:Times:A:Proposition 3.  Assume that injurers are risk averse and that victims are risk neutral.  
17:734:56767:13:14:71:536:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:Then the Pareto optimal level of damages d* is such that 0 ≤ d* < h, where h is harm; the Pareto 
17:735:56863:14:19:71:542:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:optimal corrective tax is p(x(d*))d* and thus satisfies 0 ≤ p(x(d*))d* < p(x(d*))h.  Further, d* = 0 
17:736:56963:19:15:71:466:193:144:Times:100:Times:B:if h is in [0, h^], where h^ > –1/p′(0), and if d* > 0, it is determined by (32) below.   
17:737:57052:15:12:108:255:178:144:Times:144:Times:A:

17:739:57101:7:16:108:542:159:42:Times:100:Times:F:48 It is supposed that injurers take t as given, the motivation for which is that there are many injurers, so that 
17:740:57216:16:12:71:355:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:actions of any single injurer would have only a negligible effect on t.   
17:741:57290:12:7:107:110:131:100:Times:100:Times:F: 
17:742:57290:7:16:108:456:124:42:Times:100:Times:F:49 Here and below, I will sometimes write x instead of x(d) for notational convenience. 
17:743:57377:16:7:107:110:108:100:Times:100:Times:F: 
17:744:57377:7:16:108:534:101:42:Times:100:Times:F:50 Under the rule of strict liability, victims are directly compensated by injurers.  Under corrective taxes, it 
17:745:57490:16:0:71:435:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:is the government that collects payments and I will interpret the government as the victim. 
18:746:57587:0:13:108:536:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:Notes.  (a)  The explanation for why d* will be zero for h sufficiently low is as follows.   
18:747:57680:13:14:72:520:695:144:Times:144:Times:B:Raising d from zero has no effect on x until d exceeds –1/p′(0), as was noted above.  In other 
18:748:57775:14:14:72:538:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:words, a positive level of risk must be imposed on injurers to induce them to begin to raise x and 
18:749:57874:14:19:72:525:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:lower p(x).  This imposition of risk-bearing may not be worthwhile because it may exceed the 
18:750:57967:19:14:72:523:648:144:Times:144:Times:B:benefit to injurers from lowering the payment t that they make to victims.51  That h^ > –1/p′(0) 
18:751:58064:14:13:71:528:634:144:Times:144:Times:B:implies that there are h for which x*(h) is positive—the conventionally optimal level of care is 
18:752:58161:13:14:71:399:621:144:Times:144:Times:B:positive—yet for which d* is zero due to the factor of risk-bearing.  
18:753:58231:14:14:107:506:607:144:Times:144:Times:A:(b)  The explanation for why d* < h is that if d is slightly lowered from h, then the 
18:754:58317:14:14:71:508:593:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase in t will approximate the expected reduction in care and payments;52 that is, if the 
18:755:58411:14:14:72:516:579:144:Times:144:Times:B:injurer were risk neutral, the marginal effect on his well-being would be zero.  But since the 
18:756:58506:14:13:72:519:565:144:Times:144:Times:B:injurer is risk averse and is bearing positive risk, he benefits from a reduction in risk-bearing 
18:757:58604:13:14:72:456:552:144:Times:144:Times:B:from the marginal reduction in d, implying that his expected utility must rise.53  
18:758:58687:14:14:108:111:538:144:Times:144:Times:A: 
18:759:58687:14:14:108:539:524:144:Times:144:Times:A:Proof.  I first show that EU(d) is strictly decreasing in d for d in [0, –1/p′(0)].  From (23), 
18:760:58783:14:14:72:115:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:we have 
18:761:58791:14:13:72:462:496:144:Times:144:Times:B:(25)    EU′(d) = (1 – q)[–qp′(x)x′(d)(h – d) + qp(x)]U′(u – r + v – qp(x(d))(h – d)) 
18:762:58876:13:14:107:428:483:144:Times:144:Times:A:             + q[–qp′(x)x′(d)(h – d) + qp(x) – x′(d) – p′(x)x′(d)d – p(x)] 
18:763:58949:14:14:107:441:469:144:Times:144:Times:A:                                      × U′(u – r + v – qp(x)(h – d)) – x(d) – p(x)d). 
18:764:59033:14:14:71:517:455:144:Times:144:Times:B:Now for d in [0, –1/p′(0)], recall that x(d) = 0.  Hence, x′(d) = 0 in the interval.  Thus, in that 
18:765:59133:14:14:71:185:441:144:Times:144:Times:B:interval (25) reduces to 
18:766:59158:14:13:71:349:427:144:Times:144:Times:B:(26)    EU′(d) = (1 – q)[qp(0)]U′(u – r + v – qp(0)(h – d)) 
18:767:59218:13:14:107:414:414:144:Times:144:Times:A:               + q[qp(0) – p(0)]U′(u – r + v – qp(0)(h – d)) – p(0)d). 
18:768:59288:14:14:71:253:400:144:Times:144:Times:B:Hence, for d in (0, –1/p′(0)], we have 
18:769:59327:14:14:71:384:386:144:Times:144:Times:B:(27)   EU′(d) < (1 – q)[qp(0)]U′(u – r + v – qp(0)(h – d) – p(0)d) 
18:770:59393:14:14:107:420:372:144:Times:144:Times:A:            + q[qp(0) – p(0)]U′(u – r + v – qp(0)(h – d) – p(0)d) = 0. 
18:771:59463:14:13:108:512:358:144:Times:144:Times:A:Let us next show that for any h in [0, –1/p′(0)], EU(d) is strictly decreasing in d for  
18:772:59552:13:14:72:529:345:144:Times:144:Times:B:d > –1/p′(0) and also that d*(h) = 0.  For d > –1/p′(0), we know that x(d) > 0, and from (25) we 
18:773:59649:14:14:71:113:331:144:Times:144:Times:B:see that  
18:774:59659:14:14:71:322:317:144:Times:144:Times:B:(28)   EU′(d) < {(1 – q)[–qp′(x)x′(d)(h – d) + qp(x)] 
18:775:59713:14:14:107:428:303:144:Times:144:Times:A:           + q[–qp′(x)x′(d)(h – d) + qp(x) – x′(d) – p′(x)x′(d)d – p(x)]} 
18:776:59785:14:19:107:438:289:144:Times:144:Times:A:                                      × U′(u – r + v – qp(x)(h – d)) – x(d) – p(x)d) 
18:777:59868:19:8:107:254:270:144:Times:144:Times:A:                                                 
18:778:59917:8:16:108:536:262:42:Times:100:Times:F:51 Note the contrast with Proposition 1, where the optimal standard of care xs* must be positive.  When the 
18:779:60025:16:11:71:528:246:100:Times:100:Times:F:level of care can be directly controlled as a standard by the state, no risk is imposed on injurers when the standard 
18:780:60143:11:12:71:542:235:100:Times:100:Times:F:begins to be raised from zero.  But here, as explained, when the level of care is only indirectly controlled by the state 
18:781:60265:12:11:71:542:223:100:Times:100:Times:F:through imposition of payments for harm, positive risk must be imposed before the standard begins to be raised from 
18:782:60381:11:12:71:277:212:100:Times:100:Times:F:zero.  This explains the difference in conclusions.   
18:783:60435:12:7:107:110:200:100:Times:100:Times:F: 
18:784:60435:7:16:108:450:193:42:Times:100:Times:F:52 Since t = r – v + qp(x(d))(h – d), the increase in t from a marginal reduction in d is 
18:785:60525:16:11:107:542:177:100:Times:100:Times:F:–qp′(x)x′(d)(h – d) + qp(x), so that at d = h, the marginal increase in t is qp(x(h)).  Expected care is qx(d), so 
18:786:60639:11:12:71:508:166:100:Times:100:Times:F:the marginal reduction in this quantity at d = h is –qx′(h).  Expected payments are qp(x(d))d, so the marginal 
18:787:60750:12:11:71:520:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:reduction in these at d = h is –qp′(x(h))x′(h)h – qp(x(h)).   Hence, the change in expected care and payments is –
18:788:60862:11:12:71:521:143:100:Times:100:Times:F:qx′(h) –qp′(x(h))x′(h)h – qp(x(h)) = –qp(x(h)) since qx′(h) + qp′(x(h))x′(h)h = qx′(h)(1 + p′(x(h))h) = 0.  Thus the 
18:789:60979:12:11:71:417:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:marginal increase in t does indeed offset the marginal decrease in expected expenses.  
18:790:61066:11:7:107:110:120:100:Times:100:Times:F: 
18:791:61066:7:16:108:535:113:42:Times:100:Times:F:53 In Shavell (1982), I considered the Pareto optimal level of damages assuming, unlike here, that possibly 
18:792:61174:16:12:72:527:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:risk-averse injurers know ex ante that their activity is subject to strict liability.  Then, when injurers can purchase 
18:793:61294:12:0:71:538:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:liability insurance, the Pareto optimal level of damages d* equals the harm h; see Proposition 4 in my earlier article. 
19:794:61417:0:13:108:378:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:          =   {[–qp′(x)x′(d)(h – d)] –q[x′(d) + p′(x)x′(d)d)]}  
19:795:61481:13:14:107:405:695:144:Times:144:Times:A:                          × U′(u – r + v – qp(x)(h – d)) – x(d) – p(x)d). 
19:796:61555:14:14:71:523:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:But –qp′(x)x′(d)(h – d) < 0 since d > h when d > –1/p′(0) and h is in [0, –1/p′(0)]; and [x′(d) + 
19:797:61653:14:14:71:542:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:p′(x)x′(d)d)] = x′(d)(1 + p′(x)d) = 0 since x(d) satisfies 1 + p′(x)d = 0.  Thus, the last line of (28) is 
19:798:61760:14:14:71:531:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:negative, showing that EU′(d) < 0 for d > –1/p′(0).  Consequently, EU(d) is decreasing for all d 
19:799:61856:14:13:71:420:639:144:Times:144:Times:B:given that h is in [0, –1/p′(0)].   It thus follows that d*(h) = 0 for such h. 
19:800:61935:13:19:108:542:626:144:Times:144:Times:A:We now show that for h > –1/p′(0) and sufficiently close to –1/p′(0), d*(h) = 0, so that the 
19:801:62028:19:14:72:531:607:144:Times:144:Times:B:asserted h^ exists.  We do this using a number of observations.  (i) For any h, d*(h) is either 0 or 
19:802:62129:14:14:71:490:593:144:Times:144:Times:B:exceeds  –1/p′(0): This is true since EU(d) is strictly decreasing in d in [0, –1/p′(0)], as 
19:803:62222:14:14:71:535:579:144:Times:144:Times:B:demonstrated in the first paragraph in this proof.  (ii) Let m(h) = maximum of EU(d, h) over d ≥ 
19:804:62318:14:13:72:506:565:144:Times:144:Times:B:–1/p′(0), where EU(d, h) is EU(d) given h.  Then m(h) is clearly decreasing in h.  (iii)  m(–
19:805:62411:13:14:72:533:552:144:Times:144:Times:B:1/p′(0)) > m(h) for h > –1/p′(0):  This follows from (ii).  (iv) EU(0, h) = U(u – r + v – qp((0))h) 
19:806:62511:14:14:72:522:538:144:Times:144:Times:B:is continuous in h.  (v) EU(0, –1/p′(0)) > EU(–1/p′(0), –1/p′(0)) = m(–1/p′(0)): The inequality 
19:807:62607:14:14:72:533:524:144:Times:144:Times:B:here follows because we showed that EU(d) is decreasing for d in [0, –1/p′(0)], and the equality 
19:808:62704:14:14:72:508:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:follows because we showed that EU(d) is decreasing for larger d when h does not exceed –
19:809:62792:14:13:72:514:496:144:Times:144:Times:B:1/p′(0).  (vi) EU(0, h) > m(–1/p′(0)) for all h above –1/p′(0) and sufficiently close to it: This 
19:810:62890:13:14:72:536:483:144:Times:144:Times:B:follows from (iv) and (v).  (vii) EU(0, h) > m(h) for all h above –1/p′(0) and sufficiently close to 
19:811:62991:14:14:72:536:469:144:Times:144:Times:B:it: This follows from (iii) and (vi).  (viii) d*(h) = 0 for all h above –1/p′(0) and sufficiently close 
19:812:63095:14:14:72:248:455:144:Times:144:Times:B:to it: This follows from (vii) and (i). 
19:813:63135:14:14:108:530:441:144:Times:144:Times:A:To show that d* < h, rewrite (25), making use of the fact that x′(d)(1 + p′(x)d) = 0 since

19:829:64081:14:14:71:542:220:144:Times:144:Times:B: Let us next consider the case in which victims are risk averse.  Hence, the expected utility 
19:830:64174:14:13:72:138:206:144:Times:144:Times:B:of a victim is 
19:831:64189:13:14:72:364:193:144:Times:144:Times:B:(33)        EV(d) = (1 – q)V(v + t) + qV(v + t – p(x(d))(h – d)) 
19:832:64254:14:14:72:525:179:144:Times:144:Times:B:since victims pay the fair insurance premium p(x(d))(h – d) for coverage against the risk h – d 
19:833:64349:14:14:72:534:165:144:Times:144:Times:B:that they bear.  The Pareto optimal standard is therefore determined by maximizing (17) subject 
19:834:64445:14:14:72:84:151:144:Times:144:Times:B:to 
19:835:64448:14:13:72:343:137:144:Times:144:Times:B:(34)        (1 – q)V(v + t) + qV(v + t – p(x(d))(h – d)) = r, 
19:836:64510:13:14:71:425:124:144:Times:144:Times:B:where r is a reference level of expected utility of victims.   We then have 
19:837:64586:14:14:108:111:110:144:Times:144:Times:A: 
19:838:64586:14:14:108:537:96:144:Times:144:Times:A:Proposition 4.  Assume that injurers are risk averse and that victims are also risk averse.  
19:839:64679:14:0:72:536:82:144:Times:144:Times:B:Then the Pareto optimal level of damages d* is such that 0 < d* < h, where h is harm; the Pareto 
20:840:64779:0:13:72:499:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:optimal corrective tax is p(x(d*)d* and satisfies 0 < p(x(d*)d* < p(x(d*)h.  Further, d* is 
20:841:64871:13:12:71:215:695:144:Times:100:Times:B:determined by (A27) below.   
20:842:64900:12:14:108:111:683:100:Times:100:Times:F: 
20:843:64900:14:13:108:539:669:144:Times:144:Times:A:Notes.  (a) The explanation for why d* is positive follows from the point that x(d) = 0 for 
20:844:64992:13:14:71:537:656:144:Times:144:Times:B:d in [0, –1/p′(0)].  In other words, raising d in this interval shifts risk from injurers to victims but 
20:845:65097:14:14:71:514:642:144:Times:144:Times:B:does not change the probability of harm and thus the risk to be shared between them.  Since 
20:846:65189:14:14:71:536:628:144:Times:144:Times:B:some degree of risk-sharing of a given risk between two risk-averse parties is desirable, d* must 
20:847:65287:14:14:71:138:614:144:Times:144:Times:B:be positive.54 
20:848:65301:14:13:108:519:600:144:Times:144:Times:A:(b)  The explanation for why d* < h follows from the explanation of this result in the 
20:849:65388:13:14:72:526:587:144:Times:144:Times:B:previous proposition, where victims were risk-neutral.  Here, although victims are risk averse, 
20:850:65484:14:14:72:505:573:144:Times:144:Times:B:they behave essentially as if they were risk neutral when d = h, for then they bear no risk.

20:852:65577:14:14:108:232:545:144:Times:144:Times:A:Proof. See the Appendix.

20:854:65603:13:14:72:201:518:144:Times:144:Times:B:4.  Concluding Comments 
20:855:65627:14:14:108:528:504:144:Times:144:Times:A:(a)  The generality of the model.  The chief qualitative conclusion of the analysis—that 
20:856:65716:14:14:72:533:490:144:Times:144:Times:B:legal change should be attenuated due to the bearing of risk by risk-averse parties subject to the 
20:857:65815:14:14:72:430:476:144:Times:144:Times:B:law—does not depend on a number of simplifying features of the model.   
20:858:65887:14:13:108:539:462:144:Times:144:Times:A:One assumption was that there was a single type of action parties could take: the exercise 
20:859:65978:13:14:72:515:449:144:Times:144:Times:B:of care after a legal change is announced.  If other types of action were considered, notably, 
20:860:66073:14:14:72:531:435:144:Times:144:Times:B:decisions about levels of care before a legal change, or decisions about levels of activity before 
20:861:66172:14:14:72:503:421:144:Times:144:Times:B:or after a legal change, nothing essential would be altered.  There would then be different 
20:862:66264:14:14:72:512:407:144:Times:144:Times:B:dimensions of conventional inefficiency of behavior engendered by the attenuation of legal 
20:863:66355:14:13:72:524:393:144:Times:144:Times:B:change, but some attenuation from efficiency would still generally be desirable to relieve risk-
20:864:66451:13:14:72:131:380:144:Times:144:Times:B:bearing.55    
20:865:66465:14:14:108:524:366:144:Times:144:Times:A:A second simplifying assumption was that the source of the change in the law was the 
20:866:66550:14:14:72:522:352:144:Times:144:Times:B:state’s learning that an activity was harmful rather than harmless.  If the source of the change 
20:867:66647:14:14:72:511:338:144:Times:144:Times:B:was, instead, information about the level of harmfulness of an activity already known to be 
20:868:66739:14:13:71:501:324:144:Times:144:Times:B:harmful, or about the technology or cost of harm reduction, that would not alter the main 
20:869:66829:13:14:72:144:311:144:Times:144:Times:B:conclusions.    
20:870:66845:14:14:108:526:297:144:Times:144:Times:A:A third simplifying assumption was that there was no insurance available against legal 
20:871:66932:14:14:72:539:283:144:Times:144:Times:B:change.  If partial insurance were available, risk-averse parties would still bear some risk, so that 
20:872:67034:14:14:72:316:269:144:Times:144:Times:B:attenuation of the legal change might be desirable. 
20:873:67086:14:13:108:531:255:144:Times:144:Times:A:(b) The desirable extent of attenuation depends on the degree of risk aversion and risk.  
20:874:67176:13:14:72:523:242:144:Times:144:Times:B:The optimal level of attenuation of legal change is a function of the degree of risk aversion of 
20:875:67273:14:14:72:539:228:144:Times:144:Times:B:parties and of the magnitude of the risks of losses that they bear.  Thus, for individuals subject to 
20:876:67375:14:14:72:509:214:144:Times:144:Times:B:substantial legal risks, such as homeowners with large mortgages confronting the potential 
20:877:67466:14:14:72:529:200:144:Times:144:Times:B:elimination of their interest deductions, significant attenuation would presumably be desirable, 
20:878:67563:14:13:72:531:186:144:Times:144:Times:B:whereas for publicly-held firms facing the possibility of a modest change in a workplace safety 
20:879:67659:13:18:71:332:173:144:Times:144:Times:B:rule, essentially no attenuation would be appropriate.  
20:880:67715:18:8:107:254:155:144:Times:144:Times:A:                                                 
20:881:67764:8:16:108:408:147:42:Times:100:Times:F:54 In Proposition 3, this logic did not apply since victims were risk neutral. 
20:882:67843:16:7:107:112:131:100:Times:100:Times:F:  
20:883:67845:7:16:108:525:124:42:Times:100:Times:F:55 For example, it should be clear to a reader who reviews Note (b) to Proposition 1 and note 41 that the 
20:884:67951:16:11:72:537:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:proof that the optimal standard xs* is less than the conventionally efficient level x* would be essentially unaltered if 
20:885:68072:11:12:71:527:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:x were chosen before the state learns whether the activity is harmful.  (Both xs* and x* would be lower under that 
20:886:68187:12:0:71:250:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:assumption, but xs* < x* would still hold.)   
21:887:68236:0:13:108:542:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:(c)  Attenuation of legal change in reality.  Legal change often appears to be attenuated in 
21:888:68329:13:14:71:527:695:144:Times:144:Times:B:practice, reflecting the hardships that it could cause for the parties to whom it is addressed.  If, 
21:889:68430:14:14:72:542:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:for example, a proposed regulation aimed at reduction of pollution would impose a large expense 
21:890:68526:14:14:72:493:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:on small businesses, they might be able to convince regulators to lessen the rigor of the 
21:891:68616:14:14:72:508:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:regulation.  Moreover, legal change is frequently delayed or implemented in phases.  A 10 
21:892:68706:14:13:72:517:639:144:Times:144:Times:B:percent increase in a tax rate might be achieved through a 5 percent increase in one year and 
21:893:68800:13:14:72:525:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:another 5 percent increase in a second year.  Also of relevance is grandfathering, under which 
21:894:68895:14:14:72:507:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:parties who are already engaged in an activity governed by a legal rule are exempted from 
21:895:68985:14:14:72:540:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:having to satisfy a legal change bearing on it.  Grandfathering is obviously a form of attenuation, 
21:896:69085:14:14:72:533:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:as it arrests legal change for the parties engaged in an activity, and grandfathering possesses the 
21:897:69185:14:13:72:532:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:beneficial feature that these parties may be least able to bear the risk of change (parties who are 
21:898:69285:13:14:72:543:557:144:Times:144:Times:B:only contemplating entry into the activity have the option to delay doing so or not to enter at all).  
21:899:69388:14:14:72:495:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:In sum, legal change seems to display a broadly attenuated character in reality, which is 
21:900:69478:14:14:72:286:529:144:Times:144:Times:B:consistent with the analysis of this article.56  
21:901:69527:14:14:108:509:515:144:Times:144:Times:A:(d) Attenuation of legal change versus government compensation.  Although it was 
21:902:69608:14:13:72:540:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:shown in this article that attenuation of legal change is a desirable policy given the unavailability 
21:903:69710:13:14:72:536:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:of insurance coverage against modifications of the law, other policies were not considered.  One 
21:904:69807:14:14:72:536:474:144:Times:144:Times:B:such policy is government compensation for the losses caused by legal change, and I restrict my 
21:905:69903:14:14:72:176:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:remarks here to it.57   
21:906:69927:14:14:108:499:446:144:Times:144:Times:A:Consider the risk of losses due to adoption of a new regulation.  Then a policy of 
21:907:70010:14:13:72:515:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:government compensation might allow achievement of an ideal outcome.  In particular, full 
21:908:70100:13:14:72:522:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:compensation could be granted for the cost of meeting a new regulation (such as the cost to a 
21:909:70194:14:14:72:516:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:gasoline service station of installing new, mandated holding tanks), so that no risk would be 
21:910:70288:14:14:71:534:391:144:Times:144:Times:B:borne by parties subject to the regulation.  Hence, there would be no reason for society to lower 
21:911:70386:14:14:71:538:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:the required level of care from the conventionally efficient level (no reason to lower the required 
21:912:70486:14:13:71:507:363:144:Times:144:Times:B:quality of the holding tanks from the efficient level), and the best possible outcome would 
21:913:70578:13:14:71:201:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:apparently be obtained.58   
21:914:70606:14:14:108:535:336:144:Times:144:Times:A:Next consider the risk of losses due to the use of a legal rule requiring a payment.  Here, 
21:915:70698:14:14:72:526:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:a policy of government compensation would be equivalent to attenuation of the payment.  For 
21:916:70790:14:13:71:536:308:144:Times:144:Times:B:example, suppose that a pollution tax of $10 per pound of pollutant might be enacted and that, if 
21:917:70888:13:14:71:531:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:it is, the government would provide $3 of compensation per pound of the taxed pollutant.  This 
21:918:70983:14:23:71:526:281:144:Times:144:Times:B:program would clearly lead to the same result as a tax of $7 per pound unaccompanied by any 
21:919:71075:23:7:107:254:258:144:Times:144:Times:A:                                                 
21:920:71124:7:16:108:530:251:42:Times:100:Times:F:56 That legal change is often observed to be attenuated may also be explained in part by a rationale that is 
21:921:71233:16:12:72:526:235:100:Times:100:Times:F:independent of risk aversion: to avoid wasting resources already committed to comply with the law (if a gasoline 
21:922:71346:12:11:72:531:223:100:Times:100:Times:F:service station recently installed a holding tank that met then-relevant regulations, it could be wasteful to force the 
21:923:71466:11:12:72:530:212:100:Times:100:Times:F:service station to replace that tank with a slightly more efficient one).  This point is developed in Shavell (2008).   
21:924:71586:12:11:72:531:200:100:Times:100:Times:F:The attenuation of legal change may also be  ascribed to the self-interest and political power of parties who would 
21:925:71702:11:12:72:457:189:100:Times:100:Times:F:be adversely affected by a legal change (whether or not attenuation has an economic rationale).  
21:926:71799:12:7:108:111:177:100:Times:100:Times:F: 
21:927:71799:7:16:108:538:170:42:Times:100:Times:F:57 As I noted in the introduction, the economically-oriented literature on legal change focuses on the policy 
21:928:71909:16:11:71:198:154:100:Times:100:Times:F:of government compensation.   
21:929:71939:11:7:107:110:143:100:Times:100:Times:F: 
21:930:71939:7:16:108:519:136:42:Times:100:Times:F:58 I say “apparently” because the argument just given elides the following question:  Does the cause of 
21:931:72043:16:12:71:540:120:100:Times:100:Times:F:failure of the private market to supply insurance coverage against legal change also bear on the government’s ability 
21:932:72161:12:11:71:517:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:to provide compensation?  Notably, if the cause of the failure of the insurance market to supply coverage is the 
21:933:72274:11:12:71:531:97:100:Times:100:Times:F:correlation of losses caused by a legal change, would the correlation of these losses also constitute a problem for a 
21:934:72392:12:0:71:424:85:100:Times:100:Times:F:government compensation program (which must ultimately be financed by taxpayers)?  
22:935:72478:0:13:72:532:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:compensation.  Hence, since I considered all possible levels of attenuation of a corrective tax, I 
22:936:72577:13:14:72:534:695:144:Times:144:Times:B:implicitly considered the policy of government compensation for losses due to a corrective tax.  
22:937:72674:14:14:108:524:681:144:Times:144:Times:A:A more expansive analysis of legal change and aversion to risk than that of this article 
22:938:72763:14:14:72:518:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:would include government provision of compensation or government provision of insurance 
22:939:72851:14:0:72:427:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:coverage, as an alternative to, or complement of, attenuated legal change.

25:1029:76562:13:14:144:147:695:144:Times:144:Times:A: 
25:1030:76562:14:14:72:531:681:144:Times:144:Times:B:Proof of Proposition 2.  Equation (16) determines t as a function of xs, which we write as t(xs).  
25:1031:76661:14:14:72:333:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:Implicit differentiation of (16) with respect to xs gives 
25:1032:76719:14:14:72:234:653:144:Times:144:Times:B:(A1)     t′(xs) = qp′(xs)hz(xs) < 0,   
25:1033:76758:14:13:72:104:639:144:Times:144:Times:B:where 
25:1034:76763:13:14:72:459:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:(A2)     z(xs) = V′(v + t(xs) – p(xs)h)/[(1 – q)V′(v + t(xs)) + qV′(v + t(xs) – p(xs)h)]. 
25:1035:76853:14:14:71:118:612:144:Times:144:Times:B:Note that 
25:1036:76863:14:14:71:155:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:(A3)    z(xs) > 1.  
25:1037:76883:14:14:72:213:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:Differentiation of (A1) gives 
25:1038:76913:14:13:72:284:570:144:Times:144:Times:B:(A4)    t′′(xs) = qp′′(xs)hz(xs) + qp′(xs)hz′(xs). 
25:1039:76964:13:14:72:243:557:144:Times:144:Times:B:Since z′(xs) < 0,59 (A4) implies that 
25:1040:77002:14:14:72:156:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:(A5)    t′′(xs) > 0. 
25:1041:77023:14:14:72:405:529:144:Times:144:Times:B:Let us first show that xs* > 0.  Now xs* is determined by maximizing 
25:1042:77092:14:14:72:334:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:(A6)    EU(xs) = (1 – q)U(u – t(xs)) + qU(u – t(xs) – xs) 
25:1043:77150:14:13:72:158:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:over xs.  We have 
25:1044:77168:13:14:72:422:488:144:Times:144:Times:B:(A7)    EU′(xs) = –(1 – q)t′(xs)U′(u – t(xs)) – (t′(xs) + 1)qU′(u – t(xs) – xs). 
25:1045:77249:14:14:72:109:474:144:Times:144:Times:B:Hence, 
25:1046:77256:14:14:72:387:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:(A8)    EU′(0) = –(1 – q)t′(0)U′(u – t(0)) – (t′(0) + 1)qU′(u – t(0)) 
25:1047:77326:14:14:72:264:446:144:Times:144:Times:B:           =  –(t′(0) + q)U′(u – t(0)). 
25:1048:77365:14:13:72:95:432:144:Times:144:Times:B:But  
25:1049:77370:13:14:72:273:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:(A9)     t′(0) = qp′(0)hz(0) < qp′(0)h < –q, 
25:1050:77415:14:14:72:537:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:where the first inequality holds because z(0) > 1 and the second inequality holds because of (3).  
25:1051:77514:14:14:72:294:391:144:Times:144:Times:B:Hence, EU′(0) > 0, so that xs* > 0 as claimed. 
25:1052:77561:14:14:72:436:377:144:Times:144:Times:B: Let us next prove that xs* < x**.  The latter is found by maximizing 
25:1053:77630:14:13:72:346:363:144:Times:144:Times:B:(A10)     EU(xs) = (1 – q)U(u – t(xs)) + qU(u – t(xs) – xs)  
25:1054:77691:13:14:72:402:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:            = (1 – q)(u – t(xs)) + q(u – t(xs) – xs) = u – (t(xs) + qxs) 
25:1055:77763:14:14:71:409:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:over xs since injurers are risk neutral.  Therefore x** is determined by 
25:1056:77836:14:14:72:174:322:144:Times:144:Times:B:(A11)       t′(xs) = –q. 
25:1057:77861:14:13:72:528:308:144:Times:144:Times:B:Given (A11) and the fact that t′′(xs) > 0, we know that if t′(xs*) <  –q, it must be that xs*< x**.  
25:1058:77961:13:14:71:483:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:Hence, we want to show t′(xs*) <  –q.  From (A7), we know that xs* is determined by 
25:1059:78044:14:14:72:405:281:144:Times:144:Times:B:(A12)      –(1 – q)t′(xs)U′(u – t(xs)) – (t′(xs) + 1)qU′(u – t(xs) – xs) = 0, 
25:1060:78122:14:14:72:195:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:which implies that at xs*, 
25:1061:78149:14:14:72:439:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:(A13)     t′(xs) = –qU′(u – t(xs) – xs)/[(1 – q)U′(u – t(xs)) + qU′(u – t(xs) – xs)] 
25:1062:78234:14:13:72:482:239:144:Times:144:Times:B:         < –qU′(u – t(xs) – xs)/[(1 – q)U′(u – t(xs) – xs) + qU′(u – t(xs) – xs)] =  –q, 
25:1063:78322:13:14:72:183:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:establishing the claim. 
25:1064:78346:14:14:72:416:212:144:Times:144:Times:B: Last, let us show that x* < x**.  From (A11) and (A1), we have 
25:1065:78409:14:14:71:219:198:144:Times:144:Times:B:(A14)    qp′(x**)hz(x**) = –q, 
25:1066:78440:14:14:72:167:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:which implies that  
25:1067:78460:14:13:72:238:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:(A15)    p′(x**)h = –1/z(x**) > –1 
25:1068:78495:13:25:72:451:157:144:Times:144:Times:B:since, by (A3), z(x**) > 1.  Because p′(x*)h = –1 and p′′(x) > 0, (A15) implies

25:1070:78625:8:16:108:531:124:42:Times:100:Times:F:59 It suffices to demonstrate that the numerator of the derivative of z(xs) is negative since the denominator 
25:1071:78735:16:11:71:522:108:100:Times:100:Times:F:must be positive.  This numerator is readily verified to be (1 – q)(t′(xs) – p′(xs)h)V′′(v + t – p(xs)h)V′(v + t) – (1 –

26:1081:79436:13:14:71:108:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:Hence,

26:1089:79898:14:14:71:403:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:Since x(d) = 0 for d in [0, –1/p′(0)], x′(d) = 0 in this interval.  Hence,

26:1094:80196:14:14:71:195:446:144:Times:144:Times:B:But from (A20), we have

26:1097:80366:14:14:71:262:405:144:Times:144:Times:B:Thus, EU′(0) > 0, showing that d* > 0.
