2:24:768:14:13:62:130:561:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Introduction 
2:25:780:13:14:62:65:548:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
2:26:780:14:14:62:535:534:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Alien  invasive  species  are  non-native  organisms  that  occur  outside  their  natural  adapted  habitat 
2:27:889:14:14:62:535:520:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and dispersal potential. They are seen as a threat not only to biodiversity and ecosystems, but also 
2:28:990:14:13:62:536:506:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to  socioeconomic  development,  livelihood  and  human  well-being.  In  India,  the  bioinvasion  of 
2:29:1093:13:14:62:536:493:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:coconut  palms  by  an  alien  invasive  mite  species Aceria  guerreronis,  popularly  known  as 
2:30:1191:14:14:62:535:479:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:C:‘Coconut mite’ accounting for enormous economic loss was first noticed just before the start of 
2:31:1287:14:14:62:535:465:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  new  millennium.  Among  the  plantation  crops,  coconut  (Cocos  nucifera L.)  is  of  prime 
2:32:1386:14:14:62:535:451:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:importance  in  the  marginal  homesteads  of  tropical  India.  India  is  the  third  largest  coconut 
2:33:1491:14:13:62:535:437:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:producer with plantation area of 1.9 million hectares and estimated production of 12.8 billion nuts 
2:34:1591:13:14:62:535:424:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:per  annum.  Coconut  sector  in  India  accounts  for  about  22.36%  of  the  world  production  while 
2:35:1696:14:14:62:535:410:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:contributes  approximately  US  $1600  million  to  the  total  GDP  of  India,  besides  providing 
2:36:1796:14:14:62:536:396:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:livelihood  securities  to  more  than  10  million  people  in  the  country.  During  the  period  2001–02, 
2:37:1906:14:14:62:535:382:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:mite attack has affected nearly 22.36 million coconut palms in 98,400 hectares in prime coconut 
2:38:2002:14:13:62:535:368:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f11:C:producing state ‘Kerala’ in India. The percentage reduction in nut weight due to mite infestation 
2:39:2100:13:14:62:535:355:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:was assessed to be 2.12 %. This paper hence seeks to study socioeconomic and livelihood impact 
2:40:2194:14:14:62:535:341:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of  the  coconut  mite  and  also  estimates  the  economic  loss  in  monetary  terms  from  documentary 
2:41:2300:14:14:62:535:327:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:evidence.  A  gap  analysis  using  sustainable  livelihood  index  (SLI)  framework  of  unpublished 
2:42:2402:14:14:62:535:313:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:primary  data  collected  during  the  peak  year  of  infestation  (yr.  2002)  among  coconut  growing 
2:43:2507:14:13:62:535:299:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:households  [N=120]  in  two  villages  of  Kerala  was  also  carried  out  to  assess  the  livelihood 
2:44:2612:13:15:62:101:286:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:impact. 
2:45:2619:15:13:62:180:271:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Material and Methods 
2:46:2639:13:14:62:65:258:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
2:47:2639:14:14:62:536:244:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Cross-sectional  data  collected  during yr. 2002  using  a  questionnaire  survey  was  used  for 
2:48:2738:14:14:62:536:230:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:analysing the marginal shock of mite damage on livelihood among two villages in Kerala (South 
2:49:2831:14:13:62:536:216:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:India). The data  was  analysed using a multivariate probit model to assess  the marginal effect of 
2:50:2931:13:14:62:536:203:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economic  shock  (dependent  variable)  and  accumulation  of  capital  (discrete  variables). The 
2:51:3029:14:14:62:535:189:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:following  discrete  variables were  used (1)  Physical  assets  (denoted  by  ownership  of  material 
2:52:3131:14:14:62:536:175:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:assets,  such  as  dwellings,  cycle,  livestock,  tractor); (2)  Financial  assets  (measured  by  savings 
2:53:3239:14:14:62:536:161:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:balance on accounts); (3) Social assets (membership of one or more networks); (4) Human assets 
2:54:3334:14:13:62:536:147:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(level  of  education); (5)  Natural  assets  (ownership  of  land,); (6)  Number  of  members  of 
2:55:3433:13:14:62:535:134:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:household employed in paid work; (7) Gender of person who has control over assets; (8) Locality 
2:56:3529:14:14:62:536:120:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(defined  by  panchayat) and data  of qualitative nature  was  obtained .  A three  point likert  type 
2:57:3628:14:14:62:460:106:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:scale was used to convert the qualitative attributes (discrete variables) to numbers. 
2:58:3708:14:14:62:65:92:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
2:59:3708:14:0:62:65:78:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
3:60:3708:0:14:62:426:760:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Based on the above a general probability model was developed as follows:  
3:61:3779:14:14:62:536:746:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:P(Shocki=1/x’i β)= F(x’i β). Where F(.) is  a  standard normal  cumulative  distribution  function. 
3:62:3877:14:14:62:536:732:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The  vector  of  covariates F(xi’) of  (Physical,  Financial,  Social,  Human  and  Natural  assets, 
3:63:3977:14:14:62:537:718:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Number  of  members  of  household  employed, Gender  of  main  earner  or  dominant  person  at  the 
3:64:4079:14:14:62:354:704:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:point of decision making, and Localityity) as discrete variables  
3:65:4144:14:13:62:325:690:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Then the marginal effect of shock will be estimated as 
3:66:4198:13:14:62:65:677:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
3:67:4198:14:0:62:65:663:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
3:68:4198:0:13:62:65:671:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
3:69:4198:13:14:62:301:658:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Furthermore, another set of data was collected in 
3:70:4248:14:14:62:297:644:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:peak  year  of  infestation  (yr.  2002)  using  semi-
3:71:4302:14:14:62:301:630:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:structured  interview. It  was  put into qualitative 
3:72:4353:14:14:62:300:616:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:analysis of livelihood impact using SLI. For this, 
3:73:4403:14:13:62:300:602:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Sustainable   Livelihood   Framework   (SLI)   of 
3:74:4453:13:14:62:300:589:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:DFID   (2005)   was   employed. The   difference 
3:75:4501:14:14:62:300:575:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:between the potential and achieved livelihood of 
3:76:4549:14:14:62:300:561:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:households   was   used   to estimate   the   gap, 
3:77:4599:14:14:62:300:547:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:measured by  finding  the  difference  between  the 
3:78:4649:14:13:62:300:533:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:area of two   pentagons [pentagon   formed   of 
3:79:4696:13:14:62:300:520:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:potential livelihood  capitals (Pp)  and pentagon 
3:80:4743:14:14:62:300:506:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:formed  of  achieved  livelihood  capitals (Pa)] as 
3:81:4792:14:14:62:301:492:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:shown in Figure  1. Additionally, for estimating 
3:82:4839:14:14:62:297:478:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  control  costs, public  documents  from  1998-
3:83:4890:14:13:62:278:464:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2008 were compiled and data was tabulated.

3:90:5122:14:14:61:535:324:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The  sudden  outbreak  of Aceria mites  in  coconut  plantations  has  threatened  the  very survival  of 
3:91:5226:14:13:61:344:310:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  copra  industry  in  South  India.  Severe  infestation  of 
3:92:5291:13:119:61:344:297:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Aceria mites  during  early  stages  of  nut inflicted damage

3:97:5502:14:14:350:536:123:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Committee Survey (2002), the 
3:98:5531:14:14:350:535:109:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:percentage infestation   of   mites   in 
3:99:5572:14:14:350:535:95:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:various states of India was as follows: 
3:100:5611:14:13:350:536:81:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Tamil  Nadu  40 - 50  %;  in  Karnataka 
3:101:5650:13:14:62:536:68:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:25- 30  %  and  in  Andhra  Pradesh  10 - 20%. In Kerala  state,  90  %  coconut  palms  in  1.2  million 
3:102:5753:14:14:62:536:54:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:was affected during 1998 (Sathiamma et al. 1998). The warting and thickening of epicarp (Fig. 2)

4:108:6068:14:14:62:535:746:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Besides  these,  mite  infested  under  sized  nuts  are  often discarded  by  the  traders  (Pushpa,  2006) 
4:109:6177:14:14:62:536:732:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:inflicting  heavy  losses  to  the  growers.  Loss  of  20–30%  in  terms  of  copra  yield  (Moore  et  al. 
4:110:6286:14:13:62:535:718:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:1989) severely affected the coconut oil industry. In Kerala alone, more than 1.5 million coconut 
4:111:6383:13:14:62:535:705:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:growers were affected by the infestation (Sathiamma et al. 1998), accounted for annual economic 
4:112:6479:14:14:62:535:691:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:loss of 0.3 million US $ (The Indian Express, 1999). Apart from the direct economic loss, various 
4:113:6576:14:14:62:535:677:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:authorities  under  the  central  and  state  governments  in  India  spend  enormous  amounts  for  the 
4:114:6681:14:14:62:535:663:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:control  and  management  of  the  mite.  Expenditure  incurred  by  various  states  in  India  for  mite 
4:115:6788:14:13:62:535:649:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:control  is  explained  in  the Figure 3. According  to  the  present  study,  compiled  data  evidence 
4:116:6892:13:14:62:536:636:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:showed that Indian government and various agencies incurred control costs of US $ 77.88 million 
4:117:6986:14:21:62:64:622:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to manage coconut mite in India for a 10-year period from 1998–2008.

4:127:7485:14:14:372:535:470:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:for  a  non-ownership  household. 
4:128:7519:14:14:372:536:456:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:While it   was found   that   the

4:130:7588:13:14:372:536:429:12:g_d0_f11:12:Times New Roman:A:such as,  women’s  networks like

4:133:7669:14:14:372:535:387:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:significant  in  averting household 
4:134:7704:14:13:372:536:373:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:shock incidence. Interestingly, 
4:135:7734:13:14:372:535:360:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:women  headed  households  were 
4:136:7766:14:14:62:536:346:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:more likely to avoid livelihood shocks (18 %). In such households, women were found to engage 
4:137:7856:14:14:62:535:332:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in  alternative  livelihood activities  such as banana chips, spices  and  condiments  processing and 
4:138:7955:14:14:62:535:318:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:tailoring. Such off-farm income might  have  helped  these  households  to  avert coconut mite 
4:139:8046:14:13:62:536:304:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:induced livelihood  shock.  Besides, triangulating  these  results  with  farmers’ perception analysis 
4:140:8146:13:14:62:536:291:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(Fig.  4) also  complimented  these findings. Around  67 % farm households perceived  that  their 
4:141:8240:14:14:62:536:277:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:financial capital turned  out  to  be  poor  compared  to  pre-mite  impact  period. The post  impact 
4:142:8340:14:14:62:535:263:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reduction  of financial  capital may  be  largely  due  to  the  loss  of  farm  income  from  coconut 
4:143:8441:14:14:62:536:249:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:production.  A  majority  of  the  farm  households  were forced to sell  their  physical  assets (cycle, 
4:144:8546:14:13:62:535:235:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:livestock etc.) during the impact period and post impact period. This may be the reason for 64% 
4:145:8641:13:14:62:540:222:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:farm   households   to   perceive   that   their   financial  capital  was  poor during the periods of mite  
4:146:8750:14:14:62:143:208:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:infestation.

4:148:8762:14:14:62:194:180:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Conclusions and Outlook 
4:149:8785:14:13:62:65:166:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
4:150:8785:13:14:62:535:153:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:With  the  increase  in  global  trade,  invasive  species  such  as Aceria  guerreronis are  gaining  more 
4:151:8892:14:14:62:535:139:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  more  prominence  around  the  world.  Thus  proper  quarantine  measures  must  be  adopted  to 
4:152:8994:14:14:62:536:125:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:prevent  the  entry  of  invasive  species  to  an  exotic  environment  in  the  age  of  globalisation  and 
4:153:9104:14:14:62:536:111:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:market  economy.  On  the  other  hand,  infestation  by  the  invasive Aceria  guerreronis mite  had 
4:154:9205:14:13:62:535:97:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:severe  economic  impact  on  coconut  plantations  in  India  from  1998-2005. Integrated  Pest 
4:155:9302:13:14:62:535:84:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Management  against  coconut  mite  was  found  successful  in  India  as  evidenced  by  infestation 
4:156:9404:14:0:62:536:70:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reduction since 2006.Multiple social networks, size of land holding,  gender and physical  capital

5:158:9505:0:14:62:535:760:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:was  found  to reduce  livelihood  shocks  from  coconut  mite. Considerable losses  through  mite 
5:159:9602:14:14:62:535:746:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:damage  and  control  costs  were  evident  in  the  country.  Despite  the  growing  evidence  of  the 
5:160:9706:14:14:62:536:732:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:economic  impacts  of  invasive  species,  the  level  of  awareness  amongst  decision-makers  is  still 
5:161:9812:14:13:62:533:718:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:relatively  low  in  emerging  economies  like  India.  It  is  therefore  critical  that  informed  decision-
5:162:9922:13:14:62:505:705:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:making regarding the prevention, eradication and control of invasive species be developed.
