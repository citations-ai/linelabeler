3:64:3008:0:34:72:208:708:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:1  Introduction
3:65:3023:34:22:72:540:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:It is common for economists to evaluate the contemporaneous effects of policy and behavioral
3:66:3115:22:22:72:540:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:variables  on  human  capital  outcomes  such  as  education,  employment,  and  wages.   With
3:67:3209:22:22:72:540:630:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:increasing  interest  lately,  researchers  are  studying  the  effect  of  early  life  (and  in  utero)
3:68:3314:22:22:72:540:608:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:exposures on these later life outcomes (Heckman, et al., 2013).  However, what is lacking in
3:69:3406:22:22:72:540:586:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the literature is a dynamic analysis of life-cycle impacts of evolving variables on time-varying
3:70:3502:22:22:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:outcomes.  For example, economists may examine the impact of early life health (e.g., birth
3:71:3593:22:22:72:540:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:weight, childhood illness, mother’s smoking behavior while pregnant) on later life outcomes
3:72:3684:22:22:72:540:520:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(e.g.,  adult  weight,  human  capital  accumulation,  mortality)  but,  generally,  are  unable  to
3:73:3784:22:21:72:540:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:demonstrate  the  mechanisms  through  which  variation  in  early  life  health  affects  later  life
3:74:3886:21:22:72:540:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:outcomes.  This omission often stems from lack of data on individuals at multiple times in
3:75:3976:22:22:72:540:455:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:their lives over a long period.  In addition to the fact that the outcome of interest may vary
3:76:4070:22:22:72:540:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:over the life cycle,  the explanatory variable itself (e.g.,  health) may evolve over time as a
3:77:4165:22:22:72:540:411:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dynamic process.  Hence,  as initial health impacts subsequent health,  time-varying health
3:78:4256:22:22:72:540:389:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:may  impact  the  outcome  of  interest  over  time.   Additionally,  causality  may  run  in  both
3:79:4355:22:22:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:directions:  for example,  health impacts employment and employment impacts subsequent
3:80:4441:22:22:72:540:345:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:health.1Thus, it is important to model the endogeneity of both time-varying variables and
3:81:4530:22:22:72:352:323:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to capture the dynamic impacts of each on each other.
3:82:4583:22:22:100:540:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In this study we quantify the life-cycle effects of human and health capital on wages
3:83:4668:22:22:72:540:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of females, with a focus on health measured by body mass.  We use data on women followed
3:84:4756:22:22:72:540:257:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:annually up to twenty years during the time of their lives when average annual weight gain
3:85:4846:22:21:72:540:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is  greatest.   We  allow  body  mass  to  explain  variation  in  wages  contemporaneously  condi-
3:86:4945:21:22:72:540:214:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tional on observed measures of human capital and productivity histories (namely, education,
3:87:5036:22:22:72:540:192:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:employment experience, marital status, and family size) and dynamically over the life cycle
3:88:5127:22:22:72:495:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:through its impact on the endogenous histories of behaviors that determine wages.
3:89:5208:22:22:100:540:148:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:It has been shown that the body mass of females is negatively correlated with wages
3:90:5291:22:22:72:540:126:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(Cawley, 2004).  The evidence in much of the literature reflects the contemporaneous rela-
3:91:5381:22:18:72:540:104:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tionship between current body mass and current wages.  Even in the cases where longitudinal
3:92:5472:18:15:85:539:86:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:1Employment  may  impact  health  directly  through  injury  or  work-related  stress  or  indirectly  through
3:93:5582:15:0:72:256:71:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:income and consumption of health inputs.
4:94:5623:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:observations on individuals have been available, researchers focus on the impact of current
4:95:5714:22:22:72:539:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:weight status on current earnings, and ignore the evolutionary process of weight gain.2While
4:96:5806:22:22:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:theory suggests avenues through which the history of an individual’s body mass may impact
4:97:5895:22:22:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wages in the present (e.g., through educational attainment and work experience), the causal
4:98:5986:22:22:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relationship between past health (body mass) and accumulation of human capital is rarely
4:99:6074:22:22:72:539:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:included in published analyses of weight on wages.3In our effort to understand how wages
4:100:6162:22:22:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:vary with a determinant of productivity such as body mass that evolves over time, we argue
4:101:6252:22:22:72:540:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that  it  is  important  to  consider  the  effects  of  this  characteristic  on  other  decisions  made
4:102:6357:22:22:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:jointly with employment over the life cycle.  Using a long panel of observations on young
4:103:6446:22:22:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:women as they approach middle age, we capture the influence of an evolving body mass on
4:104:6533:22:22:72:540:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:life-cycle decisions pertaining to schooling, employment, marital status, and family size.  The
4:105:6628:22:21:72:540:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:history of these decisions, as well as one’s body mass history, define cumulative measures of
4:106:6721:21:22:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:human capital and other productivity measures that explain variation in observed wages.  In
4:107:6812:22:22:72:507:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:turn, these behaviors may also impact the evolution of body mass over the life cycle.
4:108:6897:22:22:100:540:401:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Even after accounting for the effect of an evolving body mass on the productive de-
4:109:6980:22:22:72:540:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:terminants of wages that accumulate over the life cycle (e.g., educational attainment, work
4:110:7071:22:22:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:experience, marital status, and family size), variations in contemporaneous body mass may
4:111:7160:22:22:72:540:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:still explain observed variation in contemporaneous wages.  A significant contemporaneous
4:112:7249:22:22:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:effect may reflect wage penalties associated with lower productivity (i.e., through reduced
4:113:7340:22:22:72:540:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:health) conditional on other observed measures of productivity.  That is, the variables that
4:114:7432:22:22:72:540:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:traditionally summarize one’s human capital may not fully capture productivity.  Alterna-
4:115:7521:22:22:72:540:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tively, a contemporaneous effect of body mass may reflect employer preference for employees
4:116:7612:22:22:72:540:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with a particular outward appearance due to concerns about high expected medical care ex-
4:117:7701:22:21:72:540:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:penditure  affecting  firm  health  insurance  costs  or  consumer  distaste  for  obesity.   Finally,
4:118:7803:21:22:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:employers  may  simply  discriminate  (either  statistically  or  based  on  own  tastes)  against
4:119:7901:22:22:72:540:160:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:women with higher body mass.  In this paper, we establish the existence (or not) of a con-
4:120:7991:22:18:72:540:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:temporaneous wage penalty of body mass while also measuring the dynamic impact of body
4:121:8077:18:15:85:539:120:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:2Only  a  few  papers,  to  our  knowledge,  consider  the  effects  of  current  and  past  body  mass  on  current
4:122:8193:15:12:72:540:105:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:earnings (Chen, 2012; Pinkston, 2015).  Chen includes body mass from a decade prior and Pinkston includes
4:123:8298:12:12:72:540:93:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:body mass from one year ago.  Pinkston’s use of lagged wages to explain current wages and twice lagged
4:124:8400:12:8:72:369:81:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:wages as instruments allows for indirect life-cycle body mass effects.
4:125:8470:8:16:85:539:73:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:3Han, et al.  (2011) find an indirect wage penalty of body weight in one’s late teens through its effect on
4:126:8577:16:0:72:358:57:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:education and occupation outcomes measured in the late thirties.
5:127:8642:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mass on wages; we do not differentiate between individual productivity, employer preference,
5:128:8734:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:or employer discrimination as explanations for the contemporaneous effect.  Admittedly, they
5:129:8826:22:22:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:each may partially explain the current market value (i.e., wage), or marginal productivity,
5:130:8917:22:22:72:190:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of an individual’s time.
5:131:8941:22:22:100:540:620:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our contribution is the careful, quantifiable distinction between the wage effects of body
5:132:9031:22:22:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mass characterized by life-cycle human capital differences (i.e., the indirect or dynamic effect)
5:133:9128:22:22:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and those reflecting additional differences in current valuations of market work (i.e., the direct
5:134:9226:22:22:72:540:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:or  contemporaneous  effect).   To  disentangle  these  life-cycle  and  contemporaneous  effects
5:135:9323:22:22:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we  use  a  multiple  equation,  dynamic  empirical  model  to  capture  the  annual  employment
5:136:9419:22:22:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:decisions and wage distribution of women aged 18 to 45 while jointly explaining education,
5:137:9509:22:22:72:466:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:marital, and family size histories, and the evolution of body mass, over time.
5:138:9587:22:21:100:540:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Three potential sources of bias compromise measurement of the role of health capital
5:139:9671:21:22:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(i.e., body mass) in explaining wages: selection, endogeneity, and measurement error.4First,
5:140:9763:22:22:72:540:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:observed wages of employed individuals reflect accepted wage offers, yet we want to measure
5:141:9854:22:22:72:540:401:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the labor market’s valuation of particular individual wage determinants unconditional on the
5:142:9946:22:22:72:540:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:observed employment decision.  Individuals who chose to work in the formal labor market
5:143:10033:22:22:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are a self-selected group:  only those who receive wage offers above an individual reservation
5:144:10127:22:22:72:540:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wage are observed to work.  Estimation using the self-selected sample will result in biased
5:145:10218:22:22:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:coefficients on explanatory variables for wages if non-random selection into employment is
5:146:10308:22:22:72:540:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:not modeled jointly with the observed wages.5Thus, we model non-, part-time, and full-time
5:147:10398:22:22:71:539:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:employment over the life cycle jointly with wages conditional on employment, allowing the
5:148:10487:22:22:71:539:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:observed employment outcome and wages to be correlated through common unobservables.
5:149:10571:22:22:71:539:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Second,  the  human  capital  and  other  productivity  characteristics  that  determine  pay  for
5:150:10669:22:21:71:539:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:work reflect life-cycle decisions of an individual.  These wage determinants include educa-
5:151:10760:21:18:71:539:182:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tional  attainment,  work  experience,  marital  status,  number  of  children  in  household,  and
5:152:10859:18:16:85:539:164:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:4These same biases impact evaluation of human capital and other endogenous wage determinants, which
5:153:10958:16:8:72:145:148:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:we also measure.
5:154:10974:8:16:85:539:140:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:5In addition to the effects of body mass on the wage distribution, the probability of receiving an employ-
5:155:11080:16:12:72:540:124:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:ment offer may be impacted by one’s weight, thus influencing accumulation of work experience over the life
5:156:11186:12:0:72:443:112:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:cycle.  Much of the literature on weight and wages ignores this employment selection.
6:157:11272:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:health (measured by body mass in this paper).  Endogeneity suggests that unobserved char-
6:158:11361:22:22:72:539:686:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:acteristics that explain these (time-varying) decisions may also explain differences in wages.6
6:159:11456:22:22:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Thus,  we use a flexible,  latent factor approach to model the permanent and time-varying
6:160:11545:22:22:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:unobserved heterogeneity (UH) that is correlated with wages and their endogenous deter-
6:161:11632:22:22:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:minants.  Third, the measurement error (i.e., reporting, subjectivity, and rounding errors)
6:162:11723:22:22:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that accompanies self-reported individual-level characteristics (e.g., weight and height) can
6:163:11816:22:22:72:539:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lead to inconsistent estimates.7Our latent factor method that accounts for individual-level
6:164:11907:22:22:72:334:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:unobservables addresses potential attenuation bias.
6:165:11958:22:22:100:540:532:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We extend the literature in several dimensions.  First, we analyze the effects of body
6:166:12044:22:22:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mass  on  wages  using  yearly  observations  on  a  cohort  of  women  followed  for  twenty  con-
6:167:12143:22:22:72:540:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:secutive years (National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) 1979 cohort).  Our research
6:168:12231:22:21:72:540:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sample includes annual observations from the ages of 18-26 in 1983 through the ages of 37-45
6:169:12323:21:22:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in 2002.  These twenty years of data on the same individuals provide a quite comprehensive
6:170:12413:22:22:72:540:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:picture of life changes from young adulthood to middle age.  This point of reference allows
6:171:12504:22:22:72:540:401:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for a better understanding of both body mass and wage dynamics and provides a perspective
6:172:12593:22:22:72:540:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that differs from (repeated) cross-sectional analyses.  We are able to quantify the effects of
6:173:12687:22:22:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(and determinants of) body mass as an individual ages, and broaden the interpretation from
6:174:12777:22:22:72:540:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:one of aggregate time effects to individual behaviors.  Second, we jointly model, along with
6:175:12869:22:22:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the evolution of body mass and wages, several individual behaviors that may be affected by
6:176:12959:22:22:72:540:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:body mass and that also explain observed wage variation.  Hence, we are able to decompose
6:177:13048:22:22:72:540:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the correlation between body mass and wages reported in the literature into life-cycle effects
6:178:13142:22:22:72:540:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:captured through human capital variables and contemporaneous (direct) influences.  Third,
6:179:13231:22:22:72:540:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we apply dynamic estimation techniques that go beyond traditional methods to better cap-
6:180:13319:22:17:72:540:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ture  impacts  of  interest  over  time  and  across  the  impacted  distribution  and  to  eliminate
6:181:13420:17:16:85:539:186:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:6For example, a permanent individual trait that may affect both body mass and wages (conditional on
6:182:13519:16:12:72:540:170:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:body mass) is self-confidence, which is often unobserved in survey data.  Although used infrequently in this
6:183:13627:12:12:72:540:158:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:literature,  first-differenced  methods  and  panel  data  can  address  endogeneity  that  may  bias  the  measured
6:184:13743:12:12:72:540:146:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:weight/wage relationship.  Receiving even less attention has been the role of time-varying unobservables that
6:185:13852:12:12:72:540:134:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:affect both body mass and employment or wages.  For example, an unobserved temporary negative health
6:186:13952:12:12:72:540:122:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:event (e.g., a broken leg) may lead to weight gain as well as a reduction in observed wages if the researcher
6:187:14061:12:8:72:487:110:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:cannot fully account for accumulation (or depreciation) of human capital (e.g., work absences).
6:188:14156:8:16:85:539:102:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:7There is evidence in the literature that women understate their weight (Lakdawalla and Philipson, 2002;
6:189:14260:16:12:72:540:86:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Chen, 2012).  Some authors in this literature have re-scaled self-reported height and weight following Cawley
6:190:14369:12:0:72:458:74:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:(2004); others have used different measures of adiposity (Burkhauser and Cawley, 2008).
7:191:14457:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:bias in both the observed and unobserved dimensions.  More specifically, we make few dis-
7:192:14546:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tributional assumptions about the jointly-correlated unobservables; rather, we discretize the
7:193:14639:22:22:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:distributions and estimate the event-specific impacts, mass points, and weights of these un-
7:194:14731:22:22:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:observed  factors  using  a  flexible,  discrete  factor  random  effects  method.   We  also  seek  to
7:195:14834:22:22:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:understand the impact of body mass on the full support of wages, not just the first moment.
7:196:14925:22:22:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:That is, we allow body mass (and other variables) to influence wages differently at different
7:197:15018:22:22:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:points  of  support  of  the  wage  distribution  by  modeling  the  density  of  wages  without  im-
7:198:15119:22:22:72:540:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:posing a distributional assumption.  Similarly, we allow determinants of body mass to have
7:199:15209:22:22:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:different effects at different points of the support of the body mass distribution.  We estimate
7:200:15305:22:22:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the conditional densities for wages and body mass jointly with endogenous behaviors that
7:201:15393:22:22:72:540:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:determine both wages and body mass, allowing permanent and time-varying observed and
7:202:15477:22:21:72:318:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:unobserved heterogeneity to affect all outcomes.
7:203:15525:21:22:100:540:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Using  our  research  sample  consisting  of  twenty  years  of  annual  observations  on  the
7:204:15619:22:22:72:540:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:same individuals, we have replicated, with similar specifications and estimation techniques,
7:205:15711:22:22:72:540:401:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the results in the literature.  The biased findings suggest that current body mass, measured
7:206:15803:22:22:72:540:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:by the conventional body mass index (BMI), has a statistically significant negative effect on
7:207:15896:22:22:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the current wages of white women.  We find a smaller, but statistically significant effect on
7:208:15989:22:22:72:540:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  wages  of  black  women  in  the  most  sparse  specifications.   When  we  take  advantage  of
7:209:16089:22:22:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the longitudinal nature of the data, and estimate a model with fixed individual effects, the
7:210:16181:22:22:72:540:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:upwardly-biased significant effect of BMI on wages of white women falls, but is still signifi-
7:211:16275:22:22:72:540:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cant.  The effect for black women in a model that allows for permanent individual unobserved
7:212:16367:22:22:72:540:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:heterogeneity actually reverses signs.  We move beyond the standard approaches in the liter-
7:213:16459:22:22:72:540:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ature to jointly estimate 17 equations that capture the dynamic life-cycle behavior described
7:214:16552:22:21:72:540:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:above and that allow for selection into employment, endogeneity of several determinants of
7:215:16642:21:22:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wages, and measurement error.  Here, calculation of the marginal effect of BMI on wages is
7:216:16732:22:22:72:540:160:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:not so straightforward because of its contemporaneous and life-cycle effects captured by the
7:217:16824:22:22:72:540:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dynamic model.  We quantify those marginal effects through simulation using the estimated
7:218:16913:22:22:72:540:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:model.  We find a different effect of BMI at different levels of wages, which is captured by the
7:219:17009:22:22:72:540:94:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:conditional density estimation procedure.  More specifically, the impact of a contemporane-
7:220:17100:22:0:72:540:72:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ous improvement in body mass on wages of white women is positive and increases over the
8:221:17188:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:support of the distribution of wages.  That is, the largest impacts occur at the highest deciles
8:222:17284:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of wages.  For black women, the contemporaneous weight-related wage penalty is smaller and
8:223:17374:22:22:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is actually negative at lower wages,  yet approaches that of white women at higher wages.
8:224:17463:22:22:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:When we account for the impact of better health (i.e., a lower body mass) over the life cycle
8:225:17556:22:22:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on  other  determinants  of  wages,  we  find  that  the  total  effect  on  wages  is  slightly  smaller
8:226:17661:22:22:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:than that implied by the contemporaneous effect.  The life-cycle impact of body mass (which
8:227:17752:22:22:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:includes the contemporaneous effect) is significantly different from zero for all women over
8:228:17844:22:57:72:182:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the support of wages.

8:230:17901:33:22:72:540:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The economics literature examining wage determinants and wage disparities is large.  Rather
8:231:17992:22:22:72:540:442:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:than discuss this literature, we focus on research that explores the impact of health on wages,
8:232:18087:22:22:72:540:420:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with  health  specifically  measured  by  body  mass.   We  also  briefly  discuss  the  relationship
8:233:18188:22:22:72:540:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:between body mass and other determinants of employment and wages (Cawley and Ruhm,

8:247:19335:22:0:72:540:57:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:less productivity due to health problems from obesity (measured by health limitations), less

9:249:19523:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:distaste for obese employees due to high health care cost (measured by employer provision
9:250:19612:22:22:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of health insurance), and consumer distaste for obese workers (measured by classification of
9:251:19704:22:22:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:occupation as customer-related).  Bhattacharya and Bundorf (2004) report no statistically

9:253:19883:22:22:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:health insurance coverage.  Carpenter (2006) shows that the employment rate increased four
9:254:19973:22:22:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:percent for obese women and two percent for obese men compared to their respective non-
9:255:20060:22:22:72:540:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:obese counterparts after a 1993 court case (Cook vs. Rhode Island) in which a federal appeals
9:256:20153:22:22:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:court ruled that obesity is covered under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans

9:259:20423:22:21:72:540:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:skills.  Han, Norton, and Powell (2009) examine the direct effect of body mass on wages and
9:260:20514:21:22:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the indirect effects operating through education and occupation choice.  They find that body

9:262:20701:22:22:72:540:401:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:outcomes of men and women, which in turn have significant effects on wages.  The 11 percent

9:264:20882:22:22:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the effect of body mass on human capital accumulation.  While almost all empirical work

9:266:21060:22:22:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:endogeneity of body mass, Johar and Katayama (2012) use quantile regression to assess the
9:267:21149:22:22:72:540:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:role of body mass at different wage levels.  They find that the body mass wage penalty is
9:268:21238:22:22:72:471:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:larger at higher wages for white women and at median wages for white males.

10:288:22961:22:22:72:540:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:current BMI is not a valid instrument if there is any serial or inter-temporal correlation in
10:289:23054:22:22:72:540:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the wage residuals.  Likewise, children’s body weight is not a valid instrument if unobserved

12:347:28108:22:22:71:539:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mass can be measured by percentage of body fat (using skinfold, underwater weighing, or
12:348:28195:22:22:71:539:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fat-free mass techniques) or by measures that account for mass and volume location (waist
12:349:28284:22:22:71:539:437:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and arm circumference and the body volume index).  Johansson,  et al.  (2009) and Wada
12:350:28370:22:22:71:539:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and  Tekin (2010) show  that the  measure  of adiposity  affects analysis  of  the obesity wage
12:351:28465:22:22:71:539:393:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:penalty.  Burkhauser and Cawley (2008) find that obesity measured by BMI is only weakly
12:352:28552:22:22:71:539:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:correlated with obesity defined by other measures of fatness.  Unfortunately, however, many
12:353:28643:22:22:71:539:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:data sets that contain information on employment and wages contain only measures of height
12:354:28733:22:22:71:539:327:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and weight that can be used to construct the body mass index.  Another concern is that
12:355:28819:22:22:71:539:305:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the data on height and weight are often self-reported.  These self-reports are likely to suffer
12:356:28914:22:22:71:539:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:from reporting error, subjectivity error, and rounding error.  Because it is necessary for us
12:357:29007:22:21:71:539:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to rely on the traditional BMI index to measure adiposity, we use an estimation technique
12:358:29096:21:58:71:301:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that addresses potential measurement errors.

12:360:29177:34:22:71:539:148:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The  National  Longitudinal  Survey  of  Youth  (NLSY)  provides  data  on  a  1979  cohort  of
12:361:29272:22:22:71:539:126:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:12,686 individuals aged 14 to 22 followed annually through 1994.  These individuals continue
12:362:29364:22:18:71:539:104:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to be followed every two years after 1996 (with data available currently through 2012).  Our
12:363:29456:18:16:85:539:86:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:9Specifially, BMI equals weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.  A BMI less than or
12:364:29557:16:12:72:540:70:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:equal to 18.5 indicates underweight; between 18.5 and 25, normal weight; greater than or equal to 25 and
12:365:29661:12:0:72:290:58:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:less than 30, overweight; and 30 or greater, obese.
13:366:29714:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:research sample includes those who have not attrited by 1983 and who have responses for
13:367:29801:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:important variables in our analysis.  Because the literature on the relationship between body
13:368:29894:22:22:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mass  and  wages  has  detected  a  wage  effect  that  differs  between  black  and  white  females,

13:399:30866:46:15:81:539:113:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:10We restrict the initial 1983 sample to include individuals who are observed for at least two consecutive
13:400:30972:15:12:72:540:98:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:periods.   Hence,  attrition  does  not  occur  between  1983  and  1984.   In  fact,  the  1983  data  serve  as  initial
13:401:31094:12:12:72:540:86:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:conditions for the subsequent period of observation.  Additionally, we have no need to model attrition at the
13:402:31203:12:0:72:324:74:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:end of 2002 since this is the last year of data that we use.
14:403:31265:0:22:100:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The NLSY data provide a unique understanding of individual body mass dynamics over
14:404:31347:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:time because the survey follows the same individuals for such a long time (e.g., over 20 years
14:405:31441:22:22:72:539:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in some cases) relative to most data sets.11Since the evolution of body mass as individuals
14:406:31532:22:22:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:age  is  important  in  this  study,  we  depict  the  trends  in  body  mass  over  time  in  Figure  1.
14:407:31637:22:22:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Average body mass increases by age for women of both races, with the mean increasing from
14:408:31726:22:22:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:21.5 and 22.7 at age 20 to 25.9 and 29.8 at age 40, for white and black females respectively.
14:409:31819:22:22:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:More importantly, the value of the 75th percentile of the BMI distribution is increasing and
14:410:31911:22:22:72:540:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the right tail of the distribution is larger as individuals age.  .12Across all ages, one-year
14:411:32005:22:22:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:body mass deviations (not pictured) average 0.21 and 0.32 BMI units for white and black
14:412:32092:22:22:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:females respectively.  For an average height female (i.e., 5’ 4”), this amounts to an increase
14:413:32186:22:22:72:540:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of 1.2 to 1.9 pounds per year.  Despite the fact that much of the interquartile range of BMI
14:414:32278:22:21:72:540:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:deviations from one year to another lies above zero at each age, the median BMI deviation
14:415:32367:21:22:72:108:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is zero.
14:416:32375:22:22:100:540:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Since we intend to explore how wages vary with body mass, we emphasize that body
14:417:32455:22:22:72:540:401:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mass increases with age, on average, in the 18 to 45 year age range.  It is also the case that
14:418:32549:22:22:72:540:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the strongest predictors of wages — education and work experience — also increase with age.
14:419:32640:22:22:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In general, while additional education may be obtained at any age, it is often completed in
14:420:32731:22:22:72:540:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the early twenties.  Work experience, however, accumulates over the life cycle.  If individuals
14:421:32826:22:22:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:gain weight as they age,  but are also gaining work experience as they age,  a depiction of
14:422:32917:22:22:72:540:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wages by age will almost surely reveal that those with larger body mass also have higher
14:423:33005:22:22:72:540:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wages.   Hence,  it  is  important  to  control  for  human  capital  variables  (i.e.,  education  and
14:424:33108:22:22:72:540:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:work experience) that increase with age, as well as other cumulative variables that influence
14:425:33201:22:22:72:540:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:productivity (i.e., marital status and tenure, number of children in the household, and body
14:426:33293:22:18:72:540:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mass).  Because these important wage determinants may be influenced by body mass and,
14:427:33378:18:16:81:539:185:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:11Weight and height are observed in the NLSY79 data in most years with the exception of 1983, 1984,
14:428:33477:16:12:72:540:169:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:1991, and the non-survey years of 1995, 1997, 1999, and 2001.  We linearly interpolate or extrapolate values
14:429:33585:12:12:72:540:157:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:of weight in years that we do not observe weight.  We assume that height is the same across all years an
14:430:33689:12:12:72:540:145:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:individual is observed.  Using these height and weight values,  we construct the body mass index for each

17:454:35678:22:22:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:marriage dissolution, removal, and matriculation.  In addition to the effects children in the
17:455:35771:22:22:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:household may have on employment behavior and productivity, children may impact body
17:456:35855:22:22:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mass of the parents.  Most obviously, childbearing imposes physical changes in a woman’s
17:457:35943:22:22:72:540:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:body mass that may not be temporary.  Additionally, children impose both time and finan-
17:458:36031:22:22:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cial requirements that may alter caloric intake and expenditure of their caregivers.  Figure 3

18:462:36297:0:34:72:283:708:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:4  Empirical Framework
18:463:36319:34:22:72:540:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our  empirical  framework  is  motivated  by  a  theoretical  model  of  life-cycle  decisionmaking
18:464:36418:22:22:72:540:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and  health  production:  per-period  decisions  regarding  education,  employment,  marriage,
18:465:36512:22:22:72:540:630:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and children with uncertain future wages and body mass transitions.  The theory allows us
18:466:36601:22:22:72:540:608:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to  derive choice  probabilities  that we approximate  using dynamic,  non-linear  functions  of
18:467:36697:22:22:72:540:586:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the information available (to an individual) at the beginning of each decisionmaking period.
18:468:36789:22:22:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The  theory  also  describes  how  these  period-by-period  decisions  affect  the  production  of
18:469:36887:22:22:72:540:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:health  (or  evolution  of  body  mass)  over  time  and  the  implied  distribution  of  wages.   We
18:470:36988:22:22:72:540:520:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:then  estimate  the  approximated  demand  and  production  equations  jointly,  and  allow  for
18:471:37084:22:21:72:540:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:both  permanent  and  time-varying  individual  unobserved  heterogeneity  (UH)  through  the
18:472:37177:21:22:72:540:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:use of discrete factor random effects (Heckman and Singer, 1983 and Mroz, 1999).  Rather
18:473:37265:22:22:72:540:455:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:than estimate the conditional mean of wages and body mass, we estimate the conditional
18:474:37351:22:22:72:540:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:density of these observed outcomes using a conditional density estimation (CDE) technique
18:475:37440:22:22:72:211:411:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(Gilleskie and Mroz, 2004).
18:476:37467:22:22:100:540:389:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This multi-faceted empirical approach enables us to consider aspects of the problem
18:477:37550:22:22:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that may not be computationally-feasible with full-solution and estimation of the dynamic
18:478:37639:22:22:72:540:345:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:optimization problem.  We 1.)  include several endogenous explanatory variables that provide
18:479:37731:22:22:72:540:323:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a detailed description of the histories of individual decisions over the life cycle, 2.)  consider
18:480:37829:22:22:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the continuous evolution of body mass rather than discrete categories, and 3.)  explore the
18:481:37920:22:22:72:540:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:possibility that variables of interest may have different marginal effects at different points of
18:482:38017:22:22:72:540:257:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:support of the wage and body mass distributions.  We seek to evaluate the causal pathways
18:483:38106:22:21:72:540:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of body mass on wages of women (either directly or indirectly through other life-cycle de-
18:484:38196:21:22:72:540:214:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:terminants) and to distinguish the contemporaneous effect from that generated by life-cycle
18:485:38287:22:0:72:254:192:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:behaviors influenced by body mass.
19:486:38323:0:30:72:259:708:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:4.1  Timing and Notation
19:487:38347:30:22:72:540:678:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In each yeartafter age 18, an individual obtains a wage offer drawn from the population
19:488:38434:22:22:72:539:656:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:distribution of wages.  The individual also observes her spouse’s wage if married.14The wage
19:489:38526:22:22:72:539:634:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a female would receive if she worked,wt, depends on education and employment experience,
19:490:38614:22:22:71:539:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:as described by Mincer (1974).  We argue that these human capital variables may not fully
19:491:38703:22:22:71:539:590:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:capture a person’s productivity at work.  Her productivity, or effort, might be influenced by
19:492:38796:22:22:71:539:568:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:her health or her time demands.  Thus, we include body mass (Cawley, 2004), marital status
19:493:38886:22:22:71:539:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f8:(Korenman and Neumark, 1991), and number of children in the household entering periodt
19:494:38972:22:21:72:290:524:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:as determinants of the wage distribution.15
19:495:39015:21:22:100:540:503:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Each period the individual then jointly decides 1.)  whether or not to attend school,
19:496:39100:22:22:71:539:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2.)  whether to be non-employed, part-time employed, or full-time employed, 3.)  whether or
19:497:39191:22:22:71:539:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:not to be married, and 4.)  whether or not to acquire (or lose) a child (or children) living
19:498:39283:22:22:71:539:437:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in the household.  We let indicator variables (lower case) define the alternatives.  That is,
19:499:39376:22:22:71:539:415:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:st= 1 if the individual attends school in periodtandst= 0, otherwise.  The employment
19:500:39461:22:22:72:540:393:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:indicator takes on the valueet= 0 if the individual does not work in periodt,et= 1 if he
19:501:39549:22:22:72:540:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:works part time (less than 1375 hours per year), andet= 2 if he works full time (1375 hours
19:502:39640:22:22:72:539:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:or more per year).  We indicate the marriage decision bymt= 1 if the individual is married
19:503:39730:22:22:72:540:327:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in yeart, andmt= 0, otherwise.  The number of children in the household may increase or
19:504:39817:22:22:72:540:305:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:decrease due to pregnancy (singleton or multiples), marriage, divorce, age of child, or child
19:505:39910:22:17:72:539:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mortality.16The variablekt= 0 indicates that there is no change in the number of children
19:506:39999:17:16:81:539:266:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:14Spouse income is treated as exogenous.  While we model the marriage decision, which may be influenced
19:507:40102:16:12:72:540:250:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:by body mass, we do not model the correlation between an individual’s body mass and her potential spouse’s
19:508:40208:12:8:72:214:238:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:income (Chiappori, et al., 2012).
19:509:40241:8:16:81:539:230:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:15We recognize that body mass is an imperfect measure of health, and may not fully capture the role that
19:510:40345:16:12:72:540:214:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:health plays in one’s productivity.  Instead, or additionally, it may signal expected medical care expenditures
19:511:40456:12:12:72:540:202:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:(which may be compensated by the employer and hence affect offered wages) or reflect an employer’s tastes
19:512:40561:12:8:72:379:190:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:based on appearance.  We cannot distinguish these roles in estimation.
19:513:40631:8:16:81:539:182:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:16Some reasons for a change in number of children in the household are available in the data.  For example,
19:514:40738:16:12:72:540:166:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the  survey  records  whether  a  child  was  born,  died,  was  adopted,  etc.   Additionally,  a  comparison  of  the
19:515:40857:12:12:72:540:154:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:number of children in the household from year to year reveals additions and losses of more than one child in
19:516:40965:12:12:72:540:142:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:a non-trivial number of cases.  The changes could be due to birth by the sample female as well as children
19:517:41071:12:12:72:540:130:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:acquired (or lost) through other channels (e.g., adoption, marriage, divorce, aging out, and death).  Because
19:518:41180:12:11:72:540:118:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:of the large number of ways household size can change,  we are motivated to focus only on the change in
19:519:41283:11:12:72:540:107:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:number of children in the household rather than the channel.  A larger household size, regardless of channel,
19:520:41392:12:0:72:477:95:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:places demands on time, finances, and energy, which may impact per-period decisionmaking.
20:521:41483:0:22:72:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in the household in yeart, and values ofkt= 1 andkt=−1 indicate that at least one child
20:522:41570:22:22:72:213:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is acquired or lost in yeart.
20:523:41599:22:22:100:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:These yearly decisions (i.e.,  school attendance,  employment,  marriage,  and children)
20:524:41687:22:22:72:539:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:produce stock variables upon entering periodtthat summarize the history of the decisions.
20:525:41776:22:22:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The vectors of these history variables (upper case) are denoted:  educational history (St),
20:526:41867:22:22:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:work experience (Et), marital history (Mt), and household child accumulation (Kt).  These
20:527:41956:22:22:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:vectors  include  both  duration  values  as  well  as  indicators  of  behavior  or  outcomes  in  the
20:528:42059:22:22:72:539:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f8:last period (t−1) and polynomials of the continuous values.  These histories up to periodt

20:530:42241:22:22:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We allow the vector of variables that capture body mass history up to the beginning of a

20:532:42419:22:21:71:119:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:decisions.

20:539:42979:22:22:72:539:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:unique  superscripts  to  denote,  for  descriptive  purposes  only,  the  variables  inPtthat  are
20:540:43078:22:22:72:539:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:related to particular endogenous behaviors and outcomes; that is,Pt= (PSt,PEt,PMt,PKt,
20:541:43164:22:22:72:540:269:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:PBt).  We recognize, however, that the optimal demand functions for each behavior may de-
20:542:43253:22:22:72:540:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:pend on own and cross prices.  The vector of individual information known at the beginning

20:544:43391:22:21:100:540:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:As forward-looking decisionmakers, the individuals face uncertainty about future wages.

20:546:43574:22:22:72:540:160:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ries.  In addition to these human capital variables, wages may also be influenced by body
20:547:43663:22:22:72:540:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mass,  which explains variation in wages caused by health impacts on productivity or em-
20:548:43751:22:18:72:540:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ployer preferences about appearance.  Future body mass is also uncertain.  Having made the
20:549:43841:18:16:81:539:98:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:17We are not explicit about how these variables may impact preferences or the budget constraint because
20:550:43944:16:12:72:540:82:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:we do not estimate the primitive parameters of the decisionmaking optimization problem.  However, these
20:551:44047:12:12:72:540:70:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:variables, because they are a part of the information set when evaluating alternatives, are arguments of the
20:552:44155:12:0:72:322:58:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:non-linear demand functions resulting from optimization.

22:602:46312:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:purposes.  We also use time-varying indicators of ever overweight or ever obese to capture

28:826:59239:18:16:81:539:124:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:20Theory suggests that non-earned income (including spouse income where marital status is modeled as
28:827:59339:16:12:72:540:108:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:endogenous) and earned income (e.g., wages which are modeled as endogenous) should be included in the
28:828:59440:12:12:72:540:96:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:body mass evolution equation since the determinants of caloric intake and expenditure include one’s income.
28:829:59547:12:12:72:540:84:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:However,  we  found  the  total  household  income  measures  in  the  NLSY  to  be  fairly  noisy  and  frequently

29:833:59860:30:22:72:540:678:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Theory  states  that  individuals  receive  a  wage  offer  each  period  and,  conditional  on  this
29:834:59961:22:22:72:540:656:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wage, they evaluate the value of each set of alternative behaviors and choose the one that
29:835:60051:22:22:72:540:634:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:maximizes their discounted lifetime utility.  Future wages are uncertain, so individuals must
29:836:60144:22:22:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:evaluate future utility unconditional on future wages (i.e., integrate over the distribution of
29:837:60239:22:22:72:540:590:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wages).  Empirically, we (the econometricians) do not observe wage offers.  We only observe
29:838:60330:22:22:72:540:568:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:her  accepted  wage,  conditional  on  choosing  employment  in  periodt.   It  is  appropriate  to

29:840:60531:22:21:72:540:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:conditional wage distribution by modeling the UH that impacts selection into employment
29:841:60618:21:22:72:540:503:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(Equation 2) as well as wages.  According to Mincer’s seminal work, wages are a function of
29:842:60709:22:22:72:540:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:observed human capital, typically captured by educational attainment and work experience.
29:843:60798:22:22:72:540:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Wages may also vary by productivity differences at the same levels of education and expe-
29:844:60887:22:22:72:540:437:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rience.  Productivity is generally not observed, and certainly difficult to measure.  We might
29:845:60981:22:22:72:540:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:imagine that productivity is influenced by employee characteristics as well as employer or
29:846:61071:22:22:72:539:393:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:job characteristics.21In particular, we allow productivity at work to differ by an employee’s
29:847:61164:22:22:71:539:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:marital status and number of children in the household.  Productivity may also be influenced
29:848:61256:22:22:71:539:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:by one’s physical health; our only health measure is body mass.  Significance of variation in
29:849:61349:22:22:71:510:327:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:body mass in explaining variation in wages may also reflect preferences by employers.
29:850:61434:22:22:100:540:305:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:For these reasons our periodtwage equation includes variables summarizing the his-
29:851:61516:22:22:72:540:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tory of education,  employment,  marriage,  and children as well as body mass entering the
29:852:61606:22:21:72:540:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:current period.  Each of these variables is endogenous, and we address potential bias stem-
29:853:61697:21:22:72:540:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ming from the endogeniety of these wage determinants by modeling the UH that impacts the
29:854:61785:22:22:72:540:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:determinants (Equations 1-5) as well as the wages.  We also include as wage determinants
29:855:61873:22:22:72:540:196:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:characteristics  of  the  demand-side  of  the  employment  market  at  the  state  level  (denoted
29:856:61972:22:22:72:540:174:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:PEt), aggregate trends (captured by a cubic function of the continuous year variable), and

29:858:62155:18:16:81:539:134:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:21We observe an individual’s occupation if she works, but few other employer characteristics.  We could
29:859:62258:16:11:72:540:118:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:model occupational choice and include occupation indicators in the wage equation.  Because this would add
29:860:62363:11:12:72:540:107:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:a large multinomial choice equation and many parameters, we do not jointly model occupation.  We also do
29:861:62467:12:12:72:540:95:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:not include occupation indicators and treat them as exogenous.  Rather, theory tells us that the occupation
29:862:62574:12:12:72:540:83:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:demand  function  is  a  function  of  the  same  variables  that  determine  each  of  the  jointly  chosen  behaviors
29:863:62693:12:12:72:540:71:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:that we do model.  Hence, we assume that the endogenous human capital and productivity histories explain
29:864:62797:12:0:72:122:59:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:occupation.
30:865:62810:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:time.  If we wished to explain how the mean of the wage distribution varied by its determi-
30:866:62901:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nants, we could estimate log wages conditional on being employed as is typical in the labor
30:867:62992:22:22:72:539:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:literature.  That is, observed log wages in periodt, conditional on being employed in period

30:872:63363:22:49:72:265:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(explained in the next section below).
30:873:63401:49:29:72:517:481:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:4.5  Conditional Density Estimation of Wages and Body Mass
30:874:63459:29:22:72:540:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:As explained above, future wages and body mass are uncertain when individuals are making
30:875:63547:22:22:72:539:430:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:their  periodtdecisions.   Thus,  we  seek  to  estimate  the  marginal  effects  of  theoretically-
30:876:63647:22:22:72:540:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relevant variables on the density of these outcomes rather than simply the first moment, or
30:877:63738:22:22:72:540:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:expected value.  To do so, we estimate the density of wages (and of body mass) conditional on
30:878:63831:22:22:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:observable and unobservable variables.  We use the conditional density estimation technique
30:879:63922:22:22:72:540:342:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(Gilleskie and Mroz, 2004), which allows the effect of an explanatory variable to be different
30:880:64016:22:22:72:417:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:at different points of support of the wage (body mass) distribution.
30:881:64084:22:22:100:540:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Specifically, we begin by splitting the sample observations intoKintervals.  That is, we
30:882:64172:22:22:72:540:276:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:discretize the support of the dependent variable.  We do this by choosing boundary points
30:883:64261:22:22:72:539:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that  place  an  equal  number  of  observations  in  each  interval  (i.e.,1kth  of  the  sample  falls

31:920:65503:19:15:81:539:89:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:22Note that it is important to estimate the employment outcome jointly with the conditional density of
31:921:65605:15:12:72:540:74:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:wages (as we do) in order to account for selection that may bias the estimated marginal effects of explanatory
31:922:65715:12:0:72:404:62:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:variables when we only observe the accepted wages of employed individuals.
32:923:65791:0:22:100:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:It  remains  to  estimate  the  conditional  hazard,λ(k,x).   First,  we  replicate  each  of
32:924:65884:22:22:72:539:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the person-year observationsK−1 times.  We then define a dependent variable indicating
32:925:65970:22:22:72:539:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:whether or not the wage of a particular person in yeartfalls into each of theK−1 intervals.
32:926:66061:22:22:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(The indicator is undefined for intervals greater than the observed wage.)  We know that the
32:927:66153:22:22:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:unconditional probability of an observed wage being in thekth interval given that it is not

32:932:66482:13:17:375:540:549:8:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:1+eik, gives us the unconditional
32:933:66515:17:22:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:probability of the observed wage being in thekth interval (given that it is not in a previous
32:934:66608:22:22:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:interval) exactly because of the way we have defined the interval counter transformation.  To
32:935:66701:22:22:72:539:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:estimate the conditional hazard (i.e., conditional on variablesx), we interact the transformed
32:936:66795:22:21:72:437:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:interval counter (i.e., the variableik) fully with the wage determinants.
32:937:66868:21:22:100:540:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The hazards for wages and body mass are jointly estimated with other equations in

32:942:67310:22:22:72:540:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the explanatory variables on the mean wage (body mass) account for differences in effects

32:945:67516:30:22:72:540:234:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In order to correctly estimate the distribution of permanent and time-varying UH, we must
32:946:67605:22:21:72:540:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:account for the fact that individuals attrit from our research sample over time.  We include,
32:947:67698:21:22:72:540:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in the jointly estimated set of equations, an equation for the probability of attrition at the
32:948:67792:22:22:72:540:169:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:end  of  the  period.   This  probability  depends  on  updated  history  variables,  reflecting  the
32:949:67893:22:22:72:232:147:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:periodtdecisions, and the UH.
32:950:67922:22:22:100:540:125:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our analysis of individual behavior begins in 1984 when some of the endogenous vari-
32:951:68006:22:22:72:540:103:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ables are non-zero.  We cannot explain the variation in these observed initial conditions using
32:952:68101:22:22:72:540:81:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the dynamic specification of behaviors described above because we do not model the history
32:953:68191:22:0:72:540:59:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of one’s decisions prior to 1984 (i.e.,  we have restricted the model to  explaining behavior
33:954:68286:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:after  age  18).   For  this  reason  we  specify  reduced-form  equations  that  depend  on  exoge-

33:956:68485:22:22:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:outcomes (conditional on the endogenous history variables).  These initial condition equa-
33:957:68575:22:22:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tions are jointly estimated with the subsequent dynamic demand and outcome equations and

33:965:69332:22:21:72:540:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:these initial conditions is achieved by inclusion of exogenous time-varying variables (Ptwhen

34:1004:71935:22:22:72:540:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for white women and a $0.12 increase in the hourly wages of black women, where increases
34:1005:72023:22:22:72:540:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for  black  women  are  statistically  significant.24Put  differently,  a  five  percent  decrease  in
34:1006:72125:22:22:72:540:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:BMI (i.e.,  equivalent to about a seven pound annual weight loss for a 5’ 4” female) leads
34:1007:72215:22:22:72:540:199:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to an $0.11 increase in hourly wages for white females and a $0.02 increase in hourly wages
34:1008:72306:22:22:72:540:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for  black  females.25When  we  include  (in  Model  2)  variables  representing  human  capital
34:1009:72402:22:22:72:540:155:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(but  treat  them  as  exogenous),  the  marginal  effect  of  moving  from  overweight  to  normal
34:1010:72501:22:18:72:540:133:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:weight is a $0.27 and $0.14 increase in wages, respectively.  (A five percent decrease in BMI
34:1011:72594:18:16:81:539:115:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:24If we do not control for deviations from the mean BMI by race, BMI impacts on wages are statistically
34:1012:72697:16:8:72:458:99:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:significant for both races (as the literature reports with this simple biased specification).
34:1013:72790:8:16:81:539:91:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:25To  report  marginal  effects  in  level  dollars  we  transform  from  logs  to  levels  assuming  normality  and

35:1015:72948:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:results in an estimated $0.09 and $0.04 increase, respectively.)  When we control for demand

35:1017:73130:22:22:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:latter two cases, the impact of body mass on the wages of white and black women are less
35:1018:73218:22:22:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:precisely estimated.  Model 4 of Table 6 presents the estimates and marginal effects when
35:1019:73307:22:22:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the model is estimated with individual fixed effects.  These fixed effects purge the coefficient

35:1021:73490:22:22:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wages and body mass (as well as education, work experience, marriage, and children).  The
35:1022:73579:22:22:72:540:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:resulting marginal effect of body mass on wages of white women is much smaller ($0.07) and
35:1023:73669:22:22:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is significantly estimated at the one percent level.  The effect of a reduction in weight on
35:1024:73761:22:22:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wages of black women becomes negative, costing $0.05 (for a reduction from overweight to
35:1025:73849:22:22:72:539:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:normal weight).26We find that the large reduction in impact after controlling for permanent
35:1026:73940:22:21:71:539:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:heterogeneity is consistent with the literature.  However, the results after introduction of a
35:1027:74034:21:22:71:539:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:variable to capture deviation from the average BMI of individuals of one’s same race suggest
35:1028:74126:22:22:71:348:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that these smaller impacts are statistically significant.
35:1029:74183:22:22:100:540:401:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We also calculate the marginal effects using a quantile regression (QR) estimator in or-

35:1031:74367:22:22:71:540:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of wages, as was examined by Johar and Katayama (2012).27Displayed in Table 7, we find
35:1032:74453:22:22:71:539:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that a reduction from overweight to normal weight among females leads to a smaller average
35:1033:74543:22:22:71:539:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:increase in hourly wages in the bottom quartile of the distribution than in higher quartiles.
35:1034:74636:22:22:71:539:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:On average, the wage increases are $0.26 and $0.15 for white and black women, respectively.
35:1035:74727:22:22:71:539:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:These  findings  are  qualitatively  similar  to  those  of  Johar  and  Katayama;  they  are  larger
35:1036:74828:22:22:71:539:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:because we do not account for the endogeneity of BMI in these exploratory replications with
35:1037:74919:22:22:71:539:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:our data.  The conditional density estimation (CDE) approach is more general and flexible
35:1038:75008:22:21:71:539:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:than the QR approach, and is easier to use in more complicated models that involve correc-

35:1041:75281:22:18:71:539:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wages using the CDE approach, we find average wage effects of the over- to normal-weight
35:1042:75369:18:16:81:539:120:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:26A five percent decrease in weight leads to an increase in wages of white women on $0.02 and a decrease
35:1043:75473:16:8:72:252:104:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:in wages of black women of almost $0.04.
35:1044:75513:8:16:81:539:96:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:27These authors account for the endogeneity of BMI using an IV approach.  They control for, but treat

38:1132:78948:22:21:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Figure 6 and 7, outcomes from our data generating process (i.e., the jointly-estimated wage,
38:1133:79040:21:22:72:540:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:demand, and production equations) with the observed data.  We simulate behavior from the
38:1134:79128:22:22:72:540:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:first period forward, using the simulated values of endogenous explanatory variables updated

38:1136:79307:22:22:72:540:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:model with heterogeneity suggest that the model captures well the dynamics associated with

38:1139:79454:30:21:71:539:396:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Examination of the coefficient estimates is not sufficient for understanding the dynamic role
38:1140:79547:21:22:71:539:375:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of body mass on wages over time.  In order to calculate the contemporaneous and dynamic
38:1141:79634:22:22:71:539:353:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:marginal effects of variables of interest on outcomes of interest, we simulate behavior over
38:1142:79726:22:22:71:539:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:time  using  the  estimated  parameters  on  observed  variables,  the  estimated  distribution  of
38:1143:79825:22:22:71:539:309:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:UH, and assumed distributions of the remaining i.i.d unobservables.  For example, we might
38:1144:79915:22:22:71:539:287:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:desire to know how an improvement in body mass affects wages.  But,  is that a one time
38:1145:80002:22:22:71:539:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:decrease  in  body  mass  at  age  18?   Or  a  decrease  each  year?   And  do  we  care  about  the
38:1146:80103:22:22:71:539:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:average effect on wages over the life cycle, or at age 18, or at age 40?  Any change in body
38:1147:80195:22:18:71:470:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mass at a particular age will have an effect on wages at every subsequent age.
38:1148:80273:18:15:81:539:203:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:28Estimates for the initial conditions equations are available from the authors.  We have verified that the
38:1149:80380:15:12:72:540:188:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:variables we include in the initial condition equations as identifying variables are statistically significant and
38:1150:80494:12:12:72:540:176:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:can be excluded from the main equations conditional on the inclusion of the endogenous variables.  Similarly,
38:1151:80603:12:12:72:540:164:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:to test our exclusions restrictions in the dynamic equations, we have estimated a model where we include
38:1152:80707:12:12:72:540:152:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:variables in equations for which theory suggests they should be excluded.  Tests of statistical significance
38:1153:80815:12:12:72:540:140:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:confirm that these identifying variables can be excluded after conditioning on the endogenous variables that
38:1154:80923:12:8:72:142:128:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:they do explain.
38:1155:80939:8:16:81:539:120:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:29Likelihood ratio tests suggest that a model with six estimated discrete mass points for the permanent UH

41:1161:81483:0:22:100:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Since our goal is to understand the dynamic role of body mass on wages, we focus our
41:1162:81567:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:attention here on understanding these marginal effects, and we encourage the reader to take
41:1163:81658:22:22:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:note of the statistical significance of estimated parameters (available in Tables A1-A6).  Note
41:1164:81753:22:22:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that we report impacts on both the conditional (on employment) and unconditional wage
41:1165:81838:22:22:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:distribution (while also conditioning on observed wage determinants).  First,  we calculate
41:1166:81929:22:22:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the effect of an improvement in body mass from overweight (BMI=27.5) to normal weight
41:1167:82014:22:22:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(BMI=24) on contemporaneous wages.  That is,  if one’s body mass currently was normal
41:1168:82099:22:22:72:540:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:weight rather than overweight (all else equal), how might the hourly wage distribution differ?
41:1169:82193:22:22:72:539:532:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We call this thecontemporaneous  effect.  This effect does not include the effect on human
41:1170:82283:22:22:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:capital  formation  and  accumulation  (which  also  affect  wages  this  year)  of  the  changes  in
41:1171:82384:22:22:72:540:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:evolutionary  body  mass  that  may  have  precipitated  the  current  change.   Figure  8  plots

41:1173:82573:21:22:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:which addresses endogeneity, selection, and measurement error; it also displays the associated
41:1174:82667:22:22:72:540:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:results for a model without UH (dotted lines), which represents biased impacts.  The no UH
41:1175:82757:22:22:72:540:401:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:estimates  reflect  gains  similar  to  those  described  previously  by  our  replications  of  models
41:1176:82860:22:22:72:540:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:used  in  the  literature.   Our  preferred  model  that  includes  UH  suggests  that,  on  average,
41:1177:82961:22:22:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the unbiased contemporaneous wage impacts are smaller; white women experience a $0.07
41:1178:83046:22:22:72:540:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:increase  in  hourly  wages  and  black  women  experience  a  small  decrease  of  $0.02.   These
41:1179:83144:22:22:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:averages reflect increases in wages at all deciles for whites while blacks experience reductions
41:1180:83240:22:22:72:460:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in wages that fall in the first six deciles, but improvements at higher wages.
41:1181:83318:22:22:100:540:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We can compare the contemporaneous effect of body mass on wages with that of human
41:1182:83400:22:22:72:540:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:capital and productivity variables.  One year increases in education lead to contemporaneous
41:1183:83492:22:22:72:540:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:increases in hourly wages of $0.79 and $0.66 for white and black females, respectively.  One
41:1184:83584:22:21:72:540:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:additional  year  of  full  time  employment  experience  leads  to  increases  of  $0.26  and  $0.21,
41:1185:83686:21:22:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:respectively.  The associated reduction of body mass by one BMI point leads to increases in
41:1186:83777:22:22:72:540:160:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:contemporaneous wages of $0.05 for white women and decreases of $0.01 for black women,
41:1187:83863:22:22:72:130:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on average.
41:1188:83874:22:22:100:539:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Now we want to calculate thedynamic effect(or life-cycle effect) of an improvement in
41:1189:83959:22:0:72:540:94:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:body mass from overweight to normal weight.  That is, we simulate schooling, employment,

43:1191:84118:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:marriage, and family size behaviors of individuals if they were normal or overweight through-
43:1192:84211:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:out their lives (ages 18 through 45) and compare the predicted wages for each body mass
43:1193:84298:22:22:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:type each period.  Note that this calculation includes both the change in contemporaneous
43:1194:84387:22:22:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wages (via body mass) as well as the changes in wages caused by the effects of body mass on
43:1195:84478:22:22:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:human capital (via education and experience) and productivity (via marriage and children).
43:1196:84568:22:22:100:540:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Figure 9 depicts the average differences in wages associated with an improvement in
43:1197:84651:22:22:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:body mass at different deciles of the wage distribution contemporaneously (solid line) and
43:1198:84741:22:22:72:540:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:including the indirect, life-cycle impacts (dotted line).  The life-cycle effect for white females
43:1199:84839:22:22:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is an average increase in hourly wages of $0.04.  Black females experience a decline of $0.07
43:1200:84932:22:22:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on  average.   Recall  that  the  contemporaneous  effects  averaged  $0.07  and  $-0.02  for  white
43:1201:85032:22:22:72:540:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and black females, respectively.  These results suggest that the permanent reduction in body
43:1202:85124:22:21:72:540:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mass (from overweight to normal weight) led to changes in human capital and productivity
43:1203:85212:21:22:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:behaviors over the life cycle that generated additional contributions to wages that reflect a
43:1204:85305:22:22:72:540:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:smaller total life-cycle body mass impact.  In general, a weight improvement results in the
43:1205:85396:22:22:72:540:401:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:greatest nominal wage increase for white and black women in the highest deciles of wages.
43:1206:85485:22:22:72:540:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:However, black women are likely to experience a wage reduction in the wage deciles where
43:1207:85573:22:22:72:256:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:they are more likely to be observed.
43:1208:85609:22:22:100:540:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:For comparison, the life-cycle impact of a one year increase in schooling is $1.16 and
43:1209:85695:22:22:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:$1.03  for  white  and  black  women,  respectively  (Figure  9).   Increases  are  larger  at  higher
43:1210:85797:22:22:72:540:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wages.  A one year increase in full-time work experience increases wages by $0.40 and $0.41
43:1211:85888:22:22:72:540:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for white and black women.  The life-cycle effect of aone unitdecrease in BMI on wages, on
43:1212:85978:22:22:71:392:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:average, is $0.04 for white women and $-0.01 for black women.
43:1213:86039:22:22:100:540:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Given our rich model, we can explicitly trace the avenues through which this simulated
43:1214:86125:22:21:71:539:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reduction in body mass suggests differences in the contemporaneous and life-cycle wage ef-
43:1215:86215:21:22:71:539:182:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fects.  We observe in Figure 10 that the marginal effects of a body mass improvement on
43:1216:86302:22:22:71:539:160:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:school attendance by age is positive during typical schooling ages (i.e., under age 28).  The
43:1217:86395:22:22:71:539:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:health improvement increases part-time employment over the life cycle, but reduces full-time
43:1218:86487:22:22:71:539:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:employment (with particularly stronger effects on black women).  Body mass improvements

47:1239:88105:22:22:72:540:473:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:their behavior each year regarding education, employment, marriage, and children, as well
47:1240:88194:22:22:72:540:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:as  body  mass  and  wages.   We  call  this  our  baseline,  which  represents  the  wage  outcomes
47:1241:88294:22:22:72:540:429:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:associated with endogenous behaviors and body mass evolution over the life cycle.  We then
47:1242:88384:22:22:72:540:407:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:force a body mass trajectory on each replicated individual.  For example, we may force the
47:1243:88474:22:22:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:individual to be normal weight over the age range (e.g., age 18 to 45).  Table 10 describes
47:1244:88565:22:22:72:540:363:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the differences in average wages and total earnings over the ages of 25 through 40 for each
47:1245:88656:22:22:72:271:341:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the imposed body mass trajectories.
47:1246:88694:22:22:100:540:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In the baseline model simulation, body mass and behaviors are determined by the model

47:1254:89426:15:12:72:540:154:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:trajectory.  These epidemiologists identify four trajectory groups:  normal weight, overweight, late adulthood
47:1255:89536:12:12:72:540:142:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:obesity, and early adulthood obesity.  Grouping individuals together by gender, race, and cohort, they report
47:1256:89645:12:12:72:540:130:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:membership rates of 35.0, 41.2, 19.7, and 4.2 percent for the four trajectory groupings, respectively.  Males,
47:1257:89755:12:12:72:540:118:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:blacks  and  those  in  the  younger  age  cohort  (aged  18  to  20  years  in  1981)  were  more  likely  to  be  in  the
47:1258:89878:12:9:72:526:106:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:overweight, late overweight, and early overweight trajectory groups relative to the normal weight group.

47:1261:90204:12:0:72:458:70:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:column two we average the sum of the wage differences conditional on choosing to work.

49:1264:91762:22:22:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:loss in hourly wages grows as body mass increases.  Translated into total earnings over ages
49:1265:91854:22:22:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:25 through 40, we estimate a $1,668 reduction over 16 years if a white female is overweight
49:1266:91945:22:22:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:versus normal weight throughout that age span (row three minus row two).  If she is obese,
49:1267:92035:22:22:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:she loses $3,874 (row four minus row two).  These figures (column three) are based on the
49:1268:92124:22:22:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wage draws she receives.  In column four, we report analogous values conditional on working

49:1272:92422:22:22:72:540:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:penalty of $474 (row five minus row two) and $2,956 (row six minus row two), respectively.
49:1273:92512:22:21:72:540:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Finally,  for white females,  the reduction in total potential earnings (i.e.,  based on offered
49:1274:92608:21:22:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wages each period) for overweight (obese) body mass relative to normal body mass (rows
49:1275:92694:22:22:72:540:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:seven and eight,  respectively) from age 18 to 40 is $1,668 ($3,874).  These wage penalties
49:1276:92785:22:22:72:540:401:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:associated with body mass can reach as high as two percent of total earnings over this age

49:1280:93056:22:22:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:two) reflects the higher wages among overweight women, which characterizes black females in
49:1281:93147:22:22:72:540:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:this age group.  However, being obese (row five) and black results in lower wages than being
49:1282:93239:22:22:72:540:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:overweight (row four) and black.  Obesity among black women who choose to work amounts
49:1283:93325:22:22:72:540:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to  a  $170  loss  in  total  earnings  when  she  chooses  to  be  employed  (row  eight).   The  wage
49:1284:93428:22:22:72:540:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:penalties (or gains) for black women are tiny relative to total earnings over this age range.
49:1285:93521:22:21:72:540:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Recall, however, that these figures represent averages over the entire wage distribution.  The
49:1286:93615:21:22:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:wage penalties at the high end of the wage distribution are large and significant for both
49:1287:93705:22:0:72:196:160:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:white and black women.

50:1289:93742:34:22:72:540:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We find significant differences in the contemporaneous effect and the dynamic effect of body

50:1291:93937:22:22:72:540:630:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We highlight several differences between our model and those models frequently used in this
50:1292:94028:22:22:72:540:608:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:literature:  we use a richer incorporation of body mass, we account for selection into employ-

50:1296:94389:22:22:72:540:520:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:allows  us  to  retain  non-time-varying  wage  determinants,  we  include  both  permanent  and
50:1297:94485:22:21:72:540:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:time-varying individual unobserved heterogeneity, and we estimate the impact of determi-

50:1299:94671:22:22:72:540:455:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:enables us to disentangle these two effects of interest.  It also allows us to understand the
50:1300:94764:22:0:72:412:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mechanisms over the life cycle that contribute to these differences.
