2:34:1937:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:The favorite-longshot bias describes the longstanding empirical regularity that betting odds provide
2:35:2037:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:biased estimates of the probability of a horse winning—longshots are overbet, while favorites are underbet.
2:36:2144:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:Neoclassical explanations of this phenomenon focus on rational gamblers who overbet longshots due
2:37:2241:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:to risk-love. The competing behavioral explanations emphasize the role of misperceptions of probabilities.
2:38:2347:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:We provide novel empirical tests that can discriminate between these competing theories by assessing
2:39:2447:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:whether the models that explain gamblers’ choices in one part of their choice set (betting to win) can
2:40:2549:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:also rationalize decisions over a wider choice set, including compound bets in the exacta, quinella
2:41:2648:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:or trifecta pools. Using a new, large-scale dataset ideally suited to implement these tests we find evidence
2:42:2756:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:in favor of the view that misperceptions of probability drive the favorite-longshot bias, as suggested
2:43:2858:14:42:72:169:462:12:Times:12:Times:by Prospect Theory.

3:59:3235:37:24:72:540:671:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The racetrack provides a natural laboratory for economists interested in understanding decision-
3:60:3331:24:24:72:540:647:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:making under uncertainty. The most discussed empirical regularity in racetrack gambling markets
3:61:3426:24:23:72:540:623:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is thefavorite-longshot bias:  equilibrium market prices (betting odds) provide biased estimates
3:62:3522:23:24:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of the probability of a horse winning.  Specifically, bettors value longshots more than expected
3:63:3618:24:24:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:given how rarely they win, and they value favorites too little given how often they win.  Figure
3:64:3714:24:24:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:1 illustrates, showing that the rate of return to betting on horses with odds of 100/1 or greater is
3:65:3814:24:24:72:539:528:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:about−61%, betting randomly yields average returns of−23%, while betting the favorite in every
3:66:3908:24:35:72:223:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:race yields losses of only 5.5%.

3:84:4429:50:24:89:539:126:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Since the favorite-longshot bias was first noted by Griffith in 1949, it has been found in race-
3:85:4525:24:0:72:540:102:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:track betting data around the world, with very few exceptions. The literature documenting this bias
4:86:4625:0:24:72:407:708:12:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:is voluminous, and covers both bookmaker- and pari-mutuel markets.1
4:87:4692:24:24:89:539:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Two broad sets of theories have been proposed to explain the favorite-longshot bias.   First,
4:88:4785:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:neoclassical  theory  suggests  that  the  prices  bettors  are  willing  to  pay  for  various  gambles  can
4:89:4894:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:be used to recover their utility function.  While betting at any odds is actuarially unfair,  this is
4:90:4995:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:particularly acute for longshots—which are also the riskiest investments.  Thus, the neoclassical
4:91:5092:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:approach can reconcile both gambling and the longshot bias only by positing (at least locally)
4:92:5186:24:24:72:375:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:risk-loving utility functions, as in Friedman and Savage (1948).
4:93:5250:24:24:89:539:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Alternatively, behavioral theories suggest that cognitive errors and misperceptions of probabil-
4:94:5346:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ities play a role in market mis-pricing.  These theories incorporate laboratory studies by cognitive
4:95:5446:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:psychologists that show people are systematically poor at discerning between small and tiny prob-
4:96:5543:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:abilities, and hence price both similarly.  Further, people exhibit a strong preference for certainty
4:97:5644:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:over extremely likely outcomes, leading highly probable gambles to be under-priced. These results
4:98:5741:24:24:72:466:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:form an important foundation of Prospect Theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979).
4:99:5818:24:24:89:539:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:Our aim in this paper is to test whether therisk-love classof models or themisperceptions class
4:100:5913:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of models simultaneously fits data from multiple betting pools.  While there exist many specific
4:101:6009:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:models of the favorite-longshot bias, we show in Section 3 that each yields implications for the
4:102:6105:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:pricing of gambles equivalent to stark models of either a risk-loving representative agent,  or a
4:103:6202:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:representative agent who bases her decisions on biased perceptions of true probabilities.  That is,
4:104:6301:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the favorite-longshot bias can be fully rationalized by a standard rational-expectations expected-
4:105:6399:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:utility model,  or by appealing to an expected wealth maximizing agent who overweights small
4:106:6491:24:24:72:539:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:probabilities and underweights large probabilities.2Thus, without parametric assumptions, which
4:107:6586:24:23:72:499:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:we are unwilling to make, the two theories are observationally equivalent in win bet data.
4:108:6676:23:19:89:539:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We combine new data with a novel econometric identification strategy to discriminate between
4:109:6768:19:15:85:539:163:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:1Thaler and Ziemba (1988), Sauer (1998) and Snowberg and Wolfers (2007) survey the literature. The exceptions
4:110:6877:15:12:72:540:148:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:are Busche and Hall (1988), which finds that the favorite-longshot bias is not evident in data on 2,653 Hong Kong
4:111:6990:12:12:72:540:136:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:races, and Busche (1994), which confirms this finding in an additional 2,690 races in Hong Kong, and 1,738 races in
4:112:7105:12:9:72:97:124:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Japan.
4:113:7111:9:15:85:539:115:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:2Or adopting a behavioral versus neoclassical distinction, we follow Gabriel and Marsden (1990) in asking:  “are
4:114:7223:15:12:72:540:100:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:we observing an inefficient market or simply one in which the tastes and preferences of the market participations lead
4:115:7341:12:0:72:170:88:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:to the observed results?”
5:116:7367:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:these  two  classes  of  theories.   Our  data  include  all  6.4  million  horse  race  starts  in  the  United
5:117:7479:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:States from 1992 to 2001. These data are an order of magnitude larger than any dataset previously
5:118:7576:24:24:72:498:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:examined, and allow us to be extremely precise in establishing the relevant stylized facts.
5:119:7667:24:24:89:539:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Our econometric innovation is to distinguish between these theories by deriving testable pre-
5:120:7760:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:dictions about  the pricing of  compound lotteries (also  calledexotic betsat the  racetrack).   For
5:121:7860:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:example, anexactais a bet on both which horse will come first and which will come second.  Es-
5:122:7954:24:24:71:539:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sentially, we ask whether the preferences and perceptions that rationalize the favorite-longshot bias
5:123:8055:24:24:71:539:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(in win bet data) can also explain the pricing of exactas,quinellas—a bet on two horses to come
5:124:8150:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:first and second in either order—andtrifectas—a bet on which horse will come in first,  which
5:125:8243:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:second and which third. By expanding the choice set under consideration (to correspond with the
5:126:8338:24:23:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:bettor’s actual choice set!), we use each theory to derive unique testable predictions. We find that
5:127:8438:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the misperceptions class more accurately predicts the prices of exotic bets, and also their relative
5:128:8538:24:24:72:104:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:prices.
5:129:8545:24:24:89:539:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:To demonstrate the application of this idea to our data, note that betting on horses with odds
5:130:8639:24:24:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:between 4/1 and 9/1 has an approximately constant rate of return (at−18%, see Figure 1).  Thus,
5:131:8734:24:24:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the misperceptions class infers bettors are equally well calibrated over this range, and hence betting
5:132:8836:24:24:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:on combinations of outcomes among such horses will yield similar rates of return. That is, betting
5:133:8934:24:24:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:on an exacta with a 4/1 horse to win and a 9/1 horse to come second will yield similar expected
5:134:9029:24:24:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:returns to betting on the exacta with the reverse ordering (although the odds of the two exactas will
5:135:9130:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:differ).  In contrast, under the risk-love model, bettors are willing to pay a larger risk penalty for
5:136:9232:24:24:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the riskier bet—such as the exacta in which the 9/1 horse wins, and the 4/1 horse runs second—
5:137:9326:24:23:72:355:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:decreasing its rate of return relative to the reverse ordering.
5:138:9389:23:24:89:539:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Our research question is most similar to Jullien and Salani ́e (2000) and Gandhi (2007) who
5:139:9480:24:24:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:attempt  to  differentiate  between  preference-  and  perception-based  explanations  of  the  favorite-
5:140:9585:24:24:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:longshot  bias  using  only  data  on  the  price  of  win  bets.   The  results  of  the  former  study  favor
5:141:9696:24:24:72:540:110:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:perception-based explanations and the results of the latter favor preference-based explanations.
5:142:9792:24:0:72:540:86:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Rosett (1965) conducts a related analysis in that he considers both win bets and combinations of
6:143:9889:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:win bets as present in the bettors’ choice set.  Ali (1979), Asch and Quandt (1987) and Dolbear
6:144:9984:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(1993) test the efficiency of compound lottery markets. We believe that we are the first to use com-
6:145:10084:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:pound lottery prices to distinguish between competing theories of possible market (in)efficiency.
6:146:10181:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Of course the idea is much older: Friedman and Savage (1948) notes that a hallmark of expected
6:147:10275:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:utility theory is “that the reaction of persons to complicated gambles can be inferred from their
6:148:10372:24:55:72:208:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reaction to simple gambles.”
6:149:10400:55:36:72:199:533:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:2  Stylized Facts
6:150:10417:36:24:72:540:497:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Our data contains all 6,403,712 horse starts run in the United States between 1992 and 2001. These
6:151:10515:24:24:72:540:473:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:are official jockey club data; the most precise available.  Data of this nature are extremely expen-
6:152:10615:24:24:72:540:449:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sive, which presumably explains why previous studies have used substantially smaller samples.
6:153:10708:24:24:72:312:425:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The appendix provides more detail about the data.
6:154:10757:24:24:89:539:401:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We summarize our data in Figure 1. We calculate the rate of return to betting on every horse at
6:155:10852:24:24:72:540:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:each odds, and use Lowess smoothing to take advantage of information from horses with similar
6:156:10945:24:24:72:540:353:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:odds.  Data are graphed on a log-odds scale so as to better show their relevant range.  The vastly
6:157:11043:24:24:72:540:329:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:better returns to betting on favorites rather than longshots is the favorite-longshot bias.   Figure
6:158:11143:24:24:72:540:305:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:1 also shows the same pattern for the 206,808 races (with 1,485,112 horse starts) for which the
6:159:11238:24:23:72:540:281:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:jockey club recorded payoffs to exacta, quinella or trifecta bets.  Given that much of our analysis
6:160:11337:23:24:72:469:258:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:will focus on this smaller sample, it is reassuring to see a similar pattern of returns.
6:161:11425:24:24:89:539:234:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Figure 2 shows the same rate of return calculations for several other datasets. We present new
6:162:11519:24:24:72:540:210:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:data from 2,725,000 starts in Australia from the South Coast Database, and 380,000 starts in Great
6:163:11617:24:24:72:540:186:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Britain from flatstats.co.uk. The favorite-longshot bias appears equally evident in these countries,
6:164:11717:24:24:72:540:162:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:despite the fact that odds are determined by pari-mutuel markets in the United States, bookmakers
6:165:11814:24:24:72:540:138:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in the United Kingdom, and bookmakers competing with a state-run pari-mutuel market in Aus-

6:167:12007:24:0:72:267:90:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:stable since first noted in Griffith (1949).

7:187:12421:295:24:89:539:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The literature suggests two other empirical regularities to explore.  First, Thaler and Ziemba
7:188:12515:24:24:72:540:359:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(1988) suggest that there are positive rates of return to betting extreme favorites, perhaps suggesting
7:189:12618:24:24:72:540:335:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:limits to arbitrage.  This is not true in any of our datasets, providing a similar finding to Levitt
7:190:12718:24:24:72:540:311:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(2004): despite significant anomalies in the pricing of bets, there are no profit opportunities from
7:191:12818:24:24:72:191:287:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:simple betting strategies.
7:192:12844:24:23:89:539:263:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Second, McGlothlin (1956), Ali (1977) and Asch, Malkiel, and Quandt (1982) argue that the
7:193:12933:23:24:72:540:240:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rate of return to betting moderate longshots falls in the last race of the day.  These studies have
7:194:13032:24:24:72:540:216:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:come to be widely cited despite being based on small samples.  Kahneman and Tversky (1979)
7:195:13122:24:24:72:540:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and Thaler and Ziemba (1988) interpret these results as consistent with loss aversion: most bettors
7:196:13221:24:24:72:540:168:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:are losing at the end of the day,  and the last race provides them with a chance to recoup their
7:197:13317:24:24:72:540:144:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:losses.  Thus, bettors underbet the favorite even more than usual, and overbet horses at odds that
7:198:13415:24:24:72:540:120:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:would eliminate their losses.  The dashed line in Figure 1 separates out data from the last race;
7:199:13512:24:24:72:540:96:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:while the point estimates differ slightly, these differences are not statistically significantly. If there
7:200:13618:24:0:72:540:72:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:was evidence of loss aversion in earlier data,  it is no longer evident in recent data,  even as the
8:201:13719:0:24:72:243:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:favorite-longshot bias has persisted.
8:202:13756:24:24:89:539:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In  the next  section  we argue  that  these facts  cannot  separate risk-love  from  misperception-
8:203:13856:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:based theories. We propose new tests based on the requirement that a theory developed to explain
8:204:13952:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:equilibrium odds of horses winning should also be able to explain the equilibrium odds in the
8:205:14045:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:exacta,  quinella  and  trifecta  markets  separately,  as  well  as  the  equilibrium  odds  in  exacta  and
8:206:14154:24:55:72:188:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:quinella markets jointly.
8:207:14179:55:36:72:409:533:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:3  Two Models of the Favorite-Longshot Bias
8:208:14222:36:24:72:540:497:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We start with two extremely stark models, each of which has the merit of simplicity.  Both are
8:209:14316:24:24:72:540:473:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:models where all agents have the same preferences and perceptions, but as we suggest below, can
8:210:14411:24:24:72:540:449:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:be expanded to incorporate heterogeneity. Equilibrium price data cannot separately identify more
8:211:14507:24:47:72:343:425:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:complex models from these representative agent models.
8:212:14561:47:32:72:231:378:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:3.1  The Risk-Love Class
8:213:14585:32:24:72:540:346:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Following Weitzman (1965), we postulate expected utility maximizers with unbiased beliefs and
8:214:14678:24:24:72:539:322:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:utilityU(·):R→R.  In equilibrium, bettors must be indifferent between betting on the favorite
8:215:14771:24:24:71:539:298:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:horseAwith probability of winningpAand odds ofOA/1, and betting on a longshotBwith proba-
8:216:14860:24:44:72:257:274:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:bility of winningpBand odds ofOB/1:
8:217:14895:44:43:139:540:230:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f2:pAU(OA) =pBU(OB)(normalizing utility to zero, if the bet is lost).3(1)
8:218:14965:43:24:89:540:187:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The odds(OA,OB)and the probabilities(pA,pB)of horses winning, which we observe, identify
8:219:15053:24:24:72:540:163:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the representative bettor’s utility function up to a scaling factor.4To fix the scale we normalize
8:220:15151:24:24:72:540:139:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:utility to zero if the bet loses, and to one if the bettor chooses not to bet.  Thus, if the bettor is
8:221:15253:24:19:72:539:115:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:indifferent between accepting or rejecting a gamble offering odds ofO/1 that wins with probability
8:222:15351:19:12:85:508:96:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:3We also assume that, consistent with the literature, each bettor chooses to bet on only one horse in a race.

9:257:16293:24:24:72:386:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:utility function required to explain all of the variation in Figure 1.
9:258:16363:24:24:89:539:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:As can be seen from Figure 3, a risk-loving utility function is required to rationalize the bettor
9:259:16461:24:24:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:accepting lower average returns on longshots, even as they are riskier bets. The figure also shows
9:260:16559:24:24:72:348:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that a CARA utility function fits the data reasonably well.
9:261:16618:24:24:89:539:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Several  other  theories  of  the  favorite-longshot  bias  yield  implications  that  are  observation-
9:262:16722:24:24:72:540:181:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ally equivalent to this risk-loving representative agent model.  Some of these theories are clearly
9:263:16821:24:23:72:540:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:equivalent—such as that of Golec and Tamarkin (1998),  which argues that bettors prefer skew
9:264:16913:23:24:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rather than risk—as they are theories about the shape of the utility function. It can easily be shown
9:265:17014:24:24:72:540:110:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that richer theories—such as that of Thaler and Ziemba (1988) where “bragging rights” accrue
9:266:17106:24:0:72:540:86:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:from winning a bet at long odds, or that of Conlisk (1993) in which the mere purchase of a bet on

10:268:17260:48:32:72:262:660:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:3.2  The Misperceptions Class
10:269:17289:32:24:72:540:628:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Alternatively, the misperceptions class postulates risk-neutral subjective expected utility maximiz-
10:270:17389:24:23:72:540:604:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ers, whose subjective beliefs are given by theprobability weighting functionπ(p):[0,1]→[0,1].
10:271:17482:23:24:71:539:581:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In equilibrium, there are no opportunities for subjectively-expected gain, so bettors must believe
10:272:17580:24:44:71:470:557:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that the subjective rates of return to betting on any pair of horsesAandBare equal:
10:273:17663:44:44:216:540:513:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f2:π(pA)(OA+1) =π(pB)(OB+1) =1.(2)
10:274:17694:44:24:71:540:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Consequently, data on the odds(OA,OB)and the probabilities(pA,pB)of horses winning reveal
10:275:17783:24:24:71:299:445:12:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:the misperceptions of the representative bettor.6
10:276:17832:24:23:89:539:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Note that the misperceptions class allows more flexibility in the way probabilities enter the
10:277:17925:23:24:71:539:398:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:representative bettor’s value of a bet, but it is more restrictive than the risk-love class in terms of
10:278:18028:24:24:71:539:374:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:how payoffs enter that function.  More to the point, without restrictive parametric assumptions,
10:279:18124:24:24:71:539:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:each class of models is just-identified, so each yields identical predictions for the pricing of win
10:280:18224:24:24:71:93:326:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:bets.
10:281:18229:24:24:89:539:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The right panel of Figure 3 shows the probability weighting functionπ(p)implied by the data
10:282:18320:24:24:71:539:278:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in Figure 1.  The low rates of return to betting longshots are rationalized by bettors who bet as
10:283:18417:24:24:71:539:254:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:though horses with tiny probabilities of winning actually have moderate probabilities of winning.
10:284:18514:24:18:71:539:230:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The specific shape of the declining rates of return identifies the probability weighting function at
10:285:18614:18:16:85:539:212:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:5Formally,  these  theories  suggest  agents  maximize  expected  utility,  where  utility  is  the  sum  of  the  felicity  of
10:286:18741:16:12:72:539:196:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:wealth,y(·):R→R, and the felicity of bragging rights or the thrill of winning,b(·):R→R.  Hence the expected
10:287:18848:12:12:72:539:184:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:utility to a bettor with initial wealthw0of a gamble at oddsOthat wins with probabilitypcan be expressed as:
10:288:18956:12:12:72:539:172:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f2:E(U(O)) =p[y(w0+O) +b(O)] + [1−p]y(w0−1).  As before, bettors will accept lower returns on riskier wagers
10:289:19061:12:12:72:540:160:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:(betting on longshots) ifU′′>0.  This is possible if either the felicity of wealth is sufficiently convex or bragging
10:290:19178:12:12:72:540:148:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:rights are increasing in the payoff at a sufficiently increasing rate.  More to the point, revealed preference data do not
10:291:19300:12:8:72:379:136:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:allow us to separately identify effects operating throughy(·), rather thanb(·).
10:292:19379:8:16:85:540:128:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:6While we term the divergence betweenπ(p)andpmisperceptions, in non-expected utility theories,π(p)can
10:293:19480:16:12:72:540:112:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:be interpreted as a preference over types of gambles.  Under either interpretation our approach is valid, in that we
10:294:19596:12:12:72:540:100:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:test whether gambles are motivated by nonlinear functions of wealth or probability.  In (2) we implicitly assume that
10:295:19713:12:0:72:258:88:10:g_d0_f11:10:g_d0_f2:π(1) =1, although we allow limp→1π(p)≤1.
11:296:19754:0:24:72:539:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:each point.7This function shares some of the features of the decision weights in Prospect Theory
11:297:19850:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(Kahneman and Tversky, 1979), and the figure shows that the one-parameter probability weighting
11:298:19945:24:24:72:316:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:function in Prelec (1998) fits the data quite closely.
11:299:19999:24:24:89:539:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:While we have presented a very sparse model, a number of richer theories have been proposed
11:300:20090:24:24:72:539:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that yield similar implications.8For instance, Ottaviani and Sørenson (2009) show that initial infor-
11:301:20191:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:mation asymmetries between bettors may lead to misperceptions of the true probabilities of horses
11:302:20288:24:24:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:winning.  Moreover, Henery (1985) and Williams and Paton (1997) argue that bettors discount a
11:303:20381:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:constant proportion of the gambles in which they bet on a loser, possibly due to a self-serving bias
11:304:20481:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in which losers argue that conditions were atypical.  Because longshot bets lose more often, this
11:305:20578:24:47:72:475:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:discounting yields perceptions in which betting on a longshot seems more attractive.
11:306:20662:47:32:72:381:445:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:3.3  Implications for Pricing Compound Lotteries
11:307:20710:32:24:72:540:413:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We now show how our two classes of models—while each just-identified based on data from win
11:308:20801:24:24:72:540:389:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:bets—yield different implications for the prices of exotic bets. As such, our approach responds to
11:309:20899:24:23:72:540:365:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Sauer (1998, p.2026), which calls for research that provides “equilibrium pricing functions from
11:310:20995:23:24:72:283:342:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:well-posed models of the wagering market.”
11:311:21037:24:24:89:539:318:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We discuss the pricing of exactas (picking the first two horses in order) in detail. Prices for these
11:312:21138:24:24:72:540:294:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:bets are constructed from: the bettors’ utility function, indifference conditions as in (1) or (2), data
11:313:21242:24:24:72:539:270:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:on the perceived likelihood of the pick for first,A, actually winning (pAorπ(pA), depending on

11:317:21618:19:15:85:540:179:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:7There remains one minor issue:  as Figure 1 shows, horses never win as often as suggested by their win odds
11:318:21726:15:12:72:540:164:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:because of the track-take.  Thus we follow the convention in the literature and adjust the odds-implied probabilities
11:319:21843:12:12:72:540:152:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:by a factor of one minus the track take for that specific race, so that they are on average unbiased;  our results are
11:320:21961:12:9:72:316:140:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:qualitatively similar whether or not we make this adjustment.
11:321:22022:9:15:85:539:131:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:8While the assumption of risk-neutrality may be too stark, as long as bettors gamble small proportions of their
11:322:22133:15:12:72:540:116:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:wealth the relevant risk premia are second-order.  For instance, assuming log utility, if the bettor is indifferent over

12:350:22996:24:24:71:539:425:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:function is estimated from the pricing of win bets (in Figure 3), and can be inverted to compute

12:353:23237:24:24:71:539:353:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:bets.  We apply an analogous approach to the pricing of quinella and trifecta bets:  the intuition is
12:354:23338:24:23:71:378:329:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the same; the mathematical details are described in Appendix B.

12:359:23687:0:16:135:164:242:12:g_d0_f11:12:g_d0_f7:π(pB)
12:360:23692:16:0:125:173:226:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f7:1−π(pA)
12:361:23699:0:24:174:540:234:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:;  replacingπ(p)withpin the risk-love class.   This assumption is akin to
12:362:23772:24:24:72:540:210:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:thinking about the race for second as a “race within the race” (Sauer, 1998). While relying on the
12:363:23870:24:24:72:540:186:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Harville formula is standard in the literature—see for instance Asch and Quandt (1987)—we show
12:364:23964:24:24:72:540:162:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that our results are robust to dropping this assumption and estimating this conditional probability,
12:365:24064:24:20:72:203:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f2:pB|A, directly from the data.
12:366:24093:20:16:85:539:118:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:9Our econometric method imposes continuity on the utility and probability weighting functions; the data mandate
12:367:24204:16:12:72:539:102:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:that both be strictly increasing.  Together this is sufficient to ensure thatπ(·)andU(·)are invertible.  As in Figure 1,
12:368:24324:12:12:72:540:90:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:we do not have sufficient data to estimate the utility of winning bets at odds greater than 200/1. This prohibits us from
12:369:24445:12:0:72:479:78:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:pricing bets whose odds are greater than 200/1, which is most limiting for our analysis of trifecta bets.
13:370:24552:0:32:72:344:708:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:3.4  Failure to Reduce Compound Lotteries
13:371:24593:32:24:72:540:676:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:As in Prospect Theory, the frame the bettor adopts in trying to assess each gamble is a key issue,
13:372:24691:24:24:72:540:652:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:particularly for misperceptions-based models.  Specifically, (4) assumes that bettors first attempt
13:373:24790:24:24:72:540:628:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to assess the likelihood of horseAwinning,π(pA), and then assess the likelihood ofBcoming
13:374:24879:24:24:71:539:604:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:second given thatAis the winner,π(pB|A). An alternative frame might suggest that bettors directly
13:375:24976:24:24:71:408:580:12:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:assesses the likelihood of first-and-second combinations:π(pApB|A).10
13:376:25045:24:24:89:539:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:There is a direct analogy to the literature on the assessment of compound lotteries: does the bet-
13:377:25143:24:24:71:539:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tor separately assess the likelihood of winning an initial gamble (picking the winning horse) which
13:378:25242:24:24:71:539:508:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:yields a subsequent gamble as its prize (picking the second-placed horse), or does she consider the
13:379:25341:24:24:71:539:484:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:equivalent simple lottery (as in Samuelson (1952))?  Consistent with (4), the accumulated experi-
13:380:25438:24:24:71:539:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:mental evidence (Camerer and Ho, 1994) is more in line with subjects failing to reduce compound
13:381:25533:24:23:71:220:436:12:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:lotteries into simple lotteries.11
13:382:25567:23:24:89:539:413:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Alternatively, we could choose not to defend either assumption, leaving it as a matter for em-
13:383:25661:24:24:71:539:389:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:pirical testing. Interestingly, if gamblers adopt a frame consistent with the reduction of compound
13:384:25760:24:24:71:539:365:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:lotteries into their equivalent simple lottery form, this yields a pricing rule for the misperceptions
13:385:25862:24:24:71:539:341:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:class equivalent to that of the risk-love class.12Thus, evidence consistent with what we are calling
13:386:25962:24:24:71:539:317:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the risk-love class accommodates either risk-love by unbiased bettors, or risk-neutral but biased
13:387:26059:24:24:71:539:293:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:bettors,  whose  bias  affects  their  perception  of  an  appropriately  reduced  compound  lottery.   By
13:388:26165:24:24:71:539:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:contrast, the competing misperceptions class implies the failure to reduce compound lotteries and
13:389:26262:24:24:71:319:245:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:posits the specific form of this failure, shown in (4).
13:390:26317:24:24:89:539:221:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This discussion implies that results consistent with our risk-love class are also consistent with
13:391:26414:24:23:71:539:197:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a richer set of models emphasizing choices over simple gambles.  These include models based on
13:392:26508:23:19:71:539:174:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the utility of gambling,  information asymmetry or limits to arbitrage,  such as Ali (1977),  Shin
13:393:26606:19:15:82:540:155:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:10Unless the probability weighting function is a power function (π(p) =pα), these different frames yield different
13:394:26720:15:9:72:181:140:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:implications (Acz ́el, 1966).
13:395:26749:9:12:82:437:131:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:11Additionally, note that (4) satisfies the compound independence axiom of Segal (1990).
13:396:26837:12:16:82:539:119:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:12To see this, note that identical data (from Figure 1) is used to construct the utility and decision weight functions
13:397:26955:16:12:72:540:103:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:respectively,  so each is constructed to rationalize the same set of choices over simple lotteries.   This implies each
13:398:27074:12:12:72:540:91:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:class also yields the same set of choices over compound lotteries if preferences in both classes obey the reduction of
13:399:27192:12:0:72:276:79:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:compound lotteries into equivalent simple lotteries.
14:400:27246:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(1992), Hurley and McDonough (1995), Manski (2006). Any theory that prescribes a specific bias
14:401:27340:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in a market for a simple gamble (win betting) will yield similar implications in a related market for
14:402:27441:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:compound gambles if gamblers assess their equivalent simple gamble form. By implication, reject-
14:403:27537:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ing the risk-love class substantially narrows the set of plausible theories of the favorite-longshot
14:404:27637:24:55:72:94:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:bias.
14:405:27642:55:36:72:279:557:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:4  Results from Exotic Bets
14:406:27669:36:24:72:540:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The first panel of Figure 4 shows the difference between the predictions for exactas of the risk-
14:407:27766:24:24:72:540:497:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:love and misperceptions classes, expressed as a percent of the predictions.  This demonstrates the
14:408:27864:24:24:72:540:473:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:two classes of models  yield qualitatively different predictions.   Exotic bets have relatively low
14:409:27963:24:24:72:540:449:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:probabilities of winning, so under the risk-love class a risk penalty results, yielding lower odds.
14:410:28062:24:24:72:540:425:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:By contrast, the misperceptions model is based on the underlying simple lotteries, many of which
14:411:28158:24:24:72:540:401:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:suffer  smaller  perception  biases.   The  risk  penalty  becomes  particularly  important  as  odds  get
14:412:28264:24:24:72:540:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:longer; thus the difference in predictions grows along a line from the bottom right to the top left of

14:418:28556:0:24:430:539:305:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:.  We test the ability of
14:419:28581:24:23:72:540:281:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:each economic model to predict this price by examining the mean absolute error of the predictions
14:420:28678:23:24:72:540:258:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of both models from the actual prices of exotic bets (column 1).  We further investigate which of
14:421:28775:24:24:72:540:234:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the models produces predictions that are closer, observation-by-observation, to the prices that are
14:422:28874:24:24:72:540:210:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:actually observed (column 3).  The explanatory power of the misperceptions class is substantially
14:423:28971:24:24:72:540:186:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:greater.  The misperceptions class is six percentage points closer to the actual prices of exactas

16:512:30737:47:24:72:540:263:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:risk-love class is 16.8%.  At long odds (the top and right of the figure) there are clear patterns in
16:513:30838:24:24:72:540:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the data that are not well explained by either class, leaving room for more nuanced theories of the
16:514:30937:24:24:72:179:215:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:favorite-longshot bias.
16:515:30960:24:23:89:539:191:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Panels B and C of Table 1 repeat this analysis, but this time extending our test to see which
16:516:31053:23:24:72:540:168:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:model can better explain the pricing of quinella and trifecta bets.  The intuition is similar in all
16:517:31153:24:24:72:540:144:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:three cases; Appendix B contains further mathematical detail.  Each of these tests across all three
16:518:31252:24:19:72:501:120:12:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:panels shows that the misperceptions model fits the data better than the risk-love model.13
16:519:31343:19:15:82:539:101:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:13We have also re-run these tests a number of other ways to test for robustness.   Our conclusions are unaltered
16:520:31455:15:12:72:540:86:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:by:  whether or not we weight observations by the size of the betting pool, whether we drop observations where the
16:521:31569:12:0:72:540:74:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:models imply very long odds, whether or not we adjust the models in the manner described in footnote 8; and different

17:523:31744:32:24:72:539:676:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:Recall that we observe all of the inputs to both pricing models exceptOB|A, the odds of horseB
17:524:31838:24:24:71:539:652:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:finishing second, conditional on horseAwinning. In Section 4 we used the convenient assumption
17:525:31932:24:24:71:539:628:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of conditional independence to assess the likely odds of this bet, but there may be good reason
17:526:32027:24:24:71:539:604:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to doubt this assumption.  For example, if a heavily favored horse does not win a race, this may
17:527:32123:24:24:71:539:580:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reflect the fact that it was injured during the race, which would imply that it is very unlikely to
17:528:32222:24:24:71:539:556:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:come second.  That is, the win odds may provide useful guidance on the probability of winning,
17:529:32316:24:24:71:539:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:but may be a poor guide to the race for second. In this section we test the assumption of conditional
17:530:32417:24:24:71:539:508:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:independence and derive two further tests can distinguish between the risk-love and misperceptions
17:531:32515:24:24:71:255:484:12:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:models even if this assumption fails.14
17:532:32554:24:24:89:539:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We test the conditional independence assumption by asking whether we can improve on the
17:533:32641:24:23:71:539:436:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:predictions of the Harville (1973) formula using other data. As in Section 3.3, the Harville formula

17:538:32830:24:24:72:540:389:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the race. We estimate linear probability model where the dependent variable is an indicator variable
17:539:32930:24:24:72:458:365:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for whether horseBfinished second. A probit specification yields similar results.
17:540:33011:24:24:89:539:341:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The first specification of Table 2 shows that the Harville formula is an extremely useful pre-
17:541:33105:24:24:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:dictor of the probability of a horse finishing second. As a guide for thinking about the explanatory
17:542:33205:24:24:72:540:293:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:power of the Harville formula, note that theR2of specification 1 is about four-fifths theR2of the
17:543:33302:24:24:72:540:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:regression of an indicator for whether a horse won the race on its betting odds.  Columns 2 and 3
17:544:33399:24:24:72:540:245:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:however, provide compelling evidence that we can do better than the Harville formula.  Column
17:545:33492:24:24:72:540:221:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:2 adds dummy variables representing the odds of the first place horse and the odds of the second
17:546:33588:24:23:72:540:197:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:placed horse (using 100 odds groupings in each case, each grouping containing 1% of the odds
17:547:33680:23:24:72:540:174:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:distribution).   Column 3 includes a full set of interactions of these fixed effects,  estimating the
17:548:33781:24:24:72:540:150:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:conditional probability non-parametrically from the odds of the first and second place horses; this
17:549:33880:24:22:72:540:126:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:regression is equivalent to estimating a large table showing the proportion of horses at odds of
17:550:33976:22:9:72:493:104:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:functional forms for the price of a bet, including the natural log price of a $1 claim, the odds, or log-odds.

18:568:35088:23:24:89:539:384:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We now use non-parametrically estimated probabilities as a robustness check of our results in
18:569:35181:24:24:72:539:360:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Table 1. That is, rather than inferringpB|A(and henceπ(pB|A)andOB|A) from the Harville formula,
18:570:35276:24:24:71:539:336:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:we simply apply the empirical probabilities estimated using the Lowess procedure of Cleveland,
18:571:35370:24:24:71:539:312:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Devlin, and Grosse (1988).  We implement this exercise in Table 3, calculating the price of exotic
18:572:35468:24:24:71:539:288:12:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f3:bets under the risk-love and misperception models, but adapting our earlier approach so thatpB|A

18:575:35689:24:117:71:488:216:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:bets, the misperceptions model has greater explanatory power than the risk-love model.
18:576:35775:117:16:82:540:99:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:15Because the precision of our estimates ofpB|Avary greatly, WLS weighted by the product of the squared standard

19:601:36941:36:24:72:540:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Our final test of the two classes relies only on the relative pricing of exacta and quinella bets, and
19:602:37043:24:24:72:539:203:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is more stringent as it considers these bets simultaneously.16As before, we derive predictions
19:603:37137:24:24:72:381:179:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:from each class and test which better explains the observed data.

19:608:37617:12:0:72:415:83:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:explains pricing of win bets can jointly explain the pricing of exacta and quinella bets.
20:609:37708:0:24:72:539:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f7:pays off when the winning exacta is eitherABorBAand hence occurs with probabilitypA∗pB|A+

21:716:40323:24:24:72:539:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f2:EAB=39/1 is interpreted as having a large risk penalty, as should be clear from Figures 1 and
21:717:40416:24:24:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:3.  But if, in fact, compound bets are priced according to the misperceptions class—where bets at
21:718:40513:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:odds of 4/1 and 9/1 do not attract much of a risk (or misperceptions) penalty—then by inferring
21:719:40608:24:24:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the existence of such a penalty, the risk-love model implicitly underestimates the probability that
21:720:40707:24:23:72:539:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:exactaABwill occur. This underestimation is severe enough that the risk-love class predicts a less
21:721:40805:23:24:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:than 50% chance that the relatively favored horseAwill finish first out ofAandB. But given that
21:722:40900:24:24:72:539:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f2:Ais the favorite of the two horses (OA/1=4/1<9/1=OB/1), it is in fact more likely than not to
21:723:40993:24:24:71:145:397:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:finish beforeB.
21:724:41008:24:24:89:539:373:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:If,  instead,  the relative longshotBwins,  the exactaEBA=44/1 is observed.   Applying the
21:725:41098:24:24:71:539:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:logic above, the risk-love class infers that this price incorporates an even larger risk penalty, and
21:726:41199:24:24:71:539:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:thus assigns a low probability to this exacta.  In turn, this means that it yields a low probability
21:727:41299:24:24:71:540:301:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of horseBcoming in first, given thatAandBare the top two finishers.  However, the risk-love
21:728:41390:24:24:72:539:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:class will make this predictiononly whenexactaEBAis observed—that is, horseBactually wins
21:729:41479:24:24:72:539:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the race—which is exactly wrong.  Thus, conditional onAandBbeing the top two finishers, the
21:730:41570:24:24:72:539:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:risk-love class predicts the relative favorite,A, will win with probability less than12wheneverA
21:731:41666:24:23:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:wins. Similarly, wheneverBwins, the risk-love class predicts that the relative longshotBwill win
21:732:41762:23:24:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with probability less than12, and hence predicts that the probability that the relative favoriteAwins
21:733:41863:24:24:72:487:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is more than12. These two forces lead to the perverse negative correlation found above.
21:734:41950:24:24:89:539:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The risk-love class fails here because it insists that the same risk-penalty be priced into all bets
21:735:42050:24:24:72:540:110:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of a given risk, regardless of the pool from which the bets are drawn. Yet exotic bets with middling
21:736:42150:24:0:72:540:86:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:risk—relative to the other bets available in a given pool—do not tend to attract large risk-penalties,

22:753:42865:12:12:90:522:352:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:odds of the longshot, (c) the odds of the quinella, and (d) all interactions of (a), (b) and (c).  The plot shows

22:759:43433:24:23:71:539:209:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:payingQ/1).  Thus, we can include a full set of fixed effects forOA,OB,Q and their interactions
22:760:43528:23:24:71:540:186:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in our statistical tests of the predictions of each class.18The residual after differencing out these
22:761:43629:24:24:71:539:162:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fixed effects is the predicted likelihood thatAbeatsB, relative to the average for all races in which
22:762:43730:24:24:71:539:138:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a horses at odds ofOA/1 andOB/1 fill the quinella at oddsQ/1. That is, for all races we compute
22:763:43825:24:19:71:540:114:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the predictions of the likelihood that exacta with the relative favorite winning (AB) occurs, and
22:764:43922:19:15:82:539:95:7:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:18Because the oddsOA,OBandQare actually continuous variables, we include fixed effects for each percentile of
22:765:44031:15:0:71:405:80:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the distribution of each variable (and a full set of interactions of these fixed effects).

23:767:44219:24:24:71:539:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to the fixed effects. The results, summarized in Figure 5, are remarkably robust to the inclusion of
23:768:44319:24:24:71:539:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:these multiple fixed effects (and interactions): the coefficient on the misperceptions class declines
23:769:44420:24:24:71:539:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:slightly, and insignificantly, while the risk-love class maintains a significant but perversely negative
23:770:44524:24:24:71:539:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:correlation with outcomes. It should be clear that this test, by focusing only on the relative rankings
23:771:44627:24:24:71:539:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of the first two horses, entirely eliminates parametric assumptions about the race for second place.
23:772:44727:24:24:89:539:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:These tests imply that a model from the risk-love class that accounts for the pricing of win bets
23:773:44824:24:24:71:539:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:yields inaccurate implications for the relative pricing of exacta and quinella bets. By contrast, the
23:774:44925:24:24:71:539:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:misperceptions class is consistent with the pricing of exacta, quinella and trifecta bets, and, as this
23:775:45028:24:24:71:539:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:section shows, also consistent with the relative pricing of exacta and quinella bets.  These results
23:776:45128:24:55:71:391:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:are robust to a range of different approaches to testing the theories.
23:777:45198:55:36:71:179:413:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:6  Conclusion
23:778:45211:36:24:71:539:377:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Employing a new dataset which is much larger than those in the existing literature, we document
23:779:45306:24:24:71:539:353:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:stylized  facts  about  the  rates  of  return  to  betting  on  horses.   As  with  other  authors,  we  note  a
23:780:45419:24:24:71:539:329:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:substantial favorite-longshot bias.  The term bias is somewhat misleading here.  That the rate of
23:781:45516:24:24:71:539:305:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:return  to  betting  on  horses  at  long  odds  is  much  lower  than  the  return  to  betting  on  favorites
23:782:45627:24:23:71:539:281:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:simply falsifies a model in which bettors maximize a function that is linear in probabilities and
23:783:45724:23:24:71:539:258:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:linear in payoffs.  Thus, the pricing of win bets can be reconciled by a representative bettor with
23:784:45823:24:24:71:539:234:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:either a concave utility function, or a subjective utility function employing non-linear probability
23:785:45923:24:24:71:539:210:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:weights  that  violate  the  reduction  of  compound  lotteries.   For  compactness,  we  referred  to  the
23:786:46030:24:24:71:539:186:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:former as explaining the data with risk-love, while we refer to the latter as explaining the data with
23:787:46132:24:24:71:539:162:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:misperceptions.  Neither label is particularly accurate as each category includes a wider range of
23:788:46230:24:24:71:165:138:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:competing theories.
23:789:46249:24:24:89:539:114:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We show that these classes of models can be separately identified using aggregate data by re-
23:790:46342:24:0:71:539:90:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:quiring that they explain both choices over betting on different horses to win and choices over
24:791:46439:0:24:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:compound bets:  exactas,  quinellas and trifectas.   Because the underlying risk or set of beliefs,
24:792:46538:24:24:72:540:684:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:depending on the theory, is traded in both the win and compound betting markets, we can derive
24:793:46632:24:24:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:unique testable implications from both sets of theories.  Our results are more consistent with the
24:794:46730:24:24:72:540:636:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:favorite-longshot bias being driven by misperceptions rather than risk-love.  Indeed, while each
24:795:46826:24:24:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:class is individually quite useful for pricing compound lotteries, the misperceptions class strongly
24:796:46926:24:24:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:dominates the risk-love class.  This result is robust to a range of alternative approaches to distin-
24:797:47027:24:24:72:217:564:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:guishing between the theories.
24:798:47057:24:24:89:539:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This bias likely persists in equilibrium because misperceptions are not large enough to generate
24:799:47153:24:24:72:540:516:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:profit opportunities for unbiased bettors. That said, the cost of this bias is also very large, and de-
24:800:47256:24:0:72:441:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:biasing an individual bettor could reduce their cost of gambling substantially.

25:802:47351:27:15:72:540:681:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Our dataset consists of all horse races run in North America from 1992 to 2001. The data was gen-
25:803:47448:15:14:72:540:666:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:erously provided to us by Axcis Inc., a subsidiary of the jockey club. The data record performance
25:804:47546:14:15:72:540:652:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of every horse in each of its starts, and contains the universe of officially recorded variables having
25:805:47649:15:14:72:379:637:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to do with the horses themselves, the tracks and race conditions.
25:806:47714:14:15:89:539:623:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Our concern is with the pricing of bets.  Thus, our primary sample consists of the 6,403,712
25:807:47806:15:14:72:540:608:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:observations in 865,934 races for which win odds and finishing positions are recorded.  We use
25:808:47900:14:14:72:540:594:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:these data, subject to the data cleaning restrictions below, to generate Figures 1–3 and 5.  We are
25:809:47999:14:15:72:540:580:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:also interested in pricing exacta, quinella and trifectas bets and have data on the winning payoffs
25:810:48098:15:14:72:540:565:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in 314,977, 116,307 and 282,576 races respectively.  The prices of non-winning combinations are
25:811:48193:14:15:72:135:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:not recorded.
25:812:48206:15:14:89:539:536:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Due to the size of our dataset, whenever observations were problematic, we simply dropped
25:813:48295:14:15:72:540:522:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the entire race from our dataset. Specifically, if a race has more than one horse owned by the same
25:814:48394:15:14:72:540:507:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:owner, rather than deal with coupled runners, we simply dropped the race.  Additionally, if a race
25:815:48492:14:15:72:540:493:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:had a dead heat for first, second or third place the exacta, quinella and trifecta payouts may not be
25:816:48593:15:14:72:540:478:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:accurately recorded and so we dropped these races. When the odds of any horse were reported as
25:817:48687:14:14:72:540:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:zero we dropped the race. Further if the odds across all runners implied that the track take was less
25:818:48788:14:15:72:540:450:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:than 15% or more than 22%, we dropped the race.  After these steps, we are left with 5,606,336

25:838:49522:45:15:89:539:178:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:As in the text, we derive pricing formulae by imposing that the expected utility of all bets is
25:839:49617:15:14:71:540:163:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:equal.  Consider a horse race which includes horsesA,BandC.  An exacta requires the bettor to
25:840:49710:14:15:71:539:149:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:correctly specify the first two horses, in order. A quinella is a bet on two horses to finish first and
25:841:49813:15:14:71:539:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:second, but the bettor need not specify their order.  A quinella bet on horsesAandBgives odds
25:842:49906:14:14:71:540:120:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f2:QAB. A trifecta is a bet on three horses to finish first, second and third, and the bettor must correctly
25:843:50011:14:15:71:540:106:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:specify their order.  A trifecta bet on horsesA,BandC, in that order, gives oddsTABC.  Thus the
25:844:50106:15:0:72:432:91:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:quinella and trifecta analogues to equations (3) and (4) in the main text are:
