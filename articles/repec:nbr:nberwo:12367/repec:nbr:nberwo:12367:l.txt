2:26:1206:28:14:107:539:595:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:A growing literature offers indirect evidence that the distribution of bargaining power within
2:27:1300:14:14:71:539:581:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:a household influences decisions made by the household. The indirect evidence links household
2:28:1393:14:15:71:539:567:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:outcomes to variables that are assumed to influence the distribution of power within the household.
2:29:1492:15:14:71:539:552:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:In this paper, we have data on whether a husband or wife in the Health and Retirement Study “has
2:30:1588:14:14:71:539:538:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:the  final  say”  when  making  major  decisions  in  a  household.  We  use  this  variable  to  analyze
2:31:1693:14:14:71:539:524:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:determinants and some consequences of bargaining power. Our analysis overcomes endogeneity
2:32:1783:14:14:71:539:510:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:problems arising in many earlier studies and constitutes a missing link confirming the importance
2:33:1880:14:14:71:228:496:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:of household bargaining models.
2:34:1911:14:15:107:539:482:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:We  find  that  decision-making  power  depends  on  plausible  individual  variables  and  also
2:35:2007:15:14:71:539:467:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:influences important household outcomes, with the second set of results much stronger than the first
2:36:2107:14:14:71:539:453:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:set. Current and lifetime earnings have significant but moderate effects on decision-making power.
2:37:2205:14:14:71:539:439:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:On the other hand, decision-making power has important effects on financial decisions like stock
2:38:2301:14:14:71:539:425:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:market investment and total wealth accumulation and may help explain, for example, the relatively
2:39:2398:14:43:71:231:411:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:high poverty rate among widows.

3:53:2681:0:21:71:184:716:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:I.  INTRODUCTION 
3:54:2698:21:21:107:521:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:A growing literature offers indirect evidence that the distribution of bargaining power 
3:55:2786:21:20:71:521:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:within a household influences decisions made by the household.  Yet, earlier papers were not 
3:56:2879:20:21:71:517:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:able to measure actual bargaining power.  We use information from a unique question in the 
3:57:2970:21:21:71:533:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Health and Retirement Study to analyze the determinants and some consequences of bargaining 
3:58:3062:21:20:71:107:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:power. 
3:59:3069:20:21:107:512:592:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Models of household bargaining have two important implications for understanding 
3:60:3150:21:21:71:521:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:individual outcomes.  First, the welfare of household members depends on the distribution of 
3:61:3243:21:20:71:508:550:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bargaining power.  Second, household decisions are not the outcome of a single individual 
3:62:3333:20:21:71:501:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:maximizing utility.  Indirect evidence against “unitary” decision-making links household 
3:63:3422:21:21:71:532:509:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:outcomes to variables that are assumed to influence the distribution of bargaining power within 
3:64:3518:21:21:71:529:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the household.  Such outcomes include the amount and allocation of leisure time, spending (on 
3:65:3612:21:20:71:513:467:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:women’s and children’s clothes versus men’s clothes, on alcohol and tobacco, on food) and 
3:66:3702:20:21:71:325:447:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:domestic violence (including female suicide rates).   
3:67:3756:21:21:107:493:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:However, none of those studies directly show how individual preferences affect 
3:68:3835:21:20:71:533:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:household decisions.  In this paper, we analyze data from the HRS reporting whether a husband 
3:69:3929:20:21:71:536:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or wife has “the final say” when making major decisions.  We interpret the answers as revealing 
3:70:4025:21:21:71:534:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:whose preferences are reflected to a greater degree in household choices.  By directly observing 
3:71:4122:21:20:71:526:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decision-making power, our analysis overcomes endogeneity problems arising in many earlier 
3:72:4213:20:21:71:526:323:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:studies and constitutes the missing link that confirms the importance of household bargaining. 
3:73:4308:21:21:107:512:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To undertake this analysis, we develop an econometric framework and pose a set of 
3:74:4390:21:21:71:517:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intuitive identification assumptions to make use of multiple subjective reports.  We find that 
3:75:4485:21:20:71:536:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decision-making power depends on plausible variables within the household and also influences 
3:76:4579:20:21:71:523:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:important household outcomes.  Moreover, the second set of results is much stronger than the 
3:77:4672:21:21:71:500:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:first set.  Current and lifetime earnings have a significant but only moderate influence on 
3:78:4764:21:20:71:528:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decision-making power.  On the other hand, decision-making power has important effects on a 
3:79:4856:20:21:71:298:178:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sample of financial decisions that we examine. 
3:80:4903:21:21:107:520:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the first set of results, we analyze determinants of whether the husband or wife has 
3:81:4991:21:20:71:520:136:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more decision-making power.  We find that decision-making power depends significantly on 
3:82:5080:20:21:71:535:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relative household earnings, and more so on average lifetime earnings than on current earnings.  
3:83:5177:21:21:71:522:95:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:However, the magnitudes of these estimated effects are only moderate for this older sample – 
3:84:5270:21:0:71:530:74:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:switching average lifetime earnings of husbands and wives reduces the predicted percentage of 
4:85:5365:0:21:71:537:716:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:men reported to have the final say by their wives from 31.1% to 21.6%.  These estimates control 
4:86:5461:21:21:71:517:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for human capital variables that may be correlated with both labor supply and a comparative 
4:87:5553:21:20:71:499:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:advantage in making important decisions.  They also show that cultural factors like race, 
4:88:5643:20:21:71:367:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:religion, and immigrant status affect decision-making power. 
4:89:5704:21:21:107:541:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Next, we show that we can use this data to investigate outcomes that are both novel in the 
4:90:5795:21:20:71:515:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:household bargaining literature and important.  As an example, we investigate two financial 
4:91:5887:20:21:71:515:592:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:outcomes that are well-recorded in the HRS.  When husbands have greater decision-making 
4:92:5975:21:21:71:504:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:power, we find that the household invests significantly and substantially more in equities, 
4:93:6067:21:20:71:531:550:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:controlling for important factors like household wealth and stated risk preferences.  This shows 
4:94:6164:20:21:71:539:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:some practical consequences of evidence found by others that men are less risk averse.   We also 
4:95:6261:21:21:71:533:509:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:find an intriguing twist on the standard life cycle model.  When husbands have the final say, we 
4:96:6358:21:21:71:529:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f5:B:find that household wealth is significantly and substantially higher the older is the husband but 
4:97:6456:21:20:71:542:467:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:not the wife, and when wives have the final say, household wealth is higher the older is the wife.  
4:98:6556:20:21:71:529:447:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Thus, life cycle planning motives appear driven in part by the interests of the spouse in charge. 
4:99:6654:21:21:107:537:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Thus, our conclusions are twofold.  Our results show that household bargaining can have 
4:100:6742:21:20:71:536:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:important effects on the welfare of household members.  For example, the relatively high rate of 
4:101:6839:20:21:71:531:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:poverty among widows may result not only from aggregate longevity shocks, insurance market 
4:102:6930:21:21:71:532:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:failures, and/or poor planning, but also from the nature of household bargaining earlier in life.1  
4:103:7030:21:20:71:502:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This, in turn, has implications for the design of dependent and survivor benefits available 
4:104:7122:20:21:71:532:323:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:through Social Security and for the impact of the shift from annuitized defined benefit pensions 
4:105:7219:21:21:71:533:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to lump-sum defined contribution accounts.  Our results also make it clear that more research is 
4:106:7316:21:21:71:519:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:needed into the determination of bargaining power, as even important variables like earnings 
4:107:7409:21:20:71:392:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:explain relatively little about the distribution of bargaining power.

5:120:8326:21:21:71:514:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:power depends in turn on spouses’ threat points, assumed most often to be their utility from 
5:121:8419:21:20:71:113:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:divorce. 
5:122:8428:20:21:107:519:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Direct tests of such models are hampered by the unobservability of bargaining, threat 
5:123:8514:21:21:71:542:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:points, and the allocation of marital surplus.  Consequently, the empirical literature has employed 
5:124:8614:21:20:71:519:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:indirect tests of implications of unitary decision-making models.  Many of these tests rely on 
5:125:8709:20:21:71:508:592:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:similar identification strategies, which we discuss in the next section, that test the “income 
5:126:8804:21:21:71:510:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pooling” hypothesis.  Under unitary models, the distribution of resources within the family 
5:127:8896:21:20:71:536:550:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:should not influence outcomes like expenditures.  Empirical papers have shown, to the contrary, 
5:128:8992:20:21:71:516:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that variables which are plausibly related to threat points – like spouses’ wages, earnings, or 
5:129:9088:21:21:71:489:509:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unearned income – alter household outcomes over which spouses might have different 
5:130:9171:21:21:71:512:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:preferences – like time spent by spouses on leisure and chores (Friedberg and Webb 2005); 
5:131:9261:21:20:71:511:467:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spending on men’s, women’s, and children’s clothing (Phipps and Burton 1998; Lundberg,

5:138:9744:21:20:107:527:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our approach offers three related advantages over recent studies.  First, we have actual 
5:139:9833:20:21:71:519:309:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:measures of decision-making power.  Since earlier studies lacked such measures, they had to 
5:140:9925:21:21:71:532:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assume that the variables they studied influenced the distribution of bargaining power and were 
5:141:10021:21:20:71:498:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:influenced by it.  We do not have to assume any indirect relationships.  Thus, our results 
5:142:10112:20:21:71:528:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:constitute strong new evidence in favor of household bargaining models and about the specific 
5:143:10206:21:21:71:174:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nature of bargaining. 
5:144:10228:21:20:107:511:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Second, because we have a measure of bargaining power, we are not constrained as 
5:145:10309:20:21:71:530:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:earlier studies were in choosing outcomes to analyze.  The studies mentioned above jointly test 
5:146:10405:21:21:71:506:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not only income pooling but also that spouses’ preferences differ over the outcomes being 
5:147:10495:21:30:71:521:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:studied.  This is a key reason to study spending on men’s and women’s clothing, for example 
5:148:10587:30:7:71:218:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
5:149:10635:7:16:71:529:106:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:3  In addition, bargaining is an explanation for rejections of standard implications of individual preference axioms 
5:150:10752:16:12:71:532:90:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:using household-level data (McElroy 1981).  Examples include negative price elasticities and violations of Slutsky 
5:151:10867:12:11:71:523:78:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:symmetry.  Proceeding from that, Browning et al (1994) and Browning and Chiappori (1999) found that testable 
5:152:10976:11:0:71:515:67:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:analogs of non-unitary models that assume Pareto efficient allocations within the household were not rejected. 
6:153:11088:0:21:71:529:716:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(notwithstanding possible public good aspects of clothing choices!).  It is less obvious, though, 
6:154:11186:21:21:71:521:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that men and women have different preferences for alcohol and tobacco, food at home versus 
6:155:11277:21:20:71:540:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:away, and children’s well-being.  In contrast, we can directly test which outcomes depend on our 
6:156:11374:20:21:71:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:measure of bargaining power.  While we lack data on many potentially interesting outcomes, and 
6:157:11469:21:21:71:538:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we must condition on appropriate variables as other studies must, we can examine outcomes like 
6:158:11564:21:20:71:483:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:financial behavior which less obviously reflect the preferences of a particular spouse. 
6:159:11652:20:21:107:513:592:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Third, many of the variables which earlier studies used to explain the distribution of 
6:160:11739:21:21:71:541:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bargaining power were arguably endogenous.  To give an extreme but relevant example, it would 
6:161:11833:21:20:71:517:550:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be difficult to believe that omitted factors played no role in explaining a correlation between 
6:162:11929:20:21:71:515:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:religion and spending on clothing, unless we can show (as we do later) that religion directly 
6:163:12023:21:21:71:519:509:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:influences bargaining power.  More importantly, the earnings variation used in many tests of 
6:164:12116:21:21:71:527:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:income pooling is not plausibly separable from the outcomes being explained.  If spouses earn 
6:165:12210:21:20:71:530:467:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more because they work more, that reduces time that is available for home production and may 
6:166:12303:20:21:71:501:447:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:alter spending on clothing, food, children, etc.  Variation in unearned income is similarly 
6:167:12395:21:21:71:534:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:problematic for reasons described by Lundberg and Pollak (1996).  The cleanest evidence, then, 
6:168:12490:21:20:71:522:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:comes from quasi-experiments, but those are limited to particular settings and mostly involve 
6:169:12584:20:21:71:425:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:poor populations (Lundberg, Pollak, and Wales; Duflo; Duflo and Udry).

6:175:12855:21:20:71:471:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:new data every two years.  The HRS reports unprecedented detail about household

6:181:13281:21:30:89:446:143:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:A:retire, where to live, or how much money to spend on a major purchase.”

6:184:13515:16:12:71:519:90:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:that, it was only asked of new entrants to the HRS, a considerably smaller group.  We do not attempt to analyze 
6:185:13627:12:11:71:538:78:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:changes in bargaining power, which would require not only a theory of dynamic bargaining, but also an approach to 
6:186:13741:11:0:71:451:67:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:distinguishing measurement error from true shifts in either bargaining power or reporting bias. 
7:187:13838:0:21:71:540:716:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Individuals could answer that they themselves had the final say, that their spouses did, or that the 
7:188:13939:21:21:71:293:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:division of responsibility was “about equal”.5 
7:189:13985:21:20:107:511:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Because the age range in the HRS is limited, the results are not representative of all 
7:190:14072:20:21:71:524:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:households.  In particular, since they are older and some unhappy marriages will already have 
7:191:14166:21:21:71:529:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ended, the households that we are observing are more harmonious than average.6  On the other 
7:192:14259:21:20:71:533:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hand, the greater marital stability of the sample offers an advantage.  We can view the observed 
7:193:14356:20:21:71:535:592:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:outcomes as the steady state of a repeated game, and cooperative bargaining is more likely to be 
7:194:14453:21:21:71:244:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sustained than in a one-shot game.7

7:197:14542:20:22:107:433:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We took the following steps in selecting our sample from the HRS: 
7:198:14608:22:22:89:331:494:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f3:A:∑  the HRS interviewed 7,607 households in 1992 
7:199:14656:22:22:89:333:472:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f3:A:∑  we selected couples, yielding a sample of 5,090 
7:200:14707:22:22:89:489:450:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f3:A:∑  we eliminated couples with no financial information, yielding a sample of 5,036 
7:201:14790:22:22:89:449:428:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f3:A:∑  we eliminated couples who were cohabiting, yielding a sample of 4,815 
7:202:14863:22:21:89:541:406:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f3:A:∑  we eliminated couples in which at least one spouse did not answer the bargaining question, 
7:203:14957:21:21:89:248:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:yielding a final sample of 4,237. 
7:204:14991:21:21:107:514:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Table 1 shows the distribution of decision making power in our sample, and Table 2 
7:205:15074:21:20:71:492:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shows other sample statistics.  In Table 1, both spouses report that husbands have more 
7:206:15162:20:21:71:517:323:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bargaining power, on average.  When husbands answered the first question above (as shown 
7:207:15251:21:21:71:521:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:across the bottom of the upper panel), 30.6% reported having the final say, 57.6% said it was 
7:208:15345:21:21:71:525:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:about equal, and 11.8% reported that the wife had the final say.  When the 30.6% of husbands 
7:209:15438:21:32:71:523:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with the final say answered the second question above (as shown in the lower panel), roughly

7:211:15579:7:16:71:539:221:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:5  People were asked a follow-up question if they did not answer “about equal”:  either, “Do you have a lot more say 
7:212:15696:16:12:71:516:205:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:than your (husband/ wife/ partner), somewhat more, or only a little more?”, or, vice versa.  The answers to this 
7:213:15809:12:11:71:507:193:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:second question did not provide us with significant additional information.  In ordered probits, the estimated 
7:214:15920:11:12:71:508:182:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:threshold values are not significantly different from each other when we try to explain answers to the second 
7:215:16030:12:7:71:497:170:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:question, but they are when we try to explain answers to the first question in the estimates we report later. 
7:216:16140:7:16:71:526:163:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:6  While the value of observed marriages in the HRS should be higher than the value of a representative marriage 
7:217:16253:16:11:71:540:147:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:and thus disagreement should be less likely, this does not have clear-cut implications about the observed distribution 
7:218:16372:11:12:71:535:136:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:of bargaining power relative to the underlying distribution for all couples.  We find that controlling for the duration 
7:219:16492:12:11:71:519:124:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:of marriage has no impact on the other coefficient estimates.  Interestingly, we find smaller estimated effects of 
7:220:16607:11:12:71:515:113:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:earnings on bargaining power in second marriages, perhaps because people enter a second marriage with more 
7:221:16714:12:7:71:320:101:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:information about the likely distribution of bargaining power. 
7:222:16777:7:16:71:507:94:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:7  Because we find significant effects later on, we believe that these answers are informative.  Thus, it seems 
7:223:16889:16:11:71:511:78:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:unlikely that one spouse has more power but delegates decision-making to the other spouse, knowing that the 
7:224:16997:11:0:71:248:67:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:decisions will reflect their own preferences. 
8:225:17044:0:21:71:516:716:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:one-quarter reported having a lot more say, and the rest reported having somewhat or a little 
8:226:17138:21:21:71:121:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more say. 
8:227:17148:21:20:107:536:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The marginal distribution of wives’ answers to the first question is similar to husbands’.  
8:228:17240:20:21:71:526:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:16.0% of wives reporting that they themselves have the final say, 52.7% answering that it was 
8:229:17334:21:21:71:418:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:about equal, and 31.3% reporting that their husbands have the final say. 
8:230:17407:21:20:71:514:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Disagreements are apparent in the off-diagonal cells in the upper panel of Table 1.  Spouses 
8:231:17500:20:21:71:535:592:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:agreed on the answer 63.3% of the time.  84.2% of the disagreements occurred in adjacent cells, 
8:232:17596:21:21:71:519:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:while the rest involved one spouse answering the wife and the other answering the husband.  
8:233:17688:21:20:71:492:550:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:About 2/3 of these adjacent disagreements leaned toward the husband, with one spouse 
8:234:17773:20:21:71:526:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:attributing more power to the husband and the other reporting equal power.  It was also a little 
8:235:17870:21:21:71:540:509:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more common for disagreeing spouses to attribute extra power to themselves relative to the other 
8:236:17967:21:21:71:527:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spouse’s opinion (adding together cells in the lower left) than it was for them to attribute extra 
8:237:18066:21:20:71:319:467:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:power to the other spouse (cells in the upper right).

8:239:18120:14:21:71:237:433:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:IV.  EMPIRICAL APPROACH 
8:240:18144:21:20:107:524:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We interpret answers to the question about decision-making power as revealing which 
8:241:18228:20:21:71:542:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spouse’s preferences are reflected to a greater degree in household decisions.8  However, we treat 
8:242:18327:21:21:71:516:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the answers as noisy measures of true decision-making power, both because the answers are 
8:243:18417:21:21:71:519:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:discrete and because of the disagreements revealed in Table 1.  Moreover, disagreements are 
8:244:18509:21:20:71:508:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:correlated with some of our important explanatory variables in the results we present later. 
8:245:18602:20:21:107:530:309:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In this section, we offer an econometric framework that suggests intuitive identification 
8:246:18692:21:21:71:513:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assumptions to disentangle these features.  We first present a framework to deal with noisy, 
8:247:18785:21:20:71:498:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:continuous measures of bargaining power, and then noisy, discrete measures.  While the 
8:248:18872:20:21:71:536:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:identification assumptions influence the interpretation of the reported coefficient estimates, they 
8:249:18972:21:21:71:503:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are not actually imposed in the process of estimation, so uninterested readers can proceed 
8:250:19063:21:20:71:326:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:directly to the next section for the estimation results.

8:252:19120:15:20:71:522:170:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:A.  Estimating the determinants of noisy continuous measures of true bargaining power 
8:253:19206:20:7:71:218:150:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
8:254:19254:7:17:71:535:143:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:8  Household theory has emphasized the generalized Nash model of cooperative bargaining, in which the allocation 
8:255:19367:17:13:71:515:126:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:of resources (Uh, Uw) maximizes (Uh-Rh)q(Uw-Rw)1-q, where Rj are reservation values and 0<q<1 is h’s relative 
8:256:19477:13:12:71:524:113:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:bargaining weight.  The equilibrium allocation Uj  will depend on R and q, and we view our measure of decision-
8:257:19588:12:11:71:517:101:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:making power (which we also refer to on occasion as “bargaining power”) as an amalgam of Rh,  Rw, and q.  In 
8:258:19697:11:12:71:539:90:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:comparison, empirical tests of income pooling seek to determine whether components of R influence components of 
8:259:19809:12:11:71:515:78:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f3:F:U.  A natural extension of our work would be to incorporate additional information and estimate the full Nash-
8:260:19919:11:0:71:454:67:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:bargaining model, as several papers have done in labor market settings (cf. Flinn forthcoming). 
9:261:20016:0:21:107:541:716:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We assume for the moment that spouses report continuous (rather than discrete) measures 
9:262:20104:21:21:71:509:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of bargaining power.  We will focus first on determining how bargaining power, measured 
9:263:20192:21:20:71:502:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:continuously, depends on household characteristics and then how it influences household 
9:264:20280:20:21:71:540:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:outcomes.  We will denote true bargaining power of a husband relative to his wife in household i 
9:265:20376:21:21:71:482:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by yi*.  We will treat true bargaining power yi* as a function of observables X and an 
9:266:20463:21:21:71:262:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:uncorrelated homoscedastic error term: 
9:267:20502:21:22:143:256:591:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:(1) yi* = Xia + ui . 
9:268:20523:22:20:71:536:569:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f5:B:We do not observe yi* but rather the belief yji* about true bargaining power that each spouse j = 
9:269:20621:20:22:71:340:549:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:{h,w} in household i reports.  We write these beliefs as  
9:270:20679:22:22:143:295:527:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:(2a) ywi* = yi* + Xibw + uwi  
9:271:20707:22:21:143:294:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:(2b) yhi* = yi* + Xibh + uhi , 
9:272:20737:21:22:71:541:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:so j’s report about the husband’s relative bargaining power depends on his true bargaining power 
9:273:20834:22:21:71:496:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:but also on some reporting bias Xibj and another uncorrelated homoscedastic error term. 
9:274:20922:21:20:107:518:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Before proceeding with estimation issues, we will clarify some important identifying 
9:275:21007:20:21:71:500:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assumptions that lie behind (1)-(2b).  First, the model assumes that the “true” measure of 
9:276:21098:21:21:71:544:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decision-making power yi*, rather than the reported measures yji*, influence household decisions.  
9:277:21197:21:20:71:509:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Otherwise, we might have to consider a model of multi-dimensional bargaining in order to 
9:278:21286:20:21:71:523:359:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reconcile conflicting reports that are both true.9  Second, the model assumes specific forms of 
9:279:21382:21:21:71:504:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:heterogeneity in how everyone reports yji*.  Answers may disagree or not as a function of 
9:280:21472:21:21:71:525:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:observables and error terms, but it assumes that couples whose answers disagree or not do not 
9:281:21566:21:20:71:464:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fundamentally differ in either how they answer the question or how they bargain. 
9:282:21647:20:22:107:533:276:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To proceed, we can rewrite each spouse’s report of bargaining power in (2a) and (2b) as 
9:283:21735:22:22:107:317:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:  ywi* = Xi (a+bw) + ui + uwi  
9:284:21762:22:21:107:316:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:  yhi* = Xi (a+bh) + ui + uhi , 
9:285:21791:21:22:71:352:211:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:but, of course, we can only estimate the empirical analogs 
9:286:21850:22:25:143:272:189:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:(3a) ywi* = Xi bw + wiu~ 
9:287:21874:25:24:143:274:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:(3b) yhi* = Xi bh + hiu~ . 
9:288:21901:24:22:71:530:140:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Thus, we have an identification problem since bj = a + bj combines the “true effect” a of X on 
9:289:21996:22:0:71:325:118:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:y* and the “reporting bias” bj also engendered by X. 
10:290:22050:0:22:107:464:715:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In order to identify the true effect a, we propose the following restriction: 
10:291:22128:22:21:71:245:693:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:  (4) bh + bw = 0 . 
10:292:22146:21:21:71:534:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This condition requires that any disagreements between spouses about true bargaining power be 
10:293:22240:21:21:71:464:651:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equal and opposite in sign, so that they balance out on average across the sample. 
10:294:22323:21:20:107:510:630:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This restriction is an intuitive extension of the assumption that respondents provide 
10:295:22409:20:21:71:513:610:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unbiased information.  As an example, consider our result later that a wife’s (W’s) earnings 
10:296:22502:21:21:71:525:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reduces her husband’s (H’s) bargaining power but by amounts that are disagreed on.  Suppose 
10:297:22594:21:20:71:540:568:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that higher W’s earnings reduce true yi by an average of 0.5.  A symmetric disagreement arises if 
10:298:22692:20:21:71:529:548:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:higher W’s earnings lead Ws to claim a greater drop and Hs to claim a smaller drop.  If instead 
10:299:22788:21:21:71:527:527:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:they disagreed in the same direction (e.g., Hs and Ws report average reductions of 0.6 and 0.7, 
10:300:22884:21:21:71:526:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:respectively), then we could not identify the true effect on bargaining power (which we would 
10:301:22978:21:20:71:500:485:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:infer lies between 0.6 and 0.7) from this systematic reporting bias.  Instead, we infer that 
10:302:23071:20:21:71:519:465:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:anything that moves both spouses’ reports in the same direction is the truth.  Similarly, if the 
10:303:23168:21:21:71:511:444:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:disagreement were opposite in direction but not symmetric (e.g., Hs and Ws report average 
10:304:23258:21:20:71:523:423:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reductions of 0.4 and 0.7), then we would correctly infer that the truth lies in between 0.4 and 
10:305:23355:20:21:71:512:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:0.7, but we would incorrectly infer where.10  This assumption makes sense as long as, once 
10:306:23446:21:21:71:423:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:again, both spouses interpret the question in the same way, on average.11 
10:307:23519:21:21:107:511:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Once we estimate (3a) and (3b) and then impose (4), we can recover the underlying 
10:308:23601:21:22:71:458:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parameters of interest.  Since bh = a + bh and bw = a + bw, it can be shown that 
10:309:23682:22:22:71:257:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:  (5a) a = (bh + bw)/2 
10:310:23702:22:38:71:322:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:  (5b) bj = bj - a = bj - (bh + bw)/2 . 
10:311:23740:38:7:71:542:258:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:                                                                                                                                                             
10:312:23896:7:16:71:535:251:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:9  In such a model, spouses might report different answers because they engage in distinct bargaining over different 
10:313:24013:16:12:71:515:235:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:decisions.  Such models are theoretically intractable and would be difficult to identify using our data, since we 
10:314:24127:12:8:71:475:223:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:would not know what “sphere” of bargaining each spouse has in mind when answering the question. 
10:315:24223:8:7:71:465:215:8:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f6:F:10  We could generalize (4) by incorporating asymmetric effects of X on disagreement, such that b
10:316:24320:7:11:466:511:208:6:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:h+bw = b   
10:317:24331:11:12:71:536:197:11:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f3:F:" |bj|  ≥ |b| .  This allows bh and bw to differ in magnitude as long as they also differ in sign but does not yield point 
10:318:24451:12:13:71:530:185:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:identification of a and bj.  If we suspected that an element of X had a greater effect on one spouse’s reporting bias 
10:319:24569:13:13:71:539:172:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:than on the other’s, then b > 0 and we would know that the estimate of aˆ was an upper bound on the true a.  Also, 
10:320:24684:13:12:71:538:159:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:we could determine how large b (the asymmetry of disagreement) would have to be in order to undermine inference 
10:321:24796:12:7:71:171:147:10:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:about the true sign of a. 
10:322:24821:7:16:71:533:140:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:11  The HRS reported whether the other spouse was present and intervened much during an individual’s interview.  
10:323:24934:16:11:71:540:124:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:We find that wives are much more likely to be present for their husband’s interviews, and that a spouse’s presence is 
10:324:25052:11:12:71:530:113:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:not systematically related to reported bargaining power.  The theoretical implication is ambiguous – a spouse with

10:326:25279:11:12:71:514:90:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:of indirect control that makes intervention unnecessary.  When we try controlling for the presence of the other 
10:327:25391:12:11:71:528:78:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:spouse in the estimation, there is little qualitative impact on the estimated effect of earnings, which is our primary 
10:328:25510:11:0:71:521:67:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:interest.  It alters the estimated effect of some demographic and cultural variables (i.e., race, religion, children).  
11:329:25631:0:27:71:538:713:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Thus, our estimate of the true effect aˆ equals the average of hbˆ and wbˆ, and our estimate of the

11:335:25928:29:21:71:525:632:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hence the estimating equations (3a)-(3b) are correlated.13  We test this hypothesis later on and 
11:336:26025:21:20:71:345:611:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:find a large, positive, statistically significant correlation.

11:339:26174:21:20:107:536:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Using noisy measures of bargaining power also affects how we interpret estimates of the

11:343:26530:21:21:71:160:473:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:error term, so that

11:345:26577:21:22:71:273:431:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We can substitute (2a) and (2b) to obtain

11:348:26696:21:29:71:260:366:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and then add these together to arrive at

11:366:27065:22:21:71:368:203:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:ywi* in the estimation cancels out the disagreement effects bj.

11:370:27177:8:16:71:523:141:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:12  In this framework, we cannot identify the true effect a by limiting the sample to couples who report the same 
11:371:27291:16:12:71:520:125:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:answers for y.  It is not the case that such couples have no reporting bias, but rather that their reporting errors uji 
11:372:27410:12:12:71:522:113:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:happen to offset their reporting bias Xibj, that they have systematically lower values of variables associated with 
11:373:27526:12:11:71:528:101:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:high reporting bias and vice versa, etc.  With that in mind, we will mention the effect of limiting the sample when 
11:374:27642:11:7:71:227:90:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:we present the estimation results later. 
11:375:27683:7:16:71:539:83:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:13  We cannot identify a correlation between the disturbance in the true equation (1) and the reporting equations (2a)-
11:376:27802:16:0:71:454:67:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:(2b) without making a further assumption, analogous to (4), about the nature of the correlation.

12:378:27986:21:21:107:530:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:At this point, we will address the fact that our observed reports of bargaining power are 
12:379:28076:21:20:71:527:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:discrete rather than continuous.  In order to estimate the determinants of bargaining power, we 
12:380:28172:20:21:71:534:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:continue to assume that (1)-(2b) hold, with yji* now being some underlying continuous measure 
12:381:28266:21:21:71:226:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that we only observe discretely: 
12:382:28299:21:23:143:533:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:(9) yji = {husband has final say, about equal, wife has final say} = {1, 0, -1}  
12:383:28380:23:24:71:519:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Assuming further that jiu~~ ),(N20s yields an ordered probit framework that is the discrete 
12:384:28472:24:21:71:532:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:choice analog to (3a) and (3b), where the contribution of each possible outcome of yji to the log 
12:385:28570:21:22:71:177:544:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:likelihood function is 
12:386:28593:22:22:71:302:522:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f5:B:  (10) P(yji = -1) = F(m0 - Xibj) 
12:387:28625:22:22:71:366:500:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:C:   P(yji = 0) = F(m1 - Xibj)  - F(m0 - Xibj) 
12:388:28667:22:22:71:320:478:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:   P(yji = 1) = 1 - F(m1 - Xibj) , 
12:389:28699:22:21:71:533:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and m0 and m1 are threshold values to be estimated.  Since the relationship bj = a + bj continues 
12:390:28797:21:22:71:539:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to hold, then, after imposing (4), the same conditions (5a) and (5b) govern identification.  Lastly, 
12:391:28898:22:24:71:537:413:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we will estimate a bivariate ordered probit that allows the errors jiu~ to be correlated for spouses 
12:392:28999:24:21:71:488:389:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:j within a household i.  Such a correlation may be expected if spouses share important 
12:393:29086:21:21:71:508:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:characteristics that influence both bargaining and reports about bargaining and that are not 
12:394:29179:21:21:71:173:347:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:observed in the data. 
12:395:29201:21:20:107:499:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:When we consider estimating the consequences of our noisy, discrete measure of 
12:396:29280:20:21:71:538:306:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bargaining power, the estimation strategy outlined in (8) becomes more complicated since we do 
12:397:29375:21:22:71:486:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not observe the continuous variables yji*.  We deal with this using three approaches.14 
12:398:29462:22:24:89:540:263:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f3:A:∑  We try a two-stage procedure:  first, estimate the ordered probits that determine bargaining 
12:399:29558:24:25:89:513:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:power as laid out in (3a) and (3b) and obtain the predicted values *yˆji = jibˆX; second, 
12:400:29648:25:20:89:542:214:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:substitute those into (8) and estimate the impact of bargaining power.  The difficulty with this 
12:401:29745:20:46:89:486:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:approach is in determining how to adjust the standard errors in the second stage.15 
12:402:29828:46:8:71:218:148:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
12:403:29876:8:16:71:500:140:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:14  Another approach which we will not use would be a joint estimation strategy that allows the error terms 
12:404:29984:16:11:71:522:124:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:determining yhi*, ywi*, and zi to be correlated.  This approach would get rapidly more complicated as we analyze 
12:405:30097:11:7:71:388:113:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:additional outcomes z, though, so we limit the joint estimation to yhi* and ywi*. 
12:406:30179:7:16:71:533:106:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:15  Maddala (1983, Section 8.8) lays out estimators and, in some cases, covariance matrices for related examples in 
12:407:30295:16:12:71:534:90:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:which the first and/or second stages are specified discretely.  None pertain directly to the situation here, and for the 
12:408:30416:12:11:71:535:78:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:most similar cases, he notes, “The derivation of the asymptotic covariance matrix of the two-stage estimates is very 
12:409:30533:11:28:71:427:67:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:complicated and will not be attempted here,” (pp.245, 246).  We do not attempt it either. 
13:410:30625:28:0:312:315:39:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A: 
13:411:30625:0:21:89:495:715:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f3:A:∑  We also try a more efficient alternative with correct standard errors, derived from 
13:412:30712:21:21:89:510:694:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Amemiya (1979) and described in detail in the Appendix:  first, estimate the first-stage 
13:413:30801:21:21:89:535:673:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:relationship in (3a) and (3b) as described above; second, estimate the reduced form obtained 
13:414:30894:21:20:89:529:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:from substituting the determinants of yji*, as laid out in (3a) and (3b), into the second-stage 
13:415:30990:20:21:89:541:632:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:relationship in (8); third, estimate the structural parameters of the impact of bargaining power 
13:416:31087:21:22:89:307:611:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:based on the resulting parameter restrictions. 
13:417:31134:22:21:89:521:589:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f3:A:∑  Lastly, we try a non-structural alternative that controls for the raw answers on decision-
13:418:31227:21:20:89:528:568:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:making power.  This approach does not rely on the functional form represented by (1)-(2b) 
13:419:31317:20:21:89:535:548:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:that we assumed in the first stage, but it revives the difficulty of extracting information from 
13:420:31414:21:21:89:375:527:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:the discrete and sometimes conflicting answers of spouses. 
13:421:31473:21:22:107:528:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Using either of the structural approaches, we now face an additional constraint because

13:423:31655:25:22:71:541:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Therefore, we must exclude one or more elements of X so that we can identify the impact g of yi* 
13:424:31751:22:20:71:537:437:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on z.16  To this end, we will argue that total household earnings should affect outcomes z that we

13:429:32018:20:21:107:523:341:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In this section, we analyze the empirical determinants of decision-making power.  We 
13:430:32103:21:21:71:522:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimate bivariate ordered probits on both spouses’ answers yji about decision-making power,

13:433:32390:21:21:71:488:258:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:To test this, we explore the impact of current and past earnings and other labor market

13:435:32490:20:21:107:521:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The HRS offers a great deal of information to control for other factors that may affect 
13:436:32578:21:21:71:528:196:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:both threat points and decision making.  For example, a spouse who is “savvier” than the other 
13:437:32673:21:27:71:536:175:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:may be more likely to work and make major decisions, inducing a spurious correlation.  To deal 
13:438:32768:27:8:71:219:148:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
13:439:32816:8:16:71:523:140:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:16  If we observed the continuous values yji*, then the variation in reported bargaining power that is uncorrelated 
13:440:32932:16:7:71:250:124:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:with X would identify the impact of y* on z. 
13:441:32977:7:16:71:522:117:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:17  Pollak (2005) laid out the case that the wage, rather than earnings, is the appropriate proxy for the bargaining 
13:442:33094:16:11:71:534:101:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:threat point, as hours of work may differ across bargaining equilibria.  Measuring the marginal wage accurately for 
13:443:33210:11:12:71:530:90:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:this age group proved difficult, though, as salaried jobs are the norm.  Moreover, total earnings might better proxy 
13:444:33327:12:11:71:540:78:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:the threat point in this case, since hours adjustments are difficult at this age; for example, a non-working spouse may 
13:445:33447:11:0:71:535:67:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:find it difficult at this age  to exercise what earlier was a legitimate threat to earn a high wage by returning to work. 
14:446:33571:0:21:71:527:716:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with this, we control for each spouse’s human capital as reflected by education, cognition, and 
14:447:33667:21:21:71:525:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:health.18  Cultural background and social norms may be correlated with both threat points and 
14:448:33761:21:20:71:509:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decision-making power, so we control for numerous background variables – race, hispanic 
14:449:33849:20:21:71:528:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ethnicity, immigrant status, religious background, and father and mother’s education.  We find 
14:450:33944:21:21:71:514:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that many of these variables have statistically significant effects on decision-making power, 
14:451:34038:21:20:71:431:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:although ethnic variables also have the strongest effects on disagreements. 
14:452:34114:20:14:71:77:592:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:  
14:453:34116:14:21:71:321:578:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:B:A.  The impact of husband’s and wife’s earnings 
14:454:34163:21:21:107:490:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We show estimation results for various specifications of labor market variables 
14:455:34243:21:20:71:536:536:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(including current earnings, earnings histories, and others) in bivariate ordered probits estimated 
14:456:34343:20:21:71:506:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:jointly on both spouses’ responses.  Throughout these specifications, we obtain a positive, 
14:457:34435:21:21:71:518:495:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:significant correlation coefficient of around 0.45.19  Thus, conditioning on observables, both 
14:458:34530:21:20:71:472:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spouses agree about who has decision-making power on average, but not perfectly. 
14:459:34611:20:21:107:535:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:After reviewing various specifications, we will decompose the parameter estimates from 
14:460:34698:21:21:71:534:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:some preferred specifications into the “true” and the “disagreement” or “bias” effects that result 
14:461:34797:21:21:71:493:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from imposing (4).  Then, we will discuss the magnitude of the estimated effects on the 
14:462:34885:21:24:71:532:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:distribution of decision-making power.  In the meantime, recall that the estimated effect aˆ of a 
14:463:34983:24:23:71:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variable on true decision-making power equals the average of its estimated effects hbˆ and wbˆ on 
14:464:35081:23:22:71:519:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:husbands’ and wives’ reports, which we discuss next.  Also, the importance of any particular 
14:465:35174:22:24:71:541:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variable can be gauged by comparing its coefficient to the estimated threshold values 0mˆ and 1mˆ, 
14:466:35273:24:21:71:142:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:based on (10). 
14:467:35288:21:20:107:533:277:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:A:Current earnings (Table 3-A).  We generally find that earnings have a significant effect 
14:468:35377:20:21:71:486:257:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on decision-making power.  In our first set of results, a wife’s current annual earnings 
14:469:35466:21:21:71:513:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:significantly lower both spouses’ reports of the husband’s decision-making power (with the 
14:470:35557:21:21:71:516:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:impact on her husband’s and her own report shown in columns (1) and (2), respectively).  A 
14:471:35648:21:23:71:511:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:husband’s earnings also significantly raise his wife’s report of his decision-making power.  
14:472:35741:23:8:71:218:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
14:473:35789:8:16:71:538:163:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:18  We use two of three measures of cognition reported in the HRS.  The first, V5105, began, “Next, I'll read a set of 
14:474:35908:16:11:71:536:147:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:20 words and ask you to recall as many as you can.  We have purposely made the list long so that it will be difficult 
14:475:36026:11:12:71:539:136:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:for anyone to recall all the words – most people recall just a few.”  We use the number that was answered correctly.  
14:476:36144:12:11:71:512:124:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:We also used V5113, which adds together the number of fully or partially correct answers to a series of seven 
14:477:36254:11:12:71:518:113:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:questions.  A third variable, V5126, had little explanatory power in our estimates.  For missing observations on 
14:478:36367:12:7:71:444:101:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:cognition, we used hot-deck imputation with income and education as explanatory variables. 
14:479:36458:7:16:71:535:94:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:19  This exceeds the raw correlation coefficient of 0.36.  We used univariate coefficient estimates as starting values, 
14:480:36578:16:11:71:514:78:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:and they consistently yielded a higher log likelihood than did many alternatives that we tried.  Most parameter 
14:481:36690:11:0:71:500:67:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:estimates, including those on earnings, were very similar across the univariate and bivariate specifications. 
15:482:36802:0:21:71:524:716:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Interestingly, a wife’s earnings matter several times more than a husband’s in explaining both 
15:483:36897:21:21:71:521:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reports, while earnings of both spouses affect the wife’s report by about twice as much as the 
15:484:36992:21:20:71:134:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:husband’s.20 
15:485:37004:20:21:107:511:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We can also attribute pension income to each spouse.  Though the estimates are not 
15:486:37087:21:21:71:541:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:statistically significant, each spouse’s pension income from earlier jobs and pension participation 
15:487:37187:21:20:71:537:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in a current job affect reported decision-making power with the same signs as earnings in almost 
15:488:37284:20:21:71:470:592:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:all cases.  Once again a wife’s pension has a much greater effect than a husband’s. 
15:489:37368:21:21:107:539:571:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:A:Earnings histories (Table 3-B).  The HRS provides restricted information about earnings 
15:490:37456:21:20:71:519:550:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:histories reported by the Social Security Administration for 1951 to 1991.  We computed the 
15:491:37548:20:21:71:523:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:average annualized present value of past annual earnings over this period and substituted it in 
15:492:37644:21:21:71:539:509:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:place of current earnings on the right-hand side.  We have this data for 77% of the couples in our 
15:493:37743:21:21:71:213:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:original estimation sample.21 
15:494:37772:21:20:107:529:467:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We find that average past earnings in column (2) have a substantially greater impact on 
15:495:37860:20:21:71:507:447:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decision-making power than current earnings in (1) do.  The estimated effect of husbands’ 
15:496:37950:21:21:71:505:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:earnings roughly doubles, though it is statistically insignificant, while the effect of wives’ 
15:497:38045:21:20:71:515:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:earnings triples and is highly significant.  In column (3), we seek to distinguish the effect of 
15:498:38142:20:21:71:535:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:current earnings and a measure of human capital, as indicated by average earnings over the ages 
15:499:38238:21:21:71:511:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of 22-45.  In this specification, wives’ current and average earnings affect her report, while 
15:500:38333:21:20:71:273:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wives’ current earnings affects his report. 
15:501:38377:20:21:107:521:323:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:A:Other human capital variables (Table 3-A).  There are two ways that skill- and work-
15:502:38461:21:21:71:539:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:related variables might affect decision-making power.  First, they may capture information about 
15:503:38558:21:21:71:542:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:threat points that is not reflected in current earnings, in which case we should consider the effects 
15:504:38660:21:20:71:491:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of these variables alongside that of earnings.  Second, these variables may reflect other 
15:505:38750:20:21:71:495:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:characteristics about the individual which are related to decision-making – for example, 
15:506:38839:21:21:71:541:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assertiveness, that is also associated with self-employment.  In that case, it would be important to 
15:507:38940:21:50:71:353:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:control for them in order to isolate the effect of earnings.   
15:508:39003:50:8:71:218:148:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
15:509:39051:8:16:71:500:140:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:20  If we limit the sample only to couples whose reports agree (which involves a different set of identifying 
15:510:39161:16:11:71:537:124:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:assumptions, as we mentioned earlier), then the estimated earnings coefficients rise by about 1/3.  The biggest gains 
15:511:39279:11:7:71:540:113:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:in parameter estimates occur in those categories – race, ethnicity, national origin – that cause the most disagreement. 
15:512:39399:7:16:71:520:106:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:21  We do not have data for respondents who refused to provide their Social Security number or who provided a 
15:513:39509:16:12:71:541:90:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:number that could not be matched.  We imputed earnings that were topcoded at the Social Security payroll tax limit.  
15:514:39626:12:11:71:527:78:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:If we run the earlier specifications from Table 3-A on the limited sample from Table 3-B, the estimated effects of 
15:515:39741:11:0:71:206:67:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:current earnings are very similar. 
16:516:39778:0:21:107:535:716:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In fact, in later specifications that omit work-related variables, we find very little change 
16:517:39872:21:21:71:533:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the earnings estimates, so neither possibility seems like a major concern.  In the specification 
16:518:39972:21:20:71:542:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in Table 3-A, we find that the effect of skill on bargaining power, as measured by occupation and 
16:519:40070:20:21:71:505:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:education, is sometimes statistically significant and generally monotonic, raising own and 
16:520:40161:21:21:71:509:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reducing a spouse’s decision-making power.  The differential effect of being in the highest 
16:521:40253:21:20:71:526:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:versus the lowest skilled occupation is similar in magnitude to the differential effect of having 
16:522:40351:20:21:71:355:592:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:attended college versus not having completed high school. 
16:523:40409:21:21:107:539:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Being self-employed also has strong effects on one’s reported decision-making power.  If 
16:524:40498:21:20:71:506:550:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the husband is self-employed, it raises his reported power by over one-third more than the 
16:525:40589:20:21:71:535:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:difference between low and high skill does.  It raises his wife’s report of his power, but by less.  
16:526:40690:21:21:71:542:509:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:A wife’s self-employment reduces the husband’s power, but the effects are considerably smaller.  
16:527:40787:21:21:71:540:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Lastly, other human capital variables – cognition, health, parents’ education – have minor effects 
16:528:40886:21:20:71:176:467:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on bargaining power. 
16:529:40907:20:21:107:527:447:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:A:Additional labor market variables (Table 3-C).  We explored additional specifications 
16:530:40993:21:21:71:536:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with different combinations of earnings and other work variables.  These estimates reinforce our 
16:531:41090:21:20:71:356:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:results about the impact of earnings on bargaining power.   
16:532:41150:20:21:107:502:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:By including controls for weekly hours of work in column (1), the coefficients on 
16:533:41232:21:21:71:520:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:earnings can be thought of as isolating the effect of wages on decision-making power.22  The 
16:534:41325:21:20:71:518:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimated effects of a wife’s labor market activities are now split between hours of work and 
16:535:41419:20:21:71:497:323:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:earnings (which represents wages, when controlling for hours), and both are statistically 
16:536:41509:21:21:71:541:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:significant.  Finding an effect of hours of work indicates that wives may “exercise” their threat to 
16:537:41610:21:21:71:399:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:some extent by working, which raises their decision-making power. 
16:538:41676:21:20:107:529:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:As we mentioned earlier, it is difficult to know how to interpret the occupation and self-
16:539:41766:20:21:71:524:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:employment variables in the main specification – they may help measure threat points or they 
16:540:41859:21:21:71:492:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:may capture omitted characteristics correlated with decision-making power.  Thus, it is 
16:541:41947:21:20:71:516:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interesting to note that including simple work dummies in (2) instead of occupation and self-
16:542:42040:20:21:71:529:178:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:employment had little effect on the earnings estimates.  If we, instead, exclude all other human 
16:543:42137:21:21:71:520:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:capital and cultural variables and control only for work-related variables in (3), the estimated 
16:544:42234:21:20:71:536:136:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effects of earnings are a little smaller.  This reduces concerns that wives’ earnings are correlated 
16:545:42335:20:26:71:498:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with cultural variables in ways that undermines conclusions about the effect of earnings. 
16:546:42425:26:7:71:218:90:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
16:547:42473:7:16:71:528:83:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:22  As we noted earlier, measuring the marginal wage accurately for this age group is difficult, as salaried jobs are 
16:548:42591:16:0:71:112:67:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:the norm. 
17:549:42603:0:21:107:537:716:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The last two specifications use transformations of the earnings variables, since we do not 
17:550:42694:21:21:71:535:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:know exactly how earnings affect threat points.  Including the log instead of level of earnings in 
17:551:42793:21:20:71:529:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(4) yields estimated magnitudes of the effects of earnings that are similar.  The specification in 
17:552:42892:20:21:71:506:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(5) indicates that relative as well as absolute earnings influence threat points.  The ratio of 
17:553:42988:21:21:71:523:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:earnings is now significant, while the level of earnings remains statistically significant for the 
17:554:43087:21:20:71:535:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wife’s reported power.  These results show that shifting a wife from having 25% to 75% of total 
17:555:43183:20:21:71:510:592:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:earnings reduces husband’s reported bargaining power by as much as increasing the wife’s 
17:556:43272:21:21:71:175:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:earnings by $25,000. 
17:557:43293:21:14:71:74:550:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: 
17:558:43293:14:20:71:330:536:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:B.  Understanding the estimated effect of earnings 
17:559:43344:20:21:107:515:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In this subsection, we discuss the magnitude of the estimated impact of earnings and 
17:560:43429:21:21:71:523:495:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:other work variables.  First, in Table 4 we present estimates and standard errors (based on the 
17:561:43525:21:20:71:539:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:delta method) of the true effects of all of the covariates on decision-making power, as well as the 
17:562:43625:20:21:71:486:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reporting bias induced by each covariates, based on our identifying assumption in (4). 
17:563:43712:21:21:107:523:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In Table 3-A, the estimated coefficient of wives’ current earnings/10,000 was -0.0356 
17:564:43798:21:20:71:541:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(0.0149) for husbands’ reports and -0.0753 (0.0149) for wives’ reports.  The resulting estimate of 
17:565:43897:20:21:71:522:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the true effect is the average, -0.0555 (0.0126), while the reporting bias is 0.0198 (0.0160) on 
17:566:43994:21:21:71:528:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:husbands’ reports (and -0.0198 on wives’ reports).  Similarly, the true effect of wives’ average 
17:567:44091:21:21:71:538:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:past earnings (at the bottom of Table 4) is -0.01756 (0.0337) and the reporting bias on husbands’ 
17:568:44189:21:20:71:201:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reports is 0.0650 (0.0570). 
17:569:44217:20:21:107:517:309:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Next, we analyze the magnitude of these estimated effects in Table 5.  We do this by 
17:570:44302:21:21:71:517:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:simulating the effect on the distribution of decision-making power of altering husbands’ and 
17:571:44395:21:20:71:538:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wives’ earnings and work status.  We compare the results to a set of baseline predictions that use 
17:572:44494:20:21:71:531:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the estimated coefficients together with everyone’s actual earnings, and another set that assigns 
17:573:44592:21:21:71:498:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:average earnings by gender to parallel the simulations.  Because the interpretation of the 
17:574:44683:21:20:71:542:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:occupation and self-employment variables is ambiguous – it is unclear whether they reflect threat 
17:575:44781:20:21:71:524:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:points or individual characteristics – we use similar estimates in which a simple work dummy 
17:576:44874:21:21:71:467:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:substitutes for occupation and self-employment (as in column (2) of Table 3-C).23 
17:577:44955:21:21:107:495:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:For example, if we switch average current earnings of men and women, then the 
17:578:45033:21:20:71:518:122:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:predicted percentage of husbands having the final say falls from 31.0 to 28.2%, according to 
17:579:45126:20:8:71:218:102:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
17:580:45174:8:16:71:532:94:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:23  In Table 5 we use the estimated coefficients rather than the estimated “true effects”  to give a complete sense of 
17:581:45293:16:11:71:525:78:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:the data that does not rely on our identification assumption.  If we used the estimated true effects, the predictions 
17:582:45411:11:0:71:467:67:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:would lie approximately in the middle of those based on the husbands’ and on the wives’ answers. 
18:583:45510:0:21:71:538:716:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:husbands’ reports, and from 32.3 to 26.6%, according to wives’ reports.24  If we do the same but 
18:584:45607:21:21:71:536:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:switch average past earnings, then the declines are double in magnitude – from 31.5% to 19.7%, 
18:585:45702:21:20:71:534:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:according to wives’ reports.  If we compare all husbands and no wives working to all wives and 
18:586:45797:20:21:71:536:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:no husbands working (with the working spouse earning the conditional average by gender), then 
18:587:45891:21:21:71:518:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the percentage of husbands having the final say, as reported by wives, swings from 37.5% to 
18:588:45983:21:20:71:480:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:27.3%, and the percentage of wives having the final say rises from 11.5% to 18.0%.  
18:589:46067:20:21:107:516:592:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Overall, we characterize these effects as moderate.  They show a clear, but not large, 
18:590:46154:21:21:71:519:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effect of earnings on bargaining power that should be kept in mind when considering tests of 
18:591:46247:21:20:71:535:550:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:income pooling that are common in the literature.  Moreover, further research may shed light on 
18:592:46343:20:21:71:499:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the extent to which bargaining in the HRS cohort may differ from later cohorts that have 
18:593:46432:21:21:71:523:509:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:experienced major changes in divorce rates, fertility, women’s labor supply and earnings, etc. 
18:594:46527:21:14:71:74:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: 
18:595:46527:14:20:71:283:474:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:C.  The impact of other control variables 
18:596:46569:20:21:107:489:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We included a large set of variables reflecting ethnic and cultural background.  
18:597:46650:21:21:71:535:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Coefficient estimates appear in Table 3-A, and the decomposition into true effects and reporting 
18:598:46747:21:20:71:520:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bias appear in Table 4.  Some of these have significant effects on bargaining power, which is 
18:599:46841:20:21:71:523:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interesting for three reasons.  First, these background factors may be correlated with the labor 
18:600:46938:21:21:71:531:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:supply of each spouse.  Second, cultural factors may affect threat points.  For example, cultural 
18:601:47036:21:21:71:532:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:norms may influence the willingness of a spouse to consider divorce by reducing utility outside 
18:602:47132:21:20:71:512:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of marriage.  Alternatively, they may reflect the degree to which the community favors one 
18:603:47223:20:21:71:527:309:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spouse over the other in the event of conflict.  Third, some of the background variables lead to 
18:604:47320:21:21:71:491:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:considerable disagreement between the spouses’ reports about decision-making power. 
18:605:47404:21:20:107:523:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Race, national origin, and ethnicity have some significant effects on reported decision-
18:606:47492:20:21:71:519:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:making power in Table 3-A in roughly descending order in terms of magnitude, although the 
18:607:47582:21:21:71:525:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:significance of the true effects is reduced in Table 4.  If both spouses are black, it has little net 
18:608:47684:21:20:71:537:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effect on the husband’s report of decision-making power, while reducing the wife’s report of the 
18:609:47781:20:21:71:492:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:husband’s power.  Similar results, though somewhat smaller are found for foreign born 
18:610:47867:21:21:71:122:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:couples.25 
18:611:47877:21:21:107:533:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Religion also has strong effects on reported decision-making power, and with much less 
18:612:47964:21:20:71:515:122:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:disagreement.  In Protestant and especially fundamentalist or evangelical Protestant couples 
18:613:48057:20:8:71:218:102:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
18:614:48105:8:11:71:503:94:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:24  Average earnings of husbands and wives in our sample are $38,348 and $11,897, including nonworkers. 
18:615:48209:11:16:71:539:83:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:25  As these variables generate considerable disagreement, we find substantial increases in their coefficient estimates 
18:616:48329:16:0:71:309:67:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:if we limit the sample only to couples whose reports agree. 
19:617:48391:0:21:71:540:716:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:husbands have significantly more decision-making power.  In Catholic and non-religious couples 
19:618:48486:21:21:71:517:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the effects are the reverse, though smaller, while couples reporting different religions have a 
19:619:48582:21:20:71:530:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:significant disagreement.26  Moreover, regular church attendance by either spouse significantly 
19:620:48678:20:21:71:272:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:raises husbands’ decision-making power. 
19:621:48718:21:21:107:540:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:It is interesting to find that having kids, especially if they are under the age of 18, reduces 
19:622:48814:21:20:71:514:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a husband’s reported bargaining power considerably.27  While it has much less influence on 
19:623:48905:20:21:71:519:592:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wives’ reports in the main specification, both effects are greater in specification 3-B (2) with 
19:624:49002:21:21:71:541:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:average past, rather than current, earnings.  The true effect of having children under the age of 18 
19:625:49103:21:20:71:494:550:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in this specification is negative and statistically significant at the 90% confidence level. 
19:626:49196:20:21:107:522:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In addition, increased age of both spouses (or else cohort effects) reduces a husband’s 
19:627:49284:21:21:71:532:509:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reported bargaining power a little.  Lastly, we find little effect of controls for information about 
19:628:49385:21:21:71:539:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:individuals’ time horizon and risk preferences, which we include because they shape some of the 
19:629:49481:21:20:71:302:467:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:household decisions which we investigate later. 
19:630:49529:20:14:71:74:447:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: 
19:631:49529:14:21:71:380:433:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:VI.  WHAT DOES BARGAINING POWER INFLUENCE? 
19:632:49572:21:20:107:498:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In this section, we demonstrate that decision-making power influences important 
19:633:49652:20:21:71:533:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:household decisions.  As examples, we focus on two financial outcomes that are well-measured 
19:634:49745:21:21:71:517:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the HRS:  total wealth accumulation and stock market investment.  Both sets of estimated 
19:635:49837:21:21:71:473:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effects are important in magnitude, though somewhat sensitive to the specification. 
19:636:49921:21:20:107:534:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our findings about wealth accumulation diverge in an interesting way from standard life 
19:637:50009:20:21:71:541:309:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cycle predictions:  household assets rise with the husband’s age when husbands are in charge and 
19:638:50106:21:21:71:536:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with the wife’s age when wives are in charge.  Thus, it appears that the spouse with the final say 
19:639:50205:21:20:71:529:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:may be making decisions based primarily on their own life-cycle prospects.  We show that this 
19:640:50299:20:21:71:525:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:difference is only partly explained by our other main result:  when husbands are in charge, the 
19:641:50395:21:21:71:536:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:household take on more risk by investing more of the household portfolio in equities.  While we 
19:642:50491:21:20:71:537:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:do not elaborate on underlying life cycle models that may be associated with these patterns, they 
19:643:50589:20:21:71:304:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:suggest important directions for future research. 
19:644:50639:21:14:71:74:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: 
19:645:50639:14:25:71:74:150:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: 
19:646:50639:25:8:71:218:125:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
19:647:50687:8:11:71:539:117:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:26  We define religious differences based on these broad categories, which are aggregated over many denominations. 
19:648:50802:11:16:71:493:106:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:27  In theory, kids might shift bargaining power in either direction (increasing the wife’s power if she has 
19:649:50911:16:12:71:526:90:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:disproportionate influence over kids’ emotional well-being or increasing the husband’s if he has disproportionate 
19:650:51025:12:11:71:536:78:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:influence over their material well-being).  We cannot explain why perceptions about the impact of kids might differ 
19:651:51141:11:0:71:134:67:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:across spouses. 
20:652:51159:0:21:71:199:716:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:A.  Estimation approach 
20:653:51183:21:21:107:514:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We use three methods to estimate the impact of bargaining power.  We maintain the 
20:654:51265:21:20:71:514:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assumption throughout that total earnings in the household may be related to these financial 
20:655:51358:20:21:71:497:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:outcomes, but the split between spouses’ earnings is not, except through its influence on 
20:656:51448:21:21:71:542:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bargaining power.28  As we noted earlier, this is necessary in the structural models because we do 
20:657:51547:21:20:71:520:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not observe continuously measured bargaining power but instead use variables that influence 
20:658:51639:20:21:71:534:592:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bargaining power to, in effect, impute a continuous measure.29  Besides that, we include all non-
20:659:51736:21:21:71:535:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:income related control variables used earlier to explain decision-making power, and we add self-
20:660:51832:21:20:71:518:550:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reported information on each spouse’s life expectancy, which influences their time horizons. 
20:661:51925:20:22:107:530:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The first two methods that we use yield structural estimates of equation (6), relating the 
20:662:52016:22:21:71:508:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:impact of decision-making power g  to an outcome z.  We will highlight the more efficient 
20:663:52106:21:21:71:527:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:approach, described in the Appendix and based on Amemiya (1979), which uses reduced form 
20:664:52195:21:21:71:521:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and first-stage estimates to obtain the structural parameters of the second stage.  We compare 
20:665:52290:21:23:71:540:445:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that to a standard two-stage approach that substitutes into (6) an estimate of gˆ obtained from our 
20:666:52390:23:21:71:506:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:earlier specifications.  Here, we can control for the log rather than level of total household 
20:667:52485:21:20:71:530:401:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:earnings, but the estimates are less efficient and have incorrect standard errors.  Controlling for 
20:668:52585:20:21:71:509:381:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the log of income is preferred on a priori grounds (especially when utility is CRRA) and is 
20:669:52677:21:21:71:527:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:typical in regressions involving financial behavior.  Typically, the estimated effect of decision-
20:670:52775:21:20:71:541:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:making power loses some explanatory power under the efficient estimation approach but remains 
20:671:52869:20:21:71:185:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:statistically significant. 
20:672:52896:21:21:107:530:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:With either structural method, the results are somewhat sensitive to the choice of which 
20:673:52985:21:20:71:524:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:first-stage estimates to use.  We try the specifications with current earnings (from Table 3-A), 
20:674:53082:20:21:71:527:257:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:average past earnings (Table 3-B 2, for a smaller sample), and the ratio of earnings (Table 3-C 
20:675:53178:21:21:71:507:236:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:5).  When we use the last specification, we can control for the log rather than level of total 
20:676:53273:21:33:71:544:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:household earnings in the first estimation approach for reasons that are detailed in the Appendix.   
20:677:53374:33:7:71:218:182:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
20:678:53422:7:16:71:519:175:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:28  While earnings and other work-related variables may be endogenous, they are typically included in financial 
20:679:53534:16:12:71:540:159:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:regressions and play a major role in explaining the observed variation (Miniaci and Weber 2002).  One motivation is 
20:680:53650:12:11:71:537:147:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:that, while wealth and portfolio allocations vary substantially by income, they also vary substantially within income 
20:681:53768:11:12:71:541:136:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:groups, and it is this variation that the other control variables seek to explain.  This approach also addresses concerns 
20:682:53890:12:11:71:538:124:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:that omitting earnings might bias the estimated effect of predicted bargaining power.  In any case, excluding income 
20:683:54007:11:7:71:463:113:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:and work-related variables typically has little impact on the estimated effect of bargaining power. 
20:684:54107:7:16:71:535:106:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:29  We were interested in analyzing life insurance holdings as well because of the potential link between bargaining 
20:685:54224:16:12:71:534:90:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:power during marriage and the poverty of widows, but the exclusion restriction was unreasonable in that case since 
20:686:54339:12:11:71:537:78:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:the decision to insure a spouse’s life should depend directly on that spouse’s earnings.  Another difficulty is that the 
20:687:54460:11:0:71:415:67:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:HRS does not report whose life is insured, but rather which spouse owns the policies. 
21:688:54548:0:21:107:541:716:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Lastly, we find similar effects of decision-making power in our third approach, which is a 
21:689:54639:21:21:71:516:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:non-structural alternative to (6) that controls for the discrete answers about decision-making 
21:690:54734:21:20:71:509:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:power.  This approach does not rely on the functional form represented by (1)-(2b) that we 
21:691:54825:20:21:71:537:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assumed in the first stage, but it revives the original difficulty of extracting information from the 
21:692:54927:21:21:71:541:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:discrete and sometimes conflicting answers of spouses.  On the other hand, it allows us to control 
21:693:55026:21:20:71:498:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for the log rather than level of household earnings and even to include spouses’ earnings 
21:694:55116:20:21:71:351:592:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:separately, which has little effect on the estimated results. 
21:695:55178:21:14:71:80:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:   
21:696:55181:14:21:71:172:557:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:B:B.  Wealth and age 
21:697:55199:21:20:107:505:536:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:A:Background.  As long as households expect to retire at some point, then life cycle 
21:698:55282:20:21:71:528:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:models predict that wealth will rise with age until retirement.  Moreover, households appear to 
21:699:55378:21:21:71:512:495:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:do most of their life cycle saving in their 40s and 50s (Gourinchas and Parker 2002), which 
21:700:55470:21:20:71:522:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:coincides well with the HRS.  However, bargaining within the household may be particularly 
21:701:55561:20:21:71:526:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:salient here since husbands, with shorter lifespans and younger wives on average, should have 
21:702:55655:21:21:71:518:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shorter time horizons than their wives (Browning 2000).  Wives should prefer to accumulate 
21:703:55746:21:20:71:533:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more life cycle saving than husbands, yet widows have higher poverty rates than the population 
21:704:55841:20:21:71:114:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:average. 
21:705:55850:21:21:107:540:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our results about the role of bargaining power can help resolve this puzzle.  We find that, 
21:706:55942:21:21:71:526:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:when men are in charge, households with older husbands have significantly higher wealth and 
21:707:56034:21:20:71:534:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:households with older wives have significantly lower wealth; and when wives are in charge, the 
21:708:56129:20:21:71:539:309:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:results are reversed.  Thus, it appears that the spouse with the final say makes decisions based on 
21:709:56229:21:21:71:219:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their own life-cycle prospects. 
21:710:56261:21:20:107:541:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We regressed log household wealth on decision-making power and interacted it with each 
21:711:56348:20:21:71:507:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spouse’s age, and also included total household earnings, other controls used in our earlier 
21:712:56441:21:21:71:508:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:regressions, and the subjective life expectancy of each spouse.  We show a small subset of 
21:713:56532:21:20:71:521:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:coefficient estimates in Table 6, the key ones being the interaction of decision-making power 
21:714:56626:20:21:71:539:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with each spouse’s age.  The top panel shows the efficient estimation approach, the middle panel 
21:715:56723:21:21:71:537:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shows the standard two-stage approach, and the bottom panel shows the non-structural approach 
21:716:56817:21:21:71:309:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with the raw answers on decision-making power. 
21:717:56864:21:20:107:534:122:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:It is worth noting at the outset that the coefficients estimated for the main age effects are 
21:718:56958:20:0:71:502:102:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quite similar in size to those estimated for the decision-making/age interactions.  The age 
22:719:57052:0:21:71:531:716:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:coefficients generally range between 0.02 and 0.04, indicating an annual percentage increase in 
22:720:57148:21:21:71:249:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wealth of 2-4% as each spouse ages. 
22:721:57184:21:20:107:533:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The additional impact on wealth of the decision-making/age interactions depends on the 
22:722:57271:20:22:71:513:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:magnitude of the decision-making power variable.  For this purpose, consider the estimated 
22:723:57362:22:25:71:530:632:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:threshold values0mˆ and 1mˆ reported in Table 3-A.  They indicate the values at which the latent 
22:724:57459:25:21:71:541:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:continuous variable g is predicted to shift, first, from the wife having the final say to power being 
22:725:57561:21:21:71:541:586:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:about equal and, next, from being about equal to the husband having the final say.  The estimated 
22:726:57659:21:20:71:499:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:difference between these values – typically about 1.7 – crosses the full range over which 
22:727:57749:20:21:71:515:545:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decision-making power is “about equal”, and we will use that to gauge the magnitude of the 
22:728:57840:21:21:71:238:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effects in which we are interested. 
22:729:57876:21:21:107:531:503:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:A:Two-stage estimation.  As a baseline, the middle panel of Table 6 reports the two-stage 
22:730:57964:21:20:71:540:482:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimates from each of three different first-stage specifications, with incorrect standard errors but 
22:731:58066:20:21:71:514:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with the log rather than level of household earnings as a covariate.  The estimated effects of 
22:732:58161:21:21:71:541:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decision-making power when it is interacted with each spouse’s age is stable across the three sets 
22:733:58260:21:20:71:505:420:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of results, taking values around 0.045 for the husband’s age and -0.040 for the wife’s age. 
22:734:58352:20:21:107:540:400:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:A:Efficient estimation.  When we use the efficient estimation approach in the top panel, the 
22:735:58443:21:21:71:539:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bargaining power-age interaction effects are smaller.  We will focus on the specification with the 
22:736:58542:21:20:71:534:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:first-stage estimates that use the ratio of earnings, which worked well in Table 3-C 5 and allows 
22:737:58640:20:21:71:524:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:us to control for the log of earnings; and we focus on the log of average past earnings, since it 
22:738:58738:21:21:71:541:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:explains more of the variation in wealth than do current earnings.  The resulting pair of estimated 
22:739:58838:21:20:71:533:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:coefficients on the bargaining power-age interaction lies in the middle of the range in this set of 
22:740:58938:20:21:71:537:276:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:results, at 0.0253 for the husbands’ age and -0.0319 for the wife’s age.  The first coefficient falls 
22:741:59040:21:21:71:476:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:just short of 90% significance and the second coefficient exceeds 95% significance. 
22:742:59124:21:21:107:541:234:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Now, we will consider the implications of these estimates.  Recall that if decision-making 
22:743:59215:21:21:71:524:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:power shifts from the threshold of the wife to the husband having the final say, then the latent 
22:744:59312:21:21:71:540:192:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:continuous variable g changes by about 1.7.  If such a shift occurs, then household wealth will be 
22:745:59411:21:21:71:540:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:4.20% higher (the estimated coefficient 0.0253 times the estimated difference in threshold values 
22:746:59509:21:21:71:537:150:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1.6593) than it would have been otherwise for each year that the husband is older.  Additionally, 
22:747:59607:21:20:71:500:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with such a shift in decision-making power towards the husband, wealth is 5.29% lower  
22:748:59694:20:21:71:498:109:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(-0.0319*1.6593) for each year that the wife is older.  If the reverse takes place, with the 
22:749:59787:21:0:71:524:88:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:household shifting from the threshold of the husband to the wife having the final say, then the 
23:750:59885:0:21:71:539:716:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effects are reversed:  wealth is 5.29% higher for each year that the wife is older and 4.20% lower 
23:751:59984:21:21:71:260:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for each year that the husband is older. 
23:752:60025:21:20:107:535:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To understand the nature of this cross-sectional comparative static, consider a household 
23:753:60115:20:21:71:529:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in which decision-making power is split equally (taking a value of zero).  Wealth will be about 
23:754:60211:21:21:71:541:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the same whether the husband is 65 and the wife is 55, or the ages are reversed and the wife is 65 
23:755:60310:21:20:71:529:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the husband is 55.  That does not hold when decision-making power is unequal.  When the 
23:756:60402:20:21:71:522:592:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:husband just barely has the final say, then the first household (husband 65, wife 55) will have 
23:757:60498:21:21:71:529:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:accumulated 50.8% more wealth (1.042010-1) than it would have if the wife just barely had the 
23:758:60592:21:20:71:534:550:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:final say.  Moreover, the second household (wife 65, husband 55) will have accumulated 67.5% 
23:759:60685:20:21:71:351:530:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:B:less wealth (1.052910-1) than if the wife had the final say. 
23:760:60746:21:21:107:539:509:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:A:Non-structural estimation.  Table 6 also shows alternative estimates that include the raw 
23:761:60836:21:21:71:508:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:responses about decision-making power as dummy variables.  The age-related patterns are 
23:762:60924:21:20:71:535:467:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:similar, while highlighting the difficulties in interpretation of moving away from the framework 
23:763:61021:20:21:71:179:447:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:laid out in Section III. 
23:764:61046:21:21:107:536:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:When husbands report that they have the final say, household wealth is 4.07% higher for 
23:765:61134:21:20:71:495:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:each year that the husband is older and 3.00% lower for each year that the wife is older, 
23:766:61224:20:21:71:528:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:compared to when husbands report that wives have the final say.  These results are statistically 
23:767:61321:21:21:71:533:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:significant.  When husbands report “about equal”, the results are significantly smaller, at 3.18% 
23:768:61419:21:20:71:530:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:higher and 1.39% lower, respectively, and the first result is statistically significant.  The values 
23:769:61520:20:21:71:522:323:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are similar when we use wives’ instead of husbands’ reports.  Lastly, in estimates that are not 
23:770:61616:21:21:71:492:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shown, we do not reject equality of the coefficients on each spouse’s earnings included 
23:771:61704:21:21:71:362:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:separately, and doing so has little effect on the other results. 
23:772:61769:21:13:71:74:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B: 
23:773:61769:13:21:71:298:247:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:B:C.  The riskiness of the household portfolio. 
23:774:61815:21:21:71:509:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:  Background.  Men in the HRS report somewhat greater risk tolerance than women 
23:775:61895:21:20:71:541:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(Barsky et al 1997).  Moreover, other research suggests that men are willing to take on more risk, 
23:776:61994:20:21:71:532:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with single men investing a greater share of their wealth in the stock market than single women 
23:777:62090:21:21:71:510:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(Jianakoplos and Bernasek 1996), men purchasing auto insurance policies that provide less 
23:778:62180:21:21:71:541:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:coverage (Cohen and Einav 2004) and men even taking more risks in mundane choices involving 
23:779:62272:21:20:71:346:122:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:seat belt use and preventative dental care (Hersch 1996). 
23:780:62330:20:21:107:530:102:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Results in Table 7 reveal the impact of these apparent differences in risk preferences on 
23:781:62420:21:0:71:535:81:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:some important household decisions.  We find that, as husbands’ power rises, households invest 
24:782:62517:0:21:71:499:716:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more in the stock market, and this effect is significant in many of the specifications.  We 
24:783:62609:21:21:71:516:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimated probits on whether households invest in the stock market at all (which 32% in our 
24:784:62701:21:20:71:537:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sample do) and tobits on the share of financial assets invested in the stock market (which is 17% 
24:785:62799:20:21:71:512:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on average).30  As in the previous section, we controlled for total household earnings, other 
24:786:62893:21:21:71:505:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:controls used in our earlier regressions, and subjective life expectancy.  The coefficient of 
24:787:62987:21:20:71:431:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interest is the one on the decision-making power and “final say” variables. 
24:788:63063:20:21:107:537:592:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:A:Two-stage estimation.  As a baseline, the middle panel of Table 7 reports estimates from 
24:789:63152:21:21:71:505:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the two-stage approach with incorrect standard errors, but with the log rather than level of 
24:790:63245:21:20:71:539:550:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:household earnings as a control.  When we use the current earnings specification from 3-A in the 
24:791:63342:20:21:71:515:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:first stage, the marginal effect of the husband’s predicted bargaining power on stock market 
24:792:63435:21:21:71:502:509:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:participation in the probit is 0.1811, and the effect on the desired share of financial assets 
24:793:63530:21:21:71:525:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:invested in the stock market in the tobit is 0.2755.  The estimated effects are reduced by about 
24:794:63627:21:20:71:529:467:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:one-third when we use the average past earnings specification from 3-B 2 in the first-stage and 
24:795:63723:20:21:71:540:447:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increased by about one-third when we use the ratio of earnings specification from 3-C 5, whether 
24:796:63820:21:21:71:352:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:controlling for the log of current or average past earnings. 
24:797:63881:21:20:107:540:405:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:A:Efficient estimation.  When we use the efficient estimation approach in the top panel, the 
24:798:63972:20:21:71:522:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimated effect is smaller for the specifications that control for current earnings (3-A and the 
24:799:64070:21:21:71:514:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:first 3-C 5 result) and considerably larger for the specifications that control for average past 
24:800:64167:21:20:71:539:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:earnings (3-B 2 and the second 3-C 5 result).  Since it is preferable, once again, to control for the 
24:801:64269:20:21:71:536:323:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:log of average past earnings, we will focus on the last specification – though it should be kept in 
24:802:64369:21:21:71:382:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mind that the resulting estimates lie at the high end of the range. 
24:803:64437:21:21:107:538:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the preferred specification, the estimated marginal effect of a small change in decision-
24:804:64529:21:20:71:535:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:making power is 0.4262 for the probit, and the estimated coefficient is 0.6874 for the tobit, both 
24:805:64628:20:21:71:535:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of which are highly significant.  If decision-making power in a household shifts, as before, from 
24:806:64726:21:21:71:503:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the threshold of the wife having the final say to the husband having the final say, then the 
24:807:64819:21:20:71:500:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:probability that the household invests in the stock market rises by a very substantial 50.9 
24:808:64911:20:21:71:503:178:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percentage points.  The same shift in decision-making power raises the predicted share of 
24:809:65001:21:7:71:218:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
24:810:65049:7:16:71:536:150:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:30  A caveat is that the HRS does not report the investment allocation of Individual Retirement Accounts or of those 
24:811:65166:16:12:71:529:134:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:defined contribution pensions (including 401(k) plans) that do not offer an investment choice.  45% of our sample 
24:812:65280:12:12:71:531:122:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:have IRAs, which we omit entirely from the analysis.  35% have defined contribution pensions, 60% of which can 
24:813:65391:12:11:71:539:110:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:be identified as offering investment choices; for the latter, the HRS reports whether the account was invested mostly 
24:814:65509:11:11:71:539:99:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:in stocks, mostly in bonds, or “split”.  This information is vague, though, and we chose to focus entirely on financial 
24:815:65629:11:0:71:529:88:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:wealth and did not consider any form pension wealth.  These omissions may lead us to underestimate the effect of 
25:816:65744:0:21:71:541:716:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:financial assets invested in the stock market by 26.0 percentage points.31  By way of comparison, 
25:817:65842:21:21:71:521:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the estimates for the same first-stage specification but controlling for log current earnings are 
25:818:65940:21:20:71:531:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:considerably smaller, at 0.2002 for the probit (statistically significant at a little more than 90%) 
25:819:66041:20:21:71:537:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and 0.3182 for the tobit (statistically significant at a little less than 90%).  These estimates imply 
25:820:66144:21:21:71:533:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:predicted increases of 29.3 and 13.7 percentage points if decision-making power shifts from the 
25:821:66240:21:20:71:171:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wife to the husband. 
25:822:66261:20:21:107:537:592:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:A:Non-structural estimation.  In the final panel of Table 6, the results are similar when the 
25:823:66353:21:21:71:533:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:raw answers are included as dummy variables.  If the husband reports having the final say, then 
25:824:66449:21:20:71:523:550:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the household is 5.1% more likely to invest in the stock market relative to the wife having the 
25:825:66545:20:21:71:502:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:final say and a little greater than that relative to “about equal”.  The effects are somewhat 
25:826:66639:21:21:71:520:509:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reduced and not statistically significant based on the wife’s reports.  As we noted earlier, this 
25:827:66737:21:21:71:532:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:specification raises difficulties in reconciling the discrete and sometimes conflicting answers of 
25:828:66836:21:20:71:139:467:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:both spouses. 
25:829:66850:20:21:107:512:447:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Lastly, we find some suggestive evidence that other preferences of the individual in 
25:830:66935:21:21:71:518:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:charge matter more as well.  In results that are not shown, when husbands have the final say, 
25:831:67029:21:20:71:517:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:then  the household invests more in the stock market if the husband is less risk averse, while 
25:832:67124:20:21:71:490:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wives’ risk aversion has no affect.  When wives are in charge, wives’ risk aversion has 
25:833:67212:21:21:71:537:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:substantial effects, though they are not statistically significant.  We find similar patterns for time 
25:834:67315:21:20:71:128:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:preference. 
25:835:67327:20:21:107:530:323:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:A:Summary.  Taking our two major sets of results together, we note that the difference in 
25:836:67415:21:21:71:516:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:portfolio allocations can explain part but not all of the age-related results.  In the benchmark 
25:837:67512:21:21:71:541:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:calculation discussed above, a shift from the threshold of the wife to the husband having the final 
25:838:67612:21:20:71:508:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:say would raise the predicted share of financial assets invested in the stock market by 26.0 
25:839:67705:20:21:71:529:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percentage points.  According to some simple calculations, this could raise wealth at age 65 by 
25:840:67801:21:32:71:518:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:36.1%.32  Since our earlier benchmark suggested that the same household would accumulate 
25:841:67890:32:12:71:542:187:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:                                                                                                                                                             
25:842:68046:12:12:71:538:175:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:bargaining power.  For people in our sample whose pensions offer an investment choice, men are significantly more 
25:843:68160:12:12:71:308:163:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:likely than women to invest theirs “mostly or all” in stock. 
25:844:68221:12:7:71:269:151:6:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f6:C:31  For the probit, we calculated this as )ˆXˆˆ()ˆXˆˆ(dmgFdmgF+-+
25:845:68286:7:15:331:539:144:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:01, where notation is based on equations (6) 
25:846:68331:15:16:71:542:129:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:and (10) and jm refers to the jth threshold in the first-stage ordered probit.  For the tobit, we calculated the change in

25:848:68551:7:16:71:516:106:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:32  In these calculations, we assume that bonds and stocks earn real returns of 2.25% and 7.10%, the respective 
25:849:68663:16:12:71:519:90:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:averages for the period 1926-2004.  We further assume that people have the lifetime age-earnings profile of the 
25:850:68775:12:11:71:525:78:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:median HRS individual, excluding those with non-zero earnings; that they save a constant fraction of their salary 
25:851:68889:11:0:71:460:67:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:each year from age 22 until they retire at age 65; and that they rebalance their portfolio annually.

26:854:69183:21:20:71:359:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:choices explains only a fraction of the difference in wealth.

26:857:69262:21:20:107:541:619:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our analysis takes advantage of unique data on the distribution of decision-making power 
26:858:69351:20:21:71:524:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:between spouses.  We interpret this question as revealing whose preferences are reflected to a 
26:859:69446:21:21:71:540:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:greater degree in household decisions. We find that decision-making power depends on plausible 
26:860:69541:21:21:71:533:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variables like earnings and also influences some important household outcomes.  Moreover, the 
26:861:69635:21:20:71:343:536:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:second set of results is much stronger than the first set.   
26:862:69696:20:21:107:540:516:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In terms of outcomes of bargaining, we find that, household wealth is significantly higher 
26:863:69787:21:21:71:528:495:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the older is the husband but not the wife when husbands have the final say, and the older is the 
26:864:69884:21:20:71:520:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wife but not the husband when wives have the final say – an intriguing twist on the life cycle 
26:865:69979:20:21:71:530:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model.  We find further that, when husbands have the final say, households invest significantly 
26:866:70075:21:21:71:531:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more in the stock market, though the difference in portfolio allocations can explain only part of 
26:867:70173:21:20:71:531:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the age-related results.  Being able to investigate outcomes that are both novel in the household 
26:868:70271:20:21:71:431:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bargaining literature and important is a major contribution of our research. 
26:869:70348:21:21:107:538:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:From a policy perspective, the results suggest that household bargaining can help explain 
26:870:70438:21:21:71:539:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the relatively high rate of poverty among widows.  These concerns provide support for proposals 
26:871:70534:21:20:71:534:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to increase Social Security survivor benefits, especially in case of Social Security privatization.  
26:872:70635:20:21:71:519:309:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:A shift away from the current annuitized Social Security benefit towards a lump-sum private 
26:873:70727:21:21:71:522:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:account would increase the risk of impoverishment among older widows who were in a weak 
26:874:70815:21:20:71:521:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bargaining position while married.  Likewise, the major shift over the last twenty years in the 
26:875:70911:20:21:71:521:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:structure of employer-provided pensions from annuitized defined benefits towards lump-sum 
26:876:71001:21:21:71:423:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:defined contribution accounts may undermine the well-being of widows. 
26:877:71071:21:20:107:536:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In terms of determinants of bargaining power, our major result in this paper is somewhat 
26:878:71160:20:21:71:508:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:negative, since we remain unable to explain a great deal about the observed distribution of 
26:879:71252:21:21:71:540:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bargaining power.  Labor market earnings have significant but moderate effects in our estimation 
26:880:71349:21:21:71:542:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:results for this older sample – switching average lifetime earnings of husbands and wives reduces 
26:881:71447:21:20:71:514:122:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the predicted percentage of men reported to have the final say by their wives from 31.5% to 
26:882:71539:20:0:71:539:102:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:19.7%.  These results are noteworthy because the HRS affords much more detail about the entire 
27:883:71636:0:21:71:536:716:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:path of earnings than data used in previous “income pooling” tests, yet earnings appear to play a 
27:884:71734:21:21:71:269:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:limited role in determining threat points. 
27:885:71777:21:20:107:512:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Thus, future research may focus greater attention on other factors influencing threat 
27:886:71863:20:21:71:534:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:points, perhaps including the role of marriage markets since remarriage has become common as 
27:887:71956:21:21:71:527:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:divorce rates have risen over time.  In addition, it should be possible to extend this research by

27:896:72261:14:14:71:515:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We now describe the method that we use to estimate the parameters in (6) when we observe

27:898:72448:13:14:71:535:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on Amemiya (1979) and was elaborated by Maddala (1983, Section 8.9).  Although focusing on 
27:899:72539:14:14:71:501:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the simultaneous tobit model, Amemiya (p.175) noted that, “The principles on which our 
27:900:72626:14:14:71:500:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimators are based can be applied in general whenever structural parameters need to be

29:969:75960:0:14:71:493:716:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:To sum up, we use the methods that we outlined earlier in the Appendix to estimate the 
29:970:76047:14:15:71:528:702:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parameters reported in Table 7, with (A.1b) taking the form of a probit or tobit.  We estimate a 
29:971:76144:15:13:71:538:687:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:yet more generalized version of (A.1b¢) for Table 6, adding additional terms that interact y* with 
29:972:76243:13:15:71:508:674:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:elements of X – specifically, the husband’s age and wife’s age.  As a consequence of these 
29:973:76334:15:17:71:524:659:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interactions, (A.2¢) involves terms that interact age with the error term e, so we use the Huber-
29:974:76431:17:17:71:328:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:White method to estimate the covariance matrix eˆW.

29:977:76580:14:13:71:532:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(A.1a).  When we use specifications that include each spouse’s current or average past earnings 
29:978:76676:13:14:71:512:584:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the first stage, then we include the sum of earnings in the second stage.  While we would 
29:979:76769:14:14:71:510:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prefer the log of the sum of earnings, including this non-linear transformation of first-stage 
29:980:76864:14:14:71:507:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:covariates is not possible using the method we have outlined above.  As an alternative, we 
29:981:76955:14:14:71:537:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consider a first-stage specification of (A.1a) with the ratio of spouses’ earnings, and then we can 
29:982:77055:14:13:71:401:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:use the log of the sum of earnings as a covariate in the second stage.
