2:29:1419:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:Nominal wage stickiness is an important component of recent medium-scale structural macroeconomic
2:30:1516:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:models, but to date there has been little microeconomic evidence supporting the assumption of sluggish
2:31:1618:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:nominal wage adjustment. We present evidence on the frequency of nominal wage adjustment using
2:32:1712:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) for the period 1996-1999. The SIPP
2:33:1810:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:provides high-frequency information on wages, employment and demographic characteristics for a
2:34:1904:14:28:72:330:518:12:Times:12:Times:large and representative sample of the US population.
2:35:1957:28:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:The main results of the analysis are as follows. 1) After correcting for measurement error, wages appear
2:36:2061:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:to be very sticky. In the average quarter, the probability that an individual will experience a nominal
2:37:2164:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:wage change is between 5 and 18 percent, depending on the samples and assumptions used. 2) The
2:38:2258:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:frequency of wage adjustment does not display significant seasonal patterns. 3) There is little heterogeneity
2:39:2367:14:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:in the frequency of wage adjustment across industries and occupations. 4) The hazard of a nominal
2:40:2464:14:14:72:540:420:12:Times:12:Times:wage change first increases and then decreases, with a peak at 12 months. 5) The probability of a wage
2:41:2566:14:42:72:540:406:12:Times:12:Times:change is positively correlated with the unemployment rate and with the consumer price inflation rate.

3:61:3042:0:32:72:185:709:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:1  Introduction
3:62:3057:32:20:72:540:677:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:It is difficult to explain the estimated real effects of monetary policy shocks without assuming that
3:63:3158:20:20:72:540:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:some  nominal  variables  adjust  sluggishly.   In  theGeneral  Theory,  Keynes  (1936)  assumed  that
3:64:3260:20:21:72:540:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:nominal wages were rigid,  and thus that expansionary monetary policy would reduce real wages
3:65:3353:21:20:72:540:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and increase employment and output.  Fischer (1977) and Taylor (1980) showed that nominal wage
3:66:3447:20:20:72:540:596:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:contracts would have similar effects even in explicitly dynamic models with rational expectations.
3:67:3545:20:21:72:540:576:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Recent  macro-econometric  models  have  typically  followed  the  important  contribution  of  Erceg,
3:68:3647:21:20:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Henderson and Levin (2000), and assumed that both prices and nominal wages are slow to adjust.
3:69:3741:20:20:88:539:535:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The large number of recent models with such features has inspired researchers to examine micro
3:70:3835:20:20:72:540:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:data on the frequency of price changes for individual products,  with notable papers by Bils and
3:71:3931:20:21:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Klenow (2004) and Nakamura and Steinsson (2008).  However, to date there has been little research
3:72:4028:21:20:72:540:474:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:using micro data to estimate the rigidity of nominal wages — even though Christiano, Eichenbaum
3:73:4123:20:20:72:540:454:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and  Evans  (CEE  2005)  find  that  nominal  wage  rigidity  is  more  important  than  nominal  price
3:74:4226:20:21:72:402:434:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rigidity for explaining the dynamic effects of monetary policy shocks.
3:75:4296:21:20:88:539:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our paper attempts  to address  this  gap in  the  literature.  The  lack of  previous work  on the
3:76:4395:20:20:72:540:393:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:business cycle implications of nominal wage rigidity using micro data may be due in part to a lack
3:77:4493:20:21:72:540:373:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of suitable datasets.  We provide evidence about the frequency of wage adjustment in the United
3:78:4588:21:20:72:540:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:States using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). The SIPP is a
3:79:4679:20:20:72:540:332:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:survey  run  by  the  Bureau  of  Labor  Statistics  (BLS).  It  provides  individual  wage  histories  for  a
3:80:4789:20:21:72:540:312:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:large  and  representative  sample  that  is  followed  for  a  period  of  24  to  48  months.   Importantly,
3:81:4899:21:20:72:540:291:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the individuals are interviewed every four months.  These data allow us to examine wage changes
3:82:4994:20:20:72:540:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:using high-frequency data.  (Most previous work on nominal wage rigidity using U.S. micro data
3:83:5088:20:21:72:540:251:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:has  used  the  PSID,  which  is  an  annual  survey  and  thus  less  useful  for  high-frequency  analysis.
3:84:5197:21:20:72:540:230:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Other well-known sources of micro wage data, the CPS and the Employment Cost Index (ECI), do
3:85:5289:20:20:72:540:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:not provide sufficiently long time-series data on individual wages, and thus cannot be used for our
3:86:5388:20:21:72:540:190:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:purpose.)  We use the longest panel of the SIPP for which complete data are available:  the 1996
3:87:5484:21:20:72:300:169:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:panel (run from March 1996 to February 2000).
3:88:5529:20:20:88:539:149:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In our main results, we focus on the frequency of nominal wage adjustments disregarding em-
3:89:5620:20:21:72:540:129:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ployment history.  This is arguably the concept that is most relevant for macro models with nominal
3:90:5719:21:0:72:539:108:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:wage rigidities, particularly medium-scale DSGE modelsa laCEE (2005).  The reason is that most
4:91:5814:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:business-cycle models with nominal wage rigidity follow Blanchard and Kiyotaki (1987) and assume
4:92:5910:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that all workers are monopolistically competitive suppliers of differentiated labor services.  In this
4:93:6012:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:framework,  the  worker  sets  the  wage,  and  revises  it  occasionally  on  his/her  own  schedule,  thus
4:94:6120:20:21:72:524:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:making the sequence of wages regardless of employment history the relevant series to examine.
4:95:6213:21:20:88:539:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We  use  as  our  baseline  the  results  for  hourly  workers  (or  wage  earners)  who  reported  their
4:96:6318:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:hourly  wages  to  the  SIPP  interviewer.   The  reason  is  that  computing  wages  as  hourly  earnings
4:97:6424:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:increases measurement error.  For the baseline results we chose to focus on the statistic measured
4:98:6522:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with least error, the hourly wage, at the cost of making the sample less representative.  However,
4:99:6620:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we also present results for the sample of salaried workers,  using their monthly earnings as their
4:100:6718:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:“wage”  measure.   By  reporting  the  results  for  both  hourly  workers  and  for  salaried  workers,  we
4:101:6826:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:leave the decision of the “right number” for macroeconomics to individual researchers who may be
4:102:6922:20:20:72:348:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:interested in calibrating their models using our estimates.
4:103:6981:20:21:88:539:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Regardless  of  the  sample  used,  it  is  clear  that  the  data  are  contaminated  with  a  significant
4:104:7088:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:amount of measurement error.  This is a disadvantage of working with data on individual wages,
4:105:7182:20:20:72:539:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:which in U.S. survey data are always self-reported.1We deal with this problem applying to the
4:106:7275:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reported wage and earnings series the correction for measurement error introduced by Gottschalk
4:107:7370:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(2005),  who  built  upon  the  work  of  Bai  and  Perron  (1998  and  2003).   The  application  uses  the
4:108:7478:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:identifying  assumption  that  wages  are  not  adjusted  continuously  but  are  changed  by  a  discrete
4:109:7584:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:amount  when  an  adjustment  takes  place,  which  corresponds  to  our  usual  intuition  about  labor
4:110:7688:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:market institutions.  The implied statistical model says that the true wage (or earnings) is constant
4:111:7789:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for an unspecified period of time  and then changes  discretely at unspecified breakpoints.  Thus,
4:112:7887:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:true wage changes in a noisy series can be estimated as one would estimate structural break dates
4:113:7984:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in a standard time series.  The Bai-Perron-Gottschalk method is to test for a structural break at all
4:114:8085:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:possible dates in a series.  If one can reject the null hypothesis of no break for the most likely break
4:115:8189:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:date, then assume that there is a break at that point in time.  Then examine the remaining sub-
4:116:8284:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:periods for evidence of structural breaks, and continue until one cannot reject the hypothesis of no
4:117:8384:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:break for all remaining dates.  The adjusted series have wage (earnings) changes at all dates where
4:118:8483:20:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we can reject the no-break hypothesis,  and are constant otherwise.  This is a systematic way of
4:119:8579:21:15:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:excluding many instances of transitory wage changes that look very much like measurement error.
4:120:8674:15:15:84:539:124:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:1Surveys in some other countries have access to administrative data from payroll or tax records, which reduces
4:121:8784:15:0:72:201:109:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:measurement error significantly.
5:122:8817:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We present some examples in the paper where we apply this method to SIPP data for individuals
5:123:8910:21:20:72:140:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in our sample.
5:124:8924:20:20:88:539:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We find the following main results.  First, after correcting for measurement error, wages appear
5:125:9020:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to  be  very  sticky.   In  our  baseline  result  with  hourly  workers,  we  find  that  the  probability  of  a
5:126:9134:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:wage change is about 18 percent per quarter, thus implying an expected duration of wage contracts
5:127:9231:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of 5.6 quarters.  For salaried workers, the probability of an earnings change is only 5 percent per
5:128:9330:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:quarter.  By comparison, several key paper estimating DSGE models using macro data estimate this
5:129:9426:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:probability to be about 30 percent per quarter, so we are finding significantly more nominal wage
5:130:9523:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:stickiness than macroeconomists typically assume.  Second, the frequency of wage adjustment does
5:131:9619:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:not display any significant monthly or seasonal pattern.  Third, we find little heterogeneity in the
5:132:9719:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:frequency of wage adjustment across industries.  Wages in manufacturing appear to be more sticky
5:133:9815:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:than  wages  in  services.   Similarly,  we  find  little  heterogeneity  across  occupations,  although  the
5:134:9924:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:frequency of wage adjustment is somewhat larger for service-related occupations.  Fourth, we find
5:135:10021:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that wage changes are significantly right-skewed, in keeping with preceding papers (e.g., Gottschalk,
5:136:10122:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2005) that have found evidence of downward nominal wage rigidity in microdata.  Fifth, the hazard
5:137:10219:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of a nominal wage change first increases and then decreases, with a peak at 12 months.  Thus, at
5:138:10315:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a micro level, the pattern of wage changes appears somewhat more in keeping with the staggered
5:139:10409:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:contracting model of Taylor (1980) than the constant-hazard model of Calvo (1983).  However, our
5:140:10505:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:second result suggests that the timing of wage contracts is uniformly staggered throughout the year,
5:141:10605:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:which is the pattern that gives maximum persistence of nominal wages following a shock.  Sixth,
5:142:10700:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the  probability  of  a  wage  change  is  positively  correlated  with  the  unemployment  rate  and  with
5:143:10807:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the consumer price inflation rate.  Finally, we show that higher wage stickiness makes it easier for
5:144:10907:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:macroeconomic models to match the stylized fact that monetary shocks cause persistent changes
5:145:11000:20:20:72:392:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in real output and small but relatively persistent changes in prices.
5:146:11069:20:21:88:539:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This paper is connected to several strands of the literature.  The first is the literature assessing
5:147:11169:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:wage rigidity using micro data.  Much of this previous literature has concentrated on the different
5:148:11268:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:issue of downward nominal wage rigidity, rather than the frequency of wage adjustmentper se.  For
5:149:11365:20:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:example, Kahn (1997) reports evidence of a substantial downward nominal wage flexibility using
5:150:11459:21:20:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:U.S.  data  from  the  PSID.  Gottschalk  (2005)  analyses  data  from  the  SIPP  and,  after  correcting
5:151:11565:20:0:72:540:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for  measurement  error,  finds  much  greater  downward  wage  rigidity.   Lebow  et  al  (1999)  use  the
6:152:11673:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Employment Cost Index and also find a substantial amount of downward wage rigidity.  Dickens et
6:153:11768:21:20:72:539:688:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:al (2007a) summarize the results coming from the International Wage Flexibility Project (IWFP).2
6:154:11864:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The  IWFP  has  collected  data  on  wages  and  analyzed  wage  dynamics  using  data  from  a  large
6:155:11966:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:number of countries.  The main focus of this project is to perform analysis of wages dynamics that
6:156:12064:21:20:72:539:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are comparable across different countries.3Perhaps unsurprisingly, one of the main findings of the
6:157:12162:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:project is that wage rigidity varies substantially across the different countries studied.  This finding
6:158:12266:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:suggests that one should be careful in extrapolating our results to different countries and perhaps
6:159:12365:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:even to different time periods.  Finally, in a very recent contribution, Heckel at al (2008) analyze
6:160:12465:20:20:72:521:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the frequency of wage adjustment for a large sample of French firms for the period 1998-2005.
6:161:12558:20:21:88:539:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our paper is also related to the macro literature on nominal wage rigidity.  Recent medium-scale
6:162:12654:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:macroeconomic models have used the sticky-wage assumption extensively.  Most of these models,
6:163:12747:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:estimated through Bayesian techniques using aggregate data, suggest that nominal wages are quite
6:164:12843:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sticky.  However, as recently pointed out by Del Negro and Schorfheide (2008), this approach to
6:165:12938:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:estimation  often  delivers  estimates  that  mirror  the  priors.   In  their  conclusions,  Del  Negro  and
6:166:13047:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Schorfheide advocate more empirical analysis of microdata, along the lines of the work by Bils and
6:167:13145:20:21:72:539:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Klenow  (2004)  and  Nakamura  and  Steinsson  (2008)  on  the  frequency  of  price  adjustment.4We
6:168:13245:21:20:71:509:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:view our paper as a first step towards providing similar micro estimates for wage dynamics.
6:169:13336:20:20:88:539:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A prominent strand of the literature on wage and employment dynamics over the business cycle
6:170:13428:20:21:71:539:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:has focused on search and matching models of the labor market.5Our paper is not directly related
6:171:13524:21:20:71:539:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to this line of work.  First, these papers are formulated in purely real terms, so the relevant concept
6:172:13627:20:20:71:539:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is real wage rigidity, rather than the nominal rigidity we examine.  Second, the search and matching
6:173:13727:20:21:71:539:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:framework indicates that the issue that matters for macroeconomic purposes is whether a pre-set
6:174:13822:21:20:71:539:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:wage  paid  to  current  employees  is  also  applied  to  new  hires.6We  estimate  the  wage  stickiness
6:175:13928:20:20:71:539:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that  matters  in  a  monopolistically  competitive  labor  market  setting,  which  is  the  frequency  of
6:176:14035:20:21:71:539:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:wage changes for an individual regardless of employment history.  Haefke et al (2008) and Hall and
6:177:14133:21:16:71:539:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Krueger (2008) examine micro evidence more related to the key predictions of the search literature.

6:179:14303:11:15:84:539:173:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:3The US was included among the countries studied for assessing downward wage rigidity but not among those
6:180:14408:15:11:72:540:158:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:used to analyze wage stickiness.  The reason, again, is that the IWFP data on US wages comes from the PSID which
6:181:14520:11:7:72:179:147:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:provides only annual data.
6:182:14546:7:11:84:508:140:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:4Although they warn that aggregation is a key issue when inferring macro behavior from micro evidence.
6:183:14648:11:11:84:269:129:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:5For example, Shimer (2005) and Hall (2005).

6:185:14724:47:0:303:308:71:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:5
7:186:14725:0:21:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Finally, our results shed some light on a small but interesting literature on the seasonal effects
7:187:14823:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of monetary policy shocks.  Recently, Olivei and Tenreyro (2008) have found that monetary policy
7:188:14919:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:shocks that occur in the first half of the year have larger real effects than those that occur later
7:189:15019:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the year.  They explain this result by positing a model where wage changes are more likely to
7:190:15115:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:occur in the second half of the year.  We find that while the frequency of wage changes is indeed
7:191:15212:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:slightly higher in the second half of the year, the magnitude of the difference is much smaller than
7:192:15312:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:assumed in the calibrated model of Olivei and Tenreyro, suggesting that a different model might
7:193:15407:21:20:72:361:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:be needed to explain their very interesting empirical finding.
7:194:15469:20:20:88:539:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The structure of the paper is as follows. The next section discusses the SIPP sample and the data
7:195:15566:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:definitions that we use.  Section 3 summarizes the methodology we use to correct the wage series for
7:196:15666:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:unobserved measurement error.  Section 4 contains the main results of the analysis obtained using
7:197:15763:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the sample of hourly workers, while section 5 presents the results for salaried workers.  Section 6
7:198:15862:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:explores the implications of the results obtained for the characteristics of a standard macroeconomic
7:199:15963:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:model.   Section  7  contains  the  discussion  of  the  hazard  estimates  and  section  8  concludes,  and
7:200:16071:20:43:72:283:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:suggests some directions for future research.
7:201:16116:43:31:72:131:381:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:2  Data
7:202:16123:31:21:72:539:350:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The data source for this paper is theSurvey of Income and Program Participation(SIPP). The SIPP
7:203:16218:21:20:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:data have been collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) since 1983, with a major revision
7:204:16316:20:20:72:540:309:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in 1996. The SIPP sample is a multi-stage, stratified, representative sample of the US population. A
7:205:16416:20:21:72:540:289:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:large number of individuals are interviewed in order to collect detailed data regarding the source and
7:206:16518:21:20:72:540:268:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:amount of their income, a variety of demographic characteristics, and their eligibility for different
7:207:16619:20:20:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:federal  programs.   Each  individual  is  followed  for  a  period  ranging  from  24  to  48  months,  with
7:208:16728:20:21:72:275:228:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:interviews taking place every four months.
7:209:16770:21:20:88:539:207:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The SIPP has at least two advantages compared to the other two large surveys used for this kind
7:210:16865:20:20:72:540:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of analysis, namely the Outgoing Rotation Group data from linked Current Population Surveys,
7:211:16957:20:21:72:540:167:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.  First, unlike the PSID, the SIPP provides us with high-
7:212:17053:21:20:72:540:146:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:frequency information about wage changes.  The near-quarterly frequency of the SIPP data makes
7:213:17147:20:20:72:540:126:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:it much more relevant for analyzing business cycles.  Second, unlike the ORG, where an individual
7:214:17244:20:0:72:540:106:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is interviewed for four consecutive months,  not interviewed for the next eight months,  and then
8:215:17342:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:interviewed for another four months before being dropped from the sample, the 1996 panel of the
8:216:17437:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:SIPP, which we use, follows each individual for up to 48 months, thus creating the proper panel
8:217:17532:20:20:72:539:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:data essential for our analysis.7Finally, the SIPP reports more reliable information on wages and
8:218:17629:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:hours than the ORG or the PSID. In both these surveys, respondents are asked about their income
8:219:17724:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:only once a year, and must recall the amount and type of their income from various sources over
8:220:17819:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the  preceding  calendar  year  —  a  daunting  prospect  for  most  people.   By  contrast,  in  the  SIPP
8:221:17926:20:21:72:509:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:workers paid by the hour are asked specifically for their hourly wage rate in each interview.
8:222:18019:21:20:88:539:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We focus on the longest panel of this survey for which complete data are available:  the 1996
8:223:18112:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:panel (run from March 1996 to February 2000).  For each person in the panel, we have time series
8:224:18208:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:information about their wage rate (if they get paid by the hour) and monthly earnings as well as
8:225:18304:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:their  industry  and  occupation.   Table  1  reports  basic  descriptive  statistics  for  our  sample.   The
8:226:18414:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1996 Panel follows 39,095 people, 49.4% of whom are women.  We restrict our sample to workers
8:227:18507:20:21:72:502:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:between 15 and 64 years of age.  The average person in our sample is around 38 years old.
8:228:18596:21:20:88:539:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our first step aimed at minimizing measurement error is to focus on the smaller sample of those
8:229:18691:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:people who directly reported their hourly wage to the SIPP interviewer (because they get paid by
8:230:18787:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the hour).  Focusing only on hourly workers, however, has the drawback of reducing the size and
8:231:18882:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:representativeness of the sample for the full population.  Thus, we also report separately the results
8:232:18984:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for salaried workers.  Of course,  the latter do not report their wage rates.  For salaried workers,
8:233:19084:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we use monthly earnings as opposed to hourly earnings.  The reason is that using hourly earnings
8:234:19180:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:would introduce much more noise into the wage history for salaried workers (since the earnings are
8:235:19278:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:divided by the worker’s recollection of hours worked, which is also likely to suffer from measurement
8:236:19379:20:21:72:102:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:error).
8:237:19386:21:20:88:539:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our smaller sample of hourly workers includes 17,148 people.  Table 1 gives basic descriptive
8:238:19479:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:statistics of reported wages and earnings.  The average wage rate in our sample for hourly workers
8:239:19577:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is $10.03 dollars.  There is, however, a lot of heterogeneity.  The 5thpercentile of the distribution of
8:240:19681:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:wages is $5 and the 95this $20.  The average monthly earnings for salaried workers is about $3,000
8:241:19779:20:20:72:490:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:dollars.  The 5thpercentile of the distribution of earnings is $440 and the 95this $6,800.
8:242:19869:20:16:88:539:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Tables 2 and 3 report the breakdowns for industry and occupational category at one digit level.
8:243:19964:16:15:84:539:144:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:7In fact, the CPS is even less suitable than this summary indicates, because the sampling unit is the household
8:244:20075:15:11:72:540:129:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:and not the individual.  An individual leaving the housing unit is not followed; instead, new residents become survey
8:245:20192:11:0:72:110:118:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:members.
9:246:20201:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:As Table 1 shows, Services is the most highly represented industry (33.3% of total hourly workers),
9:247:20300:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:followed by Trade (26%) and Manufacturing (21%).  Agriculture and Mining, on the other hand,
9:248:20392:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:have very few observations.  As for occupational categories, Technical Sales and Support is the most
9:249:20492:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:highly represented in our sample (30%) followed by Machine Operators (24%) and Services (19%).
9:250:20586:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:On the other hand,  Professionals and Managers account for only 13% of the total in the hourly
9:251:20680:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:workers sample, while they represent almost 30% of the entire survey.  Not surprisingly, our smaller
9:252:20780:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sample under-represents occupational categories where workers are less likely to report receiving
9:253:20877:21:43:72:137:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:hourly wages.
9:254:20890:43:31:72:152:523:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:3  Method
9:255:20899:31:21:72:540:492:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A key to our results is trying to limit the impact of measurement error in assessing the frequency
9:256:20997:21:20:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of wage adjustment.  Our first way of achieving this objective is to reduce the sample to the people
9:257:21097:20:20:72:540:451:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:who are hourly workers and reported their base wage rates to the SIPP interviewer.  We prefer to
9:258:21193:20:20:72:540:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:concentrate on the hourly wage, since earnings may vary at the same wage if people change their
9:259:21288:20:21:72:540:411:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:hours worked.  We also believe that people paid by the hour are likely to remember their hourly
9:260:21383:21:20:72:456:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:wage rates, but few people recall their monthly earnings down to the last dollar.
9:261:21464:20:20:88:539:370:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A second step is to apply to the reported data the procedure introduced by Gottschalk (2005),
9:262:21557:20:21:72:443:350:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:which is intended to purge the wage series of unobserved measurement error.8
9:263:21633:21:20:88:539:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The procedure relies upon the Bai and Perron (1998 and 2003) method to test for structural
9:264:21723:20:20:72:540:309:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:breaks in the time series context.  The key identifying assumption is that wage changes take place
9:265:21821:20:21:72:540:289:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in  discrete  steps.   Assume  that  an  individual  works  for  T  periods  experiencingswage  changes
9:266:21924:21:20:72:540:268:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:at timeT1...Ts.  The observed wage at time t,wt, is equal to a constantαtplus the unobserved
9:267:22016:20:16:72:176:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:measurement error-t:
9:268:22036:16:14:84:539:232:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:8We also apply this procedure to earnings.  We apply the same procedure to the reported wage series for hourly
9:269:22146:14:11:72:540:218:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:workers and to the reported earnings series for salaried workers.  We refer only to wages in this section for expositional
9:270:22268:11:0:72:113:207:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:simplicity.
10:271:22280:0:24:237:540:672:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:wt=α1+-tt= 1...T1(1)

10:275:22335:37:20:88:539:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The  objective  is  to  estimate  thesbreak  dates  and  thes+ 1  constant  wages.   The  method
10:276:22431:20:21:72:540:545:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:proposed by Bai and Perron proceeds sequentially.  First, using the whole sample of T observations,
10:277:22530:21:20:72:540:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:assume  that  there  is  one  structural  break,  and  pick  the  break  date  that  minimizes  the  sum  of
10:278:22638:20:20:72:540:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:squared residuals (SSR). Then test to see if one can reject the null hypothesis of no break over the
10:279:22738:20:21:72:539:484:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:entire sample against the alternative that there is a break at the point that minimizes the SSR.9If
10:280:22837:21:20:72:540:463:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:one cannot reject the null, then the procedure is finished, and concludes that there are no structural
10:281:22939:20:20:72:540:443:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:breaks in the sample (i.e.,  the wage is constant over the whole sample).  If one can reject,  then
10:282:23038:20:21:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:test for structural breaks in each of the sub-periods identified by the break test.  Again, pick the
10:283:23138:21:20:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:date that minimizes the SSR in each sub-period,  and then test if a significant break is detected
10:284:23235:20:20:72:540:382:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:at that point.  Continue until no significant structural break is detected in any of the remaining
10:285:23333:20:20:72:172:362:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sub-intervals of data.
10:286:23355:20:21:88:539:342:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:One might object that this procedure is biased towards finding wages that are sticky, since the
10:287:23450:21:20:72:540:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:identifying assumption is that wages are set in nominal terms for a certain period of time!  However,
10:288:23551:20:20:72:540:301:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we do not constrain the procedure to assume any minimum number of periods between true wage
10:289:23642:20:21:72:540:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:changes.  So, for instance, if an individual is followed for 48 months, corresponding to 12 interviews,
10:290:23745:21:20:72:540:260:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the procedure can detect up to 10 wage changes.10One might then ask whether the procedure
10:291:23834:20:20:71:539:240:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:would be able to estimate a large number of breaks in a short time series.  This is the important
10:292:23931:20:16:71:377:220:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:issue of the power of the test, which we discuss at length below.
10:293:23996:16:15:84:539:204:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:9Given the short time periods of the wage histories, the critical values for the structural break tests are obtained
10:294:24112:15:11:72:540:189:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:through Monte Carlo simulations.  The Appendix contains a more extensive explanation of the procedure adopted to
10:295:24224:11:7:72:214:178:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:compute the correct critical values.
10:296:24260:7:15:80:539:171:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:10Given that some people are observed for less than 48 months, we calculate a maximum quarterly frequency of
10:297:24368:15:11:72:540:156:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:true  wage  changes  potentially  obtainable.   For  people  interviewed  12  times,  for  example,  such  probability  is  83%
10:298:24495:11:11:72:540:145:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:(=10/12).   Computing  a  weighted  average  of  these  probabilities  across  different  numbers  of  interviews,  we  get  a
10:299:24621:11:11:72:540:134:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:maximum  detectable  quarterly  probability  of  a  true  wage  change  of  56%,  which  is  much  higher  than  we  actually
10:300:24746:11:52:72:106:123:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:estimate
10:301:24754:52:0:303:308:71:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:9
11:302:24755:0:21:88:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Individual examples illustrate how this procedure works.11Figure 1 shows the reported and the
11:303:24848:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:adjusted wage series for “Linda,”  a 40-year-old secretary with high school degree.  The reported
11:304:24945:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:series12shown by the dashed line, is characterized by five wage increases and three wage decreases
11:305:25043:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:over the period considered.  By contrast, the adjusted series, shown by the solid line, shows only
11:306:25141:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:two breaks, from $12.54 to $12.83 and from $12.83 to $13.56 (the last figure being the average of
11:307:25238:20:20:72:226:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the subsequent reported wages).
11:308:25269:20:21:88:539:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Figure 2 reports the distribution of the measurement error as implied by our correction proce-
11:309:25363:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:dure.  As the figure shows, the distribution of the measurement error appears symmetric, with a
11:310:25458:20:20:72:153:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:big spike at zero.
11:311:25476:20:21:88:539:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Figure 3 shows the reported and the adjusted series for the hourly earnings of “Christina,” a
11:312:25569:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:40  year-old  health  care  worker.   Figure  3  highlights  a  potential  problem  with  our  methodology:
11:313:25676:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Low  power  of  the  test  for  structural  breaks  (especially  in  a  short  time  series)  might  lead  us  to
11:314:25789:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:underestimate the probability of a wage change.  If people in our sample with true wage changes
11:315:25884:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:have sufficiently noisy reported wages (because of measurement error), then our test might fail to
11:316:25982:20:20:72:232:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reject the null of no wage change.
11:317:26016:20:21:88:539:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our application of trend-break tests to estimating the average frequency of wage changes raises
11:318:26111:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:several statistical issues.  We present an in-depth discussion of these issues and our solutions in the
11:319:26214:20:20:72:335:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:appendix.  Here we sketch an overview of this material.
11:320:26269:20:21:88:539:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The first problem is that standard F-tests are not the appropriate method to test for a structural
11:321:26367:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:break in wage series, for two conceptually different reasons.  First, even in a setting where the error
11:322:26470:20:20:72:539:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:term  is  i.i.d.   and  Gaussian,  a  standardF-test  can  only  be  used  to  test  a  hypothesis  about  a
11:323:26578:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:structural  change  at  a  given  date.   By  contrast,  we  perform  tests  for  structural  breaks  at  every
11:324:26689:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:possible date and then test for a structural break at the date where such a break appears most
11:325:26783:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:likely, and the distribution of this maximumF-statistic is different from a standardFdistribution.
11:326:26881:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This problem was addressed by Bai and Perron (1998).  Second, the error term is not i.i.d., because
11:327:26980:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the measurement error in wages is not a classical white noise error.  In order to address this second
11:328:27081:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:problem, we need to know the structure of the measurement error.  Fortunately, Gottschalk and
11:329:27174:20:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Huynh  (forthcoming)  provide  the  required  statistics.   They  compare  reported  SIPP  wages  with
11:330:27276:21:15:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:wages for the same people in an administrative data set, where wages are based on tax records and
11:331:27373:15:11:80:333:124:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:11We made up the names of the individuals in these examples.
11:332:27433:11:0:80:403:113:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:12($12.53, $12.55, $12.53, $12.83,$12.83,$12.83, $13.5 $13.61 $13.4 $13.7 $13.61)
12:333:27516:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:thus measured essentially without error.  The difference between true and reported wages allows
12:334:27611:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:them to estimate the measurement error process for the SIPP. Armed with this information, we
12:335:27703:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:address  the  first  and  second  problems  together  via  Monte  Carlo  simulations  (microsimulations).
12:336:27808:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We simulate wage histories for individuals whose wages are constant in the simulations,  but are
12:337:27904:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:assumed to be observed with measurement error of the type found by Gottschalk and Huynh. Based
12:338:27998:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on these simulations, we calculate the critical value for the test of a structural break that will give
12:339:28101:20:21:72:378:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:us the required size of the test (the probability of Type I error).
12:340:28168:21:20:88:539:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Following  this  procedure  ensures  that  we  have  a  consistent  estimator  of  the  break  dates  for
12:341:28273:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:individual wage histories.  However, just tabulating the frequency of these breaks does not give us
12:342:28372:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a consistent estimator of the frequency of nominal wage changes in the population.  Again, there
12:343:28468:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are two reasons.  The first is the size of the test.  Even if all wages were constant,  the fact that
12:344:28569:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we pick the critical values to ensure a certain probability of Type I error means we would falsely
12:345:28667:20:21:72:539:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:conclude thatαpercent of wages change each period, whereαis the size of the test.  By itself, this
12:346:28765:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:force would lead us to conclude that wages are more flexible than is really the case.  But of course
12:347:28865:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:there is also the issue of power — we do not necessarily detect every true break in the wage series.
12:348:28965:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Low power will lead us to make the opposite mistake,  and conclude that wages are more sticky
12:349:29058:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:than is really the case.  We again address the issue of power and its implications for our estimated
12:350:29158:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:wage change frequency via simulation.  Using simulations where true wages change in the sample,
12:351:29253:20:21:72:540:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we can calculate the power of the test.  Once the power of the test is known (of course, the size is
12:352:29353:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:also known, as it is a parameter we specify), we can adjust the raw frequency count of estimated
12:353:29449:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:breaks for both Type I and Type II error, and get a consistent estimate of the actual frequency of
12:354:29547:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:nominal wage changes.  (See the appendix for details.)  It is the frequency adjusted for Type I and
12:355:29646:21:43:72:308:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Type II errors that we report in the next section.
12:356:29696:43:31:72:190:218:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:4  Main Results
12:357:29711:31:20:72:540:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:As noted in the introduction, we face the difficult task of mapping the large set of outcomes in micro
12:358:29813:20:21:72:540:167:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:data into simple macro models.  To guide our exercise, we stick as closely as possible to estimating
12:359:29913:21:20:72:540:146:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:key  parameters  for  the  labor  market  institutions  assumed  in  macro  models  with  nominal  wage
12:360:30016:20:20:72:540:126:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:stickiness,  although these institutions surely characterize only a subset of the rich heterogeneity
12:361:30116:20:0:72:540:106:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of employer-employee relationships present in our micro data.  In macro models of this type, each
13:362:30215:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:worker is assumed to be a monopolistically competitive entrepreneur, supplying a unique variety of
13:363:30313:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:labor and setting his or her own wage.  An example is the behavior of an independent contractor,
13:364:30409:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:such  as  a  plumber  or  electrician,  who  charges  according  to  a  “rate  sheet”  specifying  the  wage
13:365:30517:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:charged  per  hour.   Such  a  worker  may  work  at  a  number  of  different  residences  over  the  course
13:366:30626:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of a day, thus being paid by several different “employers” in quick succession and experiencing a
13:367:30723:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:number of very short “employment spells.”  Or the contractor might work on a single, large project
13:368:30821:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for several weeks or even months, which would show up in the data as a long employment spell.
13:369:30914:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:But the rigidity of the contractor’s nominal wage depends on the frequency with which she or he
13:370:31009:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:revises the rate sheet.  In this framework, the right statistic to examine is the frequency of nominal
13:371:31111:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:wage changes (rate sheet revisions) over the entire sample for which we have data, disregarding any
13:372:31210:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:job transitions as irrelevant.  For this reason, all the results presented in this section refer to the
13:373:31313:20:20:72:466:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:entire wage history of each individual, regardless of his or her employment history.
13:374:31397:20:21:88:539:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:While our data and analysis are at conducted with interviews taking place every four months,
13:375:31489:21:20:72:539:444:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:we report the results at a quarterly frequency for ease of comparison with the previous literature.13
13:376:31590:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 4 reports the frequency of wage adjustment for hourly workers.  The quarterly frequency of
13:377:31686:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:wage adjustment for reported wages is very high.  In the typical quarter for the 1996 panel, 48.1% of
13:378:31787:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:people report a different wage than they reported in the previous interview.  The situation changes
13:379:31886:20:20:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:radically when considering the adjusted series for wages.  In the 1996 panel, in the typical quarter
13:380:31986:20:21:72:378:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:only 17.8% of hourly workers experience a change in their wage.
13:381:32049:21:20:88:539:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Under the assumption that the correction for measurement error is appropriate, we therefore
13:382:32140:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:find evidence of greater wage stickiness than previously found in estimated DSGE models using
13:383:32233:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:aggregate  data  for  the  US  economy.   CEE  (2005),  for  example,  estimated  the  quarterly  Calvo
13:384:32336:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:probability of wage adjustment to be 36% in their benchmark model.  In SW (2007) the benchmark
13:385:32430:20:20:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:estimate  of  the  same  parameter  is  26.2%.   Our  results  are  more  consistent  with  the  findings  of
13:386:32539:20:21:72:540:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Gottshalk (2005), who used the same method but analyzed a previous wave of SIPP data. Gottshalk
13:387:32634:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:does not report exactly the parameter we estimate, but computing the analogous statistic from his
13:388:32731:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:adjusted wage series gives a figure closer to ours (11%).  The difference can be partly explained by
13:389:32831:20:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the fact that Gottschalk analyzes a different time period (1986-1993), and that arguably the US
13:390:32926:21:16:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:labor market became more flexible over time.  Finally, in a recent contribution, Heckel at al (HLM,
13:391:33025:16:7:80:359:123:6:g_d0_f5:6:g_d0_f5:13We transform the results into quarterly results by multiplying by3
13:392:33093:7:0:355:363:116:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:4.
14:393:33097:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2008)  found  the  average  quarterly  frequency  of  wage  adjustment  to  be  35%  for  a  large  sample
14:394:33203:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of French firms.  However, HML have access only to firm-occupation data, therefore they cannot
14:395:33297:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:test the frequency of wage change at the individual level nor correct for measurement error in the
14:396:33395:20:21:72:154:648:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:reported wages.14
14:397:33412:21:20:88:539:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We should note that macro estimates of the nominal wage parameter are not always estimated
14:398:33502:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to be around 0.30.  In fact, CEE (2005) estimate variants of their baseline model, in two of which
14:399:33600:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(no habit formation, and low investment adjustment costs) the estimated degree of wage stickiness
14:400:33697:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is substantially higher, and close to our micro results.  Perhaps future work on estimated DSGE
14:401:33792:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:models should simply follow CEE’s policy and use micro evidence like ours as a way of disciplining
14:402:33890:20:37:72:279:526:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:macro estimates based on aggregate data.15
14:403:33932:37:27:72:168:489:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:4.1  Seasonality
14:404:33948:27:20:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A second question we explore regards the seasonality of the pattern of wage adjustment.  Olivei
14:405:34043:20:21:72:540:442:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and Tenreyro (2008) find that monetary shocks have much larger effects on output if they occur
14:406:34137:21:20:72:540:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the first half of the year than if they occur in the last two quarters.  They explain their findings
14:407:34240:20:20:72:540:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by proposing a model where wage adjustment is seasonal, and is much more likely to take place
14:408:34333:20:21:72:540:381:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the second half of the year.  Their calibrated model assumes that 24% of annual wage changes
14:409:34428:21:20:72:540:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:occur  in  the  first  quarter,  2%  in  the  second  quarter,  32%  in  the  third  quarter,  and  42%  in  the
14:410:34540:20:20:72:540:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:fourth  quarter.   However,  they  explain  that  this  calibration  is  based  on  a  small  sample  of  New
14:411:34649:20:21:72:540:320:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:England firms because “there is no systematic empirical evidence pointing to particular values for
14:412:34747:21:20:72:540:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the [quarterly wage change frequencies].”  We can supply this evidence using direct observation for
14:413:34846:20:20:72:280:279:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a representative sample of the US economy.
14:414:34888:20:20:88:539:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Figure 4 illustrates the frequency of wage adjustment by month.  The frequency of wage ad-

14:416:35076:21:20:72:370:218:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:seasonal pattern assumed in Olivei and Tenreyro’s calibration.
14:417:35138:20:20:88:539:198:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In order to investigate more formally the seasonality in the frequency of wage adjustment, we
14:418:35231:20:21:72:540:178:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:regress the probability of wage adjustment for both the reported and the adjusted wage series on
14:419:35327:21:16:72:540:157:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a set of quarterly dummies, where the excluded category is the frequency of wage changes in the
14:420:35422:16:14:80:539:141:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:14Moreover,  the mean wage in a firm-occupation cell can change even if there is no change in the wage for any
14:421:35532:14:8:72:404:127:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:individual worker, if the composition of the individuals in the cell varies over time
14:422:35617:8:14:80:539:119:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:15CEE (2005, p.  40) write “Our position is that a reasonable contract length is one that matches the duration of
14:423:35730:14:0:72:534:105:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:contracts found in survey evidence.  In this respect, we follow the empirical literature on wage and price frictions.”

15:425:35864:21:20:88:539:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 5 reports the results .  The F-test of joint significance of the quarterly coefficients always
15:426:35964:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rejects the hypothesis that they are all zero.  The results qualitatively support the assumption that
15:427:36065:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:drives  Olivei  and  Tenreyro’s  model:  Wage  changes,  do  in  fact,  appear  to  be  more  likely  in  the
15:428:36174:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:second half of the year, not at the beginning.  However, the magnitude of the difference is much
15:429:36270:20:20:72:540:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:smaller than Olivei and Tenreyro’s calibration assumes.  In our data, the proportion of quarterly
15:430:36367:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:wage changes relative to the total number of wage changes in a year is 23.6% in the first quarter,
15:431:36465:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:24.1% in the second quarter, 26.6% in the third quarter and 25.5% in the last quarter.  Whether
15:432:36560:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:these small differences can explain the differential seasonal effects of monetary policy shocks is an
15:433:36661:20:21:72:310:526:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:open question, but we suspect that they cannot.16
15:434:36710:21:20:88:539:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Interestingly, Heckel et al (2008), using French firm-level data, find evidence that the frequency
15:435:36808:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of wage adjustment is highly seasonal, with a spike in the third quarter.  As the authors emphasize,
15:436:36908:20:21:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:this finding might be due to a very specific institutional feature of the French labor market, where
15:437:37008:21:20:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by law the minimum wage is updated each year in July.  However, there is no such feature in the
15:438:37103:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:US labor market.  Anecdotal evidence, in fact, suggests that in the US wage changes indeed take
15:439:37198:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:place in January in some firms, but in other firms they occur at the hiring date of the worker.  In
15:440:37297:21:36:72:474:383:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:still other firms, wage changes are implemented at the beginning of the fiscal year.17

15:448:37921:20:20:72:540:198:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:absence of heterogeneity is always rejected by the data, as shown by the p-value of the hypothesis
15:449:38019:20:21:72:540:178:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that all the coefficients are zero, there is not much evidence of heterogeneity across industries in

15:452:38323:14:8:72:100:127:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:(2008).
15:453:38330:8:0:80:431:119:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:17In some peculiar cases, the wage changes take place on the birthday of the company!

16:455:38511:21:20:72:275:688:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:display significantly different coefficients.18
16:456:38558:20:20:88:539:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table  7  repeats  the  exercise  of  Table  6,  but  now  for  different  occupations.   The  coefficients
16:457:38665:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the third and fourth columns are relative to the production workers.  Again, we find only few
16:458:38761:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:significant results.  One such result is that there is less wage stickiness in occupations related to
16:459:38862:20:20:72:256:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:services and in managerial occupation.
16:460:38900:20:21:88:539:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The result of relatively little heterogeneity across industries and occupation might seem puzzling.
16:461:38999:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We explored whether this is an artifact of aggregation by exploring the data at the 2-digits level of
16:462:39100:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:disaggregation (for both industries and occupations). While the point estimates display significantly
16:463:39201:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:more dispersion using the more refined classifications, the very small number of observation available
16:464:39303:21:36:72:496:505:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:for each category prevented us from finding differences that are statistically significant.19
16:465:39396:36:27:72:308:469:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:4.3  Downward Nominal Wage Rigidity
16:466:39431:27:21:72:540:442:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In order to address a question typically asked by the labor literature on wage stickiness, we provide
16:467:39532:21:20:72:540:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:some  evidence  on  the  importance  of  downward  nominal  wage  rigidities.   Figures  5  reports  the
16:468:39636:20:20:72:540:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:histogram  of  the  non-zero  adjusted  wage  changes.   In  order  to  avoid  including  outliers  in  the
16:469:39743:20:21:72:540:381:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:calculations, we plot only the inner 98 percentiles of the distributions (that is to say we exclude the
16:470:39846:21:20:72:540:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:lowest and the highest percentiles).  As the graphs show, wage reductions are much less frequent
16:471:39942:20:20:72:540:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:than wage increases.  More precisely, they correspond to 11.5% of the non-zero wage changes.  It is
16:472:40041:20:21:72:540:320:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:important to remember that we are analyzing one of the highest-growth periods of the last several
16:473:40138:21:20:72:477:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:decades, when nominal wage declines were probably less likely than in normal times.
16:474:40221:20:20:88:539:279:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our results show that the period between 1996 and 1999 has been characterized by infrequent
16:475:40312:20:20:72:540:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:nominal wage cuts, which is normally taken as evidence of “downward nominal wage rigidity” in
16:476:40405:20:21:72:540:239:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the literature.  In our view, the term “rigidity” implies a friction, in this case a barrier to wages
16:477:40506:21:20:72:540:218:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tracking the value marginal product of labor.  Many authors have advanced the hypothesis that
16:478:40599:20:20:72:540:198:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:this barrier is stronger when the marginal product declines than when it rises.  In our view, the
16:479:40696:20:21:72:540:178:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:evidence that we have produced (like the similar evidence that has been offered elsewhere in the
16:480:40792:21:16:72:540:157:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:literature) does not establish the existence of a rigidity in this sense.  We think that a rigorous test
16:481:40896:16:15:80:539:141:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:18But  this  is  also  partly  due  to  the  imprecision  of  these  estimates  that  comes  from  the  very  small  number  of
16:482:41023:15:7:72:204:126:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:observations for those industries.
16:483:41057:7:0:80:293:119:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:19the results (not shown) are available upon request.
17:484:41112:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the hypothesis would require a model and further empirical work that would establish a baseline
17:485:41210:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for the expected shape of the distribution of wage.  Absent such a baseline, we can establish that
17:486:41308:20:36:72:512:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:nominal wage cuts are infrequent, but this finding does not have a structural interpretation.
17:487:41401:36:28:72:165:632:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:4.4  Cyclicality
17:488:41417:28:20:72:540:604:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A fourth question of interest is the correlation between the frequency of wage adjustment for hourly
17:489:41517:20:20:72:282:584:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:workers and some macroeconomic variables.
17:490:41558:20:21:88:539:564:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Figure 6 shows a scatter-plot of the cyclical components of the hp-filtered frequency of wage
17:491:41651:21:20:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:adjustment  and  the  realized  monthly  inflation  rate,  computed  as  the  percentage  change  of  the
17:492:41756:20:20:72:540:523:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:US  CPI  index  for  all  goods  and  all  cities.   As  the  figure  shows,  the  two  variables  are  positively
17:493:41870:20:21:72:507:503:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:correlated.  The correlation between the two variables is 0.38 and is statistically significant.
17:494:41966:21:20:88:539:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Figure 7 shows a scatter-plot of the cyclical components of the hp-filtered frequency of wage
17:495:42059:20:20:72:540:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:adjustment against the monthly total US unemployment rate.  The relationship between the two
17:496:42151:20:21:72:524:442:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:variables is positive, with a correlation coefficient of 0.28, but it is not statistically significant .
17:497:42255:21:20:88:539:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In considering these results is important to realize that the answers we provide in this section
17:498:42351:20:20:72:540:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are based on an extremely short time-period (only four years of data), and hence must be considered
17:499:42450:20:21:72:540:381:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with great caution.  Subject to this caveat, the evidence suggests that pure time-dependent models
17:500:42548:21:20:72:540:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of nominal wage rigidity, such as the models of Calvo and Taylor, cannot capture the whole story
17:501:42644:20:20:72:540:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of  infrequent  nominal  wage  changes.   Nominal  wage  adjustments  appear  to  also  have  a  state-
17:502:42747:20:21:72:540:320:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:dependent component.  However, unlike the literature on nominal price rigidity, which has explored
17:503:42845:21:20:72:540:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:state-dependent models of price changes, we are not aware of models of nominal wage rigidity that
17:504:42942:20:20:72:540:279:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are state- rather than time-dependent.  Our results suggest that such models may be necessary.  It
17:505:43040:20:20:72:540:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:would be useful to redo an exercise like ours using data from periods where the inflation and/or
17:506:43136:20:21:72:540:239:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:unemployment rates were high, to see if the evidence of state-dependent wage changes is stronger
17:507:43232:21:43:72:147:218:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in such periods.
17:508:43248:43:31:72:217:175:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:5  Salaried Workers
17:509:43267:31:21:72:540:144:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:While we chose to present our baseline results using only the sample of hourly workers for whom
17:510:43362:21:20:72:540:123:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we have hourly wage data,  here we also present estimates obtained using the sample of salaried
17:511:43457:20:0:72:540:103:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:workers.  In order to do that, we focus on monthly earnings (as opposed to hourly earnings) and we
18:512:43557:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:apply the same measurement error correction procedure to earnings that we used earlier for wages.
18:513:43654:21:20:88:539:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table  8  reports  the  basic  results  for  salaried  workers.   The  average  quarterly  frequency  of
18:514:43758:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:earnings change is about 65%.  The results we get with the adjusted series are much smaller, 4.9%.
18:515:43856:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In order to gain intuition about what might drive these extreme results, it is useful to illustrate
18:516:43955:21:20:72:139:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:two examples.
18:517:43968:20:20:88:539:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Figure 8 shows the reported and adjusted series of monthly earnings for “Mark”, a 42-year-old
18:518:44061:20:21:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:manager at a business service firm.  This example clarifies how our procedure is able to capture any
18:519:44161:21:20:72:540:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:kind of change in earnings, provided that they are sufficiently large or persistent.  Figure 8 report
18:520:44262:20:20:72:540:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:instead the earnings history of “Peter”, a 39-year-old mechanic.  The reported series is very noisy,
18:521:44362:20:21:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with continuous ups and downs in the reported earnings.  Given the procedure explained in section
18:522:44459:21:20:72:540:505:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:three, the reader will not be surprised by seeing that in such a case the suggested adjusted earnings
18:523:44560:20:20:72:540:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:profile is totally flat.  The predominance of reported earnings’ histories similar to the one of Peter
18:524:44662:20:21:72:307:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is the likely cause of the results found in Table 8.
18:525:44714:21:20:88:539:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We  repeat  the  same  exercises  we  did  for  hourly  workers  on  the  sample  of  salaried  workers.
18:526:44818:20:20:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Figure 10 shows how the frequency of earnings changes varies by calendar month.  It is hard to see
18:527:44916:20:21:72:540:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:any sizable seasonal effect.  We investigate this hypothesis more formally, and Table 9 reports the
18:528:45015:21:20:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:results.  While we always reject the hypothesis that wage changes are uniform over the year, the
18:529:45111:20:20:72:320:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:magnitudes of the differences are always very small.
18:530:45163:20:21:88:539:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The result for heterogeneity across industries and occupations are reported in Tables 10 and 11.
18:531:45259:21:20:72:540:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:While Service and Trade still exhibit higher wage flexibility than Manufacturing,  Transport and
18:532:45355:20:20:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Communication does not seem to have greater wage flexibility than Manufacturing in the case of
18:533:45449:20:21:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:salaried workers.  On the other hand, for salaried workers the only occupation category that display
18:534:45549:21:20:72:540:261:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a significant difference from the production workers are the service workers, who display more wage
18:535:45648:20:20:72:119:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:flexibility.
18:536:45660:20:21:88:539:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Finally, correlating the frequency of earnings adjustment for salaried worker with macro vari-
18:537:45754:21:20:72:540:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ables, we confirm a positive relationship with the unemployment and inflation rate, as in the case
18:538:45852:20:20:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the hourly workers.  The correlation with the monthly inflation rate is slightly lower (0.34).  The
18:539:45954:20:0:72:473:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:correlation with the unemployment rate is 0.20 and it is not statistically significant.
19:540:46043:0:32:72:328:709:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:6  The Importance of Sticky Wages
19:541:46076:32:20:72:540:677:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We evaluate the significance of our findings for macroeconomics by using our parameter estimates
19:542:46172:20:20:72:540:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in  a  benchmark  medium-scale  macro  model.   We  use  the  DSGE  model  proposed  by  Smets  and
19:543:46271:20:21:72:540:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Wouters (2008; henceforth SW).20We take the model exactly as presented in their article, and we
19:544:46366:21:20:72:223:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:performed two simple exercises.
19:545:46397:20:20:88:539:596:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:First,  we  estimate  all  the  parameters  of  the  model  through  Bayesian  techniques  after  fixing
19:546:46501:20:21:72:539:576:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:the parameter for wage stickiness at 0.178 (our baseline result for hourly workers) and at 0.105.21
19:547:46600:21:20:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Second, we compute the impulse response functions produced by the model following a monetary
19:548:46692:20:20:72:540:535:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:shock using both the parameter estimates of the original SW paper and the estimates we obtaine
19:549:46786:20:20:72:324:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:from our first exercise using data for hourly workers.
19:550:46840:20:21:88:539:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 12 reports the results obtained for some key parameters of the model.  The first column
19:551:46933:21:20:72:540:474:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reports the mode found in SW, the second column displays the posterior mode we find after fixing
19:552:47029:20:20:72:540:454:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the wage stickiness parameter to 0.178 and the third column what we get with 0.105.  As the table
19:553:47126:20:21:72:540:434:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:shows, the parameters related to price stickiness, price indexation and wage indexation do not differ
19:554:47227:21:20:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:dramatically among the three cases.  Also, the elasticity of intertemporal substitution appears to
19:555:47325:20:20:72:540:393:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:change  very little.  Interestingly instead,  the  elasticity  of labor supply increases  a bit  under our
19:556:47431:20:21:72:540:373:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:specification, going from 1.92 to 2.28 to 2.60.  Finally, the capital share in the production function
19:557:47533:21:20:72:540:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:increases in our specification from the 0.19 obtained by SW to a more standard value of 0.3, which
19:558:47631:20:20:72:433:332:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is also more consistent with long-run evidence from national income shares.
19:559:47706:20:21:88:539:312:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In  terms  of  the  dynamic  responses  to  shocks,  Figure  11  reports  the  impulse  responses  to  a
19:560:47810:21:20:72:540:291:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:monetary  policy  shock.   The  solid  line  is  the  impulse  response  from  the  SW  model  using  the
19:561:47915:20:20:72:540:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:parameters reported in their paper, the long-dashed line reports the results from the model using
19:562:48012:20:21:72:540:251:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:our parameter estimates for hourly workers, and the dot-dashed line the results obtained for the
19:563:48108:21:20:72:540:230:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:totality of the workers. As expected we find that with our estimates the model produces a larger and
19:564:48208:20:20:72:540:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:more persistent response of output and consumption to a monetary shock.  This is not particularly
19:565:48305:20:21:72:540:190:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:surprising, since the micro data indicate that wage stickiness is higher than SW estimated based on
19:566:48404:21:20:72:540:169:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:aggregate data, while our estimates of the other structural parameters are substantially unchanged.
19:567:48503:20:16:72:540:149:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The responses of hours do not differ dramatically, while the responses of the real wage and of price
19:568:48603:16:11:80:359:133:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:20We use the code of the model that is available on the AER website
19:569:48670:11:15:80:539:122:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:21Roughly the weighted average of the findings obtained for hourly workers and salaried workers using the numbers
19:570:48783:15:0:72:160:107:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:of workers as weights.
20:571:48807:0:21:72:404:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:inflation appear to be damped and more persistent in our estimation.
20:572:48875:21:20:88:539:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Consistent  with  intuition,  the  findings  show  that  higher  wage  stickiness  makes  it  easier  for
20:573:48980:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:macroeconomic models to match the stylized fact that monetary shocks cause persistent changes
20:574:49073:20:44:72:392:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in real output and small but relatively persistent changes in prices.
20:575:49142:44:31:72:221:604:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:7  Hazard Functions
20:576:49161:31:20:72:540:573:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Thus far we have intentionally limited ourselves to computing a statistic that can be interpreted as
20:577:49261:20:21:72:540:553:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the constant hazard of a wage (earnings) change, which is also the statistic estimated in macroe-
20:578:49358:21:20:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:conometric models.  However,  our data allow us to test whether the hazard is truly constant by
20:579:49453:20:20:72:540:512:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:estimating hazard functions.  The estimated hazards let us compare the fit of Calvo-style models of
20:580:49552:20:21:72:540:492:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:wage rigidity—which imply a constant hazard of experiencing a wage (earnings) change—vis a vis
20:581:49646:21:20:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:other alternatives, such as contract renegotiations at fixed intervals as in the Taylor (1980) model,
20:582:49747:20:20:72:396:451:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:which would imply hazard functions that peak at certain durations.
20:583:49813:20:20:88:539:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:To explore this issue we first use the reported and the adjusted wage (earnings) series to estimate
20:584:49912:20:21:72:540:411:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a discrete-time hazard model, where an exit is defined as a change of the reported (or adjusted)
20:585:50008:21:20:72:539:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:wage (or earnings)22.  A new spell starts each time a new wage (or level of earnings) is observed, and
20:586:50110:20:20:71:539:370:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we include in the sample all non-left-censored spells.  We control for age, gender and educational
20:587:50208:20:21:71:539:350:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:attainment, and we include a full set of duration dummies.  We use the estimated coefficients on
20:588:50304:21:20:71:448:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the duration dummies to find the hazard function for wage (earnings) changes.
20:589:50381:20:20:88:539:309:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Figure 12 shows the estimates of the hazard obtained using the reported wage series for the
20:590:50472:20:21:71:539:289:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:hourly workers and the reported earnings series for salaried workers.  The hazards are decreasing,
20:591:50570:21:20:71:539:268:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with more than half of the respondents experiencing a wage change in the first four months.  De-
20:592:50666:20:20:71:539:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:clining hazards imply that the highest probability of having a wage change is immediately after
20:593:50761:20:21:71:539:228:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the previous wage change.  This pattern is intuitively unreasonable, suggesting that there is indeed
20:594:50861:21:20:71:539:207:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:significant measurement error in the reported wage.  Figure 13 reports the estimates of the hazard
20:595:50959:20:20:71:539:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:obtained using the adjusted wage and earnings series.  Here, by contrast, there is a clear peak at
20:596:51057:20:21:71:191:167:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:12 months in both series.
20:597:51082:21:20:88:539:146:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We  conclude  that  Taylor-type  fixed-length  contracts  have  stronger  empirical  support  than
20:598:51180:20:16:71:539:126:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Calvo-type constant-hazard models.  However, the fact that the wage change frequency is almost
20:599:51274:16:0:80:273:110:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:22see Box-Steffensmeier and Jones (2004) p.  73.
21:600:51324:0:21:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:flat over the calendar year (Figure 4 and Table 5) suggests that the starting time of the wage con-
21:601:51423:21:20:72:540:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tracts is uniformly staggered throughout the year.  This pattern is, of course, the one that gives the
21:602:51525:20:20:72:540:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:largest contract multiplier, and creates maximum persistence of the real effects of nominal shocks.
21:603:51624:20:21:72:540:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Although it gives the greatest persistence, uniform staggering is typically found to be an unstable
21:604:51723:21:20:72:540:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Nash equilibrium, so it is interesting that we are finding indirect evidence of staggered rather than
21:605:51824:20:43:72:218:607:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:synchronized wage contracts.23
21:606:51854:43:32:72:173:564:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:8  Conclusion
21:607:51867:32:20:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Since we already outlined the main results in the introduction, we conclude by suggesting directions
21:608:51967:20:20:72:225:512:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that future research might take.
21:609:51999:20:21:88:539:492:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:First,  it is important to understand why the stickiness estimated from micro data is greater
21:610:52092:21:20:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:than the one estimated from aggregate data using Bayesian techniques.  Idiosyncratic measurement
21:611:52188:20:20:72:540:451:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:error, such a large concern in the analysis of micro data, is unlikely to be the explanation.  Such
21:612:52287:20:20:72:540:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:errors would average out, and contribute little to the variance of any aggregate wage series.  One
21:613:52385:20:21:72:540:411:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:possibility  is  that  the  difference  is  due  purely  to  aggregation  issues:  For  example,  if  high-wage
21:614:52496:21:20:72:540:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:workers’ wages also adjust more frequently, then the aggregate wage will appear to more flexible
21:615:52592:20:20:72:540:370:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:than the average worker’s wage.  We plan to investigate this possibility using our data, but since
21:616:52690:20:21:72:540:350:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:high-wage workers are likely to be salaried workers, whose adjusted earnings we find to be more
21:617:52785:21:20:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sticky than the wages of hourly workers, this explanation appears unlikely.  The reasons for this
21:618:52882:20:20:72:540:309:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:micro-macro gap should shed light on the perplexing issues of aggregation that must concern all
21:619:52977:20:21:72:317:289:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:macroeconomists interested in “structural” models.
21:620:53027:21:20:88:539:268:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Second,  the  lack  of  sizable  seasonality  in  wage  changes  leaves  an  open  question:  What  can
21:621:53130:20:20:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:explain the estimated differential effects of monetary shocks occurring in different quarters?  Naka-
21:622:53231:20:21:72:514:228:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:mura and Steinsson’s (2008) finding that price adjustment is seasonal suggests one answer.24
21:623:53323:21:20:88:539:207:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Third,  the findings on the shape of the hazard functions suggest that we should explore the
21:624:53415:20:17:72:540:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:properties of models based on fixed-length wage contracts, as in Taylor (1980), in addition to the
21:625:53513:17:14:80:539:170:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:23Our findings are consistent with the empirical studies of Taylor (1983) and Cecchetti (1984), who found staggered
21:626:53628:14:11:72:540:156:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:wage setting in union contracts.  However,  in the US labor market,  very few workers are covered by formal union
21:627:53741:11:11:72:540:145:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:contracts, so it is useful to extend their results to a representative sample of the US labor force.  Some notable papers
21:628:53862:11:11:72:540:134:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:show that in richer models staggering might be a stable Nash equilibrium after all.  See,  for example,  Fethke and
21:629:53977:11:7:72:329:123:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:Policano (1984), Ball and Cecchetti (1988) and Bhaskar (2002).
21:630:54039:7:0:80:404:116:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:24Of course, Dupor and Han (2009) question the robustness of the finding itself.
22:631:54121:0:21:72:461:709:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:very tractable stochastic-length contracting models in the style of Calvo (1983).25
22:632:54204:21:20:88:539:688:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Fourth, our desire to estimate the key parameter of one particular macro-labor model led us
22:633:54295:20:20:71:539:668:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to  focus  on  wage  histories  and  disregard  employment  histories.   However,  the  implication  that
22:634:54400:20:21:71:539:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:employment  history  is  irrelevant  is  not  shared  by  all  macro  models  of  the  labor  market.   For
22:635:54507:21:20:71:539:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:example,  in  the  literature  on  search  and  matching  in  business  cycle  models,  the  wage  stickiness
22:636:54616:20:20:71:539:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that  matters  for  macro  is  the  degree  of  (real)  wage  rigidity  for  new  hires.   We  plan  to  explore
22:637:54728:20:21:71:253:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:further these issues in future research.
22:638:54768:21:20:88:539:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Finally, from an epistemological point of view, we hope that this work will increase the awareness
22:639:54866:20:20:71:539:546:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that greater communication between economists working in different fields (in this case, macro and
22:640:54964:20:421:71:402:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:labor economics) can produce valuable insights at relatively low cost.
22:641:55034:421:0:80:207:105:6:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f6:25See for instance Knell (2010).
23:642:55068:0:25:72:240:709:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:A  Technical Appendix
23:643:55089:25:13:72:540:684:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This appendix describes the methods we use to (1) obtain critical values to test for changes in wages
23:644:55190:13:14:72:539:671:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:when the assumptions for the standardFtest are not met, (2) estimate the power of these tests
23:645:55283:14:13:71:539:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and (3) obtain unbias estimates of the probability of a wage change by correcting for the impact
23:646:55379:13:30:71:204:644:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of type I and type II errors.
23:647:55408:30:20:71:189:614:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A.1  Critical values
23:648:55428:20:14:71:540:594:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:StandardFtest cannot be used to test for wage changes since the necessary assumptions for the
23:649:55521:14:13:71:540:580:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:Ftests are violated in two conceptually different ways.  First measurement error in earnings is not
23:650:55620:13:14:71:539:567:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:classical.26The critical value must, therefore, be adjusted to take account of this violation of the
23:651:55720:14:13:71:539:553:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:assumptions.  Second, the test for structural breaks used in this paper is a test of the maximum
23:652:55816:13:14:71:539:540:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of a set ofFstatistics rather than the test of a singleFstatistic.  Bai and Perron (1998) show
23:653:55910:14:14:71:539:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that the appropriate test for structural breaks must take into account that the test is based on
23:654:56006:14:13:71:540:512:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the maximum ofltest statistics, wherelis the length of the period being analyzed.  The standard
23:655:56101:13:14:71:539:499:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:critical values are no longer applicable since the critical value for the maximum ofltest statistics
23:656:56201:14:13:72:309:485:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is higher the critical value for a singleFstatistic.
23:657:56253:13:14:88:539:472:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We address these problems by using Monte Carlo simulations that simulate data with the same
23:658:56344:14:13:71:539:458:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:non-classical measurement structure found in the SIPP by Gottschalk and Huynh (forthcoming).
23:659:56436:13:14:71:539:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Their estimate of the structure of measurement error in the SIPP was obtained from SIPP earnings
23:660:56532:14:13:71:539:431:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:records matched to uncapped W-2 earnings records in the Detailed Earnings Records (DER) file.
23:661:56625:13:14:71:539:418:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Measurement error is defined as the difference between DER earnings and reported earnings in the
23:662:56721:14:14:71:539:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:SIPP. These matched records are used to estimate the autocorrelation of measurement error (0.54)
23:663:56817:14:13:71:248:390:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:and the signal-to-noise ratio (2.64).27
23:664:56856:13:14:88:539:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In order to obtain critical values to test the null hypothesis of no change in wages, we generate
23:665:56953:14:13:72:539:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2,000 wage profiles of lengthlwith no change in wages.28We then apply the method described

23:677:57992:11:11:72:540:180:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:crucially on whether the negative correlation is between group (the expected value of measurement error is lower for

23:679:58219:11:11:72:540:158:9:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f6:an individual’s wages rise).  We assume the correlation is between group so mean reversion affects the mean but not
