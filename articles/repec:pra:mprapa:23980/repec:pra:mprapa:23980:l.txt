2:24:382:14:13:89:92:551:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B: 
2:25:382:13:14:89:505:538:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:The  notion  of  interdependent  preferences  has  a  long  history  in  economic 
2:26:464:14:14:89:505:524:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:thought.  It    can  be  found  in  the  works  of    authors such  as  Hume,    Rae, 
2:27:550:14:14:89:504:510:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Genovesi,   Smith,  Marx  and  Mill  among  others.  In the  20th  century,  the  idea 
2:28:637:14:14:89:505:496:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:became   more   widespread      mainly   through   the   works   of   Veblen   and 
2:29:720:14:13:89:505:482:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Duesenberry.  Recently,  an  increasing  number  of  theorists  are  interested  in 
2:30:804:13:14:89:504:469:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:issues  like  reference  income,  relative  consumption and  positional  goods 
2:31:883:14:14:89:504:455:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:which are all based on the concept of interdependent preferences.  However, 
2:32:959:14:14:89:504:441:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:such  preferences  were  never  part  of  the  corpus  of  orthodox  theory.  For 
2:33:1041:14:14:89:504:427:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:instance,   although Pareto and Marshall were aware of their existence, they 
2:34:1118:14:13:89:505:413:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:rejected their incorporation into economic theory. There were various reasons 
2:35:1196:13:14:89:505:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:for  this  rejection.  The  structure  of  mainstream  economic  methodology  might 
2:36:1280:14:14:89:505:386:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:be  one  reason.  Another  reason  had  to  do  with  the  theoretical  implications  of 
2:37:1369:14:14:89:505:372:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:adopting  interdependent  preferences.    The    paper  discusses  the    main 
2:38:1448:14:14:89:505:358:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:historical  aspects  of  this  idea  in  relation  to  the mainstream  resistance  to 
2:39:1534:14:11:89:326:344:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:incorporate it in orthodox economic theory.

3:54:1985:14:28:125:505:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The  concept  of  interdependent  preferences,  and  its closely  related 
3:55:2059:28:27:89:505:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:notion of positional goods, are present in the works of a  substantial  number 
3:56:2138:27:28:89:508:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of economists in the history of economic thought. One can even find the basis  
3:57:2217:28:28:89:505:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of  the  above  ideas  in  the  theories  of  18th  century authors  such  as    A. 
3:58:2301:28:27:89:508:620:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Genovesi and  D. Hume and also in  a great number of classical economists  
3:59:2376:27:28:89:505:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:such as  Smith, Ricardo, Marx,  Senior, Mill  and many others, who  discuss 
3:60:2452:28:27:89:504:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:these  issues  in  sympathetic  terms.  In  addition,  it plays  a  central  role  in  the 
3:61:2543:27:28:89:504:538:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:contributions    of  many  very  well-known  post-marginalist  economists  such  as 
3:62:2627:28:28:89:505:510:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:T.  Veblen,  A.C.  Pigou  and  J.  Duesenberry.  In  the  last  few  years,  there  is  a 
3:63:2717:28:27:89:504:482:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:renewed  interest  in  the  idea  especially  in  many  macroeconomic  and    labour 
3:64:2802:27:28:89:505:455:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:papers  and  also  in  the  modern  research area  of  subjective  well-being.  Many 
3:65:2887:28:27:89:505:427:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:theorists   in   the   above   fields   have   found   that   the   incorporation   of 
3:66:2974:27:28:89:505:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:interdependent   preferences   can   help   explain   a   variety      of   economic 
3:67:3059:28:28:89:505:372:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:phenomena  such  as  wage  rigidity,  savings  patterns  and  the    Easterlin 
3:68:3138:28:27:89:385:344:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:paradox (see Bruni, 2004; Drakopoulos, forthcoming).   
3:69:3193:27:28:126:504:317:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:In  spite  of  the  above,  it  is  still  not  accepted  by the  majority  of 
3:70:3272:28:27:90:505:289:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:mainstream  economists  who  continue  to  assume  independent  individual 
3:71:3347:27:28:90:504:262:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:preferences.  There  are  a  number  of  reasons  for  this  attitude  which  have 
3:72:3430:28:28:90:508:234:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:mainly  to  do  with  the  methodological  foundations  of  mainstream  economics.  
3:73:3514:28:27:90:505:206:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:More  specifically,  the  notion  of  interdependent  preferences  was  deliberately 
3:74:3599:27:28:90:505:179:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:ignored by the founders of modern mainstream economics such as V. Pareto 
3:75:3672:28:27:90:505:151:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and A. Marshall.  Pareto  thought that interpersonal preferences were not part 
3:76:3751:27:28:90:504:124:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of his definition of “logical action” in economics and  that their analysis belong 
3:77:3834:28:0:90:505:96:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:to  sociology  and  not  to  economics.  Marshall  was  aware  of  status-driven 
4:78:3916:0:27:89:505:758:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:consumption  but he condemned such expenditures, believing that they were 
4:79:3990:27:28:89:504:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:rooted  in  personal  vanity  and  created  envy  in  others.  Thus,  Marshall’s  and 
4:80:4076:28:27:89:505:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Pareto’s  negative  stance  towards    incorporating  the  idea  of  interpersonal 
4:81:4159:27:28:89:505:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:preferences  can  be  seen  as  an  important  reason  why such  preferences  did 
4:82:4241:28:28:89:505:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:not become part of  the corpus of subsequent mainstream analysis and also 
4:83:4315:28:27:89:504:620:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of mainstream welfare economics. Mainstream reactions towards the work of 
4:84:4389:27:28:89:505:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:J.  Duesenberry  on  consumption  theory,  which  is  based  on  the  idea  of 
4:85:4468:28:27:89:505:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:interdependent preferences, is  a more modern representative example of this 
4:86:4545:27:28:89:505:538:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:stance.  It  seems  that  the  mainstream  methodological  preconception  against 
4:87:4627:28:28:89:505:510:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:incorporating psychological and sociological elements in economic theory and 
4:88:4704:28:27:89:505:482:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:also  the  methodological  prevalence  of  economic  agents  characterized  by 
4:89:4783:27:28:89:505:455:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:selfish  behaviour,  were  two  crucial  reasons  for  the  negative  mainstream 
4:90:4864:28:27:89:142:427:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:attitude.   
4:91:4876:27:28:125:508:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The  paper  will  start  with  a  review  of  the  presence of  interdependent 
4:92:4955:28:28:89:505:372:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:preferences  in  the  history  of  economic  ideas.  Namely,  it  will  argue  that  the 
4:93:5044:28:27:89:505:344:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:idea was present in the works of many pre-classical and classical economists. 
4:94:5122:27:28:89:505:317:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:The  next  section  will  show  that  this  presence  continued  in  the  work  of 
4:95:5205:28:27:89:505:289:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:theorists    such    as    Veblen    and    Pigou    who    explored    the    analytical 
4:96:5295:27:28:89:505:262:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:consequences  of  such  preferences.  The  fourth  section  of  the  paper  will 
4:97:5376:28:28:89:504:234:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:discuss  how    Pareto’s  and  Marshall’s    negative  stance,  effectively  led  to  the 
4:98:5466:28:27:89:505:206:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:abandonment  of  such  preferences  from  subsequent  mainstream  economic 
4:99:5541:27:28:89:505:179:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:theorizing. The following section will discuss the mainstream attitude towards 
4:100:5620:28:27:89:505:151:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the   work   of   Duesenberry   as   the   main  example   of   the continuation   of 
4:101:5706:27:0:89:505:124:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:mainstream  disregard  and  also  of  the  possible  reasons  for  this.  The  sixth 
5:102:5792:0:27:89:505:758:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:section  will  provide  a  brief  discussion  of    the  more  recent  developments  on 
5:103:5880:27:28:89:418:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:this matter.  Finally, a concluding section will close the paper.

5:109:6036:14:27:125:504:634:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The  general  idea  that  individual  preferences    are  influenced  by  the 
5:110:6114:27:28:89:505:607:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:preferences  and  actions  of  other  individuals  is  based  on  the  social  nature  of 
5:111:6204:28:28:89:505:579:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:human beings. In fact, one can argue that the social nature of man implies the 
5:112:6283:28:27:89:505:551:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:behavioural  importance  of  interdependent  preferences  and  also  of  positional 
5:113:6367:27:28:89:504:524:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:goods. Clearly, the social dimension of human nature is not a novel idea since

5:116:6619:28:28:89:508:441:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Antonio  Genovesi  (1713-68)  is  one  of  the  first  authors  whose  social  and  
5:117:6703:28:27:89:508:413:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:economic  thinking    is  characterized  by  an    emphasis  on  the  sociality  of  
5:118:6788:27:28:89:423:386:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:human nature. As Genovesi puts it in an indicative statement:  
5:119:6851:28:20:107:505:358:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:We are “created in such a way as to be touched necessarily, by a musical 
5:120:6924:20:21:107:505:338:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:sympathy,  by  pleasure  and  internal  satisfaction,  as  soon,  as  we  meet 
5:121:7003:21:21:107:505:317:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:another man no human being not even the most cruel and hardened can 
5:122:7071:21:21:107:505:296:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:enjoy pleasures in which no one else participates (Genovesi, 1766, quoted 
5:123:7145:21:20:107:218:275:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:in Bruni, 2007, p.31)

5:125:7167:28:27:89:505:227:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Furthermore,  human  sociality  is  seen  as  the  main    function  of  society  given 
5:126:7255:27:28:89:505:200:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:that  for    Genovesi    the  chief  advantage  of  society is  not  to  be  found  in  its 
5:127:7347:28:28:89:505:172:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:production  of  material  goods,  but  in  the  enjoyment of  social  relationships

5:129:7452:27:28:125:504:117:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Writing  in  the  same  period,  Sir  James  Steuart’s  economic  work  can 
5:130:7527:28:0:89:505:89:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:also be seen as having grasped the basis of interdependent preferences and 
6:131:7603:0:27:89:505:758:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:positional  goods.  As  he  writes:  “the  moment    of  person  begins  to  live  by  his 
6:132:7694:27:28:89:505:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:industry, let his livelihood be ever so poor, he immediately forms little objects 
6:133:7776:28:27:89:505:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of  ambition,  compares  his  situation  with  that  of his fellows  who  are  a  degree 
6:134:7865:27:28:89:505:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:above him, and considers a shade more of ease, ..... as an advancement, not 
6:135:7941:28:28:89:505:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of   his   happiness   only,   but   also   of   his   rank”   (Steuart,   1767,   p.   272). 
6:136:8035:28:27:89:508:620:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Furthermore,  he   seems   to  have   anticipated   the   well-known   concept  of  
6:137:8119:27:28:89:245:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:“conspicuous consumption”.  
6:138:8147:28:20:111:483:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:“Those,  however,  who  are  systematically  luxurious, that  is,  from  a

6:146:8646:13:28:125:505:407:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:D.  Hume  was  well  aware  of  the  importance  of    the  social  aspect  of 
6:147:8725:28:28:89:505:379:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:human  behaviour.  As  he  states:  “The  passions  are  so  contagious,  that  they 
6:148:8810:28:27:89:504:351:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:pass  with  the  greatest  facility  from  one  person  to another,  and  produce 
6:149:8892:27:28:89:505:324:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:correspondent movements in all human breasts” (Hume, 1736, p.605). Similar 
6:150:8967:28:27:89:505:296:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:to this,  is Hume’s strong objection to the universal assumption of self-interest 
6:151:9049:27:28:89:505:269:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:which  implies  autonomous  and  thus  non-interdependence  of    individual 
6:152:9126:28:28:89:159:241:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:preferences: 
6:153:9139:28:20:107:505:213:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:“So  far  from  thinking  that  men  have  no  affection  for  anything  beyond 
6:154:9219:20:21:107:505:193:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:themselves, I am of opinion, that though it be rare to meet with one, who 
6:155:9293:21:21:107:505:172:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:loves any single person better than himself; yet ‘tis rare to meet with one in

7:159:9490:0:27:125:505:758:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The  idea  of  interdependent  preferences  can  also  be found  in  many 
7:160:9564:27:28:89:505:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:classical  economists.  Adam  Smith  recognized  that  individuals  engage  in 
7:161:9643:28:27:89:505:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:social comparisons. Apart from the  natural human motives, such as  the "love 
7:162:9721:27:28:89:505:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of  life",  the  "dread  of  dissolution",  the  "desire  of  the  continuance  and 
7:163:9805:28:28:89:505:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:perpetuity of the species", etc. (Smith, 1759, p. 77, ft), he also included   "the 
7:164:9888:28:27:89:504:620:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:love  of  distinction"  (1759,  p.  50).  The  basis  of    this  motive  is    the  human 
7:165:9979:27:28:89:505:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:"vanity  which  is    always  founded  upon  the  belief  of  our  being  the  object  of 
7:166:10069:28:27:89:504:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:attention  and  approbation"  (1759,  p.  50),  and  is     "natural  to  man"  (1759,  p. 
7:167:10160:27:28:89:505:538:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:182). The idea of  comparison of our income to a class or group of individuals 
7:168:10239:28:28:89:505:510:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:is  also  present  in  his  thought  (In  the  twentieth  century,  this  idea  became 
7:169:10326:28:27:89:402:482:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:known a “keeping up with the Jones’s” ). In Smith’s words: 
7:170:10385:27:21:107:505:455:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:“The  desire  of  becoming  the  proper  objects  of  this respect,  of  deserving

7:172:10549:21:20:107:505:413:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:strongest  of  all  our  desires,  and  our  anxiety  to  obtain  the  advantages  of 
7:173:10635:20:21:107:505:393:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:fortune is accordingly much more excited and irritated by this desire, than

7:175:10794:21:20:107:454:351:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:which are always very easily supplied." (Smith, 1759, pp. 212-3).

7:178:10860:14:28:125:505:303:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Adam  Smith’s  contemporary,    John  Rae  was  also  well-aware  of  the 
7:179:10934:28:27:89:505:275:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:power  of  consumption  imitation.  Rae’s  ideas  on  the subject  are  quite  similar 
7:180:11021:27:28:89:505:248:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:with the ones expressed subsequently  by T. Veblen, although it is not clear if 
7:181:11101:28:27:89:505:220:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Veblen  was  aware  of  Rae’s  work  (see  Edgell  and  Tilman,  1991).  As  Rae 
7:182:11182:27:28:89:131:193:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:states:  
7:183:11191:28:21:116:483:165:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:“Their [i.e. of individuals] consumption is regulated, ill a great degree, 
7:184:11266:21:20:116:483:144:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:by  the  influence  of  the  imitative  propensity.  We  may  form  a  near 
7:185:11342:20:21:116:483:124:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:guess whether a person is in the custom of drinking wine, or tea, or

8:188:11561:20:21:116:367:738:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:the passion of vanity.” (Rae , 1834, pp. 293-4).

8:190:11610:21:27:90:505:696:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Rae  also  discusses  further  the  idea  of  conspicuous consumption  (influenced 
8:191:11693:27:28:90:505:669:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:to  a  large  extent  by  Adam  Smith)1.    He  attributed  such  behavior    to  the 
8:192:11779:28:27:89:504:641:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:selfishness and vanity of individuals: “It is not, indeed, to be disputed, that the 
8:193:11863:27:28:89:505:614:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:rarity  and  costliness  of  the  liquors,  and  other  similar  commodities  consumed 
8:194:11950:28:28:89:505:586:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:by an individual, may heighten greatly the absolute pleasure he derives from 
8:195:12027:28:27:89:505:558:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:them.  This  arises  from  a  trait  in  the  character  of man,  which  we  have  every 
8:196:12116:27:28:89:504:531:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:day  opportunities  of  observing.  The  attention  is  always  roused  in  a  greater 
8:197:12203:28:27:89:505:503:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:degree  by  an  object,  when  it  excites  more  than  one faculty”  (Rae,  1834,  p. 
8:198:12290:27:28:89:505:476:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:268). Similarly, Rae seems to have distinguished between mere luxuries and 
8:199:12365:28:28:89:505:448:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:what were to become known subsequently as “Giffen goods”. The demand for 
8:200:12438:28:27:89:505:420:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:such goods falls if there is a considerable drop in their price: “Were pearls, or 
8:201:12520:27:28:89:505:393:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:lace, to be got for one tenth of the labor that must now be given for them, they 
8:202:12601:28:27:89:428:365:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:would go completely out of fashion” (Rae, 1834, pp. 270, 292).  
8:203:12665:27:28:125:504:338:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:A. Cournot has a very similar approach to Rae’s observation that a fall 
8:204:12737:28:28:89:504:310:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:in the price  of some luxury goods will certainly reduce their demand.  Cournot 
8:205:12817:28:27:89:169:282:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:admitted that:  
8:206:12833:27:21:116:505:255:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:“There  are,  in  fact,  some  objects  of  whim  and  luxury  which  are  only 
8:207:12913:21:21:116:505:234:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:desirable  on  account  of  their  rarity  and  of  the  high  price  which  is  the 
8:208:12998:21:20:116:505:213:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:consequence thereof. If any one should succeed in carrying out cheaply

8:211:13217:21:53:116:505:151:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:should  cease  to  be  used  in  sets  of  jewellery,  and  should  disappear  as

9:219:13657:27:28:90:504:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the    consumption  pattern  is  socially  determined.  The  notion  of  interpersonal 
9:220:13744:28:28:90:505:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:preferences  is  present  when  he  argues  that    “an  individual  man    is  called 
9:221:13831:28:27:90:505:620:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:luxurious,  in  comparison  with  other  men,  of  the  same  community  and  in  the 
9:222:13917:27:28:90:505:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:same walk of life with himself” (Whately, 1832, p. 53). Similarly, M.  Longfield 
9:223:13998:28:27:90:505:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:advances  the  argument  that  "the  wages  of  the  labourer  depend  upon  the 
9:224:14079:27:28:90:505:538:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:expense  of  his  maintenance  and  usual  style  of  his  living,  instead  of  his 
9:225:14164:28:28:90:505:510:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:expenses  and  his  mode  of  living  depending  pretty  much  upon  his  wage" 
9:226:14244:28:27:90:227:482:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(Longfield, 1834, p. 203). 
9:227:14271:27:28:126:505:455:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Nassau Senior in his Outline of the Science of Political Economy drew 
9:228:14341:28:27:90:505:427:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:attention  to  what  he  called  ‘the  desire  for  distinction’.  Having  discussed  the 
9:229:14431:27:28:90:505:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:desire for variety, and having attributed to it the diminishing utility to be gained 
9:230:14516:28:28:90:505:372:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:from   each   additional   unit   of   a   particular   commodity   consumed,   Senior 
9:231:14603:28:27:90:491:344:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:unequivocally declared it to be less powerful than the desire for distinction:  
9:232:14683:27:21:117:505:317:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:“But  strong  as  is  the  desire  for  variety,  it  is  weak  compared  with  the 
9:233:14767:21:21:117:505:296:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:desire  for  distinction:  a  feeling  which,  if  we  consider  its  universality  and 
9:234:14855:21:20:117:505:275:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:its constancy, that it affects all men and at all times, that it comes with us 
9:235:14934:20:21:117:505:255:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:from  the  cradle,  and  never  leaves  us  till  we  go  to the  grave,  may  be 
9:236:15016:21:21:117:505:234:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:pronounced  to  be  the  most  powerful  of  human  passions.  The  most 
9:237:15089:21:20:117:505:213:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:obvious  source  of  distinction  is  the  possession  of superior  wealth”

9:240:15189:14:27:90:505:158:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Senior  makes  clear  that  the  main  effect  of  the  motive  for  distinction  is  to 
9:241:15278:27:28:90:505:131:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:influence  the  rate  of  demand  and  utility  of  special  goods  of  high  exchange 
9:242:15365:28:0:90:341:103:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:value, such as diamonds (Senior, 1836, p. 13). 
10:243:15413:0:27:125:505:758:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:One  can  argue  that    Marx  had  also  conceived  the  idea  of  relative 
10:244:15490:27:28:90:504:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:income  and  consumption  and  in  general,  of  the  concept  of  positional  goods. 
10:245:15576:28:27:90:505:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Hence the quotation  ‘let a palace arise beside the little house, and it shrinks 
10:246:15657:27:28:90:505:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:from a little house to a hut’ (Marx, 1849, p. 216).  Furthermore, there are other 
10:247:15739:28:28:90:505:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:passages  where  the  idea  of  rising  immiseration  in  spite  of  the  rising  real 
10:248:15826:28:27:90:399:620:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:wages is also present (see also Hollander, 1984, p. 146).  
10:249:15885:27:28:126:504:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:J.  S.  Mill  maintains  that  once  a  basic  standard  of living  has  been 
10:250:15963:28:27:90:505:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:achieved,  the  concern  about  social  status  becomes  extremely  strong.  The 
10:251:16044:27:28:90:491:538:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f8:B:subsequent notion of positional goods  is present in the following passage:  
10:252:16120:28:21:117:505:510:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:“When once the means of living have been obtained, the far greater part

10:254:16267:20:21:117:504:469:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:object  to  acquire  the  respect  or  favourable  regard of  mankind;  to  be 
10:255:16346:21:21:117:504:448:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:looked up to, or at all events, not to be looked down upon by them.” (Mill

10:258:16435:14:28:126:505:393:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Finally,  by  the  end  of  the  19th  century,  Henry  Cunynghame  provided 
10:259:16512:28:27:90:505:365:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the    first  attempt  to  illustrate  diagrammatically  the  effect  of  incorporating 
10:260:16600:27:28:90:505:338:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:dependence of one individual’s demand for a good on that of others, is to be 
10:261:16677:28:27:90:505:310:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f9:B:found in his 1892 article entitled ‘Some Improvements in Simple Geometrical

10:263:16830:28:28:89:299:255:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:new diagram, Cunynghame observed:  
10:264:16865:28:21:116:505:227:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:“...  almost  the  whole  value  of  strawberries  in  March,  to  those  who  like 
10:265:16949:21:20:116:505:206:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:this  tasteless  mode  of  ostentation,  is  the  fact  that  others  cannot  get 
10:266:17031:20:21:116:504:186:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:them.  As  my  landlady  once  remarked,  ‘Surely,  sir,  you  would  not  like 
10:267:17111:21:21:116:504:165:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:anything  so  common  and  cheap  as  a  fresh  herring?’. The  demand  for 
10:268:17187:21:20:116:505:144:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:diamonds,  rubies,  and  sapphires  is  another  example of  this.  As  the 
10:269:17263:20:21:116:505:124:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:number  increases,  not  only  does  the  price  go  down, but  the  very 
10:270:17337:21:21:116:504:103:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:pleasure   of   those   who   already   have   them   is   decreased   by   their 
10:271:17419:21:0:116:378:82:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:becoming common.” (Cunynghame 1892, p. 37)  
11:272:17465:0:27:89:92:758:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B: 
11:273:17465:27:28:89:505:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Cunynghame’s  diagram  showed  a  consumer  surplus  curve  lying  below  the 
11:274:17543:28:27:89:505:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:commodity  demand  curve,  but  shifting  upwards  for  every  reduction  in  the 
11:275:17625:27:28:89:189:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:quantity supplied.  
11:276:17645:28:28:125:505:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Thus, as our previous discussion indicated, interpersonal comparisons 
11:277:17715:28:27:89:505:620:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and  positional  goods  were  concepts  which  were  present  in  the  economic 
11:278:17795:27:28:89:505:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:thought  of  the  18th  and  especially  19th  centuries.  It  has  to  be  noted  that  for 
11:279:17888:28:27:89:504:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:most of the authors discussed, the above ideas were not part of a systematic 
11:280:17965:27:28:89:504:538:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:theory  of  individual  economic  behaviour.  To  a  large  extent  this  was  due  to 
11:281:18052:28:28:89:505:510:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:their adherence to a cost of production theory of value. This implies that a full 
11:282:18134:28:27:89:505:482:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:theory of individual preferences was not a necessary part for the construction 
11:283:18213:27:28:89:505:455:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of economic theories. A more systematic discussion of these ideas, however, 
11:284:18289:28:27:89:505:427:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:became  apparent  with  a  shift  towards  a  more  subjective  approach  to  the 
11:285:18371:27:28:89:505:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:theory of value which took place in the last decades of the 19th century.  But 
11:286:18450:28:28:89:505:372:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:before  we  proceed  to  this  theme,    let  us  see  first the  more  systematic 
11:287:18533:28:27:89:505:344:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:discussion of  interdependent preferences in the works of  T. Veblen and A.C.

11:295:18888:28:28:90:505:165:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:These  concepts  played  such  a    fundamental    role  in his  analysis    that  they 
11:296:18976:28:27:90:505:137:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:were  conceived  as  the  foundation  of    a  private  property  society.      In  the

12:298:19150:0:27:89:505:758:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:discussion.  Namely,  he  links    consumption  and  wealth  imitation,  private 
12:299:19231:27:28:89:393:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:property and the nature and effect of positional goods:     
12:300:19291:28:20:116:505:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:“The motive that lies at the root of ownership is emulation; and the same

12:307:19854:21:20:116:505:558:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:especially not for any incentive to the accumulation of wealth. ... the end

12:322:20886:28:27:89:504:227:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:class in Veblen’s terminology. Other social classes might also engage in such 
12:323:20964:27:28:89:333:200:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:activity even the  lower classes. As he states: 
12:324:21012:28:21:116:505:172:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:“[n]o  class  of  society,  not  even  the  most  abjectly poor,  foregoes  all 
12:325:21092:21:20:116:505:151:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:customary  conspicuous  consumption.  ...  There  is  no  class  and  no

13:330:21349:13:28:89:505:745:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:It  is  clear  that  in  Veblen’s    theoretical  analysis,    the  idea  of  interpersonal 
13:331:21441:28:28:89:505:717:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:comparisons  of  income,  consumption  and  wealth  are  extremely  important 
13:332:21519:28:27:89:332:689:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:factors for economic and social relationships. 
13:333:21566:27:28:125:505:662:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A: Although  Veblen’s    ideas  as  a  whole  were  not  very influential  for  the 
13:334:21648:28:27:89:505:634:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:emerging   corpus   of   mainstream   theory,   the   notion   of   interpersonal 
13:335:21730:27:28:89:505:607:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:preferences was not uncommon among leading economists at the time. This 
13:336:21802:28:28:89:508:579:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:can  be  seen  in  the  work  of    A.C.    Pigou  whose  ideas  were  in  the  centre  of  
13:337:21894:28:27:89:505:551:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:mainstream economics of that period. Pigou  devotes considerable space on 
13:338:21968:27:28:89:505:524:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the  idea  of  interdependent  preferences  and  positional  goods.  He    is  clearly 
13:339:22055:28:27:89:504:496:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:influenced  by  Pareto’s  differentiation  between  the terms  ‘ophelimity’  and 
13:340:22136:27:28:89:424:469:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:‘utility’, which we will examine in the next section. In his words: 
13:341:22204:28:21:116:505:441:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:“The curve of the private marginal demand prices lies above the curve of

13:343:22358:20:21:116:505:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:one   consumer   diminishes   the   ophelimity   associated   with   a   given 
13:344:22437:21:21:116:505:379:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:consumption  by  other  consumers  ...  The  curve  of  the  private  marginal

13:349:22756:21:13:89:92:275:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B: 
13:350:22756:13:28:89:505:262:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:The inequality between private and collective demand prices depends on the 
13:351:22831:28:28:89:504:234:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:emergence   of   a   social   element   to   individuals’   states   of   consciousness 
13:352:22919:28:27:89:505:206:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:because some or all consumers of a particular product derive utility from their 
13:353:22999:27:28:89:505:179:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:direct consumption as well as consumption by third-parties (see also Mclure, 
13:354:23076:28:27:89:505:151:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f9:B:2009). This is closely linked to his previous analysis in his   ‘Some remarks on 
13:355:23157:27:28:89:505:124:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f7:B:utility’ (Pigou, 1903) where he  introduces the argument K{a,b} as an element 
13:356:23235:28:0:90:505:96:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:within   the   individual’s   utility   function   of   a   specific   commodity.   More

14:358:23415:28:28:89:505:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:which  the  elements a,  is the  quantity  of  A  possessed  by  the  individual’s  first 
14:359:23505:28:27:90:505:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:neighbour and b is the ‘distance’ from an individual to his/her first neighbour. If 
14:360:23589:27:28:90:505:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the  consumption  of  good  A  by  neighbours  has  no  effect  on  the  ophelimity 
14:361:23673:28:28:90:505:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f9:B:enjoyed by an individual from his/her consumption of good A, the ‘distance’ b 
14:362:23751:28:27:90:505:620:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:is zero and thus  the value of the complex expression is zero. However,  when 
14:363:23829:27:28:90:505:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the  consumption  of  good  A  by  neighbours  influences the  ophelimity  that  an 
14:364:23913:28:27:90:505:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:individual enjoys from his/her consumption of good A, the ‘distance’ in each of

14:366:24078:28:28:90:505:510:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:zero. Pigou  is clearly influenced by Cunynghame (1892), that people who like 
14:367:24156:28:27:90:505:482:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:a  tasteless  mode  of  ostentation  receive  diminished pleasure  from  some 
14:368:24234:27:28:90:505:455:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:commodities when they become more ‘common’ (for an extensive discussion,

14:375:24368:13:28:126:505:331:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:As was seen in the previous sections,  the concepts of interdependent 
14:376:24438:28:28:90:505:303:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:preferences  and  positional  goods  were  part  of  the  economic  thinking  of  a 
14:377:24522:28:27:90:504:275:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:great   number   of   theorists.   However,   the   marginalist   emphasis   on   the 
14:378:24608:27:28:90:504:248:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:subjective theory of value, required a systematic model of individual economic 
14:379:24687:28:27:90:505:220:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:decision-making.  Thus  the  issue  of  the  nature  of    preferences  had  to  be 
14:380:24771:27:28:90:505:193:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:addressed.   Vilfredo Pareto  was  the first  major  economist  who    provided  the 
14:381:24856:28:28:90:505:165:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:rational  of  the    irrelevance  of    interdependent  preferences  for  economic 
14:382:24939:28:27:90:498:137:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:analysis and thus contributed to their rejection from mainstream economics.  
14:383:25016:27:28:126:504:110:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The basis of Pareto’s approach to preferences are the distinct concepts 
14:384:25088:28:0:90:505:82:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of    ophelimity  and  utility.  For  Pareto,  the  term  utility  has  a  general  character 
15:385:25184:0:27:89:505:758:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:while  the  term  ophelimity  is  more  specialized  to  the  purposes  of  economics. 
15:386:25271:27:28:89:505:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Economic  man  is  conceived  as  a  rational  being  in  the  sense  of  means-ends 
15:387:25356:28:27:89:505:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:relationship.  This  rationality  can  be  achieved  through  trial  and  error  process. 
15:388:25446:27:28:89:504:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Economic man    responds  only  to forces ophelimity.  (Pareto  1896, p.  12).    In 
15:389:25531:28:28:89:505:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:this  framework,  preferences  are  independent.  Although  Pareto  admits    that 
15:390:25614:28:27:89:505:620:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:man’s character presents other characteristics too,  these are studied by other 
15:391:25694:27:28:89:505:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:sciences. Once an  individual’s  preferences  are  influenced  by  interaction  with 
15:392:25779:28:27:89:505:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the  actions  and  ideas  of  third-parties,  action  is  considered  with  respect  to 
15:393:25867:27:28:89:505:538:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:utility  and  not  ophelimity  (McLure,  2009).  In    a  subsequent  article,    (Pareto 
15:394:25957:28:28:89:505:510:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:1918),  is more specific on the two scientific domains, in the sense that when 
15:395:26036:28:27:89:505:482:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the  ‘economic  part’  of  the  economic  phenomena  dominates,  analysis  should 
15:396:26118:27:28:89:505:455:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:primarily be based on economic theory; and when the ‘sociological part’ of the 
15:397:26197:28:27:89:505:427:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:economic  phenomena  dominates,  analysis  should  primarily  be  based  on 
15:398:26273:27:28:89:289:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:sociology  (see also McLure, 2009).   
15:399:26311:28:28:125:505:372:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:It is evident that   Pareto’s rejection of interdependent preferences had 
15:400:26385:28:27:89:505:344:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:a  methodological  motive.  Pareto    was  extremely  influenced  by  the  prevailing 
15:401:26471:27:28:89:505:317:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:positivist   scientific   philosophy,   a   basic   characteristic   of   which,   was   the 
15:402:26564:28:27:89:505:289:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:exclusion of all “metaphysical” and “non-scientific” elements from economics. 
15:403:26642:27:28:89:505:262:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Pareto’s  methodological  ideal  of    economics  was  that  it  should  be    a 
15:404:26723:28:28:89:505:234:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:mathematical  science,  part  of  the  natural  sciences such  as  physiology  and 
15:405:26806:28:27:89:505:206:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:chemistry (Pareto, 1896, p.21). This implies that  economics should be freed 
15:406:26883:27:28:89:505:179:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:from any sociological or psychological ideas which hamper the application of 
15:407:26960:28:27:89:505:151:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the positivist  methodology  (for  an  extensive discussion,  see Seligman,  1969; 
15:408:27043:27:28:89:505:124:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Drakopoulos, 1997). Pareto’s model of rational economic man outlined above, 
15:409:27119:28:0:89:423:96:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:excludes social influences such as interpersonal preferences.  
16:410:27184:0:27:125:505:758:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Alfred    Marshall’s  influence  on  the  formation  of  modern  mainstream 
16:411:27260:27:28:89:505:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:microeconomics  is  widely  recognized.  Marshall  was  aware  of    consumption 
16:412:27341:28:27:89:505:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:for  the  purposes  of  status,    but  he  condemned  such behaviour  basically  on 
16:413:27426:27:28:89:177:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:ethical grounds:

16:415:27524:21:20:116:505:627:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:speaking generally, we may say that every increase in the wealth of the 
16:416:27596:20:21:116:505:607:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:working classes adds to the fullness and nobility of human life, because 
16:417:27669:21:21:116:505:586:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:it  is  used  chiefly  in  the  satisfaction  of  real  wants;  yet  even  among  the

16:419:27837:20:21:116:504:545:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:signs of the growth of that unwholesome desire for wealth as a means of 
16:420:27909:21:21:116:505:524:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:display which has been the chief bane of the well-to-do classes in every 
16:421:27982:21:21:116:505:503:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:civilized country. Laws against luxury have been futile; but it would be a

16:428:28440:21:27:89:505:358:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Thus,    Marshall    effectively    refused    to    consider    further    status-driven 
16:429:28530:27:28:89:505:331:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:consumption.  Furthermore,  he  was  reluctant  to  discuss  the  general  case  of 
16:430:28614:28:28:89:504:303:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:interpersonal  effects  on  demand  mainly  because  it  would  have  called  into

16:432:28773:27:28:89:504:248:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:demand  could  be  derived  from  the  simple  addition  of  individual    demand 
16:433:28855:28:27:89:504:220:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:schedules   (Mason,   1995).   Although   a   number   of   authors   such   as 
16:434:28935:27:28:89:505:193:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Cunynghame  (1892)  and  Foley  (1893)  clearly  pointed this  lack  concerning 
16:435:29015:28:27:89:505:165:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:status  driven  consumption,  Marshall  did  not  analyse  the  issue  further  in 
16:436:29098:27:28:89:419:138:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:subsequent editions of his Principles (see also Mason, 1995). 
16:437:29160:28:28:89:504:110:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B: In general, Pareto and Marshall, two extremely dominant figures for the 
16:438:29232:28:0:89:504:82:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:formation   of   mainstream   economics,   had   a   negative   attitude   towards 
17:439:29317:0:27:89:505:758:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:incorporating   interdependent   preferences   in   economic   analysis.   Pareto’s

17:441:29485:28:27:89:504:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:psychological elements in economics, and Marshall’s explicit refusal to accept 
17:442:29564:27:28:89:457:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:their role, seem to be the main reasons for the mainstream rejection.

17:446:29704:21:28:125:505:586:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:As  was  observed  in  the  previous  pages,  the  idea  of interdependent 
17:447:29779:28:27:89:505:558:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:preferences was effectively marginalized from mainstream economic analysis 
17:448:29854:27:28:89:505:531:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:although  it  had  a  constant presence  in the  history of economic thought. This 
17:449:29937:28:27:89:505:503:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:was mainly due to the influence of Pareto and Marshall concerning this issue.

17:451:30100:28:28:89:505:448:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:appeared  in  the  work  of  James  Duesenberry    in  his  main  book  published  in 
17:452:30186:28:27:89:505:420:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:1949. One can view Duesenberry’s work as a continuation of Veblen’s, given 
17:453:30261:27:28:89:505:393:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:that  there  are  many  common  points  concerning  income  and  consumption 
17:454:30338:28:27:89:508:365:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:comparisons,  and  also  of  the  demonstration  effect  (see    McCormick,  1983).  
17:455:30423:27:28:89:505:338:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:In   particular,   Duesenberry   is   known   as   the   proponent   of   the   relative 
17:456:30512:28:28:89:508:310:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:consumption  hypothesis,  the  basic  idea  of  which  was  that    ”Any  particular  
17:457:30598:28:27:89:505:282:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:consumer  will  be  influenced  by  consumption  of  people  with  whom  he  has 
17:458:30679:27:28:89:504:255:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:social  contacts”  (Duesenberry,  1949,  p.  48).  This  idea  (labeled  as  the 
17:459:30760:28:27:89:505:227:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:demonstration   effect)   questioned   the   established   mainstream   view   that 
17:460:30844:27:28:89:505:200:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:absolute  levels  of  income  only  determine  patterns  of  consumer  demand

17:462:31003:28:27:89:294:144:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:basis of such behaviour. As he writes: 
17:463:31042:27:21:116:505:117:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:“We  can  maintain  then  that  the  frequency  and  strength  of  impulses  to

17:465:31194:21:0:116:504:75:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:superior to those habitually consumed. This effect need not depend at all 
18:466:31270:0:20:116:505:758:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:on    considerations    of    emulation    or    ‘conspicuous    consumption’.”

18:470:31449:27:28:90:498:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:expenditure  could be  increased  not  by  changes  in  income or  prices,  but by 
18:471:31532:28:28:90:498:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:following  the  consumption  expenditures  of  others  with  whom  the  individual 
18:472:31615:28:27:90:498:620:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:had    contacts    (Duesenberry,    1949,    p.    29).    This    implies    important 
18:473:31703:27:28:90:498:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:consequences for a  number  of  important  issues  like   the pattern of  savings 
18:474:31785:28:27:90:498:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and  growth  as    Duesenberry  himself  intended.  In  this  framework,    savings 
18:475:31869:27:28:90:498:538:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:rates  depend    on  the  position  of  income  distribution  and  not  exclusively  on 
18:476:31957:28:28:90:373:510:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the income level, as in a traditional savings function.  
18:477:32014:28:27:125:498:482:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:However,  much  in  the  same  way  as  the  previous  approaches  on 
18:478:32084:27:28:90:498:455:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:interdependent  preferences,    Duesenberry’s  ideas    never  gained  popularity 
18:479:32166:28:27:90:501:427:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:among  mainstream  theorists.  The  reaction  of    Robert  Clower  a  few  years

18:492:32965:27:28:90:497:117:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:initially,   Modigliani   (1949)   embraced   this   idea   in his   own   research

19:494:33129:0:27:89:498:758:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:critical   later   on   arguing   that   it   contained      unnecessary         social   and 
19:495:33223:27:28:89:498:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:psychological  elements.  Instead,  they  claimed  that their  (Modigliani  and 
19:496:33303:28:27:89:498:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Brumberg)  new interpretation of consumption theory was sounder and much 
19:497:33376:27:28:89:419:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:simpler (Modigliani and Brumberg, 1954, 424; Mason, 2000).  
19:498:33436:28:28:126:505:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Thus,  interpersonal  preferences  were  once  again  excluded  from  the 
19:499:33510:28:27:90:505:620:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:mainstream  corpus  of  economic  theory.  One  basic  reason  for  this  is  that 
19:500:33593:27:28:90:505:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Duesenberry’s  analysis  poses  some  fundamental  questions  regarding  the

19:502:33759:27:28:90:508:538:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:preferences,  issues  which  were  not  popular  for  orthodox  theorists.    Thus,  it  
19:503:33848:28:28:90:505:510:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:seems that  allegedly simpler explanations of consumption patterns offered by

19:505:34009:27:28:90:508:455:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:sophisticated  approach  (see  also  Harbaugh,  1996;  Cowling,  2006).  Another  
19:506:34091:28:27:90:505:427:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:important  reason  for  the  lack  of  acceptance  of  his ideas  was  the  serious 
19:507:34175:27:28:90:505:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:problems  that  they  posed  for  the  conventional  aggregate  demand  theory 
19:508:34254:28:28:90:505:372:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:which assumes that individual consumption behaviour was independent of the 
19:509:34329:28:27:90:505:344:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:consumption   of   others.   If   preferences   are   not   independent,   aggregate 
19:510:34414:27:28:90:504:317:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:demand  cannot  be  derived  from  the  simple  summation of  individual  demand 
19:511:34495:28:27:90:283:289:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:schedules (see also Mason, 2000).

19:514:34553:42:27:126:505:192:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:For   many   years   after   its   analytical   treatment   in   the   work   of 
19:515:34634:27:28:90:505:165:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Duesenberry, the concept of interdependent preferences was again effectively

20:524:35363:28:27:89:504:620:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:also  continued  to  pay  attention  to  the  idea  (for  an  extensive  review,  see 
20:525:35449:27:28:89:505:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Drakopoulos,   forthcoming).   However,   the   vast   majority   of   mainstream 
20:526:35531:28:27:89:452:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:economists still treated individual preferences as independent.  
20:527:35595:27:28:89:505:538:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B: In the last two decades though, the research potential of interpersonal 
20:528:35667:28:28:89:505:510:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:preferences has started to be realized by an increasing number of economists 
20:529:35744:28:27:89:504:482:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:and  thus  it  has  begun  to  re-appear  in  some  economic  literature. There  is  an 
20:530:35832:27:28:89:505:455:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:increasing  use  of  ideas  such  as  reference  income,  target  income,  relative 
20:531:35916:28:27:89:505:427:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:consumption  and  positional  goods  which  are  all  based  on  the  concept  of 
20:532:35998:27:28:89:505:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:interdependent  preferences.  The  subfields  of  macro and  labour  economics 
20:533:36077:28:28:89:504:372:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:are  indicative  examples.  In  particular,  the  idea  that  unions  and  workers 
20:534:36160:28:27:89:504:344:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:compare  income  or  wages  with  others  has  been  expressed  in  a  plethora  of 
20:535:36244:27:28:89:505:317:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:terms such as relative wage, fair wage,  aspiration wage, comparison or target 
20:536:36323:28:27:89:505:289:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:wage.    [see for  instance,  Frank  (1984), Akerlof  and  Yellen  (1990), Clark  and 
20:537:36409:27:28:89:505:262:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Oswald (1996), Charness and Grosskopf (2001)]. Furthermore, in the last two 
20:538:36485:28:28:89:505:234:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:decades   the   notion   of   comparison   income   has   also   entered   the   job 
20:539:36570:28:27:89:505:206:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:satisfaction  literature  and  more  recently  the  quite  fashionable  subfield  of 
20:540:36655:27:28:89:505:179:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:happiness   research,   mainly   in   formulations   examining   the   relationship 
20:541:36739:28:27:89:505:151:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:between income and happiness level (e.g. Clark and Oswald, 1996, Frey and 
20:542:36813:27:28:89:505:124:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Stutzer, 2002; Drakopoulos, 2008). In spite of the above, the concept  with its 
20:543:36893:28:0:89:505:96:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:specific  expression  of  comparison  income  or  interdependent  utilities,  is  still 
21:544:36983:0:27:89:452:758:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:not accepted by the economics orthodoxy.      
21:545:37025:27:28:89:505:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B: One  can  argue  that  there  are  some  reasons  for  the continuous 
21:546:37095:28:27:89:504:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:mainstream  resistance  towards  interdependent  preferences.  One  of  those 
21:547:37173:27:28:89:505:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:reasons  might  have  to  do  with    their  serious    theoretical  consequences.  A 
21:548:37259:28:28:89:505:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:number   of   authors   have   shown   that   that   the   full   incorporation   of 
21:549:37344:28:27:89:505:620:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:interdependent  preferences  and  of  the  related  concept  of  the  comparison  or 
21:550:37429:27:28:89:504:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:relative income, in economic theory, would cast serious doubts on many well-
21:551:37505:28:27:89:505:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:established   and   important   theoretical   results.   Namely,   optimal   taxation, 
21:552:37592:27:28:89:504:538:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:economic   growth   and   income   distribution   theories   might   need   serious 
21:553:37676:28:28:89:504:510:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:rethinking  towards  more  progressive  taxation  and  more  emphasis  on  more 
21:554:37756:28:27:89:504:482:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:equal  income  distribution  (for  reviews,  see  Dugger,  1985;  Postlewaite,  1998; 
21:555:37842:27:28:89:505:455:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Clark, Frijters, and Shields 2008, and  for the  implications of interdependent 
21:556:37922:28:27:89:452:427:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:preferences for general equilibrium, see Ackerman, 1997).      
21:557:37984:27:28:89:505:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B: Another  reason  for  the  rejection  of  interdependent  preferences  has  to 
21:558:38063:28:28:89:505:372:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:do  with  the  orthodox  conception  that  economic  agents  are  characterized  by 
21:559:38147:28:27:89:505:344:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:selfish  preferences.  In  fact,  self-interest  was  one  of  the  cornerstones  of  the 
21:560:38237:27:28:89:505:317:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:traditional  model  of  individual  economic  behaviour (economic  man).  This  is 
21:561:38320:28:27:89:505:289:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:certainly  still  the  case  for  many  modern  standard  formulations.  As  R.  Frank 
21:562:38407:27:28:89:505:262:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:observes:  “To  many  economists,  the  notion  of  consumers  being  strongly 
21:563:38486:28:28:89:505:234:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:influenced    by    demonstration    effects    must    have    seemed    troublingly 
21:564:38572:28:27:89:504:206:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:inconsistent  with  the  reasoned  pursuit  of  self-interest,  if  not  completely 
21:565:38656:27:28:89:505:179:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:irrational”  (Frank,  1985,  p.146).  Mainstream  resistance  to  question  self-
21:566:38737:28:27:89:504:151:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:interested  behaviour  is  still  very  strong  in  spite of  abundant    research 
21:567:38820:27:28:89:504:124:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:indicating  otherwise.  The  assumption  is  so  embedded  that    as  Rabin  points 
21:568:38905:28:0:89:505:96:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:out  “A  remarkable  amount  of  energy  has  been  devoted  to  giving  self-
22:569:38985:0:27:89:505:758:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:interested explanations for laboratory behaviour that seems to be a departure 
22:570:39063:27:28:89:452:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:from self-interest” (Rabbin, 2002, p.667).      
22:571:39107:28:27:89:505:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B: Finally,  another  reason  which  is  closely  linked  to  the  above  is  that 
22:572:39187:27:28:89:505:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:mainstream economists are extremely reluctant to consider psychological and 
22:573:39263:28:28:89:504:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:sociological      aspects   of   human   behaviour   in   their   economic   analysis. 
22:574:39350:28:27:89:505:620:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Concepts   such   as   social   status,   positional   goods,   rank   concerns   and 
22:575:39436:27:28:89:504:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:consumer conformism which are all based on interdependent preferences, are 
22:576:39511:28:27:89:505:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:thought   as   not   belonging   to   the   realm   of   economics.   The   “economic” 
22:577:39598:27:28:89:505:538:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:approach  to  human  behaviour  is  seen  as  extremely  successful  and  superior 
22:578:39681:28:28:89:505:510:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:compared to other social sciences. Gary  Becker’s definition of the economic 
22:579:39758:28:27:89:504:482:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:approach   is   indicative   of   this   attitude:   “The   combined   assumptions   of 
22:580:39846:27:28:89:505:455:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:maximizing   behaviour,   market   equilibrium   and   stable   preferences,   used 
22:581:39930:28:27:89:505:427:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:relentlessly  and  unflinchingly,  form  the  heart  of  the  economic  approach  ... 
22:582:40016:27:28:89:505:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:provides a valuable unified framework for understanding all human behavior” 
22:583:40092:28:28:89:505:372:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:(Becker, 1976, p.5). Although Becker’s statement was made more than three 
22:584:40166:28:27:89:505:344:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:decades ago, most mainstream economists still adhere to it (see also Rabin, 
22:585:40242:27:42:89:127:317:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f8:B:2002).

22:588:40271:28:27:125:505:220:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:The  notion  of  interdependent  preferences  and  positional  goods  has 
22:589:40345:27:28:89:505:193:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:had a long presence in the history of economic ideas. Our discussion showed 
22:590:40421:28:28:89:505:165:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:that it was present in the works of many 18th and 19th centuries authors like A. 
22:591:40502:28:27:90:505:137:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Genovesi, D. Hume,  J. Rae,  A. Smith, K. Marx and J. S. Mill among others. It 
22:592:40581:27:28:90:505:110:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:was  also  seen  that  the  idea  played  an  important  role    in  the  works  of    T. 
22:593:40671:28:0:90:505:82:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:Veblen and A.C. Pigou. By the turn of the 20th century however, V. Pareto and 
23:594:40751:0:27:89:505:758:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:A.  Marshall  effectively  put  a  stop  to  its  further  incorporation  in  mainstream 
23:595:40840:27:28:89:509:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:economics.  The  main  reason  for  this,  was  the  gradual  establishment  of  
23:596:40921:28:27:89:505:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:methodological  ideas   which  did  not favour  the    inclusion  of  sociological  and 
23:597:41009:27:28:89:504:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:psychological  elements  in  economics.  This  was  deemed  to  be  essential  for 
23:598:41092:28:28:89:505:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the  drive  of  establishing  a  “positive”  economic  science.  After,  WWII  the 
23:599:41175:28:27:89:505:620:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:concept of  interpersonal preferences regained momentum mainly in the work 
23:600:41250:27:28:89:505:593:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of J. Duesenberry on consumption theory. However, Duesenberry’s approach 
23:601:41323:28:27:89:505:565:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:was   also   ignored   in   favour   of   allegedly   more   “simple”   and   “sound” 
23:602:41409:27:28:89:213:538:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:consumption theories.  
23:603:41432:28:28:125:504:510:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:In  the  last  two  decades,  there  seems  to  be  a  renewed  interest  in  the 
23:604:41514:28:27:89:505:482:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:notion by some labour economists and also by theorists in the relatively new 
23:605:41591:27:28:89:505:455:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:subfields  of  the  economics  of    subjective  well-being,  mainly  because  of  its 
23:606:41678:28:27:89:505:427:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:research potential towards analysing and explaining numerous contemporary 
23:607:41752:27:28:89:505:400:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:economic  issues.  Still,  however,  mainstream    economists    are  not  willing  to 
23:608:41839:28:28:89:403:372:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:accept that  agents do not have independent preferences.  
23:609:41897:28:27:125:505:344:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:A:Our  discussion  indicated  that  there  are  some  basic reasons  which 
23:610:41970:27:28:89:508:317:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:might  account  for  the  continuous  resistance  to  incorporate  interdependent  
23:611:42053:28:27:89:505:289:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:preferences in mainstream economic theory.  The traditional refusal to accept 
23:612:42131:27:28:89:505:262:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:the  role  of psychological  and  sociological  dimensions of  economic  behaviour 
23:613:42214:28:28:89:505:234:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:might  be  seen  as  an  important  reason.  This  is  connected  to  the  standard 
23:614:42298:28:27:89:505:206:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:conception  of  economic  agents  as  selfish  utility  maximizers  which  implies 
23:615:42381:27:28:89:505:179:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:independent   preferences.   Clearly,   this   is   due   to   the   methodological 
23:616:42465:28:27:89:504:151:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:foundations of mainstream economics which can be traced to the emergence 
23:617:42538:27:28:89:505:124:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:of  the  marginalist  school.  The  other  reason  was  the  serious  problems  that 
23:618:42623:28:0:89:505:96:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:interdependent  preferences  posed  for  the  conventional  aggregate  demand 
24:619:42703:0:27:89:505:758:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:theory.  Many  contemporary  mainstream  theorists,  just  like  Marshall,  have 
24:620:42784:27:28:89:504:731:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:realized  that  many  well  established  theoretical  results  might  need  serious 
24:621:42868:28:27:89:504:703:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:rethinking  if  preferences  are  not  independent.  Thus,  our  discussion  of  the 
24:622:42953:27:28:89:505:676:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:history  of  interdependent  preferences  indicates  that  the  old  methodological 
24:623:43037:28:28:89:505:648:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:mainstream   preconceptions   concerning   human   behaviour   and   “positive” 
24:624:43117:28:0:89:290:620:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f7:B:economics, are still extremely strong.
