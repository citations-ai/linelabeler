2:36:686:14:14:70:526:357:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:We  present  a  project  aiming  at  estimating  the  willingness  to  pay  for  organic  foods  through 
2:37:791:14:14:70:526:343:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:panel data and a survey. The panel data is based on weekly reporting of household purchases 
2:38:883:14:13:70:527:329:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:by  2000  Danish  households  with  information  on  their  demographic and  socio-economic 
2:39:974:13:14:70:526:316:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:characteristics.  Detailed  information  on  organic  foods  exist  from  1997.  A  questionnaire 
2:40:1072:14:14:70:526:302:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:asking  consumers  to  distinguish  and  rank  various  food  attributes  will  be  sent  out  to  all 
2:41:1175:14:14:70:527:288:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:households  in  the  sample  in  June  2002.  For  survey  purposes, organic  foods  are  defined  as 
2:42:1276:14:14:70:526:274:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:products  carrying  the  Danish  state  label  guaranteeing  public  control  and  certification  of 
2:43:1377:14:13:70:526:260:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:organic  production.  The  food  product  attributes  include  environmental  concerns,  animal 
2:44:1473:13:14:70:526:247:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:welfare,  and  food  safety  (health  concerns).  Here we  present  the  results  from  the  pilot  study 
2:45:1579:14:14:70:526:233:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sent  out  in  2001  to  400  randomly  chosen  households,  representatively  distributed  on 
2:46:1674:14:14:70:526:219:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:geographical  regions  however.  Among the results we note that the order of valued  attributes 
2:47:1770:14:14:70:527:205:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:do  not  differ  across  organic  product types  and  that  avoidance  of  chemicals  is  the  highest 
2:48:1872:14:13:70:526:191:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:valued  attribute.  We  also  present  some  preliminary  estimations  on  purchase  data  in  order  to 
2:49:1977:13:14:70:526:178:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:compare  the  contingent  valuation  results  with  observed  willingness  to  pay.  Both  valuation 
2:50:2078:14:0:70:464:164:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:methods entail uncertainty, and a comparison may indicate the magnitude of this. 
3:51:2159:0:20:70:151:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1. Introduction 
3:52:2174:20:21:106:517:739:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Demand for organic foods has increased considerably during the past decade, though 
3:53:2257:21:21:70:507:718:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:organic consumption still only constitutes a few percent of total food consumption in most 
3:54:2348:21:20:70:513:697:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:countries. This growth has been especially high in Denmark, which is estimated to have the 
3:55:2439:20:21:70:516:677:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:highest per capita consumption in the world (Wier and Calverley, 2002). The Danish market 
3:56:2529:21:21:70:519:656:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:is especially well suited for consumer analyses, because the Danish market for organic foods 
3:57:2622:21:20:70:512:635:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:is relatively mature, meaning that it does not suffer seriously from the supply shortages and 
3:58:2716:20:21:70:497:615:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:barriers which dominate most of the markets outside Denmark. This holds especially for 
3:59:2803:21:21:70:526:594:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:organic dairy and cereal products, since these products exhibit higher budget shares than other 
3:60:2899:21:20:70:526:573:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:organic products, and to a lower extent for meat products. This means, that the Danish organic 
3:61:2994:20:21:70:511:553:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:market may offer information about future markets of organic foods in other countries. The 
3:62:3085:21:21:70:496:532:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:well-functioning Danish market makes it possible to collect and analyse reliable data on 
3:63:3174:21:21:70:509:511:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:purchases. As such data is not found in any country until recently, almost no studies on the 
3:64:3267:21:20:70:508:490:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:estimation of the demand for organic foods based on actual purchases have been published 
3:65:3356:20:21:70:516:470:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:previously. The few exceptions are Brombacher (1992), Glaser and Thompson (1998, 2000) 
3:66:3443:21:21:70:486:449:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and Jörgensen (2001), who all use sales data from Marketing Research Institutes from 
3:67:3528:21:20:70:509:428:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Germany, USA and Sweden, respectively. Our study distinguishes itself by being based on 
3:68:3616:20:21:70:519:408:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:observations of stated as well as actual purchasing behaviour of a large number of organic as 
3:69:3710:21:21:70:517:387:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:well as conventional foods. Almost all previous studies on organic foods are based solely on 
3:70:3803:21:20:70:503:366:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:postulated behavior, i.e. stated willingness to pay. Several studies (Beharrell and MacFie, 
3:71:3895:20:21:70:512:346:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1991; Bjerke, 1992; Bugge and Wandel, 1995; CMA, 1996; Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte, 
3:72:3980:21:21:70:492:325:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1992; Drake and Holm, 1989; Fricke, 1996; Grunert and Kristensen, 1995; Jolly, 1991; 
3:73:4065:21:21:70:503:304:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Krämer et al., 1998; Misra et al., 1991; Scan-Ad, 1998) report consumer interviews about 
3:74:4154:21:20:70:516:283:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:their willingness to pay for organic foods, and thus hold information on this issue. However, 
3:75:4248:20:21:70:520:263:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:stated willingness to pay may not reflect revealed behaviour (Cook 1991; Kramer 1990). The 
3:76:4339:21:21:70:506:242:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:literature on contingent valuation (CV) has studied the issue of strategic bias in depth. For 
3:77:4432:21:20:70:517:221:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:quasi-public goods, Carson et al. (1996) undertook a large meta-study of 616 estimates from 
3:78:4524:20:21:70:517:201:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:83 studies where CV estimates were compared to revealed preference estimates for the same 
3:79:4614:21:21:70:491:180:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:good. Based on the sample of 616 comparisons, the mean CV/RP ratio was 0.89. Other 
3:80:4697:21:20:70:524:159:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:studies typically find that hypothetical (stated) willingness to pay exceed revealed willingness 
3:81:4794:20:21:70:491:139:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to pay (Cummings et al., 1995; Frykblom, 1997). In our particular context, Hansen and 
3:82:4880:21:21:70:524:118:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Sorensen (1993) conducted both (in-store) interviews and (in-store) experiments on purchases 
3:83:4973:21:0:70:523:97:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of organic products. When comparing results from these two different approaches, they found 
4:84:5066:0:21:70:508:760:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:that elicited willingness-to-pay has a tendency to be overestimated in comparison to “real” 
4:85:5158:21:21:70:254:739:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:willingness-to-pay from experiments.

4:90:5354:21:20:70:500:635:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(four-weekly observations) of 3 aggregated organic products between April 1st, 1997 and 
4:91:5442:20:21:70:510:615:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:December, 31st, 2000. The budget share is defined as the ratio of budget of organic on total 
4:92:5535:21:21:70:513:594:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:foods, and average price premiums are calculated as the mean of individual price premiums 
4:93:5625:21:19:70:391:573:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:within the group, using individual good budget shares as weights.

6:122:6183:21:21:70:526:739:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Dairy products hold the highest budget share, followed by cereal products. The Danish market 
6:123:6276:21:21:70:493:718:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:for organic foods has been growing until recently. There is a steady upward trend in the 
6:124:6365:21:20:70:505:697:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:budget shares for dairy products and cereal products (bread, flour, cereals, pasta, rice, etc) 
6:125:6460:20:21:70:488:677:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:until late 1999. From the middle of 1999 and onwards, budget shares were  decreasing 
6:126:6545:21:21:70:512:656:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:somewhat for these two food groups. Analogously, average price premiums have decreased 
6:127:6632:21:20:70:482:635:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:continuously for dairy products and cereals until the middle of 1999. From mid-1999 
6:128:6716:20:21:70:438:615:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:onwards, no clear trend in development of price premiums can be observed. 
6:129:6789:21:21:136:499:594:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:The group of ‘other foods’ (including meat, fruit and vegetables) has much 
6:130:6864:21:20:70:514:573:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:lower budget shares and much higher price premiums than the dairy and cereal products do, 
6:131:6954:20:21:70:246:553:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and no clear trend can be observed.  
6:132:6990:21:21:136:505:532:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Within the aggregated food groups, a large variation in budget shares can be 
6:133:7066:21:21:70:507:511:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:observed. Table 1 shows various estimates for the 5 most established products within each 
6:134:7156:21:20:70:515:490:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:food group for the period of April 1st 1997- December 31st 2000. For each product, the table 
6:135:7246:20:21:70:512:470:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:shows the average budget share and the average percentage organic price premium (and the 
6:136:7335:21:21:70:525:449:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:corresponding standard deviations), the average organic consumption in EURO per family per 
6:137:7426:21:20:70:524:428:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:week, and the average annual growth in this weekly consumption. Milk and eggs hold equally 
6:138:7516:20:21:70:515:408:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:high budget shares at 23 per cent, followed by carrots, rye bread and pasta. The lowest price 
6:139:7610:21:21:70:510:387:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:premiums are observed for cereals, various dairy products, rye bread and eggs. The highest 
6:140:7701:21:20:70:522:366:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:price premiums are observed within the group of other foods, for oil, carrots and onions. This 
6:141:7796:20:21:70:517:346:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:group also encompasses meat products (not shown in Table 1, as no meat products reach top 
6:142:7886:21:21:70:512:325:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:5), where lamb holds the highest budget share (budget share 5.8 per cent, price premium 22 
6:143:7977:21:21:70:508:304:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:per cent), followed by minced beef (budget share 2.2 per cent, price premium 58 per cent). 
6:144:8066:21:20:136:515:283:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:During the whole period, the highest growth is experienced for products in the 
6:145:8145:20:21:70:504:263:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:bread and cereal group, as many of these products have been introduced during the period 
6:146:8234:21:21:70:520:242:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1997-2000. Consumption of organic oil, cream, cheese and potatoes have actually decreased. 
6:147:8325:21:20:70:525:221:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:Carrots and onions, which have been supplied since the 1980’s, have experienced  low growth 
6:148:8417:20:21:70:527:201:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rates too. Looking at annual growth rates (not shown in Table), a general pattern of decreasing 
6:149:8513:21:21:70:516:180:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:growth rates can be observed for almost all food types. Until 1998, the organic consumption 
6:150:8604:21:20:70:514:159:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:was still booming, but negative growth rates are observed from 1999 and onwards for many 
6:151:8693:20:21:70:118:139:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:products. 
6:152:8702:21:21:70:519:118:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: A large variation (see standard deviations in the table) in average price premiums can 
6:153:8789:21:21:70:486:97:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:be observed, due to variations in product types and qualities within the product group, 
6:154:8877:21:0:70:526:76:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:variations due to differences in sales channels and geographical location, and variations due to 
7:155:8975:0:21:70:502:760:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:differences in observation time. The lowest variation is observed for the dairy group. The 
7:156:9066:21:21:70:485:739:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:highest variation is observed in the group of other foods, where there are large quality 
7:157:9155:21:19:70:500:718:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:differences – for example due to seasonal variation in the quality of carrots and potatoes.

8:189:10235:21:21:70:256:739:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2.2. Is the Danish market different? 
8:190:10271:21:21:106:524:718:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:There are substantial differences between the European countries in their consumption 
8:191:10357:21:20:70:504:697:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of organic foods (Wier and Calverley, 2002; Michelsen et al., 1999) and these differences 
8:192:10447:20:21:70:492:677:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:cannot be explained solely by differences in consumer preferences. Wier and Calverley 
8:193:10533:21:21:70:503:656:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(2002) argue that differences across countries are not only due to differences in consumer 
8:194:10624:21:20:70:506:635:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:demand for organic foods, but also to market barriers, which prevent the potential demand 
8:195:10713:20:21:70:145:615:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:being fulfilled. 
8:196:10729:21:21:106:492:594:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Most studies show that consumers primarily buy organic food because of health 
8:197:10807:21:20:70:514:573:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:considerations (CMA, 1996; von Alvensleben, 1998; Meier-Ploeger et al., 1996; Sylvander, 
8:198:10896:20:21:70:520:553:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1995; Infood, 1997, 1998; Land, 1998; Scan-Ad, 1998; Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte, 1992; 
8:199:10985:21:21:70:501:532:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Byrne et al, 1994; Huang, 1996; Huang et al., 1990; Jolly, 1991). German consumers, for 
8:200:11073:21:21:70:493:511:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:example, are very concerned about health and food safety (Kafka and von Alvensleben, 
8:201:11158:21:20:70:496:490:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1998). Brunsoe (1996) and Brunsoe and Bredahl (1997) compare consumer segments in 
8:202:11240:20:21:70:519:470:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:various European countries, and show that German consumers are more interested in organic 
8:203:11330:21:21:70:463:449:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:food than Danish consumers. But the market share of organic food in Germany is 
8:204:11409:21:20:70:526:428:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f9:considerably below the market share in Denmark where, in spite of having the world’s highest 
8:205:11502:20:21:70:514:408:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:consumption of organic food per capita, consumers are not very concerned about health and 
8:206:11592:21:21:70:308:387:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:food safety (Kafka and von Alvensleben, 1998).  
8:207:11639:21:20:106:506:366:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In Denmark, consumption of organic foods was low until 1993, the general market 
8:208:11719:20:21:70:492:346:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:share of organic foods being less than 1 - 2 per cent. Until 1993, the main driving force 
8:209:11808:21:21:70:504:325:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:behind the expansion of the organic foods market was government subsidies and advisory 
8:210:11895:21:21:70:494:304:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:services to organic farmers during the conversion period (Hamm and Michelsen, 1996). 
8:211:11979:21:20:70:513:283:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:However, consumption began to increase in 1993, when supermarkets lowered the prices of 
8:212:12067:20:21:70:514:263:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:organic products by 15 to 20 per cent, increased supply considerably, and initiated intensive 
8:213:12161:21:21:70:371:242:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:marketing of organic products (Hamm and Michelsen, 1996).  
8:214:12219:21:20:106:510:221:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The current Danish market fulfills three important conditions for a well-functioning 
8:215:12304:20:21:70:463:201:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:market. First, in Denmark, organic foods are primarily sold through conventional 
8:216:12385:21:21:70:517:180:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:supermarkets, ensuring stable supplies and promotion of organic products where most of the 
8:217:12476:21:20:70:495:159:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:consumers do their shopping already. Second, Denmark has a very well functioning and 
8:218:12561:20:21:70:526:139:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:trustworthy labeling and certification program. Third, price premiums for organic products are 
8:219:12656:21:21:70:522:118:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in most cases relatively low. In most other countries, at least one of these barriers is prevalent 
8:220:12755:21:0:70:194:97:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(Michelsen et al., 1999).  
9:221:12782:0:20:70:73:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
9:222:12782:20:21:70:226:739:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Distribution and sales channels 
9:223:12813:21:21:70:513:718:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Several studies (Vogtmann, 1988; Haest, 1990; Sylvander, 1995; Bugge and Wandel, 1995; 
9:224:12900:21:20:70:521:697:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:CMA, 1996; von Alvensleben and Altmann, 1986; Krämer et al., 1998; Menghi, 1997; Hack, 
9:225:12987:20:21:70:519:677:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1995) note that one of the most substantial barriers to the penetration of organic goods is that 
9:226:13084:21:21:70:507:656:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:it is difficult for consumers to locate and identify the organic commodities, and that only a 
9:227:13178:21:20:70:486:635:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:few organic products are offered regularly in supermarkets. A considerable part of the 
9:228:13265:20:21:70:426:615:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:European markets for organic products suffers from insufficient supplies. 
9:229:13338:21:21:106:506:594:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:However, the distribution of organic products in the EU is, to an increasing extent, 
9:230:13423:21:20:70:521:573:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:being taken over by conventional supply channels (Produce Studies, 1998). This is especially 
9:231:13516:20:21:70:510:553:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:true for Sweden, Denmark and the UK, where relatively few conventional retail chains and 
9:232:13605:21:21:70:522:532:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:organic food distributors dominate the market. 85 percent of all organic goods in Sweden and 
9:233:13698:21:21:70:517:511:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Denmark are distributed through conventional sales channels and 75 per cent in the UK, and 
9:234:13789:21:20:70:445:490:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the majority (85-95 per cent) of these sales pass through supermarket chains.  
9:235:13866:20:21:106:481:470:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In contrast, the Netherlands and Germany for example, are characterized by a 
9:236:13943:21:21:70:511:449:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:completely different sales structure (Produce Studies, 1998). In these countries, health food 
9:237:14037:21:20:70:526:428:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:stores and direct sales have dominated the distribution of organic products for many years and 
9:238:14132:20:21:70:515:408:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:are still powerful, even though their growth is stagnating compared to the growth of organic 
9:239:14225:21:21:70:226:387:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:products in supermarket chains. 
9:240:14256:21:21:106:109:366:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
9:241:14256:21:20:70:119:345:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Labelling 
9:242:14265:20:21:70:487:325:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Since it is impossible for consumers to check the authenticity of organic products, it is 
9:243:14355:21:21:70:518:304:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:necessary to build up a control system with clearly defined rules for production methods and 
9:244:14448:21:20:70:505:283:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:labelling of certified products (McCluskey, 2000). Previous consumer studies suggest that 
9:245:14538:20:21:70:523:263:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:trustworthy labels guaranteeing organic production are very important for the consumers. The 
9:246:14631:21:21:70:501:242:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:results indicate that clear and unmistakable labelling is an important condition for buying 
9:247:14723:21:20:70:519:221:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:organic foods (Trijp et al., 1997; Hack, 1995; Sylvander, 1995). In many countries, however, 
9:248:14816:20:21:70:512:201:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:there are many competing labels. This has been a problem in Germany, for example, where 
9:249:14904:21:21:70:514:180:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:consumers have had great difficulty identifying the authenticity of organic products (Hamm 
9:250:14995:21:20:70:344:159:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and Michelsen, 1996; Krämer et al., 1998; CMA, 1996). 
9:251:15048:20:21:106:518:139:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The Danish certification label, which is controlled by the Danish state, is well known 
9:252:15135:21:21:70:495:118:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:by a majority of all consumers, and consumers in Denmark have great confidence in the 
9:253:15221:21:21:70:510:97:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Danish control system (Infood, 1998; Scan-Ad, 1998; Bjerke, 1992). Preliminary results of 
9:254:15311:21:0:70:509:76:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:our own suggest that in 2000, 96 per cent of Danish consumers recognize the Danish label, 
10:255:15402:0:21:70:487:760:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and 64 per cent state that they, in general, trust the label. A large majority have a good 
10:256:15493:21:21:70:484:739:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:understanding of the rules of organic production; 96 per cent know that application of 
10:257:15580:21:21:70:498:718:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:synthetic pesticides is not allowed in organic production, 90 per cent know that fertiliser 
10:258:15671:21:20:70:486:697:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:application is not allowed, and 71 per cent know that organic production encompasses 
10:259:15756:20:21:70:524:677:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:requirements for animal welfare. In general, however, consumers believe that the standards of 
10:260:15850:21:21:70:487:656:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the Danish label is more comprehensive than it actually is: 20 per cent believe organic 
10:261:15938:21:20:70:517:635:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:production has a requirement of energy conservation, and 35 per cent believe that packaging 
10:262:16030:20:21:70:316:615:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of organic products must be environment-friendly.

10:264:16079:21:20:70:150:573:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Price premiums 
10:265:16093:20:21:70:507:553:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:High price premiums for organic goods limit demand. Results from Glaser and Thompson 
10:266:16178:21:21:70:511:532:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(1998, 2000) and Wier, Hansen and Smed (2001) indicate high price sensitivity in demand. 
10:267:16267:21:21:70:511:511:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:These studies modelled substitution between various (organic and non-organic) food types, 
10:268:16357:21:20:70:507:490:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:using the AIDS system on actual purchase data. In these studies, a similar pattern appears: 
10:269:16449:20:21:70:497:470:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Demand for organic products are much more price-elastic than demand for conventional 
10:270:16534:21:21:70:515:449:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:products. In contrast to these results, however, Jörgensen (2001), who estimated demand for 
10:271:16626:21:20:70:506:428:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:various cereal products and coffee using an “ad-hoc” specification and Swedish GfK data, 
10:272:16715:20:21:70:421:408:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:found comparatively low price elasticities for certified organic products. 
10:273:16789:21:21:136:516:387:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:In addition, several studies evaluate consumers’ willingness to pay, most often 
10:274:16869:21:20:70:526:366:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:based on interviews. For a review, see Thompson (1998) or Wier and Calverley (2002). Based 
10:275:16960:20:21:70:502:346:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:on consumers' own statements, Fricke and von Alvensleben (1997), Krämer et al. (1998), 
10:276:17047:21:21:70:515:325:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Meier-Ploeger et al. (1996), Haest (1990), Hack (1995), and Jolly (1991) point to high price 
10:277:17140:21:21:70:460:304:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:premiums to be one of the most important reasons for not buying organic foods.  
10:278:17219:21:20:136:507:283:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:In Denmark, price premiums are in general low, compared to other countries 
10:279:17294:20:21:70:514:263:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(Michelsen et al., 1999). Results from Michelsen et al. (1999) suggest that the average price 
10:280:17388:21:21:70:492:242:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:premium is reduced by increasing volumes and increasing sales through supermarkets.

10:282:17472:20:21:70:188:201:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2.3. Danish consumers 
10:283:17493:21:21:88:525:180:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The elaboration of results from the test sample indicate the following characteristics of the 
10:284:17587:21:21:70:165:159:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Danish consumers: 
10:285:17604:21:21:88:514:138:12:g_d0_f14:12:Times New Roman: Salmonella, pesticide and medicine residues are top food safety concern for foods in 
10:286:17690:21:22:106:399:117:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:general. Cholesterol and mad-cow-disease are ranked lower. 
10:287:17748:22:20:88:516:95:12:g_d0_f14:12:Times New Roman: Avoidance of chemicals is a top concern and top valued product attribute for organic 
10:288:17834:20:0:106:142:75:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:foods.  
11:289:17843:0:22:88:463:759:12:g_d0_f14:12:Times New Roman: The order of valued attributes does not vary across organic product types. 
11:290:17918:22:21:88:510:737:12:g_d0_f14:12:Times New Roman: Stated main barriers for not purchasing organic foods are too high price premiums,  
11:291:18003:21:21:106:334:716:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:poorer appearance, and lack of trust in control. 
11:292:18051:21:22:88:439:695:12:g_d0_f14:12:Times New Roman: 64 per cent of consumers lack confidence in imported organic foods. 
11:293:18119:22:20:88:517:673:12:g_d0_f14:12:Times New Roman: 25 per cent of consumers state that large supply of organic foods is a main reason for 
11:294:18207:20:22:106:170:653:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:store choice. 
11:295:18220:22:21:88:526:631:12:g_d0_f14:12:Times New Roman: 66 per cent state that even if organic standards were totally obeyed, organic agriculture 
11:296:18311:21:20:106:519:610:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:would make no difference to the environment. 57% state it would make no difference 
11:297:18394:20:21:106:314:590:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to the health for consumers eating organic. 
11:298:18437:21:21:88:511:569:10:g_d0_f14:12:Times New Roman: 35% of the consumers that are willing to pay more for all types of organic products  
11:299:18523:21:20:106:505:548:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:have been members of an organization that protects nature. In comparison, 18% of 
11:300:18604:20:21:106:523:528:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:consumers, not willing to pay more for any organic product, have been members of an 
11:301:18688:21:21:106:267:507:12:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:organization that protects nature. 
11:302:18722:21:14:70:73:486:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:

11:305:18722:14:21:70:133:445:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:3. The Data 
11:306:18733:21:21:106:485:424:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The data used in our study is provided by a marketing research company, GfK 
11:307:18809:21:20:70:526:403:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Denmark, part of the GfK Group (www.gfk.com). GfK Denmark registers the consumption of 
11:308:18896:20:21:70:482:383:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:approximately 2300 households of (certified) organic and conventional foods and the 
11:309:18980:21:21:70:519:362:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:corresponding prices (www.gfk.dk). 20% of the households are exchanged every year, partly 
11:310:19070:21:20:70:493:341:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:because of households leaving the survey, and partly in order to ensure that the panel is 
11:311:19160:20:21:70:488:321:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:representative of the Danish population. The panel is representative with respect to the 
11:312:19249:21:21:70:524:300:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:location and size of the household, as well as age of the consumer. The consumers respond by 
11:313:19342:21:21:70:492:279:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:recording their weekly purchases in a diary. This record encompasses a large variety of 
11:314:19430:21:20:70:502:258:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:commodities,  representing 80% of the consumer’s budget for grocery shopping. Data for 
11:315:19517:20:21:70:507:238:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:organic foods exist for the period from the beginning of 1997 and onwards. For this paper, 
11:316:19608:21:21:70:275:217:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:data were available until the end of 2000.  
11:317:19651:21:20:70:501:196:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: In addition to these data, we will mail the panel a questionnaire (in June 2002), in 
11:318:19736:20:21:70:496:176:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:order to reveal information on attitudes, values and food habits, with special attention to 
11:319:19828:21:21:70:496:155:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:valued food attributes and perceived food safety risks. We also ask the panel member of 
11:320:19915:21:20:70:511:134:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:stated willingness to pay making it possible to compare stated (revealed from questionnaire 
11:321:20007:20:21:70:517:114:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:data) and actual (revealed from purchase data) willingness to pay for the same individuals in 
11:322:20101:21:0:70:120:93:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the panel. 
12:323:20113:0:21:70:514:760:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: For the present paper, the questionnaire data is not available yet. Instead, we use pre-
12:324:20201:21:21:70:501:739:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:test data from a sample of 400 randomly chosen respondents, representatively distributed 
12:325:20290:21:21:70:210:718:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:across geographical regions. 
12:326:20318:21:14:70:73:697:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman: 
12:327:20318:14:13:70:295:683:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:4. Preliminary Results from the Pilot Study 
12:328:20361:13:21:106:527:670:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  pilot  study  was  mailed  to  400  randomly  chosen  households  and  had  a  response 
12:329:20454:21:21:70:526:649:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:rate  of  31  per  cent.  The  characteristics  of  the sample  are  shown  in  Table  2.  In  an  attempt  to 
12:330:20565:21:20:70:526:628:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:maximise the response rate, we did not ask for the respondents' income, because this question 
12:331:20659:20:21:70:526:608:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:may  make  some  respondents  feel  uncomfortable  (the  answers  would  also  be  more  uncertain 
12:332:20758:21:21:70:526:587:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:than  answers  to  questions  on  e.g.  the  number  of  persons  in  the  household).  Data  on  income 
12:333:20863:21:20:70:526:566:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:will  of  course  be  available  for  the  final  sample,  where  this  information  is  part  of  the 
12:334:20966:20:21:70:527:546:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:household characteristics in the GfK panel data. Instead, given the available data, we choose 
12:335:21059:21:21:70:526:525:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to focus the analysis on the interaction between attitudes towards the environment, health and 
12:336:21154:21:20:70:118:504:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:nutrition. 
12:337:21164:20:21:106:527:484:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The questionnaire consisted of four sets of questions (see Wier and Mørch Andersen, 
12:338:21248:21:21:70:526:463:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2001):  questions  on  purchase  habits  and  food  culture  (choice  of  store,  important  product 
12:339:21349:21:21:70:526:442:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:characteristics,  statements  on  risks  from  eating  certain  foods),  questions  on  organic  food 
12:340:21451:21:20:70:527:421:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:production  (identification  of  the  Danish  O-label,  statements  on  organic  production  and  its 
12:341:21553:20:21:70:526:401:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:effects),  questions  on  habits  and  environmental  attitudes  (use  of  recycled  toilet  paper, 
12:342:21653:21:21:70:526:380:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:aluminium foil, membership of environmental associations, statements on the consumer's role 
12:343:21745:21:20:70:527:359:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in  environmental  protection),  and  finally  questions  on  willingness  to  pay  for  four  different 
12:344:21850:20:21:70:526:339:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:products (milk, ryebread, potatoes and minced beef). The respondent had to indicate whether 
12:345:21942:21:21:70:526:318:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(s)he  agreed  with  the  attitudinal  questions  on  a  scale  from  1  to  5.  The  wtp  questions  were 
12:346:22049:21:21:70:145:297:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:formulated as:  
12:347:22064:21:20:113:520:276:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:1) Conventional milk costs 6 DKK per litre. Would you pay more than 6 DKK for a 
12:348:22143:20:21:273:381:256:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:litre of organic milk?  
12:349:22166:21:21:262:371:235:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2a) If yes, how much? 
12:350:22187:21:20:161:472:214:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:2b) If no, why are you not willing to pay more for organic milk? 
12:351:22251:20:21:106:527:194:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  respondents  who  stated  a  positive  willingness  to  pay  were  asked  a  follow-up 
12:352:22343:21:21:70:527:173:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:question  asking  them  to  rate  whether  different  characteristics  of  the  organic  product  were 
12:353:22446:21:20:70:526:152:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:more or less important in their decision to pay more for the organic product (taste, absence of 
12:354:22542:20:21:70:367:132:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:pesticide residue, environmental concerns, good conscience).

13:357:22638:0:21:106:527:760:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The  proportion  of  female  respondents  is  61%  and  the  age  distribution  is  somewhat 
13:358:22731:21:21:70:526:739:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:biased towards individuals in their 20s and 30s. Average household size is 2.6 with the largest 
13:359:22827:21:21:70:527:718:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:part (42%) consisting of 2-person households without children. Households without children 
13:360:22918:21:20:70:526:697:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:represent almost 80 % of the sample while 10% of the sample have 1 child and 10% have two 
13:361:23008:20:21:70:526:677:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:children. 33% of respondents come from the metropolitan area of Copenhagen. Compared to 
13:362:23096:21:21:70:527:656:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the Gfk sample on purchase data (figures in parentheses in Table 2), the pilot survey sample 
13:363:23189:21:20:70:354:635:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:over-represents the proportion of males and young people.

13:409:23830:20:21:106:527:285:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Table  3  shows  that  a  large  part  of  the  pilot  sample  are  willing  to  pay  more  than  the 
13:410:23932:21:21:70:526:264:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:stated conventional market price for milk (59%), potatoes (48%), rye bread (51%) and minced 
13:411:24024:21:21:70:527:243:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:beef (41%). Average willingness to pay is 1.07 euro for a litre of milk, 1.89 euro for a kilo of 
13:412:24121:21:20:70:526:222:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:potatoes,  2.48  euro  for  a  kilo  of  rye  bread,  and  5.58  euro  for  500  g  of  minced  beef.  The 
13:413:24228:20:21:70:526:202:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:corresponding price premiums are 32.1% for milk, 40.2% for potatoes, 23% for rye bread and 
13:414:24319:21:21:70:527:181:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:18.5% for minced beef. Note that these estimates result from the use of open-ended questions

14:480:25201:20:21:106:527:403:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:As part  of the  analysis of the pilot study, we performed  logistic  maximum likelihood 
14:481:25290:21:21:70:526:382:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:estimates  on  the  probability  of  being  a  BUYER,  defined  as  willing  to  pay  more  for  all  four 
14:482:25397:21:20:70:527:361:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:organic products in the survey. 32% of the pilot sample were indeed willing to pay more for 
14:483:25489:20:21:70:526:341:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:all four organic products. We used the attitudinal information in the questionnaire to construct 
14:484:25586:21:21:70:526:320:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:indicator  variables  for  environmental  behaviour  and  awareness  (the  answers  to  questions  on 
14:485:25688:21:21:70:527:299:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:membership in environmental organisation and use of non-bleached coffee/tea filters), health

14:487:25879:20:21:70:526:258:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sensibility,   and   the   attitude   towards   the   statement   that   environmental   problems   are 
14:488:25983:21:21:70:527:237:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exaggerated.  We  also  constructed  an  indicator  variable  based  on  attitudes  towards  three 
14:489:26082:21:20:70:405:216:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:statements on the impact of consumer behaviour on the environment. 
14:490:26148:20:21:106:527:196:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:The estimated model seems to generate good predictions of buyer behaviour, with the 
14:491:26232:21:21:70:527:175:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:model correctly predicting buyer rate for 78% of the sample. As can be seen from Table 4, the 
14:492:26325:21:21:70:526:154:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:probability  of  being  willing  to  pay  for  the  organic  products  decrease  with  age.  Among  the 
14:493:26429:21:20:70:526:133:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:significant  variables,  price  consciousness  and  the  belief  that  environmental  problems  are 
14:494:26529:20:0:70:527:113:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:exaggerated  decrease  the  probability  of  being  willing  to  pay  for  the  four  products  by  about 
15:495:26637:0:21:70:526:760:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:100%. Based on this limited sample, we did not find any significant impact of the presence of 
15:496:26731:21:21:70:481:739:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:children, or the indicator variables on health, nutrition and environmental awareness.

15:527:28240:28:7:70:217:257:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:                                                           
15:528:28298:7:16:70:472:250:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:1 Average price premiums at the product level may be calculated in 3 ways, depending on purpose:  
15:529:28394:16:12:70:519:234:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:(A) prices for the same (corresponding conventional) product, purchased by the same household, in any store at 
15:530:28505:12:11:70:388:222:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:any time, using all prices, including prices for products sold as special offers.   
15:531:28588:11:12:70:522:211:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:(B) prices for the same (corresponding conventional) product, purchased in the same week, in the same store, by 
15:532:28700:12:11:70:406:199:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:any household, using all prices, including prices for products sold as special offers. 
15:533:28786:11:12:70:356:188:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:(C) as (A), but not including prices for products sold as special offers.  
15:534:28860:12:11:70:496:176:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:In Table 1, we have followed approach (A), as we wanted to reveal the average price premium for a given 
15:535:28964:11:12:70:506:165:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:organic product that each household is facing, when considering all stores supplying the product. This holds 
15:536:29073:12:11:70:450:153:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:information on the average price premium taking the whole range of stores into consideration. 
15:537:29166:11:12:70:491:142:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:In Table 5, we have followed approach (C), as we wanted to reveal the willingness to pay (average price 
15:538:29269:12:11:70:515:130:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:premium) for a given organic product, at a given point in time, in a given store. This is the price premium each 
15:539:29382:11:12:70:516:119:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:household is facing when store choice has been done, corresponding to the scenario in the contingent valuation 
15:540:29493:12:11:70:506:107:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:questions in the questionnaire. This way we hope to control for unobservable differences in size, quality and 
15:541:29602:11:12:70:516:96:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:variety in store supply across stores. Furthermore, prices for products bought as special offers are not included, 
15:542:29717:12:11:70:493:84:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:as organic products on special offer may in fact be cheaper than the corresponding conventional product. 
15:543:29821:11:0:70:453:73:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:Please also note that in Table 1, the prices are from a much longer period compared to Table 5. 
16:544:29918:0:21:70:526:760:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:be  explained  by  limited  supply  of  potatoes,  as  organic  potatoes  are  mostly  available  in  the 
16:545:30024:21:21:70:526:739:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:large supermarket chains, and they are supplied in fewer qualities. Finally, only 6 per cent are 
16:546:30121:21:21:70:527:718:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:actually paying more for organic minced beef. This low share may partly be explained by the 
16:547:30213:21:20:70:527:697:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:fact that organic minced beef is not regularly supplied, especially not in low-fat versions, and 
16:548:30310:20:21:70:340:677:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:partly because of the relative high price of the product.  
16:549:30368:21:21:106:527:656:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A  comparison  with  stated  willingness  to  pay  from  Table  3  shows  that  the  consumers 
16:550:30463:21:20:70:527:635:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:are  on  average  actually  paying  less  for  organic  milk  than  they  state  they  are  willing  to  pay. 
16:551:30573:20:21:70:526:615:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:For  the  other  products,  the  opposite  holds:  In  the  cases  of  organic  potatoes,  rye  bread  and 
16:552:30680:21:21:70:527:594:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:minced beef, consumers are actually paying more than they state they are willing to pay - for 
16:553:30773:21:20:70:368:573:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:potatoes, consumers are only paying slightly more, however.  
16:554:30833:20:21:106:527:553:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A priori, we would expect two effects, each working in opposite directions, to prevail: 
16:555:30921:21:21:70:527:532:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(1) Stated willingness to pay is often presumed to be overestimated (see discussion previously 
16:556:31016:21:21:70:526:511:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:in this paper) compared to real willingness to pay. This effect seems to dominate in the case 
16:557:31110:21:20:70:114:490:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:of milk.  
16:558:31119:20:21:70:526:470:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(2) In the case of the other products, another effect wins through:  This effect is due to the fact 
16:559:31219:21:21:70:527:449:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:that,  except  for  milk,  we  have  a  large  share  of  consumers  that  are  willing  to  pay  more  for 
16:560:31327:21:20:70:526:428:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:organic products, but not willing to pay as much as the market price. Comparing Table 3 with 
16:561:31420:20:21:70:526:408:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Table 5 shows that  the share  of consumers  stating they are willing  to  pay  more, exceeds  the 
16:562:31519:21:21:70:527:387:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:share of consumers actually paying more. This is because some of the consumers, stating they 
16:563:31612:21:20:70:526:366:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:are  willing  to  pay  more,  are  only  willing  to  pay  a  smaller  price  premium  than  the  current 
16:564:31718:20:21:70:526:346:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:market  price  premium.  These  consumers  state  a  positive  willingness  to  pay,  but  do  not  buy 
16:565:31822:21:21:70:526:325:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:any organic   products  at   current   prices   and   are   thus   not   registered   in   purchase   data. 
16:566:31930:21:21:70:526:304:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Consequently, a priori, we expect average stated willingness to pay for the organic version of 
16:567:32025:21:20:70:527:283:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the product to be lower than the price premium they are actually paying, as the low bids from 
16:568:32119:20:21:70:526:263:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:consumers  willing  to  pay  more,  but  only  willing  to  pay  less  than  the  current  market  price 
16:569:32224:21:21:70:527:242:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:premium,  are  included  in  the  estimate  of  stated  willingness  to  pay – but  not  in  the  revealed 
16:570:32330:21:20:70:311:221:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:willingness to pay estimated from purchase data.  
16:571:32379:20:21:106:526:201:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Milk is an exception to this, as  most  of the consumers  stating they are willing to pay 
16:572:32469:21:21:70:526:180:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:more  (59  percent  of  all  households,  cf.  Table  3),  are  also  willing  to  pay  the  market  price 
16:573:32576:21:20:70:527:159:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:premium  (55  percent  of  all  households,  cf.  Table  5).  Here  we  find  that  stated  willingness  to 
16:574:32684:20:21:70:178:139:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:pay exceeds revealed. 
16:575:32705:21:21:106:527:118:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:For  minced  beef,  in  contrast,  only  6  percent  (cf.  Table  5)  of  all  households  actually 
16:576:32805:21:21:70:526:97:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:purchase  organic  beef  and  thus  reveal  a  willingness  to  pay  the  market  price  premium. 
16:577:32903:21:0:70:526:76:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:However, according to the pilot study (cf. Table 3), 41 percent of all consumers state that they 
17:578:33002:0:21:70:526:760:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:are willing to pay more for organic beef. Thus, the share of consumers that are willing to pay 
17:579:33097:21:21:70:527:739:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:more for organic beef, but have a lower willingness to pay than the market price, however, is 
17:580:33191:21:21:70:527:718:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:not  included  in  the  estimate  of  revealed  willingness  to  pay – this  estimate  is  based  on  6 
17:581:33294:21:20:70:526:697:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:percent of consumers only. Conversely, the estimate of stated willingness to pay is based on 
17:582:33387:20:21:70:527:677:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:the 41 percent of the consumers willing to pay more, including consumers willing to pay less 
17:583:33480:21:21:70:492:656:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:than the market price making the stated willingness to pay lower than the revealed one. 
17:584:33567:21:20:106:527:635:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:This holds for potatoes and rye bread too; the difference between actual average price 
17:585:33654:20:21:70:526:615:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:premium paid and stated willingness to pay is quite small for potatoes and quite large for rye 
17:586:33749:21:21:70:526:594:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:bread, but again, actual payment exceeds stated willingness to pay. However, for rye bread, as 
17:587:33844:21:20:70:526:573:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:well  as  for  potatoes,  there  are  many  product  characteristics  or  quality  differences  due  to 
17:588:33948:20:21:70:526:553:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:season, type, consistency and taste, which we cannot observe from purchase data. For minced 
17:589:34040:21:21:70:526:532:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:beef  and  milk,  we  do  not  have  the  same  data  problem:  main  quality  differences  (apart  from 
17:590:34145:21:21:70:527:511:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:organic or not) are due to fat content, which we can observe.2 Thus, the unobservable quality 
17:591:34238:21:20:70:526:490:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:differences  for  potatoes  and  rye  bread  make  the  estimates  based  on  purchase  data  highly 
17:592:34339:20:19:70:121:470:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:uncertain.

17:656:34974:11:12:70:526:131:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:Please note that average price premiums are calculated from ordinary prices, that is, all products (conventional as 
17:657:35090:12:11:70:518:119:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:well as organic) sold as special offers are not included. Also, only households having positive WTP for organic 
17:658:35202:11:12:70:505:108:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:products are included, that is, households purchasing organic but not having positive WTP are not included.

17:660:35367:7:16:70:523:89:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:2 Almost all milk and most beef have Danish origin, and homogenisation of milk is related to organic production

18:662:35496:0:13:70:171:759:12:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:6. Future Research 
18:663:35514:13:21:70:527:746:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:  During  2002-2005,  we  will  continue  our  research  on  demand  for  organic  foods.  The 
18:664:35607:21:21:70:527:725:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times New Roman:project aims at modelling the individual household’s consumption  of  organic  foods,  and  its 
18:665:35703:21:20:70:526:704:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:dependence  on  important  factors  such  as  prices,  household  income,  geographic  location, 
18:666:35800:20:21:70:526:684:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f9:consumer’s occupation, age, number of children, etc. This will be done both for individual 
18:667:35891:21:21:70:527:663:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:goods  and  aggregated  commodity  groups  of  Danish  as  well  as  foreign  consumers,  including 
18:668:35991:21:20:70:526:642:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:estimates  of  price  and  income  elasticities.  Identifying  differences  in  demand  parameters  for 
18:669:36095:20:21:70:526:622:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:different types of households is both important as part of understanding the willingness to pay 
18:670:36191:21:21:70:526:601:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:(for organic foods as compared to conventional foods) of different consumer segments and as 
18:671:36283:21:21:70:290:580:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:part of an evaluation of the market potential.  
18:672:36330:21:20:70:527:559:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:  The  project  applies  information  at  the  individual  household  level  (panel  data)  as 
18:673:36423:20:21:70:526:539:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:described  in  Section  3  above,  which  makes  possible  a  detailed  and  informative  approach. 
18:674:36523:21:21:70:526:518:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Furthermore,  as  the  GfK  Group  has  household  panel  data  from  several  other  European 
18:675:36618:21:20:70:527:497:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:countries,  we  will  be  able  to  make  comparisons based  on  data  from  other  countries  as  well. 
18:676:36722:20:21:70:526:477:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:Finally,  as  described  in  Section  4  above,  the  modelling  is  supported  by  a  questionnaire, 
18:677:36824:21:21:70:526:456:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:surveying households in the very same panel as applied in the model estimations. An essential 
18:678:36918:21:20:70:527:435:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:feature and ultimate strength of the project is that it can examine differences between revealed 
18:679:37015:20:21:70:526:415:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:and  postulated  behaviour  and  enlarge  the  analysis  by  information  on  attitudes,  values,  food 
18:680:37119:21:21:70:267:394:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:habits/eating patterns and food interests. 
18:681:37161:21:21:70:527:373:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:  The core of the project is to establish the parameters of a utility based model of 
18:682:37244:21:20:70:526:352:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:household  preferences  for  organic  food  incorporating  explicit  representation  of  valued 
18:683:37340:20:21:70:526:332:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:product attributes and relevant underlying attitudes. Data for parameterisation can be divided 
18:684:37435:21:0:70:462:311:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:into nine types and will be collected through two vehicles, according to Figure 2.

19:703:37601:21:21:88:526:387:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:possible to estimate aggregate demand as a function of economic variables like prices and 
19:704:37691:21:20:88:526:366:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:income, and as a function of the share of different types of households. This will enable us 
19:705:37784:20:21:88:526:346:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:to  evaluate  the effect  of  policy  instruments  such  as  subsidies,  labelling,  information,  etc. 
19:706:37887:21:21:88:526:325:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:on  total  consumption  as  well  as  on  individual  consumer  segments.  It  is  of  particular 
19:707:37985:21:21:88:526:304:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:interest  to  examine  differences  in  consumers'  confidence  in  organic  product  labelling, 
19:708:38082:21:20:88:527:283:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:differences   in   food   culture   (attitudes   towards   imported   goods,   preferences   for 
19:709:38179:20:21:88:526:263:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:prepared/unprepared  products),  and  differences  in  sales  channels  (supermarkets,  direct 
19:710:38274:21:21:88:527:242:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:sales,  health-food  shops,  etc)  among  countries  and  among  different  consumer  groups
