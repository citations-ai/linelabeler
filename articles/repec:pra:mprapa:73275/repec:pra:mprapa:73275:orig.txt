2:30:314:13:12:85:88:441:11:Times:11:Times: 
2:31:314:12:13:85:513:429:11:Times:11:Times:The Chinese economy is currently faced with the difficult problems of slowing economic growth 
2:32:405:13:13:85:513:416:11:Times:11:Times:and  huge  overcapacity. China  is struggling  to  adapt  to a “new normal.” Here,  I examine  the 
2:33:503:13:12:85:513:403:11:Times:11:Times:mechanism of why  China is faced  with these  problems  and some potential future  paths of  the 
2:34:598:12:13:85:513:391:11:Times:11:Times:Chinese economy. China does not have a socialist, socialist market, or market-oriented economy. 
2:35:693:13:13:85:513:378:11:Times:11:Times:Rather, it has a “state-driven economy” and that has deviated far from the saddle path to the steady 
2:36:792:13:12:85:513:365:11:Times:11:Times:state. The  model of a state-driven  economy constructed  in this  paper indicates  that it is highly 
2:37:892:12:13:85:513:353:11:Times:11:Times:likely that China will proceed along a long-running transition path with low or no growth, but it 
2:38:986:13:13:85:385:340:11:Times:12:Times:is also very likely that China will excessively build up its military.

3:58:1469:0:14:212:388:726:18:Times:18:Times:1    INTRODUCTION 
3:59:1486:14:13:85:88:712:11:Times:11:Times: 
3:60:1486:13:13:85:513:699:11:Times:11:Times:The Chinese economy now appears to stand at a crossroads and be unsustainable anymore. China 
3:61:1575:13:12:85:513:686:11:Times:11:Times:will not be able to keep its past strategy of pursuing the highest economic growth possible. Many 
3:62:1667:12:13:85:513:674:11:Times:11:Times:researchers will agree with these views. Furthermore, the government of China itself is beginning 
3:63:1763:13:13:85:443:661:11:Times:11:Times:to think this way as it struggles to stabilize its economy under the “new normal.” 
3:64:1842:13:12:85:513:648:11:Times:11:Times: It is, however, unclear why China no longer can continue its long-standing high-growth 
3:65:1928:12:13:85:512:636:11:Times:11:Times:strategy. Although some fundamental change appears to be happening, the mechanism for why it 
3:66:2018:13:13:85:513:623:11:Times:11:Times:is happening has not been sufficiently presented (see, e.g., Huang and Wang, 2010; Dorrucci et 
3:67:2108:13:12:85:513:610:11:Times:11:Times:al.,  2013;  Albert  et  al.,  2015;  Maliszewski  and  Zhang,  2015). Articles  in  newspapers and 
3:68:2207:12:13:85:513:598:11:Times:11:Times:magazines frequently argue that a large-scale economic bubble in China either has or will soon 
3:69:2299:13:13:85:513:585:11:Times:11:Times:burst, but it is unclear from a theoretical standpoint that the current state of the Chinese economy 
3:70:2398:13:12:85:281:572:11:Times:11:Times:can be described as a bubble phenomenon.  
3:71:2438:12:13:85:512:560:11:Times:11:Times: In this  paper, I examine  the mechanism of the anomalies  in the  Chinese  economy by 
3:72:2523:13:12:85:513:547:11:Times:11:Times:introducing  the  concept  of a “state-driven  economy,” which is  different  from  either  socialist, 
3:73:2626:12:13:85:513:535:11:Times:11:Times:socialist market, or market-oriented economies. I show that China now faces an unsurmountable 
3:74:2719:13:13:85:513:522:11:Times:11:Times:barrier to growth because its high economic growth in the past few decades was realized by its 
3:75:2810:13:12:85:513:509:11:Times:11:Times:state-driven  economy, but this type  of economy  is  intrinsically unsustainable  and is  fated  to 
3:76:2910:12:13:85:180:497:11:Times:11:Times:eventually collapse.  
3:77:2931:13:13:85:513:484:11:Times:11:Times: Because China has been a state-driven economy, it has deviated far from the saddle path 
3:78:3018:13:12:85:513:471:11:Times:11:Times:to the steady state. Therefore, a change from the current unsustainable state-driven economy to a 
3:79:3116:12:13:85:512:459:11:Times:11:Times:sustainable economy will not be easy. If households greatly and suddenly increase consumption 
3:80:3208:13:13:85:513:446:11:Times:11:Times:up to a point on the saddle path, a smooth and peaceful transition can be achieved, but Harashima 
3:81:3305:13:12:85:513:433:11:Times:11:Times:(2009, 2013a, and 2016) showed that such a jump in consumption is very unlikely. As a result, 
3:82:3397:12:13:85:513:421:11:Times:11:Times:the  transition  will  require severe  restructuring over a  long  period.  I  examine  several  potential 
3:83:3504:13:13:85:513:408:11:Times:11:Times:options for this transition. One potential path could result in an excessively large and dangerous 
3:84:3601:13:12:85:167:395:11:Times:11:Times:military buildup.  
3:85:3618:12:20:85:88:383:11:Times:11:Times:

3:88:3637:17:14:85:399:332:16:Times:16:Times:2.1   The current state of the Chinese economy 
3:89:3683:14:12:85:512:318:11:Times:11:Times:The Chinese economy has grown at a high rate, i.e., its GDP has grown at about 10% annually 
3:90:3775:12:13:85:513:306:11:Times:11:Times:since the 1980s.1 However, the pace of  growth has recently slowed down. In  addition,  some 
3:91:3860:13:13:85:513:293:11:Times:11:Times:unusual  phenomena have emerged; in  particular,  the ratio of  investment to GDP has reached 
3:92:3951:13:12:85:512:280:11:Times:11:Times:nearly 50%. This rate is extremely high compared with those of other economies. In contrast, the 
3:93:4047:12:13:85:512:268:11:Times:11:Times:ratio of  consumption to  GDP is  extremely  low by  historic  standards (Dollar  and  Wei,  2007; 
3:94:4143:13:13:85:513:255:11:Times:11:Times:Knight and Ding, 2010; Huang and Wang, 2010; Lee et al., 2012, 2013; Dorrucci et al., 2013; 
3:95:4234:13:12:85:513:242:11:Times:11:Times:Albert et al., 2015; Maliszewski and Zhang, 2015). Another important anomaly is overcapacity. 
3:96:4328:12:13:85:513:230:11:Times:11:Times:Many  researchers have concluded and  even  the  Chinese  government has  admitted that  China 
3:97:4422:13:13:85:515:217:11:Times:11:Times:currently has a great deal of overcapacity2 (e.g., European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, 
3:98:4517:13:12:85:207:204:11:Times:11:Times:2009, 2016; OECD, 2015). 
3:99:4541:12:13:85:513:192:11:Times:11:Times: High growth rates in the early stages of development of an economy can be rationalized 
3:100:4626:13:13:85:512:179:11:Times:11:Times:theoretically in most conventional economic growth models. However, the anomalies observed 
3:101:4716:13:28:85:513:166:11:Times:11:Times:recently in China have rarely been observed. The existence of these rare phenomena implies that

4:107:5137:0:12:85:513:732:11:Times:11:Times:something significantly different has been occurring in the Chinese economy than was the case 
4:108:5229:12:13:85:206:720:11:Times:11:Times:for many other economies.

4:111:5302:16:13:85:284:673:14:Times:14:Times:2.2.1    Socialist market economy 
4:112:5335:13:13:85:513:660:11:Times:11:Times:China calls its economy a socialist market economy. Although this name is somewhat ambiguous, 
4:113:5427:13:12:85:512:647:11:Times:11:Times:it gives the impression that China has a simple mix of socialist and market-oriented economies, 
4:114:5521:12:13:85:513:635:11:Times:11:Times:but  how  mixed is  the  economy actually? Superficially, China may look like a  market-oriented 
4:115:5615:13:13:85:512:622:11:Times:11:Times:economy with  a small remaining legacy  of  socialism because  there  are  many  markets  and 
4:116:5708:13:12:85:512:609:11:Times:11:Times:privately  owned  enterprises. However, in  reality, elements  of its market-oriented  economy are 
4:117:5805:12:13:85:516:597:11:Times:11:Times:limited even now because state-owned enterprises (SOEs) dominate many fundamental industries. 
4:118:5898:13:13:85:512:584:11:Times:11:Times:In addition, the state (both nationally and locally) wields a strong influence on various aspects of 
4:119:5998:13:12:85:513:571:11:Times:11:Times:economic activities, financial markets are heavily regulated, most financial institutions are owned 
4:120:6098:12:13:85:512:559:11:Times:11:Times:and governed by the state, and most investments are made by SOEs or enterprises that are at least 
4:121:6191:13:13:85:513:546:11:Times:11:Times:partially  under  the  influence  of  the  state (Li  et  al.,  2008;  World  Bank,  2013; IMF,  2015). The 
4:122:6299:13:12:85:363:533:11:Times:11:Times:Chinese economy is therefore still largely driven by the state.  
4:123:6362:12:13:85:512:521:11:Times:11:Times: This could indicate that the Chinese economy is actually a socialist economy, but if it 
4:124:6447:13:13:85:513:508:11:Times:11:Times:is, it is not the idealized socialist economy as theoretically described by Lange (1936, 1937, and 
4:125:6545:13:12:85:513:495:11:Times:11:Times:1938) and Lerner (1944). The idealized socialist economy is driven by the state, but it mimics a 
4:126:6641:12:13:85:513:483:11:Times:11:Times:market-oriented economy. Therefore, consumption in a socialist economy is supposed to proceed 
4:127:6735:13:13:85:513:470:11:Times:11:Times:on  the  saddle  path  and  reach the steady  state that  is  optimal  for  households. However, the 
4:128:6832:13:12:85:513:457:11:Times:11:Times:anomalies discussed in Section 2.1 (e.g., the extremely low consumption ratio) indicate that it is 
4:129:6929:12:13:85:404:445:11:Times:11:Times:highly likely that China is not on a path that is optimal for households,  
4:130:7002:13:13:85:513:432:11:Times:11:Times: Hence, the  Chinese economy is  neither a socialist nor a market-oriented economy. In 
4:131:7086:13:12:85:513:419:11:Times:11:Times:addition, it is not even a simple mix of these two types of economy because both socialist and 
4:132:7179:12:13:85:513:407:11:Times:11:Times:market-oriented economies commonly proceed  on the path that is  optimal for households. The 
4:133:7272:13:12:85:512:394:11:Times:11:g_d0_f8:anomalies shown in Section 2.1 indicate that the Chinese economy is driven not by households’ 
4:134:7366:12:13:85:513:382:11:Times:11:Times:optimization behaviors but rather by something else. The Chinese economy, therefore, seems to 
4:135:7458:13:13:85:493:369:11:Times:11:Times:be fundamentally different from other industrialized economies (see Dorrucci et al., 2013).  
4:136:7546:13:15:85:88:356:11:Times:11:Times: 
4:137:7546:15:13:85:261:341:14:Times:14:Times:2.2.2    State-driven economy 
4:138:7574:13:13:85:513:328:11:Times:11:Times:Here, I call an economy a “state-driven economy” if it is largely under the control of the state and 
4:139:7673:13:13:85:513:315:11:Times:11:Times:managed by the state so as to achieve a target rate of growth that is also set by the state. In this 
4:140:7773:13:12:85:513:302:11:Times:11:Times:sense, the Chinese economy appears to be a state-driven economy. The most important evidence 
4:141:7864:12:13:85:513:290:11:Times:11:Times:supporting  this  conclusion is  that, as noted in  Section  2.1, the  ratio  of  investment to GDP  has 
4:142:7967:13:13:85:513:277:11:Times:11:Times:gradually  increased  during  the  past few decades and  is currently  about 50%. If consumption

4:144:8155:12:13:85:513:252:11:Times:11:Times:and eventually stabilize usually at about 20%. If the economy is state-driven, on the other hand, 
4:145:8251:13:13:85:513:239:11:Times:11:Times:the ratio will theoretically continue to increase to 100%, as will be shown in Section 3. Therefore, 
4:146:8350:13:12:85:513:226:11:Times:11:Times:the observed gradual and continuous increase in the investment ratio strongly suggests that China 
4:147:8447:12:13:85:203:214:11:Times:11:Times:is a state-driven economy. 
4:148:8472:13:13:85:513:201:11:Times:11:g_d0_f8: A state-driven economy is driven not by households’ optimization behaviors but by the 
4:149:8557:13:12:85:513:188:11:g_d0_f8:11:Times:state’s will, which is independent of that of households, particularly in its desire to achieve the 
4:150:8655:12:13:85:513:176:11:Times:11:Times:highest economic growth possible. Similar to a socialist economy, the state largely controls the 
4:151:8751:13:13:85:513:163:11:Times:11:g_d0_f8:economy, but unlike the (idealized) socialist economy, the state does not care about households’ 
4:152:8845:13:12:85:513:150:11:Times:11:Times:optimality. History  has  shown  that established  socialist  economies are strongly  prone to be 
4:153:8941:12:13:85:512:138:11:Times:11:Times:transformed to  state-driven economies because many socialist  economies  were  established in 
4:154:9033:13:13:85:513:125:11:Times:11:g_d0_f8:undemocratic  countries where government policies generally ignored households’  utilities. 
4:155:9123:13:12:85:512:112:11:Times:11:Times:Furthermore, a socialist market economy, as China calls itself, also highly likely degenerates into 
4:156:9218:12:0:85:513:100:11:Times:11:Times:a state-driven economy in an undemocratic country. China is undoubtedly undemocratic, so it is 
5:157:9309:0:12:85:512:732:11:Times:11:g_d0_f8:not surprising that its economy is  state-driven and that households’ optimization behaviors are 
5:158:9404:12:13:85:211:720:11:Times:14:Times:largely ignored by the state.

8:430:12688:13:13:85:513:707:11:Times:11:g_d0_f8: Because a state-driven economy is not driven by households’ optimization behaviors, 
8:431:12771:13:12:85:512:694:11:Times:11:Times:its  consumption path is  different  from  the  saddle  path.  Because  the  objective  of  the state is  to 
8:432:12878:12:13:85:513:682:11:Times:11:Times:continue a constant (high) growth rate, initial consumption will be set lower than it is on the saddle 
8:433:12979:13:13:85:513:669:11:Times:11:Times:path. An important point is that consumption in the state-driven economy does not approach the 
8:434:13072:13:12:85:512:656:11:Times:11:Times:steady state. As a result, the path of consumption of a state-driven economy will be situated below 
8:435:13172:12:13:85:513:644:11:Times:11:Times:the saddle path, as shown in Figure 1, and particularly far below if the state pursues a very high 
8:436:13270:13:13:85:513:631:11:Times:11:Times:growth rate. In addition, because households’ optimization behaviors are irrelevant, capital will

8:445:13884:13:12:85:513:534:11:Times:11:Times:households and the current marginal product of capital, we could determine where China is on 
8:446:13976:12:13:85:513:522:11:Times:11:Times:the curve but, in practice, these factors are quite difficult to determine. Therefore, we must infer

8:451:14387:13:13:85:513:458:11:Times:11:Times:clearly perceived in a state-driven economy if the state restrains further investments. The model 
8:452:14484:13:16:85:513:445:11:Times:11:Times:of a state-driven economy indicates that the economy will eventually collapse when0tc, but 
8:453:14574:16:13:85:513:429:11:Times:11:Times:the state will  not allow  the  economy  to collapse. In  periods when  capital is already hugely 
8:454:14667:13:13:85:512:416:11:Times:11:Times:accumulated, the state may begin to doubt whether it continues the state-driven economy and to 
8:455:14757:13:12:85:513:403:11:Times:11:Times:restrain  investments. The  current  overcapacity  in  China  seems  to  reflect  such  a  change  in  the 
8:456:14863:12:13:85:513:391:11:Times:11:Times:state’s  behavior,  i.e.,  reluctance  to  invest  further. Therefore,  it  is  highly  likely  that China’s 
8:457:14970:13:13:85:476:378:11:Times:11:Times:consumption is situated to the right of the bold vertical line in Figure 1 (e.g., at point X).

8:461:15091:18:13:85:213:314:16:Times:16:Times:4.1    Basic options 
8:462:15111:13:13:85:513:301:11:Times:11:Times:If China does not want its state-driven economy to inevitably collapse, it needs to change to an 
8:463:15205:13:12:85:512:288:11:Times:11:Times:economy that will eventually stabilize at a steady state. There are several options for the transition 
8:464:15307:12:13:85:166:276:11:Times:11:Times:to a steady state.  
8:465:15326:13:13:85:88:263:11:Times:11:Times: 
8:466:15326:13:12:85:498:250:11:Times:11:Times:Option (1): The state lets the economy reach the steady state that is optimal for households.  
8:467:15419:12:13:85:426:238:11:Times:11:Times:Option (2): The state compulsorily makes point W in Figure 1 a steady state. 
8:468:15493:13:13:85:513:225:11:Times:11:Times:Option (3): The state compulsorily makes point V in Figure 1 a steady state (V corresponds to the 
8:469:15586:13:12:85:412:212:11:Times:11:Times:kt where consumption is highest on the path of the state-driven economy). 
8:470:15658:12:13:85:88:200:11:Times:11:Times: 
8:471:15658:13:13:85:512:187:11:Times:11:Times:Option (1) means that the objective of the state has completely changed from maintaining high 
8:472:15749:13:20:85:513:174:11:Times:11:Times:growth rates to stabilizing the economy at the steady state for households. If China is currently at 
8:473:15849:20:10:85:409:154:11:Times:12:g_d0_f12:point X, this change indicates that investment becomes negative (0

8:476:15920:7:22:421:513:154:11:Times:11:Times:). That is, excessive 
8:477:15941:22:13:85:513:132:11:Times:11:Times:capital is “consumed” or destroyed, and production shrinks until the economy reaches the steady 
8:478:16035:13:13:85:513:119:11:Times:11:Times:state (remember that neither technological progress nor depreciation of capital is assumed in this 
8:479:16130:13:12:85:513:106:11:Times:11:Times:model). In  other  words,  negative  growth  rates  continue  for  a  long  period. Nevertheless,  if the 
8:480:16236:12:0:85:513:94:11:Times:11:Times:representative household’s  consumption  jumps from point X to Z in  Figure  1, consumption 
9:481:16323:0:12:85:513:732:11:Times:11:Times:proceeds on the saddle path, and Pareto efficiency is maintained during the transition to the steady 
9:482:16422:12:21:85:116:720:11:Times:11:Times:state.  
9:483:16429:21:10:85:390:699:11:Times:12:g_d0_f12: Option (2) means that no new investment is made (0

9:486:16481:7:22:402:513:699:11:Times:11:Times:), but unlike  Option (1), 
9:487:16508:22:13:85:512:677:11:Times:11:Times:investment does not become negative. On the other hand, the state forces consumption to suddenly 
9:488:16605:13:12:85:512:664:11:Times:11:Times:increase from point X to W and forces it to stay at point W. As a result, the levels of consumption, 
9:489:16701:12:13:85:513:652:11:Times:11:Times:production and capital remain unchanged at the steady state described by point W. In Figure 1, 
9:490:16792:13:13:85:513:639:11:Times:11:Times:the levels of production, consumption, and capital are larger at point W than at the original steady 
9:491:16890:13:12:85:483:626:11:Times:11:Times:state. Judged only from this aspect, Option (2) may be viewed as preferable to Option (1). 
9:492:16977:12:13:85:513:614:11:Times:11:Times: Option (3) is basically the same as Option (2) in that the state chooses a steady state that 
9:493:17069:13:13:85:513:601:11:Times:11:Times:is not optimal for households, but it differs in that investment is not stopped at the present level, 
9:494:17169:13:12:85:513:588:11:Times:11:Times:but when capital reaches the level that corresponds to the highest consumption on the path of the 
9:495:17265:12:13:85:512:576:11:Times:11:Times:state-driven economy. In this example, this level corresponds to the production indicated by point 
9:496:17364:13:13:85:513:563:11:Times:11:Times:V in  Figure  1. Until point V is  reached, investments  continue  to  be  made  and  capital still 
9:497:17460:13:12:85:512:550:11:Times:11:Times:accumulates. After arriving at point V, the  state halts investments  and the  economy remains  at 
9:498:17558:12:13:85:513:538:11:Times:11:Times:point V indefinitely. The levels of consumption, production, and capital are larger at point V than 
9:499:17654:13:12:85:513:525:11:Times:11:Times:those at point W. Judged only from this aspect, Option (3) may be preferable to Options (2) and 
9:500:17749:12:13:85:103:513:11:Times:11:Times:(1). 
9:501:17753:13:18:85:88:500:11:Times:11:Times: 
9:502:17753:18:13:85:193:482:16:Times:16:Times:4.2   Option (1) 
9:503:17769:13:13:85:512:469:11:Times:11:Times:Option (1) has several possible subordinate options on how to reach the steady state, including 
9:504:17863:13:12:85:289:456:11:Times:11:Times:the following two basic subordinate options:  
9:505:17908:12:13:85:88:444:11:Times:11:Times: 
9:506:17908:13:13:85:371:431:11:Times:11:Times:Option (1-1): The state stops directly controlling the economy.  
9:507:17969:13:12:85:513:418:11:Times:11:Times:Option (1-2): The  state still  directly controls the  economy or it stops  directly  controlling  the 
9:508:18069:12:13:85:419:406:11:Times:11:Times:economy but still largely intervenes in the economy through fiscal policies. 
9:509:18145:13:13:85:88:393:11:Times:11:Times: 
9:510:18145:13:12:85:512:380:11:Times:11:Times:Option (1-1) means that households and firms are released from the state’s control and are allowed 
9:511:18241:12:13:85:512:368:11:Times:11:Times:to reach their optimal steady state. Option (1-2) means that the state’s goal changes from high 
9:512:18335:13:13:85:512:355:11:Times:11:Times:growth rates to reaching the steady state, but the transition path to the steady state is still largely 
9:513:18439:13:12:85:195:342:11:Times:11:Times:influenced by the state.  
9:514:18464:12:16:85:88:330:11:Times:11:Times: 
9:515:18464:16:13:85:204:314:14:Times:14:Times:4.2.1  Option (1-1) 
9:516:18482:13:13:85:513:301:11:Times:11:Times:If the representative household’s consumption jumps from point X to point Z on the saddle path, 
9:517:18574:13:12:85:513:288:11:Times:11:Times:consumption will decrease along the saddle path and gradually approach the steady state while 
9:518:18665:12:13:85:513:276:11:Times:11:g_d0_f8:maintaining Pareto   efficiency. Note   that an increase   in   the representative household’s 
9:519:18760:13:13:85:513:263:11:Times:11:Times:consumption means the consumption of excess capital indicated by the gap between the saddle 
9:520:18851:13:12:85:513:250:11:Times:11:Times:path and production for each kt, which is initially the gap between point Z and W.3 As a result, 
9:521:18946:12:13:85:513:238:11:Times:11:Times:negative  economic  growth rates continue  for  a  long  period, but unemployment  rates will  not 
9:522:19044:13:13:85:510:225:11:Times:11:Times:increase and resources will not be destroyed or left unused. This is the consequence of Option (1-
9:523:19141:13:12:85:512:212:11:Times:11:Times:1),  which  I  call Consequence  (1-1-1). (All subsequent consequences  follow  this  numbering 
9:524:19236:12:13:85:123:200:11:Times:11:Times:format.) 
9:525:19244:13:13:85:513:187:11:Times:11:Times: However, it is highly unlikely that the representative household will jump from point X 
9:526:19331:13:12:85:512:174:11:Times:11:Times:to Z. The mechanism for why it is very unlikely to jump is explained in Harashima (2009, 2013a, 
9:527:19425:12:13:85:513:162:11:Times:11:Times:and 2016) and also in the Appendix. Households are risk averse and intrinsically non-cooperative; 
9:528:19519:13:28:85:513:149:11:Times:11:Times:therefore, they behave strategically in game theoretic situations. Because of these features, when 
9:529:19616:28:7:85:231:121:10:Times:10:Times:                                                           
9:530:19674:7:15:85:512:114:6:Times:10:g_d0_f8:3 If depreciation of capital is assumed to exist, the “consumption” of excess capital will be achieved by a 
9:531:19781:15:12:85:512:99:10:Times:10:Times:reduction  of  investments  that  correspond  to  depreciated  capital  and  an  increase  in  consumer  goods  and 
9:532:19897:12:0:85:126:87:10:Times:10:Times:services.  
10:533:19908:0:12:85:513:732:11:Times:11:Times:households  strategically  consider whether or  not the  jump  is  better  for  them (i.e.,  in  a game 
10:534:20010:12:13:85:513:720:11:Times:11:Times:theoretic situation), they will generally conclude that they obtain a higher expected utility if they 
10:535:20111:13:13:85:512:707:11:Times:11:Times:do  not  jump. Hence,  households  will  not actually choose  this  path and instead  will choose  a 
10:536:20210:13:12:85:513:694:11:Times:11:Times:different transition path to the steady state (e.g., the bold dashed curve in Figure 1). Because this 
10:537:20311:12:13:85:513:682:11:Times:11:Times:transition path is not on the saddle path, it is not Pareto efficient. Therefore, the excess resources 
10:538:20408:13:13:85:513:669:11:Times:11:Times:indicated by the gap between the saddle path and the Pareto inefficient transition path for each kt 
10:539:20505:13:12:85:513:656:11:Times:11:Times:(initially, the gap between points Z and X) will be left idle or abandoned. Unemployment rates 
10:540:20597:12:13:85:467:644:11:Times:11:Times:will increase sharply and stay at high levels for a long period (Consequence (1-1-2)).  
10:541:20682:13:16:85:88:631:11:Times:11:Times: 
10:542:20682:16:13:85:204:615:14:Times:14:Times:4.2.2  Option (1-2) 
10:543:20701:13:12:85:513:602:11:Times:11:Times:To avoid Consequence (1-1-2), the state could suddenly increase its consumption.4 Suppose for 
10:544:20791:12:13:85:512:590:11:Times:11:Times:simplicity  that the  government  consumption is  zero at  present. With this jump, the sum  of  the 
10:545:20892:13:13:85:513:577:11:g_d0_f8:11:Times:representative household’s and the government’s consumptions reaches point Z and then proceeds 
10:546:20983:13:12:85:513:564:11:Times:11:Times:along the  saddle  path, as  noted  previously. Because  the state  consumes a  large  amount  of the 
10:547:21081:12:13:85:513:552:11:Times:11:Times:excess resources, unemployment rates do not rise and a huge amount of resources need not be left 
10:548:21175:13:13:85:440:539:11:Times:11:Times:idle or destroyed, but negative economic growth will continue for a long period. 
10:549:21254:13:12:85:513:526:11:Times:11:Times: The  question  arises,  however,  how  does  the  state  consume  such  a  large  quantity  of 
10:550:21349:12:13:85:513:514:11:Times:11:Times:excess resources, most of which are capital inputs that have already been produced? In fact, there 
10:551:21445:13:13:85:513:501:11:Times:11:Times:are several possible ways for the state to consume the resources, including the three subordinate 
10:552:21539:13:12:85:208:488:11:Times:11:Times:options described below.    
10:553:21564:12:13:85:512:476:11:Times:11:Times: Conceptually, government  consumption  is  the  collective  consumption  of  households 
10:554:21651:13:12:85:513:463:11:Times:11:Times:through  the  expenditures of  government (e.g.,  various  kinds  of  administrative  services  that 
10:555:21751:12:13:85:513:451:11:Times:11:Times:households receive), so a sudden increase in government consumption can be used as a substitute 
10:556:21845:13:13:85:255:438:11:g_d0_f8:11:Times:for that of households’ consumption.  
10:557:21882:13:12:85:512:425:11:Times:11:Times: In  addition, an  increase  in  government  consumption will generally be financed  by 
10:558:21968:12:13:85:513:413:11:Times:11:Times:government  borrowing  if  the  economy  is  changed  to  a  market-oriented  economy,  but  if  the 
10:559:22069:13:13:85:513:400:11:Times:11:Times:economy  is still  largely  under  the  control  of  the  state,  it can also be financed by explicit  and 
10:560:22174:13:12:85:513:387:11:Times:11:Times:implicit taxes on households. An example of an implicit tax would be the state setting nominal 
10:561:22269:12:13:85:513:375:11:Times:11:g_d0_f8:interest rates artificially low and thereby transferring a part of households’ savings into the state’s 
10:562:22373:13:13:85:513:362:11:Times:11:Times:hands, for example, through state-owned banks. Another example of an implicit tax is to restrain 
10:563:22466:13:13:85:435:349:11:Times:11:Times:the wages of employees in SOEs and transfer the resulting profits to the state.  
10:564:22546:13:14:85:88:336:12:Times:12:Times: 
10:565:22546:14:13:85:206:322:12:Times:12:Times:4.2.2.1  Option (1-2-1) 
10:566:22569:13:13:85:513:309:11:Times:11:Times:The easiest way for a state to consume excess resources is simply to buy them from firms and 
10:567:22658:13:12:85:513:296:11:Times:11:Times:dispose of them (Option (1-2-1)). “Dispose of” in this case includes not only eliminating them 
10:568:22751:12:13:85:512:284:11:Times:11:Times:but also  leaving them unused  forever and constructing useless infrastructure. It  will also mean 
10:569:22847:13:12:85:512:271:11:Times:11:Times:giving laborers busy work such as the classic example of “having workers dig holes and then fill 
10:570:22943:12:13:85:513:259:11:Times:11:Times:them back up.” These  activities  do  not generate any  utility for households, but they can  be 
10:571:23037:13:13:85:513:246:11:Times:11:Times:interpreted  as a  kind  of “consumption” in the broad  sense that the products purchased are 
10:572:23128:13:12:85:513:233:11:Times:11:Times:intentionally  made unusable. High  unemployment  rates  can  be avoided, but huge  amounts  of 
10:573:23222:12:13:85:513:221:11:Times:11:Times:resources are systematically and continuously disposed of and negative growth rates continue for 
10:574:23319:13:13:85:154:208:11:Times:11:Times:a long period.  
10:575:23333:13:12:85:513:195:11:Times:11:Times: However,  many  people, including  high-ranking government officials, may not  accept 
10:576:23415:12:13:85:413:183:11:Times:11:Times:simply throwing away huge amounts of resources for no obvious reason.

10:578:23483:14:12:85:206:156:12:Times:12:Times:4.2.2.2  Option (1-2-2) 
10:579:23506:12:13:85:513:144:11:Times:11:Times:Because Option (1-2-1) seems to be too absurd to be actually accepted, the government will search 
10:580:23603:13:13:85:512:131:11:Times:11:Times:for alternative ways to consume the excess resources that cannot be used for investments because 
10:581:23698:13:20:85:513:118:11:Times:11:Times:the  economy would  otherwise deviate  from  the  saddle  path. One  of the alternative  ways is  to

11:584:23948:0:12:85:513:732:11:Times:11:Times:export the excess  resources to  other  countries at lower prices than the  prevailing international 
11:585:24045:12:13:85:518:720:11:Times:11:Times:prices (Option (1-2-2)). This is not “consumption” in the literal sense, but it can be interpreted as  
11:586:24144:13:13:85:512:707:11:Times:11:Times:a sort of consumption in that exports are an element of demand. The state does not necessarily 
11:587:24235:13:12:85:512:694:11:Times:11:Times:need to directly export the excess resources. Instead, it can indirectly support exports by directly 
11:588:24332:12:13:85:513:682:11:Times:11:Times:subsidizing firms or  through  various  kinds  of  regulations. High  unemployment  rates can  be 
11:589:24427:13:13:85:437:669:11:Times:11:Times:avoided with this option, but negative growth rates continue for a long period.  
11:590:24506:13:12:85:513:656:11:Times:11:Times: An  important problem with Option (1-2-2) is that other countries may  not accept the 
11:591:24589:12:13:85:513:644:11:Times:11:Times:excessive exports. Option (1-2-2) clearly means setting prices that are far lower than the costs of 
11:592:24688:13:13:85:512:631:11:Times:11:Times:production (i.e.,  dumping) on a  large  scale. For  the  option  to  work, export  prices must  be 
11:593:24786:13:12:85:512:618:11:Times:11:Times:artificially set much lower than prevailing international prices. Because of this, export firms will 
11:594:24884:12:13:85:513:606:11:Times:11:Times:lose money, but their losses will be compensated by the state using money obtained by borrowing 
11:595:24977:13:12:85:398:593:11:Times:11:Times:or by extracting it from households through explicit or implicit taxes.  
11:596:25047:12:13:85:513:581:11:Times:11:Times: If the Chinese economy had a very small share of the world economy, such large-scale 
11:597:25130:13:13:85:513:568:11:Times:11:Times:dumping would not have a significant impact on other countries, and the world might ignore or 
11:598:25223:13:12:85:513:555:11:Times:11:Times:at least tolerate the dumping. However, China is currently the world’s second-largest economy. 
11:599:25317:12:13:85:512:543:11:Times:11:Times:Hence, if it engages in large-scale dumping, it will certainly distort international trade and have 
11:600:25416:13:13:85:513:530:11:Times:11:Times:large negative impacts on the other countries. Other large countries would not be likely to stay 
11:601:25511:13:12:85:510:517:11:Times:11:Times:silent on this issue and would likely take countermeasures, for example, by imposing high anti-
11:602:25602:12:13:85:513:505:11:Times:11:Times:dumping customs. Currently, many G7 countries suspect that China is already exporting steel at 
11:603:25695:13:13:85:513:492:11:Times:11:Times:below-market prices (i.e., dumping steel), and they have implicitly warned China to stop doing 
11:604:25787:13:12:85:513:479:11:Times:11:Times:so.5 The  scale  of overcapacity in China in some important  industrial  materials (e.g.,  steel  and 
11:605:25883:12:13:85:513:467:11:Times:11:Times:cement) seems  to greatly  exceed the sum  of demand in all other  countries (European  Union 
11:606:25974:13:13:85:513:454:11:Times:11:Times:Chamber of Commerce in China, 2009, 2016). In essence, China’s overcapacity is so large that it 
11:607:26070:13:12:85:342:441:11:Times:11:Times:will be impossible for them to export it away peacefully.  
11:608:26127:12:13:85:513:429:11:Times:11:Times: In addition, under a floating exchange rate, dumping and the consequent trade surpluses 
11:609:26213:13:13:85:512:416:11:Times:11:Times:may result in currency appreciation, which would cancel out the effect of imposing lower prices. 
11:610:26309:13:12:85:512:403:11:Times:11:Times:As a result, excess resources still could not be exported to a sufficient extent. Therefore, Option 
11:611:26406:12:13:85:390:391:11:Times:11:Times:(1-2-2) most likely won’t succeed unless the exchange rate is fixed.  
11:612:26474:13:13:85:513:378:11:Times:11:Times: Another problem with Option (1-2-2) is the huge international imbalances that would 
11:613:26557:13:12:85:513:365:11:Times:11:Times:accumulate  as a  consequence  of  the excessive exports.  Because  there  is  no excess demand by 
11:614:26653:12:13:85:513:353:11:Times:11:Times:households in China, it will not import excess amounts of consumer goods or services using the 
11:615:26744:13:12:85:513:340:11:Times:11:Times:money obtained by exporting the excessive resources. Huge trade imbalances will be generated. 
11:616:26837:12:13:85:512:328:11:Times:11:Times:Such international imbalances may result in various anomalies, such as asset price hikes and falls 
11:617:26936:13:13:85:510:315:11:Times:11:Times:and so-called “bubbles,” both domestically and internationally. In sum, even though Option (1-2-
11:618:27030:13:12:85:513:302:11:Times:11:Times:2) may be somewhat adoptable in practice, there are many barriers to fully adopting this option 
11:619:27122:12:13:85:341:290:11:Times:11:Times:as a way to suddenly increase government consumption.  
11:620:27176:13:14:85:88:277:11:Times:11:Times: 
11:621:27176:14:13:85:206:263:12:Times:12:Times:4.2.2.3  Option (1-2-3) 
11:622:27199:13:12:85:512:250:11:Times:11:Times:Capital inputs are also able to produce arms and munitions with only small modifications. Hence, 
11:623:27294:12:13:85:513:238:11:Times:11:Times:the  necessary  increase  in  government  consumption  can  be easily achieved  by a  large military 
11:624:27393:13:12:85:512:225:11:Times:11:Times:buildup (Option  (1-2-3)). High  unemployment  rates can  be avoided,  but negative  growth  rates 
11:625:27489:12:13:85:510:213:11:Times:11:Times:will continue for a long period as armaments are excessively accumulated (Consequence (1-2-3-
11:626:27579:13:13:85:108:200:11:Times:11:Times:a)).  
11:627:27584:13:13:85:512:187:11:Times:11:Times: An important problem of Option (1-2-3) is that a unilateral excessive military buildup 
11:628:27669:13:12:85:513:174:11:Times:11:Times:will  greatly  worsen  international  relations  and  increase political  and  military tensions among 
11:629:27772:12:13:85:513:162:11:Times:11:Times:countries. The probability of a country choosing Option (1-2-3) will be significantly higher in an 
11:630:27867:13:12:85:513:149:11:Times:11:Times:undemocratic country than in a democratic country because the rulers in an undemocratic country 
11:631:27961:12:13:85:512:137:11:Times:11:Times:typically rely  on  violence or  the  threat  of  violence as a  basis  for  their  power and will prefer a 
11:632:28064:13:26:85:513:124:11:Times:11:Times:strong  military  far  more  than leaders in  a  democratic  country. Furthermore,  an  excessive and 
11:633:28166:26:8:85:231:98:10:Times:10:Times:                                                           
11:634:28224:8:0:85:488:90:6:Times:10:Times:5 See G7 Ise-Shima Leaders’ Declaration, delivered at G7 Ise-Shima Summit on May 26–27, 2016. 
12:635:28315:0:12:85:513:732:11:Times:11:Times:unilateral buildup of military power in an undemocratic country is unquestionably dangerous for 
12:636:28408:12:13:85:184:720:11:Times:11:Times:the rest of the world.  
12:637:28431:13:13:85:513:707:11:Times:11:Times: Another important problem is that the excessive military buildup needed to reach the 
12:638:28514:13:12:85:513:694:11:Times:11:Times:steady state must diminish gradually to zero as the economy approaches the steady state. Initially, 
12:639:28613:12:13:85:512:682:11:Times:11:Times:the necessary increase in military spending is the gap between point X and W, but gaps between 
12:640:28706:13:13:85:513:669:11:Times:11:Times:the  saddle  path  and  the  Pareto  inefficient  transition  path then diminish  gradually  to  zero. It  is 
12:641:28816:13:12:85:513:656:11:Times:11:Times:doubtful, however, that this pattern of military spending will be easily accepted by the military. 
12:642:28912:12:13:85:513:644:11:Times:11:Times:Once military spending has been greatly increased, the military may strongly resist any reductions 
12:643:29008:13:13:85:513:631:11:Times:11:g_d0_f8:regardless of prevailing economic and social conditions, particularly the state’s objective to reach 
12:644:29109:13:12:85:513:618:11:Times:11:Times:the  steady  state. If the resistance  is  strong enough that  the  government  cannot  reduce  military 
12:645:29213:12:13:85:512:606:11:Times:11:Times:spending sufficiently, the objective of reaching the steady state will not be achieved. This means 
12:646:29311:13:12:85:513:593:11:Times:11:Times:that Option (1-2-3) would not be fully implemented and the nature of the state-driven economy 
12:647:29401:12:13:85:512:581:11:Times:11:Times:would remain largely the same. As a result, the economy will inevitably collapse as predicted by 
12:648:29496:13:13:85:377:568:11:Times:11:Times:the model of the state-driven economy (Consequence (1-2-3-b)).

12:650:29558:17:14:85:193:538:16:Times:16:Times:4.3  Option (2) 
12:651:29573:14:13:85:331:524:11:Times:11:Times:There are two basic subordinate options for Option (2): 
12:652:29626:13:12:85:88:511:11:Times:11:Times: 
12:653:29626:12:13:85:513:499:11:Times:11:Times:Option (2-1): The state forces households to suddenly increase their consumption up to point W 
12:654:29719:13:12:85:357:486:11:Times:11:Times:and then continues to force it to stay at point W indefinitely.  
12:655:29780:12:13:85:513:474:11:Times:11:Times:Option (2-2): The state suddenly increases government consumption to shift consumption (the 
12:656:29870:13:13:85:513:461:11:Times:11:Times:sum  of  the representative household’s and the government’s consumptions) up to point W and 
12:657:29962:13:12:85:313:448:11:Times:11:Times:then again forces it to stay at point W indefinitely.  
12:658:30014:12:13:85:88:436:11:Times:11:Times: 
12:659:30014:13:13:85:513:423:11:Times:11:Times:Option (2-1) achieves the increased consumption (up to W) by shifting household consumption, 
12:660:30105:13:12:85:512:410:11:Times:11:Times:whereas Option  (2-2) shifts government  consumption. Option  (2-1) cannot be  adopted  if  the 
12:661:30199:12:13:85:513:398:11:Times:11:g_d0_f8:economy changes to a market-oriented economy because households’ optimality is achieved not 
12:662:30290:13:13:85:513:385:11:Times:11:Times:at point W, and the state cannot force households to consume against their will. Option (2-2) can 
12:663:30388:13:12:85:513:372:11:Times:11:Times:be  implemented  in either a market-oriented  economy or an economy  that  is  largely  under  the 
12:664:30486:12:13:85:178:360:11:Times:11:Times:control of the state.  
12:665:30508:13:16:85:88:347:11:Times:11:Times: 
12:666:30508:16:13:85:204:331:14:Times:14:Times:4.3.1    Option (2-1) 
12:667:30529:13:12:85:513:318:11:Times:11:Times:Option (2-1) is highly unlikely to be adopted because point W is not optimal for households. To 
12:668:30620:12:13:85:512:306:11:Times:11:Times:make  households maintain consumption at  point W,  the state must first allow  households  to 
12:669:30714:13:13:85:512:293:11:Times:11:Times:consume freely up to point W but then prohibit them from consuming beyond point W. However, 
12:670:30804:13:12:85:512:280:11:Times:11:Times:as argued for Option (1-1), if households are allowed to consume freely, they will choose a Pareto 
12:671:30903:12:13:85:512:268:11:Times:11:Times:inefficient transition path (the bold dashed curve in Figure 1). The state therefore needs to force 
12:672:31001:13:13:85:513:255:11:Times:11:Times:households to suddenly increase their consumption to point W against their wills. However, it is 
12:673:31097:13:12:85:513:242:11:Times:11:Times:likely  that  such  enforcement  will  eventually fail because  of households’ explicit and implicit 
12:674:31197:12:13:85:512:230:11:Times:11:Times:resistance and hesitation. Furthermore, even  if such forced  consumption could  be successfully 
12:675:31292:13:13:85:512:217:11:Times:11:Times:implemented, the state quite likely would think that this type of forced consumption is absurd and 
12:676:31390:13:12:85:260:204:11:Times:11:Times:it would be better to use Option (2-2).  
12:677:31430:12:16:85:88:192:11:Times:11:Times: 
12:678:31430:16:13:85:204:176:14:Times:14:Times:4.3.2  Option (2-2) 
12:679:31449:13:13:85:513:163:11:Times:11:Times:Depending  on  how government  consumption  is suddenly  increased, Option  (2-2)  has  three 
12:680:31543:13:12:85:513:150:11:Times:11:Times:subordinate  options. Similar  to  the  situation  in Option  (1-2), an  increase  in  government 
12:681:31641:12:13:85:513:138:11:Times:11:Times:consumption will  be financed  by government  borrowing  or explicit  and implicit  taxes  on 
12:682:31734:13:13:85:513:125:11:Times:11:Times:households in  any  of the three  subordinate  options. In  addition, new  investments cannot  be 
12:683:31829:13:12:85:512:112:11:Times:11:Times:substituted for increases in government consumption because the economy will otherwise deviate 
12:684:31923:12:0:85:149:100:11:Times:11:Times:from point W. 
13:685:31938:0:13:85:88:732:11:Times:11:Times: 
13:686:31938:13:13:85:212:719:12:Times:12:Times:4.3.2.1  Option (2-2-1)  
13:687:31962:13:13:85:513:706:11:Times:11:Times:The easiest way to suddenly increase government consumption is to simply dispose of the excess 
13:688:32054:13:12:85:513:693:11:Times:11:Times:resources (Option (2-2-1)). The economy stays at point W and high unemployment rates can be 
13:689:32144:12:13:85:513:681:11:Times:11:Times:avoided,  and unlike  Option  (1-2-1),  the  rate  of  growth  is zero, not  negative. The problems 
13:690:32244:13:13:85:436:668:11:Times:11:Times:associated with Option (2-2-1) are the same as those noted for Option (1-2-1).

13:692:32321:14:12:85:206:641:12:Times:12:Times:4.3.2.2  Option (2-2-2) 
13:693:32344:12:13:85:513:629:11:Times:11:Times:A second option is to export the excess resources (Option (2-2-2)). High unemployment rates are 
13:694:32438:13:12:85:510:616:11:Times:11:Times:avoided, and the rate of growth is zero, not negative. The problems associated with Option (2-2-
13:695:32529:12:13:85:513:604:11:Times:11:Times:2) are the  same  as those noted  for Option  (1-2-2). Hence, similar  to Option  (1-2-2),  it  will  be 
13:696:32633:13:13:85:255:591:11:Times:11:Times:difficult to fully adopt Option (2-2-2). 
13:697:32672:13:14:85:88:578:11:Times:11:Times: 
13:698:32672:14:12:85:206:564:12:Times:12:Times:4.3.2.3  Option (2-2-3) 
13:699:32695:12:13:85:512:552:11:Times:11:Times:In the third option, the necessary increase in government consumption is achieved by a military 
13:700:32788:13:13:85:513:539:11:Times:11:Times:buildup (Option (2-2-3)). High unemployment rates can be avoided, and the rate of growth is zero 
13:701:32881:13:12:85:513:526:11:Times:11:Times:for  a  long  period while armaments  are excessively built  up. Similar  to Option  (1-2-3),  the 
13:702:32976:12:13:85:512:514:11:Times:11:Times:probability of choosing Option (1-2-3) will be significantly higher in an undemocratic  country 
13:703:33070:13:13:85:216:501:11:Times:11:Times:than in a democratic country. 
13:704:33099:13:12:85:512:488:11:Times:11:Times: The  problems associated  with Option  (2-2-3)  are basically  same  as those noted  for 
13:705:33186:12:13:85:513:476:11:Times:11:Times:Option (1-2-3). A difference between the two options is that, unlike the case for Option (1-2-3), 
13:706:33283:13:12:85:513:463:11:Times:11:Times:the excessive military spending need not be diminished as time passes. It can remain indefinitely 
13:707:33379:12:13:85:141:451:11:Times:11:Times:at point W.  
13:708:33391:13:18:85:88:438:11:Times:11:Times: 
13:709:33391:18:13:85:193:420:16:Times:16:Times:4.4  Option (3) 
13:710:33406:13:13:85:288:407:11:Times:11:Times:Option (3) has two basic subordinate options. 
13:711:33449:13:12:85:88:394:11:Times:11:Times:

13:721:34020:16:13:85:204:261:14:Times:14:Times:4.4.2  Option (3-2) 
13:722:34039:13:13:85:513:248:11:Times:11:Times:After reaching point V, the characteristics of Option (3-2) are basically same as those of Option 
13:723:34137:13:12:85:512:235:11:Times:11:Times:(2-2), and depending on how government consumption increases when production reaches point 
13:724:34228:12:13:85:315:223:11:Times:11:Times:V, Option (3-2) also has three subordinate options.  
13:725:34279:13:14:85:88:210:11:Times:11:Times: 
13:726:34279:14:12:85:206:196:12:Times:12:Times:4.4.2.1  Option (3-2-1) 
13:727:34302:12:13:85:513:184:11:Times:11:Times:In the first option, increases in government consumption are achieved simply by disposing of the 
13:728:34395:13:13:85:512:171:11:Times:11:Times:excess resources and then the economy remains at point V (Option (3-2-1)). High unemployment 
13:729:34485:13:12:85:512:158:11:Times:11:Times:rates can be avoided. Before reaching point V, the rate of growth is positive, but after that, it is 
13:730:34585:12:13:85:510:146:11:Times:11:Times:zero. The problems associated with Option (3-2-1) are the same as those noted for Options (1-2-
13:731:34676:13:13:85:158:133:11:Times:11:Times:1) and (2-2-1).  
13:732:34691:13:13:85:88:120:11:Times:11:Times: 
13:733:34691:13:13:85:206:107:12:Times:12:Times:4.4.2.2  Option (3-2-2) 
13:734:34714:13:0:85:513:94:11:Times:11:Times:In the second option, increases in government consumption are achieved by exporting the excess 
14:735:34809:0:12:85:512:732:11:Times:11:Times:resources (Option (3-2-2)). High unemployment rates are avoided, and before reaching point V, 
14:736:34900:12:13:85:513:720:11:Times:11:Times:the rate of growth is positive, and afterwards it is zero. Problems associated with Option (3-2-2) 
14:737:34997:13:13:85:513:707:11:Times:11:Times:are the same as those noted for Options (1-2-1) and (2-2-1). Hence, it will also be difficult to fully 
14:738:35096:13:12:85:182:694:11:Times:11:Times:adopt Option (3-2-2). 
14:739:35117:12:14:85:88:682:11:Times:11:Times: 
14:740:35117:14:13:85:206:668:12:Times:12:Times:4.4.2.3    Option (3-2-3) 
14:741:35142:13:12:85:513:655:11:Times:11:Times:In  the  third  option,  increases in  government  consumption are achieved by a military  buildup 
14:742:35238:12:13:85:513:643:11:Times:11:Times:(Option (3-2-3)). High unemployment rates can be avoided, and before reaching point V, the rate 
14:743:35332:13:13:85:513:630:11:Times:11:Times:of growth is positive, but after that, the rate of growth is zero for a long period as armaments are 
14:744:35430:13:12:85:513:617:11:Times:11:Times:excessively accumulated (Consequence  (3-2-3-a)). Similar  to Options (1-2-3) and  (2-2-3),  the 
14:745:35523:12:13:85:513:605:11:Times:11:Times:probability of Option (1-2-3) being chosen will be significantly higher in an undemocratic country 
14:746:35620:13:13:85:513:592:11:Times:11:Times:than in a democratic country. The problems associated with Option (3-2-3) are basically the same 
14:747:35714:13:12:85:277:579:11:Times:11:Times:as those with Options (1-2-3) and (2-2-3).  
14:748:35755:12:13:85:513:567:11:Times:11:Times: However,  if a country is  undemocratic,  it  seems  doubtful that the  military will  be 
14:749:35844:13:13:85:512:554:11:Times:11:Times:satisfied  with the  level  of military  buildup  at  point V, and much  less at  point W. The  essential 
14:750:35950:13:12:85:513:541:11:Times:11:Times:nature of Options (2) and (3) is that the state decides to stay at a particular point forever, but such 
14:751:36054:12:13:85:513:529:11:Times:11:Times:a point need not necessarily be limited to points W and V. Point W will be chosen if the increase 
14:752:36147:13:13:85:513:516:11:Times:11:Times:is implemented at the present time, and point V will be chosen if the highest consumption level 
14:753:36242:13:12:85:513:503:11:Times:11:Times:on  the  path  of a state-driven  economy is  regarded  to  be the most  important factor. But  other 
14:754:36342:12:13:85:513:491:11:Times:11:Times:reasons could be  used for choosing a  point  for  a  steady  state.  Because  the  military  in  an 
14:755:36439:13:12:85:512:478:11:Times:11:Times:undemocratic country does not care about households’ optimality, it may insist that investments 
14:756:36533:12:13:85:512:466:11:Times:11:Times:be continued and that even more capital be accumulated past the levels corresponding with point 
14:757:36626:13:13:85:513:453:11:Times:11:Times:V for the sake of a higher level of production. At the same time, the military may also insist that 
14:758:36724:13:12:85:512:440:11:Times:11:Times:armaments continuously be built up even if the level of investments needs to be reduced to some 
14:759:36818:12:13:85:471:428:11:Times:11:Times:extent and thereby the pace of capital accumulation will slow down (Option (3-2-3-b)). 
14:760:36903:13:13:85:513:415:11:Times:11:Times: If Option (3-2-3-b) is chosen, household consumption will be squeezed from the level 
14:761:36986:13:12:85:513:402:11:Times:11:Times:at point V to a lower level by a similar mechanism as that shown in the model of a state-driven 
14:762:37079:12:13:85:513:390:11:Times:11:Times:economy, possibly to a very low level. Nevertheless, it is also likely that the military knows not 
14:763:37175:13:13:85:512:377:11:Times:11:Times:to squeeze household consumption too much, or households may rebel against the government 
14:764:37261:13:12:85:512:364:11:Times:11:Times:and  the  military.  Hence, it  is  likely the  military  will  agree  to  stop additional investments  and 
14:765:37368:12:13:85:513:352:11:Times:11:Times:military buildup before the rebellion of households can no longer be sufficiently constrained. In 
14:766:37464:13:13:85:513:339:11:Times:11:Times:this  case,  armaments  are increased to a certain limit, and the  consumption  of  households is 
14:767:37560:13:12:85:513:326:11:Times:11:Times:squeezed to a limit, but the economy can remain at a steady state indefinitely, although the country 
14:768:37659:12:13:85:351:314:11:Times:11:Times:becomes grotesquely militaristic (Consequence (3-2-3-b)).  
14:769:37715:13:13:85:513:301:11:Times:11:Times: Option (3-2-3-b) will be likely chosen if the country is seriously undemocratic because 
14:770:37803:13:12:85:512:288:11:g_d0_f8:11:Times:households’  optimality will  be generally ignored. Note  that Consequence  (3-2-3-b) is only 
14:771:37893:12:13:85:512:276:11:Times:11:Times:sustainable if the assumption that a household rebellion can be constrained is satisfied, but this 
14:772:37992:13:13:85:502:263:11:Times:11:Times:assumption may not always be satisfied if some exogenous disturbances unexpectedly occur.

14:775:38111:14:12:85:512:219:11:Times:11:Times:None of the options can be recommended without hesitation or negative consequences. Option 
14:776:38200:12:13:85:512:207:11:Times:11:Times:(1-1) will generally result in Consequence (1-1-2), and Options (2-1) and (3-1) will not generally 
14:777:38298:13:13:85:513:194:11:Times:11:Times:be adopted. Options (1-2-1), (2-2-1), and (3-2-1) seem to be absurd because large quantities of 
14:778:38391:13:12:85:513:181:11:Times:11:Times:resources are  continuously  disposed of. Options (1-2-2), (2-2-2), and  (3-2-2) will face strong 
14:779:38485:12:13:85:512:169:11:Times:11:Times:opposition and resistance by foreign countries. Options (1-2-3) and (3-2-3) will likely result in 
14:780:38581:13:12:85:322:156:11:Times:11:Times:Consequences (1-2-3-b) and (3-2-3-b), respectively.  
14:781:38632:12:13:85:512:144:11:Times:11:Times: Options (1-1), (1-2-1), and (1-2-3) have the common feature of negative growth rates 
14:782:38711:13:13:85:513:131:11:Times:11:Times:for a long period, and Options (2-2-1), (2-2-3), (3-2-1), and (3-2-3) have the common feature of 
14:783:38802:13:13:85:513:118:11:Times:11:Times:zero growth  rates  for  a  long  period. Nevertheless, China  could  take  advantage  of world 
14:784:38898:13:12:85:512:105:11:Times:11:Times:technological progress (the model assumes no technological progress), so negative or zero rates 
14:785:38993:12:0:85:512:93:11:Times:11:Times:may not be actually be observed. That said, the Chinese economy is going to have to experience

15:817:40399:13:12:85:513:349:11:Times:11:Times:Among the feasible options, Options (1-2-1), (2-2-1), and (3-2-1) seem to be relatively better for 
15:818:40493:12:13:85:513:337:11:Times:11:Times:the households of China because both high unemployment rates and an excessive military buildup 
15:819:40587:13:13:85:513:324:11:Times:11:Times:can  be avoided. These options, however, have the common  drawback  that a huge amount  of 
15:820:40674:13:12:85:512:311:11:Times:11:Times:resources are  disposed of continuously  in  the  name  of  government  consumption,  but  this

15:822:40860:13:13:85:513:286:11:Times:11:Times:unemployment rates or an excessive military buildup. Nevertheless, the rulers of the PRC may 
15:823:40952:13:12:85:512:273:11:Times:11:Times:have different ideas and prefer Option (3-2-3-b)—military buildup—because China is currently

15:829:41136:14:12:85:513:183:11:Times:11:Times:The path of the Chinese  economy gives us  a  sense  of déjà  vu because China  seems  to  have 
15:830:41229:12:13:85:512:171:11:Times:11:Times:followed a similar path of another important state-driven economy, that of the Soviet Union. It is 
15:831:41324:13:12:85:512:158:11:Times:11:Times:highly likely the Soviet Union had a state-driven economy. After World War II, the Soviet Union 
15:832:41419:12:13:85:513:146:11:Times:11:Times:experienced high rates of economic growth for decades, as the model of a state-driven economy 
15:833:41511:13:13:85:513:133:11:Times:11:Times:predicts. The Soviet Union’s economy peaked during the era of Khrushchev and the early era of 
15:834:41603:13:12:85:512:120:11:Times:11:Times:Brezhnev in the 1960s. However, as the model predicts, the problems of overcapacity and low 
15:835:41693:12:13:85:513:108:11:Times:11:g_d0_f8:economic growth were gradually aggravated in the 1970s. At the same time, the Soviet Union’s 
15:836:41783:13:0:85:510:95:11:Times:11:Times:military buildup continued. This military buildup may indicate that Option (1-2-3), (2-2-3), or (3-
16:837:41881:0:12:85:513:732:11:Times:11:Times:2-3) was partially adopted because the government realized that its state-driven economy would 
16:838:41971:12:13:85:512:720:11:Times:11:Times:eventually be difficult to sustain. Nevertheless, although some market modification were made, 
16:839:42065:13:13:85:331:707:11:Times:11:Times:the state-driven economy was basically maintained.    
16:840:42117:13:12:85:513:694:11:Times:11:Times: In the era of Gorbachev in the 1980s, however, the aggravated problems of overcapacity 
16:841:42202:12:13:85:513:682:11:Times:11:Times:and  low economic growth  could no  longer be  concealed. In  addition,  as  the  model  predicts, 
16:842:42300:13:13:85:513:669:11:Times:11:Times:household consumption was increasingly squeezed.  In  the  end, the Soviet Union collapsed in 
16:843:42394:13:12:85:513:656:11:Times:11:Times:1991. After its collapse, Russian president Boris Yeltsin chose a sort of “hard-landing” scenario, 
16:844:42490:12:13:85:513:644:11:Times:11:Times:that is, Option (1-1). As noted in Section 4, however, it resulted in Consequence (1-1-2): negative 
16:845:42585:13:13:85:513:631:11:Times:11:Times:or  low rates  of economic  growth,  high  unemployment  rates, and a large  amount  of  capital 
16:846:42681:13:12:85:513:618:11:Times:11:Times:destruction. Hence, the popularity of Option (1-1) (and President Yeltsin) declined sharply among 
16:847:42776:12:13:85:163:606:11:Times:11:Times:Russian people.  
16:848:42792:13:12:85:512:593:11:Times:11:Times: In 2000, new Russian president Vladimir Putin  changed the economic  policies of  his 
16:849:42875:12:13:85:513:581:11:Times:11:Times:predecessor.  Putin replaced Option  (1-1) with Option  (1-2), (2-2), or  (3-3), at  least  partially. 
16:850:42973:13:13:85:513:568:11:Times:11:Times:Because of the economy had already experienced 10 years of Option (1-1), Putin’s changes may 
16:851:43061:13:13:85:405:555:11:Times:11:Times:have resulted in a mix of consequences from the several options chosen.

16:853:43128:17:14:85:447:525:16:Times:16:Times:5.2    Differences between China and the Soviet Union 
16:854:43180:14:12:85:513:511:11:Times:11:Times:The situations of China and the Soviet Union are, of course, not completely the same. After an 
16:855:43272:12:13:85:513:499:11:Times:11:Times:initial unsettled period  when the  Soviet  Union was first established,  its  economy grew at  high 
16:856:43371:13:12:85:512:486:11:Times:11:Times:rates in the 1930s, but this high growth rate was interrupted during World War II. After World 
16:857:43463:12:13:85:512:474:11:Times:11:Times:War II, the economy again began to grow rapidly. That is, with the exception of the war period, 
16:858:43559:13:13:85:512:461:11:Times:11:Times:the Soviet Union basically grew at a fast rate from the beginning. On the other hand, the Chinese 
16:859:43655:13:12:85:513:448:11:Times:11:Times:economy  did  not  grow rapidly until  the  economic  reforms led by  Deng  Xiaoping began to  be 
16:860:43750:12:13:85:512:436:11:Times:11:Times:implemented in the 1980s, even though China has been a  state-driven  economy since the PRC 
16:861:43840:13:13:85:513:423:11:Times:11:Times:was founded in 1949. Unlike the Soviet Union, the PRC did not experience a large-scale war, and 
16:862:43934:13:12:85:513:410:11:Times:11:Times:conditions  for  fast  growth  seem  to  have been met since  its  founding. The  Chinese  economy, 
16:863:44033:12:13:85:316:398:11:Times:11:Times:however, did not grow rapidly for several decades.  
16:864:44080:13:13:85:513:385:11:Times:11:g_d0_f8: The long stagnation  before  the  economic  reforms may  have  been caused  by China’s 
16:865:44166:13:12:85:513:372:11:Times:11:Times:limited accesses to natural resources, technologies, and international markets resulting from its 
16:866:44260:12:13:85:512:360:11:Times:11:Times:international isolation. In contrast, the territory of the Soviet Union consisted of about one-sixth 
16:867:44360:13:13:85:513:347:11:Times:11:Times:of the world’s land area, and there were sufficiently large amounts of raw materials, particularly 
16:868:44455:13:12:85:513:334:11:Times:11:Times:oil  and  natural  gas, to  sustain  its  economy.  Technologies  in  the  Soviet  Union  were also  more 
16:869:44560:12:13:85:513:322:11:Times:11:Times:developed. Unlike the Soviet Union, the territory of China is not large enough to self-supply all 
16:870:44657:13:13:85:513:309:11:Times:11:Times:of its raw materials, particularly energy, and it did not have good access to international markets. 
16:871:44756:13:12:85:512:296:11:Times:11:Times:In addition, the level of technology was very low in China until relatively recently. Because of 
16:872:44853:12:13:85:513:284:11:Times:11:Times:these  restrictions and  its policy  of isolationism,  economic  growth  in  China  was very  likely 
16:873:44952:13:12:85:360:271:11:Times:11:Times:severely hindered before the economic reforms of the 1980s.  
16:874:45011:12:13:85:513:259:11:Times:11:Times: After the economic reforms, the Chinese economy began to grow rapidly. An important 
16:875:45095:13:13:85:513:246:11:Times:11:Times:reason for this high growth was unquestionably the opening up of China to outside markets. China 
16:876:45192:13:12:85:512:233:11:Times:11:Times:joined in the free trade system that was constructed after World War II and has been protected 
16:877:45287:12:13:85:513:221:11:Times:11:Times:internationally, mainly by U.S. diplomatic and military efforts. China was able to access almost 
16:878:45381:13:13:85:513:208:11:Times:11:Times:all resources and technologies from throughout the world. The restrictions on natural resources, 
16:879:45475:13:12:85:512:195:11:Times:11:g_d0_f8:technologies, and international markets that restricted growth had been lifted. As a result, China’s 
16:880:45575:12:13:85:513:183:11:Times:11:Times:state-driven economy was able to operate without hindrances. Conversely, China’s prosperity at 
16:881:45669:13:13:85:513:170:11:Times:11:Times:present also can only be sustained under the current free  trade  system that  is  still protected 
16:882:45762:13:12:85:288:157:11:Times:11:Times:internationally, mainly by the United States.  
16:883:45807:12:13:85:512:145:11:Times:11:Times: Technology is another important factor. In Sections 3 and 4, I assumed for simplicity 
16:884:45891:13:13:85:513:132:11:Times:11:Times:that technology remains unchanged, but technological progress is important for sustaining steady 
16:885:45987:13:12:85:513:119:11:Times:11:Times:economic  growth.  Because  the  Soviet  Union  was  isolated  from  the  western  world,  it  had  to 
16:886:46090:12:13:85:512:107:11:Times:11:Times:generate innovations and new technologies by itself. However, Harashima (2011) showed that a 
16:887:46180:13:0:85:512:94:11:Times:11:Times:socialist   economy   cannot sufficiently generate   innovations   except for some   intrinsically 
17:888:46281:0:12:85:513:732:11:Times:11:Times:nonmarket goods and services (e.g., military technologies) because such an economy cannot fully 
17:889:46375:12:13:85:513:720:11:Times:11:Times:utilize human intelligence through competition in decentralized markets. This argument can be 
17:890:46469:13:13:85:513:707:11:Times:11:Times:also  applied  to  a  state-driven  economy  because  the  state largely controls  the economy in  both 
17:891:46572:13:12:85:513:694:11:Times:11:Times:socialist  and  state-driven  economies. As  a  result,  the  level  of  technology  in  the  Soviet  Union 
17:892:46680:12:13:85:513:682:11:Times:11:Times:gradually lagged behind that in the western world, and the growth of the Soviet Union’s economy 
17:893:46775:13:13:85:513:669:11:Times:11:Times:eventually almost  stopped. A  lack  of growth  will make an economy  vulnerable  to  various 
17:894:46869:13:12:85:512:656:11:Times:11:Times:exogenous shocks and raise the probability of households’ uprising against the government and 
17:895:46962:12:13:85:147:644:11:Times:11:Times:the military.  
17:896:46976:13:13:85:512:631:11:Times:11:Times: Unlike the Soviet Union, China can generally access the latest technologies except for 
17:897:47063:13:12:85:513:618:11:Times:11:Times:key military technologies because it is a member of the free trade system. Hence, even if China 
17:898:47158:12:13:85:513:606:11:Times:11:Times:itself cannot sufficiently generate innovations because of its nature as a state-driven economy, it 
17:899:47256:13:12:85:513:593:11:Times:11:Times:can  achieve  technological  progress  by  buying  the  latest  technologies  from the outside world. 
17:900:47357:12:13:85:513:581:11:Times:11:Times:Unlike the Soviet Union, therefore, China may mitigate some of the pain of the transition by using 
17:901:47453:13:13:85:513:568:11:Times:11:Times:new technologies purchased from foreign countries to help its economy grow. As a result, unlike 
17:902:47547:13:12:85:513:555:11:Times:11:Times:the people of the Soviet Union, the Chinese people may not rebel against the government and the 
17:903:47642:12:13:85:513:543:11:Times:11:Times:military, even under Consequence (3-2-3-b). This situation could become very dangerous for the 
17:904:47734:13:13:85:513:530:11:Times:11:Times:rest of the world because the Chinese military could continue to grow excessively for an indefinite 
17:905:47831:13:12:85:129:517:11:Times:11:Times:period.

17:907:47839:20:14:173:426:485:18:Times:18:Times:6  CONCLUDING REMARKS 
17:908:47860:14:12:85:88:471:11:Times:11:Times: 
17:909:47860:12:13:85:512:459:11:Times:11:Times:The growth of the Chinese economy has recently slowed down and overcapacity has become a 
17:910:47948:13:13:85:513:446:11:Times:11:Times:serious  problem.  China will  have  to change  its  strategy  for  economic  growth. In  this  paper,  I 
17:911:48053:13:12:85:513:433:11:Times:11:Times:showed  that  the difficulty that  China now faces is  an  inevitable  consequence  of a state-driven 
17:912:48153:12:13:85:516:421:11:Times:11:Times:economy, which is intrinsically unsustainable and will inevitably collapse at some point in time.  
17:913:48250:13:13:85:513:408:11:Times:11:Times: Although things may be perceived as difficult in China now, its future path will be much 
17:914:48337:13:12:85:513:395:11:Times:11:Times:more difficult. Making the change to a sustainable economy will necessitate a long and painful 
17:915:48430:12:13:85:513:383:11:Times:11:Times:transition period.  Some  options  may  mitigate the pain, but they  also  are accompanied  some 
17:916:48524:13:13:85:513:370:11:Times:11:Times:negative side effects, for example, an excessive military buildup. China seems to be following the 
17:917:48619:13:12:85:513:357:11:Times:11:Times:path of the former Soviet Union, which also very likely had a state-driven economy. However, 
17:918:48710:12:13:85:512:345:11:Times:11:Times:unlike  the  Soviet Union, China has  been able  to and most likely should continue  to be able  to 
17:919:48810:13:13:85:512:332:11:Times:11:Times:utilize  technologies developed  in  other  countries.  This  advantage  may  mitigate some  of the 
17:920:48910:13:12:85:512:319:11:Times:11:Times:negative impacts of the transition in China, but it may also be worse for the rest of the world if 
17:921:49004:12:13:85:490:307:11:Times:11:Times:China chooses an excessively large military buildup that will continue almost indefinitely.  
17:922:49093:13:12:85:510:294:11:Times:11:Times: The most frightening potential scenario for the world is that China chooses Option (3-
17:923:49179:12:13:85:513:282:11:Times:11:Times:2-3-b), and the probability of a large-scale war increases. China is not a democratic country and 
17:924:49276:13:13:85:513:269:11:Times:11:Times:thus the probability that Option (3-2-3-b) is chosen is not necessarily low. Hence, the most urgent 
17:925:49375:13:12:85:513:256:11:Times:11:Times:and difficult task facing the rest of the world is to prevent Option (3-2-3-b) from being chosen 
17:926:49471:12:13:85:513:244:11:Times:11:Times:and to encourage China to choose  Option (1-2-1), (2-2-1), or  (3-2-1).  These  options  are  not 
17:927:49566:13:13:85:363:231:11:Times:11:Times:without drawbacks, but they are better than the other options.  
17:928:49626:13:12:85:513:218:11:Times:11:Times: If Option (3-2-3-b) were to be chosen and the Chinese military were to be excessively 
17:929:49709:12:13:85:512:206:11:Times:11:Times:and continuously built up,  China would most  likely become isolated  from many  other nations 
17:930:49803:13:13:85:512:193:11:Times:11:Times:because political and military relations among them would become aggravated. China could even 
17:931:49896:13:12:85:512:180:11:Times:11:Times:be ousted from the free trade system. The leaders of China need to keep in mind that, as noted in 
17:932:49993:12:13:85:512:168:11:Times:11:Times:Section  5.2,  China can only prosper and even build  up  its armaments under  the existing 
17:933:50082:13:13:85:513:155:11:Times:11:Times:international free  trade  system that  is  currently primarily protected by  U.S.  diplomatic and 
17:934:50179:13:12:85:162:142:11:Times:11:Times:military efforts.

18:942:50297:16:13:85:191:649:14:Times:14:Times:A1.1    The shock 
18:943:50314:13:13:85:513:636:11:Times:11:Times:The  model  describes  the  utility  maximization  of  households  after  an  upward  time  preference 
18:944:50417:13:13:85:513:623:11:Times:11:Times:shock. This shock was chosen because it is one of the few shocks that result in a Nash equilibrium 
18:945:50516:13:12:85:513:610:11:Times:11:Times:of a  Pareto inefficient path. Another important reason for selecting an  upward time  preference 
18:946:50614:12:13:85:513:598:11:Times:11:Times:shock is that it shifts the steady state to lower levels of production and consumption than before 
18:947:50713:13:13:85:462:585:11:Times:11:Times:the shock, which is consistent with the phenomena actually observed in a recession.  
18:948:50797:13:12:85:513:572:11:Times:11:Times:  Although the rate of time preference is a deep parameter, it has not been regarded as a 
18:949:50885:12:13:85:513:560:11:Times:11:Times:source of shocks for economic fluctuations, possibly because the rate of time preference is thought 
18:950:50985:13:12:85:512:547:11:Times:11:Times:to be constant and not to shift suddenly. There is also a practical reason, however. Models with a 
18:951:51084:12:13:85:513:535:11:Times:11:Times:permanently constant rate of time preference exhibit excellent tractability (see Samuelson, 1937). 
18:952:51183:13:13:85:513:522:11:Times:11:Times:However,  the  rate  of  time  preference  has  been  naturally  assumed  and  actually  observed  to  be 
18:953:51289:13:12:85:512:509:11:Times:11:Times:time-variable.  The  concept  of  a  time-varying  rate  of  time  preference  has  a  long  history  (e.g., 
18:954:51398:12:13:85:512:497:11:Times:11:Times:Böhm-Bawerk, 1889; Fisher, 1930). More recently, Lawrance (1991) and Becker and Mulligan 
18:955:51487:13:13:85:513:484:11:Times:11:Times:(1997) showed that people do not inherit permanently constant rates of time preference by nature 
18:956:51584:13:12:85:513:471:11:Times:11:Times:and  that  economic  and  social  factors  affect  the  formation  of  time  preference  rates.  Their 
18:957:51687:12:13:85:513:459:11:Times:11:Times:arguments  indicate  that  many  incidents  can  affect  and  change  the  rate  of  time  preference 
18:958:51789:13:13:85:513:446:11:Times:11:Times:throughout a person’s life. For example, Parkin (1988) examined business cycles in the United 
18:959:51883:13:12:85:512:433:11:Times:11:Times:States, explicitly considering the time-variability of the time preference rate, and showed that the 
18:960:51984:12:13:85:427:421:11:Times:11:Times:rate of time preference was as volatile as technology and leisure preference.

18:962:52062:16:13:85:200:392:14:Times:14:Times:A1.2    Households 
18:963:52080:13:12:85:513:379:11:Times:11:Times:Households are not intrinsically cooperative. Except in a strict communist economy, households 
18:964:52175:12:13:85:513:367:11:Times:11:Times:do not coordinate themselves to behave as a single entity when consuming goods and services. 
18:965:52268:13:13:85:513:354:11:Times:11:Times:The model in this paper assumes non-cooperative, identical, and infinitely long living households 
18:966:52365:13:12:85:513:341:11:Times:11:Times:and  that  the  number  of  households  is  sufficiently  large.  Each  of  them  equally  maximizes  the

19:1034:53888:12:19:85:513:538:11:Times:11:Times:that the economy is at steady state before the shock. After the upward time preference shock, the

19:1038:54086:28:13:85:513:497:11:Times:11:Times:Fig. 1). To keep Pareto efficiency, consumption needs to jump immediately from the steady state 
19:1039:54181:13:13:85:512:484:11:Times:11:Times:before the shock (the prior steady state) to point Z. After the jump, consumption proceeds on the 
19:1040:54279:13:12:85:512:471:11:Times:11:Times:Pareto efficient saddle path after the shock (the posterior Pareto efficient saddle path) from point 
19:1041:54379:12:13:85:512:459:11:Times:11:Times:Z to  the  lower  steady  state  after  the  shock  (the  posterior  steady  state).  Nevertheless,  this 
19:1042:54484:13:13:85:513:446:11:Times:11:Times:discontinuous jump to Z may be uncomfortable for risk-averse households that wish to smooth 
19:1043:54575:13:12:85:513:433:11:Times:11:Times:consumption  and  not  to  experience  substantial  fluctuations.  Households  may  instead  take  a 
19:1044:54676:12:13:85:513:421:11:Times:11:Times:shortcut and, for example, proceed on a path on which consumption is reduced continuously from 
19:1045:54771:13:13:85:513:408:11:Times:11:Times:the prior steady state to the posterior steady state (the bold dashed line in Fig. 1), but this shortcut 
19:1046:54876:13:12:85:185:395:11:Times:11:Times:is not Pareto efficient. 
19:1047:54899:12:13:85:513:383:11:Times:11:Times:  Choosing   a   Pareto   inefficient   consumption   path   must   be   consistent   with   each 
19:1048:54995:13:12:85:513:370:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f8:household’s maximization of its expected utility. To examine the possibility of the rational choice 
19:1049:55095:12:13:85:512:358:11:Times:11:Times:of a Pareto inefficient path, the expected utilities between the two options need be compared. For 
19:1050:55194:13:13:85:512:345:11:Times:11:Times:this  comparison,  I  assume  that  there  are  two  options  for  each  non-cooperative  household  with 
19:1051:55300:13:13:85:513:332:11:Times:11:Times:regard to consumption just after an upward shift in time preference. The first is a jump option, J, 
19:1052:55399:13:12:85:513:319:11:Times:11:Times:in which a household’s consumption jumps to Z and then proceeds on the posterior Pareto efficient 
19:1053:55496:12:13:85:512:307:11:Times:11:Times:saddle  path  to  the  posterior  steady  state.  The  second  is  a  non-jump  option, NJ,  in  which  a 
19:1054:55601:13:12:85:512:294:11:g_d0_f8:11:Times:household’s consumption does not jump but instead gradually decreases from the prior steady 
19:1055:55693:12:14:85:513:282:11:Times:11:Times:state to the posterior steady state, as shown by the bold dashed line in Figure A1. The household 
19:1056:55791:14:15:85:512:268:11:Times:11:Times:that chooses the NJ option reaches the posterior steady state in period 0s. The difference in 
19:1057:55886:15:12:85:513:253:11:Times:11:Times:consumption between the two options in each period t is bt (≥ 0). Thus, b0 indicates the difference 
19:1058:55982:12:13:85:512:241:11:Times:11:Times:between Z and the prior steady state. bt diminishes continuously and becomes zero in period s.

20:1073:56497:12:13:85:512:687:11:Times:11:Times:  It is also assumed that, when a household chooses a different option from the one the 
20:1074:56581:13:13:85:513:674:11:Times:11:Times:other households choose, the difference in the accumulation of financial assets resulting from the 
20:1075:56680:13:12:85:513:661:11:Times:11:Times:difference in consumption (bt) before period s between that household and the other households 
20:1076:56773:12:13:85:512:649:11:Times:11:Times:is reflected in consumption after period s. That is, the difference in the return on financial assets 
20:1077:56875:13:13:85:513:636:11:g_d0_f8:11:Times:is added to (or subtracted from) the household’s consumption in each period after period s. The 
20:1078:56971:13:12:85:436:623:11:Times:11:Times:exact functional form of the addition (or subtraction) is shown in Section A1.4.

20:1080:57051:16:13:85:166:595:14:Times:14:Times:A1.3    Firms 
20:1081:57064:13:13:85:513:582:11:Times:11:Times:Unutilized products because of bt are eliminated quickly in each period by firms because holding 
20:1082:57156:13:12:85:513:569:11:Times:11:Times:them for a long period is a cost to firms. Elimination of unutilized products is accomplished by 
20:1083:57247:12:13:85:513:557:11:Times:11:Times:discarding the goods or preemptively suspending production, thereby leaving some capital and 
20:1084:57338:13:13:85:513:544:11:Times:11:Times:labor inputs idle. However, in the next period, unutilized products are generated again because 
20:1085:57433:13:12:85:513:531:11:Times:11:Times:the  economy  is not  proceeding  on the Pareto  efficient  saddle  path. Unutilized  products are 
20:1086:57531:12:13:85:513:519:11:Times:11:Times:therefore successively generated  and eliminated.  Faced with these unutilized  products,  firms 
20:1087:57626:13:13:85:513:506:11:Times:11:Times:dispose of the  excess  capital used  to generate the  unutilized  products. Disposing of  the  excess 
20:1088:57728:13:12:85:512:493:11:Times:11:Times:capital is rational for firms because the excess capital is an unnecessary cost, but this means that 
20:1089:57828:12:13:85:513:481:11:Times:11:Times:parts of the firms are liquidated, which takes time and thus disposing of the excess capital will 
20:1090:57922:13:13:85:513:468:11:Times:11:Times:also take time. If the economy proceeds on the NJ path (that is, if all households choose the NJ 
20:1091:58014:13:12:85:513:455:11:Times:11:Times:option),  firms  dispose of all  of  the  remaining  excess  capital that generates bt and adjust  their 
20:1092:58118:12:13:85:513:443:11:Times:11:Times:capital  to  the posterior steady-state  level in  period s, which  also corresponds to  households

21:1202:60548:13:13:85:513:217:11:Times:11:Times:there is a sufficiently large number of households and the effect of an individual household on the 
21:1203:60648:13:12:85:512:204:11:Times:11:Times:whole economy is negligible, in the case of Jalone, the economy almost proceeds on the NJ path. 
21:1204:60743:12:13:85:512:192:11:Times:11:Times:Similarly, in the case of NJalone, it almost proceeds on the J path. If the other households choose 
21:1205:60842:13:16:85:513:179:11:Times:11:Times:the NJ option (Jalone or NJtogether), consumption after s is constant ascand capital is adjusted

21:1207:61035:13:12:85:512:150:11:g_d0_f11:11:Times:θ, because the economy is at the posterior steady state. Nevertheless, during the transition period 
21:1208:61135:12:13:85:512:138:11:Times:11:Times:before s, the  value  of it changes  from  the  value  of the  prior time  preference  rate  to that  of the 
21:1209:61243:13:17:85:513:125:11:Times:11:Times:posterior rate.  If  the  other  households  choose  option J (NJalone or Jtogether),  however,

21:1211:61428:16:0:85:513:92:11:Times:11:Times:  As mentioned in Section A1.2, the difference in the returns on financial assets for the 
22:1212:61518:0:13:85:513:732:11:Times:11:Times:household from the returns for each of the other households is added to (or subtracted from) its 
22:1213:61615:13:13:85:513:719:11:Times:11:Times:consumption in each  period after period s. This  is  described  by at andain equations  (A3) and 
22:1214:61712:13:12:85:513:706:11:Times:11:Times:(A4),  and  equations  (A5)  and  (A6)  indicate  that  the  accumulated  difference  in financial  assets 
22:1215:61819:12:13:85:513:694:11:Times:11:Times:resulting  from bt increases  by  compound  interest  between  the  period r to s.  That  is,  if  the 
22:1216:61919:13:13:85:513:681:11:Times:11:Times:household takes the NJalone path, it accumulates more financial assets than each of the other J 
22:1217:62013:13:12:85:513:668:11:Times:11:Times:households, and instead of immediately consuming these extra accumulated financial assets after 
22:1218:62108:12:13:85:512:656:11:Times:11:Times:period s, the household consumes the returns on them in every subsequent period. If the household 
22:1219:62206:13:14:85:513:643:11:Times:11:Times:takes the Jalone path, however, its consumption after s isac, as shown in equation (A3). a 
22:1220:62295:14:16:85:513:629:11:Times:11:Times:is  subtracted  because  the  income  of  each  household,ttkAfy,,  including  the Jalone 
22:1221:62387:16:12:85:513:613:11:Times:11:Times:household, decreases equally by bt. Each of the other NJ households decreases consumption by bt 
22:1222:62481:12:17:85:512:601:11:Times:11:Times:at the same time, which compensates for the decrease in income; thus, its financial assets (i.e., 
22:1223:62578:17:16:85:513:584:11:Times:11:Times:capital per capita; kt) are kept equal totkˆ. The Jalone household, however, does not decrease its 
22:1224:62676:16:13:85:513:568:11:Times:11:Times:consumption,  and  its  financial  assets  become  smaller  than  those  of  each  of  the  other NJ 
22:1225:62776:13:13:85:375:555:11:Times:11:Times:households, which results in the subtraction of a after period s.

24:1528:67823:22:13:85:513:156:11:Times:11:Times:NJ gives the higher expected utility than that of option J to a household; that is, a household may

24:1531:68131:12:13:85:512:118:11:Times:11:Times:economy. This result is very important because it offers counter-evidence against the conjecture 
24:1532:68228:13:12:85:512:105:11:Times:11:Times:that  households  never  rationally  choose a Pareto  inefficient  transition  path  in  a  frictionless

26:1820:71004:13:13:85:512:525:11:Times:11:Times:A  household  strategically  determines  whether  to  choose  the J or NJ option,  considering  other 
26:1821:71104:13:12:85:513:512:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f8:households’ choices. All households know that each of them forms expectations about the future 
26:1822:71199:12:14:85:513:500:11:Times:11:Times:values of its utility and makes a decision in the same manner. Since all households are identical, 
26:1823:71297:14:15:85:513:486:11:Times:11:Times:the  best  response  of  each  household  is  identical.  Suppose  that  there  are NΗ identical 
26:1824:71396:15:14:85:512:471:11:Times:11:Times:households  in  the  economy  where H is  sufficiently  large  (as  assumed  in  Section  A1).  Let 
26:1825:71495:14:16:98:513:457:10:g_d0_f12:11:Times:10ηηqq be the probability that a household Ηη chooses option J. The average utility 
26:1826:71583:16:13:85:513:441:11:Times:11:Times:of the other households almost equals that of all households because H is sufficiently large. Hence, 
26:1827:71683:13:13:85:512:428:11:Times:11:Times:the  average  expected  utilities  of  the  other  households  that  choose  the J and NJ options  are 
26:1828:71784:13:12:85:512:415:11:Times:11:Times:E0(Jtogether) and E0(NJtogether), respectively. Hence, the payoff matrix of the Η-dimensional 
26:1829:71878:12:13:85:513:403:11:Times:11:Times:symmetric mixed strategy game can be described as shown in Table A1. Each identical household 
26:1830:71972:13:13:85:347:390:11:Times:11:Times:determines its behavior on the basis of this payoff matrix.

26:1835:72140:13:14:85:513:323:11:Times:11:Times:are Nash equilibria for the following reason. By Proposition A1, the best response of household 
26:1836:72236:14:19:85:513:309:11:g_d0_f11:11:Times:η is J (i.e., qη = 1) if *pp, indifferent between J and NJ (i.e., any 10,qη) if *pp, and NJ 
26:1837:72327:19:16:85:513:290:11:Times:11:Times:(i.e., qη = 0) if *pp. Because all households are identical, the best-response correspondence of 
26:1838:72424:16:17:85:513:274:11:Times:11:Times:each household is identical such that qη = 1 if *pp, [0,1] if *pp, and 0 if *pp for any 
26:1839:72512:17:15:85:512:257:11:Times:11:g_d0_f8:household Ηη. Hence, the mixed strategy profiles (1, 1,...,1), (***,...,,ppp), and (0,0,...,0) are 
26:1840:72612:15:12:85:513:242:11:Times:11:Times:the intersections of the graph of the best-response correspondences of all households. The Pareto

27:1870:73923:13:12:85:510:613:11:Times:11:Times:dispersed  than  those of option NJ.  If  households  have a risk-averse  preference  in  the  above-
27:1871:74021:12:13:85:513:601:11:Times:11:Times:mentioned sense and avert the worst scenario when they have no information on its probability, a 
27:1872:74118:13:13:85:513:588:11:Times:11:Times:household will prefer the less dispersed option (NJ), fearing the worst situation that the household 
27:1873:74218:13:12:85:512:575:11:Times:11:Times:alone  substantially  increases  consumption  while  the  other  households  substantially  decrease 
27:1874:74319:12:13:85:513:563:11:Times:11:Times:consumption after the shock. This behavior is rational because it is consistent with preferences. 
27:1875:74417:13:12:85:512:550:11:Times:11:Times:Because all  households  are  identical  and  know  inequality  (A7),  all  households  will  equally

27:1884:75105:13:13:85:512:428:11:Times:11:Times:because  of bt. They are left  unused, discarded,  or preemptively not produced during the  path. 
27:1885:75201:13:12:85:512:415:11:Times:11:Times:Unused or discarded goods and services indicate a decline in sales and an increase in inventory 
27:1886:75294:12:13:85:512:403:11:Times:11:Times:for firms.  Preemptively suspended production results  in an increase in unemployment and idle 
27:1887:75387:13:13:85:513:390:11:Times:11:Times:capital. As  a  result,  profits  decline  and  some  parts  of  firms  need to be liquidated, which is 
27:1888:75489:13:12:85:513:377:11:Times:11:Times:unnecessary if the economy proceeds on the J path (i.e., the posterior Pareto efficient path). If the 
27:1889:75588:12:13:85:513:365:11:Times:11:Times:liquidation is implemented immediately after the shock, unutilized products because of bt will no 
27:1890:75682:13:13:85:513:352:11:Times:11:Times:longer be generated, but such a liquidation would generate a tremendous shock. The process of 
27:1891:75773:13:12:85:513:339:11:Times:11:Times:the liquidation,  however, will  take  time because  of various  frictions, and  excess  capital  that 
27:1892:75873:12:13:85:513:327:11:Times:11:Times:generates unutilized products because of bt will remain for a long period. During the period when 
27:1893:75968:13:13:85:513:314:11:Times:11:Times:capital  is  not  reduced  to  the posterior steady-state  level, unutilized products are  successively 
27:1894:76069:13:12:85:512:301:11:Times:11:Times:generated. In a period, unutilized products are generated and eliminated, but in the next period, 
27:1895:76166:12:13:85:513:289:11:Times:11:Times:another, new, unutilized products are generated and eliminated. This cycle is repeated in every 
27:1896:76259:13:12:85:512:276:11:Times:11:Times:period throughout the transition path, and it implies that demand is lower than supply in every 
27:1897:76353:12:13:85:512:264:11:Times:11:Times:period. This phenomenon may be interpreted as a general glut or a persisting disequilibrium by
