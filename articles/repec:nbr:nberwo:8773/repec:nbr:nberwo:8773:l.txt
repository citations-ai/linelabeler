2:20:773:41:22:108:538:554:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:Evidence on the “funding gap” for R&D is surveyed. The focus is on financial market reasons
2:21:864:22:21:72:538:532:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:for underinvestment in R&D that persist even in the absence of externality-induced underinvestment. The
2:22:967:21:21:72:538:511:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:conclusions are that 1) small and new innovative firms experience high costs of capital that are only partly
2:23:1075:21:21:72:538:490:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:mitigated by the presence of venture capital; 2) evidence for high costs of R&D capital for large firms is
2:24:1181:21:22:72:538:469:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:mixed, although these firms do prefer internal funds for financing these investments; 3) there are limits
2:25:1286:22:21:72:538:447:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:to venture capital as a solution to the funding gap, especially in countries where public equity markets are
2:26:1394:21:21:72:538:426:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:not highly developed; and 4) further study of governmental seed capital and subsidy programs using
2:27:1492:21:120:72:263:405:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:quasi-experimental methods is warranted.

3:39:1923:40:30:72:149:611:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:C:I. Introduction 
3:40:1939:30:27:108:545:581:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:It  is  a  widely  held  view  that  research  and  development  (R&D)  activities  are  difficult  to  
3:41:2043:27:27:72:543:554:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:finance in a freely competitive market place. Support for this view in the form of economic-theoretic 
3:42:2145:27:27:72:544:527:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:modeling  is  not  difficult  to  find  and  probably  begins  with  the  classic  articles  of  Nelson  (1959)  and  
3:43:2263:27:27:72:544:500:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Arrow (1962), although the idea itself was alluded to by Schumpeter (1942).1 The argument goes as 
3:44:2361:27:27:72:544:473:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:follows: the primary output of R&D investment is the knowledge of how to make new goods and 
3:45:2453:27:27:72:544:446:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:services,  and  this  knowledge  is  nonrival:  use  by  one  firm  does  not  preclude  its  use  by  another.  To  
3:46:2570:27:27:72:545:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the  extent  that  knowledge  cannot  be  kept  secret,  the  returns  to  the  investment  in  it  cannot  be  
3:47:2682:27:27:72:544:392:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:appropriated  by  the  firm  undertaking  the  investment,  and  therefore  such  firms  will  be  reluctant  to  
3:48:2796:27:27:72:422:365:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:invest, leading to the underprovision of R&D investment in the economy.  
3:49:2869:27:27:108:545:338:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Since  the  time  when  this  argument  was  fully  articulated  by  Arrow,  it  has  of  course  been  
3:50:2973:27:27:72:546:311:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:developed,  tested,  modified,  and  extended  in  many  ways.  For  example,  Levin  et  al  (1987)  and  
3:51:3080:27:27:72:544:284:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Mansfield et al (1981) found using survey evidence that imitating a new invention was not costless, 
3:52:3180:27:27:72:544:257:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:but  could  cost  as  much  as  fifty  to  seventy-five  per  cent  of  the  cost  of  the  original  invention.  This  
3:53:3300:27:27:72:544:230:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:fact  will  mitigate  but  not  eliminate  the  underinvestment  problem.  Empirical  support  for  the  basic  
3:54:3412:27:27:72:547:203:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:point  concerning  the  positive  externalities  created  by  research  that  was  made  by  Arrow  is  
3:55:3516:27:27:72:544:176:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:widespread, mostly in the form of studies that document a social return to R&D that is higher than 
3:56:3615:27:27:72:545:149:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the  private  level  (Griliches,  1992;  Hall,  1996).  Recently,  a  large  number  of  authors  led  by  Romer  
3:57:3729:27:23:72:547:122:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(1986)  have  produced  models  of  endogenous  macro-economic  growth  that  are  built  on  the  
3:58:3828:23:25:72:222:99:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:                                                  
3:59:3877:25:0:72:391:74:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:F: 1 See, for example, footnote 1, Chapter VIII of Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy.  
4:60:4110:0:27:72:544:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:increasing returns principle implied by Arrow’s argument that one person’s use of knowledge does 
4:61:4207:27:27:72:359:682:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:not diminish its utility to another (Aghion and Howitt, 1997). 
4:62:4270:27:27:108:544:655:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:This line of reasoning is already widely used by policymakers to justify such interventions as 
4:63:4365:27:27:72:547:628:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the  intellectual  property  system,  government  support  of  R&D,  R&D  tax  incentives,  and  the  
4:64:4467:27:27:72:544:601:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:encouragement  of  research  partnerships  of  various  kinds.  In  general,  these  incentive  programs  can  
4:65:4578:27:27:72:543:574:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:be warranted even when the firm or individual undertaking the research is the same as the entity that 
4:66:4680:27:27:72:543:547:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:finances it. However, Arrow’s influential paper also contains another argument, again one which was 
4:67:4780:27:27:72:548:520:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:foreshadowed   by   Schumpeter   and   which   has   been   addressed   by   subsequent   researchers   in   
4:68:4889:27:27:72:543:493:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:economics and finance: the argument that an additional gap exists between the private rate of return 
4:69:4990:27:27:72:482:466:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and the cost of capital when the innovation investor and financier are different entities.  
4:70:5082:27:27:108:543:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:This paper concerns itself with this second aspect of the market failure for R&D investment: 
4:71:5175:27:27:72:544:412:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:even if problems associated with incomplete appropriability of the returns to R&D are solved using 
4:72:5274:27:27:72:546:385:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:intellectual  property  protection,  subsidies,  or  tax  incentives,  it  may  still  be  difficult  or  costly  to  
4:73:5392:27:27:72:543:358:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:finance R&D using capital from sources external to the firm or entrepreneur. That is, there is often a 
4:74:5495:27:27:72:544:331:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:wedge,  sometimes  large,  between  the  rate  of  return  required  by  an  entrepreneur  investing  his  own  
4:75:5607:27:27:72:546:304:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:funds  and  that  required  by  external  investors.  By  this  argument,  unless  an  inventor  is  already  
4:76:5717:27:27:72:545:277:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:wealthy,  or  firms  already  profitable,  some  innovations  will  fail  to  be  provided  purely  because  the  
4:77:5831:27:27:72:544:250:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cost  of  external  capital  is  too  high,  even  when  they  would  pass  the  private  returns  hurdle  if  funds  
4:78:5949:27:27:72:269:223:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:were available at a “normal” interest rate.  
4:79:5994:27:27:108:545:196:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:In  the  following,  I  begin  by  describing  some  of  the  unique  features  of  R&D  investment.  
4:80:6096:27:27:72:545:169:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Then  I  discuss  the  various  theoretical  arguments  why  external  finance  for  R&D  might  be  more  
4:81:6203:27:27:72:545:142:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:expensive  that  internal  finance,  going  on  to  review  the  empirical  evidence  on  the  validity  of  this  
4:82:6318:27:27:72:546:115:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:hypothesis  and  the  solutions  that  have  been  developed  and  adopted  by  the  market  and  some  
4:83:6422:27:0:72:408:88:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:governments. The paper concludes with a discussion of policy options.  
5:84:6640:0:30:72:300:708:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:C:II. Research and development as investment 
5:85:6683:30:27:108:544:678:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:From the perspective of investment theory, R&D has a number of characteristics that make 
5:86:6772:27:27:72:544:651:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:it different from ordinary investment. First and most importantly, in practice fifty per cent or more 
5:87:6874:27:27:72:543:624:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of R&D spending is the wages and salaries of highly educated scientists and engineers. Their efforts 
5:88:6975:27:27:72:545:597:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:create  an  intangible  asset,  the  firm’s  knowledge  base,  from  which  profits  in  future  years  will  be  
5:89:7089:27:27:72:544:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:generated.  To  the  extent  that  this  knowledge  is  “tacit”  rather  than  codified,  it  is  embedded  in  the  
5:90:7206:27:27:72:469:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:human capital of the firm’s employees, and is therefore lost if they leave or are fired.  
5:91:7296:27:27:108:543:516:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:This fact has an important implication for the conduct of R&D investment. Because part of 
5:92:7386:27:27:72:544:489:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the  resource  base  of  the  firm  itself  disappears  when  such  workers  leave  or  are  fired,  firms  tend  to  
5:93:7504:27:27:72:543:462:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:smooth their R&D spending over time, in order to avoid having to lay off knowledge workers. This 
5:94:7601:27:27:72:543:435:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:implies that R&D spending at the firm level typically behaves as though it has high adjustment costs 
5:95:7702:27:27:72:544:408:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(Hall,  Griliches,  and  Hausman,  1986;  Lach  and  Schankerman,  1988),  with  two  consequences,  one  
5:96:7808:27:27:72:544:381:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:substantive  and  one  that  affects  empirical  work  in  this  area.  First,  the  equilibrium  required  rate  of  
5:97:7926:27:27:72:544:354:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:return to R&D may be quite high simply to cover the adjustment costs. Second, and related to the 
5:98:8023:27:27:72:544:327:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:first, is that it will be difficult to measure the impact of changes in the costs of capital, because such 
5:99:8130:27:27:72:541:300:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:effects can be weak in the short run due to the sluggish response of R&D to any changes in its cost.  
5:100:8232:27:27:108:544:273:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:A second important feature of R&D investment is the degree of uncertainty associated with 
5:101:8322:27:27:72:544:246:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:its  output.  This  uncertainty  tends  to  be  greatest  at  the  beginning  of  a  research  program  or  project,  
5:102:8440:27:27:72:544:219:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:which implies that an optimal R&D strategy has an options-like character and should not really be

5:104:8639:27:27:72:544:165:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:may  be  worth  continuing  even  if  they  do  not  pass  an  expected  rate  of  return  test.  The  uncertainty  
5:105:8755:27:27:72:546:138:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:here  can  be  extreme  and  not  a  simple  matter  of  a  well-specified  distribution  with  a  mean  and  
5:106:8865:27:0:72:545:111:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:variance.  There  is  evidence,  such  as  that  in  Scherer  (1998),  that  the  distribution  of  profits  from  
6:107:9127:0:27:72:544:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:innovation  sometimes  has  a  Paretian  character  where  the  variance  does  not  exist.  When  this  is  the  
6:108:9241:27:27:72:350:682:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:case, standard risk-adjustment methods will not work well.

6:129:10184:27:27:72:544:339:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:economies, R&D is expensed as it is incurred rather than capitalized and depreciated, which means 
6:130:10282:27:27:72:544:312:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that the lifetime of the investment for accounting purposes is much shorter than the economic life

7:141:11242:27:27:108:543:655:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:1. tax treatment such as tax credits, which are clearly amenable to intervention by policy 
7:142:11333:27:27:108:147:628:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:makers. 
7:143:11341:27:27:108:546:601:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:2.         economic         depreciation         δ,  which  in  the  case  of  R&D  is  more  properly  termed  
7:144:11453:27:27:108:543:574:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:obsolesence. This quantity is sensitive to the realized rate of technical change in the industry, 
7:145:11551:27:27:108:545:547:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:which  is  in  turn  determined  by  such  things  as  market  structure  and  the  rate  of  imitation.  
7:146:11657:27:27:108:425:520:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Thus it is difficult to treat δ as an invariant parameter in this setting.

7:148:11797:27:27:108:325:466:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:4. the investor’s required rate of return r. 
7:149:11842:27:27:108:544:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The last item has been the subject of considerable theoretical and empirical interest, on the

7:151:12041:27:27:72:543:385:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:investigation can be observed: one focuses on the role of asymmetric information and moral hazard 
7:152:12139:27:27:72:544:358:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in raising the required rate of return abve that normally used for conventional investment, and the 
7:153:12239:27:27:72:543:331:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:latter on the requirements of different sources of financing and their differing tax treatments for the 
7:154:12343:27:40:72:392:304:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:rate of return. The next section of the paper discusses these factors.  
7:155:12415:40:30:72:217:264:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:C:III. Theoretical background 
7:156:12443:30:27:108:544:234:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:This section of the paper reviews the reasons that the impact of financial considerations on 
7:157:12536:27:27:72:544:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the investment decision may vary with the type of investment and with the source of funds in more 
7:158:12634:27:27:72:543:180:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:detail. To do this, I distinguish between those factors that arise from various kinds of market failures 
7:159:12739:27:27:72:546:153:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in  this  setting  and  the  purely  financial  (or  tax-oriented)  considerations  that  affect  the  cost  of  
7:160:12852:27:0:72:198:126:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:different sources of funds. 
8:161:13027:0:27:108:544:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:One of the implications of the well-known Modigliani-Miller theorem (1958, 1961) is that a 
8:162:13118:27:27:72:545:682:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:firm  choosing  the  optimal  levels  of  investment  should  be  indifferent  to  its  capital  structure,  and  
8:163:13232:27:27:72:543:655:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:should face the same price for investment and R&D investment on the margin. The last dollar spent 
8:164:13330:27:27:72:545:628:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:on  each  type  of  investment  should  yield  the  same  expected  rate  of  return  (after  adjustment  for  
8:165:13441:27:27:72:543:601:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:nondiversifiable risk). A large literature, both theoretical and empirical, has questioned the bases for 
8:166:13546:27:27:72:313:574:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:this theorem, but it remains a useful starting point.  
8:167:13601:27:27:108:545:547:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Reasons  why  the  theorem  might  fail  in  practice  are  several:  1)  uncertainty  coupled  with  
8:168:13703:27:27:72:546:520:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:incomplete  markets  may  make  a  real  options  approach  to  the  R&D  investment  decision  more  
8:169:13805:27:27:72:544:493:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:appropriate; 2) the cost of capital may differ by source of funds for non-tax reasons; 3) the cost of 
8:170:13907:27:27:72:543:466:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:capital may differ by source of funds for tax reasons; and 4) the cost of capital may also differ across 
8:171:14012:27:27:72:432:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:types of investments (tangible and intangible) for both tax and other reasons. 
8:172:14091:27:27:108:543:412:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:With respect to R&D investment, economic theory advances a plethora of reasons why there 
8:173:14180:27:27:72:544:385:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:might be a gap between the external and internal costs capital; these can be divided into three main 
8:174:14281:27:27:72:102:358:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:types: 
8:175:14288:27:27:90:373:331:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:1.   Asymmetric information between inventor and investor. 
8:176:14347:27:27:90:544:304:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:2.    Moral  hazard  on  the  part  of  the  inventor  or  arising  from  the  separation  of  ownership  and  
8:177:14458:27:27:90:155:277:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:management. 
8:178:14470:27:27:90:545:250:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:3.    Tax  considerations  that  drive  a  wedge  between  external  finance  and  finance  by  retained

8:180:14586:39:30:72:236:184:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:C:Asymmetric information problems 
8:181:14618:30:27:108:544:154:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:In the R&D setting, the asymmetric information problem refers to the fact that an inventor 
8:182:14709:27:27:72:543:127:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:frequently has better information about the likelihood of success and the nature of the contemplated 
8:183:14810:27:0:72:549:100:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:innovation   project   than   potential   investors.   Therefore,   the   marketplace   for   financing   the   
9:184:15069:0:27:72:544:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:development  of  innovative  ideas  looks  like  the  “lemons”  market  modeled  by  Akerlof  (1970).  The  
9:185:15177:27:27:72:544:682:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:lemons' premium for R&D will be higher than that for ordinary investment because investors have 
9:186:15273:27:27:72:546:655:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:more  difficulty  distinguishing  good  projects  from  bad  when  the  projects  are  long-term  R&D  
9:187:15376:27:27:72:543:628:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:investments than when they are more short-term or low-risk projects (Leland and Pyle, 1977). When 
9:188:15474:27:27:72:543:601:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the level of R&D expenditure is a highly observable signal, as it is under current U.S. and U.K. rules, 
9:189:15578:27:27:72:519:574:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:we might expect that the lemons' problem is somewhat mitigated, but certainly not eliminated.3  
9:190:15674:27:27:108:546:547:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:In  the  most  extreme  version  of  the  lemons  model,  the  market  for  R&D  projects  may  
9:191:15770:27:27:72:544:520:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:disappear  entirely  if  the  asymmetric  information  problem  is  too  great.  Informal  evidence  suggests  
9:192:15881:27:27:72:544:493:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that  some  potential  innovators  believe  this  to  be  the  case  in  fact.  And  as  will  be  discussed  below,  
9:193:15999:27:27:72:506:466:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:venture capital systems are viewed by some as a solution to this “missing markets” problem.  
9:194:16092:27:27:108:543:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Reducing information asymmetry via fuller disclosure is of limited effectiveness in this arena, 
9:195:16188:27:27:72:543:412:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:due to the ease of imitation of inventive ideas. Firms are reluctant to reveal their innovative ideas to 
9:196:16293:27:27:72:544:385:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the marketplace and the fact that there could be a substantial cost to revealing information to their 
9:197:16395:27:27:72:544:358:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:competitors reduces the quality of the signal they can make about a potential project (Bhattacharya 
9:198:16495:27:27:72:544:331:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and  Ritter,  1983;  Anton  and  Yao,  1998).  Thus  the  implication  of  asymmetric  information  coupled  
9:199:16604:27:27:72:544:304:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with  the  costliness  of  mitigating  the  problem  is  that  firms  and  inventors  will  face  a  higher  cost  of  
9:200:16723:27:27:72:389:277:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:external than internal capital for R&D due to the lemons’ premium. 
9:201:16790:27:27:108:544:250:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Some empirical support for this proposition exists, mostly in the form of event studies that 
9:202:16883:27:27:72:543:223:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:measure the market response to announcements of new debt or share issues. Both Alam and Walton 
9:203:16978:27:27:72:544:196:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(1995)  and  Zantout  (1997)  find  higher  abnormal  returns  to  firm  shares  following  new  debt  issues

9:206:17246:26:11:72:543:119:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:F: 3  Since  1974,  publicly  traded  firms  in  the  United  States  have  been  required  to  report  their  total  R&D  expenditures  in  
9:207:17384:11:11:72:544:108:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:F:their  annual  reports  and  10-K  filings  with  the  SEC,  under  FASB  rule  No.  2,  issued  October  1974.  In  1989,  a  new

9:209:17646:12:11:72:543:85:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:F:have  such  a  requirement,  although  they  may  evolve  in  that  direction  due  to  international  harmonization  of  accounting  
9:210:17780:11:0:72:244:74:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:F:standards, at least for publicly traded firms.  
10:211:17975:0:27:72:544:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:financing is good news when the firm has an asymmetric information problem because of its R&D 
10:212:18069:27:27:72:544:682:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:strategy.  Similary,  Szewcxyk,  Tsetsekos,  and  Zantout  (1996)  find  that  investment  opportunities  (as  
10:213:18180:27:27:72:544:655:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:proxied  by  Tobin’s  q)  explain  R&D-associated  abnormal  returns,  and  that  these  returns  are  higher  
10:214:18291:27:27:72:545:628:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:when  the  firm  is  highly  leveraged,  implying  a  higher  required  rate  of  return  for  debt  finance  in

10:217:18441:30:27:108:545:532:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Moral  hazard  in  R&D  investing  arises  in  the  usual  way:  modern  industrial  firms  normally  
10:218:18543:27:27:72:544:505:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:have  separation  of  ownership  and  management.  This  leads  to  a  principal-agent  problem  when  the  
10:219:18651:27:27:72:547:478:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:goals  of  the  two  conflict,  which  can  result  in  investment  strategies  that  are  not  share  value  
10:220:18761:27:27:72:544:451:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:maximizing.  Two  possible  scenarios  may  co-exist:  one  is  the  usual  tendency  of  managers  to  spend  
10:221:18872:27:27:72:544:424:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:on  activities  that  benefit  them  (growing  the  firm  beyond  efficient  scale,  nicer  offices,  etc.)  and  the  
10:222:18991:27:27:72:543:397:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:second is a reluctance of risk averse managers to invest in uncertain R&D projects. Agency costs of 
10:223:19091:27:27:72:543:370:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the first type may be avoided by reducing the amount of free cash flow available to the managers by 
10:224:19191:27:27:72:545:343:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:leveraging  the  firm,  but  this  in  turn  forces  them  to  use  the  higher  cost  external  funds  to  finance  
10:225:19308:27:27:72:544:316:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:R&D (Jensen and Meckling, 1976). Empirically, there seem to be limits to the use of the leveraging 
10:226:19407:27:27:72:545:289:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:strategy  in  R&D-intensive  sectors.  See  Hall  (1990,  1994)  for  evidence  that  the  LBO/restructuring  
10:227:19517:27:27:72:545:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:wave  of  the  1980s  was  almost  entirely  confined  to  industries  and  firms  where  R&D  was  of  no  
10:228:19625:27:27:72:140:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:consequence.  
10:229:19639:27:27:108:543:208:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:According to the second type of principal-agent conflict, managers are more risk averse than 
10:230:19732:27:27:72:544:181:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:shareholders and avoid R&D projects that will increase the riskiness of the firm. If bankruptcy is a 
10:231:19833:27:27:72:545:154:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:possibility,  managers  whose  opportunity  cost  is  lower  than  their  present  earnings  and  potential  
10:232:19942:27:27:72:544:127:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:bondholders may both wish to avoid variance-increasing projects which shareholders would like to 
10:233:20039:27:0:72:545:100:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:undertake.  The  argument  of  the  theory  is  that  long-term  investments  can  suffer  in  this  case.  The  
11:234:20300:0:27:72:544:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:optimal solution to this type of agency cost would be to increase the long-term incentives faced by 
11:235:20400:27:27:72:300:682:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the manager rather than reducing free cash flow. 
11:236:20449:27:27:108:545:655:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Evidence  on  the  importance  of  agency  costs  as  they  relate  to  R&D  takes  several  forms.  
11:237:20550:27:27:72:544:628:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Several  researchers  have  studied  the  impact  of  antitakeover  amendments  (which  arguably  increase  
11:238:20658:27:27:72:544:601:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:managerial  security  and  willingness  to  take  on  risk  while  reducing  managerial  discipline)  on  R&D  
11:239:20769:27:27:72:543:574:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:investment and firm value. Johnston and Rao (1997) find that such amendments are not followed by 
11:240:20866:27:27:72:545:547:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cuts  in  R&D,  while  Pugh,  Jahara,  and  Oswald  (1999)  find  that  adoption  of  an  Employee  Stock  
11:241:20973:27:27:72:543:520:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Ownership Plan (ESOP), which is a form of antitakeover protection, is followed by R&D increases. 
11:242:21070:27:27:72:547:493:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Cho  (1992)  finds  that  R&D  intensity  increases  with  the  share  that  managerial  shareholdings  
11:243:21174:27:27:72:544:466:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:represent  of  the  manager’s  wealth  and  interprets  this  as  incentive  pay  mitigating  agency  costs  and  
11:244:21288:27:27:72:223:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:inducing long term investment.  
11:245:21320:27:27:108:544:412:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Some have argued that institutional ownership of the managerial firm can reduce the agency 
11:246:21411:27:27:72:546:385:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:costs  due  to  free-riding  by  owners  that  is  a  feature  of  the  governance  of  firms  with  diffuse  
11:247:21521:27:27:72:544:358:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:ownership  structure,  while  others  have  held  that  such  ownership  pays  too  much  attention  to  short  
11:248:21633:27:27:72:545:331:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:term  earnings  and  therefore  discourages  long  term  investments.  Institutions  such  as  mutual  and  
11:249:21741:27:27:72:544:304:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:pension funds often control somewhat larger blocks of shares than individuals, making monitoring 
11:250:21838:27:27:72:527:277:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:firm and manager behavior a more effective and more rewarding activity for these organizations.  
11:251:21935:27:27:108:544:250:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:There  is  some  limited  evidence  that  this  may  indeed  be  the  case.  Eng  and  Shackell  (2001)  
11:252:22040:27:27:72:543:223:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:find that firms adopting long term performance plans for their managers do not increase their R&D 
11:253:22138:27:27:72:543:196:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:spending but that institutional ownership is associated with higher R&D; R&D firms tend not to be 
11:254:22236:27:27:72:543:169:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:held by banks and insurance companies. Majumdar and Nagarajan (1997) find that high institutional 
11:255:22334:27:27:72:543:142:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:investor ownership does not lead to short-term behavior on the part of the firm, in particular, it does 
11:256:22438:27:27:72:544:115:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:not  lead  to  cuts  in  R&D  spending.  Francis  and  Smith  (1995)  find  that  diffusely  held  firms  are  less  
11:257:22555:27:0:72:533:88:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:innovative, implying that monitoring alleviates agency costs and enables investment in innovation.  
12:258:22803:0:27:108:547:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Although  the  evidence  summarized  above  is  fairly  clear  and  indicates  that  long  term  
12:259:22900:27:27:72:544:682:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:incentives  for  managers  can  encourage  R&D  and  that  institutional  ownership  does  not  necessarily

12:261:23109:27:27:72:545:628:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:governance  features  truly  close  the  agency  cost-induced  gap  between  the  cost  of  capital  and  the  
12:262:23220:27:39:72:150:601:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:return to R&D.

12:264:23262:30:27:108:543:532:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:In the view of some observers, the leveraged buyout (LBO) wave of the 1980s in the United 
12:265:23352:27:27:72:544:505:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:States  and  the  United  Kingdom  arose  partly  because  high  real  interest  rates  meant  that  there  were  
12:266:23466:27:27:72:546:478:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:strong  pressures  to  eliminate  free  cash  flow  within  firms  (Blair  and  Litan,  1990).  For  firms  in  
12:267:23578:27:27:72:543:451:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:industries where R&D is an important form of investment, such pressure should have been reduced 
12:268:23674:27:27:72:543:424:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:by the need for internal funds to undertake such investment and indeed Hall (1993, 1994) and Opler 
12:269:23773:27:27:72:545:397:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and  Titman  (1993)  find  that  firms  with  high  R&D  intensity  were  much  less  likely  to  do  an  LBO.  
12:270:23885:27:27:72:544:370:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Opler and Titman (1994) find that R&D firms that were leveraged suffered more than other firms 
12:271:23980:27:27:72:544:343:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:when facing economic distress, presumably because leverage meant that they were unable to sustain 
12:272:24078:27:27:72:303:316:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:R&D programs in the fact of reduced cash flow.  
12:273:24126:27:27:108:540:289:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:In  related  work  using  data  on  Israeli  firms,  Blass  and  Yosha  (2001)  report  that  R&D-
12:274:24224:27:27:72:546:262:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:intensive  firms  listed  on  the  United  States  stock  exchanges  use  highly  equity-based  sources  of  
12:275:24333:27:27:72:544:235:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:financing, whereas those listed only in Israel rely more on bank financing and government funding. 
12:276:24432:27:27:72:544:208:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The former are more profitable and faster-growing, which suggests that the choice of where to list 
12:277:24531:27:27:72:544:181:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the shares and whether to finance with new equity is indeed sensitive to the expected rate of return 
12:278:24632:27:27:72:546:154:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to  the  R&D  being  undertaken.  That  is,  investors  supplying  arms-length  finance  require  higher  
12:279:24738:27:0:72:327:127:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:returns to compensate them for the risk of a “lemon.” 
13:280:24940:0:27:108:544:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Although leverage may be a useful tool for reducing agency costs in the firm, it is of limited 
13:281:25035:27:27:72:547:682:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:value  for  R&D-intensive  firms.  Because  the  knowledge  asset  created  by  R&D  investment  is  
13:282:25136:27:27:72:543:655:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:intangible, partly embedded in human capital, and ordinarily very specialized to the particular firm in 
13:283:25240:27:27:72:544:628:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:which it resides, the capital structure of R&D-intensive firms customarily exhibits considerably less 
13:284:25342:27:27:72:543:601:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:leverage than that of other firms. Banks and other debtholders prefer to use physical assets to secure 
13:285:25445:27:27:72:544:574:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:loans  and  are  reluctant  to  lend  when  the  project  involves  substantial  R&D  investment  rather  than  
13:286:25557:27:27:72:544:547:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:investment in plant and equipment. In the words of Williamson (1988), “redeployable” assets (that 
13:287:25655:27:27:72:543:520:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is, assets whose value in an alternative use is almost as high as in their current use) are more suited to 
13:288:25762:27:27:72:546:493:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the  governance  structures  associated  with  debt.  Empirical  support  for  this  idea  is  provided  by  
13:289:25871:27:27:72:544:466:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Alderson  and  Betker  (1996),  who  find  that  liquidation  costs  and  R&D  are  positively  related  across  
13:290:25984:27:27:72:544:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:firms.  The  implication  is  that  the  sunk  costs  associated  with  R&D  investment  are  higher  than  that  
13:291:26098:27:27:72:188:412:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for ordinary investment. 
13:292:26123:27:27:108:543:385:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:In addition, servicing debt usually requires a stable source of cash flow, which makes it more 
13:293:26218:27:27:72:544:358:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:difficult to find the funds for an R&D investment program that must be sustained at a certain level 
13:294:26318:27:27:72:544:331:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in  order  to  be  productive.  For  both  these  reasons,  firms  are  either  unable  or  reluctant  to  use  debt  
13:295:26436:27:27:72:545:304:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:finance  for  R&D  investment,  which  may  raise  the  cost  of  capital,  depending  on  the  precise  tax

14:335:29524:12:11:72:543:85:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:F:will hold. Only in the case where dividends are not taxed at the corporate level (which was formerly the case in the UK) 
14:336:29645:11:0:72:223:74:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:F:will the ranking given above not hold.  
15:337:29833:0:27:108:544:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:It  is  also  true  that  the  tax  treatment  of  R&D  in  most  OECD  economies  is  very  different  
15:338:29937:27:27:72:544:682:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:from that of other kinds of investment: because R&D is expensed as it is incurred, the effective tax 
15:339:30038:27:27:72:544:655:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:rate  on  R&D  assets  is  lower  than  that  on  either  plant  or  equipment,  with  or  without  an  R&D  tax  
15:340:30152:27:27:72:543:628:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:credit in place. This effectively means that the economic depreciation of R&D assets is considerably 
15:341:30253:27:27:72:544:601:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:less  than  the  depreciation  allowed  for  tax  purposes  --  which  is  100  percent  --  so  that  the  required  
15:342:30371:27:27:72:544:574:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:rate of return for such investment would be lower. In addition some countries offer a tax credit or 
15:343:30471:27:27:72:478:547:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:subsidy to R&D spending, which can reduce the after tax cost of capital even further.6  
15:344:30559:27:27:108:545:520:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The  conclusion  from  this  section  of  the  paper  is  that  the  presence  of  either  asymmetric  
15:345:30662:27:27:72:545:493:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:information  or  a  principal-agent  conflict  imply  that  new  debt  or  equity  finance  will  be  relatively  
15:346:30776:27:27:72:545:466:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:more  expensive  for  R&D  than  for  ordinary  investment,  and  that  considerations  such  as  lack  of

15:348:30993:27:27:72:543:412:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:important role for retained earnings in the R&D investment decision, independent of their value as a

15:350:31210:27:27:72:544:358:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Petersen  (1994),  there  is  good  reason  to  think  that  positive  cash  flow  may  be  more  important  for  
15:351:31324:27:27:72:544:331:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:R&D  than  for  ordinary  investment.  The  next  section  reports  on  a  series  of  empirical  tests  for  this

15:358:31902:27:27:72:546:126:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:extensive  literature  developed  for  testing  ordinary  investment  equations  for  liquidity  constraints

16:362:32354:27:27:72:543:682:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:difficulties as the estimates in the investment literature, plus one additional problem that arises from 
16:363:32459:27:27:72:352:655:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the tendency of firms to smooth R&D spending over time.  
16:364:32516:27:27:108:544:628:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The  ideal  experiment  for  identifying  the  effects  of  liquidity  constraints  on  investment  is  to  
16:365:32624:27:27:72:543:601:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:give firms additional cash exogenously, and observe whether they pass it on to shareholders or use it 
16:366:32726:27:27:72:543:574:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for investment and/or R&D. If they choose the first alternative, either the cost of capital to the firm 
16:367:32830:27:27:72:544:547:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:has not fallen, or it has fallen but they still have no good investment opportunities. If they choose 
16:368:32932:27:27:72:544:520:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the second, then the firm must have had some unexploited investment opportunities that were not 
16:369:33028:27:27:72:545:493:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:profitable  using  more  costly  external  finance.  A  finding  that  investment  is  sensitive  to  cash  flow  
16:370:33142:27:27:72:544:466:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:shocks  that  are  not  signals  of  future  demand  increases  would  reject  the  hypothesis  that  the  cost  of  
16:371:33259:27:27:72:544:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:external  funds  is  the  same  as  the  cost  of  internal  funds.  However,  lack  of  true  experiments  of  this  
16:372:33377:27:27:72:544:412:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:kind  forces  researchers  to  use  econometric  techniques  such  as  instrumental  variables  to  attempt  to

16:378:33899:27:27:72:545:250:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:funds.  Internal  funds  are  available  at  a  constant  cost  of  capital  until  they  are  exhausted,  at  which  
16:379:34017:27:27:72:544:223:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:point  it  becomes  necessary  to  issue  debt  or  equity  in  order  to  finance  more  investment.  When  the  
16:380:34131:27:27:72:544:196:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:demand curve cuts the supply curve in the horizontal portion, a shock that increases cash flow (and 
16:381:34231:27:27:72:544:169:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:shifts supply outward) has no effect on the level of investment. However, if the demand curve cuts 
16:382:34330:27:27:72:543:142:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the supply curve where it is upward sloping, it is possible for a shock to cash flow to shift the supply 
16:383:34435:27:0:72:544:115:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:curve out in such a way as to induce a substantial increase in R&D investment. Figure 2 illustrates 
17:384:34683:0:27:72:544:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:such  a  case,  where  the  firm  shifts  from  point  A  to  point  B  in  response  to  a  cash  flow  shock  that

17:394:35470:27:27:72:545:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Assuming  that  the  production  function  for  the  ith  firm  at  time  t  is  Cobb-Douglas  and  taking  
17:395:35578:27:27:72:243:412:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:logarithms of this relationship yields 
17:396:35617:27:27:289:361:385:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:kit = sit + ai – cit 
17:397:35637:27:27:72:544:358:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:where k  =  log(R&D  capital),  s  =  log(output  or  sales),  and  c  =  log(cost  of  R&D).  ai  captures  any  
17:398:35751:27:27:72:473:331:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:permanent differences across firms, including differences in the production function.  
17:399:35838:27:27:108:544:304:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Lagged  adjustment  is  allowed  for  by  specifying  an  autoregressive  distributed  lag  (ADL)  for  
17:400:35942:27:27:72:544:277:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the relationship between capital and sales. For example, specifying an ADL(2,2) and approximating 
17:401:36040:27:27:72:378:250:144:g_d0_f10:144:g_d0_f3:B:Δk by R/K-δ yields an estimating equation of the following form: 
17:402:36105:27:27:166:484:223:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:R/K = f(R(-1)/K(-1), Δs, Δs(-1), k(-2)-s(-2), time dummies, firm dummies) 
17:403:36179:27:27:72:544:196:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The  time  dummies  capture  the  conventional  cost  of  capital,  assumed  to  be  the  same  for  all  firms.  
17:404:36293:27:27:72:543:169:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Firm-specific costs related to financing constraints are included by adding current and lagged values 
17:405:36395:27:31:72:544:142:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of the cash flow/capital ratio to this equation. Because of the presence of firm dummies, estimation 
17:406:36496:31:26:72:222:111:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:                                                  
17:407:36545:26:11:72:543:85:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:F: 7  A  detailed  consideration  of  the  econometric  estimation  of  these  models  can  be  found  in  Mairesse,  Hall,  and  Mulkay  
17:408:36680:11:0:72:182:74:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:F:(1999). See also Hall (1981). 
18:409:36858:0:27:72:544:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is done using first differences of this equation, instrumented by lagged values of the right hand side 
18:410:36961:27:27:72:544:682:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:variables to correct for the potential endogeneity of the contemporaneous values. In principle, this 
18:411:37062:27:27:72:516:655:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:will also control for the potential simultaneity between current investment and the disturbance. 
18:412:37159:27:27:108:544:628:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The Euler equation approach begins with the following first order condition for investment 
18:413:37250:27:27:72:186:601:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in two adjacent periods: 
18:414:37275:27:27:182:468:574:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f3:A:Et-1 [MPKt + (1-δ)(pt+MACt) – (1+r)(αt-1/αt) (pt-1+MACt-1)] = 0 
18:415:37338:27:27:72:545:547:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:where MAC  denotes  the  marginal  adjustment  costs  for  capital  and  αt  is  the  shadow  value  of  
18:416:37443:27:27:72:546:520:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:investment  funds  in  period  t,  which  will  be  unity  if  there  are  no  financing  constraints.  After  
18:417:37554:27:27:72:546:493:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:specifying  a  Cobb-Douglas  production  function  and  quadratic  adjustment  costs,  we  obtain  the  
18:418:37658:27:27:72:215:466:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:following estimating equation: 
18:419:37689:27:27:185:465:439:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:R/K = f(R(-1)/K(-1), S/K, (R/K)2, time dummies, firm dummies) 
18:420:37751:27:27:72:544:412:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Like  the  accelerator  model,  this  equation  also  should  be  estimated  in  differenced  from  with  lagged  
18:421:37865:27:27:72:325:385:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:values of the right hand side variables as instruments.  
18:422:37922:27:27:108:545:358:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:When  financial  constraints  are  present,  the  coefficient  of  lagged  R&D  investment  in  the  
18:423:38023:27:27:72:543:331:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Euler equation differs from (1+r) by the term (αt-1/αt). The implication is that when the firm changes 
18:424:38126:27:27:72:544:304:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:its financial position (that is, the shadow value of additional funds for investment changes) between 
18:425:38228:27:27:72:543:277:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:one period and the next, it will invest as though it is facing a cost of capital greater than r (when the 
18:426:38334:27:27:72:544:250:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:shadow  value  falls  between  periods)  or  less  than  r  (when  the  shadow  value  rises  between  periods).  
18:427:38448:27:27:72:543:223:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Clearly this is a very difficult test to perform because (αt-1/αt) is not constant across firms or across 
18:428:38554:27:27:72:318:196:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:time periods, so it cannot be treated as a parameter.  
18:429:38609:27:27:108:545:169:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Three  solutions  are  possible:  the  first  is  to  model  (αt-1/αt)  as  a  function  of  proxies  for  
18:430:38716:27:27:72:544:142:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:changes in financial position, such as dividend behavior, new share issues, or new debt issues. The 
18:431:38816:27:27:72:543:115:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:second  is  more  ad  hoc:  recall  that  this  term  also  multiplies  the  price  pt  of  R&D  capital  to  create  a  
18:432:38937:27:0:72:545:88:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:firm-specific  cost  of  capital.  Most  researchers  simply  include  the  cash  flow  to  capital  ratio  in  the  
19:433:39202:0:27:72:543:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:model to proxy for the firm-specific cost of capital and test whether it enters in the presence of time 
19:434:39306:27:27:72:544:682:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:dummies  that  are  the  same  for  all  firms.  This  method  assumes  that  all  firms  face  the  same  R&D  
19:435:39418:27:27:72:325:655:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:price (cost of capital), except for the cash flow effect.  
19:436:39477:27:27:108:545:628:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The  third  possibility  is  to  stratify  firms  in  some  way  that  is  related  to  the  level  of  cash  
19:437:39587:27:27:72:545:601:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:constraints  that  they  face  (for  example,  dividend-paying  and  non-dividend  paying  firms)  estimate  
19:438:39696:27:27:72:544:574:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:separate investment equations for each group, and test whether the coefficients are equal. This last 
19:439:39797:27:27:72:545:547:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:was  the  method  used  by  Fazzari,  Hubbard,  and  Petersen  (1988)  in  the  paper  that  originated  this  
19:440:39908:27:27:72:544:520:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:literature. Note that this approach does not rely on the full Euler equation derivation given above, 
19:441:40009:27:27:72:477:493:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:but uses a version of the neoclassical accelerator model (the first model given above).   
19:442:40099:27:27:108:543:466:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:During the past few years, various versions of the methodologies described above have been 
19:443:40190:27:27:72:544:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:applied  to  data  on  the  R&D  investment  of  U.S.,  U.K.,  French,  German,  Irish,  and  Japanese  firms.  
19:444:40302:27:27:72:546:412:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The  firms  examined  are  typically  the  largest  and  most  important  manufactuing  firms  in  their  
19:445:40408:27:27:72:544:385:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:economy.  For  example,  Hall  (1992)  found  a  large  positive  elasticity  between  R&D  and  cash  flow,  
19:446:40518:27:27:72:543:358:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:using an accelerator-type model and a very large sample of U.S. manufacturing firms. The estimation 
19:447:40618:27:27:72:543:331:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:methodology here controlled for both firm effects and simultaneity. Similarly and using some of the 
19:448:40718:27:27:72:544:304:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:same data, Himmelberg and Petersen (1994) looked at a panel of 179 U.S. small firms in high-tech 
19:449:40815:27:27:72:545:277:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:industries  and  find  an  economically  large  and  statistically  significant  relationship  between  R&D  
19:450:40924:27:27:72:233:250:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:investment and internal finance.    
19:451:40960:27:27:108:544:223:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Harhoff  (1998)  found  weak  but  significant  cash  flow  effects  on  R&D  for  both  small  and  
19:452:41061:27:27:72:543:196:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:large German firms, although Euler equation estimates for R&D investment were uninformative due 
19:453:41157:27:27:72:544:169:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to the smoothness of R&D and the small sample size. Combining limited survey evidence with his 
19:454:41252:27:27:72:543:142:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:regression results, he concludes that R&D investment in small German firms may be constrained by 
19:455:41349:27:27:72:546:115:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the  availability  of  finance.  Bond,  Harhoff,  and  Van  Reenen  (1999)  find  significant  differences  
19:456:41457:27:0:72:543:88:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:between the cash flow impacts on R&D and investment for large manufacturing firms in the United 
20:457:41701:0:27:72:544:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Kingdom and Germany. German firms in their sample are insensitive to cash flow shocks, whereas 
20:458:41796:27:27:72:544:682:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the  investment  of  non-R&D-doing  UK  firms  does  respond.  Cash  flow  helps  to  predict  whether  a  
20:459:41903:27:27:72:545:655:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:UK  firm  does  R&D,  but  not  the  level  of  that  R&D.  They  interpret  their  findings  to  mean  that  
20:460:42013:27:27:72:543:628:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:financial constraints are important for British firms, but that those which do R&D are a self-selected 
20:461:42116:27:27:72:543:601:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:group that face fewer constraints. This is consistent with the view that the desire of firms to smooth 
20:462:42219:27:27:72:543:574:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:R&D over time combines with the relatively high cost of financing it to reduce R&D well below the 
20:463:42317:27:27:72:290:547:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:level that would obtain in a frictionless world.  
20:464:42367:27:27:108:545:520:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Mulkay,  Hall,  and  Mairesse  (2001)  perform  a  similar  exercise  using  large  French  and  U.S.  
20:465:42470:27:27:72:543:493:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:manufacturing firms, finding that cash flow impacts are much larger in the U.S. than in France, both 
20:466:42571:27:27:72:544:466:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for  R&D  and  for  ordinary  investment.  Except  for  the  well-known  fact  that  R&D  exhibits  higher  
20:467:42679:27:27:72:545:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:serial  correlation  than  investment  (presumable  because  of  higher  adjustment  costs),  differences  in  
20:468:42790:27:27:72:546:412:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:behavior  are  between  countries,  not  between  investment  types.  This  result  is  consistent  with  
20:469:42896:27:27:72:544:385:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:evidence reported in Hall, Mairesse, Branstetter, and Crepon (1999) for the U.S., France, and Japan 
20:470:42996:27:27:72:544:358:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:during an earlier time period, which basically finds that R&D and investment on the one hand, and 
20:471:43094:27:27:72:544:331:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sales  and  cash  flow  on  the  other,  are  simultaneously  determined  in  the  United  States  (neither  one

20:473:43323:27:27:72:544:277:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cash  flows  to  the  two  investments.  Using  a  nonstructural  R&D  investment  equation  together  with  
20:474:43432:27:27:72:543:250:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:data for the US, UK, Canada, Europe, and Japan, Bhagat and Welch (1995) found similar results for

20:479:43844:27:27:72:545:115:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:evidence  that  R&D  investment  in  these  firms  is  financially  constrained,  in  line  with  the  previous  
20:480:43957:27:0:72:207:88:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:studies of US and UK firms.

21:484:44347:27:27:72:544:628:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:different  factors  drive  the  firm's  different  types  of  expenditure  or  2)  capital  markets  are  imperfect  
21:485:44464:27:27:72:545:601:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and  different  types  of  expenditure  react  differently  to  a  common  factor  (shocks  to  the  supply  of  
21:486:44577:27:27:72:545:574:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:internal  finance).  He  then  compares  the  sensitivity  of  investment  to  cash  flow  for  innovative  and  
21:487:44690:27:27:72:544:547:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:non-innovative firms. The results support the hypothesis that capital markets are imperfect, finding 
21:488:44791:27:27:72:399:520:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that the investment of innovative firms is more sensitive to cash flow. 
21:489:44863:27:27:108:544:493:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The  conclusions  from  this  body  of  empirical  work  are  several:  first,  there  is  solid  evidence  
21:490:44971:27:27:72:546:466:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that  debt  is  a  disfavored  source  of  finance  for  R&D  investment;  second,  the  “Anglo-Saxon”  
21:491:45075:27:27:72:543:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:economies, with their thick and highly developed stock markets and relatively transparent ownership 
21:492:45175:27:27:72:547:412:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:structures,  typically  exhibit  more  sensitivity  and  responsiveness  of  R&D  to  cash  flow  than  
21:493:45279:27:27:72:545:385:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:continental  economies;  third,  and  much  more  speculatively,  this  greater  responsiveness  may  arise  
21:494:45388:27:27:72:544:358:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:because  they  are  financially  constrained,  in  the  sense  that  they  view  external  sources  of  finance  as  
21:495:45505:27:27:72:546:331:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:much  more  costly  than  internal,  and  therefore  require  a  considerably  higher  rate  of  return  to  
21:496:45614:27:27:72:543:304:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:investments done on the margin when they are tapping these sources. However, it is perhaps equally 
21:497:45713:27:27:72:545:277:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:likely  that  this  responsiveness  occurs  because  firms  are  more  sensitive  to  demand  signals  in  thick  
21:498:45827:27:27:72:545:250:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:financial  equity  markets;  a  definitive  explanation  of  the  “excess  sensitivity”  result  awaits  further  
21:499:45941:27:27:72:546:223:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:research.8  In  addition  to  these  results,  the  evidence  from  Germany  and  some  other  countries  
21:500:46047:27:27:72:545:196:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:suggests  that  small  firms  are  more  likely  to  face  this  difficulty  than  large  established  firms  (not  
21:501:46163:27:25:72:380:169:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:surpisingly, if the source of the problem is a “lemons” premium).  
21:502:46230:25:25:72:222:144:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:                                                  
21:503:46279:25:11:72:544:119:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:F: 8  It  is  also  true  that  much  of  the  literature  here  has  tended  to  downplay  the  role  of  measurement  error  in  drawing  
21:504:46416:11:11:72:543:108:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:F:conclusions from the results. Measurement error in Tobin’s q, cash flow, or output is likely to be sizable and will ensure 
21:505:46539:11:12:72:544:97:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:F:that  all  variables  will  enter  any  specification  of  the  R&D  investment  equation  significantly,  regardless  of  whether  they  
21:506:46677:12:11:72:545:85:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:F:truly  belong  or  not.  Instrumental  variables  estimation  is  a  partial  solution,  but  only  if  all  the  errors  are  serially  
21:507:46814:11:0:72:194:74:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:F:uncorrelated, which is unlikely. 
22:508:46995:0:27:108:111:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A: 
22:509:46995:27:27:108:545:682:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:From  a  policy  perspective,  these  results  point  to  another  reason  why  it  may  be  socially  
22:510:47098:27:27:72:544:655:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:beneficial  to  offer  tax  incentives  to  companies  in  order  to  reduce  the  cost  of  capital  they  face  for  
22:511:47217:27:27:72:545:628:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:R&D  investment,  especially  to  small  and  new  firms.  Many  governments,  including  those  in  the  
22:512:47323:27:27:72:545:601:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:United  States  and  the  United  Kingdom,  currently  have  such  programs.  Such  a  policy  approach  
22:513:47428:27:27:72:543:574:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:simply observes that the cost of capital is relatively high for R&D and tries to close the gap via a tax 
22:514:47533:27:27:72:545:547:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:subsidy.  However,  there  is  an  alternative  approach  relying  on  the  private  sector  that  attempts  to  
22:515:47646:27:27:72:544:520:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:close the financing gap by reducing the degree of asymmetric information and moral hazard rather 
22:516:47743:27:40:72:438:493:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:than simply subsidizing the investment. I turn to this topic in the next section. 
22:517:47825:40:30:72:348:453:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:C:V. Small Firms, Startup Finance, and Venture Capital  
22:518:47879:30:27:108:543:423:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:As should be apparent from much of the preceding discussion, any problems associated with 
22:519:47969:27:27:72:544:396:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:financing investments in new technology will be most apparent for new entrants and startup firms. 
22:520:48067:27:27:72:544:369:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:For this reason, many governments already provide some of form of assistance for such firms, and 
22:521:48164:27:27:72:546:342:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in  many  countries,  especially  the  United  States,  there  exists  a  private  sector  “venture  capital”  
22:522:48275:27:27:72:544:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:industry  that  is  focused  on  solving  the  problem  of  financing  innovation  for  new  and  young  firms.  
22:523:48388:27:27:72:546:288:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:This  section  of  the  paper  reviews  what  we  know  about  these  alternative  funding  mechanisms,  
22:524:48493:27:27:72:545:261:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:beginning  with  a  brief  look  at  government  funding  for  startups  and  then  discussing  the  venture

22:526:48622:39:30:72:255:195:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f8:C:Government funding for startup firms  
22:527:48660:30:27:108:544:165:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Examples  of  such  programs  are  the  U.S.  Small  Business  Investment  Company  (SBIC)  and  
22:528:48757:27:27:72:545:138:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Small  Business  Innovation  Research  (SBIR)  programs.  Together,  these  programs  disbursed  $2.4  
22:529:48860:27:27:72:544:111:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:billion in 1995, more than 60% of the amount from venture capital in that year (Lerner 1998a). In 
22:530:48958:27:0:72:543:84:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Germany, more than 800 federal and state government financing program have been established for 
23:531:49202:0:27:72:544:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:new firms in the recent past (OECD 1995). In 1980, the Swedish established the first of a series of 
23:532:49302:27:27:72:543:682:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:investment companies (along with instituting a series of measures such as reduced capital gains taxes 
23:533:49404:27:27:72:546:655:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to  encourage  private  investments  in  startups),  partly  on  the  United  States  model.  By  1987,  the  
23:534:49514:27:27:72:544:628:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:government  share  of  venture  capital  funding  was  43  percent  (Karaomerliolu  and  Jacobsson  1999).  
23:535:49622:27:27:72:546:601:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Recently,  the  UK  has  instituted  a  series  of  government  programs  under  the  Enterprise  Fund  
23:536:49726:27:27:72:545:574:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:umbrella  which  allocate  funds  to  small  and  medium-sized  firms  in  high  technology  and  certain  
23:537:49833:27:27:72:544:547:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:regions, as well as guaranteeing some loans to small businesses (Bank of England 2001). There are 
23:538:49931:27:27:72:245:520:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:also programs at the European level. 
23:539:49968:27:27:108:546:493:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:A  limited  amount  of  evidence,  most  of  it  U.S.-based,  exists  as  to  the  effectiveness  and  
23:540:50071:27:27:72:544:466:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:“additionality” of these programs. In most cases, evaluating the success of the programs is difficult 
23:541:50173:27:27:72:543:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:due to the lack of a “control” group of similar firms that do not receive funding.9 Therefore most of 
23:542:50275:27:27:72:544:412:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the available studies are based on retrospective survey data provided by the recipients; few attempt 
23:543:50376:27:27:72:544:385:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to  address  the  question  of  performance  under  the  counterfactual  seriously.  A  notable  exception  is  
23:544:50488:27:27:72:544:358:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the study by Lerner (1999), who looks at 1435 SBIR awardees and a matched sample of firms that 
23:545:50583:27:27:72:544:331:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:did  not  receive  awards,  over  a  ten-year  post-award  period.  Because  most  of  the  firms  are  privately  
23:546:50698:27:27:72:543:304:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:held, he is unable to analyze the resulting valuation or profitability of the firms, but he does find that 
23:547:50805:27:27:72:544:277:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:firms  receiving  SBIR  grants  grow  significantly  faster  than  the  others  after  receipt  of  the  grant.  He  
23:548:50922:27:27:72:544:250:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:attributes  some  of  this  effect  to  “quality  certification”  by  the  government  that  enables  the  firm  to  
23:549:51039:27:79:72:269:223:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:raise funds from private sources as well.10

24:557:51770:30:27:108:545:679:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Many  observers  view  the  rise  of  the  venture  capital  (VC)  industry,  especially  that  in  the  
24:558:51875:27:27:72:543:652:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:United States, a “free market” solution to the problems of financing innovation. In fact, many of the 
24:559:51977:27:27:72:544:625:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:European  programs  described  above  have  as  some  of  their  goals  the  provision  of  seed  capital  and  
24:560:52089:27:27:72:546:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the  encouragement  of  a  venture  capital  industry  that  addresses  the  needs  of  high  technology  
24:561:52195:27:27:72:544:571:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:startups. Table 1 shows why this has been of some concern to European policymakers: the amount 
24:562:52290:27:27:72:545:544:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of  venture  capital  available  to  firms  in  the  United  States  and  Europe  was  roughly  comparable  in  
24:563:52402:27:27:72:544:517:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:1996, but the relative allocation to new firms (seed money and startups) in Europe was much less, 
24:564:52500:27:27:72:543:490:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:below 10% of the funds as opposed to 27%. A correspondingly greater amount was used to finance 
24:565:52595:27:27:72:195:463:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:buyouts of various kinds.  
24:566:52622:27:27:108:544:436:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:In  the  United  States,  the  VC  industry  consists  of  fairly  specialized  pools  of  funds  (usually  
24:567:52730:27:27:72:544:409:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:from  private  investors)  that  are  managed  and  invested  in  companies  by  individuals  knowledgeable  
24:568:52839:27:27:72:544:382:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:about the industry in which they are investing. In principle, the idea is that the lemons premium is 
24:569:52940:27:27:72:546:355:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:reduced  because  the  investment  managers  are  better  informed  and  moral  hazard  is  minimized  
24:570:53043:27:27:72:544:328:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:because a higher level of monitoring than that used in conventional arm’s length investments is the 
24:571:53143:27:27:72:545:301:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:norm.  But  the  story  is  more  complex  than  that:  the  combination  of  high  uncertainty,  asymmetric  
24:572:53253:27:27:72:544:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:information,  and  the  fact  that  R&D  investment  typically  does  not  yield  results  instantaneously  not

24:575:53584:27:27:72:543:193:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:optimal for the investor (VC) to have the right to shut down a project and there are other situations 
24:576:53686:27:27:72:424:166:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in which optimal performance is achieved when the innovator has control.

25:580:54210:0:27:72:545:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:provisions  to  the  predictions  of  the  economic  theory  of  financial  contracting  under  uncertainty.  
25:581:54320:27:27:72:544:682:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:They find that the contracts often provide for separate allocation of cash flow rights, control rights, 
25:582:54424:27:27:72:543:655:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:voting rights, board positions, and liquidation rights, and that the rights are frequently contingent on 
25:583:54529:27:27:72:547:628:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:performance  measures.  If  performance  is  poor,  the  VCs  often  gain  full  control  of  the  firm.  
25:584:54635:27:27:72:545:601:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Provisions  such  as  delayed  vesting  are  often  included  to  mitigate  hold-up  by  the  entrepreneur  as  
25:585:54747:27:27:72:275:574:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:suggested by Anand and Galetovic (2000).  
25:586:54789:27:27:108:548:547:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Kaplan   and   Stromberg   conclude   that   these   contracts   are   most   consistent   with   the   
25:587:54893:27:27:72:544:520:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:predictions of Aghion and Bolton (1992) and Dewatripont and Tirole (1994), all of whom study the 
25:588:54990:27:27:72:544:493:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:incomplete contracts that arise when cash flows can be observed but not verified in sufficient detail 
25:589:55092:27:27:72:544:466:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to  be  used  for  contract  enforcement.  Put  simply,  the  modal  VC  contract  is  a  complex  debt-equity  
25:590:55204:27:27:72:544:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:hybrid (and in fact, frequently contains convertible preferred securities and other such instruments) 
25:591:55306:27:27:72:544:412:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that looks more like debt when the firm does poorly (giving control to the investor) and more like 
25:592:55405:27:27:72:540:385:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:equity  when  the  firm  does  well  (by  handing  control  to  the  entrepreneur,  which  is  incentive-
25:593:55510:27:27:72:136:358:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:compatible).  
25:594:55524:27:27:108:543:331:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:In a series of papers, Lerner (1992, 1995) studied a sample of VC-financed startups in detail, 
25:595:55619:27:27:72:545:304:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:highlighting  the  important  role  that  investing  and  monitoring  experience  has  in  this  industry.  He  
25:596:55731:27:27:72:545:277:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:found  that  the  amount  of  funds  provided  and  the  share  of  equity  retained  by  the  managers  are  
25:597:55841:27:27:72:545:250:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sensitive  to  the  experience  and  ability  of  the  capital  providers  and  the  maturity  of  the  firm  being  
25:598:55958:27:27:72:545:223:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:funded.  VCs  do  increase  the  value  of  the  firms  they  fund,  especially  when  they  are  experienced  
25:599:56069:27:27:72:544:196:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:investors.  Firms  backed  by  seasoned  VC  financiers  are  more  likely  to  successfully  time  the  market  
25:600:56182:27:27:72:399:169:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:when they go public, and to employ the most reputable underwriters.  
25:601:56251:27:27:108:546:142:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:At  a  macro-economic  level,  VC  funding  tends  to  be  pro-cyclical  but  it  is  difficult  to  
25:602:56352:27:27:72:543:115:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:disentangle whether the supply of funding causes growth or productivity growth encourages funding 
25:603:56450:27:0:72:545:88:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(Kortum  and  Lerner  2000;  Gompers  and  Lerner  1999a,b;  Ueda  2001).  The  problem  here  is  very  
26:604:56703:0:27:72:544:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:similar  to  the  identification  problem  for  R&D  investment  in  general:  because  of  feedback  effects,  
26:605:56815:27:27:72:545:682:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:there  is  a  chicken-egg  simultaneity  in  the  relationship.  Some  evidence  (Majewski  1997)  exists  that  
26:606:56928:27:27:72:543:655:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:new and/or small biotechnology firms turn to other sources of funding in downturns, but that such 
26:607:57026:27:27:72:544:628:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:placements  are  typically  less  successful  (Lerner  and  Tsai  2000),  due  to  the  misallocation  of  control  
26:608:57142:27:27:72:544:601:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:rights  (when  the  startup  firm  is  in  a  weak  bargaining  position,  control  tends  to  be  allocated  to  the  
26:609:57261:27:27:72:474:574:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:more powerful corporate partner, but this has negative consequences for incentives).   
26:610:57348:27:27:108:546:547:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The  limited  evidence  from  Europe  on  the  performance  of  VC-funded  firms  tends  to  
26:611:57441:27:27:72:545:520:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:confirm  that  from  the  U.S.  Engel  (2001)  compares  a  matched  sample  of  German  firms  founded  
26:612:57546:27:27:72:545:493:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:between  1991  and  1998  and  finds  that  the  VC-backed  firms  grew  faster  than  the  non-VC-backed  
26:613:57653:27:27:72:544:466:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:firms. Lumme et al (1993) compare the financing and growth of small UK and Finnish firms. This 
26:614:57748:27:27:72:545:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:approach  permits  a  comparison  between  a  financial  market-based  and  a  bank-centered  economy,  
26:615:57852:27:27:72:544:412:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and  indeed,  they  find  that  small  UK  firms  rely  more  on  equity  and  less  on  loan  finance  and  grow  
26:616:57967:27:27:72:543:385:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:faster than small Finnish firms. Further evidence on small UK high technology firms is provided by 
26:617:58066:27:27:72:544:358:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Moore  (1993),  who  looks  at  300  such  firms,  finding  that  the  availability  and  cost  of  finance  is  the  
26:618:58184:27:27:72:544:331:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:most  important  constraint  facing  these  firms,  but  that  they  are  affected  only  marginally  more  than  
26:619:58298:27:27:72:544:304:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:other types of small firms. That is, the financing “gap” in the UK may be more related to size than 
26:620:58398:27:27:72:161:277:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to R&D intensity.  
26:621:58417:27:27:108:540:250:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:For  Japan,  Hamao,  Packer,  and  Ritter  (1998)  find  that  the  long  run  performance  of  VC-
26:622:58516:27:27:72:546:223:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:backed  Initial  Public  Offerings  (IPOs)  are  no  better  than  that  for  other  IPOs,  unlike  Lerner’s  
26:623:58626:27:27:72:545:196:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:evidence  for  the  United  States.  However,  many  VCs  in  Japan  are  subsidiaries  of  major  securities  
26:624:58737:27:27:72:544:169:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:firms rather than specialists as in the United States. Only these VCs have low returns, whereas those 
26:625:58839:27:27:72:543:142:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that are independent have returns more similar to the US. They attribute the low returns to conflicts 
26:626:58941:27:0:72:544:115:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of interest between the VC subsidiary and the securities firm that owns it, which affects the price at 
27:627:59192:0:27:72:545:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:which  the  IPO  is  offered.  This  result  highlights  the  importance  of  the  institutions  in  which  the  
27:628:59305:27:27:72:458:682:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:venture capital industry is embedded for the creation of entrepreneurial incentives. 
27:629:59390:27:27:108:546:655:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Black  and  Gilson  (1997)  and  Rajan  and  Zingales  (2001)  take  the  institutional  argument  
27:630:59489:27:27:72:544:628:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:further.  Both  pairs  of  authors  emphasize  the  contrast  between  arms’  length  market-based  financial  
27:631:59600:27:27:72:546:601:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:systems  (e.g.,  the  US  and  the  UK)  and  bank-centered  capital  market  systems  (e.g.,  much  of  
27:632:59705:27:27:72:545:574:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:continental  Europe  and  Japan),  and  view  venture  capital  as  combining  the  strengths  of  the  two  
27:633:59814:27:27:72:543:547:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:systems, in that it provides both the strong incentives for the manager-entrepreneur characteristic of 
27:634:59917:27:27:72:540:520:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the  stock  market  system  and  the  monitoring  by  an  informed  investor  characteristic  of  the  bank-
27:635:60025:27:27:72:543:493:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:centered system. They emphasize the importance of an active stock market, especially for newer and 
27:636:60124:27:27:72:544:466:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:younger firms, in order to provide an exit strategy for VC investors, and allow them to move on to 
27:637:60223:27:27:72:545:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:financing  new  startups.    Thus  having  a  VC  industry  that  contributes  to  innovation  and  growth  
27:638:60331:27:27:72:547:412:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:requires  the  existence  of  an  active  IPO  (Initial  Public  Offering)  market  to  permit  successful  
27:639:60439:27:27:72:544:385:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:entrepreneurs  to  regain  control  of  their  firms  (and  incidentally  to  provide  powerful  incentives  for  
27:640:60553:27:27:72:544:358:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:undertaking the startup in the first place) and also to ensure that the VCs themselves are able to use 
27:641:60656:27:40:72:310:331:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:their expertise to help to establish new endeavors.

27:643:60736:30:27:108:544:261:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Based on the literature surveyed here, what do we know about the costs of financing R&D 
27:644:60824:27:27:72:545:234:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:investments  and  the  possibility  that  some  kind  of  market  failure  exists  in  this  area?  Several  main  
27:645:60939:27:27:72:143:207:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:points emerge: 
27:646:60954:27:27:90:544:180:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:1.    There is fairly clear evidence, based on theory, surveys, and empirical estimation, that small 
27:647:61055:27:27:90:545:153:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:and  startup  firms  in  R&D-intensive  industries  face  a  higher  cost  of  capital  than  their  larger  
27:648:61164:27:27:90:544:126:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:competitors and than firms in other industries. In addition to compelling theoretical arguments 
27:649:61260:27:0:90:543:99:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:and empirical evidence, the mere existence of the VC industry and the fact that it is concentrated 
28:650:61507:0:27:90:545:709:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:precisely  where  these  startups  are  most  active  suggests  that  this  is  so.  In  spite  of  considerable  
28:651:61621:27:27:90:545:682:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:entry  into  the  VC  industry,  returns  remain  high,  which  does  suggest  a  high  required  rate  of  
28:652:61729:27:27:90:263:655:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:return in equilibrium (Upside 2001).  
28:653:61767:27:27:90:544:628:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:2.   The evidence for a financing gap for large and established R&D firms is harder to establish. 
28:654:61865:27:27:90:545:601:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:It  is  certainly  the  case  that  these  firms  prefer  to  use  internally  generated  funds  for  financing  
28:655:61978:27:27:90:544:574:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:investment,  but  less  clear  that  there  is  an  argument  for  intervention,  beyond  the  favorable  tax  
28:656:62089:27:27:90:329:547:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:treatment that currently exists in many countries.11  
28:657:62143:27:27:90:544:520:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:3.   The VC solution to the problem of financing innovation has its limits: First, it does tend to 
28:658:62242:27:27:90:544:493:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:focus only on a few sectors at a time, and to make investment with a minimum size that is too 
28:659:62336:27:27:90:544:466:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:large  for  startups  in  some  fields.  Second,  good  performance  of  the  VC  sector  requires  a  thick  
28:660:62446:27:27:90:544:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:market  in  small  and  new  firm  stocks  (such  as  NASDAQ  or  EASDAQ)  in  order  to  provide  an  
28:661:62549:27:27:90:267:412:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:exit strategy for early stage investors.  
28:662:62591:27:27:90:544:385:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:4.   The effectiveness of government incubators, seed funding, loan guarantees, and other such 
28:663:62686:27:27:90:540:358:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:policies   for   funding   R&D   deserves   further   study,   ideally   in   an   experimental   or   quasi-
28:664:62795:27:27:90:545:331:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:experimental  setting.  In  particular,  studying  the  cross-country  variation  in  the  performance  of  
28:665:62903:27:27:90:545:304:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:such  programs  would  be  desirable,  because  the  outcomes  may  depend  to  a  great  extent  on  
28:666:63005:27:39:90:516:277:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:institutional factors that are difficult to control for using data from within a single country.

28:669:63152:25:11:72:543:119:99:g_d0_f3:99:g_d0_f3:F: 11 It is important to remind the reader of the premise of this paper: I am focusing only on the financing gap arguments
