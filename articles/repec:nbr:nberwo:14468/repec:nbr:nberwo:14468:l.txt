2:30:1571:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:We examine the determinants of congressional voting behavior on two of the most significant pieces
2:31:1669:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:of federal legislation in U.S. economic history: the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention
2:32:1772:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:Act of 2008 and the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. We find evidence that constituent
2:33:1871:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:interests and special interests influence voting patterns during the crisis. Representatives from districts
2:34:1978:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:experiencing an increase in mortgage default rates are significantly more likely to vote in favor of
2:35:2078:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:the AHRFPA. They are precise in responding only to mortgage related constituent defaults, and are
2:36:2175:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:significantly more sensitive to defaults of their own-party constituents. Increased campaign contributions
2:37:2281:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:from the financial services industry is associated with a higher likelihood of voting in favor of the
2:38:2382:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:F:EESA, a bill which transfers wealth from tax payers to the financial services industry. We also examine
2:39:2485:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:F:the trade-off between politician ideology and constituent and special interests, and find that conservative
2:40:2592:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:F:politicians are less responsive to constituent and special interest pressure. This latter finding suggests
2:41:2698:14:42:72:519:434:12:Times:12:Times:C:that politicians, through ideology, can commit against intervention even during severe crises.

3:62:3181:0:31:72:185:705:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:1  Introduction
3:63:3196:31:20:72:540:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The U.S. mortgage default crisis has led to two of the most signiÖcant pieces of emergency federal
3:64:3294:20:21:72:540:654:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:legislation in U.S. economic history. In July 2008, after several months of steep deterioration in the
3:65:3396:21:20:72:540:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mortgage market, the U.S. Congress passed the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Preven-
3:66:3489:20:20:72:539:613:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tion Act (ìAHRFPAî), a bill that provides up to$300billion in Federal Housing Administration
3:67:3581:20:21:71:539:593:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:insurance for renegotiated mortgages and unlimited support for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.1
3:68:3672:21:20:72:540:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In October 2008, the U.S. federal government enacted the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act
3:69:3765:20:20:72:540:552:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(ìEESAî) which enables the Treasury Department to recapitalize banks through direct purchase
3:70:3857:20:20:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of new equity and severely distressed mortgage backed securities up to$700billion. These bills
3:71:3951:20:21:72:539:512:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:have forced an increase in the national debt ceiling of over$1trillion, and they guarantee signiÖ-
3:72:4049:21:20:72:540:491:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cant government intervention in the mortgage market and Önancial industry for years to come. By
3:73:4144:20:20:72:540:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:any standard, the AHRFPA and the EESA represent congressional legislation of historic economic
3:74:4238:20:21:72:194:451:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:relevance and magnitude.
3:75:4262:21:20:88:539:430:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:This paper analyzes the decision making process of U.S. Congressional representatives voting
3:76:4354:20:20:72:540:410:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on these bills.  Our analysis is important on two dimensions.  First, it details the political de-
3:77:4452:20:21:72:540:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:terminants of the governmentís response to the most severe Önancial crisis in U.S. history since
3:78:4548:21:20:72:540:369:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the Great Depression. Second, and perhaps more importantly, the passage of these bills provides
3:79:4643:20:20:72:540:349:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a unique opportunity to answer long-standing questions in political economy. More speciÖcally,
3:80:4737:20:21:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:political scientists and economists have long argued that government policy toward the economy is
3:81:4834:21:20:72:540:308:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:determined by the conáuence of three factors: political ideology, constituent interests, and special
3:82:4934:20:20:72:540:288:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:interests (Stigler, (1971), Posner (1974), Peltzman (1976), Kau and Rubin, (1979, 1993)). Em-
3:83:5027:20:21:72:540:268:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:pirically separating these factors and understanding the mechanisms through which they operate
3:84:5121:21:20:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:remains di¢ cult. As we show below, circumstances related to the passage of the emergency bills
3:85:5216:20:20:72:498:227:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:coupled with a unique data set enable us to make signiÖcant progress on these questions.
3:86:5304:20:21:88:539:207:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:A key advantage of the emergency bills - relative to a substantial majority of existing congres-
3:87:5400:21:20:72:540:186:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sional voting studies - is that winners and losers are well speciÖed (Peltzman, (1984)). While both
3:88:5499:20:20:72:540:166:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:bills conáict with the fundamental conservative principle of limited intervention in private markets,
3:89:5600:20:21:72:540:146:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:they each have speciÖc ìwinnersî that can be identiÖed empirically. The AHRFPA provides an
3:90:5690:21:16:72:540:125:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:expected net transfer to households that are in (or near) default on their mortgages, while the
3:91:5785:16:20:84:539:109:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:1The act is also known as the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 and the speciÖc provision to provide
3:92:5893:20:0:72:289:89:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:FHA insurance is the Hope for Homeowners program.
4:93:5943:0:20:72:540:705:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:EESA provides an expected net transfer (at least in the short run) to the Önancial industry. We
4:94:6038:20:20:72:515:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:refer to the former as ìconstituent interestsîand latter as ìspecial interestsîin our analysis.
4:95:6133:20:21:88:539:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We utilize a unique data set that allows us to precisely measure these constituent and special
4:96:6227:21:20:72:540:644:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:interests. The data set includes zip code level information on consumer credit defaults which we
4:97:6323:20:20:72:540:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:use to construct the mortgage default rate at the congressional district level. In addition, the level
4:98:6425:20:21:72:540:604:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of geographical disaggregation in the data allows us to separately construct the default rate for
4:99:6522:21:20:72:540:583:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Republican and Democratic voters in a constituency. Our data set also includes information on the
4:100:6619:20:20:72:540:563:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:average campaign contributions that a representative receives over a congressional cycle from the
4:101:6716:20:21:72:158:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Önancial industry.
4:102:6734:21:20:88:539:522:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We begin with an analysis of politician voting patterns on the AHRFPA. At its core, the bill
4:103:6826:20:20:72:540:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:presents a conáict between conservative ideology and constituent interests of defaulting mortgage
4:104:6923:20:21:72:540:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:debtors. Separating the e§ects of politician ideology from constituent interests has proven di¢ cult
4:105:7023:21:20:72:540:461:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in previous empirical studies because legislators with a track record of voting conservatively also
4:106:7122:20:20:72:540:441:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:represent districts where constituent interests are naturally aligned with the conservative agenda
4:107:7220:20:21:72:540:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(Peltzman (1984) and (1985), Grier and Munger (1991), Poole and Rosenthal (1997), Levitt (1996)).
4:108:7317:21:20:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:However, a unique advantage of the AHRFPA is that the shock to mortgage defaults that precedes
4:109:7411:20:20:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the bill is completelyorthogonalto ideology.2We therefore have a natural experiment to empirically
4:110:7509:20:21:71:366:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:separate the ináuence of ideology versus constituent interests.
4:111:7572:21:20:88:539:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We Önd strong evidence that constituent interests a§ect a politicianís voting choice. Represen-
4:112:7667:20:20:71:539:319:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tatives from high mortgage default districts are more likely to vote in favor of the AHRFPA, and
4:113:7763:20:21:71:539:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:this result is not driven by ideological preferences or politician ìtype.î When we decompose the
4:114:7859:21:20:71:539:278:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:2007 year end default rate into the 2005 year end default rate and the change in default rate from
4:115:7957:20:20:71:539:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:2005 to 2007, we Önd that politicians only respond to the change in the mortgage default rate. Since
4:116:8057:20:21:71:539:238:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ideological preferences are Öxed in the short run, this result implies that representatives respond
4:117:8156:21:20:71:539:217:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:directly to time-varying constituent interests. Our preferred estimate suggests that a one standard
4:118:8255:20:20:71:540:197:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:deviation increase in mortgage default rates in 2007 leads to a12:6percentage point increase in
4:119:8350:20:21:71:539:177:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the likelihood of voting for the AHRFPA. The Önding contradicts a purely ideological approach
4:120:8443:21:20:71:539:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to political representation (Bernstein (1989), Poole and Rosenthal (1996), Lee, Moretti and Butler
4:121:8541:20:16:71:109:136:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(2004)).
4:122:8549:16:21:84:539:120:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:2This is true within the set of Republican districts, which is the relevant set since almost all Democrats voted in
4:123:8664:21:0:72:147:99:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:favor of AHRFPA.
5:124:8681:0:20:88:539:705:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We provide several additional insights into the mechanisms through which constituent interests
5:125:8775:20:20:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a§ect representativesí voting patterns.  We Önd that representatives are remarkably precise in
5:126:8869:20:21:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:responding to constituent interests. Since the mortgage bill has no impact on voters with credit

5:128:9060:20:20:72:540:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of non-mortgage related defaults changes.  Despite the strong correlation of non-mortgage and
5:129:9153:20:21:72:540:604:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mortgage defaults in the data, we Önd that politicians react only to mortgage defaults while ignoring
5:130:9254:21:20:72:181:583:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:non-mortgage defaults.
5:131:9276:20:20:88:539:563:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Employing zip code level information, we also separate the overall mortgage default rate into
5:132:9369:20:21:72:539:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the mortgage default rate experienced by Republican and Democratic voterswithina congressional
5:133:9463:21:20:72:540:522:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:district, and we show that politicians do not respond equally to all constituents. Instead, repre-
5:134:9561:20:20:72:540:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sentatives respond primarily to their own voting bloc. These results provide support to the ìdual
5:135:9658:20:21:72:540:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:constituencyî hypothesis that legislators respond more strongly to their own supporters within
5:136:9752:21:20:72:540:461:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:their electorate (Fiorina (1974)). To the best of our knowledge, ours is the Örst work that provides
5:137:9852:20:20:72:507:441:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:evidence of the geographical precision with which politicians respond to their constituency.
5:138:9944:20:21:88:539:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:If representatives are responding to constituent interests due to electoral pressure, then the
5:139:10038:21:20:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:e§ect of constituent interest on voting behavior should be stronger in more competitive districts.
5:140:10136:20:20:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Consistent with this prediction, we Önd that representatives are more likely to respond to an increase
5:141:10238:20:21:72:540:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in their constituent mortgage default rate by voting in favor of the AHRFPA if their election is
5:142:10334:21:20:72:398:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:closely contested or if their district lies in a presidential swing state.
5:143:10408:20:20:88:539:319:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In our examination of politician voting patterns on the EESA, we Önd that a strong predictor
5:144:10500:20:21:72:540:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of voting behavior is the amount of campaign contributions from the Önancial services industry.
5:145:10595:21:20:72:540:278:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:This Önding is consistent with anecdotal evidence suggesting that the Önancial industry lobbied
5:146:10690:20:20:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:heavily to shape the EESA and get it passed. However, we are cautious in our interpretation of
5:147:10784:20:21:72:540:238:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:this result. As Stratmann (2002, p. 346) emphasizes, ìif interest groups contribute to legislators
5:148:10882:21:20:72:540:217:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:who support them anyway, a signiÖcant correlation between money and votes does not justify
5:149:10972:20:20:72:540:197:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the conclusion that money buys votes.  In this case the positive correlation arises because the
5:150:11067:20:21:72:540:177:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:same underlying factors that cause a group to contribute to a legislator also cause a legislator to
5:151:11166:21:15:72:539:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:vote in the groupís interestî.3While this is a genuine concern, the signiÖcance of the impact of
5:152:11262:15:21:84:539:141:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:3Di§erent strands of theoretical work on special interests are present in the literature with a Political Science

5:155:11592:17:0:72:540:87:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:important empirical analysis in particular with regard to trade policy (Goldberg amd Maggi (1999), Gawande and

6:157:11798:20:20:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the inclusion of many reasonable proxies for the ìunderlying factorsî such as politician ideology,
6:158:11896:20:21:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:district demographics, the fraction of constituents working for the Önancial industry, and whether
6:159:11994:21:20:72:540:644:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the representative serves on the Önancial committee. The magnitude of our estimate implies that a

6:161:12188:20:21:72:539:604:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is associated with a10percentage point increase in the likelihood of a politician voting for the bill.
6:162:12290:21:20:88:539:583:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:While the two bills di§ered in the identity of their direct beneÖciaries, they shared the com-
6:163:12384:20:20:72:540:563:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mon characteristic that they both conáicted with the fundamental conservative ideology of limited
6:164:12481:20:21:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:government intervention. This friction was apparent in the debates leading up to the two votes as
6:165:12578:21:20:72:540:522:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ideologically conservative Republicans strongly objected to the bills on philosophical grounds. Not
6:166:12677:20:20:72:510:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:surprisingly, we Önd that conservative ideology strongly predicts votes against the two bills.
6:167:12771:20:21:88:539:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In our analysis of ideology versus constituent and special interests, our ability to separate the
6:168:12868:21:20:72:540:461:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:e§ects of each allows us to estimate the ìpriceîof the trade-o§ between ideological and economic
6:169:12964:20:20:72:540:441:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:voting incentives. While heightened constituent and special interests push politicians to vote in
6:170:13061:20:21:72:540:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:favor of massive government intervention, we Önd that conservative politicians with ideological op-
6:171:13160:21:20:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:position to the legislation are signiÖcantly less responsive to such heightened interests. In other

6:173:13354:20:21:72:540:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:butions on the EESA vote are signiÖcantly weaker among ideologically conservative representatives.
6:174:13452:21:20:72:540:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:These results highlight the importance of political ideology as a partial commitment device against

6:176:13649:20:21:72:383:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and special interests even in the midst of a major Önancial crisis.
6:177:13716:21:20:88:539:278:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:To our knowledge, this latter result is a novel documentation of the commitment value of
6:178:13804:20:20:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ideological preferences in resisting constituent and special interest pressures.4This is an important
6:179:13905:20:21:72:540:238:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:point, given that the ability to partially commit against ex post intervention is an important aspect
6:180:14006:21:20:72:540:217:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of the pricing of systematic risk as it relates to extreme Önancial crisis situations. This Önding
6:181:14104:20:20:72:540:197:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is related to a number of theoretical papers that rationalize the existence of di§erent political

7:195:15324:20:20:88:539:563:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The rest of our analysis proceeds as follows.  The next section provides background on the
7:196:15414:20:21:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:AHRFPA and the EESA, and describes how these bills were perceived by constituent and special
7:197:15506:21:20:72:540:522:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:interests. Section 3 presents the data and summary statistics. Section 4 presents the empirical

7:201:15841:43:31:72:499:418:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:2  The Legislative Response to the Mortgage Default Crisis
7:202:15899:31:20:72:540:387:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In this section, we describe the two pieces of legislation that are central to our analysis of the
7:203:15997:20:21:72:540:367:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mortgage crisis. We also describe how these bills were perceived by constituents and special interests
7:204:16099:21:20:72:180:346:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:at the time of passage.
7:205:16122:20:20:88:539:326:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Before describing the details of the bills, it is important to emphasize the magnitude of the
7:206:16215:20:21:72:540:306:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mortgage default crisis and its e§ects on the economy. From 2005 to 2007, Mian and SuÖ (2008)
7:207:16308:21:20:72:540:285:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:show that the aggregate default rate on mortgages more than doubled. According to the S&P/Case

7:212:16773:20:21:72:540:184:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Washington Mutual, have failed or been acquired directly because of the plummeting value of
7:213:16864:21:20:72:540:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:subprime and prime mortgage backed securities. It is in this environment that the U.S. Congress
7:214:16959:20:0:72:533:143:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:has conducted a massive intervention in Önancial markets through the AHRFPA and the EESA.

8:216:17120:27:20:72:540:678:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The initial U.S. Congressional response to the mortgage default crisis evolved between the summer
8:217:17217:20:21:72:540:658:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of 2007 and the summer of 2008, leading to the signing of the American Housing Rescue and
8:218:17306:21:20:72:540:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Foreclosure Prevention Act (AHRFPA) on July 30, 2008 by President Bush.5The Önal version
8:219:17394:20:20:71:539:617:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of the AHRFPA included a number of provisions meant to aid the ailing housing sector. The act
8:220:17487:20:21:71:539:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:gave the U.S. Federal Government, through the Federal Housing Administration, the ability to

8:222:17674:20:20:71:408:556:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:voluntarily agreed to reduce mortgage principal and delinquency fees.6
8:223:17744:20:21:88:539:536:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The AHRFPA also increased the Treasuryís authority under existing lines of credit to Freddie

8:225:17921:20:20:71:539:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:authority to buy stock or debt in those companies. The amount of the line of credit was unlimited
8:226:18018:20:21:71:540:475:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:during these18months.7In addition, the act increased FHA loan limits and provided tax breaks
8:227:18110:21:20:71:539:454:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for Örst-time home buyers. Finally, the act called for a regulatory overhaul of the O¢ ce of Federal

8:231:18495:20:20:88:539:373:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Overall, at the time of passage, the AHRFPA represented one of the most dramatic government
8:232:18586:20:21:71:539:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:interventions in the housing sector in recent history.  The New York Times (July 24th, 2008)

9:249:20143:20:20:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:time of passage. In terms of the perceived beneÖciaries of the legislation, the primary component of
9:250:20243:20:21:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the bill, the FHA insurance for renegotiated mortgages, represented a transfer from tax payers to
9:251:20340:21:20:72:540:644:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the lenders and borrowers that renegotiate mortgages. Under the legislation, the renegotiation of
9:252:20437:20:20:72:540:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:any mortgage is voluntary, which implies that neither lenders nor borrowers could be made worse
9:253:20532:20:21:72:540:604:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:o§ directly from the bill. There is, however, some evidence that mortgage lenders faced implicit
9:254:20628:21:20:72:540:583:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:pressure to agree to write down principal in order to initiate renegotiations. For example, on the
9:255:20726:20:20:72:540:563:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:day the bill was passed, Representative Barney Frank (D-MA), chairman of the House Financial
9:256:20818:20:21:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Services Committee, was quoted in the New York Times as follows: ìMany of these institutions
9:257:20910:21:20:72:540:522:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:know this is coming.  I hope they will be able to take advantage of it right away.î And in the
9:258:21004:20:20:72:540:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Washington Post, Frank is quoted as follows: ìI would be very disappointed if, having helped us

9:260:21200:21:20:72:540:461:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:were households either in default or close to default on mortgage payments. Mortgage lenders were
9:261:21297:20:20:72:540:441:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:also beneÖciaries, but there may have been implicit Congressional pressure that would reduce the
9:262:21393:20:21:72:429:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:beneÖts if mortgage lenders were forced to renegotiate mortgages at a loss.

9:273:22315:17:16:72:540:219:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:was characterized by strong opposition (and a veto threat) by the executive branch. The Wall Street Journal (May

10:282:23143:21:20:72:540:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:been a problem since August of 2007, more troublesome patterns emerged with the nationalization
10:283:23238:20:20:72:540:617:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the distress at Lehman Brothers during the week of September

10:285:23424:21:20:72:540:576:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in history. On Tuesday, September 16th, the US government nationalized the American Interna-

10:290:23897:20:21:72:540:475:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:news reports suggested that ìthe federal government is working on a sweeping series of program

10:294:24203:21:20:72:540:393:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:B:hallmark of the legislation was authorization for the U.S. Department of Treasury to buy up to$700
10:295:24301:20:20:72:540:373:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:billion of ìmortgages and other assets that are clogging the balance sheets of Önancial institutions

10:297:24498:21:20:72:540:332:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distressed subprime mortgage backed securities, more recent interpretations suggest that the act
10:298:24594:20:20:72:540:312:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:can be used by Treasury to inject capital directly into banks through an equity investment. The
10:299:24689:20:21:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:bill also included up to$150billion of unrelated tax breaks for individuals and businesses, and an
10:300:24787:21:20:71:405:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:increase in FDIC insurance for depositors from$100;000to$250;000.
10:301:24852:20:20:88:539:251:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:How was this bill perceived by constituents and special interests? At least in the short run,
10:302:24945:20:21:72:540:231:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:it is clear that the legislation represented a large wealth transfer from U.S. tax payers to the
10:303:25041:21:20:72:540:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Önancial services industry. At the time of this writing, the Treasury has yet to purchase assets or
10:304:25140:20:20:72:540:190:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:equity from Önancial institutions. But if the legislation is to help resolve the lack of capital in the
10:305:25243:20:21:72:540:170:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:banking industry, it will most likely involve purchasing distressed assets and equity from Önancial
10:306:25342:21:20:72:540:149:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:institutions at values above what the private market is willing to pay. For this reason, the most
10:307:25439:20:20:72:406:129:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:direct beneÖciary of the legislation was the Önancial services industry.

11:310:25699:20:20:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:initial vote, the House rejected the bill, inducing one of the largest single day stock market losses in
11:311:25803:20:21:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:history. The October 3rd bill was di§erent in two main respects: Örst, it called on the FDIC to lift
11:312:25903:21:20:72:539:644:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:protection from$100;000to$250;000for individual depositors. Second, it included the additional
11:313:25997:20:20:72:540:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tax breaks mentioned above. While our primary focus is on the October 3rd vote, we also examine

13:372:31026:27:20:72:540:678:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Table 1 presents summary statistics.  The variables are split into Öve categories:  measures of
13:373:31121:20:21:72:540:658:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:constituent interests, measures of special interests, a measure of ideology, other political variables,
13:374:31224:21:20:72:540:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and census demographics. Districts are separated by the party a¢ liation of the representative in
13:375:31321:20:20:72:226:617:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the 110th Congress (2007-2008).
13:376:31352:20:21:88:539:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Our main proxy for constituent support for the AHRFPA of 2008 is the mortgage default rate
13:377:31442:21:20:72:540:576:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:as of the end of 2007. While mortgage default rates for Democratic districts are higher than for
13:378:31538:20:20:72:540:556:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Republican districts in both 2005 and 2007, both experience a sharp increase in default rates over
13:379:31636:20:21:72:540:536:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:these two years.  For Republican districts, the increase in the mortgage default rate from 2005
13:380:31731:21:20:72:539:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to 2007 (2:2%) is equivalent to almost two standard deviations in the mortgage default level as
13:381:31826:20:20:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of 2005 (1:2%). The registered Republican and Democratic mortgage default rate is constructed
13:382:31919:20:21:72:540:475:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:using the zip code level information on defaults and voter registration. The registered Republican
13:383:32017:21:20:72:540:454:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(Democratic) default rate is constructed as the population weighted sum of default rates across
13:384:32112:20:20:72:540:434:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:zip codes where the weights are given by the fraction of registered Republicans (Democrats) in the
13:385:32210:20:21:72:540:414:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:zip code. We also construct the ìhome default rateî by aggregating home equity defaults with
13:386:32302:21:20:72:540:393:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mortgage defaults, and the combined variable closely mirrors the mortgage default rate.  Table
13:387:32396:20:20:72:540:373:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:1 also includes information on the non-home default rate, which includes defaults on credit card
13:388:32492:20:21:72:540:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:debt, auto debt, consumer loans, and student loans. We make use of this variable for falsiÖcation

13:393:32877:20:20:72:540:251:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rate, these variables measure constituent support for the EESA, given that the bill represents a
13:394:32973:20:21:72:540:231:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:transfer of wealth from tax payers to the Önancial services industry and those holding their assets.
13:395:33073:21:20:88:539:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Our primary measure of special interest support for the EESA is campaign contributions made

13:398:33355:21:20:72:540:149:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:average campaign contribution per congressional term by the Önancial services industry since 1993

13:400:33544:20:21:72:539:109:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and Democrats is about$142;000and$112;000, respectively.  In terms of politicianís ideology,

15:449:36633:20:20:71:540:541:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:interests (CIi) and special interests (SIi) are strong enough to tilt the representativeís vote in favor
15:450:36737:20:36:71:120:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of the bill.
15:451:36749:36:28:71:206:485:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:4.2  Empirical Proxies
15:452:36771:28:20:71:539:457:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Our data set provides reasonably precise empirical measures for constituent and special interests.
15:453:36869:20:20:71:539:437:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:As mentioned in Section 2, our main empirical proxy for constituent interests on the AHFRPA is
15:454:36963:20:21:71:539:417:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the mortgage default rate as of the end of 2007. Our main measures of constituent interests for
15:455:37058:21:20:71:539:396:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the EESA are the mortgage default rate, the fraction of the district population that works in the
15:456:37155:20:20:71:539:376:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Önancial services industry, and the fraction of the district population that has a household income
15:457:37254:20:21:71:540:356:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:greater than$200;000. In all speciÖcations, our primary measure of special interest ináuence is
15:458:37349:21:20:71:340:335:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:campaign donations from the Önancial services industry.
15:459:37404:20:20:88:539:315:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Table 2 presents correlations between the key right hand side variables in our analysis. Panel
15:460:37498:20:21:71:539:295:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:C shows that there is no correlation between the mortgage default rate and the ideology score of
15:461:37594:21:20:71:539:274:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Republican representatives. In other words, the impact of the current mortgage default crisis is
15:462:37690:20:20:71:539:254:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:orthogonal to variation in political ideology among Republican districts. This is a novel and useful
15:463:37790:20:21:71:539:234:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:feature of the default variation that we exploit to identify the impact of constituent interests on
15:464:37889:21:20:71:539:213:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:politiciansívoting behavior. A second point to take away from Table 2 is that while the correlation
15:465:37988:20:20:71:539:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:between campaign contribution and ideology is positive among Democrats, it is negative among
15:466:38080:20:21:71:539:173:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Republicans. This suggests that campaign contributions from the Önancial industry are targeted
15:467:38174:21:16:71:426:152:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:towards ìmoderatesîin the two parties. We analyze this in greater below.
15:468:38246:16:20:80:539:136:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:19Notice that, without loss of generality, our assumptions aboutfandgimply that both constituent and special
15:469:38354:20:16:71:539:116:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:interests are measured on a scale such that higher values increase their prospect of reelection if they vote in favor of
15:470:38474:16:0:71:102:100:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:the bill.
16:471:38485:0:31:72:524:705:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:5  The AHRFPA of 2008 and the Role of Constituent Interests
16:472:38544:31:20:72:540:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In this section, we empirically estimate (2) to examine the determinants of politician voting patterns
16:473:38646:20:21:72:540:654:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on the AHRFPA. As mentioned in Section 2, the AHRFPA represents a major government inter-
16:474:38735:21:20:72:540:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:vention designed to reduce foreclosures through a$300billion program of FHA-backed reÖnanced
16:475:38827:20:20:72:540:613:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mortgages. In our analysis we focus primarily on votes in the pivotal U.S. House of Representatives
16:476:38926:20:21:72:539:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:roll call 519 (July 26th, 2008).20In some speciÖcations, we also examine voting patterns on roll
16:477:39022:21:20:72:192:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:call 301 (May 8th, 2008).
16:478:39047:20:20:88:539:552:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Table 3 presents voting patterns by political party. Democrats almost unanimously vote in favor
16:479:39142:20:20:72:539:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of the AHRFPA in the July 26th vote, with only3Democrats voting against. In contrast, there is
16:480:39236:20:21:71:539:512:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:B:substantial variation in Republican voting patterns, with45Republicans voting in favor and149
16:481:39329:21:20:71:539:491:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:against. The voting patterns are similar for the May 8th vote. As Panel C demonstrates, there is
16:482:39425:20:20:71:539:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:signiÖcant variation among Republicans that switch votes from May 8th to July 26th. There are
16:483:39518:20:21:71:539:451:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:B:19representatives that switch from voting ìNayî in the May 8th vote to ìYeaî in the July 26th
16:484:39611:21:20:71:539:430:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:vote. There are14representatives that switch from voting ìYeaì in the May 8th vote to voting
16:485:39703:20:36:71:507:410:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ìNayîin the July 26th vote. We further examine these ìswitchersì in speciÖcations below.
16:486:39791:36:28:71:198:374:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:5.1  Baseline Results
16:487:39812:28:20:71:539:346:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Figure 1 presents initial evidence on the importance of constituent interests in explaining voting
16:488:39910:20:20:71:539:326:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:patterns on the AHRFPA. It plots the correlation between mortgage default rates and the propen-
16:489:40005:20:21:71:539:306:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sity to vote in favor of the AHRFPA. We focus only on Republicans given that Democrats vote
16:490:40096:21:20:71:539:285:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:almost unanimously for the AHRFPA. Figure 1 plots the non-parametric relation between mortgage
16:491:40190:20:20:71:539:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:default rates and the propensity to vote in favor of AHRFPA by Republican legislators. Repub-
16:492:40283:20:21:71:539:245:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:licans from higher default rate areas are more likely to vote in favor of the AHRFPA. The e§ect
16:493:40378:21:20:71:511:224:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:appears across the distribution, and is particularly strong when default rates rise above7%.
16:494:40470:20:20:88:539:204:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Table 4 presents linear probability regression estimates of the e§ect of mortgage default rates

16:496:40662:21:16:71:539:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:icant at the1%level, and implies that a one standard deviation increase in the mortgage default
16:497:40757:16:12:80:444:147:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:?:20All voting data are collected from the Library of Congress THOMAS (thomas.loc.gov/).
16:498:40843:12:20:80:539:135:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:21All marginal e§ects reported in our analysis are almost identical in both qualitative and quantitative signiÖcance
16:499:40959:20:17:72:540:115:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:if we use a probit maximum likelihood speciÖcation in place of a linear probability speciÖcation. The use of a linear
16:500:41076:17:0:72:455:98:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:probability model in congressional voting is discussed formally in Heckman and Snyder (1997).
17:501:41171:0:20:72:539:705:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rate leads to a12:6percentage point increase in the likelihood of voting for AHRFPA. Column 2
17:502:41264:20:20:71:539:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:also includes measures of ideology (ID) and special interests (SI). Campaign contributions by the
17:503:41361:20:21:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Önancial services industry do not a§ect voting patterns, while more conservative politician ideol-
17:504:41459:21:20:72:540:644:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ogy has a strong negative e§ect. Despite the explanatory power of politician ideology (theR2of
17:505:41553:20:20:71:539:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the regression increases by almost three times), the estimate on the the mortgage default rate is
17:506:41650:20:21:71:539:604:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:almost identical with the inclusion of the DW nominate ideology score. In other words, the e§ect
17:507:41746:21:20:71:539:583:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of constituent interests on voting patterns is largely orthogonal to the e§ect of ideology, conÖrming
17:508:41847:20:20:71:539:563:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the correlation presented in Table 2. The orthogonality between ideology and constituent interest
17:509:41944:20:21:71:539:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is an advantage of our empirical setting and allows us to cleanly identify the independent e§ect of
17:510:42043:21:20:71:262:522:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:constituent interests on voting patterns.
17:511:42084:20:20:88:539:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Given that the distribution of default rate has a thin right tale distribution (see Figure A1 in
17:512:42180:20:21:71:539:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:appendix), one may be concerned that our coe¢ cient on default rate is being determined by a few
17:513:42276:21:20:71:539:461:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ìoutliersî. Table A1 in the appendix shows that this is not the case. First, the coe¢ cient default
17:514:42375:20:20:71:539:441:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rate is robust to winsorizing the default rate at the5%level. Second, a split of the data below and
17:515:42474:20:21:71:539:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:above the median default rate shows that the OLS coe¢ cient is similar across the two halves of the
17:516:42573:21:20:71:303:400:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distribution (although larger for larger defaults).
17:517:42624:20:20:88:539:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In Column 3, we report results when deconstructing the 2007 default rate into the 2005 level
17:518:42716:20:21:71:539:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:default rate and the change from 2005 to 2007. As the results show, it is the change in the default
17:519:42815:21:20:71:539:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rate from 2005 to 2007 that leads Republicans to vote in favor of the legislation, not the level
17:520:42911:20:20:71:539:319:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in 2005. Given that politician ideology is unlikely to change dramatically in just two years, these
17:521:43010:20:21:71:539:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:results further mitigate the concern that default rates lead to votes in favor of the AHRFPA through
17:522:43110:21:20:71:287:278:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:an ideology channel or other selection e§ects.
17:523:43156:20:20:88:539:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Columns 4 and 5 present estimates from further robustness tests that include political control
17:524:43250:20:21:71:539:238:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:variables (Column 4) and census demographic characteristics (Column 5). The presence of these
17:525:43343:21:20:71:540:217:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:control variables increases theR2of the regression from0:23to0:30, but they have only a slight
17:526:43437:20:20:71:539:197:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:e§ect on the coe¢ cient on the mortgage default rate. We want to emphasize that the inclusion
17:527:43530:20:21:71:539:177:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of census demographic characteristics in Column 5 leads to estimates of the e§ect of constituent
17:528:43626:21:20:71:539:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:interests on voting patterns that are extremely precise and very conservative. The reason is that
17:529:43723:20:20:71:539:136:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:district level demographics also measure constituent interests. For example, the fraction of house-
17:530:43822:20:20:71:540:116:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:B:holds that are Hispanic and the 2007 year end mortgage default rate are highly correlated (0:51
17:531:43917:20:0:71:539:96:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:correlation coe¢ cient).  In other words, it is not obvious that demographic variables should be
18:532:44015:0:20:72:540:705:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:viewed as control variables when trying to estimate the e§ect of constituent interests. The fact
18:533:44111:20:20:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that the mortgage default rate predicts votes in favor of the AHRFPA even after controlling for
18:534:44206:20:21:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:demographics strengthens our interpretation that representatives are responding precisely to con-
18:535:44303:21:20:72:540:644:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:stituent interests, and not ideology or some other district characteristics. In this sense the evidence
18:536:44406:20:20:72:540:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:refutes the null hypothesis that electoral pressures have no e§ect on politician voting behavior (Lee,
18:537:44508:20:21:72:204:604:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Moretti and Butler (2004)).
18:538:44535:21:20:88:539:583:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Column 6 presents our baseline speciÖcation for the vote on roll call 301 (May 8th, 2008). This
18:539:44630:20:20:72:540:563:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is an important robustness check given a substantial di§erence from roll call 519: a presidential
18:540:44727:20:21:72:539:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:veto threat on the bill (possible to overcome by a290-vote majority). In May 2008, President Bush
18:541:44824:21:20:71:539:522:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:opposed the AHRFPA and in particular the$300billion insurance provision, while the July vote
18:542:44916:20:20:71:539:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:was brought to the House áoor the same day the veto threat was lifted. Given that defection from
18:543:45012:20:21:71:539:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the Republican party line (a ìYeaîvote) was a more costly choice in May, the estimates in Column
18:544:45108:21:20:71:539:461:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:6 represent an important test of whether politicians respond to constituent interests even when it
18:545:45206:20:20:71:539:441:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is costly to do so. There is no statistically signiÖcant di§erence between the coe¢ cient estimates
18:546:45305:20:21:71:539:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on mortgage default rates for the May 8th and July 26th votes, which conÖrms that politicians
18:547:45398:21:20:71:533:400:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:responded to constituents even when doing so may have harmed their standing within the party.
18:548:45491:20:20:88:539:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Columns 7 and 8 estimate why some Republicans switch their vote from May 8th, 2008 (Vote

18:550:45674:21:20:71:539:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of the Örst bill, and tests what explains the behavior of those who chose to vote against the second
18:551:45774:20:20:71:539:319:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:version of the bill. Similarly, column 8 conditions on those who voted against the Örst bill and tests
18:552:45876:20:21:71:539:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:why some of them chose to vote in favor of the second version. Given our results earlier, mortgage
18:553:45974:21:20:71:539:278:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:default rates should weigh heavily on the electoral prospects of Republicans who voted against the
18:554:46072:20:20:71:539:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:bill in May 2008 by opening them to criticisms from challengers. Hence, we would expect that
18:555:46164:20:21:71:539:238:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:switchers to a ìYeaì vote represent districts with high default rates. Conversely, representatives
18:556:46262:21:20:71:539:217:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with high default rates are more likely to continue supporting the bill. Columns 7 and 8 conÖrm
18:557:46357:20:20:71:152:197:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:both predictions.
18:558:46374:20:21:88:539:177:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We conclude this section with some (approximate) quantitative assessment of the electoral
18:559:46463:21:20:71:539:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:weight of the mortgage crisis. So far we have emphasized the mortgage default rate as a proxy
18:560:46556:20:20:71:540:136:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:forCI. Such a measure is ideal given that it includes both the extensive margin (the number of
18:561:46650:20:20:71:539:116:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:individuals in default) and the intensive margin (the amount of distressed debt per individual).
18:562:46746:20:0:71:539:96:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:However, an interesting exercise is to investigate proxies for the extensive margin to check the
19:563:46844:0:20:72:539:705:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:lower bound of voters that are most directly a§ected by the crisis.22One rough proxy for the
19:564:46936:20:20:71:539:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:number of voters in default is the number of accounts in default. The number of mortgage accounts
19:565:47033:20:21:71:539:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:proxies reasonably well for the number of voters with a mortgage, which implies that the number
19:566:47128:21:20:71:462:644:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:B:of mortgage accounts in default proxies well for the number of voters in default.23
19:567:47211:20:20:88:539:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We report nonparametric evidence in Appendix Figure A2. Figure A2 reports the total number
19:568:47301:20:21:71:539:604:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of mortgage accounts in default scaled by the total number of individuals with a credit report in
19:569:47398:21:20:71:539:583:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:2007. There are391;000individuals with a credit report on average per district. By examining
19:570:47490:20:20:71:539:563:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the nonlinearity in the slope, the Ögures show that politicians start responding in terms of voting
19:571:47589:20:21:71:539:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:patterns when at least3:5%of individuals with a credit report start to default.24While there
19:572:47681:21:20:71:539:522:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are obvious limitations in focusing on the extensive margin, these Ögures appear reasonable. The
19:573:47777:20:20:71:540:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:number of a§ected voters tipping the politician voting behavior is0:035-391;000 = 13;685individ-
19:574:47873:20:21:71:539:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:uals. Given an average pivotal group size in congressional elections of40;000voters, this estimate
19:575:47971:21:20:71:539:461:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:suggests that representatives begin responding to subconstituencies when they reach a third of the
19:576:48069:20:36:71:197:441:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:average pivotal group size.
19:577:48096:36:28:71:361:405:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:5.2  Precision in Targeting Constituent Interests
19:578:48145:28:20:71:539:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Table 4 shows that the mortgage default rate as of 2007 leads to votes in favor of the AHRFPA, even
19:579:48244:20:20:71:539:357:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:after controlling for ideology and district demographic characteristics. In Table 5, we show further
19:580:48344:20:20:71:539:337:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:evidence that representatives are extremely precise in targeting constituent interests. An advantage
19:581:48444:20:21:71:539:317:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of the Equifax data on defaults is that we have disaggregated default rates on all consumer debt. As
19:582:48544:21:16:71:539:296:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a result, we are able to test whether voting behavior by Republicans responds to general consumer
19:583:48641:16:20:80:539:280:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:22Such an analysis ignores the negative externality stemming from mortgage defaults due to the negative e§ect of
19:584:48753:20:16:72:540:260:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:foreclosures on local house prices. As a result, the extensive margin analysis underestimates the size of the population
19:585:48873:16:17:72:540:244:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:impacted and therefore delivers only lower bound estimates. For this reason, the best measure of constituent interests
19:586:48991:17:16:72:540:227:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:is the mortgage default rate, which more accurately reáects both the depth of the crisis for mortgage defaulters and
19:587:49107:16:9:72:298:211:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:the externatility imposed on other voters in the district.
19:588:49165:9:20:80:539:202:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:23The main measurement worry is that some voters have multiple mortgage accounts. However, the number of
19:589:49269:20:17:72:540:182:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:mortgage accounts is likely a good proxy for the number of voters with a mortgage. First, Equifax separates home
19:590:49381:17:16:72:540:165:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:equity loans as distinct accounts, so only people who take a second mortgage out on their house would have more
19:591:49492:16:17:72:540:149:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:than one mortgage account.  Yamashita (2007) reports from the 1998 SCF that11%of the total population has
19:592:49597:17:16:72:539:132:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:a second mortgage (16%of homeowners). Second, the average number of mortgage accounts per consumer in the
19:593:49702:16:9:72:493:116:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:Equifax data is0:51. The average number of households in the SCF with some type of mortgage is0:48.
19:594:49801:9:20:80:540:107:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:24We employ winsorization at5%of the right tale to minimize the weight of outliers at the right tail of the default
19:595:49916:20:0:72:122:87:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:distribution.

20:597:50020:20:20:88:539:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Panel A shows that default rates across di§erent types of consumer credit are very highly
20:598:50109:20:21:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:correlated. For example, the mortgage default rate is highly correlated with the auto default rate
20:599:50207:21:20:72:540:644:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(0:66) and the credit card default rate (0:58). All correlations are highly statistically signiÖcant.
20:600:50308:20:20:72:540:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Given these high correlations, one might conclude that it would be di¢ cult for representatives to
20:601:50406:20:21:72:404:604:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distinguish general consumer credit di¢ culty from mortgage defaults.
20:602:50475:21:20:88:539:583:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Panel B shows that representatives are extremely responsive to the home default rate (which
20:603:50566:20:20:72:540:563:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:includes mortgage and home equity defaults), even after controlling for the non-home default rate
20:604:50663:20:21:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(which includes defaults on credit card debt, auto loans, consumer loans, and student loans). The
20:605:50760:21:20:72:540:522:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimate in Column 1 implies that a one standard deviation increase in the home default rate leads
20:606:50858:20:20:72:540:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to a16:5percentage point increase in the likelihood of voting for the AHRFPA. The estimation also
20:607:50955:20:21:72:540:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:shows that the non-home default rate has no predictive power in explaining votes on the AHRFPA.
20:608:51050:21:20:72:540:461:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Further we show that precision in targeting distressed home borrowers is robust to a number of
20:609:51144:20:20:72:540:441:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:controls in Columns 2 and 3. Taken together, the results in Panels A and B show that despite the
20:610:51240:20:21:72:540:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:high correlation between general consumer credit di¢ culty and mortgage defaults across districts,
20:611:51338:21:20:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:politicians appear to respond uniquely to mortgage defaults when deciding whether or not to vote
20:612:51434:20:36:72:157:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for the AHRFPA.
20:613:51449:36:27:72:386:344:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:5.3  Responding to Voting Bloc within Constituency
20:614:51499:27:21:72:540:317:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The ìdual constituencyî hypothesis (Fiorina (1974)) posits that politicians respond more to the
20:615:51594:21:20:72:540:296:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:interests of their own supporters within their overall constituency. This hypothesis is di¢ cult to
20:616:51693:20:20:72:540:276:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:test given that such a test would require constituent interest variables that are measured separately
20:617:51794:20:21:72:540:256:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for a politiciansísupporters and non-supporters within their electorate. Our unique advantage in
20:618:51890:21:20:72:540:235:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:this regard is zip code level information on mortgage defaults and zip code level voter registration
20:619:51990:20:20:72:540:215:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:data. This allows us to construct a Democratic and Republican mortgage default rate for each
20:620:52082:20:21:72:540:195:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Congressional district, where the default rates are constructed using the fraction of registered
20:621:52178:21:20:72:305:174:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Democrats and Republicans within each district.
20:622:52225:20:20:88:539:154:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:However, one drawback with only having zip code level data is the high correlation between
20:623:52315:20:21:72:540:134:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the Democratic and Republican mortgage default rates within each Congressional district. More
20:624:52408:21:20:72:540:113:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:speciÖcally, there will be perfect correlation between the two default rates within a district if either of
20:625:52515:20:0:72:540:93:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the following two conditions hold: (i) if the default rate is constant across all zip codes in the district
21:626:52624:0:20:72:540:705:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:or (ii) if the fraction of registered Republicans and registered Democrats is constant across all zip
21:627:52725:20:20:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:codes within the district. The correlation coe¢ cient for the Democratic and Republican mortgage
21:628:52821:20:21:72:539:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:default rates in our sample is0:90. Figure 2 shows this more directly; it presents the histogram of the
21:629:52924:21:20:72:540:644:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:di§erence across Congressional districts in the Democratic and Republican mortgage default rates.
21:630:53021:20:20:72:540:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:As Figure 2 shows, the majority of the Districts are close to0, which implies no di§erence between
21:631:53119:20:21:72:540:604:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the two default rates. It is clear from Figure 2 that inclusion of both the Democratic and Republican
21:632:53220:21:20:72:540:583:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mortgage default rates within the same regression will su§er from serious multicollinearity problems.
21:633:53321:20:20:88:539:563:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Despite this collinearity problem, we Önd evidence in Table 6 that Republican politicians are
21:634:53414:20:21:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:more responsive to Republican default rates than Democratic default rates. While the coe¢ cient
21:635:53509:21:20:72:540:522:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on Republican default rate is weak in Column 1 in the full sample due to multicollinearity, the
21:636:53604:20:20:72:455:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:coe¢ cient becomes signiÖcant with the addition of controls in Columns 2 and 3.
21:637:53683:20:21:88:539:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Columns 4 attempts to reduce the collinearity problem by estimating the speciÖcation on only
21:638:53775:21:20:72:540:461:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the sample of districts above the median in the absolute di§erence between the Republican and
21:639:53868:20:20:72:540:441:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Democratic mortgage default rates. In this speciÖcation, we Önd strong evidence that Republican
21:640:53963:20:21:72:540:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:politicians only respond to registered Republican mortgage default rates. Column 5 repeats the
21:641:54057:21:20:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:same exercise, but splits the default rate coe¢ cient by the median of the absolute default rate
21:642:54153:20:20:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:di§erence. The point of this exercise is to show that the standard error estimate for the sample
21:643:54249:20:21:72:540:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:below the median of the absolute default rate di§erence blows up as one would expect given the
21:644:54343:21:20:72:540:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:collinearity problems discussed above. In contrast, the coe¢ cient estimates show a unique reaction
21:645:54442:20:20:72:540:319:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to Republican default rates in the sample above the median of the absolute default rate di§erence.
21:646:54540:20:21:72:540:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Column 6 shows the robustness of this result to political and census controls. Columns 4 through

21:648:54734:20:36:72:352:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:interests of their own supporters within their constituency.

21:650:54846:27:21:72:540:195:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The previous three subsections demonstrate that an important determinant of Congressional voting
21:651:54942:21:20:72:540:174:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:behavior on the AHRFPA is constituent interests. In this subsection, we show that the e§ect of
21:652:55036:20:20:72:487:154:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:constituent interests is stronger when the representative faces a more competitive race.
21:653:55124:20:21:88:539:134:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In Table 7, the primary measure of electoral competition is the margin of victory for the incum-
21:654:55220:21:20:72:540:113:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:bent in the previous Congressional election (November 2006). We focus in particular on districts
21:655:55316:20:0:72:540:93:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:where the margin of victory was quite low (less than6%), given that there is likely not a di§erence
22:656:55417:0:20:72:540:705:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in electoral competition in districts where the margins are relatively large. For the results reported
22:657:55519:20:20:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in Columns 1, 2, and 3, we create indicator variables for competitive districts, where competitive
22:658:55617:20:21:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is deÖned as a margin of victory of2%(10districts),4%(18districts), and6%(23districts),
22:659:55704:21:20:72:540:644:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:respectively. We then interact the competitive district indicator variable with the mortgage default
22:660:55804:20:20:72:540:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rate as of the end of 2007. As the results demonstrate, the e§ect of constituent interests is stronger
22:661:55906:20:21:72:540:604:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in competitive districts. The interaction e§ect is particularly strong when competitive is measured
22:662:56005:21:20:72:540:583:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:narrowly as a margin of victory below4%, and it weakens when competitive is measured more
22:663:56094:20:20:72:539:563:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:broadly as a margin of victory below6%. The quantitative e§ects when focusing on close races
22:664:56186:20:21:72:539:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are strong, with coe¢ cients on the interaction terms above100%of the level.  The e§ect of of
22:665:56279:21:20:72:369:522:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:constituent interests on voting patterns doubles in close races.
22:666:56343:20:20:88:540:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In Column 4, we deÖne the competitive district variable as0if the previous margin of victory
22:667:56435:20:21:72:539:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is over30%, and0:30minus the margin of victory if the margin of victory is less than30%. For
22:668:56527:21:20:72:540:461:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:example, if the margin of victory in the 2006 election is5%, the competitive district variable takes
22:669:56627:20:20:72:539:441:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on the value0:25. This functional form is a convex in the margin of victory and is meant to capture
22:670:56726:20:21:72:540:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the fact that districts with large margins are unlikely to be competitive regardless of whether the
22:671:56825:21:20:72:539:400:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:margin is30or more. The results in Column 4 again suggest that constituent interests matter more
22:672:56921:20:20:72:254:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in districts that are more competitive.
22:673:56960:20:21:88:539:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In Column 5, we deÖne a competitive district as any district in a 2008 Presidential election
22:674:57052:21:20:72:540:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:swing state. The motivation behind this test is the argument that these districts are likely to face
22:675:57152:20:20:72:540:319:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:heightened voter and media attention given the importance of the presidential election between
22:676:57246:20:21:72:539:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:John McCain and Barack Obama.25As the results in Column 5 demonstrate, Republicans are
22:677:57332:21:20:72:540:278:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:more responsive to constituent interests if they are in a presidential swing state. The swing state
22:678:57431:20:20:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:e§ect is economically large: Voting behavior on the AHRFPA is twice as sensitive to default rates
22:679:57528:20:21:72:287:238:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for Republicans in a presidential swing state.
22:680:57574:21:20:88:539:217:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Overall the results in Table 7 suggest that a primary channel through which constituent interests
22:681:57671:20:20:72:540:197:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a§ect politician voting behavior is electoral competition.  When representatives face a greater
22:682:57766:20:21:72:540:177:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:probability of losing in the 2008 election, they are more likely to respond to high mortgage default
22:683:57866:21:15:72:268:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rates by voting in favor of the AHRFPA.
22:684:57905:15:21:80:539:141:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:25The swing states are deÖned according to http://www.Övethirtyeight.com as of July 17th 2008. Swing states
22:685:58012:21:16:72:540:120:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:include Ohio, Missouri, Michigan, Florida, North Carolina, Nevada, Indiana, Montana, Virginia, Colorado, and New
22:686:58124:16:0:72:435:104:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:Mexico. Our results are slightly stronger if Pennsylvania is also included as a swing state.
23:687:58218:0:31:72:464:705:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:6  The EESA of 2008 and the Role of Special Interests
23:688:58271:31:20:72:540:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:This section examines how special interests a§ect Congressional voting patterns on the EESA of
23:689:58365:20:21:72:540:654:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:2008. Our main focus is on votes in the 681 roll call on October 3rd, 2008. However, we also
23:690:58457:21:20:72:540:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:examine votes in the 674 roll call on September 29th, 2008. Given that the EESA represents a
23:691:58549:20:20:72:540:613:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:major transfer of wealth from tax payers to the Önancial services industry, we measure special
23:692:58643:20:21:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:interest ináuence through the amount of campaign contributions by the Önancial services industry
23:693:58739:21:20:72:540:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to politicians. In addition to the mortgage default rate, we also measure constituent interests with
23:694:58839:20:20:72:540:552:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the fraction of constituents that work in the Önancial services industry, and the fraction that have
23:695:58939:20:20:72:303:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:annual household income greater than$200;000.
23:696:58984:20:21:88:539:512:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Table 8 presents voting patterns by political party. In contrast to the AHRFPA vote in July,
23:697:59076:21:20:71:540:491:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the EESA vote involves signiÖcant variation in voting patterns for both parties. Almost75%of
23:698:59168:20:20:71:540:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Democrats voted for the EESA on October 3rd, whereas only45%of Republicans voted in favor.
23:699:59258:20:21:71:540:451:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:These numbers increased from60%for Democrats and25%for Republicans on the September
23:700:59341:21:20:71:539:430:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:29th vote. Panel C shows that the direction of ìswitchingî between the two roll calls is almost
23:701:59436:20:20:71:539:410:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:completely in one direction. Of the59representatives that switched votes,58switched from voting
23:702:59531:20:36:71:365:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:against on September 29th to voting in favor on October 3rd.
23:703:59591:36:28:71:400:354:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:6.1  The E§ect of Special Interests: Baseline Estimates
23:704:59646:28:20:71:539:326:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Figure 3 shows one of the central results of this subsection. There is a strong positive relation
23:705:59743:20:20:71:539:306:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:between the amount of Önancial service industry campaign contributions received by a politician
23:706:59838:20:20:71:539:286:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and the probability of voting for the EESA of 2008. The e§ect is strongest at the lower end of
23:707:59932:20:21:71:539:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the campaign contribution distribution, and slightly levels o§ at the higher end of the campaign
23:708:60028:21:20:71:192:245:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:contribution distribution.
23:709:60054:20:20:88:539:225:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Table 9A examines this result in a regression context. The linear probability estimate in Column
23:710:60150:20:21:71:539:205:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:1 shows that campaign contributions by the Önancial services industry has a strong positive e§ect on
23:711:60250:21:20:71:539:184:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the probability of voting in favor of the EESA. The coe¢ cient estimate implies that a one standard
23:712:60349:20:20:71:540:164:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:deviation increase in the log of contributions per cycle (1:76) is associated with a10percentage
23:713:60445:20:21:71:539:144:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:point increase in the probability of voting for the legislation. The estimate is robust to the inclusion
23:714:60549:21:20:71:539:123:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of political ideology. Not surprisingly, increasing the conservativeness of politician ideology has a
23:715:60650:20:20:71:539:103:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:strong negative e§ect on the probability of voting for the legislation. The mortgage default rate
23:716:60747:20:0:71:451:83:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:within the district has no signiÖcant ináuence on voting patterns on the EESA.
24:717:60827:0:20:88:539:705:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In Column 2, we include an indicator variable for whether the politician is a Republican. With
24:718:60921:20:20:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the inclusion of the politician ideology variable, party a¢ liation has no signiÖcant impact on voting
24:719:61023:20:21:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:patterns. In Columns 3 and 4, we add additional political and census demographic control vari-
24:720:61117:21:20:72:540:644:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ables, which slightly increase the magnitude of the estimate on Önancial services industry campaign
24:721:61216:20:20:72:138:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:contributions.
24:722:61230:20:21:88:539:604:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:An important concern in interpreting these results is causality of political contributions.  A
24:723:61324:21:20:72:540:583:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:substantial literature in political economy has emphasized how political contributions and congres-
24:724:61423:20:20:72:540:563:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sional voting may be jointly determined (Stratmann (1991) and (2002)), hence casting doubts on
24:725:61517:20:21:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the causal nature of estimates from a single-equation model as the one estimated in Table 9A. This
24:726:61615:21:20:72:540:522:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:concern can be relieved through an instrumental variable approach, which has been an unsuccessful
24:727:61712:20:20:72:540:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:avenue so far in the literature. Columns 2 through 4 rely on a more intuitive approach: sensitivity
24:728:61811:20:21:72:540:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:analysis. The impact of campaign contributions on the EESA is remarkably robust to the inclusion
24:729:61907:21:20:72:540:461:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of several reasonable proxies for ìunderlying driversî, such as the ideological stance of the politi-
24:730:62008:20:20:72:540:441:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cian, tenure in o¢ ce, or Financial Services Committee status. In all likelihood, were our results
24:731:62106:20:21:72:540:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:exclusively driven by the fact that politicians exogenously aligned with the Önancial sector are also
24:732:62207:21:20:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:favorite targets of Önancial industry contributions, the coe¢ cient magnitudes should drop or change
24:733:62307:20:20:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:substantially across speciÖcations. They do not. This points to a stable and sizeable direct e§ect
24:734:62405:20:21:72:540:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of special interest pressure on the passage of EESA. While we are cautious in our interpretation,
24:735:62502:21:20:72:442:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the evidence suggests that campaign contributions ináuenced the EESA vote.
24:736:62576:20:20:88:539:319:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:A Önal possible concern with the coe¢ cient estimate on Önancial services industry campaign
24:737:62667:20:21:72:540:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:contributions is that these contributions proxy for constituent interests through an employment
24:738:62762:21:20:72:540:278:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:channel. Bombardini and Trebbi (2008a) focus on how the employment and money channels may be
24:739:62854:20:20:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:simultaneously at play in ináuencing policymakers. To investigate this hypothesis, the speciÖcations
24:740:62954:20:21:72:540:238:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:reported in Columns 5 through 7 include the share of the district population employed in the
24:741:63046:21:20:72:539:217:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Önancial services industry and the share with annual household income greater than$200;000.
24:742:63137:20:20:72:540:197:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:There is strong evidence that representatives are more likely to vote in favor of the EESA if a
24:743:63232:20:21:72:540:177:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:higher fraction of their constituency is employed in the Önancial services industry. However, the
24:744:63329:21:20:72:540:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:coe¢ cient estimate on our measure of special interests is only slightly smaller with the inclusion of
24:745:63431:20:20:72:540:136:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:these variables. In other words, campaign contributions a§ect voting behavior even after controlling
24:746:63531:20:0:72:282:116:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for a Önancial services employment channel.
25:747:63576:0:27:72:250:705:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:6.2  The Politics of Switching
25:748:63606:27:20:72:540:678:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:One advantage in the empirical study of the EESA is the proximity of two di§erent votes on the
25:749:63700:20:21:72:540:658:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:same legislation. This enables us to examine the determinants of ìswitchers,î or the politicians
25:750:63796:21:20:72:540:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that Örst vote against the bill on September 29th and then for the bill on October 3rd. As shown
25:751:63892:20:20:72:540:617:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:above in Table 8, there are58politicians that switch from against to for votes; the party breakdown
25:752:63991:20:21:72:249:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is32Democrats and26Republicans.
25:753:64022:21:20:88:539:576:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In Columns 1 through 3 of Table 9B, we show that the basic determinants of votes in favor of
25:754:64114:20:20:72:540:556:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the EESA in the September 29th, 2008 roll call are similar to the determinants of votes in favor
25:755:64210:20:21:72:540:536:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on October 3rd, 2008. As in the October 3rd roll call, conservative politicians are less likely to
25:756:64308:21:20:72:540:515:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:vote for the legislation, and politicians that receive large amounts of campaign contributions from
25:757:64407:20:20:72:540:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the Önancial services industry are more likely to vote in favor of the legislation. One di§erence is
25:758:64507:20:21:72:540:475:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that the coe¢ cient estimate on the fraction of employees working in the Önancial industry is not
25:759:64604:21:20:72:273:454:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:signiÖcant in the September 29th roll call.
25:760:64647:20:20:88:539:434:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In Column 4, we examine the determinants of switching votes in the October 3rd roll call. We
25:761:64739:20:21:72:540:414:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:isolate the sample to representatives that vote against the legislation on September 29th, 2008. The
25:762:64839:21:20:72:540:393:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimates in Column 4 suggest that constituent interests, special interests, and ideology all a§ect
25:763:64938:20:20:72:540:373:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the decision to switch votes. Politicians with higher mortgage default rates and a higher fraction

25:765:65135:21:20:72:540:332:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:conservative politicians are less likely to switch votes. In addition, politicians that receive higher
25:766:65237:20:20:72:540:312:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:campaign contributions from the Önancial services industry are also more likely to switch to voting
25:767:65336:20:21:72:158:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for the legislation.
25:768:65356:21:20:88:539:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In Columns 5 and 6, we split the sample to separately examine Democrats and Republicans,
25:769:65444:20:20:72:540:251:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:respectively. Democrats with high mortgage default rates and with a high amount of campaign
25:770:65535:20:21:72:540:231:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:contributions from the Önancial services industry are more likely to switch to voting in favor of the
25:771:65636:21:20:72:540:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:legislation. For Republicans, only the fraction of constituents working in the Önancial industry is
25:772:65735:20:43:72:352:190:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a signiÖcant determinant of which politicians switch votes.

25:774:65856:31:21:72:540:116:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:One of the main advantages of our analysis is the ability to isolate the e§ects of ideology from
25:775:65952:21:0:72:540:95:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:constituent and special interests on politician voting behavior. In Section 5, we show that con-
26:776:66050:0:20:72:540:705:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:stituent interests ináuence voting patterns on the AHRFPA even after controlling for politician
26:777:66145:20:20:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ideology. In Section 6, we show that special interests ináuence voting patterns on the EESA even
26:778:66241:20:21:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:after controlling for politician ideology. In this section, we explore whether there is an interaction
26:779:66343:21:20:72:540:644:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:e§ect: that is, are politicians that are ideologically extreme more or less sensitive to constituent
26:780:66443:20:36:72:172:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and special interests.
26:781:66465:36:40:72:261:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:7.1  Empirical Model Revisited
26:782:66495:40:20:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The empirical model introduced above in Section 3 produces a linear-in-covariates speciÖcation
26:783:66589:20:20:72:540:528:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that we implement in the two sections above. In this simple model, there is no interaction between
26:784:66687:20:21:72:540:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ideological and economic incentives of politicians. In other words, after controlling for ideology,
26:785:66786:21:20:72:540:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:all politicians respond equally to constituent and special interests. In reality, such an interaction
26:786:66887:20:20:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is likely to be present in politician decision-making.  The most simple example is one in which
26:787:66982:20:21:72:540:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ideology enters the politicianís utility function in such a way that ideologically extreme politicians
26:788:67084:21:20:72:540:426:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are less sensitive to the desires of constituents and industry lobbyists. Indeed, one could argue that
26:789:67186:20:20:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the very deÖnition of being ideological is the characteristic of believing in certain policies regardless
26:790:67291:20:20:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of the economic incentives that push against the beliefs. This ìpolitician preferenceî hypothesis
26:791:67388:20:21:72:540:366:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:suggests that ideologically extreme politicians may be less responsive in their voting patterns to
26:792:67486:21:20:72:406:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mortgage default rates and Önancial industry campaign contributions.
26:793:67554:20:20:88:539:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:There is, however, a more subtle reason that ideologically extreme politicians may be less
26:794:67644:20:21:72:542:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:responsive to constituent and special interests, which we refer to as the ìconstituent ideologyî
26:795:67740:21:20:72:540:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:hypothesis.  Building on the model in Section 3, assume that higherIDipoliticians represent
26:796:67831:20:20:71:539:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:districts with voters characterized by equally strong ideological opposition to the bill (idi), where
26:797:67932:20:21:71:540:244:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f2:B:idi=-IDi,- >0:A Republican from a district ideologically against the AHRFPA or the EESA
26:798:68019:21:20:71:539:223:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:bailout represents voters against the bailout. This has an important implication for the probability
26:799:68119:20:20:71:184:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of reelection functiong.
26:800:68143:20:21:88:539:183:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:While avi= 1vote induces the support of votersCIiand the accrual ofSIicontributions, voters
26:801:68234:21:20:72:540:162:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ideologically opposed to the bill will turn out against the incumbent (or withdraw their support).
26:802:68332:20:20:72:540:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:A ìYeaî vote does not just attract supporters of the bill, but also opponents, and progressively
26:803:68428:20:21:72:540:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:more, the stronger is the intensity of opposition. Assume for simplicity that for every additional
26:804:68526:21:0:72:539:101:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:voter thatCIidelivers andSIisways there is a probabilityidiof an opposing voter showing up at
27:805:68621:0:31:72:418:705:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the polling booth.26This implies that the (net) reelection probability is:
27:806:68695:31:31:195:416:674:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:?:g(vi) = (\f1CIi-vi+\f2SIi-vi)-(1-idi-vi)
27:807:68735:31:21:71:539:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:andg(1) = (\f1CIi+\f2SIi)-(1--IDi). This expression delivers two intuitive e§ects. First, Öxing
27:808:68830:21:20:71:539:622:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the number of voters in default, a higher number of voters ideologically opposing the bill lowers the
27:809:68931:20:20:71:540:602:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:electoral advantage of voting for the bill. The advantage of an extraCIivoter for a politician from
27:810:69030:20:21:71:540:582:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a strongly conservative district (highID) is lower than the advantage of an extraCIivoter for a
27:811:69125:21:20:71:540:561:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:politician from a more liberal (lowID) district. A portionidiof the additional ballots cast in favor
27:812:69225:20:20:71:539:541:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ofiwill be eroded by opposing ideological voters which would otherwise support the incumbent.
27:813:69318:20:21:71:539:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Second, the impact of an additional dollar of campaign contributions is lower in districts with
27:814:69413:21:20:71:539:500:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:stronger ideological opposition. This implies that a ìYeaîvote from a more ideologically extreme
27:815:69509:20:20:71:539:480:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:representative will be increasingly more expensive than the vote of a more moderate representative.
27:816:69608:20:32:71:243:460:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The choice of a ìYeaîvote becomes

27:828:69854:20:21:71:539:357:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:therefore motivate including in the regression speciÖcations interaction terms of ideology with con-

27:839:70236:20:20:88:539:186:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Both the politician preference and the constituent ideology hypotheses suggest that there may
27:840:70329:20:21:71:539:166:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:be an interaction e§ect where ideologically extreme politicians respond less to constituent and
27:841:70424:21:16:71:391:145:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:special interests. We examine these hypotheses in the next section.
27:842:70491:16:20:80:539:129:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:26The choice ofidas a probability of upset voters showing up on election day is not restrictive for our reduced-form
27:843:70607:20:16:72:540:109:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:model. However a structural estimation of the relection probability function would require further assumptions on

28:845:70735:0:27:72:276:705:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:7.2  Interaction Empirical Results
28:846:70769:27:20:72:540:678:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In Columns 1 through 3 of Table 10, we examine voting patterns of Republicans on the AHRFPA
28:847:70860:20:21:72:540:658:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with the inclusion of the interaction terms. The coe¢ cient estimate on the mortgage default rate
28:848:70957:21:20:72:540:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is signiÖcantly positive, which implies that politicians from districts with high mortgage default
28:849:71055:20:20:72:540:617:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rates are more likely to vote for the legislation. This is consistent with results shown in Section 5.1.
28:850:71159:20:21:72:540:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:However, the interaction term with ideology is signiÖcantly negative. This implies that politicians
28:851:71258:21:20:72:540:576:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from districts with a high mortgage default rate are less responsive if they have a conservative
28:852:71354:20:20:72:113:556:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ideology.
28:853:71363:20:21:88:539:536:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In order to evaluate the magnitude of the interaction e§ect, it is useful to examine the partial

28:858:71609:27:20:72:540:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:At the mean ideology score for Republicans (0:55), the partial derivative of a Yea vote with respect
28:859:71709:20:20:71:539:428:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to the mortgage default rate is5:1, which implies that a one standard deviation increase in default
28:860:71808:20:21:71:540:408:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rates leads to a10percentage point increase in the probability of voting for the AHRFPA. If we
28:861:71902:21:20:71:539:387:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:examine the ideology score at one standard deviation below the mean (more liberal), the partial
28:862:71997:20:20:71:539:367:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:derivative of a Yea vote with respect to the mortgage default rate is9:8, which implies that a
28:863:72091:20:21:71:540:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:one standard deviation increase in default rates leads to a18:7percentage point increase in the
28:864:72186:21:20:71:539:326:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:probability of a Yea vote on the AHRFPA. Finally, if we examine the partial derivative at one
28:865:72279:20:20:71:540:306:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:standard deviation above the mean (more conservative), the partial derivative is0:4, which implies
28:866:72377:20:20:71:539:286:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:no response in the probability of voting in favor of the legislation with respect to an increase in de-
28:867:72480:20:21:71:540:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:fault rates (0:007). These magnitudes suggest that conservative politicians vote against government
28:868:72579:21:20:71:402:245:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:intervention, even in the presence of heightened constituent interests.
28:869:72650:20:20:88:539:225:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In Columns 4 through 6, we conduct a similar exercise with EESA to evaluate the trade-o§ of
28:870:72741:20:21:71:539:205:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ideology and special interests. In these speciÖcations, the coe¢ cient estimate on special interests is
28:871:72844:21:20:71:539:184:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:positive and signiÖcant, but the coe¢ cient on the interaction term of ideology with special interests
28:872:72946:20:20:71:539:164:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is negative. In other words, politicians that receive large campaign contributions from the Önancial
28:873:73046:20:21:71:539:144:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:services industry are more likely to vote for the legislation (consistent with Table 9A), but the e§ect
28:874:73149:21:20:71:329:123:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is weaker if the politician is ideologically conservative.
28:875:73207:20:20:88:539:103:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Again, the easiest way to evaluate the magnitude is to examine the partial derivative with

29:891:74483:20:21:72:540:435:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:liberal and conservative are measured as being below and above the median ideology score, re-
29:892:74576:21:20:72:540:414:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:spectively.  The e§ect shown in Table 10 is robust across almost the entire distribution, and is
29:893:74672:20:20:72:539:394:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:particularly strong when default rates rise above0:07. The voting behavior of conservative Repub-
29:894:74769:20:21:72:486:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:licans is much less responsive to mortgage default rates relative to liberal Republicans.
29:895:74858:21:20:88:539:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 5 plots the analagous graph for all politicians voting on the EESA. Here, we split all
29:896:74951:20:20:72:540:333:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:politicians (not just Republicans) based on the median ideology score. Once again, the conservative
29:897:75050:20:21:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:politicians are less responsive to Önancial industry campaign contributions across almost the entire
29:898:75150:21:20:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distribution.  Interestingly, even conservatives appear to respond strongly to Önancial industry
29:899:75246:20:20:72:540:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:campaign contributions at the very low end of the distrubution, but it is important to remember that
29:900:75346:20:21:72:540:252:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:almost the entire mass of the distribution is between log Önancial industry campaign contribution

29:902:75534:20:20:72:540:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:almost no additional responsiveness to special interst campaign contributions in the heart of the

29:904:75646:21:20:88:539:170:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Taken together, the evidence in Table 10, Figure 4, and Figure 5 strongly supports the hypoth-
29:905:75740:20:20:72:540:150:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:esis that ideologically conservative politicians vote against government intervention even in the face
29:906:75842:20:16:72:540:130:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of a severe crisis in which constituent and special interests desire such intervention. These results
29:907:75943:16:20:80:539:114:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:27Given that the level of voting probabilities is quite di§erent across liberals (Democrats) and conservatives (Re-
29:908:76058:20:0:72:412:94:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:F:publicans) on the EESA, we have normalized the Y-axis to start at 0 for both plots.
30:909:76143:0:20:72:540:705:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:suggest that politicians may be able to commit ex-ante against government intervention, even in
30:910:76238:20:20:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the face of severe crises. Unfortunately, our empirical analysis is unable to distinguish between the
30:911:76339:20:21:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ìpolitician-preferenceîand the ìconstituent ideologyîhypotheses for this interaction, but we hope
30:912:76436:21:20:72:380:644:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:these results are the basis for further research into this question.
30:913:76504:20:20:88:539:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:An intersting implication of these results is as follows: if special interests want to maximize the
30:914:76603:20:21:72:540:604:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:impact of their campaign contributions, they should give more money to representatives with the
30:915:76698:21:20:72:540:583:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ìlowest priceî, i.e. moderate or centrist Republicans. For exactly the same reason, we can anticipate
30:916:76799:20:20:72:540:563:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that special interests will also target moderate Democrats more than ideological liberals since
30:917:76894:20:21:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:centrist Democrats are easier to sway when the Önance industry wants less government involvement.
30:918:76991:21:20:72:540:522:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Therefore, an implication of our trade-o§ results is that we should observe an inverted-U shape
30:919:77086:20:20:72:540:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:pattern between Önancial industry campaign contributions and political ideology. This is exactly
30:920:77182:20:21:72:540:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:what we Önd in Figure 6. A regression of log Önancial industry campaign contributions on the DW-
30:921:77278:21:20:72:540:461:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:nominate ideology score and its square term shows that the inverted U-shape pattern is statistically
30:922:77378:20:43:72:333:441:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:signiÖcant at the1%level (Table A2 in the appendix).
30:923:77430:43:31:72:174:398:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:8  Conclusion
30:924:77443:31:20:72:540:367:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We examine Congressional voting patterns on the AHRFPA of 2008 and the EESA of 2008, which
30:925:77533:20:21:72:540:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:represent two of the most signiÖcant pieces of federal legislation in U.S. economic history.  In
30:926:77629:21:20:72:540:326:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:contrast to previous studies in political economy, we are able to isolate the e§ects of constituent
30:927:77728:20:20:72:540:306:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and special interests on politician voting behavior, even after controlling for politician ideology. We
30:928:77831:20:20:72:540:286:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Önd that constituent interests strongly ináuence politician voting patterns on the AHRFPA, with
30:929:77926:20:21:72:540:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Republicans being more likely to vote in favor of the legislation if their district is experiencing high
30:930:78030:21:20:72:540:245:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mortgage default rates. Politicians are extremely precise in their response to constituent interests,
30:931:78131:20:20:72:540:225:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and they respond more strongly to their own supporters within the electorate. A likely channel
30:932:78225:20:21:72:540:205:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for the importance of constituent interests is electoral competition. In addition, special interest
30:933:78324:21:20:72:540:184:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:campaign contributions from the Önancial services industry is positively related to votes in favor of
30:934:78425:20:20:72:540:164:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the EESA. This result is robust to the inclusion of politician ideology, the fraction of the electorate
30:935:78528:20:21:72:540:144:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:employed by the Önancial services industry, and census demographic controls.  Our results are
30:936:78621:21:20:72:540:123:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:consistent with the hypothesis that politicians voted in favor of the EESA in part due to special
30:937:78718:20:20:72:397:103:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:interest campaign contributions from the Önancial services industry.
30:938:78786:20:0:88:539:83:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, we demonstrate the importance of the trade-o§ between politician ideology and height-
31:939:78882:0:20:72:540:705:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ened constituent and special interests. While politicians are ináuenced by constituent and special
31:940:78980:20:20:72:540:685:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:interests in their voting behavior, we Önd that the e§ect of constituent and special interests is
31:941:79077:20:21:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:signiÖcantly smaller for conservative politicians. This Önding suggests that conservatives stick to
31:942:79176:21:20:72:394:644:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:their political ideology even in the midst of a severe Önancial crisis.
31:943:79247:20:20:88:539:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Our research suggests further fruitful avenues of investigation. An interesting empirical question
31:944:79345:20:21:72:540:604:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:concerns linking the legislatorsíresponse during the crisis with the electoral response of voters in the

31:946:79546:20:20:72:540:563:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(troubled debtors/Önancial industry employees) may potentially arise even in presence of ex ante
31:947:79642:20:21:72:280:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:optimal voting decisions by representatives.
31:948:79686:21:20:88:539:522:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:A second avenue of investigation concerns the political economy of the mortgage expansion.
31:949:79776:20:20:72:540:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:While this analysis focuses on the response to the mortgage default crisis, a closely related area of
31:950:79877:20:21:72:540:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:future research is the political economy of the subprime mortgage credit expansion that preceded
31:951:79973:21:20:72:540:461:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the crisis. In particular, from 2000 to 2005, Mian, SuÖ and Trebbi (2008) show that the mortgage
31:952:80069:20:20:72:540:441:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:industry increasingly targets politicians from districts in which there are a high fraction of subprime
31:953:80172:20:21:72:540:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:borrowers. They also show that contributions from the mortgage bankers and brokers industry sys-
31:954:80268:21:20:72:540:400:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tematically predict cosponsorship of deregulating and industry-friendly bills. Preliminary Öndings
31:955:80366:20:20:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:suggest that our results here are a Örst step in a larger e§ort to understand the role of the U.S.
31:956:80464:20:0:72:339:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:government in the subprime mortgage credit expansion.
