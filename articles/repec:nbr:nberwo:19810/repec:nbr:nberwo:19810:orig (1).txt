2:26:1205:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The theoretical result that there are welfare gains from trade is a central tenet of international economics.
2:27:1314:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:In a class of trade models that satisfy a "gravity equation," the welfare gains from trade can be computed
2:28:1420:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:using only the open economy domestic trade share and the elasticity of trade with respect to variable
2:29:1521:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:trade costs. The measured welfare gains from trade from this quantitative approach are typically relatively
2:30:1628:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:modest. In this paper, we suggest a channel for welfare gains that this quantitative approach typically

2:32:1834:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:in which trade induces a reorganization of production that raises domestic productivity, we show that
2:33:1935:14:42:72:348:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the welfare gains from trade can become arbitrarily large.

3:49:2259:0:30:82:195:692:14:g_d0_f4:14:g_d0_f4:1  Introduction
3:50:2274:30:20:82:528:662:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:The theoretical result that there are gains from trade is a central tenet of international economics.
3:51:2375:20:20:82:528:642:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:Assuming perfect competition and no market failures, trade acts like a technological improvement that
3:52:2476:20:20:82:528:622:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:expands the set of feasible allocations and enables Pareto superior outcomes to be achieved. A recent
3:53:2577:20:20:82:528:602:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:body of research has sought to quantify the magnitude of these welfare gains. In a class of standard
3:54:2677:20:20:82:528:582:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:trade models that satisfy a constant elasticity ìgravity equation,îthe welfare gains from trade can be
3:55:2779:20:20:82:528:562:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:computed using only aggregate data: The open economy domestic trade share and the elasticity of
3:56:2874:20:20:82:528:542:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:trade with respect to variable trade costs (see Arkolakis, Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare 2012). One of
3:57:2975:20:20:82:528:522:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:the main Öndings from this literature is that the welfare gains from trade are relatively modest. For
3:58:3076:20:20:82:528:502:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:example, in a study of 19 OECD countries, Eaton and Kortum (2002) Önd that the welfare cost of
3:59:3170:20:20:82:293:482:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:moving to autarky ranges from 0.2-10.3 percent.
3:60:3217:20:19:97:528:462:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:Many extensions to this quantitative approach have been considered, including the introduction of
3:61:3314:19:20:82:528:443:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:input-output linkages (e.g. Caliendo and Parro 2012) and multiple sectors (e.g. Ossa 2012). Some
3:62:3410:20:20:82:528:423:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:of these extensions can substantially increase the predicted welfare gains from trade, as surveyed in
3:63:3511:20:20:82:528:403:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (2013), which reports a range of potential values for the welfare gains
3:64:3611:20:20:82:131:383:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:from trade.
3:65:3622:20:20:97:528:363:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:In this paper, we suggest a channel for welfare gains that the standard quantitative approach typically
3:66:3725:20:20:82:528:343:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:abstracts from: trade-induced changes in domestic productivity. Since domestic productivity directly
3:67:3825:20:20:82:528:323:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:a§ects welfare in both the closed and open economy (separately from trade áows and relative prices)
3:68:3924:20:20:82:528:303:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:it provides an additional potential channel for trade to a§ect welfare. We provide a simple example in
3:69:4026:20:20:82:524:283:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:which the contribution of this additional channel to the overall welfare gains from trade can be large.
3:70:4129:20:20:97:528:263:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.  Section 2 reviews a simple version of the
3:71:4224:20:20:82:528:243:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:standard quantitative approach and highlights its abstraction from trade-induced changes in domestic
3:72:4324:20:20:82:528:223:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:productivity.  Section 3 develops a simple extension in which trade leads to endogenous changes in
3:73:4422:20:32:82:449:203:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:domestic productivity through a re-organization of production. Section 4 concludes.

5:148:6529:29:20:82:528:630:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:To assess the rough magnitude of the implied welfare gains from trade, suppose that the domestic trade
5:149:6631:20:19:82:528:610:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:share is 80 percent (not unusual for a large country such as the United States) and the trade elasticity
5:150:6735:19:20:82:529:591:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:is--1 = 4(a central value among existing empirical estimates). For these values, the above formula
5:151:6833:20:20:82:402:571:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:predicts welfare gains from trade relative to autarky of around 6 percent.
5:152:6907:20:20:97:528:551:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:However, a crucial assumption behind this expression is that domestic productivity (here a para-
5:153:7003:20:20:82:528:531:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:meter) is constant (bTn=bAn). To the extent that domestic productivity is itself endogenous to trade,
5:154:7104:20:20:82:528:511:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:this potential source of welfare gains is not captured. If such trade-induced productivity growth is re-
5:155:7208:20:20:82:528:491:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:lated to the domestic trade share, the above approach can be amended to incorporate this relationship.
5:156:7310:20:20:82:528:471:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:However, in this case, the functional form relating productivity to the domestic trade share becomes
5:157:7410:20:20:82:528:451:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:important for evaluating the welfare gains from trade. In the following section, we develop one set of
5:158:7512:20:20:82:528:431:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:microfoundations for trade-induced domestic productivity growth. But the idea is much more general.
5:159:7611:20:20:82:528:411:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:It applies to any mechanism through which trade a§ects domestic productivity: technology adoption,

7:282:11466:31:20:97:528:432:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:Trade has a fractal-like property in this model, in which there are gains from trade at each inter-
7:283:11565:20:20:82:528:412:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:mediate stage of production. If one falsely assumes a single stage of production, when production is in
7:284:11668:20:20:82:528:392:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:fact sequential, these gains from trade at each intermediate stage show up as an endogenous increase
7:285:11768:20:20:82:528:372:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:in measured domestic productivity. As the number of production stages converges towards inÖnity, the
7:286:11868:20:20:82:528:352:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:welfare gains from trade become arbitrarily large. This captures the idea that trade involves myriad
7:287:11968:20:19:82:528:332:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:changes in the organization of production throughout the economy and the welfare costs from forgoing
7:288:12068:19:20:82:262:313:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:this pervasive specialization can be large.
7:289:12111:20:20:97:528:293:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:As the domestic trade share for an individual production stage becomes arbitrarily small, the welfare
7:290:12212:20:20:82:528:273:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:gains from trade also become arbitrarily large. This captures the idea that some countries may have
7:291:12311:20:20:82:528:253:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:strong comparative advantages in some stages of production and the welfare losses from forgoing this
7:292:12411:20:20:82:528:233:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:specialization can be large. This result for sequential production has similarities and di§erences with
7:293:12514:20:20:82:528:213:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:Ossa (2012)ís result in a multi-sector model that the presence of sectors with low trade elasticities can
7:294:12619:20:20:82:528:193:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:generate large aggregate welfare gains from trade. In contrast, our result holds even if all production
7:295:12722:20:20:82:528:173:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:stages have the same trade elasticity, because each production stage has to be completed for the Önal
7:296:12823:20:20:82:175:153:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:good to be produced.
7:297:12843:20:20:97:528:133:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:Our analysis of sequential production is also related to models of ëroundaboutíproduction, in which
7:298:12942:20:20:82:528:113:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:intermediate inputs enter a Cobb-Douglas production technology through a single CES aggregate (e.g.

7:300:13133:20:20:82:528:73:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:suring the welfare gains from trade simply involves controlling for aggregate information on the share
7:301:13235:20:0:82:528:53:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:of intermediate inputs in production. In contrast, in our setting with sequential production, correctly
8:302:13339:0:20:82:528:692:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:computing the welfare gains from trade requires disaggregated information on domestic trade shares
8:303:13437:20:20:82:296:672:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:and trade elasticities for all stages of production.
8:304:13489:20:20:97:528:652:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:While for simplicity we develop these ideas in an Armington framework, the same analysis can be
8:305:13584:20:33:82:409:632:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:undertaken in for example the Eaton and Kortum (2002) Ricardian model.

8:307:13668:30:20:82:528:569:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:Substantial progress has been made in quantifying the welfare gains from trade using a class of theoret-
8:308:13772:20:20:82:528:549:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:ical models consistent with the gravity equation. These models are rich enough to speak to Örst-order
8:309:13873:20:20:82:528:529:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:features of the data, such as country-size and geography, and yet are parsimonious enough to permit
8:310:13972:20:20:82:528:509:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:model-based counterfactuals. They typically generate relatively modest welfare gains from trade. In
8:311:14071:20:20:82:528:489:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:this paper, we highlight a channel for trade to a§ect welfare that has received relatively little attention
8:312:14178:20:20:82:528:469:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:in this quantitative literature, namely endogenous changes in domestic productivity. Trade can induce
8:313:14279:20:19:82:528:449:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:a reorganization of production that elevates domestic productivity.  Incorporating such endogenous
8:314:14377:19:20:82:528:430:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:changes in production organization into a model of sequential production, we show that the welfare
8:315:14475:20:33:82:283:410:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:gains from trade can become arbitrarily large.
