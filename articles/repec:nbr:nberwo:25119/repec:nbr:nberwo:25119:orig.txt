2:41:2518:28:14:72:543:574:12:Times:12:Times:We prove that, for general demand and cost conditions and market structures, the fraction of first-
2:42:2617:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:best surplus that a monopolist is unable to extract in a market provides a tight upper bound on the 
2:43:2716:14:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:relative distortions  arising  from  firms'  equilibrium  decisions  at  all  margins  (entry  and  pricing). 
2:44:2825:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:Continuing with  this  worst-case  perspective,  we  show  that  a  symmetrically  truncated  Zipf 
2:45:2923:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:(STRZ) distribution of consumer values generates the lowest producer surplus among those with 
2:46:3016:14:14:72:546:504:12:Times:12:Times:a  given  mean  and  maximum value.  This  allows  us  to  relate  potential  deadweight  loss  from  all 
2:47:3121:14:14:72:546:490:12:Times:12:Times:margins  in  a  market  to  the  Zipf-similarity of  its  demand  curve.  The  STRZ  distribution  also 
2:48:3224:14:14:72:546:476:12:Times:12:Times:bounds  deadweight  loss  at  just  the  pricing  margin. We  leverage  existing  results  from  industrial 
2:49:3331:14:14:72:545:462:12:Times:12:Times:organization  (e.g.,  on  demand  curvature)  and  statistics (e.g.,  on  the  relation  between  means  and 
2:50:3439:14:14:72:546:448:12:Times:12:Times:medians) to bound producer surplus in an array of important special cases. Calibrations based on 
2:51:3535:14:14:72:545:434:12:Times:12:Times:the  world  distribution  of  income  generate  extremely  Zipf-similar demand  curves,  suggesting  a 
2:52:3637:14:14:72:545:420:12:Times:12:Times:large  potential  for  deadweight  loss  in  global  markets.  We  gauge  the  extent to  which  various 
2:53:3741:14:14:72:545:406:12:Times:12:Times:policies—such  as  progressive  taxation  or  price  discrimination—might  ameliorate this  potential 
2:54:3842:14:42:72:152:392:12:Times:12:Times:deadweight loss.

3:69:4114:0:26:72:168:708:206:Times:206:Times:1. Introduction
3:70:4129:26:18:72:538:682:119:Times:119:Times:Economists have an ambivalent view of producer surplus. On the one hand, high producer surplus may be
3:71:4230:18:19:72:537:664:119:Times:119:Times:indicative of high markups above marginal cost, resulting in large distortions measured by the Harberger
3:72:4334:19:18:72:537:645:119:Times:119:Times:triangle. On the other hand, producer surplus provides the incentives for investment in entry, capacity, and
3:73:4442:18:18:72:537:627:119:Times:119:Times:innovation that allow markets to exist and thrive. If firms cannot easily appropriate their investment returns,
3:74:4553:18:19:72:468:609:119:Times:119:Times:this may result in a different source of distortion—underinvestment relative to the first best.
3:75:4648:19:18:89:537:590:119:Times:119:Times:This paper contributes to an understanding of markets by studying them through the lens of the worst-
3:76:4749:18:18:72:538:572:119:Times:119:Times:case scenarios. How large can the distortions possibly be in a given market? Can their magnitude be related
3:77:4856:18:18:72:537:554:119:Times:119:Times:to a simple sufficient statistic? What is the source of this maximal distortion: above-cost prices, inefficient
3:78:4967:18:19:72:537:536:119:Times:119:Times:investment, or both? We show that the greatest potential deadweight loss is at the investment margin,
3:79:5068:19:18:72:537:517:119:Times:119:Times:determining the very existence of the market. We show quite generally that the amount of total surplus that
3:80:5175:18:18:72:536:499:119:Times:119:Times:a monopolist is unable to extract provides a tight upper bound on the maximum possible distortion in any
3:81:5279:18:19:72:537:481:119:Times:119:Times:given market. The monopoly bound also serves as a bound on distortions arising in a wide range of other,
3:82:5383:19:18:72:217:462:119:Times:119:Times:oligopolistic industrial structures.
3:83:5419:18:18:89:538:444:119:Times:119:Times:These results may be best understood in a simple numerical example, drawing on Romer (1994). Sup-
3:84:5516:18:19:72:537:426:119:Times:119:Times:pose a monopoly serves a market with linear demandQ(p)=1−pand constant marginal cost normalized to
3:85:5614:19:18:72:536:407:119:Times:119:Times:zero, shown in Figure 1. Equilibrium quantity is 1/2, price is 1/2, and producer surplus is 1/4 (the area of
3:86:5722:18:18:72:539:389:119:Times:119:Times:squareB). First-best surplus is 1/2 (the areas ofA,B, andC). Letkdenote the fixed cost that the firm needs
3:87:5828:18:18:72:537:371:119:Times:119:Times:to expend in order to enter the market. Consider the thought experiment of lettingkvary, tracing out the
3:88:5932:18:19:72:537:353:119:Times:119:Times:total distortion resulting from departures from both first-best product and pricing decisions. Ifk<1/4, then
3:89:6040:19:18:72:537:334:119:Times:119:Times:the product is produced both in equilibrium and in the first best. The only distortion is the Harberger triangle
3:90:6152:18:18:71:538:316:119:Times:119:Times:Cresulting from supra-competitive prices, the area of which is 1/8. Ifk>1/2, then there is no distortion
3:91:6256:18:18:72:537:298:119:Times:119:Times:in the market because nothing is produced either in the first best or in equilibrium. Ifk=1/4+-for small,
3:92:6361:18:19:71:536:280:119:Times:119:Times:positive-, the product is produced in the first best but not in equilibrium. The distortion then amounts to
3:93:6468:19:18:71:539:261:119:Times:119:Times:all of first-best welfare net ofk, i.e., 1/2−k=1/4−-. Deadweight loss increases as-decreases, coming
3:94:6568:18:18:72:536:243:119:Times:119:Times:arbitrarily close to 1/4 in the limit as-↓0. We conclude that up to half of first-best surplus can be lost
3:95:6674:18:19:72:538:225:119:Times:119:Times:because of inefficient investment incentives. While the “half” result is specific to this numerical example, a
3:96:6784:19:18:72:537:206:119:Times:119:Times:general principle is being illustrated here. Letρ∗denote the ratio of the monopolist’s to first-best surplus.
3:97:6893:18:18:71:539:188:119:Times:119:Times:Theorem 1 shows that the relative surplus the monopolist cannot extract, 1−ρ∗, provides a tight upper bound
3:98:7000:18:19:71:322:170:119:Times:119:Times:on relative deadweight loss for a general class of markets.
3:99:7059:19:18:89:537:151:119:Times:119:Times:The worst case for potential distortions has a variety of policy implications. For example, the worst case
3:100:7165:18:18:71:536:133:119:Times:119:Times:for distortions can be converted into an upper bound on the social gains from offering an optimal subsidy.
3:101:7271:18:18:71:537:115:119:Times:119:Times:In the numerical example, the government can obtain the first best by offering a subsidy of 1/2 for each
3:102:7375:18:19:71:537:97:119:Times:119:Times:unit sold at marginal cost, 0. If the firm accepts, enters, and sells to all consumers at 0, it ends up selling
3:103:7486:19:0:71:538:78:119:Times:119:Times:1 unit, earning profit net of R&D cost of 1/2−k=1/4−-fork=1/4+-. One can see that this policy

4:114:7624:34:19:72:537:468:119:Times:119:Times:leads the firm to make the first-best entry decision—entering if-<1/4 and not if->1/4—and the first-
4:115:7724:19:18:72:537:449:119:Times:119:Times:best pricing decision—charging price equal to marginal cost 0. The potential gains from this policy can
4:116:7827:18:18:72:537:431:119:Times:119:Times:come arbitrarily close to 1/4 assuming, as one would to attain an upper bound on gains, that there is no
4:117:7931:18:18:71:537:413:119:Times:119:Times:social cost of public funds beyond the dollar-for-dollar transfer from taxpayers. This 1/4 also bounds the
4:118:8037:18:19:72:538:395:119:Times:119:Times:potential social loss from banning price discrimination. At best, the firm can engage in first-degree price
4:119:8144:19:18:72:538:376:119:Times:119:Times:discrimination, generating social welfare 1/2−k, exceeding social welfare from linear pricing by an amount
4:120:8250:18:18:72:537:358:119:Times:119:Times:approaching 1/4. These policy implications generalize beyond this numerical example: Theorem 2 shows
4:121:8350:18:19:72:538:340:119:Times:119:Times:that the tight bound on deadweight loss, 1−ρ∗, also serves as a tight bound on the social gain from a subsidy
4:122:8459:19:18:71:437:321:119:Times:119:Times:and the social loss from a ban on price discrimination for a general class of markets.
4:123:8545:18:18:89:538:303:119:Times:119:Times:A series of additional theorems provide further generalizations. Theorem 3 generalizes the nature of the
4:124:8649:18:18:71:537:285:119:Times:119:Times:product-development costk, allowing a fractionβof it to be a socially neutral transfer (say a licensing fee or
4:125:8759:18:19:71:536:267:119:Times:119:Times:a bribe). The theorem shows that the potential for deadweight loss expands in proportion toβ. Theorems 4
4:126:8863:19:18:71:536:248:119:Times:119:Times:and 5 show that the bound derived for a monopoly is relevant to a quite broad range of oligopoly market
4:127:8966:18:18:71:116:230:119:Times:119:Times:structures.
4:128:8977:18:19:89:538:212:119:Times:119:Times:Our analysis of the numerical example so far has fixed the demand curve and asked how high the distor-
4:129:9079:19:18:71:536:193:119:Times:119:Times:tion could be in that market. In the spirit of worst-case analyses, it is natural to ask whether other demand
4:130:9188:18:18:71:537:175:119:Times:119:Times:curves could generate even greater distortions. Among demands with the same vertical intercept and total
4:131:9292:18:19:71:539:157:119:Times:119:Times:surplus as the given linear one, the one minimizing the producer-surplus ratioρ∗(and thus maximizing po-
4:132:9396:19:18:71:536:138:119:Times:119:Times:tential distortions) is shown in Figure 2 as the black curve superimposed over the grey linear demand. The
4:133:9502:18:18:71:537:120:119:Times:119:Times:difference in producer surplus is shown as the difference in the area of the shaded rectangles. The black
4:134:9607:18:18:71:537:102:119:Times:119:Times:demand curve is everywhere unit elastic, yielding the special property that no price is particularly attrac-
4:135:9715:18:0:71:537:84:119:Times:119:Times:tive for the monopolist because they all generate the same revenue (also the same producer surplus given

5:143:9861:34:18:72:538:468:119:Times:119:Times:marginal cost is zero). The consumer values underlying the black demand curve follow a Zipf distribution,
5:144:9966:18:18:72:537:450:119:Times:119:Times:with the property that each doubling of consumer value cuts the number of consumers with at least that
5:145:10068:18:19:72:538:432:119:Times:119:Times:value in half. It is truncated so that the ends match, hence the label—symmetrically truncated Zipf (STRZ)
5:146:10174:19:18:72:539:413:119:Times:64:Times:distribution—given to it in our previous work (Kremer and Snyder 2015), where it also played a key role.1
5:147:10279:18:18:72:537:395:119:Times:119:Times:The numerical example is admittedly special, involving unit intercepts and zero marginal cost, but for any
5:148:10385:18:18:72:537:377:119:Times:119:Times:constant marginal cost and any demand with finite intercepts, we derive a suitable rescaling such that the
5:149:10491:18:19:72:538:359:119:Times:119:Times:demand can be compared to its STRZ counterpart having the same intercepts and mean value. In this way,
5:150:10593:19:18:72:538:340:119:Times:119:Times:producer surplus for a large class of markets can be decomposed into the Zipf-similarity of the rescaled de-
5:151:10701:18:18:72:538:322:119:Times:119:Times:mand curve and the lower bound on producer surplus attained by the STRZ demand with that mean. As the
5:152:10802:18:19:72:538:304:119:Times:119:Times:rescaled mean (denotedμ) shrinks to 0, the producer-surplus ratio from a STRZ demand curve approaches
5:153:10903:19:18:72:537:285:119:Times:119:Times:0 and the bound on deadweight loss approaches 100% of total surplus. Thus the worst of the worst cases is
5:154:11008:18:18:72:519:267:119:Times:119:Times:a perfectly Zipf-similar demand curve with vanishingly small mean (relative to peak) consumer values.
5:155:11109:18:19:89:538:249:119:Times:119:Times:Given that the distribution of a wide range of economic variables—city size, firm size, income, wealth,
5:156:11212:19:18:72:539:230:119:Times:119:Times:CEO compensation, stock price changes, various international-tradeindexes—is approximately Zipf (Gabaix
5:157:11315:18:17:72:539:212:119:Times:119:Times:2009), demand in many real-world markets may have a STRZ-like shape. For example, the Zipf distribution
5:158:11418:17:14:84:537:195:49:Times:80:Times:1A growing economics literature proves a wide range of important results based on demand curves that, like STRZ demand in
5:159:11539:14:11:72:538:181:80:Times:80:Times:this paper, generate equal producer surplus whatever price is charged (alternately labeled truncated Pareto, unit-elasticity, equal-
5:160:11671:11:11:72:538:170:80:Times:80:Times:revenue, or extremal demand). The earliest published article in this literature appears to be Neeman (2003), who uses the con-
5:161:11797:11:11:72:537:159:80:Times:80:Times:struction to bound the effectiveness of English auctions in extracting bidder surplus. The idea first appears in our work in an early
5:162:11930:11:11:72:536:148:80:Times:80:Times:working-paper version (Kremer and Snyder 2003) of Kremer and Snyder (2015). Malueg and Snyder (2006) use a sequence of
5:163:12048:11:11:72:538:137:80:Times:80:Times:linear demands with the equal-revenue property to bound the ratio of profits from discriminatory to uniform pricing by a function
5:164:12177:11:11:72:537:126:80:Times:80:Times:of the number of markets. The demand curve that Brooks (2013) derives to generate the worst case for his belief survey auction is
5:165:12306:11:11:72:536:115:80:Times:80:Times:precisely the STRZ form. Bergemann, Brooks, and Morris (2014) show that any market can be represented as a convexcombina-
5:166:12427:11:11:72:537:104:80:Times:80:Times:tion of segmented markets with equal-revenue demands, allowing them to construct segmentations attaining arbitrary divisions of
5:167:12554:11:10:72:537:93:80:Times:80:Times:first-best surplus across the firm, consumers, and deadweight loss. A growing literature in computer science uses the construction
5:168:12684:10:11:72:537:83:80:Times:80:Times:to bound worst cases for approximately optimal mechanisms in various settings. See Hartline and Roughgarden (2009) for an early
5:169:12811:11:0:72:126:72:80:Times:80:Times:such reference.
6:170:12827:0:18:72:539:708:119:Times:119:Times:of income may lead individuals’ demand for cancer cures, pay-per-view television series, electronic gadgets,
6:171:12935:18:18:72:537:690:119:Times:119:Times:or professional sports tickets to have a STRZ shape. The Zipf distribution of city size may lead municipal
6:172:13041:18:18:72:540:672:119:Times:119:Times:demand for management software to have a STRZ shape. Facing a STRZ demand curve, a firm lacking
6:173:13136:18:19:72:538:654:119:Times:119:Times:the ability to price discriminate may be able to extract only a small share of consumer surplus, raising the
6:174:13244:19:18:72:537:635:119:Times:119:Times:possibility that in many different contexts socially valuable investments will not be undertaken. A natural
6:175:13351:18:18:72:537:617:119:Times:119:Times:policy response is to identify markets with Zipf-similar demands and target R&D subsidies there, or at least
6:176:13459:18:18:72:500:599:119:Times:119:Times:refrain from imposing policies such as banning price discrimination that would impair firm profits.
6:177:13558:18:19:89:538:581:119:Times:119:Times:As a proof of concept, in Section 7 we calibrate demand for some representative product based on the
6:178:13658:19:18:72:538:562:119:Times:119:Times:world distribution of income using the estimates from Pinkovskiy and Sala-i-Martin (2009). Calibrated
6:179:13759:18:18:72:539:544:119:Times:119:Times:demands indeed closely resemble STRZ worst cases; for the most recent year of income estimates, the
6:180:13858:18:19:72:537:526:119:Times:119:Times:Zipf-similarity of calibrated demand isZ=83%. Because it is so Zipf similar, and because the ratio of the
6:181:13963:19:18:72:537:507:119:Times:119:Times:mean to peak consumer value is so low, implying that the Zipf demand yields very little producer relative to
6:182:14071:18:18:72:537:489:119:Times:119:Times:total surplus, potential distortions are enormous with this demand curve. In the case of a good that can be
6:183:14178:18:19:72:538:471:119:Times:119:Times:produced at little or no marginal cost (software, digital media, some small-molecule drugs), deadweight loss
6:184:14286:19:18:72:537:452:119:Times:119:Times:can be as high as 72% of total surplus. A series of robustness checks (varying income elasticities, marginal
6:185:14394:18:18:72:538:434:119:Times:119:Times:costs, price indexes, data sources, and market regions) confirms that potential deadweight loss remains high
6:186:14502:18:18:72:539:416:119:Times:119:Times:for a broad range of cases. We also run a series of policy counterfactuals, analyzing the effect on potential
6:187:14611:18:19:72:537:398:119:Times:119:Times:deadweight loss of a ban on price discrimination, redistribution via a proportional tax, and redistribution
6:188:14718:19:18:72:319:379:119:Times:119:Times:from just the top 1% (or other precentiles) of consumers.
6:189:14775:18:18:89:536:361:119:Times:119:Times:While Zipf-similarity provides a sufficient statistic for potential deadweight loss that has the virtue of
6:190:14881:18:19:72:538:343:119:Times:119:Times:broad applicability, it can require numerical methods to compute. Section 6 leverages existing results from
6:191:14988:19:18:72:537:324:119:Times:119:Times:microtheory and statistics to provide analytical bounds in a rich set of specific cases. Anderson and Renault’s
6:192:15099:18:18:72:537:306:119:Times:119:Times:(2003) upper bound on the ratio of producer to total surplus as a function of the generalized curvature (c-
6:193:15206:18:19:72:538:288:119:Times:119:Times:concavity) of demand yields a bound on deadweight loss as an immediate corollary. Based on the simple
6:194:15307:19:18:72:537:269:119:Times:119:Times:observation that a monopolist can guarantee sales to at least half of the consumers by pricing at the median
6:195:15415:18:18:72:537:251:119:Times:119:Times:valuation, we provide a bound on the ratio of producer to total surplus that is related to the ratio of the
6:196:15522:18:18:72:537:233:119:Times:119:Times:median to the mean of a distribution. This allows us to leverage a rich statistics literature on the mean-
6:197:15628:18:19:72:538:215:119:Times:119:Times:median-mode inequality (including Runnenburg 1978, van Zwet 1978, Dharmadhikari and Joag-dev 1988,
6:198:15726:19:18:72:537:196:119:Times:119:Times:and Basu and DasGupta 1997) to provide a series of bounds on deadweight loss that applies to a variety of
6:199:15831:18:18:72:517:178:119:Times:119:Times:unimodal distributions. We also provide bounds for the beta, Pareto, and general discrete distributions.
6:200:15935:18:18:89:537:160:119:Times:119:Times:Turning the focus from distortions on the entry margin to distortions on the pricing margin conditional
6:201:16038:18:19:72:538:142:119:Times:119:Times:on entry, (we will label this Harberger deadweight loss because it is equal to the area of the Harberger
6:202:16142:19:18:72:538:123:119:Times:119:Times:triangle), the STRZ demand curve has useful implications for this source of deadweight loss as well. As we
6:203:16248:18:18:72:538:105:119:Times:119:Times:show in Section 5, Harberger deadweight loss is chaotic for a STRZ demand. There are multiple equilibria,
6:204:16353:18:0:72:537:87:119:Times:119:Times:one of which (the equilibrium in which only the highest-value consumers are served) attains the upper bound
7:205:16461:0:18:72:538:708:119:Times:119:Times:on Harberger deadweight loss for any market with that mean consumer value. However, a tiny shift in mass
7:206:16565:18:18:72:537:690:119:Times:119:Times:from high to low consumer values is enough to tip the market to a unique equilibrium with no Harberger
7:207:16667:18:18:72:537:672:119:Times:119:Times:deadweight loss. The policy implication is that Harberger deadweight loss is potentially huge in markets
7:208:16771:18:19:72:538:654:119:Times:119:Times:with Zipf-similar demands, but this inefficiency can be corrected at small cost to the policymaker with a
7:209:16876:19:18:72:134:635:119:Times:119:Times:small subsidy.
7:210:16890:18:18:89:537:617:119:Times:119:Times:This paper is most closely related to our own previous work on which it builds, Kremer and Snyder
7:211:16987:18:18:72:539:599:119:Times:119:Times:(2015). Our previous paper focused on pharmaceutical markets. In some simple cases, we were able to
7:212:17086:18:19:72:539:581:119:Times:64:g_d0_f8:bound the deadweight loss from the firm’s bias to produce a drug rather than a vaccine by 1−ρ∗, whereρ∗
7:213:17189:19:18:72:538:562:119:Times:119:Times:is the ratio of monopoly producer surplus to first-best surplus on the vaccine market. Here we show that
7:214:17293:18:18:72:538:544:119:Times:119:Times:the bound 1−ρ∗applies much more generally, beyond pharmaceuticals to any product market, and does not
7:215:17394:18:19:71:536:526:119:Times:119:Times:require the availability of two substitute products to serve the same market. In the previous paper, the bound
7:216:17504:19:18:71:536:507:119:Times:119:Times:on potential deadweight loss was much fuzzier outside of the simple case of a monopoly serving consumers
7:217:17608:18:18:71:539:489:119:Times:119:Times:who differ only in disease risk. The present paper shows that the sharp bound 1−ρ∗applies regardless of
7:218:17711:18:19:71:537:471:119:Times:119:Times:the factors determining consumer values and applies to a wide range of market structures beyond monopoly.
7:219:17816:19:18:71:536:452:119:Times:119:Times:We build on the derivation of STRZ demand in the previous paper, applying Zipf similarity to decompose
7:220:17918:18:18:71:536:434:119:Times:119:Times:changes in potential deadweight loss over time and applying the STRZ demand to bound Harberger dead-
7:221:18018:18:18:71:538:416:119:Times:119:Times:weight loss. The computation ofρ∗for the beta and Pareto distributions is new here, as are the bounds on
7:222:18122:18:19:71:538:398:119:g_d0_f7:119:Times:ρ∗leveraging results forc-concave demands and leveraging the mean-median-mode inequality. While the
7:223:18221:19:18:71:537:379:119:Times:119:Times:previous paper provided demand calibrations for HIV pharmaceuticals, the present paper calibrates global
7:224:18325:18:18:71:516:361:119:Times:64:Times:demand for a general product and uses the calibrations to conduct a variety of policy counterfactuals.2
7:225:18428:18:19:89:537:343:119:Times:119:Times:Our paper is close in spirit to Romer’s (1994) agenda-setting article. Although his focus is on the
7:226:18527:19:18:71:537:324:119:Times:119:Times:contribution of trade to developing economies, he makes the broader point, which we share, that product-
7:227:18631:18:18:71:536:306:119:Times:119:Times:market distortions on the extensive margin can overwhelm those on the intensive margin. In a sense our
7:228:18733:18:19:71:537:288:119:Times:119:Times:paper can be viewed as taking up his call for more formal modeling of basic ideas related to the market for
7:229:18840:19:18:71:536:269:119:Times:119:Times:new goods: “Formal theoretical analysis can contribute to our use of evidence largely by forcing us to make
7:230:18947:18:18:71:537:251:119:Times:119:Times:explicit the habits of mind that we take for granted” (Romer 1994, p. 36). Also philosophically related is
7:231:19053:18:18:71:537:233:119:Times:119:Times:the work of Makowski and Ostroy (1995, 2001). They provide perhaps the clearest statement of the idea
7:232:19154:18:19:71:537:215:119:Times:119:Times:that efficiency requires each agent to appropriate the returns from his investment. They show that price
7:233:19258:19:18:71:537:196:119:Times:119:Times:taking is not necessary for the efficiency of general equilibrium entailed by the first welfare theorem. Price
7:234:19368:18:18:71:535:178:119:Times:119:Times:taking is just one setting in which which agents appropriate their marginal contributions to social welfare;
7:235:19476:18:18:71:536:160:119:Times:119:Times:any other such setting—a single producer with small capacity auctioning goods to competing suppliers,
7:236:19577:18:17:71:537:142:119:Times:119:Times:etc.—will likewise generate the first best. Rather than looking at conditions for first-best efficiency, our
7:237:19685:17:15:84:537:125:49:Times:80:Times:2Each of the relevant section of results starts with a footnote detailing the precise connection between the propositions in Kremer
7:238:19816:15:11:72:537:110:80:Times:80:Times:and Snyder (2015) and this paper. Another of our related papers is Kremer and Snyder (2018), which uses some of the results in the
7:239:19946:11:11:72:538:99:80:Times:80:Times:present paper to bound deadweight loss in a calibration of the global market for an HIV pharmaceutical. It should be emphasized
7:240:20073:11:0:72:418:88:80:Times:80:Times:that Kremer and Snyder (2018) is the successor to rather than the antecedent of the present paper.
8:241:20172:0:18:72:536:708:119:Times:119:Times:paper contributes by looking at the flip side, conditions for the greatest distortions to arise. Consistent with
8:242:20284:18:18:72:537:690:119:Times:119:Times:Makowski and Ostroy’s perspective, we find that distortions are greatest when conditions for appropriability
8:243:20392:18:18:72:412:672:119:Times:119:Times:are worst; we characterize which demand shapes are worst for appropriability.
8:244:20469:18:19:89:538:654:119:Times:119:Times:We already acknowledged our debt to Anderson and Renault (2003), which led to a burgeoning literature
8:245:20570:19:18:72:538:635:119:Times:119:Times:linking the shape of the demand curve to producer surplus. Weyl and Fabinger (2013) (see also follow-on
8:246:20673:18:18:72:537:617:119:Times:119:Times:work by Fabinger and Weyl 2014) provide bounds on the surplus ratio for arbitrary demand and cost curves
8:247:20777:18:18:72:537:599:119:Times:119:Times:and oligopoly models; the bounds are tied to the elasticity of the marginal-producer-surplus function and
8:248:20882:18:19:72:537:581:119:Times:119:Times:oligopoly conduct parameters. Johnson and Myatt (2006) construct several orderings on demand curves
8:249:20981:19:18:72:537:562:119:Times:119:Times:including clockwise rotations. They provide a rich set of applications in which a firm’s strategy—e.g.,
8:250:21084:18:18:72:539:544:119:Times:119:Times:advertising or product design—is isomorphic to a choice of an ordered demand curve.3They show profit is
8:251:21187:18:19:71:536:526:119:Times:119:Times:typically quasiconvex in the demand ordering, rationalizing all-or-nothing strategy choices observed in the
8:252:21294:19:18:71:537:507:119:Times:119:Times:applications. Our decomposition formula provides a different way to order demand curves based on Zipf
8:253:21395:18:18:71:537:489:119:Times:119:Times:similarity and mean consumer values, which can be used to compare any two demands from a quite general
8:254:21497:18:19:71:538:471:119:Times:119:Times:class. Garber, Jones, and Romer (2006) relate deadweight loss to the shape of the demand curve as we do.
8:255:21601:19:18:71:537:452:119:Times:119:Times:The distortion in their pharmaceutical application arises comes from co-insurance: by defraying a fraction
8:256:21707:18:18:71:454:434:119:Times:119:Times:of the pharmaceutical price, co-insurance can induce overconsumption and excess entry.
8:257:21793:18:18:89:537:416:119:Times:119:Times:Our emphasis on incentives for market creation based on surplus appropriation and our bound on dead-
8:258:21893:18:19:71:536:398:119:Times:119:Times:weight loss from that source contribute to the broader literature on incentives for innovation from a general
8:259:22002:19:18:71:538:379:119:Times:119:Times:microeconomics perspective (see, e.g., Dosi 1988, Freeman 1994, Weyl and Tirole 2012) as well as to par-
8:260:22106:18:18:71:537:361:119:Times:119:Times:ticular R&D-intensive industries (see, e.g., Newell, Jaffee, and Stavins 1999; Acemoglu and Linn 2004;

8:265:22466:27:18:72:537:241:119:Times:119:Times:Consider a marketmfor a product. Demand is given byQ(p), a nonincreasing and left-continuous function
8:266:22567:18:19:71:539:223:119:Times:119:Times:of pricep.4LetP(q)=sup{p|Q(p)>q}be the inverse demand curve. Letp0=P(0)denote the choke price.
8:267:22661:19:18:71:539:204:119:Times:119:Times:It will be useful to distinguish between the choke pricep0associated with a particular demand curve and the
8:268:22768:18:17:71:539:186:119:Times:119:Times:maximum conceivable valuation for the product, denotedpmax≥p0. For example, suppose a disease causes
8:269:22868:17:14:84:536:169:49:Times:80:Times:3The idea that the firm will choose the most profitable shape for consumer demand has been applied to a diverse set of phenom-
8:270:22994:14:11:72:537:155:80:Times:80:Times:ena in industrial organization. For example, DeGraba (1995) explains buying frenzies as a response to supply limitations, inducing
8:271:23124:11:11:72:538:144:80:Times:80:Times:consumers to race to buy before acquiring more information about their true valuations. Biehl (2001) applies the idea to the sell
8:272:23253:11:8:72:149:133:80:Times:80:Times:versus lease decision.
8:273:23275:8:14:84:537:125:49:Times:80:Times:4Relaxing full continuity accommodates the case of discrete consumer types. Left-continuity amounts to assuming that con-
8:274:23396:14:11:72:536:111:80:Times:80:Times:sumers who are indifferent between purchasing and not choose to purchase the product. This assumption avoids an existence
8:275:23517:11:11:72:538:100:80:Times:80:Times:problem. If indifferent consumers choose not to purchase, the optimal monopoly price may fail to exist with discrete consumer
8:276:23642:11:11:72:537:89:80:Times:80:Times:types. In particular, if marginal consumers at a given price are of a discrete type, then any price in the open interval between the
8:277:23774:11:0:72:390:78:80:Times:80:Times:given price and the marginal consumers’ maximum willingness to pay is more profitable.

9:306:24108:18:19:72:537:462:119:Times:119:Times:would bepmax=1. On the other hand, in a market consisting of a country in which no consumer has greater
9:307:24211:19:18:71:539:443:119:Times:119:Times:than a 50% risk of contracting the disease, the choke price for a vaccine may be onlyp0=0.5. Assume
9:308:24310:18:18:72:537:425:119:Times:119:Times:p0>c, ensuring the market is non-trivial. The first panel of Figure 3 illustrates the inverse demand curve
9:309:24416:18:18:71:536:407:119:Times:119:Times:and some of the other notation introduced in this subsection (we will come back to the second panel in a
9:310:24520:18:18:71:130:389:119:Times:119:Times:later section).
9:311:24535:18:19:89:538:371:119:Times:119:Times:We will assume throughout most of the analysis thatpmax<∞. The importance of this assumption may
9:312:24631:19:18:71:537:352:119:Times:119:Times:not be fully apparent until Section 6.3, where we consider a demand curve arising from a Pareto distribution
9:313:24739:18:18:71:537:334:119:Times:119:Times:of consumer values, which does not have a finite maximum. The assumption can be justified in several
9:314:24839:18:19:71:536:316:119:Times:119:Times:ways. One is to realize that continuous distributions are just convenient approximations for values in a
9:315:24943:19:18:71:537:297:119:Times:119:Times:population of discrete consumers. There will be some highest valuer with some well-defined finite value for
9:316:25050:18:18:71:536:279:119:Times:119:Times:the discrete product. Another justification is that buyers with unbounded consumption values, well before
9:317:25155:18:19:71:536:261:119:Times:119:Times:paying an infinite amount to the monopolist, could save money by integrating backward into the production
9:318:25260:19:18:71:536:242:119:Times:119:Times:of the good themselves (Katz 1987). The option of backward integrating could then be related back to a
9:319:25362:18:18:71:120:224:119:Times:119:Times:finitepmax.
9:320:25373:18:19:89:538:206:119:Times:119:Times:The product is supplied by a monopolist. The firm decides whether or not to enter the market, reflected
9:321:25476:19:18:71:537:187:119:Times:119:Times:by the indicator functionE. Entry requires a fixed R&D expenditurek. Most of the analysis takes all
9:322:25575:18:18:71:537:169:119:Times:119:Times:ofkto be a social as well as a private cost, although we will briefly consider an extension in which part
9:323:25680:18:18:71:537:151:119:Times:119:Times:ofkis not a social cost—possibly a licensing fee, tax, or other transfer of surplus to another party, or an
9:324:25787:18:19:71:536:133:119:Times:119:Times:investment with some external social benefit. After entering, the monopolist produces at constant marginal

9:326:25984:17:14:84:537:97:49:Times:80:Times:5Harris and Raviv (1984) show that a linear price is the optimal mechanism for a monopolist who cannot engage in third-degree

10:340:27074:18:19:71:539:525:119:Times:119:Times:two deadweight-loss concepts. Harberger deadweight loss isHDWL(p)=TS∗∗−TS(p). This is the area of
10:341:27171:19:18:71:537:506:119:Times:119:Times:the Harberger triangle, reflecting just the distortion at the intensive margin of charging a supra-competitive
10:342:27281:18:18:71:537:488:119:Times:119:Times:pricep≥c, but taking the decision to develop the product as given. The equilibrium value of Harberger
10:343:27382:18:19:71:538:470:119:Times:119:Times:deadweight loss isHDWL∗=HDWL(p∗). Deadweight loss without without the “Harberger” modifier is a
10:344:27477:19:18:71:536:451:119:Times:119:Times:more comprehensive concept, capturing distortions at all margins, both the intensive margin (pricing) and
10:345:27582:18:18:71:539:433:119:Times:119:g_d0_f5:the extensive margin (entry). Denote the equilibrium value of this deadweight-loss concept byDWL∗=

10:348:27719:27:18:72:539:350:119:Times:119:Times:Much of the second half of the paper is devoted to characterizing when markets are lucrative for a mo-
10:349:27821:18:19:72:536:332:119:Times:119:Times:nopolist and when not. This section motivates that analysis, providing a series of theorems connecting the
10:350:27927:19:18:72:538:313:119:Times:119:Times:monopoly producer-surplus ratio,ρ∗=PS∗/TS∗∗, to potential deadweight loss, and in turn connecting po-
10:351:28028:18:18:71:536:295:119:Times:119:Times:tential deadweight loss to bounds on the gains and losses from policy interventions. Several theorems show
10:352:28134:18:19:71:536:277:119:Times:119:Times:that the monopoly bound is not special to that market structure but under some conditions serves as a bound
10:353:28241:19:31:71:210:258:119:Times:64:Times:for arbitrary oligopoly models.6

10:355:28306:23:18:72:538:204:119:Times:119:Times:Much of the paper is concerned with factors affecting a monopolist’s ability to extract surplus in a market.
10:356:28414:18:19:72:537:186:119:Times:119:Times:The results will have a number of useful positive implications, allowing one to predict which markets firms
10:357:28521:19:18:72:538:167:119:Times:119:Times:will enter and to predict the level of monopoly profits conditional on entry. The next theorem, a core result
10:358:28630:18:17:72:538:149:119:Times:119:Times:of the paper, implies that the results also have normative implications, which may be even more important.
10:359:28736:17:14:84:537:132:49:Times:80:Times:6To connect the results in this section to related results in our earlier paper, Kremer and Snyder (2015), Theorem 1 here is a
10:360:28862:14:11:72:538:118:80:Times:80:Times:generalization of Proposition 2 from our earlier paper, showing that the previous bound on potential deadweight loss in a pharma-
10:361:28991:11:11:72:537:107:80:Times:80:Times:ceutical market owing to the firm’s bias toward producing a drug rather than a vaccine applies to arbitrary product markets and does
10:362:29123:11:11:72:538:96:80:Times:80:Times:not require the firm to have two available products. Theorem 4 is likewise a generalization of our previous Proposition 13. The
10:363:29250:11:0:72:418:85:80:Times:80:Times:remaining results in this section (Theorems 2, 3, and 5) have no antecedent in our previous paper.

11:370:29447:34:18:72:538:602:119:Times:119:Times:Intuitively, the more surplus the monopolist can extract, the greater its R&D incentives, and the more likely
11:371:29556:18:19:72:537:584:119:Times:119:Times:that there is any supply on the market at all. Thus the ability of the monopolist to extract surplus, while not
11:372:29667:19:27:72:310:565:119:Times:119:Times:a social good in itself, limits potential deadweight loss.
11:373:29725:27:13:72:537:538:119:Times:119:Times:Theorem 1.In a monopoly market, the total surplus that cannot be extracted by the firm provides a tight
11:374:29828:13:25:72:284:525:119:Times:119:Times:upper bound on the level of deadweight loss, i.e.,

11:390:30412:13:14:71:539:349:119:Times:119:Times:enter either in equilibrium or the first best, implyingDWL∗=0. Deadweight loss at the extensive margin
11:391:30514:14:13:71:539:335:119:Times:119:Times:arises only forkin the moderate subinterval. The firm does not enter in equilibrium becausePS∗<kbut the
11:392:30617:13:14:71:539:322:119:Times:119:Times:first best involves entry becauseTS∗∗>k. In this case, all of first-best welfareW∗∗=TS∗∗−kis deadweight
11:393:30720:14:14:71:537:308:119:Times:119:Times:loss. Because welfare is decreasing ink, the supremum is achieved at the lower boundary of this subinterval,
11:394:30828:14:13:71:540:294:119:Times:119:Times:k=PS∗, where the firm is indifferent between entering and not in equilibrium. The supremum,TS∗∗−PS∗,
11:395:30928:13:14:71:540:281:119:Times:119:Times:over the moderate subinterval ofkexceeds that,TS∗∗−TS∗, over the low subinterval ofkbyCS∗≥0. This
11:396:31025:14:27:71:432:267:119:Times:119:Times:establishes equation (1). Dividing both sides of (1) byTS∗∗establishes (2).Q.E.D.
11:397:31106:27:18:89:538:240:119:Times:119:Times:Theorem 1 indicates that that the extensive margin can be a substantial source of deadweight loss. If
11:398:31207:18:19:71:536:222:119:Times:119:Times:the monopolist decides not to enter when it is socially efficient to do so, the consumer surplus that would
11:399:31314:19:18:71:537:203:119:Times:119:Times:have been generated,CS∗, is lost to society. The deadweight loss at the extensive margin can approach all of
11:400:31422:18:18:71:536:185:119:Times:119:Times:CS∗ifkis such that the monopolist is close to being indifferent between entering and not. The deadweight
11:401:31526:18:18:71:538:167:119:Times:119:Times:loss from the extensive margin adds to Harberger deadweightHDWL∗for a total potential loss (in levels) of
11:402:31631:18:19:71:363:149:119:Times:119:Times:HDWL∗+CS∗=HDWL∗+TS∗−PS∗=TS∗∗−PS∗, as stated in (1).
11:403:31682:19:18:89:539:130:119:Times:119:Times:The theorem could be generalized in a more general model of monopoly behavior. The model de-
11:404:31774:18:18:71:539:112:119:Times:119:Times:scribed in Section 2 assumes linear pricing, and the optimal linear pricep∗figured into the equilibrium
11:405:31877:18:19:71:538:94:119:Times:119:Times:producer surplusPS∗. More generally,PS∗could represent the producer surplus from optimally choosing
11:406:31976:19:0:71:537:75:119:Times:119:Times:more complicated pricing strategies, say involving second-degree price discrimination (i.e., nonlinear pric-
12:407:32085:0:18:72:538:708:119:Times:119:Times:ing, bundling) or third-degree price discrimination (i.e. pricing on observable consumer characteristics).
12:408:32191:18:18:72:323:690:119:Times:119:Times:The theorem would still hold interpretingPS∗in this way.
12:409:32247:18:18:89:537:672:119:Times:119:Times:The normative implications of the previously derived upper bounds on deadweight loss can be further
12:410:32346:18:19:71:538:654:119:Times:119:Times:developed. The next theorem linksDWL∗to bounds on social gains and losses from a variety of policies.
12:411:32447:19:25:71:525:635:119:Times:119:Times:This allows us to translate bounds onDWL∗directly into bounds on the welfare effects of these policies.
12:412:32550:25:13:71:536:610:119:Times:119:Times:Theorem 2.The social loss from banning price discrimination in a monopoly market is tightly bounded
12:413:32649:13:25:71:328:597:119:Times:119:Times:above by DWL∗, as is the social gain from subsidy policies.
12:414:32708:25:19:89:537:572:119:Times:119:Times:The proof is provided in Appendix A. Intuitively, the bound on the social loss from banning price
12:415:32805:19:18:71:539:553:119:Times:119:Times:discrimination is approached by takingkto be arbitrarily close to, but greater than,PS∗and assuming the
12:416:32908:18:18:71:537:535:119:Times:119:Times:firm can perfectly price discriminate in the absence of a ban. Then the monopolist chooses not to produce if
12:417:33016:18:18:71:539:517:119:Times:119:Times:price discrimination is banned, but could generate social welfareTS∗−kif allowed to discriminate. The loss
12:418:33122:18:19:71:539:499:119:Times:119:Times:in welfare equalsDWL∗=TS∗−PS∗in the limit ask↓PS∗. The bound on the social gain from a subsidy is
12:419:33219:19:18:71:539:480:119:Times:119:Times:approached similarly, again takingkto be arbitrarily close to, but greater than,PS∗. A small subsidy would
12:420:33325:18:18:71:536:462:119:Times:119:Times:shift the firm from not producing to producing, and a sufficiently large subsidy could induce first-best output
12:421:33436:18:19:71:537:444:119:Times:119:Times:and social welfareTS∗−k. Assuming the subsidy is funded by a non-distortionary tax, the social gain from
12:422:33540:19:18:71:357:425:119:Times:119:Times:the subsidy approachesDWL∗=TS∗−PS∗in the limit ask↓PS∗.
12:423:33595:18:18:89:539:407:119:Times:119:Times:Theorem 2 provides additional motivation for quantifyingρ∗, which will occupy much of the analysis
12:424:33693:18:18:71:538:389:119:Times:119:Times:in subsequent sections. We already saw from Theorem 1 that 1−ρ∗is a tight upper bound on relative
12:425:33790:18:19:71:538:371:119:Times:119:Times:deadweight loss. Putting the two theorems together, we see that 1−ρ∗also provides a tight upper bound
12:426:33891:19:18:71:537:352:119:Times:119:Times:(in relative terms) on the social loss from banning price discrimination and the social gain from subsidy
12:427:33996:18:31:71:108:334:119:Times:119:Times:policies.
12:428:34005:31:23:72:267:303:143:Times:143:Times:3.2. Private Versus Social Entry Costs
12:429:34043:23:18:72:537:280:119:Times:119:Times:The analysis so far has takenkto be a social cost, using up socially valuable resources, as would be the
12:430:34147:18:19:72:537:262:119:Times:119:Times:case in constructing labs and hiring scientists to invent a new product. In some cases, the monopolist’s entry
12:431:34257:19:18:72:538:243:119:Times:119:Times:expenditures include transfers to other parties (for example, bribes, licensing fees, corporate taxes, tariffs)
12:432:34368:18:18:72:538:225:119:Times:119:Times:or investments with some external social value (for example, mandated clinical trials that expand medical
12:433:34473:18:19:72:538:207:119:Times:119:Times:knowledge). To accommodate these cases, we extend the model to allow a fractionβofkto be a socially-
12:434:34573:19:18:72:537:188:119:Times:119:Times:neutral transfer from the monopolist. Thus, while the wholekis internalized by the monopolist as an entry
12:435:34678:18:18:72:537:170:119:Times:119:Times:cost, only the residual(1−β)kis a social cost. The following theorem, proved in Appendix A, generalizes
12:436:34781:18:25:72:391:152:119:Times:119:Times:the bound on relative deadweight loss from equation (2) in this extension.
12:437:34855:25:14:72:536:127:119:Times:119:Times:Theorem 3.Suppose that a fractionβ∈[0,1]of the monopoly’s entry cost k is a private cost to the monop-
12:438:34957:14:30:71:465:113:119:Times:119:Times:olist but not a social cost. Then a tight upper bound on relative deadweight loss is given by
12:439:35050:30:9:239:254:83:119:Times:119:Times:sup
12:440:35053:9:0:240:254:74:64:Times:64:Times:k≥0

13:446:35082:0:18:89:537:708:119:Times:119:Times:The theorem implies that imposing costs on the monopolist over and above the true social cost exacer-
13:447:35183:18:18:71:537:690:119:Times:119:Times:bates the potential for deadweight loss. In theβ=1 extreme in whichkis a pure transfer to other parties (or
13:448:35290:18:18:71:536:672:119:Times:119:Times:in any event involves no expenditure of real social resources), deadweight loss can dissipate all of first-best
13:449:35401:18:19:71:537:654:119:Times:119:Times:surplus. One way to view the relationship between Theorems 1 and 3 is to see the former as a bound on
13:450:35502:19:18:71:536:635:119:Times:119:Times:deadweight loss arising in a solely private market whereas the latter is a bound accounting for additional
13:451:35608:18:18:71:536:617:119:Times:119:Times:distortions due to government and other outside-party activities. The increase in potential deadweight loss
13:452:35715:18:18:71:537:599:119:Times:119:Times:from (2) to (3) provides a concrete measure of the potential social loss from corporate taxes, corruption in
13:453:35823:18:19:71:537:581:119:Times:119:Times:the form of bribe taking, and other externally imposed distortions. For the remainder of the paper, we will
13:454:35930:19:18:71:537:562:119:Times:119:Times:return to the model in which all ofkis a social cost, keeping in mind that this assumption leads (2) to be a
13:455:36038:18:32:71:284:544:119:Times:119:Times:conservative bound on potential deadweight loss.
13:456:36086:32:23:72:316:512:143:Times:143:Times:3.3. Bounds for General Models of Competition
13:457:36131:23:18:72:537:489:119:Times:119:Times:The analysis so far has assumed that the market is served by a monopolist. Although this is a fairly special
13:458:36239:18:18:72:538:471:119:Times:119:Times:market structure, the results are more general than they first appear, providing what is again a conservative
13:459:36348:18:18:72:536:453:119:Times:119:Times:bound on potential deadweight loss applicable to a broad range of other industrial structures. LettingCbe
13:460:36453:18:19:72:539:435:119:Times:119:Times:the model of competition under consideration—Bertrand, Cournot, perfect or imperfect cartel, etc.—with
13:461:36555:19:18:72:532:416:119:Times:119:Times:few restrictions onC, these models will be able to generate at least as much deadweight loss as monopoly.
13:462:36660:18:18:89:537:398:119:Times:119:Times:Formally, consider a model of competitionCinvolvingN∈Npotential entrants, whereNis the set of
13:463:36753:18:19:71:542:380:119:Times:119:Times:natural numbers. Leti=1,...,Nindex firms. At the start of the game, eachiobtain a drawki≥0ofthe
13:464:36848:19:18:71:536:361:119:Times:119:Times:fixed cost of developing the product. For simplicity, we will return to the assumption maintained prior to
13:465:36954:18:18:71:538:343:119:Times:119:Times:Theorem 3 thatkiis a social as well as a private cost. After observing the vector of draws, firms decide
13:466:37058:18:19:71:521:325:119:Times:119:Times:whether or not to enter by sinking the fixed cost. We will focus on pure strategies for the entry decision.

13:470:37261:18:33:71:447:288:119:Times:119:Times:for general forms of competition, we will put few constraints on this function. Assume

13:474:37363:33:18:71:537:222:119:Times:119:Times:meaning that a single entrant can achieve the monopoly outcome and thus earn the monopoly producer
13:475:37461:18:19:71:535:204:119:Times:119:Times:surplusPS∗. Among other things, this assumption rules out the possibility that potential entrants who do not
13:476:37569:19:18:71:536:185:119:Times:119:Times:materialize as actual entrants does not constrain the surplus a monopoly can earn, thus ruling out forms of
13:477:37676:18:33:71:437:167:119:Times:119:Times:contestability along the lines of Baumol, Panzar, and Willig (1982). Further, assume
13:478:37760:33:0:257:269:134:119:Times:119:Times:PS
13:479:37762:0:7:269:273:141:64:g_d0_f8:64:g_d0_f8:∗

13:483:37780:33:18:71:536:101:119:Times:119:Times:for all numbers of actual entrantsn≥1. This inequality captures the idea that competition destroys industry
13:484:37887:18:0:71:537:83:119:Times:119:Times:profits, so a monopoly generates weakly more producer surplus than any other market structure. Finally
14:485:37991:0:18:72:104:708:119:Times:119:Times:assume
14:486:37997:18:0:274:307:690:119:Times:119:Times:ki≤PS

14:490:38113:18:18:71:537:645:119:Times:119:Times:the entry decision: if it is violated for somei, that firm would have gained by staying out of the market. We
14:491:38222:18:26:71:193:627:119:Times:119:Times:have the following theorem.
14:492:38249:26:14:71:536:601:119:Times:119:Times:Theorem 4.Consider any model of competitionC satisfying conditions(4)–(6)and any number of potential

14:502:38578:14:26:71:176:510:119:Times:119:Times:surplus-extraction ratio.
14:503:38603:26:18:89:537:484:119:Times:119:Times:The proof is intuitive. WithNfirms, the entry costs may be sufficiently high for all but one firm that the
14:504:38709:18:18:71:535:466:119:Times:119:Times:only feasible outcome involves monopoly. Thus the monopoly distortion is always a possibility with any of
14:505:38814:18:18:71:537:448:119:Times:119:Times:the models under consideration. TheN−1 additional entrants and entry costs just add “degrees of freedom”
14:506:38918:18:19:71:431:430:119:Times:119:Times:that can create even greater distortions. A formal proof is provided in Appendix A.
14:507:39001:19:18:89:538:411:119:Times:119:Times:If one is willing to impose further assumptions regarding symmetry and free entry, much more precise
14:508:39101:18:18:71:537:393:119:Times:119:Times:bounds can be obtained. To this end, assume there are a potentially unlimited number of symmetric potential

14:522:40183:18:19:71:538:90:119:Times:119:Times:than (6). By omitting a lower bound onki, (6) allows for possible barriers to entry. The lower bound onkin

15:550:40982:18:19:71:535:456:119:Times:119:Times:inequality bounding relative deadweight loss in Theorem 4 with a tight bound. The tight bound is the
15:551:41082:19:18:71:536:437:119:Times:119:Times:lower of two values in (11) and (13), depending on the extensive margin at which deadweight loss is worse:
15:552:41188:18:18:71:538:419:119:Times:119:Times:insufficient or excess entry. If condition (12) holds for alln∈N, the supremum on relative deadweight loss
15:553:41294:18:18:71:536:401:119:Times:119:Times:is generated by insufficient entry, i.e., by a socially valuable product that ends up not being produced. In
15:554:41402:18:19:71:539:383:119:Times:119:Times:this case, the bound 1−ρ∗provided in Theorem 1 for the monopoly case carries over to the general model
15:555:41504:19:18:71:148:364:119:Times:119:Times:of competitionC.
15:556:41520:18:18:89:537:346:119:Times:119:Times:On the other hand, if condition (12) does not hold for somen∈N, the greatest source of deadweight
15:557:41617:18:19:71:536:328:119:Times:119:Times:loss moves from insufficient to excess entry. The proof shows the problem of excess entry is worst whenˆn

15:559:41827:18:18:71:539:291:119:Times:119:Times:by setting the fixed cost equal tok=PS∗(C,ˆn)−-for sufficiently small->0, generating equilibrium

15:562:42113:18:18:71:538:236:119:Times:119:Times:Deadweight loss is thusW∗∗−W∗=TS∗∗−CS∗(C,ˆn)−PS∗(C,ˆn)+(ˆn−1)-, which gives the bound in equation

15:564:42234:18:19:89:536:200:119:Times:119:Times:Whether or not condition (12) holds isa prioriambiguous. The right-hand side adds consumer and
15:565:42328:19:18:71:536:181:119:Times:119:Times:producer surplus, while the left-hand side involves just producer surplus. However, the producer surplus on
15:566:42435:18:18:71:536:163:119:Times:119:Times:the left-hand side is that for a monopoly, exceeding the producer surplus on the right-hand side earned by
15:567:42541:18:19:71:164:145:119:Times:119:Times:one ofˆncompetitors.
15:568:42561:19:18:89:537:126:119:Times:119:Times:Condition (12) holds in a wide range of familiar cases. SupposeCis given by Cournot competition
15:569:42656:18:18:71:538:108:119:Times:119:Times:among homogeneous firms facing linear inverse demandP=a−bQand constant marginal costc. One can
15:570:42750:18:19:71:538:90:119:Times:119:Times:showPS∗=(a−c)2/4,CS∗(C,n)=2PS∗n2/(n+1)2, andPS∗(C,n)=4PS∗/(n+1)2. Dividing through by
15:571:42835:19:0:71:538:71:119:Times:119:Times:PS∗, we see that condition (12) holds if and only ifn2−2n+3≥0, which is true for alln∈N. Hence, the
16:572:42936:0:18:72:538:708:119:Times:119:Times:bound in Theorem 1 for the monopoly case carries over to free entry in a symmetric Cournot model with
16:573:43037:18:18:72:175:690:119:Times:119:Times:linear demand and cost.
16:574:43060:18:18:89:538:672:119:Times:119:Times:The bound in Theorem 1 for the monopoly case also carries over to free entry in a symmetric Bertrand
16:575:43160:18:19:72:539:654:119:Times:119:Times:model with linear cost. Then,CS∗(C,n)+PS∗(C,n)=TS∗∗≥PS∗for alln>1 because Bertrand competition
16:576:43254:19:18:71:540:635:119:Times:119:Times:among multiple firms leads to marginal-cost pricing. Further,CS∗(C,1)+PS∗(C,1)≥PS(C,1)=PS∗. These
16:577:43351:18:18:71:284:617:119:Times:119:Times:facts together imply that (12) holds for alln∈N.

16:580:43605:19:18:71:539:562:119:Times:119:Times:of how many firms enter. ThenCS∗(C,n)=CS∗andPS∗(C,n)=PS∗/n. It follows that (12) holds for all
16:581:43699:18:18:71:540:544:119:Times:119:Times:n∈Nif and only if it holds in the limit asn↑∞, i.e.,PS∗≤limn∈N(CS∗+PS∗/n)=CS∗. We conclude that
16:582:43794:18:19:71:536:526:119:Times:119:Times:excess entry is the source of the most deadweight loss and equation (13) is the relevant bound in a cartel
16:583:43900:19:18:71:538:507:119:Times:119:Times:model ifPS∗>CS∗, i.e., if producer surplus exceeds consumer surplus when a monopoly serves the market.
16:584:44002:18:18:71:537:489:119:Times:119:Times:This will be the case, for example, in a market with linear demand and cost, since it can be shown using
16:585:44106:18:19:71:537:471:119:Times:119:Times:the formulas from a previous paragraph that producer surplus is twice consumer surplus in the monopoly
16:586:44208:19:18:71:537:452:119:Times:119:Times:equilibrium. That said, condition (12) can hold in the perfect-cartel case, in particular for any demand and

16:589:44400:27:18:71:536:369:119:Times:119:Times:The theorems presented in the previous section highlight the relevance of the monopoly surplus-extraction
16:590:44505:18:18:71:537:351:119:Times:119:Times:ratio,ρ∗, for the computation of bounds on relative deadweight loss and bounds on gains and losses from pol-
16:591:44613:18:19:71:537:333:119:Times:119:Times:icy interventions. The theorems were general, applying to different types of investment and to a broad range
16:592:44721:19:18:71:536:314:119:Times:119:Times:of market structures beyond monopoly including the familiar oligopoly models such as Cournot, Bertrand,
16:593:44824:18:18:71:539:296:119:Times:119:Times:and perfect cartels. These general results motivate the analysis of the determinants ofρ∗undertaken in this
16:594:44931:18:19:71:536:278:119:Times:119:Times:section. The analysis is broken into three subsections. The first subsection presents a rescaling that places
16:595:45040:19:18:71:537:259:119:Times:119:Times:demands for diverse products on the same footing. The second introduces the STRZ demand curve. The
16:596:45138:18:18:71:537:241:119:Times:119:Times:third presents a formula for decomposing equilibrium changes into changes in how much the demand curve
16:597:45240:18:15:71:253:223:119:Times:64:Times:resembles a STRZ one and other factors.7
16:598:45280:15:14:84:537:208:49:Times:80:Times:7We can connect the results in each subsection of Section 4 to related results in our earlier paper, Kremer and Snyder (2015).
16:599:45406:14:11:72:536:194:80:Times:80:Times:In Section 4.1, the demand rescaling is new. Our previous paper worked with a vaccine that was costless to produce and that was
16:600:45533:11:11:72:536:183:80:Times:80:Times:sold to a unit mass of consumers who differed only in disease risk, so no rescaling was needed. The lemmas below, though related
16:601:45661:11:11:72:537:172:80:Times:80:Times:to the same-numbered lemmas in the previous paper, are more general and thus require new proofs. Proposition 1 is identical to
16:602:45787:11:11:72:537:161:80:Times:80:Times:Proposition 3 of Kremer and Snyder (2015). In Section 4.2, the STRZ demand was derived in our previous paper. We provide a
16:603:45909:11:11:72:538:150:80:Times:80:Times:more elegant and rigorous proof that it is the producer-surplus minimizer in its class here. The analytical expression for the producer
16:604:46044:11:11:72:537:139:80:Times:80:Times:surplus from the STRZ demand in Proposition 3 is new. In Section 4.3, our previous paper proposed the index of Zipf similarityZ,
16:605:46172:11:0:71:389:128:80:Times:80:Times:but the decomposition of a market change in terms ofZin equations (26) and 27 are new.

17:648:48402:29:18:89:538:175:119:Times:119:Times:By definition,μis the mean of rescaled consumer values. The first equality in Lemma 1 provides an
17:649:48499:18:16:71:538:157:119:Times:119:Times:equivalent interpretation ofμas the area under the rescaled demand curve,Φ. The second equality in
17:650:48597:16:14:84:538:141:49:Times:80:Times:8Our rescaling is similar to the stretch parameterization used in Weyl and Tirole’s (2012) study of optimal rewards for innovation.
17:651:48728:14:11:72:538:127:80:Times:80:Times:In both, the horizontal axis is rescaled/stretched so that the first-best quantity is 1. We rescale the vertical axis so the maximum
17:652:48860:11:8:72:324:116:80:Times:80:Times:conceivable value is 1 whereas they scale it so the monopoly price is 1.
17:653:48932:8:15:84:539:108:49:Times:80:Times:9The only formal difference would be thatp0rather thanpmaxwould appear in the the rescaling formula in equation (14).
17:654:49049:15:10:72:538:93:80:Times:80:Times:Conceptually, any result comparing a given demand curve with interceptp0to other demand curves would be conditional on the
17:655:49171:10:12:72:539:83:80:Times:80:Times:others not having an intercept greater thanp0. The virtue of rescaling by the maximum conceivable valuepmaxwhen this is finite
17:656:49297:12:0:72:504:71:80:Times:80:Times:is that no demand curve can have a higher intercept and thus no additional constraint about intercepts need be considered.
18:657:49421:0:18:72:537:708:119:Times:119:Times:Lemma 1 provides yet another equivalent interpretation ofμin terms of the original (unscaled) consumer
18:658:49523:18:18:72:537:690:119:Times:119:Times:values and demand curve. According to this interpretation,μis the mean surplus in the first best per unit of
18:659:49631:18:18:72:540:672:119:Times:119:Times:output,TS∗∗/q∗∗, as a proportion of the maximum conceivable surplus,pmax−c. Borrowing from engineer-
18:660:49731:18:19:71:360:654:119:Times:119:Times:ing terminology, this can be called themean-to-peak surplus ratio.
18:661:49797:19:18:89:539:635:119:Times:119:Times:The next lemma provides a simple formula forρ∗that can be read off a graph, as illustrated in the

18:664:50096:18:19:71:538:581:119:Times:119:Times:region. Lemma 1 showed thatμequals the whole area underΦ. The next lemma, proved in Appendix A,
18:665:50191:19:18:71:539:562:119:Times:119:Times:states thatρ∗=REC∗/μ, implying thatρ∗is the ratio of the area of the shaded rectangle to the area under

18:670:50521:18:19:71:538:458:119:Times:119:Times:leading to high or low values ofρ∗. The next proposition covers one extreme: a necessary and sufficient
18:671:50624:19:18:71:537:439:119:Times:119:Times:condition forρ∗=1 is that positive values ofXare homogeneous. The proposition, restated here for
18:672:50720:18:18:71:537:421:119:Times:119:Times:reference, is identical (except for some minor notational differences) to Proposition 3 of Kremer and Snyder
18:673:50828:18:28:71:217:403:119:Times:119:Times:(2015); see that paper for a proof.
18:674:50863:28:13:71:540:375:119:Times:119:Times:Proposition 1.ρ∗=1in a market if and only if there exists some x	∈(0,1]such thatPr(X=x	)=1.
18:675:50954:13:27:71:154:362:119:Times:119:Times:Otherwise,ρ∗<1.
18:676:50969:27:19:89:537:335:119:Times:119:Times:An implication of Proposition 1 is that, starting from a homogeneousX, introducing variance causes
18:677:51067:19:18:71:538:316:119:g_d0_f7:119:Times:ρ∗to fall from 1 to some lower value. This leads one to hope thatρ∗is monotonically decreasing in the
18:678:51168:18:18:71:539:298:119:Times:119:Times:variance ofX, allowing variance to be used as a sufficient statistic forρ∗. As Proposition 4 of Kremer and
18:679:51274:18:19:71:539:280:119:Times:119:Times:Snyder (2015) shows, this is not the case: not only is variance not a sufficient statistic forρ∗but neither
18:680:51381:19:18:71:539:261:119:Times:119:Times:is skewness, kurtosis, or any other higher moment of the distribution ofX.10The next section provides a
18:681:51484:18:18:71:537:243:119:Times:119:Times:sufficient statistic based not on moments but on the the resemblance of the distribution ofXto the worst-
18:682:51589:18:18:71:537:225:119:Times:119:Times:case distribution, which has the lowest possibleρ∗foragivenμ. As indicated in the introduction, this is the

19:703:52411:15:18:89:537:598:119:Times:119:Times:We will not repeat the derivation here, but instead provide intuition with the help of Figure 2 from the
19:704:52515:18:18:71:536:580:119:Times:119:Times:introduction. Begin by considering the grey demand curve, which happens to be linear but, because it has
19:705:52619:18:18:71:538:562:119:Times:119:Times:unit intercepts, can represent any rescaled demand curveΦ(x). The shaded rectangle (which happens to
19:706:52719:18:19:71:537:544:119:Times:119:Times:be a square) is the largest rectangle that can be inscribed under it. Now consider transforming the grey
19:707:52823:19:18:71:537:525:119:Times:119:Times:demand curve by moving some mass away from the corner of the shaded square to other parts of the curve,
19:708:52926:18:18:71:537:507:119:Times:119:Times:maintaining the same area under the whole curve—thus maintainingμ. This transformation will reduce
19:709:53024:18:19:71:540:489:119:Times:119:Times:REC∗and, becauseμis constant, reduceρ∗, which equalsρ∗=REC∗/μby Lemma 2. The process can
19:710:53112:19:18:71:538:470:119:Times:119:Times:be repeated, at each step moving mass away from the corner of the largest rectangle inscribed under the
19:711:53215:18:18:71:539:452:119:Times:119:Times:transformed curve elsewhere, again reducingREC∗and thusρ∗. The limit of this process is the demand
19:712:53313:18:19:71:537:434:119:Times:119:Times:curve drawn in black in the figure: no further transformations are possible because inscribed rectangles have
19:713:53422:19:18:71:539:415:119:Times:119:Times:the same area. For allx≥A(μ),xΦ(x,μ)=A(μ), a constant independent ofx, verifying that the demand
19:714:53518:18:27:72:511:397:119:Times:119:Times:curve in equation (16) has the equal-area property and is thus the unique producer-surplus minimizer.

19:716:53716:14:13:71:536:356:119:Times:119:Times:the implicit solution to(17). This is the unique (almost everywhere) minimizer of producer surplus among
19:717:53820:13:27:71:443:343:119:Times:119:Times:the set of rescaled demand curves having a mean rescaled value of at leastμ∈(0,1).
19:718:53902:27:19:71:537:316:119:Times:119:Times:Proposition 2 is a restatement of Proposition 5 from Kremer and Snyder (2015) for general products beyond
19:719:54007:19:18:71:517:297:119:Times:119:Times:vaccines. We were able to derive a more rigorous and elegant proof, which we provide in Appendix A.
19:720:54106:18:18:89:538:279:119:Times:119:Times:Kremer and Snyder (2015) callΦ(x,μ)the symmetrically truncated Zipf (STRZ) demand. The origin of
19:721:54202:18:19:71:537:261:119:Times:119:Times:the “Zipf” part of the name can be better understood by interpreting the demand curve as a complementary
19:722:54306:19:18:71:537:242:119:Times:119:Times:cdf over consumer values. The function in equation (16) has a power-law form with power-law exponent
19:723:54406:18:18:71:536:224:119:Times:119:g_d0_f5:equal to 1 (see Gabaix 2009), thus satisfying the definition of Zipf’s law. Students will recognizeΦ(x,μ)
19:724:54511:18:19:71:537:206:119:Times:119:Times:as a globally unit-elastic demand curve—as expected from the property that where demand is unit elastic,
19:725:54615:19:18:71:536:187:119:Times:119:Times:revenue is unchanging in price. It is a special form, though, with truncated endpoints making it symmetric.
19:726:54722:18:18:71:538:169:119:Times:119:Times:Figure 5 shows how the shape ofΦ(x,μ)varies withμ. The black curve is the same STRZ demand curve
19:727:54818:18:18:72:539:151:119:Times:119:Times:from Figure 2, having a mean value ofμ=0.5. The grey curve, which has a lower mean ofμ=0.25, hugs

21:765:56928:18:18:72:538:617:119:Times:119:Times:rectangles inscribed under the associated STRZ demands cover a smaller proportion of area the lower isμ.
21:766:57032:18:18:72:536:599:119:Times:119:Times:In the limit, as the proposition states,ρ(μ)approaches 0 asμapproaches 0. This limiting result has a crucial
21:767:57140:18:19:71:536:581:119:Times:119:Times:implication for our analysis that deserves highlighting. The result implies that cases can be constructed in
21:768:57248:19:18:71:538:562:119:Times:119:Times:whichρ∗is arbitrarily close to 0. But this means, by Theorem 1, that cases can be constructed such that
21:769:57351:18:32:71:243:544:119:Times:119:Times:deadweight loss is arbitrarily close to 1.

21:771:57411:23:18:72:538:489:119:Times:119:Times:Kremer and Snyder (2015) define the Zipf-similarity,Z, of demand in a given market by the ratio of unex-
21:772:57515:18:33:72:450:471:119:Times:119:Times:tracted surplus in that market relative to that in the worst (STRZ) case with the sameμ:

21:777:57620:36:18:72:538:402:119:Times:119:Times:The fact thatρ(μ)≤ρ∗≤1 ensuresZ∈[0,1], withZ=0 for homogeneous consumers andZ=1 for a
21:778:57705:18:18:71:193:384:119:Times:119:Times:market with STRZ demand.
21:779:57729:18:19:89:537:366:119:Times:119:Times:With this definition ofZ, a simple rearrangement allows potential deadweight loss to be expressed as the
21:780:57833:19:18:71:170:347:119:Times:119:Times:product of two factors:
21:781:57856:18:27:261:539:329:119:Times:119:Times:1−ρ∗=Z[1−ρ(μ)].(22)
21:782:57875:27:18:72:536:302:119:Times:119:Times:In words, potential deadweight loss is the product of the Zipf-similarity of demand and 1−ρ(μ), which
21:783:57976:18:19:71:538:284:119:Times:119:Times:can be interpreted as the difficulty in capturing surplus from a STRZ demand curve. Since 1−ρ(μ)is a
21:784:58076:19:18:71:539:265:119:Times:119:Times:monotonic function of the parameterμ, we see that potential deadweight loss 1−ρ∗is completely determined
21:785:58180:18:18:71:342:247:119:Times:119:Times:by two variables,Zandμand moreover is monotonic in them.
21:786:58236:18:18:89:538:229:119:Times:119:Times:According to Gabaix’s (2009) survey, power laws—Zipf distributions in particular—characterize the
21:787:58333:18:19:71:537:211:119:Times:119:Times:distribution of many natural and social phenomena, including earthquakes and word frequency, but also
21:788:58434:19:18:71:536:192:119:Times:119:Times:including economic phenomena that may translate into distributions of values for products. For example,
21:789:58537:18:18:71:538:174:119:Times:119:Times:the upper tail of city size, firm size, income, wealth, CEO compensation, stock price changes and volatility,
21:790:58646:18:19:71:536:156:119:Times:119:Times:and various international-trade indexes are Zipfian. Equation (22) implies that R&D incentives will be quite
21:791:58754:19:18:71:537:137:119:Times:119:Times:low in markets in which demand is proportional to these variables. For example, the demand for lifesaving
21:792:58859:18:18:71:537:119:119:Times:119:Times:pharmaceuticals may be proportional to income or wealth; the demand for software used by enterprises or
21:793:58962:18:18:71:536:101:119:Times:119:Times:municipal governments might be proportional to firm or city size. As highlighted by our careful treatment
21:794:59067:18:0:71:536:83:119:Times:119:Times:of demand rescaling, the relevant distribution to analyze for the Zipf shape is not the raw distribution of
22:795:59176:0:18:72:537:708:119:Times:119:Times:consumer values but net values above marginal production cost (normalizing values by the peak value and
22:796:59279:18:18:72:537:690:119:Times:119:Times:quantity by first-best quantity to ensure the resulting demand has unit intercepts). The focus on net values
22:797:59387:18:18:72:537:672:119:Times:119:Times:means that markets in which only the upper tail is Zipfian may nonetheless generate highly Zipf-similar
22:798:59490:18:19:72:537:654:119:Times:119:Times:distributions of net values, since consumers in the lower tail of gross values may not have positive net
22:799:59594:19:18:72:537:635:119:Times:119:Times:values and may thus not be part of the relevant distribution. The case of goods produced at little or no
22:800:59698:18:18:72:538:617:119:Times:119:Times:marginal cost—software, digital media, certain small-molecule drugs—is straightforward because net and
22:801:59800:18:18:72:262:599:119:Times:119:Times:gross consumer values are similar for them.
22:802:59843:18:19:89:537:581:119:Times:119:Times:Equation (22) provides a starting point toward a useful decomposition of comparative-statics changes.

22:831:60728:19:18:89:538:261:119:Times:119:Times:Perhaps more useful is to express the decomposition in percentages (i.e., as a percent of the total change)

23:856:61479:18:19:72:540:409:119:Times:64:Times:overall deadweight lossDWL. Zipf-similarityalso has implications for Harberger deadweight lossHDWL∗.12
23:857:61581:19:18:72:539:390:119:Times:64:g_d0_f8:A monopolist in a market with rescaled demandΦis indifferent over a wide range of prices. ThusHDWL∗
23:858:61680:18:18:72:538:372:119:Times:119:Times:is indeterminate, depending on which equilibrium price the monopolist selects. For example, in Figure 6,
23:859:61784:18:19:72:537:354:119:Times:119:Times:the monopolist is indifferent between selling to all consumers with positive net values (earning producer
23:860:61889:19:18:72:536:335:119:Times:119:Times:surplus proportional to the area ofCplusD) or just to the mass of the highest-value consumers (earning
23:861:61991:18:18:72:537:317:119:Times:119:Times:producer surplus proportional to the area ofAplusC). In the first, there is no Harberger deadweight loss;
23:862:62096:18:18:71:536:299:119:Times:119:Times:in the second, Harberger deadweight loss is proportional to the areas of regionsBplusD. This turns out to
23:863:62201:18:19:71:537:281:119:Times:119:Times:be the greatest Harberger deadweight loss possible for any market with mean rescaled valueμ. We have the
23:864:62305:19:27:71:269:262:119:Times:119:Times:following proposition, proved in Appendix A.
23:865:62349:27:14:71:537:235:119:Times:119:Times:Proposition 4.Consider a market with rescaled demandΦ(x,μ). There exists an equilibrium in this market
23:866:62451:14:13:71:538:221:119:Times:119:Times:in which relative Harberger deadweight loss HDWL∗/TS∗∗equals1−ρ(μ), which is strictly greater than in
23:867:62552:13:14:72:537:208:119:Times:119:Times:any other market with a rescaled demand that is not almost everywhere identical but with the same mean
23:868:62654:14:27:72:146:194:119:Times:119:Times:rescaled valueμ.
23:869:62670:27:18:89:538:167:119:Times:119:Times:LetHDWL∗denote the worst-case Harberger deadweight loss associated with the STRZ demand curve
23:870:62763:18:18:71:537:149:119:g_d0_f5:119:Times:Φ. WhileHDWL∗is only realized in one among a continuum of equilibria, a unique equilibrium with
23:871:62858:18:19:71:539:131:119:Times:119:Times:Hargerger deadweight loss arbitrarily close toHDWL∗can be generated by perturbing demand by adding
23:872:62956:19:18:71:536:112:119:Times:119:Times:tiny mass to the highest support point ofΦ. Combining Proposition 4 with the result from Section 4.2 that
23:873:63061:18:19:71:537:94:119:Times:119:Times:limμ↓0ρ(μ)=0 implies that Hargerger deadweight loss can come close to fully dissipating total surplus in
23:874:63165:19:0:80:442:75:49:Times:80:Times:12Our previous related paper, Kremer and Snyder (2015), did not analyze Harberger deadweight loss.
24:875:63265:0:18:72:362:708:119:Times:119:Times:a market with a Zipf-similar demand and low mean rescaled value.
24:876:63329:18:18:89:537:690:119:Times:119:Times:The next proposition, proved in Appendix A, turns from conditions under which Harberger deadweight
24:877:63427:18:27:72:264:672:119:Times:119:Times:loss is large to those under which it is small.
24:878:63474:27:13:72:539:645:119:Times:119:Times:Proposition 5.In a given market, HDWL∗/TS∗∗is bounded above by Z[1−ρ(μ)]. Harberger deadweight
24:879:63568:13:27:72:303:632:119:Times:119:Times:loss is vanishingly small in the limit as Z↓0orμ↑1.
24:880:63619:27:18:72:536:605:119:Times:119:Times:The limiting results are intuitive: in both limitsZ↓0 andμ↑1, the population of consumers with positive
24:881:63722:18:19:72:447:587:119:Times:119:Times:demand becomes perfectly homogeneous, causing the Harberger triangle to disappear.
24:882:63804:19:18:89:537:568:119:Times:119:Times:We mentioned that adding a tiny mass to the highest support point ofΦcan generate a unique equilibrium
24:883:63906:18:18:71:536:550:119:Times:119:Times:with close to the maximum possible Harberger deadweight loss. Conversely, adding tiny mass to the lowest
24:884:64010:18:19:71:536:532:119:Times:119:Times:support point ofΦwould generate a unique equilibrium in which Harberger deadweight loss is eliminated.
24:885:64112:19:18:72:538:513:119:Times:119:Times:Thus welfare in a market with Zipf-similar demand is chaotic. This leaves a powerful role for policy in such
24:886:64220:18:18:72:537:495:119:Times:119:Times:a market. Price ceilings or mandatory licensing could swing the equilibrium to the one without Harberger
24:887:64324:18:19:72:537:477:119:Times:119:Times:deadweight loss while generating negligible reductions in dynamic R&D incentives. This can be seen in
24:888:64425:19:18:72:537:458:119:Times:119:Times:Figure 6, where the imposition of such policies could ensure that the equilibrium in which all consumers
24:889:64529:18:18:72:537:440:119:Times:119:Times:with positive values purchase while keeping producer surplus arbitrarily close to proportional to the original
24:890:64639:18:18:72:537:422:119:Times:119:Times:areas ofCplusD. A tiny subsidy would likewise eliminate Harberger deadweight loss at negligible fiscal
24:891:64741:18:19:72:92:404:119:Times:119:Times:cost.
24:892:64746:19:18:89:537:385:119:Times:119:Times:The results in this section, though derived for the monopoly market structure, have implications for
24:893:64846:18:18:72:538:367:119:Times:119:Times:more general market structures. Price under monopoly is typically higher than under more competitive
24:894:64946:18:19:72:537:349:119:Times:119:Times:market structures. Thus Harberger deadweight loss is also typically higher under monopoly than under
24:895:65046:19:18:72:538:330:119:Times:119:Times:other market structures, implying that the upper bound on Harberger deadweight loss from a monopoly
24:896:65145:18:18:72:537:312:119:Times:119:Times:will also bound Harberger deadweight loss from other market structures. This is the logic of the following
24:897:65251:18:27:72:266:294:119:Times:119:Times:proposition, proved formally in Appendix A.
24:898:65294:27:14:72:536:267:119:Times:119:Times:Proposition 6.Consider any model of competitionC among n homogeneous firms having a symmetric equi-
24:899:65393:14:13:72:537:253:119:Times:119:Times:librium resulting in market price x∗(C,n). Assuming this price is weakly lower than under monopoly, i.e.,
24:900:65498:13:14:71:540:240:119:Times:119:Times:x∗(C,n)≤x∗, then relative Harberger deadweight loss from this model of competition, HDWL∗(C,n)/TS∗∗,
24:901:65598:14:26:71:214:226:119:Times:119:Times:is bounded above by Z[1−ρ(μ)].
24:902:65628:26:19:89:538:200:119:Times:119:Times:Tighter bounds can be obtained in specific competition models. Consider, for example, a Cournot model.
24:903:65730:19:18:72:538:181:119:Times:119:Times:To construct the demand curve maximizing relative Harberger deadweight loss under this model, we can use
24:904:65834:18:18:72:538:163:119:Times:119:Times:the same approach as we did with a monopoly, ensuring firms only serve the highest-demand consumers,
24:905:65934:18:19:72:537:145:119:Times:119:Times:leaving all the rest of the consumers to constitute the deadweight loss triangle. For this outcome to be an
24:906:66041:19:18:72:539:126:119:Times:119:Times:equilibrium, each firm must weakly prefer the revenue obtained from serving a 1/nshare of highest-demand
24:907:66145:18:18:72:537:108:119:Times:119:Times:consumers to any higher output. The worst case is generated by distributing the given massμunder the
24:908:66245:18:19:72:538:90:119:Times:119:Times:demand curve such that each firm is indifferent among all these quantities. Appendix B works out the precise
24:909:66353:19:0:72:538:71:119:Times:119:Times:formula for the resulting worst-case demand curve, denotedΦ(x,μ,n). The appendix provides a figure
25:910:66453:0:18:72:538:708:119:Times:119:Times:graphing several examples ofΦ(x,μ,n), showing that they are roughly a clockwise rotation of the STRZ
25:911:66553:18:18:72:537:690:119:Times:119:Times:demand through a point, with a larger rotation the higher isn. Since the equilibrium price extracts all the
25:912:66660:18:18:72:538:672:119:Times:119:Times:consumer surplus of the subset of consumers served in this Cournot construction, the Harberger-deadweight-
25:913:66766:18:19:72:539:654:119:Times:119:Times:loss ratio isHDWL∗/TS∗∗=1−ρ(μ,n), whereρ(μ,n)is the ratio of thesenfirms’ worst-case producer
25:914:66859:19:18:72:538:635:119:Times:119:Times:surpluses to first-best surplus. For reference, the appendix provides a table ofρ(μ,n)for different values of
25:915:66968:18:18:71:539:617:119:g_d0_f7:119:Times:μandn. For example, fixingμ=0.2, one can read from the table thatρ(0.2,1)=0.25,ρ(0.2,4)=0.53,
25:916:67061:18:18:72:537:599:119:Times:119:Times:andρ(0.2,16)=0.78, implying an upper bound on Harberger deadweight loss of 1−ρ(0.2,1)=0.75 for
25:917:67155:18:19:72:537:581:119:Times:119:Times:the monopoly case (n=1), 1−ρ(0.2,4)=0.47 forn=4 Cournot firms, and 1−ρ(0.2,16)=0.22 for
25:918:67242:19:18:72:537:562:119:Times:119:Times:n=16 Cournot firms. Evidently, with as many asn=16 Cournot competitors, the potential for Harberger
25:919:67341:18:39:72:315:544:119:Times:119:Times:deadweight loss, even in the worst case, is quite limited.
25:920:67399:39:26:72:221:505:206:Times:206:Times:6. Specific Distributions
25:921:67424:26:18:72:537:479:119:Times:119:Times:The analysis so far has provided general results for unrestricted distributions of consumer valuesX. This
25:922:67529:18:19:72:537:461:119:Times:119:Times:subsection derives additional results in specific cases in which more structure can be put on demand. We first
25:923:67639:19:18:72:539:442:119:Times:119:Times:consider discrete distributions of consumer values, boundingρ∗as a function of the number of consumer
25:924:67740:18:18:71:535:424:119:Times:119:Times:types. Then we move to continuous distributions, first beta distributions, then general distributions having
25:925:67848:18:18:71:535:406:119:Times:119:Times:global curvature properties. The last subsection builds on the simple insight that the monopolist can earn
25:926:67954:18:19:71:537:388:119:Times:119:Times:at least as much as by pricing so that the median consumer is marginal. This allows us to derive a quite
25:927:68058:19:18:71:538:369:119:Times:119:Times:general lower bound onρ∗as a function of the ratio of the median to the mean ofX. This simple insight
25:928:68159:18:18:71:536:351:119:Times:119:Times:has powerful consequences, allowing us to leverage a rich set of results from the statistics literature on the
25:929:68269:18:32:71:471:333:119:Times:64:Times:“mean-median-mode inequality” to provide alternative bounds onρ∗in a variety of cases.13
25:930:68357:32:23:72:207:301:143:Times:143:Times:6.1. Discrete Distributions
25:931:68384:23:27:72:403:278:119:Times:119:Times:The following proposition provides a lower bound onρ∗whenXis discrete.
25:932:68454:27:14:71:537:251:119:Times:119:Times:Proposition 7.Consider the set of markets in which the distribution of consumer values X has T discrete
25:933:68557:14:27:71:271:237:119:Times:119:Times:types. Then1/T is a tight lower bound onρ∗.
25:934:68600:27:18:89:538:210:119:Times:119:Times:The proof is similar to that of a related result (Proposition 8) in Kremer and Snyder (2015); the reader
25:935:68704:18:19:71:536:192:119:Times:119:Times:is referred there for a proof. Here we will provide intuition for the proposition, illustrated by Figure 7 in an
25:936:68816:19:18:71:538:173:119:Times:119:Times:example withT=3 discrete types. LetA−Frepresent the areas of the indicated rectangles. By construction,
25:937:68919:18:18:71:537:155:119:Times:119:Times:the rescaled demand curve is a discrete analogue to the symmetrically truncated Zipf distribution, with equal
25:938:69028:18:17:71:538:137:119:Times:119:Times:producer surplus whichever of the three types the firm targets as the marginal consumer:A+B+Cfrom
25:939:69125:17:14:80:538:120:49:Times:80:Times:13To connect the results in this section to our earlier paper, the results for discrete distributions appears as Proposition 8 in
25:940:69254:14:11:72:538:106:80:Times:80:Times:Kremer and Snyder (2015), restated here for reference. Proposition 13 generalizes the results for concavity in Proposition 9 and
25:941:69382:11:11:72:537:95:80:Times:80:Times:log-concavity in Proposition 10 toc-concavity. The rest of the results—for beta, Pareto, and the mean-median-mode inequality—are
25:942:69510:11:0:72:107:84:80:Times:80:Times:new here.

26:962:69737:28:18:71:537:383:119:Times:119:Times:We see thatρ∗exceeds 1/3 in proportion to the overlap among the inscribed rectangles captured by the
26:963:69837:18:18:71:538:365:119:Times:119:Times:B+2C+Eterm. In the limit asμapproaches 0, the demand curve increasingly hugs the axes, and the area
26:964:69936:18:32:71:308:347:119:Times:119:Times:of these overlapping rectangles becomes second order.
26:965:69989:32:23:72:184:315:143:Times:143:Times:6.2. Beta Distribution
26:966:70011:23:18:72:537:292:119:Times:119:Times:The next special case moves from discrete to continuous distributions. We consider the beta distribution, a
26:967:70118:18:18:72:536:274:119:Times:119:Times:useful one in our context because it has the[0,1]domain suitable for rescaled consumer values but with just
26:968:70225:18:35:71:424:256:119:Times:119:Times:two parameters can fit many distribution shapes fairly closely. The beta density is
26:969:70308:35:0:240:290:221:119:Times:119:g_d0_f5:f(x,a,b)=
26:970:70317:0:8:301:359:228:119:Times:64:Times:xa−1(1−x)b−1

26:974:70351:30:18:89:537:185:119:Times:119:Times:It turns out that considerable insight can be obtained in our setting by re-parameterizing the beta in terms

27:1036:71808:18:19:71:539:203:119:Times:119:Times:standard quasi-Newton methods and dividing byμto obtainρ∗. The first panel shows the range of parame-

27:1038:72017:18:18:71:537:166:119:Times:119:Times:For eachμ,ρ∗approaches 1 asσ2approaches 0; intuitively, the firm can extract all surplus by pricing just
27:1039:72121:18:19:71:539:148:119:Times:119:Times:below the mode as the mass of values piles up at the mode. Asσ2increases holdingμconstant,ρ∗falls in
27:1040:72221:19:18:71:537:129:119:Times:119:Times:the unimodal case. The second panel shows values of the parameters for which the beta is non-unimodal.
27:1041:72323:18:18:71:539:111:119:Times:119:Times:Here,ρ∗is non-monotonic, increasing for sufficiently highσ2. What is happening for these high values of
27:1042:72426:18:19:71:537:93:119:g_d0_f7:119:Times:σ2is that the density asymptotes to infinity atx=1, leading the firm to be able to extract nearly all surplus
27:1043:72535:19:0:71:173:74:119:Times:119:Times:by settingx∗close to 1.

28:1046:72758:18:18:71:537:672:119:Times:119:Times:pattern holds for allμwe have tried over a fine grid, leading us to conjecture that it is generally true for a
28:1047:72868:18:19:71:538:654:119:Times:119:Times:unimodal beta thatρ∗is strictly decreasing inσ2holdingμ, although we have not been able to prove this

28:1049:72976:31:23:72:195:604:143:Times:143:Times:6.3. Pareto Distribution
28:1050:73000:23:18:72:537:581:119:Times:119:Times:We next consider the Pareto distribution, a useful special case because, besides being widely used in eco-
28:1051:73106:18:19:72:537:563:119:Times:119:Times:nomics, it is a generalization of the Zipf distribution featured in our analysis. We will use this special case
28:1052:73217:19:18:72:531:544:119:Times:119:Times:to better understand the role played by the maintained assumption of an upper bound on consumer values.
28:1053:73320:18:18:89:537:526:119:Times:119:g_d0_f6:According to the textbook definition, a Pareto random variable has distribution functionF(x)=1−
28:1054:73415:18:19:72:538:508:119:g_d0_f5:119:Times:(x0/x)αon support[x0,∞), wherex0,α >0. With no upper bound on the support, the textbook Pareto does
28:1055:73514:19:18:71:539:489:119:Times:119:Times:not fit our model, which posited a maximum conceivable consumer value,pmax. We relax that feature of the
28:1056:73618:18:18:71:290:471:119:Times:119:Times:model and proceed with the analysis of the Pareto.
28:1057:73668:18:18:89:536:453:119:Times:119:Times:Suppose a monopolist with costless production sells to a continuum of consumers whose unit demands
28:1058:73766:18:19:71:540:435:119:Times:119:Times:for the good follow the textbook Pareto distribution. Demand then isQ(p)=1−F(p)=min{1,(x0/p)α},
28:1059:73861:19:18:71:539:416:119:Times:119:g_d0_f5:implyingPS(p)=min{p,xα0p1−α}. The equilibrium monopoly price is generically a corner solution:p∗=
28:1060:73958:18:18:71:538:398:119:Times:119:Times:x0forα>1 andp∗=∞forα<1. In the knife-edged case ofα=1, the monopolist is indifferent among
28:1061:74048:18:19:71:140:380:119:Times:119:Times:allp∗∈[x0,∞).
28:1062:74061:19:18:89:536:361:119:Times:119:Times:We will proceed with the analysis by considering the caseα>1. Substituting the equilibrium price
28:1063:74157:18:18:72:539:343:119:Times:119:Times:p∗=x0into the expression forPS(p)in the previous paragraph yieldsPS∗=x0. One can further show
28:1064:74250:18:0:71:102:325:119:Times:119:g_d0_f5:TS∗∗=
28:1065:74255:0:11:105:117:333:96:g_d0_f13:64:g_d0_f6:-∞
28:1066:74257:11:0:109:147:322:64:Times:119:g_d0_f5:x0(x0/p)
28:1067:74265:0:23:147:539:329:64:g_d0_f20:119:Times:αdp=αx0/(α−1), implyingρ∗=1−1/α. The lower bound onρ∗is reached in the limit
28:1068:74341:23:18:71:538:306:119:Times:119:Times:asα↓1, when we have limα↓1ρ∗=0. Note that the limit asα↓1 is equivalent to the limit as a general Pareto
28:1069:74445:18:18:71:537:288:119:Times:119:Times:approaches a Zipf. Hence we have recovered the result from Proposition 2 that the worst case on surplus
28:1070:74548:18:18:71:536:270:119:Times:119:Times:extraction is achieved by a Zipf distribution. However, we now appear to have punctured the lower bound
28:1071:74651:18:19:71:538:252:119:g_d0_f7:119:Times:ρ(μ)onρ∗, shown in Section 4.2 to be a positive number depending onμ, whereas for the textbook Pareto
28:1072:74752:19:18:71:537:233:119:Times:119:Times:here the lower bound is 0, independent of the mean consumer value. The apparent discrepancy arises because
28:1073:74858:18:18:71:537:215:119:Times:119:Times:consumer values are unbounded above with the textbook Pareto. Scaling by the infinite peak value produces
28:1074:74963:18:18:71:540:197:119:Times:119:Times:a mean-to-peak ratioμapproaching 0 for the textbook Pareto. Proposition 3 states limμ↓0ρ(μ)=0. Thus the
28:1075:75066:18:19:71:536:179:119:Times:119:Times:textbook Pareto does not contradict Proposition 2 and other earlier results. In equilibrium in the remaining
28:1076:75174:19:18:71:537:160:119:Times:119:Times:(α<1) case, the good is sold at an infinite price to an infinitesimal segment of highest-value consumers,
28:1077:75279:18:18:71:536:142:119:Times:119:Times:straining credibility. As noted in Section 2, the consumer would backward integrate into production before
28:1078:75385:18:19:71:370:124:119:Times:119:Times:paying an infinite price, motivating an upper bound on Pareto values.
28:1079:75454:19:18:89:538:105:119:Times:119:Times:For the rest of the subsection we will consider a modified version of the Pareto with three parameters:
28:1080:75557:18:0:71:539:87:119:Times:119:Times:upper bound on the supportx1in addition to lower boundx0and shape parameterα.  With the upper
29:1081:75652:0:18:72:538:708:119:Times:119:Times:bound, this now fits our maintained model and allows for the required rescaling. Rescaling reduces the
29:1082:75754:18:18:72:538:690:119:Times:119:Times:modified Pareto to a two parameter distribution. Different parameterizations are possible; perhaps the most
29:1083:75861:18:18:72:538:672:119:Times:119:Times:natural specifies shape parameterα>0 and lower boundx0, now interpreted as the lower bound onrescaled
29:1084:75962:18:19:71:538:654:119:Times:119:Times:consumer values, so restricted to the intervalx0∈(0,1). The following rescaled demand captures this

29:1116:77110:23:18:72:538:276:119:Times:119:Times:There exists a large literature in statistics determining when measures of centrality mean, median, and

29:1118:77307:18:19:72:537:240:119:Times:119:Times:of a distribution, the literature seeks conditions under whichμ≤m≤M, the so-called mean-median-mode
29:1119:77406:19:18:72:503:221:119:Times:119:Times:inequality. We begin with a theorem that will allow us to leverage such results to help us boundρ∗.
29:1120:77505:18:18:89:538:203:119:Times:119:Times:The theorem is based on the simple observation that the firm can always ensure that half the consumers
29:1121:77607:18:18:71:538:185:119:Times:119:Times:purchase by charging the medianmrescaled consumer value. By so doing, the monopolist can ensure

30:1152:79328:14:13:71:537:359:119:Times:119:Times:shows (b) is equivalent to (a). Corollaries 1 and 2 of van Zwet (1979) state that, respectively, (c) and (d)
30:1153:79436:13:14:71:537:346:119:Times:119:Times:are sufficient for the mean-median-mode inequality. Finally, Timerding (1915) (cited in Runnenburg 1978)
30:1154:79540:14:14:71:537:332:119:Times:119:Times:shows that (e) is sufficient for the mean-median-mode inequality to hold. Thus each of (a)–(e) imply that

31:1186:80534:18:19:71:536:378:119:Times:119:Times:values of the slope of the density to the left and right of the mode are equal, implying that condition (e) of
31:1187:80644:19:18:71:539:359:119:Times:119:Times:Proposition 9 is satisfied (with equality). The proposition therefore impliesρ∗≥1/2 for this distribution.
31:1188:80750:18:18:71:539:341:119:Times:119:Times:Indeed, we had already argued that Theorem 6 ensuresρ∗≥1/2 for symmetric distributions of rescaled
31:1189:80848:18:18:71:537:323:119:Times:119:Times:values. Densityf2(x)has a mode which is shifted to the right of 1/2 and is not symmetric. Thus we cannot
31:1190:80952:18:19:71:539:305:119:Times:119:Times:immediately conclude from Theorem 6 thatρ∗≥1/2. Still, we see that the density is steeper in absolute

31:1201:81970:13:17:71:537:95:119:Times:119:Times:the mean-median-mode inequality. One can repeat the proof, reversing the inequalities, to show that the

32:1203:82197:0:13:72:537:708:119:Times:119:Times:mean-median-mode inequality holds—and thusμ≤m—for unimodalXfor which max(m−X,0)first order

32:1227:82947:27:18:89:537:474:119:Times:119:Times:Tighter bounds can be derived for the beta distribution. We explained in Section 6.2 that the beta is
32:1228:83048:18:19:71:538:456:119:Times:119:Times:useful in our setting because it has the correct support[0,1]for rescaled consumer values. That section

32:1231:83362:18:18:71:536:401:119:Times:119:Times:might imagine deriving such a formula by substituting analytical expressions for the mean and median of a

32:1233:83575:18:26:71:375:365:119:Times:119:Times:of a beta. Instead we rely on Kerman’s (2011) median approximation.

33:1305:85393:28:18:89:537:236:119:Times:119:Times:Bounds for concave or convex rescaled demand curves can be obtained by substitutingc=1 into (41),
33:1306:85490:18:18:71:539:218:119:Times:119:Times:which yieldsρ∗≥1/2 for concave demand andρ∗≤1/2 for convex demand. Because a line is both concave
33:1307:85587:18:18:71:306:200:119:Times:119:Times:and convex, we have thatρ∗=1/2 for linear demand.
33:1308:85636:18:19:89:537:182:119:Times:119:Times:Figure 10 provides intuition for these results. The case of linear demand is shown in the first panel.
33:1309:85738:19:18:71:538:163:119:Times:119:Times:Results from elementary geometry imply that the area of the largest rectangle that can be inscribed under
33:1310:85843:18:18:71:539:145:119:Times:119:Times:a linear demand curve is half of the area under the curve, so by Lemma 2, which relatesρ∗to these areas,
33:1311:85947:18:19:71:538:127:119:g_d0_f7:119:Times:ρ∗=1/2. The case of concave demand is shown in the second panel. As the figure indicates, the area

34:1332:86975:26:19:72:537:352:119:Times:119:Times:This section provides some calibrations of demand based on the world distribution of income. The calibra-
34:1333:87080:19:18:72:536:333:119:Times:119:Times:tions will serve to show how to apply the STRZ decomposition works in practical settings and to show how
34:1334:87184:18:18:72:308:315:119:Times:119:Times:tight the bound provided by the STRZ demand can be.
34:1335:87235:18:19:89:538:297:119:Times:119:Times:We use the world distribution of income from Pinkovskiy and Sala-i-Martin (2009). Figure 11 repro-
34:1336:87333:19:18:72:537:278:119:Times:119:Times:duces their Figure 21 in the form of a density function, with log scaling of income on the horizontal axis,
34:1337:87440:18:18:72:538:260:119:Times:119:Times:for each decade since 1970, also including 2006. Focusing on the most recent, 2006, estimates and further
34:1338:87545:18:19:72:537:242:119:Times:119:Times:assuming that consumers have unit income elasticity of demand for the product in question leads to the
34:1339:87647:19:18:72:538:223:119:Times:119:Times:demand curve shown as the black curve in Figure 12. This has been rescaled so that the top income is
34:1340:87747:18:18:72:537:205:119:Times:119:Times:given value 1 as the vertical intercept and so that the world population is scaled to have unit mass on the
34:1341:87854:18:18:72:538:187:119:Times:119:Times:horizontal axis. For comparison, the STRZ demand with the same mean value is drawn as the lighter, grey
34:1342:87957:18:19:72:537:169:119:Times:119:Times:curve. Producer surplus calculations will set the constant marginal cost toc=0. This can either be viewed
34:1343:88062:19:18:72:538:150:119:Times:119:Times:as a convenient value for the baseline or an approximation of true cost in certain markets such as software,
34:1344:88170:18:17:72:266:132:119:Times:119:Times:digital media, or even small-molecule drugs.
34:1345:88214:17:14:80:536:115:49:Times:80:Times:16Because of its truncated endpoints, the STRZ demand, while convex over arange, is not globally convex. Thetruncations
34:1346:88333:14:11:72:536:101:80:Times:80:Times:allow the STRZ demand to achieve a lower surplus-extraction ratio than a globally convexdemand having the sameμ. The fact
34:1347:88454:11:11:72:538:90:80:Times:80:Times:from Proposition 13 thatρ∗≤1/2 for convexΦseems inconsistent with the fact thatρ(1)=1. The inconsistency is resolved by
34:1348:88573:11:0:72:373:79:80:Times:80:Times:noting that globally convexdemand curves are unable to generate values ofμnear 1.

35:1359:88799:12:12:72:540:461:99:Times:99:Times:For comparison, STRZ demand with same mean value is drawn as grey curve. Shaded rectangle is monopoly producer
35:1360:88909:12:35:72:189:449:99:Times:99:Times:surplus for zero-cost product.
35:1361:88939:35:18:89:538:414:119:Times:119:Times:Visually, the calibrated demand curve is remarkably similar to its STRZ counterpart. Formally, one can
35:1362:89041:18:19:71:537:396:119:Times:119:Times:compute that the index of Zipf-similarity,Z=0.83. The blocky truncations which have been a prominent
35:1363:89141:19:18:71:472:377:119:Times:119:Times:feature of STRZ demands drawn in previous figures are hardly noticeable in this calibration.
35:1364:89233:18:18:89:539:359:119:Times:119:Times:The mean rescaled consumer value is so low,μ=0.019, that the STRZ demand can only generate a
35:1365:89325:18:18:71:536:341:119:Times:119:Times:surplus-extraction ratio ofρ(0.019)=0.15. The resulting surplus-extraction ratio for the calibrated demand
35:1366:89431:18:19:72:537:323:119:Times:119:Times:curve isρ∗=0.29. That is, a monopolist would only be able to extract 29% of total surplus with a uniform
35:1367:89535:19:18:71:538:304:119:Times:119:Times:price. Hence potential deadweight loss can be as high as 1−ρ∗=71% of total surplus. Producer surplus is
35:1368:89638:18:18:71:536:286:119:Times:119:Times:shown as the area of the shaded rectangle. The monopolist sells to the richest 19% of the world population.
35:1369:89745:18:18:71:536:268:119:Times:119:Times:Deadweight loss from pricing distortions, the area of the Harberger triangle, is 36% of total surplus, or 124%
35:1370:89855:18:19:71:537:250:119:Times:119:Times:of producer surplus. The main message of the calibration is that one does not have to look far for highly
35:1371:89960:19:18:71:488:231:119:Times:119:Times:Zipf-similar demands that generate huge distortions on both the investment and pricing margins.
35:1372:90055:18:18:89:538:213:119:Times:119:Times:Table 1 records these results for the 2006 calibration as well as earlier decades. Looking across columns,
35:1373:90161:18:19:71:537:195:119:Times:119:Times:one can detect a slight sine pattern to the time series of each statistic, but the stronger message from the table
35:1374:90275:19:18:71:537:176:119:Times:119:Times:is the stability of the results over time. This message can be visualized more clearly in Figure 13, which
35:1375:90381:18:18:71:540:158:119:Times:119:Times:graphs the time series one of the more important of these statistics, the potential distortion 1−ρ∗, as the
35:1376:90488:18:19:71:537:140:119:Times:119:Times:black curve. For comparison, the baseline specification represented by the black curve is maintained across
35:1377:90595:19:18:71:537:121:119:Times:119:Times:all of the panels. Each panel represents in effect a different comparative-statics exercise, varying one aspect
35:1378:90706:18:18:71:537:103:119:Times:119:Times:of the calibration at a time. Variations over time in the black curve are quite small compared to some of the
35:1379:90815:18:0:71:422:85:119:Times:119:Times:larger shifts in the curve arising from parameter changes in several of the panels.

37:1381:93063:0:18:89:538:708:119:Times:119:Times:Panel A varies consumers’ income elasticity for the good in question in 0.25 increments from 0.50
37:1382:93160:18:18:71:536:690:119:Times:119:Times:to 1.50. The panel exhibits a robust monotonic relationship, with higher values of the income elasticity
37:1383:93264:18:18:71:535:672:119:Times:119:Times:leading to higher potential distortions. In 2006, for example, the potential distortion is 58% when the
37:1384:93367:18:19:71:535:654:119:Times:119:Times:income elasticity is 0.50, a substantial value but much less than the 75% potential distortion when the
37:1385:93470:19:18:71:537:635:119:Times:119:Times:income elasticity is 1.50. Equation (27) can be used to decompose the increase in potential distortion
37:1386:93572:18:18:71:535:617:119:Times:119:Times:moving the income elasticity from 0.50 to 1.50 into its constituents, showing it is due in roughly equal
37:1387:93676:18:18:71:537:599:119:Times:119:Times:measure (54% versus 46% to be precise) to a greater Zipf-similarity and a smaller mean-to-peak ratio at
37:1388:93779:18:19:71:536:581:119:Times:119:Times:the higher elasticity. Theory does not guarantee the monotonic relationship between elasticity and potential
37:1389:93887:19:18:71:536:562:119:Times:119:Times:distortion observed in Panel A. Theory does guarantees that the distortion disappears in the limit as the
37:1390:93992:18:18:71:538:544:119:Times:119:Times:income elasticity approaches zero: since consumers are homogeneous except for income differences in
37:1391:94091:18:19:71:536:526:119:Times:119:Times:the calibration, setting the income elasticity to zero leads their values to be homogeneous, eliminating any
37:1392:94199:19:18:71:189:507:119:Times:119:Times:distortion by Proposition 1.
37:1393:94227:18:18:89:538:489:119:Times:119:Times:Panel B examines the sensitivity of the results to changes in the good’s marginal cost. The baseline
37:1394:94327:18:19:71:536:471:119:Times:119:Times:calibration represented by the black curve involves costless production. Lighter grey curves represent cali-
37:1395:94435:19:18:71:537:452:119:Times:119:Times:brations for higher marginal costs. Marginal cost is measured as a percentage of peak consumer value; thus
37:1396:94541:18:18:71:537:434:119:Times:119:Times:at marginal costs higher than 100%, the demand of even the highest value consumer ends up being choked
37:1397:94643:18:18:71:537:416:119:Times:119:Times:off by a price that covers marginal cost. A marginal cost equal to 0.1% of peak value ends up being small in
37:1398:94751:18:19:71:536:398:119:Times:119:Times:that it does not result in a marked change in potential distortion (or other variables not shown in the graph
37:1399:94860:19:18:71:536:379:119:Times:119:Times:such as price or quantity) compared to the baseline calibration. Moving to yet higher marginal costs such as
37:1400:94968:18:18:71:536:361:119:Times:119:Times:1% or 10% of peak value causes more substantial declines in potential distortion. In 2006, for example, the
37:1401:95075:18:19:71:536:343:119:Times:119:Times:potential distortion falls from 71% to 65% when marginal cost rises from 0 to 10%. Using equation (27),
37:1402:95178:19:18:71:536:324:119:Times:119:Times:we can again decompose this change into its constituents, showing it is due now in precisely equal measure
37:1403:95284:18:18:71:537:306:119:Times:119:Times:to a greater Zipf-similarity and a smaller mean-to-peak ratio of consumer values net of the higher marginal

37:1406:95496:18:30:71:536:251:119:Times:119:Times:at alternative sources of data for the income distribution. Pinkovskiy and Sala-i-Martin (2009) adjust the

38:1414:95948:0:18:72:537:708:119:Times:119:Times:incomes in their distributions by purchasing power parity (PPP), so that people with equal incomes in two
38:1415:96053:18:18:72:539:690:119:Times:119:Times:different countries are roughly as well off. The baseline black curve in Panel C reflects this PPP adjustment.
38:1416:96163:18:18:72:537:672:119:Times:119:Times:The PPP adjustment is natural when examining world poverty and inequality. Our goal is different: we are
38:1417:96267:18:19:72:536:654:119:Times:119:Times:interested in the profit that a monopolist makes in selling to individuals in all these countries at a price in the
38:1418:96382:19:18:72:539:635:119:Times:119:Times:monopolist’s home currency. Thus, the market-exchange-rate adjusted incomes might be a better measure of
38:1419:96486:18:18:72:537:617:119:Times:119:Times:people’s ability to pay in this currency. Calibrations for the income distribution based on market-exchange-
38:1420:96594:18:18:72:537:599:119:Times:119:Times:rate adjustment are given by the lightest grey curve. This adjustment leads to a modest reduction, less than
38:1421:96702:18:19:72:538:581:119:Times:119:Times:four percentage points on average across years, in potential distortion. Perhaps the most realistic adjustment
38:1422:96812:19:18:72:539:562:119:Times:119:Times:is the 50-50 mix of PPP and market-exchange-rate adjustment shown as the medium grey curve. We see this
38:1423:96915:18:18:72:381:544:119:Times:119:Times:is quite close to the black curve reflecting the baseline PPP adjustment.
38:1424:96988:18:19:89:538:526:119:Times:119:Times:Panel F examines a different source for the income distribution, Lakner and Milanovic (2015). While
38:1425:97087:19:18:72:537:507:119:Times:119:Times:different data sources may lead to different conclusions about poverty and other issues important to those
38:1426:97193:18:18:72:537:489:119:Times:119:Times:authors, for our purposes, they result in fairly small differences in potential distortion, certainly small com-
38:1427:97305:18:19:72:538:471:119:Times:119:Times:pared to the differences observed in some of the previous panels. The two curves would almost perfectly
38:1428:97408:19:18:72:538:452:119:Times:119:Times:overlap if we shifted the Pinkovskiy and Sala-i-Martin (2009) curve ahead or the Lakner and Milanovic
38:1429:97509:18:18:72:256:434:119:Times:119:Times:(2015) curve back by roughly seven years.
38:1430:97550:18:18:89:538:416:119:Times:119:Times:The remaining four panels move from robustness to more interesting counterfactual exercises. Panel E
38:1431:97650:18:19:72:536:398:119:Times:119:Times:shows how the distortion changes if instead of the world market, the product is only sold in a single devel-
38:1432:97758:19:18:72:537:379:119:Times:119:Times:oped market such as the United States or the European Union. One might guess that surplus is more easily
38:1433:97862:18:18:72:537:361:119:Times:119:Times:extracted in the single market, resulting in a smaller potential distortion (as a percentage of available social
38:1434:97974:18:19:72:537:343:119:Times:119:Times:surplus). Panel E shows this is indeed the case. Potential distortion drops by roughly ten percentage points.
38:1435:98083:19:18:72:537:324:119:Times:119:Times:Although the level shifts down for the individual markets, their time paths are remarkably similar to that for
38:1436:98193:18:18:72:537:306:119:Times:119:Times:the world. Also remarkable is that the potential distortion is nearly identical whether the United States or the
38:1437:98305:18:19:72:537:288:119:Times:119:Times:European Union is taken to be the single market. The decomposition formula (27) shows that the reduction
38:1438:98409:19:18:72:537:269:119:Times:119:Times:in potential distortion moving from the world to a single developed market is mostly due to the fact that a
38:1439:98516:18:18:72:538:251:119:Times:119:Times:demand curve based on the world income distribution is more Zipf-similar than one based on the U.S. or
38:1440:98618:18:18:72:537:233:119:Times:119:Times:E.U. distribution. For example, over 70% of the decline in potential distortion moving from the world to the
38:1441:98726:18:19:72:321:215:119:Times:119:Times:U.S. market in 2006 is due to a decline in Zipf-similarity.
38:1442:98785:19:18:89:539:196:119:Times:64:Times:Panel F examines shows how the potential distortion is affected by the ability to price discriminate.17
38:1443:98888:18:18:72:537:178:119:Times:119:Times:The black curve is the benchmark case in which no price discrimination is possible; the monopolist has to
38:1444:98993:18:18:72:538:160:119:Times:119:Times:sell on the world market at a single uniform price. The grey curve allows the monopolist to charge a different
38:1445:99103:18:19:72:537:142:119:Times:119:Times:price in each country; i.e., the monopolist can discriminate across but not within countries. This form of
38:1446:99209:19:18:72:537:123:119:Times:119:Times:price discrimination allows the monopolist to extract more surplus from the world market, reducing the
38:1447:99311:18:17:72:536:105:119:Times:119:Times:potential distortion by roughly ten percentage points. Coincidentally, the decline in the potential distortion
38:1448:99421:17:14:80:537:88:49:Times:80:Times:17See Alessandria and Kaboski (2011) for a discussion of the extent of price discrimination across world markets in tradable
38:1449:99545:14:0:72:96:74:80:Times:80:Times:goods.
39:1450:99553:0:18:72:444:708:119:Times:119:Times:is about equal to that from moving to a single developed market in the previous panel.
39:1451:99639:18:18:89:537:690:119:Times:119:Times:Panel G analyzes the role for a redistributive tax to reduce the potential distortion. In particular, the
39:1452:99744:18:18:72:537:672:119:Times:119:Times:counterfactual involves the imposition of a proportional income tax at ratet, with tax revenues returned to
39:1453:99851:18:19:72:538:654:119:Times:119:Times:consumers in equal lump sums. The idea is that this should compress extreme consumer values, making
39:1454:99950:19:18:72:539:635:119:Times:119:Times:the demand curve less Zipf similar and the market more lucrative. Surprisingly, for small tax rates, we see
39:1455:100057:18:18:72:537:617:119:Times:119:Times:the opposite effect, exacerbating the potential distortion. The exacerbation peaks at about thet=15% rate
39:1456:100162:18:18:72:537:599:119:Times:119:Times:shown, raising potential distortion from the baseline with no tax by an average of almost two percentage
39:1457:100266:18:19:72:538:581:119:Times:119:Times:points. The firm ends up serving a similar group of relatively rich consumers but makes less money doing
39:1458:100370:19:18:72:538:562:119:Times:119:Times:so because their after-tax incomes have fallen. Sufficiently high tax rates lead to a wholesale change in
39:1459:100475:18:18:72:537:544:119:Times:119:Times:the monopolist’s pricing strategy. For example, at the highest rate shown, 45%, the monopolist finds it
39:1460:100578:18:19:72:538:526:119:Times:119:Times:profitable to serve almost all consumers since the poorest have substantial incomes after redistribution.
39:1461:100683:19:18:72:539:507:119:Times:119:Times:Using this strategy, the producer surplus ratio,ρ∗, approaches the tax rate,t=45%, leaving the residual
39:1462:100786:18:18:71:538:489:119:Times:119:Times:1−ρ∗, graphed as the lightest grey curve, in essence as a constant of height 1−45%=55%. We conclude
39:1463:100885:18:19:71:536:471:119:Times:119:Times:that a redistributive tax can improve innovation incentives but can have the opposite effect so care must be
39:1464:100993:19:18:71:114:452:119:Times:119:Times:exercised.
39:1465:101003:18:18:89:537:434:119:Times:119:Times:The last panel analyzes a different redistributive policy, focusing on the top 1% of consumers that re-
39:1466:101106:18:18:71:536:416:119:Times:119:Times:ceived attention in recent discussions of income inequality. The policy takes the income these consumers
39:1467:101210:18:19:71:536:398:119:Times:119:Times:have in excess of the marginal consumer just outside of the top category and redistributes that to all con-
39:1468:101317:19:18:71:537:379:119:Times:119:Times:sumers in an equal lump sum. For example, in a population of 100 consumers, one with an income of $100
39:1469:101419:18:18:71:537:361:119:Times:119:Times:and the rest with incomes of $10, we take $90 from the richest consumer and distribute 90 cents in a lump
39:1470:101524:18:19:71:536:343:119:Times:119:Times:sum to all consumers, so that all 100 end up with $10.90 as a result of the policy. As other alternatives,
39:1471:101630:19:18:71:536:324:119:Times:119:Times:we pursue an analogous policy but expand the set of consumers considered to be in the top bracket, from
39:1472:101733:18:18:71:537:306:119:Times:119:Times:whom income is redistributed, from 1% to 10% to 20%. Panel H presents the results. Unlike the tax policy,
39:1473:101838:18:19:71:536:288:119:Times:119:Times:this more targeted policy reduces potential distortion in all cases examined. The policy redistributes income
39:1474:101947:19:18:71:537:269:119:Times:119:Times:from the monopolist’s inframarginal to its marginal purchasers, increasing producer surplus. By contrast,
39:1475:102052:18:18:71:537:251:119:Times:119:Times:the 15% tax reduced the income of the monopolist’s marginal purchasers, and so reduced producer surplus.
39:1476:102156:18:18:71:536:233:119:Times:119:Times:The policy reduces potential distortion in rough proportion to the size of the top bracket. So, redistribution
39:1477:102266:18:19:71:536:215:119:Times:119:Times:from the top 1% reduces the potential distortion by about one percentage point (1% of baseline distortion),
39:1478:102373:19:18:71:536:196:119:Times:119:Times:redistribution from the top 10% reduces potential distortion by about five percentage points (7% of baseline
39:1479:102481:18:18:71:536:178:119:Times:119:Times:distortion), and redistribution from the top 25% reduces potential distortion by about 15 percentage points
39:1480:102588:18:39:71:195:160:119:Times:119:Times:(22% of baseline distortion).
39:1481:102617:39:26:72:159:121:206:Times:206:Times:8. Conclusion
39:1482:102630:26:18:72:538:95:119:Times:119:Times:As clarified by Makowski and Ostroy (1995, 2001), efficiency depends on agents’ ability to capture the
39:1483:102732:18:0:72:537:77:119:Times:119:Times:social benefits they create. We first show that the amount of surplus a monopolist cannot extract provides a
40:1484:102842:0:18:72:464:708:119:Times:119:Times:tight upper bound on deadweight loss from all sources (entry as well as pricing decisions).
40:1485:102933:18:18:89:538:690:119:Times:119:Times:We then show that this worst case is itself worst for the STRZ demand. This demand curve entails a
40:1486:103031:18:18:72:536:672:119:Times:119:Times:Zipf distribution for consumers’ valuations net of marginal cost, with a doubling of the value cutting the
40:1487:103137:18:19:72:538:654:119:Times:119:Times:number of consumers with that value or higher in half. With this worst case in hand, we can relate the
40:1488:103239:19:18:72:537:635:119:Times:119:Times:potential deadweight loss in a broad class of markets—those with finite demand intercepts, required for the
40:1489:103346:18:18:72:537:617:119:Times:119:Times:needed rescaling—to the Zipf-similarity of the rescaled demand curve. Holding constant Zipf-similarity, the
40:1490:103453:18:18:72:538:599:119:Times:119:Times:other factor limiting surplus extraction is the ratio of the mean to the peak of net consumer values. If the
40:1491:103561:18:19:72:538:581:119:Times:119:Times:demand is sufficiently Zipf similar and the ratio of mean to peak net consumer value is sufficiently low, the
40:1492:103670:19:18:72:537:562:119:Times:119:Times:ratio of producer to total surplus can be arbitrarily close to zero and distortions can come arbitrarily close to
40:1493:103783:18:18:72:217:544:119:Times:119:Times:dissipating 100% of total surplus.
40:1494:103817:18:19:89:538:526:119:Times:119:Times:Our demand calibration based on the world distribution of income provides a measure of the practical
40:1495:103917:19:18:72:538:507:119:Times:119:Times:relevance of the STRZ bound. The calibration is based on a number of assumptions (unit income elasticity,
40:1496:104022:18:18:72:537:489:119:Times:119:Times:zero production cost), which may be good approximations for some products and not others but was a neutral
40:1497:104128:18:19:72:538:471:119:Times:119:Times:starting point. The calibrated demand in Figure 12 looks remarkably similar to its STRZ lower bound. Both
40:1498:104233:19:18:72:537:452:119:Times:119:Times:hug the axes so tightly that it would be hard for a monoplist to extract surplus for its product. According
40:1499:104340:18:18:72:537:434:119:Times:119:Times:to our theory, 72% of total surplus could be dissipated due to the poor investment incentives demands with
40:1500:104446:18:18:72:538:416:119:Times:119:Times:such shapes provide. As the income distribution evolved over time from 1970 to the present, calibrated
40:1501:104548:18:19:72:388:398:119:Times:119:Times:potential deadweight loss was worst in 2000 and improved slightly since.
40:1502:104620:19:18:89:538:379:119:Times:119:Times:The Zipf perspective provides an argument for R&D distortions being greater for product than process
40:1503:104720:18:18:72:537:361:119:Times:119:Times:innovations. The upper tail of the distribution of values may be Zipf-similar for a new product for which
40:1504:104825:18:19:72:537:343:119:Times:119:Times:there are few good substitutes, but the upper tail of the distribution of values for a cost-reducing innovation
40:1505:104936:19:18:72:538:324:119:Times:119:Times:is necessarily truncated at the price of the more expensive product it is replacing. The ratio of the mean-to-
40:1506:105046:18:18:72:537:306:119:Times:119:Times:peak consumer value will thus tend to be lower with the product innovation, leading to a greater potential
40:1507:105152:18:19:72:160:288:119:Times:119:Times:for deadweight loss.
40:1508:105172:19:18:89:538:269:119:Times:119:Times:To the extent that policymakers can identify which markets have Zipf-similar demands, they may wish
40:1509:105271:18:18:72:536:251:119:Times:119:Times:to target R&D subsidies there. For example, the Zipf-similarity of the risk distribution (see Liljeroset al.
40:1510:105379:18:18:72:538:233:119:Times:119:Times:2001 for a characterization of the power-law distribution of number of sexual partners) may lead to a Zipf-
40:1511:105486:18:19:72:538:215:119:Times:119:Times:similar demand for an HIV vaccine. This argument is consistent with claims made by industry observers
40:1512:105587:19:18:72:538:196:119:Times:119:Times:(e.g., Thomas 2002) that an HIV vaccine would be far less luractive than the potential social benefit it would
40:1513:105697:18:18:72:538:178:119:Times:119:Times:provide. Because the harm from HIV is so serious, total surplus and hence the absolute magnitude of the
40:1514:105800:18:18:72:537:160:119:Times:119:Times:potential distortion from underinvestment, is likely high. This provides a rationale for programs such as the
40:1515:105909:18:19:72:538:142:119:Times:119:Times:International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) that support vaccine research. To take a very different example,
40:1516:106018:19:18:72:536:123:119:Times:119:Times:the case for cities to subsidize sports stadia will be stronger if the distribution of valuation is Zipf-similar
40:1517:106130:18:18:72:251:105:119:Times:119:Times:than if it is closer to being homogeneous.
40:1518:106172:18:0:89:537:87:119:Times:119:Times:Regarding policy toward price discrimination, our analysis shows that the potential deadweight loss of
41:1519:106276:0:18:72:538:708:119:Times:119:Times:banning price discrimination is greater the more Zipf-similar is demand. Conversely, the potential for price
41:1520:106384:18:18:72:537:690:119:Times:119:Times:discrimination to increase producer surplus, and thus investment incentives, is greatest when the distribution
41:1521:106494:18:18:72:186:672:119:Times:119:Times:of demand is Zipf-similar.
41:1522:106520:18:19:89:537:654:119:Times:119:Times:The conclusion has so far focused on deadweight loss at the investment/entry margin, rightly so because
41:1523:106623:19:18:72:538:635:119:Times:119:Times:that is the margin that the theory shows can generate the greatest deadweight loss. However, the paper
41:1524:106725:18:18:72:536:617:119:Times:119:Times:provides a suite of results taking investment/entry as given and just considering distortions at the pricing
41:1525:106833:18:18:72:538:599:119:Times:119:Times:margin. The same STRZ demands that had the highest potential for deadweight loss at the investment/entry
41:1526:106937:18:19:72:537:581:119:Times:119:Times:margin also has the highest potential for deadweight loss at the pricing margin. The policy implications of
41:1527:107044:19:18:72:537:562:119:Times:119:Times:this set of theoretical results are quite interesting and deserve note. Facing a Zipf-similar distribution of net
41:1528:107157:18:18:72:537:544:119:Times:119:Times:consumer values, the monopolist may be close to indifferent between widely disbursed prices that induce
41:1529:107260:18:19:72:537:526:119:Times:119:Times:very different shares of the population to purchase the good and that realize very different proportions of
41:1530:107367:19:18:72:536:507:119:Times:119:Times:potential consumer surplus. A tiny subsidy could be enough to drive the equilibrium toward that with
41:1531:107467:18:18:72:538:489:119:Times:119:Times:high output and a small Harberger triangle. The outcome could also be achieved with an appropriate price
41:1532:107571:18:19:72:538:471:119:Times:119:Times:ceiling. Unlike familiar cases in which a price cap might correct a pricing distortion but of course reduce
41:1533:107678:19:18:72:538:452:119:Times:119:Times:producer surplus and impair investment/entry incentives, with a STRZ demand or demand close to it, a price
41:1534:107784:18:18:72:538:434:119:Times:119:Times:cap would only have a small effect on investment/entry incentives if the firm were essentially indifferent
41:1535:107890:18:18:72:538:416:119:Times:119:Times:between pre- and post-cap prices. Thus subsidies and price caps can potentially be very effective in markets
41:1536:107998:18:19:72:190:398:119:Times:119:Times:with Zipf-similar demands.
41:1537:108024:19:18:89:537:379:119:Times:119:Times:Larger subsidies would be needed to completely eliminate distortions in other situations. Whether the
41:1538:108125:18:18:72:537:361:119:Times:119:Times:policymaker wishes to eliminate pricing distortions when the demand curve is not Zipf-similar or the de-
41:1539:108229:18:19:72:536:343:119:Times:119:Times:mand is Zipf-similar but the policymaker wishes to address investment/entry distortions in addition to price
41:1540:108337:19:18:72:537:324:119:Times:119:Times:distortions, if taxes can be raised on a dollar-for-dollar basis with no additional social cost of public funds,
41:1541:108449:18:18:72:538:306:119:Times:119:Times:the first best can be obtained by offering a subsidy ofTS∗∗/q∗∗per unit sold at marginal cost. We showed that
41:1542:108558:18:19:71:536:288:119:Times:119:Times:the gain from such a policy is tightly bounded above by, again, the unextracted surplus on the market, i.e.,
41:1543:108666:19:18:71:538:269:119:Times:119:Times:total minus producer surplus. In a range of cases—software, movies, music, some small molecule drugs—it
41:1544:108769:18:18:71:536:251:119:Times:119:Times:is plausible that the policymaker knows this marginal cost and that it is close to zero. If the policymaker
41:1545:108876:18:18:71:536:233:119:Times:119:Times:is constrained in the size of subsidies it can offer, although it may not attain the first best, it may still be
41:1546:108988:18:19:71:536:215:119:Times:119:Times:able to ameliorate investment and pricing distortions with a modest subsidy, and the subsidy dollar can be
41:1547:109094:19:0:71:507:196:119:Times:119:Times:leveraged most fully if the policymaker can target the subsidy to the lowest net valuation consumers.
42:1548:109197:0:24:72:311:708:206:Times:206:Times:Appendix A: Proofs Omitted from Text
42:1549:109233:24:14:72:538:684:119:Times:119:Times:Proof of Theorem 2:We will first analyze a ban on price discrimination. Let superscriptddenote the
42:1550:109331:14:13:72:538:670:119:Times:119:Times:equilibrium values of variables under a given form of price discrimination (as distinct from stars, denoting
42:1551:109439:13:14:72:537:657:119:Times:119:Times:equilibrium values under linear pricing, and double stars, denoting socially optimal values). The distortion
42:1552:109547:14:14:72:231:643:119:Times:119:Times:from banning price discrimination is
42:1553:109583:14:19:273:540:629:119:Times:119:Times:EdWd−E∗W∗,(A1)
42:1554:109597:19:14:71:539:610:119:Times:119:Times:obviously maximized for the form of price discrimination generating the highestEdWd. First-degree price
42:1555:109700:14:14:71:538:596:119:Times:119:Times:discrimination allows the firm to captureW∗∗as profit, inducing the firm to make the socially optimal entry
42:1556:109807:14:13:71:538:582:119:Times:119:Times:decisionE∗∗. Hence social welfare under first-degree price discrimination isE∗∗W∗∗. Substituting into (A1)
42:1557:109913:13:14:71:539:569:119:Times:119:Times:yieldsE∗∗W∗∗−E∗W∗, which equalsDWL∗by definition. Of courseEdWdcannot be higher than in the first
42:1558:110010:14:13:71:538:555:119:Times:119:Times:best, so (A1) cannot be higher thanDWL∗. ThusDWL∗is a tight upper bound on the distortion from banning
42:1559:110112:13:14:71:161:542:119:Times:119:Times:price discrimination.
42:1560:110133:14:13:89:537:528:119:Times:119:Times:We next establish the bound on the welfare gain from the subsidy policy. Specifically, consider the
42:1561:110232:13:14:71:539:515:119:Times:119:Times:policy of providing a per-unit subsidy ofTS∗∗/q∗∗for all units the firm sells at marginal costc. The firm can
42:1562:110341:14:14:71:539:501:119:Times:119:Times:earn producer surplusTS∗∗from accepting the policy and chargingcto allq∗∗who buy. There is no strategy
42:1563:110443:14:13:71:537:487:119:Times:119:Times:that would allow the firm to earn more thanTS∗∗, so it is indeed an equilibrium for it to accept the policy
42:1564:110550:13:13:71:537:474:119:Times:119:Times:and chargec. To construct an upper bound, we will consider the best-case scenario of no social cost of
42:1565:110652:13:14:71:536:461:119:Times:119:Times:public funds. Then producer surplus equals the transfer from the government and nets out of social surplus,
42:1566:110759:14:14:71:539:447:119:Times:119:Times:leaving consumer surplus, which equalsTS∗∗given marginal-cost pricing. Social welfare from the policy is
42:1567:110863:14:13:71:539:433:119:Times:119:Times:thusW∗∗. The government can ensure the first bestE∗∗W∗∗by offering the policy if and only ifW∗∗>0.
42:1568:110961:13:14:71:539:420:119:Times:119:Times:The gain from the policy is thusE∗∗W∗∗−E∗W∗=DWL∗. Of course welfare from any other policy cannot
42:1569:111057:14:29:71:516:406:119:Times:119:Times:exceedE∗∗W∗∗, so we have constructed a tight upper bound on the gain from subsidy policies.Q.E.D.
42:1570:111154:29:14:71:538:377:119:Times:119:Times:Proof of Theorem 3:The analysis closely follows the proof of Theorem 1. Because the monopoly’s entry
42:1571:111254:14:13:71:537:363:119:Times:119:Times:decision depends on the samekas before, it continues to be characterized by the partition into the three
42:1572:111358:13:14:71:536:350:119:Times:119:Times:subintervals shown in Figure 4. The only change is the computation of deadweight loss whenkfalls into
42:1573:111459:14:13:71:543:336:119:Times:119:Times:the moderate subinterval(PS∗,TS∗∗). While deadweight loss still equals all of first-best welfareW∗∗,now
42:1574:111562:13:14:71:539:323:119:Times:119:Times:W∗∗=TS∗∗−(1−β)kbecauseβkis not a social cost. SinceW∗∗is decreasing ink, the supremum over
42:1575:111652:14:13:71:540:309:119:Times:119:Times:the moderate subinterval ofkis achieved at the lower boundary,k=PS∗, where it equalsTS∗∗−(1−β)PS∗.
42:1576:111750:13:14:71:537:296:119:Times:119:Times:This expression is decreasing inβ, attaining its minimum value over feasibleβforβ=0. This minimum
42:1577:111847:14:13:71:538:282:119:Times:119:Times:value,TS∗∗−PS∗, was shown in the proof of Theorem 1 to exceed the potential deadweight loss in the other
42:1578:111951:13:14:71:537:269:119:Times:119:Times:subintervals. HenceTS∗∗−(1−β)PS∗is the bound on potential deadweight loss. To express as a proportion,
42:1579:112053:14:29:71:305:255:119:Times:119:Times:divide through byTS∗∗, yielding equation (3).Q.E.D.
