2:32:1814:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:This  paper  presents  a  two-step  identification  argument  for  a  large  class  of  quasilinear  utility 
2:33:1923:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:trading games,  imputing  agents'  values  using  revealed  preference  based  on  their  choices  from  a 
2:34:2029:14:14:72:542:560:12:Times:12:Times:convex menu of expected outcomes available in equilibrium. This generalizes many existing two-
2:35:2122:14:14:71:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:step  approaches in  the  auctions  literature  and  applies  to  many  cases  for  which  there  are  no 
2:36:2227:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:existing tools and where the econometrician may not know the precise rules of the game, such as 
2:37:2322:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:incomplete-information bargaining settings. We also derive a methodology for settings in which 
2:38:2416:14:14:71:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:agents' actions are not perfectly observed, bounding menus and agents' utilities based on features 
2:39:2514:14:14:71:545:490:12:Times:12:Times:of  the  data  that  shift  agents'  imperfectly  observed actions.   We  propose  nonparametric  value 
2:40:2617:14:14:72:545:476:12:Times:12:Times:estimation  procedures  based  on  our  identification  results for  general  trading  games.  Our 
2:41:2715:14:14:72:546:462:12:Times:12:Times:procedures can be combined with previously existing tools for handling unobserved heterogeneity 
2:42:2810:14:14:72:545:448:12:Times:12:Times:and non-independent types. We apply our results to analyze efficiency and surplus division in the 
2:43:2907:14:14:72:545:434:12:Times:12:Times:complex  game  played  at  wholesale  used-car  auctions,  that  of  a  secret  reserve price  auction 
2:44:3009:14:42:72:407:420:12:Times:12:Times:followed by sequential bargaining between the seller and high bidder.

3:59:3393:27:17:91:511:661:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:A frequent goal of the growing empirical literature studying mechanism and market design
3:60:3481:17:17:79:511:644:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:is to compare outcomes of a mechanism that is used in practice to outcomes under a theo-
3:61:3569:17:17:79:511:627:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:retical counterfactual benchmark, such as some benchmark notion of efficiency, optimality,
3:62:3659:17:17:79:511:610:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:or equity.  In order to make such counterfactual comparisons, the econometrican must first
3:63:3749:17:16:79:511:593:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:estimate primitives (principally, distributions of players’ valuations) under the mechanism
3:64:3840:16:17:79:511:577:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:used in practice. Given advances in the methodological literature over the past twenty years,
3:65:3933:17:17:79:511:560:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:such an exercise is straightforward for certain types of real-world mechanisms, such as first
3:66:4026:17:17:79:511:543:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:price auctions.  A number of games observed in the real world, however, are quite complex
3:67:4115:17:17:79:511:526:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and do not have clear-cut equilibrium characterizactions from which the researcher can infer
3:68:4207:17:17:79:511:509:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:valuations with off-the-shelf tools.  Examples of such complex incomplete-information trad-
3:69:4298:17:16:79:511:492:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ing games include alternating-offer bargaining games, simultaneous-move bargaining games,
3:70:4387:16:17:79:511:476:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:non-standard auctions (such as median-price or average-price auctions), auctions preceded
3:71:4476:17:17:79:511:459:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:by a knockout auction (as in cases of collusion), and auctions followed by bargaining (or
3:72:4565:17:17:79:511:442:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the  reverse).   In  such  settings,  analytically  solving  for  equilibria  is  difficult,  and  general
3:73:4671:17:20:79:367:425:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:proposals for identification and estimation have been scarce.
3:74:4732:20:17:91:511:405:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The theoretical mechanism design literature tackles analysis of such games by abstracting
3:75:4821:17:17:79:511:388:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:away  from  the  particular  rules  of  the  game  or  extensive  form  of  the  game  and  instead
3:76:4920:17:17:79:511:371:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:focusing  on  the  direct  mechanism  corresponding  to  an  equilibrium  of  the  original  game
3:77:5017:17:17:79:511:354:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(following the celebrated Revelation Principle, Myerson 1979).  In this paper, we adopt a
3:78:5106:17:17:79:511:337:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:similar approach for empirical analysis, abstracting away from the rules or extensive form
3:79:5196:17:16:79:511:320:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of  the  game  and  instead  focusing  on  revealed  preference  arguments  to  develop  a  unified
3:80:5295:16:21:79:492:304:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:approach to identification and estimation of players’ valuations in such trading games.
3:81:5382:21:17:91:511:283:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We  focus  on  a  class  of  single-unit,  transferable  utility  trading  games  in  which  players
3:82:5482:17:17:79:511:266:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:have independent private values and their utilities are linear in these values.  This nests a
3:83:5575:17:16:79:511:249:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:number of games, such as various kinds of auctions and bargaining games.  In such a setting,
3:84:5667:16:17:79:510:233:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:a player with valuationvwho plays actiona(such an action could be a bid in an auction
3:85:5752:17:17:79:511:216:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:or an offer in bargaining) receives an expected payoff ofvP(a) −T(a), whereP(a)is the
3:86:5837:17:17:79:511:199:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:probability of winning the good andT(a)is the transfer paid by the player in expectation
3:87:5925:17:17:79:510:182:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:when choosing actiona.  Our identification argument is simple:  An agent’s action can be
3:88:6013:17:17:79:511:165:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:considered to be a choice from a convex menu of possible(P,T)pairs, and subgradients of
3:89:6100:17:16:79:511:148:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:this menu provide bounds on the agents value.  When the action space is continuous, the
3:90:6187:16:17:79:511:132:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:derivative of this menu, evaluated at the action chosen by the agent, corresponds precisely
3:91:6278:17:17:79:511:115:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:to the agent’s value.  The data requirements for identifying an agent’s value are thus that
3:92:6369:17:17:79:511:98:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the econometrician observe the final allocation,  the final transfer,  and the agent’s action
3:93:6462:17:0:79:510:81:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f8:from many independent instances of the same underlying game; the objectsP(·)andT(·)
4:94:6562:0:17:79:511:688:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:are  then  essentially  observed  in  the  data,  and  subgradients  of  the  menu  identify  agents’
4:95:6663:17:21:79:111:671:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:values.
4:96:6670:21:16:91:511:650:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:This is a simple revealed preference argument, and it is by no means new to the theoretical
4:97:6761:16:17:79:511:634:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:mechanism design literature.  The novelty of our paper is to exploit this argument to obtain
4:98:6853:17:17:79:511:617:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:a general identification—and accompanying estimation—approach that applies to a broad
4:99:6938:17:17:79:511:600:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:class  of  games  regardless  of  the  specific  rules  of  the  game,  which  is  applicable  even  in
4:100:7041:17:17:79:511:583:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:cases where the econometrician may be unaware of the actual rules of the game, such as
4:101:7127:17:17:79:511:566:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:when  prices  arise  from  some  unknown  negotiation  process.   Furthermore,  our  approach
4:102:7220:17:17:79:511:549:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:can apply to games in which, even if the rules are known, equilibrium outcomes may not
4:103:7306:17:16:79:511:532:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:be uniquely predicted by the model (due to the possibility of multiple equilibria) or may
4:104:7395:16:17:79:511:516:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:simply be difficult to characterize analytically.  Each of these features of our approach are
4:105:7488:17:17:79:511:499:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:not particularly advantageous in a well-understood setting such as a first price auctions,
4:106:7578:17:17:79:511:482:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:where the theoretical model has a unique, simple-to-characterize equilibrium and where the
4:107:7668:17:17:79:511:465:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:rules of the game are known.  In a number of other settings, however, our approach can be
4:108:7757:17:20:79:113:448:11:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:useful.1
4:109:7765:20:17:91:511:428:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:A  particular  novel  feature  of  this  paper  is  the  application  of  these  identification  and
4:110:7865:17:17:79:511:411:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:estimation concepts to cases where actions are imperfectly observed by the econometrician.
4:111:7955:17:17:79:511:394:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:This can include settings where only a portion of an agent’s actions are observed, such as a
4:112:8047:17:16:79:511:377:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:multistage auction mechanism where the econometrician observes an indicative (first-stage)
4:113:8137:16:17:79:511:361:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:bid  and  the  final  allocation  and  price,  but  not  intermediate-stage  actions;  or  a  bilateral
4:114:8240:17:17:79:511:344:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:bargaining setting where the econometrician may observe a seller’s list price and an indicator
4:115:8334:17:17:79:511:327:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:for whether or not a sale occurs and (if a sale does occur) the final negotiated price, but
4:116:8425:17:17:79:511:310:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:not the full sequence of intermediate bargaining actions.  The imperfectly observed action
4:117:8515:17:17:79:511:293:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:case can also include cases where the action is not observed at all but the econometrician
4:118:8605:17:17:79:511:276:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:observes a variable in the data that is correlated with that agent’s action and not with other
4:119:8699:17:16:79:511:259:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:agents’ actions, similar to an instrumental variable.  We provide conditions under which our
4:120:8791:16:17:79:511:243:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:identification and estimation approach can be used to approximate equilibrium menus and
4:121:8878:17:21:79:508:226:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:players’ values, and we provide conditions under which this approximation will work well.
4:122:8967:21:16:91:511:205:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We derive nonparametric estimation procedures to accompany these identification argu-
4:123:9052:16:17:79:511:189:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ments.  We consider both continuous- or discrete-action settings.  For the continuous action
4:124:9144:17:17:79:511:172:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:case, we propose a local polynomial regression procedure.  The general trading game model
4:125:9233:17:17:79:511:155:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:imposes the restriction that equilibrium menus must be convex, and therefore we also pro-

4:128:9442:35:15:79:511:86:8:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f11:1Our approach can be thought of as a generalization of the first price auction approach of Guerre, Perrigne,
4:129:9550:15:0:79:479:71:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:and Vuong (2000) to settings where the rules of the game or equilibrium of the game are unknown.
5:130:9714:0:17:91:511:688:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We  analyze  the  performance  of  our  estimation  procedure  in  simulations  of  first  price
5:131:9810:17:17:79:511:671:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:auctions relative to the approach of Guerre, Perrigne, and Vuong (2000).  While our esti-
5:132:9899:17:17:79:511:654:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:mator performs well in terms of finite-sample mean squared error, the approach of Guerre,
5:133:9988:17:17:79:511:637:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Perrigne, and Vuong (2000) clearly outperforms our estimator, as it exploits the knowledge
5:134:10078:17:17:79:511:620:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that  the  game  is  indeed  a  first  price  auction.   We  then  simulate  the  bilateral  bargaining
5:135:10181:17:16:79:511:603:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:game studied in Satterthwaite and Williams (1989) and tie our hands, treating the simu-
5:136:10268:16:17:79:511:587:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:lated data as though it came from a bargaining game with an unknown extensive form, as
5:137:10354:17:17:79:511:570:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:is this case with bargaining data in many real-world settings.2We demonstrate that our
5:138:10440:17:17:79:511:553:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:method again performs well.  We emphasize that if a researcher is analyzing a game with
5:139:10527:17:17:79:511:536:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:known rules and an existing,  well-established estimation approach,  as in the case of first
5:140:10619:17:17:79:511:519:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:price auctions, existing tools should be used.  The advantage of our approach is in analyzing
5:141:10712:17:16:79:511:502:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:settings which, in spite of being quite common forms of trade—such as bargaining—do not
5:142:10799:16:21:79:442:486:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:have well-established tools or well-understood equilibrium characterizations.
5:143:10876:21:17:91:511:465:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The tools we propose can be extended in a number of ways.  First, we demonstrate that
5:144:10961:17:17:79:511:448:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in certain games our identification and estimation approach can accommodate observed as
5:145:11048:17:16:79:511:431:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:well as unobserved game-level heterogeneity; that is, a component of player valuations that
5:146:11139:16:17:79:511:415:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:is  common  to  all  players.   Second,  we  show  that  independence  of  agents’  values  can  be
5:147:11238:17:21:79:436:398:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:relaxed when the equilibrium is assumed to be separating in agents’ types.
5:148:11312:21:16:91:511:377:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We apply our estimation approach to data from the wholesale used-car market, a large
5:149:11396:16:17:79:511:361:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:market fueling the supply side of US used-car industry.  The market involves individual cars
5:150:11488:17:17:79:511:344:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:sold through a game of a secret reserve price auction followed by alternating-offer bargaining
5:151:11582:17:17:79:511:327:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:between the seller and high bidder when the high bid falls short of the reserve price.  This
5:152:11674:17:17:79:511:310:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:game  has  multiple  equilibria  and  no  complete  theoretical  characterization.   In  the  data,
5:153:11773:17:17:79:511:293:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:we observe the final transaction price, an indicator for whether or not trade occurred (the
5:154:11864:17:17:79:511:276:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:allocation), and the secret reserve price of the seller.  We combine our imperfectly observable
5:155:11959:17:16:79:511:259:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:actions case with our unobserved heterogeneity correction procedure to estimate the menu
5:156:12047:16:17:79:511:243:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of expected payoffs sellers choose from.  We then estimate the mapping from reported secret
5:157:12138:17:21:79:454:226:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:reserve prices to sellers’ true values by evaluating the derivatives of this menu.
5:158:12220:21:16:91:511:205:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:With the estimated valuations we perform a number of counterfactual exercises.  First, we
5:159:12309:16:17:79:511:189:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:evaluate how close this real-world mechanism (the auction followed by post-auction bargain-
5:160:12400:17:17:79:511:172:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ing) lies to the first-best efficient mechanism and the second-best (information-constrained)
5:161:12493:17:17:79:511:155:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:efficient  mechanism  for  this  setting  ofN>1  buyers  and  1  seller.   We  then  evaluate  the
5:162:12591:17:41:79:511:138:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:mechanism that would be optimal for the seller in this setting (an auction with a public

5:164:12783:15:11:79:511:82:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:modeling bargaining,  as the actual extensive form in many real-world negotiations is unknown to the re-

6:166:12913:0:17:79:511:688:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:reserve  price)  and  the  mechanism  that  would  be  optimal  for  the  buyer  (an  auction  fol-
6:167:13012:17:17:79:511:671:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:lowed  by  a  take-it-or-leave-it  offer  by  the  high  bidder  to  the  seller).   We  find  that  the
6:168:13116:17:17:79:511:654:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:auction-plus-bargaining mechanism used in practice only has a small efficiency loss relative
6:169:13208:17:17:79:511:637:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:to  the  first-best  or  second-best,  and  it  outperforms  the  seller-optimal  and  buyer-optimal
6:170:13308:17:17:79:511:620:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:mechanisms,  both  in  terms  of  total  surplus  and  the  volume  of  trade.   We  also  examine
6:171:13406:17:16:79:511:603:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:distributional implications of mechanism choice:  who gets what share of the surplus.  We
6:172:13495:16:17:79:511:587:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:find that the mechanism favors sellers, in the sense that it gives them a larger share of the
6:173:13588:17:17:79:511:570:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:surplus, but we find that it favors sellers less-so than the second-best mechanism would.  We
6:174:13681:17:17:79:511:553:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:also examine the implications of the Myerson and Satterthwaite (1983) Theorem for this
6:175:13767:17:17:79:511:536:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:setting. We find that second-best efficiency is very close to first-best efficiency in our setting,
6:176:13866:17:20:79:511:519:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:largely because competition between buyers decreases losses from asymmetric information.
6:177:13954:20:17:91:511:499:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We  see  the  results  presented  in  this  paper  as  having  potential  to  be  used  to  identify

6:186:14706:17:16:79:511:310:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:approaches  for  specific  types  of  games,  such  as  Guerre,  Perrigne,  and  Vuong  (2000)  for
6:187:14805:16:17:79:511:294:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:first price auctions.  Similar approaches have since been applied to many other specific set-
6:188:14898:17:17:79:511:277:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:tings.  For example, the ad auctions literature (Varian, 2009; Athey and Nekipelov, 2010;
6:189:14987:17:17:79:511:260:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Nekipelov, Syrgkanis, and Tardos, 2015) discusses value identification in a manner that is
6:190:15077:17:17:79:511:243:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:close  to  ours.   Related  two-step  approaches  have  also  been  applied  to  treasury  auctions

6:195:15486:21:16:91:511:155:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In a related, contemporaneous study, Kline (2016) focuses on identification, but not es-
6:196:15574:16:17:79:511:139:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:timation,  in a class of games that overlaps with the class we study:  trading games with
6:197:15663:17:17:79:511:122:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:monotone equilibria and perfectly observable actions.  We see his study as complementary to
6:198:15754:17:17:79:511:105:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ours; whereas his results apply to settings with correlated values, we only discuss correlated
6:199:15848:17:17:79:511:88:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:values  briefly  in  Section  7.   Our  study  instead  focuses  primarily  on  the  case  of  indepen-
6:200:15951:17:0:79:511:71:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:dent values, deriving additional identification results regarding menu convexity, imperfectly
7:201:16112:0:17:79:511:688:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:observable actions, and unobserved game-level heterogeneity, and presenting estimation ap-
7:202:16202:17:17:79:511:671:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:proaches for each of these cases.  Our results for handling heterogeneity relate to arguments
7:203:16295:17:17:79:511:654:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in Krasnokutskaya (2011), which have previously been applied primarily to particular auc-
7:204:16384:17:17:79:511:637:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:tion settings and not incomplete information trading games more broadly.  Our extension to
7:205:16474:17:20:79:511:620:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:correlated private values settings relates to arguments from Li, Perrigne, and Vuong (2002).
7:206:16566:20:17:91:511:600:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Our  exposition  aims  to  emphasize  several  key  points.   First,  while  our  identification
7:207:16662:17:17:79:511:583:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:arguments in the case ofperfectly observableare related to ideas that have been applied to
7:208:16752:17:17:79:511:566:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:other specific settings in the past, we illustrate here that these identification results largely
7:209:16849:17:17:79:511:549:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:only require taking a stance on the structure of agents’ utility functions, not the specific
7:210:16941:17:16:79:511:532:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:rules of the game being played.  These approaches can be applied in any kind of trading
7:211:17028:16:17:79:511:516:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:procedure with observed actions, so long as agents’ utility functions are assumed to be affine
7:212:17122:17:17:79:511:499:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in expected trade probabilities and transfers.  We hope that our general exposition can help
7:213:17214:17:17:79:511:482:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:to conceptually unify the many independent identification results derived in specific settings
7:214:17308:17:17:79:511:465:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in the literature.  We also highlight that our approach in the observed actions case can apply
7:215:17402:17:17:79:511:448:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in games without unique equilibria and that are currently understudied empirically, such
7:216:17490:17:16:79:511:431:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:as  median-  or  average-price  auctions  (Cramton,  Ellermeyer,  and  Katzman  2015;  Chang,
7:217:17583:16:17:79:511:415:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Chen,  and  Salmon  2014;  Decarolis  2018)  or  double  auctions  (Chatterjee  and  Samuelson

7:221:17919:17:17:79:511:344:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:avoid  modeling  a  complex  game  and  instead  use  a  partially  observed  action  vector  or  a
7:222:18018:17:17:79:511:327:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:characteristic of an agent not observed by other agents to identify payoff menus and infer
7:223:18108:17:17:79:511:310:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:underlying  valuations.   This  can  particularly  useful  in  many  complex  games  that  do  not
7:224:18206:17:17:79:511:293:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:immediately fit the mold of existing empirical frameworks and tools, such as sequential bi-
7:225:18297:17:17:79:511:276:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:lateral bargaining (Keniston 2011; Ambrus, Chaney, and Salitskiy 2018), auctions followed
7:226:18386:17:16:79:511:259:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:by bargaining (Elyakime, Laffont, Loisel, and Vuong 1997; Larsen 2014; An and Tang 2016),
7:227:18475:16:17:79:511:243:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:auctions with collusion (Asker 2010; Kawai and Nakabayashi 2015),  or other multi-stage
7:228:18562:17:21:79:238:226:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:games of incomplete information.
7:229:18594:21:16:91:511:205:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Furthermore, as we show in Section 3, the general trading game model imposes a simple
7:230:18679:16:17:79:511:189:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:empirical restriction, independently of the extensive-form game being played:  equilibrium
7:231:18769:17:17:79:511:172:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:menus{(Pi(ai),Ti(ai))}must  be  convex.   This  unifies  a  number  of  known  restrictions

10:329:24196:20:17:91:510:634:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Equation (3) is a necessary and sufficient condition for strategiessi(vi)to constitute a

10:337:24912:17:17:79:511:499:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that affords her the highest utility.  The equilibrium menu is also sufficient for characterizing
10:338:25009:17:17:79:511:482:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:agents’ welfare gains from participating in trade; the expected welfare gain of typeviis the

10:340:25124:20:17:91:511:445:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In what follows, we will assume that the econometrician observes data from many inde-

10:342:25296:17:17:79:511:411:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:further assume that all realizations of the game represent play from the same Bayes-Nash
10:343:25384:17:17:79:511:394:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Equilibrium.  While this assumption is common in the structural empirical literature, it is
10:344:25475:17:16:79:511:377:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:certainly strong.  We emphasize here, however, that this assumption does not imply that
10:345:25562:16:17:79:511:361:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the underlying game need only have a single equilibrium, only that the data represents play
10:346:25653:17:17:79:511:344:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:from a single equilibrium.  This therefore allows the data to speak as to the equilibrium

10:348:25839:17:17:79:511:310:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:impose an equilibrium refinement.  This is particularly useful in the settings we seek to ana-
10:349:25933:17:17:79:511:293:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:lyze, as many of these are cases with multiple equilibria that are qualitatively very different
10:350:26028:17:17:79:510:276:11:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:and where theoretical equilibrium refinements do not always yield a unique equilibrium.3
10:351:26116:17:16:79:511:259:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Moreover, all of our results in this paper still hold if the assumption of a single equilibrium

10:353:26315:17:17:79:511:226:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:one realization of the game to another, then which equilibrium is selected depends only on
10:354:26405:17:17:79:511:209:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:features in the data that are observable to the econometrician and can thus be controlled
10:355:26494:17:20:79:281:192:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:for.  We discuss this further in Section 9.4.
10:356:26539:20:17:91:511:172:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:By allowing all value distributionsFiand action setsAito be distinct, we allow agents
10:357:26624:17:17:79:511:155:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:to be completely asymmetric.  This is important for games in which players play different
10:358:26713:17:17:79:511:138:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:roles,  such as in bilateral bargaining settings,  as in Example 2.  In some cases below,  we

10:360:26906:24:15:79:511:97:8:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f11:3For  example,  in  the  case  of  bilateral  bargaining,  proposed  equilibrium  refinements  often  fail  to  exist  or
10:361:27027:15:11:79:511:82:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:result in equilibria that predict immediate agreement.  See discussion in Ausubel, Cramton, and Deneckere

11:364:27323:17:17:79:511:671:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:instance of the trading game may involve classes of agents who are indistinguishable.  For
11:365:27413:17:17:79:511:654:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:example,  different bidders in an auction may be indistinguishable to the econometrician,
11:366:27502:17:17:79:511:637:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:or only distinguishable based on certain observables; an example is the case of loggers vs.
11:367:27593:17:17:79:511:620:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:mills  bidding  in  timber  auctions  (Athey,  Coey,  and  Levin  2013).   In  such  settings,  the
11:368:27692:17:16:79:511:603:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:econometrician may wish to model all players from a certain class as drawing valuations
11:369:27779:16:17:79:511:587:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:from a single distribution.  All of our identification and estimation results can be thought
11:370:27871:17:64:79:250:570:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of as applying to such cases as well.
11:371:27908:64:27:164:426:506:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f6:3.Identification with Fully Observed Actions
11:372:27952:27:17:91:511:479:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In this section, we derive identification results for the model described above, assuming
11:373:28041:17:17:79:511:462:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that the econometrician fully observes agents’ actions from many instances of equilibrium
11:374:28130:17:17:79:511:445:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:play of the trading gameG. We first analyze the case where the equilibrium is not necessarily
11:375:28223:17:16:79:511:428:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:increasing or in pure strategies.  We then demonstrate stronger results that can be obtained
11:376:28315:16:17:79:511:412:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:when such an increasing, pure-strategy equilibrium does exist.  In each instance of the game,
11:377:28408:17:17:79:510:395:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:valuesVi, for each agenti∈{1, ...,m}, are independently drawn fromFi(and these actions
11:378:28494:17:17:79:511:378:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:are independent across instances of the game).  Agents then take actions corresponding to
11:379:28583:17:17:79:511:361:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:a set of equilibrium strategies(s1(·), . . . ,sm(·)).  We assume in this section that in each
11:380:28676:17:17:79:510:344:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:instance of the game, the econometrician observesxi(the allocation for agenti),ti(the

11:384:28986:17:17:79:511:273:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:first-price or second price auctions, where the structure of equilibria is well-known in the
11:385:29078:17:16:79:511:256:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:theoretical and empirical literature, but also any arbitrary sealed-bid trading game where
11:386:29168:16:17:79:511:240:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:such properties may be less well-known or strategies less well-behaved, such as the median-

11:388:29347:17:17:79:511:206:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:tially yield equilibria that are non-increasing (Cramton, Ellermeyer, and Katzman 2015); or
11:389:29438:17:17:79:511:189:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:sealed-bid bilateral bargaining games, such as thekdouble auction, which are known to have
11:390:29528:17:17:79:511:172:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:multiple,  qualitatively different equilibria (Chatterjee and Samuelson 1983; Satterthwaite

12:398:30172:17:17:79:511:671:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:outcome functions(Pi(ai),Ti(ai))are sufficient to summarize agents’ choices in equilib-
12:399:30259:17:17:79:511:654:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:rium,  without  requiring  knowledge  of  the  full  functionsxi(a1. . .am)andti(a1. . .am).
12:400:30351:17:17:79:510:637:11:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f15:These expected outcome functions are simply conditional expectations of outcomesxi,ti

12:402:30536:17:16:79:511:603:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:argument:  for any given action valueai, the econometrician can use the incentive compat-
12:403:30625:16:17:79:510:587:11:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f15:ibility conditions in (3) to bound the values of any typevi∈vi(ai), that is, any typevi

13:557:33845:17:17:79:510:327:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:1 of Proposition 1 states that the menu is convex.  Part 3 states thatvi(ai)is higher for
13:558:33934:17:16:79:510:310:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:values ofaiwith higher probabilitiesPi(ai).  This is related to the classic fact in mechanism
13:559:34027:16:17:79:511:294:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:design that implementable allocation rules must be monotone, assigning higher bundles to
13:560:34115:17:17:79:511:277:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:higher  types.   Intuitively,  under  our  “convex  menu”  interpretation  of  equilibria,  convex
13:561:34213:17:17:79:511:260:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:menus have monotonically increasing slopes, where the slope represents the average cost of
13:562:34303:17:17:79:511:243:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:additional probability.  Agents who choose bundles with higherPi(ai)pay higher average
13:563:34389:17:20:79:368:226:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:costs per unit probability, and thus must have higher values.
13:564:34450:20:17:91:510:206:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Together, parts 2 and 3 also state that eachvi(ai)is an interval, and distinct intervals

14:582:35708:17:17:79:511:593:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:bounds in Theorem 1 depends on the degree to which different types play different actions

14:618:37207:17:17:79:511:88:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:is analytically equivalent to our approach; however, theirs relies explicitly on knowing that

15:640:38111:44:27:146:444:416:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f6:4.Identification with Imperfectly Observed Actions
15:641:38161:27:17:91:511:389:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In  many  contexts,  it  is  impossible  for  the  econometrician  to  observe  all  elements  of  a
15:642:38261:17:17:79:511:372:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:realization of the actionai.  For example,  in a multiple-offer bargaining game,  observing
15:643:38352:17:16:79:511:355:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f10:aiwould entail observing a vector of all ofi’s actionscontingent on all possible sequences
15:644:38442:16:17:79:511:339:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of  offers  from  other  agents,  or  in  an  ascending  auction,  all  ofi’s  bid  strategies  over  all
15:645:38547:17:17:79:511:322:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:sequences of opponent bids, within a single instance of the game.  Thus, observingaiwould
15:646:38636:17:17:79:511:305:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:not simply mean observing what actionsitook, but what actionsiwould have takenin every
15:647:38722:17:17:79:511:288:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:history of the game, including those not reached; this would be equivalent to observing a
15:648:38811:17:20:79:505:271:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:set of instructions playeriwould have given to a third-party agent to play on her behalf.
15:649:38900:20:17:91:511:251:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:However,  in  many  of  these  cases  where  the  action  is  a  multidimensional  vector,  the
15:650:38995:17:17:79:511:234:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:econometrician  will  be  able  to  observe  some  portion  of  an  agent’s  action  vector  or  will
15:651:39096:17:17:79:511:217:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:be  able  to  observe  some  other  feature  in  the  dataset  that  is  correlated  with  an  agent’s
15:652:39198:17:17:79:511:200:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:unobserved action vector.  We refer to such an object—either a partially observed action
15:653:39286:17:16:79:511:183:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:or a separate feature in the dataset correlated with an agent’s action—as anaction shifter,

16:665:40137:17:17:79:511:579:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:stamp auction case of Asker (2010), members of a bidding ring participate in a sealed-bid
16:666:40226:17:16:79:511:562:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:knockout auction.  The winning bid from the knockout auction then becomes the cartel’s
16:667:40312:16:17:79:511:546:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:bid in the target (English) auction.  Asker (2010) provides a full model of this game.  The
16:668:40403:17:17:79:511:529:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:knockout bid of an agent, which comes from a first, sealed-bid stage of the game, would be
16:669:40493:17:24:79:211:512:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:aZisatisfying Definition 1.

16:678:41160:17:24:79:455:342:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:arguably correlated with one agent’s action but not with other agents’ actions.

16:680:41324:17:17:79:511:301:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Salitskiy  (2018),  Spanish  ransom  parties  haggle  with  North  African  pirates  to  buy  back
16:681:41422:17:16:79:511:284:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Spanish captives.  In the data, the authors observe the amount of earmarked money raised
16:682:41510:16:17:79:511:268:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:by a given captive’s family back home.  This amount is known to the econometrician and to

16:684:41690:17:17:79:511:234:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:money is arguably correlated with the buyer’s valuation and thus with his action and can
16:685:41778:17:24:79:318:217:11:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:serve as a shifterZifor the rescue party’s action.4
16:686:41829:24:17:79:511:193:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f5:Example 8.Assets in Auctions:  In many auction datasets, such as auto auctions or real
16:687:41915:17:17:79:511:176:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:estate auctions, the econometrician may observe information about an agent’s assets that
16:688:42003:17:17:79:511:159:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:is only known to that agent and not to opponents, and that may be correlated with that
16:689:42089:17:16:79:511:142:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:agent’s willingness to pay.  For example, in auto auctions, the data may contain information
16:690:42181:16:18:79:511:126:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:on previous cars purchased by that agent or credit constraints of that agent.  In real estate

16:693:42486:11:11:79:511:82:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:such structure could potentially be tested, as it would allow the researcher to identify certain objects without
16:694:42598:11:0:79:241:71:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:imposing a particular bargaining model.
17:695:42706:0:17:79:511:688:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:auctions, the data may contain information on the size of the loan the potential buyer has
17:696:42796:17:17:79:511:671:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:been approved for, known to the buyer but not the seller.  In each case, the level of these
17:697:42887:17:29:79:306:654:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:assets may serve as aZisatisfying Definition 1.

17:709:43631:28:17:91:511:378:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The equality on the second line follows by the law of iterated expectations and the equality

17:712:43900:17:17:79:511:327:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:outcomes defining the menu.  The above argument shows that conditional expectations of

17:715:44164:17:17:79:511:277:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of{(Pi(ai),Ti(ai))}.   In  other  words,  for  anyzithat  satisfies  Definition  1,  the  graph

17:717:44351:17:17:79:511:243:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:obtain a lower bound on the utility of any given typeviin equilibrium, or, equivalently, an

17:723:44789:17:17:79:511:122:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:identified.  In Figure 2, we show the imperfectly observed menu{( ̆Pi(zi), ̆Ti(zi))}generated
17:724:44882:17:17:79:510:105:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f8:from  a  true  menu{(Pi(ai),Ti(ai))},  where  we  generate  action  shifters  such  thatVi=

17:726:45061:17:0:79:511:71:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:convex; thus, if we were to only observe{( ̆Pi(zi), ̆Ti(zi))}, we would be unable to distinguish

18:758:46591:32:29:91:511:258:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Corollary 2 also immediately extends to the imperfectly observed actions case, as follows:
18:759:46681:29:17:79:511:229:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f10:Corollary  5.If  each  typeviis  one-to-one  withzi,zi∈R,  the  functions ̆Pi,zi(·)are

18:764:46866:30:17:91:511:147:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:As with Corollary 2 in the fully observed action case, we see Corollary 5 as particularly

19:771:47464:17:17:79:510:654:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:possible to approximate the functionE[V|Z=z](which we will write in short asE[V|z]),
19:772:47548:17:17:79:511:637:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the conditional expectation of an agent’s valuation given the observedZ.  This object may
19:773:47637:17:17:79:511:620:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:be of direct interest as a best guess of an agent’s valuation given the data, and it will also
19:774:47731:17:16:79:511:603:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:be useful in allowing us to construct an approximate lower bound for gains from trade for

19:776:47842:21:17:91:511:566:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f7:Throughout this and the next subsection, we suppress subscriptsi, writing for examplez

19:783:48440:17:17:79:511:448:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:than we need;  all of these assumptions can be relaxed without significantly affecting the
19:784:48530:17:20:79:113:431:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:results.
19:785:48538:20:17:91:510:411:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We impose one final restriction that cannot easily be relaxed:  we assume thatG(v|z)is

24:1227:59377:17:17:79:510:654:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f8:(1983), we propose a spline-based procedure to nonparametrically estimate theP(·),T(·)
24:1228:59463:17:17:79:511:637:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:functions while imposing convexity of the{(P(a),T(a))}menu.  In Appendix B, we describe
24:1229:59550:17:17:79:511:620:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the construction of the quadratic and cubic spline bases in detail.  Our estimation approach
24:1230:59642:17:16:79:511:603:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:proceeds in two stages:  first,P(a)is nonparametrically estimated as a smooth function of
24:1231:59731:16:17:79:510:587:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f5:a, possibly constrained to be monotonic, using quadratic splines.  Then,T(·)is estimated
24:1232:59819:17:17:79:510:570:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:as the composite functionˆT(P(a)), whereˆT(·)is constrained to be a convex cubic spline.
24:1233:59907:17:17:79:511:553:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Constraining  the  quadratic  (cubic)  spline  coefficients  to  be  nonnegative  ensures  that  the
24:1234:60007:17:17:79:511:536:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:target function is nondecreasing (convex).  Note that, by construction, the quadratic splines
24:1235:60100:17:14:79:511:519:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:have two continuous derivatives, and the cubic splines three continuous derivatives.  Since
24:1236:60191:14:19:79:511:505:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ˆT(p)is a cubic spline, the estimated mappings−1(a)=dTdPis guaranteed to be continuous

24:1242:60590:16:17:79:510:379:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:splines.  We usem=5 bidders for each auction instance, using uniform, exponential and
24:1243:60675:17:17:79:511:362:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:lognormal value distributions.  We generate datasets of size 4,000, 16,000, and 40,000 for
24:1244:60765:17:17:79:511:345:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:estimation; we solve for the unique equilibrium as in GPV, and then simulate and estimate

24:1246:60919:20:28:91:262:308:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The GPV estimator can be written:

24:1253:61162:17:17:79:511:215:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of all bids.8We estimateˆ ̄g(·)using a kernel density estimator, using Gaussian kernels with
24:1254:61254:17:17:79:511:198:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:bandwidth  chosen  using  the  Silverman  (1986)  rule  of  thumb.   We  estimateˆ ̄G(·)using  a
24:1255:61350:17:18:79:511:181:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:linearly interpolated empirical CDF. To implement our local polynomial regression method,
24:1256:61439:18:14:79:511:163:8:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f11:7Menu convexity corresponds exactly to monotonicity of Myerson (1981) marginal revenue, hence “ironing”
24:1257:61542:14:11:79:511:149:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:in this context is exactly equivalent to the Myersonian procedure of enforcing marginal revenue monotonicity
24:1258:61650:11:9:79:160:138:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:for a demand curve.
24:1259:61669:9:14:79:511:129:8:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f11:8While we draw i.i.d.  bids for simulation, we estimate values allowing for bidders to be potentially drawn
24:1260:61776:14:11:79:511:115:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:from different distributions.  The symmetric GPV estimator uses multiple data points from each auction,
24:1261:61879:11:11:79:511:104:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:and could technically be implemented with only observing one auction (with many bidders) whereas our
24:1262:61979:11:11:79:511:93:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:approach requires observing multiple instances of the game.  We use the asymmetric version here to hold

24:1264:62186:11:0:79:135:71:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:performances.
25:1265:62268:0:17:79:511:688:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:we run local quadratic regressions to estimate derivatives as described in Section 5.2, using
25:1266:62361:17:17:79:511:671:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Gaussian  kernels  with  bandwidths  equal  to  half9the  Fan-Gijbels  rule  of  thumb  in  (13).
25:1267:62458:17:17:79:511:654:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:To implement our convex spline method, we first estimatePi(·)separately for each agent

25:1272:62910:17:17:79:511:570:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:explicitly apply any procedure for spline knot selection, but we found that results were not
25:1273:63002:17:21:79:334:553:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:very sensitive to using knot counts between 5 and 20.
25:1274:63055:21:16:91:511:532:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We show pointwise 95% coverage bands from 200 estimation sample for both estimators,
25:1275:63139:16:17:79:511:516:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:for the case of the exponential distribution withN=4, 000 in Figure 3.  In Table 1,  for
25:1276:63227:17:17:79:511:499:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:all  specifications  we  used,  we  show  average  mean  squared  errors  normalized  by  the  true
25:1277:63326:17:20:79:442:482:11:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:variance in values, for bid values between the 20th and 80th bid quantiles.10
25:1278:63403:20:17:91:511:462:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We find that GPV significantly outperforms both of our estimators:  the mean squared
25:1279:63487:17:17:79:511:445:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:error  of  GPV  is  less  than  1  percent  in  all  of  the  simulation  specifications,  and  in  some
25:1280:63591:17:17:79:511:428:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:cases it is even below 0.1%.  In absolute terms, however, both the local quadratic and spline
25:1281:63684:17:17:79:511:411:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:estimators perform fairly well, achieving below 10% MSE in all specifications, and achieving
25:1282:63776:17:20:79:361:394:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:around 1% MSE in specifications with 40,000 observations.
25:1283:63833:20:17:91:511:374:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Our proposed spline estimator may have a number of qualitative benefits over the local
25:1284:63919:17:17:79:511:357:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:quadratic regression estimator. First, it is guaranteed to produce convex menus for any given
25:1285:64012:17:17:79:511:340:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:estimation instance,  which may be desirable in settings where value and menu estimates
25:1286:64099:17:17:79:511:323:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:are  used  for  economic  counterfactuals.   Second,  as  we  demonstrate  in  Section  7.2,  the
25:1287:64196:17:16:79:511:306:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:spline estimator allows the researcher to incorporate an unobserved heterogeneity correction
25:1288:64288:16:17:79:511:290:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:procedure.  If unobserved heterogeneity is not a serious issue,  we suggest using the local
25:1289:64379:17:17:79:511:273:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:quadratic regression estimator, as its finite-sample performance appears to exceed that of the
25:1290:64473:17:17:79:511:256:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:spline estimator.  In cases where unobserved heterogeneity or other multi-step procedures
25:1291:64562:17:17:79:511:239:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that benefit from parametric estimation are needed, or in cases where data is sparse and
25:1292:64650:17:17:79:511:222:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:enforcing menu convexity is important for statistical reasons, our spline procedure may be
25:1293:64740:17:16:79:511:205:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:preferable despite its worse finite-sample performance.  We use the splines approach in our
25:1294:64831:16:35:79:273:189:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:empirical application in Section 8 below.
25:1295:64872:35:14:79:511:154:8:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f11:9This  is  an  ad-hoc  adjustment,  because  we  found  that  the  estimator  performed  somewhat  better  with
25:1296:64983:14:11:79:511:140:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:smaller bandwidths, possibly because this reduces bias in the estimator when the target function is relatively
25:1297:65093:11:9:79:126:129:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:nonsmooth.
25:1298:65103:9:14:79:511:120:8:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f11:10While this is a large truncation, as Figure 3 shows, both GPV and our local quadratic regression estimator
25:1299:65211:14:12:79:511:106:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:can function very poorly towards the lower end of the support of the bid distribution.  For our estimator,
25:1300:65317:12:12:79:510:94:9:g_d0_f11:6:g_d0_f17:this is essentially because the probability of winning and transfer both become very small; the ratioT′(b)P′(b)
25:1301:65428:12:11:79:511:82:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:thus becomes numerically unstable.  Thus MSE comparisons are more meaningful for bids well inside the
25:1302:65529:11:0:79:264:71:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:interior of the support of the bid distribution.
26:1303:65595:0:17:91:511:688:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We interpret these first-price auction simulation results as suggesting that if the researcher
26:1304:65689:17:17:79:511:671:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:is well aware that the game generating the data is indeed a first-price auction, the researcher
26:1305:65784:17:17:79:511:654:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:should use the standard GPV approach for identification and estimation.  If, however, the
26:1306:65873:17:17:79:511:637:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:researcher has data by some unknown bidding procedure or by some unknown equilibrium
26:1307:65957:17:17:79:511:620:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:selection  rule,  or  from  a  bidding  procedure  for  which  no  specific,  standard  tool  has  yet
26:1308:66059:17:16:79:511:603:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:been derived, and wishes to identify and estimate valuations in a manner that is robust to
26:1309:66149:16:58:79:480:587:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:misspecification of these features of the game, our menu approach can perform well.

26:1311:66316:16:17:79:511:513:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:which, unlike first-price auctions, there is no existing off-the-shelf method for estimation:
26:1312:66409:17:17:79:511:496:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:a  bargaining  game  with  two-sided  incomplete  information.   The  theoretical  literature  on
26:1313:66506:17:17:79:511:479:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:incomplete information bargaining demonstrates that such games in general have multiple
26:1314:66593:17:17:79:511:462:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:equilibria that are difficult to characterize.  Here, we generate data from a particular equilib-
26:1315:66690:17:17:79:511:445:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:rium from such a game.  In order to do so, we adopt the bilateral bargaining game described
26:1316:66781:17:16:79:511:428:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f7:in Satterthwaite and Williams (1989).  Players’ roles are denotedi∈{B,S}.  The buyerB
26:1317:66866:16:17:79:511:412:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and sellerShave private valuations and make offers.  If the buyer’s offer (aB) exceeds that
26:1318:66957:17:17:79:511:395:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of the seller (aS), trade occurs at pricet=kaS+(1−k)aB, wherek∈[0, 1].  The parameter
26:1319:67042:17:17:79:511:378:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f5:kcan be considered a bargaining power weight.  A game withk=1 corresponds to the
26:1320:67122:17:17:79:510:361:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:seller-optimal mechanism (a take-it-or-leave-it offer by the seller) and a game withk=0
26:1321:67209:17:17:79:511:344:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:corresponds to the buyer-optimal mechanism (a take-it-or-leave-it offer by the buyer).  This
26:1322:67301:17:17:79:510:327:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:game is referred to in the literature as akdouble auction (see also Chatterjee and Samuel-
26:1323:67391:17:16:79:511:310:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:son 1983).  Satterthwaite and Williams (1989) demonstrate that a continuum of equilibria
26:1324:67479:16:17:79:511:294:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:exist in this game, and they provide methods to solve for a class of equilibria.  We simulate
26:1325:67572:17:21:79:403:277:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:data following their solution approach, as described in Appendix C.
26:1326:67639:21:16:91:511:256:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f7:An  observation  in  the  data  we  generate  consists  of  a  final  transfert,  an  allocationx
26:1327:67736:16:17:79:511:240:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(i.e.  an indicator for whether or not the good sold),  and a seller’s offeraS.  In applying
26:1328:67828:17:17:79:511:223:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:our estimation approach, we then deliberately tie our hands by treating the buyer’s offer
26:1329:67917:17:17:79:511:206:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and the bargaining power parameter as unknown and treating the seller’s action as though
26:1330:68005:17:17:79:511:189:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:arising from an unknown extensive form bargaining game generating the data.  Specifically,
26:1331:68095:17:17:79:511:172:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:we treat the seller’s offer as a partially observed action vector that is one-to-one with the
26:1332:68188:17:16:79:511:155:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:seller’s value as described in Section 4.  This simulated data mimmicks a type of dataset
26:1333:68277:16:17:79:511:139:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that a researcher may commonly find:  prices arising from an unknown negotiation process
26:1334:68365:17:17:79:511:122:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(i.e.  the precise extensive form of the game is unknown to the researcher).  For example,
26:1335:68455:17:17:79:511:105:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:a researcher might observe housing data with transacted prices,  a measure of how many
26:1336:68541:17:17:79:511:88:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:buyers  placed  offers  on  the  house  and  failed  to  win  it,  and  the  seller’s  initial  list  price
26:1337:68648:17:0:79:329:71:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(analogous to the seller offer generated in our data).
27:1338:68771:0:17:91:511:688:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We apply our estimators to cases were valuations are distributed according to a uniform or
27:1339:68861:17:17:79:511:671:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:truncated Normal distribution, and for sample sizes of 4,000, 16,000, or 40,000 observations.
27:1340:68954:17:17:79:511:654:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The distributional parameters for the true distributions are discussed in Appendix C. Figure

27:1342:69149:17:17:79:511:620:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:sellers on the vertical axis for the uniformly distributed case with 4,000 observations.  The
27:1343:69242:17:16:79:511:603:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:estimation  procedure  performs  well  in  recovering  valuations  close  to  the  truth.   Table  2
27:1344:69342:16:17:79:511:587:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:displays  the  mean  squared  error  for  the  different  specifications,  normalized  by  the  true
27:1345:69442:17:17:79:511:570:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:variance as in Table 1.  The mean squared error of the local quadratic regression estimator
27:1346:69533:17:17:79:511:553:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:is at most 10% in small samples and in larger samples it is below 5%.  The convex spline
27:1347:69621:17:20:79:511:536:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:estimator is less accurate in small samples, but also has MSE below 10% in larger samples.
27:1348:69711:20:17:91:511:516:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We also remark here that this estimation exercise did not exploit any information about
27:1349:69798:17:17:79:511:499:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the  value  ofk(the  bargaining  power),  any  offer  made  by  the  buyer,  or  the  particular
27:1350:69894:17:17:79:511:482:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:equilibrium being played.  Recall that a continuum of equilibria exist to this game at any
27:1351:69984:17:17:79:511:465:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:value ofk.  The generated data in our simulation exercise could have come from any fixed

27:1354:70254:16:17:79:511:415:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:still have returned reasonable estimates of valuations based solely on the observed first seller

27:1357:70442:27:16:91:511:331:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We now provide extensions to our identification arguments provided above to settings of
27:1358:70529:16:34:79:503:315:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:game-level heterogeneity (observed and unobserved heterogeneity) and correlated values.

27:1360:70699:17:17:79:511:264:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that is observable observable to the econometrician, such heterogeneity can easily be con-
27:1361:70789:17:17:79:511:247:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:trolled for.  In particular, the estimation procedures described in Section 5 can be extended
27:1362:70882:17:17:79:511:230:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:to include a vectorYof observable characteristics (that may vary in each realization of the
27:1363:70973:17:17:79:511:213:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:game) as a control in the estimation of thePi(·)andTi(·)functions determining the menu.
27:1364:71060:17:16:79:511:196:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:If such heterogeneity enters players’ valuations and actions in an additively or multiplica-

27:1366:71248:17:17:79:510:163:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:actions on observations of the vectorYand treat the residuals from this regression as coming
27:1367:71340:17:17:79:511:146:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:from a “homogenized” game, as in the auction setting of Haile, Hong, and Shum (2003).
27:1368:71425:17:17:79:511:129:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We  discuss  this  separability  condition  in  more  detail  below  when  we  discuss  unobserved

27:1370:71537:26:15:79:511:86:8:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f11:11Li and Liu (2015) propose an estimation approach for settings where the researcher instead knows that
27:1371:71640:15:0:79:257:71:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:the data is generated by akdouble auction.

28:1373:71789:17:17:79:511:671:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:also allows for the data to represent play from different equilibria of the underlying game:
28:1374:71881:17:17:79:511:654:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:as long as the equilibrium selection can be controlled for using observables, the presence of
28:1375:71974:17:17:79:511:637:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:multiple equilibria poses no threat to identification or estimation.  We discuss this further
28:1376:72067:17:28:79:178:620:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in Section 9.4 below.

28:1378:72171:17:17:79:511:575:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:game-level  heterogeneity  that  is  observed  by  the  players  but  not  by  the  econometrician,
28:1379:72270:17:16:79:511:558:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:similar to the unobserved auction-level heterogeneity in Krasnokutskaya (2011).  We study
28:1380:72359:16:17:79:511:542:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:a class of games that we callseparable heterogeneity games, which are defined as follows.  In

28:1384:72704:17:14:79:151:474:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:values are then
28:1385:72719:14:23:264:327:460:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5: ̃Vi=Vi+W.
28:1386:72729:23:17:79:510:437:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In the third stage, agents take actions ̃ai∈[ai, ̄ai], which are observed by the econometri-
28:1387:72821:17:26:79:365:420:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:cian.  We require the game to satisfy the following property:
28:1388:72882:26:17:79:510:394:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f5:Definition 2.We say that gameGsatisfies theseparable  heterogeneity  game  propertyif

28:1392:73156:29:17:91:511:299:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The  separable  heterogeneity  game  property  can  also  be  defined  multiplicatively.   We
28:1393:73249:17:17:79:511:282:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:focus on the additive case here for brevity.  This property implies that, if all agents increase

28:1395:73440:16:17:79:511:249:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the prices paid by agents change by the same amount by which bids change.  Intuitively,
28:1396:73527:17:17:79:511:232:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:this property is appropriate for games which are position-invariant, in the sense that the
28:1397:73617:17:17:79:511:215:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:structure  of  the  game  is  unchanged  when  all  bids  are  changed  by  a  given  amount.   The
28:1398:73716:17:17:79:511:198:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:separable heterogeneity game property may not be appropriate, for example, in bargaining
28:1399:73804:17:17:79:511:181:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:settings  with  fixed  costs,  in  which  case  the  structure  of  the  game  may  be  qualitatively
28:1400:73905:17:20:79:429:164:11:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:different depending on the size of the payoff agents are bargaining over.12
28:1401:73980:20:17:91:511:144:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Since the common componentWis observed by all agents prior to agents’ action choices,
28:1402:74065:17:19:79:511:127:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:agents can condition their strategies on the common componentW; thus, we can think of
28:1403:74150:19:15:79:511:108:8:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f11:12In such settings,  one possible approach is to divide instances of the game into coarse partitions by ob-
28:1404:74257:15:11:79:511:93:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:servable characteristics that may affect payoff size.  The separable heterogeneity game property may be a
28:1405:74362:11:11:79:511:82:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:reasonable assumption within each partition, and the approach described in this section could be applied
28:1406:74466:11:0:79:149:71:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:within partitions.

29:1412:74990:17:16:79:511:603:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in Section 3, we define the expected probability and transfer thatiachieves when playing

34:1783:87042:17:16:79:511:390:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:efficient such a mechanism is in practice relative to efficient bargaining, and how the gains
34:1784:87135:16:17:79:511:374:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:from trade created by the mechanism are divided among the participants.15Our approach
34:1785:87220:17:17:79:511:357:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:allows us to estimate players’ valuations and expected gains from trade in this game without
34:1786:87312:17:17:79:511:340:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:imposing a particular extensive form or equilibrium selection.  We then use these objects
34:1787:87401:17:17:79:511:323:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:to measure how efficient the market is and how the total welfare is split among buyers and
34:1788:87491:17:20:79:111:306:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:sellers.
34:1789:87499:20:17:91:511:286:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We also use our estimates to address an additional question of interest for market design.
34:1790:87589:17:17:79:511:269:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The seminal work of Myerson and Satterthwaite (1983) demonstrated that, when there is
34:1791:87674:17:17:79:511:252:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:uncertainty about whether gains from trade exist and when a mechanism must be budget-
34:1792:87759:17:17:79:511:235:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:balanced,  any mechanism between one buyer and one seller will fall short of the ex-post
34:1793:87847:17:16:79:510:218:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:efficient outcome.16In used car markets, there is not merely one buyer, but multiple buyers.
34:1794:87939:16:17:79:511:202:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The natural question then follows:  withN >1 buyers, does the Myerson and Satterthwaite
34:1795:88026:17:17:79:511:185:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(1983) result still hold, or is ex-post efficiency achievable?  Below, we describe the setting
34:1796:88120:17:37:79:511:168:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and data and explain how we apply our menu approach to this setting.  We then discuss
34:1797:88205:37:14:79:511:131:8:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f11:14Auctions followed by post-auction bargaining between the buyer and seller have been reported in a number
34:1798:88311:14:11:79:511:117:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:of other settings as well, such as procurement.  In an important precurser to GPV, Elyakime, Laffont, Loisel,
34:1799:88420:11:8:79:351:106:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:and Vuong (1997) analyze this mechanism’s use in timber auctions.

34:1801:88591:12:15:79:511:86:8:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f11:16The ex-post efficient outcome is for trade to occur whenever the buyer values the good more than the
34:1802:88693:15:0:79:102:71:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:seller.

35:1806:88966:20:17:91:511:634:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The application we present in this section is related to a previous study focusing on this
35:1807:89056:17:17:79:511:617:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:market, Larsen (2014).  That previous paper also reports welfare measures under counter-
35:1808:89144:17:17:79:511:600:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:factual mechanisms, but focuses solely on the post-auction bargaining element of the game,
35:1809:89234:17:17:79:511:583:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:whereas here we study instead the fullN-buyer, 1-seller mechanism. That paper also did not
35:1810:89324:17:17:79:511:566:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:apply the menu approach we present herein for identification or for estimation, but instead

35:1812:89511:17:16:79:511:532:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:9.3 below highlights the distinction between these types of approaches for other settings.
35:1813:89601:16:17:79:511:516:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Our focus in this section is on applying the menu approach to estimating the distribution

35:1815:89785:17:17:79:511:482:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:as described below.  Other preliminary steps for estimation are rather straightforward (e.g.
35:1816:89877:17:17:79:511:465:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:controlling  for  observable  heterogeneity),  and  we  follow  the  same  approach  as  in  Larsen
35:1817:89976:17:17:79:511:448:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(2014)  for  those  preliminary  steps.   We  describe  the  full  estimation  procedure,  including

35:1820:90188:17:17:79:511:378:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:above $80 billion annually in the United States—operates through a network of several hun-
35:1821:90278:17:17:79:511:361:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:dred auction house locations scattered throughout the country (and operations are similar
35:1822:90367:17:17:79:511:344:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:internationally).  These auction houses have been a part of the US used car market for over
35:1823:90458:17:17:79:511:327:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:seventy years.  Over 15 million cars pass through auto auction houses annually.  At each
35:1824:90546:17:16:79:511:310:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:auction house location, used-car dealers come to buy cars from other car dealers or from
35:1825:90634:16:17:79:511:294:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:companies who possess large fleets—such as rental car companies, banks with repossessed
35:1826:90721:17:17:79:511:277:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:vehicles, or manufacturers with lease-buyback vehicles.  Sales at a given auction house typi-
35:1827:90814:17:17:79:511:260:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:cally take place once a week, and the seller of a given car brings the car to the auction house
35:1828:90909:17:17:79:511:243:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:several days before the sale and reports a secret reserve price to the auction house.  On the
35:1829:91002:17:17:79:511:226:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:day  of  the  sale,  buyers  (used-car  dealers)  come  to  the  auction  house,  with  many  buyers
35:1830:91102:17:16:79:511:209:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:traveling long distances to attend.  Cars are auctioned off roughly in the order they arrive,
35:1831:91195:16:17:79:511:193:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:with multiple auctions running simultaneously, as multiple sales lanes run throughout the
35:1832:91284:17:21:79:248:176:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:building where the sale takes place.
35:1833:91320:21:16:91:511:155:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The  mechanism  proceeds  as  follows:  buyers  participate  in  an  ascending  auction,  indi-
35:1834:91415:16:17:79:511:139:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:cating their willingness to pay the current price, with the bidding controlled by a human
35:1835:91504:17:17:79:511:122:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:auctioneer who raises the price until only one bidder remains.  The auction itself takes about
35:1836:91598:17:17:79:511:105:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:90 seconds (Lacetera, Larsen, Pope, and Sydnor 2016).  If the final auction price exceeds the
35:1837:91691:17:17:79:511:88:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:secret reserve price (observed to the auctioneer, but not the buyers), then the high bidder is
35:1838:91785:17:0:79:511:71:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:awarded the car.  If not, the high bidder and seller enter into an alternating-offer bargaining
36:1839:91898:0:17:79:511:688:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:game, mediated by an auction-house employee over the phone.  The high bidder is allowed
36:1840:91985:17:21:79:391:671:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the chance to opt out of bargaining before the seller is contacted.
36:1841:92052:21:16:91:511:650:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Our data consists of 133,249 realizations of the auction-plus-bargaining game from sales
36:1842:92140:16:17:79:511:634:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:by fleet/lease sellers (as opposed to sales where the seller was a used-car dealer) from six

36:1844:92322:17:17:79:511:600:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:observe are the seller’s reported secret reserve price,  the final transaction price,  the final
36:1845:92418:17:17:79:511:583:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:allocation  (i.e.   an  indicator  for  whether  the  car  sold),  and  the  auction  price.   We  also
36:1846:92521:17:17:79:511:566:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:observe a large set of observable characteristics of each sale, including characteristics of the
36:1847:92617:17:17:79:511:549:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:car and features of the auction house environment at the time of the sale.  Our data also
36:1848:92706:17:42:79:504:532:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:contains bid logs for a subset of sales, from which the number of bidders can be inferred.

36:1850:92870:17:17:79:511:473:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:will introduce here some notation specific to our application.  The key object of interest for
36:1851:92964:17:17:79:511:456:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:our counterfactual exercises is the distribution of seller private valuations,VS∼FS.  The
36:1852:93053:17:17:79:511:439:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:distribution of buyer valuations,VB∼FB, is also of interest, but Larsen (2014) demonstrates
36:1853:93144:17:16:79:511:422:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that, in this setting, bidders in the auction cannot gain by deviating from truthtelling, and
36:1854:93237:16:17:79:511:406:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:thusFBcan be estimated quite easily using a standard order statistics inversion using the
36:1855:93326:17:17:79:510:389:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:high bid from the auction, a random variable we denoteHB∼FHB.17We assume here that
36:1856:93408:17:17:79:511:372:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f5:VBandVSare independent and hence, by truthtelling,HBandRwill also be independent.
36:1857:93489:17:17:79:511:355:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We further assume that the data represents independent realizations of play from a single,
36:1858:93579:17:17:79:511:338:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:position-invariant  equilibrium  of  the  game  (with  the  analytical  characterization  of  that
36:1859:93677:17:20:79:323:321:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:equilibrium unknown to us as the econometricans).
36:1860:93726:20:17:91:510:301:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:To estimateFS, we apply the results for imperfectly observed actions from Section 4 and

36:1862:93906:17:17:79:510:267:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the seller’s secret reserve price (a random variableR∼FR) is a strictly increasing function
36:1863:93997:17:16:79:511:250:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of  her  valuationVS—and  thus  serves  as  a  one-to-one  action  shifter—and  that  the  game
36:1864:94092:16:17:79:511:234:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:satisfies the separable heterogeneity property of Section 7.2.  Larsen (2014) demonstrates
36:1865:94182:17:37:79:511:217:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that these two properties will indeed be satisfied in Bayes-Nash equilibria of this game as
36:1866:94273:37:15:79:510:180:8:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f11:17N, the number of bidders, varies from one instance of the game to the next.  We assumeNis independent

37:1891:95891:17:20:79:510:532:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in this application, but for clarity we will simply refer to the reserve price asRthroughout.
37:1892:95984:20:17:91:511:512:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We  first  describe  our  preliminary  estimation  steps  before  we  apply  the  actual  menu
37:1893:96078:17:17:79:511:495:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:estimation.  Because of the position-invariance property, we can first control for observable
37:1894:96171:17:16:79:511:478:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:heterogeneity through a regression of auction prices and reserve prices onYj,  a large set
37:1895:96261:16:17:79:511:462:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of observables.19We assume this variable enters valuations and actions as a single index,
37:1896:96350:17:17:79:511:445:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f5:Y′jη, and we estimateηthrough a linear regression.  For the sake of concreteness, we will
37:1897:96439:17:17:79:510:428:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:refer to the predicted value from this regression,Y′jˆη, as the “bluebook” value of the car.
37:1898:96531:17:17:79:511:411:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We treat the residuals from this regression (that is, reserve prices and auction prices minus
37:1899:96624:17:17:79:511:394:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the bluebook) as contaminated with an unobserved heterogeneity term,W∼FW, which we
37:1900:96706:17:16:79:510:377:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:assume is independent ofVB,VS, andN.  Let these residuals be denoted by the random
37:1901:96788:16:17:79:510:361:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:variables ̃R=R+Wand ̃HB=HB+W.  We then estimateFW,FR, andFHBby maximum
37:1902:96858:17:21:79:463:344:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:likelihood, as in (16), parameterizing each distribution as a Normal distribution.
37:1903:96940:21:17:91:511:323:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:To apply the menu approach, we then estimate the object ̃P( ̃r)—the noisy measure of the
37:1904:97028:17:16:79:511:306:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:expected allocation function—a using local linear regression ofxjon ̃rjusing a Gaussian
37:1905:97115:16:49:79:511:290:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:kernel.20To  estimate ̃T( ̃r),  we  perform  a  similar  local  linear  regression,  but  where  the
37:1906:97215:49:15:79:511:241:8:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f11:18While our estimation relies strongly on the secret reserve price being a one-to-one function of type, even if
37:1907:97326:15:10:79:511:226:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:this assumption is violated, our results in Sections 4.3 and 4.4 suggest that, so long as the setting is relatively
37:1908:97441:10:9:79:476:216:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:smooth, our estimates of value distributions and trade surplus are likely to be close to true values.
37:1909:97542:9:14:79:511:207:8:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f11:19The vectorYjcontains fifth-order polynomial terms (all degrees of the polynomial from one through five)

37:1911:97749:11:11:79:511:182:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:to sell the car; the number of pictures of the car displayed online on the auction house’s website; a dummy
37:1912:97856:11:11:79:511:171:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:for whether or not the odometer reading is considered accurate,  and the interaction of this dummy with

37:1918:98492:11:11:79:511:105:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:dummies for discrete odometer bins; and several measures of the thickness of the market during a given sale
37:1919:98599:11:8:79:492:94:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:and of the order the cars were run (see Larsen 2014 for details on the construction of these measures).
37:1920:98702:8:15:79:511:86:8:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f11:20We choose a bandwidth of 500 for this estimation.  The mean and standard deviation of reserve prices in
37:1921:98807:15:0:79:211:71:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:the data are $10,385 and $5,805.
38:1922:98857:0:15:79:511:688:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:dependent variable when trade occurred is the final transaction price minusY′jˆη, denoted,
38:1923:98947:15:23:78:90:673:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5: ̃tj.
38:1924:98952:23:16:91:510:650:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f14:Given the estimates ofFR,FW, ̃P( ̃r), and ̃T( ̃r), we solve for the true menu{(P(r),T0(r))}
38:1925:99043:16:17:79:510:634:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:using minimum weighted distance as described in (17) and (18).  ForP(r)we use quadratic
38:1926:99130:17:17:79:511:617:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:splines with 9 knots, constrained to be nondecreasing.  ForT0(r)we use cubic splines with
38:1927:99219:17:17:79:511:600:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:7 knots, constrained to be convex.  Finally, since the objectT0(P(r))is represented as a
38:1928:99307:17:17:79:511:583:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:convex sum of splines, we can analytically take its derivatives, giving us the final estimated
38:1929:99401:17:17:79:511:566:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:mapping from reserve prices to valuesvS(r). We then estimate the gains from trade attained
38:1930:99491:17:29:79:501:549:11:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:by a seller with valuevSasvSP(r(vS)) −T0(r(vS)), wherer(vS)is the inverse ofvS(r).21
38:1931:99575:29:17:79:511:520:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:8.3.Estimation Results.Before displaying the estimated menu and valuations, we first
38:1932:99659:17:17:79:511:503:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:provide some descriptive evidence that different secret reserve prices do indeed appear to
38:1933:99749:17:17:79:511:486:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:yield different payoffs for sellers, and hence can serve to help separate seller types as a our
38:1934:99844:17:17:79:511:469:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:method requires.  In the left panel of Figure 5 we show the probability of sale as a function
38:1935:99937:17:17:79:511:452:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of sellers’ residualized reserve prices, ̃R.  This probability is estimated from a local linear
38:1936:100032:17:16:79:511:435:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:regression, corresponding to 1− ̃P( ̃r), as ̃P( ̃r)is the probability of the sellerkeepingthe
38:1937:100125:16:17:79:511:419:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:good.   The  units  for  the  horizontal  axis  are  $1,000,  and  these  numbers  can  be  negative
38:1938:100225:17:17:79:511:402:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:because they are the result of subtracting offY′jˆη;  these numbers can thus be thought of
38:1939:100315:17:17:79:510:385:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:indicating where the reserve price lies relative to the bluebook estimate of the car, (Y′jˆη).
38:1940:100409:17:17:79:511:368:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The right panel of Figure 5 displays, on the vertical axis, the auction price and the final
38:1941:100500:17:17:79:511:351:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:price from the mechanism, again from a local linear regression against reserve prices.22The
38:1942:100591:17:17:79:511:334:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:regressions in each panel use observations with reserve prices lying between the 0.01 and
38:1943:100680:17:20:79:275:317:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:0.99 quantiles of empirical reserve prices.
38:1944:100723:20:17:91:511:297:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Figure  5 demonstrates  that  auction prices  are correlated with  reserve  prices,  violating
38:1945:100817:17:17:79:511:280:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the  independence  assumption  of  the  baseline  model  of  Section  2.   This  suggests  that  it
38:1946:100916:17:16:79:511:263:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:is  important  to  account  for  unobserved  heterogeneity  in  this  setting.   We  also  see  that
38:1947:101016:16:17:79:511:247:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:sellers who post higher reserve prices sell with lower probabilities,  but are able to attain
38:1948:101109:17:17:79:511:230:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:higher  prices  conditional  on  sale.   In  particular,  the  difference  between  the  average  final
38:1949:101212:17:17:79:511:213:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:price conditional on sale and the average auction price is increasing in the reserve price.
38:1950:101303:17:17:79:511:196:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The average auction price roughly measures the value of unobserved car-level heterogeneity
38:1951:101393:17:21:79:511:179:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:conditional on the reserve price.23Thus, if the difference between the final price and the
38:1952:101483:21:15:79:511:158:8:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f11:21Appendix D describes how computing buyers’ gains from trade requires an additional assumption:  that
38:1953:101585:15:11:79:511:143:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:each seller type trades with all buyer types above a certain cutoff.  Larsen (2014) demonstrates that this
38:1954:101691:11:8:79:511:132:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:property will indeed be satisfied in Bayes-Nash equilibria of this game, relying on results from Storms (2015).
38:1955:101802:8:15:79:511:124:8:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f11:22Recall that auction prices and final prices will not necessarily coincide with one another because of the
38:1956:101909:15:11:79:511:109:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:bargaining component of the mechanism.  Also, the final price exists only for observations of the game that
38:1957:102016:11:8:79:294:98:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:end in trade, whereas the auction price always exists.
38:1958:102070:8:17:79:510:90:8:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f11:23To see this, note that, since ̃HB=HB+W, ̃R=R+W, andHB,R,Ware mutually independent, we have
38:1959:102162:17:0:79:104:73:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f7:thatE

39:1969:102360:17:17:79:511:671:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:reserve prices are forgoing some probability of selling the good in order to obtain a higher
39:1970:102452:17:20:79:126:654:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:sale price.
39:1971:102463:20:17:91:511:634:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In Figure 6, we show the local linear estimates of ̃P( ̃r), ̃T( ̃r), as well as the unobserved
39:1972:102557:17:17:79:511:617:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:heterogeneity corrected estimatesP(r),T0(r).  We also display intermediate steps in this
39:1973:102645:17:17:79:510:600:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f8:unobserved heterogeneity correction to illustrate the procedure.  For probabilities, the ̃P( ̃r)
39:1974:102741:17:17:79:510:583:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:function is essentially a noisy version of theP(r)function; thus, correcting for unobserved
39:1975:102832:17:17:79:511:566:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:heterogeneity will yield an estimate ofP(r)that is steeper than ̃P( ̃r).  This can be seen in
39:1976:102925:17:17:79:511:549:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:panel A by comparing theP(r)line to the ̃P( ̃r)line.  For transfers, unobserved heterogene-
39:1977:103016:17:16:79:511:532:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ity necessitates two corrections to the ̃T( ̃r)function.  First, we subtract from ̃T( ̃r)the term
39:1978:103113:16:17:79:510:516:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f5:E(W∆P| ̃r),  which  represents  the  expected  value  of  the  unobserved  heterogeneity  condi-
39:1979:103209:17:17:79:510:499:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:tional on ̃r.  Intuitively, for higher values of ̃r, we will observe that trades tend to happen at
39:1980:103307:17:17:79:511:482:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:higher prices, but much of this is due to the unobserved heterogeneity termWbeing higher
39:1981:103395:17:17:79:511:465:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:on average, rather than the transferT0(r)being higher.  In panel B, comparing the ̃T( ̃r)line
39:1982:103488:17:17:79:511:448:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:to the ̃T( ̃r)−E(W∆P| ̃r)line shows that this correction makes the slope of the expected
39:1983:103576:17:16:79:510:431:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:transfer function significantly less negative.  Secondly,T0(r)is essentially a noise-corrected
39:1984:103670:16:0:79:168:415:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f7:version of ̃T( ̃r)−E

39:1988:103701:12:17:221:511:415:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:, and thus the slope and concavity ofT0(r)are both larger in
39:1989:103761:17:17:79:511:398:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:absolute value than the noisy version.  The net effect is thatT0(r)is much less negatively
39:1990:103851:17:17:79:511:381:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:sloped—and somewhat more concave—than the original nonparametric estimate ̃T( ̃r).  In

39:1993:104121:17:17:79:511:330:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in each case, the estimate aligns closely with the ̃P( ̃r)or ̃T( ̃r) −E(W∆P| ̃r)function as it

39:1996:104305:17:17:79:511:276:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f5:T0(r), withP(r)on the horizontal axis andT0(r)on the vertical axis.  Each point on the
39:1997:104391:17:17:79:511:259:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:menu  corresponds  to  an  expected  payoff  for  the  seller  from  choosing  a  particular  secret
39:1998:104491:17:16:79:511:242:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:reserve price.  We note here that our formulation for payoffs described in (1) in Section 2,
39:1999:104583:16:17:79:511:226:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f5:vP(a) −T(a), is perhaps more intuitive in a game where the agent of interest is a buyer, in
39:2000:104674:17:17:79:511:209:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:which caseP(a)represents the expected probability of the buyer winning andT(a)is the
39:2001:104758:17:17:79:511:192:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:expected payment made by the buyer.  Here, with the agent being a seller,P(r)represents
39:2002:104845:17:17:79:510:175:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the  probability  of  the  sellerkeepingthe  good  (so  1−P(r)is  the  probability  that  a  sale
39:2003:104942:17:17:79:511:158:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:occurs)  andT0(r)is  the  expected  transferpaid  by  the  seller(so−T0(r)is  the  expected
39:2004:105033:17:16:79:511:141:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:payment  received  by  the  seller).   Also,  as  highlighted  above,  all  seller  values  are  relative
39:2005:105138:16:17:79:511:125:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:to the estimated bluebook value of the car,Y′jˆη, so a seller value of -$1,000, for example,
39:2006:105230:17:0:79:385:108:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:represents a seller who values the car at $1,000 below bluebook.
40:2007:105312:0:17:91:511:688:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f7:With this interpretation in mind, we compare several points long the menu, markedA–D
40:2008:105396:17:17:79:511:671:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in Figure 7.  Each point corresponds to a distinct reserve price, which we will refer to as
40:2009:105487:17:17:79:511:654:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f5:rA–rD, whererA< rB< rC< rD.  PointsAandBlie along the downward-sloping portion
40:2010:105565:17:17:79:511:637:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of the menu.  ChoicerAwould yield a lower probability of keeping the good and a lower
40:2011:105650:17:17:79:511:620:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:expected transfer (i.e.  a less negativeT0(r)) than would choicerB.  Therefore, a seller who
40:2012:105742:17:16:79:511:603:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:choosesrAmust want to get rid of the car more than a seller who choosesrB, implying that
40:2013:105830:16:17:79:510:587:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the former seller has a lower value (lowers) than the latter.  This is precisely what Figure 7
40:2014:105924:17:17:79:510:570:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:shows:  the derivative of the menu atrAis more negative than atrB, and these derivatives
40:2015:106012:17:17:79:511:553:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f7:(by Corollary 2) reveal sellers’ values, so a seller choosingrAmust therefore have a values
40:2016:106103:17:17:79:511:536:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that is farther below the bluebook value of the car than does a seller choosingrB.  Points
40:2017:106193:17:17:79:511:519:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f5:CandDlie along the upward-sloping portion of the menu.  Comparing these two points,
40:2018:106276:17:16:79:511:502:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:choicerCwould yield a lower probability of keeping the good but a higher expected transfer
40:2019:106366:16:17:79:511:486:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:to the seller (i.e.  a more negativeT0(r)).  Therefore, a seller choosingrDmust want to keep
40:2020:106458:17:17:79:511:469:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the good more (i.e.  have a highers) than a seller choosingrC.  This is again clearly revealed
40:2021:106552:17:17:79:511:452:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f7:by the derivatives of the menu at these points:  the derivative is more positive at pointD
40:2022:106642:17:20:79:157:435:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:than at pointC.
40:2023:106657:20:17:91:510:415:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Taking these derivatives at each pointryields the mapping between the reserve price and
40:2024:106744:17:17:79:511:398:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the inferred valuescorresponding to that reserve price.  We display this mapping with the
40:2025:106833:17:17:79:511:381:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:solid blue line in panel A of Figure 8, with reserve prices on the horizontal axis and values on
40:2026:106929:17:17:79:511:364:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the vertical axis.  The units for each axis are $1,000.  The dashed lines indicate a pointwise
40:2027:107023:17:17:79:511:347:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:95% confidence band computed by bootstrapping the exercise 500 times.  The red line shows
40:2028:107112:17:16:79:511:330:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the 45 degree line (the reserve prices itself) for comparison.  To interpret this plot, consider
40:2029:107208:16:17:79:511:314:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:a particular point on this mapping at approximatelyr=-$300 (-0.3 on the horizontal axis).
40:2030:107297:17:17:79:511:297:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We see that the corresponding inferred value for such a seller is approximatelys=-$1,000
40:2031:107385:17:17:79:511:280:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(a value of -1 on the vertical axis).  Therefore, a seller who chooses a reserve price that is
40:2032:107479:17:17:79:511:263:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:$300  below  the  bluebook  is  actually  willing  to  let  the  car  go  for  up  to  $1,000  below  the
40:2033:107584:17:20:79:125:246:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:bluebook.
40:2034:107593:20:17:91:511:226:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The estimated reserve-value mapping, combined with the distributionFRof reserve prices,
40:2035:107680:17:17:79:511:209:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:gives us an estimated distributionFSof sellers’ values, and we plot this in panel B of Figure 8.
40:2036:107776:17:17:79:511:192:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:For comparison, we also plot the estimated distribution of the highest-value buyer, which
40:2037:107865:17:17:79:511:175:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:is  the  buyer  who  potentially  ends  up  in  bargaining  with  the  seller.24The  distributions
40:2038:107963:17:16:79:511:158:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:indicate that 80% of sellers have values less than about $50 below the bluebook estimate,
40:2039:108052:16:17:79:511:142:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:while nearly 90% of buyers have valuesabovethis amount.  This suggests that there is a
40:2040:108138:17:17:79:511:125:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:lot of room for trade gains in this market, which is to be expected given that these auction
40:2041:108230:17:22:79:511:108:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:houses have been functioning well as market makers in this industry for three quarters of
40:2042:108319:22:15:79:510:86:8:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f11:24This distribution can be computed by using the objectsFBand Pr(N=n), described above. The maximum
40:2043:108418:15:0:79:291:71:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f8:order stastic distribution is then given byFB(1)(y) =

41:2046:108556:0:17:79:511:688:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:a  century.   However,  panel  B  also  shows  overlap  between  seller  and  buyer  distributions,
41:2047:108655:17:17:79:511:671:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:which, by the Myerson and Satterthwaite (1983) Theorem, could lead to inefficiency in this
41:2048:108745:17:17:79:511:654:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:market  due  to  incomplete  information,  with  some  trades  failing  to  occur  even  when  the
41:2049:108843:17:17:79:511:637:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:highest-value  buyer  values  the  good  more  than  the  seller.   We  will  analyze  this  in  more
41:2050:108944:17:20:79:140:620:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:detail below.
41:2051:108957:20:17:91:511:600:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We pause to remark on individual rationality.  Throughout our identification arguments
41:2052:109043:17:17:79:511:583:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and estimation process, we have only used localincentive compatibilityconditions of sellers—
41:2053:109135:17:17:79:511:566:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that is,  the condition that outcomes under the reserve prices chosen are preferred to the
41:2054:109225:17:17:79:511:549:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:outcomes from any other possible choice of reserve price.  We have not exploited or enforced
41:2055:109317:17:16:79:511:532:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f5:individual rationalityconstraints.  Individual rationality (IR) for the seller refers to the fact
41:2056:109414:16:17:79:511:516:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that the seller should always be able to choose an outcome corresponding to(P,T) = (1, 0);
41:2057:109504:17:17:79:511:499:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that is, keeping the good with probability 1 and receiving no payment.  There is no simple
41:2058:109594:17:17:79:511:482:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:way to enforce this constraint jointly with our estimation procedure, but it can be imposed
41:2059:109685:17:17:79:511:465:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:after the fact.  In our estimated menu,  we find that the IR constraint is violated for the
41:2060:109776:17:17:79:511:448:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:roughly  17%  of  seller  types  who  are  inferred  to  have  the  highest  values,  implying  that
41:2061:109876:17:16:79:511:431:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:these sellers would be better off ex-ante by not participating in the mechanism.  Since it
41:2062:109966:16:17:79:511:415:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:is empirically implausible that sellers would actually violate individual rationality, in our
41:2063:110059:17:17:79:511:398:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:counterfactual exercise below, we will analyze the mechanism’s efficiency only for the 83%
41:2064:110149:17:17:79:511:381:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of seller types for whom the IR constraint is satisfied.  This is equivalent to assuming that
41:2065:110242:17:17:79:511:364:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:IR-violating sellers have infinitely high values, which is conservative for estimating actual
41:2066:110335:17:17:79:511:347:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and potential gains from trade as it treats these sellers as never having potential gains from
41:2067:110429:17:16:79:511:330:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:trade.  An alternative approach would be to assume that all IR-violating sellers have the
41:2068:110518:16:17:79:511:314:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:same values and expected outcomes as the highest non-IR-violating seller type.  We found
41:2069:110606:17:17:79:511:297:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that taking this approach did not have noticeable effects, qualitatively or quantitatively, on
41:2070:110700:17:40:79:204:280:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:our counterfactual results.
41:2071:110727:40:17:79:511:240:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:8.4.Efficiency,  Optimality,  and Equity.We now compare the outcomes observed in
41:2072:110807:17:17:79:511:223:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the data to a number of counterfactual benchmarks in order to study efficiency, optimality,
41:2073:110898:17:17:79:511:206:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and equity.  These counterfactual benchmarks can each be computed using the estimated
41:2074:110983:17:17:79:511:189:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:distributions  of  valuations.   First,  we  calculate  the  fully  efficient  outcome,  where  trade
41:2075:111084:17:17:79:511:172:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:occurs whenever the highest-value buyer values the good more than the seller.  Second, we
41:2076:111173:17:16:79:511:155:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:calculate the the second-best, information-constrained mechanism.  This is the mechanism
41:2077:111261:16:17:79:511:139:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that would maximize ex-ante efficiency in a setting withNbuyers and 1 seller, taking into
41:2078:111350:17:17:79:511:122:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:account players’ incentive compatibility and individual rationality constraints (and budget
41:2079:111441:17:17:79:511:105:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:balance).  This mechanism is similar the second-best mechanism studied in Myerson and
41:2080:111526:17:17:79:511:88:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Satterthwaite  (1983),  but  theirs  is  for  just  1  buyer  and  1  seller.   Appendix  D  discusses
41:2081:111628:17:0:79:511:71:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:technical details of how we solve for this mechanism.  Third,  we consider the mechanism
42:2082:111734:0:17:79:511:688:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that would be optimal for the seller in this setting, which is a second-price auction with an
42:2083:111827:17:17:79:511:671:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:optimally chosen public reserve price.  Fourth, we consider the buyer-optimal mechanism,
42:2084:111915:17:20:79:450:654:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in which the highest-value buyer makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer to the seller.
42:2085:111996:20:17:91:511:634:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:These above mechanisms allow us to examine the efficiency of the real-world mechanism
42:2086:112081:17:17:79:511:617:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and its optimality relative to what would be optimal for one-party or the other.  To study
42:2087:112171:17:17:79:511:600:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:equity—who obtains what share of the total surplus—we impose no assumptions a priori
42:2088:112255:17:17:79:511:583:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:about who has more bargaining power, but instead let the data speak to this question by
42:2089:112342:17:17:79:511:566:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:examining the buyer and seller surplus in each of these counterfactual mechanisms and in
42:2090:112430:17:20:79:205:549:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the real-world mechanism.
42:2091:112455:20:17:91:511:529:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Table 3 displays the welfare measures for each of the counterfactual mechanisms and for
42:2092:112542:17:17:79:511:512:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the real-world mechanism.  Rows 1–4 report each of the four counterfactual mechanisms,
42:2093:112628:17:17:79:511:495:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:followed by the real-world auction-plus-bargaining mechanism in the final row.  For each
42:2094:112716:17:16:79:511:478:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:mechanism,  the  first  column  reports  the  probability  of  trade.   Columns  2–6  report  total
42:2095:112815:16:17:79:511:462:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:expected surplus, expected surplus and margin for the seller (seller margin is the difference
42:2096:112908:17:17:79:511:445:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:between the seller’s price and the seller’s value for transacted cars), and expected surplus
42:2097:113000:17:17:79:511:428:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and margin for the highest-value buyer (buyer margin is the difference between the buyer’s
42:2098:113090:17:17:79:511:411:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:value and the price paid for transacted cars).  The final column reports the percentage of
42:2099:113180:17:20:79:241:394:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the surplus achieved by the seller.
42:2100:113215:20:17:91:511:374:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In terms of surplus division (the final column in Table 3), the mechanism in the data gives
42:2101:113306:17:17:79:511:357:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the seller 60.4% of the trade surplus, slightly lower than the 66.8% that sellers achieve in the
42:2102:113402:17:17:79:511:340:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:second-best mechanism, and lying between the extremes of 41.6% and 76.3% that the seller
42:2103:113490:17:17:79:511:323:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:would  achieve  in  the  buyer-optimal  and  seller-optimal  mechanisms  respectively.   Quanti-
42:2104:113586:17:16:79:511:306:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:tatively,  this  implies  that  sellers  achieve  $2,093  of  surplus  in  the  real-world  mechanism,
42:2105:113688:16:17:79:511:290:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:compared to $2,421 in the second-best mechanism, $2,628 in the seller-optimal mechanism,
42:2106:113776:17:17:79:511:273:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and  $1,335  in  the  buyer-optimal  mechanism.   We  can  also  calculate  average  margins  for
42:2107:113873:17:17:79:511:256:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:sellers by dividing seller utility by the probability of trade.  This is $2,571 in the real-world
42:2108:113970:17:17:79:511:239:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:mechanism, compared to $1,940 in the buyer-optimal mechanism and $3,443 in the seller
42:2109:114055:17:17:79:511:222:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:optimal  mechanism.   Given  that  average  car  prices  are  approximately  $10,000,  this  im-
42:2110:114151:17:16:79:511:205:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:plies that sellers’ markups over their reservation values are approximately 26% of car prices
42:2111:114244:16:17:79:511:189:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in the real-world mechanism,  compared to 19% and 34% at the buyer and seller-optimal
42:2112:114329:17:17:79:511:172:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:mechanisms respectively.  Buyer surplus is $1,374 in the real-world mechanism, compared
42:2113:114416:17:17:79:511:155:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:to  $818  and  $1,874  in  the  seller-optimal  and  buyer-optimal  mechanisms  respectively.   In
42:2114:114514:17:17:79:511:138:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:margin terms, buyers’ margins in the real-world mechanism are roughly 14% of car prices,
42:2115:114602:17:20:79:385:121:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:computed by dividing buyer surplus by the probability of trade.
42:2116:114665:20:17:91:511:101:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:In Figure 9, we display the seller surplus and trade probability specific to different seller
42:2117:114758:17:0:79:511:84:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:types (different valuess) in the real-world mechanism and in each counterfactual mechanism.
43:2118:114918:0:17:79:511:688:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Panel A demonstrates that in the real-world mechanism sellers with values near the median
43:2119:115007:17:17:79:511:671:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(the  median  seller  value  is  approximately  $78  below  the  bluebook  estimate)  trade  with
43:2120:115104:17:17:79:511:654:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:substantially  higher  probabilities  than  in  the  buyer-  and  seller-offer  mechanisms;  sellers
43:2121:115204:17:17:79:511:637:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:with values towards the extremes of the distributions trade with probabilities equal to or
43:2122:115294:17:17:79:511:620:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:lower than the seller-optimal mechanism.  This suggests that sellers with values close to the
43:2123:115387:17:16:79:511:603:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:median contribute significantly to the relatively high efficiency of the real-world auction-
43:2124:115479:16:17:79:511:587:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:plus-bargaining mechanism.  Panel B demonstrates that the real-world mechanism yields
43:2125:115564:17:17:79:511:570:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:sellers a surplus that, across most of the range of seller types, is roughly a constant fraction
43:2126:115660:17:17:79:511:553:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of what the seller could achieve in the seller-optimal or the second-best mechanisms.  At
43:2127:115749:17:17:79:511:536:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:seller values closer to the bluebook estimate (i.e.  at seller values closer to 0 on the horizontal
43:2128:115848:17:17:79:511:519:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:axis), the seller-optimal mechanism yields the seller a much higher surplus than in the real-
43:2129:115941:17:20:79:281:502:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:world or second-best efficient mechanisms.
43:2130:115983:20:17:91:511:482:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Returning  to  Table  3,  we  find  that  the  Myerson-Satterthwaite  impossibility  result  for
43:2131:116079:17:17:79:511:465:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:1 buyer and 1 seller—which implies that the second best will always fall short of the first
43:2132:116170:17:17:79:511:448:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:best when buyer and seller distributions overlap—imposes very weak restrictions on feasible
43:2133:116261:17:16:79:511:431:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:mechanisms in this context: the maximal possible second-best surplus is 99.99% of the first-
43:2134:116353:16:17:79:511:415:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:best trade surplus.  This is partly because competition between multiple buyers (N >1)
43:2135:116439:17:17:79:511:398:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:tends to alleviate Myerson-Satterthwaite impossibility.  In Figure 10, we examine this result
43:2136:116532:17:17:79:511:381:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:more  closely.   We  re-compute  the  second-best  and  first-best  mechanisms  under  different
43:2137:116628:17:17:79:511:364:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:assumptions for the average number of bidders present at the auction, varying this number
43:2138:116717:17:17:79:511:347:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:smoothly  between  between  1  and  2.34,  the  number  estimated  from  bid  log  data.25The
43:2139:116810:17:16:79:511:330:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:upper (blue) line displays the percentage of the first-best surplus achievable in the second-
43:2140:116903:16:17:79:511:314:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:best mechanism, the middle (red) line displays the fraction of first-best sales achieved by
43:2141:116994:17:17:79:511:297:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the second-best mechanism, and the lower (yellow) line displays the percentage of the total
43:2142:117085:17:17:79:511:280:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:surplus sellers achieve in the second-best mechanism.  The plot shows that, as the average
43:2143:117175:17:17:79:511:263:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:number  of  bidders  increases,  the  second-best  achieves  a  larger  fraction  of  the  first-best
43:2144:117276:17:20:79:448:246:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:surplus and sale volume, and sellers attain a larger share of the total surplus.
43:2145:117356:20:17:91:511:226:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Table  3  also  demonstrates  that  the  auction-plus-bargaining  mechanism  in  the  data  is
43:2146:117450:17:17:79:511:209:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:fairly efficient relative to the second-best,  achieving $3,467 in expected gains from trade,
43:2147:117543:17:17:79:511:192:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:which represents 95.6% of the second-best surplus level, $3,626.  However, the mechanism
43:2148:117631:17:17:79:511:175:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:achieves trade only 81.4% of the time, whereas the second-best mechanism would achieve
43:2149:117717:17:16:79:511:158:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:trade 96.4% of the time.  Interestingly, if the auction house were to employ a mechanism
43:2150:117805:16:17:79:511:142:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that was optimal for either the seller or the buyer, the probability of trade would drop to
43:2151:117896:17:17:79:511:125:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:76.3% and 68.8%, respectively, and the total surplus would drop to $3,445 and $3,209.  This
43:2152:117987:17:22:79:511:108:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:would only be a slight drop in trade or total surplus in the case of the seller mechanism.
43:2153:118077:22:15:79:511:86:8:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f11:25We do this by taking convex combinations between the distribution of the number of bidders observed in
43:2154:118181:15:0:79:309:71:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:the data, and a distribution with a unit mass at 1 buyer.
44:2155:118256:0:17:79:511:688:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The  auction  house  revenue  model  is  such  that  fees  are  paid  only  when  trade  occurs,  so
44:2156:118356:17:17:79:511:671:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the  auction  house  cares  particularly  about  keeping  the  probability  of  trade  high.   This
44:2157:118455:17:17:79:511:654:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:may explain in part why the auction-plus-bargaining mechanism is used in practice over a
44:2158:118543:17:17:79:511:637:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:traditional auction with a reserve price; while the latter would be optimal for the seller, it
44:2159:118637:17:56:79:463:620:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:would reduce the probability of trade, reducing auction house revenue from fees.

44:2161:118729:27:16:79:511:537:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:9.1.Counterfactuals.As highlighted in the introduction, a number of counterfactual ex-
44:2162:118815:16:17:79:511:521:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ercises of interest for studying real-world mechanisms involve comparing a mechanism used
44:2163:118904:17:17:79:511:504:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in practice to some theoretical benchmark that achieves some notion of efficiency, optimal-
44:2164:118995:17:17:79:511:487:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ity, equity, no-collusion, efficient collusion, etc.  Or the counterfactual may involve a change
44:2165:119091:17:17:79:511:470:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:to an alternative mechanism completely, such as a shift from a median price auction to a
44:2166:119179:17:17:79:511:453:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:first-price auction.  Counterfactuals such as these can be performed using the objects our
44:2167:119269:17:16:79:511:436:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:approach delivers.  Certain types of counterfactuals, however, would not be feasible using
44:2168:119359:16:17:79:511:420:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:our approach.  This includes any counterfactual in which the researcher needs to be able to
44:2169:119450:17:17:79:511:403:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:simulate from the game played in the data and solve for an equilibrium.  For example, in
44:2170:119538:17:17:79:511:386:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:our application to used-car auctions, it would be infeasible to use our approach to study
44:2171:119627:17:17:79:511:369:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the question of what would happen if credit constraints were introduced or if players were
44:2172:119717:17:17:79:511:352:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:required to pay a cost for each bargaining offer made.  Such counterfactuals would require
44:2173:119807:17:16:79:511:335:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:being  able  to  solve  for  equilibria  of  an  alternating-offer  offer  bargaining  game  with  two-
44:2174:119910:16:17:79:511:319:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:sided incomplete information (which, as explained above, is beyond the state of the current
44:2175:120001:17:17:79:511:302:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:theory  literature).   Our  approach  explicitly  avoids  modeling  the  game  actually  played  in
44:2176:120100:17:17:79:511:285:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the data, achieving identification of primitives without solving for an equilibrium.  It is an
44:2177:120194:17:17:79:511:268:11:g_d0_f10:11:g_d0_f5:incomplete  modelapproach.  We see this as a plus for the approach, making it capable of
44:2178:120282:17:17:79:511:251:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:applying to settings where the rules of the game are either unknown or the game’s equilibria
44:2179:120374:17:16:79:511:234:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:are complex, but the approach does indeed rule out studying some counterfactuals that the
44:2180:120463:16:46:79:341:218:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:additional structure of a complete model could deliver.
44:2181:120518:46:17:79:510:172:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:9.2.Beliefs  and  Rational  Expectations.Throughout  this  paper,  we  have  assumed
44:2182:120602:17:16:79:511:155:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Bayes-Nash equilibrium,  which requires that agents have rational expectations about the
44:2183:120690:16:17:79:511:139:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f7:distributions of opposing actions, and thus know the functionsP(a),T(a)for any actiona
44:2184:120776:17:17:79:511:122:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that they could play.  This assumption is important for our estimation procedure; if agents’
44:2185:120868:17:17:79:510:105:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:beliefs coincide with the true conditional expectationsP(a),T(a), we can simply estimate
44:2186:120956:17:17:79:511:88:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:agents’ beliefs using expected outcome functions in data.  Our approach is in fact robust to
44:2187:121048:17:0:79:511:71:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:some deviations from Bayes-Nash equilibrium:  since only agenti’s best response condition
45:2188:121206:0:17:79:511:688:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f7:is used to estimate her valuation, inference about agenti’s value only requires that agenti
45:2189:121297:17:21:79:453:671:11:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f4:has correct beliefs about opponents’ actions, not that all agents are rational.26
45:2190:121378:21:16:91:511:650:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Our approach can fail for agents who do not have correct beliefs about the distribution
45:2191:121465:16:14:79:511:634:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of opponents’ actions.  These agents can be thought of as optimizing with respect to some
45:2192:121554:14:20:80:510:620:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5: ̇P(a), ̇T(a)functions  which  may  differ  from  empirical  averages,  and  the  econometrician
45:2193:121650:20:17:79:511:600:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:must then take an essentially unverifiable stance on how agents’ ̇P(a), ̇T(a)functions are
45:2194:121740:17:17:79:511:583:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:formed. A number of approaches have been proposed in the literature. Agarwal and Somaini
45:2195:121828:17:17:79:511:566:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(2018) estimate values assuming rational expectations as well as coarse and lagged expec-
45:2196:121917:17:17:79:511:549:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:tations.  Syrgkanis, Tamer, and Ziani (2017) explore inference in auctions under different
45:2197:122007:17:16:79:511:532:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:information assumptions.  In a related literature, Doraszelski, Lewis, and Pakes (2018) show
45:2198:122099:16:17:79:511:516:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that firms in a new market for frequency response behave in a way that is more consistent
45:2199:122188:17:21:79:376:499:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:with adaptive learning than rational-expectations equilibrium.

45:2202:122440:17:17:79:511:445:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:assumption of rational expectations is important for our methods to work.  This may be
45:2203:122526:17:17:79:511:428:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:a reasonable assumption for marketplace-like settings, in which traders interact frequently
45:2204:122617:17:17:79:511:411:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in  environments  that  are  relatively  stationary  over  time,  but  it  may  be  less  appropriate
45:2205:122718:17:17:79:511:394:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:for large one-shot mechanisms, or nonstationary settings in which agents are learning and
45:2206:122807:17:34:79:306:377:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:converging towards optimal behavior over time.

45:2208:122928:17:17:79:510:326:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f5:tion.This  paper,  along  with  GPV  and  many  of  the  papers  discussed  in  the  subsection
45:2209:123023:17:17:79:511:309:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:above,  assumes  that  agents  are  optimizing  with  respect  to  some  beliefs  about  outcomes,
45:2210:123121:17:17:79:511:292:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and moreover that the econometrician can estimate these beliefs.  If these beliefs can be
45:2211:123210:17:16:79:511:275:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:estimated, revealed preference arguments can be applied to identify agents’ values.  We view
45:2212:123302:16:17:79:511:259:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:these papers as conceptually distinct from a set of identification and estimation approaches
45:2213:123394:17:17:79:511:242:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that are based instead on the concept ofrationalizability, orundominated  strategies.  Ex-
45:2214:123484:17:17:79:511:225:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:amples include Haile and Tamer (2003) (or recent work by Chesher and Rosen (2017)) for
45:2215:123570:17:17:79:511:208:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:estimating bounds on buyer valuations in ascending auctions or Larsen (2014) for estimat-
45:2216:123659:17:17:79:511:191:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ing bounds on seller valuations in bargaining games.  Rather than taking a stance on what
45:2217:123748:17:16:79:511:174:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:agents’ beliefs about outcomes are, these approaches rule out only values under which ac-
45:2218:123837:16:17:79:511:158:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:tions observed in the data are dominated—that is, values for which particular actions could
45:2219:123928:17:17:79:511:141:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:not to be rationalizable byanybelief.  In the classic example of Haile and Tamer (2003),
45:2220:124016:17:27:79:510:124:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:an agent bidding some amountyat some point in an ascending auction must have value
45:2221:124098:27:15:79:511:97:8:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f11:26A similar argument is made in Nekipelov, Syrgkanis, and Tardos (2015), who argue that many learning
45:2222:124199:15:11:79:511:82:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:algorithms should eventually converge to regret-free behavior, which motivates using no-regret conditions—
45:2223:124305:11:0:79:478:71:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:essentially best-response conditions for stationary averages over opponents’ actions—in estimation.
46:2224:124422:0:17:79:510:688:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f7:abovey; if not, there is no possible outcome that the agent could achieve from biddingy
46:2225:124509:17:21:79:277:671:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:that would give the agent positive utility.
46:2226:124552:21:16:91:511:650:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:The belief estimation approach requires strictly stronger assumptions about agents’ be-
46:2227:124639:16:17:79:511:634:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:liefs  than  the  rationalizability-based  approach;  if  the  econometrician  is  willing  to  make
46:2228:124739:17:17:79:511:617:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:these assumptions, the benefit can be powerful identification results with weaker assump-
46:2229:124828:17:17:79:511:600:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:tions about game structure.  In contrast to rationalizability-based approaches such as Haile
46:2230:124920:17:17:79:511:583:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and Tamer (2003), the approach we take here allows the econometrician to use essentially
46:2231:125008:17:17:79:511:566:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:no information about the rules of the game;  all relevant information about game rules is
46:2232:125097:17:17:79:511:549:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:inferred from observing game outcomes.  Moreover, rationalizability-based approaches tend
46:2233:125186:17:16:79:511:532:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:to only allow partial identification of values, whereas our approach can often achieve point
46:2234:125278:16:21:79:144:516:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:identification.
46:2235:125293:21:17:91:511:495:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:We believe that these two approaches can be used in a complementary manner.  In some
46:2236:125377:17:16:79:511:478:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:settings, for example, dominance-based arguments could be used to robustly find bounds
46:2237:125463:16:17:79:511:462:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:on agents’ values,  and the stronger assumption of Bayes-Nash equilibrium could be used
46:2238:125550:17:33:79:274:445:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:more tentatively to point-identify values.
46:2239:125592:33:17:79:511:412:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:9.4.Multiple Equilibria.We assume that agents are playing a single equilibrium across
46:2240:125677:17:17:79:511:395:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:all observations.  In some marketplace-like settings, agents interact with anonymous trading
46:2241:125769:17:17:79:511:378:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:partners and few observables are available for agents to coordinate on; the assumption that
46:2242:125860:17:17:79:511:361:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:all  agents  are  playing  the  same  equilibrium  may  be  plausible  in  these  settings.   In  other
46:2243:125963:17:17:79:511:344:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:settings,  agents  may  be  able  to  coordinate  to  play  different  equilibria  based  on  various
46:2244:126064:17:17:79:511:327:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:features  of  the  environment  that  they  observe.   For  example,  in  timber  auctions,  agents
46:2245:126163:17:16:79:511:310:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:bidding  in  auctions  for  high  quality  timber  could  play  a  certain  equilibrium,  bidding  in
46:2246:126264:16:17:79:511:294:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:a systematically different way than agents bidding in auctions for low quality timber.  In
46:2247:126354:17:17:79:511:277:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:such settings, if the econometrician observes all possible characteristics that agents could
46:2248:126446:17:17:79:511:260:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:use for coordination, the problem of multiple equilibria could be addressed by estimating
46:2249:126535:17:17:79:511:243:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:equilibrium menus conditional on observables, rather than pooling all observations into a
46:2250:126624:17:17:79:511:226:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:single menu.  This effectively allows a different equilibrium to be played for each possible
46:2251:126716:17:16:79:511:209:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:combination of observables characterizing a trading game.  There may be setting in which
46:2252:126804:16:17:79:511:193:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:agents play different equilibria conditional on variables unobserved by the econometrician;
46:2253:126895:17:17:79:511:176:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:this  presents  an  interesting  unobservable  heterogeneity  problem  for  which  we  do  not  yet
46:2254:126994:17:20:79:154:159:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:have a solution.
46:2255:127010:20:17:91:511:139:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Examples of features on which equilibrium selection can depend would be a reserve price
46:2256:127097:17:17:79:511:122:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in an auction or the number of competing bidders in an auction.  If reserve prices are present
46:2257:127191:17:17:79:511:105:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and vary from one instance of the game to the next, and if these reserve prices are observable
46:2258:127285:17:17:79:511:88:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:to agents, the econometrician would also need to observe and condition on reserve prices in
46:2259:127376:17:0:79:511:71:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:order to correctly estimate equilibrium menus for buyers.  Similarly, if agents can observe
47:2260:127536:0:17:79:511:688:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:the  number  of  their  competitors  and  this  number  affects  equilibrium  behavior  (it  would
47:2261:127634:17:17:79:511:671:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:do so in a first-price auction, for example, but not in an ascending button auction), then
47:2262:127724:17:17:79:511:654:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:econometrician should observe and condition on this quantity when estimating equilibrium
47:2263:127812:17:17:79:511:637:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:menus.  If, however, agents themselves do not observe the number of their competitors, the
47:2264:127902:17:33:79:432:620:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:econometrician need not observe it either in applying the menu approach.
47:2265:127974:33:17:79:510:587:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:9.5.Affine-Utility Games.We focus in this paper on trading games,  in which agents’
47:2266:128057:17:17:79:511:570:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:utility  functions  depend  on  an  indicator  variablexifor  trade  and  real-valued  transfers
47:2267:128153:17:16:79:510:553:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f5:ti.  However, our arguments only utilize the fact that agents’ expected utilities are affine
47:2268:128245:16:17:79:511:537:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:functions of expected outcomes, up to some unknown vector of types, and similar arguments
47:2269:128334:17:17:79:511:520:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:apply to other settings in which agents maximize objective functions which are affine in types
47:2270:128428:17:21:79:201:503:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:and observable outcomes.
47:2271:128452:21:16:91:511:482:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:For  example,  in  an  oligopolistic  competition  setting,  our  menu  estimation  approach  is
47:2272:128548:16:17:79:511:466:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:related to the Baker and Bresnahan (1988) approach of using firm cost shifters to estimate
47:2273:128638:17:17:79:511:449:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:theresidual  demand  curvefacing a given firm,  and using this to make statements about
47:2274:128725:17:17:79:511:432:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:firms’  price-setting  power.   Similar  arguments  apply  to  other  settings  in  which  firms  or
47:2275:128825:17:17:79:511:415:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:agents  have  preferences  that  are  assumed  to  be  linear  in  some  quantity  measureq(p),
47:2276:128920:17:17:79:511:398:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:rather than a probabilityP(a)as in our setting.27Applying our approach to such settings
47:2277:129007:17:16:79:511:381:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:could allow for firms to potentially have incomplete information about competitors’ costs
47:2278:129096:16:17:79:511:365:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:without assuming a particular model of conduct by those firms.  This could be particularly
47:2279:129186:17:17:79:511:348:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:useful given that Sweeting, Tao, and Yao (2018) point out that small amounts of asymmetric
47:2280:129276:17:17:79:511:331:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:information in oligopoly pricing can have big effects on prices, and price setting in such cases
47:2281:129372:17:20:79:394:314:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:may look similar to collusion if incomplete information is ignored.
47:2282:129439:20:17:91:511:294:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Related arguments also apply to settings in which agents maximize affine functions of
47:2283:129524:17:17:79:511:277:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:more than two outcomes.  Agarwal and Somaini (2018) analyze school choice problems, in
47:2284:129610:17:17:79:511:260:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:which applicants’ utilities for submitting a given report are affine functions of probabilities
47:2285:129705:17:17:79:511:243:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of admission to different schools, and uses this to derive identification and estimation argu-
47:2286:129799:17:17:79:511:226:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ments.  Gentry, Komarova, and Schiraldi (2014) use similar arguments to analyze bidding
47:2287:129886:17:16:79:511:209:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:in combinatorial auctions for highway procurement.  While our nonparametric estimation
47:2288:129972:16:17:79:511:193:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:is specialized to the case of two outcomes,  menus are also convex in settings with multi-
47:2289:130062:17:17:79:511:176:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:ple goods,  and similar approaches to ours can be applied in such settings.  For example,
47:2290:130151:17:17:79:511:159:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:Agarwal and Somaini (2018) show that solving for agents’ values for any preference report
47:2291:130240:17:26:79:511:142:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:requires satisfying a set of revealed-preference inequalities that define the subgradient set
47:2292:130333:26:14:79:511:116:8:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f11:27For example, consider a monopolist pricing problem, where the monopolist chooses pricepto maximize
47:2293:130433:14:15:79:511:102:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f11:pq(p)−cq(p), wherecis the (potentially privately known) marginal cost andq(p)is demand.  Defining
47:2294:130530:15:0:79:412:87:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f11:T(p)=pQ(p),  we  can  write  monopolist  profit  asT(p)−cq(p)and  obtaincas
47:2295:130605:0:10:419:428:95:5:g_d0_f30:5:g_d0_f30:dTdp
47:2296:130609:10:14:419:510:85:5:g_d0_f30:9:g_d0_f11:dqdp=c,  which  can  be
47:2297:130632:14:0:79:390:71:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:re-written to obtain the standard monopolist pricing formulac=p+qp′(q).
48:2298:130721:0:17:79:511:688:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:of a multidimensional convex function; this is a linear programming problem, so it is fairly
48:2299:130813:17:27:79:273:671:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:straightforward even in high dimensions.

48:2301:130943:17:17:79:511:627:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:here is exactly the canonical model of classical mechanism design, as pioneered by Myerson
48:2302:131033:17:17:79:511:610:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:(1981),  and  many  parallels  can  be  drawn  between  our  results  and  this  literature.   Simi-
48:2303:131133:17:16:79:511:593:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:larly to the mechanism design literature, our incentive compatibility constraints in (1) rely
48:2304:131226:16:17:79:511:577:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:only  on  the  quasilinear-utility  setup,  and  are  independent  of  the  particular  game  being
48:2305:131325:17:17:79:511:560:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:played.  Indeed, one interpretation of our results from the perspective of mechanism design
48:2306:131416:17:17:79:511:543:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:is that equilibria of arbitrary trading games can alternatively be thought of as revelation

48:2316:132212:27:17:91:511:352:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:This  paper  provides  a  two-step  identification  argument,  based  on  intuitions  from  the
48:2317:132307:17:17:79:511:335:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:theoretical mechanism design literature, for general incomplete information trading games,
48:2318:132397:17:17:79:511:318:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:generalizing a number of game-specific approaches in the literature.  We propose an method
48:2319:132487:17:17:79:511:301:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:to deal with imperfectly observed actions, derive general estimation procedures, and extend

48:2321:132667:16:17:79:511:268:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f5:general trading games.  We believe our results may be useful in a number of incomplete-
