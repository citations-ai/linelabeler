3:57:4380:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:This paper estimates the long-term benefits from an influential early childhood program targeting 
3:58:4478:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:disadvantaged families.  The  program  was  evaluated  by  random  assignment  and  followed 
3:59:4570:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:participants  through  their mid-30s.  It  has  substantial  beneficial  impacts  on  health,  children's 
3:60:4675:14:14:72:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:future  labor  incomes,  crime,  education, and  mothers'  labor  incomes,  with  greater  monetized 
3:61:4775:14:14:71:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:benefits  for  males.  Lifetime  returns  are  estimated by  pooling  multiple  data  sets  using  testable 
3:62:4882:14:14:71:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:economic models. The overall rate of return is 13.7% per annum, and the benefit/cost ratio is 7.3. 
3:63:4980:14:28:71:360:504:12:Times:12:Times:These estimates are robust to numerous sensitivity analyses.

4:95:5861:24:24:108:504:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:has substantial impacts on the lives of its participants.  Monetizing benefits
4:96:5939:24:24:108:504:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and costs across multiple domains, we estimate a rate of return of 13.7% per
4:97:6015:24:24:108:504:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:annum and a benefit/cost ratio of 7.3.  There are substantial differences across
4:98:6095:24:24:108:227:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:genders favoring males.
4:99:6118:24:24:129:503:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our analysis contributes to a growing literature on the value of early-life
4:100:6193:24:24:108:503:504:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:programs for disadvantaged children.1Long-term evidence on their effective-
4:101:6268:24:24:108:504:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ness is surprisingly limited.2For want of follow-up data, many studies of early
4:102:6347:24:24:107:503:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:childhood programs report few outcomes for early ages after program comple-
4:103:6422:24:23:107:504:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tion, e.g.  IQ scores, school readiness measures.3Yet it is the long-term returns
4:104:6503:23:24:107:292:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that are relevant for policy analysis.
4:105:6541:24:24:129:503:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We analyze the costs and benefits from two virtually identical early child-
4:106:6616:24:24:107:503:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:hood programs evaluated by randomized trials conducted in North Carolina.
4:107:6689:24:24:107:503:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The programs are the Carolina Abecedarian Project (ABC) and the Carolina

4:109:6826:24:24:107:503:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:were  launched  in  the  1970s  and  have  long-term  follow-ups  through  the  mid
4:110:6909:24:24:107:503:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:30’s.  The programs started early (at 8 weeks of life) and engaged participants
4:111:6988:24:24:107:503:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to age 5.  We analyze their impacts on a variety of life outcomes such as health,
4:112:7069:24:18:107:503:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the quality of life,4participation in crime,  labor income,  IQ, schooling,  and

4:114:7200:11:16:124:504:188:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:2The major source of evidence is from the Perry Preschool Program (see Schweinhart

4:118:7542:12:8:108:384:136:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:2013).  IHDP was inspired by ABC/CARE (Gross et al., 1997).

5:122:7831:24:24:129:503:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Evidence  from  these  programs  is  relevant  for  contemporary  policy  dis-
5:123:7909:24:24:108:504:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cussions  because  their  main  components  are  present  in  a  variety  of  current
5:124:7994:24:24:108:503:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:interventions.6About  19%  of  all  African-American  children  are  eligible  for
5:125:8076:24:24:108:224:576:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:these programs today.7

6:155:10302:0:24:129:503:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A  fundamental  problem  in  evaluating  any  intervention  is  assessing  out-
6:156:10381:24:24:108:504:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of-sample future costs and benefits.  Solutions to this problem are based on
6:157:10457:24:24:108:504:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:versions of a synthetic cohort approach using the outcomes of older cohorts who
6:158:10536:24:24:108:504:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:did not have access to the program and are otherwise comparable to treated
6:159:10610:24:24:108:503:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and control persons to proxy future treatment effects.9Using this approach,
6:160:10685:24:24:108:504:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we  combine  experimental  data  through  the  mid  30’s  with  information  from
6:161:10766:24:24:108:504:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:multiple  auxiliary  panel  data  sources  to  predict  benefits  and  costs  over  the

6:163:10881:24:24:129:503:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our analysis is simplified by the fact that all eligible families offered partic-

6:167:11195:24:24:108:504:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:They show that program treatment effects are produced through changes in in-
6:168:11271:24:24:108:504:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:puts in a stable (across treatment regimes) production function for outcomes.
6:169:11348:24:24:108:504:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We use the estimated production function to make out-of-sample predictions
6:170:11422:24:24:108:300:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:based on inputs caused by treatment.

6:174:11694:12:12:108:504:232:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:gender.  For want of the data collected on health at the mid 30’s, they do not account for
6:175:11784:12:12:108:504:220:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:health  benefits.   They  use  self-reported  crime  data  (unlike  the  administrative  crime  data
6:176:11884:12:12:108:504:208:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:later collected that we analyze) and ignore the welfare costs of financing the program.  We
6:177:11975:12:9:108:360:196:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:use cost data from primary sources not available to them.
6:178:12032:9:15:124:504:187:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:9Mincer (1974) addresses this problem using a synthetic cohort approach and provides
6:179:12116:15:12:108:504:172:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:evidence on its validity.  See the discussion of the synthetic cohort approach in Heckman

6:182:12305:16:12:108:504:136:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:These methods are related to the older “surrogate marker” literature in biostatistics (see

7:186:12571:24:24:108:504:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ing blocks of outcomes is of interest in its own right as a template for evaluating
7:187:12654:24:24:108:504:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:other programs with numerous long-run outcomes using intermediate outcome

7:189:12736:24:24:129:504:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our analysis accounts for control group substitution.11Roughly 75% of

7:191:12880:24:24:108:504:504:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:alternative childcare outside of the home.12We define and estimate parameters
7:192:12957:24:24:108:455:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:accounting for the choices taken by the control groups in our study.

7:200:13533:24:24:108:504:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:savings from life-cycle medical costs and from improvements in the quality of
7:201:13610:24:24:108:503:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:life.14There are benefits for participants in terms of reduced crime, gains in
7:202:13688:24:24:108:504:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:life-cycle labor income, reduced special education costs and enhanced educa-

8:215:14646:24:24:108:503:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:substantial, as has frequently been noted by critics.16But so are the benefits,
8:216:14725:24:24:107:256:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:which far outweigh the costs.

8:227:15516:24:24:107:503:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:vectors of treatment effects.  We use combining functions that summarize the

8:234:16068:12:12:108:504:148:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:7%, the estimates for the benefit-cost ratios are 17.40 (s.e.  5.90), 7.33 (s.e.  1.84), and 2.91

11:247:20521:31:24:108:504:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ABC/CARE  targeted  disadvantaged,  predominately  African-American  chil-
11:248:20595:24:24:108:504:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dren  in  Chapel  Hill/Durham,  North  Carolina.17Table  2  compares  the  two
11:249:20673:24:24:108:504:374:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:virtually identical programs.  Appendix A describes these programs in detail.
11:250:20750:24:24:108:315:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Here, we summarize their main features.
11:251:20789:24:24:129:503:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The goal of these programs was to enhance the early-life skills of disad-
11:252:20862:24:24:108:504:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:vantaged children.  Both programs supported language, motor, and cognitive
11:253:20936:24:24:108:504:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:development  as  well  as  socio-emotional  competencies  considered  crucial  for
11:254:21018:24:24:108:504:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:school  success  including  task-orientation,  ability  to  communicate,  indepen-
11:255:21100:24:24:108:274:230:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:dence, and pro-social behavior.18
11:256:21133:24:23:129:506:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The programs individualized treatment. Each child’s progress was recorded
11:257:21206:23:24:107:503:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and learning activities were appropriately adjusted every 2 to 3 weeks.  En-
11:258:21282:24:18:107:503:159:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:vironments  were  organized  to  promote  pre-literacy  and  provide  access  to  a
11:259:21365:18:16:120:504:141:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:17Both  ABC  and  CARE  were  designed  and  implemented  by  researchers  at  the  Frank

12:262:21614:0:24:108:504:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rich set of learning tools.19The curriculum emphasized active learning experi-
12:263:21692:24:24:107:503:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ences, dramatic play, and basic concepts of order and category (“pre-academic
12:264:21769:24:24:107:503:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:skills”), as well as discipline and the ability to interact with and respect oth-
12:265:21850:24:24:107:503:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ers.  At later ages (3 through 5), the program focused on the development of
12:266:21926:24:24:107:372:576:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:“socio-linguistic and communicative competence.”20
12:267:21976:24:24:129:503:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ABC  recruited  four  cohorts  of  children  born  between  1972  and  1976.
12:268:22052:24:24:107:503:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:CARE recruited two cohorts of children, born between 1978 and 1980.  The
12:269:22124:24:24:107:503:504:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:recruitment processes for each study were identical.  Potential participant fam-
12:270:22204:24:24:107:503:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ilies were referred to researchers by local social service agencies and hospitals
12:271:22285:24:24:107:503:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:at the beginning of the mother’s last trimester of pregnancy.  Eligibility was
12:272:22363:24:23:107:365:432:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:determined by a score on a childhood risk index.21
12:273:22413:23:24:129:503:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:As shown in Table 2, the design and implementation of ABC and CARE
12:274:22479:24:24:107:503:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:were very similar.  ABC had two phases, the first of which lasted from birth
12:275:22555:24:24:107:503:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:until age 5.  In this phase, children were randomly assigned to treatment.  The
12:276:22634:24:24:107:503:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:second phase of the study consisted of child academic support through home
12:277:22708:24:24:107:503:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:visits from ages 5 through 8.  CARE consisted of two treatment phases as well
12:278:22785:24:18:107:503:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that were very similar to ABC. The first phase of CARE from birth until age

12:280:22948:15:12:108:504:256:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:in 1:1 child-adult interactions.  Each “LearningGames” activity states a developmentally-

13:292:23932:0:24:108:504:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:5, had an additional treatment arm of home visits designed to improve home
13:293:24006:24:24:108:503:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:environments.22Participation in the second phase was randomized in ABC,
13:294:24077:24:24:108:201:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:but not in CARE.
13:295:24093:24:24:129:503:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our  analysis  is  based  on  the  first  phase  and  pools  the  CARE  treat-
13:296:24171:24:24:108:504:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ment  group  with  the  ABC  treatment  group.   The  second-phase  treatment
13:297:24248:24:24:108:504:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of ABC/CARE had little impact on participants (for evidence, see Campbell
13:298:24321:24:24:108:504:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:et  al.,  2014  and  Garc ́ıa  et  al.,  2016).   Campbell  et  al.  (2014)  establish  the
13:299:24412:24:24:108:504:504:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:validity of pooling the data on second phase treatments and controls with the
13:300:24489:24:24:108:251:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:first phase controls in ABC.
13:301:24517:24:24:129:503:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We do not use the data on the CARE group that only received home visits
13:302:24588:24:23:108:504:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in the early years.  Campbell et al. (2014) and Garc ́ıa et al. (2016) show that
13:303:24668:23:24:108:411:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:there is no statistically significant effect of this component.
13:304:24731:24:24:129:503:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:For the treatment phase that we analyze, the center received the treated
13:305:24803:24:24:108:504:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:children from 7:45 a.m.  to 5:30 p.m, five days a week and fifty weeks a year.  As
13:306:24885:24:24:108:504:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we argue below, in practice the center had a very relevant childcare component
13:307:24963:24:24:108:330:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that caused gains in parental labor income.
13:308:25006:24:24:129:503:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:For  both  programs,  from  birth  until  the  age  of  8,  data  were  collected
13:309:25087:24:24:108:504:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:annually on cognitive and socio-emotional skills, home environments, family

13:312:25327:24:24:108:503:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:were  collected  at  ages  12,  15,  21,  and  30.23In  addition,  we  have  access  to

15:366:27980:31:24:108:504:594:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Randomization  for  ABC/CARE  was  conducted  on  child  pairs  matched  on
15:367:28055:24:24:108:504:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:family  background.   Siblings  and  twins  were  jointly  randomized  into  either

15:372:28444:24:24:107:503:450:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:robust when we adjust for missing data using standard methods, described in

15:375:28668:24:24:107:503:378:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:balanced and are primarily related to the health of the child and mobility of
15:376:28745:24:17:107:385:354:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:families and not to dissatisfaction with the program.27

15:380:29071:12:12:108:504:297:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:which there is substantial attrition.  Further, the methodology we propose addresses missing
15:381:29163:12:8:108:312:285:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:data in either of these two outcome categories.
15:382:29210:8:16:120:504:277:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:25For siblings, this occurred when two siblings were close enough in age such that both
15:383:29297:16:8:108:273:261:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:of them were eligible for the program.
15:384:29335:8:12:120:281:253:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:26We do not know the original pairs.
15:385:29371:12:16:120:504:241:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:27The 22 dropouts include four children who died, four children who left the study be-

16:397:30223:24:24:108:504:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:enrolled.  As control children age, they are more likely to enter childcare (see
16:398:30303:24:24:108:187:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Appendix A.5).

16:401:30473:24:24:108:504:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:children who stay at home.  Disadvantage is measured by maternal education,

16:404:30698:24:24:108:503:320:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:they are children of mothers who are more likely to be working at baseline.29

18:428:32851:24:24:108:503:391:12:g_d0_f19:12:g_d0_f3:W= 1 indicates that the parents referred to the program participate in the
18:429:32925:24:24:108:504:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:randomization protocol,W= 0 indicates otherwise.Rindicates randomiza-

18:435:33348:24:24:108:504:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:determines  program  eligibility.   As  it  turns  out,  in  the  ABC/CARE  study,
18:436:33430:24:24:108:504:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:all  of  the  eligible  persons  given  the  option  to  participate  choose  to  do  so
18:437:33518:24:24:108:504:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(W= 1, andD=R).  There are very few dropouts.Ex  ante,  parents per-
18:438:33586:24:17:108:504:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ceived that ABC/CARE was superior to other childcare alternatives.  Thus,
18:439:33659:17:16:120:504:135:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:32When we compare ABC/CARE treatment to these alternatives, ABC/CARE has sub-
18:440:33736:16:11:108:504:119:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:stantial treatment effects.  Further, as we argue below, parents perceived that ABC/CARE
18:441:33824:11:0:108:248:108:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:was superior to the alternatives.
19:442:33859:0:24:108:504:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we can safely interpret the treatment effects generated by the experiment as

19:447:34199:24:24:108:504:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:treatments and controls can depend on the exposures to various alternatives
19:448:34274:24:24:108:504:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:at  each  age.   It  would  be  desirable  to  estimate  treatment  effects  for  each
19:449:34360:24:24:108:504:504:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:possible exposure but our samples are too small to make credible estimates for
19:450:34438:24:24:108:231:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:very detailed exposures.
19:451:34462:24:24:129:503:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:All  treatment  group  children  have  the  same  exposure.   We  simplify  the
19:452:34541:24:23:108:504:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:analysis  of  the  controls  by  creating  two  categories.   “H”  indicates  that  the
19:453:34628:23:24:108:504:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:control  child  is  in  home  care  throughout  the  entire  length  of  the  program.
19:454:34714:24:24:108:504:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:“C” indicates that the control child is in alternative childcare for any amount
19:455:34793:24:24:107:504:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of time.34We test the sensitivity of our estimates to the choice of different
19:456:34870:24:24:108:397:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:categorizations in our empirical analysis in Appendix H.
19:457:34926:24:18:129:503:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We thus compress a complex reality into two counterfactual outcome states
19:458:34999:18:15:120:504:295:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:33All  providers  of  health  care  and  social  services  (referral  agencies)  in  the  area  of  the
19:459:35102:15:12:108:504:280:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:ABC/CARE  study  were  informed  of  the  programs.   They  referred  mothers  whom  they
19:460:35191:12:12:108:504:268:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:considered disadvantaged.  Eligibility was corroborated before randomization.  Our conver-
19:461:35281:12:12:108:504:256:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:sations with the program staff indicate that the encouragement from the referral agencies
19:462:35370:12:12:108:504:244:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:was such that most referred mothers attended and agreed to participate in the initial ran-

19:464:35492:9:15:120:504:223:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:34This  assumption  is  consistent  with  Figure  2b.   Once  parents  decide  to  enroll  their

23:584:41333:16:12:108:504:176:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:out of the set of outcomes within a block and perform inference on this latent.  The results
23:585:41425:12:8:108:373:164:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:point to beneficial effects of the program in this case as well.
23:586:41489:8:15:120:504:156:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:43Appendix  G  reports  treatment  effects  and  step-downp-values  for  all  the  outcomes
23:587:41580:15:12:108:504:141:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:analyzed.  These account for multiple hypothesis testing as in Lehmann and Romano (2005)

24:590:41726:0:24:108:504:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sample permutation-based inference closely agree when applied to ABC/CARE
24:591:41799:24:47:108:501:648:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:data.  For this reason, we use large sample inference throughout this paper.45

24:593:41911:31:24:108:504:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Tables  3  and  4  present  the  following  estimates,  for  males  and  females  re-

24:595:42078:24:24:108:504:522:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:treatment and control groups.  Column (2) adjusts the differences for attrition
24:596:42157:24:24:108:504:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and controls for background variables.  Both are estimates of the parameter
24:597:42232:24:24:108:504:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:defined in equation (2).  Column (3) shows the mean difference between the
24:598:42306:24:24:108:504:450:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:full  treatment-group  and  the  control-group  children  who  did  not  attend  al-
24:599:42390:24:24:108:504:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ternatives.  Column (4) gives standard matching estimates for the parameter
24:600:42465:24:24:108:504:402:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:defined in equation (3).46Column (5) gives mean differences between the full

24:603:42683:23:24:129:503:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The results for females show that ABC/CARE has substantial effects on
24:604:42752:24:24:108:504:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:education when comparing treatment outcomes to those from the next best
24:605:42823:24:24:108:504:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:alternative.   High  school  graduation  increases  between  13  and  25  percent-

24:607:42989:24:24:108:504:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:increases  13  percentage  points;  and  the  average  years  of  schooling  increase

24:611:43314:16:8:108:218:153:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:paper, see Appendix C.8.
24:612:43338:8:16:120:504:145:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:46In Appendix G.1.1, we provide details on:  (i) the kernel matching estimator that we
24:613:43424:16:12:108:504:129:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:use; (ii) the matching variables that we use; and (iii) a sensitivity analysis to these matching

25:615:43532:0:24:108:504:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tal accumulation and employment.  The results strengthen when we compare
25:616:43604:24:24:108:366:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:treatment with the alternative of staying at home.
25:617:43654:24:24:129:503:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The results for males are somewhat different from those for females. Treat-

25:619:43812:24:24:108:504:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:effects are positive for a variety of health indicators, including drug use and
25:620:43891:24:24:108:504:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:hypertension.  The effects on employment and labor income are also substan-
25:621:43966:24:24:108:504:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tial.  The increase in employment at age 30 ranges from 11 to 19 percentage
25:622:44041:24:24:108:504:504:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:points.  Labor income at age 30 increases between 19 and 24 thousand of 2014
25:623:44117:24:24:108:504:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:USD  after  treatment.   The  effects  strengthen  when  comparing  treatment  to
25:624:44198:24:24:108:504:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:alternative  preschool.   Separation  from  the  mother  and  being  placed  in  rel-
25:625:44283:24:23:108:504:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:atively  low  quality  childcare  centers  have  more  deleterious  consequences  for
25:626:44368:23:24:108:234:409:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:males than for females.47
25:627:44393:24:24:129:503:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The results hold using alternative definitions of control substitution (see
25:628:44468:24:24:108:504:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Appendix H). They remain statistically significant or are borderline statisti-
25:629:44546:24:24:108:482:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cally insignificant when computing two-tailedp-values (see Appendix H).

25:631:44691:24:24:107:503:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are not based on matching; the estimates in (4) and (6) are.  For the matching
25:632:44769:24:24:107:503:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:estimates,  we  rely  on  observed,  baseline  characteristics.   In  Appendix  G.1,
25:633:44853:24:24:107:503:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we explain our choice of these variables and we make a thorough analysis to
25:634:44928:24:18:107:475:217:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:conclude that there is little sensitivity to the choice of these variables.48
25:635:45005:18:15:120:504:199:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:47This is consistent with the evidence in Baker et al. (2015) and Kottelenberg and Lehrer
25:636:45094:15:8:108:138:184:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:(2014).
25:637:45101:8:16:120:504:176:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:48We also present this sensitivity analysis changing the variables used to condition while

28:642:50689:24:24:108:504:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:overall.49The analysis is based on treatment effect (2).  Figure 3 displays the
28:643:50768:24:24:108:504:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:results from this analysis: ABC/CARE positively impacted a large percentage
28:644:50843:24:24:108:504:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the outcomes.  We show the counts for treatment compared to the next best
28:645:50919:24:23:108:504:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:alternative chosen by parents in Figure 3a.  Proportionately more outcomes
28:646:50993:23:24:108:504:512:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are beneficial for females,  but the proportions are high for both groups and
28:647:51070:24:24:108:504:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:well  above  the  benchmark  of  1/2.   In  Tables  G.4  to  G.12  of  Appendix  G,
28:648:51153:24:24:108:504:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we document a large and precisely determined fraction of beneficial treatment
28:649:51230:24:24:108:504:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:effects well above one half for both genders for categories of outcomes spanning
28:650:51310:24:24:108:287:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the life cycle through the mid 30’s.
28:651:51346:24:24:129:504:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Using anα-level of significance, one would expect to find thatα% of the
28:652:51417:24:24:108:504:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:treatment effects are “statistically significant,” even if the null hypothesis of no
28:653:51501:24:24:108:504:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:effect of the program is true simply by chance.  At a 10% level of significance,
28:654:51581:24:24:108:504:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:46% are statistically significant for females and 28% for males (see Figure 3b).
28:655:51661:24:24:129:503:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Figures 3c and Figure 3d adjust the count in Figure 3a to analyze more

28:657:51806:23:24:108:504:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:treatment compared to alternative preschool.  These comparisons indicate that
28:658:51883:24:24:108:504:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:girls and boys benefit differently from alternatives to high quality treatment.
28:659:51962:24:24:108:504:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Compared across all categories, girls benefit more from treatment when com-

29:674:52991:24:24:107:503:378:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:treatment on outcomes operates through its effects on inputs in a stable pro-

32:695:58807:24:23:129:503:396:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Making valid predictions of out-of-sample treatment effects does not re-

32:698:59023:24:18:129:503:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Nonetheless,  in this paper we focus on making valid predictions of sep-
32:699:59095:18:16:120:504:307:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:51We do not monetize the loss of leisure and household production that individuals suffer
32:700:59184:16:12:108:504:291:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:from working more (this applies both to the individuals in the program and to their parents).
32:701:59277:12:12:108:504:279:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:The reasons for this are two-fold:  (i) we lack information on intensive-margin labor supply;
32:702:59370:12:12:108:504:267:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:and (ii) different labor supply models have different implications with respect to leisure-time
32:703:59465:12:11:108:504:255:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:allocations.  In addition, our data are not well-suited for estimating a structural model.  We
32:704:59559:11:12:108:504:244:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:note, however, that the benefit-cost ratio and internal rate of return are both statistically and
32:705:59656:12:12:108:504:232:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:substantially significant after removing labor income entirely (see Table 9).  This exercise
32:706:59748:12:12:108:504:220:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:corresponds  to  a  one-to-one  loss  of  leisure  given  the  gain  in  labor  income,  i.e.   for  each
32:707:59853:12:12:108:504:208:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:additional dollar an individual makes, she loses the same dollar of (monetized) leisure and
32:708:59944:12:9:108:205:196:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:household production.
32:709:59965:9:15:120:504:187:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:52Our calculations are based on labor income gross of tax, because we want to quantify
32:710:60051:15:12:108:504:172:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the effects of the program on the gross output that an individual is able to produce.  A rise in
32:711:60147:12:12:108:504:160:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:gross labor income increases the taxable base and has an implied increase in deadweight loss.
32:712:60240:12:12:108:504:148:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:We do not quantify that deadweight loss because:  (i) we do not have enough information
32:713:60327:12:12:108:504:136:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:to  make  full  use  of  standard  tax  simulators;  and  (ii)  we  are  not  able  to  manipulate  the
32:714:60430:12:0:108:356:124:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:standard tax simulators to assess estimation uncertainty.

33:716:60565:24:24:108:504:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:validity of our methodology by comparing (within the support of the experi-
33:717:60640:24:24:108:504:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mental sample) outcomes by treatment status for the experimental control and
33:718:60716:24:24:108:504:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:treatment groups with those from the synthetic control and treatment groups
33:719:60791:24:24:108:504:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we  generate.   Comparisons  between  the  experimental  control  group  and  the
33:720:60872:24:24:108:504:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:synthetic control group are particularly compelling.  By design, neither group
33:721:60950:24:24:108:504:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:receives treatment.  In our data, all persons offered treatment accept it, so it
33:722:61030:24:24:108:504:504:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is straightforward to construct synthetic control groups in auxiliary samples
33:723:61107:24:24:108:255:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:using only eligibility criteria.
33:724:61139:24:24:129:503:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:There  are  two  distinct  stages  in  our  analysis.   In  Stage  I,  we  construct
33:725:61223:24:23:108:504:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:samples of comparison group members in the auxiliary samples with the same
33:726:61297:23:24:108:504:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:or similar characteristics as the experimental group members.  The minimal
33:727:61371:24:24:108:504:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:set  of  characteristics  includes  the  background  variablesB∈ B0.   We  use  a
33:728:61452:24:24:108:504:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:coarse form of matching based on Algorithm 1 in Appendix C.3.3.  In Stage II,
33:729:61529:24:24:108:504:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we build models in these samples to predict out-of-sample outcomes separately
33:730:61606:24:24:108:358:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for the outcomes of the treated and the controls.
33:731:61655:24:24:129:503:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Specifically, we adopt a three-step procedure.  In Step 1, we use the exper-
33:732:61731:24:24:108:504:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:imental sample to conduct mediation analyses relating the vector of outcomes

33:734:61881:24:24:108:503:217:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:that are affected by treatment (Xdi,a), as well as background variables (Bi).53
33:735:61960:24:24:108:504:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:It turns out that we accurately predict within-sample treatment effects as well
33:736:62039:24:23:108:504:169:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:as levels of treatment and control profiles using this approach.  In Step 2, we
33:737:62118:23:18:108:504:146:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:construct counterpart predictions of treatment and control outcomes using the
33:738:62195:18:0:120:455:128:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:53To avoid notational clutter, we henceforth suppress individualisubscripts.
34:739:62273:0:24:108:504:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:auxiliary samples.  We compare these constructed counterparts to the actual
34:740:62348:24:24:108:504:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:samples for agesa≤a∗.  In Step 3, we use the estimated dynamic relationships
34:741:62424:24:24:108:431:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fit on the constructed samples to predict the post-a∗outcomes.
34:742:62486:24:24:129:503:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Under exogeneity of the predictor variables and structural invariance (de-
34:743:62560:24:24:108:504:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fined below), the two stages can be compressed into a single, one-stage, non-
34:744:62637:24:24:108:503:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:parametric  matching  procedure.54In  Appendix  C.3.4.1  we  compare  the  es-
34:745:62715:24:24:107:503:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:timates  from  matching  with  those  from  our  main  approach.   We  find  close
34:746:62797:24:24:107:503:504:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:agreement between the two approaches (see Appendix C.3.4.1) and for different

34:748:62950:24:24:129:503:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Figure 4 previews the outputs from our approach, displaying the life-cycle
34:749:63024:24:23:107:503:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:labor income profiles for the treatment and control groups.  It also compares
34:750:63101:23:24:107:503:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the realized labor income to the model-predicted labor income ata∗.  There
34:751:63175:24:24:108:504:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is close agreement of the constructed profiles within sample.  The pattern of

34:758:63640:24:24:108:504:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:treatment group members, we can evaluate our procedure by comparing the

46:1037:80324:24:24:107:503:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:For example, creating mean difference counterfactuals only requires exogeneity
46:1038:80402:24:24:107:503:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and structural invariance in mean differences, and not in individual level equa-
46:1039:80482:24:24:107:503:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tions.  However, the conditions stated for level equations by treatment status
46:1040:80560:24:24:107:503:384:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:have the advantage of being testable on certain subsamples of the data.  They
46:1041:80637:24:24:107:503:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:also justify matching to make valid predictions.  Appendix C.6 reports esti-
46:1042:80713:24:24:107:503:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mates from a variety of alternative approaches accounting for serial correlation
46:1043:80793:24:46:107:357:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in the errors and from non-parametric matching.
46:1044:80840:46:32:107:385:266:14:g_d0_f14:14:g_d0_f14:5.3    Predicting Parental Labor Income
46:1045:80879:32:24:107:503:234:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ABC/CARE offers childcare to the parents of treated children for more than
46:1046:80953:24:23:107:503:210:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nine hours a day for five years, 50 weeks a year.  Only 27% of mothers of chil-
46:1047:81032:23:24:107:503:187:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:dren reported living with a partner at baseline and this status barely changed
46:1048:81110:24:24:107:503:163:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:during the course of the experiment (see Appendix A). The childcare compo-
46:1049:81184:24:24:107:503:139:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nent generates the treatment effects in maternal labor force participation and
46:1050:81262:24:0:107:451:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:parental labor income reported in Tables 3 and 4 and Appendix G.
47:1051:81328:0:24:129:503:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We observe parental labor income at eight different times for the exper-
47:1052:81400:24:24:108:503:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:imental subjects up through age 21.63,64As Tables 3 and 4 show, treatment
47:1053:81473:24:24:108:504:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:effects on parental labor income are sustained through the child’s age 21.  This
47:1054:81553:24:24:108:504:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:presumably  arises  from  wage  growth  due  to  parental  attainment  of  further
47:1055:81635:24:24:108:504:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:education and/or more work experience.  An ideal approach would be to esti-
47:1056:81710:24:24:108:504:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mate the profile over the full life cycle of mothers.  We propose two different
47:1057:81789:24:24:108:504:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:approaches for doing this in Appendix C.3.8:  (i) an approach based on param-
47:1058:81866:24:24:108:504:504:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:eterizing parental labor income using standard Mincer equations; and (ii) an
47:1059:81942:24:24:108:504:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:approach based on the analysis of Section 5.2.  In Section 6, we present esti-
47:1060:82020:24:24:108:504:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mates using the labor income through age 21 and using these two alternatives
47:1061:82096:24:23:108:504:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for projecting future labor income after age 21.  The benefits of the program
47:1062:82173:23:24:108:504:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:increase when considering the full life cycles of mothers using either approach.
47:1063:82253:24:24:129:503:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Any childcare inducements of the program likely benefit parents who, at
47:1064:82324:24:24:108:504:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:baseline, did not have any other children. If they did, then they might have had
47:1065:82404:24:24:108:504:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to take care of other children anyway, weakening the childcare-driven effect,
47:1066:82481:24:24:108:504:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:especially if there are younger siblings present.  In Appendix C.3.8, we show
47:1067:82558:24:24:108:504:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that the treatment effect for discounted parental labor income is much higher
47:1068:82635:24:24:108:504:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:when there are no siblings of the participant children at baseline.  The effect
47:1069:82714:24:24:108:504:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:also weakens when comparing children who have siblings younger than 5 years
47:1070:82789:24:18:108:404:217:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:old to children who have siblings 5 years old or younger.65
47:1071:82848:18:15:120:504:199:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:63The ages at which parental labor income is observed are 0, 1.5, 3.5, 4.5, 8, 12, 15, and
47:1072:82938:15:8:108:429:184:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:21.  At age 21 the mothers in ABC/CARE were, on average, 41 years old.
47:1073:83008:8:16:120:504:176:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:64We linearly interpolate parental labor income for ages for which we do not have obser-
47:1074:83096:16:8:108:221:160:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:vations between 0 and 21.
47:1075:83121:8:16:120:504:152:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:65These patterns persist when splitting the ABC/CARE sample by gender, but the esti-
47:1076:83205:16:0:108:467:136:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:mates are not precise because the samples become too small.  See Appendix C.3.8.

48:1078:83300:32:24:108:504:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We predict and monetize health outcomes based on a version of Equation (7)
48:1079:83374:24:24:108:504:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:including  a  full  vector  of  lagged  dependent  variables  for  different  indicators
48:1080:83462:24:24:108:504:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of  health  status.   This  requires  adapting  the  models  of  Section  5.2.   Three
48:1081:83548:24:24:108:504:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:additional issues arise:  (i) health outcomes such as diabetes or heart disease
48:1082:83627:24:23:108:504:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are  absorbing  states;  (ii)  health  outcomes  are  highly  interdependent  within
48:1083:83711:23:24:108:504:512:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and across time periods; and (iii) there is no obvious terminal time period for
48:1084:83790:24:24:108:390:488:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:benefits and costs except death, which is endogenous.66
48:1085:83845:24:24:129:503:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our  auxiliary  model  for  health  is  an  adaptation  of  the  Future  America
48:1086:83925:24:24:108:504:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Model (FAM). This model predicts health outcomes from the subjects’ mid-
48:1087:83997:24:24:108:503:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:30s up to their projected age of death (Goldman et al., 2015).67Appendix F
48:1088:84071:24:24:108:322:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:discusses the FAM methodology in detail.
48:1089:84111:24:24:129:503:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In  Appendix  F,  we  present  tests  of  its  assumptions  and  its  predictive
48:1090:84191:24:24:108:504:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:performance for population aggregate health and healthy behavior outcomes.
48:1091:84265:24:24:108:504:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:FAM passes a variety of specification tests and accurately predicts health out-
48:1092:84344:24:24:108:504:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:comes and healthy behaviors.  We initialize the health prediction model using
48:1093:84421:24:23:108:504:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  same  variables  that  we  use  to  predict  labor  and  transfer  income,  along
48:1094:84507:23:24:108:381:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with the initial health conditions as listed in Table 6.
48:1095:84563:24:24:129:503:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our  methodology  has  five  steps:   (i)  estimate  age-by-age  health  state
48:1096:84641:24:24:108:504:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:transition  probabilities  using  the  Panel  Study  of  Income  Dynamics  (PSID);
48:1097:84723:24:24:108:504:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(ii)  match  these  transition  probabilities  to  the  ABC/CARE  subjects  based
48:1098:84804:24:18:108:504:153:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on  observed  characteristics;  (iii)  estimate  quality-adjusted  life  year  (QALY)
48:1099:84889:18:16:120:504:135:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:66For example, for income we extrapolate up to the retirement age of 67.  However, for
48:1100:84975:16:8:108:380:119:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:health, we need to predict an age of death for each individual.
48:1101:85038:8:0:120:495:111:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:67The simulation starts at the age in which we observe the subject’s age-30 follow-up.
49:1102:85126:0:24:108:504:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:models using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and the PSID;
49:1103:85196:24:24:108:504:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(iv) estimate medical cost models using the MEPS and the Medicare Current
49:1104:85269:24:24:108:504:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), allowing estimates to differ by health state and
49:1105:85344:24:24:108:504:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:observed characteristics; and (v) predict the medical expenditures and QALYs
49:1106:85420:24:24:108:440:576:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:that correspond to the simulated individual health trajectories.68
49:1107:85486:24:24:129:503:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our microsimulation model starts with health predictions for age 30, along
49:1108:85560:24:24:108:504:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with the information on observed characteristics available at this age. Restrict-

49:1110:85719:24:24:108:504:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:survey allows us to account for components that are important for predicting
49:1111:85795:24:24:108:504:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:health outcomes.  The models predict the probability of being in any of the
49:1112:85870:24:23:108:503:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:states in the horizontal axis of Table 6 at agea+ 1 based on the state at agea,
49:1113:85949:23:24:108:503:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:which is described by the vertical axis of the table.69Absorbing states are an
49:1114:86027:24:24:108:504:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:exception.  For example, heart disease at ageadoes not enter in the estimation
49:1115:86105:24:24:108:503:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of transitions for heart disease at agea+ 1 because it is an absorbing state:
49:1116:86182:24:24:108:484:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:once a person has heart disease, she carries it through the rest of her life.
49:1117:86259:24:24:129:503:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:At each age, once we obtain the transition probability for each health out-
49:1118:86334:24:24:108:504:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:come, we make a Monte-Carlo draw for each subject.  Thus, each simulation
49:1119:86407:24:24:108:504:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:depends  on  each  individual’s  health  history  and  on  their  particular  charac-
49:1120:86492:24:24:108:504:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:teristics.  For every simulated trajectory of health outcomes,  we predict the
49:1121:86570:24:24:108:504:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lifetime medical expenditure using the models estimated from the MEPS and
49:1122:86643:24:17:108:504:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the MCBS. We then obtain an estimate of the expected lifetime medical ex-
49:1123:86716:17:16:120:504:176:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:68As an intermediate step between (i) and (ii), we impute some of the variables used to
49:1124:86803:16:8:108:303:160:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:initialize the FAM models (see Appendix F).
49:1125:86846:8:16:120:504:152:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:69In practice, the predictions are based on two-year lags, due to data limitations in the
49:1126:86935:16:12:108:504:136:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:auxiliary sources we use to simulate the FAM. For example, if the individual is 30 (31) years
49:1127:87028:12:12:108:504:124:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:old in the age-30 interview, we simulate the trajectory of her health status at ages 30 (31),
49:1128:87121:12:0:108:339:112:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:32 (33), 34 (35), and so on until her projected death.

51:1130:88289:24:24:108:172:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:expenditure.
51:1131:88301:24:24:129:503:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The models estimated using MCBS represent medical costs in the years
51:1132:88369:24:24:108:504:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2007-2010.   The  MEPS  estimation  captures  costs  during  2008-2010.   To  ac-
51:1133:88450:24:24:108:504:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:count for real medical cost growth after 2010, we adjust each model’s predic-
51:1134:88527:24:26:108:355:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tion using the method described in Appendix F.

51:1146:88946:12:12:108:504:265:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:predictions are based on combining data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID),
51:1147:89033:12:12:108:504:253:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the Health Retirement Study, and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). For each
51:1148:89119:12:12:108:504:241:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:gender,  we display a comparison to disadvantaged males and females in the Panel Study
51:1149:89205:12:12:108:504:229:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:of Income Dynamics (PSID), where disadvantaged is defined as being Black and having 12

51:1151:89394:12:39:108:479:205:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:health conditions.  Standard errors are based on the empirical bootstrap distribution.
51:1152:89480:39:24:129:503:166:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The  same  procedure  is  applied  to  calculate  quality-adjusted  life  years

51:1155:89730:16:0:108:504:108:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:given the burden of disease.  Suppose we assign a value of $150,000 (2014 USD) to each
52:1156:89818:0:24:108:504:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Quality-of-Life (HRQoL) measure (EQ-5D), available in MEPS.71We then es-
52:1157:89890:24:24:108:284:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:timate this model using the PSID.
52:1158:89923:24:24:129:503:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We  estimate  three  models  of  medical  spending:   (i)  Medicare  spending
52:1159:90000:24:24:108:504:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(annual medical spending paid by parts A, B, and D of Medicare); (ii) out-of-
52:1160:90077:24:24:108:504:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:pocket spending (medical spending paid directly by the individual); and (iii) all
52:1161:90158:24:24:108:504:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:public spending other than Medicare.  Each medical spending model includes
52:1162:90232:24:24:108:504:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the variables we use to predict labor and transfer income, together with current
52:1163:90312:24:24:108:450:504:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:health, risk factors, and functional status as explanatory variables.
52:1164:90381:24:24:129:503:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We also calculate medical expenditure before age 30.  The ABC/CARE
52:1165:90447:24:24:108:504:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:interviews at ages 12, 15, 21 and 30 have information related to hospitaliza-
52:1166:90524:24:23:108:504:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tions at different ages and number of births before age 30.  We combine this
52:1167:90600:23:24:108:504:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:information  along  with  individual  and  family  demographic  variables  to  use
52:1168:90682:24:24:108:356:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:MEPS to predict medical spending for each age.
52:1169:90728:24:24:129:503:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:QALYs are crucial for our benefit-cost analysis because they monetize the
52:1170:90801:24:24:108:504:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:health of an individual at each age.  Figure 6 shows our estimation of QALYs
52:1171:90877:24:24:108:504:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:together  with  a  PSID  comparison,  in  an  exercise  analogous  to  that  used  to
52:1172:90962:24:21:108:503:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:produce Figure 4.72Although there is not a clear age-by-age treatment effect
52:1173:91038:21:12:108:503:268:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:year of life.  A QALY of $150,000 denotes a year of life in the absence of disease (perfect
52:1174:91129:12:12:107:504:256:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:health).   The  value  of  QALY  for  an  individual  in  a  given  year  is  smaller  than  $150,000
52:1175:91230:12:12:107:503:244:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:when there is positive burden of disease,  as worse health conditions imply lower QALYs.
52:1176:91318:12:12:107:503:232:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:When an individual dies, her QALY equals zero.  There are extreme combinations of disease
52:1177:91407:12:12:107:503:220:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:and disability  that may generate  negative QALYs,  although  this  is unusual.  Because  we
52:1178:91499:12:12:107:503:208:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:quantify  labor  income  in  addition  to  other  components,  this  value  corresponds  solely  to
52:1179:91598:12:12:107:503:196:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:monetizing the value of life net of what individuals produce in terms of economic output.
52:1180:91687:12:12:107:503:184:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:The  benefit-cost  ratio  and  internal  rate  of  return  remain  significant  after  removing  this
52:1181:91788:12:8:107:253:172:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:component entirely (see Table 9).
52:1182:91821:8:16:120:504:164:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:71For  a  definition  and  explanation  of  this  instrument,  see  Dolan  (1997);  Shaw  et  al.
52:1183:91918:16:8:107:137:148:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:(2005).
52:1184:91925:8:16:120:504:140:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:72In our baseline estimation, we assume that each year of life is worth $150,000 (2014
52:1185:92011:16:12:107:503:124:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:USD). Our estimates are robust to substantial variation in this assumption, as we show in
52:1186:92100:12:0:107:159:112:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Appendix I.
53:1187:92113:0:24:108:504:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on QALYs,  there is a statistically and substantively significant difference in
53:1188:92192:24:24:108:504:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the accumulated present value of the QALYs between the treatment and the
53:1189:92264:24:24:108:504:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:control  groups.   The  QALYs  for  individuals  in  the  control  group  match  the
53:1190:92348:24:46:108:371:600:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:QALYs of disadvantaged individuals in the PSID.73

53:1193:92484:24:23:108:504:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nal activity, we use rich data on crime outcomes obtained from public police
53:1194:92560:23:24:108:503:475:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:records.74See Appendix E for a more complete discussion.  We consider the
53:1195:92633:24:24:108:504:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:following  types  of  crime:   arson,  assault,  burglary,  fraud,  larceny,  miscella-
53:1196:92720:24:24:108:504:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:neous (which includes traffic and non-violent drug crimes which can lead to
53:1197:92795:24:24:108:504:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:incarceration),  murder,  vehicle theft,  rape,  robbery,  and vandalism.  We use
53:1198:92876:24:24:108:504:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:administrative data that document:  (i) youth arrests, gathered at the age-21
53:1199:92953:24:24:108:504:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:follow-up; (ii) adult arrests, gathered at the mid-30’s follow-up; and (iii) sen-
53:1200:93034:24:24:108:504:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tences, gathered at the mid-30’s follow-up.  We also use self-reported data on
53:1201:93112:24:24:108:504:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:adult crimes, gathered in the age-21 and age-30 subject interviews.  Because
53:1202:93188:24:24:108:504:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:none of these sources capture all criminal activity, it is necessary to combine
53:1203:93267:24:24:108:504:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:them to more completely approximate the crimes the subjects committed.  We
53:1204:93341:24:23:108:504:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:also use several auxiliary datasets to complete the life-cycle profile of criminal
53:1205:93423:23:17:108:398:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:activity and compute the costs of the committed crimes.
53:1206:93478:17:16:120:504:195:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:73In Appendix F we further discuss and justify the parameterizations required to obtain
53:1207:93565:16:12:108:504:179:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:estimates of QALYs.  Tysinger et al. (2015) examine the sensitivity to these parameteriza-
53:1208:93655:12:8:108:440:167:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:tions and discuss alternative micro-simulations monetizing health condition.
53:1209:93731:8:16:120:504:159:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:74Two  previous  studies  consider  the  impacts  of  ABC  on  crime:  Clarke  and  Campbell
53:1210:93823:16:12:108:504:143:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:(1998) use administrative crime records up to age 21,  and find no statistically significant
53:1211:93915:12:12:108:504:131:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:differences between the treatment and the control groups.  Barnett and Masse (2002, 2007)
53:1212:94004:12:12:108:504:119:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:account for self-reported crime at age 21.  They find weak effects, but they lack access to
53:1213:94095:12:0:108:253:107:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:longer term, administrative data.
54:1214:94130:0:33:129:391:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We follow four steps to estimate the costs of crime.
54:1215:94182:33:24:122:503:639:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:1.Count arrests and sentences.We start by counting the total number of
54:1216:94252:24:24:137:504:615:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sentences for each individual and type of crime (arson, assault, etc.)  up
54:1217:94326:24:24:137:504:591:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to the mid 30’s, matching crimes across data sources, to construct the
54:1218:94396:24:24:137:504:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:total number of arrests for each individual and type of crime up to the
54:1219:94467:24:24:137:503:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:mid 30’s.75For individuals missing arrest data,76we impute the number
54:1220:94536:24:24:137:504:519:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of arrests by multiplying the number of sentences for each type of crime
54:1221:94608:24:32:137:448:495:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:by a national arrest-sentence ratio for the respective crime.77
54:1222:94671:32:24:122:504:463:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2.Construct predictions.Based on the sentences observed before age mid
54:1223:94741:24:24:137:504:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:30’s, we predict the sentences that the ABC/CARE subjects will have
54:1224:94808:24:24:137:504:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:after age mid 30’s.  Data from the North Carolina Department of Pub-
54:1225:94876:24:24:137:504:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:lic Safety (NCDPS), which provide lifetime sentences of individuals in
54:1226:94946:24:24:137:504:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:North Carolina,  are used to estimate sentences incurred after age mid
54:1227:95016:24:24:137:504:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:30’s from sentences incurred before age mid 30’s.  Applying these models
54:1228:95088:24:24:137:504:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to the ABC/CARE data, we predict the number of future sentences for
54:1229:95155:24:24:137:503:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:each subject up to age 50.78We then add these estimates to the orig-
54:1230:95223:24:16:137:504:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:inal number of sentences, getting an estimate of the lifetime sentences.
54:1231:95295:16:16:120:504:255:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:75In practice, we count all offenses (an arrest might include multiple offenses).  This gives
54:1232:95388:16:12:108:504:239:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the correct number of victims for our estimations.  The youth data have coarser categories
54:1233:95478:12:12:108:504:227:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:than the rest of the data:  violent, property, drug, and other.  To match these data with the
54:1234:95571:12:12:108:504:215:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:adult data,  we assume that all property crimes were larcenies and that all violent crimes
54:1235:95661:12:12:108:504:203:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:are assaults.  In the ABC/CARE sample, assault is the most common type of violent crime,
54:1236:95749:12:8:108:346:191:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:and larceny/theft is the most common property crime.
54:1237:95801:8:16:120:504:183:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:76About 10% of the ABC/CARE sample has missing arrest data.  We fail to reject the
54:1238:95883:16:12:108:504:167:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:null  hypothesis  of  no  differences  in  observed  characteristics  between  the  treatment-  and
54:1239:95982:12:8:108:462:155:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:control-group participants for whom we observe arrests data (see Appendix A.6).
54:1240:96061:8:16:120:504:147:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:77This arrest-sentence ratio is constructed using the National Crime Victimization Survey
54:1241:96150:16:8:108:380:131:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:(NJRP) and the Uniform Crime Reporting Statistics (UCRS).
54:1242:96207:8:16:120:504:123:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:78We assume that individuals with no criminal records before age mid 30’s commit no
54:1243:96290:16:0:108:220:107:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:crimes after age mid 30’s.
55:1244:96318:0:34:137:504:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Adding these estimates increases the total count of crimes by 30%–50%.
55:1245:96388:34:24:122:503:638:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:3.Estimate  number  of  victims  from  the  crimes.We  only  observe  crimes

55:1247:96538:24:24:137:504:590:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in arrests and/or sentences.  To include unobserved crimes, we use vic-

55:1249:96679:24:24:137:503:542:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:is  the  national  ratio  of  victims  and  arrests  for  each  type  of  crime.80
55:1250:96761:24:24:137:504:518:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Then, we estimate the number of victims from the crimes committed by
55:1251:96829:24:34:137:503:494:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:ABC/CARE subjects as their total arrests multiplied by the VI ratio.81

55:1253:96974:24:23:137:504:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for victims from McCollister et al. (2010) to impute the total victimiza-
55:1254:97047:23:24:137:504:413:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:tion costs.  For crimes resulting in arrests and/or sentences, we consider
55:1255:97121:24:24:137:503:389:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:justice system costs as well, such as police costs.82Finally, we construct
55:1256:97195:24:24:137:504:365:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  total  costs  of  incarceration  for  each  subject  using  the  total  prison
55:1257:97278:24:16:137:332:341:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f4:time and the cost of a day in prison.83
55:1258:97317:16:15:120:504:325:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:79Previous papers using this method include Belfield et al. (2006) and Heckman et al.
55:1259:97402:15:9:108:144:310:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:(2010b).
55:1260:97410:9:15:120:504:301:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:80We assume that each crime with victims is counted separately in the national reports
55:1261:97496:15:12:108:504:286:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:on arrests, even for arrests that might have been motivated by more than one crime.  This
55:1262:97585:12:12:108:504:274:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:victim-arrest  ratio  is  constructed  using  the  NJRP  and  the  National  Crime  Victimization
55:1263:97682:12:8:108:179:262:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Survey (NCVS).
55:1264:97696:8:16:120:504:254:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:81Additionally, we can calculate an analogous estimate of the number of crime victims
55:1265:97781:16:12:108:504:238:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:using sentences,  based on the VI ratio and the national arrests-to-sentences ratio.  These
55:1266:97872:12:12:108:504:226:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:estimates are very similar, as shown in Appendix E. To improve precision, the estimates in
55:1267:97962:12:8:108:414:214:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the rest of our paper are based on the average of the two calculations.
55:1268:98033:8:16:120:504:206:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:82To be able to assign costs to each type of crime, we assume that the cost of the justice
55:1269:98123:16:12:108:504:190:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:system  depends  on  the  number  of  offenses  of  each  type,  rather  than  on  the  number  of
55:1270:98221:12:12:108:504:178:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:arrests.   While  this  could  very  slightly  overestimate  justice  system  costs,  the  costs  only
55:1271:98323:12:8:108:299:166:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:represent about 5% of the total crime costs.
55:1272:98367:8:16:120:504:158:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:83Appendix I examines the sensitivity of our crime costs quantification to different as-
55:1273:98455:16:12:108:504:142:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:sumptions.  Section 6 and Appendix I we examine the sensitivity of our overall assessment
55:1274:98544:12:0:108:475:130:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:of ABC/CARE results to the quantification of crime that we explain in this section.

56:1276:98645:32:24:108:504:631:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Follow-up data on educational attainment were collected through age 30.  In
56:1277:98720:24:24:108:504:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Appendix D, we show that using auxiliary data sources, education up to this
56:1278:98795:24:24:108:504:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:age is an accurate predictor of lifetime educational attainment.  Therefore, we
56:1279:98874:24:24:108:504:559:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:do not predict educational attainment beyond age 30.  To monetize the costs
56:1280:98949:24:23:108:504:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of education,  we consider the public costs of K-12 education and the public
56:1281:99025:23:24:108:504:512:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and private costs of post-secondary education, including vocational programs
56:1282:99101:24:24:108:504:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and community college.  Other costs of education include grade retention and
56:1283:99177:24:24:108:504:464:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:special education.  Previous analyses of ABC pay special attention to special
56:1284:99254:24:24:108:504:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:education, arguing that savings due to a reduction in this category are substan-

57:1303:100434:24:24:108:504:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the analogous internal rates of return.  Pooling males and females, the results
57:1304:100513:24:24:108:504:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:indicate that the program is socially efficient:  the internal rate of return and
57:1305:100594:24:23:108:504:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f8:the  benefit/cost  ratio  are  13.7%  and  7.3.The  program  generates  a  benefit

57:1307:100763:24:24:108:504:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:significant,  even  after  accounting  for  sampling  variation,  serial  correlation,
57:1308:100849:24:24:108:504:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and  prediction  error  in  the  experimental  and  auxiliary  samples  and  the  tax
57:1309:100934:24:24:108:504:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:costs  of  financing  the  program.87These  benefits  arise  despite  the  fact  that
57:1310:101019:24:24:108:504:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ABC/CARE was much more expensive than other early childhood education
57:1311:101088:24:24:108:504:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:programs—the  treatment  involved  more  services  over  a  longer  time  period
57:1312:101168:24:18:108:216:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(Elango et al., 2016).
57:1313:101190:18:16:120:504:272:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:86Our calculations are based on progress reports written by the principal investigators and
57:1314:101281:16:12:108:504:256:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:related documentation recovered in the archives of the research center where the program
57:1315:101369:12:12:108:504:244:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:was implemented.  We display these sources in Appendix B. The main component is staff
57:1316:101454:12:12:108:504:232:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:costs.   Other  costs  arise  from  nutrition  and  services  that  the  subjects  receive  when  they
57:1317:101556:12:12:108:504:220:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:were sick, diapers during the first 15 months of their lives, and transportation to the center.
57:1318:101651:12:12:108:504:208:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:The control-group children also receive diapers during approximately 15 months, and iron-

57:1320:101832:12:12:108:504:184:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:We use the same costs estimates for CARE, for which there is less information available.
57:1321:101920:12:12:108:504:172:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:The costs exclude any expenses related to research or policy analysis.  A separate calculation
57:1322:102014:12:8:108:504:160:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:by the implementers of the program indicates almost an identical amount (see Appendix B).
57:1323:102103:8:16:120:503:152:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:87We  obtain  the  reported  standard  errors  by  bootstrappingallsteps  of  our  empirical
57:1324:102195:16:12:108:504:136:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:procedure,  including variable selection,  imputation,  model selection steps,  and prediction
57:1325:102289:12:0:108:220:124:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:error (see Appendix C.8).
58:1326:102316:0:24:129:503:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We accompany these estimates with a set of sensitivity checks of statisti-
58:1327:102390:24:24:108:504:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cal and economic interest.  Our estimates are not driven by our methods for
58:1328:102465:24:24:108:504:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:accounting for attrition and item non-response or by the conditioning variables
58:1329:102544:24:24:108:504:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we use when computing the net-present values.  Although the internal rate of
58:1330:102620:24:24:108:504:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:return remains relatively high when using participant outcome measures up to
58:1331:102696:24:24:108:504:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ages 21 or 30, the benefit/cost ratios indicate that accounting for benefits that
58:1332:102777:24:24:108:503:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:go beyond age 30 is important.  The return to each dollar is at most 3/1 when
58:1333:102854:24:24:108:504:504:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:considering benefits up to age 30 only (prediction span columns).  Accounting
58:1334:102931:24:24:108:504:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for the treatment substitutes available to controls also matters.  Males benefit
58:1335:103011:24:24:108:504:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the most from ABC/CARE relative to attending alternative childcare centers,
58:1336:103086:24:23:108:504:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:while females benefit the most from ABC/CARE relative to staying at home.
58:1337:103159:23:24:108:276:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We explore this difference below.
58:1338:103192:24:24:129:503:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our  baseline  estimates  account  for  the  deadweight  loss  caused  by  the
58:1339:103270:24:24:108:504:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:government using distortionary taxes to fund programs, plus the direct costs
58:1340:103346:24:24:108:503:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:associated  with  collecting  taxes.88Our  baseline  estimate  assumes  that  the
58:1341:103427:24:24:108:504:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:marginal  tax  rate  is  50%.89Our  estimates  are  robust  to  dropping  it  to  0%
58:1342:103511:24:24:108:504:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:or doubling it to 100% (deadweight loss columns).  Our baseline estimate of
58:1343:103586:24:24:108:504:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:benefit/cost ratios is based on a discount rate of 3%.  Not discounting roughly
58:1344:103665:24:18:108:504:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:doubles our benefit/cost ratios, while they remain statistically significant using
58:1345:103747:18:16:120:504:223:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:88When the transaction between the government and an individual is a direct transfer,
58:1346:103832:16:12:108:504:207:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:we consider 0.5 as a cost per each transacted dollar as we do not weight the final recipient
58:1347:103924:12:12:108:504:195:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:of the transaction (e.g., transfer income).  When the transaction is indirect, we classify it
58:1348:104017:12:12:108:504:183:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:as government spending as a whole and consider its cost as 1.5 per each dollar spent (e.g.,
58:1349:104108:12:8:108:187:171:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:public education).
58:1350:104126:8:16:120:504:163:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:89Feldstein (1999) reports that the deadweight loss caused by increasing existing tax rates
58:1351:104217:16:12:108:504:147:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:(marginal  deadweight  loss)  may  exceed  two  dollars  per  each  dollar  of  revenue  generated.
58:1352:104316:12:12:108:504:135:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:We  use  a  more  conservative  value  (0.5  dollars  per  each  dollar  of  revenue  generated).   In

58:1354:104507:12:0:108:178:111:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:little sensitivity.

62:1402:113571:12:12:108:503:385:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:represents the baseline estimates.  The rest of the rows present estimates for scenarios in
62:1403:113662:12:12:108:503:373:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:which we remove the NPV estimates of the component listed in the first column.  The cat-
62:1404:113750:12:12:108:503:361:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:egory “Alternative Preschools” refers to the money spent in alternatives to treatment from
62:1405:113840:12:12:108:503:349:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:the control-group children parents.  QALYs refers to the quality-adjusted life years.  Any
62:1406:113930:12:12:108:503:337:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:gain corresponds to better health conditions through the age of death.  The quantity listed
62:1407:114021:12:12:108:503:325:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:in the NPV columns is the component we remove from NPV when computing the calcula-

62:1409:114194:12:12:108:503:301:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:birth, unless otherwise specified.  For B/C we use a discount rate of 3%, unless otherwise
62:1410:114284:12:12:108:503:289:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:specified.  We test the null hypotheses IRR = 3% and B/C = 1—we select 3% as the bench-
62:1411:114371:12:12:108:503:277:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:mark null because that is the discount rate we use.  Inference is based on non-parametric,

62:1413:114551:11:12:108:228:254:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:significant at the 10% level.
62:1414:114580:12:40:108:307:242:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:Total cost of the program per child is 92,570.
62:1415:114626:40:24:129:503:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We also examine the sensitivity of our estimates to (i) dropping the most
62:1416:114699:24:24:107:504:178:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:costly crimes such as murders and rapes;91and (ii) halving the costs of vic-
62:1417:114775:24:18:107:503:154:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:timization and judiciary costs related to crime.  The first sensitivity check is
62:1418:114855:18:15:120:504:136:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:91Two individuals in the treatment group committed a rape and one individual in the
62:1419:114938:15:0:108:262:121:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:control group committed a murder.
63:1420:114973:0:24:108:504:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:important  because  we  do  not  want  our  estimates  to  be  based  on  a  few  ex-
63:1421:115058:24:24:108:504:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ceptional  crimes.   The  second  is  important  because  victimization  costs  are
63:1422:115141:24:24:108:504:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:somewhat subjective (see Appendix E). Our benefit/cost analysis is robust to
63:1423:115217:24:24:108:504:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:these adjustments, even when crime is a major component.  Lastly, we examine
63:1424:115293:24:24:108:504:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the sensitivity with respect to our main health component:  quality-adjusted
63:1425:115369:24:24:108:504:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:life years. This is an important component because relatively healthier individ-
63:1426:115449:24:24:108:504:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:uals survive longer and healthier, and treatment improves health conditions.
63:1427:115525:24:24:108:504:504:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:It is important to note that this component largely accumulates later in life
63:1428:115602:24:24:108:504:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and therefore it is heavily discounted.  Dropping the component or doubling
63:1429:115677:24:24:108:448:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the value of life does not have a major impact on our calculations.
63:1430:115744:24:23:129:503:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The estimates are robust when we conduct a drastic sensitivity analysis by
63:1431:115818:23:24:108:504:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:removing components of the benefit/cost analysis entirely (Table 9).92Even
63:1432:115892:24:24:108:504:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:when completely removing the gain associated with crime for males, the pro-
63:1433:115967:24:24:108:504:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:gram is socially efficient—both the internal rate of return and the benefit/cost
63:1434:116047:24:24:108:504:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ratio  are  substantial.   Parental  labor  income  and  crime  are  the  components
63:1435:116131:24:24:108:504:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for which the internal rate of return and the benefit/cost ratio are the most
63:1436:116208:24:24:108:504:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sensitive.  The reason for the sensitivity to parental labor income is that the
63:1437:116287:24:24:108:504:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:amount is substantial and it is not heavily discounted because it accumulates
63:1438:116364:24:24:108:504:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:during the first 21 years of a child’s life.  Crime occurs later in life and its ben-
63:1439:116449:24:24:108:504:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:efits are discounted accordingly.  The amount due to savings in crime is large,
63:1440:116528:24:24:108:504:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:so removing it diminishes both the internal rate of return and the benefit/cost
63:1441:116607:24:23:108:350:169:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ratio (but they remain statistically significant).
63:1442:116657:23:18:129:503:146:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In Appendix C.6, we also investigate how sensitive our prediction model
63:1443:116728:18:16:120:504:128:7:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f6:92In  Appendix  I,  we  present  exercises  that  are  not  as  drastic  as  removing  the  whole
63:1444:116825:16:0:108:310:112:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f6:component, but instead remove fractions of it.
64:1445:116873:0:24:108:504:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is to a variety of perturbations:  different autocorrelation processes in the pre-

64:1447:117041:24:24:108:330:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:robust to using different prediction models.
64:1448:117085:24:24:129:503:600:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:Overall,  our  sensitivity  analyses  indicate  that  no  single  category  of  out-
64:1449:117169:24:24:108:504:576:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:comes  drives  the  social  efficiency  of  the  program.   Rather,  it  is  the  life-cycle
64:1450:117261:24:24:108:409:552:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:benefits across multiple dimensions of human development.
64:1451:117318:24:24:129:503:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In Appendix J we use our analysis to examine the empirical foundations of
64:1452:117391:24:24:108:504:504:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:recent cost-benefit studies of early childhood programs that use short term es-
64:1453:117470:24:24:108:504:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:timates of experimental test score gains coupled with auxiliary estimates of the
64:1454:117550:24:24:108:504:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:impact of test scores on earnings (see, e.g., work by Kline and Walters, 2016).
64:1455:117629:24:23:108:504:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We show that this approach applied to the ABC data greatly understates the
64:1456:117703:23:24:108:504:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:true benefit-cost ratio because (a) earnings are only predicted through a young

64:1458:117859:24:24:108:504:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Applying the Kline and Walters method to the ABC/CARE experiment, we
64:1459:117927:24:47:108:465:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:would find a cost-benefit ratio of 1.4 compared to our estimate of 7.3.
64:1460:117998:47:31:108:463:290:14:g_d0_f14:14:g_d0_f14:6.3    Possible Explanations for Gender Differences
64:1461:118049:31:24:108:504:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The benefit/cost ratio and internal rate of return calculations both indicate
64:1462:118126:24:24:108:504:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that males and females benefitdifferentlyfrom the program compared to the
64:1463:118199:24:24:107:504:211:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:alternatives “H” and “C”.  There are two complementary stories that help to
64:1464:118274:24:24:107:503:187:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:explain this difference.  First, gender differences could exist as a consequence
64:1465:118354:24:24:107:503:163:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the outcomes monetized, and not because of the particular counterfactuals
64:1466:118430:24:24:107:503:139:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that we estimate.  Males have relatively high benefits from the outcomes that
64:1467:118507:24:0:107:503:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we are able to monetize.  Labor income and crime are prime examples of this.

66:1470:121276:0:24:108:504:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Females are less likely to work than males.  While all males supply labor in our
66:1471:121356:24:24:108:504:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sample at age 30, not all females do.  We are not able to quantify household
66:1472:121432:24:24:108:504:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:production benefits for either males or females.  This is an important omission
66:1473:121511:24:24:108:504:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:for females who decide to stay at home instead of work.  For example, we lack
66:1474:121588:24:24:108:282:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:data on their children’s outcomes.
66:1475:121622:24:24:129:503:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ABC/CARE has treatment effects on crime for females for a number of
66:1476:121689:24:24:108:504:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:categories (see Appendix G). However, males are much more likely to commit
66:1477:121763:24:24:108:504:504:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:crimes  that  are  more  costly  to  the  victims,  to  the  criminal  justice  system,
66:1478:121850:24:24:108:504:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and  to  society  (Cohen  and  Bowles,  2010;  Barak  et  al.,  2015).   ABC/CARE
66:1479:121931:24:24:108:504:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:also has treatment effects on crime for females for a number of categories (see
66:1480:122010:24:23:108:504:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Appendix G). However, males commit crimes that are much more expensive
66:1481:122080:23:24:108:504:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:to society.  These two categories are examples of why the magnitudes of the
66:1482:122155:24:24:108:407:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:gains are much higher for males than they are for females.
66:1483:122213:24:24:129:503:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:For health, there are also substantial gender differences.  Both males and
66:1484:122287:24:24:108:504:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:females have substantial gains:  males benefit on more standard measures of
66:1485:122362:24:24:108:504:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:physical health, and females benefit on a set of mental health measures (see
66:1486:122438:24:24:108:504:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Appendix G). We quantify both components (see Section 5.4 and Appendix F).
66:1487:122512:24:24:129:503:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:There is a second factor at work. There are substantial differences between
66:1488:122587:24:24:108:504:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:males and females in one counterfactual:  treatment vs.  alternative preschools.
66:1489:122667:24:24:108:504:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The estimated treatment effects are very similar across genders for treatment
66:1490:122744:24:24:108:504:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:compared to those staying at home full time.  Males benefit much more from
66:1491:122818:24:23:108:504:169:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:treatment relative to alternative preschools compared to their benefits from
66:1492:122894:23:24:108:504:146:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:treatment  relative  to  staying  at  home.   This  result  is  consistent  with  find-
66:1493:122981:24:0:108:504:122:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ings noted elsewhere:  (i) stark gender differences resulting from attending low
67:1494:123063:0:24:108:504:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:quality childcare (Kottelenberg and Lehrer, 2014; Baker et al., 2015); and (ii)
67:1495:123142:24:24:108:504:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:females  are  less  sensitive  to  uncertain  environments  (see,  e.g.,  Autor  et  al.,
67:1496:123231:24:24:108:139:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2015).
67:1497:123237:24:24:129:503:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our evidence does not indicate that the program has no benefits for fe-
67:1498:123308:24:24:108:504:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:males.   When  compared  to  staying  at  home,  there  is  a  gain  of  4.93  dollars
67:1499:123394:24:24:108:504:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:per each dollar invested.  When we decompose the net-present value for each
67:1500:123469:24:24:108:504:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of the components that we monetize, we find substantial benefits for females
67:1501:123545:24:24:108:504:504:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:across a variety of categories, including health and crime.  For males, the mag-
67:1502:123625:24:24:108:504:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:nitudes are noticeably increased when comparing outcomes from treatment to
67:1503:123699:24:54:108:428:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:outcomes from attending alternative preschools (see Figure 7).
67:1504:123761:54:36:108:218:402:17:g_d0_f14:17:g_d0_f14:7    Summary
67:1505:123773:36:24:108:504:366:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This paper studies two influential early childhood programs evaluated by the
67:1506:123849:24:23:108:504:342:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:method of randomized control trials with long term follow-up through the mid
67:1507:123925:23:24:108:504:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:30’s.  These programs are emulated in a variety of active early childhood pro-
67:1508:124003:24:24:108:504:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:grams around the world.  We document outcomes across multiple life domains.
67:1509:124078:24:24:108:503:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We estimate a statistically significant aggregate benefit/cost ratio of 7.3 and
67:1510:124157:24:24:108:504:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a rate of return of 13.7% per annum, even after adjusting for the welfare costs
67:1511:124236:24:24:108:328:223:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of financing the program through taxation.
67:1512:124278:24:24:129:503:199:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To reach these conclusions, we address a number of empirical challenges:
67:1513:124350:24:24:108:504:175:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(i) control group substitution; (ii) extrapolating lifetime benefits beyond the
67:1514:124429:24:24:108:504:151:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:experimental period; and (iii) the multiplicity of hypotheses tested.  Our ap-
67:1515:124507:24:0:108:504:127:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:proach serves as a template for evaluations of programs with partial follow up
68:1516:124587:0:24:108:201:672:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:over the life cycle.
68:1517:124607:24:24:129:503:648:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Benefits differ substantially by gender. Females have more beneficial treat-
68:1518:124683:24:24:108:504:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ment effects than males,  but the monetized value of the male treatment ef-
68:1519:124758:24:24:108:504:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fects is greater.  There are substantial effects on health and (health-related)
68:1520:124837:24:24:108:504:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:quality of life as well as crime for males.  For females, the benefits are concen-
68:1521:124919:24:24:108:504:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:trated in education, employment, and minor crimes.  The effects for females
68:1522:124994:24:24:108:504:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are stronger compared to the alternative of staying at home.  The effects for
68:1523:125071:24:24:108:504:504:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:males are stronger compared to the alternative of participation in alternative
68:1524:125149:24:24:108:504:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:childcare  arrangements.   The  program  subsidizes  maternal  employment  and
68:1525:125227:24:24:108:504:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:has  a  strong  causal  effect  on  maternal  labor  income.   We  demonstrate  the
68:1526:125310:24:63:108:345:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:long-term multiple benefits of these programs.
