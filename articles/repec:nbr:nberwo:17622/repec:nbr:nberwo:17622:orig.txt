2:28:1389:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This article reviews macroeconomic models with heterogeneous households. A key question for the
2:29:1484:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:relevance of these models concerns the degree to which markets are complete. This is because the
2:30:1580:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:existence of complete markets imposes restrictions on (i) how much heterogeneity matters for aggregate
2:31:1682:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:phenomena and (ii) the types of cross-sectional distributions that can be obtained. The degree of market
2:32:1786:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:incompleteness, in turn, depends on two factors: (i) the richness of insurance opportunities provided
2:33:1887:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:by the economic environment and (ii) the nature and magnitude of idiosyncratic risks to be insured.
2:34:1986:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:First, I review a broad collection of empirical evidence—from econometric tests of “full insurance,”
2:35:2086:14:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to quantitative and empirical analyses of the permanent income (“self-insurance”) model that examine
2:36:2186:14:14:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:how it fits the facts about life cycle allocations, to studies that try to directly measure where economies
2:37:2293:14:14:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:place between these two benchmarks (“partial insurance”). The empirical evidence I survey reveals
2:38:2390:14:14:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:significant uncertainty in the profession regarding the magnitudes of idiosyncratic risks as well as
2:39:2490:14:14:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:whether or not these risks have increased since the 1970s. An important difficulty stems from the fact
2:40:2592:14:14:72:540:420:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that inequality often arises from a mixture of idiosyncratic risk and fixed (or predictable) heterogeneity,
2:41:2699:14:14:72:540:406:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:making the two challenging to disentangle. I also discuss applications of incomplete markets models
2:42:2798:14:14:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to trends in wealth, consumption, and earnings inequality both over the life cycle and over time, where
2:43:2901:14:14:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:this challenge is evident. Third, I discuss “approximate” aggregation—the finding that some incomplete
2:44:3003:14:14:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:markets models generate aggregate implications very similar to representative-agent models. What
2:45:3099:14:14:72:540:350:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:approximate aggregation does and does not imply is illustrated through several examples. Finally,
2:46:3196:14:14:72:540:336:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:I discuss some computational issues relevant for solving and calibrating such models and I provide
2:47:3294:14:14:72:540:322:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:a simple yet fully parallelizable global optimization algorithm that can be used to calibrate heterogeneous
2:48:3401:14:42:72:139:308:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:agent models.

3:59:3691:46:32:72:220:630:296:g_d0_f3:296:g_d0_f3:1Introduction
3:60:3704:32:16:72:535:598:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:The quest for the origins of inequality has kept philosophers and scientists occupied for
3:61:3793:16:16:72:535:582:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:centuries. A central question of interest—also highlighted in Academy of Dijon’s solicitation
3:62:3886:16:16:72:535:566:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:for its essay competition1—is whether inequality is determined solely through a natural
3:63:3973:16:16:71:535:550:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:process or through the interaction of innate differences with man-made institutions and
3:64:4060:16:15:71:534:534:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:policies. And, if it is the latter, what is the precise relationship between these origins and
3:65:4154:15:21:71:194:519:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:socio-economic policies?
3:66:4178:21:16:89:535:498:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:While many interesting ideas and hypotheses have been put forward over time, the main
3:67:4263:16:15:71:535:482:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:impediment to progress came from the difficulty of scientifically testing these hypotheses,
3:68:4354:15:16:71:534:467:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:which would allow researchers to refine ideas that were deemed promising and discard those
3:69:4444:16:16:71:534:451:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:that were not. Economists, who grapple with the same questions today, have three impor-
3:70:4531:16:16:71:534:435:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:tant advantages that can allow us to make progress. First, modern quantitative economics
3:71:4619:16:16:71:534:419:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:provides a wide set of powerful tools, which allow researchers to build “laboratories” in which
3:72:4714:16:16:71:533:403:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:various hypotheses regarding the origins and consequences of inequality can be studied. Sec-
3:73:4806:16:16:71:534:387:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:ond, the widespread availability of rich micro data sources—from cross-sectional surveys to
3:74:4897:16:16:71:534:371:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:panel datasets from administrative records that contain millions of observations—provides
3:75:4986:16:16:71:534:355:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:fresh input into these laboratories. Third, thanks to Moore’s law, the cost of computation
3:76:5076:16:15:71:534:339:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:has fallen radically in the past decades, making it feasible to numerically solve, simulate, and
3:77:5172:15:16:71:534:324:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:estimate complex models with rich heterogeneity on a typical desktop workstation available
3:78:5262:16:21:71:173:308:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:to most economists.
3:79:5281:21:15:89:535:287:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:There are two broad sets of economic questions for which economists might want to
3:80:5362:15:16:71:534:272:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:model heterogeneity.  First, and most obviously, these models allow us to study cross-
3:81:5448:16:16:71:534:256:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:sectional, or distributional, phenomena. The US economy today provides ample motivation
3:82:5535:16:16:71:534:240:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:for studying distributional issues, with the top 1% of households owning almost half of
3:83:5622:16:16:71:534:224:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:all stocks and 1/3 of all net worth in the United States, and wage inequality having risen
3:84:5712:16:16:71:534:208:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:virtually without interruption for the lastfortyyears. Not surprisingly, many questions of
3:85:5802:16:16:71:534:192:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:current policy debate are inherently about their distributional consequences. For example,
3:86:5892:16:16:71:534:176:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:heated disagreements about major budget issues—such as reforming Medicare, Medicaid,
3:87:5976:16:16:71:534:160:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and the Social Security system—often revolve around the redistributional effects of such
3:88:6064:16:15:71:534:144:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:changes. Similarly, a crucial aspect of the current debate on taxation is about “who should
3:89:6155:15:16:71:534:129:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:pay what?”.  Answering these questions would begin with a sound understanding of the
3:90:6239:16:18:71:367:113:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:fundamental determinants of different types of inequality.
3:91:6297:18:15:85:534:95:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:1The competition generated broad interest from scholars of the time, including Jean-Jacques Rousseau,
3:92:6398:15:0:71:529:80:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:who wrote his famousDiscourse on the Origins of Inequalityin response, but failed to win the top prize.
4:93:6502:0:16:89:535:696:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A second set of questions for which heterogeneity could matter involve aggregate phe-
4:94:6587:16:16:71:534:680:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:nomena.  This second use of heterogeneous-agent models is less obvious than the first,
4:95:6673:16:16:71:535:664:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:because various aggregation theorems as well as numerical results (e.g.,Rios-Rull(1996)
4:96:6760:16:16:71:535:648:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and   Krusell and Smith(1998)) have established that certain types of heterogeneity do not
4:97:6850:16:21:71:427:632:143:g_d0_f2:64:g_d0_f4:change (many) implications relative to a representative-agent model.2
4:98:6919:21:16:89:535:611:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:To understand this result and its ramifications, in Section 2, I start by reviewing some
4:99:7007:16:16:71:535:595:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:key theoretical results on aggregation (Rubinstein(1974)andConstantinides(1982)). Our
4:100:7092:16:16:71:534:579:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:interest in these theorems comes from a practical concern: basically, a subset of the condi-
4:101:7184:16:15:71:534:563:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:tions required by these theorems are often satisfied in heterogeneous-agent models, making
4:102:7274:15:16:71:534:548:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:their aggregate implications closely mimic those from a representative-agent economy. For
4:103:7363:16:16:71:538:532:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:example, an important theorem proved byConstantinides(1982)establishestheexistence
4:104:7445:16:16:71:534:516:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:of a representative agent if markets are complete.3This central role of complete markets
4:105:7533:16:16:72:535:500:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:turned the spotlight since the late 1980s onto its testable implications for perfect risk sharing
4:106:7630:16:16:72:535:484:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:(or “full insurance”). As I review in Section 3, these implications have been tested by an ex-
4:107:7724:16:16:72:535:468:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:tensive literature using datasets from all around the world—from developed countries such
4:108:7813:16:16:72:535:452:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:as the United States to village economies in India, Thailand, Uganda, and so on. While
4:109:7899:16:16:72:535:436:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:this literature delivered a clearstatisticalrejection, it also revealed a surprising amount
4:110:7990:16:15:72:535:420:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:of “partial” insurance, in the sense that individual consumption growth (or, more gener-
4:111:8078:15:16:72:535:405:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:ally, marginal utility growth) does not seem to respond to many seemingly large shocks,
4:112:8165:16:16:72:539:389:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:such as long spells of unemployment, strikes, and involuntary moves (Cochrane(1991)and
4:113:8251:16:21:72:242:373:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Townsend(1994), among others).
4:114:8281:21:16:89:535:352:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:This raises the more practical question of “howfarare we from the complete markets
4:115:8363:16:16:72:536:336:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:benchmark?”. To answer this question, researchers have recently turned to directly measur-
4:116:8453:16:16:72:535:320:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:ing the degree of partial insurance, defined for our purposes as the degree of consumption
4:117:8543:16:16:72:534:304:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:smoothing over and above what an individual can achieve on her own via “self-insurance”
4:118:8630:16:15:72:535:288:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:in a permanent income model (i.e., using a single risk-free asset for borrowing and saving).

4:123:9053:16:16:72:535:204:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:4. Starting withImrohoroglu(1989),Huggett(1993), andAiyagari(1994), this literature
4:124:9136:16:16:72:535:188:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:has been addressing issues from a very broad spectrum, covering diverse topics such as the
4:125:9226:16:16:72:535:172:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:equity premium and other puzzles in finance; important life cycle choices, such as education,

4:129:9608:16:8:72:534:107:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:as those of the underlying individual problem. I discuss important examples to the contrary in Section7.2.
4:130:9714:8:16:85:534:99:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:3(Financial) markets are “complete” when agents have access to a sufficiently rich set of assets that allows
4:131:9822:16:0:71:456:83:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:them to transfer their wealth/resources across any two dates and/or states of the world.

5:134:10093:16:20:72:240:664:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:These are discussed in Section 5.

5:136:10205:16:16:72:535:628:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:from “risk/uncertainty” (also called ex post heterogeneity)—two sides of the same coin,
5:137:10292:16:16:72:534:612:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:with potentially very different implications for policy and welfare. But this is a challenging
5:138:10386:16:16:72:535:596:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:task, because inequality often arises from a mixture of heterogeneity and idiosyncratic
5:139:10473:16:15:72:535:580:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:risk, making the two difficult to disentangle. It requires researchers to carefully combine
5:140:10564:15:16:72:534:565:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:cross-sectional information with sufficiently long time-series data for analysis. The state-
5:141:10656:16:16:72:535:549:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:of-the-art methods used in this field increasingly blend the set of tools developed and used
5:142:10748:16:16:72:535:533:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:by quantitative macroeconomists with those used by structural econometricians. Despite
5:143:10834:16:16:72:535:517:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the application of these sophisticated tools, there remains significant uncertainty in the
5:144:10924:16:16:72:535:501:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:profession regarding the magnitudes of idiosyncratic risks as well as whether or not these
5:145:11014:16:20:72:257:485:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:risks have increased since the 1970s.
5:146:11051:20:16:89:535:465:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:The Imrohoroglu-Huggett-Aiyagari framework sidestepped a difficult issue raised by the
5:147:11137:16:16:72:535:449:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:lack of aggregation—that aggregates, including prices, depend on the entire wealth distribu-
5:148:11229:16:15:72:535:433:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:tion. This was accomplished by abstracting from aggregate shocks, which allowed them to
5:149:11316:15:16:72:535:418:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:focus on stationary equilibria in which prices (the interest rate and the average wage) were
5:150:11408:16:16:72:535:402:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:simply some constants to be solved for in equilibrium. A far more challenging problem with
5:151:11498:16:16:72:535:386:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:incomplete markets arises in the presence of aggregate shocks, in which case equilibrium
5:152:11586:16:16:72:535:370:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:prices becomefunctionsof the entire wealth distribution, which varies with the aggregate
5:153:11674:16:16:72:535:354:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:state. Individuals need to know these equilibrium functions, so that they can forecast how
5:154:11764:16:16:72:535:338:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:prices will evolve in the future as the aggregate state evolves in a stochastic manner. Be-
5:155:11855:16:16:72:535:322:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:cause the wealth distribution is an infinite-dimensional object, an exact solution is typically
5:156:11950:16:16:72:535:306:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:not feasible.Krusell and Smith(1998) proposed a solution whereby one approximates the
5:157:12035:16:15:72:535:290:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:wealth distribution with a finite number of its moments (inspired by the idea that a given
5:158:12125:15:16:72:535:275:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:probability distribution can be represented by its moment generating function). In a re-
5:159:12213:16:16:72:535:259:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:markable finding, they showed that the first moment (the mean) of the wealth distribution
5:160:12302:16:16:72:535:243:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:was all individuals needed to track in this economy for predicting all future prices. This
5:161:12392:16:16:72:535:227:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:result—generally known as “approximate aggregation”—is a double-edged sword. On the
5:162:12475:16:16:72:535:211:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:one hand, it makes feasible the solution of a wide range of interesting models with incomplete
5:163:12569:16:16:72:535:195:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:markets and aggregate shocks. On the other hand, it suggests that ex post heterogeneity
5:164:12656:16:16:72:535:179:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:does not often generate aggregate implications much different from a representative-agent
5:165:12745:16:16:72:535:163:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:model. So, the hope that some aggregate phenomena that were puzzling in representative-
5:166:12832:16:15:72:535:147:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:agent models could be explained in an incomplete markets framework is weakened with this
5:167:12920:15:16:72:535:132:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:result. While this is an important finding, there are many examples where heterogeneity
5:168:13007:16:20:72:479:116:143:g_d0_f6:143:g_d0_f2:doesaffect aggregates in a significant way. I discuss a variety of such examples.
5:169:13088:20:16:89:535:96:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Finally, I turn to computation and calibration. First, in Section 6, I discuss some details
5:170:13179:16:0:72:535:80:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:of the Krusell-Smith method. A number of potential pitfalls are discussed and alternative
6:171:13269:0:16:72:535:696:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:checks of accuracy are studied. Second, an important practical issue that arises with cali-
6:172:13360:16:16:72:535:680:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:brating/estimating large and complex quantitative models is the following. The objective
6:173:13448:16:16:72:535:664:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:function that we minimize often has lots of jaggedness, small jumps, and/or deep ridges
6:174:13535:16:16:72:535:648:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:due to a variety of reasons that have to do with approximations, interpolations, binding
6:175:13623:16:16:72:535:632:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:constraints, etc. Thus, local optimization methods are typically of little help on their own,
6:176:13716:16:16:72:536:616:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:because they very often get stuck in some local minima. In Section 8, I describe a global
6:177:13805:16:16:72:535:600:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:optimization algorithm that is simple yet powerful and is fully parallelizable without re-
6:178:13895:16:16:72:535:584:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:quiring any knowledge of MPI, OpenMP, and so on. It works on any number of computers
6:179:13979:16:15:72:535:568:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:that are connected to the Internet and have access to a synchronization service like Drop-
6:180:14069:15:16:72:534:553:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Box. I provide a discussion of ways to customize this algorithm with different options to

6:183:14181:33:15:72:535:464:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Even in a simple static model with no uncertainty we need a way to deal with consumer
6:184:14266:15:16:72:535:449:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:heterogeneity. Adding dynamics and risk into this environment make things more complex
6:185:14352:16:16:72:535:433:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and require a different set of conditions to be imposed. In this section, I will review some key
6:186:14448:16:16:72:535:417:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:theoretical results on various forms of aggregation. I begin with a very simple framework
6:187:14537:16:16:72:535:401:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and build up to a fully dynamic model with idiosyncratic (i.e., individual-specific) risk and
6:188:14630:16:21:72:530:385:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:discuss what types of aggregation results one can hope to get and under what conditions.
6:189:14718:21:16:89:535:364:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Our interest in aggregation is not mainly for theoretical reasons.  As we shall see,
6:190:14802:16:16:72:535:348:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:some of the conditions required for aggregation are satisfied (sometimes inadvertently!)
6:191:14890:16:15:72:535:332:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:by commonly used heterogeneous-agent frameworks, making them behave very much like

6:194:15134:16:16:72:535:285:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:representative-agent model. Thus, learning about the assumptions underlying the aggrega-
6:195:15222:16:16:72:535:269:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:tion theorems can allow model builders to choose the features of their models carefully so
6:196:15312:16:34:72:209:253:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:as to avoid such outcomes.

8:294:19270:18:11:85:492:141:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:5We can easily allow for multiple risky securities at the expense of complicating the notation.
8:295:19365:11:16:85:534:130:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:6“Risk tolerance” is the reciprocal of the Arrow-Pratt measure of “absolute risk aversion,” which measures
8:296:19471:16:8:71:467:114:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:consumers’ willingness to bear a fixed amount of consumption risk. See, e.g.,Pratt(1964).

9:313:20262:33:31:89:237:536:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Several remarks are in order.
9:314:20291:31:16:72:535:505:143:g_d0_f20:143:g_d0_f2:Demand Aggregation.An important corollary to this theorem is that whenever a com-
9:315:20372:16:16:72:536:489:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:posite consumer can be constructed, in equilibrium, rates of return are insensitive to the
9:316:20462:16:15:72:535:473:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:distribution of resources among individuals. This is because the aggregate demand functions
9:317:20553:15:16:72:535:458:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:(for both consumption and assets) depend only on total wealth and not on its distribution.
9:318:20643:16:31:72:264:442:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Thus, we have “demand aggregation.”
9:319:20678:31:16:72:534:411:143:g_d0_f20:143:g_d0_f2:Aggregation and Heterogeneity in Relative Risk Aversion.Notice that all six cases
9:320:20759:16:16:72:535:395:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:that give rise to demand aggregation in the theorem require individuals to have the same
9:321:20847:16:15:72:535:379:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:curvature parameter,-. To see why this is important, note that (with HARA preferences)
9:322:20933:15:16:71:535:364:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f14:the optimal holdings of the risky asset is a linear function of the consumer’s wealth:1+
9:323:21022:16:16:72:535:348:143:g_d0_f19:143:g_d0_f2:2wt/-,where1and2are some constants that depend on the properties of returns. It
9:324:21104:16:16:71:535:332:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:is easy to see that with identical slopes,2/-, it does not matter who holds the wealth.
9:325:21192:16:16:72:535:316:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:In other words, redistributing wealth between any two agents would cause changes in total
9:326:21281:16:16:72:535:300:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:demand for assets that will cancel out each other, due to linearity and same slopes. Notice
9:327:21372:16:16:72:535:284:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:also that while identical curvature is a necessary condition, it is not sufficient for demand
9:328:21465:16:16:72:535:268:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:aggregation: each of the six cases adds more conditions on top of this identical curvature

9:331:21615:28:16:72:535:190:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:WhileRubinstein(1974)’s theorem delivers a strong aggregation result, it achieves this by
9:332:21704:16:16:71:534:174:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:abstracting from a key aspect of dynamic economies: uncertainty that evolves over time.
9:333:21791:16:16:71:534:158:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Almost every interesting economy that we discuss in the coming sections will feature some
9:334:21880:16:19:71:534:142:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:kind of idiosyncratic risk that individuals face (coming from labor income fluctuations,
9:335:21968:19:15:85:535:123:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:8Notice also that, because in some cases (such as (2)) heterogeneity in⇢is allowed, individuals will
9:336:22068:15:12:72:534:108:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:exhibit different relative risk aversions (if they have differentwt), for example in the generalized CRRA
9:337:22173:12:0:71:213:96:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:case, and still allow aggregation.
10:338:22208:0:16:72:534:696:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:shocks to health, shocks to housing prices and asset returns, among others).Rubinstein
10:339:22294:16:20:72:535:680:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:(1974)’s theorem is silent about how the aggregate economy behaves under these scenarios.
10:340:22383:20:16:89:534:660:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:This is whereConstantinides(1982) comes into play: He shows that if markets are
10:341:22462:16:16:72:535:644:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:complete, under much weaker conditions (on preferences, beliefs, discount rates, etc.) one
10:342:22552:16:16:72:535:628:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:can replace heterogeneous consumers with a planner who maximizes a weighted sum of
10:343:22634:16:16:72:535:612:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:consumers’ utilities. In turn, the central planner can be replaced by a composite consumer
10:344:22724:16:19:72:379:596:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:who maximizes a utility function of aggregate consumption.
10:345:22782:19:16:89:535:577:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:To show this, consider a private ownership economy with production as inDebreu(1959),

10:347:22943:16:16:72:539:545:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:can be thought of a date-event labelled goods (and concave utility functions,Ui,asbeing

11:421:24658:42:16:72:535:410:143:g_d0_f20:143:g_d0_f2:Constantinides versus Rubinstein.Constantinides allows for much more generality
11:422:24737:16:16:72:535:394:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:than Rubinstein by relaxing two important restrictions. First, no conditions are imposed
11:423:24825:16:16:72:535:378:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:on the homogeneity of preferences, which was a crucial element in every version of Rubin-
11:424:24914:16:16:72:535:362:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:stein’s theorem. Second, Constantinides allows for both exogenous endowment as well as
11:425:25000:16:16:72:535:346:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:production at every date and state. In contrast, recall that, in Rubinstein’s environment,
11:426:25090:16:16:72:535:330:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:individuals start life with a wealth stock and receive no further income or endowment dur-
11:427:25180:16:15:72:535:314:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:ing life. In exchange, Constantinides requires complete markets and does not get demand
11:428:25267:15:16:72:535:299:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:aggregation. Notice that the existence of a composite consumer does not imply demand
11:429:25351:16:16:72:535:283:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:aggregation, for at least two reasons.  First, composite demand depends on the weights
11:430:25437:16:16:72:535:267:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:in the planner’s problem and, thus, depends on the distribution of endowments. Second,
11:431:25523:16:16:72:534:251:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f6:the composite is defined at equilibrium prices and no claim is made that its demandcurve
11:432:25611:16:21:72:296:235:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:coincides with the aggregate demand curve.
11:433:25653:21:16:89:535:214:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Thus, the usefulness of Constantinides’ result hinges on (i) the degree to which markets
11:434:25741:16:16:72:535:198:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:are complete, (ii) whether we want to allow for idiosyncratic risk and heterogeneity in
11:435:25828:16:16:72:535:182:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:preferences (which are both restricted in Rubinstein’s theorem), and (iii) whether or not we
11:436:25920:16:15:72:535:166:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:need demand aggregation. Below I will address these issues in more detail. We will see that,
11:437:26012:15:16:72:535:151:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:interestingly, even when markets are not complete, in certain cases, we will not only get
11:438:26101:16:16:72:535:135:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:close to a composite consumer representation, but we can also get quite close to the much
11:439:26190:16:16:72:535:119:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:stronger result of demand aggregation! An important reason for this outcome is that many
11:440:26278:16:16:72:535:103:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:heterogeneous-agent models assume identical preferences, which eliminates an important
11:441:26364:16:0:72:535:87:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:source of heterogeneity, satisfying Rubinstein’s conditions for preferences. However, these
12:442:26457:0:16:72:535:696:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:models do feature idiosyncratic risk, but as we shall we, when the planning horizon is long,
12:443:26549:16:16:72:535:680:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:such shocks can often be smoothed effectively using even a simple risk free asset. More on
12:444:26639:16:31:72:212:664:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:this in the coming sections.
12:445:26667:31:15:72:534:633:143:g_d0_f20:143:g_d0_f2:Completing Markets by Adding Financial Assets.It is useful to distinguish between
12:446:26748:15:16:72:535:618:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:“physical” assets—those in positive net supply (e.g. equity shares, capital, housing, etc)—
12:447:26839:16:16:72:535:602:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and “financial” assets—those in zero net supply (bonds, insurance contracts, etc.).  The
12:448:26927:16:16:72:535:586:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:latter are simply some contracts written on a piece of paper that specifies the conditions
12:449:27017:16:16:72:535:570:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:under which one agent transfers resources to another one. In principle, it can be created
12:450:27106:16:16:72:535:554:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:with little cost. Now suppose that we live in a world withJphysical assets and that there
12:451:27195:16:16:72:535:538:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:areS(>J)states of the world. In this general setting, markets are incomplete. However, if
12:452:27284:16:16:72:535:522:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:consumers have homogenous tastes, endowments, and beliefs, then markets are (effectively)
12:453:27373:16:16:72:535:506:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:complete by simply adding enoughfinancialassets (in zero net supply). There is no loss of
12:454:27462:16:15:72:535:490:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:optimality and nothing will change by this action, because in equilibrium identical agents
12:455:27552:15:16:72:535:475:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:will not trade with each other. The bottom line is that the more “homogeneity” we are
12:456:27637:16:16:72:535:459:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:willing to assume among consumers, the less demanding the complete markets assumption
12:457:27722:16:40:72:445:443:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:becomes. This point should be kept in mind as we will return to it later.

12:462:28087:16:15:72:535:322:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:environment, it is covered by Constantinides’ theorem, which requires complete markets.
12:463:28174:15:16:72:535:307:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f6:Thus, a key empirical question isthe extent to which complete markets can serve as a useful

12:465:28356:16:21:72:411:275:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the answer turns out to be more nuanced than a simple yes or no.
12:466:28420:21:16:89:534:254:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:To explain the broad variety of evidence that has been brought to bear on this question,
12:467:28508:16:16:72:539:238:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:this section is structured in the following way. First, in Section3.1,Ibeginbydiscussing
12:468:28596:16:16:72:541:222:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:alargeempiricalliteraturethathastestedakeypredictionofcompletemarkets—that
12:469:28670:16:16:72:535:206:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:marginal utility growth is equated across individuals.  This is often called “perfect” or
12:470:28759:16:16:72:544:190:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:“full” insurance, and it is soundly rejected in the data. Section3.2  discusses an alternative
12:471:28853:16:15:72:535:174:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:benchmark, inspired by this rejection.  This is the permanent income model, in which
12:472:28937:15:16:72:535:159:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:individuals have access to only borrowing and saving—or “self insurance.” In a way, this is
12:473:29028:16:16:72:535:143:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the other extreme end of the insurance spectrum. Finally, Section3.3 discusses studies that
12:474:29119:16:16:72:535:127:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:take an intermediate view—“partial insurance”—and provide some evidence to support it.
12:475:29205:16:0:72:308:111:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:We now begin with the tests of full insurance.

13:484:29542:16:16:71:534:619:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:leisure time (of husband and wife if the unit of analysis is a household), children, lagged

13:486:29696:20:16:89:535:583:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:The key implication of perfect insurance can be derived by following two distinct ap-
13:487:29781:16:16:71:534:567:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:proaches. The first environment assumes a social planner who pools all individuals’ resources
13:488:29874:16:16:71:534:551:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and maximizes a social welfare function that assigns a positive weight to every individual.
13:489:29965:16:16:71:534:535:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:In the second environment, allocations are determined in a competitive equilibrium of a
13:490:30052:16:16:71:534:519:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:frictionless economy where individuals are able to trade in a complete set of financial secu-
13:491:30145:16:16:71:534:503:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:rities. Both of these frameworks make the following strong prediction for the growth rate
13:492:30234:16:41:71:238:487:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:of individuals’ marginal utilities:

13:504:30394:16:16:72:535:402:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:condition thus says that every individual’s marginal utility must grow in locksteps with the

13:506:30573:16:16:72:535:370:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:hand side, such as idiosyncratic income shocks, unemployment, sickness, and so on. All
13:507:30659:16:16:72:535:354:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:these idiosyncratic events are perfectly insured in this world. From here one can introduce

13:510:30879:16:15:72:535:295:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:have focused on what market completeness implies for the study of aggregate phenomena
13:511:30964:15:16:72:535:280:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:in light of Constantinides’ theorem. However, complete markets also imposes restrictions

13:513:31140:16:16:72:539:248:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:For a given specification ofU,condition(1)translatesintorestrictionsontheevolutions

13:515:31307:16:16:72:535:216:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:general and flexible (e.g., include preference shifters, assume non-separability) to generate
13:516:31400:16:16:72:535:200:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:rich dynamics in cross-sectional distributions, this strategy would attribute all the action
13:517:31492:16:16:72:535:184:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:to preferences, which are essentially unobservable. Even in that case, models that are not
13:518:31582:16:16:72:535:168:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:bound by (1)—and therefore have idiosyncratic shocks affect individual allocations—can
13:519:31668:16:15:72:535:152:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:generate a much richer set of cross-sectional distributions. Whether that extra richness is
13:520:31759:15:16:72:535:137:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:necessary for explaining salient features of the data is another matter and is not always
13:521:31848:16:19:72:535:121:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:obvious (see, e.g.,Caselli and Ventura(2000),Badel and Huggett(2007), andGuvenen and

14:525:32144:21:21:89:383:675:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Now I return back to the empirical tests of condition (1).
14:526:32202:21:16:89:539:654:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:In a pioneering paper,Altug and Miller(1990)werethefirsttoformallytesttheim-

14:528:32370:16:16:71:534:622:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Beckerian utility function that included husband’s and wife’s leisure times as well as con-

14:530:32549:16:16:71:534:590:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) they could not reject full insur-

14:532:32710:15:16:71:535:559:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:set, they rejected perfect risk sharing.11Given this rejection in the whole population, they
14:533:32802:16:16:72:535:543:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:investigated if there might be better insurancewithinfamilies, who presumably have closer
14:534:32891:16:16:72:535:527:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:ties with each other than the population at large and could therefore provide insurance to
14:535:32981:16:21:72:513:511:143:g_d0_f2:64:g_d0_f4:the members in need. They found that this hypothesis too was statistically rejected.12
14:536:33067:21:16:89:540:490:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:In a similar vein,Guvenen(2007a)investigatedhowtheextentofrisksharingvaries

14:538:33233:16:16:71:534:458:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:motivated by the observation that stockholders (who made up less than 20% of the pop-
14:539:33318:16:16:71:534:442:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:ulation for much of the 20th century) own about 80% of net worth and 90% of financial
14:540:33403:16:15:71:534:426:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:wealth in the US economy, and therefore play a disproportionately large role in the deter-
14:541:33493:15:16:71:534:411:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:mination of macroeconomic aggregates. On the one hand, these wealthy individuals have
14:542:33578:16:16:71:534:395:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:access to a wide range of financial securities that can presumably allow better risk insurance;
14:543:33673:16:16:71:535:379:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:on the other hand, they are exposed to different risks not faced by the less-wealthy non-
14:544:33762:16:16:71:534:363:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:stockholders. Using data from the PSID, he strongly rejected perfect risk-sharing among
14:545:33849:16:16:71:534:347:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:stockholders, but perhaps surprisingly, did not find evidence against it among nonstockhold-
14:546:33941:16:16:71:535:331:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:ers. This finding suggests further focus on risk factors that primarily affect the wealthy, such
14:547:34037:16:21:71:524:315:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:as entrepreneurial income risk that is concentrated at the top of the wealth distribution.

14:559:35121:9:15:81:534:144:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:11Datasets such as the PSID are known to go through regular revisions, which might be able to account
14:560:35222:15:8:71:298:129:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:for the discrepancy between the two papers’ results.
14:561:35274:8:16:81:534:121:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:12This finding has implications for the modeling of the household decision-making process as a unitary

15:576:36376:16:16:72:535:463:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:error in particular) that affects Mace’s results. Nelson showed that a more careful treatment
15:577:36469:16:21:72:282:447:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:of these issues results in strong rejection.
15:578:36513:21:15:89:535:426:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Cochrane(1991) raised a different point. He argued that studies, such as Mace’s, that
15:579:36598:15:16:72:535:411:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:test risk sharing by examining the response of consumption growth to income may have
15:580:36682:16:16:72:535:395:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:low power if income changes are (at least partly) anticipated by individuals. He instead
15:581:36770:16:16:72:535:379:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:proposed to use idiosyncratic events that are arguably harder to predict, such as plant
15:582:36857:16:16:72:535:363:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:closures, long strikes, long illnesses, and so on. Cochrane rejected full insurance for illness
15:583:36952:16:16:72:535:347:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:or involuntary job loss but not for long spells of unemployment, strikes or involuntary moves.
15:584:37046:16:16:72:535:331:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Notice that a crucial assumption in all of the work of this kind is that none of these shocks
15:585:37139:16:21:72:496:315:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:can be correlated with unmeasured factors that determine marginal utility growth.
15:586:37220:21:16:89:538:294:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Townsend(1994)testedforrisksharinginvillageeconomiesofIndiaandconcludedthat
15:587:37295:16:15:72:535:278:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:although the model was statistically rejected, full insurance provided a surprisingly good
15:588:37385:15:16:72:535:263:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:benchmark. Specifically, he found that individual consumption comoves with village-level
15:589:37473:16:21:72:514:247:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:consumption and is not influenced much by own income, sickness, and unemployment.
15:590:37554:21:16:89:540:226:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Attanasio and Davis(1996)observethatequation(2)mustalsoholdformulti-year

15:592:37713:16:16:72:535:194:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:for example, that even if one group of individuals experience faster income growth relative
15:593:37804:16:21:72:535:178:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:to another group during a ten year period, their consumption growth must be the same.

15:595:37995:9:15:81:534:148:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:14Because individual wages are measured with (often substantial) error in micro survey datasets, an OLS
15:596:38098:15:12:71:535:133:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:estimation of this regression would suffer from attenuation bias, which may lead to a failure to reject full
15:597:38206:12:12:71:535:121:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:insurance even when it is false. The papers discussed here employ different approaches to deal with this issue
15:598:38316:12:12:71:534:109:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:(such as using an Instrumental Variables regression or averaging across groups to average out measurement

16:601:38497:0:16:72:535:696:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:The substantial rise in the education premium in the United States (i.e., the wages of
16:602:38583:16:16:72:535:680:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:college graduates relative to high school graduates) throughout the 1980’s provided a key
16:603:38672:16:16:72:535:664:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:test of perfect risk sharing. Contrary to this hypothesis, they found that the consumption
16:604:38762:16:16:72:535:648:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:of college graduates grew much faster than that of high school graduates during the same
16:605:38850:16:21:72:339:632:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:period, violating the premise of perfect risk sharing.

16:610:39248:15:16:72:535:548:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:using self-reported measures of risk attitudes from the Health and Retirement Survey, he
16:611:39336:16:16:72:535:532:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:establishes such a correlation.  Then he develops a method to deal with this bias and,
16:612:39422:16:16:72:535:516:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:applying the corrected regression, he finds that consumption growth responds very weakly
16:613:39510:16:16:72:535:500:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:to idiosyncratic shocks, implying much larger risk sharing than found in these previous
16:614:39597:16:16:72:534:484:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:papers. He also shows that the coefficients estimated from this regression can be mapped
16:615:39685:16:30:72:261:468:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:into a measure of “partial insurance.”

16:617:39805:16:16:72:535:422:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:pirical studies agree that perfect insurance in the whole population is strongly rejected in

16:620:40063:16:16:72:535:374:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:there seem to be a fair deal of insurance against certain types of shocks, as documented by
16:621:40154:16:16:72:535:358:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Cochrane(1991)andTownsend(1994), and among certain groups of households, such as
16:622:40234:16:15:72:534:342:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:in some villages in less developed countries (Townsend(1994)), or among non-stockholders
16:623:40322:15:16:72:534:327:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:in the United States (Guvenen(2007a)). Second, the reviewed empirical evidence arguably
16:624:40409:16:16:72:535:311:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:documents statistical tests of an extreme benchmark (equation (1)) that we should not
16:625:40494:16:16:72:535:295:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:expect to hold precisely—for every household, against every shock.  Thus, with a large
16:626:40580:16:16:72:535:279:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:enough sample, statistical rejection should not be surprising.16What these tests do not do
16:627:40670:16:16:72:535:263:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:is to tell us how “far” the economy is from the perfect insurance benchmark. In this sense,
16:628:40761:16:16:72:534:247:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:analyses such as inTownsend(1994)—that identify the types of shocks that are and are not
16:629:40849:16:16:72:534:231:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:insured—are somewhat more informative than those inAltug and Miller(1990),Hayashi

16:633:41047:28:16:72:535:137:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:The rejection of full consumption insurance led economists to search for other benchmark

16:635:41224:18:16:81:534:103:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:16One view is that hypothesis tests without an explicit alternative (such as the ones discussed here) often

17:658:41702:16:16:72:535:418:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:of evidence to bear. They began by documenting two empirical facts. Using micro data
17:659:41786:16:15:72:535:402:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:from the United States, United Kingdom, and Taiwan, they first documented that within-
17:660:41872:15:16:72:535:387:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:cohort inequality of labor income (as measured by the variance of log income) increases
17:661:41959:16:16:72:535:371:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:substantially and almost linearly over the life cycle. Second, they documented that within-
17:662:42050:16:16:72:535:355:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:cohort consumption inequality showed a very similar pattern and also rose substantially as
17:663:42140:16:16:72:535:339:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:individuals age. The two empirical facts are replicated in figure1 from data inGuvenen
17:664:42226:16:21:71:150:323:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:(2007b, 2009a).
17:665:42241:21:16:89:535:302:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:To understand what these patterns imply for the market structure, first consider a com-
17:666:42328:16:16:71:534:286:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:plete markets economy. As we saw in the previous section, if consumption is separable from
17:667:42418:16:16:71:534:270:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:leisure and other potential determinants of marginal utility, consumption growth will be
17:668:42506:16:15:71:535:254:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:equalized across individuals, independent of any idiosyncratic shock (equation (2)). There-
17:669:42597:15:16:71:535:239:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:fore, while consumption level may differ across individuals due to differences in permanent
17:670:42688:16:16:71:535:223:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:lifetime resources, this dispersion shouldnotchange as the cohort ages.17Therefore,Deaton
17:671:42777:16:16:72:535:207:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and Paxson(1994)’s evidence has typically been interpreted as contradicting the complete
17:672:42865:16:16:72:308:191:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:markets framework. I now turn to the details.
17:673:42910:16:15:81:534:175:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:17There are two obvious modifications that preserve complete markets and would be consistent with rising
17:674:43014:15:12:71:534:160:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:consumption inequality. The first one is to introduce heterogeneity in time discounting. This is not very
17:675:43119:12:12:71:534:148:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:appealing because it “explains” by entirely relying on unobservable preference heterogeneity. Second, one
17:676:43224:12:12:71:534:136:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:could question the assumption of separability: if leisure is non-separable and wage inequality is rising over
17:677:43333:12:12:71:534:124:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:the life cycle—which it does—then consumption inequality would also rise to keep marginal utility growth
17:678:43437:12:12:71:534:112:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:constant (even under complete markets). But this explanation also predicts that hours inequality should
17:679:43540:12:12:71:535:100:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:also rise over the life cycle, a prediction that does not seem to be borne out in the data—although seeBadel

18:683:43830:16:16:72:535:651:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:model, in which individuals have only access to a risk-free asset for borrowing and saving.
18:684:43921:16:15:72:535:635:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Therefore, as opposed to full insurance, there is only “self-insurance” in this framework.
18:685:44011:15:16:72:535:620:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Whereas the complete markets framework represents the maximum amount of insurance,
18:686:44093:16:16:72:535:604:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the permanent income model arguably provides the lower bound on insurance (to the extent

18:722:45182:16:16:71:535:183:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:being that the response of consumption to transitory shocks is very weak given their low

19:752:47233:16:16:72:535:302:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:However, a number of recent papers have revisited the original Deaton-Paxson finding and
19:753:47321:16:27:72:253:286:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:have reached a different conclusion.

19:756:47521:16:16:72:535:228:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:but each uses a data set that extends the original CE sample used by these authors (that

20:765:48273:16:16:71:535:680:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Paxson(1994)’s earlier conclusion is not robust to small changes in the sample period
20:766:48358:16:16:71:534:664:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:studied. Although more work on this topic certainly seems warranted,19these recent studies
20:767:48448:16:16:71:534:648:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:raise substantial concerns on one of the key pieces of empirical evidence on the extent of
20:768:48538:16:16:71:534:632:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:market incompleteness. A small rise in consumption inequality is hard to reconcile with
20:769:48625:16:16:71:535:616:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the combination of large permanent shocksandself-insurance. Hence, if this latter view
20:770:48711:16:16:71:534:600:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:is correct, either income shocks are not as permanent as we thought or there is insurance
20:771:48800:16:28:71:476:584:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:above and beyond self-insurance. Both of these possibilities are discussed next.

20:775:49089:16:16:72:534:498:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:of insurance (e.g., through charities, help from family and relatives, etc.)in additionto

20:777:49272:16:19:72:506:466:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:is the case, is there a way to properly measure the degree of this “partial insurance”?
20:778:49359:19:16:89:539:447:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:To address this question,Blundell et al.(2008)examinetheresponseofconsumptionto

21:807:51718:16:16:71:534:616:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:predicts that even with self insurance the response to permanent shocks, given by⇡i,t, will

21:809:51895:16:16:72:535:584:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:due to precautionary savings or retirement can dampen the response of consumption to

21:817:52498:16:16:72:535:446:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:finding—that income movements are largely “anticipated” by the individuals as opposed to
21:818:52586:16:15:72:535:430:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:being genuine permanent “shocks.” As has been observed as far back asHall and Mishkin
21:819:52671:15:16:72:535:415:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:(1982), this alternative interpretation illustrates a fundamental challenge with this kind of
21:820:52764:16:16:72:535:399:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:analysis: advance information and partial insurance are difficult to disentangle by simply

21:823:52975:16:16:72:534:340:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:issues regarding the interpretation of✓. First, they ask, what if income shocks are per-
21:824:53063:16:16:72:535:324:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:sistent but not permanent? This is a relevant question because, as I discuss in the next
21:825:53151:16:16:72:535:308:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:section, nearly all empirical studies that estimate the persistence coefficient (of an AR(1)
21:826:53243:16:15:72:535:292:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:or ARMA(1,1)) find it to be 0.95 or lower—sometimes as low as 0.7. To explore this is-
21:827:53329:15:16:72:535:277:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:sue, they simulate data from a life cycle model with self insurance only, in which income
21:828:53418:16:16:72:535:261:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:shocks follow an AR(1) process with a first order autocorrelation of 0.95. They show that
21:829:53507:16:16:72:535:245:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:when they estimate✓as inBlundell et al.(2008), they find it to be close to the 2/3 figure
21:830:53596:16:16:71:535:229:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:reported by these authors.22Second, they add a retirement period to the lifecycle model,
21:831:53684:16:16:72:535:213:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:which has the effect that now even a unit root shock is not permanent, given that its effect
21:832:53776:16:16:72:535:197:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:does not translate one for one into the retirement period. Thus, individuals have even more
21:833:53867:16:16:72:535:181:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:reason not to respond to permanent shocks, especially when they are closer to retirement.
21:834:53956:16:16:72:534:165:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Overall, their findings suggest that the response coefficient of consumption to income can
21:835:54046:16:17:72:536:149:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:be generated in a model of pure self-insurance to the extent that income shocks are allowed
21:836:54137:17:16:81:534:132:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:22The reason is simple. Because the AR(1) shock decays exponentially, this shock loses 5% of its value
21:837:54239:16:12:71:535:116:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:in one year, but1-0.9510⇡40%in 10 years and65%in 20 years. Thus, the discounted lifetime value of
21:838:54336:12:0:72:534:104:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:such a shock is significantly lower than a permanent shock which retains 100% of its value at all horizons.
22:839:54445:0:16:72:535:696:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:to be slightly less than permanent.23One feature this model misses, however, is the age
22:840:54532:16:16:72:535:680:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:profile of response coefficients, which shows no clear trend in the data according toBlundell
22:841:54625:16:31:72:458:664:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:et al.(2008), but is upward sloping inKaplan and Violante(2010)’s model.

22:851:55465:16:15:71:534:490:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:idiosyncratic risk. The more recent evidence, discussed in this subsection, however, sug-
22:852:55554:15:16:71:534:475:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:gests that a more appropriate benchmark needs to incorporate either more opportunities
22:853:55640:16:40:71:462:459:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:for partial insurance or idiosyncratic risk that is smaller than once assumed.

22:855:55756:33:16:72:535:386:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:This section and the next discuss incomplete markets models in general equilibrium without
22:856:55846:16:16:72:535:370:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:aggregate shocks. Bringing in a general equilibrium structure allows researchers to jointly
22:857:55937:16:16:72:535:354:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:analyze aggregate and distributional issues. As we shall see, the two are often intertwined,
22:858:56029:16:16:72:535:338:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:making such models very useful.  The present section discusses the key ingredients that
22:859:56116:16:15:72:535:322:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:go into building a general equilibrium incomplete markets model (e.g., types of risks to
22:860:56204:15:16:72:535:307:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:consider, borrowing limits, modeling individuals versus households, among others). The
22:861:56290:16:16:72:535:291:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:next section presents three broad questions that these models have been used to address: the

22:863:56473:16:16:72:535:259:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:important questions and constitute an entry point into broader literatures. I now begin
22:864:56560:16:34:72:288:243:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:with a description of the basic framework.

22:869:56905:15:16:72:534:133:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:which were subsequently solved byKrusell and Smith(1998). She used this framework to

23:873:57236:0:16:72:535:696:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:only a slightly higher figure than Lucas’, mainly because of her focus unemployment risk,
23:874:57325:16:16:72:535:680:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:which typically has a short duration in the United States.24Regardless of its empirical

23:879:57746:16:16:72:535:595:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:there is ex post heterogeneity due to idiosyncratic shocks to labor productivity which are
23:880:57836:16:16:72:535:579:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:not directly insurable (via insurance contracts).  However, consumers can accumulate a

23:908:59361:16:15:81:534:179:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:24There is a large literature on the costs of business cycles following Lucas’ original calculation. I do
23:909:59466:15:12:71:535:164:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:not discuss these papers here for brevity.Lucas(2003)’s presidential address to the American Economic
23:910:59567:12:12:71:534:152:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:Association is an extensive survey of this literature that also discusses how Lucas’ views on this issue evolved
23:911:59679:12:9:71:199:140:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:since the original 1987 paper.
23:912:59709:9:15:81:534:131:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:25Prior to Aiyagari, the decision problem described here was studied in various forms by, among others,
23:913:59812:15:12:71:535:116:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:Schechtman and Escudero(1977),Bewley(undated),Flavin(1981),Hall and Mishkin(1982),Clarida(1987,
23:914:59907:12:12:71:535:104:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:1990),Deaton(1991), andCarroll(1991). With the exceptions ofBewley(undated)andClarida(1987,
23:915:59998:12:12:71:534:92:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:1990), however, most of these earlier papers did not consider general equilibrium, which is the main focus
23:916:60104:12:0:71:92:80:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:here.
24:917:60111:0:16:89:535:696:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:The main substantive finding inAiyagari(1994) is that with incomplete markets, the
24:918:60193:16:16:71:535:680:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:aggregate capital stock is higher than it is with complete markets, although the difference
24:919:60284:16:16:71:534:664:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:is not quantitatively very large.  Consequently, the interest rate is lower (than the time
24:920:60374:16:16:71:534:648:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:preference rate), which is also true inHuggett(1993)’s exchange economy version. This
24:921:60459:16:16:71:534:632:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:latter finding initially led economists to conjecture that these models could help explain the
24:922:60553:16:16:71:535:616:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:equity premium puzzle,26which is also generated by a low interest rate. It turned out that
24:923:60643:16:16:72:534:600:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:while this environment helps, it is neither necessary nor sufficient to generate a low interest
24:924:60738:16:16:72:534:584:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:rate. I return to this issue later.Aiyagari(1994) also shows that the model generates the
24:925:60827:16:15:71:535:568:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:right ranking between different types of inequality: wealth is more dispersed than income,
24:926:60917:15:21:71:292:553:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:which is more dispersed than consumption.

24:929:61113:16:16:71:534:500:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:stract from many ingredients that would be essential today for conducting serious empir-
24:930:61201:16:16:71:534:484:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:ical/quantitative work, especially given that almost two decades have passed since their
24:931:61289:16:16:71:534:468:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:publication. In the next three subsections, I review three main directions the framework
24:932:61377:16:16:71:534:452:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:can be extended. First, the nature of idiosyncratic risk is often crucial for the implications
24:933:61471:16:16:71:534:436:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:generated by the model. There is a fair bit of controversy about the precise nature and
24:934:61558:16:15:71:534:420:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:magnitude of such risks, which I discuss in some detail. Second, and as I alluded to above,
24:935:61649:15:16:71:534:405:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the treatment of borrowing constraints is very reduced form here. The recent literature has
24:936:61740:16:16:71:534:389:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:made significant progress in providing useful micro-foundations for a richer specification of
24:937:61833:16:16:71:534:373:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:borrowing limits. Third, the Huggett-Aiyagari model considers an economy populated by
24:938:61918:16:16:71:534:357:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:bachelor(ette)s as opposed to families—this distinction clearly can have a big impact on
24:939:62006:16:41:71:293:341:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:economic decisions, which is also discussed.

24:943:62271:16:16:72:534:239:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Lillard and Willis(1978)), a consensus among researchers on the nature of labor income risk
24:944:62362:16:16:72:535:223:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:still remains elusive. In particular, the literature in the 1980s and 1990s produced two—
24:945:62451:16:17:72:535:207:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:quite opposite—views on the subject. To provide context, consider this general specification
24:946:62543:17:16:81:538:190:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:26The equity premium puzzle ofMehra and Prescott(1985)istheobservationthatinthehistoricaldata
24:947:62636:16:12:72:535:174:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:stocks yield a much higher return than bonds over long horizons, which has turned out to be very difficult
24:948:62742:12:8:72:279:162:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:to explain by a wide range of economic models.
24:949:62788:8:0:81:332:154:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:27The exposition here draws heavily onGuvenen(2009a).

25:973:63347:16:16:72:535:533:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Income Profiles” (HIP) model, individuals are subject to shocks with modest persistence,
25:974:63435:16:16:72:535:517:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:while facing life-cycle profiles that are individual-specific (and hence vary significantly across
25:975:63533:16:15:72:535:501:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the population).  As we will see in the next section, one theoretical motivation for this
25:976:63622:15:16:72:535:486:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:specification is the human capital model, which implies differences in income profiles if, for
25:977:63716:16:20:72:315:470:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:example, individuals differ in their ability level.

25:982:64087:16:15:71:534:386:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:to this alternative view, which I shall call the “Restricted Income Profiles” (RIP) model,
25:983:64177:15:16:71:534:371:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:individuals are subject to extremely persistent—nearly random walk—shocks, while facing
25:984:64264:16:29:71:237:355:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:similar life-cycle income profiles.

25:987:64459:16:16:71:534:294:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the lack of rejection does not contain much information about whether or not there is growth
25:988:64551:16:16:71:534:278:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:rate heterogeneity. MaCurdy’s test was generally regarded as the strongest evidence against
25:989:64642:16:15:71:535:262:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the HIP specification, and it was repeated in different forms by several subsequent papers

28:1085:70729:21:16:89:535:659:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Studying economic choices to disentangle risk from heterogeneity has many advantages.
28:1086:70814:16:16:71:534:643:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Perhaps most importantly, it allows researchers to bring a much broader set of data to
28:1087:70900:16:16:71:535:627:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:bear on the question. For example, many dynamic choices require individuals to carefully
28:1088:70988:16:16:71:535:611:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:weigh the different future risks they perceive against predictable changes before making a
28:1089:71078:16:16:71:534:595:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:commitment. Decisions on home purchases, fertility, college attendance, retirement savings,
28:1090:71169:16:16:71:534:579:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and so on are all of this sort. At the same time, this line of research also faces important
28:1091:71261:16:15:71:534:563:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:challenges: these analyses need to rely on a fully-specified economic model, so the results
28:1092:71352:15:16:71:534:548:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:can be sensitive to assumptions regarding the market structure, specification of preferences,
28:1093:71445:16:16:71:535:532:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and so on. Therefore, experimenting with different assumptions is essential before a defini-
28:1094:71537:16:16:71:534:516:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:tive conclusion can be reached with this approach. Overall, this represents a difficult but
28:1095:71628:16:34:71:318:500:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:potentially very fruitful area for future research.

28:1100:71990:16:15:72:535:389:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:are due to local or regional factors and are substantial (as the latest housing market crash
28:1101:72082:15:16:72:534:374:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:showed once again). So these fluctuations can have profound effects on individuals’ eco-

29:1122:73836:16:16:72:535:664:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:means-tested social insurance programs are especially important to account for in order to
29:1123:73926:16:21:72:398:648:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:understand the very low savings rate of low-income individuals.

29:1126:74156:16:16:72:535:595:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:called AHEAD, which is part of the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) conducted by the
29:1127:74242:16:16:72:535:579:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:University of Michigan, which allows them to characterize medical expenditure risk for the
29:1128:74332:16:15:72:535:563:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:elderly (even for those in their 90’s) more precisely than previous studies, such asHubbard
29:1129:74423:15:16:72:535:548:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:et al.(1995)andPalumbo(1999).30De Nardi et al. find out-of-pocket expenditures to rise
29:1130:74509:16:16:72:535:532:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:dramatically at very old ages, which (in their estimated model) provides an explanation for
29:1131:74600:16:16:72:534:516:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the lack of significant dissaving by the elderly.Ozkan(2010) shows that the lifecycle profile
29:1132:74693:16:16:72:535:500:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:of medical costs (inclusive of the costs paid by private and public insurers to providers)
29:1133:74783:16:16:72:535:484:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:differ significantly between rich and poor households. In particular, on average, the medical
29:1134:74876:16:16:72:535:468:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:expenses of the rich are higher than that of the poor until mid-life, after which the expenses
29:1135:74970:16:16:72:535:452:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:of the poor exceed those of the rich—by 25% in absolute terms. Further, the expenses of the
29:1136:75061:16:16:72:535:436:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:poor have thick tails—lots of individuals with zero expenses and many with catastrophically
29:1137:75152:16:15:72:535:420:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:high costs. He builds a model in which individuals can invest in their health (i.e., preventive
29:1138:75247:15:16:72:535:405:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:care), which affects the future distribution of health shocks and, consequently, the expected
29:1139:75340:16:16:72:535:389:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:life time. High-income individuals do precisely this, which explains their higher spending
29:1140:75430:16:16:72:535:373:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:early on. Low-income individuals do the opposite, which ends up costing more later in life.
29:1141:75521:16:16:72:535:357:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:He concludes that a reform of the health care system that encourages use of health care

31:1227:82597:16:16:72:535:129:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:dogenous outcome (Pijoan-Mas(2006),Domeij and Floden(2006),Heathcote et al.(2008),
31:1228:82679:16:16:71:534:113:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:among others). While this is a useful step forward, a lot of the dispersion in earnings before
31:1229:82773:16:16:71:534:97:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:age 55 is due to wages and not hours, so the assumption of an exogenous wage process
31:1230:82857:16:0:71:534:81:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:still leaves quite a bit to be understood. Other strands of the literature attempt to close
32:1231:82950:0:16:72:535:696:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:this gap by writing models that also generate wage dispersion as an endogenous outcome in
32:1232:83039:16:16:72:534:680:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the model—for example, due to human capital accumulation (e.g.,Guvenen and Kuruscu
32:1233:83121:16:34:72:495:664:143:g_d0_f2:64:g_d0_f4:(2009,forthcoming), andHuggett et al.(forthcoming)) or due to search frictions.31
32:1234:83202:34:29:72:275:630:206:g_d0_f11:206:g_d0_f11:5.1  Consumption Inequality
32:1235:83229:29:16:72:535:601:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Two different dimensions of consumption inequality has received attention in the literature.
32:1236:83321:16:16:72:535:585:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:The first one concerns how much within-cohort consumption inequality increases over the
32:1237:83408:16:16:72:535:569:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:lifecycle. The different views on this question has been summarized in Section3.2  .32The
32:1238:83497:16:16:71:534:553:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:second one concerns whether, and by how much, (overall) consumption inequality has risen
32:1239:83585:16:15:71:534:537:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:in the United States since the 1970s, a question whose urgency was raised by the substantial
32:1240:83677:15:16:71:534:522:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:rise in wage inequality during the same time. In one of the earliest papers on this topic,
32:1241:83767:16:16:71:535:506:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Cutler and Katz(1992) used data from the 1980s on US households from the Consumer
32:1242:83848:16:16:71:534:490:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Expenditure Survey (CE) and found that the evolution of consumption inequality closely
32:1243:83934:16:16:71:534:474:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:tracked the rise in wage inequality during the same time. This finding served as a rejection
32:1244:84026:16:16:71:535:458:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:of earlier claims in the literature (e.g.,Jencks(1984)) that the rise of means tested in-
32:1245:84115:16:16:71:534:442:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:kind transfers starting in the 1970s had improved the material well-being of low income
32:1246:84202:16:21:71:436:426:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:households relative to what would be judged by their income statistics.
32:1247:84273:21:16:89:535:405:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Interest in this question was reignited more recently by a thought-provoking paper by
32:1248:84358:16:15:71:534:389:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Krueger and Perri(2006), who concluded from an analysis of CE data that, from 1980 to
32:1249:84443:15:16:71:535:374:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:2003,within-groupincome inequality increased substantially more than within-group con-
32:1250:84529:16:16:71:535:358:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:sumption inequality (in contrast, they found thatbetween-groupincome and consumption
32:1251:84613:16:16:71:535:342:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:inequality tracked each other).33They then proposed an explanation based on the premise
32:1252:84700:16:16:72:535:326:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:that the development of financial services in the US economy has helped households smooth
32:1253:84789:16:21:72:349:310:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:consumption fluctuations relative to income variation.
32:1254:84843:21:16:89:534:289:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:To investigate this story, they applied a model of endogenous debt constraints as in
32:1255:84927:16:16:72:534:273:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Kehoe and Levine(1993).  In this class of models, what is central is not the ability of
32:1256:85014:16:18:72:535:257:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:households to pay back their debt, but rather it is their incentives or willingness to pay
32:1257:85104:18:15:81:534:239:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:31The search literature is very large with many interesting models to cover. I do not discuss these models
32:1258:85210:15:12:71:534:224:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:here because I cannot do justice to this extensive body of work in this limited space. For an excellent survey,
32:1259:85321:12:12:71:534:212:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:see Rogerson et al.(2005). Note, however, that asHornstein et al.(forthcoming) show, search models have
32:1260:85424:12:8:72:409:200:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:trouble generating the magnitudes of wage dispersion we observe in the data.
32:1261:85500:8:16:81:535:192:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:32Another recent paper is of interest isAguiar and Hurst(2008), who examine the lifecycle mean and
32:1262:85598:16:12:71:534:176:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:variance profiles of the subcomponents of consumption—housing, utility bills, clothing, food at home, food
32:1263:85704:12:12:71:534:164:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:away from home, etc.  They show rich patterns that vary across categories, whereby the variance rises
32:1264:85805:12:12:71:534:152:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:monotonically for some categories, while being hump-shaped for others, and yet declining monotonically
32:1265:85907:12:12:71:534:140:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:for some others. The same patterns are observed for the mean profile. These disaggregated facts provide
32:1266:86010:12:8:71:233:128:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:more food for thought to researchers.
32:1267:86047:8:16:81:535:120:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:33Attanasio et al.(2007) have questioned the use of the CE Interview survey and argued that some
32:1268:86143:16:12:72:535:104:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:expenditure items are poorly measured in the survey relative to another component of CE, called the
32:1269:86242:12:12:72:535:92:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:diary survey. They propose an optimal way of combining the two survey data and find that consumption
32:1270:86342:12:0:72:535:80:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:inequality, especially in the 1990s has increased more than what is revealed by the Interview survey alone.
33:1271:86451:0:16:72:535:696:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:back. To give the right incentives, lenders can punish a borrower that defaults, for example,
33:1272:86544:16:16:72:535:680:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:by banning her from financial markets forever (autarky). However, if the individual borrows
33:1273:86635:16:16:72:534:664:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:too much or if autarky is not sufficiently costly, it may still make sense to default in certain
33:1274:86731:16:16:72:535:648:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:states of the world. Thus, given the parameters of the economic environment, lenders will
33:1275:86820:16:16:72:535:632:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:compute the optimal state-contingent debt limit, which will ensure that the borrower never
33:1276:86910:16:16:72:539:616:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:defaults in equilibrium.Krueger and Perri(2006)noticethatifincomeshocksarereally
33:1277:86990:16:16:72:535:600:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:volatile, then autarky is a really bad outcome, giving borrowers less incentive to default.
33:1278:87081:16:16:72:535:584:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Lenders who know this, in turn, are more willing to lend, which endogenously loosens the
33:1279:87169:16:15:72:535:568:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:borrowing constraints. This view of the last 30 years thus holds that the rise in the volatility
33:1280:87265:15:16:72:535:553:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:of income shocks gave rise to the development of financial markets (more generous lending),
33:1281:87356:16:21:72:393:537:143:g_d0_f2:64:g_d0_f4:which in turn led to a smaller rise in consumption inequality.34
33:1282:87420:21:16:89:540:516:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Heathcote et al.(2007)arguethatthesmallriseinconsumptioninequalitycanbe
33:1283:87491:16:16:71:534:500:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:explained simply if the rise in income shocks have been of more transitory nature, since such
33:1284:87584:16:16:71:535:484:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:shocks are easier to smooth through self insurance. Indeed,Blundell and Preston(1998)
33:1285:87669:16:16:71:534:468:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:earlier made the same observation to conclude that in the 1980s the rise in income shock
33:1286:87757:16:16:71:534:452:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:variance was mostly permanent in nature (evidenced by the observation that income and
33:1287:87842:16:16:71:534:436:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:consumption inequality grew together) whereas in the 1990s, it was mostly transitory given
33:1288:87932:16:15:71:539:420:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the opposite was true.Heathcote et al.(2007)calibrateafullyspecifiedmodelandshow
33:1289:88012:15:16:71:534:405:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:that it can go a long way towards explaining the observed trends in consumption inequality.
33:1290:88103:16:16:71:534:389:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:One point to keep in mind is that that these papers take as given that the volatility of
33:1291:88191:16:16:71:534:373:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:income shocks rose during this period, a conclusion that is subject to uncertainty in light
33:1292:88282:16:21:71:259:357:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:of the new evidence discussed above.
33:1293:88318:21:16:89:535:336:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Before concluding, a word of caution about measurement. The appropriate price deflator
33:1294:88404:16:16:71:535:320:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:for consumption may have trended differently for households in different parts of the income
33:1295:88496:16:16:71:535:304:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:distribution (i.e., the “Walmart effect” at the lower end). To the extent that this effect is
33:1296:88589:16:15:71:534:288:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:real, the measured trend in consumption inequality could be overstating the actual rise in
33:1297:88679:15:35:71:490:273:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the dispersion of material well-being. This issue still deserves a fuller exploration.

33:1299:88787:28:16:72:535:210:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:The main question about wealth inequality is a cross-sectional one: Why do we observe
33:1300:88872:16:16:72:535:194:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:such enormous disparities in wealth, with a Gini coefficient of about 0.8 for net worth and

33:1306:89352:12:12:72:535:95:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:that consumption inequality tracked income inequality closely in the past 30 years. Although this is still

34:1309:89604:16:16:71:534:680:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:typically use one (or more) of three mechanisms to produce this inequality: (1) dispersion
34:1310:89694:16:16:71:534:664:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:in luck in the form of large and persistent shocks to labor productivity: the rich are luckier
34:1311:89788:16:16:71:534:648:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:than the poor; (2) dispersion in patience or thriftiness: the rich save more than the poor;
34:1312:89879:16:16:71:534:632:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and (3) dispersion in rates of return: the rich face higher asset returns than the poor. This

34:1319:90432:16:15:71:535:507:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:that although the model can match the Gini coefficient for wealth in the United States,
34:1320:90519:15:16:71:534:492:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:this comes from low income households holding too little wealth, rather than the extreme
34:1321:90607:16:16:71:534:476:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:concentration of wealth at the top in the US economy. Moreover, whereas in the US data the
34:1322:90697:16:16:71:534:460:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:dispersion of wealth within each cohort is nearly as large as the dispersion across cohorts,
34:1323:90789:16:20:71:309:444:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the model understates the former significantly.

34:1328:91178:16:16:71:534:360:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:labor supply decision. As for the stochastic process for earnings, they do not calibrate its

34:1333:91622:16:16:71:534:281:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:implies that individuals must receive a large positive shock (about 1060 times the median
34:1334:91711:16:16:71:534:265:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:income level) with a small probability. This high income level is also very fleeting—it lasts
34:1335:91804:16:16:71:534:249:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:for about 5 years—which leads these high income individuals to save substantially (for
34:1336:91890:16:29:71:391:233:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:consumption smoothing) and results in high wealth inequality.

34:1338:92036:16:16:71:534:188:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:ity could result from a combination of: (1) random heterogeneity in lifetime incomes across
34:1339:92127:16:16:71:534:172:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:generations, and (2) altruistic bequests, which are constrained to be non-negative. Each

34:1341:92303:16:15:71:534:140:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and, unlike in the Aiyagari model, faces no further shocks to income during his lifetime. In
34:1342:92395:15:18:71:534:125:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:essence, in Laitner’s model only households who earn higher than average lifetime income

35:1379:93309:16:16:72:535:450:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:altruistic motive makes these households effectively more thrifty (compared to those who
35:1380:93397:16:16:72:535:434:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:earn below average income) since they also care about future utility. Thus even small dif-
35:1381:93487:16:16:72:535:418:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:ferences in lifetime income can result in large differences in savings rates—a fact empirically

35:1385:93812:16:16:72:534:350:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:exogenously.36Being more parsimonious, the stochastic-beta model also allows for the

35:1393:94438:16:16:71:534:212:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:in a risk-free bond, but restricts one group of agents from accumulating capital.Quadrini

35:1395:94612:16:16:72:535:180:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:workers, which can also generate skewed wealth distributions. The mechanisms have similar
35:1396:94701:16:21:72:535:164:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:flavors: agents who face higher returns end up accumulating substantial amount of wealth.
35:1397:94790:21:16:89:535:143:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:The basic mechanism inGuvenen(2006) can be described as follows. Non-stockholders
35:1398:94871:16:18:72:535:127:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:have a precautionary demand for wealth (bonds), but the only way they can save is if stock-

35:1400:95064:16:12:72:535:93:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:growth rate. I will continue with this convention, except when I specifically refer to the Krusell-Smith model
35:1401:95174:12:0:72:319:81:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:which has come to be known as a stochastic-beta model.
36:1402:95230:0:16:72:535:696:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:holders are willing to borrow. In contrast, stockholders have access to capital accumulation,
36:1403:95323:16:16:72:535:680:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:so they could smooth consumption even if the bond market was completely shut down. Fur-
36:1404:95410:16:16:72:535:664:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:thermore, non-stockholders’ asset demand is even more inelastic because they are assumed
36:1405:95498:16:16:72:535:648:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:to have a lower elasticity of intertemporal substitution (consistent with empirical evidence)
36:1406:95591:16:16:72:535:632:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and therefore have a strong desire for consumption smoothing. Therefore, trading bonds
36:1407:95677:16:16:72:535:616:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:for consumption smoothing is more important for non-stockholders than it is for stockhold-
36:1408:95767:16:16:72:535:600:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:ers. As a result, stockholders will only trade in the bond market if they can borrow at
36:1409:95854:16:16:72:535:584:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:a low interest rate. This low interest rate in turn dampens non-stockholders’ demand for
36:1410:95942:16:15:72:535:568:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:savings further, and they end up with little wealth in equilibrium (and stockholders end
36:1411:96030:15:16:72:535:553:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:up borrowing very little).Guvenen(2009b) shows that a calibrated version of this model
36:1412:96116:16:16:72:535:537:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:easily generates the extremely skewed distribution of the relative wealth of stockholders to

36:1415:96321:15:16:72:535:475:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:discussed so far can be explained using variations of a diagram used byAiyagari(1994).

36:1419:96665:16:16:71:534:411:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:curve is for the patient agent. A well-known feature of incomplete markets models is that the
36:1420:96758:16:16:71:534:395:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:asset demand schedule is very flat for values of returns that are close to the time preference

36:1422:96933:16:16:72:535:363:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:to their respective time preference rates (with⌘patient<⌘impatient).37Ifthe equilibrium

36:1424:97110:16:15:72:535:331:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:to⌘patient, the high sensitivity of asset demands to interest rates will generate substantial

36:1426:97253:21:16:89:535:295:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Similarly, the right panel shows the mechanism in the limited participation model, which
36:1427:97341:16:16:72:535:279:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:has a similar flavor. For simplicity, let us focus on the case where stockholders and non-
36:1428:97431:16:16:72:535:263:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:stockholders have the same preferences and face the same portfolio constraints. We have

36:1431:97677:16:16:71:534:215:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:that a large wealth inequality is not a foregone conclusion in any of these models. If returns

36:1434:97912:21:16:89:535:163:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:While the mechanics described here may appear quite similar for the three models,
36:1435:97993:16:16:71:534:147:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:their substantive implications differ in crucial ways.  For example, consider the effect of
36:1436:98084:16:16:71:535:131:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:eliminating aggregate shocks from all three models.  InGuvenen(2006), there will be
36:1437:98167:16:18:71:534:115:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:no equity premium without aggregate shocks and, consequently, no wealth inequality. In
36:1438:98253:18:15:81:535:97:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:37See, for example,Aiyagari(1994) and references therein. This result also holds when asset returns are
36:1439:98356:15:0:71:268:82:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:stochastic (Chamberlain and Wilson(2000)).
37:1440:98400:0:16:72:534:696:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Krusell and Smith(1998), wealth inequality will increase as the patient agent holds more of
37:1441:98491:16:16:72:535:680:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the aggregate wealth (and would own all the wealth if there were no idiosyncratic shocks). In

37:1443:98676:16:16:72:535:648:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:lifetime income risk. These dramatically different implications suggest that one can devise
37:1444:98767:16:30:72:535:632:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:methods to bring empirical evidence to bear on the relevance of these different mechanisms.

37:1450:99281:16:16:72:535:522:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:which would be confiscated in case of default. Entrepreneurs with very promising projects
37:1451:99370:16:16:72:535:506:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:thus have more to lose from default, which induces them to save more for collateral, borrow
37:1452:99461:16:15:72:535:490:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:more against it, and reach their larger optimal scale. The model is able to generate the
37:1453:99549:15:16:72:535:475:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:extreme concentration of wealth at the top of the distribution (among households many of
37:1454:99637:16:21:72:203:459:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:whom are entrepreneurs).
37:1455:99661:21:16:89:535:438:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Although this model differs from the limited participation framework in many important
37:1456:99747:16:16:72:535:422:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:ways, the differential returns to saving is a critical element for generating wealth inequality in
37:1457:99845:16:16:72:535:406:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:both models. This link could be important because many individuals in the top 1% and 5%
37:1458:99932:16:16:72:535:390:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:of the US wealth distribution hold significant amounts of stocks but are not entrepreneurs
37:1459:100022:16:16:72:535:374:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:(hold no managerial roles), which the Cagetti/De Nardi model misses. The opposite is also
37:1460:100111:16:16:72:535:358:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:true: many very rich entrepreneurs are not stockholders (outside of their own company)
37:1461:100197:16:15:72:538:342:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:which does not fit well with Guvenen’s model (seeHeaton and Lucas(2000)ontheempirical
37:1462:100282:15:16:72:535:327:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:facts about wealthy entrepreneurs and stockholders). The view that perhaps the very high
37:1463:100370:16:16:72:535:311:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:wealth holdings of these individuals is driven by the higher returns that they enjoy—either
37:1464:100461:16:35:72:535:295:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:as a stockholder or as an entrepreneur—can offer a unified theory of savings rate differences.

37:1467:100673:16:16:72:535:216:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:literature, virtually every model has implications for consumption and wealth inequality.
37:1468:100762:16:16:72:535:200:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:The same is not true for earnings inequality. Many models assume that labor supply is
37:1469:100847:16:16:72:535:184:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:inelastic and the stochastic process for wages is exogenous, making the implications for wage
37:1470:100940:16:16:72:535:168:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and earnings inequality to be mechanical reflections of the assumptions of the model. Even
37:1471:101030:16:15:72:535:152:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:if labor supply is assumed to be endogenous, many properties of the earnings distribution
37:1472:101119:15:16:72:535:137:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:(exceptions noted below) mimic those of the wage distribution.  For things to get more
37:1473:101205:16:21:72:407:121:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:interesting, it is the latter which needs to be endogenized as well.
37:1474:101273:21:16:89:535:100:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:In this section, I first review the empirical facts regarding wage inequality—both over
37:1475:101360:16:0:72:535:84:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the life cycle and over time. These facts are useful to know for practitioners since they are
38:1476:101455:0:16:72:535:696:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:commonly used as exogenous inputs into incomplete markets models. Unless specifically
38:1477:101540:16:16:72:535:680:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:mentioned, all the facts discussed here pertain to male workers, because the bulk of the
38:1478:101628:16:16:72:535:664:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:existing work is available consistently for this group.38Second, I discuss models that attempt
38:1479:101722:16:30:71:394:648:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:to endogenize wages and explain the reported facts and trends.

38:1481:101820:29:16:71:534:589:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:The main facts about the evolution of (within-cohort) earnings inequality over the lifecycle
38:1482:101912:16:16:71:535:573:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:have first been documented byDeaton and Paxson(1994) and shown in the left panel of
38:1483:101995:16:16:71:535:557:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:figure1. The same exercise has been repeated by numerous authors using different datasets
38:1484:102084:16:16:71:534:541:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:or time periods (among others,Storesletten et al.(2004b), Guvenen(2009a),Heathcote et
38:1485:102169:16:16:71:535:525:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:al.  (2010), andKaplan(2010)). While the magnitudes differ somewhat, the basic fact that
38:1486:102257:16:20:72:503:509:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:wage and earnings inequality rise substantially over the life cycle is well-established.
38:1487:102345:20:16:89:535:489:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:One view is that this fact does not require an elaborate explanation, because wages
38:1488:102428:16:16:72:535:473:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:follow a very persistent, perhaps permanent, stochastic process as implied by the RIP
38:1489:102513:16:16:72:535:457:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:model. Thus, the rising lifecycle inequality is simply a reflection of the accumulation of
38:1490:102603:16:16:72:535:441:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:such shocks, which drives up the variance of log wages in a linear fashion (in the case of
38:1491:102693:16:16:72:535:425:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:permanent shocks). I will continue to refer to this view as the RIP model because of its
38:1492:102781:16:21:72:244:409:143:g_d0_f2:64:g_d0_f4:emphasis on persistent “shocks.”39
38:1493:102815:21:16:89:535:388:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:An alternative perspective, which has received attention more recently, emphasizes sys-
38:1494:102902:16:15:71:534:372:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:tematic factors—heterogeneity as opposed to random shocks. This view is essentially in
38:1495:102988:15:16:71:534:357:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the same spirit as the HIP model of the previous section. But it goes one step further by
38:1496:103077:16:16:71:535:341:143:g_d0_f6:143:g_d0_f2:endogenizingthe wage distribution based on the human capital framework ofBecker(1964)
38:1497:103162:16:16:71:539:325:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and   Ben-Porath(1967)amongothers. Inaninfluentialpaper,Huggett et al.(2006)have
38:1498:103242:16:16:71:538:309:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:studied the distributional implications of the standardBen-Porath(1967)modelbyasking
38:1499:103326:16:16:72:535:293:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the types of heterogeneity that one needs to introduce to generate patterns consistent with
38:1500:103417:16:16:72:535:277:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the US data. They find that too much heterogeneity in initial human capital levels results
38:1501:103507:16:16:72:535:261:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:in the counterfactual implication that wage inequalityshould fallover the lifecycle.  In
38:1502:103595:16:16:72:535:245:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:contrast, heterogeneity in the learning ability generates rise in wage inequality consistent
38:1503:103687:16:15:72:535:229:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:with the data. A key implication of this finding is that the rise in wage inequality can be
38:1504:103778:15:16:72:535:214:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:generated without appealing to idiosyncratic shocks of any kind. Instead, it is the system-

38:1511:104403:9:15:81:534:108:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:39Of course, one can write deeper economic models which generates the the observation that wages
38:1512:104499:15:12:71:539:93:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:follow a random walk process, such as the learning model ofJovanovic(1979)inasearchandmatching

39:1530:105890:16:16:71:539:400:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:natural for economists to interpret the rise in wage inequalityover time,throughthesame
39:1531:105977:16:16:71:535:384:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:lens. Starting withGottschalk and Moffitt(1994)andMoffitt and Gottschalk(1995), this
39:1532:106061:16:16:71:534:368:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:trend has been broadly interpreted as reflecting a rise in the variances of idiosyncratic shocks,
39:1533:106158:16:16:71:535:352:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:either permanent or transitory (Meghir and Pistaferri(2004),Heathcote et al.(2008), etc.).
39:1534:106248:16:16:71:534:336:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:This approach remains the dominant way to calibrate economic models that investigate

39:1537:106469:16:15:71:534:283:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:with the RIP view. The first group of papers revisit the econometric analyses of wage and
39:1538:106558:15:16:71:539:268:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:earnings data. Among these,Sabelhaus and Song(2009,2010)haveusedpaneldatafrom

39:1542:106909:16:16:71:534:204:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:three important advantages: (i) a much larger sample size (on the order of 50+ million
39:1543:106995:16:16:71:534:188:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:observations, compared to at most 50,000 in the PSID), (ii) no survey response error, and
39:1544:107084:16:16:71:534:172:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:(iii) no attrition. Sabelhaus and Song found that the volatility of annual earnings growth

40:1552:107726:16:16:72:534:664:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Social Security records from 1980 to 2003, reached the same conclusion.41Finally,Kopczuk

40:1555:107979:16:16:71:539:616:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:difficult to reconcile withMoffitt and Gottschalk(1995)andthesubsequentliteraturethat
40:1556:108064:16:16:71:534:600:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:found permanent and transitory shock variances to have risen in different sub-periods from
40:1557:108154:16:16:71:534:584:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:1970 to 2000s. If true, the latter would result in fluctuations in mobility patterns over these
40:1558:108249:16:19:71:437:568:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:sub-periods, which is not borne out inKopczuk et al.(2010)’s analysis.
40:1559:108319:19:16:89:534:549:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Another piece of evidence from income data is offered byHaider(2001), who estimated a
40:1560:108404:16:16:71:538:533:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:stochastic process for wages similar to the one inMoffitt and Gottschalk(1995)andothers,
40:1561:108492:16:16:71:535:517:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:but with one key difference. He allowed for individual-specific wage growth rates (HIP)
40:1562:108579:16:16:71:535:501:143:g_d0_f6:143:g_d0_f2:andhe also allowed for the dispersion of growth rates to vary over time. The stochastic
40:1563:108666:16:16:71:534:485:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:component is specified as an ARMA(1,1). With this more flexible specification, he found
40:1564:108753:16:15:71:534:469:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:no evidence of a rise in the variance of income shocks after 1970s, but instead found a large
40:1565:108846:15:20:71:371:454:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:increase in the dispersion of systematic wage growth rates.
40:1566:108905:20:16:89:535:434:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A second strand of the literature have studied the trends in labor market flows in the
40:1567:108991:16:16:71:534:418:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:United States. These studies do not find any evidence of rising job instability or churning,
40:1568:109083:16:16:71:534:402:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:which one might expect to see in conjunction with larger idiosyncratic shocks. In contrast,
40:1569:109174:16:16:71:534:386:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:these studies document an across-the-board moderation in labor market flows. For example,
40:1570:109263:16:15:71:538:370:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Gottschalk and Moffitt(1999)focusonmaleworkersbetweenages20and62andconclude
40:1571:109338:15:26:71:195:355:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:their analysis as follows:
40:1572:109364:26:16:101:506:329:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:[W]e believe that a consistent picture is emerging on changes in job stability

40:1578:109781:15:16:72:534:224:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the sample of individuals to include women and younger workers shows adecliningtrend

40:1580:109914:17:15:81:534:191:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:41Sabelhaus-Song attribute the reason why some earlier studies found rising variances of wage shocks
40:1581:110014:15:12:71:534:176:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:(e.g.,Moffitt and Gottschalk(2008)) to the inclusion of individuals with self-employment income and those
40:1582:110119:12:12:71:534:164:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:who earn less than the Social Security minimum. Even though there are few of these households, they show
40:1583:110223:12:12:71:539:152:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:that they make a big difference in the computed statistics. Similarly,Solon and Shin(2011,p. 978-980)
40:1584:110324:12:12:71:534:140:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:use PSID data and also do not find a trend in the volatility of wage earnings changes during the 1980s and
40:1585:110430:12:12:71:538:128:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:1990s. They argue that the increasing volatility found in earlier studies, such asDynan et al.(2007)seems
40:1586:110535:12:12:71:534:116:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:to be coming from the inclusion of some auxiliary types of income (from business, farming, etc) whose
40:1587:110636:12:9:71:332:104:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:treatment has been inconsistent in the PSID over the years.
40:1588:110695:9:15:81:534:95:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:42They also say, “Almost all studies based on the various Current Population Surveys (CPS) supplements
40:1589:110797:15:0:71:403:80:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:...show little change in the overall separation rates through the early 1990s.”

41:1591:110956:16:16:72:535:680:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:inequality was driven by an increase in idiosyncratic shock variances—is being challenged
41:1592:111045:16:16:72:535:664:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:by a variety of new evidence, some of which from data sets many orders of magnitude
41:1593:111128:16:16:72:535:648:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:larger than the surveys used in previous analyses.  In addition, the evidence from labor
41:1594:111216:16:16:72:535:632:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:market flows described above—while perhaps more indirect—raises questions about the
41:1595:111299:16:16:72:535:616:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:sources of larger idiosyncratic shocks in a period where labor market transitions seem to
41:1596:111388:16:16:72:535:600:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:have moderated. Although, it would be premature to conclude that the alternative view
41:1597:111473:16:16:72:535:584:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:is the correct one—more evidence is needed to reach a definitive conclusion. Having said

41:1599:111650:15:16:72:535:553:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:new “fact” would require economists to rethink a variety of explanations put forward for

43:1670:115342:16:16:72:535:653:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:cal. More often than not, the success or failure of a given algorithm will depend on the initial
43:1671:115438:16:16:72:535:637:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:guess. One idea (used by Krusell and Smith) is to first solve a standard representative-agent

43:1675:115799:16:16:72:535:573:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:of the full model. Sometimes this simplification involves ignoring certain constraints, some-

43:1691:117057:16:16:71:534:295:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:stock and not on its distribution. Some models do not have this structure—instead pricing
43:1692:117146:16:16:71:534:279:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:functions must be determined by equilibrium conditions—such as market-clearing or zero-

43:1694:117320:16:16:71:534:247:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:case, for example, if a household bond is traded in the economy. Its price must be solved

44:1713:118733:16:16:72:535:590:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:model until either theR2of this regression is larger than some minimum or-ufalls below
44:1714:118819:16:21:72:316:574:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:some threshold (step 6 in the algorithm above).
44:1715:118866:21:16:89:535:553:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:However, one shouldnotrely solely onR2and-u. There are at least three reasons for
44:1716:118947:16:16:72:535:537:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:this (den Haan(2010)). First, both measures average over all periods of the simulation.
44:1717:119034:16:16:72:535:521:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Thus, infrequent but large deviations from the forecast rule can be hidden in the average.
44:1718:119124:16:15:72:535:505:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:These errors may be very important to agents and their decision rule. For example, the
44:1719:119210:15:16:72:535:490:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:threat of a very large recession may increase buffer stock saving, but the approximation
44:1720:119298:16:16:72:535:474:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:may understate the movement of capital in such a case. Second, and more importantly,
44:1721:119382:16:16:72:535:458:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:these statistics only measure one-step ahead forecasts. The regression only considers the
44:1722:119471:16:16:72:535:442:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:dynamics from one period to the next, so errors are only the deviations between the actual
44:1723:119561:16:16:72:535:426:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:next-period capital and the expected amount in the next period. This misses potentially
44:1724:119648:16:16:72:535:410:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:large deviations between thelong-termforecast for capital and its actual level. Aware of
44:1725:119736:16:16:72:535:394:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:this possibility,Krusell and Smith(1998)alsocheckedtheR2for forecasting prices 25 years

44:1728:119997:16:29:71:376:346:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:LHS of the regression. An alternative is to check theR2of:

44:1744:120952:16:0:71:534:81:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:This is important because in the true model, today’s choices depend upon expectations

45:1752:121603:16:16:71:535:571:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:becomes an even more critical issue if the main focus of analysis is (asset) prices rather
45:1753:121693:16:16:71:534:555:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:than quantities. This is because prices are much more sensitive to approximation errors
45:1754:121780:16:15:71:534:539:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:(see, e.g.,Christiano and Fisher(2000), andJudd and Guu(2001)). The results inChris-

45:1762:122451:29:16:71:533:399:143:g_d0_f20:143:g_d0_f2:Pros and Cons.An important feature of the Krusell-Smith method is that it is a “local”
45:1763:122537:16:16:71:534:383:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:solution around the stationary recursive equilibrium. In other words, this method relies
45:1764:122625:16:16:71:534:367:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:on simulating a very long time series of data (e.g., capital series) and making sure that
45:1765:122714:16:15:71:534:351:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:after this path has converged to the ergodic set, the predictions of agents are accurate for
45:1766:122806:15:16:71:534:336:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:behavior inside that set. This has some advantages and some disadvantages. On advantage
45:1767:122893:16:16:71:535:320:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:is the efficiency gain compared to solving a full recursive equilibrium, which enforces the
45:1768:122984:16:16:71:534:304:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:equilibrium conditions at every point of a somewhat arbitrary grid, regardless of whether
45:1769:123073:16:20:71:400:288:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:or not a given state is ever visited in the stationary equilibrium.
45:1770:123140:20:16:89:535:268:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:One disadvantage is that if you take a larger deviation—say by settingK0to a value
45:1771:123222:16:16:71:534:252:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:well below the steady state value—your “equilibrium functions” are likely to be inaccurate,
45:1772:123313:16:16:71:534:236:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and the behavior of the solution may differ significantly from the true solution. Why should
45:1773:123405:16:16:71:534:220:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:we care about this? Suppose you solve your model then want to study a policy experiment
45:1774:123492:16:16:71:534:204:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:where you eliminate taxes on savings. You would need to write a separate program from
45:1775:123577:16:15:71:534:188:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the “transition” between the two stationary equilibria.  Instead, if you solve for the full
45:1776:123668:15:16:71:534:173:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:recursive equilibrium over a grid that contains both the initial and final steady states, you
45:1777:123761:16:16:71:534:157:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:would not need to do this. However, solving for the full equilibrium is often much harder
45:1778:123850:16:29:71:243:141:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and, therefore, is often “over-kill.”
45:1779:123887:29:16:71:534:112:143:g_d0_f20:143:g_d0_f2:An Alternative to Krusell-Smith: Tracking History of Shocks.Some models have
45:1780:123963:16:16:71:534:96:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:few exogenous state variables, but a large number of endogenous states. In such cases, using
45:1781:124055:16:0:71:538:80:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:aformulationthatkeepstrackofallthesestatevariablescanmakethenumericalsolution
46:1782:124134:0:16:72:535:696:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:extremely costly or even infeasible. An alternative method begins with the straightforward
46:1783:124224:16:16:72:535:680:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:observation that all current endogenous state variables are nothing more than functions of
46:1784:124314:16:16:72:535:664:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the infinite history of exogenous shocks. So, one could replace these endogenous states with
46:1785:124406:16:16:72:535:648:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the infinite history of exogenous states. Moreover, many models turn out to have “limited
46:1786:124495:16:16:72:535:632:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:memory” in the sense that only the recent history of shocks matters in a quantitatively
46:1787:124582:16:16:72:535:616:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:significant way, allowing us to only track a truncated history of exogenous states. The first
46:1788:124675:16:16:72:534:600:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:implementation of this idea I have been able to find is inVeracierto(1997), who studied a
46:1789:124764:16:16:72:535:584:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:model with plant-level investment irreversibilities, which give rise to S-s type policies. He
46:1790:124857:16:15:72:535:568:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:showed that it is more practical to track a short history of the S-s thresholds instead of the
46:1791:124951:15:21:72:288:553:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:current-period endogenous state variables.
46:1792:124993:21:16:89:535:532:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:As another example, consider an equilibrium model of the housing market where the
46:1793:125074:16:16:72:535:516:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:only exogenous state is the interest rate, which evolves as a Markov process. Depending
46:1794:125161:16:16:72:535:500:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:on the precise model structure, the individual endogenous state variables can include the
46:1795:125250:16:16:72:535:484:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:mortgage debt outstanding, the time-to-maturity of the mortgage contract, etc., and the
46:1796:125337:16:16:72:535:468:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:aggregate endogenous state can include the entire distribution of agents over the individual
46:1797:125429:16:16:72:538:452:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:states. This is potentially an enormously large state space!Arslan(2011)successfullysolves
46:1798:125519:16:15:72:535:436:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:a model of this sort with realistic fixed-rate mortgage contracts, a lifecycle structure, and
46:1799:125612:15:16:72:535:421:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:stochastic interest rates, using 4 lags of interest rates. Other recent examples that employ
46:1800:125704:16:16:72:535:405:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:this basic approach includeLustig and Chien(2010) who solve an asset pricing model with
46:1801:125791:16:16:72:535:389:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:aggregate and idiosyncratic risk in which agents are subject to collateral constraints arising
46:1802:125885:16:16:72:535:373:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:from limited commitment, andLorenzoni(2009) who solves a business cycle model with
46:1803:125967:16:16:71:534:357:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:shocks to individuals’ expectations. In all these cases, tracking a truncated history turns
46:1804:126058:16:16:71:534:341:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:out to provide computational advantages over choosing endogenous state variables that
46:1805:126143:16:16:71:534:325:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:evolve in a Markovian fashion. One advantage of this approach is that it is often less costly
46:1806:126236:16:16:71:534:309:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:to add an extra endogenous state variable relative to the standard approach, because the
46:1807:126324:16:15:71:535:293:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:same number of lags may still be sufficient. One drawback is that if the Markov process
46:1808:126411:15:40:72:496:278:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:has many states or the model has long memory, the method may not work as well.
46:1809:126489:40:33:72:511:238:296:g_d0_f3:296:g_d0_f3:7  When Does Heterogeneity Matter for Aggregates?
46:1810:126538:33:16:72:540:205:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:As noted earlier,Krusell and Smith(1998)reportthatthetimeseriesbehaviorofthe
46:1811:126614:16:16:72:535:189:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:aggregated incomplete markets model, by and large, looks very similar to the corresponding
46:1812:126704:16:16:72:535:173:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:representative-agent model. A similar result was reported inRios-Rull(1996). However,
46:1813:126789:16:16:72:535:157:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:it is important to interpret these findings correctly and to not overgeneralize them. For
46:1814:126878:16:16:72:539:141:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:example, even if a model aggregatesexactly,modelingheterogeneitycanbeveryimportant
46:1815:126960:16:15:72:535:125:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:for aggregate problems. This is because the problem solved by the representative agent
46:1816:127046:15:16:72:535:110:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:can look dramatically different from the problem solved by individuals (for example, have
46:1817:127135:16:0:72:535:94:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:very different preferences). Here, I discuss some important problems in macroeconomics
47:1818:127223:0:16:72:535:696:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:where introducing heterogeneity yields conclusions quite different from a representative-
47:1819:127312:16:34:72:138:680:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:agent model.
47:1820:127324:34:28:72:297:646:206:g_d0_f11:206:g_d0_f11:7.1  The Curse of Long Horizon
47:1821:127354:28:16:72:535:618:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:It is useful to start by discussing why incomplete markets do not matter in many models.
47:1822:127442:16:16:72:535:602:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Loosely speaking, this outcome follows from the fact that a long horizon makes individuals’
47:1823:127533:16:16:72:535:586:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:savings function approximately linear in wealth (i.e., constant MPC out of wealth). As we
47:1824:127622:16:16:72:535:570:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:saw in Section 2, the exact linearity of savings rule delivered exact demand aggregation
47:1825:127710:16:15:72:535:554:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:in bothGorman(1961)andRubinstein(1974)’s theorems.  As it turns out, even with
47:1826:127788:15:16:72:535:539:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:idiosyncratic shocks, this near-linearity holds for wealth levels that are not immediately near
47:1827:127883:16:16:72:535:523:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:borrowing constraints. Thus, even though markets are incomplete, redistributing wealth
47:1828:127969:16:21:72:482:507:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:would matter little, and we have something that looks like demand aggregation!
47:1829:128047:21:16:89:535:486:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Is there a way to get around this result? It is instructive to look at a concrete example.
47:1830:128137:16:15:72:539:470:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Mankiw(1986)wasoneofthefirstpapersintheliteratureontheequitypremiumpuzzle
47:1831:128210:15:16:72:538:455:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and one that gave prominence to the role of heterogeneity.Mankiw(1986)showedthat,ina
47:1832:128294:16:16:72:535:439:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:two-period model with incomplete markets and idiosyncratic risk of the right form, one can
47:1833:128384:16:16:72:535:423:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:generate an equity premium as large as desired. However, researchers who followed up on
47:1834:128471:16:16:72:535:407:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:this promising lead (Telmer(1993),Heaton and Lucas(1996), andKrusell and Smith(1997))
47:1835:128556:16:16:72:535:391:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:quickly came to a disappointing conclusion: once agents in these models are allowed to live
47:1836:128647:16:16:72:535:375:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:for multiple periods, trading a single risk-free asset yields sufficient consumption insurance,
47:1837:128742:16:20:72:314:359:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:which in turn results in a tiny equity premium.
47:1838:128789:20:16:89:534:339:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:This result—that a sufficiently long horizon can dramatically weaken the effects of in-
47:1839:128876:16:16:72:540:323:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:complete markets—is quite general.  In fact,Levine and Zame(2002)provedthatina
47:1840:128954:16:16:72:535:307:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:single good economy with no aggregate shocks if: (i) idiosyncratic income shocks follow a

47:1843:129225:16:16:72:535:259:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:then incomplete markets allocations (and utilities) converge to those from a complete mar-
47:1844:129315:16:15:72:535:243:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:kets economy with the same aggregate resources. Although Levine and Zame’s result is
47:1845:129399:15:16:72:535:228:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:theoretical for the limit of such economies (as-!1), it still sounds a cautionary note
47:1846:129485:16:16:72:535:212:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:to researchers building incomplete markets models: unless shocks are extremely persistent
47:1847:129574:16:16:72:535:196:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and/or individuals are very impatient, these models are unlikely to generate results much
47:1848:129663:16:21:72:296:180:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:different from a representative-agent model.
47:1849:129707:21:15:89:535:159:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Constantinides and Duffie(1996) have shown one way to get around the problem of a long
47:1850:129793:15:16:72:535:144:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:horizon, which is also consistent with the message of Levine-Zame’s theorem. Essentially
47:1851:129881:16:16:72:535:128:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:they assume that individuals face permanent shocks, which eliminates the incentives to
47:1852:129967:16:16:72:535:112:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:smooth such shocks. Therefore, they behave as if they live in a static world and choose not
47:1853:130058:16:16:72:534:96:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:to trade. Constantinides and Duffie also revive another feature ofMankiw(1986)’s model:
47:1854:130145:16:0:72:535:80:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:idiosyncratic shocks must have larger variance in recessions (i.e., countercyclical variances)
48:1855:130241:0:16:72:535:696:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:to generate a large equity premium. With these two features, they show that Mankiw’s
48:1856:130325:16:16:72:535:680:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:original insight can be made to work once again in an infinite horizon model.Storesletten
48:1857:130414:16:16:72:535:664:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:et al.(2007) found that a calibrated model along the lines suggested by Constantinides and
48:1858:130504:16:21:72:475:648:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Duffie can generate about 1/4 of the equity premium observed in the US data.
48:1859:130580:21:15:89:535:627:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:The bottom line is that, loosely speaking, if incomplete markets matter in a model
48:1860:130662:15:16:72:535:612:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:mainly through its effect on the consumption-saving decision, a long horizon can signifi-

48:1862:130837:16:16:72:535:580:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:accumulate sufficient wealth and end up on the nearly linear portion of their savings func-
48:1863:130928:16:16:72:535:564:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:tion, delivering results not far from a complete markets model. This is also the upshot of
48:1864:131018:16:34:72:257:548:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Krusell and Smith(1998)’s analysis.

48:1866:131098:28:16:72:535:486:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:There are many examples in which heterogeneity does matter for aggregate phenomena.
48:1867:131181:16:20:72:227:470:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Here, I review some examples.
48:1868:131210:20:16:89:535:450:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:First, aggregating heterogeneous-agent models can give rise to preferences for the repre-
48:1869:131299:16:16:72:535:434:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:sentative agent that may have nothing to do with the preferences in the underlying model.
48:1870:131388:16:16:72:534:418:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A well-known example of such a transformation was present in the early works ofHansen
48:1871:131473:16:16:72:535:402:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:(1985)andRogerson(1988), who showed that in a model in which individuals have no in-
48:1872:131557:16:16:72:535:386:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:tensive margin of labor supply (i.e., zero Frisch labor supply elasticity), one can aggregate
48:1873:131650:16:15:72:535:370:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the model to find that the representative agent has linear preferences in leisure (i.e., infinite
48:1874:131747:15:16:72:535:355:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Frisch elasticity!).  This conclusion challenges one of the early justifications for building
48:1875:131840:16:16:72:535:339:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:models with micro-foundations, which was to bring evidence from micro data to bear on
48:1876:131925:16:16:72:535:323:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the calibration of macro models.  In an excellent survey paper,Browning et al.(1999)
48:1877:132009:16:16:72:535:307:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:sounded an early cautionary note, giving several examples where this approach is fraught
48:1878:132097:16:20:72:136:291:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:with danger.
48:1879:132109:20:16:89:539:271:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Building on the earlier insights of Hansen and Rogerson,Chang and Kim(2006)con-
48:1880:132188:16:16:72:535:255:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:struct a model in which aggregate labor-supply elasticity depends on the reservation-wage
48:1881:132277:16:16:72:535:239:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:distribution in the population.  The economy is populated by households (husband and
48:1882:132361:16:16:72:535:223:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:wife) who each supply labor only along the extensive margin: they either work full time or
48:1883:132451:16:16:72:535:207:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:stay home. Workers are hit by idiosyncratic productivity shocks, causing them to move in
48:1884:132539:16:16:72:535:191:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and out of the labor market. The aggregate labor-supply elasticity of such an economy is
48:1885:132627:16:16:72:535:175:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:around 1, greater than a typical micro estimate and much greater than the Frisch elasticity
48:1886:132718:16:15:72:535:159:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:one would measure at the intensive margin (which is zero) in this model. The model thus
48:1887:132805:15:16:72:535:144:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:provides a reconciliation between the micro and macro labor-supply elasticities. In a sim-

48:1889:132974:16:16:72:535:112:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:discussions of aggregate policy are not invariant to policies if they are generated from the
48:1890:133066:16:16:72:535:96:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:aggregation of a heterogeneous-agent model. Such a model also generates “wedges” at the
48:1891:133153:16:0:72:535:80:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:aggregate level that do not translate into any well-defined notion of preference shifters at
49:1892:133247:0:16:72:539:696:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the micro level.45Finally,Erosa et al.(2009)buildalifecyclemodeloflaborsupply,by
49:1893:133327:16:16:71:534:680:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:combining and extending the ideas introduced in earlier papers, such asChang and Kim
49:1894:133411:16:16:71:535:664:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:(2006)andRogerson and Wallenius(2009). Their goal is to build a model with empirically
49:1895:133497:16:16:71:534:648:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:plausible patterns of hours over the life cycle and examine the response elasticities of labor
49:1896:133591:16:21:71:262:632:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:supply to various policy experiments.
49:1897:133628:21:16:89:535:611:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:In another context,Guvenen(2006) asks why macroeconomic models in the RBC tra-
49:1898:133706:16:15:71:534:595:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:dition typically need to assume a high elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) to
49:1899:133794:15:16:71:534:580:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:explain output and investment fluctuations, whereas Euler equation regressions (such as
49:1900:133881:16:16:71:535:564:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:in Hall(1988)andCampbell and Mankiw(1990)) that use aggregate consumption data
49:1901:133959:16:16:71:534:548:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:estimate a much smaller EIS (close to zero) to fit the data. He builds a model with two
49:1902:134046:16:16:71:535:532:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:types of agents who differ in their EIS. The model generates substantial wealth inequality
49:1903:134136:16:16:71:534:516:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and much smaller consumption inequality, both in line with the US data. Consequently,
49:1904:134221:16:16:71:534:500:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:capital and investment fluctuations are mainly driven by the rich (who hold almost all the
49:1905:134311:16:16:71:534:484:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:wealth in the economy) and thus reflect the high EIS of this group. Consumption fluctua-
49:1906:134399:16:16:71:534:468:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:tions, on the other hand, reflect an average that puts much more weight on the poor’s EIS,
49:1907:134489:16:15:71:534:452:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:who contribute significantly to aggregate consumption. Thus, a heterogeneous agent model
49:1908:134577:15:16:71:534:437:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:is able to explain aggregate evidence that a single representative-agent model has trouble
49:1909:134667:16:21:71:105:421:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:fitting.

49:1913:134929:16:16:71:535:352:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:agent model gets translated into a higher risk aversion for the representative agent.Guve-
49:1914:135019:16:15:71:534:336:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:nen (2011) shows that in a calibrated model with limited stock market participation that
49:1915:135107:15:16:71:534:321:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:matches several asset pricing facts, the aggregate risk aversion is measured to be as high
49:1916:135197:16:16:71:534:305:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:as 80, when the individuals’ risk aversion is only 2. These results as well as the papers
49:1917:135286:16:16:71:534:289:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:discussed above confirm and amplify the concerns originally highlighted byBrowning et al.
49:1918:135375:16:16:71:534:273:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:(1999). The conclusion is that researchers must be very careful when using micro evidence
49:1919:135464:16:40:71:279:257:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:to calibrate representative-agent models.

49:1921:135531:32:16:72:535:185:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Because of their complexity, the overwhelming majority of models in this literature are
49:1922:135618:16:16:72:535:169:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:solved on a computer using numerical methods.46Thus, I now turn to a discussion of
49:1923:135700:16:16:72:535:153:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:computational issues that researchers often have to confront when solving models with
49:1924:135785:16:18:72:143:137:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:heterogeneity.

49:1926:135861:12:15:81:534:107:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:46There are few examples of analytical solutions and theoretical results established with heterogeneous-

50:1930:136176:29:16:72:535:667:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Economists often need to minimize an objective function of multiple variables that has
50:1931:136262:16:16:72:535:651:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:lots of kinks, jaggedness, and deep ridges.  Consequently, the global minimum is often
50:1932:136348:16:16:72:535:635:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:surrounded by a large number of local minima. A typical example of such a problem arises
50:1933:136436:16:16:72:535:619:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:when a researcher tries to calibrate several structural parameters of an economic model
50:1934:136523:16:15:72:535:603:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:by matching some data moments. Algorithms based on local optimization methods (e.g.,
50:1935:136607:15:16:72:535:588:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Newton-Raphson style derivative-based methods or Nelder-Mead simplex style routines)
50:1936:136691:16:16:72:535:572:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:very often get stuck in local minima, because the objective surface is typically very rough
50:1937:136782:16:21:72:145:556:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:(non-smooth).
50:1938:136795:21:16:89:535:535:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:It is useful to understand some of the sources of this roughness. For example, linear in-
50:1939:136884:16:16:72:535:519:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:terpolation that is often used in approximating value functions or decision rules generates an
50:1940:136978:16:16:72:535:503:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:interpolated function that is non-differentiable (i.e., have kinks) at every knot point. Sim-
50:1941:137071:16:16:72:535:487:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:ilarly, problems with (borrowing, portfolio, etc.) constraints can create significant kinks.
50:1942:137163:16:16:72:535:471:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Because researchers use a finite number of individuals to simulate data from the model
50:1943:137249:16:15:72:535:455:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:(to compute moments) a small change in the parameter value (during the minimization
50:1944:137332:15:16:72:535:440:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:of the objective) can move some individuals across the threshold—from being constrained
50:1945:137419:16:16:72:535:424:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:to unconstrained or vice versa—which can cause small jumps in the objective value. And
50:1946:137505:16:16:72:535:408:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:sometimes, the moments that the researcher decides to match would be inherently discon-
50:1947:137592:16:16:72:535:392:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:tinuous in the underlying parameters (with a finite number of individuals), such as the
50:1948:137679:16:16:72:535:376:143:g_d0_f6:143:g_d0_f2:medianof a distribution (e.g., wealth holdings).  Further compounding the problems, if
50:1949:137765:16:16:72:534:360:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the moments are not jointly sufficiently informative about the parameters to be calibrated,
50:1950:137856:16:16:72:535:344:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the objective function would be flat in certain directions. As can be expected, trying to
50:1951:137945:16:16:72:535:328:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:minimize a relatively flat function with lots of kinks, jaggedness, and even small jumps, can
50:1952:138038:16:20:72:235:312:143:g_d0_f2:64:g_d0_f4:be a very difficult task indeed.47
50:1953:138072:20:16:89:535:292:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:While the algorithm described here can be applied to the calibration of any model, it is
50:1954:138160:16:16:71:534:276:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:especially useful in models with heterogeneous agents—since such models are time consum-
50:1955:138248:16:16:71:534:260:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:ing to solve even once, an exhaustive search of the parameter space becomes prohibitively
50:1956:138337:16:41:71:329:244:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:costly (which could be feasible in simpler models).
50:1957:138388:41:29:72:532:203:206:g_d0_f11:206:g_d0_f11:8.2  A Simple Fully Parallelizable Global Optimization Algorithm
50:1958:138452:29:16:89:535:174:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Here, I describe a global optimization algorithm that I regularly use for calibrating
50:1959:138537:16:18:71:534:158:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:models and I have found it to be very practical and powerful. It is relatively straightforward
50:1960:138631:18:15:81:534:140:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:47One simple, but sometimes overlooked, point is that when minimizing an objective function of moments
50:1961:138733:15:12:71:534:125:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:to calibrate a model, one should use the same “seeds” for the random elements of the model that are used
50:1962:138837:12:12:71:534:113:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:to simulate the model in successive evaluations of the objective function. Otherwise, some of the change
50:1963:138941:12:12:71:534:101:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:in objective value will be due to the inherent randomness in different draws of random variables. This can
50:1964:139047:12:0:71:336:89:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:create significant problems with the minimization procedure.
51:1965:139109:0:16:72:535:696:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:to implement, yet allows full parallelization across any number of CPU cores as well as across
51:1966:139203:16:16:72:535:680:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:any number of computers that are connected to the Internet. It requires no knowledge of
51:1967:139290:16:16:72:535:664:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:MPI, OpenMP, or related tools, and no knowledge of computer networking other than using
51:1968:139377:16:21:72:518:648:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:some commercially available synchronization tools (such as DropBox, SugarSync, etc.).
51:1969:139462:21:16:89:535:627:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A broad outline of the algorithm is as follows. As with many global algorithms, this
51:1970:139546:16:16:72:535:611:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:procedure combines a global stage with a local search stage that is restarted at various
51:1971:139634:16:16:72:535:595:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:locations in the parameter space. First, we would like to search the parameter space as
51:1972:139721:16:16:72:535:579:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:thoroughly as possible, but do so in as efficient a way as possible. Thoroughness is essential
51:1973:139815:16:15:72:535:563:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:because we want to be sure that we found the true global minimum, so we are willing to
51:1974:139901:15:16:72:535:548:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:sacrifice some speed to ensure this. The algorithm proceeds by taking an initial starting
51:1975:139990:16:16:72:536:532:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:point (chosen in a manner described momentarily) and conducting a local search from that
51:1976:140078:16:16:72:536:516:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:point on until the minimization routine converges as specified by some tolerance. For local
51:1977:140169:16:16:72:535:500:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:search, I typically rely on the Nelder-Mead’s downhill simplex algorithm because it does
51:1978:140257:16:16:72:535:484:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:not require derivative information (that may be inaccurate given the approximation errors
51:1979:140346:16:16:72:535:468:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:in the model’s solution algorithm).48The minimum function value as well as the parameter
51:1980:140434:16:16:71:534:452:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:combination that attained that minimum are recorded in a file saved on the computer’s hard
51:1981:140524:16:16:71:534:436:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:disk. The algorithm then picks the next “random” starting point and repeats the previous
51:1982:140612:16:15:71:534:420:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:step of local minimization. The results are then added to the previous file, which records
51:1983:140702:15:21:71:297:405:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:all the local minima found up to that point.
51:1984:140746:21:16:89:535:384:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Of course, the most obvious algorithm would be to keep doing a very large number of
51:1985:140829:16:16:71:534:368:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:restarts of this sort and take the minimum of all the minima found in the process. But
51:1986:140915:16:16:71:535:352:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:this would be very time consuming and would not be particularly efficient. Moreover, in
51:1987:141002:16:16:71:534:336:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:many cases, the neighborhood of the global minimum can feature many deep ridges and
51:1988:141085:16:16:71:534:320:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:kinks nearby, which requires more extensive searching near the global minimum, whereas
51:1989:141171:16:16:71:534:304:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the proposed approach would devote as much time to points far away from the true global
51:1990:141258:16:16:71:534:288:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:minimum as to the points near it. Further, if the starting points are chosen literally ran-
51:1991:141349:16:15:71:534:272:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:domly, this would also create potentially large efficiency losses, because these points have a
51:1992:141443:15:16:71:534:257:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:non-negligible chance of falling near points previously tried. Because those areas have been
51:1993:141535:16:21:71:356:241:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:previously searched, devoting more time is not optimal.

51:1995:141661:16:16:71:534:204:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Quasi-random numbers (also called Low-discrepancy sequences) are sequences of determin-

51:2003:142380:16:0:71:431:83:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:they have been found to improve time-to-accuracy by several orders of magnitude.

52:2007:142710:20:16:89:535:644:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Next, how do we use the accumulated information from previous restarts? As suggested
52:2008:142794:16:16:71:534:628:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:by genetic algorithm heuristics, I combine information from previous best runs to adaptively

53:2057:145831:16:16:72:535:313:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:idea is that, after a while of searching, if subsequent restarts keep finding one of the the
53:2058:145923:16:16:72:535:297:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:same local minima found before, the chances of improvement in subsequent searches is not
53:2059:146011:16:16:72:535:281:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:worth the additional time cost. Although this is generally viewed as one of the most reliable
53:2060:146104:16:21:72:348:265:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:heuristics, care must be applied as with any heuristic.

53:2063:146329:16:15:72:535:212:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:new local minimum with a high enough probability, it is time to narrow down the search
53:2064:146415:15:16:72:535:197:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and further explore areas of promising local minima. Because jaggedness and deep ridges
53:2065:146502:16:16:72:535:181:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:cause local search methods to often get stuck, we want to explore promising areas more
53:2066:146588:16:21:72:130:165:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:thoroughly.
53:2067:146599:21:16:89:535:144:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:One can improve upon this basic algorithm in various ways. I am going to mention a

54:2072:146965:16:16:71:534:648:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:But then we have wasted an entire cycle of local search without gaining anything. To prevent
54:2073:147057:16:16:71:533:632:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:this, one heuristic (called “clustering methods”) proceeds by defining a “region of attraction”
54:2074:147152:16:16:71:535:616:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:(which is essentially aJ-dimensional ball centered) around each one of the local minima
54:2075:147239:16:16:71:535:600:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:found so far.51Then the algorithm would discard a proposed re-starting point if it falls into

54:2079:147608:16:21:71:501:537:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:surveys of clustering methods can be found inRinnooy Kan and Timmer(1987a,b).
54:2080:147685:21:16:89:535:516:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Second, one can add a “pre-test” stage whereNpoints from the Sobol’ sequence are
54:2081:147765:16:16:71:539:500:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f13:evaluated before any local search (i.e., in Step 0 above), and only a subset ofN⇤<N
54:2082:147848:16:16:72:535:484:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:points with lowest objective values are used as seeds in the local search. The remaining
54:2083:147936:16:16:72:536:468:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:points as well as regions of attraction around it are ignored as not promising. Notice that
54:2084:148027:16:37:72:447:452:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:while this stage can improve speed, it trades offreliability in the process.
54:2085:148103:37:16:72:534:415:143:g_d0_f20:143:g_d0_f2:Narrowing Down the Search Area.The filesaved_parameters.datcontains a lot of
54:2086:148179:16:16:72:535:399:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:useful information gathered in each iteration to the global stage, which can be used more
54:2087:148268:16:16:72:534:383:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:efficiently as follows. As noted, the Nelder-Mead algorithm requiresJ+1candidate points
54:2088:148355:16:16:72:535:367:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:as inputs (the vertices of theJ-dimensional simplex). One of these points is given bySi,
54:2089:148443:16:16:71:534:351:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:chosen as described above; the other vertices were drawn randomly. But as we accumulate
54:2090:148530:16:16:71:534:335:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:more information with every iteration on the global stage, if we keep finding local minima
54:2091:148620:16:16:71:534:319:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:that seem to concentrate in certain regions, it makes sense to narrow the range of values
54:2092:148709:16:15:71:534:303:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:from which we pick the vertices. One way to do this is as follows: After a sufficiently large
54:2093:148802:15:16:71:534:288:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:number of re-starts have been completed, rank all the function values and take the lowest
54:2094:148891:16:16:71:535:272:143:g_d0_f54:143:g_d0_f2:x% of values (e.g., 10% or 20%). Then for each dimension, pick the minimum (callpjmin)and
54:2095:148980:16:16:71:535:256:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:maximum parameter value (callpjmax)within this set of minima. Then to generate vertices,
54:2096:149068:16:16:72:535:240:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:take randomly sampled points betweenpjminandpjmaxin each dimensionj. This allows the
54:2097:149152:16:16:71:534:224:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:simplex algorithm to search more intensively in a narrower area, which can improve results
54:2098:149242:16:16:71:534:208:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:very quickly when there are ridges or jaggedness in the objective function that makes the
54:2099:149331:16:18:71:188:192:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:algorithm to get stuck.
54:2100:149354:18:15:81:535:174:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:51While different formulas have been proposed for determining the optimal radius, these formulas contain
54:2101:149458:15:0:72:466:159:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:some undetermined coefficients which makes them less than useful in real life applications.
55:2102:149551:0:29:72:297:696:206:g_d0_f11:206:g_d0_f11:8.3  Parallelizing the Algorithm
55:2103:149583:29:16:72:535:667:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:The algorithm can be parallelized in a relatively straightforward manner.52The basic idea
55:2104:149672:16:16:72:535:651:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:is to let each CPU core perform a separate local search in a different part of the parameter
55:2105:149764:16:16:72:535:635:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:space, which is a time-consuming process. If we can do many such searches simultaneously,
55:2106:149853:16:16:72:535:619:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:we can speed up the solution dramatically. One factor that makes parallelization simple is
55:2107:149943:16:15:72:535:603:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:that fact that the CPU cores do not need to communicate with each other during the local
55:2108:150031:15:16:72:535:588:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:search stage. In-between the local stages, each CPU core will contribute its findings (the
55:2109:150121:16:16:72:535:572:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:last local minimum it found along with the corresponding parameter vector) to the collective
55:2110:150213:16:16:72:535:556:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:wisdom recorded insaved_parameters.datand also get the latest updated information
55:2111:150294:16:16:72:535:540:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:about the best local minimum found so far from the same file. Thus, as long as all CPU cores
55:2112:150386:16:16:72:538:524:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:have access to the same copy of the filesaved_parameters.dat,parallelizationrequiresno
55:2113:150472:16:21:72:498:508:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:more than a few lines for housekeeping across CPUs. Here are some more specifics.
55:2114:150553:21:16:89:535:487:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Suppose that we have a workstation withNCPU cores (for example,N=4, 6, or 12).
55:2115:150631:16:16:71:534:471:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:The first modification we need to make is to change the program to distinguish between
55:2116:150717:16:15:71:535:455:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the different “copies” of the code, running on different CPU cores. This can be done by
55:2117:150804:15:16:71:534:440:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:simply having the program ask the user (only once, upon starting the code) to input an
55:2118:150890:16:16:71:535:424:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:integer value,n,between1andN, which uniquely identifies the “sequence number” of the
55:2119:150974:16:16:71:535:408:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:particular instance of the program running. Then openNterminal windows and launch a
55:2120:151057:16:16:71:534:392:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:copy of the program in each window. Then for each one, enter a unique sequence number
55:2121:151142:16:21:71:140:376:143:g_d0_f13:143:g_d0_f2:n=1,2..., N.
55:2122:151154:21:16:89:535:355:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Upon starting, each program will first simulate the same quasi-random sequence re-
55:2123:151236:16:16:71:535:339:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:gardless ofn, but each run will pick a different element of this sequence as its own seed.
55:2124:151326:16:16:71:534:323:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:For simplicity, suppose runnchooses thenthelement of the sequence as its seed and
55:2125:151407:16:15:71:534:307:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:launches a local search from that point. After completion, each run will open the same
55:2126:151493:15:16:71:534:292:143:g_d0_f2:64:g_d0_f4:filesaved_parameters.datand record the local minimum and parameter value it finds.53
55:2127:151577:16:16:72:535:276:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Now suppose that all copies of the program complete their respective first local searches, so
55:2128:151670:16:16:72:535:260:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:there areNlines, each written by a different CPU core, in the filesaved_parameters.dat.
55:2129:151757:16:16:71:534:244:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Then each run will start its second iteration and pick as its next seed the(N+n)thelement
55:2130:151846:16:16:71:534:228:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:of the quasi-random sequence. When the total number of iterations across all CPUs exceed
55:2131:151934:16:16:71:535:212:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:some thresholdImin, then we would like to combine the quasi-random draw with the pre-
55:2132:152019:16:16:72:535:196:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:vious best local minima as described in Step 1.3 above. This is simple since all runs have
55:2133:152109:16:18:72:346:180:143:g_d0_f2:64:g_d0_f4:access to the same copy ofsaved_parameters.dat.54
55:2134:152158:18:15:81:534:162:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:52I am assuming here that a compiled language, such as Fortran or C, is used to write the program. So
55:2135:152259:15:9:71:433:147:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:multiple parallel copies of the same code can be run in different terminal windows.
55:2136:152342:9:15:81:534:138:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:53Because this opening and writing stage takes a fraction of a second, the likelihood that two or more
55:2137:152444:15:9:71:421:123:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:programs access the file simultaneously and create a run-time error is negligible.
55:2138:152526:9:15:81:535:114:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:54It is often useful for each run to keep track of thetotalnumber of local searches completed by all

55:2140:152715:12:0:71:539:87:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:can be read offas the total number of lines recorded up to that point insaved_parameters.dat.Another
56:2141:152817:0:16:89:535:696:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Notice that this parallelization method is completely agnostic about whether the CPU
56:2142:152901:16:16:71:535:680:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:cores are on the same PC or distributed across many PCsas long asall computers keep

56:2144:153068:16:16:71:534:648:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:nization service like DropBox. This feature easily allows one to harness the computational
56:2145:153158:16:47:71:520:632:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:power of many idle PCs distributed geographically with varying speeds and CPU cores.
56:2146:153242:47:33:72:438:585:296:g_d0_f3:296:g_d0_f3:9FutureDirectionsandFurtherReading
56:2147:153276:33:16:72:535:552:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:This article has surveyed the current state of the heterogeneous-agent models literature and
56:2148:153368:16:16:72:535:536:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:drew several conclusions. First, two key ingredients in such models are (i) the magnitudes
56:2149:153458:16:15:72:535:520:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and types of risk that the model-builder feeds into the model and (ii) the insurance oppor-
56:2150:153549:15:16:72:534:505:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:tunities allowed in the economy. In many cases, it is difficult, if not impossible, to measure
56:2151:153643:16:16:72:535:489:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:each component separately. In other words, the assumptions a researcher makes regarding
56:2152:153730:16:16:72:535:473:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:insurance opportunities will typically affect the inference drawn about the magnitudes of
56:2153:153819:16:16:72:535:457:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:risks and vice versa. Further complicating the problem is the measurement of risk: individ-
56:2154:153910:16:16:72:535:441:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:uals often have more information than the econometrician about future changes in their life.
56:2155:154002:16:16:72:535:425:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:So, for example, a rise or fall in income that the econometrician may view as a “shock” may
56:2156:154093:16:16:72:535:409:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:in fact be partially or completely anticipated by the individual. This suggests that equating
56:2157:154186:16:16:72:535:393:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:income movements observed in the data with risk (as is often done in the literature) is likely
56:2158:154280:16:15:72:535:377:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:to overstate the true magnitude. This entanglement of “risk,” “anticipated changes,” and
56:2159:154368:15:16:72:534:362:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:“insurance” presents a difficult challenge to researchers in this area. Although some recent
56:2160:154460:16:21:72:301:346:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:progress has been made, more work remains.

56:2169:155169:16:16:72:535:198:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:heterogeneous-agent models use micro survey data in increasingly sophisticated ways, a

56:2171:155342:16:16:72:535:166:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:data) is essential. Failure to understand such problems can wreak havoc with the empirical

57:2179:156017:16:16:71:534:680:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:of current research. For many questions of empirical relevance, the interactions taking place

57:2184:156455:16:16:71:535:600:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:part of this difference has to do with the fact that couples are able to optimally change
57:2185:156544:16:16:71:534:584:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:their time (and task) allocation within household in response to disability, an option not
57:2186:156634:16:15:71:534:568:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:available to singles. This finding suggests that modeling households would be important for
57:2187:156725:15:16:71:537:553:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:understanding the design of disability insurance policies. Similarly,Guner et al.(2010)show
57:2188:156816:16:16:72:535:537:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:that to quantify the effects of alternative tax reforms, it is important to take into account
57:2189:156909:16:16:72:535:521:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the joint nature of household labor supply. In fact, it is hard to imagine any distributional

57:2191:157078:21:16:89:535:484:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Another promising area is the richer modeling of household finances in an era of ever-
57:2192:157164:16:16:72:535:468:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:increasing sophistication in financial services. The Great Recession, which was accompanied
57:2193:157255:16:16:72:535:452:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:by a housing market crash and soaring personal bankruptcies, home foreclosures, and so
57:2194:157341:16:15:72:535:436:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:on, has created a renewed sense of urgency for understanding household balance sheets.

57:2196:157512:16:16:72:535:405:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:combined with richer data sources on credit histories and mortgages that are increasingly
57:2197:157601:16:47:72:487:389:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:becoming available to researchers—will make faster progress feasible in this area.
