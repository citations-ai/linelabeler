2:31:1601:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:We present a simple way to estimate the effects of changes in a vector of observable variables X on
2:32:1700:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:a limited dependent variable Y when Y is a general nonseparable function of X and unobservables.
2:33:1796:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:We treat models in which Y is censored from above or below or potentially from both. The basic idea
2:34:1895:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:is to first estimate the derivative of the conditional mean of Y given X at x with respect to x on the
2:35:1997:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:uncensored sample without correcting for the effect of changes in x induced on the censored population.
2:36:2100:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:We then correct the derivative for the effects of the selection bias. We propose nonparametric and
2:37:2198:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:semiparametric estimators for the derivative. As extensions, we discuss the cases of discrete regressors,
2:38:2303:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:measurement error in dependent variables, and endogenous regressors in a cross section and panel

3:60:2756:0:25:89:199:755:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:1  Introduction
3:61:2771:25:13:89:520:730:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Many problems in economics involve dependent variables that are censored in some way. For
3:62:2860:13:14:89:520:717:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:example, hundreds of empirical studies have used the Tobit and generalized Tobit models
3:63:2947:14:13:89:520:703:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to study the effects of a set of independent variablesXon a dependent variableYthat
3:64:3030:13:14:89:520:690:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is censored at some constant. While great theoretical progress has been made in relaxing
3:65:3118:14:13:89:519:676:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:assumptions on distribution forms of unobservables and functional forms to relateXand
3:66:3203:13:14:89:520:663:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:B:Y, almost all of the approaches in the literature rely on the assumption that unobservables
3:67:3294:14:14:89:520:649:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the model for the latent variable that determinesYare additively separable from the
3:68:3380:14:13:89:150:635:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:B:observables.1
3:69:3393:13:14:106:520:622:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In many applications in economics, however, nonseparability is likely to be the rule rather
3:70:3484:14:13:89:520:608:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:than exception. For example, Altonji, Hayashi and Kotlikoff (1997) consider the problem
3:71:3571:13:14:89:520:595:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of money transfers from parents to children. Assume that parents’ utility depends on their
3:72:3661:14:13:89:520:581:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:own consumptionCp, the consumption of their childCk, and a preference heterogeneity
3:73:3744:13:23:89:321:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:vectorU. That is, the parents’ utility function is
3:74:3794:23:23:250:359:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:C:Vp(Cp,U) +Vk(Ck,U).
3:75:3813:23:23:89:476:522:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In their model the condition for positive transfers from the parents to the child is
3:76:3897:23:23:248:361:499:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:C:V′p(Xp,U)< V′k(Xk,U),
3:77:3918:23:13:89:520:476:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:whereXkandXpare the endowments of the child and parents. Otherwise the transfer
3:78:3997:13:23:89:359:463:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:amount is zero. LetM(Xp,Xk,U)be a value that solves
3:79:4048:23:23:224:385:440:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:C:V′p(Xp−M,U) =V′k(Xk+M,U).
3:80:4073:23:13:89:520:417:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The observed transfer amountYequalsM(Xk,Xp,U)ifM(Xk,Xp,U)>0and0otherwise.
3:81:4146:13:14:89:520:404:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Altonji, Hayashi and Kotlikoff (1997) point out that the functionM(Xp,Xk,U)is nonsep-
3:82:4231:14:13:89:520:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:arable in the endowments and preferences, and this nonseparability is a generic property
3:83:4319:13:14:89:520:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of transfer equations that are based on a consumer choice framework with interdependent
3:84:4406:14:13:89:144:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:preferences.
3:85:4418:13:14:106:520:350:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In consumer demand and factor demand analysis, the utility function or production
3:86:4499:14:14:89:520:336:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:function is often chosen so that there is a transformation of the demand functions, expen-
3:87:4589:14:13:89:520:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:diture functions, or cost functions that lead to additive error terms. Usually this requires
3:88:4681:13:14:89:520:309:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that the unobservables enter the problem in a particular way. If the unobservables and the
3:89:4771:14:13:89:520:295:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:regressors are independent and the dependent variable is not censored or truncated, the
3:90:4858:13:14:89:520:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:inability to specify separable conditional mean functions does not lead to a serious problem
3:91:4950:14:13:89:520:268:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in terms of estimating the mean of the derivatives of the regression functions. In this setting
3:92:5045:13:14:89:520:255:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:one can apply the average derivative methods of Stoker (1986), Härdle and Stoker (1989),
3:93:5133:14:13:89:520:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and Powell, Stock and Stoker (1989) among others. However, nonseparability and nonmono-
3:94:5220:13:14:89:520:228:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tonicity with respect toUare not innocuous when one wishes to make inferences about a
3:95:5305:14:13:89:520:214:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:selected sample, such as parents who make monetary transfers, because nonseparability will
3:96:5395:13:14:89:400:201:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:invalidate the existing methods of correcting for sample selection.
3:97:5462:14:14:106:520:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In this paper, we present a simple way to estimate the effects of changes in a vector of
3:98:5550:14:15:89:519:173:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:observable regressorsXon a limited dependent variableYwhenYis a general nonseparable
3:99:5634:15:0:102:442:158:6:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f10:F:1See, e.g., Powell (1994), Horowitz (1998), and Pagan and Ullah (1999) for a survey.
4:100:5719:0:14:89:519:755:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:function ofXand unobservablesU. The general model we consider includes models of the
4:101:5803:14:13:89:520:741:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:formY=M(X,U)ifL(X)< M(X,U)andY=CLotherwise, whereM(X,U)is a
4:102:5862:13:14:89:520:728:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:differentiable function with respect toXindexed byU,L(X)is an unknown function ofX,
4:103:5945:14:14:89:520:714:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:andY=CLindicates thatYis censored from below. In this special case, the parameter
4:104:6026:14:13:89:519:700:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f6:B:of interest in Altonji, Hayashi and Kotlikoff (1997) reduces toβ(x) =E[∇M(X,U)|X=
4:105:6107:13:14:89:519:687:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:B:x,L(X)< M(X,U)], where∇M(X,U)is the partial derivative ofM(X,U)with respect to
4:106:6185:14:13:89:520:673:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:B:X. Note that in the ordinary linear censored regression model with an additive error (i.e.,
4:107:6276:13:14:89:520:660:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the Tobit model),β(x)is constant and coincides with the slope coefficients of the regressors.
4:108:6369:14:13:89:520:646:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Altonji, Hayashi and Kotlikoff (1997) use the semi-parametric version of our estimator with
4:109:6460:13:14:89:517:633:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:C:L(X) = 0to estimate the effects of the endowmentsXkandXpon the transfer amountY
4:110:6539:14:13:89:290:619:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:B:among parents who are making transfers.2
4:111:6579:13:14:106:520:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Our estimation strategy is very simple. The basic idea is: (i) estimate the derivative
4:112:6665:14:13:89:520:592:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ofΨ(x) =E[M(X,U)|X=x,L(X)< M(X,U)]with respect toxwithoutcorrecting for
4:113:6736:13:14:89:520:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the effect of changes inxinduced on the censored population through changes inL(x)(i.e.,
4:114:6824:14:14:89:520:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:selection bias) and then (ii) correct the partial derivative for the effects of the selection
4:115:6917:14:13:89:520:551:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:bias. It turns out that the correction has a simple structure which only depends onL(x),
4:116:7005:13:14:89:520:538:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the conditional minimum ofYgivenX=xand onPr{L(X)< M(X,U)|X=x}, the
4:117:7071:14:13:89:520:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:probability thatYis uncensored givenX=x. We consider models in whichYis censored
4:118:7151:13:14:89:222:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from both above and below.
4:119:7177:14:13:106:520:497:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The paper continues in Section 2, where we provide a brief literature review. In Section
4:120:7265:13:14:89:520:484:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:3 we present a canonical nonseparable limited dependent variable model. We then show
4:121:7349:14:13:89:519:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:thatβ(x)is identified from knowledge of certain estimable functions ofx. Starting from the
4:122:7439:13:14:89:520:457:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:expression forβ(x)that underlies our identification result, Section 4 discusses a nonpara-
4:123:7529:14:14:89:520:443:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:metric estimator ofβ(x)as well as an average derivative estimator, which provides a way
4:124:7616:14:13:89:520:429:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to circumvent the curse of dimensionality. Section 5 discusses semiparametric estimation of
4:125:7707:13:14:89:520:416:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:B:β(x). As extensions, Section 6 discusses the case of discrete regressors, measurement error

4:135:8475:13:14:89:520:249:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is to define an estimable parameter of interest. Suppose one assumesY=M(X,U). Han

5:143:9059:14:13:89:520:741:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:these models generalize many limited dependent variable models, some hazard models, and

5:145:9190:14:14:106:520:714:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Since the early drafts of our paper and Altonji, Hayashi and Kotlikoff (1997) were
5:146:9272:14:13:89:520:700:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:circulated, a few papers on nonparametrically estimating features of limited dependent
5:147:9358:13:14:89:520:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:variable models have appeared. Lewbel and Linton (2002) consider the model in which the
5:148:9445:14:24:89:211:673:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:error term is additive and
5:149:9471:24:25:192:417:649:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:C:M(X,U) =m(X) +U,  L(X) =c,H(x) =∞,
5:150:9505:25:13:89:520:624:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:where the constantcis known. Note that under their modelβ(x) =∇m(x). Under the
5:151:9583:13:14:89:520:611:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f6:B:additive error model they show that∇m(x)is the derivative ofE[1(Y > c)(Y−c)|X=x]
5:152:9663:14:13:89:520:597:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:divided by the probability thatYis uncensored givenX=x. We show that this result
5:153:9743:13:14:89:520:584:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:holds much more generally when we replace∇m(x)withβ(x). We do not require additive
5:154:9825:14:13:89:520:570:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:error structure and allow both censoring from above and below and the censoring points to

5:158:10096:13:14:89:520:516:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:wereUis a scalar and independent ofXandσ(X)is strictly positive.  Their approach
5:159:10176:14:13:89:520:502:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:breaks down if monotonicity inUis dropped and/or if a second additive error term appears
5:160:10264:13:14:89:520:489:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the model. They do not consider estimation ofβ(x)or the case in whichL(X)depends
5:161:10347:14:13:89:519:475:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:onXand must be estimated. In contrast, we place almost no restrictionsM(X,U)and
5:162:10426:13:14:89:487:462:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:allow for endogeneity ofX, but only consider estimation ofβ(X),L(X)andH(X).
5:163:10501:14:13:106:520:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Over the past decade there has been an explosion of research on nonseparable models
5:164:10584:13:14:89:520:435:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with particular attention to models with endogenous regressors.4This literature is concerned

5:169:11023:13:14:89:520:367:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ofX, but is not a reasonable assumption for models of family transfers in particular or for
5:170:11114:14:13:89:520:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:consumer expenditure problems in general. We discuss the “control function” version of our

5:173:11256:24:13:89:520:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In Section 3.1 we present the general model we treat and define the parameter of interest,
5:174:11346:13:14:89:520:268:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:B:β(x). In Section 3.2 we derive an expression forβ(x)and formally establish thatβ(x)is
5:175:11431:14:14:89:520:254:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:identified from knowledge of certain estimable functions ofx. We begin with a relatively
5:176:11519:14:13:89:520:240:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:simple model that includes the regular Tobit model as a special case and then state an
5:177:11605:13:14:89:520:227:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:identification result for the general case. We also make a brief comparison to the control
5:178:11695:14:16:89:413:213:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:function approach of Heckman (1976) and many subsequent studies.

5:180:11857:15:7:89:362:182:9:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f10:F:is identified, clearlym(x) +kfor some constantkcan be identified.

6:198:12683:14:13:89:520:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the possibility that the functionsM(X,U),L(X), andH(X)do not depend on all of the
6:199:12764:13:14:89:520:564:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:elements ofX. The linear censored regression model (i.e., the Tobit model) is a special
6:200:12851:14:13:89:520:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:case of (1) in whichUis a scalar random variable,M(X,U) =X′β+U,L(X) = 0, and

7:235:14481:14:24:89:394:617:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:B:∇GL(x) =dμ(uL(x))∇uL(x). Therefore,β(x)can be written as
7:236:14537:24:25:89:480:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:B:(5)β(x) =∇Ψ(x) +{Ψ(x)∇GM(x) +H(x)∇GH(x) +L(x)∇GL(x)}/GM(x).
7:237:14596:25:13:89:519:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The second term in (5) corrects for the fact thatxaffects selection of the population for

7:239:14774:14:14:89:517:541:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:B:be identified from knowledge of (i)Ψ(x)∇GM(x), the product of the conditional mean ofY

7:243:15111:13:14:89:520:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the derivative of the probability thatM(x,U)is belowL(x). All components are normalized
7:244:15198:14:13:89:320:473:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:byGM(x), the probability thatYis uncensored.
7:245:15242:13:14:106:520:460:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f6:A:An important special case of the above model is fixed censoring from below, i.e.,L(x) = 0
7:246:15331:14:24:89:226:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:andH(x) =∞. In this case,
7:247:15356:24:25:211:399:422:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:C:β(x) =∇Ψ(x) + Ψ(x)∇GM(x)/GM(x).
7:248:15387:25:13:89:520:397:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The case ofL(X) =cwith a known constantccan be reduced to the case ofL(X) = 0by
7:249:15466:13:14:89:366:384:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:simply subtracting offcfrom the values ofYwhenY > c.
7:250:15518:14:13:106:520:370:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We now consider the general case whereUneed not be a scalar and not be continuous
7:251:15599:13:14:89:520:357:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:andM(X,U)need not be monotonic and not be continuous inU. In particular, we impose
7:252:15681:14:26:89:215:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the following assumptions.
7:253:15707:26:25:89:239:317:11:g_d0_f22:11:g_d0_f11:C:Assumption 3.1Assume that

7:258:15895:22:14:89:520:211:11:g_d0_f22:11:g_d0_f11:C:(iv)M(x′,U)is continuously differentiable a.s.  at eachx′in a neighborhood ofx, and
7:259:15978:14:13:117:520:197:11:g_d0_f11:11:g_d0_f11:C:there exists a real-valued functionBsuch that for anyx′in a neighborhood ofx,
7:260:16055:13:0:117:260:184:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f11:C:|∇M(x′,U)|≤B(U)a.s., and

8:264:16142:0:14:106:520:755:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The first assumption is stronger than the usual conditional mean independence assump-
8:265:16227:14:13:89:520:741:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tionE[U|X] = 0in a regression framework. However, the maximum likelihood estimator
8:266:16309:13:14:89:520:728:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for the Tobit model requiresUto be a normal random variable and it is independent of
8:267:16393:14:14:89:520:714:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:B:X. In Section 6.3, we discuss a generalization to the case of endogenous regressors. The
8:268:16481:14:13:89:520:700:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:conditionL(x′)< H(x′)for allx′in a neighborhood ofxin the second assumption reflects
8:269:16565:13:14:89:520:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the definition ofLandHas the lower and upper bounds and is a regularity condition that
8:270:16651:14:13:89:520:673:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:simplifies our analysis. The fourth assumption is standard and guarantees that one may
8:271:16737:13:14:89:520:660:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:change the order of differentiation and integration. The rest of the assumptions are natural
8:272:16829:14:13:89:520:646:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:given that we wish to estimate some aspects of derivatives. Here we implicitly assume that
8:273:16919:13:14:89:520:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:all elements ofXare continuous. In Section 6.3, we discuss the case where some elements
8:274:17006:14:13:89:172:619:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ofXare discrete.
8:275:17022:13:14:106:520:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The derivation of (5) is based on the derivative formula in (4). We prove the following
8:276:17109:14:25:89:375:592:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:lemma which extends the formula in (4) to the general case.
8:277:17168:25:29:89:265:567:11:g_d0_f22:11:g_d0_f11:C:Lemma 3.1Under Assumption 3.1,

8:284:17290:29:14:106:520:480:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The proof is contained in the appendix. We emphasize that this lemma applies to any
8:285:17373:14:14:89:520:466:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:random objectUwith the probability measureμand the region of integration need not
8:286:17454:14:13:89:520:452:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:be rectangular. In particular,Umay be a vector andM(X,U)need not be monotone in
8:287:17533:13:14:89:520:439:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:B:U. WhenL(x)  =−∞, the last term on the right hand side does not appear and when
8:288:17612:14:13:89:520:425:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:B:H(x) =∞, the second term on the right hand side does not appear. From the definition of
8:289:17699:13:26:89:423:412:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:B:β(x)in (3), this lemma directly implies the identification result in (5).
8:290:17772:26:25:89:471:386:11:g_d0_f22:11:g_d0_f11:C:Theorem 3.1Under Assumption 3.1, the expression forβ(x)in (5) holds true.
8:291:17845:25:14:106:520:361:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f6:A:Based on this theorem, we derive nonparametric and semiparametric estimators ofβ(x)
8:292:17928:14:13:89:520:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the next two sections. We close this section by a brief comparison with the control function
8:293:18023:13:14:89:520:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:approach, such as Heckman (1976).  Consider the standard Tobit model for simplicity.
8:294:18107:14:13:89:520:320:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The conventional control function approach is: (i) obtain the conditional mean function
8:295:18194:13:14:89:520:307:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f6:C:E[Y|X=x,Y >0]  =xβ+Q(x)parametrically or semiparametrically, whereQ(x)  =
8:296:18267:14:14:89:520:293:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:B:E[U|X=x,Y >0], and then (ii) estimateβandQ(x)jointly. In contrast, our approach
8:297:18346:14:13:89:159:279:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is: (i) estimate
8:298:18362:13:20:220:390:266:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f3:C:∇E[Y|X=x,Y >0] =β+∇Q(x),
8:299:18386:20:14:89:520:246:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and then (ii) estimate the correction term∇Q(x)to estimateβ. More generally,β(x)is
8:300:18468:14:13:89:520:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:given by (5), where the last three terms on the right hand side correspond to the correction
8:301:18560:13:14:89:520:219:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:terms for sample selection. We emphasize that our approach can handle general random
8:302:18644:14:0:89:399:205:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:object including a random function, and nonadditive error terms.
9:303:18709:0:25:89:297:755:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:4  Nonparametric Estimation
9:304:18736:25:13:89:520:730:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Based on Theorem 3.1, we estimate the parameter of interestβ(x)by replacing the unknown
9:305:18823:13:14:89:520:717:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:functions ofxon the right hand side of (5) with either parametric or nonparametric estima-
9:306:18913:14:13:89:520:703:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tors. This section considers the nonparametric case. We first propose a fully nonparametric
9:307:19004:13:14:89:520:690:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimator ofβ(x). Since the fully nonparametric approach may not be useful in multivariate
9:308:19094:14:13:89:520:676:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:applications because of the curse of dimensionality, we also propose an estimator for the
9:309:19183:13:30:89:253:663:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:average ofβ(x)over a range ofX.
9:310:19214:30:20:89:319:633:12:g_d0_f15:12:g_d0_f19:C:4.1  Estimation ofβ(x), L(x), andH(x)
9:311:19251:20:14:89:520:613:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:To estimateβ(x)from (5), we need to estimate the unknown functionsΨ(x),∇Ψ(x),GM(x),
9:312:19334:14:13:89:520:599:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:B:∇GL(x),∇GH(x),L(x), andH(x).  Observe thatΨ(x),∇Ψ(x),GM(x),∇GL(x), and
9:313:19404:13:14:89:520:586:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:B:∇GH(x)are written as conditional mean functions or their derivatives. Thus, we can apply
9:314:19492:14:13:89:520:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:any standard nonparametric estimator, such as the kernel or series estimator.  Here we
9:315:19578:13:14:89:520:559:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:employ the local polynomial estimator (see, e.g., Fan and Gijbels (1996)). In addition to
9:316:19667:14:14:89:520:545:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the statistical benefits discussed by Fan (1992), an additional benefit of the local polynomial
9:317:19762:14:13:89:520:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimator is that we can estimate the conditional mean function and its derivatives at

10:394:22651:25:26:89:491:396:11:g_d0_f22:11:g_d0_f11:C:Lemma 4.1Suppose that for some sequence{rn}n∈Nsatisfyingrn→∞asn→∞,

10:402:22924:25:14:106:520:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The proof follows from the continuous mapping theorem.  This lemma says that the
10:403:23004:14:13:89:520:268:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:first order asymptotics ofˆβ(x)are driven by those ofˆD(x), the vector of nonparametric
10:404:23091:13:14:89:520:255:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimators of derivatives of conditional mean functions. The estimatorsˆc(x)ofc(x)can
10:405:23176:14:13:89:520:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:be treated as constants to the first order. Condition 1 is satisfied by most nonparametric
10:406:23266:13:14:89:520:228:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimators by adequately choosing the convergence ratern. Note that the raterntypically
10:407:23353:14:13:89:520:214:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:depends on the number of regressorsk(i.e., the curse of dimensionality). For Condition 2,
10:408:23442:13:14:89:520:201:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:we need to guarantee faster convergence rates forˆΨ(x),ˆGM(x),ˆL(x), andˆH(x)thanr−1n.
10:409:23528:14:14:89:520:187:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:For the estimators of the conditional mean functionsˆΨ(x)andˆGM(x), it is known that
10:410:23612:14:13:89:520:173:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the optimal convergence rate of nonparametric estimators of the conditional mean is faster
10:411:23702:13:0:89:520:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:than that of its derivatives (see, Stone (1980)). For the nonparametric quantile regression
11:412:23794:0:14:89:520:755:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimatorsˆL(x)andˆH(x)with drifting quantilesτn, we can apply the asymptotic theory of

11:414:23969:13:14:106:520:728:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We now describe a concrete version of the above lemma. We first consider the compo-

12:478:25710:14:13:89:520:741:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Assumption 4.1 (i) is on the sampling of data. It is possible to extend the setup to allow
12:479:25800:13:14:89:520:728:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:weakly dependent data (see, Masry (1996a)). Assumption 4.1 (ii) says that the probability

12:481:25970:14:13:89:520:700:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is positive atx. These are natural conditions given that we are trying to estimateβ(x).
12:482:26057:13:14:89:520:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Assumption 4.1 (iii) is on the smoothness of the estimand functionsΨ,GM,GH, andGLto
12:483:26140:14:13:89:520:673:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:be estimated. Assumption 4.1 (iv) restricts the shape of the kernel function. For example,
12:484:26230:13:15:89:520:660:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the triangle kernel and Epanechnikov kernel satisfy this condition.  Assumption 4.1 (v)
12:485:26317:15:13:89:520:645:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:contains standard conditions for the bandwidthhn. The conditionnhk+2p+2n→0is used
12:486:26398:13:14:89:520:632:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to eliminate the asymptotic bias term in the local polynomial estimator. Note that if the
12:487:26487:14:13:89:520:618:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:dimension of the regressorskis higher, then the convergence rate of the estimator becomes
12:488:26576:13:14:89:520:605:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:slower (i.e., the curse of dimensionality).  The results onˆΨ(x)andˆGM(x)are obtained
12:489:26661:14:0:89:178:591:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from the fact that

12:495:26822:13:14:89:520:564:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:vectorcG(x)is not proportional to(1,1,1)′. If it is, thenL(x) =H(x)and it contradicts
12:496:26907:14:13:89:520:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:withGM(x)>0in Assumption 4.1 (ii). In order to conduct inference onβ(x), we need to
12:497:26990:13:14:89:520:537:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimate the asymptotic varianceV(x). The matricesMandΓcan be evaluated analytically,
12:498:27075:14:13:89:520:523:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:typically, and always by numerical integration, and the functionsσ2M(x),GM(x),Ω(x), and
12:499:27162:13:14:89:520:510:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f6:C:f(x)can be consistently estimated by some nonparametric estimators. Note thatGM(x)
12:500:27244:14:13:89:519:496:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:andΩ(x)may be estimated from the constant terms of the local polynomial estimators for

12:502:27352:14:13:106:520:469:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We next consider the local polynomial quantile regression estimatorsˆL(x)andˆH(x).
12:503:27434:13:14:89:520:456:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:For simplicity we focus on the lower bound estimatorˆL(x). Similar results hold for the
12:504:27521:14:14:89:520:442:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:upper bound estimatorˆH(x). Recall that the sample size is denotednandbndenotes the

12:506:27692:10:17:91:520:418:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f2:B:ˆL(x)crucially depends on the convergence rate of the drifting quantileτnto0, and can be
12:507:27780:17:13:89:520:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:analyzed by splitting into three cases: (i) extreme case (nbknτn→0), (ii) intermediate case
12:508:27871:13:14:89:520:388:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(nbknτn→ ∞), and (iii) edge case (nbknτn→c >0). For the extreme case, the quantile
12:509:27953:14:13:89:520:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:regression estimatorˆL(x)is asymptotically equivalent to a linear programming estimator,
12:510:28041:13:14:89:520:361:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and its asymptotic properties are investigated by Chernozhukov (1998). The intermediate
12:511:28128:14:13:89:520:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:case is considered by Ichimura, Otsu and Altonji (2008). Although the asymptotics of the
12:512:28216:13:14:89:520:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:edge case are an open area for research in this nonparametric setup, we conjecture that
12:513:28303:14:13:89:520:320:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the results analogous to Chernozhukov (2005) hold. Here we present the convergence rate
12:514:28390:13:14:89:520:307:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ofˆL(x)andˆH(x)for the intermediate case.5LetBxbe some fixed closed ball aroundx.
12:515:28471:14:14:89:519:293:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Based on Ichimura, Otsu and Altonji (2008), the convergence rates ofˆL(x)andˆH(x)are

13:567:30643:13:14:106:520:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Theorem 4.1 shows that our estimatorˆβ(x)converges toβ(x)at a rate that depends on

13:571:30983:14:13:89:519:227:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:way to circumvent the curse of dimensionality is to focus on the averages ofβ(x)over a

14:634:33317:14:13:89:520:270:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:technically challenging, these higher level assumptions may be replaced with more primitive

14:640:33808:13:14:89:520:189:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:practice, empirical researchers are typically interested in the behavior ofβ(x)over some fixed
14:641:33902:14:16:89:519:175:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:subset of the support ofX. Second, as a technical matter, averaging over the trimming set
14:642:33991:16:0:102:266:159:6:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f10:F:7See, Ichimura, Otsu and Altonji (2008).

15:722:35862:24:14:89:520:168:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Imposing a priori information about potential functional forms is the most obvious way to
15:723:35951:14:0:89:520:154:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:circumvent the curse of dimensionality. One way to impose a parametric specification is to
16:724:36043:0:14:89:520:755:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:specifyM(x,u),L(x),H(x), and the distribution ofUparametrically. This approach always
16:725:36128:14:13:89:520:741:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:leads to a parametric model which is consistent with the model (1). However, we may not

16:727:36306:14:14:89:520:714:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is to specifyΨ(x),GH(x),GL(x),L(x), andH(x)parametrically without specifying the
16:728:36386:14:32:89:436:700:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:distribution form ofU. We consider the following semiparametric model:

17:822:39991:14:14:106:520:222:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We close this section by noting that an alternative or complementary strategy is to
17:823:40074:14:13:89:520:208:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:make use of linear index restrictions in the spirit of Ichimura and Lee (1991). One could
17:824:40163:13:14:89:520:195:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:specify the model asM(x′θM,U),L(x′θL),H(x′θH),GL(x′θL,x′θM), andGH(x′θH,x′θM),
17:825:40241:14:13:89:520:181:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:whereM,L,H,GL, andGHare nonparametric functions. These restrictions imply that

17:827:40394:14:0:89:520:154:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Using the methods of Ichimura and Lee (1991), it would be relatively straightforward to
18:828:40483:0:14:89:520:755:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:implement the estimator with the index restrictions imposed. It might also be possible to
18:829:40572:14:13:89:520:741:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:work with partially linear specifications of theM, GL, andGHfunctions using a two-step

18:831:40737:14:34:89:444:714:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Finally, Lemma 5.1 may provide a way to further restrict the specification.

18:834:40875:21:13:89:520:634:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Thus far we have discussed estimation of the average derivatives ofYwith respect toX,
18:835:40960:13:14:89:519:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:B:and our assumptions rule out discrete regressors. This section considers the case whereX
18:836:41048:14:13:89:519:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f6:B:contains both continuous and discrete elements. We assume we can partitionXintoX=

18:840:41368:14:13:89:520:553:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:above to allow estimation ofβC(xC,xD). However, estimation of the effect ofXDraises
18:841:41451:13:14:89:520:540:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:issues of identification.  For notational simplicity, assumeXDis a scalar binary random

20:908:44542:21:13:89:520:734:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:This section considers the effect of measurement error in the dependent variableY. Consider
20:909:44633:13:14:89:520:721:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a special case, whereH(x) =∞andL(x) = 0(or some known constant). In this special

20:913:44813:25:13:89:519:641:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f6:B:respectively, whereIRis a Bernoulli random variable (IRis1with probabilitypand is0

20:918:45224:13:25:89:325:574:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:B:forY, respectively. The definition ofY∗implies10

20:921:45320:25:13:89:520:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:It follows immediately from the derivation of (5) that if one usesY∗instead ofYto estimate
20:922:45410:13:14:89:520:495:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the components ofβ(x)in (5), then the probability limit of the estimator ofβ(x)is obtained

20:924:45502:14:20:289:320:467:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:A:μβ(x).
20:925:45508:20:13:89:520:447:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Hence, random variationIRin whether the value ofYis reported whenIM(X) = 1does
20:926:45586:13:14:89:520:434:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:not affect the probability limit of the estimator provided that the report ofYis unbiased
20:927:45675:14:13:89:520:420:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(i.e.,E[Y∗|Y=y,IM(X) = 1] =y), even if a fraction of respondents withY > L(X)report
20:928:45758:13:14:89:520:407:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:B:I∗M= 0. The same conclusions go through ifY∗=I∗Mf(Y,e)under the assumptions that
20:929:45838:14:13:89:520:393:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the measurement error componenteis distributed independently of(X,U,IR)and that the

20:931:46001:14:13:89:316:366:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the measurement error can be generalized a bit.
20:932:46048:13:14:106:520:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f6:A:Unfortunately, measurement error inYin the form of (10) is a serious problem ifL(x)
20:933:46131:14:14:89:520:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:has to be estimated, because the conditional quantiles ofY∗andYwill not coincide. The
20:934:46216:14:13:89:519:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimators ofL(x)andβ(x)are consistent even ifpis less than1providede1=  1and
20:935:46293:13:14:89:520:312:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:B:e2= 0. When bothL(x)andH(x)must be estimated, then both forms of measurement
20:936:46369:14:29:89:216:298:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:error lead to inconsistency.

20:944:46809:15:0:89:221:163:9:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f10:F:the indicator for whetherY >0.
21:945:46841:0:14:89:520:755:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:This assumption is strong, but will be hard to avoid unless one is willing to impose addi-

21:947:47017:13:14:89:520:728:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f6:B:assumption implies thatdμ(u|φ(w),v) =dμ(u|v)for allv, wheredμ(u|φ(w),v)anddμ(u|v)

22:1003:49587:14:13:106:520:673:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:A number of papers in the literature discuss estimation in nonseparable models with

22:1028:51191:11:11:89:520:321:9:g_d0_f12:9:g_d0_f10:F:β(x)so it is not surprising that stronger assumptions are required. Note thatβ(x)is what Altonji and
22:1029:51291:11:11:89:520:310:9:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f12:F:Matzkin (2005) call a local average response. It is the average partial effect of an exogenous change inx

24:1100:56271:13:14:89:520:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the OLS and probit maximum likelihood estimators. For the nonparametric version of our
24:1101:56357:14:13:89:520:619:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimator and the Tobit maximum likelihood, we do not report estimated standard errors
24:1102:56443:13:14:89:172:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:or coverage rates.
24:1103:56461:14:11:106:520:592:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The results are quite striking. For all cases AIO-SP is less biased than Tobit to estimate
24:1104:56551:11:16:90:519:581:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f8:C: ̄βandβ(x). Consider, for example, the first panel of Table 1, whereM(X,U)  =  1.0−
24:1105:56634:16:14:89:520:565:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f2:B:0.5X+XU+U. For this specificationβ(x)ranges from -0.212 whenxis 0 to 0.429 when
24:1106:56713:14:13:89:520:551:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:B:xis 4.  The Monte Carlo mean of Ave.βby AIO-SP is 0.229, while the true value is
24:1107:56793:13:14:89:520:538:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:0.210. Forβ(x), the Monte Carlo means of AIO-SP are -0.029 forβ(.4) =−0.027, 0.056
24:1108:56875:14:13:89:520:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f6:B:forβ(.8)  =  0.098, 0.335 forβ(2)  =  0.298, 0.325 forβ(2.8)  =.366, 0.336 forβ(3.2)  =
24:1109:56962:13:14:89:520:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:B:.391, and 0.448 forβ(3.6)  =  0.412.  Note, however, that at the boundaries, the Monte
24:1110:57048:14:13:89:520:497:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Carlo means of AIO-SP are 0.002 forβ(0)  =−0.212and 0.607 forβ(4)  =  0.429.  The
24:1111:57129:13:14:89:520:484:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:discrepancies at0and4illustrate the fact that for most specifications we tried there is
24:1112:57216:14:13:89:520:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:substantial bias near the boundaries of the support ofX.16The standard deviations are
24:1113:57301:13:14:89:520:457:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:also large near the boundaries of the support ofXin almost all of the experiments. Based on
24:1114:57392:14:14:89:520:443:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:our preliminary simulation study (not reported here), this reflects the large sampling errors
24:1115:57485:14:13:89:520:429:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in∇Ψ(x;ˆθ1)and∇GM(x;ˆθ2)near the boundaries of the support ofX, and these sampling
24:1116:57567:13:14:89:520:416:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:errors are magnified inΨ(x;ˆθ1)/GM(x;ˆθ2). The relative importance of these two sources of
24:1117:57657:14:13:89:520:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the sampling error varies to some extent with the design. Overall, however, AIO-SP does a
24:1118:57746:13:14:89:479:389:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:good job of fitting ̄βand trackingβ(x), particularly betweenx= 0.4andx= 3.6.
24:1119:57822:14:13:106:520:375:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f6:A:The results for AIO-NP are also encouraging. In many instances it is even closer toβ(x)
24:1120:57909:13:14:89:520:362:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:than AIO-SP in terms of the Monte Carlo means. Interestingly, in all but two instances,
24:1121:57996:14:20:89:520:348:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the nonparametric version has a smaller sampling variance at the boundariesx= 0and4.
24:1122:58080:20:11:89:520:328:9:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f10:F:and then (ii) compute the adjusted bandwidth asbm′=bm(n1/5/n1/7). We use this adjustment because the
24:1123:58180:11:9:89:520:317:9:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f10:F:dominant components that drive the asymptotics of the estimatorˆβ(x)are the estimators for the derivatives
24:1124:58286:9:13:91:520:308:9:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f10:F:ˆD(x)(see, Lemma 4.1), and because the optimal bandwidths to estimate the conditional mean function and
24:1125:58389:13:11:89:520:295:9:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f10:F:its first-order derivative take the form ofcmn−1/5andcm′n−1/7, respectively. The simulation results are in
24:1126:58495:11:11:89:520:284:9:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f10:F:Table 4. Overall, the performance is similar to that of the uniform kernel particularly in the range between
24:1127:58603:11:7:89:167:273:9:g_d0_f12:9:g_d0_f10:F:x=.4andx= 3.6.
24:1128:58617:7:15:98:520:266:6:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f10:F:15One can obtain standard errors of the Monte Carlo means by dividing the reported standard deviations
24:1129:58719:15:0:89:99:251:9:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f10:F:by
24:1130:58721:0:8:102:110:259:9:g_d0_f14:9:g_d0_f14:F:√
24:1131:58722:8:7:110:161:251:9:g_d0_f13:9:g_d0_f10:F:4000or 63.2.
24:1132:58734:7:15:98:520:244:6:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f10:F:16We obtained similar results forn= 500, so small sample bias does not appear to be the main problem.
24:1133:58835:15:11:89:519:229:9:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f10:F:The bias appears to be a consequence of minor misspecification ofΨ(x;θ1)andGM(x;θ2)for the behavior
24:1134:58934:11:11:89:520:218:9:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f10:F:of the estimator ofOΨ(x;θ1)andOGM(x;θ2)near the boundaries of the support ofX. To isolate the role of
24:1135:59035:11:11:89:520:207:9:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f10:F:functional form, we performed the following experiment. For one set of parameter values, we computed the
24:1136:59139:11:11:89:520:196:9:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f10:F:true values ofΨ(x)andGM(x)implied by Model 1. We then estimatedΨ(x)by regressing the uncensored
24:1137:59234:11:11:89:520:185:9:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f10:F:values ofYon a third order polynomial in the trueΨ(x). We estimatedGM(x)using a probit model with
24:1138:59331:11:11:89:520:174:9:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f10:F:the probit index specified to be a cubic function in the true value ofΦ−1(GM(x)),whereΦ−1(·)is the inverse
24:1139:59437:11:0:89:511:163:9:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f10:F:of the standard normal CDF. The estimator was essentially unbiased for values ofxbetween 0.01 and 4.
25:1140:59539:0:14:89:520:755:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:This superior performance near the boundaries may reflect the effects of heteroskedasticity
25:1141:59630:14:13:89:520:741:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on the efficiency of OLS in the semiparametric case. (Ignoring the effects of censoring, the
25:1142:59722:13:14:89:520:728:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:error variance rises with the square ofxwhenα26=  0.)17In contrast, Tobit is severely
25:1143:59807:14:14:89:491:714:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:biased to estimate ̄βandβ(x)and is also very noisy near the boundary values ofX.
25:1144:59887:14:13:106:520:700:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The results in Panel 3, whereM(X,U) =−1 +XU+U, are also quite interesting. In
25:1145:59964:13:14:89:520:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:this case, the Monte Carlo mean of Ave.βof Tobit is 0.918 which is reasonably close to the
25:1146:60054:14:13:89:520:673:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:true value of ̄β= 1.046. However, the Monte Carlo mean of Ave.βof AIO-SP is 1.034 and
25:1147:60139:13:14:89:520:660:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is better than Tobit. Both AIO-SP and AIO-NP do a good job of tracking the variation
25:1148:60223:14:13:89:520:646:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:inβ(x)in this experiment at least betweenx=.4andx= 3.6,while the Tobit does very
25:1149:60303:13:14:89:122:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:poorly.
25:1150:60310:14:13:106:519:619:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f6:A:In Panel 6 we report the results for an experiment in whichα2=  0. Note that ̄β=
25:1151:60390:13:14:89:520:606:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:B:β(x) =α1in this case and Tobit is the maximum likelihood estimator for the problem. All
25:1152:60477:14:13:89:520:592:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:estimators are essentially unbiased, and perhaps surprisingly, AIO-SP is almost as efficient
25:1153:60569:13:14:89:520:579:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:as Tobit. However, we find that if one uses Tobit withα0+α1X, the true form, imposed
25:1154:60653:14:11:89:520:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:as the Tobit index, then Tobit sd of the estimates ofα1is about half of that of AIO-SP for
25:1155:60743:11:16:90:480:554:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f2:B: ̄βand is between 1/9th and 2/5ths as large forβ(x)betweenx= 0.4andx= 3.6.
25:1156:60817:16:14:106:520:538:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:What about inference? The asymptotic standard error estimates of AIO-SP closely track
25:1157:60902:14:13:89:520:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the standard deviations of the estimators and the coverage rates are close to0.9in all cases,
25:1158:60995:13:14:89:519:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:even at the boundary values. Both se and sd of AIO-SP depend onV ar(α2XU+U)and

25:1160:61162:13:14:89:520:484:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:related to the number of uncensored values in the neighborhood ofx, although we do not
25:1161:61248:14:13:89:520:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:provide enough information to infer this from the tables.  The Monte Carlo simulations
25:1162:61334:13:14:89:441:457:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:indicate that the standard errors based on the delta method perform well.
25:1163:61407:14:14:106:520:443:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In Table 2 we report the Monte Carlo results for AIO-SP, AIO-NP, and Tobit under
25:1164:61487:14:24:89:176:429:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Model 2, which is:
25:1165:61505:24:17:181:427:405:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:A:Model 2:M(X,U)   =α0+α1X+α2XU1+U2,

25:1167:61558:24:14:89:520:364:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:whereU1followsN(0,1),U2followsN(0,1), andXfollowsU(0,4).  SinceU2does not
25:1168:61631:14:13:89:520:350:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:interact withX, Model 2 is closer to a Tobit model than Model 1. Consequently, one would
25:1169:61719:13:14:89:520:337:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:expect that the presence ofU2would lead to improvement in the Tobit estimator from Table
25:1170:61807:14:13:89:520:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:1 relative to AIO-SP and AIO-NP for the same parameter values. The results for Panels
25:1171:61892:13:14:89:520:310:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:1-4 in Tables 1 and 2 support this conjecture. Although the results are not reported here,
25:1172:61982:14:13:89:520:296:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:increasing the variance ofU2reduces the amount of bias in Tobit. However, in a number of
25:1173:62070:13:14:89:520:283:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cases Tobit is still substantially biased. Our AIO-SP and AIO-NP are essentially unbiased
25:1174:62159:14:13:89:520:269:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for ̄βand also tracks the true values ofβ(x)reasonably closely whenxis between 0.4 and
25:1175:62245:13:14:89:161:256:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:3.6 in all cases.
25:1176:62262:14:15:98:520:242:6:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f10:F:17It also may reflect the possibility that for the window width we have chosen, the functional forms implicit

26:1201:63723:14:13:89:520:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:andL(X)  =.5X. For this specification,β(x)  =  1for allx. The Monte Carlo mean of
26:1202:63804:13:14:89:519:454:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:AIO-SP is very close to 1 for all values ofx, and the coverage rates are close to 0.9. The
26:1203:63894:14:13:89:520:440:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Monte Carlo mean ofˆa0andˆa1are 0.001 and 0.565, respectively. Thus there is a small
26:1204:63978:13:14:89:520:427:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:positive bias in the estimation ofL(x), which is not surprising given our use of the third
26:1205:64068:14:13:89:520:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:centile. In Panel 1 the censored regression model is correctly specified and the censored
26:1206:64157:13:14:89:520:400:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Tobit is the maximum likelihood estimator for the problem. Not surprisingly, it does very
26:1207:64246:14:14:89:110:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:well.
26:1208:64251:14:13:106:520:372:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In the remaining panels we consider several specifications in whichα2differs from0,
26:1209:64334:13:14:89:519:359:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:soβ(x)varies and the censored regression model is misspecified. In all of the cases, the
26:1210:64422:14:13:89:520:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Monte Carlo mean of AIO-SP tracksβ(x)closely betweenx=.4andx= 3.6. For all of
26:1211:64499:13:14:89:520:332:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the specifications in Table 3, se tracks sd well and coverages of 90% confidence intervals are
26:1212:64593:14:13:89:479:318:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:close to 0.9. The censored regression model is biased for ̄βand fails to trackβ(x).
26:1213:64676:13:14:106:520:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We repeated the experiments in Tables 1 and 2 for sample sizes of 500 (not reported).
26:1214:64761:14:13:89:520:291:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The behaviors of AIO-SP for ̄βandβ(x)are quite similar. Although AIO-SP se and sd
26:1215:64842:13:14:89:520:278:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:typically double, coverage rates remain close to 0.9.  It is likely, however, that in small
26:1216:64933:14:13:89:520:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:samples the mean squared error can be improved if one is more parsimonious in specifying
26:1217:65021:13:14:89:285:251:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f2:B:Ψ(x;θ1)andP(x;θ2)than we have been.
26:1218:65056:14:16:106:365:237:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Overall, the Monte Carlo results are very encouraging.
26:1219:65110:16:15:98:520:221:6:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f10:F:18We did not bother to estimate standard errors forˆa0andˆa1. Recall that under our assumptions the
26:1220:65209:15:11:89:520:206:9:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f10:F:asymptotic distribution ofˆβ(x)is not influenced by sampling errors inˆa0andˆa1. The asymptotic standard
26:1221:65313:11:0:89:417:195:9:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f10:F:error estimates ofˆβ(x)are calculated by the delta method, as in Models 1 and 2.
27:1222:65395:0:25:89:194:755:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:8  Conclusions
27:1223:65409:25:13:89:520:730:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We provide an estimator for partial derivatives in nonseparable limited dependent variables
27:1224:65500:13:14:89:520:717:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:models, with and without endogenous variables. We place almost no restrictions on the
27:1225:65585:14:13:89:520:703:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:function that determines the dependent variable. The basic idea is to first estimate the
27:1226:65673:13:14:89:520:690:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:derivatives of the regression function relating the dependent variable to the explanatory
27:1227:65762:14:13:89:520:676:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:variables on the uncensored sample, and then correct for the effects of sample selection. The
27:1228:65855:13:14:89:520:663:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:correction term for the derivative has a simple structure and can be estimated quite easily.
27:1229:65947:14:14:89:520:649:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:For example, if the censoring point is known and one chooses to use flexible parametric forms,
27:1230:66041:14:13:89:520:635:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the estimator can be computed using a regression program and a probit or logit program.
27:1231:66128:13:14:89:520:622:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:If the censoring points are not known, then in addition one requires a quantile regression
27:1232:66218:14:13:89:520:608:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:program such asqregin STATA. The nonparametric version can be implemented using a
27:1233:66299:13:14:89:520:595:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:local polynomial regression routine and a quantile regression that allows weights, such as
27:1234:66389:14:13:89:520:581:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:thelpolyandqregpackages in STATA. We provide encouraging Monte Carlo evidence for
27:1235:66470:13:14:89:520:568:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:cases in which the outcome is censored at 0 and cases in which the censoring point is an
27:1236:66558:14:13:89:520:554:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:unknown linear function of an explanatory variable. The estimator has been successfully
27:1237:66645:13:14:89:251:541:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:applied in a few empirical studies.
27:1238:66680:14:13:106:520:527:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:When the censoring point is known the estimator is robust to random misclassification
27:1239:66765:13:14:89:520:514:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of some uncensored observations as censored and to measurement error in the dependent
27:1240:66850:14:14:89:520:500:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:variable, provided that the mean of the report conditional on the explanatory variables is
27:1241:66940:14:13:89:520:486:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:unbiased. A version of the estimator that can be used in the case of endogenous explanatory
27:1242:67031:13:14:89:520:473:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:variables in some circumstances, such as when an exogenous determinant ofXis available
27:1243:67117:14:13:89:520:459:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:or in panel data that satisfy the exchangeability conditions used in Altonji and Matzkin

27:1245:67231:14:13:106:520:432:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In future research, it would be valuable to examine whether the estimator can be ex-
27:1246:67315:13:14:89:520:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:tended to the case ofstochasticcensoring functionsL(x;η)andH(x;η), whereηis a random
27:1247:67399:14:0:89:353:405:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:vector, which would cover a very broad class of models.

35:1730:79246:13:20:89:390:403:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:B:f2, respectively. For these distributions we construct a function
