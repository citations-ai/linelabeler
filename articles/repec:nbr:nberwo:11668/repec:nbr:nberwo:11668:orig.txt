2:28:1244:58:19:71:539:551:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This paper develops a dynamic, life-cycle, general equilibrium model to study the interdependent
2:29:1340:19:18:71:539:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:demographic, fiscal, and economic transition paths of China, Japan, the U.S., and the EU. Each of
2:30:1437:18:20:71:539:514:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:these  countries/regions  is  entering  a  period  of  rapid  and  significant  aging  requiring  major  fiscal
2:31:1548:20:26:71:131:494:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:adjustments.
2:32:1560:26:21:71:539:468:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:In previous studies that excluded China we predicted that tax hikes needed to pay benefits along the
2:33:1660:21:22:71:539:447:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:developed world's demographic transition would lead to capital shortage, reducing real wages per
2:34:1756:22:21:71:539:425:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:unit of human capital. Adding China to the model dramatically alters this prediction. Even though
2:35:1853:21:21:71:539:404:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:China is aging rapidly, its saving behavior, growth rate, and fiscal policies are very different from
2:36:1954:21:21:71:539:383:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:those  of  developed  countries.  If  this  continues  to  be  the  case,  the  model's  long  run  looks  much
2:37:2065:21:27:71:112:362:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:brighter.
2:38:2074:27:21:71:539:335:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:China eventually becomes the world's saver and, thereby, the developed world's savoir with respect
2:39:2172:21:21:71:539:314:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to its long-run supply of capital and long-run general equilibrium prospects. And, rather than seeing
2:40:2273:21:21:71:539:293:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the real wage per unit of human capital fall, the West and Japan see it rise by one fifth by 2030 and
2:41:2374:21:21:71:539:272:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:by three fifths by 2100. These wage increases are over and above those associated with technical
2:42:2470:21:50:71:114:251:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:progress.

3:66:2829:30:22:72:540:691:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:This paper develops a dynamic, life-cycle, general equilibrium model to study the interde-
3:67:2919:22:21:43:539:669:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:pendent demographic, fiscal, and economic transition paths of China, Japan, the U.S.,and the
3:68:3011:21:22:43:539:648:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:EU. Each of these countries/regions is entering a period of rapid and significant aging that will
3:69:3108:22:22:43:539:626:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:require major fiscal adjustments.  But the aging of these societies may be a cloud with a silver
3:70:3204:22:29:43:482:604:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:lining coming, in this case, in the form of capital deepening that will raise real wages.
3:71:3293:29:22:72:540:575:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:In a previous model that excluded China we predicted that tax hikes needed to pay benefits
3:72:3383:22:22:43:539:553:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:along the developed world’s demographic transition would lead to a major capital shortage, re-
3:73:3477:22:21:43:539:531:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:ducing real wages per unit of human capital over time by one fifth. A recalibration of our original
3:74:3576:21:22:43:539:510:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:model that treats government purchases of capital goods as investment rather than current con-
3:75:3670:22:22:43:539:488:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:sumption suggests this concern was overstated.  With government investment included, we find
3:76:3762:22:21:43:539:466:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:much less crowding out over the course of the century and only a 4 percent long-run decline in
3:77:3856:21:30:43:99:445:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:real wages.
3:78:3867:30:22:72:540:415:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Adding China to the model further alters, indeed, dramatically alters, the model’s predic-
3:79:3957:22:21:43:539:393:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:tions. Even though China is aging rapidly, its saving behavior, growth rate, and fiscal policies are
3:80:4057:21:22:43:539:372:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:currently very different from those of developed countries.  If successive cohorts of Chinese con-
3:81:4155:22:22:43:539:350:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:tinue to save like current cohorts, if the Chinese government can restrain growth in expenditures,
3:82:4253:22:21:43:539:328:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:and if Chinese technology and education levels ultimately catch up with those of the West and
3:83:4346:21:22:43:539:307:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Japan, the model’s long run looks much brighter. China eventually becomes the world’s saver and,
3:84:4442:22:22:43:539:285:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:thereby, the developed world’s savoir with respect to its long-run supply of capital and long-run
3:85:4539:22:21:43:539:263:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:general equilibrium prospects.  And, rather than seeing the real wage per unit of human capital
3:86:4634:21:22:43:539:242:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:fall, the West and Japan see it rise by one fifth percent by 2030 and by three fifths by 2100. These
3:87:4734:22:22:43:539:220:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:wage increases are over and above those associated with technical progress, which we model as
3:88:4827:22:29:43:369:198:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:increasing the human capital endowments of successive cohorts.
3:89:4889:29:22:72:540:169:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Even if the Chinese saving behavior (captured by its time preference rate) gradually ap-
3:90:4977:22:22:43:539:147:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:proaches that of Americans, developed world real wages per unit of human capital are roughly 17
3:91:5072:22:21:43:539:125:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:percent higher in 2030 and 4 percent higher at the end of the century. Without China they’d be
3:92:5166:21:0:43:469:104:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:only 2 percent higher in 2030 and, as mentioned, 4 percent lower at Century’s end.
4:93:5249:0:22:72:540:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:What’s more, the major short-run outflow of the developed world’s capital to China predicted
4:94:5341:22:22:43:539:699:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:by our model does not come at the cost of lower wages in the developed world.   The reason
4:95:5431:22:21:43:539:677:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:is that the knowledge that their future wages will be higher (thanks to China’s future capital
4:96:5525:21:22:43:539:656:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:accumulation) leads our model’s workers to cut back on their current labor supply. So the short-
4:97:5621:22:22:43:539:634:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:run outflow of capital to China is met with a commensurate short-run reduction in developed
4:98:5712:22:21:43:539:612:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:world labor supply, leaving the short-run ratio of physical capital to human capital, on which
4:99:5806:21:30:43:482:591:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:wages positively depend, actually somewhat higher than would otherwise be the case.
4:100:5889:30:22:72:540:561:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Our model does not capture the endogenous determination of skill premiums studied by
4:101:5973:22:21:43:539:539:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Heckman and Taber (1996). Doing so could well show that trade with China, at least in the short
4:102:6068:21:22:43:539:518:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:run, explains much of the relative decline in the wages of low-skilled workers in the developed
4:103:6163:22:22:43:539:496:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:world.  Hence, we don’t mean to suggest here that all US, EU, and Japanese workers are being
4:104:6255:22:21:43:539:474:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:helped by trade with China, but rather that trade with China is, on average, raising the wages of
4:105:6352:21:30:43:308:453:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:developed world workers and will continue to do so.
4:106:6403:30:22:72:540:423:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The notion that China, India, and other developing countries will alleviate the developed
4:107:6492:22:21:43:539:401:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:world’s demographic problems has been stressed by Siegel (2005). Our paper, although it includes
4:108:6588:21:22:43:539:380:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:only one developing country – China – supports Siegel’s optimistic long-term macroeconomic view.
4:109:6684:22:22:43:539:358:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:On the other hand, our findings about the developed world’s fiscal condition are quite troubling.
4:110:6781:22:21:43:539:336:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Even under the most favorable macroeconomic scenario,  tax rates will rise dramatically over
4:111:6873:21:22:43:539:315:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:time in the developed world to pay baby boomers their government-promised pension and health
4:112:6965:22:22:43:539:293:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:benefits.  As Argentina has so recently shown, countries can grow quite well for years even with
4:113:7061:22:21:43:539:271:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:unsustainable fiscal policies.  But if they wait too long to address those policies, the financial
4:114:7159:21:0:43:386:250:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:markets will do it for them, with often quite ruinous consequences.

5:116:7242:30:22:72:540:691:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:This paper develops a dynamic, life-cycle, general equilibrium model to study the interde-
5:117:7332:22:21:43:539:669:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:pendent demographic, fiscal, and economic transition paths of China, Japan, the U.S., and the
5:118:7425:21:22:43:539:648:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:EU. Each of these countries/regions is entering a period of rapid and significant aging that will
5:119:7522:22:22:43:539:626:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:require major fiscal adjustments. Understanding how national aging and the fiscal reaction to na-
5:120:7619:22:21:43:539:604:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:tional aging will affect the macro economies of these regions is important. If the macroeconomic
5:121:7715:21:22:43:539:583:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:response is favorable, governments can do less and take more time to deal with what’s coming. If
5:122:7811:22:30:43:410:561:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the opposite is true, governments must do more and do it more quickly.
5:123:7881:30:21:72:540:531:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Our past research (Fehr, Jokisch, and Kotlikoff (2004a,b, 2005) suggested an unfavorable
5:124:7969:21:22:43:539:510:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:macroeconomic response to national aging arising from a growing shortage of physical capital
5:125:8061:22:22:43:539:488:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:relative to human capital. This long-term capital shortage sufficed to reduce the model’s real wage
5:126:8160:22:21:43:539:466:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:per unit of human capital by 20 percent over the course of the century.  The model’s predicted
5:127:8254:21:22:43:539:445:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:major decline in capital per unit of human capital connects to the model’s predicted major rise
5:128:8349:22:22:43:539:423:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:in payroll and income tax rates.  These tax hikes, in turn, reflect the need to pay pension and
5:129:8444:22:21:43:539:401:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:health care benefits to increasingly older populations. As originally stressed by Feldstein (1974),
5:130:8543:21:22:43:539:380:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:raising taxes on workers to make transfers to the elderly reduces the amount of capital workers
5:131:8638:22:30:43:317:358:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:individually and collectively can and will accumulate.
5:132:8692:30:21:72:540:328:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:But our earlier studies, with their dismal forecasts that the interaction of aging and huge
5:133:8783:21:22:43:539:307:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:fiscal commitments to the elderly will undermine the macro economies of the developed world,
5:134:8875:22:22:43:539:285:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:omitted two issues.  Both of these issues are taken up here, and both militate against a severe
5:135:8970:22:29:43:128:263:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:capital shortage.
5:136:8987:29:22:72:540:234:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The first is government investment. In our prior studies we treated all government purchases
5:137:9079:22:22:43:539:212:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:as current consumption.  There is some logic for doing so, since many so-called government in-
5:138:9173:22:21:43:539:190:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:vestment goods (e.g., tanks, office buildings to house bureaucrats, space vehicles) may make little
5:139:9272:21:22:43:539:169:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:or no contribution to the nation’s output and productivity and, indeed, may do the opposite. On
5:140:9367:22:22:43:539:147:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the other hand,the lion’s share of government investment, be it in constructing roads, erecting
5:141:9462:22:29:43:347:125:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:schools, building research labs, does seem to be productive.
5:142:9522:29:0:72:540:96:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Treating what governments call investment as investment in the model doesn’t entirely elim-
6:143:9614:0:22:43:539:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:inate the predicted long-term capital shortage, but it does significantly mitigate it.  Compared
6:144:9710:22:22:43:539:699:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:with its 2004 value, the model’s real wage per unit of human capital in 2100 is reduced by only 4
6:145:9807:22:29:43:220:677:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:percent rather than by 20 percent.
6:146:9841:29:22:72:540:648:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The second omission is China.  As everyone knows, China is already a major producer of
6:147:9927:22:22:43:539:626:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:world output.  Its GDP now equals roughly one ninth of U.S. output.  China is also absorbing
6:148:10019:22:21:43:539:604:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Western and Japanese technology at a rapid clip. This acquisition of technology, in combination
6:149:10114:21:22:43:539:583:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:with improved education, holds the prospect for ongoing real income growth in China. But, given
6:150:10209:22:22:43:539:561:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:China’s exceptionally high saving rate, more income growth in China means more Chinese saving
6:151:10302:22:29:43:371:539:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:that can be invested in the developed world as well as in China.
6:152:10366:29:22:72:540:510:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The potential for China and other developing countries to bail out the developed world, at
6:153:10456:22:22:43:539:488:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:least in terms of its capital needs, has recently been advanced by Jeremy Siegel (2005). But China
6:154:10554:22:21:43:539:466:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:has a long way to go if it is to play such a role. China’s per capita income and wealth levels are
6:155:10652:21:22:43:539:445:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:currently only a small fraction - probably less than 15 percent - of the developed world’s levels.
6:156:10750:22:22:43:539:423:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Of course, China has lots of capitas - its population is 2.6 times the combined populations of the
6:157:10848:22:21:43:539:401:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:U.S., Japan, and the EU. Still, China’s current total holdings of wealth appear to be less than one
6:158:10947:21:30:43:539:380:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:quarter and could be easily be less than one tenth of total wealth holdings across the four regions.
6:159:11047:30:22:72:540:350:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Moreover, Chinese saving behavior may change. It’s certainly far from what one would expect
6:160:11138:22:21:43:539:328:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:to see. One would think that having low current income, but the prospect of much higher future
6:161:11232:21:22:43:539:307:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:income, would lead the Chinese to spend most of what they now produce. But, if official statistics
6:162:11330:22:22:43:539:285:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:are to be believed, nothing could be further from the truth. According to OECD (2002) data, the
6:163:11425:22:21:43:539:263:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Chinese private sector appears to be saving 40.0 percent of private available output, defined as
6:164:11521:21:22:43:539:242:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:net national income minus government purchases of goods and services. This extraordinarily high
6:165:11616:22:22:43:539:220:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Chinese private-sector saving rate explains why the Chinese are currently exporting more capital
6:166:11712:22:21:43:539:198:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:to the rest of the world than they are importing.  Based on European Commission (2005) data,
6:167:11804:21:22:43:539:177:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the comparable private-sector saving rates in the U.S., Japan, and EU are only 4.0 percent, 11.5
6:168:11900:22:30:43:242:155:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:percent, and 11.1 percent, respectively.
6:169:11940:30:21:72:540:125:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:China is also remarkable when it comes to aging. Like the developed world, China is getting
6:170:12031:21:0:43:539:104:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:older.  But it’s projected over the next half century to age much more rapidly than the U.S.,
7:171:12125:0:22:43:539:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Japan, or the EU. This doesn’t mean that China will end up older than these regions.  It just
7:172:12218:22:22:43:539:699:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:means it will make the transformation from a relatively young to a very old society much more
7:173:12311:22:29:43:334:677:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:rapidly than its trading partners in the developed world.
7:174:12368:29:22:72:540:648:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:As Table 1 details, only 6.8 percent of today’s Chinese are 65 and older compared with 17.2
7:175:12459:22:22:43:539:626:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:percent in Japan, 16.4 percent in the EU, and 12.3 percent in the U.S. In 2050, 23.6 percent of the
7:176:12558:22:21:43:539:604:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Chinese population will be 65 plus.  This is larger than the 20.6 percent elderly share projected
7:177:12655:21:22:43:539:583:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:for the U.S., but smaller than the 28.6 and 35.9 percent shares projected in the EU and Japan,
7:178:12749:22:22:43:539:561:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:respectively. So the rapidity of China’s aging doesn’t reflect where it will end up, but where it is
7:179:12849:22:29:43:86:539:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:starting.
7:180:12858:29:22:72:540:510:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The fact that China, like Japan and the West,is aging and faces significant fiscal obligations
7:181:12952:22:22:43:539:488:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:associated with that process suggests that China’s inclusion in our model would make little differ-
7:182:13051:22:21:43:539:466:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:ence to the model’s unpleasant prediction of a looming capital shortage. But because of China’s
7:183:13146:21:22:43:539:445:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:much higher rates of growth and saving and because its population is so large, adding China can,
7:184:13242:22:22:43:539:423:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:as documented below, transform a capital shortage into a capital glut. Whether or not this occurs
7:185:13339:22:21:43:539:401:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:depends on how China’s fiscal policy and saving behavior evolve.  If, over the course of the next
7:186:13436:21:22:43:539:380:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:50 years, China adopts fiscal arrangements and saving propensities that are similar to those of
7:187:13531:22:22:43:539:358:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:developing nations, China will make only a modest contribution to the world’s supply of capital,
7:188:13627:22:21:43:539:336:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:leaving real wages per unit of human capital at the end of this century only about 4 percent higher
7:189:13726:21:22:43:539:315:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:than they are today.  If, on the other hand, China limits growth in public expenditures and the
7:190:13821:22:22:43:539:293:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Chinese people continue to eschew consumption, China will save enough for its own capital needs
7:191:13916:22:21:43:539:271:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:as well as those of the developed world, leaving real wages per unit of human capital at the end
7:192:14012:21:30:43:341:250:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:of this century roughly 60 percent above the current level.
7:193:14071:30:22:72:540:220:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The usefulness of these findings depends, of course, on the realism of our model.  Our life-
7:194:14163:22:21:43:539:198:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:cycle model’s features are a mouthful. The model includes age-, region-, and year-specific fertility
7:195:14263:21:22:43:539:177:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:and mortality rates, lifespan uncertainty, age-, region-, and year-specific pension, disability, health
7:196:14366:22:22:43:539:155:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:care, and other government transfer policies, region- and year-specific government purchases of
7:197:14461:22:21:43:539:133:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:goods and services, region-specific levels of debt, high, middle, and low earners within each cohort
7:198:14561:21:0:43:539:112:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:in each region, region-specific personal wage income, capital income, corporate income, and pay-
8:199:14658:0:22:43:539:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:roll taxes, international capital mobility, technological change, quadratic costs of adjusting each
8:200:14757:22:22:43:539:699:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:region’s capital stock, age-specific inheritances, age-specific and unintended bequests, intertem-

8:204:15152:22:29:43:315:612:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:and region- and cohort-specific time preference rates.
8:205:15206:29:21:72:540:583:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:As with our other three regions, to accommodate Chinese saving behavior, we’ve set the
8:206:15292:21:22:43:539:562:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Chinese time preference rate to match the current observed saving rate for China.  And we’ve
8:207:15384:22:22:43:539:540:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:calibrated the multifactor productivity coefficient in the Chinese production function to match
8:208:15479:22:21:43:539:518:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the current observed Chinese relative wage. The big questions with respect to China’s calibration,
8:209:15577:21:22:43:539:497:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:however, are not how to treat current saving preferences and technology, but rather how to model
8:210:15673:22:29:43:254:475:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:future saving preferences and technology.
8:211:15714:29:22:72:540:446:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Consider first the issue of technology. It seems reasonable to believe that the level of Chinese
8:212:15810:22:21:43:539:424:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:technology will converge to that of the West.  The unknown is the rate of convergence.  In this
8:213:15905:21:22:43:539:403:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:study we assume that the Chinese multi-factor productivity coefficient rises gradually, reaching
8:214:16001:22:22:43:539:381:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the U.S., Japanese, and EU rates by mid century. But we also consider slower and faster rates of
8:215:16097:22:29:43:177:359:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:technological convergence.
8:216:16123:29:21:72:540:330:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Now consider modelling future Chinese saving behavior.  Here we examine two alternative
8:217:16210:21:22:43:539:309:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:assumptions. The first is that the Chinese time preference rate remains fixed through time at the
8:218:16307:22:22:43:539:287:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:very low rate needed to calibrate the current Chinese saving rate.  The second is that successive
8:219:16404:22:21:43:539:265:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:cohorts of Chinese gradually adopt Western saving behavior such that the Chinese born in 2050
8:220:16497:21:34:43:415:244:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:and thereafter have the same time preference rate as Americans in 2004.
8:221:16568:34:29:43:252:210:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:II. Our Model and Its Predecessors
8:222:16602:29:21:72:540:181:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The  development  of  dynamic  life-cycle  simulation  models  was  stimulated  by  Feldstein’s
8:223:16697:21:22:43:539:160:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:(1974) article contending that government pension systems lower national saving. Early dynamic
8:224:16791:22:22:43:539:138:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:analysis of government pension programs and other policies include Kotlikoff (1979), Summers
8:225:16883:22:21:43:539:116:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:(1981), Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1983, 1987), and Seidman (1986). More recent papers have con-

9:234:17654:30:22:72:540:561:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:This model, like our previous ones, builds on Auerbach-Kotlikoff’s (1987) overlapping gen-
9:235:17744:22:21:43:539:539:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:eration (OLG) model. Auerbach and Kotlikoff also simulated demographic transitions, but their
9:236:17837:21:22:43:539:518:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:model assumed that all agents gave birth at a fixed age, died and bequeathed at a fixed age,
9:237:17929:22:22:43:539:496:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:and received inheritances at a fixed age.  Kotlikoff, Smetters, and Walliser (2001) advanced the
9:238:18025:22:21:43:539:474:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Auerbach-Kotlikoff model by incorporating age-specific fertility and inheritance, lifespan exten-
9:239:18122:21:22:43:539:453:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:sion, intragenerational earnings heterogeneity, and additional fiscal institutions.  Fehr, Jokisch,
9:240:18221:22:22:43:539:431:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:and Kotlikoff (2004a,b, 2005) included lifespan uncertainty as well as bequests arising from in-
9:241:18317:22:21:43:539:409:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:complete annuitization. They also introduced multiple regions with international capital mobility
9:242:18414:21:30:43:131:388:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:and immigration.
9:243:18430:30:22:72:540:358:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:As in Kotlikoff, Smetters, and Walliser (2001), our model features monozygotic reproduction
9:244:18521:22:21:43:539:336:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:with agents in their child-bearing years giving birth each year to fractions of children. This means
9:245:18621:21:22:43:539:315:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:of finessing marriage and family formation permits us to incorporate changes through time in age-
9:246:18718:22:22:43:539:293:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:specific fertility rates and to closely line up our model’s age-specific population shares to those
9:247:18817:22:29:43:188:271:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:forecast for the four regions.
9:248:18847:29:22:72:540:242:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:We assume that agents care about their children’s utility when they are young and, as a con-
9:249:18939:22:22:43:539:220:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:sequence, make consumption expenditures on behalf of their children (pay for their consumption),
9:250:19035:22:21:43:539:198:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:but only when the children are young.  We also assume that agents die with realistic mortal-
9:251:19127:21:22:43:539:177:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:ity probabilities starting at age 68.  Agents fully appreciate the uncertainty of their longevities
9:252:19226:22:22:43:539:155:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:and maximize, at any point in time, their expected remaining lifetime utilities.  The inclusion of
9:253:19324:22:29:43:446:133:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:lifespan uncertainty permits a realistic modelling of bequests and inheritances.
9:254:19404:29:0:72:540:104:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:We generate bequests by assuming that agents fail to annuitize their assets in old age. Hence,
10:255:19499:0:22:43:539:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:when they die, they leave undesired bequests to their children. Since agents die at different ages
10:256:19597:22:22:43:539:699:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:and have children of different ages, their heirs also inherit at different ages. Agents who were born
10:257:19698:22:21:43:539:677:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:when their parents were young receive inheritances later in their life than do their younger siblings.
10:258:19800:21:22:43:539:656:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Finally, uninsurable lifespan uncertainty leads agents to gradually reduce their consumption in
10:259:19895:22:29:43:83:634:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:old age.
10:260:19903:29:22:72:540:605:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Our model also includes capital adjustment costs.  As is well known, these costs can drive
10:261:19993:22:21:43:539:583:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:temporary wedges between the marginal products of capital in different regions and lead the
10:262:20084:21:22:43:539:562:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:market values of capital assets to temporarily differ from their replacement costs. Thus inclusion
10:263:20182:22:22:43:539:540:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:of adjustment costs in the model generates what amounts to regional stock markets and permits
10:264:20275:22:29:43:430:518:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:us to explore how population aging affects world stock prices through time.
10:265:20350:29:21:72:540:489:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:A final, but very important, feature of our framework is its intra-cohort disaggregation. As
10:266:20442:21:22:43:539:468:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:in Kotlikoff, Smetters and Walliser (2001), we consider three income classes within each generation
10:267:20541:22:22:43:539:446:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:each with its own earnings ability. Immigrants are also split into these income classes permitting
10:268:20639:22:29:43:516:424:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:us to simulate the arrival of immigrants with different stocks of human and physical capital.
10:269:20732:29:21:72:540:395:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The following sections present the general structure of our model. A more detailed descrip-
10:270:20823:21:34:43:379:374:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:tion of the three-country model is provided in Fehr, et al. (2003).
10:271:20890:34:29:43:143:340:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:1. Demographics
10:272:20905:29:21:72:540:311:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Each region is populated by households who live at most to age 90.  Consequently, there
10:273:20992:21:22:43:539:290:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:are 91 generations with surviving members at any point in time.  The individual life cycle of a
10:274:21087:22:22:43:539:268:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:representative agent is described in Figure 1. Between ages 0 and 20 our agents are children who
10:275:21183:22:21:43:539:246:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:earn no money and are supported by their parents. At age 21 our agents leave their parents and
10:276:21277:21:22:43:539:225:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:go to work. Between ages 23 and 45 our agents give birth to fractions of children at the beginning
10:277:21375:22:22:43:539:203:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:of each year, i.e.  the first (fraction of) children are born when the agents are 23 and the last
10:278:21472:22:21:43:539:181:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:are born when they are age 45.  An agent’s first-born children (fractions of children) leave home
10:279:21569:21:22:43:539:160:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:when the parents are age 43, while the last-born leave when the agents are age 66.  Our agents
10:280:21663:22:22:43:539:138:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:die between ages 68 and 90.  The probability of death is 1 at age 91.  Children always outlive
10:281:21757:22:21:43:539:116:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:their parents, meaning that parents always outlive grandparents. To see this note that if a parent
10:282:21855:21:0:43:539:95:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:reaches age 90, his or her oldest children will be 67. These are children who were born when the
11:283:21952:0:30:43:138:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:parent was age 23.
11:284:21970:30:21:72:540:691:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:In each year new immigrants in each skill and age group arrive with the same number and
11:285:22057:21:22:43:539:670:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:age distribution of children and the same level of assets as natives of the identical skill and age.
11:286:22157:22:22:43:539:648:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Since the demographic structure has the same general form in all four regions, it suffices to discuss
11:287:22258:22:29:43:286:626:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:a representative region and omit region indices.
11:288:22306:29:22:72:540:597:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:To specify the current and future demographic structure of each region we start with year-
11:289:22396:22:29:43:540:575:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:20001age-specific population [N(a,2000)] and age-specific net-immigration [NM(a,2000)] counts.
11:290:22490:29:21:72:540:546:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:In constructing existing as well as future age-population counts, we have to link each initial
11:291:22584:21:22:43:539:525:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:cohort between the ages of 1 and 68 to those of their parents who are still alive.  The reason is
11:292:22681:22:22:43:539:503:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:that children receive bequests from their parents, and the levels and timing of these inheritances
11:293:22779:22:22:43:539:481:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:depend on the ages of their parents.  This linkage is achieved by applying past fertility rates to
11:294:22877:22:21:43:539:459:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:each cohort under age 69 in year 2000. If, for example, 15 percent of the parents of newborns in
11:295:22973:21:22:43:539:438:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:1980 were 25 years old, then 15 percent of the 20-year-old’s in year 2000 are assigned to parents
11:296:23070:22:29:43:79:416:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:age 45.
11:297:23077:29:22:72:539:387:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:In addition, each cohort is split into three income classesk. Specifically, we assume that 35
11:298:23170:22:21:43:539:365:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:percent of each cohort belong to the lowest income class, 10 percent to the top income class, and
11:299:23267:21:22:43:539:344:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the remaining 55 percent to the middle income class. We denote the population vector for year t
11:300:23362:22:22:43:540:322:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:asN(a, t, s, k)wherea=1,...,s=23,...,45,k=1,2,3.  The termsreferences the age of the
11:301:23446:22:29:43:304:300:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:parent at the time of birth of agents ageain 2000.
11:302:23496:29:22:71:539:271:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:To determine the evolution of the population in each region over time, we applied region-,
11:303:23586:22:21:43:539:249:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:age-, and year-specific mortality and fertility rates to the cohorts alive in year 2000 as well as to
11:304:23687:21:22:43:539:228:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:their children as they reach their ages of fertility and mortality. In the baseline path the exogenous
11:305:23789:22:22:43:539:206:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:current and future mortality and fertility rates follow the medium variant of the United Nations
11:306:23885:22:29:43:504:184:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:population projection (UNPD, 2003 for the U.S., EU and Japan; UNPD, 2005 for China).
11:307:23969:29:22:71:539:155:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:According to this projection,  mortality rates will decline in all three regions over time.
11:308:24060:22:17:43:539:133:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Consider the Japanese, whose 2000 life expectancy equaled 81.6. According to official projections,
11:309:24158:17:21:57:539:116:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:1Although the economic model starts in year 2004, we chose year 2000 as the initial year for the population
11:310:24265:21:0:43:198:95:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:projections due to data availability.
12:311:24303:0:22:43:539:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Japan’s life expectancy in 2050 will reach 88.1. The Japanese, who now have a 4.5 year higher life
12:312:24401:22:22:43:539:699:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:expectancy than Americans and a 3.0 higher life expectancy than EU citizens, will continue to
12:313:24494:22:21:43:539:677:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:maintain their longevity lead through time.  Indeed, projected 2050 U.S. life expectancy doesn’t
12:314:24590:21:22:43:539:656:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:even exceed current Japanese life expectancy! In China life expectancy is now a full 10 years lower
12:315:24689:22:22:43:539:634:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:than life expectancy in Japan.  And this 10 year gap is projected to continue for the next half
12:316:24784:22:29:43:81:612:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:decade.
12:317:24791:29:22:72:540:583:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Table 1 shows our agent’s life expectancies at birth in the baseline path,  which is kept
12:318:24880:22:22:43:539:561:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:constant after year 2050.  The respective numbers are higher than the actual values, since our
12:319:24974:22:21:43:539:539:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:model’s agents don’t die prior to age 68.  However, the model’s life expectancies conditional on
12:320:25070:21:30:43:376:518:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:reaching age 60 are close to those reported by the UNPD (2005).
12:321:25133:30:22:72:540:488:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Total fertility rates currently equal 2.1, 1.3, 1.6 and 1.5 in the U.S., Japan, China, and the
12:322:25227:22:21:43:539:466:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:EU, respectively.  Nevertheless the United Nations expects fertility rates in all three regions to
12:323:25325:21:22:43:539:445:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:converge to 1.85 children by 2050.  This path of fertility rates is also shown in Table 1.  In the
12:324:25423:22:22:43:539:423:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:baseline path, we assume annual net immigration of 1 million per year in the U.S., 450,000 in the
12:325:25520:22:21:43:539:401:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:EU, and 54,000 in Japan. Net immigration into China is negative. The number of net emigrants
12:326:25612:21:22:43:539:380:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:is fixed at its current value of 390,000 people per year. Given the population age structure in year
12:327:25712:22:22:43:539:358:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:2000 as well as projected future fertility, mortality, and net immigration rates, we compute the
12:328:25808:22:21:43:539:336:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:population vectorN(a, t, s, k) for the yearstbetween 2001 and 2050.  After year 2050, fertility
12:329:25903:21:22:43:539:315:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:rates are endogenously adjusted in order to achieve zero population growth and a stable population
12:330:26001:22:22:43:539:293:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:age structure. Since net immigration is positive in the U.S., the EU, and Japan, the population-
12:331:26097:22:21:43:539:271:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:stabilizing post-2050 fertility rates are below 2.0. Equivalently, the fertility rates in China are set
12:332:26200:21:30:43:264:250:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:above 2.0 after 2050 due to net emigration.
12:333:26243:30:22:71:539:220:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Table 1 also shows projected changes over time in total populations and population age
12:334:26329:22:21:43:539:198:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:structures.  Due to high fertility and net immigration rates, the U.S. population is projected to
12:335:26426:21:22:43:539:177:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:increase from 275 million in 2000 to 442 million in 2100. In Europe, the population falls over the
12:336:26524:22:22:43:539:155:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:century from 375 to 340 million, and in Japan, the population falls from 126 million to 85 million.
12:337:26623:22:29:43:453:133:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The Chinese population decreases by even more – from 1.3 billion to 1.2 billion.
12:338:26703:29:0:71:539:104:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:As one would expect, the population share of those 65 and older increases in all four regions.
13:339:26799:0:22:43:539:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:There are, however, big differences in the aging process across the four regions. First, in the U.S.
13:340:26899:22:22:43:539:699:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:and China the absolute decrease of the shares of the young population through 2050 are almost
13:341:26992:22:21:43:539:677:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the same as for the working age population.  In contrast, the EU and Japan experience much
13:342:27082:21:22:43:539:656:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:larger absolute declines in the share of the population that is of working age. Second, the share of
13:343:27182:22:30:43:536:634:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:elderly increases to a much larger extent in Japan and China compared to the U.S. and the EU.
13:344:27275:30:21:72:540:604:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Table 1 indicates that our model’s demographic machinery does a remarkably good job
13:345:27358:21:22:43:539:583:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:matching official projections for the four regions both with respect to the absolute number and
13:346:27453:22:36:43:539:561:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:age compositions of their respective populations. We now describe this machinery in more detail.

13:357:27804:21:22:43:540:409:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:no children and those over 65 have only adult children, i.e.KID(a, t, k) = 0 for 0≤a≤22 and

13:359:27986:22:21:43:539:365:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Such an agent has children who were born in the years (a−j) since she/he was 23.  In yeart,

15:447:32025:21:22:43:539:396:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:when the children receive their inheritances.  While the oldest children (born when their parents

15:450:32310:29:21:72:540:323:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:As in Altig et al.   (2001) and Kotlikoff,  Smetters and Walliser (2001),  we assume that
15:451:32399:21:22:43:539:302:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:technical progress causes the time endowmenth(·) of each successive generation to grow at the
15:452:32492:22:22:43:96:280:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:rateλ, i.e.

15:454:32529:33:22:72:540:225:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The proposition here is not that time, per se, expands for successive generations, but rather
15:455:32622:22:22:43:539:203:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:that each successive generation is more effective in using time to either preform work or enjoy
15:456:32717:22:21:43:539:181:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:leisure. Treating technical change in this manner is essential to ensure that the economy achieves
15:457:32815:21:22:43:539:160:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:a long-run steady state.  The assumption of labor-augmenting technical change would not, for
15:458:32907:22:22:43:539:138:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:example, be compatible with a long-run steady state given the nature of the model’s preferences.
15:459:33003:22:21:43:539:116:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:And having the economy achieve a long-run steady state provides, in effect, the terminal conditions

16:475:34134:21:22:43:539:423:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:benefits received.  Due to our assumed ceiling on payroll tax contributions, pension, disability

18:555:37611:22:21:43:539:391:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:of debt to output.  The progressivity of the wage tax system is modelled as in Auerbach and
18:556:37702:21:30:43:479:370:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Kotlikoff (1987). Specifically, marginal wage tax rates rise linearly with the tax base.
18:557:37790:30:21:71:539:340:143:g_d0_f6:143:g_d0_f4:PY(t) defines the aggregate payroll tax base, which differs from total labor earnings due to
18:558:37882:21:22:43:539:319:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the ceiling on taxable wages.  This ceiling is fixed at 250, 200, 168, and 300 percent of average
18:559:37979:22:22:43:539:297:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:income in the U.S., EU, Japan, and China, respectively. Aggregate average social security payroll

18:563:38265:32:21:43:540:189:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:wherePB(t),HB(t)andDB(t) are total outlays of the pension, health care, and disability sys-
18:564:38356:21:22:43:539:168:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:tems, respectively.  For China we assume that disability insurance is part of the state pension
18:565:38451:22:30:43:539:146:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:system. Hence, we do not calculate separate disability insurance payroll tax rates for this country.
18:566:38551:30:21:71:539:116:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Due to contribution ceilings, individual pension, disability and health insurance payroll tax
18:567:38644:21:0:43:539:95:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:rates can differ from the payroll tax rate. Above the contribution ceiling, marginal social security
19:568:38746:0:22:43:539:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:contributions are zero and average social security contributions fall with the agent’s income.  To
19:569:38844:22:22:43:539:699:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:accommodate this non-convexity of the budget constraint, we assume that the highest earnings
19:570:38936:22:21:43:539:677:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:class in each region pays pension and, in the EU, Japan and China, health insurance payroll taxes,
19:571:39034:21:22:43:539:656:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:up to the relevant ceilings, but faces no pension and no health care payroll taxes at the margin.
19:572:39131:22:22:43:539:634:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The other earnings classes are assumed to face the full statutory tax rate on all earnings.  The
19:573:39227:22:21:43:539:612:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:disability payroll taxes in the U.S., the EU and Japan are modelled in an equivalent manner.
19:574:39319:21:22:43:539:591:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:However, since there is no ceiling on U.S. Medicare taxes, all earnings groups are assumed to face
19:575:39417:22:30:43:284:569:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the health insurance payroll tax at the margin.

19:581:39871:22:22:43:539:407:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:approximate replacement rates relative to individual lifetime earnings as reported in Whitehouse
19:582:39967:22:21:43:539:385:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:(2002). In China, we assumed a pension-replacement rate of 50 percent of average pre-retirement
19:583:40062:21:22:43:539:364:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:earnings. There is little reliable data to assess the accuracy of this replacement rate assumption.
19:584:40161:22:22:43:539:342:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:But the assumption seems reasonable given the Chinese government’s recent decision to recognize
19:585:40256:22:29:43:297:320:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the unfunded liabilities of state-owned enterprize.
19:586:40307:29:22:72:539:291:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:General government expendituresG(t) consist of government purchases of goods and services,
19:587:40397:22:22:43:539:269:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:including educational expenditures and health outlays.  Over the transition, general government
19:588:40492:22:21:43:539:247:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:purchases of goods and services are held fixed as a percent of national income.   Age-specific
19:589:40586:21:22:43:539:226:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:education and disability outlays are held fixed per capita over the transition with an adjustment for
19:590:40687:22:22:43:539:204:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:technological change. Age-specific health outlays are also held fixed per capita, but are assumed
19:591:40784:22:21:43:539:182:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:to grow at twice the rate of technological change during the first 25 years of the transition.
19:592:40878:21:22:43:539:161:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Afterwards, the age-specific levels of these outlays grow at the same rate as technological change.
19:593:40977:22:22:43:539:139:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Note that while the outlays of the health care systems are treated as government expenditures,
19:594:41071:22:21:43:539:117:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:disability benefits are modelled as direct transfers to the households.  The government’s budget
19:595:41167:21:0:43:539:96:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:(18) is balanced each year by adjusting the intercept in our linear equation determining the average

20:598:41303:29:22:72:540:657:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Up to now we’ve described the model for the representative economy.  The four regions of
20:599:41391:22:21:43:539:635:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the model are, however, connected through the world capital market. A condition of this market
20:600:41485:21:22:43:539:614:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:is that the value of aggregate world assets equals the market value of the world-wide capital stock
20:601:41584:22:19:43:331:592:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:plus the value of all outstanding government bonds; i.e.,

20:611:41717:47:29:43:167:515:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:6. Solving the Model
20:612:41737:29:22:72:540:486:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:To simulate the model we need, of course, to specify preference, technology, and policy pa-
20:613:41828:22:22:43:539:464:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:rameters. Table 2 reports these values, which, in the case of preference and technology parameters,
20:614:41927:22:29:43:364:442:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:are mostly taken from Kotlikoff, Smetters and Walliser (2001).
20:615:41989:29:21:72:540:413:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The multi-factor technology coefficient in the U.S. Cobb-Douglas function was set to generate
20:616:42082:21:22:43:539:392:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:a U.S. marginal product of labor of 1.0 in the initial year 2004. For the EU and Japan we simply
20:617:42178:22:22:43:539:370:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:adopted this technology level. For China the technology level was set to achieve a 2004 real wage
20:618:42275:22:21:43:539:348:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:equal to 15 percent of the U.S. level. During the transition we gradually adjust China’s technology
20:619:42374:21:30:43:347:327:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:level such that it reaches the developed world level in 2050.
20:620:42435:30:21:72:540:297:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The time-preference rates in the four regions were set to match the model’s 2004 ratios
20:621:42522:21:22:43:539:276:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:of private consumption to national income to the region-specific values reported in European
20:622:42614:22:22:43:539:254:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Commission (2005). The U.S., EU, and Japanese time-preferences rates are held fixed through tim.
20:623:42710:22:21:43:539:232:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:But in line with our baseline assumption that the Chinese public will eventually adopt American
20:624:42805:21:22:43:539:211:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:spending habits, we gradually raise the time preference rate of successive Chinese cohorts so that
20:625:42903:22:22:43:539:189:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the cohorts that reach adulthood (age 21) in 2030 and thereafter have the time-invariant U.S.
20:626:42996:22:29:43:149:167:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:time preference rate.
20:627:43017:29:22:72:540:138:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The model’s debt levels in the four regions were chosen to accord with real government
20:628:43103:22:21:43:539:116:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:interest payments reported in European Commission (2005) for the year 2004.  The maximum
20:629:43191:21:0:43:539:95:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:ages of retirement are taken from Bloendal and Scarpetta (1999) for the U.S. and the EU, from
21:630:43286:0:22:43:539:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Whitehouse (2002) for Japan and from OECD (2002) for China. We set the consumption tax rate,
21:631:43378:22:22:43:539:699:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:personal capital income tax rate, corporate income tax rate, and expensing rate for the U.S., the
21:632:43475:22:21:43:539:677:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:EU, and Japan in line with the structure of indirect and direct tax revenues reported in European
21:633:43572:21:22:43:539:656:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Commission (2005). We use OECD (2002) data to determine China’s consumption tax rate, but
21:634:43661:22:22:43:539:634:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:assume China has no personal capital income or corporate income taxes. It may well be that such
21:635:43756:22:29:43:504:612:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:taxes exist in China, but we have no reliable information to understand their magnitudes.
21:636:43845:29:22:72:540:583:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Our wage tax systems are assumed to be progressive,  with the parameters of these tax
21:637:43930:22:22:43:539:561:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:systems in each region set so as to generate what seem to be realistic average and marginal tax
21:638:44025:22:29:43:208:539:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:rates, which are reported below.
21:639:44057:29:22:72:540:510:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:In calibrating health expenditures in our model, we apply the Japanese age-specific govern-

21:641:44242:22:21:43:539:466:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the German profile. For the U.S., the Medicare program applies only to households 65 and older.
21:642:44337:21:22:43:539:445:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:We assume uniform Medicare expenditures by age.  We make the same uniform age-distribution
21:643:44427:22:22:43:539:423:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:assumption with respect to the disability insurance systems in the U.S., the EU, and Japan, which
21:644:44524:22:29:43:392:401:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:we assume applies only to those older than 20 and younger than 65.
21:645:44590:29:22:72:540:372:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:In the case of the U.S., EU, and Japan, total social insurance outlays for pensions, disability,
21:646:44686:22:22:43:539:350:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:and health, measured as a share of national income, are set to accord with the values of these
21:647:44780:22:21:43:539:328:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:totals reported in European Commission (2005).  But we determined the composition of these
21:648:44870:21:22:43:539:307:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:expenditures as between the three types of benefits using data reported in Docteur and Oxley

21:650:45049:22:21:43:539:263:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:EU and Japan that their ratios of disability expenditures to pension expenditures is the same as
21:651:45145:21:22:43:539:242:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:prevails in the U.S. Note that our baseline path assumes a gradual 20 percent cut in Japanese
21:652:45238:22:22:43:539:220:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:pension replacement rates through 2017, which was recently legislated by the Japanese govern-
21:653:45331:22:21:43:539:198:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:ment.  For China our division of social insurance outlays is restricted to pensions plus disability
21:654:45430:21:22:43:539:177:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:payments, on the one hand, and health expenditures, on the other.  Calibration here is based on
21:655:45525:22:30:43:117:155:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:OECD (2002).
21:656:45537:30:21:72:540:125:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:We use the German age-specific education profile for all regions in the model and rescale

22:658:45728:0:22:43:539:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:parameter values, our model requires an initial distribution of assets by age and income class for
22:659:45826:22:29:43:282:699:143:g_d0_f4:64:g_d0_f5:each region. These profiles are region-specific.2

22:661:45964:22:22:43:539:648:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:how these assets are distributed across regions.  The model’s level of total world assets was set
22:662:46061:22:21:43:539:626:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:to generate a capital-output ratio of 3.0 in our model in the absence of China.  Our additional
22:663:46156:21:22:43:539:605:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:assumption that per capita wealth in China equals 10 percent of per capital wealth in the developed
22:664:46255:22:30:43:515:583:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:countries sufficed to pin down the capital-output ratio in the four-region model, namely 2.3.
22:665:46348:30:21:72:540:553:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:In our simulations with adjustment costs, we also need to specify, for 2004, the base year,
22:666:46439:21:22:43:544:532:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:thesharesofwealthineachcountryownedbycitizensofeachregion. Thereasonisthatthe
22:667:46516:22:22:43:539:510:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:endogenous determination of capital prices in each region will differentially affect wealth holdings of
22:668:46619:22:21:43:539:488:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:each region’s nationals depending on where they hold their wealth. The data needed to determine
22:669:46714:21:22:43:539:467:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the region-specific allocation of each region’s wealth holdings are not available. Consequently, we
22:670:46813:22:22:43:539:445:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:make the following, admittedly crude, assumption. We assume that each U.S., EU, Japanese, and
22:671:46906:22:21:43:539:423:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Chinese nationals own 70 percent of the capital installed in their region and that the remaining
22:672:47002:21:22:43:539:402:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:30 percent is owned equally by foreigners from the other three regions.  In the case of the U.S.,
22:673:47099:22:22:43:539:380:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:for example, we assume that the Japanese, European Unioners, and Chinese each own 10 percent
22:674:47191:22:29:43:423:358:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:of the U.S. capital stock, where these holdings include government claims.
22:675:47265:29:22:72:540:329:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The initial (year 2004) world capital stock, the allocation of this capital stock across regions,
22:676:47362:22:21:43:539:307:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the regional ratios of government debt to national income, and the international, intergenerational,
22:677:47462:21:22:43:539:286:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:and intragenerational distributions of assets constitute the initial conditions needed to solve for
22:678:47561:22:22:43:539:264:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the perfect foresight general equilibrium transition path of the economy. The algorithm we use to
22:679:47658:22:29:43:287:242:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:solve the model employs Gauss-Seidel iteration.
22:680:47705:29:22:72:540:213:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Specifically, our algorithm starts with initial guesses for capital stocks and labor supplies
22:681:47798:22:21:43:539:191:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:in each region for the post-2004 years of the transition.  Next we compute from equation (16)
22:682:47891:21:18:43:539:170:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the path of the q’s – the region-specific market prices of capital. The path for the world interest
22:683:47990:18:21:57:539:152:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:2The profile of Japanese average net wealth by age was provided by Charles Horioka, while the European age-
22:684:48097:21:18:43:539:131:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:specific average wealth profiles was adjusted from German data provided by Reinhold Schnabel.  We calculated a
22:685:48207:18:18:43:539:113:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:U.S. age-wealth profile using the 1998 Survey of Consumer Finances. For China, we adopted the Japanese age-net
22:686:48317:18:0:43:105:95:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:wealth profile.
23:687:48334:0:22:43:539:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:rate is derived from the arbitrage condition (17) for the U.S. Next, region-specific wage rates are
23:688:48433:22:30:43:519:699:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:computed for each year by setting them equal to their respective marginal products of labor.
23:689:48525:30:21:72:540:669:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The initial region-specific capital values, our working value of q in 2004, and 2004 initial
23:690:48617:21:22:43:539:648:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:region-specific debt levels suffices to determine total worldwide wealth in 2004 using the world
23:691:48713:22:22:43:539:626:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:capital market equilibrium condition (21).  These aggregate values are then distributed to the
23:692:48807:22:21:43:539:604:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:agents of each region based on the initial 2004 region-specific wealth shares and region-specific
23:693:48904:21:30:43:132:583:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:age-asset profiles.
23:694:48923:30:22:72:540:553:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Given these initial individual asset holdings, our initial guesses of tax rates/tax function
23:695:49015:22:21:43:539:531:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:parameters, as well as the derived time paths of wage and interest rates, we calculate household
23:696:49111:21:22:43:539:510:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:consumption, saving, and labor supply decisions.  The first-order conditions and lifetime budget
23:697:49207:22:22:43:539:488:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:constraints determining these decisions are fairly complex and certainly do not omit of closed form
23:698:49306:22:21:43:539:466:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:solutions. Part of this complexity arises because of the progressive nature of our assumed wage tax
23:699:49405:21:22:43:539:445:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:structures, which means that marginal tax rates are themselves endogenous and need to be deter-
23:700:49500:22:22:43:539:423:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:mined jointly with life-cycle consumption, saving, and labor supply decisions. This is done using
23:701:49597:22:21:43:539:401:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Gauss-Seidel iteration.  We refer to this as “inter-loop” convergence.  As indicated momentarily,
23:702:49694:21:22:43:539:380:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:we also use Gauss-Seidel iteration to determine the time path of the economy’s macroeconomic
23:703:49786:22:30:43:474:358:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:variables. We refer to this iteration on macro variables as “outer-loop” convergence.
23:704:49871:30:21:72:540:328:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The next step in our overall solution algorithm uses the annual revenues and Social Security
23:705:49963:21:22:43:539:307:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:benefit payments implied by these household decisions to update annual tax rates/tax parameters.
23:706:50059:22:22:43:539:285:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:We also update the model’s region-specific time paths of government debt.  These updates are
23:707:50151:22:29:43:216:263:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:based on equations (18) and (19).
23:708:50184:29:22:72:540:234:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Aggregating individual labor supplies in each year provides new time paths of aggregate
23:709:50271:22:22:43:539:212:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:region-specific labor supplies.  Determining new time paths of capital stocks in each region is a
23:710:50368:22:21:43:539:190:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:bit more involved. First, we use year-2004 wealth holdings plus agent-specific saving decisions to
23:711:50466:21:22:43:539:169:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:determine agent-specific asset holdings in each year during the transition.  Second, we aggregate
23:712:50563:22:22:43:539:147:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:agent-specific assets at each date to determine a time-path of aggregate world-wide asset holdings.
23:713:50662:22:21:43:539:125:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Third, use (17) to substitute out for ∆K(t)/K– the percentage change in capital – in (16). Finally,
23:714:50761:21:0:43:539:104:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:we equate the interest rates in Japan, the EU, and China to that in the U.S. using the modified
24:715:50858:0:22:43:539:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:versions of (16).  Given our working values of theq’s, this provides us with three equations in a
24:716:50955:22:22:43:539:699:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:given year to solve for the four region-specific capital stocks.  The fourth equation comes from
24:717:51051:22:21:43:540:677:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the worldwide capital market condition, which, given our working values ofq’s and debt, provides
24:718:51147:21:30:43:391:656:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:another equation in the four unknown region-specific capital stocks.
24:719:51215:30:22:72:540:626:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The new values for the aggregate supplies of capital and labor in each region in each year
24:720:51305:22:21:43:539:604:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:are then weighted with the initial guesses of these variables to form new guesses of their time
24:721:51400:21:22:43:539:583:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:paths. The algorithm then iterates until the region-specific time paths of capital stocks and labor
24:722:51499:22:30:43:217:561:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:supplies converge to a fixed point.
24:723:51534:30:21:72:540:531:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:We give our economy 300 years to reach to a steady state. In fact, our model reaches a steady
24:724:51627:21:22:43:539:510:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:state to many decimal places decades prior to year 300.  It also converges very tightly around
24:725:51721:22:22:43:539:488:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the equilibrium transition path.  However, when we include capital adjustment costs finding the
24:726:51816:22:21:43:539:466:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:equilibrium transition path is very time consuming even on today’s most powerful desktop PCs.
24:727:51909:21:22:43:539:445:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Doing so requires finding the path with no such costs, which can be done relatively quickly, and
24:728:52005:22:22:43:539:423:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:then using the region-specific capital and labor supply equilibrium paths from that simulation
24:729:52099:22:21:43:539:401:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:as the initial guesses for a run with very small adjustment costs.  We then use the results of
24:730:52193:21:22:43:539:380:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the small adjustment costs simulation as initial guesses for a simulation with somewhat higher
24:731:52287:22:22:43:539:358:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:adjustment costs and proceed in this manner until we’ve solved the model with our desired level
24:732:52382:22:21:43:539:336:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:of adjustment costs.  Given the time required for these calculations, we assumed no adjustment
24:733:52476:21:22:43:539:315:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:costs in all but one simulation presented below.  The simulation with adjustment costs is of the
24:734:52572:22:22:43:539:293:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:base case transition. The results indicate that inclusion of reasonable adjustment costs make little
24:735:52672:22:35:43:166:271:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:difference to the results.
24:736:52698:35:30:43:484:236:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:III. Initial Equilibrium and the World Economy’s Baseline Transition Path
24:737:52771:30:22:72:540:206:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Table 3 reports key macroeconomic variables in 2004 in the four regions.  Note that there
24:738:52860:22:21:43:539:184:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:is a fairly close accordance between actual and computed values of private consumption and gov-
24:739:52955:21:22:43:539:163:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:ernment purchases measured as a share of national income. The one exception is EU government
24:740:53047:22:22:43:539:141:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:purchases.  The official data seem too low given the reported ratio of tax revenues to national
24:741:53142:22:21:43:539:119:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:income.  In our calibration, we chose to benchmark government purchases based on the ratio of
24:742:53235:21:0:43:210:98:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:tax revenues to national income.
25:743:53269:0:22:72:540:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The reported ratios of educational expenditure to national income are very close to actual
25:744:53359:22:22:43:539:699:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:levels3.  In the case of pension, health, and disability, expenditures, we closely match the shares
25:745:53458:22:21:43:539:677:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:of national income received in the form of social contributions in the U.S., the EU and Japan as
25:746:53554:21:22:43:539:656:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:reported in European Commission (2005).  In China, the level of health expenditures measured
25:747:53646:22:22:43:539:634:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:as a share of national income was set in accord with WHO (2004, 136).  The resulting social
25:748:53737:22:21:43:539:612:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:security payroll tax rates come close to observed levels.  Concerning the overall structure of tax
25:749:53835:21:22:43:539:591:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:revenues, the assumed tax rates on capital income, corporate income, and consumption as well as
25:750:53930:22:30:43:362:569:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the expensing fractions (see Table 2) yield a realistic pattern4.
25:751:53995:30:21:72:540:539:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The baseline simulation ignores adjustment costs. Hence, capital prices do not change during
25:752:54087:21:22:43:539:518:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the transition.  However, due to the differences in the expensing fractions for the corporate tax,
25:753:54185:22:22:43:539:496:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:capital prices deviate from one in the EU and Japan.  Thus the capital price is 0.964 in the EU
25:754:54280:22:21:43:539:474:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:and 0.936 in Japan throughout the transition, while it is 1.000 in the U.S. and China.  Finally,
25:755:54376:21:22:43:539:453:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the model’s year-2004 capital-output ratios seem reasonable not only relative to U.S. Commerce
25:756:54470:22:22:43:539:431:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Department figures, but also in terms of the year-2004 marginal product of capital, which equals
25:757:54566:22:29:43:103:409:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:9.8 percent.
25:758:54578:29:22:72:540:380:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Next we turn to the simulation results for the baseline transition.  The transition paths for
25:759:54671:22:22:43:539:358:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the four regions are reported in the upper panels of Tables 4 to 7 for the U.S., the EU, Japan, and
25:760:54770:22:21:43:539:336:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:China. Note that region-specific ratios of national income, the capital stock, the supply of labor,
25:761:54869:21:30:43:470:315:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:and the pre-tax wage rate are all expressed relative to the U.S. values in year 2004.
25:762:54954:30:22:72:540:285:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Although the four economies are aging, the baseline path shows a steady increase in effective
25:763:55047:22:21:43:539:263:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:labor supply in the U.S., the EU and Japan. This may seem surprising especially for Japan and
25:764:55140:21:22:43:539:242:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the EU where the population and work force decline over time (see Table 1).  The explanation
25:765:55232:22:22:43:539:220:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:lies in our assumption that each successive cohort has a higher effective time endowment, which
25:766:55327:22:21:43:539:198:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:admits greater effective labor supply by each successive cohort. Thus, the future decrease in the
25:767:55424:21:22:43:539:177:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:actual labor force is offset in the EU, Japan, and China and the growth in the actual number of
25:768:55519:22:22:43:539:155:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:workers in the U.S. is augmented. However, effective labor supply grows at much different rates in
25:769:55617:22:18:43:539:133:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the regions. In Japan it increases over the century by 41 percent. In the EU it more than doubles
25:770:55714:18:13:57:231:115:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:3See OECD (2003a, 178; 2003b, 71, 77).
25:771:55752:13:0:57:429:102:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:4Actual values are calculated from European Commission (2005) and OECD (2003c).
26:772:55833:0:30:43:526:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:over the same period. And in the U.S. it increases over the century by a factor of almost four.
26:773:55928:30:22:72:540:691:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The evolution of effective labor supply in China is particularly interesting. During the next
26:774:56021:22:21:43:539:669:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:two decades effective labor supply increases, then it declines until mid century when it begins to
26:775:56119:21:22:43:539:648:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:increase again.  This complex pattern reflects major changes in substitution and income effects
26:776:56214:22:22:43:539:626:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:over the transition, the demographic changes themselves, as well as the ongoing technological
26:777:56307:22:21:43:539:604:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:change.  By the end of the century, China’s effective labor supply is larger, but only 18 percent
26:778:56404:21:30:43:161:583:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:larger, than it is today.
26:779:56429:30:22:72:540:553:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Due to the dramatic aging of populations,social security tax rates increase through 2050
26:780:56517:22:21:43:539:531:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:by 5.5 percentage points in the U.S., by 12.8 percentage points in the EU, by 13.8 percentage
26:781:56610:21:22:43:539:510:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:points in Japan, and by 7.8 percentage points in China. Over the century the respective increases
26:782:56707:22:22:43:539:488:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:are 11.4 percentage points in the U.S. and the EU, 10.7 percentage points in Japan and 16.6
26:783:56798:22:21:43:539:466:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:percentage points in China.  These changes constitute very major percentage payroll tax hikes
26:784:56891:21:22:43:539:445:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:given the base-year values. In the U.S. and China, for example, the model is predicting more than
26:785:56988:22:30:43:239:423:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:a 100 percent rise in payroll tax rates.
26:786:57028:30:21:72:540:393:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Despite the rising payroll tax burden, capital stocks rise dramatically in all regions over the
26:787:57123:21:22:43:539:372:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:course of the century. The capital stock increases by a factor of 4.7 in the U.S., by a factor of 2.5
26:788:57224:22:22:43:539:350:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:in the EU, by a factor of 1.7 in Japan and by a factor of 9.6 in China. In China this development is
26:789:57324:22:21:43:539:328:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:due to high investment rates associated with high private saving and the assumed rapid catch-up
26:790:57419:21:22:43:539:307:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:in the country’s level of technology.  The other regions also benefit from the economic boom in
26:791:57514:22:22:43:539:285:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:China.  As the development of the current accounts suggests, initially capital mainly flows from
26:792:57610:22:21:43:539:263:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the three developed regions to China.  However, in subsequent decades the asset holdings of the
26:793:57705:21:22:43:539:242:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:U.S., the EU, and Japan in China decline and capital starts to flow from China to all three of
26:794:57799:22:22:43:539:220:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:these regions. After 2050, this is reversed again so that capital flows from the U.S., EU, and Japan
26:795:57899:22:21:43:539:198:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:back to China.  This reversal is expected; it reflects the repatriation of Chinese foreign capital
26:796:57997:21:30:43:165:177:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:earnings back to China.
26:797:58020:30:22:72:540:147:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The differences across the four regions in the growth of effective labor supply and capital stock
26:798:58117:22:21:43:539:125:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:and, in the case of China, in the evolution of the multifactor productivity coefficient materially
26:799:58215:21:0:43:539:104:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:affects overall economic growth.  In the U.S. output grows by a factor of 4.1 over the next 100
27:800:58312:0:22:43:539:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:years. It grows by a factor of 2.2 in the EU, 1.4 in Japan and 8.5 in China. The larger increase in
27:801:58411:22:22:43:539:699:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:capital compared to labor supply leads to an increase in the pre-tax wage rate in the developed
27:802:58506:22:21:43:539:677:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:economies of almost 16 percent through the middle of the century.  In China wages rise by more
27:803:58600:21:22:43:539:656:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:than 700 percent thanks, primarily, to the gradual increase in China’s technology level.  After
27:804:58695:22:22:43:539:634:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:2050, however, growth in labor supply exceeds growth in capital stocks in all regions so that the
27:805:58792:22:21:43:539:612:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:wage rate starts to decline. At the end of the century real wages per unit of human capital in the
27:806:58890:21:29:43:424:591:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:developed economies are still above 2004 levels, but only 4 percent higher.
27:807:58965:29:22:72:540:562:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:As one would expect, the world-wide capital deepening in the first half of the century and
27:808:59055:22:22:43:539:540:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:capital-shallowing in the second half has a major impact on the world interest rate. Between 2004
27:809:59152:22:21:43:539:518:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:and 2030 the world interest rate declines by 370 basis points – from .098 to .061. This is followed
27:810:59251:21:22:43:539:497:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:by an increase to a 2100 level of .087 percent. Wage tax rates follow a similar pattern – declining
27:811:59350:22:29:43:349:475:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:in the first half of the century and rising in the second half.
27:812:59413:29:22:72:540:446:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:This interesting pattern in the evolution of factor prices reflects China’s ongoing rapid growth
27:813:59509:22:21:43:539:424:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:and its assumed gradual change in saving behavior.  During the first half of the century, China
27:814:59604:21:22:43:539:403:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:makes a major contribution to world-wide capital formation.  In the second half of the century,
27:815:59699:22:22:43:539:381:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:more and more of its cohorts have adopted U.S. preferences with respect to spending and the
27:816:59790:22:29:43:288:359:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Chinese saving engine starts to sputter and fail.
27:817:59839:29:21:72:540:330:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:To understand better the role of China in worldwide capital formation, let’s consider what
27:818:59929:21:22:43:539:309:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:would happen were the developed world forced to evolve without the ability to import capital
27:819:60021:22:33:43:104:287:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:from China.
27:820:60032:33:29:43:450:254:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:IV. The World Economy’s Baseline Transition Path Excluding China
27:821:60096:29:22:72:540:225:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Table 8 reports baseline transition paths for the developed economies if we calibrate the
27:822:60185:22:22:43:539:203:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:model as above, but simply exclude China.  Doing so has dramatic effects.  Capital stocks in all
27:823:60281:22:21:43:539:181:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:three regions in the initial years of the transition are much higher compared to the four-country
27:824:60378:21:22:43:539:160:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:case since more capital now remains in the developed world.  For example, in 2010 the capital
27:825:60471:22:22:43:539:138:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:stock index in the U.S. is 1.60 compared with 1.02 in the 4-country simulation (see Table 4).  In
27:826:60568:22:21:43:539:116:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:both simulations, the capital stock is measured relative to the U.S. value in 2004 in the 4-country
27:827:60667:21:0:43:99:95:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:simulation.
28:828:60680:0:22:72:540:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Interestingly, even though the developed world has more capital to work with initially, real
28:829:60772:22:22:43:539:699:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:wages are actually lower in 2010 than in the transition with China. The reason is that labor supply
28:830:60871:22:21:43:539:677:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:is initially also much higher in the developed world in the no-China simulation. Presumably this
28:831:60967:21:22:43:539:656:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:reflects the income effect of having lower real wages in the medium term when China is no longer
28:832:61063:22:29:43:293:634:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:serving as the developed world’s saving machine.
28:833:61111:29:22:72:540:605:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:With China out of the picture,  the developed regions’ capital stocks increase much less
28:834:61199:22:21:43:539:583:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:rapidly over time. This puts a significant damper on output growth. During the first half of the
28:835:61295:21:22:43:539:562:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:century, capital growth is somewhat larger than labor supply growth.  Thus wage rates increase
28:836:61389:22:22:43:539:540:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:by approximately 2 percent and the world interest rate decreases by about 30 basis points.  In
28:837:61483:22:21:43:539:518:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the second half of the century, however, all three regions experience a capital shortage due to the
28:838:61582:21:22:43:539:497:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:high tax burden. As a consequence, wage rates decline. Indeed, the 2100 wage per unit of human
28:839:61676:22:22:43:539:475:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:capital is 4 percent below its 2004 level, and the interest rate is 100 basis points above its base
28:840:61775:22:21:43:539:453:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:year value. The lower level of real wages in the no-China transition leads to higher average wage
28:841:61872:21:29:43:369:432:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:and payroll tax rates, both of which limit capital accumulation.
28:842:61936:29:22:72:540:403:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The current accounts show that capital flows primarily to the U.S. during the coming decades
28:843:62028:22:22:43:539:381:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:due to its younger population and higher population growth rate. After 2050, capital flows to the
28:844:62125:22:29:43:539:359:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:EU and increasingly to Japan as the Europeans and Japanese repatriate their U.S.-earned income.
28:845:62220:29:21:72:540:330:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:As indicated in the introduction, the no-China developed world transition path shows a
28:846:62306:21:22:43:539:309:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:relatively modest capital shortage compared to our previous findings reported in Fehr, Jokisch
28:847:62400:22:22:43:539:287:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:and Kotlikoff (2004a,b; 2005). The main reason, again, is that we are now calibrating the model
28:848:62495:22:21:43:539:265:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:to include government investment.  In addition, we’ve switched to using European Commission
28:849:62586:21:22:43:539:244:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:(2005) data for our measures of social contributions received.   This lowers,  somewhat,  initial
28:850:62683:22:33:43:332:222:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:payroll tax rates as well as subsequent payroll tax hikes.
28:851:62741:33:29:43:168:189:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:V. Adjustment Costs
28:852:62760:29:22:72:540:160:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Table 9 repeats the base-case simulation, but includes capital adjustment costs. A compar-
28:853:62850:22:22:43:539:138:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:ison of this table with the first panels in Tables 4 through 7 shows that adjustment costs make
28:854:62945:22:21:43:539:116:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:very little difference to the four-region dynamic equilibrium. The initial levels and times paths of
28:855:63045:21:0:43:539:95:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:regional stock prices per unit of physical capital (the ratio of market value to replacement cost)
29:856:63145:0:30:43:171:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:are, however, interesting.
29:857:63171:30:22:72:540:691:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:In 2004, EU stock prices are 5.1 percent lower than US stock prices.  Japanese stock prices
29:858:63262:22:21:43:539:669:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:are 12.6 percent lower, and Chinese stock prices are 16.1 percent higher.  The model predicts
29:859:63355:21:22:43:539:648:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:increases in stock values in all four regions for the next 10 to 20 years, depending on the region,
29:860:63454:22:22:43:539:626:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:followed by a long term decline in stock values. The U.S. stock market value is 1.000 in 2004, hits
29:861:63553:22:21:43:539:604:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:1.062 in 2020, and falls to .917 in 2100.  The EU’s 2004 stock market value is .949.  It’s .979 in
29:862:63651:21:22:43:539:583:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:2020 and then gradually falls to .882 in 2100.  Japan’s 2004 stock market value is .874.  In 2020
29:863:63748:22:22:43:539:561:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:it’s .938, but then falls to .851 by Century’s end. And China’s stock market value starts at 1.161,
29:864:63847:22:35:43:301:539:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:reaches 1.196 in 2020 and declines to .914 in 2100.

29:866:63955:30:22:72:540:474:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:This section returns to the four region model without adjustment costs and examines the
29:867:64042:22:21:43:539:452:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:importance of our assumptions about the evolution of Chinese saving behavior and the rate at
29:868:64134:21:22:43:539:431:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:which China absorbs developed-world technology. Specifically, we first consider keeping the time
29:869:64230:22:22:43:539:409:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:preference rate of successive Chinese cohorts at same the level calibrated for all Chinese cohorts
29:870:64328:22:21:43:539:387:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:for 2004 in the base case transition.  Next we assume the technology coefficient in the Chinese
29:871:64423:21:22:43:539:366:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Cobb-Douglas production function rises only to half, rather than 100 percent, of the U.S. level by
29:872:64521:22:36:43:260:344:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:2050 and remains at that value thereafter.
29:873:64563:36:29:43:302:308:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:1. Constant Time Preference Rate in China
29:874:64604:29:22:72:540:279:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The second simulation reported in Tables 4 through 7 from permanently maintains the
29:875:64687:22:22:43:539:257:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Chinese time preference rate at its year-2004 level.   Doing so has dramatic consequences.   In
29:876:64782:22:21:43:539:235:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:particular, the 2100 world stock of capital is 5.9 times higher than in the base case!  China not
29:877:64879:21:22:43:539:214:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:only becomes the world’s saver. It also becomes the world’s investor, sending huge flows of capital
29:878:64978:22:22:43:539:192:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:to the developed world over the course of the Century.  By 2100, the capital stocks in the U.S.,
29:879:65074:22:29:43:443:170:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the EU, and Japan are 5.6, 5.6, and 5.8 times their initial values, respectively.
29:880:65155:29:22:72:540:141:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:This huge impetus to capital formation has a major impact on economic growth in all four
29:881:65243:22:22:43:539:119:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:regions, leaving world output roughly 50 percent higher in 2100 than it would otherwise have
29:882:65335:22:0:43:539:97:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:been. This is true notwithstanding a basically unchanged supply of labor in the four regions. The
30:883:65434:0:22:43:539:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:rough constancy of labor supply reflects competing income and substitution effects arising from
30:884:65529:22:22:43:539:699:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:roughly 55 percent higher long-run (year 2100) levels of the real wage per unit of human capital.
30:885:65626:22:21:43:539:677:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The long-run capital glut also leads to a very major decline in the world real interest rates – from
30:886:65726:21:30:43:260:656:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:9.8 percent in 2004 to 2.3 percent in 2100.
30:887:65769:30:22:72:540:626:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The long-run rise in real wages has a major effect on long-run payroll tax rates, although
30:888:65859:22:21:43:539:604:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:it does very little to payroll tax rates over the next three decades.  Year-2100 payroll tax rates
30:889:65957:21:22:43:539:583:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:are now 16.4 percent instead of 23.0 percent in the U.S., 26.1 percent instead of 36.7 percent in
30:890:66054:22:22:43:539:561:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the EU, 22.7 percent instead of 32.8 percent in Japan, and 26.0 percent instead of 27.7 percent
30:891:66149:22:21:43:539:539:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:in China. Higher output growth immediately translates into increased government expenditures.
30:892:66242:21:36:43:397:518:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:This explains the higher wage tax rates in the medium and long run.
30:893:66309:36:30:43:273:482:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:2. Slower Technology Growth in China
30:894:66345:30:21:72:540:452:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Our next simulation, reported in the third panels of tables 4 through 7, assumes that the
30:895:66434:21:22:43:539:431:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:multi-factor technology coefficient in the Chinese production function rises by 2050 to only 50,
30:896:66530:22:22:43:539:409:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:rather than 100 percent of the U.S. level and remains fixed at half the U.S. level thereafter.  As
30:897:66628:22:21:43:539:387:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:a comparison with the base case shows, slower Chinese technological growth means much lower
30:898:66719:21:22:43:539:366:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:capital demand, output, and real wage levels in China. Indeed, in 2100 the Chinese capital stock
30:899:66815:22:22:43:539:344:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:and output levels are just over half of their base-case values.  And the Chinese real wage is only
30:900:66913:22:29:43:295:322:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:39 percent of what it would otherwise have been.
30:901:66961:29:22:72:540:293:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:In contrast to what happens to China’s capital stock, China’s labor supply is significantly
30:902:67052:22:22:43:539:271:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:higher along the entire transition path. This reflects the income effects (relative to the base case)
30:903:67153:22:21:43:539:249:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:experienced by the Chinese in receiving lower real wages as well as smaller inheritances.  These
30:904:67249:21:22:43:539:228:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:income effects matter to labor supply from the get go.  Indeed, the immediate increase in labor
30:905:67344:22:22:43:539:206:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:supply explains why Chinese output and capital stock levels are initially higher than they are in
30:906:67441:22:29:43:113:184:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the base case.
30:907:67455:29:22:72:540:155:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The rise in China’s labor supply doesn’t suffice to offset the lower path of wages with respect
30:908:67550:22:22:43:539:133:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:to determining the Chinese payroll tax base.  Consequently, social security payroll tax rates are
30:909:67647:22:0:43:242:111:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:markedly higher during this transition.
31:910:67688:0:22:72:540:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The most interesting thing about this simulation of slower Chinese technological progress is
31:911:67780:22:22:43:539:699:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:what happens to the economies of the developed world.  The answer, surprisingly, is very little.
31:912:67876:22:21:43:539:677:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Although China saves much less than in the base case, it also demands significantly less capital.
31:913:67973:21:22:43:539:656:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Consequently, the U.S., the EU, and Japan end up with essentially the same capital stocks, wage
31:914:68068:22:30:43:365:634:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:rates, and tax rates over time that they enjoy in the base case.
31:915:68132:30:21:72:540:604:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The welfare effects of this simulation are given in Table 9. The numbers show the change in
31:916:68223:21:22:43:539:583:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:welfare measured as an equivalent variation and expressed as a percentage of remaining lifetime
31:917:68318:22:22:43:539:561:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:resources for cohorts born between 1920 and 2030.  As expected from the macroeconomic devel-
31:918:68410:22:21:43:539:539:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:opment, middle-aged and future cohorts in China experience large welfare losses due to reduced
31:919:68504:21:22:43:539:518:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:wages and increased payroll tax rates during their lifetimes.  The welfare changes for developed
31:920:68600:22:36:43:261:496:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:world cohorts are, in contrast, quite small.
31:921:68644:36:29:43:184:460:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:VII. Population Policies
31:922:68668:29:22:72:540:431:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:In this section we analyze three different population scenarios.   The first scenario keeps
31:923:68759:22:22:43:539:409:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:fertility rates fixed at their initial levels. The second scenario considers increases in life expectancy
31:924:68864:22:35:43:521:387:143:g_d0_f4:64:g_d0_f5:relative to the base case. The third scenario doubles rates of immigration in all four regions.5
31:925:68960:35:30:43:270:352:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:1. Fixed Fertility Rates in All Regions
31:926:68999:30:22:72:540:322:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The fourth panels in Tables 4 through 7 show the impacts of keeping the initial fertility rate
31:927:69093:22:21:43:539:300:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:of 2.11 births per woman in the U.S., 1.46 births in the EU, 1.28 births in Japan and 1.62 births
31:928:69190:21:30:43:194:279:143:g_d0_f4:64:g_d0_f5:in China fixed through 2050.6
31:929:69219:30:22:72:540:249:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The higher short-term U.S. fertility rate increases that country’s total population as well
31:930:69310:22:21:43:539:227:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:as its effective labor supply.  The latter variable is first affected in 2026 when the first cohort
31:931:69409:21:22:43:539:206:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:generated by the higher birth rate enters the labor force.  Effective labor supply and national
31:932:69504:22:22:43:539:184:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:income in 2100 are raised by 17 percent relative to the baseline simulation.  Due to the younger
31:933:69600:22:17:43:539:162:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:population age-structure and the increased labor supply, social security contribution rates in the
31:934:69698:17:22:57:539:145:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:5A more extensive analysis of how different population policies affect the future fiscal and economic development
31:935:69811:22:10:43:380:123:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:in the developed world is presented in Fehr, Jokisch and Kotlikoff (2004a, b).
31:936:69889:10:0:57:529:113:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:6After 2050 fertility rates gradually adjust again in order to achieve a zero long-run population growth rate.
32:937:70001:0:22:43:539:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:U.S. decrease.  In 2100 the social security payroll tax is 20.9 percent, compared to 23 percent in
32:938:70099:22:22:43:539:699:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the base case. However, the average wage tax rate rises. Compared with the base case results, the
32:939:70196:22:21:43:539:677:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:average wage tax rate is 1.1 percentage points higher in 2100.  This reflects the need to finance
32:940:70293:21:22:43:539:656:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:additional government expenditures associated with the population increase.  The capital stock
32:941:70387:22:22:43:539:634:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:keeps pretty close track with the higher time path of labor supply. In 2100 the capital stock is 16
32:942:70486:22:29:43:247:612:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:percent higher relative to the base case.
32:943:70527:29:22:72:540:583:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:In the case of the EU, Japan, and China, holding fertility rates fixed at their 2004 values
32:944:70618:22:22:43:539:561:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:for the next 45 years leads to smaller work forces and populations.  In the EU labor supply and
32:945:70713:22:21:43:539:539:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:national income in 2100 are 23 percent below their baseline values.  These are big differences.
32:946:70808:21:22:43:539:518:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:In China, effective labor supply and national income in 2100 are both 17 percent lower.  And in
32:947:70903:22:22:43:539:496:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Japan, the maintenance of current fertility patterns through 2050 reduces effective labor supply
32:948:70999:22:21:43:539:474:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:at the end of the century by 33 percent and national income by 32 percent. Indeed, the absolute
32:949:71094:21:22:43:539:453:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:size of the Japanese economy, as measured by national income, is smaller in 2100 than in 2004
32:950:71187:22:30:43:347:431:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:notwithstanding almost 100 years of technological progress!
32:951:71246:30:21:72:540:401:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Lower fertility rates raise dependency ratios in the three developed regions. This necessitates
32:952:71341:21:22:43:539:380:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:larger increases in social security tax rates.   On the other hand,  average wage tax rates are
32:953:71436:22:22:43:539:358:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:slightly reduced during the transition since government expenditures on education decrease with
32:954:71531:22:21:43:539:336:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the reduction in the number of young people and general government expenditures decrease with
32:955:71624:21:22:43:539:315:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the reduction in population growth.  The higher payroll taxes in China, Japan, and the EU lead
32:956:71718:22:22:43:539:293:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:households to save less and export more capital to the U.S. Thus, capital stocks in the three
32:957:71811:22:21:43:539:271:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:regions decline during the second half of the century.  Finally, since capital-labor ratios are little
32:958:71913:21:22:43:539:250:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:affected in the four regions, wage rates and the world interest rate remain almost the same as in
32:959:72010:22:36:43:134:228:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the baseline path.
32:960:72028:36:29:43:295:192:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:2. Higher Life Expectancies in All Regions
32:961:72070:29:22:72:540:163:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Now we consider a simultaneous rise in longevity in all regions. To be precise, we gradually
32:962:72162:22:22:43:539:141:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:raise life expectancy in each region through 2050 by approximately 3 years, i.e. life expectancy in
32:963:72261:22:21:43:539:119:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:2050 is 86.8 years in the U.S., 87.6 years in the EU, 91 years in Japan, and 83.3 years in China.
32:964:72358:21:0:43:539:98:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:These values for the developed regions find support in the projections of Tuljapurkar, et.  al.
33:965:72455:0:30:43:539:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:(2000). Simulation results for this scenario are reported in the fifth panels of Tables 4 through 7.
33:966:72555:30:22:72:540:691:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Greater longevity leads to more saving for retirement as well as more labor supply to help
33:967:72645:22:21:43:539:669:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:generate this saving.  Consequently, the labor supply and the capital stock increase in all four
33:968:72741:21:22:43:539:648:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:regions compared to the base case. The broadening of the tax base implies a slight decline in wage
33:969:72839:22:22:43:539:626:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:tax rates in the medium and long run. However, at the same time, higher life expectancy leads to
33:970:72935:22:21:43:539:604:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:a rise in dependency ratios. Hence, the year-2100 social security contribution rates are increased
33:971:73033:21:22:43:539:583:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:by 2.4 percentage points in the U.S., 2.3 percentage points in the EU, 2.2 percentage points in
33:972:73128:22:22:43:539:561:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Japan and 4.1 percentage points in China.  Since the increase in capital exceeds the increase in
33:973:73224:22:21:43:539:539:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:labor, wage rates rise slightly during the transition. Consequently, the values of the world interest
33:974:73325:21:36:43:249:518:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:rate are lower than in the baseline path.
33:975:73366:36:30:43:294:482:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:3. Doubling of Immigration in All Regions
33:976:73407:30:21:72:540:452:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The sixth panels in Tables 4 through 7 show the impacts of immediately and permanently
33:977:73493:21:22:43:539:431:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:doubling immigration in all four regions.  This means, for example, that in 2004 2 million immi-
33:978:73589:22:30:43:505:409:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:grants enter the U.S., 900,000 enter the EU, 108,000 enter Japan, and 780,000 exit China.
33:979:73678:30:21:72:540:379:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:As is clear from the figures for effective labor supply, doubling immigration makes a material
33:980:73772:21:22:43:539:358:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:difference to the long-run supply of labor in all four regions. Take the developed regions. Relative
33:981:73872:22:22:43:539:336:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:to the baseline simulation, this policy raises effective labor supply in 2100 by 31 percent in the
33:982:73970:22:21:43:539:314:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:U.S., by 21 percent in the EU, and by 10 percent in Japan.  The remarkable thing is how long
33:983:74062:21:22:43:539:293:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:it takes for immigration to alter effective labor supplies.  In the U.S., for example, the effective
33:984:74162:22:22:43:539:271:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:supply of labor is only 11 percent larger in 2030 despite a doubling of immigration starting in
33:985:74257:22:29:43:459:249:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:2004. The comparable figures for the EU and Japan are 6 percent and 2 percent.
33:986:74335:29:22:72:540:220:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Given that the developed world’s severe fiscal problems associated with aging will begin to
33:987:74426:22:22:43:539:198:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:appear well before 2030, it would seem that even a doubling of immigration is “too little too late”.
33:988:74526:22:21:43:539:176:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:This, indeed, is what the other figures in the second panel of results show. Relative to the baseline
33:989:74627:21:22:43:539:155:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:simulation, doubling immigration makes little difference to any of the three countries in terms of
33:990:74725:22:30:43:201:133:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:their macroeconomic variables.
33:991:74755:30:0:72:540:103:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Take the U.S. In 2030 the payroll tax rate is 15.3 percent with a doubling of immigration
34:992:74846:0:22:43:539:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:– not much lower than the 16.4 percent rate without the extra immigrants.  In 2100 the payroll
34:993:74940:22:22:43:539:699:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:tax rate is 22.4 percent, compared with 23.0 percent under base-case immigration policy. Factor
34:994:75035:22:21:43:539:677:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:prices are also essentially unchanged by a doubling of immigration.  In 2030, the pre-tax wage is
34:995:75132:21:22:43:539:656:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:1.17 in both simulations. And in 2100, the pre-tax wage is 1.05 compared to 1.04 in the base case.
34:996:75230:22:22:43:539:634:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The explanation here is that while the long-run U.S. labor supply rises by 31 percent, the long-run
34:997:75329:22:29:43:532:612:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:capital stock rises by 33 percent, leaving the long-run capital-labor ratio essentially unchanged.
34:998:75427:29:22:72:540:583:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:If the long-run real wage in the U.S. stays fixed, but labor supply rises by 31 percent, why
34:999:75519:22:22:43:539:561:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:doesn’t the payroll tax rate and, for that matter, the average wage tax rate fall by 31 percent in
34:1000:75617:22:21:43:539:539:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:light of the 31 percent larger long-run supply of effective labor?  The answer is that the model
34:1001:75713:21:22:43:539:518:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:provides new immigrants with public goods and social insurance benefits on the same basis as
34:1002:75805:22:22:43:539:496:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:existing natives.  And doubling the number of immigrants on an across-the-board basis ends up
34:1003:75898:22:21:43:539:474:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:costing the U.S. government almost as much in additional expenditures as the U.S. government
34:1004:75990:21:22:43:539:453:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:earns in additional revenues.  As tables 5 and 6 indicate, the same can be said of the EU and
34:1005:76083:22:30:43:77:431:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Japan.
34:1006:76089:30:21:72:540:401:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Of course, the opposite happens in China. Higher emigration reduces China’s long-run labor
34:1007:76179:21:22:43:539:380:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:supply by 5 percent and long-run capital stock by 3 percent. More emigrants means a reduction in
34:1008:76275:22:22:43:539:358:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the taxable wage base and thus an increase in payroll tax rates. However, as the results indicate,
34:1009:76373:22:29:43:287:336:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the changes in payroll tax rates are quite small.
34:1010:76422:29:22:72:540:307:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Table 10 reports the welfare effects of doubling immigration.   Almost all cohorts in the
34:1011:76511:22:22:43:539:285:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:developed regions experience welfare gains, albeit mostly very small ones.  For initially younger
34:1012:76608:22:21:43:539:263:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:and future generations these gains stem from the reduction in payroll taxes. The gains are smaller
34:1013:76706:21:22:43:539:242:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:for members of the high-skilled class because the ceiling on key payroll taxes limits the benefits
34:1014:76804:22:22:43:539:220:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:they can experience from cuts in these taxes.  Welfare gains are generally higher in the U.S. and
34:1015:76901:22:21:43:539:198:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the EU. This is particularly true of younger and future cohorts. Indeed, for the low-skilled cohort
34:1016:77000:21:22:43:539:177:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:born in 2030, the welfare gain is 2.07 percent in the EU and 1.35 percent in the U.S., but only
34:1017:77095:22:22:43:539:155:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:1.03 percent in Japan.  Unlike the gains of initial older generations, these gains are substantial.
34:1018:77194:22:21:43:539:133:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:They appear to reflect the reduction in excess burden arising from even the modest reductions in
34:1019:77290:21:0:43:330:112:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:marginal tax rates arising from the immigration reform.
35:1020:77347:0:22:72:540:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Initially middle-aged people in China experience small welfare gains which are mainly due
35:1021:77436:22:22:43:539:699:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:to small reductions in the average wage tax.  In contrast, younger and future cohorts experience
35:1022:77532:22:21:43:539:677:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:welfare losses.  Of course, the reasons are the higher payroll tax rates throughout the transition.
35:1023:77631:21:22:43:539:656:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:As one would expect from the macroeconomic outcomes, welfare effects in China are much smaller
35:1024:77725:22:36:43:198:634:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:than in the developed regions.
35:1025:77755:36:29:43:213:598:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:VIII. Social Security Policies
35:1026:77785:29:22:72:540:569:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:This section considers different social insurance policy scenarios. The first is a larger increase
35:1027:77883:22:22:43:539:547:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:in health expenditures than that assumed in the base case. The second and third scenarios analyze
35:1028:77980:22:21:43:539:525:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the consequences of different financing methods for the social security systems. The fourth scenario
35:1029:78080:21:22:43:539:504:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:considers cuts in state pension systems.  The final scenario is a privatization of public pension
35:1030:78177:22:36:43:86:482:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:systems.
35:1031:78185:36:29:43:242:446:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:1. Increased Health Expenditures
35:1032:78217:29:22:72:540:417:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:In this simulation, health expenditures increase by 3 percent during the first 25 years of the
35:1033:78311:22:22:43:539:395:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:transition instead of the 2 percent rate assumed in the base case. The simulation results are shown
35:1034:78410:22:29:43:268:373:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:in the seventh panels of Tables 4 through 7.
35:1035:78454:29:22:72:540:344:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Of course, higher health expenditures increase social security contributions. The additional
35:1036:78546:22:22:43:539:322:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:increase in payroll taxes depend on the relative sizes of overall health expenditures and populations
35:1037:78647:22:21:43:539:300:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:in each region. Thus in 2030, payroll tax rates are 1.3 percentage points in the U.S., 3.2 percentage
35:1038:78748:21:22:43:539:279:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:points in the EU, and 3.5 percentage points in Japan and China above their baseline values.  In
35:1039:78843:22:22:43:539:257:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:year 2100 the difference is 1.8 percentage points in the U.S., 3.2 percentage points in the EU, 3.7
35:1040:78942:22:29:43:371:235:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:percentage points in Japan, and 0.8 percentage points in China.
35:1041:79005:29:22:72:540:206:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The higher payroll tax burden leads to lower net wages.  Consequently, medium-term and
35:1042:79091:22:22:43:539:184:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:long-run capital stocks are below their respective base-case values.  The lower capital formation
35:1043:79188:22:21:43:539:162:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:is partly offset by higher capital inflows into the three developed regions from China during the
35:1044:79285:21:22:43:539:141:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:first decades of the century. This explains the slightly increased output growth during this period.
35:1045:79385:22:22:43:539:119:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:In the long run, output in the U.S. and China is lower compared to the base case and higher in
35:1046:79479:22:0:43:539:97:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the EU and Japan.  This is due to the adjustment in effective labor supply in order to offset the
36:1047:79578:0:22:43:539:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:income losses. Higher output growth during the first decades and lower wages in the second half
36:1048:79673:22:29:43:365:699:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:of the century lead to an additional increase in wage tax rates.
36:1049:79737:29:22:72:540:670:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The welfare effects of this simulation as reported in Table 11 confirm our macroeconomic
36:1050:79825:22:21:43:539:648:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:findings.  Apart from small welfare gains for initially older generations in the EU and Japan,
36:1051:79919:21:22:43:539:627:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:all cohorts already alive in the initial year and all future cohorts experience welfare losses from
36:1052:80018:22:22:43:539:605:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:increased health expenditures. The explanation is the higher payroll and wage tax rates. Since the
36:1053:80116:22:21:43:539:583:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:additional tax burden increases with time, welfare losses rise with the birth year of the observed
36:1054:80214:21:22:43:539:562:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:generations.  Note also the differences in welfare losses between the four regions.  Generations in
36:1055:80313:22:22:43:539:540:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the EU and Japan are hurt much more than people in the U.S. and China.  This indicates the
36:1056:80403:22:33:43:537:518:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:bigger size in health expenditures in the former two regions and thus the larger rise in tax rates.
36:1057:80502:33:29:43:515:485:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:2. Financing Social Security Benefits at the Margin with General Tax Revenues
36:1058:80579:29:22:72:540:456:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Next we consider a scenario where payroll tax rates are fixed at their year-2004 value through-
36:1059:80674:22:21:43:539:434:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:out the transition.  The budgets of the social security systems are then financed by general tax
36:1060:80770:21:29:43:441:413:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:revenues. The results are reported in the eighth panels of Tables 4 through 7.
36:1061:80848:29:22:72:540:384:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Balancing the future budgets of the social security systems by general tax revenues increases
36:1062:80941:22:22:43:539:362:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the wage tax rate in all four regions. In year 2100, the average wage tax rate is now 17.8 percent
36:1063:81039:22:21:43:539:340:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:in the U.S. instead of 6.8 percent in the base case.  In the EU it is 17.8 percent instead of 7.4
36:1064:81136:21:22:43:539:319:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:percent, in Japan 12.0 percent instead of 2.7 percent, and in China 17.6 percent instead of 1.9
36:1065:81231:22:22:43:539:297:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:percent.  Note that the wage tax rates do not increase as much as the payroll tax rates would
36:1066:81324:22:21:43:539:275:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:otherwise have risen because there is no ceiling on wages subject to taxation.  This differentially
36:1067:81423:21:22:43:539:254:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:reduces the welfare of high-earnings agents.  It also reduces their ability to save and their desire
36:1068:81523:22:22:43:539:232:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:to work.  Thus capital stocks, labor supply and national income are lower than in the base case.
36:1069:81619:22:29:43:506:210:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The course of current accounts, wage rates, and interest rates are, however, little changed.
36:1070:81711:29:21:72:540:181:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Table 13 records the welfare effects of this policy.  Agents in the low- and middle income
36:1071:81801:21:22:43:539:160:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:classes experience welfare gains since they now face a lower tax burden. Note also the differences in
36:1072:81902:22:22:43:539:138:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:welfare effects between the developed regions, which stem from the different extents of population
36:1073:82000:22:21:43:539:116:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:aging in the three regions.  At first glance it might be surprising that initially middle-aged and
36:1074:82098:21:0:43:539:95:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:younger cohorts in the low- and middle-income classes in China experience small welfare losses
37:1075:82194:0:22:43:539:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:and those in the high-income class enjoy welfare gains. The reason is that payroll taxes in China
37:1076:82291:22:22:43:539:699:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:decline in the base-case transition during the first few decades. Keeping payroll tax rates fixed at
37:1077:82391:22:21:43:539:677:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the year-2004 level translates into lower average wage tax rates during these decades than would
37:1078:82487:21:22:43:539:656:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:otherwise be the case.  This, of course, hurts people in the low- and middle-income class, while
37:1079:82583:22:34:43:225:634:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:those in the high-income class gain.
37:1080:82619:34:28:43:406:600:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:3. Financing Social Security Benefits With Government Debt
37:1081:82677:28:22:72:540:572:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:This scenario examines the consequences of financing social security benefits through 2029
37:1082:82767:22:22:43:539:550:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:with government debt. To be precise, we keep payroll tax rates in each region fixed at their year-
37:1083:82865:22:21:43:539:528:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:2004 values through 2029.  We also fix the intercept and the progressive terms of our wage tax
37:1084:82959:21:22:43:539:507:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:rate formula at their 2004 values. The government’s general budget and the budgets of the social
37:1085:83055:22:22:43:539:485:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:security systems are then balanced with government debt. Starting in year 2030, payroll tax rates
37:1086:83152:22:21:43:539:463:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:and the intercept of the payroll tax rate formula endogenously adjust to balance social security
37:1087:83248:21:22:43:539:442:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:systems and government general budgets, respectively.  In the years 2030 and thereafter we keep
37:1088:83343:22:22:43:539:420:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:government debt fixed as a share of national income.  The ninth panels in Tables 4 through 7
37:1089:83435:22:29:43:115:398:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:report results.
37:1090:83450:29:21:72:540:369:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:In the U.S. debt increases from 33.3 percent of national income in 2004 to 73.8 percent in
37:1091:83540:21:22:43:539:348:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:2100, in the EU from 38.9 percent in 2004 to 134.6 percent in 2100 and in Japan from 41.4 percent
37:1092:83637:22:22:43:539:326:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:in 2004 to 249.5 percent in 2100. In China, payroll tax and wage tax rates decline, with some minor
37:1093:83736:22:21:43:539:304:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:exceptions, in each year during the first few decades of the base-case transition.  Consequently,
37:1094:83833:21:22:43:539:283:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:holding these tax rates fixed through 2030 in China means running a surplus.  Indeed, in 2100
37:1095:83926:22:22:43:539:261:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:government debt in China is negative 38.8 percent of national income, rather than positive 10
37:1096:84019:22:29:43:244:239:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:percent – its base-case year 2100 value.
37:1097:84059:29:21:72:540:210:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Higher debt ultimately implies higher average tax rates in order to finance higher interest
37:1098:84150:21:22:43:539:189:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:payments.  In 2100, average wage tax rates are 11.8 percent in the U.S., 21.9 percent in the EU,
37:1099:84246:22:22:43:539:167:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:and 30.5 percent in Japan.  The corresponding 2100 base-case average wage tax rates are 6.8
37:1100:84337:22:29:43:396:145:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:percent in the U.S., 7.4 percent in the EU, and 2.7 percent in Japan.
37:1101:84406:29:21:72:540:116:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:These are, obviously, huge increases.  Of course, one would expect that capital formation,
37:1102:84496:21:0:43:539:95:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:labor supply and output growth to be greatly reduced by this policy.  But this doesn’t happen
38:1103:84591:0:30:43:178:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:thanks to China’s surplus.
38:1104:84617:30:22:72:540:691:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Next consider the welfare effects of this policy shown in Table 14.  Initial middle-aged and
38:1105:84709:22:21:43:539:669:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:younger generations in the U.S., the EU and Japan gain from this policy reform.  This reflects,
38:1106:84804:21:22:43:539:648:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:of course, the fact that they enjoy constant rather than rising tax rates through 2030. The gains
38:1107:84901:22:22:43:539:626:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:are largest in Japan since in the baseline path the increase in social security contributions is the
38:1108:85001:22:21:43:539:604:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:largest. Future cohorts in the developed regions experience remarkably large welfare losses. These
38:1109:85099:21:22:43:539:583:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:stem from the large increase in wage taxes to finance the higher government debt.  Take, as an
38:1110:85193:22:22:43:539:561:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:example, members of the 2030 Japanese birth cohort.  They experience a 20.25 percent welfare
38:1111:85285:22:21:43:539:539:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:loss. These show the dramatic increase in excess burdens due to the adjustment in the wage taxes.
38:1112:85382:21:22:43:539:518:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The opposite is observed in China. Here middle-aged people lose from the reform since they now
38:1113:85476:22:22:43:539:496:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:face higher payroll tax burdens. Future cohorts, however, experience welfare gains from the lower
38:1114:85573:22:35:43:197:474:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:and even negative wage taxes.
38:1115:85602:35:30:43:320:439:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:4. Cutting Pension-Benefit Replacement Rates
38:1116:85646:30:22:72:540:409:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:As mentioned, our baseline path includes the legislated cut of the pension replacement rates
38:1117:85738:22:21:43:539:387:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:in Japan of 20 percent that is being phased in between now and 2017. We now assume the same cut
38:1118:85833:21:22:43:539:366:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:in all other regions over the same period. The simulation results are reported in the tenth panels
38:1119:85931:22:22:43:539:344:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:of Tables 4 through 7.  In 2100, social security contribution rates are reduced by 3.6 percentage
38:1120:86028:22:21:43:539:322:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:points in the U.S., by 4.7 percentage points in the EU, and by 4.6 percentage points in China
38:1121:86121:21:22:43:539:301:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:compared to the respective baseline values.  As one would expect, this policy increases capital
38:1122:86216:22:22:43:539:279:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:formation in the three regions. Thus the long-run capital stock is increased by 11.6 percent in the
38:1123:86315:22:21:43:539:257:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:U.S., by 10.3 percent in the EU and by 11.2 percent in China relative to the base case.  At the
38:1124:86410:21:22:43:539:236:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:same time, labor supply is slightly reduced, and output growth increases. The higher capital-labor
38:1125:86508:22:22:43:539:214:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:ratios lead to higher wages and lower interest rates during the transition.  Due to higher wage
38:1126:86603:22:29:43:512:192:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:income, the average wage tax rates in the three regions are lower than in the baseline path.
38:1127:86695:29:22:72:540:163:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The pension reform in the U.S., the EU and China also affects the Japanese economy in
38:1128:86780:22:22:43:539:141:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the future.  Higher capital stocks in the U.S., the EU and China lead to larger capital imports
38:1129:86875:22:21:43:539:119:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:by Japan.  Consequently, Japan’s capital stock and national income is also higher compared to
38:1130:86968:21:0:43:539:98:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the base case.  The increase in wages during the transition lowers payroll tax rates slightly since
39:1131:87069:0:22:43:539:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:labor supply remains unaffected. However, the average wage tax rate increases due to the higher
39:1132:87164:22:29:43:447:699:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:growth in general government expenditures arising from higher output growth.
39:1133:87240:29:22:72:540:670:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:As the welfare effects in Table 15 indicate, initially middle-aged people lose from this pol-
39:1134:87333:22:21:43:539:648:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:icy reform in all four regions.  In the U.S., the EU, and China this reflects the cut in pension
39:1135:87429:21:22:43:539:627:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:replacement rates. People now receive lower benefits than under the baseline scenario. In Japan
39:1136:87524:22:22:43:539:605:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the losses stem from the increases in the average wage tax rate.  Initial older cohorts in the four
39:1137:87623:22:21:43:539:583:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:regions are almost unaffected. Initial young and future cohorts, however, gain in all four regions.
39:1138:87722:21:22:43:539:562:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The reason is mainly the reduction in payroll and wage tax rates in the U.S., the EU, and China
39:1139:87817:22:22:43:539:540:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:and the increased wages that outweigh the benefit losses. In Japan, the welfare gains of the low-
39:1140:87914:22:21:43:539:518:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:and middle-income classes also stem from the reduction in payroll taxes and the higher wages.
39:1141:88007:21:34:43:486:497:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The highest income classes are adversely affected by the increase in the wage tax rate.
39:1142:88094:34:29:43:179:463:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:5. Privatizing Pensions
39:1143:88117:29:21:72:540:434:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Our final reform is complete pension privatization, which we model as the elimination of any
39:1144:88209:21:22:43:539:413:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:new public pension benefit accrual coupled with the establishment of individual accounts.  The
39:1145:88303:22:22:43:539:391:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:reform entails paying off all accrued benefits to all those retired in 2004 and to all those working
39:1146:88403:22:21:43:539:369:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:in 2004 when they reach retirement.  To approximate this payoff of accrued benefits we pay all
39:1147:88497:21:22:43:539:348:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:initial retirees their full benefits over time and pay post-2004 retirees benefits in retirement whose
39:1148:88599:22:22:43:539:326:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:values are linearly phased out over a 45-year period starting in 2004.  Thus, the members of the
39:1149:88695:22:21:43:539:304:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:cohort retiring in 2005 receive in public pension benefits 44/45ths of what they would otherwise
39:1150:88791:21:22:43:539:283:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:have received.  The members of the cohort retiring in 2006 receive 43/45ths of what they would
39:1151:88885:22:29:43:136:261:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:have received, etc.
39:1152:88904:29:22:72:540:232:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:We finance the move to individual accounts via consumption taxation. Specifically, we com-
39:1153:88994:22:21:43:539:210:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:pletely eliminate those payroll taxes used to finance state pensions and impose a new consumption
39:1154:89091:21:22:43:539:189:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:tax in each region to pay, over time, all accrued benefits.  By 2078 all accrued pension benefits
39:1155:89188:22:29:43:464:167:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:have been paid off, so the new consumption tax rates from that point on are zero.
39:1156:89269:29:22:72:540:138:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The key feature of the reform is not “privatization” per se, but rather the intergenerational
39:1157:89362:22:21:43:539:116:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:redistribution associated with moving to private accounts.  The redistribution comprises three
39:1158:89456:21:0:43:539:95:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:element. First, the shift from payroll to consumption taxation reduces the tax burden on current
40:1159:89554:0:22:43:539:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:and future workers and shifts it onto current retirees.  Second, paying current workers (those
40:1160:89648:22:22:43:539:699:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:working in 2004) when they reach retirement only their accrued state pension benefits rather
40:1161:89740:22:21:43:539:677:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:than their projected benefits represents a cut in transfer payments that hurts those workers but
40:1162:89836:21:22:43:539:656:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:benefits future workers who would otherwise have had to help pay for those benefits. Third, factor
40:1163:89934:22:22:43:539:634:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:price changes arising from this policy help later generations at the cost of hurting earlier ones.
40:1164:90032:22:21:43:539:612:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Specifically, later generations benefit from higher real wages, while earlier generations lose from
40:1165:90131:21:30:43:240:591:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:receiving lower returns on their assets.
40:1166:90171:30:21:72:540:561:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:There is no need to formally model the private accounts in which agents would be forced to
40:1167:90261:21:22:43:539:540:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:save as part of this privatization reform. The reason is that our agents face no liquidity constraints.
40:1168:90364:22:22:43:539:518:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Hence, they are free to borrow against their private account balances if they wish to consume more
40:1169:90462:22:22:43:539:496:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:than their disposable income net of contributions to these accounts.  Consequently, forcing our
40:1170:90557:22:29:43:290:474:143:g_d0_f4:64:g_d0_f5:agents to save has no impact on their behavior.7
40:1171:90605:29:22:72:540:445:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:In the U.S., the additional consumption tax rate needed to pay off accrued pension benefits
40:1172:90696:22:21:43:539:423:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:is initially 6.8 percent and gradually declines thereafter. The U.S. payroll tax rate declines imme-
40:1173:90796:21:22:43:539:402:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:diately by 7.8 percentage points. Over the transition, the payroll tax rate rises by 2.7 percentage
40:1174:90895:22:29:43:387:380:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:points since expenses for health care and disability insurance grow.
40:1175:90963:29:22:72:540:351:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:In the EU, the added consumption tax rate has an initial value of 15.0 percent and then
40:1176:91050:22:22:43:539:329:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:declines. Because of this reform, the payroll tax is reduced by 14.6 percentage points in year 2004
40:1177:91149:22:21:43:539:307:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:and rises to a maximum of 13.9 percent in 2075.  In Japan, the consumption tax rate is initially
40:1178:91245:21:22:43:539:286:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:11.1 percent.  It then rises to a maximum of 12.7 percent in 2016 before declining.  The payroll
40:1179:91341:22:22:43:539:264:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:tax is 12.1 percentage points lower in 2004.  And the maximum value reached is 15.7 percent in
40:1180:91435:22:21:43:539:242:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:2050.  Finally, the initial rate of the new consumption tax in China is 10.5 percent.  The payroll
40:1181:91533:21:22:43:539:221:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:tax rates is initially reduced by 8 percentage points and rises to its maximum value of 5.5 percent
40:1182:91632:22:29:43:83:199:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:in 2075.
40:1183:91640:29:18:72:540:170:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Of course,since part of the tax burden is shifted from payroll taxes towards consumption
40:1184:91728:18:21:57:539:152:49:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f8:7Including liquidity constraints would require solving our agents’ utility maximization problems using dynamic
40:1185:91838:21:18:43:539:131:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:programming. Doing so would be much more time consuming. It would also introduce a degree of approximation
40:1186:91944:18:18:43:539:113:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:error into the solution that we avoid with our current formulation in which we find the solutions to the first order
40:1187:92060:18:0:43:527:95:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f8:conditions and budget constraints of our agents to a very high degree of precision using Gauss-Seidel iteration.
41:1188:92174:0:22:43:539:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:taxes, the burden on younger households falls and that on the elderly rises. The intergenerational
41:1189:92272:22:22:43:539:699:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:redistribution associated with the consumption tax depresses aggregate consumption, which per-
41:1190:92366:22:21:43:539:677:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:mits an increase in national saving and capital formation.  The long-run consequences of this
41:1191:92459:21:22:43:539:656:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:reform are dramatic in all three regions.  Relative to the base case simulations, the year 2100
41:1192:92554:22:22:43:539:634:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:capital stock increases by 87.6 percent in the U.S., by 81.1 percent in the E.U., by 90.4 percent
41:1193:92651:22:29:43:247:612:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:in Japan, and by 83.2 percent in China.
41:1194:92690:29:22:72:540:583:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The higher capital stocks increase gross wages,  which rise by 2100 by approximately 18
41:1195:92777:22:22:43:539:561:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:percent in all four regions. The combination of higher gross wages and reduced payroll and wage
41:1196:92872:22:21:43:539:539:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:taxes boosts net wages, which almost double in the four regions. The reductions in labor supplies
41:1197:92969:21:22:43:539:518:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:in the four regions, reported in Tables 4 to 7, are a direct consequence of the positive income
41:1198:93064:22:22:43:539:496:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:effects experienced by younger generations. Finally, capital accumulation leads to lower year-2100
41:1199:93162:22:29:43:113:474:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:interest rates.
41:1200:93177:29:22:72:540:445:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Of course, the advantageous macroeconomic effects of privatization come at a cost, which is
41:1201:93268:22:22:43:539:423:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:shown in Table 16.  The reform entails a major redistribution from older generations in all four
41:1202:93364:22:21:43:539:401:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:economies towards younger and future generations.  The intergenerational and intragenerational
41:1203:93458:21:22:43:539:380:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:redistribution is less severe in the U.S. compared to the EU, Japan and China,  whose initial
41:1204:93551:22:30:43:247:358:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:consumption tax rates are much higher.
41:1205:93589:30:21:72:540:328:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The elderly are hurt because they are now forced to pay for their pension benefits via the
41:1206:93679:21:22:43:539:307:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:consumption tax. Younger and future generations benefit enormously from the policy since they
41:1207:93772:22:22:43:539:285:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:face a much lower payroll tax burdens during their working years and experience much higher
41:1208:93863:22:21:43:539:263:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:wages. Consider middle-earning agents in the U.S. The oldest such agents included in Table 16 –
41:1209:93958:21:22:43:539:242:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:those born in 1920 experience a 2.9 percent reduction in welfare.  In contrast, the youngest such
41:1210:94055:22:22:43:539:220:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:agents included in the table – those born in 2030 – enjoy a 12.2 percent rise in welfare.  The
41:1211:94149:22:21:43:539:198:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:corresponding welfare losses and gains experienced by the 1920 and 2030 middle classes are 6.1
41:1212:94243:21:22:43:539:177:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:percent and 23.5 percent in the EU, 5.3 percent and 15.9 percent in Japan, and 6.3 percent and
41:1213:94337:22:30:43:157:155:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:13.3 percent in China.
41:1214:94359:30:21:72:540:125:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Another key feature of Table 16 is that the poor initial elderly experience larger welfare
41:1215:94449:21:0:43:539:104:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:losses than the middle class or rich initial elderly. The explanation for this differential welfare loss
42:1216:94555:0:22:43:539:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:is that both the poor and rich elderly are constrained with respect to their consumption of leisure
42:1217:94654:22:22:43:539:699:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:because they are both fully retired. However, the rich elderly are consuming a lot more than the
42:1218:94750:22:21:43:539:677:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:poor. Hence, while both the rich and the poor experience roughly the same percentage reduction
42:1219:94844:21:22:43:539:656:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:in consumption from the imposition of the consumption tax, the impact on their utilities are not
42:1220:94940:22:22:43:539:634:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the same because a) their initial consumption-leisure ratios differ and b) utility is not separable
42:1221:95039:22:33:43:223:612:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:with respect to the two arguments.
42:1222:95073:33:29:43:131:579:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:IX. Conclusion
42:1223:95087:29:22:72:540:550:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:The developed world and China all face enormous demographic changes which will greatly
42:1224:95173:22:21:43:539:528:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:challenge their already overly stressed fiscal institutions. Fortunately, our dynamic life-cycle model
42:1225:95275:21:22:43:539:507:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:suggests there may be a macroeconomic silver lining to this very gray demographic cloud.  The
42:1226:95368:22:22:43:539:485:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:silver lining is China, whose continued rapid acquisition of technology and human capital and
42:1227:95461:22:21:43:539:463:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:extraordinarily high rate of saving can dramatically raise the world’s supply of capital. Assuming
42:1228:95559:21:22:43:539:442:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:the developed world’s capital market remains open, China will gradually become the developed
42:1229:95651:22:29:43:204:420:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:world’s major source of capital.
42:1230:95683:29:22:72:540:391:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Indeed, assuming China attains the developed world’s living standard by the middle of this
42:1231:95773:22:21:43:539:369:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:century and also maintain its very high propensity to save, it will raise real wages in the developed
42:1232:95874:21:22:43:539:348:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:world by 40 percent. This is over and above real wage increases arising from technological change.
42:1233:95972:22:22:43:539:326:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Even were China to gradually adopt Western spending habits, real wages at mid Century will be
42:1234:96065:22:21:43:539:304:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:16 percent higher than is currently the case. This again is above and beyond what technological
42:1235:96160:21:29:43:219:283:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:change can be expected to deliver.
42:1236:96194:29:22:72:540:254:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Moreover, China’s contribution to the developed world’s own development is positive in the
42:1237:96284:22:22:43:539:232:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:short as well as long runs. Even though capital initially moves from the developed world to China,
42:1238:96382:22:21:43:539:210:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:there are no major short-run reductions in developed world real wages.  The reason is that the
42:1239:96476:21:22:43:539:189:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:prospect of higher future real wages leads developed world workers to supply less current labor.
42:1240:96572:22:22:43:539:167:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:This keeps initial developed world capital-labor ratios and the real wages on which they depend
42:1241:96667:22:29:43:105:145:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:from falling.
42:1242:96680:29:21:72:540:116:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Absent China, our model suggests a very gradual decline in the developed world’s capital
42:1243:96768:21:0:43:539:95:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:intensivity with real wages per unit of human capital 4 percent lower at the end of the Century
43:1244:96865:0:22:43:539:721:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:than they are today.  This is much less ominous news than we delivered in previous studies that
43:1245:96960:22:22:43:539:699:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:omitted China.  The reason is that we now incorporate government investment, which implies
43:1246:97050:22:29:43:194:677:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:more developed world saving.
43:1247:97078:29:22:72:540:648:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:In addition to examining China’s role in world economic development and incorporating
43:1248:97163:22:22:43:539:626:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:government investment, this study has entertained a variety of demographic and fiscal scenarios.
43:1249:97259:22:21:43:539:604:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Our demographic scenarios, which we apply to all four regions simultaneously, are a) maintaining
43:1250:97355:21:22:43:539:583:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:fertility rates at their current generally very low levels for much longer than governments now
43:1251:97450:22:22:43:539:561:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:project, b) increasing longevity at faster than projected rates, and c) immediately and permanently
43:1252:97549:22:29:43:199:539:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:doubling rates of immigration.
43:1253:97579:29:22:72:540:510:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Each of these demographic changes has very little impact on the overall macroeconomic
43:1254:97664:22:22:43:539:488:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:situation, but each makes a non-trivial difference to where payroll tax rates end up. For example,
43:1255:97762:22:21:43:539:466:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Japan’s payroll tax rate ends up 25 percent higher at the end of the century if its fertility rate
43:1256:97860:21:22:43:539:445:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:fails to rise to the now-projected 2050 level; the EU’s payroll tax rate ends 5 percentage points
43:1257:97957:22:22:43:539:423:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:higher in 2030 if EU life expectancy rises by 3 years more by 2050 than now expected; and the
43:1258:98050:22:29:43:500:401:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:U.S. payroll tax rate is reduced by 1 percent in 2050 if it doubles its rate of immigration.
43:1259:98142:29:22:72:540:372:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Our policy simulations raised the rate of growth of health expenditures over the next quarter
43:1260:98235:22:22:43:539:350:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:Century, switched, at the margin, to income-tax finance of government pension benefits, financed
43:1261:98331:22:21:43:539:328:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:future increases in aggregate pension benefits via increases in income taxes rather than payroll
43:1262:98427:21:22:43:539:307:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:taxes, and privatized state pension systems by paying off accrued pension benefits with a con-
43:1263:98521:22:22:43:539:285:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:sumption tax. Each of these policies has important impacts on the macro economy. But the one
43:1264:98613:22:21:43:539:263:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:with the biggest impact is the privatization of state pensions, which more than doubles long-run
43:1265:98709:21:22:43:539:242:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:ratios of physical capital per unit of human capital and raises long-run real wages by roughly
43:1266:98803:22:22:43:539:220:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:a quarter.  The policy delivers major benefits to future generations, both because of the higher
43:1267:98899:22:29:43:433:198:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:wages they earn and the dramatically lower payroll tax rates that they face.
43:1268:98975:29:22:72:540:169:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:To conclude, there is no reason to believe that China is currently eating our lunch or will do
43:1269:99069:22:22:43:539:147:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:so in the near future. On the contrary, there is good reason to believe that China is in the process
43:1270:99169:22:21:43:539:125:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:of taking us to diner by slowly but surely becoming the world’s biggest saver and the developed
43:1271:99264:21:0:43:213:104:143:g_d0_f4:143:g_d0_f4:world’s major supplier of capital.
