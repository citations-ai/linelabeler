2:25:1111:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:The  recent  rise  of  populist  anti-globalization  political  movements  has  led  to  concerns  that  the 
2:26:1220:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:current wave  of  globalization  that  goes  back  to  the  1870s  may  end  in  turmoil  just  like  the  first 
2:27:1332:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:wave which ended after World War I. It is too soon to tell. The decline and then levelling off of 
2:28:1429:14:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:trade and capital flows in recent years reflects the drastic decline in global real income during the 
2:29:1530:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:Great Recession. Other factors at work include the slowing down in the growth rate of China and 
2:30:1625:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:the  reversal  of  the extended  international  supply  chains  developed  in  the  1990s,  as  well  as 
2:31:1729:14:14:72:546:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:increased financial regulation across the world after the crisis. This suggests either a pause in the 
2:32:1830:14:42:72:421:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:pace of integration or more likely a slowing down, rather than a reversal.

3:42:2061:15:14:72:75:693:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B: 
3:43:2061:14:29:72:542:679:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The  recent  rise  of  populist  anti-globalization  political  movements  and  the  election  of  Donald 
3:44:2167:29:30:72:542:650:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Trump in the US in November 2016, preceded by Brexit in June 2016, has led to concerns that 
3:45:2258:30:29:72:542:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the current wave of globalization that goes back to the 1870s may end in turmoil just like the first 
3:46:2359:29:29:72:260:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:wave which ended after World War I.  
3:47:2394:29:30:72:542:562:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Globalization  defined  as  the  integration  of  the  markets  for  goods,  labor  and  financial capital 
3:48:2501:30:29:72:543:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:displayed a U-shaped pattern from 1870 until just recently (Bordo, Taylor and Williamson (2004)). 
3:49:2597:29:29:72:542:503:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:It  was  high  in  the  late  nineteenth  century  and  early  twentieth  century  and  then  dropped 
3:50:2699:29:30:72:542:474:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:significantly between World War I and World War II. It recovered in the post-World War II period 
3:51:2794:30:29:72:542:444:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with the advent of GATT and later WTO and the end of Bretton Woods capital controls and has 
3:52:2886:29:29:72:542:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:been growing at least until the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-2008. The first era of globalization 
3:53:2986:29:30:72:542:386:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ended  because  of  a  backlash  by  the losers  of  globalization  in  Europe,  the U.S., and  elsewhere 
3:54:3090:30:29:72:542:356:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:leading to an increase in tariff barriers, capital controls and restrictions on immigration. It also 
3:55:3191:29:29:72:542:327:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ended because of the breakdown in the international political order leading to World War I and 
3:56:3286:29:29:72:542:298:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:its subsequent upheavals in Europe and Asia. Many observers worry that a repeated backlash is 
3:57:3379:29:30:72:542:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in  the  works  at  present  or  in  the  near  future.  The  data  (see  below)  shows  a  decline  and  then 
3:58:3490:30:29:72:542:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:flattening in world trade and capital flows since the GFC but not in migration. This is viewed by 
3:59:3588:29:29:72:275:210:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:some as a portent of bad things to come. 
3:60:3628:29:30:72:542:181:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:I  argue  that  it  is  too  soon  to  tell.  The  decline  and  then  levelling  off  of  trade  and  capital  flows 
3:61:3746:30:29:72:543:151:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reflects  the drastic decline  in  global  real  income during  the  Great  Recession.  Other  factors  at 
3:62:3851:29:29:72:542:122:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:work  include  the  slowdown  in  the  growth  rate  of  China  and  the  reversal  of  the  extended 
3:63:3953:29:0:72:542:93:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:international  supply  chains  developed  in  the  1990s,  as  well  as  increased  financial  regulation 
4:64:4060:0:29:72:543:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:across the world after the crisis. This suggests either a pause in the pace of integration or more 
4:65:4158:29:29:72:181:679:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:likely a slowing down.

4:67:4180:30:29:72:264:620:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:C:2.  U shaped Pattern of Globalization 
4:68:4214:29:29:90:214:591:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:C:2.1. International Trade. 
4:69:4238:29:30:72:542:562:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The growth of trade relative to population and income began in earnest in the early nineteenth 
4:70:4333:30:29:72:542:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:century. It was driven by technological change which vastly reduced the costs of shipping goods, 
4:71:4429:29:29:72:542:503:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a  reduction  in tariffs  and  political  stability  (see  Figure 1  Panel A).  Empirical  evidence  for 
4:72:4532:29:30:72:542:474:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:globalization is based on two dimensions: a) the growth of international trade relative to income; 
4:73:4630:30:29:72:542:444:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:b)  convergence  in  the  price  of  traded  commodities  (Findlay and O’Rourke (2004)).  On  both 
4:74:4729:29:29:72:542:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dimensions, although the process of informational integration began with the opening up of the 
4:75:4822:29:30:72:542:386:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:world with the Age of Discovery in the sixteenth century, the major spurt in globalization did not 
4:76:4921:30:29:72:542:356:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:really occur until after the Napoleonic wars. The growth of trade from 1500 to 1800 averaged a 
4:77:5014:29:29:72:542:327:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:little over one per cent per year, while population grew by 0.25 per cent. Between 1815 and 1914 
4:78:5111:29:29:72:542:298:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trade measured by exports grew by 3.5 per cent per year versus income growth of 2.7 per cent. 
4:79:5205:29:30:72:542:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In the twentieth century, as a whole aggregate, trade growth was similar but did not outpace the 
4:80:5300:30:29:72:385:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:growth of output to the same extent as in the previous century. 
4:81:5363:29:29:72:542:210:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Commodity  price  convergence  was  also  dramatic  in  the  nineteenth  century.  For  example, 
4:82:5460:29:30:72:542:181:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:because of a massive decline in transportation costs (steamships and railroads) the price of wheat 
4:83:5557:30:29:72:410:151:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in Liverpool relative to Chicago fell from 58% in 1870 to 16% in 1913. 
4:84:5627:29:29:74:542:122:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B: In  addition  to  falling  transport  costs,  globalization  was  spread  by  big  reductions  in  tariff 
4:85:5733:29:0:72:542:93:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f2:B:protection, beginning with Britain’s reduction of the corn laws (tariffs on  grain)  after  the 
5:86:5828:0:29:72:542:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Napoleonic Wars and culminating in their abolition in 1846. The movement towards free trade 
5:87:5920:29:29:72:542:679:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:spread across Europe in a series of reciprocal agreements beginning with the Cobden Chevalier 
5:88:6013:29:30:72:543:650:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Treaty  in  1860  between  Great  Britain  and  France.  Within  the  next  two  decades virtually  all  of 
5:89:6120:30:29:72:542:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Europe  reduced  tariffs (to the  10-15%  range  from  35%)  in  a  series  of  bilateral  agreements 
5:90:6221:29:29:72:287:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:incorporating Most Favored Nation clauses. 
5:91:6263:29:30:72:542:562:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The liberalization process was temporarily reversed after 1879 with the introduction of tariffs by 
5:92:6362:30:29:72:542:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Germany and France and then other countries. A decline in land rents consequent upon declining 
5:93:6457:29:29:72:542:503:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:world  agricultural  prices led  to  a  backlash  and  a  renewal  of  protection (O’Rourke,  Taylor and 
5:94:6561:29:30:72:542:474:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Williamson (1996)), although the level of effective protection (with the principal exception of the 
5:95:6659:30:29:72:242:444:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:U.S.) still remained low until 1914. 
5:96:6694:29:29:74:542:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B: World  War  I  disrupted  trade with  tariffs  and  quotas  and  then  after  the  war  the  movement 
5:97:6795:29:30:72:542:386:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:toward protection increased. The U.S. with the Fordney McCumber tariff of 1922 and then the 
5:98:6886:30:29:72:543:356:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Smoot Hawley tariff of 1930 was the worst offender. Other countries retaliated, e.g. Great Britain 
5:99:6983:29:29:72:542:327:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with the Ottawa Agreement of 1932. The Great Depression led to increasing tariffs to stimulate 
5:100:7077:29:29:72:542:298:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:recovery. By the eve of World war II multilateral trade collapsed into a system of bilateral trade 
5:101:7176:29:30:72:239:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and quotas (see Figure 1 Panel B). 
5:102:7209:30:29:72:542:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Trade and globalization revived after World War II with the GATT (General Agreement in Tariffs 
5:103:7303:29:29:72:542:210:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and Trade) which was created by the international community – along with the IMF, World Bank 
5:104:7394:29:30:72:542:181:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and other international organizations. Successive rounds of tariff negotiation from 1947 to the 
5:105:7490:30:29:72:543:151:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:1990s virtually eliminated tariffs on manufactured goods in advanced countries. The WTO (World 
5:106:7583:29:29:72:542:122:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Trade Organization), which succeeded GATT in 1994, has been engaged in reducing tariff barriers 
5:107:7677:29:0:72:542:93:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and protection in services and agriculture in areas not covered by GATT. It also includes emerging 
6:108:7777:0:29:72:543:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:market countries in its mandate. As can be as seen by Figure 1 Panel C, by the 1970s the ratio of 
6:109:7873:29:29:72:390:679:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trade to GDP reached the level of the earlier era of globalization.

6:111:7940:30:29:90:181:620:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:C:2.2. Capital Flows 
6:112:7957:29:29:72:542:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Like the market for goods, international financial markets enjoyed two eras of globalization, from 
6:113:8055:29:30:72:542:562:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:1870 to 1914 and since 1973. The pace of international integration of finance (capital), followed 
6:114:8153:30:29:72:542:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a U-shaped pattern (Obstfeld and Taylor (2004)) with integration interrupted by the imposition 
6:115:8248:29:29:72:542:503:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of capital controls in the era of the World Wars, the Great Depression and the Bretton Woods 
6:116:8341:29:30:72:113:474:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:System. 
6:117:8348:30:29:72:542:444:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The U-shaped pattern of financial globalization can be seen in Figure 2, which shows net capital 
6:118:8443:29:29:72:542:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:flows from 1870 to the present for 12 advanced countries, and Figure 3, which adds in a number 
6:119:8536:29:30:72:542:386:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of emerging countries since 1973. Within this long sweep of data, we can see four episodes: 1) 
6:120:8630:30:29:72:542:356:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:1870 to 1914 the era of the classical gold standard with London at the center. Adherence to the 
6:121:8723:29:29:72:543:327:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:gold standard ensured stable exchange rates and acted as a commitment mechanism or “Good 
6:122:8810:29:29:72:542:298:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Housekeeping Seal of Approval” (Bordo and Rockoff (1996)). During this period, massive capital 
6:123:8904:29:30:72:542:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:flows led to the convergence of interest rates across countries; 2) 1914 to 1945, World War I, the 
6:124:8999:30:29:72:542:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Great Depression and World War II disrupted the pattern of financial globalization as capital and 
6:125:9097:29:29:72:542:210:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:exchange controls were instituted; 3)1945 to 1973, the Bretton Woods era. Trade resumed under 
6:126:9191:29:30:72:542:181:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Bretton  Woods  but  member  countries  had  to impose  capital  controls;  4)1973  to  the  Great 
6:127:9289:30:0:72:520:151:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Financial Crisis. This is an era of floating exchange rates and the removal of capital controls. 
7:128:9386:0:29:74:542:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B: Obstfeld and Taylor (2004) explain this U-shaped pattern in financial market integration in terms 
7:129:9483:29:29:72:542:679:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f2:B:of Mundell’s policy  trilemma  between  open  capital  markets, pegged  exchange  rates  and 
7:130:9575:29:30:72:462:650:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:independent monetary policy. Only two of the three can hold at the same time.

7:132:9652:29:29:90:164:591:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:C:2.3. Migration 
7:133:9665:29:30:74:542:562:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B: Like the commodity markets and capital flows, international migration surged in the nineteenth 
7:134:9760:30:29:72:542:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:century, declined after World War I. Before the nineteenth century, migration from the Old to 
7:135:9853:29:29:72:543:503:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the New World went through three stages: 1600 to 1790, slaves and contract labor; 1790 to 1850 
7:136:9948:29:30:72:542:474:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:free  settlers;  1850  to 1920, mass  migration (Chiswick  and  Hatton (2004)).  In  the  case  of  mass 
7:137:10051:30:29:72:543:444:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:migration from Europe to primarily the U.S, Canada, Australia and Argentina, 300,000 per year 
7:138:10144:29:29:72:542:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:moved between 1850 and 1880, 600,000 between 1880 and 1900, and over a million per year 
7:139:10230:29:30:72:543:386:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:between 1900 to 1910 (see Figure 4). The wave of migration largely reflected economic factors 
7:140:10323:30:29:72:403:356:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(higher wages in the New World and reduced transportation costs). 
7:141:10385:29:29:72:542:327:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:As  in the  case  of the  commodity  markets  and  financial flows,  a backlash  ensued  in the  face  of 
7:142:10491:29:29:72:542:298:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:declining  real wages  in  the  New  World. Restrictions  on  immigration  began  in  the  1890s, 
7:143:10587:29:30:72:542:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:culminating in a virtual shutdown by the 1920s. Many of the restrictions were not removed until 
7:144:10682:30:29:72:542:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:after World War II. In the decades before the Great Financial Crisis, although the absolute number 
7:145:10780:29:29:72:542:210:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of  people  moving  to  the  U.S.,  Canada  and  Australia  were  similar  to  the pre-1910 period, the 
7:146:10882:29:30:72:542:181:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:immigration rate for the U.S. was considerably lower than earlier, at 0.4 people per 1000 versus 
7:147:10978:30:29:72:124:151:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:11.6 then. 
7:148:10988:29:29:74:542:122:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B: Also in the second era of Globalization the source of migration to the New World changed from 
7:149:11079:29:0:72:542:93:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Europe to Asia and Latin America recently. Also, in the recent era, legal migrants are much more 
8:150:11177:0:29:72:542:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:highly  skilled  than  pre-World  War  I,  while there  has  been  a  surge  in  illegal  (largely)  unskilled 
8:151:11288:29:29:72:542:679:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:migration from the poor countries of the world to the advanced countries. Frequent attempts in 
8:152:11382:29:30:72:430:650:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the advanced countries to stem this flow have been largely unsuccessful. 
8:153:11454:30:29:72:75:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B: 
8:154:11454:29:29:90:179:591:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:C:2.4. The Backlash 
8:155:11470:29:30:72:542:562:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The first era of globalization ended badly with World War I, the Great Depression, and World War 
8:156:11565:30:29:72:543:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:II.  But  even before  the  demise  there  was  a  considerable  backlash  against  it.  James  (2001)  and 
8:157:11671:29:29:72:542:503:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f2:B:O’Rourke and Williamson (1999) argued that the process of globalization embodied the seeds of 
8:158:11765:29:30:72:542:474:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:its own destruction. The consequences of trade and factor mobility in the Golden Age was the 
8:159:11857:30:29:72:542:444:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:convergence of real wages and per capita real income between the Core countries of Western 
8:160:11948:29:29:72:542:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Europe and much of the periphery. According to Williamson (1996), this reflected the operation 
8:161:12042:29:30:72:542:386:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of  classical  trade  theory.  Both  factor  flows  and  goods  flows  fostered  factor  price  equalization. 
8:162:12152:30:29:72:542:356:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Most  of  the  convergence  in  real  wages (70%)  is  explained  by  factor  movements,  especially  by 
8:163:12257:29:29:72:542:327:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:labor  mobility, (with mobile  capital  a  minor  player);  the  rest  (30%) by  international  trade, 
8:164:12359:29:29:72:280:298:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:according to the Hecksher-Ohlin theorem. 
8:165:12398:29:30:72:542:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:These forces had important effects on the distribution of income. The massive migrations in the 
8:166:12494:30:29:72:542:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:1870  to  1914  period  reduced  the  returns  to  land  owners  in  the  land-scarce,  labor-abundant 
8:167:12597:29:29:72:543:210:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:countries of Europe and at the same time worsened the income distribution in the countries of 
8:168:12690:29:30:72:531:181:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:recent settlement, as unskilled immigrants competed with more established workers for jobs. 
8:169:12781:30:29:74:542:151:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B: A political backlash ensued in each region. In the Old World, landowners successfully lobbied for 
8:170:12879:29:29:72:542:122:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:increased tariff protection of agriculture in the last two decades of the nineteenth century. In the 
8:171:12980:29:0:72:542:93:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:U.S., Canada,  Australia  and Argentina, labor  was  ultimately  successful  in  closing  the  doors  to 
9:172:13084:0:29:72:542:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:migrants by the  second decade  of  the twentieth  century.  The  backlash  to  globalization  in  turn 
9:173:13188:29:29:72:542:679:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:may  have  fanned  the  flames  of  nationalism  and  been  a  key cause  of  World  War  I.  The  Great 
9:174:13293:29:30:72:542:650:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Depression made things worse as nations—in an attempt to protect their real incomes---raised 
9:175:13386:30:29:72:542:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tariff barriers and quotas, restricted immigration and terminated capital movements. We have 
9:176:13479:29:29:72:542:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:now been for close to fifty years in the second era of globalization. Are similar forces at work? 
9:177:13577:29:30:72:451:562:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Are we on the brink of a massive deglobalization as occurred in the interwar?

9:181:13730:30:29:90:143:444:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:C:3.1. Trade 
9:182:13739:29:29:72:542:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The global financial crisis of 2007-2008 led to a decline in world income not seen since the 1930s 
9:183:13837:29:30:72:542:386:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(Eichengreen and O’Rourke (2009)). World trade declined (by 10%) much more than world output 
9:184:13927:30:29:72:543:356:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and then snapped back to positive territory by 2011 (see Figure 5). But the growth of the ratio of 
9:185:14026:29:29:72:542:327:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trade to output from 2011-2015 declined dramatically compared to before the GFC, from 6.35 % 
9:186:14117:29:29:72:543:298:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:per  year  to 3.3%  (OECD (2015),  IMF (2015)).  Much  of  the  decline  in  trade reflected  cyclical 
9:187:14219:29:30:72:542:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:forces—the collapse  in  aggregate  demand  after  the GFC, especially  the  collapse  in  investment 
9:188:14320:30:29:72:542:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:which depended on inputs from abroad (OECD (2015)). But secular forces were also important. 
9:189:14411:29:29:72:542:210:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:These included the collapse of the global supply chain, which had developed slowly in the 1980s 
9:190:14505:29:30:72:543:181:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:between the advanced countries of North America, Europe and Japan on the one hand and China 
9:191:14595:30:29:72:542:151:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and other emerging Asian economies on the other hand (Baldwin (2016)). The development of 
9:192:14683:29:29:72:542:122:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:just  in  time  production  techniques led  to  the  formation  of completely  integrated  global 
9:193:14779:29:0:72:542:93:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:enterprises, operating  world-wide and combining  advanced  countries  technical  knowhow  with 
10:194:14876:0:29:72:543:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:emerging market lower cost labor (e.g. Walmart).  These supply chains collapsed in the GFC and 
10:195:14969:29:29:72:542:679:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:have not been fully restored yet. Moreover, the global supply chains in the GFC model has run 
10:196:15060:29:30:72:543:650:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:into  diseconomies  of  scale.  This  has led  many global  firms  to  localize their  production (WSJ 
10:197:15160:30:29:72:542:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(2016)).  Another  structural  factor  that  can  explain  the  significant  drop  in  the  growth  of  trade 
10:198:15270:29:29:72:542:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:relative to output is the slowing down in China (the key player after the U.S. with 15% of world 
10:199:15366:29:30:72:542:562:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:GDP) from above 9% per year before the crisis to 6.5% today. This reflects very deep structural 
10:200:15461:30:29:72:543:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:forces  including  slow  population  growth  as  a  consequence  of  the  one  child  policy  and  the 
10:201:15564:29:29:72:543:503:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:absorption of labor from the agricultural sector (Eichengreen (2016)).   A less important structural 
10:202:15663:29:30:72:543:474:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:factor for the decline in trade to GDP is increasing protection since the crisis (Huffbauer (2010)). 
10:203:15761:30:29:72:542:444:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:This is very different from what happened in the 1930s, when the rise of tariff protection was the 
10:204:15859:29:29:72:543:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:key  determinant  of the  collapse  of  global  trade  (Irwin (2010)). Thus, globalization  in  trade  has 
10:205:15964:29:30:72:478:386:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:downshifted. The interesting questions is whether this is temporary or permanent.

10:208:16062:29:29:72:543:298:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Capital flows also collapsed in the GFC and have not returned to their previous trend (see Figure 
10:209:16160:29:30:72:542:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:6). This reflects a number of forces: the slowdown in the real economy, risk aversion after the 
10:210:16256:30:29:72:542:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:crisis, and increased regulation of banks and the financial sector in every country as well as at the 
10:211:16358:29:29:72:542:210:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:international level (Basel III). As in the 1930s, banks were blamed for the crisis and regulation of 
10:212:16457:29:30:72:218:181:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:them increased considerably. 
10:213:16485:30:29:72:542:151:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:As  dramatic  as  the  collapse  in  international  capital  flows  is  the  collapse  of  cross  border  bank

10:215:16702:29:0:72:542:93:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:regulation, especially the use of micro prudential policy (an increase in the capital requirements 
11:216:16802:0:29:72:542:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on   cross   border   loans   relative   to   domestic   loans   in   BASEL   III)   which   interacted   with 
11:217:16913:29:29:72:542:679:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:unconventional monetary policy. Capital flows have recovered since the crisis but are at a much

11:221:17033:29:30:72:542:562:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The growth of immigration to the New World has slowed since the GFC but did not collapse (see 
11:222:17126:30:29:72:541:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Figure 8).  The  problem  of  refugees  and  illegal  immigration  has  increased  drastically  in  Europe

11:225:17295:30:29:72:122:444:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:C:Summary 
11:226:17302:29:29:72:543:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The recent empirical evidence suggests that the Global Financial Crisis was a huge shock which 
11:227:17396:29:30:72:542:386:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:has stalled the pace of globalization and may be the beginning of a reset. As well, like in the first 
11:228:17497:30:29:72:542:356:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:era of globalization, there has been a populist political backlash against globalization reflected in 
11:229:17597:29:29:72:542:327:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the election of nationalist parties in countries like Hungary and Poland, the vote for Brexit and 
11:230:17695:29:29:72:542:298:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the election of Donald Trump in the U.S. Just as in the first era of globalization the losers have 
11:231:17793:29:30:72:542:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:turned to political action (largely triggered by the income shock of the GFC but also deep seated 
11:232:17889:30:29:72:542:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dislocation  from  import  competition. (Autor et  al.  (2016)) and  others  have  provided  evidence 
11:233:17988:29:29:72:542:210:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that, since China joined the WTO in 2000, imports of manufactured goods have displaced large 
11:234:18080:29:30:72:542:181:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:numbers  of  workers  in  the  U.S.  (on  top  of  lesser  dislocation  from NAFTA  earlier) and  Western 
11:235:18185:30:29:72:542:151:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Europe. These losers from both globalization and technological change have been opponents of 
11:236:18278:29:0:72:443:122:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:globalization providing support to populist candidates (Dippel et al. (2015)). 
12:237:18356:0:29:72:543:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Will the current slowing down and possible resetting of globalization mark the beginning of the 
12:238:18452:29:29:72:543:679:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:end of the second era of globalization? That outcome seems unlikely for a number of reasons: 1) 
12:239:18547:29:30:72:543:650:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the growth of international trade is more widespread than pre-1914 and, hence, the groups that 
12:240:18641:30:29:72:542:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:may be harmed are outweighed by those that would benefit ( e.g. shoppers at Walmart). 2) Today 
12:241:18734:29:29:72:542:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:there are more escape valves in trade legislation to reduce trade pressure than in the first era of 
12:242:18834:29:30:72:543:562:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:globalization.  3)  Unlike  in the  pre-1914 era,  trade  disputes can  be  resolved  by  multinational 
12:243:18936:30:29:72:542:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:agencies  such  as  the WTO, which  were  not  present  then. 4)Many  countries  made  progress  in 
12:244:19034:29:29:72:542:503:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:adopting policies  to  help  the  losers  in  the  globalization  game  in  the  form  of  compensation 
12:245:19138:29:30:72:542:474:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:packages and retraining schemes. Although they obviously have not been enough to prevent a 
12:246:19229:30:29:72:542:444:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:backlash. 5) Most  countries  in  recent  years  have  learned  to  pursue  stable  macroeconomic 
12:247:19326:29:29:72:542:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:policies.  This  is  in  sharp  contrast  to  the  unstable  macroeconomic  environment  that  led  to  the 
12:248:19434:29:30:72:543:386:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:shutting down of the capital markets in the 1930s. Indeed, the lessons of the Great Depression 
12:249:19528:30:29:72:542:356:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:have been well learned by the Federal Reserve and other central banks in 2007-2008 to prevent 
12:250:19622:29:29:72:542:327:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a repeat of the global financial meltdown that had occurred in 1931. 6) The global proliferation 
12:251:19719:29:29:72:542:298:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of large multinational enterprises and financial entities is very different from pre-1914. The cost 
12:252:19819:29:30:72:542:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of  unraveling  this  seamless  web  of  interconnections  with  tariffs  and  other  trade  impediments 
12:253:19924:30:29:72:175:239:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:would be disastrous. 
12:254:19944:29:29:72:542:210:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:On the other hand, Rodrik (2013) has posited that there is a conflict between globalization and 
12:255:20038:29:30:72:543:181:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sovereignty.  His  political  economy  trilemma  between  hyper globalization (the  Washington 
12:256:20131:30:29:72:542:151:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Consensus), democracy and the nation state points out the tradeoffs that define the globalization 
12:257:20229:29:29:72:485:122:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:debate. The form of globalization we end up with may very well reflect these forces.

13:260:20314:29:29:54:129:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:C:4. Conclusion 
13:261:20326:29:30:72:542:650:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The  prediction  for  the  future  of  globalization  depends  heavily  on  the  direction  of  the  political 
13:262:20437:30:29:72:542:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:forces at play in the world today. Negative political shocks like the election of Donald Trump and 
13:263:20536:29:29:72:542:591:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Brexit may reduce the growth of trade. But positive shocks like the recent French elections may 
13:264:20632:29:30:72:542:562:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reverse  these  forces.  The  increased  regulation  of  the  financial  system  may  throw  sand  in  the 
13:265:20739:30:29:72:542:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:wheels of financial globalization and the anti-immigrant sentiment in many countries may slow 
13:266:20833:29:29:72:194:503:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the growth of migration. 
13:267:20857:29:30:74:543:474:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B: But  the  real  question  is  whether  these  short-run  forces  will  change  the  long-run  dynamics  of 
13:268:20964:30:29:72:542:444:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:international  capitalism. Millions  of people  have been  lifted from poverty  in  the  second era of 
13:269:21067:29:29:72:542:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:globalization and millions of others have had significant increases in their living standards. The 
13:270:21166:29:30:72:391:386:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:losers from globalization are a vocal minority, but still a minority. 
13:271:21234:30:29:72:542:356:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The  bottom  line is  that the  second  era  of  globalization  is  not  ending.  It  is  going  through a  rest 
13:272:21347:29:29:72:542:327:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:following the Global Financial Crises and the Great Recession and the inevitable political reaction
