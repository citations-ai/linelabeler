5:108:3883:22:25:87:166:688:121:Helvetica:121:Helvetica:1. Introduction 
5:109:3899:25:15:123:529:663:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:Impact  evaluation  of  a  program  provides  very  helpful  information  for  decisions  as  to  
5:110:3997:15:15:87:529:648:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:whether  the  program  should  be  terminated  or  expanded.  If  a  program  has  no  impact  on  its  
5:111:4101:15:15:87:527:633:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:participants, it needs to be terminated or modified. Impact of a program on a subject is defined as 
5:112:4201:15:15:87:529:618:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:the  difference  between  its  outcome  with  the  program  and  its  outcome  without  the  program.  
5:113:4304:15:15:87:527:603:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:However, for participants of the program, we can observe only their outcome in the program state, 
5:114:4402:15:16:87:527:588:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:but  not  their  outcome  if  they  had  not  participated  in  the  program.  Similarly,  for  non-participants  
5:115:4516:16:15:87:528:572:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:we  can  observe  their  outcome  in  the  no-program  state,  but  not  the  outcome  in  the  program  state.  
5:116:4629:15:15:87:527:557:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:Outcomes that cannot be observed are called counterfactual. This problem is sometimes referred as 
5:117:4727:15:15:87:528:542:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:a  missing  data  problem,  which  causes  the  impact  evaluation  become  difficult.  Although  it  is  
5:118:4833:15:15:87:528:527:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:impossible  to  measure  the  program  impact  for  each  subject  (Heckman,  et  al.,  1999),  we  can  
5:119:4938:15:16:87:527:512:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:estimate  an  average  of  impact  for  a  group  of  subjects.  The  main  task  is  to  estimate  the  average  
5:120:5052:16:15:87:526:496:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:counterfactual outcomes. Bias in impact estimation is difference between counterfactual outcomes 
5:121:5149:15:15:87:529:481:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:and  their  estimate.  These  biases  can  arise  if  there  are  concurrent  factors  that  can  affect  the  
5:122:5260:15:15:87:527:466:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:outcomes of participants and non-participants, and we are unable to net out impact of these factors 
5:123:5360:15:25:87:195:451:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:from program impact.    
5:124:5384:25:15:123:529:426:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:This  paper  presents  an  overview  of  several  widely-used  methods  in  program  impact  
5:125:5477:15:15:87:529:411:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:evaluation.  In  addition  to  a  randomization-based  method  in  which  participants  are  selected  
5:126:5580:15:15:87:528:396:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:randomly,  these  methods  are  categorized  into:  (1)  methods  assuming  “selection  on  observable”,  
5:127:5686:15:16:87:526:381:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:and (2) methods assuming “selection on unobservable”. If impact of factors that can affect subjects 
5:128:5786:16:15:87:529:365:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:is  correlated  with  impact  of  a  program  of  interest,  we  need  to  separate  the  program  impact.

5:130:6000:15:15:87:528:335:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:correlated  factors.  In  contrast,  if  we  are  not  able  to  observe  all  the  correlated  factors,  we  need  to

5:132:6217:15:16:87:530:305:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:assumptions   and   estimation   strategy.   Identification   assumptions   are   presented   in   a   unified

5:135:6548:15:15:87:528:259:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:doing  so,  the  paper  aims  to  present  the  impact  evaluation  methods  in  a  consistent  framework  of

5:137:6748:25:15:123:527:219:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:The  paper  is  structured  into  seven  sections.  Section  2  states  problems  in  program  impact  
5:138:6851:15:15:87:529:204:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:evaluation  including  definition  and  difficulties  in  measuring  the  program  impact.  Section  3  
5:139:6955:15:15:87:526:189:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:illustrates how a method that is based on random selection solves these problems. Next, sections 4 
5:140:7054:15:16:87:527:174:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:and 5 introduce methods relying on selection of observables, and methods relying on selection of 
5:141:7151:16:15:87:527:158:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:unobservable, respectively. Section 6 illustrates the methods using simulated data. Finally, section 
5:142:7252:15:25:87:231:143:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:7 presents some conclusions.

5:145:7386:25:15:123:527:69:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:The main objective of impact evaluation of a program is to assess the extent to which the 
5:146:7476:15:0:87:526:54:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:program has changed outcomes for subjects. In other words, impact of the program on the subjects 
6:147:7574:0:15:87:528:710:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:is  measured  by  the  change  in  welfare  outcome  that  is  attributed  only  to  the  program.  In  the  
6:148:7683:15:15:87:530:695:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:literature  on  impact  evaluation,  a  broader  term  “treatment”  is  sometimes  used  instead  of  
6:149:7785:15:25:87:387:680:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:program/project to refer to intervention whose impact is evaluated.  
6:150:7854:25:15:123:526:655:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:To make the definition of impact evaluation more explicit, suppose that there is a program 
6:151:7945:15:15:87:529:640:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:assigned  to  some  people  in  a  population  P.  For  simplicity,  let’s  assume  that  there  is  a  single  
6:152:8057:15:15:87:527:625:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:program, and denote by D the binary variable of participation in the program, i.e.  if she/he 
6:153:8151:15:16:87:527:610:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:participates in the program, and  otherwise. D is also called the variable of treatment status. 
6:154:8247:16:16:87:528:594:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:Further  let  Y  denote  the  observed  value  of  the  outcome.  This  variable  can  receive  two  values  
6:155:8356:16:0:87:300:578:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:depending  on  the  participation  variable,  i.e.  
6:156:8408:0:15:476:465:625:126:g_d0_f10:126:Times:1=D
6:157:8411:15:35:253:242:610:119:g_d0_f10:119:Times:0=D
6:158:8414:35:0:325:465:575:51:g_d0_f10:119:Times:1YY=  if  1=D,  and  0YY=  if  .0=D
6:159:8449:0:23:487:532:583:49:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:4  These    
6:160:8461:23:25:87:507:560:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:outcomes are considered at a point or over a period of time after the program is implemented.   
6:161:8557:25:28:123:436:535:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:The impact of the program on the outcome of person i is measured by: 
6:162:8626:28:25:139:555:507:51:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:01iiiYY−=Δ.          (2.1)  
6:163:8654:25:15:87:527:482:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:It  is  equal  to  the  difference  in  the  outcome  between  the  program  state  and  the  no-program  state.  
6:164:8768:15:15:87:526:467:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:The problem is that we cannot observe both terms in equation (2.1) for the same person. For those 
6:165:8866:15:16:87:527:452:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:who participated in the program, we can observe only Y1, and for those who did not participate in 
6:166:8964:16:24:87:526:436:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:the program we can observe only Y0. Outcomes that cannot be observed are called counterfactual.   
6:167:9062:24:15:123:527:412:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:It  is  practically  impossible  to  estimate  the  program  impact  for  each  person  (Heckman,  et  
6:168:9165:15:16:87:528:397:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:al.,  1999),  because  we  cannot  know  exactly  the  counterfactual  outcome.  If  we  do  construct  an  
6:169:9273:16:15:87:526:381:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:estimator for individual effects, the associated standard error would be very large. In fact, program 
6:170:9375:15:15:87:526:366:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:impact can be estimated for a group of people. In the literature on program impact evaluation, two 
6:171:9474:15:15:87:527:351:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:popular parameters are the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), and the Average Treatment Effect on 
6:172:9569:15:25:87:186:336:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:the Treated (ATT) 5.   
6:173:9591:25:15:123:528:311:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:ATT  is  the  expected  impact  of  the  program  on  a  person  who  is  randomly  selected  and  
6:174:9690:15:26:87:268:296:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:assigned to the program. It is defined as:

7:190:10853:15:15:87:527:652:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:makers would be interested in expanding the program for similar groups. The expected treatment

8:256:14074:24:15:123:527:269:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:As mentioned, the selection of a method to estimate ATE and ATT for a program depends 
8:257:14160:15:16:87:527:254:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:crucially on assumptions on how people are selected in the program as well as how the potential 
8:258:14256:16:15:87:528:238:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:outcomes  are  affected  by  the  program  and  other  factors.  Although  assumptions  are  often  not  
8:259:14361:15:15:87:526:223:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:tested, they need to be stated explicitly so that one can know when impact evaluation results using 
8:260:14461:15:15:87:527:208:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:a  method  are  valid  and  robust.  A  popular  way  to  discuss  assumptions  on  the  program  in  impact  
8:261:14571:15:15:87:527:193:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:evaluation  is  to  use  a  model  of  two  outcome  equations  of  Roy  (1951)  or  Rubin  (1974),  in  which  
8:262:14683:15:16:87:526:178:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:potential outcomes Y0 and Y1 are expressed as functions of individual characteristics (conditioning

9:268:14956:0:15:87:527:710:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:Y0 and Y1 can be any functions of X, not necessarily linearly or parametrically specified, and all

9:271:15270:15:15:87:527:665:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:writing this two equation model is to discuss assumptions that different methods rely on in terms

9:273:15422:25:15:87:527:625:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:For simplicity and identification of program impact in some parametric regressions, we require X

9:277:15708:16:15:87:528:541:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:of  program  impact  evaluation.  The  first  assumption  is  common  in  partial  equilibrium  approach,  
9:278:15815:15:15:87:527:526:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:and  required  in  the  literature  on  program  impact  evaluation.  This  assumption  is  called  the  stable  
9:279:15928:15:26:87:256:511:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:unit treatment assumption (SUTVA).

9:282:16135:24:16:87:528:441:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:This  assumption  implies  that  there  is  no  spill-over  effect  of  the  program.  In  other  words,  an  
9:283:16245:16:15:87:529:425:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:individual’s  participation  in  the  program  does  not  affect  the  outcome  of  other  people.  For  
9:284:16350:15:15:87:529:410:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:programs  that  cover  a  large  proportion  of  population,  this  assumption  can  be  violated.  For  
9:285:16455:15:15:87:527:395:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:example, if a large number of farmers receive preferential credit, they can reduce production costs

9:289:16784:25:15:123:529:325:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:The  second  assumption  is  implied  in  the  two  equation  model.  Writing  the  same  X

9:294:17166:27:15:87:527:226:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:The  assumption  does  not  mean  that  X  is  uncorrelated  with  D,  but  means  that  X  is  uncorrelated

9:296:17373:15:16:87:527:196:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:on the potential outcomes. Although this assumption is not an indispensable condition to identify 
9:297:17471:16:15:87:526:180:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:the program impact, it is maintained for simplicity. If D affects X, it will be much more complex 
9:298:17569:15:15:87:528:165:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:to  capture  truly  the  impact  of  program.  The  program  impact  on  the  outcome  can  go  through  the  
9:299:17679:15:15:87:526:150:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:conditioning variables, and we need to model the program impact on X to get the overall impact of

10:345:19520:15:15:87:529:357:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:It  is  worth  noting  that  assumption  (A.2.4)  does  not  mean  the  expectation  of  the  error  terms

11:385:21201:28:15:123:527:566:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:To complete this section, a model of program participation is introduced. The participation 
11:386:21293:15:15:87:527:551:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:of a person in the program can depend on selection criteria of the program and own decisions of 
11:387:21389:15:28:87:496:536:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:the person. The program participation model is often expressed in a latent index framework: 
11:388:21481:28:28:140:546:508:127:Times:121:g_d0_f10:vWD*+=θ,          (2.21) 
11:389:21506:28:28:151:165:480:127:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:01>=D if D*,

11:391:21534:25:15:87:527:427:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:where D* is the latent index of the program selection that is correlated with observable variables,

11:394:21766:24:25:87:273:372:121:Times:121:Times:2.3. Determinations of program impact 
11:395:21804:25:15:123:527:347:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:The  objective  of  the  impact  evaluation  of  a  program  is  to  measure  the  size  of  program  
11:396:21906:15:16:87:529:332:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:impact  on  outcome.  The  magnitude  of  a  program  impact  on  a  subject’s  outcome  is  given  in  
11:397:22010:16:28:87:157:316:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:equation (2.1):

11:399:22039:25:15:87:526:263:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:This realized magnitude depends on many factors, but in general these factors can be grouped into 
11:400:22137:15:15:87:527:248:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:3 groups: intervention of the program, time to conduct program evaluation, and the characteristics 
11:401:22236:15:25:87:160:233:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:of the subject i.  
11:402:22255:25:15:123:528:208:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:Obviously,  magnitude  of  program  impact  depends  on  what  the  program  offers  to  the  
11:403:22349:15:15:87:527:193:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:subject. Any change in the design of intervention can lead to a change in the program impact. For 
11:404:22447:15:15:87:527:178:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:example,  a  vocational  training  provides  courses  in  two  ways:  courses  in  morning  and  course  in  
11:405:22556:15:16:87:526:163:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:evening. For a given person, the impact of participating in morning courses can be higher than the 
11:406:22655:16:15:87:526:147:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:impact of participating in evening courses, since her learning ability is better in mornings. Another 
11:407:22757:15:15:87:526:132:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:example is a program of micro-credit that provides a small amount of credit for a targeted group of 
11:408:22857:15:15:87:527:117:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:people. Eligible people, who meet the conditions for borrowing, can receive two specific amounts 
11:409:22954:15:15:87:528:102:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:of  credit,  say  C1  and  C2,  depending  on  their  demand  for  credit.  It  is  obvious  that  impact  of  
11:410:23065:15:16:87:529:87:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:receiving  C1 credit  is  different  from  impact  of  receiving  C2  credit.  It  should  be  noted  that  a  
11:411:23176:16:15:87:529:71:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:program  that  provides  different  designs  of  intervention  is  sometimes  understood  as  different  
11:412:23281:15:0:87:528:56:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:mutually exclusive programs. For the example of the micro-credit program, a person would have 
12:413:23376:0:19:87:528:709:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:three  potential  outcomes    that  correspond  to  the  state  of  no  credit,  the  state  of  
12:414:23473:19:0:87:139:690:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:receiving  C

12:416:23499:21:14:140:528:688:50:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:1  credit,  and  the  state  of  receiving  C2  credit,  respectively.  In  this  case,  impact  of  the  
12:417:23605:14:15:87:528:674:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:program on a person’s outcome needs to be defined explicitly as impact of receiving C1 credit or 
12:418:23702:15:25:87:223:659:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:impact of receiving C2 credit.  
12:419:23734:25:15:123:528:634:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:The  second  factor  that  affects  the  measured  impact  of  a  program  is  when  the  data  on  
12:420:23834:15:15:87:530:619:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:outcome   are   collected11.   The   definition   of   potential   outcomes   is   made   after   the   program   
12:421:23948:15:16:87:527:604:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:implementation. Suppose that the program started at time t = 0. After that, the potential outcomes 
12:422:24047:16:31:87:307:588:121:g_d0_f10:127:g_d0_f10:for a subject i at any point of time t (t>0) are, and the program impact is: t1it0iY,Y
12:423:24133:31:25:155:167:557:51:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:t0it1iitYY−=Δ.  
12:424:24149:25:15:87:527:532:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:The impact is now a function of t, thereby depending on time t. The result from impact evaluation 
12:425:24247:15:15:87:528:517:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:conducted  one  year  after  program  implementation  can  be  different  from  the  results  of  impact  
12:426:24353:15:15:87:528:502:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:evaluation  conducted  two  years  after  implementation.  It  is  possible  to  assume  that  the  program  
12:427:24462:15:16:87:527:487:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:impact  can  be  stable  after  a  period  of  time,  i.e.,  the  program  can  move  the  outcome  level  (in  the  
12:428:24579:16:15:87:528:471:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:no-program  state)  to  a  new  level  of  outcome  (in  the  program  state)  in  the  long  term.  In  the  
12:429:24689:15:25:87:443:456:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:literature on impact evaluation, the argument “t” is often dropped for simplicity. 
12:430:24772:25:15:123:529:431:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:Thirdly,  the  impact  of  a  program  on  a  subject  depends  on  her  own  characteristics.  
12:431:24868:15:15:87:528:416:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:Different  people  will  gain  different  benefits  from  a  program.  If  the  two  equations  of  potential  
12:432:24979:15:16:87:526:401:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:outcomes (2.15) and (2.16) are used, program impact can be expressed as a function of observable 
12:433:25076:16:26:87:312:385:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:and unobservable variables, X and ε, respectively:

12:435:25178:28:16:87:528:331:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:Unless  two  subjects  have  the  same  characteristics,  i.e.,  the  X  variables  and  ε  in  the  potential  
12:436:25290:16:24:87:371:315:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:outcome equations, the program impact differs between them.

12:438:25441:16:15:87:527:275:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:case  of  ATT,  its  magnitude  depends  on  characteristics  of  subjects  who  actually  take  part  in  the

13:481:27319:24:16:87:527:336:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:The program impact is estimated simply by comparing the mean outcome between the participants

15:575:32135:26:15:123:527:317:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:As a result, (3.10) is the unbiased estimator of ATT(X) and ATE(X). We simple calculate the 
15:576:32227:15:15:87:528:302:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:difference  in  the  mean  outcome  between  the  participants  and  non-participants  of  the  program

15:578:32434:15:25:87:424:272:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:conditional parameters are also identified because of (2.13) and (2.14).         
15:579:32515:25:25:87:437:247:121:Times:121:Times:3.3. Advantages and disadvantages of the method based on randomization 
15:580:32586:25:15:123:527:222:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:There  is  no  controversy  that  among  methods  of  program  impact  evaluation,  the  method  
15:581:32683:15:15:87:529:207:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:that  is  based  on  randomization  of  the  program  produces  the  most  reliable  results.  When  the  
15:582:32789:15:15:87:527:192:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:randomization of a program is properly conducted, the average impact of the program is identified 
15:583:32887:15:15:87:530:177:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:without  any  further  assumptions.  The  randomization  of  programs  ensures  that  there  is  no  
15:584:32988:15:16:87:528:162:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:systematic  difference  in  both  observable  and  unobservable  characteristics  between  treatment  and  
15:585:33095:16:15:87:528:146:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:control  groups.  As  a  result,  any  difference  in  the  average  outcome  between  these  groups  can  be  
15:586:33206:15:15:87:526:131:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:attributed to the program effect. The estimation of the program is also very simple given available 
15:587:33306:15:15:87:528:116:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:data  on  the  control  and  treatment  groups.  An  another  advantage  of  the  method  is  the  easiness  in  
15:588:33419:15:25:87:528:101:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:explaining  its  results  of  impact  evaluation  to  program  designers  and  policy  makers,  who  often  
15:589:33527:25:12:87:527:76:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:                                                                                                                                                                
15:590:33686:12:11:87:527:64:100:g_d0_f10:100:g_d0_f10:However  this  assumption  is  difficult  to  interpreter.  Thus  we  mention  the  assumption  (A.3.2)  in  discussing  
15:591:33807:11:0:87:252:53:100:g_d0_f10:100:g_d0_f10:the identification of the program impact. 
16:592:33851:0:15:87:529:710:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:have  not  much  knowledge  on  statistics  and  econometrics.  The  idea  of  the  method  is  very  
16:593:33953:15:15:87:528:695:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:straightforward.  Once  policymakers  understand  the  method,  they  will  believe  the  results  of  the  
16:594:34061:15:15:87:526:680:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:impact evaluation. Meanwhile, it is much more difficult for them to understand other methods that 
16:595:34159:15:15:87:528:665:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:rely  on  complicated  mathematics.  The  difficulty  can  lead  them  to  doubt  the  results  of  impact  
16:596:34267:15:25:87:152:650:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:evaluation.      
16:597:34284:25:15:123:528:625:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:The  method  based  on  randomized  program,  however,  suffers  from  several  drawbacks.  
16:598:34376:15:15:87:527:610:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:Firstly, it is hardly to randomize a program which is targeted at a specific group due to issues of 
16:599:34476:15:16:87:526:595:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:ethics and politics. Randomization of a program means exclusion of some eligible people from the 
16:600:34573:16:15:87:527:579:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:program.  It  is  unfair  to  deny  (or  delay)  a  program  that  provides  supports  such  as  health  care  or  
16:601:34688:15:15:87:527:564:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:education  for  some  eligible  people.  Policy  makers  will  be  criticized  if  they  cannot  explain  why  
16:602:34799:15:15:87:527:549:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:some  eligible  people  are  not  allowed  to  participate  in  programs.  Nevertheless,  the  randomization  
16:603:34909:15:15:87:527:534:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:of  a  program  can  be  conducted  if  the  fund  for  the  program  is  not  sufficient  to  cover  all  eligible  
16:604:35026:15:15:87:527:519:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:people.  Some  people  have  to  participate  in  later  periods,  and  they  can  serve  as  the  control  group  
16:605:35141:15:25:87:281:504:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:for those who participate at the beginning.   
16:606:35187:25:15:123:528:479:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:Secondly,  the  implementation  of  impact  evaluation  of  a  socioeconomic  program  that  is  
16:607:35284:15:16:87:527:464:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:based on randomization design is often expensive. Subjects are scattered in the population, which 
16:608:35382:16:24:87:487:448:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:increases the cost of program administration and data collection for impact evaluation.       
16:609:35476:24:16:123:527:424:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:Thirdly,  there  can  be  some  factors  in  addition  to  the  program  that  might  bias  estimates  
16:610:35579:16:16:87:529:408:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:from  the  randomization-based  evaluation.  These  factors  can  invalidate  the  key  identification  
16:611:35683:16:18:87:530:392:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:assumption  (A.3.1),  .  Two  problems  that  are  widely  mentioned  in  a  randomized  
16:612:35772:18:15:87:527:374:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:program  are  attrition  and  substitution  effects.  Attrition  means  that  some  people  in  the  treatment  
16:613:35884:15:15:87:528:359:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:group  quit  the  program  during  implementation.  As  a  result,  their  observed  outcome  is  not  the  
16:614:35992:15:0:87:333:344:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:potential  outcome  in  the  presence  of  the  program,  Y
16:615:36051:0:46:225:205:389:51:g_d0_f10:127:g_d0_f12:10Y,YD⊥
16:616:36058:46:14:333:528:343:50:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:1.  If  this  drop-out  is  random,  there  is  no  
16:617:36110:14:15:87:527:329:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:concern about this problem since the randomization feature remains preserved.14 If the attrition is 
16:618:36210:15:15:87:526:314:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:not random but correlated with some characteristics of the drop-outs, the remaining subjects in the 
16:619:36310:15:16:87:526:299:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:treatment group who actually take the program will be systematically different from the subjects in 
16:620:36410:16:15:87:529:283:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:the  control  group.  In  other  words,  there  is  self-selection  into  the  program  of  the  participants.  
16:621:36522:15:15:87:530:268:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:Estimation  of  program  impact  is  not  straightforward,  and  alternative  methods  that  will  be  
16:622:36625:15:15:87:529:253:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:discussed  in  next  sections  are  devised  to  deal  with  this  self-selection.  In  this  case,  the  mean  
16:623:36737:15:15:87:526:238:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:difference in outcome between the treatment and control group is not an estimator of the program 
16:624:36834:15:16:87:527:223:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:impact,  but  an  estimator  of  “the  mean  effect  of  the  offer  of  treatment”  (Heckman,  et  al.,  1999).  
16:625:36948:16:15:87:528:207:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:However,  if  we  expect  that  program  impact  is  negligible  for  the  drop-outs,  we  can  measure  the  
16:626:37058:15:15:87:527:192:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:ATE by this mean difference. This is because the drop-outs are not interested in the program, and 
16:627:37156:15:25:87:458:177:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:there would be no impact on them if we force them to follow the whole program.15  
16:628:37238:25:15:123:530:152:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:Substitution  effect  means  that  some  people  in  the  control  group  might  try  to  get  
16:629:37333:15:15:87:526:137:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:substituted programs that are similar to the program to be evaluated. The substituted programs can 
16:630:37432:15:7:87:234:122:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:                                                      
16:631:37485:7:16:87:515:115:42:g_d0_f10:100:g_d0_f10:14 Of course, the remaining subjects in the control group should be statistical representative for the studied 
16:632:37596:16:7:87:142:99:100:g_d0_f10:100:g_d0_f10:population.    
16:633:37611:7:16:87:526:92:42:g_d0_f10:100:g_d0_f10:15 For example, a program that provides households with a certain amount of no-interest credit for a period is 
16:634:37722:16:12:87:527:76:100:g_d0_f10:100:g_d0_f10:carried  out.  For  those  who  refuse  to  receive  credit,  if  we  do  force  them  to  accept  credit  they  can  keep  the  
16:635:37851:12:11:87:527:64:100:g_d0_f10:100:g_d0_f10:credit  unused  and  return  it  at  the  end  of  the  period.  In  this  case,  the  impact  of  program  on  those  people  is  
16:636:37982:11:0:87:117:53:100:g_d0_f10:100:g_d0_f10:zero.    
17:637:37993:0:15:87:528:710:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:contaminate  the  outcome  of  the  control  group.  It  is  implied  that  if  the  program  had  not  been

22:879:50205:25:25:87:363:581:121:Times:121:Times:4.2.3. Advantages and disadvantages of regression method 
22:880:50262:25:15:123:527:556:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:The  above  described  regression  method  has  the  advantage  of  simple  implementation,  but  
22:881:50360:15:15:87:528:541:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:has    with  three  main  drawbacks.  Firstly,  it  imposes  a  specific  functional  form  on  the  relation  
22:882:50471:15:15:87:527:526:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:between outcome and conditioning variables and the program participation variable, e.g., a linear 
22:883:50569:15:15:87:528:511:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:function  in  the  above  illustration.  Secondly,  because  of  the  functional  form,  the  OLS  regression  
22:884:50680:15:16:87:530:496:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:can  have  problems  of  multicollinearity  and  heteroscedasticity,  making  the  estimator  of  the  
22:885:50783:16:15:87:529:480:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:program  impact  inefficient.  This  might  be  the  case,  since  the  conditioning  variables  can  have  
22:886:50891:15:15:87:528:465:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:effect  on  D,  and  the  error  term  can  have  nonconstant  variance.  Finally,  the  method  relies  on  the  
22:887:51005:15:15:87:528:450:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:assumption  of  program  selection  based  on  the  observable  variables.  This  assumption  is  strong  
22:888:51111:15:25:87:507:435:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:unless a rich data set on program selection of participants and non-participants is available.

22:890:51234:25:24:87:242:385:121:Times:121:Times:4.3.1. Identification assumptions 
22:891:51268:24:16:123:527:361:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:There is a large amount of literature on matching methods of impact evaluation. Important 
22:892:51358:16:15:87:529:345:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:contributions  in  this  areas  can  be  found  in  researches  such  as  (Rubin,  1977,  1979,  1980),  
22:893:51463:15:15:87:527:330:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:(Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983, 1985a), and (Heckman, et al., 1997b). The matching method can be 
22:894:51556:15:15:87:531:315:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:used   to   estimate   the   two   program   impact   parameters,   ATE   and   ATT   under   conditional   
22:895:51664:15:15:87:528:300:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:independence  assumption  (A.4.1).  The  basic  idea  of  the  matching  method  is  to  find  a  control  
22:896:51771:15:16:87:528:285:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:group  (also  called  comparison  group)  that  has  the  same  (or  at  least  similar)  distribution  of  X    as  
22:897:51888:16:15:87:529:269:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:the  treatment  group.  By  doing  so,  we  have  controlled  for  the  difference  in  X    between  the  
22:898:51995:15:15:87:527:254:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:participants  and  non-participants.  The  potential  outcomes  of  the  control  and  treatment  group  are  
22:899:52105:15:15:87:527:239:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:now independent of the program selection. The difference in outcome of the control group and the 
22:900:52202:15:15:87:526:224:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:treatment group then can be attributed to the program impact. However for the matching method to 
22:901:52299:15:15:87:527:209:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:be implemented, we must find a control group who is similar to the treatment group but does not 
22:902:52395:15:16:87:528:194:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:participate  in  the  program.  This  assumption  is  called  common  support  in  the  literature  on  the  
22:903:52504:16:15:87:528:178:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:matching  method.  If  we  denote  p(X)  as  the  probability  of  participating  in  the  program  for  each  
22:904:52615:15:27:87:472:163:121:g_d0_f10:49:g_d0_f10:subject, i.e. , this assumption can be stated formally as follows:)X|D(P)X(p1== 19

22:907:52761:7:16:87:517:69:42:g_d0_f10:100:g_d0_f10:19 As mentioned, this assumption is actually required for variables Z (not for all explanatory variables X in 
22:908:52871:16:0:87:478:53:100:g_d0_f10:100:g_d0_f10:the potential outcome equations) on which the conditional independence assumption is satisfied.  
23:909:52970:0:15:123:526:710:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:As compared with the regression method, the method of matching has an advantage that it 
23:910:53058:15:15:87:528:695:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:does  not  require  assumption  (A.2.3)  to  identify  ATE(X)  and  ATT(X),  but  it  also  suffers  from  a  
23:911:53168:15:25:87:316:680:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:disadvantage of the common support requirement.

23:914:53354:25:25:87:456:615:121:Times:121:g_d0_f10:Proof: the proof is straightforward using the conditional independence assumption.

23:917:53598:15:15:87:526:545:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:participants and non-participants whose values of X  are the same so that we are able to use sample 
23:918:53698:15:25:87:227:530:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:information to estimate (4.24).  
23:919:53731:25:25:87:329:505:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:ATE and ATT are identified as in (2.13) and (2.14).■

23:922:53856:24:16:123:527:431:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:To  implement  the  matching  method,  we  need  to  find  a  comparison  group  who  variables

24:1091:56817:25:15:123:527:241:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:Clearly, matched non-participants should have X that is closest to X  of participants. There 
24:1092:56910:15:15:87:528:226:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:will  be  no  problem  if  there  is  a  single  conditioning  variable  X.  However  X  is  often  a  vector  of  
24:1093:57025:15:15:87:527:211:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:variables,  and  finding  “close”  non-participants  to  match  with  a  participant  is  not  straightforward.  
24:1094:57138:15:15:87:524:196:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:In  the  literature  on  impact  evaluation,  there  are  three  widely-used  methods  to  find  matched  non-
24:1095:57248:15:25:87:480:181:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:participants for a participant (and vice versa matched participants for a non-participant).  
24:1096:57341:25:15:123:529:156:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:The first method is called subclassification of the treatment and control group based on X  
24:1097:57433:15:15:87:526:141:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:(see, e.g., Cochran and Chambers, 1965; Cochran, 1968). All participants and non-participants will 
24:1098:57532:15:16:87:528:126:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:be  classified  into  blocks  according  to  the  value  of  X.  It  means  that  subjects  in  a  block  have  the  
24:1099:57649:16:15:87:527:110:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:same value of X. Then non-participants will be matched with participants in each block. However 
24:1100:57745:15:15:87:526:95:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:the subclassification becomes difficult when there are many variables X or when some variables of 
24:1101:57843:15:0:87:303:80:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:X  are continuous or discrete with many values.  
25:1102:57894:0:15:123:523:710:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:The  second  method  is  called  covariate  matching  which  matches  participants  with  non-
25:1103:57988:15:15:87:528:695:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:participants  based  on  their  distance  of  variables  defined  on  some  metric  (Rubin,  1979,  1980).  
25:1104:58096:15:15:87:527:680:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:Since  X  can  be  considered  as  a  vector  in  a  space,  the  closeness  between  two  sets  of  X    can  be  
25:1105:58211:15:15:87:526:665:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:defined by a distance metric. A non-participant j will be matched with a participant i if the distance 
25:1106:58314:15:15:87:527:650:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:from  Xj  to  Xi  is  smallest  as  compared  with  other  non-participants.  A  quickly  emerging  metric  in  
25:1107:58426:15:30:87:269:635:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:space is the traditional Euclidean metric:

25:1109:58514:30:16:87:527:575:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:However  this  metric  is  sensitive  to  the  measure  unit  of  X  .  To  get  an  unit-free  metric  distance,  a  
25:1110:58632:16:15:87:527:559:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:natural way is to standardize the Euclidean metric by multiplying it with the inversed covariance 
25:1111:58730:15:15:87:527:544:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:matrix of X to get the Mahalanobis metric20 (Rubin, 1979, 1980) or the inversed variance matrix 
25:1112:58826:15:30:87:236:529:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:of X (Abadie and Imbens, 2002):

25:1116:59020:25:15:123:527:408:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:The third way to find the matched sample is the propensity score matching. Since a paper 
25:1117:59109:15:15:87:527:393:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:by  Rosenbaum  and  Rubin  (1983),  matching  is  often  conducted  based  on  the  probability  of  being  
25:1118:59217:15:15:87:527:378:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:assigned to the program, which is called the propensity score. Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) show 
25:1119:59312:15:15:87:527:363:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:that if the potential outcomes are independent of the program assignment given X , then they are 
25:1120:59409:15:16:87:528:348:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:also  independent  of  the  program  assignment  given  the  balance  score.  The  balance  score  is  any  
25:1121:59517:16:15:87:523:332:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:function of X but finer than p(X), which is the probability of participating in the program (the so-

26:1188:62338:15:15:87:528:199:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:matches.  This  is  one  nearest  neighbor  matching.  When  there  are  more  than  one  non-participants  
26:1189:62446:15:15:87:527:184:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:who  are  matched  with  one  participant  (or  vice  versa), we need some ways to define weights that 
26:1190:62549:15:25:87:252:169:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:are attached to each non-participant.  
26:1191:62588:25:15:123:528:144:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:The  n-nearest  neighbor  matching  is  to  match  each  participant  with  n  non-participants  
26:1192:62685:15:16:87:527:129:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:whose have closest distances d(i,j). Each matched non-participant will receive an equal weight, i.e. 
26:1193:62786:16:17:145:528:113:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:.  Another  version  of  equal  weights  can  be  caliper  matching  (see,  e.g.,  Dehejia  and  
26:1194:62883:17:15:87:526:96:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:Wahba, 1998; Smith and Todd, 2005), which allows for the matching between two subjects if their 
26:1195:62979:15:16:87:527:81:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:distance d(i,j) is smaller than a specific value, say 0.05 or 0.1. This is aimed to ensure the quality 
26:1196:63082:16:0:87:527:65:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:of  matched  subjects.  Stratification  (interval)  matching  also  shares  this  feature  (see,  e.g.,  Dehejia  
26:1197:63196:0:0:137:125:113:120:g_d0_f10:120:g_d0_f12:n/1)j,i(w=

27:1199:63306:15:15:87:523:695:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:strata  (blocks)  of  equal  ranges.  Within  each  stratum,  a  participant  is  matched  with  all  non-
27:1200:63412:15:25:87:246:680:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:participants with equal weights.       
27:1201:63451:25:15:123:527:655:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:However,  it  would  be  reasonable  to  assign  different  weights  to  different  non-participants  
27:1202:63553:15:15:87:530:640:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:depending  on  metric  distances  between  their  covariates  and  the  covariates  of  the  matched  
27:1203:63655:15:15:87:527:625:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:participant.  This  argument  motivates  some  others  matching  schemes  such  as  kernel,  local  linear  
27:1204:63763:15:15:87:527:610:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:matching (see, e.g., Heckman, et al., 1997b; Smith and Todd, 2005), and matching using weights

27:1228:64171:53:17:87:531:453:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:Kernel  matching  can  be  explained  as  kernel  (non-parametric)  estimation  of  counterfactual

28:1356:65471:37:24:87:358:545:121:Times:121:Times:4.3.3. Advantages and disadvantages of matching method 
28:1357:65526:24:16:123:526:521:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:The main advantage of the matching method is that it does not rely on a specific function 
28:1358:65616:16:15:87:527:505:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:form of the outcome, thereby avoiding assumptions on functional form, e.g., linearity imposition, 
28:1359:65714:15:15:87:526:490:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:multicollinearity and heteroscedasticity issues. Compared with the linear regression, the matching 
28:1360:65813:15:15:87:526:475:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:method does not require assumption (A.2.1) on exogeneity of X. In addition, the matching method 
28:1361:65909:15:15:87:528:460:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:emphasizes  the  problem  of  common  support,  thereby  avoiding  the  bias  due  to  extrapolation  to  
28:1362:66015:15:15:87:527:445:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:non-data region. Results from the matching method are easy to explain to policy makers, since the 
28:1363:66113:15:25:87:327:430:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:idea of comparison of similar group is quite intuitive.  
28:1364:66170:25:15:123:529:405:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:However,  the  matching  method  has  several  limitations.  It  relies  on  the  assumption  of  
28:1365:66268:15:16:87:529:390:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:conditional  mean  independence.  It  also  requires  the  assumption  of  common  support.  If  this  
28:1366:66371:16:15:87:529:374:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:assumption  does  not  hold,  one  can  use  a  method  of  regression  discontinuity,  which  will  be  
28:1367:66476:15:15:87:528:359:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:discussed  in  the  next  section.  Finally,  the  matching  estimators  can  work  very  poorly  in  small  
28:1368:66585:15:15:87:527:344:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:samples if the quality of matches is not good, i.e., participants are matched with non-participants 
28:1369:66685:15:25:87:321:329:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:who have very different conditioning variables X.21

28:1371:66769:25:15:123:527:279:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:For  the  matching  method,  the  assumption  on  the  common  support  is  required  to  identify  
28:1372:66869:15:15:87:524:264:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:the  program  impacts.  When  the  conditioning  variables  X  are  different  for  participants  and  non-
28:1373:66976:15:15:87:527:249:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:participants, we cannot implement matching methods. In other words, if there are some variables 
28:1374:67072:15:15:87:527:234:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:X  that  predict  the  treatment  variable  D  perfectly,  the  assumption  of  common  support  no  longer  
28:1375:67181:15:17:87:527:219:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:holds. In Van der Klaauw (2002), it means that there is a conditioning variable S belonging to X 
28:1376:67278:17:16:87:527:202:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:such  that  D  equals  1  if  and  only  if  S  is  larger  than  a  specific  value  S.22  The  assignment  of  the  
28:1377:67396:16:18:87:527:186:121:g_d0_f10:121:g_d0_f10:program is called deterministic. To make this assumption consistent with notation in this paper, we

34:1703:80174:25:24:87:416:615:121:Times:121:Times:5.1.4. Advantages and disadvantages of instrumental variable method 
34:1704:80242:24:16:123:527:591:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:The main advantage of the instrumental variable method is that it allows for the program 
34:1705:80331:16:15:87:528:575:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:selection  based  on  unobservable.  In  addition,  LATE  can  be  identified  by  this  method  under  very  
34:1706:80441:15:15:87:530:560:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:general  conditions.  However,  the  main  problem  in  this  method  is  to  find  good  instrumental  
34:1707:80545:15:15:87:530:545:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:variables.  A  variable  that  is  correlated  with  the  program  selection  is  often  correlated  with  
34:1708:80652:15:15:87:529:530:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:outcomes  and  error  terms  in  the  potential  outcome  equations.  Using  an  invalid  instrumental  
34:1709:80756:15:15:87:530:515:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:variable  that  does  not  satisfy  the  instrument  conditions  will  lead  to  biased  and  inconsistent

34:1711:80980:16:15:87:527:484:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:can be very weakly correlated with the program selection. Estimation with weak instruments can 
34:1712:81075:15:15:87:528:469:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:have  large  standard  errors  in  small  samples.  In  addition,  explanation  of  this  method  to  policy  
34:1713:81185:15:25:87:225:454:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:makers is not straightforward.

34:1716:81283:24:16:123:527:380:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:Impacts of a program can be identified using a sample selection model (Heckman, 1978). 
34:1717:81370:16:15:87:527:364:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:Recall that we cannot run regression of the potential outcomes using sample data in the presence 
34:1718:81467:15:15:87:527:349:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:of the selection bias because of the non-random missing data. For example, in the equation of Y0 
34:1719:81563:15:15:87:528:334:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:there  is  no  data  on  the  dependent  variable  for  those  who  participated  in  the  program.  This  is  
34:1720:81674:15:15:87:527:319:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:similar to the case of the censored dependent variable model, in which the dependent variables is 
34:1721:81772:15:15:87:528:304:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:censored  according  a  selection  mechanism.  Under  assumptions  on  distribution  between  the  error

34:1723:81987:16:24:87:375:273:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:estimate coefficients in the potential outcomes without any bias.

36:1923:86047:15:16:87:527:247:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:selection method is that it allows for selection of a program based on unobservable. In addition, it

40:2146:94961:15:15:87:528:155:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:(A.5.6),  all  expectation  terms  include  both  XB  and  XBA,  while  in  the  first  equation  of  (A.5.8)  the  
40:2147:95077:15:25:87:277:140:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:expectation terms include either XBB or XA. 
40:2148:95121:25:25:87:489:115:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:There is no argument for whether assumption (A.5.8) is stronger than (5.33) or vice versa.

41:2167:95491:25:15:87:527:632:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:In implementation, firstly participants are matched to non-participants based on XB to estimate the 
41:2168:95591:15:15:87:529:617:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:difference  in  their  outcome  before  the  program.  Secondly,  after  the  program  participants  are  
41:2169:95697:15:0:87:316:602:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:matched  to  non-participants  again  but  based  on  X

41:2171:95753:32:13:316:528:600:49:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:A  to  estimate  the  difference  in  their  outcome.  
41:2172:95808:13:16:87:527:587:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:Then, the estimate of the program impact ATT(X) is equal to the difference in the estimates before 
41:2173:95907:16:25:87:448:571:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:and after the program. That is why this method is also called double-matching.     
41:2174:95990:25:18:123:526:546:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:Note that the term [])D,X|Y(E)D,X|Y(EAA0100=−= in (A.5.8) is set equal to zero in 
41:2175:96072:18:15:87:528:528:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:conditional  independence  assumption  (A.4.1).  This  is  bias  when  the  conditional  expectation  of  
41:2176:96178:15:15:87:530:513:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:outcome  of  non-participants  is  used  to  predict  the  conditional  expectation  of  outcome  of  
41:2177:96280:15:16:87:523:498:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:participants  if  they  had  not  participated  in  the  program.  Matching  method  using  single  cross-
41:2178:96386:16:15:87:528:482:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:section  data  assumes  this  bias  equal  zero  once  conditional  on  X.  Thus,  the  matching  method  is  
41:2179:96496:15:15:87:528:467:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:more    robust  than  the  matching  method  in  sense  that  it  allows  this  bias  to  differ  from  zero.  
41:2180:96607:15:25:87:316:452:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:However it requires that this bias be time-invariant. 
41:2181:96661:25:15:123:527:427:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:Similarly,  under  the  second  condition  of  (A.5.8),  ANTT(X)  is  identified.  It  is  the  same  as  
41:2182:96767:15:25:87:329:412:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:ATT(X). As a result ATE(X) is also the same as ATT(X).

41:2184:96884:25:15:123:527:362:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:The  main  advantage  of  the  panel  data  methods  is  that  it  allows  for  the  selection  of  the  
41:2185:96989:15:15:87:528:347:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:program  based  on  some  unobservable  variables.  However,  the  methods  have  two  disadvantages.  
41:2186:97092:15:15:87:528:332:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:The  first  is  the  requirement  of  the  data  set.  Panel  data  that  are  collected  before  and  after  the  
41:2187:97207:15:15:87:527:317:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:program  are  not  popular  as  single  cross-section  data.  The  second  is  that  the  methods  require  two  
41:2188:97320:15:15:87:527:302:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:assumptions  to  identify  ATE(X)  and  ATT(X).  The  assumptions  require  that  unobservable  variables  
41:2189:97427:15:16:87:529:287:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:that  affect  the  program  selection  are  unchanged  over  time  and  the  program  statuses.  These  
41:2190:97531:16:15:87:528:271:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:assumptions  might  be  violated  if  the  time  period  between  two  panel  data  sets  is  long  enough  so  
41:2191:97643:15:15:87:527:256:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:that the unobservable variables of subjects are altered. In addition, the unobservable variables can 
41:2192:97744:15:25:87:321:241:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:be changed as the subject participate in the program.

41:2195:97843:19:15:123:527:172:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:This  section  presents  simulation  results  of  measuring  the  ATT  using  the  methods  which  
41:2196:97942:15:15:87:528:157:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:have  been  discussed.  The  simulations  have  three  main  objectives.  Firstly,  they  compare  different  
41:2197:98052:15:15:87:527:142:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:estimators of program impacts in terms of mean-squared-error (MSE) for some simulation designs. 
41:2198:98148:15:15:87:529:127:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:Secondly,  it  examines  biases  in  the  “selection  on  observable”  methods,  i.e.,  regression  and  
41:2199:98253:15:16:87:529:112:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:matching  when  the  assumption  on  the  conditional  independence  no  longer  holds.  Thirdly,  the  
41:2200:98357:16:15:87:528:96:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:simulations  will  investigate  the  role  of  instrumental  variables  in  the  estimation  of  the  program

42:2220:99636:19:15:123:527:379:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:There are two points that should be noted. Firstly, the outcomes are assumed depends on 
42:2221:99724:15:15:87:528:364:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:two  observed  variables  X1  and  X2,  of  which  X1  is  time-invariant,  i.e.,  the  same  variable  X1  is  
42:2222:99836:15:15:87:527:349:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:specified in the outcome equations before and after the program. Secondly, the program selection 
42:2223:99933:15:16:87:527:334:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:depends on three variables X1, X2 and Z, of which Z is uncorrelated with the potential outcomes. 
42:2224:100030:16:19:87:319:318:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:As a result, Z is a valid instrumental variable for D.  
42:2225:100086:19:15:123:527:299:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:The  simulation  is  designed  as  follows.  Firstly,  suppose  that  we  are  able  to  observe  both  
42:2226:100190:15:15:87:527:284:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:variables  X1  and  X2A,  then  the  methods  of  matching  and  regression  will  be  used  to  estimate  the  
42:2227:100302:15:15:87:528:269:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:program  impact.  Secondly,  suppose  that  only  X2A  is  observable,  and  X1  is  omitted  in  program  
42:2228:100409:15:16:87:528:254:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:impact  estimation.  The  methods  that  will  be  used  in  this  case  are  instrumental  variable,  sample

42:2230:100619:15:15:87:527:223:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:regression and matching are still used so that we can examine the selection bias due to the omitted 
42:2231:100719:15:15:87:526:208:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:variable X1. The value of g and k in (6.4) will be changed to investigate the sensitivity of different

42:2235:101013:16:15:87:529:139:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:different  estimators.  Table  1  examines  sensitivity  of  bias  of  the  estimators  of  matching  and

42:2237:101231:15:15:87:527:109:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:instrumental variable and sample selection work as the correlation of Z and D is changed. In each 
42:2238:101329:15:15:87:527:94:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:table, there are three panels corresponding to the values of g and k. In Table 1, k is set equal to 1, 
42:2239:101432:15:16:87:527:79:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:and g is changed from 0.5, to 1 and 2. In Table, g is fixed at 1, while k is changed through 0.5, 1 
42:2240:101532:16:0:87:119:63:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:and 2.  
43:2241:101542:0:15:123:527:710:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:When  both  X1 and  X2  are  used,  the  methods  of  regression  and  matching  are  used.  There  
43:2242:101642:15:15:87:529:695:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:are  two  matching  schemes.  Matching  1  means  the  propensity  score  matching  with  1  nearest  
43:2243:101744:15:15:87:527:680:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:neighbor,  and  matching  2  means  the  propensity  score  matching  with  3  nearest  neighbors.  When  
43:2244:101850:15:15:87:528:665:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:the  variable  X1  is  omitted,  the  methods  of  regression  and  matching  are  still  used  to  examine  the  
43:2245:101964:15:15:87:527:650:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:bias of these methods when the assumption on the conditional independence does not hold. Then, 
43:2246:102059:15:16:87:530:635:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:estimation  results  from  7  estimators  that  do  not  assume  the  conditional  independence  are  
43:2247:102161:16:15:87:528:619:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:presented.  There  is  a  instrumental  variable  estimator  in  which  the  instrument  is  the  variable  Z.  
43:2248:102273:15:15:87:527:604:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:Sample selection 1 is the sample selection method using maximum likelihood estimation without 
43:2249:102367:15:15:87:527:589:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:the  variable  Z.  Sample  selection  2  is  the  maximum  likelihood  estimator  with  the  variable  Z,  and  
43:2250:102479:15:15:87:527:574:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:sample selection 3 is the two-stage estimator with the variable Z. There are three estimators using 
43:2251:102579:15:15:87:527:559:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:panel data. First-difference is the linear regression using the differenced data. Diff-in-diff 1 means 
43:2252:102682:15:16:87:526:544:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:the difference-in-difference with propensity score matching using 1 nearest neighbors. Diff-in-diff 
43:2253:102782:16:19:87:512:528:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:2 means the difference-in-difference with propensity score matching using 3 nearest neighbors.  
43:2254:102878:19:15:123:526:509:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:It is showed in Tables 1 and 2 that in terms of MSE, the regression methods perform best 
43:2255:102967:15:15:87:527:494:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:since  the  models  are  correctly  specified.  The  matching  and  regression  will  have  rather  low  MSE  
43:2256:103077:15:15:87:526:479:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:when both X1 and X2 are controlled. The sample selection estimator without an instrument has the 
43:2257:103174:15:16:87:526:464:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:largest MSE as compared with other methods. However, since it is a consistent estimator, its MES 
43:2258:103271:16:15:87:529:448:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:tends  to  decrease  when  the  sample  size  increase  from  500  to  5000.  The  instrumental  variable  
43:2259:103378:15:19:87:261:433:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:estimator has the second largest MSE.  
43:2260:103417:19:15:123:527:414:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:Table 1 shows the bias of the regression and matching estimators increases remarkably as 
43:2261:103506:15:15:87:526:399:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:the correlation between X1 and D increases with parameter g rising from 0.5 to 2. It is implied that 
43:2262:103607:15:16:87:527:384:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:bias  tends  to  be  higher  if  more  variables  that  affect  both  the  program  selection  and  outcome  are  
43:2263:103721:16:15:87:527:368:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:omitted. In Table 2, the correlation between Z and D is increased by raising parameter k from 0.5 
43:2264:103819:15:15:87:526:353:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:to 2. As a result, MSE of the instrumental variable estimator is reduced significantly, especially in 
43:2265:103921:15:25:87:186:338:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:the small sample.

43:2267:103961:24:16:123:528:289:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:The  main  issue  in  impact  evaluation  is  missing  data.  We  cannot  observe  subjects  at  the  
43:2268:104063:16:15:87:526:273:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:same time in both statuses: participation in a program and non-participation in the program. Unless 
43:2269:104163:15:15:87:527:258:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:the  program  is  randomized,  the  missing  data  is  not  random.  Subjects  are  selected  in  the  program  
43:2270:104275:15:15:87:530:243:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:based  on  their  decisions  and  program  administrators’  decisions.  Different  methods  in  impact  
43:2271:104379:15:15:87:528:228:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:evaluation  rely  on  different  assumptions  on  the  relation  between  the  outcome  process  and  the  
43:2272:104486:15:15:87:530:213:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:program  selection  process  to  construct  the  counterfactual  so  that  the  program  impacts  are  
43:2273:104589:15:16:87:528:198:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:identified.  The  paper  discusses  alternative  methods  in  terms  of  identification  assumptions  and  
43:2274:104696:16:15:87:528:182:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:estimation  strategies  in  contexts  of  the  two  potential  outcome  equations  and  program  selection  
43:2275:104804:15:15:87:527:167:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:equations with allowance for heterogeneous program impacts. The main parameters of interest in 
43:2276:104899:15:15:87:530:152:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:impact   evaluation   that   are   examined   in   this   paper   are   ATE   and   ATT.   In   addition   to   a   
43:2277:105015:15:15:87:529:137:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:randomization-based  method  in  which  participants  are  selected  randomly,  these  methods  are  
43:2278:105116:15:16:87:529:122:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:categorized  into:  (1)  methods  assuming  “selection  on  observable”,  and  (2)  methods  assuming  
43:2279:105219:16:15:87:527:106:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:“selection on unobservable”. If impact of factors that can affect subjects is correlated with impact 
43:2280:105320:15:15:87:528:91:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:of  a  program  of  interest,  we  need  to  separate  the  program  impact.  “Selection  on  observable”  
43:2281:105427:15:0:87:526:76:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:methods are based on an assumption that we can observe all these correlated factors. In contrast, if 
44:2282:105530:0:15:87:526:710:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:we are not able to observe all the correlated factors, we need to resort “selection on unobservable” 
44:2283:105631:15:25:87:130:695:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:methods. 
44:2284:105640:25:15:123:529:670:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:Finally,  measurement  of  program  impact  are  often  very  complicated.  In  reality,  the  
44:2285:105735:15:15:87:528:655:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:treatment  variable  D  can  be  continuous  instead  of  binary.  Besides  the  program  to  be  assessed,  
44:2286:105844:15:15:87:528:640:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:there  might  be  many  other  programs  that  can  affect  the  participants  and  non-participants  of  the  
44:2287:105955:15:15:87:528:625:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:program  in  question.  Unless  the  program  selection  of  others  programs  is  uncorrelated  with  the  
44:2288:106063:15:15:87:527:610:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:selection program of the program to be assessed, the omission of other contemporaneous programs 
44:2289:106159:15:16:87:527:595:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:can lead to serious bias. Furthermore, subjects can participate in a program, e.g. training program 
44:2290:106259:16:15:87:527:579:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:or  micro-credit  program  several  times.  Even  if  they  are  allowed  to  participate  in  a  program  one  
44:2291:106371:15:15:87:527:564:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:time,  they  can  joint  the  program  at  different  points  of  time.  However,  data  on  subjects’  outcome  
44:2292:106484:15:15:87:527:549:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:are often collected at the same point of times. Ignorance of these issues can make the results from 
44:2293:106584:15:15:87:526:534:122:g_d0_f10:122:g_d0_f10:impact evaluation misinterpreted. All of these issues require further study to improve the literature
