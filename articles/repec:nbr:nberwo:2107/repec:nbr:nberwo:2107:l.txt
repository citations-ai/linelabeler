2:24:764:42:23:119:490:549:12:Courier:12:Courier:F:This paper reports on an applied general equilibrium
2:25:816:23:24:83:497:526:12:Courier:12:Courier:F:regional model for Canada which is used to investigate the
2:26:874:24:24:83:537:502:12:Courier:12:Courier:F:regional effects of taxes. Earlier, literature on regional tax
2:27:936:24:24:82:500:478:12:Courier:12:Courier:F:effects is reviewed and the main features of the model are
2:28:994:24:24:82:536:454:12:Courier:12:Courier:F:briefly described. Existing literature on regional tax effects
2:29:1056:24:24:83:490:430:12:Courier:12:Courier:F:is largely non-quantitative, and does not discuss several
2:30:1113:24:24:82:521:406:12:Courier:12:Courier:F:important regional features of taxes, such as taxes which are
2:31:1174:24:23:82:521:382:12:Courier:12:Courier:F:predominantly on products or industries located in particular
2:32:1235:23:24:82:532:359:12:Courier:12:Courier:F:regions. Results suggest that regional effects of taxes can be
2:33:1297:24:24:82:528:335:12:Courier:12:Courier:F:significant, and in the Canadian case at least, do not tend to
2:34:1359:24:24:81:535:311:12:Courier:12:Courier:F:counterbalance one another. In general, richer regions tend to
2:35:1421:24:23:82:496:287:12:Courier:12:Courier:F:lose and poorer regions gain from federal taxes, but other
2:36:1479:23:24:81:545:264:12:Courier:12:Courier:F:regional characteristics such as manufacturing/non-manufacturing,
2:37:1544:24:99:81:381:240:12:Courier:12:Courier:F:or resource/non—resource can be important.

3:43:1778:0:24:71:161:713:16:Times:16:Times:C:I. Introduction
3:44:1793:24:18:71:540:689:13:Times:13:Times:A:Only a small segment of existing public finance literature deals explicitly with the regional
3:45:1886:18:20:70:541:671:14:Times:14:Times:C:effects of taxes, and little of it is numerical in orientation. And yet in many countries
3:46:1975:20:18:70:538:651:13:Times:13:Times:A:the regional dimensions of economic policy are increasingly coming to the fore in debates
3:47:2064:18:19:70:538:633:13:Times:13:Times:A:on both tax and other issues. Taxes which affect products heavily produced in particular
3:48:2152:19:19:69:539:614:13:Times:13:Times:A:regions are often seen as regionally unfair. Regional tax exporting is a further contentious
3:49:2244:19:19:69:538:595:13:Times:13:Times:A:issue, either through deductibility of regional or local taxes at national level, or through
3:50:2336:19:18:69:539:576:13:Times:13:Times:A:tax induced changes in the interregional terms of trade. And there is further debate as to
3:51:2426:18:20:68:310:558:13:Times:13:Times:A:the effects of taxes on regional factor mobility.
3:52:2475:20:20:92:537:538:13:Times:13:Times:A:In part, the lack of literature dealing with these issues is a reflection of the difficulties
3:53:2568:20:19:67:539:518:14:Times:14:Times:C:of regional modelling. Data is often poor, and the most appropriate analytic structure
3:54:2654:19:19:67:537:499:13:Times:13:Times:A:within which these issues, and especially interregional factor mobility, can be adequately
3:55:2744:19:18:67:537:480:13:Times:13:Times:A:captured is not clear from existing literature. But despite these problems the importance
3:56:2833:18:20:66:338:462:13:Times:13:Times:A:of regional dimensions in tax policy design remains.
3:57:2885:20:19:90:537:442:14:Times:14:Times:C:These considerations motivate the use in this paper of a Canadian applied general
3:58:2966:19:18:66:534:423:13:Times:13:Times:A:equilibrium regional model to analyze some of the more prominent regional effects of taxes.1
3:59:3058:18:20:66:537:405:13:Times:13:Times:A:In the sections which follow we comment on previous literature, describe the structure of
3:60:3147:20:18:65:534:385:13:Times:13:Times:A:our model, and report model results. These suggest that regional effects of taxes, at least
3:61:3238:18:19:65:533:367:14:Times:14:Times:C:in the Canadian case, can be pronounced, and, importantly, do not counterbalance one
3:62:3322:19:19:64:534:348:13:Times:13:Times:A:another across different taxes to yield a regionally balanced tax system. In the main, the
3:63:3412:19:20:64:535:329:13:Times:13:Times:A:regional effects of federal taxes appear to be self-reinforcing, benefiting poorer and/or non-
3:64:3506:20:18:64:534:309:14:Times:14:Times:C:manufacturing regions at the expense of richer and/or manufacturing regions. Regional
3:65:3591:18:19:64:532:291:14:Times:14:Times:C:impacts of provincial taxes tend to be in favour of larger regions which can export part
3:66:3679:19:19:63:534:272:14:Times:14:Times:C:of their taxes through effects on the interregional terms of trade, but these are smaller
3:67:3768:19:19:63:534:253:13:Times:13:Times:B:than for federal taxes. One implication of these results would seem to be that the regional
3:68:3859:19:20:63:531:234:13:Times:13:Times:B:effects of federal taxes in Canada are part of a wider system of interregional redistribution,
3:69:3953:20:17:62:531:214:13:Times:13:Times:B:in which taxes partially compensate for the interregional effects of other federal policies,
3:70:4045:17:50:62:253:197:13:Times:13:Times:B:such as trade and industrial policies.
3:71:4083:50:20:85:530:147:14:Times:14:Times:C:This model is described in more detail in Jones and Whalley (forthcoming) and in
3:72:4163:20:19:61:533:127:13:Times:13:Times:B:Trela and Whalley (1986), where its application to a variety of other regional issues is also
3:73:4256:19:18:61:530:108:13:Times:13:Times:B:discussed. The volume by Trela and Whalley also presents some preliminary calculations
3:74:4342:18:30:60:446:90:13:Times:13:Times:B:of regional tax effects which are taken substantially further in this paper.

4:77:4448:23:19:72:542:689:14:Times:14:Times:C:The regional effects of both national and sub-national taxes have been a topic of policy
4:78:4536:19:18:72:541:670:14:Times:14:Times:C:debate in federal states for many years. In Canada, limits were placed on the taxing
4:79:4620:18:19:72:539:652:13:Times:13:Times:A:powers of provincial governments at the time of Confederation in 1867. Indirect taxes on
4:80:4708:19:20:72:542:633:13:Times:13:Times:A:commodities such as wheat were viewed as taxes which could potentially be shifted onto
4:81:4794:20:19:72:542:613:13:Times:13:Times:A:other regions through changes in the interregional terms of trade, and so provincial taxing
4:82:4885:19:18:72:542:594:13:Times:13:Times:A:powers were limited to direct taxes, i.e., taxes seen as borne directly by the regions paying
4:83:4978:18:19:71:540:576:13:Times:13:Times:A:the tax. Although provinces now use indirect taxes such as retail sales taxes, the issue of
4:84:5069:19:20:71:540:557:13:Times:13:Times:A:which taxing powers various levels of government should be allowed to use has been an
4:85:5154:20:19:71:291:537:13:Times:13:Times:A:ongoing theme of Canadian policy debate.
4:86:5194:19:19:95:541:518:14:Times:14:Times:C:In analyzing what regional effects both national and sub-national taxes can have, a
4:87:5277:19:19:71:538:499:13:Times:13:Times:A:variety of factors come into play, and as we mention in our Introduction these have been
4:88:5365:19:19:70:541:480:13:Times:13:Times:A:little analyzed in previous literature. Existing literature on regional effects of taxes seems
4:89:5459:19:20:70:228:461:14:Times:14:Times:C:to have three distinct strands.
4:90:5490:20:19:94:541:441:14:Times:14:Times:C:First there are regional tax incidence calculations, examining the incidence effects
4:91:5574:19:19:70:540:422:13:Times:13:Times:A:across regions of both national and regional taxes. This work seeks to evaluate the regional
4:92:5666:19:20:70:539:403:13:Times:13:Times:A:effects of taxes using shifting assumptions and associated distributive series.1 Gillespie
4:93:5756:20:18:70:538:383:14:Times:14:Times:C:(1980, p. 141), for instance, reports regional tax incidence calculations for Canada by
4:94:5843:18:18:70:538:365:13:Times:13:Times:A:income class by region, where five regional versions of the distributive series commonly
4:95:5931:18:20:69:538:347:14:Times:14:Times:C:used in national calculations are employed. The picture that emerges is that, outside
4:96:6016:20:19:69:540:327:14:Times:14:Times:C:of the Prairie regions, regional incidence patterns by income range are broadly similar
4:97:6103:19:20:69:538:308:14:Times:14:Times:C:to national patterns. Although no behavioural impacts (terms of trade effects, induced
4:98:6189:20:18:69:539:288:13:Times:13:Times:A:mobility responses, etc.) are captured by such analyses, these results suggest that regional
4:99:6281:18:19:69:272:270:13:Times:13:Times:A:effects of taxes are not that significant.
4:100:6323:19:19:92:538:251:13:Times:13:Times:A:A second strand of literature derives from McLure's (1967) work on interstate effects
4:101:6408:19:18:68:538:232:14:Times:14:Times:C:of corporate taxes in the U.S. This literature emphasizes the deductibility of state and
4:102:6496:18:19:68:537:214:13:Times:13:Times:A:local taxes from federal taxes, and the resulting ability of subnational jurisdictions to have
4:103:6590:19:19:68:539:195:13:Times:13:Times:A:other jurisdictions share in the financing costs of locally provided services. Since McLure's
4:104:6683:19:19:68:537:176:13:Times:13:Times:A:paper, this same theme has reappeared in a number of studies of fiscal federalism in the
4:105:6771:19:29:68:461:157:13:Times:13:Times:A:United States; a recent example, for instance, is Morgan and Mutti (1985).
4:106:6845:29:19:81:536:128:13:Times:13:Times:A:1 This approach to national tax incidence issues has been widely employed in the public
4:107:6932:19:19:67:535:109:14:Times:14:Times:C:finance literature for many years. Pechman and Okner's (1974) work on the U.S. tax
4:108:7014:19:31:66:333:90:13:Times:13:Times:A:system is some of the best known in this tradition.
4:109:7065:31:0:298:303:59:10:Times:10:Times:F:2
5:110:7066:0:20:101:546:711:13:Times:13:Times:A:A third strand of literature attempts to determine the interregional incidence effects
5:111:7152:20:19:77:544:691:14:Times:14:Times:C:of taxes using Harberger-type general equilibrium models. These models capture tax
5:112:7234:19:19:76:544:672:14:Times:14:Times:C:exporting effects through impacts on the interregional terms of trade, but this literature
5:113:7324:19:19:76:547:653:13:Times:13:Times:A:is exclusively theoretical and uses strong assumptions on interregional factor mobility to
5:114:7414:19:18:76:545:634:13:Times:13:Times:A:obtain clear analytical results. McLure (1969), for instance, presents a general equilibrium
5:115:7506:18:20:75:545:616:13:Times:13:Times:A:analysis of the interregional incidence effects of several types of taxes' levied in one region
5:116:7601:20:18:75:544:596:13:Times:13:Times:A:in a larger country, assuming that labour is interregionally immobile, capital interregionally
5:117:7695:18:21:75:502:578:13:Times:13:Times:A:mobile, and with the residence of both workers and capital owners assumed fixed.
5:118:7775:21:18:98:545:557:13:Times:13:Times:A:Relatively neglected in all this literature are: the interregional terms of trade effects
5:119:7864:18:19:74:545:539:14:Times:14:Times:C:associated with national rather than regional taxes, the effects of taxes on interregional
5:120:7954:19:19:73:544:520:14:Times:14:Times:C:factor mobility, the effects of national taxes which apply to industries heavily concen-
5:121:8042:19:19:73:544:501:13:Times:13:Times:A:trated in particular regions, and other issues such as regional effects of taxes which affect
5:122:8135:19:20:72:250:482:13:Times:13:Times:A:interregional transportation costs.
5:123:8170:20:19:96:543:462:14:Times:14:Times:C:Most of these are contentious issues in the Canadian case. Since manufacturing in-
5:124:8252:19:19:71:540:443:13:Times:13:Times:A:dustry is heavily concentrated in Central Canada, the regional implications of the manu-
5:125:8340:19:19:71:540:424:14:Times:14:Times:C:facturers' sales tax, the corporate tax, or the lower corporate tax rate on manufacturing
5:126:8429:19:19:71:539:405:13:Times:14:Times:A:and processing are much discussed. Also, with differences in regional incomeper capita,
5:127:8516:19:20:70:541:386:13:Times:13:Times:A:progressive national income taxes clearly tend to redistribute income between regions. In
5:128:8605:20:19:70:540:366:13:Times:13:Times:A:addition, since hinterland regions import significant amounts of commodities from large
5:129:8692:19:18:70:540:347:13:Times:13:Times:A:central regions which act as price makers in interregional trade, taxes which raise trans-
5:130:8782:18:19:69:540:329:13:Times:13:Times:A:portation costs are seen as being borne more heavily by hinterland regions. Excise taxes
5:131:8870:19:19:69:537:310:13:Times:13:Times:A:on gasoline and other related taxes, such as vehicle registration fees, can therefore have
5:132:8960:19:20:68:231:291:13:Times:13:Times:A:significant interregional effects.
5:133:8994:20:19:92:538:271:14:Times:14:Times:C:Also, little work has been done which explicitly takes interregional factor mobility
5:134:9078:19:19:68:538:252:13:Times:13:Times:A:into account in evaluating the interregional effects of taxes. This is an especially difficult
5:135:9172:19:18:67:536:233:13:Times:13:Times:A:issue, since what one means by a region is no longer so clearly defined once interregional
5:136:9262:18:22:67:202:215:13:Times:13:Times:A:factor mobility is allowed.
5:137:9289:22:18:91:537:193:13:Times:13:Times:A:If capital is both internationally and interregionally mobile, and if all regions are takers
5:138:9381:18:19:66:537:175:13:Times:13:Times:A:of rental prices on world capital markets, then the only effect of a regional tax applying to
5:139:9474:19:19:66:533:156:13:Times:11:Times:A:inward capital flows is to discourage capital investment in the region, with no effectson
5:140:9563:19:18:66:535:137:13:Times:13:Times:A:other regions. If capital is not internationally mobile but remains interregionally mobile,
5:141:9654:18:31:65:534:119:13:Times:13:Times:A:the effect of such a tax is to change the interregional allocation of capital, having effects
5:142:9747:31:31:88:405:88:13:Times:13:Times:A:Taxes on factor inputs, on consumption, and on production.
5:143:9805:31:0:294:300:57:12:Times:12:Times:F:3
6:144:9806:0:18:70:158:713:13:Times:13:Times:A:on other regions.
6:145:9823:18:19:94:540:695:13:Times:13:Times:A:Labour is generally believed to be only partially interregionally mobile in Canada. In
6:146:9909:19:19:70:541:676:13:Times:13:Times:A:part this reflects costs of relocation and the search process accompanying induced adjust-

6:148:10092:19:18:69:538:638:13:Times:13:Times:A:also come into play. Capturing this in a convincing modelling framework is the challenge.

7:154:10447:23:20:76:546:688:13:Times:13:Times:A:The Canadian regional general equilibrium model we use is closely related to the applied
7:155:10535:20:19:76:544:668:14:Times:14:Times:C:models already used to analyze taxation and international trade policy issues (see the
7:156:10621:19:19:75:546:649:13:Times:13:Times:A:survey paper by Shoven and Whalley (1984)). A more detailed description of the model
7:157:10705:19:18:75:544:630:13:Times:13:Times:A:appears in Jones and Whalley (forthcoming), the appendix of which contains a statement
7:158:10791:18:20:75:258:612:13:Times:13:Times:A:of the model in full algebraic form.
7:159:10827:20:19:99:544:592:13:Times:13:Times:A:The model operates both in basic variant form, and with a series of extensions available
7:160:10915:19:19:74:545:573:14:Times:14:Times:C:which each enhance the modelling capability, but at a cost in terms of computational
7:161:10999:19:18:74:544:554:13:Times:13:Times:A:complexity. The main features of the basic variant of the model are summarized in Table

7:163:11171:20:19:74:542:516:13:Times:13:Times:A:interregional trade in commodities takes place. In contrast to existing international trade
7:164:11262:19:20:73:542:497:13:Times:13:Times:A:models a series of further interactions (such as intergovernmental transfers) occurs between
7:165:11354:20:18:73:542:477:13:Times:13:Times:A:regions. Also, the assumption of interjurisdictional factor immobility commonly made in
7:166:11441:18:20:73:236:459:13:Times:13:Times:A:trade models is not made here.

7:169:11574:21:17:72:542:398:13:Times:13:Times:A:Canadian regions: Atlantic Canada, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba/Saskatchewan, Alberta,
7:170:11657:17:19:71:541:381:14:Times:14:Times:C:and British Columbia. Interregional trade in goods and interregional factor flows both
7:171:11743:19:18:71:542:362:13:Times:13:Times:A:occur. A seventh region represents the rest of the world (ROW), with whom all Canadian
7:172:11829:18:21:71:267:344:13:Times:13:Times:A:regions engage in international trade.
7:173:11867:21:19:95:538:323:13:Times:13:Times:A:Each Canadian region has 13 industries2, each of which produces a single output and
7:174:11950:19:18:70:541:304:14:Times:14:Times:C:uses both primary factors (capital services, labour services, and natural resources) and
7:175:12038:18:19:70:540:286:14:Times:14:Times:C:intermediate products (other commodities) as inputs. The ROW also has 13 industries,
7:176:12122:19:19:70:541:267:14:Times:14:Times:C:but production involves only capital and labour services, with no intermediate inputs.

9:237:14426:20:18:77:544:691:13:Times:13:Times:A:assumption" (from Armington (1969)), widely used in international trade applied general
9:238:14513:18:19:76:545:673:14:Times:14:Times:C:equilibrium analysis. The reasons for adopting this treatment here are the same as iii
9:239:14599:19:19:76:547:654:14:Times:14:Times:C:the international trade models; i.e., the presence of cross hauling in interregional trade
9:240:14689:19:19:75:545:635:14:Times:14:Times:C:statistics, where the same good is shown as being both imported and exported by the
9:241:14772:19:19:75:544:616:13:Times:13:Times:A:same region. It is also easier to incorporate interregional trade elasticities into the model
9:242:14865:19:18:75:545:597:14:Times:14:Times:C:specification using this Armington treatment. The extent to which regions can change
9:243:14949:18:19:75:542:579:14:Times:14:Times:C:their terms of trade and shift the burden of taxes onto other regions depends critically
9:244:15037:19:18:74:544:560:13:Times:13:Times:A:upon the values used for substitution elasticities among the Arm ington products. These,
9:245:15125:18:18:74:544:542:13:Times:13:Times:A:in turn, reflect one's belief as to what are reasonable values for elasticities in interregional

9:248:15302:17:23:73:101:485:14:Times:14:Times:C:tions
9:249:15307:23:18:97:543:462:13:Times:13:Times:A:While three different factors of production (capital services, labour services, and nat-
9:250:15395:18:20:72:542:444:13:Times:13:Times:A:ural resources) are used in production in the regions in the model, to simplify computation
9:251:15486:20:19:71:542:424:14:Times:14:Times:C:only two of these appear as inputs in the production function for any industry in any
9:252:15571:19:18:71:541:405:14:Times:14:Times:C:region. Non-energy industries use capital and labour services as factor inputs; energy
9:253:15657:18:20:71:541:387:14:Times:14:Times:C:industries use natural resources and labour services. Resource inputs are treated as in-
9:254:15745:20:18:70:541:367:13:Times:13:Times:A:ternationally and intersectorally immobile. The key resource inputs appear in oil and gas
9:255:15834:18:20:70:421:349:13:Times:13:Times:A:(energy) industries, especially in the resource rich Western regions.
9:256:15903:20:19:94:538:329:14:Times:14:Times:C:Two different factor mobility assumptions are used for capital services. In variant
9:257:15986:19:19:70:539:310:13:Times:13:Times:A:(a) of the model, capital is assumed to be both interregionally and intersectorally mobile
9:258:16076:19:19:69:538:291:13:Times:13:Times:A:within Canada, but internationally immobile. Variant (b) differs from this in also allowing
9:259:16167:19:18:69:537:272:14:Times:14:Times:C:for international mobility of capital. These two model variants reflect the fact that the
9:260:16256:18:19:68:539:254:13:Times:13:Times:A:literature is not conclusive as to whether or not perfect international mobility of capital is
9:261:16350:19:19:68:537:235:13:Times:13:Times:A:a reasonable assumption to make for smaller countries such as Canada, even though many
9:262:16436:19:21:67:231:216:13:Times:13:Times:A:economists consistently use it.'
9:263:16468:21:20:91:538:195:14:Times:14:Times:C:The way in which interregional labour mobility is modelled is more complex, with
9:264:16548:20:18:67:536:175:13:Times:13:Times:A:labour assumed to be internationally immobile, intersectorally mobile, but interregionally
9:265:16638:18:20:66:536:157:14:Times:14:Times:C:partially mobile. Partial mobility of labour between regions is incorporated through a
9:266:16724:20:18:66:538:137:13:Times:13:Times:A:distribution of individuals within any region assumed, who vary by their intensity of loca-
9:267:16815:18:30:66:537:119:13:Times:13:Times:A:tional preference. Individuals trade off differences in real income associated with locating

10:270:16963:0:19:61:532:716:13:Times:13:Times:B:and working in various regions against their preference for remaining in their region of ori-
10:271:17056:19:20:60:529:697:13:Times:13:Times:B:gin. The effect is that in response to changes in relative regional incomes, only a portion
10:272:17147:20:19:60:510:677:13:Times:13:Times:B:of any region's population migrates (see the more detailed discussion in Appendix A).
10:273:17232:19:19:84:528:658:13:Times:13:Times:A:This partial mobility treatment is used for a number of reasons. The most important
10:274:17315:19:19:59:531:639:14:Times:14:Times:C:is that a model in which labour is perfectly mobile between regions is not particularly
10:275:17402:19:19:59:529:620:13:Times:13:Times:B:useful in analyzing whether, and by how much, regions gain or lose as a result of changes
10:276:17491:19:19:59:530:601:13:Times:13:Times:B:in either national or regional taxes. This is because regions, as such, are not well defined
10:277:17583:19:19:59:530:582:13:Times:13:Times:B:in such a model variant.' Treating labour as completely immobile between regions allows
10:278:17670:19:20:59:528:563:13:Times:13:Times:B:interregional distributional effects of taxes to be analyzed, but excludes all the efficiency
10:279:17763:20:19:58:526:543:13:Times:13:Times:B:issues associated with the regional movement of labour which have been so heavily stressed
10:280:17853:19:20:58:253:524:13:Times:13:Times:B:in recent fiscal federalism literature.2
10:281:17893:20:20:58:138:504:15:Times:15:Times:C:Demand Side
10:282:17904:20:19:82:528:484:13:Times:13:Times:A:On the demand side of the model, products produced both within and outside regions
10:283:17986:19:19:57:527:465:13:Times:13:Times:B:appear in the final demand functions for each region, including ROW. Final demands are
10:284:18072:19:19:57:528:446:14:Times:14:Times:C:based on utility maximization, with each region maximizing a nested CES/LES utility
10:285:18155:19:19:57:528:427:14:Times:14:Times:C:function subject to a regional budget constraint. Intermediate demands, which involve
10:286:18240:19:19:56:526:408:14:Times:14:Times:C:a nested CES production structure, reflect cost minimization across within-region and
10:287:18325:19:18:56:527:389:14:Times:14:Times:C:out-of-region sources of supply. The most important objective in designing the nesting
10:288:18411:18:19:56:527:371:14:Times:14:Times:C:structure is to facilitate the incorporation of key elasticity parameters into the model,
10:289:18500:19:19:56:525:352:13:Times:13:Times:B:including those which affect both interregional and international trade. This is discussed
10:290:18590:19:21:55:326:333:13:Times:13:Times:B:in more detail in Jones and Whalley (forthcoming).

10:294:18900:19:19:54:524:255:14:Times:14:Times:C:in the region's budget constraint on the expenditure side, but also generate lump sum
10:295:18985:19:21:54:288:236:13:Times:13:Times:A:transfers which reappear as regional income.
10:296:19029:21:32:78:523:215:14:Times:14:Times:C:Since there is no data available in Canada (or any other country to our knowledge)
10:297:19111:32:19:77:522:183:13:Times:13:Times:A:Furthermore, because of this treatment of interregional partial mobility, when report-
10:298:19197:19:19:53:522:164:13:Times:13:Times:A:ing model results showing regional impacts of tax changes one needs to distinguish between
10:299:19287:19:19:53:523:145:13:Times:13:Times:A:only those original residents of a region who remain after the policy change, the original
10:300:19377:19:18:53:522:126:13:Times:13:Times:A:residents of a region including those who migrate outwards following a policy change, and
10:301:19466:18:16:53:271:108:13:Times:13:Times:A:the remaining residents plus new arrivals.
10:302:19508:16:28:76:325:92:13:Times:13:Times:A:See, for instance, Boadway and Flatters (1982).

11:304:19556:0:20:77:547:713:14:Times:14:Times:C:on interregional patterns of asset ownership, we make the strong assumption that in the
11:305:19643:20:17:77:544:693:13:Times:13:Times:A:base (pre-tax policy change) situation considered by the model, all capital andresource
11:306:19730:17:20:77:419:676:13:Times:13:Times:A:income originating in a region accrues to residents of that region.

11:308:19810:20:19:100:544:636:13:Times:13:Times:A:The main characteristics of the model treatment of foreign trade are the Armington
11:309:19892:19:17:76:544:617:13:Times:13:Times:A:assumption and the treatment of international factor mobility, both of which are discussed
11:310:19982:17:22:75:108:600:13:Times:13:Times:A:above.
11:311:19988:22:18:99:542:578:14:Times:14:Times:C:The way that the behaviour of foreigners is treated in applied general equilibrium
11:312:20070:18:19:75:544:560:13:Times:13:Times:A:models is often important for model results.' In the present model, their behaviour involves
11:313:20162:19:20:74:541:541:13:Times:14:Times:A:both their production and demand. An external sector balance conditionappears as part
11:314:20247:20:19:73:543:521:14:Times:14:Times:C:of the characterization of equilibrium. This states that the value of imports plus the
11:315:20333:19:19:73:544:502:14:Times:14:Times:C:net imbalance on the capital account equals the value of exports, and is equivalent to
11:316:20419:19:18:73:543:483:14:Times:14:Times:C:stating that, as a country, Canada is always on its budget constraint in its international
11:317:20509:18:21:73:139:465:13:Times:13:Times:A:transactions.
11:318:20522:21:19:96:542:444:14:Times:14:Times:C:In the data used to calibrate the model the output of each industry in the Rest of
11:319:20604:19:20:72:541:425:14:Times:14:Times:C:the World is set at approximately ten times the value added in the same industry for
11:320:20688:20:18:71:540:405:13:Times:13:Times:A:all Canadian regions combined. This approximates Canada's position viz-a-viz its largest
11:321:20776:18:18:71:539:387:13:Times:13:Times:A:trading partner, the U.S. The two most important parameters in this treatment of foreign
11:322:20864:18:20:70:540:369:13:Times:13:Times:A:trade are the values chosen for elasticities of substitution between Canadian and foreign
11:323:20953:20:20:70:540:349:13:Times:13:Times:A:products in demands in each region, and the size set for ROW, since these jointly determine
11:324:21044:20:17:70:529:329:13:Times:13:Times:A:the international import and export price elasticities which regions within Canada face.

11:327:21251:19:19:69:540:272:13:Times:13:Times:A:and international trade, are both federal and provincial taxes, and a series of policies, all
11:328:21344:19:17:68:540:253:13:Times:13:Times:A:of which have regional effects. These are listed in Table 2 along with a brief description of

11:330:21459:21:20:92:538:215:13:Times:13:Times:A:The main Canadian federal and provincial taxes which have interregional effects all
11:331:21542:20:19:67:536:195:13:Times:13:Times:A:appear in the model. The federal manufacturers' sales tax enters as an ad valorem sales tax
11:332:21633:19:29:67:537:176:13:Times:13:Times:A:on manufactures, with differences in tax rates by commodity reflecting the rate structure
11:333:21722:29:19:91:535:147:13:Times:13:Times:A:For instance, Whalley and Yeung (1984) have shown that the treatment adopted for

11:335:21889:19:19:66:535:109:13:Times:13:Times:A:crucially affect the behaviour of the model, since this determines whether the economy in
11:336:21978:19:30:66:416:90:13:Times:13:Times:A:which one is interested is modelled as a price taker or price maker.

14:398:24319:19:22:53:321:609:13:Times:13:Times:A:ad valorem form, as do provincial retail sales taxes.
14:399:24372:22:18:77:518:587:14:Times:14:Times:C:In the case of most of the other policies entering the model, the treatment adopted
14:400:24455:18:20:54:518:569:14:Times:14:Times:C:is relatively straightforward. For instance, the tariff is treated as an ad valorem tax on
14:401:24545:20:20:54:517:549:13:Times:13:Times:A:imports into all regions in Canada, covering both final and intermediate demands and with
14:402:24634:20:21:54:228:529:13:Times:13:Times:A:rates varying across commodities.
14:403:24667:21:19:78:516:508:13:Times:13:Times:A:In a few cases, the model treatment is more complex. This is the case with energy
14:404:24748:19:20:54:519:489:13:Times:13:Times:A:policies, where a number of different features come into play. Royalties are incorporated
14:405:24837:20:18:54:519:469:13:Times:13:Times:A:as ad valorem regional taxes on resource inputs (oil and gas) used in energy industries.
14:406:24925:18:19:54:519:451:13:Times:13:Times:A:Energy price ceilings (which were used in Canada in the base year for the model (1981)) are
14:407:25016:19:20:54:520:432:13:Times:13:Times:A:approximated by ad valorem consumer subsidies on energy which maintain consumer prices
14:408:25102:20:18:54:520:412:13:Times:13:Times:A:below world prices, and corresponding taxes on producers. The model also incorporates a
14:409:25189:18:20:54:520:394:13:Times:13:Times:A:Petroleum Compensation Charge which was used to finance consumer subsidies covering
14:410:25272:20:24:54:462:374:13:Times:13:Times:A:the difference between domestic and world prices for imports in the base year.
14:411:25350:24:20:54:286:350:15:Times:15:Times:C:Implementing the Modelling Approach
14:412:25385:20:19:79:521:330:13:Times:13:Times:A:To apply the model outlined above to the evaluation of the interregional effects of taxes
14:413:25474:19:20:55:520:311:13:Times:13:Times:B:in Canada, parameter values must be specified for the functions used in the model, and it
14:414:25563:20:21:55:503:291:13:Times:13:Times:B:must be solved for competitive equilibria under the various policy changes considered.
14:415:25649:21:20:79:518:270:13:Times:13:Times:A:In specifying model parameter values, a calibration procedure similar to those used
14:416:25732:20:18:55:519:250:13:Times:13:Times:B:in other applied general equilibrium models is followed (see Mansur and Whalley (1984)).
14:417:25820:18:19:55:519:232:14:Times:14:Times:C:Calibration is most easily understood as the use of model equilibrium conditions and
14:418:25904:19:19:55:520:213:14:Times:14:Times:C:equilibrium data to solve for the parameter values used in the functions in the model.
14:419:25990:19:20:56:521:194:14:Times:14:Times:C:This involves selecting a set of parameters values such that data which characterizes a
14:420:26077:20:19:56:518:174:13:Times:13:Times:B:benchmark (or observed) equilibrium can be reproduced as a model equilibrium. Only
14:421:26159:19:18:56:519:155:13:Times:13:Times:B:when the model is fully specified and a policy change incorporated is the model solved
14:422:26245:18:20:56:518:137:13:Times:13:Times:B:for a new equilibrium solution. Evaluations of the regional impacts of taxes follow from
14:423:26333:20:18:56:521:117:13:Times:13:Times:B:pairwise comparisons between simulated (or new) equilibria and the benchmark equilibrium
14:424:26421:18:21:56:227:99:13:Times:13:Times:B:to which the model is calibrated.
14:425:26454:21:29:80:520:78:13:Times:13:Times:A:Thus, two types of equilibria have to be distinguished when using the model. One is
14:426:26537:29:0:286:291:49:10:Times:10:Times:F:9
15:427:26538:0:18:80:542:703:13:Times:11:Times:A:'observed' or 'benchmark' equilibria which are given from data and to which the modelis
15:428:26625:18:19:80:545:685:13:Times:13:Times:A:calibrated (and thus do not need to be computed). The second is 'new' or 'counterfactual'
15:429:26714:19:20:80:463:666:13:Times:13:Times:A:equilibria which are computed as model solutions under changes in policy.
15:430:26787:20:19:104:543:646:13:Times:13:Times:A:Elasticity estimates enter this calibration process by serving as identifying restrictions,
15:431:26878:19:19:79:541:627:13:Times:13:Times:A:allowing the other parameter values in the model to be directly calculated. Since different
15:432:26969:19:19:79:541:608:13:Times:12:Times:A:elasticities produce changed values for the other model parameters, therebyaffecting model
15:433:27059:19:18:79:541:589:13:Times:13:Times:A:results, selecting appropriate elasticity values is central to the model specificationprocess.
15:434:27153:18:20:79:532:571:13:Times:13:Times:A:The values chosen and the justification for these choices are discussedmore fully below.

15:436:27288:22:19:103:541:529:13:Times:13:Times:A:A base year 1981 micro consistent regional data set for Canada is used incalibrating

15:438:27459:19:17:78:545:491:13:Times:13:Times:A:paper by St-Hilaire and Whalley (1983) which describes the construction of a 1972 national
15:439:27549:17:22:77:189:474:14:Times:14:Times:C:data set for Canada.'
15:440:27570:22:19:102:540:452:13:Times:13:Times:A:In the regional data, each region is treated as a separateeconomy, and the links be-
15:441:27654:19:20:77:540:433:13:Times:13:Times:A:tween regions differ from those recorded between nations in international data sets. Trade
15:442:27744:20:19:77:540:413:14:Times:13:Times:A:between regions is incorporated, but taxes paid by regions to the federalgovernment,
15:443:27828:19:20:77:542:394:13:Times:13:Times:A:intergovernmental transfers received by regions, and federal government purchases of re-
15:444:27916:20:17:77:542:374:14:Times:14:Times:C:gionally produced goods also appear. As a result, regions can be in either a surplus or
15:445:28003:17:20:77:539:357:14:Times:14:Times:C:deficit position in their transactions with the federal government. In turn,a surplus in
15:446:28091:20:17:76:542:337:13:Times:13:Times:A:transactions with the federal government can finance a deficit in a region's international
15:447:28181:17:22:76:200:320:13:Times:13:Times:A:and interregional trade.
15:448:28205:22:19:101:542:298:14:Times:14:Times:C:Developing a micro consistent regional data set requires that all the transactions
15:449:28287:19:20:76:539:279:13:Times:13:Times:A:taking place in the separate markets and regions which comprise t.he nationaleconomy be
15:450:28374:20:19:76:541:259:13:Times:13:Times:A:recorded. Provincial Input-Output (PlO) Tables for 1979 produced by Statistics Canada
15:451:28459:19:18:76:541:240:13:Times:13:Times:A:as an extension to their National Input-Output Tables are the major building block used
15:452:28546:18:20:76:538:222:13:Times:13:Times:A:in assembling the micro consistent regional data set used here. The PlO dataare updated
15:453:28633:20:19:76:539:202:13:Times:13:Times:A:to 1981 using estimates of regional economy-wide aggregates from the Provincial Economic
15:454:28721:19:20:76:541:183:13:Times:13:Times:A:Accounts (PEA) compiled by Statistics Canada. The PEA also provide estimates of federal
15:455:28808:20:18:76:539:163:13:Times:13:Times:A:government transactions with individual regions, which are integrated into the data set.
15:456:28896:18:17:76:541:145:13:Times:13:Times:A:Tax rates come from data on taxes paid and estimates of the relevant tax bases contained
15:457:28984:17:31:75:138:128:14:Times:14:Times:C:in this data.
15:458:28997:31:17:100:538:97:13:Times:13:Times:A:A more recent paper by St-Hilaire and Whalley (1985) gives more detail on thepresent

16:462:29113:20:20:83:523:692:13:Times:13:Times:A:Besides the 1981 micro consistent data set, the elasticities of substitution which ap-
16:463:29199:20:18:59:524:672:14:Times:14:Times:C:pear in the production and utility functions are also important for model results. Most
16:464:29286:18:19:59:522:654:13:Times:13:Times:B:important are four different sets of elasticities which affect commodity and factor flows
16:465:29375:19:21:59:524:635:14:Times:14:Times:C:in the model. These are: international trade elasticities (on both the import and export
16:466:29463:21:18:59:524:614:13:Times:13:Times:B:side), elasticities determining substitution effects between energy and non-energy products
16:467:29554:18:20:59:522:596:13:Times:13:Times:B:in both final demands and intermediate production in each region,' elasticities affecting
16:468:29643:20:18:59:525:576:13:Times:13:Times:B:interregional trade in commodities, and elasticity parameters determining the size of in-
16:469:29732:18:21:59:453:558:13:Times:13:Times:B:terregional labour mobility effects induced by tax and other policy changes.
16:470:29808:21:19:83:522:537:13:Times:13:Times:A:The international trade elasticity values used are based on a compendium of estimates
16:471:29893:19:19:59:522:518:13:Times:13:Times:B:of trade elasticities due to Stern et a!. (1976). Model estimates for Canada are based on
16:472:29982:19:19:59:523:499:14:Times:14:Times:C:the median point estimates for both the Canadian import demand elasticities, and the
16:473:30066:19:21:59:303:480:13:Times:13:Times:B:export demand elasticities which Canada faces.
16:474:30112:21:19:83:524:459:13:Times:13:Times:A:A recent survey of energy demand elasticities by Kouris (1982) reviews existing esti-
16:475:30197:19:20:59:521:440:13:Times:13:Times:B:mates, and contains comments on possible ranges of energy elasticity values, although not
16:476:30286:20:19:59:522:420:13:Times:13:Times:B:specifically for Canada. The Kouris study produces a range of energy elasticity estimates
16:477:30375:19:17:59:523:401:13:Times:13:Times:B:(-.1 to -.5) only slightly lower than that suggested by Thirsk and Wright (1977) for Canada.
16:478:30467:17:19:59:524:384:13:Times:13:Times:B:Estimates in this range are therefore used in specifying energy demand elasticity values in
16:479:30558:19:20:59:114:365:13:Times:13:Times:B:the model.
16:480:30568:20:20:83:523:345:13:Times:13:Times:A:Other commodities appear in the demand functions as a composite non-energy prod-
16:481:30648:20:19:59:524:325:14:Times:14:Times:C:uct, with substitution between the component products entering the composite. Since
16:482:30731:19:19:59:522:306:13:Times:13:Times:B:these are less crucial for results than other elasticities in the model, a Cobb-Douglas spec-
16:483:30824:19:19:59:523:287:13:Times:13:Times:B:ification is used in the preference functions for this level of the nesting in all regions in the
16:484:30921:19:20:59:395:268:13:Times:13:Times:B:model. This is equivalent to setting all these elasticities to unity.
16:485:30990:20:19:83:523:248:13:Times:13:Times:A:There are no current estimates of price elasticities in interregional trade in Canada
16:486:31075:19:20:59:522:229:13:Times:13:Times:B:since there is insufficient time series data on interregional trade flows on which to base
16:487:31165:20:19:59:524:209:13:Times:13:Times:B:such estimation. The approach used here for setting these parameter values is the same as
16:488:31254:19:19:59:525:190:13:Times:13:Times:B:Hazeldine's (1979); that is, to assume that elasticities in interregional trade are the same as
16:489:31349:19:19:59:523:171:13:Times:13:Times:B:those in international trade. This approach is contentious, however, since a shares approach
16:490:31441:19:18:59:524:152:13:Times:13:Times:B:to elasticity determination, based on a region's share of international trade, would suggest
16:491:31533:18:24:59:524:134:13:Times:13:Times:B:that interregional trade elasticities would be considerably higher than international trade
16:492:31624:24:24:72:521:110:4:Times:13:Times:A:1Thenesting structures in the model are identical for both final demands and interme-
16:493:31709:24:30:59:147:86:13:Times:13:Times:B:diate production.
16:494:31726:30:0:286:295:56:9:Times:9:Times:F:11
17:495:31728:0:19:82:548:702:13:Times:13:Times:A:elasticities. Model performance based on sensitivity analysis around these values, reflecting
17:496:31821:19:19:82:547:683:13:Times:13:Times:A:other approaches to specifying interregional trade elasticity estimates, is discussed in Trela
17:497:31915:19:18:82:188:664:13:Times:13:Times:A:and Whalley (1986).
17:498:31934:18:19:106:547:646:14:Times:14:Times:C:Elasticities of substitution between factor inputs in value added functions in each
17:499:32017:19:19:82:547:627:13:Times:13:Times:A:region are set at 0.8 for all non-energy industries in all regions, and 0.5 for energy industries.
17:500:32115:19:21:82:548:608:13:Times:13:Times:A:These are a little lower than the values reported in the survey paper by Caddy (1976) and
17:501:32204:21:18:82:546:587:13:Times:13:Times:A:used in Piggott and Whalley (1985), Whalley (1985), and Ballard, Fullerton, et al. (1985)
17:502:32293:18:19:82:545:569:13:Times:13:Times:A:for non-energy industries, and reflect the lack of a compatible classification link between
17:503:32384:19:18:81:548:550:14:Times:14:Times:C:other studies and that used in the present model. A strong assumption is made that
17:504:32466:18:21:82:442:532:13:Times:13:Times:A:identical values can be used for similar industries in different regions.
17:505:32539:21:19:106:548:511:13:Times:13:Times:A:In the factor flow area, different treatments are used for capital services and for labour
17:506:32629:19:19:81:547:492:13:Times:13:Times:A:services. In the case of capital services, the two mobility assumptions discussed earlier are
17:507:32722:19:18:81:546:473:13:Times:13:Times:A:used: either capital is assumed to be both interregionally and internationally mobile, or it
17:508:32814:18:20:81:291:455:13:Times:13:Times:A:is treated as only interregionally mobile.
17:509:32856:20:19:105:548:435:13:Times:13:Times:A:In the labour mobility treatment, the key parameters are those which determine the
17:510:32938:19:19:81:547:416:13:Times:13:Times:A:degree of partial mobility of labour between regions. These relate to the mobility formula-
17:511:33029:19:20:81:547:397:13:Times:13:Times:A:tion discussed earlier. The most recent study of interregional migration in Canada is that
17:512:33119:20:20:81:546:377:13:Times:13:Times:A:by Winer and Gauthier (1982) who analyze the effects of fiscal incentives on migration.
17:513:33206:20:18:81:548:357:13:Times:13:Times:A:In specifying the interregional mobility component of the model, it is, however, difficult
17:514:33296:18:19:81:544:339:13:Times:13:Times:A:to relate the Winer-Cauthier results directly to the mobility parameters which appear in
17:515:33384:19:20:81:548:320:13:Times:13:Times:A:the general equilibrium model. As a result, alternative values of the corresponding model
17:516:33473:20:19:81:546:300:13:Times:13:Times:A:parameters are chosen for compatibility with different assumptions on the elasticity of out-
17:517:33565:19:204:81:468:281:13:Times:13:Times:A:migration from a region with respect to interregional income differentials.'

18:520:33690:0:24:60:372:707:15:Times:15:Times:C:V. Model Results On The Regional Effects Of Taxes
18:521:33739:24:20:60:525:683:13:Times:13:Times:B:In this section we report results from the model which are relevant to an assessment of the
18:522:33830:20:20:60:522:663:13:Times:13:Times:B:interregional effects of taxes in Canada. These are shown in Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6. Table 3
18:523:33921:20:19:60:524:643:13:Times:13:Times:B:reports the interregional effects of replacing various components of the federal tax system
18:524:34012:19:18:60:523:624:13:Times:13:Times:B:by yield preserving neutral alternatives. Table 4 reports on the sensitivity of Table 3 results
18:525:34107:18:20:59:524:606:13:Times:13:Times:B:to alternative model specifications. Table 5 presents results on the interregional effects of
18:526:34200:20:18:59:524:586:13:Times:13:Times:B:both federal expenditures (including transfers) and taxes. Results on interregional effects
18:527:34291:18:20:59:272:568:13:Times:13:Times:B:of regional taxes are reported in Table 6.
18:528:34333:20:19:84:524:548:13:Times:13:Times:A:In all the model experiments for which results are reported, we limit ourselves to non-
18:529:34420:19:20:59:527:529:13:Times:13:Times:B:energy and non-trade taxes. The former removes from our analysis the regional effects of
18:530:34508:20:19:59:524:509:13:Times:13:Times:B:product specific energy taxes which have large interregional effects in the 1981 base year
18:531:34598:19:19:59:524:490:13:Times:13:Times:B:used for the model, but which have changed substantially since then. The latter removes
18:532:34685:19:19:59:525:471:13:Times:13:Times:B:tariffs from the analysis, which raise only small amounts of revenue but have international,
18:533:34777:19:19:59:524:452:13:Times:13:Times:B:and hence interregional, terms of trade effects. Tariffs are usually considered to be trade
18:534:34868:19:18:59:522:433:13:Times:13:Times:B:policies rather than key elements of revenue raising tax systems in advanced inudustrialized
18:535:34960:18:21:59:114:415:12:Times:12:Times:F:economies.
18:536:34970:21:20:83:525:394:13:Times:13:Times:A:The regional effects of individual taxes do not appear in the form of a neat division
18:537:35055:20:18:59:524:374:13:Times:13:Times:B:between, say, manufacturing and hinterland, resource and non-resource, or rich and poor
18:538:35142:18:20:59:525:356:13:Times:13:Times:B:regions.' This is because all these regional differences come into play in determining the
18:539:35232:20:19:59:524:336:13:Times:13:Times:B:net outcome when any particular tax is changed. For the federal tax system in total, one
18:540:35320:19:19:59:526:317:14:Times:14:Times:C:interregional effect appears to be dominant: that poorer, (i.e. lower income per capita),
18:541:35409:19:19:59:525:298:14:Times:14:Times:C:regions gain from the tax system at the expense of the richer regions. This effect is
18:542:35494:19:20:59:414:279:13:Times:13:Times:B:compounded by the inter- regional effects of federal transfer policies.
18:543:35565:20:19:83:524:259:13:Times:13:Times:A:Case 1 of Table 3 considers the replacement of the federal manufacturers sales tax
18:544:35647:19:19:59:528:240:13:Times:13:Times:B:with a yield-preserving uniform rate final sales tax covering all goods. The welfare effects of
18:545:35742:19:19:59:525:221:13:Times:13:Times:B:the change are reported in terms of Hicksian equivalent variations for the original residents
18:546:35835:19:28:59:524:202:13:Times:13:Times:B:of each region.2 The value in parentheses for each region gives the equivalent variation as
18:547:35926:28:22:71:523:174:12:Times:13:Times:A:1 1981per capita incomes for Atlantic Canada, Quebec, Ontario, Man./Sask., Alberta,
18:548:36009:22:20:59:524:152:13:Times:13:Times:B:and British Columbia, respectively, implied by the data used in the model, are: $10,410;
18:549:36097:20:13:59:286:132:12:Times:12:Times:F:$13,585; $14,791; $13,669; $18,130; $15,303.
18:550:36141:13:19:71:523:119:13:Times:13:Times:A:2 If the residents of regions who remainfollowing any tax change are used instead, the
18:551:36227:19:20:58:526:100:13:Times:13:Times:B:differences in welfare results are small both in this case and in all other experiments. We
18:552:36318:20:30:59:507:80:13:Times:13:Times:B:therefore consistently report results only for the total original residents of each region.

20:655:38161:20:19:86:529:668:13:Times:13:Times:A:Ontario gains $488 million from this change, Quebec $3 million, while all other regions
20:656:38248:19:19:62:527:649:13:Times:13:Times:B:lose. B.C. loses $76 million while the others each lose over $100 million. All regions suffer
20:657:38341:19:19:62:528:630:14:Times:14:Times:C:a terms-of-trade deterioration, since the sales tax applies more heavily to commodities
20:658:38428:19:19:62:529:611:14:Times:14:Times:C:which Canada imports, and the model uses a non-small economy assumption. Ontario
20:659:38508:19:20:63:527:592:13:Times:13:Times:B:and Quebec gain from the replacement of a tax concentrated on manufacturing by a more
20:660:38593:20:20:63:159:572:13:Times:13:Times:B:broadly based tax.
20:661:38611:20:18:87:526:552:13:Times:13:Times:A:Case 2 of Table 3 reports the interregional effects of replacing the federal personal
20:662:38696:18:19:63:528:534:14:Times:14:Times:C:income tax by a yield preserving sales tax. Replacing this tax in this way results in
20:663:38781:19:19:63:528:515:13:Times:13:Times:B:a gain for the high income regions---Ontario, Alberta and B.C.—- and a loss for the low
20:664:38868:19:19:63:530:496:14:Times:14:Times:C:income regions. The small overall gain to Canada reflects the fact that this model does
20:665:38955:19:20:63:529:477:13:Times:13:Times:B:not explicitly incorporate labour supply and savings effects of taxes. Thus, in this model
20:666:39045:20:20:63:471:457:13:Times:13:Times:B:the personal income tax redistributes without imposing major distorting costs.
20:667:39123:20:19:87:528:437:14:Times:14:Times:C:Case 3 reports results from replacing the corporate income tax on all non-energy
20:668:39203:19:19:63:530:418:13:Times:13:Times:B:industries. In contrast to cases 1 and 2, the replacement involves a yield-preserving tax on
20:669:39295:19:19:63:529:399:13:Times:13:Times:B:value added (rewards to factor inputs) within each region, and the change is made under an
20:670:39385:19:19:64:530:380:13:Times:13:Times:A:assumed international immobility of capital. This replacement tax is used since the policy
20:671:39475:19:20:63:527:361:13:Times:13:Times:B:change involves the removal of production side taxes. International capital immobility is
20:672:39564:20:19:64:528:341:13:Times:13:Times:A:assumed in order to weaken any international terms-of-trade effects which arise in this case
20:673:39656:19:20:64:295:322:13:Times:13:Times:A:due to the non-small economy assumptions.1
20:674:39698:20:19:88:528:302:13:Times:13:Times:A:The results indicate welfare gains for all regions, except Alberta. While Ontario shows
20:675:39785:19:19:64:530:283:14:Times:14:Times:C:the largest terms-of-trade deterioration, it is the largest gainer from the change. This is
20:676:39876:19:19:64:527:264:14:Times:14:Times:C:because Ontario is the largest producer of manufacturers in Canada, and this industry
20:677:39961:19:19:64:531:245:13:Times:13:Times:A:group is where incorporation is the heaviest. While Alberta has the largest terms-of-trade
20:678:40051:19:19:64:529:226:13:Times:13:Times:A:gain, it loses the most because of the large corporate taxes on the energy industry (which
20:679:40141:19:20:65:152:207:13:Times:13:Times:A:remain in place).
20:680:40158:20:19:89:530:187:13:Times:13:Times:A:Case 4involvesthe removal of all federal non-energy taxes, excluding those of cases
20:681:40241:19:19:65:531:168:14:Times:14:Times:C:1, 2, and 3, and excluding the federal tariff. The most important taxes removed in this
20:682:40328:19:19:65:530:149:13:Times:13:Times:A:case are the excise taxes. The results here show losses for the hinterland regions, with the
20:683:40420:19:19:65:530:130:13:Times:13:Times:A:exception of Atlantic Canada, suggesting the major tax effects enter through demand side
20:684:40508:19:29:65:486:111:13:Times:13:Times:A:effects across regions via differential regional consumption of taxed commodities.
20:685:40590:29:30:89:495:82:13:Times:13:Times:A:Sensitivity of the model results to these model features is reported in Table 4.

21:687:40672:0:19:97:539:701:14:Times:14:Times:C:Case 5 reports the interregional impacts of removing all federal non-energy taxes,
21:688:40754:19:19:74:539:682:14:Times:14:Times:C:excluding tariffs and all corporate taxes on the energy industry. Capital is treated as
21:689:40841:19:19:74:539:663:14:Times:14:Times:C:internationally immobile in this experiment, and the replacement tax is an equal yield
21:690:40927:19:20:73:539:644:13:Times:13:Times:A:sales tax. All regions lose, except Ontario and B.C. While Ontario is the largest gainer,
21:691:41016:20:22:74:213:624:13:Times:13:Times:A:Quebec is the largest loser.
21:692:41044:22:19:98:539:602:13:Times:13:Times:A:Since case 5 involves the same policies as considered separately in cases 1 through 4
21:693:41129:19:19:74:539:583:13:Times:13:Times:A:combined, the results are approximately the sum of those from the individual cases. The
21:694:41216:19:19:74:539:564:13:Times:13:Times:A:large gain to Ontario arises mainly because of the removal of the personal income tax, while
21:695:41308:19:19:74:537:545:13:Times:13:Times:A:smaller gains occur from the removal of the manufactures' sales tax and "other" taxes. The
21:696:41398:19:19:74:539:526:13:Times:13:Times:A:cases for which Quebec loses are the removal of the personal income tax and the removal
21:697:41485:19:20:74:541:507:14:Times:14:Times:C:of "other" taxes. The large loss to Canada as a whole in case 5 can be explained by the
21:698:41572:20:19:74:538:487:13:Times:13:Times:A:removal of "other" taxes with which there is an associated terms of trade deterioration.
21:699:41660:19:19:74:539:468:13:Times:13:Times:A:Case 5 also differs from cases 1 to 4 in its combination of assumptions underlying the tax
21:700:41750:19:19:74:540:449:13:Times:13:Times:A:change. For this experiment the change is made with capital internationally immobile and
21:701:41838:19:23:74:225:430:13:Times:13:Times:A:with an equal yield sales tax.
21:702:41868:23:19:98:539:407:13:Times:13:Times:A:Table 4 reports results for case 5 from Table 3 for which alternative assumptions have
21:703:41954:19:19:74:539:388:13:Times:13:Times:A:been used: Case 1 reports the results for case 5 if an equal yield factor tax is used in the
21:704:42046:19:19:74:541:369:13:Times:13:Times:A:policy replacement, case 2 for the case if capital is internationally mobile, cases 3 and 4
21:705:42137:19:23:74:396:350:13:Times:13:Times:A:for alternative values of Canadian import demand elasticities.
21:706:42199:23:19:98:540:327:14:Times:14:Times:C:The losses for Canada reported in case 1 are similar to those of case 5 of Table 3.
21:707:42282:19:19:74:541:308:13:Times:13:Times:A:The major difference from using alternative tax replacement schemes is in the allocation of
21:708:42373:19:19:74:540:289:13:Times:13:Times:A:gains and losses by regions; in this case gains are larger or losses smaller for every region
21:709:42466:19:22:74:250:270:13:Times:13:Times:A:except Alberta, which loses more.
21:710:42499:22:19:98:540:248:14:Times:14:Times:C:Case 2 differs most in the estimated total welfare change for Canada. The loss to
21:711:42580:19:19:75:539:229:13:Times:13:Times:A:Canada increases by over $500 million due to substantially different terms of trade effects.
21:712:42672:19:19:75:540:210:13:Times:13:Times:A:In case 2, the terms of trade deterioration is higher for Canadian regions, while the terms
21:713:42763:19:19:74:540:191:13:Times:13:Times:A:of trade improvement for the ROW is larger. Under an international capital immobility
21:714:42848:19:19:75:542:172:13:Times:13:Times:A:assumption, federal capital taxes are borne by the Canadian regions. Under an alternative
21:715:42937:19:19:75:541:153:13:Times:13:Times:A:international capital mobility assumption, some of the burden of these taxes are shifted

23:806:44683:19:19:72:535:646:13:Times:13:Times:A:increases and the terms-of-trade improvement for the ROW decreases. This is because
23:807:44766:19:20:72:423:627:13:Times:13:Times:A:Canada moves closer to being a price-taker in world goods markets.
23:808:44832:20:19:95:537:607:13:Times:13:Times:A:Table 5 reports results from policy experiments in which federal government expen-
23:809:44914:19:19:72:538:588:13:Times:13:Times:A:ditures as well as tax policies are changed. For these experiments, we report the effects of
23:810:45006:19:19:72:535:569:13:Times:13:Times:A:policy changes on labour mobility instead of the terms-of-trade effects, in part to demon-
23:811:45096:19:19:71:536:550:13:Times:13:Times:A:strate the model's capability to yield estimated impacts on interregional migration. The
23:812:45184:19:20:72:536:531:14:Times:14:Times:C:net labour migration into each region is reported as the total labour inflow from other
23:813:45271:20:19:72:534:511:13:Times:13:Times:A:regions minus the outflow from the region. The units are millions of 1981 dollars of labour
23:814:45362:19:19:72:536:492:13:Times:13:Times:A:income, and are measured in terms of the labour units in each region implicit in the bench-
23:815:45453:19:20:71:537:473:14:Times:14:Times:C:mark equilibrium data set. The actual values reported for these cases are small due to
23:816:45539:20:19:71:537:453:13:Times:13:Times:A:a relatively small value of the labour mobility elasticity parameter used,1 reflecting the
23:817:45629:19:20:71:405:434:13:Times:13:Times:A:assumption that labour is only partially mobile between regions.
23:818:45693:20:19:95:537:414:13:Times:13:Times:A:Cases 1, 2, and 3 report results of changing various elements of the federal govern-
23:819:45777:19:20:71:536:395:13:Times:13:Times:A:ment's system of transfers to the regions. These transfers include Equalization payments,
23:820:45866:20:19:71:536:375:13:Times:13:Times:A:the Canada Assistance Plan, and the Established Programs Financing (Health Care and
23:821:45949:19:19:71:535:356:13:Times:13:Times:A:Post Secondary Education). In case 1, intergovernmental transfers from the federal gov-
23:822:46036:19:19:71:536:337:13:Times:13:Times:A:ernment to regional governments are removed, with federal expenditures kept constant
23:823:46120:19:19:71:449:318:13:Times:13:Times:A:through an equal yield subsidy applying to final purchases in all regions.
23:824:46194:19:19:95:536:299:13:Times:13:Times:A:Removal of these programs results in gains for the high income provinces (Ontario,
23:825:46276:19:19:71:535:280:13:Times:13:Times:A:Alberta, and B.C.) and losses to the low income regions (Atlantic Canada, Quebec, and
23:826:46361:19:19:71:536:261:14:Times:14:Times:C:Manitoba/Saskatchewan). The large losses for Quebec, and in particular for Atlantic
23:827:46444:19:19:71:536:242:13:Times:13:Times:A:Canada, are due to the regional concentration of the Equalization program on these two
23:828:46530:19:21:71:537:223:14:Times:14:Times:C:regions. The pattern of migration follows that of welfare gains or losses, since labour
23:829:46617:21:19:71:511:202:13:Times:13:Times:A:migrates from the major Equalization receiving regions to the higher income regions.
23:830:46701:19:19:95:537:183:13:Times:13:Times:A:Case 2 involves the removal of federal government transfers to persons using an equal
23:831:46786:19:19:71:534:164:13:Times:13:Times:A:yield replacement as in case 1. These transfers include old age security, unemployment
23:832:46872:19:31:72:538:145:13:Times:13:Times:A:insurance (UI), and welfare. All regions except Alberta and B.C. lose when these transfers
23:833:46962:31:19:96:536:114:13:Times:13:Times:A:We use a value of 0.05 as the elasticity of the number of people who wish to remain

25:957:48654:0:19:78:544:703:13:Times:13:Times:A:arc removed. Atlantic Canada loses the most, reflecting the concentration of UI and welfare
25:958:48745:19:20:78:543:684:13:Times:13:Times:A:payments in this region. Ontario loses since it has an older population and receives a large
25:959:48837:20:20:78:543:664:13:Times:13:Times:A:sli are of these transfers. Outward labour migration again generally occurs from the welfare
25:960:48929:20:18:78:151:644:12:Times:12:Times:F:losing regions.
25:961:48944:18:19:102:543:626:13:Times:13:Times:A:Case 3 reports results for the joint removal of both intergovernmental and interper-
25:962:49028:19:19:78:544:607:13:Times:13:Times:A:sonal transfers. Welfare effects and net labour flows for each region are approximately the
25:963:49119:19:20:78:544:588:13:Times:13:Times:A:sum of the results from cases 1 and 2, indicating no major interaction between these two
25:964:49207:20:18:78:156:568:13:Times:13:Times:A:policy changes.
25:965:49222:18:20:102:542:550:13:Times:13:Times:A:Case 4 involves the simultaneous removal of federal taxes as in case 5 of Table 3, and
25:966:49308:20:19:78:544:530:13:Times:13:Times:A:the removal of all intergovernmental and interpersonal transfers as in case 3 of this table.
25:967:49400:19:19:78:541:511:14:Times:14:Times:C:The welfare results are approximately the sum of those for the two cases. Major gains
25:968:49485:19:19:78:438:492:13:Times:13:Times:A:accrue to higher income regions, with losses for lower income regions.
25:969:49555:19:19:101:544:473:13:Times:13:Times:A:Table 6 reports the results of various changes in regional taxes. In case 1 we duplicate,
25:970:49644:19:20:77:543:454:14:Times:14:Times:C:at a regional level, the federal policy change for case 5 of Table 3. Non-energy taxes,
25:971:49731:20:18:77:543:434:13:Times:13:Times:A:excluding corporate taxes on the energy industry, are replaced in each region by a yield-
25:972:49820:18:19:77:542:416:14:Times:14:Times:C:preserving sales tax. Capital is assumed internationally immobile, and since the rates
25:973:49906:19:20:78:408:397:13:Times:13:Times:A:modelled here are low, interregional tariff barriers are removed.
25:974:49971:20:18:102:542:377:14:Times:14:Times:C:The results indicate that all regions except Atlantic Canada and Alberta lose from
25:975:50053:18:21:77:542:359:13:Times:13:Times:A:this change. Ontario's loss of $1.6 billion and the losses of $642 million and $448 million
25:976:50144:21:18:77:544:338:14:Times:14:Times:C:for Quebec and B.C., respectively, outweigh the gains to other regions and, as a result,
25:977:50232:18:19:77:542:320:14:Times:14:Times:C:Canada in total loses. These results indicate that regional tax systems benefit Canada,
25:978:50319:19:19:77:543:301:13:Times:13:Times:A:due to the impact of the regional taxes on international terms of trade, with the greatest
25:979:50409:19:20:77:223:282:13:Times:13:Times:A:benefit accruing to Ontario.
25:980:50437:20:19:102:544:262:13:Times:13:Times:A:Case 2 reports results for a similar change except that only the personal income tax,
25:981:50522:19:19:77:544:243:14:Times:14:Times:C:corporate income tax (excluding taxes on the energy industry), and indirect taxes are
25:982:50607:19:18:78:541:224:13:Times:13:Times:A:replaced in each region. These results indicate that over one-half of the impact on Ontario
25:983:50698:18:20:78:289:206:13:Times:13:Times:A:in case 1 is accounted for by these taxes.
25:984:50740:20:19:102:542:186:13:Times:13:Times:A:Cases 3 and 4 duplicate the tax changes considered in cases 1 and 2, respectively, but
25:985:50826:19:19:77:543:167:14:Times:14:Times:C:only Ontario's taxes are altered. The results for the case 3 change show a large loss for
25:986:50915:19:19:78:543:148:13:Times:13:Times:A:Ontario, with Quebec gaining the most, and overall Canada loses from the change. Case
25:987:51000:19:19:78:545:129:13:Times:13:Times:A:4 shows that the three tax components considered account for most of both Ontario's loss
25:988:51088:19:64:78:279:110:13:Times:13:Times:A:in case 3, and the other regions' gains.

27:1035:52487:24:18:70:534:679:14:Times:14:Times:C:This paper reports on an attempt to use an applied general equilibrium regional model
27:1036:52572:18:19:70:535:661:13:Times:13:Times:A:for Canada to investigate the regional effects of taxes. In the paper, literature on regional
27:1037:52665:19:21:70:534:642:13:Times:13:Times:A:tax effects is reviewed and the main features of the model are briefly described. Existing
27:1038:52755:21:19:70:536:621:13:Times:13:Times:A:literature on regional tax effects is largely non-quantitative, and does not take up several
27:1039:52847:19:19:70:536:602:13:Times:13:Times:A:important features, such as taxes which are predominantly on products or industries lo-
27:1040:52934:19:19:70:534:583:13:Times:13:Times:A:cated in particular regions. Results suggest that regional effects of taxes can be significant,
27:1041:53029:19:19:70:536:564:13:Times:13:Times:A:and in the Canadian case at least, do not tend to counterbalance one another. In general,
27:1042:53118:19:19:70:535:545:13:Times:13:Times:A:richer regions tend to lose and poorer regions gain from federal taxes, but other regional
27:1043:53208:19:20:70:532:526:13:Times:13:Times:A:characteristics such as manufacturing/non-manufacturing, or resource/non-resource can
27:1044:53293:20:461:70:141:506:13:Times:13:Times:A:be important.

28:1048:53347:24:19:89:530:663:13:Times:13:Times:A:A novel feature of the model, and one which differentiates it from other applied gen-
28:1049:53432:19:19:65:528:644:13:Times:13:Times:A:eral equilibrium models, is its treatment of labour mobility between regions. We assume
28:1050:53519:19:20:65:529:625:13:Times:13:Times:A:that there is a distribution of individuals within each region who differ only by their in-
28:1051:53610:20:19:65:530:605:13:Times:13:Times:A:tensity of locational preference. Their utility function parameters reflect this difference in
28:1052:53704:19:23:65:493:586:13:Times:13:Times:A:a systematic way across the original (pre-policy change) population in each region.
28:1053:53787:23:18:89:529:563:13:Times:13:Times:A:The utility function for any agent in any region is specified as the maximum of two
28:1054:53870:18:19:65:530:545:13:Times:13:Times:A:separate subutility functions. This is described in Section 1 of Table A-i. The U111 function
28:1055:53963:19:20:65:530:526:14:Times:14:Times:C:gives the utility from consuming a given bundle of goods if individual i remains in his
28:1056:54050:20:18:65:530:506:13:Times:13:Times:A:original region. The UIF function gives the utility from consuming the same bundle of goods
28:1057:54141:18:20:65:527:488:13:Times:13:Times:A:if the individual moves outside the region. If it is assumed that all individuals are identical
28:1058:54236:20:19:65:527:468:13:Times:13:Times:A:within any region, then in response to a changed income differential between regions all
28:1059:54324:19:19:65:527:449:13:Times:13:Times:A:individuals in a region would either leave or stay, and no partial labour mobility would
28:1060:54412:19:19:64:528:430:13:Times:13:Times:A:occur. To incorporate partial mobility, the U1F' function is assumed to vary systematically
28:1061:54503:19:20:64:529:411:13:Times:13:Times:A:across individuals within a region, who are ranked in terms of their intensity of locational
28:1062:54595:20:19:65:527:391:13:Times:13:Times:A:preference. The U' function thus incorporates the locational penalty which individuals are
28:1063:54685:19:20:64:530:372:13:Times:13:Times:A:assumed to bear should they leave and which is of increasing severity across individuals.
28:1064:54774:20:18:64:529:352:13:Times:13:Times:A:To simplify things, the strong assumption is made that an individual leaving one region
28:1065:54861:18:19:64:528:334:13:Times:13:Times:A:and moving to another maintains the same preference structure across goods associated
28:1066:54946:19:19:64:529:315:13:Times:13:Times:A:with all residents in his original region. Individuals do not therefore acquire the preferences
28:1067:55041:19:25:64:309:296:13:Times:13:Times:A:of residents of the other region after relocating.
28:1068:55091:25:18:88:530:271:14:Times:14:Times:C:These features, and an assumption that goods prices faced by each region are the
28:1069:55171:18:19:64:527:253:13:Times:13:Times:A:same, allow us to employ the two indirect utility functions shown in Section 2 of Table
28:1070:55258:19:19:64:530:234:14:Times:14:Times:C:A-i in determining an individual's location decision. U0" gives the utility from goods
28:1071:55344:19:19:64:529:215:13:Times:13:Times:A:consumption if individual 0 remains in the region. Since the subfunction U11' does not
28:1072:55430:19:14:64:530:196:14:Times:14:Times:C:reflect any locational preference (there is no penalty for staying in the home region),
28:1073:55517:14:28:64:111:182:9:Times:14:Helvetica:C:TTH —— a
28:1074:55525:28:20:88:528:154:13:Times:13:Times:A:Location preferences enter through the function Us', which varies systematically across
28:1075:55612:20:19:64:528:134:14:Times:13:Times:A:the initial population within any region. The parameter t,shownin Section 3 of Table
28:1076:55696:19:18:64:529:115:13:Times:13:Times:A:A-i, reflects the utility penalty any individual incurs under out-migration. The product of
28:1077:55787:18:19:64:528:97:13:Times:13:Times:A:the parameter and the index i defines the intensity of locational preferences as one moves

30:1117:57098:20:19:64:529:685:13:Times:13:Times:A:on the margin between staying and leaving. All others are beyond the margin and have
30:1118:57182:19:18:64:529:666:13:Times:13:Times:A:an unambiguous preference for remaining in their region of residence. If relative incomes
30:1119:57271:18:19:63:529:648:13:Times:13:Times:B:change across regions, then some residents will be induced to relocate because the income
30:1120:57360:19:19:63:408:629:13:Times:13:Times:B:differential across regions will outweigh their locational preference.
30:1121:57430:19:20:87:526:610:13:Times:13:Times:A:In Section 4 of Table A-i, when a decrease in income in the home region occurs, U.1"
30:1122:57514:20:19:63:526:590:13:Times:13:Times:B:shifts down as indicated, and some of the individuals initially in the region leave. Out-
30:1123:57603:19:18:63:527:571:13:Times:13:Times:B:migration will also occur when an increase in income in other regions results in an upward
30:1124:57693:18:20:63:528:553:14:Times:13:Times:B:shift in u!'.Inboth cases, the size of out-migration depends upon the slope of the function,
30:1125:57785:20:20:63:527:533:13:Times:13:Times:B:which in turn depends on the parameter S. A simple fixed coefficient treatment is used
30:1126:57871:20:18:63:529:513:13:Times:13:Times:B:to specify how individuals leaving a region locate in other regions, but a CES distribution
30:1127:57962:18:20:63:207:495:13:Times:13:Times:B:function could also be used.
30:1128:57990:20:19:87:528:475:13:Times:13:Times:A:In this way the model captures the effects on migration decisions of regional differences
30:1129:58079:19:408:63:390:456:13:Times:13:Times:B:in wage rates, transfer payments to regions, and regional taxes.
