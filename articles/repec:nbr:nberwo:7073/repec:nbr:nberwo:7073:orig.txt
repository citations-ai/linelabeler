3:0:0:0:24:108:521:698:12:Times:12:Times:The 1990’s economic boom has made the American job market the envy of the world.
3:1:80:24:24:72:512:674:12:Times:12:Times:The proportion of the adult population that is employed has increased to the highest level in
3:2:173:24:24:72:538:650:12:Times:12:Times:history.  Unemployment has fallen far below the 6 to 7 percent that many economists and policy-
3:3:268:24:24:72:530:626:12:Times:12:Times:makers believed was the NAIRU (non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment) rate. While
3:4:359:24:24:72:525:602:12:Times:12:Times:throughout much of the 1980’s and 1990’s, real wages of workers stagnated, in the late 1990’s
3:5:452:24:24:72:518:578:12:Times:12:Times:real wages began to rise, and at least some workers in the bottom of the distribution had their
3:6:547:24:24:72:469:554:12:Times:12:Times:first gains in real earnings after years of decline (Economic Policy Institute, 1998).
3:7:633:24:24:108:532:530:12:Times:12:Times:To what extent has the 1990’s boom improved the labor market outcomes of young non-
3:8:716:24:24:72:531:506:12:Times:12:Times:college-educated men?  How much has the boom helped young African American men who are
3:9:802:24:24:72:379:482:12:Times:12:Times:the most disadvantaged and socially troubled group in the U.S.?
3:10:865:24:24:108:528:458:12:Times:12:Times:Previous economic booms have raised employment of young men and often raised their
3:11:947:24:24:72:504:434:12:Times:12:Times:earnings as well.1 Turning to our second issue, there is a large literature that links crime to
3:12:1042:24:24:72:534:410:12:Times:12:Times:economic conditions (see the review by Freeman (1999)).  Most studies find that unemployment
3:13:1134:24:24:72:520:386:12:Times:12:Times:has a moderate effect on crime and that persons who engage in crime have a somewhat lower
3:14:1223:24:24:72:537:362:12:Times:12:Times:employment than otherwise comparable young persons not involved in crime. The large increase
3:15:1315:24:24:72:528:338:12:Times:12:Times:in incarceration and drop in the crime rate in the 1990s raises two questions: whether the fall in
3:16:1413:24:24:72:494:314:12:Times:12:Times:crime is due in part to the tighter labor market as opposed to, or in addition to the rise in
3:17:1506:24:24:72:498:290:12:Times:12:Times:incarceration; and whether the incarceration leads to a less employable work force of ex-
3:18:1595:24:24:72:119:266:12:Times:12:Times:prisoners.
3:19:1605:24:24:108:522:242:12:Times:12:Times:   But the 1990s has been a period when the relation between unemployment and other
3:20:1688:24:24:72:525:218:12:Times:12:Times:economic outcomes has surprised many analysts.  Low rates of unemployment have generated
3:21:1776:24:24:72:505:194:12:Times:12:Times:smaller increases in wages than in previous economic booms.  From the perspective of the
3:22:1864:24:24:72:540:170:12:Times:12:Times:aggregate economy, this is good news, since it has convinced monetary authorities to forego anti-
3:23:1961:24:24:72:535:146:12:Times:12:Times:inflationary policies that would end or dampen the boom.  But from the perspective of economic
3:24:2055:24:24:72:536:122:12:Times:12:Times:disparity and the well-being of young low paid and less skilled workers, it could be bad news.  If
3:25:2153:24:24:72:532:98:12:Times:12:Times:the boom of the late 1990’s was insufficient to improve substantially the position of young non-
3:26:2249:24:0:72:512:74:12:Times:12:Times:college-educated workers, it is difficult to imagine that any expansion could do so, and thus
4:27:2342:0:24:72:475:698:12:Times:12:Times:would dash any hope that economic growth per se could raise their pay and income.
4:28:2423:24:24:108:529:674:12:Times:12:Times:This paper examines the effect of the 1990’s boom on young non-college-educated men
4:29:2506:24:24:72:521:650:12:Times:12:Times:and the relation between their economic position and crime and incarceration. One factor that
4:30:2599:24:24:72:536:626:12:Times:12:Times:differentiates young non-college-educated men in the 1990’s compared to the past is their rate of
4:31:2696:24:24:72:514:602:12:Times:12:Times:criminal involvement and incarceration.  Crime rates peaked at the end of the 1980’s but the
4:32:2788:24:24:72:516:578:12:Times:12:Times:number of young non-college-educated men who were incarcerated rose, particularly among
4:33:2875:24:24:72:519:554:12:Times:12:Times:African Americans, possibly altering the relation between the boom and the employment and
4:34:2964:24:24:72:520:530:12:Times:12:Times:earnings of those in the civilian population from what it was in the past.2  Because time series
4:35:3060:24:24:72:508:506:12:Times:12:Times:data on the 1990s boom are necessarily limited, we use variation in the level and change in
4:36:3151:24:24:72:510:482:12:Times:12:Times:joblessness across metropolitan areas to assess the contribution of market conditions on the
4:37:3243:24:24:72:525:458:12:Times:12:Times:position of young workers. Unemployment rates differ greatly and have changed differentially
4:38:3335:24:24:72:530:434:12:Times:12:Times:among areas, providing considerable variation in economic conditions from which to assess the
4:39:3428:24:24:72:531:410:12:Times:12:Times:effect of market conditions on youth unemployment.  Similarly, there is wide variation in crime
4:40:3523:24:24:72:535:386:12:Times:12:Times:rates across areas (Glaeser, Sacerdote, and Scheinkman, 1995) that can be used to assess the link
4:41:3620:24:24:72:499:362:12:Times:12:Times:between crime and youth labor market outcomes.  While our main focus is on young less
4:42:3705:24:24:72:461:338:12:Times:12:Times:educated young men, we present information on older less educated men as well.
4:43:3783:24:24:90:190:314:12:Times:12:Times:The paper finds that:
4:44:3804:24:24:90:489:290:12:Times:12:Times:1. Young men in tight labor markets in the 1990s experienced a noticeable boost in
4:45:3886:24:24:72:497:266:12:Times:12:Times:employment and earnings, while adult men had no such gains.  Earnings of adults barely
4:46:3972:24:24:72:497:242:12:Times:12:Times:changed even in metropolitan areas with unemployment rates below 4 percent, while the
4:47:4057:24:24:72:516:218:12:Times:12:Times:earnings of youths, including disadvantaged African American youths improved.  Youths do
4:48:4145:24:24:72:534:194:12:Times:12:Times:particularly well in areas that started the boom at lower jobless rates, suggesting that they would
4:49:4244:24:24:72:319:170:12:Times:12:Times:benefit especially from consistent full employment.
4:50:4295:24:24:90:512:146:12:Times:12:Times:2.  Crime rates fell most rapidly in states where unemployment fell most, supporting the
4:51:4383:24:24:72:535:122:12:Times:12:Times:notion that unemployment affects crime (Freeman, 1999).  At the same time, youths have higher
4:52:4476:24:0:72:531:98:12:Times:12:Times:earnings and employment in low crime states and incarcerations per youth are adversely related
5:53:4570:0:24:72:517:698:12:Times:12:Times:to labor market outcomes, which suggests that past criminal activity may affect outcomes, as
5:54:4662:24:24:72:475:674:12:Times:12:Times:well, with youths with criminal records having greater difficulties in the job market.
5:55:4748:24:24:72:97:650:12:Times:12:Times:Data
5:56:4752:24:24:108:531:626:12:Times:12:Times:We utilize three data sources. The first are the Merged Outgoing Rotation Groups of the
5:57:4839:24:24:72:514:602:12:Times:12:Times:Current Population Survey, 1983, 1987, 1989, 1992, 1996, and 1998.  These years cover the
5:58:4928:24:24:72:522:578:12:Times:12:Times:beginning and peak of the 1980s expansion (1983-1989) and six years of the 1990s expansion
5:59:5018:24:24:72:529:554:12:Times:12:Times:(1992-1998).  Our youth sample includes 16 to 24 year old men; our adults are defined as 25 to
5:60:5112:24:24:72:530:530:12:Times:12:Times:64 year old men.  We exclude youths in school.  In the first four cross sections, our samples are
5:61:5209:24:24:72:525:506:12:Times:12:Times:based on responses to the Employment Status Recode (ESR) variable. Every individual whose
5:62:5298:24:24:72:521:482:12:Times:12:Times:major activity is in school was dropped.  The unemployment rate is the ratio of the number of
5:63:5391:24:24:72:522:458:12:Times:12:Times:people looking for work to the sum of the number looking for work, the number working, and
5:64:5481:24:24:72:501:434:12:Times:12:Times:the number with a job but not working.  The statistics for 1996 and 1998 are based on the
5:65:5570:24:24:72:516:410:12:Times:12:Times:monthly labor force recode (MLR) variable. Unlike the ESR variable that classified those on
5:66:5661:24:24:72:515:386:12:Times:12:Times:layoff as employed, this recode classifies those on layoff as unemployed. The change has no
5:67:5752:24:24:72:537:362:12:Times:12:Times:impact on the estimates because the share of workers on layoff is typically less than .5 percent of
5:68:5851:24:24:72:520:338:12:Times:12:Times:the civilian population. The employment-population ratio is the ratio of the number of people
5:69:5944:24:24:72:518:314:12:Times:12:Times:working and the number with a job but not working to the sum of those two numbers and the
5:70:6033:24:24:72:216:290:12:Times:12:Times:number out of the labor force.
5:71:6063:24:24:108:529:266:12:Times:12:Times:We constructed the natural logarithm of real hourly earnings using the respondent’s pay
5:72:6150:24:24:72:531:242:12:Times:12:Times:status. If the respondent reported that they are paid on an hourly basis, we took the logarithm of
5:73:6248:24:24:72:519:218:12:Times:12:Times:their hourly wage. If the respondent was paid on a weekly basis, we took the logarithm of the
5:74:6341:24:24:72:512:194:12:Times:12:Times:ratio of their usual weekly earnings and usual hours worked per week. We deflated nominal
5:75:6430:24:24:72:280:170:12:Times:12:Times:hourly wages using the CPI-UX-1 deflator.
5:76:6471:24:24:90:530:146:12:Times:12:Times:The area unemployment rates come from various editions of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’
5:77:6560:24:24:72:513:122:12:Times:12:Times:Employment and Earnings and Geographic Profile of Employment and Unemployment. For
5:78:6635:24:0:72:526:98:12:Times:12:Times:1983, Metropolitan denotes standard metropolitan statistical areas (SMSAs). In all other years,
6:79:6730:0:24:72:498:698:12:Times:12:Times:Metropolitan corresponds to metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), primary metropolitan
6:80:6817:24:24:72:515:674:12:Times:12:Times:statistical areas, and consolidated metropolitan statistical areas. For the 1983 published data,
6:81:6913:24:24:72:521:650:12:Times:12:Times:Metropolitan denotes standard metropolitan statistical areas (SMSAs) and we are only able to
6:82:7005:24:24:72:521:626:12:Times:12:Times:identify 44 areas. In all other years, Metropolitan corresponds to metropolitan statistical areas
6:83:7102:24:24:72:525:602:12:Times:12:Times:(MSAs), primary metropolitan statistical areas, and consolidated metropolitan statistical areas.
6:84:7198:24:24:72:539:578:12:Times:12:Times:For the 1987, 1989 and 1992 published data 212 areas can be identified.  For 1996 and 1998, 334
6:85:7293:24:24:72:535:554:12:Times:12:Times:areas are identifiable.   In some calculations we categorize the areas as having an unemployment
6:86:7389:24:24:72:515:530:12:Times:12:Times:rate below 4 percent, 4 to 5 percent, 5 to 6 percent, 6 to 7 percent and greater than 7 percent.

6:92:7914:24:24:72:533:386:12:Times:12:Times:Statistic: 1996.  The national incarceration rate for 1997 comes from Bureau of Justice Statistics
6:93:8008:24:24:72:510:362:12:Times:12:Times:Prisoners in 1996. To construct state crime per youth and state incarcerations per youth, we
6:94:8098:24:24:72:509:338:12:Times:12:Times:divide the crime and incarceration rates by a state’s residents that are 16 to 24 years of age.
6:95:8193:24:24:72:175:314:12:Times:12:Times:Aggregate Relations
6:96:8212:24:24:90:534:290:12:Times:12:Times:Before presenting our area analysis, we review briefly the pattern of change in the aggregate
6:97:8305:24:24:72:512:266:12:Times:12:Times:national data that represents the phenomenon we want to explain.  Figures 1 to 6 (Appendix
6:98:8395:24:24:72:535:242:12:Times:12:Times:Table A1) show unemployment rates, employment-population ratios, hourly earnings, crime and
6:99:8486:24:24:72:525:218:12:Times:12:Times:incarceration rates in the 1980s expansion (1983 to 1989) and in the 1990s expansion (1992 to
6:100:8579:24:24:72:192:194:12:Times:12:Times:1998).  These data show:
6:101:8603:24:24:90:518:170:12:Times:12:Times:-Substantial falls in unemployment in both recessions. The unemployment rate fell for
6:102:8688:24:24:72:369:146:12:Times:12:Times:African Americans at roughly the same rate as for all persons.
6:103:8750:24:24:90:523:122:12:Times:12:Times:-A smaller rise in the employment-population ratio in the 1990s expansion, presumably
6:104:8835:24:0:72:540:98:12:Times:12:Times:due to the higher initial ratio.  The e-pop increased by 5 percentage points from 1983 to 1989 and
7:105:8933:0:24:72:518:698:12:Times:12:Times:by 2.6 points from 1992 to 1998.  The rise in the employment-to-population ratio for African
7:106:9025:24:24:72:529:674:12:Times:12:Times:Americans was somewhat larger in absolute terms: 7.4 points in the 1980s boom and 4.8 points
7:107:9117:24:24:72:164:650:12:Times:12:Times:in the 1990s boom.
7:108:9135:24:24:90:522:626:12:Times:12:Times:-A very different pattern in real hourly earnings.  Real hourly earnings fell in the 1980s
7:109:9225:24:24:72:535:602:12:Times:12:Times:recovery and fell from 1992 through 1996, then rose in 1997 and 1998, when the unemployment
7:110:9316:24:24:72:215:578:12:Times:12:Times:rate dropped below 5 percent.
7:111:9345:24:24:90:527:554:12:Times:12:Times:-A different pattern in crime rates measured by the FBI’s UCR index between the 1980s
7:112:9430:24:24:72:505:530:12:Times:12:Times:and 1990s expansions.  During the 1980s expansion, the crime rate per 100,000 increased.
7:113:9518:24:24:72:498:506:12:Times:12:Times:During the 1990s expansion, the crime rate fell. Over both periods, the incarceration rate
7:114:9608:24:24:72:485:482:12:Times:12:Times:increased.  These trends suggest that, while crime and incarceration may have cyclical
7:115:9694:24:24:72:524:458:12:Times:12:Times:components, their movements are largely dominated by other factors (the number of police on
7:116:9785:24:24:72:498:434:12:Times:12:Times:the street, enforcement policies, etc).  They can thus be used as independent non-cyclical
7:117:9875:24:24:72:479:410:12:Times:12:Times:variables in analysis designed to isolate the effects of economic booms on outcomes.
7:118:9959:24:24:90:525:386:12:Times:12:Times:The most striking evidence in Figures 5 and 6 is the extent of incarceration among African
7:119:10049:24:24:72:535:362:12:Times:12:Times:Americans. In both years and at all ages, African Americans have higher incarceration rates than
7:120:10145:24:24:72:500:338:12:Times:12:Times:whites.  In 1990 and 1996 non-Hispanic African Americans were about twice as likely as
7:121:10231:24:24:72:512:314:12:Times:12:Times:Hispanics and nearly 8 times more likely than non-Hispanic whites to be in State or Federal
7:122:10322:24:24:72:519:290:12:Times:12:Times:prison.  At year-end 1996 there were 1,571 sentenced African American inmates per 100,000
7:123:10411:24:24:72:502:266:12:Times:12:Times:African Americans in the United States, compared to 688 sentenced Hispanic inmates per
7:124:10497:24:24:72:525:242:12:Times:12:Times:100,000 Hispanics and 193 white inmates per 100,000 whites.  In 1996, 8.3 percent of African
7:125:10589:24:24:72:510:218:12:Times:12:Times:American men age 25 to 29 were in prison compared to approximately 0.8 percent of white
7:126:10676:24:24:72:534:194:12:Times:12:Times:males in the same age group.  Even though incarceration rates fall with age, the share of African
7:127:10773:24:24:72:521:170:12:Times:12:Times:American men age 45 to 54 in prison in 1996 was almost 3 percent. This value is more than 3
7:128:10864:24:24:72:532:146:12:Times:12:Times:times the size of the highest rate of 0.9 percent among white men age 30 to 34.  Based on 1980s
7:129:10959:24:24:72:521:122:12:Times:12:Times:data the Justice Department estimates that 29 percent of all African American men will spend
7:130:11051:24:0:72:536:98:12:Times:12:Times:time in prison (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 1997).  The high rate of incarceration among African
8:131:11149:0:24:72:507:698:12:Times:12:Times:American men has two effects on our data. First, it removes a substantial number of young
8:132:11238:24:24:72:520:674:12:Times:12:Times:African American men from the CPS sample. Second, it implies that an increasing number of
8:133:11327:24:24:72:514:650:12:Times:12:Times:African American men have a criminal record, which is likely to adversely affect their labor
8:134:11419:24:24:72:157:626:12:Times:12:Times:market outcomes.
8:135:11435:24:24:90:507:602:12:Times:12:Times:Turning from all men to the young less educated men of concern to this study, we have
8:136:11520:24:24:72:516:578:12:Times:12:Times:calculated their employment and earnings during the periods 1983 to 1989 and 1992 to1998,
8:137:11609:24:24:72:532:554:12:Times:12:Times:using the CPS files.  Figures 7 and 8 (Appendix Table A2) shows that in the 1980s employment
8:138:11701:24:24:72:520:530:12:Times:12:Times:rates among the non-college-educated rose but that their earnings fell. From 1992 to 1996 the
8:139:11794:24:24:72:528:506:12:Times:12:Times:pattern is similar, though the increase in employment for the younger men is greater.  But from
8:140:11889:24:24:72:534:482:12:Times:12:Times:1996 to 1998, the picture is different.  The employment for all non-college-educated men ceases
8:141:11984:24:24:72:527:458:12:Times:12:Times:to grow, but their hourly earnings finally begin to increase, and hourly earnings increases most
8:142:12080:24:24:72:284:434:12:Times:12:Times:markedly for young African American men.
8:143:12120:24:24:90:528:410:12:Times:12:Times:The aggregate data thus suggest that in the 1990s the recovery of the economy from its low
8:144:12210:24:24:72:533:386:12:Times:12:Times:point showed up first in employment and then, as unemployment fell to extremely low levels, in
8:145:12304:24:24:72:536:362:12:Times:12:Times:wages. But these data do not have sufficient variation to allow us to characterize the effect of the
8:146:12404:24:24:72:529:338:12:Times:12:Times:recovery to any greater extent. To determine further the effect of the boom on the less educated
8:147:12500:24:24:72:535:314:12:Times:12:Times:young men, we turn to data on labor market conditions and outcomes across local labor markets.
8:148:12594:24:24:72:483:290:12:Times:12:Times:For the 1990s we have 332 local labor markets, with a wide variety of unemployment
8:149:12676:24:24:72:529:266:12:Times:12:Times:experiences, ranging from continuous low unemployment to rapid reductions in unemployment
8:150:12765:24:24:72:528:242:12:Times:12:Times:to slow reductions in joblessness. These data provide us with market conditions that go beyond
8:151:12859:24:24:72:510:218:12:Times:12:Times:the 1990s boom -- rates of unemployment below 4 percent in many areas -- that allow us to
8:152:12948:24:24:72:516:194:12:Times:12:Times:assess what might happen to young workers if the aggregate economy produced even tighter
8:153:13036:24:24:72:510:170:12:Times:12:Times:labor market conditions.  Most important, it allows us to assess the effect of continued high
8:154:13129:24:24:72:521:146:12:Times:12:Times:unemployment  (below 4 percent for six ears of the expansion) on labor market outcomes and
8:155:13219:24:24:72:512:122:12:Times:12:Times:thus to gain some insight as to the effects of a continuous or near continuous boom on these
8:156:13311:24:0:72:114:98:12:Times:12:Times:workers.
9:157:13319:0:24:90:513:698:12:Times:12:Times:Generalizing from patterns of change across areas to the nation as a whole has however,
9:158:13406:24:24:72:517:674:12:Times:12:Times:some problems, because there are adjustments that occur across geographic areas that cannot
9:159:13497:24:24:72:520:650:12:Times:12:Times:occur in the nation as a whole.  In particular, migration across areas is a potentially important
9:160:13594:24:24:72:526:626:12:Times:12:Times:response to different area economic conditions.  Migration is likely to ameliorate the effects of
9:161:13691:24:24:72:526:602:12:Times:12:Times:shocks on outcomes, as affected persons move from high to low unemployment locales.   Still,
9:162:13783:24:24:72:500:578:12:Times:12:Times:Topel (1986), Blanchflower, and Oswald (1999) and others find evidence that local labor
9:163:13870:24:24:72:474:554:12:Times:12:Times:markets affect outcomes.  And young non-college-educated workers are less mobile
9:164:13950:24:24:72:511:530:12:Times:12:Times:geographically than other workers.  Another important ameliorative effect is likely to occur
9:165:14042:24:24:72:530:506:12:Times:12:Times:through product markets.  In industries where prices are set nationally, a  booming local market
9:166:14138:24:24:72:530:482:12:Times:12:Times:will be unable to raise prices in response to increases in wages, which should produce a smaller
9:167:14234:24:24:72:529:458:12:Times:12:Times:impact of low unemployment on wages than would be observed in a national boom.  These and
9:168:14323:24:24:72:520:434:12:Times:12:Times:other factors differentiate the labor market dynamics of a boom in local areas from that in the
9:169:14418:24:24:72:518:410:12:Times:12:Times:entire economy, but do not gainsay the insight one can get from analyzing how local markets
9:170:14509:24:24:72:480:386:12:Times:12:Times:respond to booms.  In any case, area data are the only “game” in town with sufficient
9:171:14594:24:24:72:345:362:12:Times:12:Times:observations to permit more than a description of events.
9:172:14651:24:24:90:168:338:12:Times:12:Times:Area Variation
9:173:14665:24:24:90:471:314:12:Times:12:Times:Figures 9 and 10 (Appendix Table A3) show the frequency distributions for the
9:174:14742:24:24:72:516:290:12:Times:12:Times:unemployment rates by state and metropolitan area that are the key variables in our analysis.
9:175:14835:24:24:72:534:266:12:Times:12:Times:Because the CPS identifies fewer metropolitan areas in 1983 than in later years, we report fewer
9:176:14931:24:24:72:518:242:12:Times:12:Times:rates of area unemployment for the 1980s boom.  Most areas begin the 1980s expansion with
9:177:15020:24:24:72:537:218:12:Times:12:Times:unemployment rates that exceed 7 percent. By 1989 a sizeable number have unemployment rates
9:178:15111:24:24:72:534:194:12:Times:12:Times:less than 5 percent.  Most areas begin the 1990s boom with unemployment rates in the 6-7 or 7+
9:179:15205:24:24:72:510:170:12:Times:12:Times:range.  By 1996, over 98 metropolitan areas and 7 states have unemployment rates below 4
9:180:15293:24:24:72:513:146:12:Times:12:Times:percent.  Between January to July 1998 these figures jump to 146 metropolitan areas and 21
9:181:15383:24:24:72:102:122:12:Times:12:Times:states.
9:182:15390:24:0:90:520:98:12:Times:12:Times:Panel A of Table 1 shows the transition matrix of metropolitan areas for the 1983 to 1989
10:183:15479:0:24:72:525:698:12:Times:12:Times:and 1992 to 1998 periods.  In both periods the matrix is near triangular with 0s dominating the
10:184:15574:24:24:72:504:674:12:Times:12:Times:transitions to higher unemployment.  During the 1980s boom no area moved from a lower
10:185:15659:24:24:72:533:650:12:Times:12:Times:unemployment rate group to a higher unemployment rate group.  In the 1990s boom just 2 areas
10:186:15751:24:24:72:485:626:12:Times:12:Times:had 1998 unemployment rates above 1992 unemployment rates. Fifty-seven areas had
10:187:15831:24:24:72:512:602:12:Times:12:Times:unemployment rates in the same group, while the vast majority of areas witness a decline in
10:188:15922:24:24:72:535:578:12:Times:12:Times:unemployment. Of the 167 areas that started with unemployment rates greater than 7 percent, 80
10:189:16016:24:24:72:402:554:12:Times:12:Times:have now moved into the less than 4 percent and 4-5 percent groups.
10:190:16083:24:24:90:532:530:12:Times:12:Times:Panel B displays the transition probabilities associated with the 1990s boom.  The areas that
10:191:16176:24:24:72:517:506:12:Times:12:Times:started in the less than 4 percent group in 1992 remain in that group in 1998 with a very high
10:192:16270:24:24:72:499:482:12:Times:12:Times:probability.  From 1992 to 1996, 65 percent of 5-6 areas moved to the less than 4 percent
10:193:16359:24:24:72:512:458:12:Times:12:Times:category, 60 percent of 6-7 areas moved to 4-5, and 63 percent of 7+ either moved to 5-6 or
10:194:16450:24:24:72:537:434:12:Times:12:Times:remained at 7+.  By 1998, 81 percent of 5-6 areas have moved to the less than 4percent category,
10:195:16546:24:24:72:533:410:12:Times:12:Times:and 48 percent of 6-7 areas have moved to the less than 4 percent category. For the 7+ category,
10:196:16642:24:24:72:492:386:12:Times:12:Times:almost 50 percent have moved to either the less than 4 or 4-5 percent category by 1998.
10:197:16729:24:24:90:531:362:12:Times:12:Times:Overall, the reduction in unemployment is about 3 percentage points between 1992 to 1998,
10:198:16818:24:24:71:518:338:12:Times:12:Times:but the table displays quite different histories among areas. To examine the various paths, we
10:199:16912:24:24:71:527:314:12:Times:12:Times:focus on three types of areas: those with “continuous full employment” -- defined as areas with
10:200:17007:24:24:71:518:290:12:Times:12:Times:unemployment rates below 4 percent in all years of the recovery (14 metro areas); those with
10:201:17099:24:24:71:522:266:12:Times:12:Times:“steady high unemployment” -- defined as areas that had unemployment rates that exceeded 7
10:202:17189:24:24:71:515:242:12:Times:12:Times:percent in all years (28 areas); and those with “rapid reductions in joblessness”, -- defined as
10:203:17285:24:24:71:503:218:12:Times:12:Times:areas where unemployment rates fell by over 5 points (15 areas). More paths exist, but for
10:204:17375:24:24:71:239:194:12:Times:12:Times:simplicity we focus on these cases.
10:205:17410:24:24:89:530:170:12:Times:12:Times:Figure 11 plots the annual average unemployment rate for the three groups. The average for
10:206:17500:24:24:71:537:146:12:Times:12:Times:areas with unemployment rates below 4 percent in all years is 3.2 percent in 1992 and falls to 2.0
10:207:17598:24:24:71:512:122:12:Times:12:Times:percent in 1998.  Table 2 shows the areas that experiences this continuous full employment.
10:208:17689:24:0:71:533:98:12:Times:12:Times:They range from areas in Texas to midwestern metropolitan areas such as Des Moines and Iowa
11:209:17780:0:24:72:510:698:12:Times:12:Times:City.  The jobless rates for the group of areas with continuous high unemployment (rates in
11:210:17871:24:24:72:530:674:12:Times:12:Times:excess of 7 percent) also fall, but the group average here remains in double digits: it drops from
11:211:17969:24:24:72:537:650:12:Times:12:Times:14.5 to 12.1 percent. Of these 28 areas, table3 shows that 11 are in California. Finally, areas with
11:212:18069:24:24:72:518:626:12:Times:12:Times:reductions in unemployment rates in excess of 5 percentage points start at an average of 10.3
11:213:18162:24:24:72:507:602:12:Times:12:Times:percent in 1992 and fall to 4.6 percent in 1998. Almost half of these metropolitan areas are
11:214:18254:24:24:72:256:578:12:Times:12:Times:located in Massachusetts (see table 4).
11:215:18293:24:24:90:535:554:12:Times:12:Times:Figure 12 shows the UCR crime rates for each of these groups in areas in the 1990s recovery
11:216:18384:24:24:72:510:530:12:Times:12:Times:and in the preceding decade.  Throughout the period the area with the worst unemployment
11:217:18472:24:24:72:536:506:12:Times:12:Times:record have the highest rate of crime, while the areas with continuous low unemployment have a
11:218:18566:24:24:72:492:482:12:Times:12:Times:low rate of crime. With the expansion, crime rates for the group with the largest drop in
11:219:18655:24:24:72:529:458:12:Times:12:Times:unemployment falls the most, reaching essentially similar (in some years lower) levels in crime
11:220:18750:24:24:72:533:434:12:Times:12:Times:as in areas with unemployment below 4 percent.  These results offer one possible emendation to
11:221:18844:24:24:72:526:410:12:Times:12:Times:the usual finding that unemployment is inversely related to crime: it suggests there is a limit to
11:222:18942:24:24:72:533:386:12:Times:12:Times:the reduction in crime associated with low unemployment -- even 6 years of low unemployment
11:223:19033:24:24:72:526:362:12:Times:12:Times:does not reduce the crime rate continuously.  Rather, it simply keeps it at a lower than national
11:224:19130:24:24:72:98:338:12:Times:12:Times:level.
11:225:19136:24:24:72:314:314:12:Times:12:Times:Unemployment and Earnings and Employment
11:226:19176:24:24:108:522:290:12:Times:12:Times:How much does the employment and earnings of non-college-educated men vary with
11:227:19255:24:24:72:217:266:12:Times:12:Times:local labor market conditions?
11:228:19285:24:24:108:475:242:12:Times:12:Times:To answer this question, we compared the economic positions of men across
11:229:19358:24:24:72:518:218:12:Times:12:Times:metropolitan areas with different unemployment rates, using the micro CPS files.  We used a
11:230:19449:24:24:72:526:194:12:Times:12:Times:logit model for our employment analysis.  The dependent variable is a 0-1 dummy variable for
11:231:19541:24:24:72:477:170:12:Times:12:Times:whether the male is employed in a given year; the independent variables are the area
11:232:19625:24:24:72:520:146:12:Times:12:Times:unemployment rate and measures of demographic characteristics: age, years of schooling and
11:233:19715:24:24:72:497:122:12:Times:12:Times:race. The variable for race is a dummy variable that equals 1 if the respondent is African
11:234:19805:24:0:72:504:98:12:Times:12:Times:American and 0 if the respondent is white. To estimate the wage effect, we regress the log
12:235:19895:0:24:72:499:698:12:Times:12:Times:(natural log) of hourly earnings on the same variables used in the employment equations.
12:236:19983:24:24:108:515:674:12:Times:12:Times:Tables 5 and 6 present our main results linking the employment and earnings of non-
12:237:20066:24:24:72:480:650:12:Times:12:Times:college-educated young men to area unemployment rates and measures of crime, and
12:238:20146:24:24:72:534:626:12:Times:12:Times:comparative analyses for all men (25-64). Although we have wage and employment information
12:239:20236:24:24:72:521:602:12:Times:12:Times:for 1998, we do not have crime data for 1998. The results in Tables 5 and 6 are based on CPS
12:240:20328:24:24:72:526:578:12:Times:12:Times:samples that exclude the 1998 data. We estimated models that excluded our measures of crime
12:241:20419:24:24:72:512:554:12:Times:12:Times:and included the 1998 data, and summarize these results (which were similar to those in the
12:242:20510:24:24:72:490:530:12:Times:12:Times:table) during our discussion.  The column A regressions give results from cross section
12:243:20597:24:24:72:539:506:12:Times:12:Times:regressions that exploit the differences among areas.  The column B regressions give results from
12:244:20694:24:24:72:503:482:12:Times:12:Times:regressions which include metropolitan area dummy variables: they show how changes in
12:245:20779:24:24:72:527:458:12:Times:12:Times:unemployment in an area affect outcomes.  We record both the estimated logit coefficients and
12:246:20872:24:24:72:497:434:12:Times:12:Times:their effect on the probablities.  The upper part of the table measures unemployment as a
12:247:20961:24:24:72:524:410:12:Times:12:Times:continuous variable.  The lower part divides unemployment rates by group, in an effort to find
12:248:21055:24:24:72:164:386:12:Times:12:Times:any non-linearities.
12:249:21075:24:24:108:537:362:12:Times:12:Times:Table 5 shows that area unemployment has a sizeable effect on the employment of young
12:250:21160:24:24:72:537:338:12:Times:12:Times:non-college-educated men, both in the cross section and fixed effects specifications.  In all of the
12:251:21260:24:24:72:534:314:12:Times:12:Times:calculations the coefficients on unemployment for young workers exceed those for all men.  For
12:252:21354:24:24:72:513:290:12:Times:12:Times:instance the estimated effect of area unemployment on the probability of employment in the
12:253:21444:24:24:72:532:266:12:Times:12:Times:cross section is -0.015 versus -0.009 for all men.  In the fixed effects estimates in column B, the
12:254:21543:24:24:72:538:242:12:Times:12:Times:estimated coefficients for the effect of unemployment on the employment of youths are generally
12:255:21638:24:24:72:510:218:12:Times:12:Times:larger and diverge more from those for adults than in the cross section results. Within areas
12:256:21731:24:24:72:507:194:12:Times:12:Times:changes in unemployment rates produce gains in employment for younger relative to older
12:257:21818:24:24:72:522:170:12:Times:12:Times:workers.  The largest logistic coefficient is for African American youths (-0.124) and the next
12:258:21913:24:24:72:505:146:12:Times:12:Times:largest for all youths (-0.119), which compare to -0.074 for all men and -0.046 for African
12:259:22004:24:24:72:531:122:12:Times:12:Times:American men.  Given the different levels of employment for the groups, these figures translate
12:260:22099:24:0:72:534:98:12:Times:12:Times:into larger gains in the probability of employment for younger African American youths than all
13:261:22194:0:24:72:529:698:12:Times:12:Times:youths and similar gains in the probability of employment for older African American men and
13:262:22286:24:24:72:524:674:12:Times:12:Times:older white men.   In the bottom panel calculations in which we record coefficients on dummy
13:263:22378:24:24:72:518:650:12:Times:12:Times:variables for particular levels of unemployment, there is relatively little evidence of any non-
13:264:22474:24:24:72:540:626:12:Times:12:Times:linearities. These results do not change when the crime measures are excluded and the 1998 cross
13:265:22570:24:24:72:151:602:12:Times:12:Times:section is added.
13:266:22587:24:24:108:537:578:12:Times:12:Times:Table 6 records the estimated effects of unemployment on the natural logarithm of hourly
13:267:22675:24:24:72:525:554:12:Times:12:Times:earnings, or the “wage curve” (Blanchflower and Oswald).  Here, we find a striking difference
13:268:22768:24:24:72:535:530:12:Times:12:Times:between the results for the young men and for the older men.  In both the cross section and fixed
13:269:22865:24:24:72:523:506:12:Times:12:Times:effects analysis, unemployment has a strong effect on the hourly pay of young men but has no
13:270:22957:24:24:72:538:482:12:Times:12:Times:effect on the hourly earnings of 25-64 year old men.  Unemployment has a slightly smaller effect
13:271:23053:24:24:72:500:458:12:Times:12:Times:on the earnings of young African American men than on young white men (in contrast to
13:272:23138:24:24:72:498:434:12:Times:12:Times:Freeman’s analysis of the 1983-87 period, which found a higher effect on young African
13:273:23224:24:24:72:533:410:12:Times:12:Times:Americans).  However, this result appears to occur because young African American men are in
13:274:23316:24:24:72:495:386:12:Times:12:Times:areas that have taken longer for wages to rise.  When we add the 1998 cross section (see
13:275:23404:24:24:72:529:362:12:Times:12:Times:appendix A3) the unemployment coefficient for African American youth jumps from –0.019 to
13:276:23493:24:24:72:527:338:12:Times:12:Times:-0.031, while the unemployment coefficient for all youth increases from –0.023 to –0.024. The
13:277:23586:24:24:72:502:314:12:Times:12:Times:gains for African American youth occur in the less than 4 percent, 4-5 and 5-6 categories.
13:278:23676:24:24:72:530:290:12:Times:12:Times:Indeed, the coefficients shown in Table 6 all increase by about 0.03 points when the 1998 cross
13:279:23771:24:24:72:535:266:12:Times:12:Times:section is added, which implies that the effect of the boom on earnings increased substantially in
13:280:23869:24:24:72:520:242:12:Times:12:Times:the 1996-1998 period. One reason may be that it takes time for the boom to raise demand and
13:281:23960:24:24:72:305:218:12:Times:12:Times:eventually the pay for African American youths.
13:282:24007:24:24:108:522:194:12:Times:12:Times:Turning to the bottom part of the table, we find some evidence of non-linear effects of
13:283:24094:24:24:72:528:170:12:Times:12:Times:unemployment on the log earnings of young workers.  In areas with unemployment below four
13:284:24183:24:24:72:516:146:12:Times:12:Times:percent, the fixed effects (column B) estimates show that the earnings of young non-college-
13:285:24275:24:24:72:512:122:12:Times:12:Times:educated men are 0.121 points higher, whereas they are just 0.018 points higher for all non-
13:286:24367:24:0:72:528:98:12:Times:12:Times:college-educated men.  The coefficients on areas with 4-5% unemployment and areas with less
14:287:24458:0:24:72:537:698:12:Times:12:Times:than 4% unemployment differ by .04 points for the young men, but differ by only .008 points for
14:288:24553:24:24:72:520:674:12:Times:12:Times:all men.   The implication is that very tight labor markets may improve the earnings of young
14:289:24646:24:24:72:409:650:12:Times:12:Times:non-college-educated workers without creating overall wage inflation.
14:290:24715:24:24:108:530:626:12:Times:12:Times:In addition to unemployment, the regressions in tables 5 and 6 contain one area variable
14:291:24803:24:24:72:520:602:12:Times:12:Times:that is not normally part of wage curves-- the rate of crime per young person in the state.  We
14:292:24898:24:24:72:535:578:12:Times:12:Times:have included it because of the substantial number of young men, particularly African American
14:293:24992:24:24:72:534:554:12:Times:12:Times:men, involved in crime and because of the likelihood that their criminal activity will affect labor
14:294:25091:24:24:72:503:530:12:Times:12:Times:market outcomes.  Youths engaged in crime are likely to participate less in the local labor
14:295:25182:24:24:72:483:506:12:Times:12:Times:market, reducing the youth supply, and may have lower human capital than otherwise
14:296:25264:24:24:72:532:482:12:Times:12:Times:comparable youths, reducing their skills as well.  In the fixed effects regressions, the coefficient
14:297:25364:24:24:72:538:458:12:Times:12:Times:on crime is negative in nearly all cases, implying that in areas where crime rose, employment fell
14:298:25462:24:24:72:504:434:12:Times:12:Times:and earnings fell. As we have controlled for area unemployment, one interpretation of this
14:299:25552:24:24:72:532:410:12:Times:12:Times:relation is that conditional on the labor market, youths in areas with more crime are trading jobs
14:300:25650:24:24:72:501:386:12:Times:12:Times:or legitimate earnings for criminal activity.  If this were correct, we would expect that the
14:301:25743:24:24:72:504:362:12:Times:12:Times:coefficients on crime in the regressions for African-Americans (for whom crime is a more
14:302:25831:24:24:72:528:338:12:Times:12:Times:common choice) to be larger than those in the regressions for all men, and indeed this is true in
14:303:25928:24:24:72:530:314:12:Times:12:Times:the calculations. But we would also expect the crime coefficients in the young male regressions
14:304:26023:24:24:72:511:290:12:Times:12:Times:to exceed those for all men, and this is not the case. As our crime data are for states and our
14:305:26118:24:24:72:516:266:12:Times:12:Times:unemployment data are for areas within states, we are not prepared to make too much of this
14:306:26209:24:24:72:108:242:12:Times:12:Times:pattern.
14:307:26217:24:24:108:499:218:12:Times:12:Times:Finally, in Table 7 we examine the time pattern of the effect of unemployment on
14:308:26297:24:24:72:519:194:12:Times:12:Times:employment and earnings in greater depth by including the unemployment rate at the boom’s
14:309:26386:24:24:72:535:170:12:Times:12:Times:beginning -- the trough unemployment -- to the regressions for earnings and employment.  Panel
14:310:26480:24:24:72:529:146:12:Times:12:Times:A shows the effect of area unemployment on employment, including the trough unemployment
14:311:26568:24:24:72:491:122:12:Times:12:Times:rate.  Panel B shows the effect of area unemployment on earnings, including the trough
14:312:26654:24:0:72:501:98:12:Times:12:Times:unemployment rate.  The trough unemployment rate enters most of the regressions with a
15:313:26740:0:24:72:538:698:12:Times:12:Times:substantial effect that magnifies the estimated impact of a tight market on youth employment and
15:314:26836:24:24:72:532:674:12:Times:12:Times:earnings and increases the differential effect of the labor market on youths as opposed to adults.
15:315:26934:24:24:72:487:650:12:Times:12:Times:At the same level of unemployment, a higher trough unemployment rate implies lower
15:316:27016:24:24:72:500:626:12:Times:12:Times:employment and earnings for youths; whereas it has only a modest effect for adults.  One
15:317:27104:24:24:72:510:602:12:Times:12:Times:interpretation is that this is a kind of hysterisis, where the past has an independent effect on
15:318:27200:24:24:72:501:578:12:Times:12:Times:young workers, perhaps because it impacts the school-to-work transition.  The wages and
15:319:27287:24:24:72:532:554:12:Times:12:Times:employment of youths may be determined by a dynamic adjustment process, with some lags, so
15:320:27377:24:24:72:532:530:12:Times:12:Times:that focusing solely on the current years’ area unemployment as the key independent variable in
15:321:27472:24:24:72:538:506:12:Times:12:Times:the analysis is incorrect.   Perhaps a Phillips curve type specification is more appropriate than the
15:322:27573:24:24:72:310:482:12:Times:12:Times:standard wage curve (Blanchard and Katz, 1999).
15:323:27620:24:24:108:526:458:12:Times:12:Times:To examine the pattern of change in employment and wages across areas with different
15:324:27704:24:24:71:523:434:12:Times:12:Times:unemployment histories, we have tabulated in Table 8 the outcome variables for less educated
15:325:27796:24:24:71:505:410:12:Times:12:Times:men in the three types of areas that we specified earlier: continuous full employment areas
15:326:27887:24:24:71:533:386:12:Times:12:Times:(jobless rates below 4 percent in all years); steady high unemployment (jobless rates that exceed
15:327:27984:24:24:71:508:362:12:Times:12:Times:7 percent in all years), and areas of rapid improvement where jobless rates fell by at least 5
15:328:28078:24:24:71:486:338:12:Times:12:Times:percentage points.  On the employment side, what is striking is the sizeable increase in
15:329:28166:24:24:71:528:314:12:Times:12:Times:employment for young workers relative to older workers in the tightest labor markets and labor
15:330:28260:24:24:71:538:290:12:Times:12:Times:markets with the biggest declines in unemployment. The data for all youths show roughly similar
15:331:28355:24:24:71:534:266:12:Times:12:Times:gains in employment across the areas in percentage points (from different starting points).  From
15:332:28452:24:24:71:537:242:12:Times:12:Times:1992 to 1998, the gains are 6 points in the continuous full employment areas, 4 points in the high
15:333:28550:24:24:71:519:218:12:Times:12:Times:unemployment areas, and 7 points in the rapidly improving areas.  All men also have roughly
15:334:28641:24:24:71:528:194:12:Times:12:Times:similar gains in employment, but these are relatively modest.  By 1998 the young less educated
15:335:28735:24:24:71:507:170:12:Times:12:Times:in the continuous full employment areas have rates of employment that actually exceed the
15:336:28824:24:24:71:525:146:12:Times:12:Times:employment rates for the older less educated men in the continuous high unemployment areas.
15:337:28915:24:24:71:481:122:12:Times:12:Times:All youths in these areas have roughly 80 percent employment rates! The increases in
15:338:28999:24:0:71:505:98:12:Times:12:Times:employment rates for less educated young African American men, which are largest in the
16:339:29086:0:24:72:527:698:12:Times:12:Times:continuous full employment local labor markets, close a substantial portion of the gap between
16:340:29180:24:24:72:520:674:12:Times:12:Times:them and similarly educated young white men.  The implication is that a long extended boom
16:341:29270:24:24:72:466:650:12:Times:12:Times:can go a long way to resolving the African American youth employment problem.
16:342:29347:24:24:108:539:626:12:Times:12:Times:The pattern of change in the earnings across areas tells a similar story: larger gains for the
16:343:29441:24:24:72:537:602:12:Times:12:Times:young less educated men than for older less educated men, though here young African American
16:344:29533:24:24:72:534:578:12:Times:12:Times:less educated men do no better than other less educated young men.  One possible reason for the
16:345:29628:24:24:72:536:554:12:Times:12:Times:absence of any particular wage effect in the continuous high employment areas is that initially in
16:346:29726:24:24:72:518:530:12:Times:12:Times:1992 the wages of young less educated are reasonably close to that of all less educated youth
16:347:29819:24:24:72:527:506:12:Times:12:Times:(1.42 vs 1.48 for a 6 ln point difference). This may in part be due to the minimum wage, which
16:348:29913:24:24:72:393:482:12:Times:12:Times:tends to compress wages at the bottom of the earnings distribution.
16:349:29980:24:24:108:538:458:12:Times:12:Times:All told, table 8 suggests that the economic boom of the 1990s substantially improved the
16:350:30069:24:24:72:487:434:12:Times:12:Times:job market for less educated young men, including young African Americans, and that
16:351:30152:24:24:72:531:410:12:Times:12:Times:continuous full employment has the potential for creating full employment and rising wages for
16:352:30246:24:24:72:457:386:12:Times:12:Times:these workers. By contrast, the gains for all less educated men are more modest.
16:353:30326:24:24:72:416:362:12:Times:12:Times:Is the Wage Gain Due to Full Employment or the Minimum Wage?
16:354:30386:24:24:108:533:338:12:Times:12:Times:In 1996, the federal minimum wage increased from $4.25 to $4.75.  In 1997, it increased
16:355:30473:24:24:72:539:314:12:Times:12:Times:from $4.75 to $5.15.  As these changes undoubtedly affected the wages of less educated workers,
16:356:30568:24:24:72:524:290:12:Times:12:Times:they are a confounding factor in the estimates of the effect of area unemployment on earnings.
16:357:30662:24:24:72:521:266:12:Times:12:Times:One possibility is that at any given unemployment rate, earnings in areas where the minimum
16:358:30753:24:24:72:513:242:12:Times:12:Times:wage had greater impact will be higher for young less educated men than in areas where the
16:359:30843:24:24:72:535:218:12:Times:12:Times:minimum wage had a smaller impact, and correspondingly employment may less.  This will bias
16:360:30934:24:24:72:534:194:12:Times:12:Times:our estimates of area effects if there is a correlation between the minimum wage and the level or
16:361:31031:24:24:72:530:170:12:Times:12:Times:change in area unemployment.  One possibility is that the minimum wage raised wages in areas
16:362:31123:24:24:72:497:146:12:Times:12:Times:with high unemployment or areas where unemployment fell modestly, which would bias
16:363:31205:24:24:72:536:122:12:Times:12:Times:downward our estimate of the impact of area conditions on unemployment.   But if the minimum
16:364:31297:24:0:72:502:98:12:Times:12:Times:wage induced increases in wages lowered employment, our estimates of the effect of area
17:365:31384:0:24:72:489:698:12:Times:12:Times:unemployment on employment would be biased upward.  We attribute too much of the
17:366:31464:24:24:72:530:674:12:Times:12:Times:employment gains of less-educated in areas of low or declining unemployment to the economic
17:367:31555:24:24:72:523:650:12:Times:12:Times:expansion, by ignoring the fact that in those areas the minimum was not as binding as in areas
17:368:31649:24:24:72:406:626:12:Times:12:Times:with high unemployment or more modestly declining unemployment.
17:369:31712:24:24:108:526:602:12:Times:12:Times: Table 9 examines whether the federal minimum wage hikes in 1996 and 1997 bias our
17:370:31794:24:24:72:526:578:12:Times:12:Times:estimates of the relationship between area unemployment and the employment and earnings of
17:371:31884:24:24:72:499:554:12:Times:12:Times:men.  To test for this possibility, we sorted the CPS sample into two groups. The first are
17:372:31975:24:24:72:519:530:12:Times:12:Times:respondents that live in states where the federal minimum wage hikes of 1996 and 1997 were
17:373:32065:24:24:72:514:506:12:Times:12:Times:binding. These are states in which the federal minimum wage exceeded the state's minimum
17:374:32153:24:24:72:496:482:12:Times:12:Times:wage. The second group is comprised of respondents that live in states where the federal
17:375:32241:24:24:72:515:458:12:Times:12:Times:minimum wage hikes were not binding. The federal increases remained at or below the state
17:376:32330:24:24:72:530:434:12:Times:12:Times:minimum wage.  Table A4 displays the federal and state minimum wages and the ratios used to
17:377:32421:24:24:72:157:410:12:Times:12:Times:create the groups.
17:378:32439:24:24:108:503:386:12:Times:12:Times:To model the impact, we added two new variables to our earlier models: a dummy
17:379:32517:24:24:71:539:362:12:Times:12:Times:variable that equals 1 if the respondent lives in a state where the hikes were binding, and 0 if they
17:380:32618:24:24:71:473:338:12:Times:12:Times:were not binding; and interaction between the binding dummy variable and the area
17:381:32699:24:24:71:507:314:12:Times:12:Times:unemployment rate.  It is the coefficient on the interaction term that is most relevant to our
17:382:32793:24:24:71:529:290:12:Times:12:Times:analysis.   The evidence in Table 9 suggests that the minimum wage hikes of 1996 and 1997 do
17:383:32885:24:24:71:498:266:12:Times:12:Times:not bias our results.  The interaction terms are basically zero in both the employment and
17:384:32975:24:24:71:533:242:12:Times:12:Times:earnings equations.  The coefficient on the binding dummy is nonzero, but generally statistically
17:385:33072:24:24:71:255:218:12:Times:6:Times:insignificant, with no distinct pattern.3
17:386:33113:24:24:72:297:194:12:Times:12:Times:The Relation Between Outcomes and Crime
17:387:33152:24:24:108:539:170:12:Times:12:Times:We examine the relation between crime and labor market conditions and outcomes in two
17:388:33237:24:24:72:532:146:12:Times:12:Times:ways.  First, in Table 10 we estimate a standard supply of crime equation in which we relate the
17:389:33333:24:24:72:519:122:12:Times:12:Times:crime per youth in a given state to unemployment and a measure of the potential disincentive
17:390:33425:24:0:72:520:98:12:Times:12:Times:effect of criminal punishment or risk of getting caught and penalized severely. We define our
18:391:33518:0:24:72:526:698:12:Times:12:Times:measure as incarceration/crime.  In these regressions we include state dummy variables so that
18:392:33612:24:24:72:505:674:12:Times:12:Times:the coefficients are fixed effect estimates that show how changes in crime rates respond to
18:393:33703:24:24:72:532:650:12:Times:12:Times:changes in economic conditions or to incarcerations per crime.  Column A records the results of
18:394:33798:24:24:72:497:626:12:Times:12:Times:regressing the crime rate/number of men aged 16-24 on area unemployment rate, several
18:395:33883:24:24:72:520:602:12:Times:12:Times:demographic controls, and dummy variables for year and state.  Consistent with the results of
18:396:33976:24:24:72:534:578:12:Times:12:Times:Gould, Weinberg and Mustard, we find that changes in unemployment rates affect crime rates at
18:397:34069:24:24:72:528:554:12:Times:12:Times:the state level, though the effects are not large relative to the crime rate.  Column B records the
18:398:34168:24:24:72:530:530:12:Times:12:Times:results with the inclusion of a measure of the potential punishment for crime: incarcerations per
18:399:34265:24:24:72:468:506:12:Times:12:Times:crime.  Here, too unemployment affects crime.  A one percentage point increase in
18:400:34346:24:24:72:538:482:12:Times:12:Times:unemployment raises crime per youth by 1.5 percent [0.011 (coefficient) divided by 0.698 (mean
18:401:34440:24:24:72:495:458:12:Times:12:Times:crime per youth in our sample)].  This suggests that a drop in U.S. unemployment of 2.6
18:402:34527:24:24:72:539:434:12:Times:12:Times:percentage points (Table A1), as occurred between 1992 and 1997 would have reduced crime per
18:403:34619:24:24:72:513:410:12:Times:12:Times:youth by 3.9 percent (-2.6 multiplied by 1.5).  Incarceration per crime has a larger and more
18:404:34712:24:24:72:534:386:12:Times:12:Times:statistically significant impact on the rate of crime. This is consistent with other studies that find
18:405:34814:24:24:72:524:362:12:Times:12:Times:stronger relations between criminal penalties and crime than between labor market factors and
18:406:34907:24:24:72:529:338:12:Times:12:Times:crime (Freeman, 1995).  While there is some potential ratio bias to this estimate (the number of
18:407:35003:24:24:72:525:314:12:Times:12:Times:crimes is on the right side of the equation and on the bottom of the left side), Levitt (1998) has
18:408:35101:24:24:72:464:290:12:Times:12:Times:found that any such bias is modest, and we ignore it.  Between 1992 and 1997 the
18:409:35181:24:24:72:531:266:12:Times:12:Times:incarceration/crime ratio rose by 3.3 percentage points from 5.83 to 9.13 (Table A1), so that the
18:410:35278:24:24:72:511:242:12:Times:12:Times:coefficient suggests that increased penalization of criminals reduced crime per youth by 3.7
18:411:35370:24:24:72:240:218:12:Times:12:Times:percent (3.3 multiplied by –1.130).
18:412:35405:24:24:108:537:194:12:Times:12:Times:But incarceration does not only affect the rate of criminal activity.  As noted earlier, mass
18:413:35498:24:24:72:514:170:12:Times:12:Times:incarceration reduces the labor supply in some communities and probably affects the human
18:414:35587:24:24:72:516:146:12:Times:12:Times:capital and employment or earnings of persons once they are released from prison or jail and
18:415:35679:24:24:72:491:122:12:Times:12:Times:return to their home community.  As a first step toward seeing the relationship between
18:416:35766:24:0:72:500:98:12:Times:12:Times:incarceration and the outcomes for youths, we re-estimated the employment and earnings
19:417:35852:0:24:72:526:698:12:Times:12:Times:equations in tables 5 and 6 by replacing the crimes per young man variable with incarcerations
19:418:35946:24:24:72:540:674:12:Times:12:Times:per young man.  As the unemployment rate coefficients are unaffected by this, we report in Table
19:419:36042:24:24:72:524:650:12:Times:12:Times:11 simply the coefficient on incarcerations/crime.  It is strong and negative in the fixed effects
19:420:36140:24:24:72:523:626:12:Times:12:Times:regressions in columns B though not in the cross-section calculations in columns A for youths
19:421:36233:24:24:72:496:602:12:Times:12:Times:and for adults. The coefficients are especially large in the earnings equations for African
19:422:36324:24:24:72:530:578:12:Times:12:Times:American young and all men. Areas with the most rapidly rising rates of incarceration are areas
19:423:36419:24:24:72:495:554:12:Times:12:Times:in which youths, particularly, African American youths have had the worst earnings and
19:424:36505:24:24:72:502:530:12:Times:12:Times:employment experience, and where men aged 25-64 have also done poorly.  Whether this
19:425:36589:24:24:72:528:506:12:Times:12:Times:association is due to the depressing effect of criminal records on labor market outcomes cannot
19:426:36684:24:24:72:260:482:12:Times:12:Times:be ascertained from the aggregate data.
19:427:36723:24:24:72:129:458:12:Times:12:Times:Conclusion
19:428:36733:24:24:108:512:434:12:Times:12:Times:The US economy has experienced nine post-World War II expansions.4 The current
19:429:36811:24:24:72:507:410:12:Times:12:Times:expansion, which started in March 1991, and continues as of this writing, March 1999, has
19:430:36900:24:24:72:534:386:12:Times:12:Times:shattered the length of the previous longest peace-time boom from November 1982 to July 1990
19:431:36992:24:24:72:501:362:12:Times:12:Times:expansion. The national unemployment rate started at 6.8 percent and currently sits at 4.3
19:432:37082:24:24:72:530:338:12:Times:12:Times:percent. The unemployment rates in many metropolitan areas sit well below 4 percent. In 1998,
19:433:37175:24:24:72:530:314:12:Times:12:Times:44 percent of metropolitan unemployment rates were below four percent, implying that roughly
19:434:37267:24:24:72:354:290:12:Times:12:Times:half of the US was enjoying extremely tight labor markets.
19:435:37325:24:24:90:518:266:12:Times:12:Times:The NAIRU has seemingly shifted, as low rates of unemployment have not generated the
19:436:37409:24:24:72:516:242:12:Times:12:Times:same increases in wages as in previous economic booms.  If the boom of the late 1990’s was
19:437:37499:24:24:72:522:218:12:Times:12:Times:insufficient to improve substantially the position of young non-college-educated workers, it is
19:438:37594:24:24:72:537:194:12:Times:12:Times:difficult to imagine that any expansion could do so, and thus would dash any hope that economic
19:439:37689:24:24:72:536:170:12:Times:12:Times:growth per se could raise their pay and income. Our analysis has shown that the 1990s boom has
19:440:37783:24:24:72:512:146:12:Times:12:Times:substantially improved the labor market outcomes of young non-college-educated men; and
19:441:37870:24:24:72:528:122:12:Times:12:Times:helped the young African American men who are the most disadvantaged and socially troubled
19:442:37960:24:0:72:538:98:12:Times:12:Times:group in the U.S..  Young men in tight labor markets in the 1990s experienced a noticeable boost

40:1165:62288:11:11:110:482:361:10:Times:10:Times:1992, and 1996. The values for 1998 come from the outgoing rotation group interviews from
40:1166:62377:11:12:110:496:350:10:Times:10:Times:January to July.  The statistics for the 1983, 1987, 1989 and 1992 cross sections are based on the
40:1167:62475:12:11:110:493:338:10:Times:10:Times:ESR variable in the public use CPS annual merged file. All respondents whose major activity is
40:1168:62569:11:12:110:499:327:10:Times:10:Times:in school were dropped. Youths are 16 to 24 year old African American and white men only who
40:1169:62661:12:11:110:475:315:10:Times:10:Times:have completed no more than 12 years of schooling or received no more than a high school
40:1170:62749:11:12:110:450:304:10:Times:10:Times:diploma or GED. Adults are 25 to 64 year old African American and white men. The
40:1171:62829:12:11:110:471:292:10:Times:10:Times:unemployment rate is the ratio of the number of people looking for work to the sum of the
40:1172:62918:11:12:110:496:281:10:Times:10:Times:number looking for work, the number working, and the number with a job but not working.  The
40:1173:63010:12:11:110:486:269:10:Times:10:Times:statistics for 1996 and 1998 are based on a new variable called the monthly labor force recode
40:1174:63104:11:12:110:488:258:10:Times:10:Times:(MLR) and a school enrollment variable. The ESR variable classified respondents on layoff as
40:1175:63196:12:12:110:499:246:10:Times:10:Times:employed and those enrolled in school as being out of the labor force. The enrollment question is
40:1176:63293:12:11:110:471:234:10:Times:10:Times:given only to 16 to 24 year old respondents. The new MLR variable classifies on layoff as
40:1177:63382:11:11:110:482:223:10:Times:10:Times:unemployed and does not contain information about school enrollment. To maintain as much
40:1178:63470:11:12:110:492:212:10:Times:10:Times:continuity with previous surveys, we classified respondents on layoff as employed and used the

45:1323:71280:9:18:72:540:687:6:Times:12:Times:1Past  studies  have  found  that  changes  in  unemployment  have  greater  effects  on  young  persons
45:1324:71384:18:14:72:540:669:12:Times:12:Times:than on adults.  Clark and Summers (1981) found this to be the case in their time series study of
45:1325:71481:14:14:72:540:655:12:Times:12:Times:the  dependence  of  youth  joblessness  and  employment  on  adult  unemployment;  Freeman  (1991)
45:1326:71580:14:13:72:540:641:12:Times:12:Times:found this to be the case in his cross area study of youth employment and earnings in the 1980s.
45:1327:71676:13:14:72:539:628:12:Times:12:Times:For a survey on estimates for the 1960's and 1970's, see DeFreitas (1986). For more recent work
45:1328:71771:14:14:72:540:614:12:Times:12:Times:see  DeFreitas  (1991),  Freeman  and  Holzer  (1986),  Myers  (1989),  Stratton  (1993),  and  Farber
45:1329:71873:14:14:71:539:600:12:Times:12:Times:(1998).  Studies  that  use  various  waves  of  the  displaced  worker  survey  also  speak  to  this  issue
45:1330:71982:14:23:71:237:586:12:Times:12:Times:(Kletzer, 1991, and Hipple, 1997).
45:1331:72016:23:18:71:540:563:6:Times:12:Times:2 The removal of a substantial number of young men from the civilian population might increase
45:1332:72110:18:14:71:539:545:12:Times:12:Times:employment  rates  and  earnings  for  those  who  remain  in  the  work  force.    But  when  the
45:1333:72208:14:14:71:539:531:12:Times:12:Times:incarcerated  leave  prison  and  return  to  the  labor  market,  their  employability  may  be  lower.
45:1334:72312:14:14:71:539:517:12:Times:12:Times:Employers  may  choose  some  form  of  statistical  discrimination  against  a  group  with  high
45:1335:72410:14:23:71:153:503:12:Times:12:Times:criminal activity.
45:1336:72428:23:18:71:540:480:6:Times:12:Times:3We  also  estimated  models  for  the  largest  30  metropolitan  areas.    We  were  concerned  that  their
45:1337:72537:18:14:71:539:462:12:Times:12:Times:employment and wage relationships may be different since few of these areas showed up in our
45:1338:72629:14:14:71:539:448:12:Times:12:Times:three-group taxamony.  To  test  for  differences,  we  estimated  the  equations  used  to  generate  the
45:1339:72735:14:14:71:539:434:12:Times:12:Times:results  in  Tables  5  and  6,  but  added  a  dummy  variable  that  denoted  whether  the  individual
45:1340:72839:14:13:71:539:420:12:Times:12:Times:resided  in  one  of  the  top  30  metropolitan  areas  and  an  interaction  between  this  variable  and  the
45:1341:72951:13:14:71:539:407:12:Times:12:Times:area unemployment rate. The latter is our coefficient of concern.  In none of the regressions was
45:1342:73048:14:14:71:540:393:12:Times:12:Times:the interation’s coefficient statistically significant.  Further, the coefficient ranges from .0002 to
45:1343:73150:14:14:71:539:379:12:Times:12:Times:.004  for  all  youth,  all  men  and  African  American  men.  The  coefficient  equals  .015  for  African
45:1344:73258:14:23:71:318:365:12:Times:12:Times:American youth, but the standard error is also .015.
45:1345:73310:23:18:71:540:342:6:Times:12:Times:4  The  longest  expansion  which  was  from  February  1961  to  December  1969  lasted  106  months
45:1346:73411:18:14:71:539:324:12:Times:12:Times:during  the  Vietnam  war.  If  we  restrict  the  analysis  to  peacetime  expansions  then  the  92  month
45:1347:73519:14:14:71:539:310:12:Times:12:Times:expansion from November 1982 to July 1990 is the longest on record. During that expansion, the
45:1348:73613:14:14:71:539:296:12:Times:12:Times:unemployment  rate  fell  from  10.8  percent  to  5.5  percent.  At  that  time,  many  policy  makers  and
45:1349:73721:14:13:71:539:282:12:Times:12:Times:researchers  felt  that  the  1980s  expansion  provided  the  most  optimistic  view  of  macroeconomic
45:1350:73825:13:14:71:539:269:12:Times:12:Times:growth's  ability  to  vastly  improve  the  labor  market  outcomes  of  non-college  educated  and  less-
45:1351:73932:14:0:71:296:255:12:Times:12:Times:skilled workers, especially African Americans.
