2:25:1067:28:26:71:539:581:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Central bankers and financial supervisors often have different goals. While monetary policymakers
2:26:1164:26:25:71:539:555:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:want  to  ensure  that  there  are  always  sufficient  lending  activities  to  maintain  high  and  stable
2:27:1272:25:26:71:539:530:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:economic growth, supervisors work to limit banks. lending capacities in order to prevent excessive
2:28:1370:26:25:71:539:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:risk-taking. To avoid working at cross-purposes, central bankers need to adopt a policy strategy that
2:29:1471:25:25:71:539:479:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:accounts  for  the  impact  of  capital  adequacy  requirements.  In  this  paper  we  derive  an  optimal
2:30:1577:25:26:71:539:454:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:monetary policy that reinforces prudential capital requirements at the same time that it stabilizes
2:31:1676:26:25:71:539:428:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:aggregate economic activity. We go on to show that policymakers at the Federal Reserve adjust
2:32:1769:25:26:71:539:403:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:interest  rate  policy  in  a  way  that  would  neutralize  the  procyclical  impact  of  bank  capital
2:33:1873:26:25:71:539:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:requirements. By contrast, central bankers in Germany and Japan clearly do not act as the theory
2:34:1969:25:26:71:173:352:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:suggests they should.

3:49:2310:0:28:84:197:659:207:g_d0_f4:207:g_d0_f4:1  Introduction
3:50:2325:28:16:84:526:631:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Central bankers know thatfinancial intermediation is important for achieving macroeconomic
3:51:2415:16:16:84:526:615:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:stability.  Without a functioning banking system, an economy will grind to a halt.  It is the
3:52:2508:16:17:84:526:599:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:job of regulators and supervisors to ensure that thefinancial system functions smoothly. But
3:53:2600:17:16:84:526:582:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:monetary policy and prudential supervisory policy can work at cross-purposes. An economic
3:54:2689:16:17:84:526:566:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:slowdown can cause deterioration in the balance sheets offinancial institutions.  Seeing the
3:55:2781:17:16:84:526:549:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:decline in the value of assets, supervisors will insist that banks should follow the regulation
3:56:2876:16:17:84:527:533:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:and ensure that they have sufficient capital given their risk exposures.  The limit on bank
3:57:2967:17:16:84:526:516:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:lending set by capital adequacy requirements declines during recessions and increases during
3:58:3059:16:16:84:526:500:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:booms.  And as intermediation falls, the level of economic activity goes down with it.  It
3:59:3149:16:17:84:526:484:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:looks as if regulation deepens recessions.  As the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
3:60:3238:17:16:84:468:467:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:(2001) put, the capital regulation ìhas the potential to amplify business cycles.î
3:61:3320:16:17:101:526:451:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Blum and Hellwig (1995) provided thefirst theoretical demonstration that capital require-
3:62:3409:17:16:84:527:434:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:ments can exacerbate business-cyclefluctuations. In focusing on entirely on the behavior of
3:63:3500:16:17:84:526:418:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:the banking system, the Blum and Hellwig model provides an importantfirst step, but in the
3:64:3590:17:16:84:526:401:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:end their analysis is incomplete.  They do not consider the response of the central bank to
3:65:3681:16:17:84:526:385:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:economicfluctuations.  This assumption is critical for their result but certainly unrealistic.
3:66:3775:17:16:84:526:368:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:What if central banks conduct monetary policy to explicitly account for the impact of cap-
3:67:3865:16:16:84:526:352:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:ital requirements?1Will the procyclical effect of capital requirements remain?  Is this the
3:68:3956:16:17:84:526:336:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:optimal thing to do for central banks? To answer these questions, we derive an optimal mon-
3:69:4047:17:16:84:526:319:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:etary policy rule with both static and dynamic models in which the potential procyclicality
3:70:4138:16:17:84:259:303:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:of capital requirements is embedded.
3:71:4174:17:16:101:526:286:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Our conclusions are as follows:  A countryís monetary policymakers should react to the
3:72:4260:16:17:84:527:270:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:state of their banking systemís balance sheet.  And when they do, the procyclical effect
3:73:4348:17:16:84:526:253:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:of prudential capital regulation can be counteracted and completely neutralized.   For a
3:74:4436:16:16:84:527:237:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:given level of economic activity and inflation, the optimal policy reaction dictates setting
3:75:4528:16:17:84:526:221:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:interest rates lower the morefinancial stress there is in the banking system when the economic
3:76:4622:17:16:84:526:204:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:activity is in the downturn.  We present simulation results to give a sense of the magnitude
3:77:4714:16:17:84:526:188:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:of the required reaction.   But when taking this proposition to the data and estimating
3:78:4801:17:16:84:526:171:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:forward-looking monetary policy reaction functions for the United States, Germany (pre-
3:79:4888:16:15:97:527:155:36:g_d0_f3:83:g_d0_f3:1In an economy with bank capital requirements, a policy game between bank regulators and central banks
3:80:4990:15:11:84:526:140:83:g_d0_f3:83:g_d0_f3:can emerge.   In this paper, we assume that monetary policymakers have more advantage in making the
3:81:5089:11:11:84:526:129:83:g_d0_f3:83:g_d0_f3:movement in the game with bank regulators.  This is based on the observation that the monetary policy is
3:82:5193:11:0:84:409:118:83:g_d0_f3:83:g_d0_f3:usually conducted on the daily basis, while the bank regulation is altered slowly.
4:83:5316:0:17:84:526:659:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:unification) and Japan, wefind that while monetary policymakers in the U.S. behave as the
4:84:5405:17:16:84:526:642:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:theory suggests, lowering interest rates by more in downturns in which the banking system is
4:85:5497:16:17:84:432:626:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:under stress, by contrast, central bankers in Germany and Japan do not.
4:86:5568:17:16:101:526:609:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:We derive optimal interest rate rules with the static model and the dynamic model in
4:87:5652:16:17:84:526:593:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Section 2 and 3, respectively. Section 4 reports the simulation results and Section 5 discusses
4:88:5747:17:38:84:303:576:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:the empirical estimation. Section 6 concludes.

4:90:5806:28:23:84:178:510:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:2.1  The model
4:91:5820:23:16:84:526:487:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:We begin with a static aggregate demand-aggregate supply model modified to include a bank-
4:92:5910:16:17:84:526:471:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:ing sector.  The purpose of this simple model is to highlight the impact of introducing bank
4:93:6002:17:16:84:526:454:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:capital requirements in their most stripped down in order to show the extent to which the
4:94:6091:16:17:84:527:438:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:banking industry can affect business cycles. The static model also sheds lights on the fruitful
4:95:6186:17:16:84:280:421:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:approach that solves the dynamic model.
4:96:6225:16:16:101:526:405:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:The starting point is an aggregate demand curve that admits the possibility of banks
4:97:6309:16:17:84:526:389:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:having an impact on the level of economic activity.  Following Bernanke and Blinder (1988)
4:98:6399:17:16:84:526:372:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:we distinguish between policy-controlled interest rate and lending rates and write aggregate
4:99:6491:16:33:84:138:356:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:demand as:
4:100:6501:33:24:235:527:323:122:g_d0_f7:122:g_d0_f3:yd=yd(i−πe,ρ−πe,π)+η,(1)
4:101:6525:24:17:84:526:299:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:whereiis short-term nominal interest rate,ρis nominal loan rate,πeis expected inflation,
4:102:6613:17:16:84:526:282:122:g_d0_f11:122:g_d0_f3:πis inflation rate, andηis a white noise random variable. We will refer toηas the aggregate
4:103:6704:16:17:84:531:266:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:demand shock, since in equilibrium it will tend to move output and inflationinthesame
4:104:6789:17:16:84:527:249:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:direction. As we will see in a moment, while the lending rateρis determined by the equilibrium
4:105:6883:16:17:84:526:233:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:in the lending market, the short-term rateiis set by the monetary authority, and so can be
4:106:6973:17:16:84:526:216:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:treated as a constant. For future reference we note that we will make the standard assumption
4:107:7066:16:17:84:526:200:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:that aggregate demand falls when any of the three arguments in equation (1) rises.  That is,
4:108:7158:17:16:84:527:183:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:both higher inflation and higher real interest rates result in lower level of aggregate demand.
4:109:7253:16:17:101:526:167:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Turning to the loan market, banks receive deposits and make loans. We have two cases.
4:110:7338:17:0:84:526:150:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:When the capital requirement is not binding, we write real loan supply when the bank has

5:112:7515:30:30:258:527:629:122:g_d0_f7:122:g_d0_f3:Lsu=B+(1−θ)D,(2)
5:113:7531:30:16:84:507:599:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:whereBis real bank capital,Dis the level of real deposits andθis reserve requirement.
5:114:7616:16:17:101:526:583:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:When the capital requirement is binding2, banksí lending cannot reach the level indicated
5:115:7705:17:16:84:526:566:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:in equation (2).  Instead, loan supply is constrained to be a multiple of bank capital. That
5:116:7797:16:16:84:95:550:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:is,

5:120:7975:17:16:101:526:476:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Next we need to model the relationship between bank deposits and bank capital on the
5:121:8059:16:16:84:530:460:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:one hand, and macroeconomic variables like output, interest rates, and inflationontheother.
5:122:8150:16:17:84:526:444:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:We assume that the level of real bank deposits,D, depends on both the level of real output
5:123:8240:17:30:84:347:427:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:and the real short-term interest rate.  We write this as
5:124:8296:30:31:264:527:397:122:g_d0_f7:122:g_d0_f3:D=D(y, i−πe),(4)
5:125:8312:31:17:84:527:366:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:where the function is increasing in thefirst argument and decreasing in the second argument.
5:126:8404:17:16:84:526:349:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:As for bank capital, it is assumed to rise and fall with aggregate economic activity.  That is,
5:127:8499:16:17:84:526:333:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:a rise in real output results in an increase in the value of bank assets.  This could be because
5:128:8595:17:16:84:526:316:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:of an increase in the value of tradable securities or because borrowers are now more able to
5:129:8687:16:30:84:358:300:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:repay their debts.  Using the established notation, this is
5:130:8746:30:31:281:527:270:122:g_d0_f7:122:g_d0_f3:B=B(y),(5)
5:131:8756:31:17:84:263:239:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:where the function is upward sloping.
5:132:8793:17:16:101:526:222:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:To complete the story of banks and the loan market, we turn to the demand side. We
5:133:8875:16:17:84:526:206:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:assume that real loan demand depends on the real loan rate and the level of real economic
5:134:8964:17:16:84:136:189:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:activity, so
5:135:8976:16:24:260:527:173:122:g_d0_f7:122:g_d0_f3:Ld=Ld(ρ−πe,y).(6)
5:136:8993:24:17:88:527:149:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:The higher the real loan rateρthe lower the loan demand, and the higher aggregate output
5:137:9081:17:0:97:513:132:36:g_d0_f3:83:g_d0_f3:2We will refer to this in the paper as ìbanks are capital-constrainedî or ìthe capital constraint binds.î
6:138:9227:0:17:84:229:659:122:g_d0_f7:122:g_d0_f3:ythe higher the loan demand.
6:139:9255:17:16:101:526:642:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:We use a standard supply curve in which output depends positively on unanticipated
6:140:9337:16:30:84:334:626:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:inflation plus an additive white-noise error. That is,
6:141:9391:30:30:258:527:596:122:g_d0_f7:122:g_d0_f3:ys=ys(π−πe)+%,(7)

6:144:9574:16:17:84:233:534:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:inflation in opposite directions.
6:145:9607:17:16:101:526:517:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:To determine the impact of capital requirements on aggregatefluctuations we need to
6:146:9690:16:17:84:526:501:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:compute the impact of a shock on output both when banks are constrained by the capital

6:159:10272:16:17:101:526:240:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:To solve this model, wefirst assume that agents have rational expectations, but are un-

6:161:10446:16:17:84:526:207:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:That is,πe=0.  Next, using the loan and goods market equilibrium conditions we solve for

6:163:10626:16:30:84:353:174:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:We write the resulting two solutions in compact form as

7:168:10897:16:17:101:526:626:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Our interest is in the reaction of output to a shock and how this changes as the bank goes

7:171:11132:17:16:101:526:576:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Taking derivatives with respect to shocks, we get two results: First, given a realization of
7:172:11224:16:16:84:526:560:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:shocks, real output responds to shocks more when the banking system is constrained by the
7:173:11313:16:33:84:408:544:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:capital requirement.  Computation shows that the following is true:

7:231:12469:24:17:84:526:132:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:We assume that the central bank is engaged in a stabilization policy. Monetary policymakers

8:265:14282:11:16:101:526:170:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:As is the normal case, monetary policy is capable of neutralizing aggregate demand shocks,
8:266:14372:16:16:84:527:154:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:but supply shocks will create a trade-offbetween output and inflation variability.   The
8:267:14460:16:15:97:527:138:36:g_d0_f3:83:g_d0_f3:3Another way to say this is that all agents get information about the shocks but with noises. Central banks
8:268:14567:15:0:84:473:123:83:g_d0_f3:83:g_d0_f3:can extract signals (the true shocks) perfectly from these information while private agents canít.
9:269:14706:0:17:84:526:659:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:important thing here is that the interest rate rule depends on whether the banking system is
9:270:14798:17:16:84:526:642:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:constrained by the capital requirement or not.  And, as we would expect, when the banking
9:271:14887:16:17:84:526:626:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:system is constrained the interest rate reaction is larger.  For an aggregate demand shock,

10:367:17795:16:17:84:526:137:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:important adjustments to the model (We have omitted the equilibrium condition for the goods
10:368:17886:17:0:84:526:120:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:market). First, the output gap in the aggregate demand equation (21a),yt+1, depends on the
11:369:18017:0:17:84:526:659:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:lagged output gap, as well as the real loan and policy-controlled interest rate.  And second,
11:370:18110:17:16:84:527:642:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:we write the aggregate supply equation (21f) with inflation on the left-hand-side, and it is a
11:371:18204:16:17:84:526:626:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:function of previous inflation.  As before, the loan rateρtis determined in the loan market
11:372:18295:17:16:84:526:609:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:depending on whether the banking system is constrained, and the central bank controls the
11:373:18384:16:17:84:526:593:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:short-term interest rateit. Demand shocks and supply shocks are assumed to be uncorrelated
11:374:18474:17:16:84:526:576:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:with each other and across time. Finally, whenαρequates zero and so lending is unimportant,
11:375:18565:16:16:84:303:560:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:the system collapses into the Svensson model.
11:376:18610:16:17:101:526:544:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:To solve the model, we compute the equilibrium loan rate using equations from (21b) to

11:378:18792:16:17:84:526:511:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:depend on whether the capital constraint binds. Substituting these results into the aggregate

11:380:18973:16:30:84:474:478:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:expectations, we obtain the following solution for the dynamics of the output gap

11:384:19271:17:16:84:526:385:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:defined in the Appendix.  When the short-term interest rate is constant, this economy can
11:385:19360:16:16:84:526:369:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:display the same behavior as the static model. As in Blum and Hellwig (1995), the impact of
11:386:19451:16:17:84:527:353:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:shocks upon output can be amplified by a capital-constrained banking system if bank capital
11:387:19542:17:16:84:526:336:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:is sufficiently responsive to the level of real output.  We present the details in the Appendix.
11:388:19638:16:17:101:526:320:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:The next step is to introduce a central bank engaged in a stabilization policy. Following

13:458:22821:17:16:84:526:511:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Specifically, we compare two policy regimes. Thefirst, labeled regimeI, assumes the policy-

13:476:24248:17:16:84:526:192:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:correct, we setByandDyto be 0.15 and 0.2, respectively.  The rest of the parameters are
13:477:24335:16:16:84:221:176:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:set primarily for illustration.

13:479:24476:15:0:84:432:145:83:g_d0_f3:83:g_d0_f3:while in our model this concern does not exist.  So, we use a more conventional value.

14:507:25863:15:11:84:526:141:83:g_d0_f3:83:g_d0_f3:downturn. Such situation does not occur frequently.  However, when it does, we believe that the coefficient

14:509:26081:11:0:84:526:119:83:g_d0_f3:83:g_d0_f3:in downturns, we choose to let the value of the real loan rate sensitivity of aggregate demand be the conventional

15:513:26501:17:32:84:483:609:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:the parameters so that the condition needed for the Blum and Hellwig result holds.
15:514:26583:32:23:84:226:577:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:4.2  Simulation Results
15:515:26606:23:17:84:526:554:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:We start with a baseline experiment in which the central bank does not react to shocks at
15:516:26695:17:16:84:526:537:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:all, instead keeping the policy-controlled rate constant. To give some sense of what these pa-
15:517:26789:16:17:84:526:521:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:rameter settings mean, we compute that a one-standard-deviation purely transitory negative
15:518:26879:17:16:84:526:504:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:shock to either aggregate demand or aggregate supply drives output down byfive times as
15:519:26966:16:32:84:416:488:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:much after four periods in the economy that is capital unconstrained.
15:520:27035:32:23:84:254:456:122:g_d0_f4:122:g_d0_f4:4.2.1  Transitory supply shock
15:521:27065:23:17:84:526:433:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Turningtotheexperiment,wefirst examine the impact of a one-standard-deviation purely
15:522:27149:17:16:84:532:416:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:transitory aggregate supply shock.   That is, we set%t=1fort=1,and0otherwise.
15:523:27226:16:16:84:526:400:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Furthermore, we set the initial conditions so that the economy is capital-constrained at the
15:524:27318:16:17:84:526:384:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:outset.  Under regimeIIthe central bank sets interest rates ignoring the capital constraint,
15:525:27410:17:16:84:526:367:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:using equation (24b). Under regimeI, the central bank takes account of the capital constraint
15:526:27503:16:17:84:526:351:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:and uses the interest rate rule given by equation (24a), switching to equation (24b) whenever
15:527:27596:17:16:84:526:334:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:the capital constraint no longer binds.  The resulting paths for output, inflation, and the
15:528:27687:16:17:84:527:318:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:interest rate are shown in Figure 1. As we would expect, the output and inflationfluctuations
15:529:27780:17:16:84:526:301:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:are much larger under regimeIIwhen the policymakers ignore the banking system.  But
15:530:27863:16:17:84:527:285:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:under regimeI, since interest rates are moved aggressively in response to the negative output
15:531:27956:17:16:84:526:268:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:gap at the outset, they are less variable over the entire horizon of the simulation.   The
15:532:28046:16:17:84:527:252:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:standard deviation of interest rates under regimeIandIIare 0.36 and 0.82 over 100 periods,
15:533:28136:17:16:84:142:235:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:respectively.
15:534:28149:16:16:101:527:219:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:More specifically, to offset a transitory inflationary supply shock, policy-controlled interest
15:535:28244:16:17:84:526:203:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:rate has to rise in the initial period. Over the following period, the fully-optimal policy (regime
15:536:28343:17:16:84:526:186:122:g_d0_f4:122:g_d0_f3:I) moves the interest rate low (aggressive) enough to counteract the procyclical effect of the
15:537:28437:16:17:84:527:170:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:binding capital constraint so that the inflation gap and the output gap are set on the optimal
15:538:28531:17:19:84:109:153:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:path.
15:539:28536:19:0:84:404:134:83:g_d0_f3:83:g_d0_f3:value of the real policy-controlled interest rate sensitivity of aggregate demand.
16:540:28660:0:17:101:527:659:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:The suboptimal policy (regimeII) is conducted with the same intention as the policy

16:542:28835:16:17:84:526:626:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:doesnít dampen the recession enough by setting the interest rate too high at period 2. Infigure
16:543:28930:17:16:84:526:609:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:1, from period 1 to period 9, the banking system is constrained by capital and policymakers
16:544:29021:16:17:84:527:593:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:keep conducting the suboptimal policy (regimeII). However, starting from period 10, bank
16:545:29109:17:16:84:526:576:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:capital constraints are not binding under policy regimeII, while the constraint always binds
16:546:29201:16:16:84:526:560:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:under policy regimeI.Fromperiod10,theinflation gap and the output gap are set on the
16:547:29285:16:17:84:526:544:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:optimal path.  The suboptimal policy (regimeII) generates significantly larger loss over the
16:548:29377:17:16:84:526:527:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:entire horizon.  Computing the loss over a horizon of 100 periods ó that is, we truncate the

16:550:29557:17:16:84:526:494:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:loss that is less than half the size (the simulated losses in regimeIand regimeIIare 4.7 and
16:551:29649:16:32:84:173:478:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:11.4, respectively).
16:552:29669:32:23:84:262:446:122:g_d0_f4:122:g_d0_f4:4.2.2  Transitory demand shock
16:553:29699:23:17:84:526:423:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:We examine the impact of a one-standard-deviation transitory aggregate demand shock with
16:554:29787:17:16:84:526:406:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:the same parameter configuration and present the paths of the output gap, inflation and the
16:555:29878:16:17:84:526:390:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:interest rate under different policy regimes in Figure 2.  That is, we setηt=−1fort=1,
16:556:29964:17:16:84:471:373:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:and 0 otherwise.  Again, the banking system is capital-constrained at the outset.
16:557:30045:16:16:101:527:357:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:In the period that the demand shock arrives, bank capital constraint binds.  Different
16:558:30131:16:17:84:527:341:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:policy regimes cause the output gap differ in the following period.  Namely, the optimal
16:559:30219:17:16:84:532:324:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:policy moves the interest rate low enough so that the output gap and inflationreturnto
16:560:30305:16:17:84:529:308:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:their optimal paths, while suboptimal policy fails to set the output gap and inflationontheir
16:561:30398:17:16:84:222:291:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:optimal paths until period 5.
16:562:30427:16:17:101:526:275:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:In this model, the demand shock is largely (but not completely) offset by the fully-optimal
16:563:30518:17:16:84:527:258:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f4:policy.  Computing the loss over 100 periods, wefind that the simulated losses in regimeI
16:564:30607:16:17:84:526:242:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:and regimeIIare 0.24 and 0.52, respectively.  The difference between two policy regimes is
16:565:30697:17:16:84:136:225:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:significant.
16:566:30709:16:16:101:526:209:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:As for the volatility of interest rates, the optimal interest rate is slightly variable than
16:567:30801:16:17:84:526:193:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:the suboptimal interest rate, with standard deviations being 0.25 and 0.21 over 100 periods,
16:568:30893:17:16:84:527:176:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:respectively.  But the relatively high volatility of the interest rate under regimeIpurely
16:569:30983:16:17:84:526:160:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:comes from the strong reaction in period 1.  After period 1, the interest rate is less variable
16:570:31078:17:0:84:158:143:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:under regimeI.

19:639:32472:0:28:84:347:659:207:g_d0_f4:207:g_d0_f4:5  What were Central Banks Doing?
19:640:32505:28:16:84:526:631:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:The simulation gives us some sense of how monetary policymakers should account for capital
19:641:32595:16:16:84:526:615:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:constraints. The next natural question is whether central banks in fact follow a strategy like
19:642:32689:16:17:84:526:599:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:the one our model suggests. In other words, do banksí balance sheets and capital requirements
19:643:32782:17:16:84:526:582:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:play a material role in central banksí decisions? In this section, we examine data to see what
19:644:32876:16:17:84:526:566:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:central banks were actually doing.  To characterize the actions of central banks, we adopt
19:645:32966:17:16:84:526:549:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:the now standard framework of estimating policy reaction functions, or the Taylor rule, for
19:646:33057:16:17:84:526:533:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:the central banks of three major countries in the world:  US, Germany (pre-unification) and
19:647:33148:17:16:84:526:516:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Japan.  In his original work, John Taylor (1993) characterized his now famous policy rule as
19:648:33240:16:16:84:526:500:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:a description of the Federal Reserve behavior from the mid-1980s through the early 1990s.
19:649:33329:16:17:84:526:484:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:That is, he suggested that what the FOMC actually did was to set the nominal federal funds
19:650:33419:17:16:84:144:467:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:rates so that

19:655:33727:16:16:84:526:377:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:potential or trend output.  Clarida, Gali and Gertler (1998, 2000) have proposed estimating
19:656:33818:16:17:84:526:361:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:a forward-looking version of this interest-rate rule based on the view that policymakers are
19:657:33910:17:30:84:415:344:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:forward-looking.  That is, they derive a reaction function of the form
19:658:33980:30:29:207:526:314:122:g_d0_f7:122:g_d0_f3:i∗t=r∗+π∗+γπ[Etπt,k−π∗]+γyEtyt,q,(29)

19:662:34282:17:16:84:526:235:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:the model to be well behaved, the coefficient on inflation has to be larger than one (recall
19:663:34374:16:16:84:364:219:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Taylorís original rule-of-thumb was to setγπequal to 1.5).
19:664:34432:16:17:101:526:203:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:To see whether the central bankís response to the output gap depends on the state of
19:665:34516:17:16:84:526:186:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:the banking system (as suggested by the theoretical models), we augment equation (29) with

20:674:35243:17:16:101:526:576:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Based on equations (24a) and (24b), all other things equal, the policy-controlled interest
20:675:35333:16:16:84:526:560:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:rate should be lower when the leverage ratio is above-the-trend in an downturn and higher

20:677:35512:17:16:84:527:527:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:stress in the banking system optimally, we expect the coefficient onsdt−1,γds,to be negative
20:678:35604:16:17:84:303:511:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:and the coefficient onsut−1,γus, to be positive.
20:679:35652:17:16:101:526:494:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:The observed interest rate adjusts smoothly to this desired level according to the partial

20:682:35792:25:16:84:527:437:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:whereΨ(L)is a polynomial in the lag operatorL,andυtis an i.i.d. random variable that we
20:683:35879:16:17:84:526:421:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:can think of as a monetary policy control error resulting from things like unanticipated shifts
20:684:35974:17:16:84:526:404:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:in the demand for bank reserves.  Equation (31) summarizes the view that policymakers
20:685:36059:16:17:84:526:388:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:are responding smoothly to a combination of inflation and the output gap. The standard
20:686:36145:17:16:84:526:371:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:procedure is to substitute equation (30) into equation (31) and estimate the resulting equation.
20:687:36241:16:16:101:527:355:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:We estimate this model using the Generalized Method of Moments8on quarterly data
20:688:36321:16:17:84:526:339:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:with two lags in the interest rate adjustment equation óΨ(L)is a second-order polynomial,
20:689:36410:17:16:84:526:322:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:assuming that expectation horizon for inflation is 4 quarters. In the table below, we reported
20:690:36504:16:17:84:526:306:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:the results for two expectation horizons of output gap (0 and 4 quarters). The instrument set
20:691:36597:17:16:84:526:289:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:for the estimation includes a constant, 3 lags of short-term interest rates, inflation, output
20:692:36691:16:17:84:527:273:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:gaps, producer price inflation, M2 growth (for Germany is M3), the term spreads between the
20:693:36782:17:16:84:417:256:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:long-term bond rate and short-term interest rate, and leverage ratios.
20:694:36852:16:17:101:526:240:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:For the U.S., our sample runs from 1989 to 2000, coinciding roughly with the Greenspan
20:695:36938:17:16:84:526:223:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Fed era before the stock market crashed in 2000, but starting two years late to avoid the
20:696:37027:16:16:84:526:207:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:changes in the banking regulation that occurred in the 1980s. For Germany, data begin in
20:697:37115:16:15:97:526:191:36:g_d0_f3:83:g_d0_f3:7Ideally, we would like to include a measure that tracks only the banks that are under stress ó what might
20:698:37221:15:11:84:526:176:83:g_d0_f3:83:g_d0_f3:be thought of as the marginal stress in the banking system.  Our average leverage ratio is a proxy for this
20:699:37328:11:11:84:526:165:83:g_d0_f3:83:g_d0_f3:marginal measure since high average measure implies that there have been a relatively large number of banks
20:700:37435:11:7:84:226:154:83:g_d0_f3:83:g_d0_f3:with relatively high leverage ratios.
20:701:37472:7:15:97:526:147:36:g_d0_f3:83:g_d0_f3:8Our estimation method relies on the assumption that all of the variables are stationary. We use the ADF
20:702:37576:15:11:84:527:132:83:g_d0_f3:83:g_d0_f3:test to reject the null hypothesis that there is a unit root in the interest rate or inflation for the US, Germany
20:703:37690:11:0:84:129:121:83:g_d0_f3:83:g_d0_f3:and Japan.

21:706:37904:16:17:101:526:626:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Turning to the data, for each country we use the overnight rate that is controlled by the
21:707:37993:17:16:84:526:609:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:central bank to measure the policy interest rate; inflation is measured by the consumer price
21:708:38086:16:17:84:526:593:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:index; the output gap is defined as the deviation of GDP from its potential.  The leverage
21:709:38176:17:16:84:526:576:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:ratio is measured as total loans of the banking system divided by the sum of bank equity and
21:710:38268:16:16:84:526:560:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:subordinated debts for the U.S., and total assets divided by bank capital plus reserves for
21:711:38359:16:17:84:526:544:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Germany and Japan.  Details of the sources and construction are described in the Appendix.
21:712:38449:17:16:101:526:527:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Estimation also requires that we make assumptions about both the target inflation (π∗)
21:713:38535:16:17:84:531:511:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:and the target natural real interest rate (r∗). FortheU.S.,weassumethesebothtobe2
21:714:38616:17:16:84:526:494:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:percent.  For Germany, the inflation target is set at 2 percent, and the natural real interest
21:715:38710:16:16:84:527:478:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:rate is determined in the estimation.  And for Japan, the inflation target is set as an HP
21:716:38800:16:17:84:375:462:122:g_d0_f5:122:g_d0_f3:filtered trend, and the natural real interest rate is estimated.
21:717:38864:17:16:101:526:445:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Before examining the estimation results, it is useful to take a brief look at the data on
21:718:38953:16:17:84:526:429:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:the leverage ratio.  The three panels of Figure 3 display data for each of the countries we
21:719:39044:17:16:84:526:412:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:study over the sample period we examine.  We note that a general downward trend in both
21:720:39131:16:17:84:526:396:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:the German and Japanese data is likely related to changes in regulatory standards.  For the
21:721:39222:17:0:84:326:379:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:U.S., leverage rose dramatically beginning in 1999.

23:753:40419:24:16:84:526:635:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Estimates of the various policymakersí reaction functions are summarized in the three panels
23:754:40511:16:17:84:526:619:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:of Table 2.  For each country we report estimates both with and without the leverage ratios
23:755:40602:17:16:84:526:602:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:(lagged and multiplied by the dummy variable that is one when output is above or below
23:756:40688:16:16:84:529:586:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f9:potential), and for two settings of the assumed expectation horizons for the output gap (q=0
23:757:40780:16:17:84:527:570:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:and 4). Thep- values of the tests of overidentifying restrictions for all specifications validate
23:758:40877:17:16:84:508:553:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:the moment conditions we use.  And theR2ís suggest that the modelsfit relatively well.
23:759:40963:16:17:101:526:537:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:We summarize the overall result as follows.  For the US, the estimated coefficients on
23:760:41049:17:16:84:526:520:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:the inflation gap are larger than unity, implying stability, and close to the original Taylor
23:761:41142:16:17:84:527:504:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:benchmark of 1.5. The coefficients on the output gap are close or larger than the benchmark
23:762:41233:17:16:84:526:487:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:value of 0.5.  Looking at the results for where the policymaker is assumed react to both
23:763:41321:16:17:84:527:471:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:current and future output gap (q=0and4), wefirst see that, while the signs ofγdsare
23:764:41404:17:16:84:526:454:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:negative in both cases, the data donotsupport addingsdt−1to the policy rule.  That is, the
23:765:41494:16:17:84:526:438:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:FOMC didnotreact strongly to the state of banking system during economic downturns.
23:766:41577:17:16:84:526:421:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Although the standard error forγdsis large, it is still helpful to get some ideas of the economic
23:767:41674:16:16:84:526:405:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:magnitude of the response.  In this case, a one-standard-deviation increase in the leverage
23:768:41765:16:17:84:526:389:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:ratio equals 1.82 and that this is estimated to result in a 0.36 - percent cut in the federal
23:769:41858:17:16:84:244:372:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:funds rate, all other things equal.
23:770:41893:16:17:101:526:356:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Next, we see that the signs ofγusare positive and significant in both cases, the data do
23:771:41981:17:16:84:526:339:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:support addingsut−1to the reaction rule.  That is, the FOMC did raise federal funds rate
23:772:42069:16:17:84:526:323:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:when the leverage ratio is high-than-trend9during an upturn, all other things equal.  The
23:773:42158:17:16:84:527:306:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:point estimate of the coefficient is large, implying that a one-standard-deviation rise in the
23:774:42252:16:16:84:497:290:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:leverage ratio causes a 2.8-percent rise in the federal funds rate, all other things equal.
23:775:42343:16:17:101:526:274:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Turning to the German case, we start by noting that the coefficients before inflation and
23:776:42432:17:16:84:526:257:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:output gap are close to the original Taylor values.  Turning to the banking system stress
23:777:42521:16:17:84:526:241:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:variable, to the extent that the Bundesbankdidreact, it did so in a way that appears to have
23:778:42613:17:16:84:527:224:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:made matters worse.  The estimate ofγdsis significantly positive and the sign ofγusis both
23:779:42703:16:16:84:526:208:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:negative and significant. These coefficients imply that a one-standard-deviation increase in
23:780:42795:16:17:84:526:192:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:leverage ratio will raise call money rate by 5 percent in a downturn and lower it by 0.9 percent
23:781:42891:17:16:84:148:175:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:in an upturn.
23:782:42904:16:16:101:526:159:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Our estimates for the Bank of Japan are reported in the bottom panel of the table.
23:783:42986:16:15:97:526:143:36:g_d0_f3:83:g_d0_f3:9The high leverage ratio during an upturn could be the result of credit expansion due to loan demand rather
23:784:43093:15:0:84:381:128:83:g_d0_f3:83:g_d0_f3:than bank capital deterioration, so we must interpret this result carefully.
24:785:43211:0:17:84:526:659:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:For most specifications, the coefficients on inflation and the output gap look a bit large.
24:786:43302:17:16:84:527:642:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Regardless of other settings, wefind that the datadosupport addingsdt−1to the policy rule
24:787:43391:16:17:84:526:626:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:but, as in the German case, the resulting coefficient estimates are of thewrongsign.  To get
24:788:43483:17:16:84:526:609:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:some ideas of the economic magnitude of the response, we can compute that a one-standard-
24:789:43572:16:17:84:526:593:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:deviationrisein the leverage ratio during a downturn equals 1.56 and that this causes a
24:790:43659:17:16:84:526:576:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:2-percentrisein the call money rate, all other things equal.  As for the coefficient before
24:791:43750:16:16:84:527:560:122:g_d0_f7:122:g_d0_f3:sut−1,they are negative and insignificant.  Bank of Japandidnot react to the stress in the
24:792:43840:16:17:84:226:544:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:banking system in an upturn.
24:793:43868:17:16:101:526:527:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Taken together, the estimates of these policy reaction functions suggest that FOMCís
24:794:43952:16:17:84:526:511:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:policy is most consistent with the model prediction, that is, tolower(raise) interest rate in
24:795:44045:17:16:84:526:494:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:response to the stress in the banking system when the economy is in a downturn (an upturn).
24:796:44136:16:17:84:526:478:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:By contrast, our results suggest that the policymakers in Germany and Japan raised their
24:797:44224:17:16:84:526:461:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:overnight interest rates, relative to the baseline, during period when output was below trend
24:798:44317:16:38:84:513:445:122:g_d0_f3:63:g_d0_f3:and their banks were under stress ó the opposite of what our model suggests is optimal.10
24:799:44406:38:27:84:192:407:207:g_d0_f4:207:g_d0_f4:6  Conclusions
24:800:44420:27:17:84:526:380:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:Changes in bank lending are an important determinant of economicfluctuations.  Central
24:801:44506:17:16:84:527:363:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:banks, in working to meet their stabilization goals, strive to ensure a sufficient supply of
24:802:44598:16:17:84:527:347:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:loans.   In their effort to maintain a stablefinancial system, regulators can work against
24:803:44688:17:16:84:526:330:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:this objective. Capital requirements are a clear example.  By dictating that all banks must
24:804:44779:16:17:84:526:314:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:maintain sufficient capital with respect to their risk exposures, capital requirements can limit
24:805:44875:17:16:84:526:297:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:the lending capacity of the banking system.   Although the need for avoiding working at
24:806:44962:16:17:84:526:281:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:cross-purposes is recognized, it is not clear whether central banks have formulated an optimal
24:807:45056:17:15:84:447:264:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:strategy, namely, taken into account the impact of the capital requirements.
24:808:45132:15:15:93:526:249:36:g_d0_f3:83:g_d0_f3:10To check the robustness, we also use alternative measures of inflation, different lags of interest rate ad-

26:848:47490:0:17:101:526:659:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:This paper does three things. First, we confirm the resultsfirst derived by Blum and Hell-
26:849:47580:17:16:84:526:642:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:wig (1995) that in the presence of completely passive monetary policy, capital requirements are
26:850:47675:16:17:84:526:626:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:procyclical. That is, when banks become capital constrained shocks to the economy generate
26:851:47765:17:16:84:526:609:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:larger movements in output. Our second result is to establish that optimal monetary policy
26:852:47855:16:17:84:526:593:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:will neutralize the procyclical impact of capital requirements.  That is, the capital adequacy
26:853:47949:17:16:84:526:576:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:regulation need not encumber monetary policymakers in their pursuit of their goal.  Finally,
26:854:48041:16:16:84:526:560:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:we present evidence suggesting that while the Federal Reserve has been reacting as our model
26:855:48133:16:17:84:526:544:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:suggests the German and Japanese central banks clearly have not. Blum and Hellwig need
26:856:48219:17:0:84:403:527:122:g_d0_f3:122:g_d0_f3:not be right in theory, but they may very well be right in practice.
