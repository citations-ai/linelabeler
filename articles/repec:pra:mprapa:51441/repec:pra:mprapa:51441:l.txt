2:35:963:13:13:72:525:426:11:Times New Roman:11:Times New Roman:F:Abstract – This paper presents a conceptual analysis of terms belonging to the semantic field of state 
2:36:1065:13:12:72:526:413:11:Times New Roman:11:Times New Roman:F:restructuring. The analysis aims  to critically reviewing different terms  focusing the  attention both to 
2:37:1171:12:13:72:526:401:11:g_d0_f8:11:Times New Roman:F:the definitional and to the measurement sides. Different “types of decentralisation” are separately 
2:38:1271:13:13:72:526:388:11:Times New Roman:11:Times New Roman:F:presented    before    reviewing    a    generalised    approach    aiming    both    at    conceptualising    and 
2:39:1386:13:12:72:526:375:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f8:F:operationalising “regional authority” inside the internal structure of the state. In the final part the 
2:40:1490:12:13:72:525:363:11:Times New Roman:11:Times New Roman:F:discourse is further generalised in order to take into account also external actors linking the analysis 
2:41:1594:13:13:72:526:350:11:Times New Roman:11:Times New Roman:F:with  the  analytical  framework  of  globalisation.  The  analysis  confirms  the  persistence  of  a  strong 
2:42:1705:13:12:72:525:337:11:Times New Roman:11:Times New Roman:F:potential   for   confusion   generating   from   the   multitude   of   meanings attached   to   the   term 
2:43:1813:12:13:72:525:325:11:g_d0_f8:11:Times New Roman:F:“decentralisation” and its related  terms.  However,  having  assembled  terms  together  contributes  to 
2:44:1918:13:13:72:526:312:11:Times New Roman:11:Times New Roman:F:clarify and to interpret them more critically and in a more focused way. Moreover, the attention paid 
2:45:2020:13:12:72:525:299:11:Times New Roman:11:Times New Roman:F:to the measurement side of the issue contributes also critically to interpret empirical analyses already 
2:46:2124:12:13:72:526:287:11:Times New Roman:11:Times New Roman:F:realised in literature and, in perspective, could be a promising starting point for more focused future

2:51:2332:40:17:72:165:190:14:Times New Roman:11:Times New Roman:C:1. Introduction 
2:52:2347:17:14:72:526:173:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Beginning   from  the  1970s  increasing  pressures  towards  a  “state-rescaling”  process – 
2:53:2440:14:13:72:526:159:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:generally  characterised  by  a  transfer  of  power  and  resources  from  central  to  lower  levels  of 
2:54:2547:13:14:72:526:146:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:government  but  also  to  external  actors - have  been  registered  as  global  trend  linked  to 
2:55:2646:14:14:72:526:132:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:globalization (Jessop, 2002;  Rodríguez-Pose  and  Gill, 2005;  Rodríguez-Pose  and  Ezcurra, 
2:56:2737:14:0:72:525:118:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:B:2009) and to the neoliberal argument that a rescaled state will reduce the state’s intervention 
3:57:2833:0:14:72:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  unleash  market  forces1 (Jessop, 2002;  Lobao  and  Hooks, 2003;  Brenner, 2004;  Harvey, 
3:58:2924:14:14:72:105:745:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2005). 
3:59:2930:14:14:108:526:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:In order to interpret and (to some extent) steer this process since 1950s a vast body of 
3:60:3019:14:14:72:526:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:literature  has  been  developed  by  academic  and  practitioners  drawing  on  different  fields  of 
3:61:3122:14:13:72:526:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:social  science  - economics (Tiebout, 1956;  Oates, 1999, 2006)), politics (Loughlin, 2001; 
3:62:3211:13:14:72:526:690:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Keating et  al., 2009), geography (Jones et  al., 2005), sociology,  history,  anthropology,  and, 
3:63:3305:14:14:72:526:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:planning (Houghton, 2005) - often  conflating  the  analysis  with  other  issues  such  as 
3:64:3393:14:14:72:522:662:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:democracy (Drèze and Sen, 2002) and market reforms or markestisation (Lobao et al., 2009).

3:66:3479:14:13:108:526:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:This   multidisciplinary   interest   in   this   rescaling   process   aiming   to   analyse   its 
3:67:3579:13:14:72:526:621:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:determinants  and  its  link  to  state’s  outcomes  (primarily)  measured  in  terms  of  growth, 
3:68:3678:14:14:72:526:607:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:inequality,   and   political   stability   led to   a   deeper   understanding   of   this   multifaceted 
3:69:3785:14:14:72:526:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:phenomenon. However, the stratification of researches belonging to different traditions raises 
3:70:3879:14:14:72:526:579:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:also  several  methodological  issues2 (Cohen  and  Peterson, 1996). To  the  case  at  hand,  the 
3:71:3976:14:13:72:526:565:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:B:variety  of  approaches  followed  across  different  studies  contributed  to  “attach  a  startling 
3:72:4078:13:14:72:526:552:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:diversity  of  definitions  and  measures  to  the  decentralisation concept [so  that] there  is  little 
3:73:4182:14:14:72:526:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:agreement    about    what    constitutes    an    example    of    decentralization,    what    causes 
3:74:4286:14:14:72:489:524:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:decentralization, or what effects it is likely to have” (Schneider, 2003, p. 32 and 33).    
3:75:4375:14:14:108:111:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: 
3:76:4375:14:13:108:526:496:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The  effects  of  this  proliferation  of  definitions  and  measures  are ex  ante unclear.  On 
3:77:4471:13:14:72:526:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the one hand, it could be intended as a resource in order to better take into account a different 
3:78:4569:14:14:72:526:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:forms,   varieties   or   variegation   of   decentralisation from   different   perspectives both 
3:79:4667:14:14:72:526:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:conceptually and empirically. On the other hand, there is the risk that, as a result of the lack 
3:80:4764:14:14:72:525:441:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of  a  (clear)  and  shared  definition,  analyses  become  less  precise,  difficult  to  compare  each 
3:81:4869:14:13:72:525:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:other,  and,  in  turn,  less  effective. Put  differently,  it  could  be  said  that  in  the  case  of 
3:82:4974:13:14:72:523:414:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:decentralisation, in Lakoff (1987)’s terms, it is  not  clear  whether  a  problem  of  under-
3:83:5065:14:14:72:275:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:specification or over-specification arises.

3:85:5108:14:14:108:526:372:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:A:Not    only    different    meanings have  been  attributed  to  “decentralisation” 
3:86:5191:14:13:72:526:358:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(administrative, fiscal, political, spatial), but also many different terms are often used in order 
3:87:5291:13:14:72:526:345:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to  refer  to  changes  involving  the  balance  of  power  and  competencies  between  central 
3:88:5387:14:14:72:526:331:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:government  and  other  actors both  at  sub-national  and  supra-national  level  often  generating 
3:89:5488:14:14:72:526:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:conceptual  confusion.  Hand  in  hand  with  research  progress  in  this  field a set of “de-terms“ 
3:90:5589:14:14:72:526:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(or   related as   federalism   and   regionalism)   came into the limelight: deconcentration, 
3:91:5680:14:13:72:386:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:delegation, denationalisation, destatisation, and, devolution.

3:93:5750:14:16:108:526:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:This circumstance makes it worth developing a conceptual analysis on different terms 
3:94:5835:16:16:72:525:246:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:utilised across  studies  aiming  to  highlight  differences  between  them  at  the  same  time  as

3:97:6083:7:16:72:524:205:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:1 Forms  of  decentralisation  closely  linked  to  market  arguments  are  marketisation,  and  spatial  decentralisation 
3:98:6205:16:12:72:525:189:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:where the former refers to the process by which the supply side and the demand side are made closer in order to 
3:99:6316:12:11:72:525:177:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f8:F:capture  individuals’  preferences.  This  process  is  linked  to  recent  trends  toward  economic  liberalization, 
3:100:6434:11:12:72:525:166:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:privatization,  and  the  demise  of  command  economies.  While  the  latter  refers  to  regional  planning  policies 
3:101:6554:12:11:72:525:154:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:aiming at reducing excessive urban concentration in a few large cities by promoting regional growth poles that 
3:102:6665:11:12:72:390:143:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:have potential to become centres of manufacturing and agricultural marketing.

3:104:6743:7:16:72:526:124:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:2 According  to  the  Authors  in  addition  to careless  use  of  conceptual definitions, these  include  misconceptions 
3:105:6863:16:11:72:525:108:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:and   unrealistic   expectations,   unsystematic   presentations, an   overemphasis   on   cases   of   failure,   lack   of 
3:106:6987:11:12:72:525:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:comparability among diverse case studies, neglect of historical patterns that generate complexity, inappropriate 
3:107:7099:12:11:72:525:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:linear assumptions, and ideological arguments that bureaucracies should be dramatically reduced and power and 
3:108:7209:11:0:72:524:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:responsibility for public sector tasks be transferred to local communities, private sector firms, and organizations.

4:110:7422:16:16:72:526:743:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the literature,  concerns  how  different  concepts  are  translated  into  empirical  analysis.    In 
4:111:7525:16:24:72:256:727:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Brenner’s words there is the need for  
4:112:7562:24:14:72:525:703:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:greater  attention  to  question  of  method - specifically  to  the  mediation  linking  abstract  concepts  to  concrete, 
4:113:7685:14:13:72:526:689:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:contextually  specific  investigation.  Careful  exploration  of  such  mediations  could  facilitate  analytically  robust, 
4:114:7810:13:13:72:525:676:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:intellectually  challenging  lines  of  concrete  research,  which  might  then be mobilized  as  a  basis  for  refining

4:117:8062:25:16:108:526:625:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Bearing these issues in mind, in what follows, a brief review of different terms related 
4:118:8151:16:16:72:525:609:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to state rescaling is presented aiming at filling the conceptual gap between studies developed 
4:119:8244:16:16:72:526:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:from different perspectives by proposing a synoptic view of meanings developed over them.

4:122:8539:16:16:72:526:545:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:common  point  of  different  terms  concerns  the  balance  of  power,  responsibilities,  and 
4:123:8635:16:15:72:525:529:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:competencies  between  the  central  state  and other entities.  This  circumstance  justifies  the 
4:124:8735:15:16:72:526:514:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:research   toward   a   common   analytical   framework   for   considering   these   terms,   while 
4:125:8836:16:16:72:526:498:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:differences  between  terms  could  be  traced  in  directions,  degree,  and/or  type,  extent,  and 
4:126:8938:16:26:72:223:482:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:nature of attributions involved. 
4:127:8970:26:16:108:526:456:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Given the empirical attention devoted to the issue of spatial transformation of the state 
4:128:9060:16:16:72:526:440:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and its effects, the conceptual analysis is linked, for each term, with the critical consideration 
4:129:9159:16:16:72:526:424:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of additional issue concerning how concepts have been translated into empirical analysis (i.e. 
4:130:9253:16:25:72:175:408:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:measurement issue).  
4:131:9273:25:16:108:525:383:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The   paper   is   organised   as   follows.   Sections   2   presents different   types   of 
4:132:9366:16:16:72:526:367:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:decentralisation   considering   them   separately.   Section   3   focuses   on   three   types   of 
4:133:9468:16:16:72:526:351:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:administrative  decentralisation:  deconcentration,  delegation,  and  devolution.  Section  4  deals 
4:134:9570:16:16:72:526:335:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:with  the  related  term  “federalism”.  Section  5  proposes  a  generalised  approach  based  on 
4:135:9669:16:16:72:526:319:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:“regional authority”. Section 6 shifts the attention  to  the  international  perspective  of  state 
4:136:9770:16:28:72:407:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:restructuring process. Section 7 develops some concluding remarks.   
4:137:9838:28:14:72:186:275:14:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2. Decentralisation 
4:138:9857:14:13:72:75:261:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
4:139:9857:13:14:72:526:248:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Decentralisation is  a  rather  elusive  term affected  by  a  generalised  confusion  about  its 
4:140:9953:14:14:72:526:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:meaning which is subject to change according to different perspectives of analysis. Although 
4:141:10045:14:14:72:526:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:there is  persistent confusion, a general agreement is achieved about its negative definition. In 
4:142:10142:14:14:72:526:206:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:other words, it is well known what is not decentralisation but there is no agreement on what it 
4:143:10236:14:13:72:526:192:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:actually  is.  Indeed,  “most  would  agree  that  transferring  power and  resources  to  national 
4:144:10336:13:14:72:526:179:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:governments is not decentralisation” (Schneider, 2003, p. 33). Moving from this last point, a 
4:145:10427:14:14:72:526:165:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:shared positive element  of  decentralisation focuses  on the  transfer  of  power  and  resources 
4:146:10524:14:14:72:252:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:away from the central government.    
4:147:10560:14:14:108:111:137:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: 
4:148:10560:14:13:108:526:123:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:A:Indeed, in  public  planning,  management  and  decision-making it is defined as “the 
4:149:10646:13:14:72:526:110:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:transfer of authority and power from higher to lower levels of government or from national to 
4:150:10740:14:14:72:476:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:subnational levels” (Rondinelli et al., 1984; Collins and Green, 1994; Mills, 1994).

5:152:10825:0:14:108:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Therefore,  it  is  worth  stressing  that  decentralization  and  centralization  represent  two 
5:153:10923:14:14:72:526:745:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:ends  of  a  single  continuum  so  that  it  is  possible  focusing  on  institutions receiving power  or 
5:154:11029:14:14:72:526:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:resources  or,  by  contrast, on  power  and  resources  that  are  taken  away from central 
5:155:11121:14:14:72:526:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:governments (Schneider,  1993). A  peculiar  feature  that  is  also  worth  stressing  is  that 
5:156:11216:14:13:72:526:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:decentralisation  refers  to  a  transfer  of  power  that  happens  in  a political-administrative  and 
5:157:11320:13:13:72:526:690:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:territorial hierarchy in the sense that decentralized authorities are upwardly accountable to central 
5:158:11422:13:13:72:526:677:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:government (Agrawal  and  Ribot,  1999, Crook  and  Manor, 1998). In Sherwood (1969)’s terms, 
5:159:11513:13:14:72:526:664:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:decentralisation (as opposed to devolution) involve the creation of units of governance under the 
5:160:11611:14:14:72:526:650:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:direct control of central authority. At  the  macro-level  of  analysis,  should  be  noted  that 
5:161:11707:14:14:72:526:636:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:decentralization  has  both  a  state  and  a  process  dimension. The  latter  refers  to  a  dynamic 
5:162:11810:14:14:72:526:622:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:consideration  of  the  phenomenon  in  order  to  analyse  its  evolution  over  time  (consider,  for 
5:163:11914:14:13:72:526:608:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:example,  the  recent work  of Karanikolas  and Hatzipanteli (2010) with  respect  to  rural 
5:164:12003:13:14:72:526:595:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:development  policy  in  Greece). Intended  as  a  state (i.e. at  a  fixed  point  according  to  a  time 
5:165:12108:14:14:72:526:581:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:dimension) decentralisation can be analysed  focusing both on level and degree. Referring to 
5:166:12200:14:14:72:526:567:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the former, decentralization may occur at system as a whole or at the organizational level.  It 
5:167:12294:14:13:72:526:553:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:is said that it happens at the organisational level – and not in the system as a whole - when it 
5:168:12387:13:14:72:526:540:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:involves   the   distribution   of   power   over   the   decision-making   process inside a   single 
5:169:12488:14:14:72:526:526:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:organisation (Mintzberg, 1979). Figure  1  aims  at  synthesise  macro-categories  presented

5:174:12612:14:14:72:526:457:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: With   particular   regard   to   degree,   moving also from   the   assumption   that 
5:175:12699:14:14:72:526:443:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:“decentralization is not an end in itself but rather should be designed and evaluated for its

5:177:12893:14:13:72:525:415:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:soundness” (Bossert, 1998,  p.1513), it  is  easy to recognise  that  in  order  to analyse and 
5:178:12987:13:14:72:526:402:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:compare  different  experiences  of  decentralisation  a  crucial  point is  represented  by  the 
5:179:13084:14:14:72:217:388:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:empirical representation of it. 
5:180:13115:14:14:72:111:374:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:  
5:181:13115:14:14:72:526:360:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: The  empirical  representation  (or measurement),  in  turn,  is  also  clearly  linked  to  the 
5:182:13212:14:13:72:525:346:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:process side of the phenomenon since repeated measurement over time could return a crude 
5:183:13300:13:14:72:526:333:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:measure of its evolution. Nevertheless, decentralisation, in its broader sense is impossible to 
5:184:13396:14:14:72:525:319:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:measure according to a single – simple - metric, and, in turn, decentralisation as a whole risks 
5:185:13491:14:14:72:526:305:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:having no  significant  explanatory power. Indeed,  from  its  nature  of  complex  multilevel 
5:186:13585:14:14:72:526:291:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:phenomenon  concerning  several  administrative,  fiscal,  and  political  dimensions,  arise  the 
5:187:13684:14:13:72:525:277:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:difficulty  to  adopt analytic  criteria able  to  capture  all  dimensions  in  a  single  metric  able  to 
5:188:13792:13:14:72:428:264:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:quantify concepts as autonomy, accountability, power, and responsibility. 
5:189:13865:14:14:72:75:250:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
5:190:13865:14:14:72:526:236:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: For example, widespread measures of decentralisation have been developed on fiscal 
5:191:13948:14:14:72:526:222:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:basis.  Nevertheless,  as  discussed before,  those types of  fiscal  measures could  be  misleading 
5:192:14046:14:13:72:328:208:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:measures of power and authority for several reasons. 
5:193:14097:13:14:72:111:195:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:  
5:194:14097:14:14:72:526:181:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: Therefore,  rather  than  measuring  decentralisation  scholars  refer  to dimensions of  it 
5:195:14188:14:14:72:525:167:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(Schneider,  2003).  In  other  words,  what  is  needed our approaches  allow  us  to  disaggregate 
5:196:14288:14:14:72:526:153:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  dimensions  over  which  local  authorities have  a  defined  range  of  power,  avoiding  seeing 
5:197:14390:14:13:72:446:139:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:decentralization as a single transfer of a block of authority and responsibility.

5:199:14471:14:14:108:525:112:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Following  this tuck,  in  a  principal-agent  approach  applied  to  the  health  system, 
5:200:14562:14:14:72:526:98:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:B:Bossert  (1998,  p.  1518) proposes the concept of “decision space” defined as “the range of 
5:201:14654:14:0:72:526:84:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:effective choice that is allowed by the central authorities (the principal) to be utilized by local 
6:202:14755:0:14:72:525:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:authorities  (the  agents)”. Decision  space  is  defined  in  terms  of  functions  and  degrees  of 
6:203:14856:14:14:72:525:745:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:choice  over  which  local  authorities,  in  case  of  decentralisation,  will  have  increased  power. 
6:204:14961:14:14:72:526:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Five functions are considered: (i) finance, (ii) service organization, (iii) human resources, (iv) 
6:205:15060:14:14:72:526:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:access rules, and, (v) governance rules. Each function is, in turn, divided into “choices”. For 
6:206:15154:14:13:72:526:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:example,  regarding  the  finance  function,  three  choices  are proposed:  source  of  revenue, 
6:207:15252:13:14:72:526:690:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:allocation  of  expenditure,  fees,  and,  contracts. Quantifiable  indicators  are  proposed  for  each 
6:208:15356:14:14:72:529:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:choice. In  the  case  of  the  finance  example  the  three  choices are  respectively  quantified  as  
6:209:15459:14:14:72:526:662:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:“intergovernmental  transfers  as  percent  of  total  local  health  spending”, “percent  of  local 
6:210:15560:14:14:72:526:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:spending that is explicitly earmarked by higher authorities”, “range of prices local authorities 
6:211:15657:14:13:72:526:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:are  allowed”,  and,   “number  of  models  allowed” Bossert  (1998,  p.1519). Complete  and

6:218:16030:14:14:108:526:538:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:First, since it focuses on static measures, it considers decentralisation as a “state” 
6:219:16117:14:14:72:526:524:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:B:rather than as  a process,  capturing synthesised decentralised function “one shot” rather than 
6:220:16211:14:14:72:526:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:following its evolution during time. Second, in terms of the continuum between centralisation 
6:221:16304:14:13:72:523:496:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  decentralisation,  its  point  of  view  is  based  on  power  and  resources received by  lower-
6:222:16405:13:14:72:526:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:level  institution. A  different  perspective  is  proposed  by Schneider  (2003) which aims  to 
6:223:16499:14:14:72:526:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:measure decentralisation in terms of the degree to which power and resources are taken away 
6:224:16589:14:14:72:526:455:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:B:from  central  governments, based  on the consideration that “all forms of decentralization, 
6:225:16680:14:14:72:526:441:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regardless  of  the  recipient,  involve  shifting  power  and  resources  away  from  the  central 
6:226:16780:14:13:72:526:427:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:government” (Schneider, 2003, p.35). Furthermore, Schneider (2003)’s main contribution to 
6:227:16868:13:14:72:526:414:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  decentralisation  measurement  issue  consists  in  clearly  considering  a  tripartite  (fiscal, 
6:228:16971:14:14:72:526:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:administrative,  political)  dimension  of  decentralisation  empirically  (testing  and)  supporting 
6:229:17073:14:14:72:526:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  assumption  that  these  dimensions  could  be  considered independent  (or orthogonal). 
6:230:17166:14:14:72:526:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Indeed, according  to  arguments  mentioned  above  regarding  the  methodological  difficulty  to 
6:231:17265:14:13:72:526:358:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:use  a  single  metric  to  deal  with  decentralisation,    these  dimensions  have  been  considered

6:239:17644:14:14:72:526:248:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:definition is provided by pointing out that, from a broader economic perspective, the scope of 
6:240:17739:14:14:72:526:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:state  rescaling  involves  four  main  activities;  namely,  regulation,  financing,  administration, 
6:241:17842:14:13:72:526:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and service delivery (Philip, 1954). However, panel data on regulation can not easily be used 
6:242:17936:13:14:72:526:207:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:for  cross-countries  studies. Therefore,  this  concept  is  of  little  significance  in  empirical 
6:243:18038:14:14:72:526:193:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:studies. Analysis  based  on  remaining  three  roles  of  government  can  be  synthesised  as  the 
6:244:18139:14:14:72:526:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:analysis   of   the   scope   of   the   relative   roles   of   levels   of   government   in   financing, 
6:245:18247:14:14:72:526:165:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:B:administration,  and  service  deliver. Furthermore, these processes are “encapsulated” in the 
6:246:18341:14:13:72:526:151:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:state’s activities dealing with revenue collection and public expenditure. Hence, according to 
6:247:18435:13:14:72:526:138:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Martinez-Vazquez and Timofeev (2009, p. 86) fiscal decentralization consists of an increased 
6:248:18525:14:14:72:525:124:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:B:role  of  sub-national  governments  “in  the  vertical  government  distribution  of  powers  for 
6:249:18624:14:14:72:267:110:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:raising and spending public resources”.  
6:250:18663:14:0:72:75:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
7:251:18664:0:14:72:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: The  latter  definition  of  fiscal  decentralisation  addresses  directly  the  issue  of  its 
7:252:18760:14:14:72:526:745:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:measurement. Indeed, a common measure of fiscal decentralisation is represented by the ratio 
7:253:18853:14:14:72:526:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of  subnational government  spending  to  general  government spending (Rodríguez-Pose  and 
7:254:18944:14:14:72:526:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Gill, 2004;  Oates, 2006). This  choice  is  made  also  in  order  to  take  into  account  that 
7:255:19039:14:13:72:526:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:frequently   different   functions,   rather   than   being   exclusive   responsibility   of   a   single 
7:256:19146:13:14:72:526:690:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:jurisdiction,  are  shared  across  different  jurisdictions.    Thus,  the  underlying  idea  is  that  the 
7:257:19255:14:14:72:500:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:more a jurisdiction has decision-making power the higher its share in total expenditure.

7:259:19343:14:14:108:526:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:From  a  different  perspective  fiscal  decentralisation  is  measured  in  literature  as  the 
7:260:19440:14:13:72:525:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:ratio  of  locally  generated  revenue  to  the  general  government  revenue. Also  a  mixed 
7:261:19534:13:14:72:525:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(considering  together  expenditure  and  revenue  measures) proxy is  proposed  by  Boetti  et  al. 
7:262:19635:14:14:72:526:607:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(2010)  defining  fiscal autonomy “as  the  percentage  of  current  expenditures  in  selected 
7:263:19730:14:14:72:525:593:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:functions covered by local taxes” in  order  to  capture  the  incentive  scheme  arising  under 
7:264:19826:14:14:72:526:579:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:devolution. The  underlying  idea of  measures  considering  the  revenue  side is  based on  how 
7:265:19921:14:13:72:525:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:much  local  government  are  responsible  for  financing  public  goods  delivery. Both  indicator 
7:266:20020:13:14:72:526:552:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:based  on  expenditure  and  on  tax  revenue  present,  however,  several  drawbacks.  Indeed,  the 
7:267:20121:14:14:72:526:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:subnational  expenditure  ratio  of total  expenditure  (i)  is  not  able  to distinguish  between    tax 
7:268:20226:14:14:72:529:524:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  non-tax  revenue  sources,  at  the  same  time  as  (ii)  it  does  not  capture  the  type  and  
7:269:20330:14:14:72:526:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:proportion  of  intergovernmental  transfers  that  could  negatively  affect  the  real  degree  of 
7:270:20431:14:13:72:526:496:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:separateness enjoyed by lower level of government in case where it is constrained to act as a 
7:271:20523:13:14:72:526:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:spending  agent  of  the  upper-level  governments (Ebel  and  Yilmaz, 2002;  Martinez-Vazquez 
7:272:20617:14:14:72:526:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  Timofeev, 2009); in  addition,  such  a  measure  (iii)  does  not  take  into account  efficiency 
7:273:20719:14:14:72:525:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(so  that  increased  subnational  expenditure,  rather  than  registering  higher importance in

7:275:20922:14:13:72:526:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:especially  in  the  case  of  sector-based expenditure,  local  preferences (Martinez-Vazquez  and 
7:276:21021:13:14:72:164:414:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Timofeev, 2009).

7:278:21038:14:14:108:529:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Furthermore,  simply  considering  the  share  of  local  expenditure  does  not allow  to  
7:279:21130:14:14:72:526:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:consider the structure and the development of production process involving devolved public 
7:280:21221:14:13:72:526:358:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:goods  and  could  be  misleading  if  the  division  of  tasks  between  central/local  government  is 
7:281:21325:13:14:72:526:345:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:consistent   with   a   capital/labour   intensive   production   function   criterion. According   to 
7:282:21426:14:14:72:526:331:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:“Baumol (1967)’s disease”, as a result of the technological progress, goods characterised by a 
7:283:21520:14:14:72:526:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:labour  intensive  production  function  will  register  increased (relative) production  costs. 
7:284:21616:14:14:72:526:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Therefore, the level of government responsible for the production of goods characterised by a 
7:285:21710:14:13:72:526:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:labour  intensive  process  (e.g.  education,  amusement)  will  require  (and  manage) a higher 
7:286:21806:13:14:72:427:276:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:amount of resources without increasing to any extent its relative power.

7:288:21881:14:14:72:526:248:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: Fiscal  decentralization  measured  as  a  ratio  of  locally  generated  revenues  to  the 
7:289:21973:14:14:72:526:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:general government revenue, for its part, helps to overcome the first problem of expenditure 
7:290:22066:14:13:72:526:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:measures  complementing  them  in  the  sense  that  it  takes  into  account  how  much  local 
7:291:22161:13:14:72:526:207:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:governments  finance  their  functions  independently.  However,  this  second  measure  of  fiscal 
7:292:22261:14:14:72:526:193:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:decentralization presents a problem which is to some extent symmetric to the second problem 
7:293:22353:14:14:72:526:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:presented  discussing  about  the  expenditure  side.  That  is  to  say,  (a)  it  could  overestimate 
7:294:22457:14:14:72:526:165:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:central government’s role if a large portion of revenue is collected centrally and transferred 
7:295:22550:14:13:72:526:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to  lower  level  governments.  In  this  case  central  government  does  act  as  collection  agent  of 
7:296:22656:13:14:72:234:138:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the lower level of government.

7:298:22690:14:14:72:526:110:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: An additional problem related to this measure that has not been explicitly considered 
7:299:22776:14:14:72:526:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:interpreting different measures of decentralisation based on tax revenue lies on the (potential) 
7:300:22873:14:0:72:525:82:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:difference  between formal assignment  of  resources  and  the real amount  that  a  local 
8:301:22963:0:14:72:525:759:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:B:government  could  manage  adopting  a  strategic  behaviour3 in  presence  of    “soft  budget 
8:302:23058:14:14:72:311:745:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:constraints” (Kornai, 1979; Kornai et al., 2003).

8:304:23107:14:14:72:526:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: In short, if local government acts under the expectation that its (eventual) fiscal deficit 
8:305:23199:14:13:72:526:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:will  be  covered  by  a  higher level  (often  the  central)  government,  then  the  total  amount  of 
8:306:23304:13:14:72:526:690:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:resources   formally   devolved   to   local   government   in   order   to   delivery   its   policies 
8:307:23408:14:14:72:525:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(independently  from  the  centre)  is  only  a  part  of  the  story because  the  real  amount  of 
8:308:23508:14:14:72:526:662:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:B:resources might be much higher. The issue is posed by Oates (2006) in terms of “raiding of 
8:309:23597:14:14:72:526:648:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:the fiscal commons” pointing out that, rather than being an hypothetic case, this could happen 
8:310:23692:14:13:72:526:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:even  in  presence  of  a  formal  statement  of  central  state  asserting  that  it  will  not  come  to  the 
8:311:23803:13:14:72:526:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:fiscal rescue of lower levels4. Hence,    the local/total    generated    revenue    ratio    clearly 
8:312:23904:14:14:72:391:607:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:underestimates the power of local government in rising resources. 
8:313:23969:14:14:72:75:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
8:314:23969:14:14:72:526:579:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: For  reasons  aforementioned  a  single  decentralization  ratio  is  not  able  to  capture  the 
8:315:24067:14:13:72:526:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:whole distribution of powers between different levels of government. Nonetheless, opportune 
8:316:24158:13:14:72:526:552:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:transformations  of  measures  proposed  above  have  been  proposed  in  order  to  better  capture 
8:317:24259:14:14:72:523:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:partial  aspects  overcoming  some  of  problems  presented  above. At  this  purpose Martinez-
8:318:24353:14:14:72:526:524:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Vazquez  and  Timofeev  (2009) develop  modified  decentralization  ratio  measures  in  order  to 
8:319:24451:14:14:72:526:510:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:capture three state’s activities separately: financing, administration, and, service delivery. 
8:320:24546:14:13:72:526:496:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Consequently,  the  authors  measure  responsibility  for financing public  services  as  total 
8:321:24641:13:14:72:526:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:expenditures  of  a  given  government net of  received  grants.  The  power  of  administration  is 
8:322:24741:14:14:72:526:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:measured  as  the  total  expenditures  of  a  given  government net of  grants  provided  to  other 
8:323:24841:14:14:72:526:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:governments.  Finally,  public  expenditure  of  a  government net of grants  and  contracts 
8:324:24933:14:14:72:526:441:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:awarded  to  private  contractors  can  be  view  as  a  measure  of  the  responsibility  for  service 
8:325:25037:14:13:72:117:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:delivery. 
8:326:25046:13:14:108:111:414:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: 
8:327:25046:14:14:108:526:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Regarding contracts with private sector, should be noted that even if they represents a 
8:328:25134:14:14:72:526:386:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:form of “delegation”, typically, subnational governments maintain their responsibility for the 
8:329:25229:14:14:72:526:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:final  service  delivery  outcomes  as  part  of  the  retained  power  of service  administration 
8:330:25327:14:13:72:526:358:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(Martinez-Vazquez  and  Timofeev,  2009). Regarding  other  measures,  although  (as  noted  by 
8:331:25422:13:14:72:526:345:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:B:the  authors)  these  measures  could be further refined given data availability, all “modified” 
8:332:25519:14:14:72:526:331:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:measure  will  share  the  same  underlying  idea  that  is  worth  stating  explicitly:  due  to  several 
8:333:25626:14:14:72:523:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:reasons  (fiscal  competition,  tax  exporting,  uneven  territorial  tax  base  distribution,  inter-
8:334:25728:14:14:72:526:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:jurisdictional externalities, redistributive objectives, imposition of minimal standard services 
8:335:25825:14:13:72:525:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:supply  like   essential  assistance  levels in  health,  satisfaction  of  special  interest  groups  or 
8:336:25929:13:14:72:526:276:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:leviathan concerns for the regional governments) transfers, both general and in-kind,  have a 
8:337:26022:14:14:72:333:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:crucial role in financing lower levels of government.   
8:338:26077:14:14:72:111:248:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:  
8:339:26077:14:14:108:526:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Hence, bargaining over transfer involving different levels of government is a sensitive 
8:340:26165:14:13:72:526:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:field  in  the  federal  fiscal  setting  which  outcome  could  have  strong  consequence  both  in 
8:341:26266:13:14:72:526:207:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:distributive  and  efficacy  terms.  The  issue  has  been  addressed  in  literature  both  assuming 
8:342:26368:14:14:72:526:193:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:benevolent government-Nash players and assuming that actors can strategically use transfers 
8:343:26460:14:14:72:525:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:for  re-election  or  even  for  subsiding  special  interest  groups (Boadway  and  Flatters, 1982;

8:350:27109:19:12:72:526:86:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:institutions,  the  structure  of  the  political system,  the  absence  (or  weakness) of  certain  key  markets,  and, the

9:352:27303:0:14:72:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:revenue and expenditure institutionally imputed to lower levels of government contributes to 
9:353:27396:14:14:72:526:745:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:take  into  accounts  a  network  of  financial  relations  (reflecting  a  setting  of  powers)  that 
9:354:27499:14:14:72:526:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:otherwise would be neglected or misinterpreted. A further criticism addressed to all measures 
9:355:27593:14:14:72:526:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:based on financial data – despite consisting in shares – consists in being unable, in general, to 
9:356:27688:14:13:72:433:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:distinguish among levels of subnational government (Marks et al., 2008)5.  
9:357:27760:13:14:108:111:690:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: 
9:358:27760:14:14:108:526:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:In conclusion it is forth stressing that fiscal federalism refers to the spatial distribution 
9:359:27854:14:14:72:526:662:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:B:of  power over  financial  activity  of  the  state. Along this dimension, all decentralisation’s 
9:360:27951:14:14:72:526:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:alternative  measures  share  the  methodological  aspect  of  being  ratios  between local and 
9:361:28046:14:13:72:526:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:national datum.  However,  none  of  several  measures proposed  by  different  studies is  able  to 
9:362:28144:13:14:72:526:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:capture all aspects of the fiscal impact of the state and each measure offers only a partial view 
9:363:28242:14:14:72:205:607:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of the whole set of powers.

9:367:28300:13:14:72:526:552:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Continuing to follow Schneider (2003, p. 33), administrative decentralisation “refers to how 
9:368:28391:14:14:72:526:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:much  autonomy  non-central government entities posses relative to central control”. More 
9:369:28481:14:14:72:526:524:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:precisely,   moving   from Rondinelli et   al. (1984),   autonomy   could   be   articulated   in 
9:370:28578:14:14:72:526:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:decisionmaking  authority,  personnel  control,  and,  control  over  public  finance. Treisman 
9:371:28673:14:13:72:526:496:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(2002) aiming  to develop a “global perspective on decentralisation” deals  with the  meaning 
9:372:28763:13:14:72:291:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and measurement of the three dimensions.   
9:373:28804:14:14:72:111:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:  
9:374:28804:14:14:108:526:455:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:A:To begin with, the author points out that decisionmaking decentralisation “focuses on 
9:375:28888:14:14:72:526:441:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:B:how the authority to make political decisions is distributed among different tiers” (Treisman 
9:376:28982:14:13:72:526:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:2002, p.  6). At  this  regard,  decentralisation  could  be  considered  among  two  dimensions:  (i) 
9:377:29083:13:14:72:523:414:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:how rights to decide on specific questions are distribuited among tiers, or (ii) how decision-
9:378:29177:14:14:72:269:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:making takes place on a given question.  
9:379:29216:14:14:108:111:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: 
9:380:29216:14:14:108:526:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Similarly,  according  to Marks  et  al. (2008)’s  general formalisation is  a  matter  of 
9:381:29307:14:13:72:525:358:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:territory in which governments exercise authority; the depth of that authority; and the spheres 
9:382:29402:13:14:72:525:345:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of  action  over  which  they  exercise  authority. Constitutions  are  the locus in  which  these 
9:383:29499:14:14:72:526:331:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:relationships  are  formally  defined.  Therefore,  the  issue  could  be  addressed  in  terms  of 
9:384:29599:14:14:72:525:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:constitutional concurrent (legislative) powers   and exclusive competencies.   Indeed,   in 
9:385:29690:14:14:72:525:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:decentralised  setting, central  level  of  government  has  the  primary  responsibility  but  lower 
9:386:29792:14:13:72:526:289:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:levels of it have the power to change central government’s low if they want. Furthermore, 
9:387:29882:13:14:72:526:276:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:decisionmaking decentralisation is also enhanced if subnational actors have – to some extent 
9:388:29973:14:14:72:525:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:- the right to shape central decisions like when an upper house of parliament that represents 
9:389:30066:14:14:72:332:248:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:subnational governments or electorates is constituted. 
9:390:30120:14:14:108:111:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: 
9:391:30120:14:13:108:525:220:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:A:Although  the  theoretical framework is fascinating clear, “the problems defining and 
9:392:30206:13:14:72:526:207:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:measuring decisionmaking decentralization are so daunting that, were decisionmaking not the 
9:393:30298:14:14:72:526:193:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:crucial  question  in  debates  over  decentralization,  it  would  be  tempting  to  abandon  the 
9:394:30397:14:14:72:526:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:concept” (Treisman, 2002, p. 8). In  order  to  take  into  account  both  legislative  power  and 
9:395:30492:14:14:72:526:165:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:subnational   representation   in   central   decisional   bodies, Treisman  (2002)’s approach 
9:396:30585:14:13:72:526:151:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:considers, in addition to “autonomy” (referring to situations in which subnationa tier has 
9:397:30676:13:14:72:526:138:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:B:exclusive  competency), “weak  autonomy”,  “residual  authority”,  and,  “subnational  veto” 
9:398:30768:14:14:72:129:124:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:categories.  
9:399:30780:14:24:108:111:110:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: 
9:400:30780:24:8:72:219:86:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:                                                 
9:401:30828:8:0:72:300:78:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:5 Regarding this issue readers are addressed to section 5. 
10:402:30886:0:14:108:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Weak  autonomy characterises  cases  in  which  constitution  reserves  exclusive  right  to 
10:403:30979:14:14:72:526:745:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:legislate  on  at  least  one  specific  policy  area  to  subnational  legislatures and/or subnational 
10:404:31082:14:14:72:525:731:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:legislatures have “residual authority”. Residual authority refers to cases in which constitution 
10:405:31177:14:14:72:526:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:gives  subnational  legislatures  exclusive  right  to  legislate  on  policy  areas  not  specifically 
10:406:31281:14:13:72:526:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:assigned in constitution. Subnational veto labels situations in which regionally-chosen upper 
10:407:31374:13:14:72:525:690:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:B:house of parliament has constitutional right to block legislation. Thus, “residual authority” is 
10:408:31471:14:14:72:526:676:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:a subset of “weak autonomy” and together account for legislative power at lower level of 
10:409:31560:14:14:72:526:662:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:B:government, while “subnational veto” is used to measure lower levels’ power at central (level 
10:410:31654:14:14:72:152:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of) government. 
10:411:31669:14:13:72:111:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:  
10:412:31669:13:14:108:526:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Regarding the second dimension of administrative decentralisation introduced above - 
10:413:31753:14:14:72:526:607:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:i.e. personnel  decentralisation – it  refers  to how  administrative  resources  are  distributed 
10:414:31850:14:14:72:526:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:across tiers of government in the sense that the greater the share of administrative personnel 
10:415:31945:14:14:72:526:579:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:employed at lower tiers, the greater is personnel decentralisation. As Treisman (2002, p. 13) 
10:416:32037:14:13:72:526:565:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:pointed  out  “the  distribution  of  manpower  can  become  as  politically  charged  as  the 
10:417:32132:13:14:72:526:552:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:distribution of decisionmaking authority”. This was the case, for example, in the debates over 
10:418:32227:14:14:72:526:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the draft US constitution with the antifederalists sustaining the argument  that a well-staffed 
10:419:32323:14:14:72:526:524:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:central  government  might  overawe  the  state  governments (Rossiter, 1961).  The  measure 
10:420:32415:14:14:72:526:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:proposed consists in the share of subnational governments in total government administration 
10:421:32508:14:13:72:129:496:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:employees. 
10:422:32518:13:14:108:111:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: 
10:423:32518:14:14:108:526:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:From   a   different   perspective   Schneider   (2003)   points   out   that   administrative 
10:424:32613:14:14:72:526:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:decentralisation  could  be  interpreted  as  a  matter  of control  over  resources.  Therefore, 
10:425:32711:14:14:72:526:441:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:coherently  with  this  perspective,  a  different  way  to  measure  levels  of  local  administrative 
10:426:32815:14:13:72:526:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:autonomy is proposed by the Author based on the control exercised over local revenue. More 
10:427:32905:13:14:72:526:414:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:precisely,  the  proposed  measure  consists  in  the  percentage  of  local  revenues  from  taxes.  In 
10:428:33010:14:14:72:526:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:order to properly understand this measure should be noted that taxes substantially differ from 
10:429:33105:14:14:72:526:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:resources.  Indeed,  if    resources  considered  as  a  whole  including  also  transfers,  grants,  and 
10:430:33211:14:14:72:526:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:loans  represent  an  indicator  of  wealth,  taxes,  being  characterised  by  the  higher  level  of 
10:431:33314:14:13:72:526:358:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:discretionary   power,   measure   the   autonomy   enjoyed   by   lower-level   governments   in 
10:432:33412:13:14:72:526:345:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:collecting  their own  resources  independently  from  conditions  and  limits  (often  applied  to 
10:433:33512:14:14:72:316:331:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:transfer and grants) posed by central government.  
10:434:33562:14:14:108:111:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: 
10:435:33562:14:14:108:526:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:However,  measure  other  than  taxes,  consistently  with  the  main  idea  of  measuring 
10:436:33653:14:13:72:526:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:administrative decentralisation as control over resources, could be used to compute a second 
10:437:33746:13:14:72:526:276:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:measure of subnational autonomy defined as the  percentage of total grants and revenues not 
10:438:33838:14:14:72:526:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:accounted  for  by  transfers.  Certainly,  excluding  the  whole  category  of  transfers  is  not  a 
10:439:33941:14:14:72:526:248:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:refined criterion as it does not distinguish between transfers assigning certain resources under 
10:440:34038:14:14:72:526:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the   total   control   of   the   lower   level   of   government   and   transfers   that   act   as   central 
10:441:34151:14:13:72:526:220:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:government’s instrument to  achieve  its  own objective (e.g.  earmarked  transfers  or  transfers 
10:442:34249:13:14:72:526:207:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:that  require  certain  behaviours  by  subnational  governments). Nevertheless,  this  second 
10:443:34343:14:14:72:526:193:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:measure  considering  taxes,  loans,  fees,  sales  of  assets,  and  informal  contributions  takes  into 
10:444:34450:14:14:72:526:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:account the degree to which subnational governments raise their own funds in a broader way 
10:445:34541:14:14:72:331:165:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:with respect to the previous one based only on taxes.  
10:446:34595:14:13:108:111:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: 
10:447:34595:13:14:108:526:138:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:To   summarise:   administrative   decentralisation,   considered   along   its   three   main 
10:448:34690:14:14:72:526:124:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:dimension  consisting of decision  making  and  control  both  over  personnel  and  financial 
10:449:34784:14:14:72:526:110:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:resources, has been measured in terms of constitutional setting (decision making power)  and, 
10:450:34878:14:14:72:526:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:as for fiscal decentralisation, in terms of ratio between local and national values of respective 
10:451:34976:14:0:72:526:82:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:variables. However,  measures  presented  above,  especially  those  based  on  resources,  once 
11:452:35074:0:14:72:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:more, offers only a partial picture of the phenomenon sharing with fiscal decentralisation the 
11:453:35168:14:14:72:526:745:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:weakness of not considering the political dimension of the process of state rescaling. Indeed, 
11:454:35263:14:14:72:526:731:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:democratic  representation  is  a  crucial  issue  at  this  regard  labelled  as  “political 
11:455:35357:14:14:72:326:717:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:decentralisation” which is the object of next section.

11:459:35438:14:14:72:525:662:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Similarly  to  the  case  of fiscal  decentralisation,  political  decentralisation  could  be  analysed 
11:460:35542:14:14:72:526:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:according to spatial distribution of (political) functions. In fact, all political systems perform 
11:461:35640:14:13:72:526:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:six  main  processes  (i.e.  mobilization,  organization,  articulation,  participation,  contestation, 
11:462:35744:13:14:72:525:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  aggregation  of  interests)  with  different  territorial  scope. According  to  this  perspective 
11:463:35847:14:14:72:526:607:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:decentralized  political  systems  are those  characterised  by  intensive  (and  at  least  partially 
11:464:35949:14:14:72:526:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:independent  from  those  at  the  national  level)  exercise  of  these  functions  at  the  local  level

11:467:36096:13:14:108:526:552:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Referring  to  this  issue Treisman (2002,  p. 11) talks  about electoral  decentralisation 
11:468:36185:14:14:72:526:538:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:“to mean the proportion of tiers at which direct elections are held to pick executives (or 
11:469:36276:14:14:72:526:524:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:legislators  who  then  choose  an executive form their number)”. Thus,    on  the  measurement 
11:470:36371:14:14:72:526:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:side, the degree of decentralisation is conducted to a single metric by measuring it in terms of 
11:471:36468:14:13:72:526:496:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:representation  intended  as  the  way  political  institutions  map  the  multiplicity  of  citizen 
11:472:36569:13:14:72:526:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:interests  onto  policy  decisions  (Litvack  et  al.,  2000);  the  proxy  utilised  consists  in  some 
11:473:36674:14:14:72:411:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:measure of the existence of elections at local level  (Schneider, 2003).

11:475:36744:14:14:72:526:441:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: At  this  regard  it  is  worth  stressing  that  the  existence  of  election  at  lower  level  of 
11:476:36845:14:13:72:526:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:government is not simply an issue of democracy, rather it looks at the manner in which local 
11:477:36938:13:14:72:526:414:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:political  actors  are  selected. The  underlying  idea  is  that  institutions  are  the  tool  by  which 
11:478:37044:14:14:72:526:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:public  interests  are  mobilised,  organised,  and  articulated  in  order  to  be  translated  in  policy 
11:479:37152:14:14:72:526:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(Berger,  1983).  Although  there  are  many  forms  in  which  this  process  of  translation  of 
11:480:37251:14:14:72:525:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:interests into policy takes palce (e.g. NGOs, social movement, interest organisation, political 
11:481:37347:14:13:72:526:358:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:parties, corporations, etc.), when elections occur at local level competitors are “forced” to 
11:482:37441:13:14:72:526:345:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:tailor their platforms to local concerns. Hence, in presence of elections at local level both the 
11:483:37538:14:14:72:507:331:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:political debate and subsequent policies are developed at local level as well.

11:485:37617:14:14:72:526:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: Certainly,  this  proxy  is  not  exhaustive  of  all  forms  of  political  decentralisation.  For 
11:486:37717:14:13:72:529:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:example, as mentioned above, participation could have different forms unrelated to elections.  
11:487:37810:13:14:72:526:276:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Moreover,  according  to  the  different  scale  involved  in  the  elective  process  decentralisation 
11:488:37914:14:14:72:526:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:could  achieve  different  degree  of  importance  and  such  a  measure  based  merely  on  a 
11:489:38009:14:14:72:526:248:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:dichotomised (existence or inexistence) approach is not able to capture this dimension effect6. 
11:490:38105:14:14:72:526:234:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:However, has been pointed out that “electoral components are the most valid indicator [...] as 
11:491:38200:14:13:72:526:220:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:they tap into fundamental aspect of political authority” (Schneider, 2003, p. 40). Therefore, 
11:492:38294:13:14:72:525:207:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:considering elections means considering the way in which local interests gain representation 
11:493:38387:14:14:72:217:193:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and, in turn, executive power.

11:500:38708:7:16:72:525:90:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:6 Even  considering  the proportion  of  tiers does  not  mean  taking  into  account  their  dimension  and  relative 
11:501:38825:16:0:72:213:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:importance to the national context. 
12:502:38862:0:14:72:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:belonging  to  administrative  decentralisation  (Rondinelli,  1990),  subsequently  (Cohen  and

12:504:39052:14:14:72:526:731:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:continuum  of  administrative  autonomy”  (Schneider,  2003,  p.  38) indicating different 
12:505:39141:14:14:72:525:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:configurations  of central-local  relationships  associated  with  a  hierarchical  distribution  of 
12:506:39241:14:13:72:525:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:authority.  Nevertheless,  this  paper,  without  challenging  the  current  mainstream  approach, 
12:507:39340:13:14:72:526:690:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:presents  them  separately  from  administrative  decentralisation  with  the  purpose  of  a  clearer

12:514:39665:14:14:72:526:593:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:different levels under the jurisdictional authority of the central government” pointing out that, 
12:515:39763:14:14:72:526:579:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:from the point of view of the hierarchical distribution of power, this type of decentralisation 
12:516:39859:14:13:72:526:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:is the least extensive one characterising late developing countries.  Similarly, Schneider 
12:517:39947:13:14:72:525:552:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:B:(2003,   p.38)   talks   about   a dispersion   of   responsibility that  “changes  the  spatial  and 
12:518:40048:14:14:72:526:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:geographical distribution of authority, but does not significantly change the autonomy of the 
12:519:40141:14:14:72:526:524:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:entity that receive the authority”.  Thus,  deconcentration  could  be  intended  just  as  an  act  of 
12:520:40245:14:14:72:526:510:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:exercise of central government’s authority along  its hierarchical channel, which is by no

12:530:40863:14:14:72:526:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in  the  case  of  deconcentration  (Central  Banks  are  typical  examples).  Indeed,  it  worth 
12:531:40961:14:13:72:526:358:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:stressing  that  in  case  of  delegation, receiving  institutions  are  not  under  the  direct  control  of

12:534:41127:14:14:72:526:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: Empirically,  the  delegation  process  often  involves  transfer  of  responsibility  to  state 
12:535:41224:14:14:72:526:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:owned  enterprises  and  urban  or  regional  development  corporations.  Moreover,  central  and 
12:536:41322:14:13:72:526:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:local  government  are delegating tasks, such  as refuse collection  and road  repair, by  contract 
12:537:41422:13:14:72:526:276:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to private firms. Usually this process is modelled in terms of politicians (principal) assigning 
12:538:41518:14:14:72:526:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:competencies  and  ceding  part  of  their  authority  in  certain  fields  to  bureaucrats  (agents)  for 
12:539:41625:14:14:72:526:248:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:several  reasons    such  as  technical  nature  of  the  issue,  time  constraint,  asymmetrical 
12:540:41723:14:14:72:525:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:information,  transaction  costs,  timeliness  necessities,    unwillingness  to  adopt  unpopular

12:543:41875:14:14:72:526:193:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: Hence,  this  circumstance  and  its  related  consequences  in  terms  of  effects  both  on 
12:544:41969:14:14:72:526:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:policy  and  outcome  have  been  systematically  addressed  by  the  body  of  literature  labelled 
12:545:42070:14:14:72:526:165:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:“bureaucracy  theory”.  From  a  normative  point  of  view, Weber (1972) argues  that  the 
12:546:42161:14:13:72:526:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:selection and appointment process allow politicians (principals) to exert an effective (even if) 
12:547:42258:13:14:72:526:138:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:B:indirect control over deputed actors, assuring, in turn, that agents’ objective coincide with the 
12:548:42356:14:14:72:526:124:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:principal’s ones. Nevertheless, on the positive ground, Weber (1972)’s argument have been 
12:549:42446:14:14:72:526:110:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:challenged  in  favour  of  the  existence  of  strategic  behaviour  between  the  two  parts. Indeed, 
12:550:42549:14:0:72:526:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:although argument  based  on  bureaucrat  perfect  self-determination  has been  questioned 
13:551:42642:0:14:72:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(Breton  and  Wintrobe  1975)7, there  are  authors  (often  adopting  a  neoclassical  approach) 
13:552:42739:14:14:72:526:745:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:arguing  that  under  delegation  public  officials  could  prosecute  their  own  objectives  that  not 
13:553:42844:14:14:72:526:731:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:B:necessarily match those of their principals. Niskanen (1975) assumes that budget’s size is the 
13:554:42938:14:14:72:526:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:real objective of the bureaucrat. Following this hypothesis he argued that due to asymmetrical 
13:555:43028:14:13:72:526:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:information in favour of the bureaucrat, this latter could obtain a budget that is oversized with 
13:556:43126:13:14:72:526:690:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:respect  to  the  optimal  one. Migué  and  Bélanger (1971) enlarge  the  view  allowing  the 
13:557:43219:14:14:72:526:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:bureaucrat  to  have,  in  general  terms,  additional  objective  with  respect  to  budget  size.  As  a 
13:558:43326:14:14:72:526:662:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:result, in their model, bureaucrats strategically using their “managerial discretion” achieve an 
13:559:43423:14:14:72:526:648:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:B:intermediate  outcome  (in  terms  of  budget  size)  between optimal  and  Niskanen  (1975)’s

13:583:44686:14:14:72:526:317:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:clearly pointing out that “devolutionary initiatives often assume legislative and administrative 
13:584:44783:14:14:72:526:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:characteristics   and   are   not   necessarily   fully   reflected   in   quantifiable   fiscal   resource 
13:585:44891:14:13:72:526:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:decentralization”  (Rodríguez-Pose  and  Gill,  2004,  p.  10),  use  the  share  of  subnational 
13:586:44989:13:14:72:526:276:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:government   in   total   national   public   expenditure   as   proxy   of   fiscal devolutionary 
13:587:45087:14:14:72:525:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:development. Nevertheless, Rodríguez-Pose and Ezcurra (2009) referring to 
13:588:45160:14:14:72:526:248:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:“decentralisation”  use  the  same  measure,  the  subnational  share  in  total  government 
13:589:45253:14:14:72:411:234:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:expenditure, clearly labelling it as a proxy of fiscal “decentralisation”. 
13:590:45327:14:13:72:75:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
13:591:45327:13:14:72:526:207:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: Indeed, sharply divide the two terms is rather trouble. Yet, a possible way to separate 
13:592:45415:14:14:72:526:193:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  two  terms  consists  in  approaching  the  issue  in  terms  of  degree  of  autonomy  related  to 
13:593:45520:14:14:72:526:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:each one. Thus, if decentralisation is a general term referring to the transfer of responsibility 
13:594:45618:14:14:72:526:165:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and power  with  no  precise  reference  to  the  degree  of  autonomy,  devolution  is  a  more 
13:595:45715:14:13:72:526:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:narrowed  term  belonging  to  the administrative type  of  it  and,  in  particular,  among  the  three 
13:596:45819:13:18:72:526:138:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:types  of  administrative  decentralisation  considered  in  this  section,  devolution  could  be 
13:597:45918:18:7:72:219:120:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:                                                 
13:598:45966:7:16:72:525:113:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:7 Bureaucrats  compete  each  other  to  obtain  funds,  while  politicians  are  accountable  to  citizen by  mean  of  the 
13:599:46090:16:7:72:521:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:electoral moment. This competition is able to provide a setting able to exert a control similar to the market one.  
13:600:46205:7:16:72:525:90:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:8 Formally,  the  bureaucrats  will  choose  that point  on  their  budget  line  where  the  marginal  rate  of  substitution 
13:601:46330:16:0:72:390:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:between formal output and other expenses equals the slope of their budget line. 
14:602:46410:0:14:72:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:distinguished  by  other  forms  because  is  characterised  by  the  highest  degree  of  autonomy 
14:603:46510:14:14:72:525:745:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:B:assigned  to  lower-level  receiving  unit(s). According  to  the  “devolution  setting”  central 
14:604:46607:14:14:72:526:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:government  has  a  only  a  limited  range  of  actions  in  order  to  limit  local government 
14:605:46704:14:14:72:526:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:autonomy. Essentially they are based on resources control (threat of withhold) and (change in 
14:606:46798:14:13:72:526:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  distribution  of)  responsibility. Regarding  its  measurement,  as  for  the  measurement  of 
14:607:46897:13:14:72:526:690:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:deconcentration  and  delegation,  in  literature,  to  the  best  of our  knowledge,  there  are  no 
14:608:46998:14:14:72:514:676:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:attempts to measure this forms of decentralisation separately from (fiscal) decentralisation.

14:617:47264:14:13:72:75:551:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
14:618:47264:13:14:72:525:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Federalism,  federal  political  system  and  federations are  terms  often  utilised  in  the  literature 
14:619:47370:14:14:72:526:524:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:on state rescaling especially in the form of fiscal federalism. In this regard it is worth noticing 
14:620:47469:14:14:72:526:510:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:B:that,  despite the evident fortune of the term “federalism” as formula in the political and 
14:621:47561:14:13:72:526:496:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:academic  discourse, similarly to “de-term” discussed above, there  is  a  conceptual  debate 
14:622:47655:13:14:72:247:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:about also concerning its definition. 
14:623:47690:14:14:72:75:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
14:624:47690:14:14:72:526:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: As  noted  by Sepos (2003) a  first  distinction  was  made  by  King (1982)  between  the 
14:625:47778:14:14:72:526:441:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:normative term “federalism” and its positive meaning “federation”. The former referring to 
14:626:47869:14:13:72:526:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  set  of  argument  in  favour  of  multi-tiered  government,  and  the  latter  referring  to  the 
14:627:47973:13:14:72:526:414:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:empirical   realisation   of   a   particular setting   of   multi-tiered   institutional   relationship. 
14:628:48077:14:14:72:526:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Therefore, federalism, as normative principle, represents the theoretical framework aiming at 
14:629:48170:14:14:72:526:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:combining unity and diversity by the perpetuation of both union and non-centralization at the 
14:630:48264:14:14:72:526:372:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:same time. “Federations” refer to a constitutional setting in which neither the federal nor the 
14:631:48360:14:13:72:526:358:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:constituent units of government - directly elected by its citizens - are subordinate to the other 
14:632:48456:13:14:72:526:345:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:in  the  exercise  of  legislative,  executive  and  taxing  powers.  This  circumstance  is  often 
14:633:48556:14:14:72:526:331:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:expressed  in  terms  of  sovereign  powers  derived  from  the  constitution  rather  than  another 
14:634:48657:14:14:72:247:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:level of government (Sepos, 2003).  
14:635:48691:14:14:72:75:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
14:636:48691:14:13:72:526:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: More  deeply,  federations  are  characterised  by:  i)  two  orders  of  government  each 
14:637:48782:13:14:72:525:276:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:acting  directly  on  their  citizens;  ii) a  formal  constitutional  distribution  of  legislative  and 
14:638:48887:14:14:72:526:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:executive  authority  and  allocation  of  revenue  resources  between  two  orders  of  government 
14:639:48987:14:14:72:526:248:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:ensuring  some  areas  of  genuine  autonomy  for  each  order;  iii)  provision  for  the  designated 
14:640:49090:14:14:72:525:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:representation of distinct regional views within the federal policy-making institutions, usually 
14:641:49187:14:13:72:526:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:provided by the a supreme, written constitution not unilaterally amendable and requiring the 
14:642:49280:13:14:72:526:207:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:consent  of  a  significant  proportion  of  the  constituent  units;  iv)  an  umpire  (in  the  form  of 
14:643:49387:14:14:72:526:193:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:courts  or  provision  for  referendums)  to  rule  on  disputes  between  governments;  v)  processes 
14:644:49490:14:14:72:526:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and   institutions   to   facilitate   intergovernmental   collaboration   for   those   areas   where 
14:645:49593:14:14:72:471:165:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:governmental responsibilities are shared or inevitably overlap (Watts, 1996).  
14:646:49669:14:13:72:75:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
14:647:49669:13:14:72:525:138:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: Furthermore,   Watts   (1996) proposed   a   tripartite   distinction:   federalism,   federal 
14:648:49763:14:14:72:526:124:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:political  systems,  and  federations.  According  to  this  approach  between  “federalism”  and 
14:649:49861:14:14:72:526:110:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:“federations”  (intended  as  above)  a  third  concept – federal  political  system - has  to  be 
14:650:49958:14:0:72:526:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:inserted in order to refer to a broad category (or genus) of political systems characterised by 
15:651:50056:0:14:72:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the existence of two (or more) levels of government which combine elements of shared rule9 
15:652:50146:14:14:72:526:745:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:through  common  institutions  and regional  self-rule for  the governments  of  the  constituent 
15:653:50244:14:14:72:101:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:units. 
15:654:50250:14:14:108:111:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: 
15:655:50250:14:13:72:526:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: However, for Elazar (1987, 1994) and  Burgess and  Gagnon  (1993),  both  federalism 
15:656:50331:13:14:72:526:690:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  federation  are  descriptive  terms.  According  to  them,  the  difference  lies  in  the  fact  that 
15:657:50439:14:14:72:526:676:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:while “federalism” refers to a genus of political organization, federations belong to its species 
15:658:50536:14:14:72:526:662:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:comprising    confederacies,    associated    statehoods,    unions,    leagues,    condominiums, 
15:659:50634:14:14:72:526:648:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:constitutional  regionalization,  and  constitutional  'home  rule'. Similarly,  Riker (1975,  p. 101) 
15:660:50736:14:13:72:526:634:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:asserted that “federalism is a political organization in which the activities of government are 
15:661:50832:13:14:72:526:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:divided between regional governments and a central government in such a way that each kind 
15:662:50923:14:14:72:405:607:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:of government has some activities on which it makes final decision”. 
15:663:50991:14:14:72:75:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
15:664:50991:14:14:72:526:579:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:B: It  is  worth  stressing that  in  so  doing,  “federalism”  is  deprived  of  any  normative 
15:665:51085:14:13:72:525:565:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:meaning  and,  as  a  result,  assumes  only  a  descriptive  nature. Therefore,  without  a  clear 
15:666:51184:13:14:72:526:552:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:specification, it is unclear if using the term “federalism” one is referring to its normative 
15:667:51278:14:14:72:491:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:meaning - based also on a certain scale of values - or to an empirical realisation of it.    
15:668:51368:14:14:72:75:524:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
15:669:51368:14:14:108:526:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:On  the  measurement  side,  as  noted  by Blume  and  Voigt  (2008),  the  most  often 
15:670:51456:14:13:72:526:496:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:utilised  measure  of  federalism  consist  in  a  dummy  variable  (Elazar,  1995;  Kearny,  1999; 
15:671:51556:13:14:72:526:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Watts 1999; Derbyshire and  Derbyshire,  1999)  assuming  value  “1”  for  federal  systems. 
15:672:51648:14:14:72:526:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Therefore, on the measurement side researchers follow a dichotomist approach that does not 
15:673:51739:14:14:72:526:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:allow  us  to  capture  different  shades  in  the  federalist  structures  of  different  states  involving 
15:674:51848:14:14:72:526:441:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:both their internal structure and the cross-country dimension. This last issue will be addressed 
15:675:51944:14:13:72:529:427:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:B:in  next  section  reviewing Marks  et  al. (2008)’s approach  based  on  “regional  authority”.  
15:676:52041:13:14:72:526:414:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:Indeed, the following approach focus on the “region” as the sub-national  unit  even  if  many 
15:677:52136:14:14:72:526:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:other  levels  of  analysis  (e.g.  city-regions  and  sub-regions)  have  been  used  in  literature, 
15:678:52239:14:14:72:526:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:attempting  to  highlight  the  internal  (regional)  structure  of  the  state  allowing  different 
15:679:52340:14:14:72:222:372:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:“degree” of regional authority.

15:683:52389:14:14:72:526:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:The  approaches  developed  above  based  either  on  financial  data  or  on  some  structural 
15:684:52485:14:14:72:526:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(considered)  fixed  characteristic  have  been  questioned  by Marks  et  al. (2008). In  particular, 
15:685:52586:14:13:72:525:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regarding widespread measures based on financial data it was argued that they are unable to 
15:686:52677:13:14:72:526:276:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:capture the real degree of autonomy enjoyed by lower level of government. Moreover, such a 
15:687:52768:14:14:72:526:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:measure  is  not  able  to  distinguish  between  lower  levels  of  government  treating  them  as  a 
15:688:52871:14:14:72:526:248:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:whole10. Regarding  other  measures based  on  institutional  characteristics,  an  important 
15:689:52964:14:14:72:526:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:disadvantage    pointed    out    by    the    Authors    consists    in    adopting    a    dichotomist

15:695:53254:12:16:72:525:159:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:10 This argument is valid though exception should be registered among innovative source of data. For example 
15:696:53362:16:12:72:525:143:10:g_d0_f8:10:Times New Roman:F:the Italian databank “Conti Pubblici Territoriali” (i.e. Regional  Public  Accounts)  provides  data  in  which  both 
15:697:53478:12:11:72:525:131:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:expenditure  and  revenue  of  lower  levels  of  government  are  divided  into  national.  regional,  local  public 
15:698:53596:11:12:72:525:120:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:administration (essentially municipalities), national public corporation, and local public corporations. Therefore, 
15:699:53712:12:11:72:525:108:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:such a system provides an important level of detail regarding the level of government involved in the financial 
15:700:53824:11:12:72:525:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:flows under consideration. However, to the  case at  hand should be  noted that  despite these data  are  consistent 
15:701:53941:12:11:72:525:85:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:with  the  COFOG  international  standard,  in  the  lack  of  similar  data  available  for  other  countries  their 
15:702:54059:11:0:72:508:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:significance will be of little moment due to the impossibility to use them for international comparison.           
16:703:54175:0:14:72:75:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
16:704:54175:14:14:72:526:745:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:these data are direct, but relatively crude, measures of the number of subnational levels, and 
16:705:54269:14:14:72:526:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:categorizations   of,   for   example,   federal   versus   non-federal   systems,   whether   or   not 
16:706:54373:14:14:72:526:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:subnational  governments  have  residual  powers,  whether  or  not  the  central  state  can  veto 
16:707:54473:14:13:72:525:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:subnational decisions, whether or not subnational executives are elected, and whether or not 
16:708:54566:13:14:72:484:690:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:subnational governments have revenue-raising authority” (Marks et al., 2008, p.112).

16:710:54647:14:14:72:526:662:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: The  criticism  developed  against  this  approach  is  based  on  the  argument  that,  in  so 
16:711:54743:14:14:72:526:648:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:doing, they “tap the extent to which the national state monopolizes authority, but they do not 
16:712:54838:14:13:72:526:634:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:tell  us  how  government  below  the  national  level  is  structured,  [...]  [because] they  conceive 
16:713:54942:13:14:72:526:621:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:government  within  countries  in  unidimensional  terms  as  the ‘other’, the ‘not central state’” 
16:714:55041:14:14:72:525:607:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(Marks et al., 2008, p. 112). Furthermore, it was argued that measures under consideration are 
16:715:55136:14:14:72:315:593:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:biased against temporal variation (Rodden, 2004).

16:719:55381:14:14:72:271:538:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:government” (Marks et al., 2008, p. 112)

16:721:55421:14:14:108:526:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:In  order  to  overcome  problems  developed  above  the  authors  propose  an  approach 
16:722:55510:14:13:72:526:496:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:based  on  “regional  authority”. Regional   authority   is   conceptualised   along   two   main 
16:723:55607:13:14:72:526:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:dimensions:  self  rule  and  shared  rule.  Self  rule  refers  to  the  independence  of  a  regional 
16:724:55711:14:14:72:525:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:government from central domination and the scope of regional decision making. Shared rule 
16:725:55801:14:14:72:526:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:refers  to  the  capacity  of  a  regional  government  to  shape  central  decision  making.  Each 
16:726:55901:14:14:72:489:441:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:dimension is then operationalised according to four distinct observable characteristics. 
16:727:55989:14:13:108:111:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: 
16:728:55989:13:14:108:525:414:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Self-rule  is  operationalised  as the  extent  to  which  a  regional  government  has  an 
16:729:56081:14:14:72:526:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:independent executive, the scope of its policy competencies, its capacity to tax, and the extent 
16:730:56178:14:14:72:525:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to which it has an independent legislature. Shared rule is operationalised by dividing central 
16:731:56272:14:14:72:525:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:government  decision  making  process  into  four  areas,  namely  normal  legislation,  executive 
16:732:56371:14:13:72:525:358:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:policy, taxation, and constitutional reform. Finally, for each observable a subset of empirical 
16:733:56466:13:14:72:376:345:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:situation are coded in order to assign a numeric value to them.

16:735:56530:14:14:108:525:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:To summarise: regional authority is thought as composed by self rule and shared rule. 
16:736:56616:14:14:72:526:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Both  self  rule  and  shared  rule  are  operationalised  according  to  four  dimensions  each.  These 
16:737:56721:14:13:72:526:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:dimensions, in turn, receive a numerical value according to a codification system. A complete

16:751:57303:14:14:72:525:96:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:authority, in order to measure it against observable variation among regions in a wide range 
16:752:57396:14:0:72:523:82:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of developed societies, at the same time as to encompass what is meant by regional authority. 
17:753:57491:0:14:72:526:759:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:In so doing, they propose a general measure of regional authority synthesising different kind

17:755:57677:14:14:72:526:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:Moreover, that measure has also a general validity in the sense that can be used as an ordinal 
17:756:57772:14:14:72:526:717:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:measure of regional authority; as an interval measure of regional authority; and as an absolute

17:760:57985:14:14:72:526:662:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:perspective,  it  does  not  take  into  account  how  globalisation  affect  the  (structure  of  the)

17:768:58477:13:14:72:526:552:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:In  addition  to  trends  involving  the  internal  distribution  of  power  and  competencies  which 
17:769:58578:14:14:72:526:538:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:have been treated above, states’ transformations involve also forces and actors external to 
17:770:58670:14:14:72:526:524:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:state apparatus intended in the traditional meaning.  At  this  regard  it  is  worth  stressing  that, 
17:771:58773:14:14:72:526:510:12:g_d0_f8:12:Times New Roman:B:especially  under  the  “glocalisation”11 (Robertson,  1992) process, forms  (i.e.  central-local

17:773:58965:13:14:72:518:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:influenced by actors at both national and sub-national level (Rodríguez-Pose and Gill, 2005)

17:775:59057:14:14:72:526:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: In  order  to  take  into  account  in  a  general  manner these  phenomena Jessop  (2002) 
17:776:59146:14:14:72:526:441:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:individuates three main trends: denationalisation,  destatisation, internationalization of policy 
17:777:59244:14:13:72:116:427:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:regimes. 
17:778:59252:13:14:72:75:414:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
17:779:59252:14:14:108:526:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Denationalisation  refers to the 'hollowing out' of the national state apparatus with old 
17:780:59342:14:14:72:525:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and  new  state  capacities  being  reorganized  territorially  and  functionally  on  subnational, 
17:781:59442:14:14:72:526:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:national,  supra-national,  and  trans-local  levels. Therefore,  in  addition  to  the  devolution  of 
17:782:59545:14:13:72:526:358:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:authority to subnational levels of government and to “the development of transnational but 
17:783:59636:13:14:72:526:345:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:inter-local policy making”, the concept  of  denationalisation  encompasses the  loss  of  formal 
17:784:59733:14:14:72:306:331:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:sovereignty in favour of supranational bodies12.

17:786:59781:14:14:72:526:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: Destatisation  “is  reflected  in  a  shift  from government to governance on  various 
17:787:59867:14:13:72:526:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:territorial  scales  and  across  various  functional domains”. Hence,  destatisation  consists  in  a 
17:788:59969:13:14:72:526:276:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:generalised erosion of the central role of the state as political institutionalised actor in favour 
17:789:60069:14:14:72:526:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to partnership between governmental, para-governmental and non-governmental actors. As a 
17:790:60158:14:14:72:464:248:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:result of this process the state is to become “first among equals” (Jessop, 2002).

17:792:60242:14:13:72:526:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: Internationalisation  refers  to  the  fact  that the  international  context  of  domestic  state 
17:793:60341:13:14:72:526:207:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:action  has  extended  to  include  a  widening  range  of  extra-territorial  or  transnational  factors 
17:794:60447:14:14:72:526:193:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:and processes; and it has also become more significant strategically for domestic policy.  The 
17:795:60540:14:14:72:526:179:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:key  word  here  is  “international  competition”.  The  term  refers  to  the  circumstance  that 
17:796:60639:14:14:72:526:165:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:pursuing  this  objective,  pushed  by  neoliberal  thinking,  foreign  agents  and  institutions  have 
17:797:60743:14:13:72:525:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:gained a role as source of policy ideas, policy design and implementation (Gourevitch, 1978;

17:800:60902:7:16:72:525:113:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:11 The term is used to refer to the phenomenon where globalization and localization forces act simultaneously in 
17:801:61014:16:7:72:235:97:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:determining state policies and outcome.  
17:802:61053:7:16:72:525:90:6:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:12 According to the author, on the empirical side this process is clear at the EU level , but also affects NAFTA 
17:803:61164:16:0:72:248:74:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:and other intergovernmental regional blocs.

18:805:61209:14:14:72:526:745:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: Thus,  the  three  terms  together  offer  a  general  view  of  the  phenomena  of  state 
18:806:61300:14:14:72:526:731:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:restructuring  considering  both  internal  (to its  structure  and  territory)  and  external  shifts  if

18:808:61500:14:13:72:526:703:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:(2009, p. 91) that measure destatisation intended as “diminishing role of the state vis-à-vis the

18:820:62067:13:14:72:75:538:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
18:821:62067:14:14:72:526:524:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:This  paper  presented  a  conceptual  analysis  of  terms  belonging  to  the  semantic  field  of  state 
18:822:62174:14:14:72:526:510:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:restructuring  according  to  a  synoptic  perspective  and  with  particular  attention  paid  to 
18:823:62273:14:13:72:381:496:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:concepts expressing forms, types and extent of decentralisation. 
18:824:62337:13:14:72:111:483:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:  
18:825:62337:14:14:72:526:469:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: The  analysis  aimed  at  reviewing  different  terms  focusing  the  attention  both  to  the 
18:826:62432:14:14:72:526:455:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:definitional  and  to  the  measurement  moment. In  particular,  it  moved  from  separately 
18:827:62525:14:14:72:526:441:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:C:considering  “types  of  decentralisation”  towards  a  generalised  approach  aiming  both  at 
18:828:62621:14:13:72:525:427:12:Times New Roman:12:g_d0_f8:B:conceptualising and operationalising   “regional authority” inside the internal structure of the 
18:829:62718:13:14:72:102:414:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:state.  
18:830:62725:14:14:72:75:400:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
18:831:62725:14:14:72:526:386:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: In so doing, it has been shown that despite the huge diversity involving meanings and 
18:832:62811:14:14:72:526:372:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:measures,  deriving  also  from  the  multidisciplinary  interest  in  this  field,  the  research  of  a 
18:833:62917:14:13:72:526:358:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:common analytical framework could be grounded on the conceptualisation and measurement 
18:834:63004:13:14:72:526:345:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:of  the  balance  of  power,  responsibilities,  and  competencies  between  central  state  and  other 
18:835:63108:14:14:72:317:331:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:bodies both at sub-national and international level. 
18:836:63160:14:14:72:111:317:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:  
18:837:63160:14:14:72:526:303:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: While  methodological  and  conceptual  differences  focus  on  direction  of  change, 
18:838:63247:14:13:72:526:289:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:degree,  type,  and  nature  of  attribution  involved. According  to  this  argument,  after  dealing 
18:839:63349:13:14:72:526:276:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:with the main issue of defining and measuring decentralisation, in the final part the discourse 
18:840:63445:14:14:72:526:262:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:is  further  generalised  in  order  to  take  into  account  also external actors  linking  the  analysis 
18:841:63551:14:14:72:330:248:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:with the analytical framework of globalisation.    
18:842:63599:14:14:72:75:234:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
18:843:63599:14:13:108:526:220:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The  analysis  confirms  the  persistence  of  a  strong  potential  for  confusion  generating 
18:844:63695:13:14:72:526:207:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:from  the  multitude of meaning attached to the term “decentralisation” and its related terms. 
18:845:63789:14:14:72:526:193:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:However,  having  assembled  (without  any  claim  of  completeness)  terms  together  contributes 
18:846:63888:14:14:72:526:179:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:to clarify and to interpret them more critically and in a more focused way.  Moreover, the 
18:847:63976:14:14:72:526:165:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:attention  paid  to  the  measurement  side  of  the  issue  contributes  also  critically  to  interpret 
18:848:64082:14:13:72:526:151:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:empirical  analyses  already  realised  in  literature  and,  in  perspective,  could  be  a  promising 
18:849:64186:13:14:72:316:138:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:starting point for more focused future research.
