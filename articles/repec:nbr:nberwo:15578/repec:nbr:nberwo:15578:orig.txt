2:33:1816:28:28:273:338:616:12:Times:12:Times:ABSTRACT
2:34:1824:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:Many states in Latin America, Africa and Asia lack the monopoly of violence, identified by Max Weber
2:35:1924:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:as the foundation of the state, and thus the capacity to govern effectively. In this paper we develop
2:36:2025:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:a new perspective on the establishment of the monopoly of violence and the formation of the state.
2:37:2123:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:We build a model to explain the incentive of central states to eliminate non-state armed actors (paramilitaries)
2:38:2235:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:in a democracy. The model is premised on the idea that paramilitaries may choose to and can influence
2:39:2336:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:elections. Since paramilitaries have preferences over policies, this reduces the incentives of the politicians
2:40:2446:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:they favor to eliminate them. The model also shows that while in non-paramilitary areas policies are
2:41:2546:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:targeted at citizens, in paramilitary controlled areas they are targeted at paramilitaries. We then investigate
2:42:2657:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:the predictions of our model using data from Colombia between 1991 and 2006. We first present regression
2:43:2761:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:and case study evidence supporting our postulate that paramilitary groups can have significant effects
2:44:2863:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:on elections for the legislature and the executive. Next, we show that the evidence is also broadly consistent
2:45:2973:14:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:with the implication of the model that paramilitaries tend to persist to the extent that they deliver votes
2:46:3080:14:14:72:540:420:12:Times:12:Times:to candidates for the executive whose preferences are close to theirs and that this effect is larger in
2:47:3183:14:14:72:540:406:12:Times:12:Times:areas where the Presidential candidate would have otherwise not done as well. These results illustrate
2:48:3285:14:14:72:540:392:12:Times:12:Times:that, consistent with our model, there appears to be a symbiotic relationship between some executives
2:49:3386:14:14:72:540:378:12:Times:12:Times:and paramilitaries. Finally, we use roll-call votes to illustrate a possible ‘quid pro quo’ between the
2:50:3489:14:42:72:273:364:12:Times:12:Times:executive and paramilitaries in Colombia.

3:69:3918:35:27:82:195:644:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:1  Introduction
3:70:3933:27:17:82:543:617:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Many scholars have argued that di-erences in state capacity are a key factor in comparative
3:71:4024:17:17:82:543:600:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:economic and political development (see for instance Evans, Rueschemeyer and Skocpol, 1985,
3:72:4115:17:17:82:543:583:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Evans, 1989, 1995, Kohli, 2004).  Although state capacity is multi-faceted, it inevitably relies
3:73:4211:17:17:82:543:566:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on Weber's famous notion of the state as \a human community that (successfully) claims the
3:74:4301:17:18:82:543:549:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f2:monopoly of the legitimate use of physical forcewithin a given territory" (1946, p. 78). States
3:75:4396:18:17:82:543:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:vary greatly in their capacities and whether or not they have such a monopoly of violence, and
3:76:4490:17:17:82:543:514:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:there is little evidence that this variation has decreased over the recent past. For example, in the
3:77:4590:17:17:82:543:497:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1990s the state in Somalia, Sierra Leone, Liberia, the Congo and Rwanda, completely collapsed
3:78:4683:17:17:82:543:480:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and gave up any pretence of undertaking the tasks that we associate with states. In Latin America,
3:79:4781:17:17:82:543:463:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Colombia, Peru, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua have all recently experienced or are now
3:80:4875:17:17:82:543:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:experiencing prolonged civil wars, with the writ of the state being absent from large parts of the
3:81:4973:17:17:82:543:429:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:country. In Pakistan the central state in Islamabad has little control of the `tribal areas' such as
3:82:5073:17:17:82:502:412:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Waziristan. Similarly, the Iraqi state in Baghdad exercises little authority in Kurdistan.
3:83:5163:17:17:99:543:395:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Why do some states fail to establish this monopoly? The social science literature emphasizes
3:84:5255:17:17:82:543:378:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:several key ideas, for instance, the inability of states to establish such monopoly because of
3:85:5349:17:17:82:543:361:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:`di-cult geography' (Herbst, 2000), `rough terrain' (Fearon and Laitin, 2003), or simply poverty
3:86:5445:17:17:82:543:344:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(Fearon and Laitin, 2003). It has also suggested that inter-state competition and warfare (Hintze,
3:87:5543:17:17:82:543:327:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1975, Tilly, 1975, 1990, Brewer, 1988, Herbst, 2000, Bates, 2001, Centeno, 2002) and domestic
3:88:5636:17:17:82:543:310:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:political competition in\ruence the incentives of politicians to build state capacity (Acemoglu,
3:89:5732:17:17:82:543:293:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Ticchi, Vindigni, 2006, Besley and Persson, 2007). Common to all of these explanations is a type
3:90:5828:17:17:82:543:276:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of `modernization' view, suggesting that as society modernizes and grows richer, state capacity
3:91:5923:17:17:82:543:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:will simultaneously develop.  In particular `state formation' involves eliminating armed actors
3:92:6018:17:17:82:543:242:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and establishing a monopoly of violence, in the same way that after the Wars of the Roses the
3:93:6111:17:17:82:399:225:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:victorious Tudors disarmed the English aristocracy (Storey, 1968).
3:94:6177:17:17:99:543:208:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Yet several of the examples above are quite puzzling from this point of view. In the case of
3:95:6269:17:17:82:543:191:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Pakistan, the tribal areas have existed since the formation of the country in 1947, and even though
3:96:6368:17:17:82:543:174:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:they have been largely out of the control of the central state, they have also been represented
3:97:6463:17:17:82:543:157:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:within it. Under the 1973 Constitution the tribal areas had 8 representatives in the National
3:98:6556:17:17:82:543:140:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Assembly elected by the tribal elders, or the Maliks. Under General Musharraf's regime this was
3:99:6651:17:17:82:543:123:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:increased to 12. In Iraq, while the peshmerga militia control the streets of Mosul, a coalition of
3:100:6749:17:17:82:543:106:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Kurdish political parties keeps the government in power in Baghdad. In Colombia, as we shall
3:101:6841:17:0:82:543:89:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:see, as much as one third of the legislature may have been elected in elections heavily in\ruenced
4:102:6940:0:17:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by armed paramilitary groups. After many of these were arrested by the Supreme Court, the
4:103:7029:17:17:82:481:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Colombian President did little to stop their alternates from voting in their absence.
4:104:7114:17:17:99:543:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:These examples point to a di-erent path of state formation than the one taken by England
4:105:7202:17:17:82:543:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:under the Tudors and subsequently enshrined in the social science literature. Instead, they sug-
4:106:7298:17:17:82:543:640:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:gest that state formation can take place without a monopoly of violence being established. In this
4:107:7396:17:17:82:543:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:paper we develop a new perspective on state formation, emphasizing the idea that aspects of state
4:108:7493:17:17:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:weakness, particularly the lack of monopoly of violence in peripheral areas, can be an equilibrium
4:109:7591:17:17:82:543:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:outcome. Moreover, in contrast to the implicit notion common in the previous literature, `mod-
4:110:7685:17:17:82:543:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ernization' need not automatically eradicate non-state armed actors. Although we believe that
4:111:7778:17:17:82:543:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the ideas proposed in this paper have relevance both in democratic or non-democratic contexts,
4:112:7872:17:17:82:543:538:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we develop a model formalizing these notions in the context of a democratic country. We then
4:113:7964:17:17:82:439:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:investigate several of implications of this model using data from Colombia.
4:114:8039:17:17:99:543:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our model begins from the observation that in a democracy non-state armed actors (in our
4:115:8127:17:17:82:543:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:context, paramilitaries) can control citizens' voting behavior. Since paramilitaries naturally have
4:116:8226:17:17:82:543:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:preferences over policies, when they choose to become involved in politics, this reduces the incen-
4:117:8325:17:17:82:543:453:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tives of the politicians they favor to eliminate them. The model predicts that in non-paramilitary
4:118:8423:17:17:82:543:436:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:areas policies are targeted at citizens while in paramilitary areas they cater to the preferences of
4:119:8523:17:17:82:543:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:paramilitaries. This implies that in paramilitary areas citizens obtain fewer public goods (and
4:120:8618:17:17:82:543:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:other policies they value). The model further implies that paramilitaries will tend to persist to
4:121:8715:17:17:82:543:385:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the extent that they deliver votes to politicians they prefer|in the Colombian case, to Presi-
4:122:8809:17:17:82:543:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:dent-Alvaro Uribe|and that this e-ect is stronger in areas where these politicians would have
4:123:8902:17:17:82:543:351:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:otherwise not done as well.  Thus non-state armed actors can persist because they can be in
4:124:8993:17:18:82:543:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a symbiotic relationship with speci\fc politicians holding power: paramilitaries deliver votes to
4:125:9090:18:17:82:543:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:politicians with preferences relatively close to theirs, while politicians they helped elect implicitly
4:126:9193:17:17:82:346:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:or explicitly support laws and policies that they prefer.
4:127:9250:17:17:99:543:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We empirically investigate the implications of our model using the recent Colombian experi-
4:128:9341:17:17:82:543:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ence, where two main non-state armed actors, the `left-wing' guerrillas Fuerzas Armadas Revolu-
4:129:9436:17:17:82:543:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:cionarias de Colombia (FARC|The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) and `right-wing'
4:130:9524:17:17:82:543:231:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:paramilitary forces, which in 1997 coalesced into the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC|
4:131:9615:17:17:82:543:214:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:United Self-Defense Organization of Colombia), have shaped the recent political landscape. We
4:132:9708:17:17:82:543:197:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:\frst provide evidence that paramilitaries, though interestingly not the FARC, have systematically
4:133:9806:17:17:82:543:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in\ruenced electoral outcomes. In particular, after the AUC got involved in politics in 2001, the
4:134:9903:17:17:82:543:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:presence of paramilitaries in a municipality is correlated with the rise of non-traditional `third
4:135:10001:17:17:82:543:146:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:parties' (that is, parties other than the Liberals, the Conservatives, and the Socialists), which are
4:136:10102:17:17:82:543:129:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:widely recognized to be often directly or indirectly associated with the paramilitaries (e.g., L-opez,
4:137:10204:17:17:82:543:112:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2007, Valencia, 2007). We also \fnd that paramilitary presence is also associated with a greater
4:138:10300:17:0:82:543:95:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:concentration of votes within a municipality in legislative elections and with greater support for
5:139:10399:0:17:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:President-Alvaro Uribe, who has enacted several key policies in line with the preferences of the
5:140:10495:17:17:82:288:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:paramilitaries, in the presidential elections.
5:141:10541:17:17:99:543:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The e-ect of paramilitaries on the elections is further substantiated by the fact that when a
5:142:10634:17:17:82:543:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:senator's list receives a greater proportion of its votes in areas with high paramilitary presence,
5:143:10733:17:17:82:543:640:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the senator is more likely to be subsequently arrested for illegal connections with paramilitaries
5:144:10831:17:17:82:543:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and to support the two clauses of the Justice and Peace Law that were highly lenient towards
5:145:10923:17:17:82:544:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the paramilitaries.1Table 1 depicts some of the relevant information. On it we placed the 20
5:146:11015:17:17:82:542:589:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f5:senators whose list got the greatest share of their votes in areas with high paramilitary presence.2
5:147:11115:17:17:82:543:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Column 1 shows that 45% of these senators belong to `third political parties'. Column 4 shows
5:148:11208:17:17:82:543:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that the two senators with the highest vote shares have been arrested and found guilty of links
5:149:11303:17:17:82:543:538:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with paramilitary groups. As of May 2009 another 4 senators are under arrest, while a further
5:150:11396:17:17:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:3 are under investigation, all for links with paramilitaries. Column 3 shows that the majority of
5:151:11493:17:17:82:479:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:those in o-ce at the time also supported the clauses of the Justice and Peace Law.
5:152:11575:17:17:99:543:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The evidence mentioned so far is consistent with the assumptions of our model, that paramil-
5:153:11667:17:17:82:543:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:itaries were actively involved in in\ruencing elections. The main prediction of our model is that
5:154:11764:17:17:82:543:453:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:paramilitaries should persist more where they deliver votes to the executive that they prefer,
5:155:11858:17:17:82:543:436:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:particularly in areas where this politician would otherwise not do well. This is because elimi-
5:156:11953:17:17:82:543:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:nating paramilitaries would implicitly cost valuable votes in the election. We also show that the
5:157:12050:17:17:82:403:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:correlations in the data are broadly consistent with this prediction.
5:158:12119:17:17:99:543:385:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Finally, we examine the roll-call votes in the Senate on the legislation for changing the Con-
5:159:12213:17:17:82:543:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:stitution to remove the one-term limit and allow presidential re-election to illustrate a possible
5:160:12311:17:17:82:543:351:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:channel for the `quid pro quo' between legislators elected from high paramilitary areas and the
5:161:12406:17:18:82:543:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:executive. We \fnd evidence that the greater was the proportion of votes a senator's list obtained
5:162:12504:18:17:82:543:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in high paramilitary areas, the greater was the likelihood of the senator to vote in favor of remov-
5:163:12604:17:17:82:543:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ing the term limit. Column 2 of Table 1 shows that of those who voted all but three of our `top
5:164:12699:17:17:82:281:282:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f5:20' senators voted in favor of re-election.3
5:165:12743:17:17:99:543:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our econometric analysis proceeds under the assumption that our measures of the presence of
5:166:12834:17:17:82:543:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:paramilitaries and guerillas are exogenous. We are therefore cautious about giving causal inter-
5:167:12930:17:15:82:543:231:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:pretations to the conditional correlations we uncover. For example, it may be that paramilitaries
5:168:13027:15:15:95:543:216:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:1These clauses, supported by President Uribe, reduced the penalties that could be applied to former combatants
5:169:13137:15:11:82:543:201:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:and removed the possibility of extraditing them (to the United States). They were deemed to be `pro-paramilitary'
5:170:13250:11:7:82:543:190:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:by international legal analysts and human rights NGOs, such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International.
5:171:13358:7:15:95:543:183:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:2Table 1 uses our main measures of paramilitary presence using data on attacks and con\rict incidents. Appendix
5:172:13469:15:7:82:509:168:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:Table A1 reproduces Table 1 using a di-erent measure of paramilitary presence, with very similar results.
5:173:13574:7:15:95:543:161:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:3There is no direct evidence that President Uribe is in some formal `coalition' with paramilitaries, and we do not
5:174:13688:15:11:82:543:146:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:argue or believe that he is; in fact, the politicians in our theoretical model are not in such a coalition either. What
5:175:13807:11:11:82:543:135:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:matters is that President Uribe's relatively conservative policies are closer to those preferred by the paramilitaries,
5:176:13926:11:11:82:543:124:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:who have strong conservative leanings and thus naturally have an interest in maintaining him in power. Some of
5:177:14036:11:11:82:543:113:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:our theoretical and empirical results then exploit the fact that he may take this into account in several of his key
5:178:14152:11:0:82:120:102:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:decisions.
6:179:14163:0:17:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:select into areas where people's preferences are `conservative' and would naturally support the new
6:180:14262:17:17:82:543:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:`third parties' or President Uribe, thus creating a positive association between these variables and
6:181:14362:17:17:82:543:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:paramilitary presence. Nevertheless, most of our \fndings come from panel data models with \fxed
6:182:14458:17:17:82:543:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:e-ects, so that if there are time-invariant di-erences in political preferences across municipalities,
6:183:14560:17:17:82:543:640:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:these will not in\ruence our results.  In addition, we use direct controls for how `conservative'
6:184:14657:17:17:82:543:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:di-erent municipalities are, and as already mentioned above, in the regressions on the persistence
6:185:14755:17:17:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the paramilitaries over time, we see paramilitaries persist precisely in places which, in the ab-
6:186:14855:17:17:82:543:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sence of paramilitary coercion, were relatively unlikely to have voted for President Uribe. Finally,
6:187:14955:17:17:82:543:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the fact that paramilitary presence predicts the arrests of senators suggests that politicians are
6:188:15053:17:17:82:543:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:not simply the perfect agents of underlying voter preferences, but are in fact implicated with the
6:189:15151:17:17:82:396:538:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:non-state armed actors, as the case study literature also suggests.
6:190:15218:17:17:99:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our empirical evidence comes from a speci\fc country, Colombia; we must thus exercise caution
6:191:15311:17:17:82:543:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in making claims about external validity.4Nonetheless, we believe the political mechanisms
6:192:15401:17:17:82:543:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:emphasized in this paper are useful in building a richer political explanation for why many modern
6:193:15499:17:17:82:544:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(and in fact democratic) states do not establish a monopoly of violence in their territory.5At the
6:194:15597:17:17:82:543:453:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:very least, the theoretical ideas and the empirical evidence presented here show that the implicit
6:195:15695:17:17:82:543:436:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:notion that `modernization' in less-developed economies will naturally lead to the formation of
6:196:15790:17:17:82:543:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a Weberian state, mimicking the European experience, needs to be revised, re\fned or perhaps
6:197:15882:17:17:82:543:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:even abandoned. Colombia has experienced over a century of sustained increases in GDP per-
6:198:15972:17:17:82:543:385:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:capita, large increases in educational attainment, rapid urbanization, indeed all of the features of
6:199:16072:17:17:82:543:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:modernization (Robinson and Urrutia ed., 2007). Yet the state has not established a monopoly
6:200:16164:17:17:82:135:351:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of violence.
6:201:16176:17:18:99:543:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In addition to the literature cited above, the arguments in this paper are related to the recent
6:202:16272:18:17:82:543:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:political economy literature on the determinants of state capacity. For example, Acemoglu (2005)
6:203:16368:17:17:82:543:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:conceptualizes state capacity as the ability to tax citizens, and examines the consequences of
6:204:16462:17:17:82:543:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:state capacity for economic growth and welfare. Acemoglu, Ticchi and Vindigni (2006) model the
6:205:16556:17:17:82:543:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:endogenous creation of capacity by an elite facing democratization. They argue that the elite may
6:206:16653:17:15:82:543:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:have an incentive to choose ine-cient state institutions to limit the amount of redistribution they
6:207:16752:15:15:95:543:233:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:4It can also be argued that the political equilibrium of the last decade in Colombia will ultimately pave the way
6:208:16865:15:11:82:543:218:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:to a modern Weberian state. Whether this is the case or not has no direct bearing on our analysis. Nevertheless,
6:209:16977:11:11:82:543:207:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:we suspect that the symbiotic relationship between the executive and non-state armed groups is not a transient
6:210:17087:11:11:82:543:196:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:phenomenon. Chaves, Fergusson and Robinson (2009) show that the outcome of the 1922 Presidential election
6:211:17192:11:11:82:543:185:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:was determined by fraud and violence with regional patterns strikingly similar to those seen in 2002 or 2006. In
6:212:17304:11:11:82:543:174:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:this light, the mechanisms we isolate here may be the most recent incarnation of a process whose roots lie deep
6:213:17415:11:11:82:543:163:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:in Colombian history. In this interpretation, it may have been the prior absence of state presence and authority
6:214:17527:11:11:82:543:152:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:that led to the formation of the AUC in the \frst place, but in doing so it may have reproduced the same historical
6:215:17642:11:7:82:162:141:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:pattern of behavior.
6:216:17662:7:15:95:543:134:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:5Naturally, it is possible that the mechanism that we identify here may be less important in non-democratic
6:217:17769:15:11:82:543:119:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:regimes, though even dictators require support. Recall, for example, that as noted above it was General Musharraf,
6:218:17883:11:11:82:543:108:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:not any of the democratic Pakistani governments, who increased the number of representatives of the tribal areas
6:219:17995:11:0:82:186:97:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:in the National Assembly.
7:220:18021:0:17:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:will face under democracy. In a related paper, Besley and Persson (2009) develop a model where
7:221:18115:17:17:82:543:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:politicians have to decide whether to build \fscal capacity. None of these papers are concerned
7:222:18210:17:17:82:491:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with the issue of establishing a monopoly of violence, which is the focus of our paper.
7:223:18297:17:17:99:543:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Within political science our work relates to the literature on `subnational authoritarianism'
7:224:18390:17:17:82:543:640:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:which has emphasized how democratization at the national level can coexist with highly author-
7:225:18484:17:17:82:543:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:itarian local practices (O'Donnell, 1993, Gibson, 2005, Mickey, 2009). This research has given
7:226:18578:17:17:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:examples of some of the mechanisms contained in our model, but has not developed these ideas
7:227:18670:17:17:82:543:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:formally, has not noticed the key predictions that our model develops, or provided an econometric
7:228:18767:17:17:82:213:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:investigation of these ideas.
7:229:18796:17:17:99:543:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The literature on civil war addresses some of the issues we emphasize here implicitly, for
7:230:18886:17:17:82:543:538:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:example, in its stress on the weakness of the state (e.g., Fearon and Laitin, 2003). Nevertheless,
7:231:18984:17:17:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:most of the research on civil war focuses on the motivations which lie behind the decisions of
7:232:19078:17:17:82:543:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:people to take up arms against their governments (see, e.g., the excellent survey by Blattman,
7:233:19172:17:17:82:543:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and Miguel, 2008). In this work the fact that a state does not have a monopoly of violence arises
7:234:19269:17:17:82:543:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:because given the expected bene\ft of allocating resources to \fghting rebels or insurgents, it is not
7:235:19371:17:17:82:291:453:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f5:worth paying the cost of eliminating them.6
7:236:19414:17:17:99:543:436:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our work owes a great debt to the journalists, scholars and public o-cials who have played key
7:237:19508:17:17:82:543:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:roles in bringing to light the involvement of paramilitaries and the AUC in politics in Colombia.
7:238:19605:17:17:82:543:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Particularly important has been the work of the researchers whose essays appear in Romero
7:239:19694:17:17:82:543:385:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(2007). S-anchez and Palau (2006) also show that political competition is negatively correlated
7:240:19789:17:17:82:320:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with murders of politicians in municipal elections.
7:241:19840:17:17:99:543:351:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section we develop a theoretical model to examine
7:242:19932:17:18:82:543:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the incentives of politicians controlling the central state to eliminate or live with non-state armed
7:243:20033:18:17:82:543:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:actors depending on whether they receive electoral support from these groups. Section 3 provides
7:244:20129:17:17:82:543:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a brief overview of the history and nature of non-state armed actors in Colombia.  Section 4
7:245:20221:17:17:82:543:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:describes the data we use and provides some basic descriptive statistics.  Section 5 provides
7:246:20314:17:17:82:543:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:regression evidence consistent with the e-ects of paramilitaries on electoral outcomes. Section 6
7:247:20411:17:17:82:543:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:examines the key prediction of our theoretical model, that paramilitaries should persist more in
7:248:20507:17:17:82:543:231:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:areas where they deliver votes to the executive and where they would not have otherwise done
7:249:20599:17:17:82:543:214:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:as well. Section 7 provides some suggestive evidence on another implication of our model, the
7:250:20692:17:16:82:508:197:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:symbiotic relationship between the executive and the paramilitaries. Section 8 concludes.
7:251:20781:16:14:95:543:181:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:6There is also a large literature about the origins of con\rict in Colombia (see Bergquist, Pe~naranda, S-anchez
7:252:20893:14:11:82:543:167:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:eds. 1992, 2001, Deas, 1999, and Posada Carb-o, 2003). In\ruenced by the wider academic literature on civil wars,
7:253:21006:11:11:82:543:156:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:this work has emphasized the importance of state weakness in the Colombian context as well (e.g., Waldmann,
7:254:21113:11:11:82:543:145:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:2007). We do not deny that this is important, for example with respect to the persistence of the FARC. Instead,
7:255:21224:11:11:82:543:134:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:we emphasize that state weakness in Colombia is not simply about inability to eliminate non-state armed actors;
7:256:21335:11:0:82:268:123:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:it is also about the lack of incentives to do so.

8:258:21393:28:17:82:543:680:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In this section, we present a simple model to formalize the possible channels of interaction be-
8:259:21489:17:17:82:543:663:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tween central government and paramilitaries.7Motivated by the Colombian experience, our focus
8:260:21582:17:17:82:543:646:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:will be on democratic politics, where an incumbent is facing reelection and decides whether to
8:261:21676:17:17:82:543:629:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reconquer some of the areas under paramilitary control. The model will highlight how paramili-

8:263:21867:17:17:82:543:595:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:one candidate over another. It will then show how the e-ect of paramilitaries on electoral out-

8:266:22148:17:17:82:543:544:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:state with a monopoly of violence over the entire country. Finally, we also investigate how the
8:267:22243:17:17:82:543:527:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:presence of paramilitaries a-ects the policy choices of the party in power.  Our purpose is to
8:268:22337:17:17:82:543:510:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:communicate the main ideas in the simplest possible way. Our empirical work will then provide
8:269:22430:17:17:82:543:493:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:evidence showing how paramilitaries in\ruence electoral outcomes and how this e-ect on elections
8:270:22526:17:17:82:384:476:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:interacts with the persistence of paramilitaries in certain areas.
8:271:22592:17:17:99:543:459:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We consider a two-period model of political competition between two parties.  PartyAis

8:273:22772:17:17:82:543:425:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:consists of a large equal-sized number,N, of regions, with each region inhabited by a large number
8:274:22870:17:17:82:543:408:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of individuals. We denote the collection of these regions byN. The party that wins the majority

8:276:23063:17:17:82:543:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ideological preferences and, in addition, some regions are under paramilitary control. We assume
8:277:23159:17:17:82:543:357:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:as in standard Downsian models that parties can make commitments to their policies, but their
8:278:23252:17:17:82:543:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ideological stance is \fxed (and may capture dimensions of policies to which they cannot make
8:279:23345:17:30:82:153:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:commitments).
8:280:23358:30:24:82:380:293:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2.1  Electoral Competition without Paramilitaries
8:281:23407:24:17:82:543:269:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We \frst introduce the details of electoral competition at datet= 1 and then return to the

8:283:23586:17:17:82:543:235:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:expend the resources to reconquer some of the territories under paramilitary control. To start
8:284:23680:17:17:82:543:218:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with, let us ignore the regions that are under paramilitary control (these will be introduced below).

8:286:23861:16:15:95:543:185:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:7In the empirical work we examine the impact of both the paramilitaries and the FARC on elections. However,
8:287:23968:15:11:82:543:170:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:since we do not \fnd robust e-ects of the FARC and since case study evidence suggests that the FARC was much
8:288:24076:11:11:82:543:159:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:less involved in electoral politics, in the theoretical model we focus on the relationship between politicians and the
8:289:24194:11:7:82:309:148:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:paramilitaries. We return to this issue in subsection 2.5.
8:290:24252:7:15:95:543:141:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:8This implies that we are looking at a \presidential system," though the empirical evidence below comes mostly
8:291:24362:15:11:82:543:126:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:from votes for senators and congressmen. Focusing on the presidential system simpli\fes the argument without any

10:440:27420:17:29:82:426:432:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:following proposition, characterizing the equilibrium (proof in the text).
10:441:27494:29:17:82:543:403:11:g_d0_f15:11:g_d0_f4:Proposition 1Without paramilitaries, there exists a unique electoral equilibrium (att= 1)
10:442:27583:17:17:82:543:386:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:whereqA=qB=q-, andq-, if interior, satis\fes (3). PartyAwins the election with probability
10:443:27673:17:29:82:143:369:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:given by (4).
10:444:27686:29:17:99:543:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Two important points to note are as follows. First, without paramilitary presence, national
10:445:27777:17:17:82:543:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:policies are chosen to cater to the preferences of all voters in all regions. This feature is fairly
10:446:27877:17:17:82:543:306:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:general, though as is well known the fact that both parties choose the same policy vector (policy
10:447:27974:17:17:82:543:289:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:convergence) is special and relies on the fact that the two parties do not themselves have prefer-
10:448:28072:17:17:82:543:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ences over policies. Whether they do or not is not important for the results here, and we therefore
10:449:28171:17:17:82:543:255:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:opted for the simpler speci\fcation. Second, average ideological bias across all regions determines
10:450:28270:17:17:82:544:238:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the probability of reelection for partyA(which is currently in power). We will next see how this
10:451:28366:17:29:82:464:221:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:result changes under various di-erent assumptions about paramilitary behavior.
10:452:28444:29:24:82:461:192:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2.2  Elections under Paramilitaries with Exogenous Preferences
10:453:28506:24:17:82:543:168:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Next, let us suppose that a subset of the regions, denoted byZ-Nare under paramilitary
10:454:28592:17:17:82:543:151:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:control.  Denote the total number of these regions byZand their fraction (their ratio to the
10:455:28684:17:17:82:543:134:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:number of total regions) byz. The key feature of paramilitary-controlled areas for our purposes
10:456:28779:17:17:82:543:117:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is that, as we will document in detail below, voting is not free but in\ruenced by the implicit or
10:457:28877:17:0:82:543:100:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:explicit pressure of the paramilitaries. Throughout the rest of this section we impose this feature.
11:458:28978:0:17:99:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We start with paramilitaries with \exogenous preferences," meaning that how the paramili-
11:459:29067:17:17:82:543:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:taries in\ruence the voting behavior of the citizens in the regions they control is exogenous. This
11:460:29166:17:17:82:543:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:will contrast with the case in which the support of the paramilitaries is endogenous to the policy
11:461:29264:17:17:82:543:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:choices, studied in the next subsection. In particular, we take the behavior of the paramilitaries
11:462:29362:17:17:82:543:640:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(and the voting behavior of the citizens in paramilitary-controlled areas) as given.  In partic-
11:463:29458:17:17:82:543:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ular, suppose that in each paramilitary-controlled regionj2Z, a fraction ~mjof the voters
11:464:29547:17:17:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:will vote for partyAregardless of policies (so the voting behavior of these individuals in these
11:465:29643:17:17:82:543:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:paramilitary-controlled regions isinsensitiveto policies). Let us denote the complement of the
11:466:29737:17:17:82:543:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:setZbyJ=NnZand the total number of regions in this (non-paramilitary-controlled) set by
11:467:29824:17:17:82:543:555:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:J=N-Z. Let us also de\fnemj-~mj-1=2. Then with an identical reasoning to that in the
11:468:29908:17:30:82:494:538:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:previous subsection, the probability that partyAwill win the election at timet= 1 is

11:512:30608:29:17:99:543:301:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Two features that are noteworthy relative to Proposition 1 are as follows. First, policies no
11:513:30701:17:17:82:543:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:longer cater to the preferences of all regions. Since citizens in paramilitary-controlled areas cannot
11:514:30803:17:17:82:543:267:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reward or punish a government according to the policy proposals that it makes, both parties only
11:515:30899:17:17:82:543:250:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:target their policies to the voters in the non-paramilitary-controlled areas.  This implies that,
11:516:30996:17:17:82:543:233:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:endogenously, public goods and other amenities will be reduced in the paramilitary-controlled
11:517:31089:17:17:82:543:216:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:areas beyond the direct e-ect of paramilitary presence.9Thus, all else equal, we may expect
11:518:31180:17:17:82:543:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:paramilitary presence to increase inequality across regions. Second, electoral outcomes will now
11:519:31276:17:17:82:543:182:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:be dependent on the in\ruence of the paramilitaries on voting behavior, which is captured by the
11:520:31372:17:17:82:543:165:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:last term inPA(q-; q-j-;m). If paramilitaries prefer partyA, meaning thatE[mjjj2Z]>0,
11:521:31457:17:17:82:543:148:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:then the probability that partyAwill win the election (and stay in power) is greater, other things
11:522:31555:17:16:82:543:131:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:equal. The more areas are controlled by the paramilitaries, the stronger is this e-ect. In the
11:523:31649:16:15:95:543:115:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:9The direct e-ect may, for example, stem from the fact that such investments and public good delivery become
11:524:31757:15:0:82:543:100:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:more expensive, or paramilitaries directly damage infrastructure, law and order and the availability of public goods.
12:525:31875:0:17:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:empirical work below, we will provide indirect evidence consistent with Proposition 2 by showing
12:526:31971:17:17:82:334:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the in\ruence of paramilitaries on electoral outcomes.
12:527:32025:17:17:99:543:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This last feature already highlights how paramilitaries can have a major in\ruence on demo-
12:528:32116:17:17:82:543:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:cratic politics. Nevertheless, this e-ect was minimized by the model in this subsection by assuming
12:529:32215:17:17:82:543:640:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:exogenous preferences for the paramilitaries. We will relax this assumption below. But \frst we
12:530:32310:17:17:82:543:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:discuss how the electoral role of paramilitaries a-ects the decision of the central government to
12:531:32407:17:30:82:480:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:extend (\broadcast") its power to peripheral areas controlled by the paramilitaries.

12:533:32528:24:17:82:544:552:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Taking the electoral equilibrium at timet= 1 as given, let us now consider the decisions of
12:534:32619:17:17:82:543:535:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the government (partyA) at timet= 0. In particular, as discussed in the Introduction, a key
12:535:32710:17:17:82:543:518:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:dimension of the process of the formation of the state is the ability and willingness of the central
12:536:32810:17:17:82:543:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:government to establish its monopoly of violence and thus remove the power of other groups with
12:537:32905:17:17:82:543:484:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:access to guns and means of exercising (local) violence. Let us model this in the simplest possible
12:538:33004:17:17:82:441:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:way and suppose that at timet= 0, the objective of the governing party is

12:549:33380:17:17:82:543:353:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:security gains that the central government will drive and subtracts the potential \real" cost of the
12:550:33480:17:17:82:543:336:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reconquest (spending on the military, potentially stability and loss of life). However, the objective
12:551:33581:17:17:82:543:319:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the governing party, partyA, also includes the probability that it will remain in power, thus

12:553:33769:17:17:82:543:285:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the subsequent electoral equilibrium at timet= 1, partyAwill obtain a fraction 1=2 +--jof the

12:558:34187:17:29:99:498:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This analysis in the preceding paragraph then establishes the following proposition.

13:572:34715:24:17:99:543:661:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This proposition is an important result of our analysis and will be investigated in our empirical
13:573:34812:17:17:82:543:644:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:work. It implies that the willingness of the state to reconquer areas controlled by the paramili-
13:574:34909:17:17:82:543:627:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:taries, and thus establish the monopoly of violence envisaged as an essential characteristic of the
13:575:35008:17:17:82:543:610:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:modern state by Max Weber, is a-ected not only by the real costs and bene\fts of doing so, but
13:576:35102:17:17:82:543:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:also by the implications of this expansion of the authority of the state on electoral outcomes. In
13:577:35200:17:17:82:543:576:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:particular, if many of these paramilitary-controlled areas havemj> --j, then the state, currently
13:578:35297:17:17:82:543:559:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:controlled by partyA, will be reluctant to reconquer these areas, because doing so will make it
13:579:35392:17:17:82:543:542:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:more di-cult for this party to succeed in the upcoming elections (and moreover, this e-ect will
13:580:35487:17:17:82:543:525:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:be stronger when rents from power att= 1,RA, are higher). Naturally, the areas that are most
13:581:35579:17:17:82:543:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:valuable in the hands of the paramilitaries are those that have both low-jand highmj; that

13:583:35764:17:17:82:543:474:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f2:vote in favor of partyA. A government that does not require electoral support (e.g., a \purely
13:584:35858:17:17:82:543:457:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:non-democratic" government) would have decided to reconquer all areas with\rj>0. Therefore,

13:587:36132:17:17:82:543:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:may be less willing to broadcast its power and reconquer areas under paramilitary control than
13:588:36226:17:17:82:486:389:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f5:such a non-democratic government (or a government that is secure in its position).11
13:589:36310:17:17:99:543:372:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Note an important implication of the functional form assumptions we have imposed so far,
13:590:36398:17:17:82:543:355:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in particular the uniform distributions of idiosyncratic preference and valance terms: the value
13:591:36494:17:17:82:543:338:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of additional votes to the party in power is constant and independent of its \expected winning
13:592:36588:17:17:82:543:321:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:probability". As a consequence, Proposition 3 takes a simple form, where the value of paramilitary
13:593:36686:17:17:82:543:304:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:votes to the party in power is independent of this probability. With other functional forms, as
13:594:36781:17:17:82:543:287:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in reality, this value, and thus the behavior of this party towards the paramilitary groups, may
13:595:36877:17:17:82:543:270:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:depend on its expected winning probability, for example, making it less responsive to the votes
13:596:36972:17:29:82:510:253:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f5:delivered by these paramilitary forces when it is ex ante more likely to win the election.12

13:598:37139:24:17:82:543:200:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The discussion so far was for paramilitaries with endogenous preferences and thus took the vec-

13:600:37328:14:15:91:543:169:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:11Naturally, the net bene\ft of reconquering an area might be di-erent for a non-democratic government. For
13:601:37435:15:11:82:543:154:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:example, it might be ^\rj>\rjinstead of\rj, because a non-democratic government can impose higher taxes on
13:602:37541:11:11:82:543:143:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:certain regions than democratic governments could or would. This would be another incentive for non-democratic
13:603:37651:11:10:82:543:132:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:governments to broadcast their power. On the other hand, the cost of doing so may also be higher for non-democratic
13:604:37766:10:11:82:543:122:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:governments because they may be unwilling to build a strong army because of the future potential threats that this
13:605:37880:11:8:82:490:111:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:may pose to their reign (e.g., Acemoglu, Ticchi and Vindigni, 2010). This would then imply ^\rj<\rj.

15:738:41250:17:17:82:543:403:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:between paramilitaries and the executive mentioned in the Introduction. Moreover, it can further
15:739:41346:17:17:82:543:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:increase the inequality among the regions, with the policies chosen speci\fcally to support, or

15:741:41539:17:17:82:543:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Two features determine how slanted towards the paramilitaries equilibrium policies are. These
15:742:41632:17:17:82:543:335:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are: the size of the paramilitary-controlled areas (the greater isz, the more in\ruential are the
15:743:41729:17:17:82:543:318:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:paramilitaries in shaping equilibrium policy) and the relative responsiveness of the paramilitaries
15:744:41828:17:17:82:543:301:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to policy concessions (the greater is^-relative to-, the more responsive are policies to paramilitary
15:745:41929:17:17:82:543:284:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:preferences relative to citizen preferences).  In addition, because electoral competition makes
15:746:42024:17:17:82:543:267:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:both parties cater to the wishes of the paramilitaries, at the end the paramilitaries ideological
15:747:42121:17:17:82:543:250:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:preferences play a central role in whether they force the population to vote for partyAor party
15:748:42216:17:17:82:102:233:11:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f5:B.13
15:749:42220:17:17:99:543:216:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Finally, we can also allow both parties or one of the parties to modify its ideological stance
15:750:42314:17:17:82:543:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(in a credible fashion). The same analysis as here will then imply that in order to attract votes
15:751:42411:17:17:82:543:182:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:from paramilitary-controlled areas, one or both parties may decide to pander to the ideological
15:752:42506:17:16:82:238:165:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:preferences of the paramilitaries.
15:753:42540:16:15:91:543:149:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:13The result that both parties modify their policies to partly cater to the wishes of the paramilitaries has an
15:754:42651:15:11:82:543:134:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:obvious similarity, and an identical mathematical logic, to Baron's (1994) result concerning the e-ects of a lobby
15:755:42765:11:0:82:254:123:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:on the platforms of two competing parties.
16:756:42809:0:24:82:345:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2.5  Importance of Non-National Ambitions
16:757:42850:24:17:82:543:684:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:An important question in the context of Colombian politics is why right-wing paramilitary groups
16:758:42946:17:17:82:543:667:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:have become more involved in in\ruencing elections than left-wing guerrillas, in particular, more so
16:759:43046:17:17:82:543:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:than the relatively well-organized FARC. One possible answer is that in contrast to the guerrillas,
16:760:43145:17:17:82:543:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the paramilitaries do not have national ambitions, making a coalition between them and the
16:761:43235:17:17:82:543:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:executive controlling the central state more feasible. The model presented so far has implicitly
16:762:43331:17:17:82:543:599:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:made this assumption, since we did not introduce the risk that the non-state armed actors may
16:763:43424:17:17:82:210:582:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:take over the central state.
16:764:43452:17:17:99:543:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A simple way of introducing this possibility would be to have a probability \b(z) that the non-
16:765:43547:17:17:82:543:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:state armed actors would become strong enough to challenge the central state, perhaps overthrow
16:766:43642:17:17:82:543:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:it. Such an overthrow of the central government by non-state armed actors is not uncommon in
16:767:43734:17:17:82:543:514:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:weak African states, such as Somalia, Sierra Leone or Liberia, and has certainly been the objective
16:768:43833:17:17:82:543:497:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the FARC. Naturally, we would expect \b(z) to be increasing inz, so that when these groups
16:769:43926:17:17:82:543:480:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:control more areas, they are more likely to pose such a national challenge. In that case, we would
16:770:44024:17:17:82:543:463:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:need to change the objective function of partyAto incorporate this possibility. For example,
16:771:44116:17:18:82:242:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:equation (5) could be modi\fed to

16:780:44278:18:17:82:543:364:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:Ato reconquer territories controlled by these non-state armed groups (thus reducingz). When
16:781:44369:17:17:82:543:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:\b(z) is su-ciently high and su-ciently decreasing inz, this e-ect can more than compensate for
16:782:44464:17:17:82:543:330:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the electoral advantage that local control by these groups creates for the party in power. Thus
16:783:44559:17:17:82:543:313:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:factoring in the national ambitions of non-state armed actors reduces the room for a coalition
16:784:44653:17:17:82:543:296:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:or a symbiotic relationship between these groups and the executive. Expressed di-erently, this
16:785:44747:17:17:82:543:279:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reasoning suggests that when non-state armed actors have national ambitions, it will be advanta-
16:786:44843:17:17:82:543:262:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:geous for the central state to eliminate them (sooner or later), thus any implicit or explicit policy
16:787:44944:17:17:82:543:245:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:promises that it makes to such groups would be non-credible, making a coalition between them
16:788:45036:17:17:82:543:228:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:impossible. This perspective suggests a natural reason for why, in Colombia, such a coalition may
16:789:45133:17:17:82:543:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:have been much more likely to arise between the executive and the paramilitaries rather than
16:790:45225:17:29:82:158:194:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with the FARC.
16:791:45239:29:24:82:327:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:2.6  Summary and Empirical Predictions
16:792:45277:24:17:82:543:141:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In the rest of the paper, we will investigate the e-ect of Colombian paramilitary forces on the
16:793:45372:17:17:82:543:124:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:electoral outcomes in the early 2000s. Our investigation is motivated by the theoretical ideas
16:794:45466:17:17:82:543:107:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:discussed above. In particular, we will document the following broad patterns, which, though not
16:795:45562:17:0:82:400:90:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:conclusive proof of the ideas developed here, are highly suggestive.
17:796:45632:0:17:96:544:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1. Consistent with Proposition 2, paramilitaries, once they became su-ciently powerful, started
17:797:45727:17:26:110:452:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in\ruencing electoral outcomes in the areas of Colombia they controlled.
17:798:45799:26:17:96:543:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2. Consistent with Proposition 3, we will show that paramilitaries located in areas that voted
17:799:45893:17:17:110:544:648:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for the current President in great numbers, but in past elections tended to vote for more
17:800:45982:17:26:110:321:631:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:liberal politicians, are more likely to persist.
17:801:46030:26:17:96:543:605:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:3. Consistent with Proposition 4, we will show that the President has proposed legislation in
17:802:46123:17:17:110:544:588:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:line with the preferences of the paramilitaries, and the Senators elected from high paramil-
17:803:46215:17:35:110:313:571:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:itary areas have supported this legislation.

17:805:46316:24:24:82:391:512:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:3.1  Origins of Colombian Non-State Armed Actors
17:806:46364:24:17:82:543:488:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Colombia has a long history of non-state armed actors. During the 19th century the country was
17:807:46458:17:18:82:543:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:convulsed by a series of civil wars which culminated in the War of Thousand Days between 1899
17:808:46551:18:17:82:543:453:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and 1902 (see Pardo, 2004, for an overview).  Relative peace emerged subsequently (Mazzuca
17:809:46641:17:17:82:543:436:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and Robinson, 2009) and lasted until the 1940s when the country again slipped into a murderous
17:810:46735:17:17:82:543:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:civil war known asLa Violencia,which slowly came to a halt after 1958 when the Liberal and
17:811:46825:17:17:82:543:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Conservative parties signed a peace treaty and re-established elections, albeit under a highly
17:812:46919:17:17:82:543:385:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:restrictive set of power sharing institutions known as the National Front (see Guzm-an Campos,
17:813:47013:17:17:82:543:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f4:Fals Borda and Uma~na Luna, 1962, Oquist, 1980, P-ecaut, 2001, Rold-an, 2002 onLa Violencia
17:814:47104:17:17:82:543:351:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and Hartlyn, 1988, on the National Front). Though the National Front brought to an end the 100
17:815:47198:17:17:82:543:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:year con\rict between the Liberal and Conservative parties, it issued in multifarious new forms
17:816:47293:17:17:82:543:317:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of con\rict.  In 1964 out of the ashes of various Liberal and Communist guerillas, was formed
17:817:47386:17:17:82:543:300:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC|The Revolutionary Armed Forces
17:818:47470:17:17:82:543:283:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of Colombia). In the same year the Ej-ercito de Liberaci-on Nacional (ELN|National Liberation
17:819:47563:17:17:82:543:266:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Army) was also created. These `left-wing' guerilla groups were relatively small during the 1960s
17:820:47659:17:17:82:543:249:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and 1970s, but began to expand rapidly in the 1980s and they were joined by other left-wing
17:821:47750:17:17:82:543:232:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:revolutionary movements such as the Movimiento 19 de Abril (M-19|Movement of April 19)
17:822:47836:17:17:82:543:215:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and Quint--n Lame. The 1980s also saw the rapid expansion of `right-wing' paramilitary forces
17:823:47929:17:17:82:543:198:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:which in 1997 coalesced into the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC|United Self-Defense
17:824:48018:17:17:82:212:181:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Organization of Colombia).
17:825:48044:17:17:99:543:164:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:These various non-state armed groups ranged over most of the territory of Colombia and
17:826:48130:17:17:82:543:147:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:though estimates vary, may have had around 50,000 men and women under arms at the start
17:827:48217:17:17:82:543:130:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the 21st Century. They engaged in kidnapping, massacres of civilians, drug production and
17:828:48309:17:17:82:543:113:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:exportation, and regularly expropriated land and extorted income (`collected the taxes') from
17:829:48402:17:0:82:543:96:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Colombian citizens. They also engaged in violent con\ricts with each other and with the armed
18:830:48497:0:17:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:forces of the Colombian state. Map 1 in the Appendix shows the distribution of the FARC/ELN
18:831:48588:17:17:82:543:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and the AUC across Colombia's 1,119 municipalities (using the `attacks' data, described below,
18:832:48682:17:17:82:543:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:over the period 1997-2005).  The map uses di-erent shades of red to indicate municipalities
18:833:48773:17:17:82:543:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in di-erent quintiles of the distribution of guerrilla presence.  The darkest red indicates the
18:834:48868:17:17:82:543:640:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:20% of places with the most intense guerilla activity.  One can see that this covers most of
18:835:48960:17:17:82:543:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Colombia. Departments in the eastern planes (`Los Llanos'), such as Arauca and Casanare, have
18:836:49053:17:17:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:high guerilla presence as do municipalities further south in Caquet-a, where the negotiations took
18:837:49151:17:17:82:543:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:place during the Presidency of Andr-es Pastrana.  However, high guerilla presence can also be
18:838:49244:17:17:82:543:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:seen in the Northeast, in the department of Norte de Santander, further west in Antioquia and
18:839:49337:17:17:82:543:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the southwest in Cauca. Map 2 in the Appendix examines paramilitary presence using the
18:840:49426:17:17:82:543:538:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:same data. One sees high paramilitary presence, measured in the same way as for the guerilla,
18:841:49519:17:17:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in many of the same areas. These include the eastern planes, Norte de Santander and Antioquia.
18:842:49613:17:17:82:543:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Paramilitary presence is also high in municipalities in the coastal department of Magdalena and
18:843:49708:17:17:82:543:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in C-esar, inbetween Magdalena and Norte de Santander.  This is natural, since paramilitaries
18:844:49801:17:30:82:295:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:often formed to \fght the left-wing guerrillas.
18:845:49848:30:24:82:279:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:3.2  Paramilitaries and the AUC
18:846:49879:24:17:82:543:416:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Colombia's paramilitaries are thought to originate from 1960s counterinsurgency measures and
18:847:49971:17:17:82:543:399:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Law 48 of 1968 which allowed the creation of self-defense militias by private citizens for the
18:848:50065:17:17:82:543:382:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:purposes of protecting their properties and lives (see Romero, 2000, 2002, Rangel, 2005, and
18:849:50157:17:17:82:543:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Duncan, 2007, for overviews of the history and organization of the paramilitaries). Nevertheless,
18:850:50254:17:17:82:543:348:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the period ofLa Violenciais littered with various sorts of militias and spontaneous self-defense
18:851:50350:17:17:82:543:331:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:groups (see Rold-an, 2002, on Antioquia). Small groups of paramilitaries also emerged in places
18:852:50445:17:17:82:543:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:where there were valuable resources whose exploitation was contested such as in the emerald
18:853:50536:17:17:82:543:297:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:mines of Muzo, in the department of Boyac-a and the drug plantations on the coast near Santa
18:854:50628:17:17:82:389:280:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Marta, Magdalena and in the nearby department of La Guajira.
18:855:50688:17:17:99:543:263:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The escalation of paramilitaries in the early 1980s is associated with the rise of the large drug
18:856:50785:17:17:82:543:246:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:cartels in Medell--n and Cali that faced threats of kidnapping and extortion from left-wing groups.
18:857:50884:17:17:82:543:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In 1981 Martha Nieves Ochoa, the sister of Jorge Luis Ochoa V-azquez, one of the founders of the
18:858:50980:17:17:82:543:212:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Medell--n drug cartel (along with his brothers, Pablo Escobar, Carlos Lehder and Jos-e Gonzalo
18:859:51074:17:17:82:543:195:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Rodr--guez Gacha), was kidnapped by the guerilla group M-19. In retaliation, the cartel formed an
18:860:51171:17:17:82:543:178:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:armed paramilitary group called Muerte a Secuestradores (MAS|Death to Kidnappers) whose
18:861:51258:17:17:82:240:161:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:aim was to eliminate kidnappers.
18:862:51290:17:17:99:543:144:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:As the wealth of the drug cartels grew, many of their members began to buy up land and
18:863:51376:17:17:82:543:127:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ranches in rural areas. Here their interests began to fuse with those of traditional rural elites who
18:864:51477:17:17:82:543:110:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:also wished to protect themselves from extortion and kidnappers (see Guti-errez San--n and Bar-on,
18:865:51575:17:0:82:543:93:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2005, for a study of this process in the Puerto Boyac-a region). This led to collaboration in the
19:866:51674:0:17:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:formation of paramilitary groups. One area of rapid expansion was the Magdalena Medio at the
19:867:51766:17:17:82:543:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:eastern periphery of the department of Antioquia which saw the emergence of groups such as Los
19:868:51860:17:17:82:543:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Tangueros formed by the Casta~no brothers (Carlos, Fidel and Vicente). Five of Carlos Casta~no's
19:869:51956:17:17:82:543:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:11 siblings were killed by guerrillas, following the abduction and death of their dairy-farmer father,
19:870:52058:17:17:82:543:640:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Jesus Casta~no, in 1981. In 1981, FARC snatched the Casta~no's father and demanded a $7,500
19:871:52149:17:17:82:543:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ransom, which was raised by mortgaging the farm. Though the ransom was paid, the father's
19:872:52238:17:17:82:490:606:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f5:corpse was found chained to a tree. Los Tangueros was founded to revenge this act.14
19:873:52322:17:17:99:543:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In 1992 people who had been victimized by the drug lord Pablo Escobar founded a paramilitary
19:874:52414:17:17:82:543:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:organization called `Los Pepes' (`Perseguidos por Pablo Escobar'|those persecuted by Pablo
19:875:52504:17:17:82:543:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Escobar). This group, which played an important informal role in the hunt for Escobar and his
19:876:52597:17:17:82:543:538:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:death in 1993 (Bowden, 2002) apparently included all of the Casta~no brothers, even though they
19:877:52692:17:17:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:had previously cooperated with the Medell--n cartel. In 1994 the brothers formed the `Autodefensas
19:878:52790:17:17:82:543:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Campesinas de C-ordoba y Urab-a' (ACCU|Peasant Self-Defense force of C-ordoba and Urab-a).
19:879:52880:17:17:82:543:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This further expansion was facilitated in the same year by a law promoted by President Samper
19:880:52973:17:17:82:543:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to allow the creation of CONVIVIR, a national program of neighborhood watch groups.  An
19:881:53060:17:17:82:544:453:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:important supported of this program was-Alvaro Uribe, then Governor of Antioquia, whose father
19:882:53154:17:17:82:199:436:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:was killed by the FARC.
19:883:53177:17:17:99:543:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In April 1997 the AUC was formed by Carlos Casta~no and it included possibly 90% of the
19:884:53264:17:17:82:543:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:existing paramilitary forces. The creation of this national organization increased the e-ectiveness
19:885:53363:17:17:82:543:385:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the paramilitaries considerably; as a result, the FARC and ELN were thrown out of large areas
19:886:53459:17:17:82:543:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the country, though as our data will show these guerrilla groups are still active in many parts
19:887:53557:17:17:82:348:351:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f5:of Colombia (see Restrepo, Spagat and Vargas, 2004).15
19:888:53611:17:18:99:543:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Soon after coming to power in 2002, President Uribe began to negotiate the demobilization of
19:889:53703:18:17:82:543:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the paramilitaries, something he had promised during his election campaign. Decree 128 issued by
19:890:53799:17:17:82:543:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the President in January 2003 gave de facto amnesty for paramilitaries not under investigation for
19:891:53897:17:17:82:543:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:human rights violations and this has been applied to the vast number of demobilizations (around
19:892:53992:17:17:82:543:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:92%). On July 15, 2003 in Santa F-e de Ralito in C-ordoba the government signed an agreement
19:893:54084:17:17:82:408:248:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f5:with most of the groups of the AUC to disarm by the end of 2005.16
19:894:54150:17:17:99:543:231:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:On November 25 2003 around 860 paramilitaries of Medell--n's Cacique Nutibara Bloc led by
19:895:54239:17:17:82:543:214:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:`Don Berna' (Diego Fernando Murillo) demobilized. This process was further institutionalized by
19:896:54334:17:16:82:543:197:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the passing of the controversial Justice and Peace Law in June 2005 which was signed into law
19:897:54427:16:14:91:543:181:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:14There is also evidence suggesting involvement of the army in the training and organization of paramilitary
19:898:54535:14:11:82:543:167:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:groups, though in 1989 the Colombian Supreme Court declared that Law 48 was unconstitutional. One month later
19:899:54644:11:11:82:543:156:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:President Barco issued Decree 1194 which prohibited the creation, promotion or organization of paramilitary or
19:900:54754:11:7:82:300:145:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:self-defense groups and declared such activities illegal.
19:901:54811:7:15:91:543:138:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:15The timing of the creation of the AUC was a consequence of the collapse of the Medell--n and Cali drug cartels
19:902:54923:15:7:82:406:123:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:which had previously exercised a large amount of control over the organizations.
19:903:55003:7:15:91:543:116:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:16The text of the agreement is available at the web page of the O-ce of the High Commissioner for Peace:

20:905:55163:0:17:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by President Uribe in the following month. Article 29 of this law limits sentences to those found
20:906:55260:17:17:82:543:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:guilty of human rights violations to between 5 and 8 years. Article 30 allows the government to
20:907:55355:17:17:82:543:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:determine the place of detention, which need not be a prison. In May 2006 the Colombian Con-
20:908:55447:17:17:82:543:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:stitutional Court altered many aspects of the law on the grounds that they were unconstitutional,
20:909:55544:17:17:82:543:640:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in particular the Court stipulated that demobilizing combatants had to give a full confession of
20:910:55640:17:17:82:543:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:their activities in order for the law to apply to them. Both the demobilization process and the
20:911:55735:17:17:82:478:606:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f5:Justice and Peace Law have been widely criticized by human rights organization.17
20:912:55816:17:17:99:543:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:There is a great deal of controversy about whether the paramilitary demobilization is real or
20:913:55909:17:17:82:543:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:whether it will lead to new armed groups (or simply to the institutionalization/legitimation of
20:914:56004:17:17:82:543:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the power of the AUC; on this issue see Pardo, 2007, International Crisis Group, 2007, Porch and

20:916:56117:30:24:82:377:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:3.3  The Involvement of Paramilitaries in Politics
20:917:56167:24:17:82:543:484:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Soon after the foundation of the AUC in 1997 there appears to have been a strategic decision to
20:918:56262:17:17:82:543:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in\ruence electoral politics. This change is traced to a historic meeting in Santa F-e de Ralito in
20:919:56361:17:17:82:543:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2001 where members of theestado mayor(the governing body) of the AUC along with politicians
20:920:56452:17:17:82:543:433:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and members of Congress signed a secret document calling for the `refounding of the country'.
20:921:56545:17:17:82:543:416:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Those who signed this document included prominent paramilitary leaders, such as Jorge 40 (Ro-
20:922:56638:17:17:82:543:399:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:drigo Tovar Pupo) and Diego Vecino, and several politicians subsequently arrested for links with
20:923:56734:17:17:82:543:382:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:paramilitaries, including Senators William Montes and Miguel de la Espriella (see Table 1). An
20:924:56828:17:16:82:542:365:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f5:explicit aim of the accord was to have the AUC play a more important role in electoral politics.18
20:925:56926:16:14:91:543:349:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:17For instance the 2007 report of the International Federation for Human Rights notes: \The paramilitaries who
20:926:57036:14:11:82:543:335:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:do fall under the Justice and Peace Act are tried at so-called \free version" hearings and may be sentenced to
20:927:57146:11:11:82:543:324:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:no more than eight years of imprisonment, which they may serve in \work farms." They may even impose their
20:928:57252:11:11:82:543:313:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:own conditions for \imprisonment," which \ries in the face of the most basic principles of justice in view of the
20:929:57365:11:11:82:543:302:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:seriousness of the crimes committed." The report also emphasizes \the lack of true willingness on the part of the
20:930:57478:11:11:82:543:291:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:government to bring to trial and dismantle the paramilitary groups," and concludes that: \The paramilitaries
20:931:57586:11:11:82:543:280:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:are not forced to confess to their crimes, disclose the truth about who supported their structures, or even show
20:932:57698:11:11:82:543:269:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:repentance for their crimes. They have not been forced to turn in all of their weapons or hand over their assets
20:933:57810:11:11:82:543:258:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:to compensate the victims, while the latter and their representatives have very limited access to hearings and are
20:934:57924:11:11:82:543:247:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:hindered from participating in them....What is more, those victims who have attended the \free version" hearings
20:935:58036:11:11:82:543:236:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:have not received adequate protection. Already, sixteen of them have been murdered with absolute impunity." See
20:936:58147:11:11:82:360:225:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:also Human Rights Watch (2005) and Amnesty International (2005).
20:937:58211:11:11:92:544:214:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:On the issue of handing in weapons the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (2007) noted at some key
20:938:58316:11:11:82:543:203:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:demobilizations in the department of C-esar that \approximately 800 persons had passed through that circuit on
20:939:58426:11:11:82:543:192:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:the previous day, but only 65 \frearms were received. It also noted that from the 200 persons passing through the
20:940:58539:11:11:82:543:181:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:circuit at La Mesa on the previous day, roughly 25 \frearms were received. None of the weapons surrendered were
20:941:58650:11:7:82:231:170:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:modern or in good condition" (p. 8).
20:942:58686:7:15:91:543:163:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:18Although the meeting in Ralito was probably the most important one for the subsequent strategy of the
20:943:58789:15:11:82:543:148:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:paramilitaries, it was not the only such pact between them and politicians during this period. In the southern
20:944:58899:11:11:82:543:137:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:plains, paramilitary leader Hector Buitrago (Martin Llanos) organized a meeting in 2000 with all the candidates
20:945:59010:11:11:82:543:126:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:running for the governor's and the mayor's o-ces and explicitly traded political support against key positions in
20:946:59123:11:11:82:543:115:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:the local executive, allocations of public contracts, and a share in the resources of the municipality (\La Sombra
20:947:59237:11:11:82:543:104:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:de Martin Llanos" Semana, October 8, 2007). In Puerto Berio, Antioquia, four congressmen from Santander met
20:948:59344:11:0:82:543:93:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:with paramilitary leader Salvatore Mancuso in 2001 for a similar pact. In the Municipalities of Chivolo and Pivijay
21:949:59461:0:17:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This change in the strategy of the AUC will be crucial to our empirical approach, allowing us
21:950:59554:17:17:82:543:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to investigate how electoral outcomes change di-erentially in high paramilitary areas before and
21:951:59650:17:17:82:283:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:after their involvement in politics in 2001.
21:952:59694:17:17:99:543:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The other notable, and related, development during the 2002 election is the emergence of
21:953:59782:17:17:82:543:640:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:brand new political parties, which we refer to as `third parties,' such as Cambio Radical and
21:954:59875:17:17:82:543:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:MIPOL. These parties often had explicit or implicit links with the paramilitaries, and the case
21:955:59970:17:17:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:study evidence shows that paramilitary pressure was often to increase the vote for these parties.
21:956:60067:17:17:82:543:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In many paramilitary-controlled areas they have replaced the traditional Liberal and Conservative
21:957:60164:17:17:82:543:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:parties. We will use the vote share of `third parties' as a measure of paramilitary in\ruence on
21:958:60260:17:17:82:173:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:electoral outcomes.
21:959:60279:17:17:99:543:538:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Beginning in 2005 there were increasing accusations of involvement of the AUC in the elections
21:960:60373:17:17:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of 2002. Scandal mounted further with the demobilization of Jorge 40 and his 2,000 strong block
21:961:60468:17:17:82:543:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on March 10, 2006 in La Mesa, C-esar. Jorge 40's computer fell into the hands of government
21:962:60559:17:17:82:543:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:o-cials and it contained emails ordering his men to recruit peasants to pretend to be paramilitaries
21:963:60659:17:17:82:543:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:during demobilization ceremonies.19The computer also listed over 500 murders and detailed many
21:964:60753:17:17:82:543:453:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:links between politicians and paramilitaries. These accusations led to intense scrutiny of the 2002
21:965:60852:17:17:82:543:436:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:election results many of which exhibit some rather extraordinary features. These include massive
21:966:60948:17:17:82:543:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:changes in voting patterns and very high concentrations of votes for some candidates in particular

21:968:61063:17:17:99:543:385:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Since then there have been many investigations of supposed links between politicians and
21:969:61151:17:17:82:543:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:paramilitaries and a large case study literature has emerged documenting such links (see in par-

21:972:61438:18:17:82:543:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and the Senate were under investigation, 36 were arrested and in detention, and 11 had been found
21:973:61535:17:17:82:543:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:guilty of links with paramilitaries.21In total this represents almost 1/3 of Colombian legislators.
21:974:61634:17:17:82:543:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Those previously arrested but released include Mario Uribe, President Uribe's cousin and main
21:975:61727:17:17:82:543:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:political adviser. Those arrested include Senator Carlos Garc--a, the President of the \U party"

21:977:61916:17:19:82:543:231:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:investigation and arrest of these politicians has been undertaken primarily by the Supreme Court.

22:988:62702:24:17:82:543:684:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:There is considerable case study evidence that following the meeting in Santa F-e de Ralito,
22:989:62794:17:17:82:543:667:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:paramilitary groups actively tried and succeeded in in\ruencing votes in national elections (that
22:990:62891:17:17:82:543:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is, in the 2002 and 2006 elections). The testimony of major paramilitary leaders suggests that these
22:991:62991:17:17:82:543:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:groups replaced the authority of the state in many areas and many of the paramilitary leaders
22:992:63084:17:17:82:543:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:have been quite articulate about their `political project'.  Of these the testimony of Salvatore
22:993:63180:17:29:82:297:599:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Mancuso is perhaps most telling, noting that
22:994:63224:29:17:126:516:570:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:\What I said is that 35% of the Congress was elected in areas where there were

22:1000:63661:29:17:99:543:456:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The investigation into the 2002 and 2006 election results and the testimony of demobilized
22:1001:63751:17:17:82:543:439:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:paramilitaries has revealed a large number of di-erent `pacts' between paramilitary leaders and
22:1002:63846:17:17:82:543:422:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:politicians (detailed in L-opez and Sevillano, 2008) and also demonstrates that a large number of
22:1003:63943:17:17:82:543:405:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:di-erent strategies were used to guarantee that candidates preferred by paramilitaries won elec-
22:1004:64039:17:17:82:543:388:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tions. A salient strategy seems to have been to terrorize people into voting for speci\fc candidates.
22:1005:64140:17:17:82:543:371:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In the municipality of San Onofre in the coastal department of Sucre,23for example, this was
22:1006:64232:17:29:82:301:354:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:arranged by the paramilitary leader `Cadena'.
22:1007:64277:29:17:126:516:325:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:\For the elections of 2002, the trucks sent by `Cadena' went through neighborhoods
22:1008:64359:17:17:110:516:308:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and rural areas of San Onofre picking people up. According to some people in this
22:1009:64440:17:17:110:516:291:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:municipality in Sucre, thousands of peasants were taken to the corregimiento `Plan
22:1010:64522:17:17:110:516:274:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Parejo' so they could see the candidate for whom they had to vote for in the legislative
22:1011:64610:17:17:110:516:257:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:elections: Jairo Merlano for Senate and Muriel Benito for the House of Representatives.

22:1014:64864:17:17:110:516:206:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a peasant from this town. The threat seems to have been e-ective: each candidate
22:1015:64944:17:16:110:272:189:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f5:obtained 40,000 votes in Sucre."24

23:1024:65786:0:17:99:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Sheer terror seems to have been used not just to induce people to vote for particular candidates
23:1025:65882:17:17:82:543:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:but also to keep them away from the polls so that ballot stu-ng and other forms of manipulation
23:1026:65977:17:17:82:543:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of vote totals could occur. Evidence of the use of coercion to keep people at home and away from

23:1028:66145:17:17:99:543:640:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Another strategy, where coercion also played an important role, involved collecting people's
23:1029:66237:17:17:82:543:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:cedulas (national identity cards which a person must produce to vote) from their houses, using
23:1030:66331:17:17:82:437:606:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f5:them to collect the ballots (the `tarjeton') and \flling them in for people.26
23:1031:66409:17:17:99:543:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Further evidence on how votes were delivered emerged during the testimony of Rafael Garc--a

23:1036:66890:17:17:82:543:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and even by departments." With this information in hand counterfeit ballots were created so
23:1037:66981:17:17:82:543:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:\that by the end of the elections they would include fake votes of the people who did not vote,
23:1038:67076:17:17:82:543:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and if there were ballots favoring other candidates di-erent from the ones from the paramilitary

23:1040:67247:17:17:99:543:436:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:All in all the evidence indicates that paramilitary groups used a wide variety of strategies to
23:1041:67342:17:17:82:543:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:make sure that their preferred candidates got elected. This ranged from terrorizing voters to vote
23:1042:67440:17:17:82:543:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in particular ways, terrorizing them to stay away from the polls so they could stu- ballots, voting

23:1051:68330:11:11:91:501:292:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:26This phenomenon is discussed in the article \Aqu-- nadie es un santo"Semana, September 29, 2007.
23:1052:68428:11:15:91:543:281:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:27According to the testimony given by Mrs. Judith Esther Salas Vallejo: \The [electoral] juries also marked

23:1055:68768:11:11:82:543:244:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:in Salamina and Remolino. One of the counsels sent by the paramilitaries told the juries that \the turnout is very low

23:1061:69354:11:10:82:543:178:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:departments. For instance: \In C-esar, \Jorge 40" aimed to obtain two Senators and four Representatives. The
23:1062:69462:10:11:82:543:168:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:department was divided into 3 electoral districts, one in the north and one in the south. Each of the candidates
23:1063:69574:11:11:82:543:157:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:would campaign in only one of those districts and each of these would support two candidates for the House of
23:1064:69683:11:11:82:543:146:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:Representatives. The third district would be open to free competition. To organize the lists they did everything,
23:1065:69796:11:11:82:543:135:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:from threats and expropriation of land to kidnappings. They killed Luis Laborde, former mayor of Copey and
23:1066:69902:11:11:82:543:124:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:candidate to the House of Representatives, who did not want to \play" the rules of the game that were imposed
23:1067:70011:11:11:82:543:113:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:by the AUC. \\Jorge 40" announced this crime in a meeting in San Angel, in which there were 9 mayors of the
23:1068:70118:11:11:82:543:102:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:department" says a witness. Since that moment it was completely clear that anyone who did not comply with
23:1069:70223:11:0:82:377:91:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:\Jorge 40's" rules could not do politics" (Semana, November 25th 2006).

24:1071:70395:30:24:82:418:678:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:3.5  The Involvement of Other Armed Actors in Politics
24:1072:70449:24:17:82:543:654:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our empirical results will show that the AUC more than any non-state armed actor has been
24:1073:70538:17:17:82:543:637:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:signi\fcantly in\ruencing elections in Colombia. Scattered pieces of evidence suggest that other
24:1074:70634:17:17:82:543:620:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:non-state armed actors have been involved, but have not pursued such a consistent electoral
24:1075:70725:17:17:82:543:603:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:strategy. For instance the drug lord Pablo Escobar got himself elected as an alternate for a list to
24:1076:70825:17:17:82:543:586:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Congress in 1982 for the Liberal party and it is very likely that he and members of the Medell--n
24:1077:70922:17:17:82:543:569:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:drug cartel had big impacts on elections in Antioquia, though to our knowledge the data have
24:1078:71014:17:17:82:543:552:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:never been systematically analyzed. Nevertheless, electoral strategies can be dangerous. Escobar's
24:1079:71112:17:17:82:543:535:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:election drew a lot of attention to him, which was probably not to the advantage of his business
24:1080:71208:17:17:82:543:518:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:interests and no doubt strengthened the resolve of the state to move against him. Similarly in the
24:1081:71306:17:17:82:543:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1980s when the FARC formed a party to contest elections, the Uni-on Patri-otica (UP- Patriotic
24:1082:71400:17:17:82:543:484:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Union) many of their supporters and candidates including their Presidential candidates in the
24:1083:71493:17:17:82:272:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1986 and 1990 elections were murdered.
24:1084:71531:17:17:99:543:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The FARC and ELN have also certainly in\ruenced some elections and have used their power
24:1085:71619:17:17:82:543:433:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to sway or intimidate voters in favor of candidates they preferred. They have threatened and
24:1086:71711:17:17:82:543:416:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:killed politicians. However, their involvement in elections has been more limited than that of
24:1087:71805:17:17:82:543:399:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the AUC. We conjecture that this is mostly because the FARC and ELN have been ideologically
24:1088:71896:17:17:82:543:382:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:opposed to the institutions of the state in Colombia and their project was to overthrow the
24:1089:71987:17:17:82:543:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:national government. As also emphasized by our theoretical discussion in subsection 2.5, this
24:1090:72080:17:17:82:543:348:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:made a symbiotic relationship between them and the executive impossible. In contrast, the AUC
24:1091:72173:17:17:82:543:331:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are a continuation of local paramilitary groups allied with local elites and politicians. Again in
24:1092:72271:17:17:82:543:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:light of our discussion in subsection 2.5, it was important that the AUC did not want to overthrow
24:1093:72369:17:17:82:543:297:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the state but to exercise control over certain peripheral areas and in\ruence key legislation. This
24:1094:72468:17:17:82:543:280:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:created a platform for a symbiotic relationship between the central state and the AUC, which
24:1095:72560:17:29:82:333:263:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:would have been impossible for the FARC and ELN.
24:1096:72608:29:24:82:303:234:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:3.6  The Colombian Political System
24:1097:72643:24:17:82:543:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Here we emphasize a few institutional details of the Colombian system that are important for our
24:1098:72739:17:17:82:543:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:empirical strategy. Under the 1991 Constitution the President of Colombia was elected for one
24:1099:72832:17:17:82:543:176:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:four year term with no possibility of re-election. There has been a strong norm against re-election
24:1100:72931:17:17:82:543:159:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:historically in Colombia and the last President to succeed himself was Rafael N-u~nez in 1886.
24:1101:73025:17:17:82:543:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Though under the 1886 Constitution re-election was permitted if not successive, it only happened
24:1102:73121:17:17:82:543:125:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:once with Alfonso L-opez Pumarejo being President between 1934 and 1938 and again between
24:1103:73210:17:17:82:543:108:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1942 and 1945 (when he ended his second term early by resigning). The President is elected by
24:1104:73303:17:0:82:543:91:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a national vote and if no candidate receives 50% of the vote in the \frst round a run-o- election
25:1105:73402:0:17:82:496:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is held between the two candidates with the largest number of votes in the \frst round.
25:1106:73489:17:17:99:543:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:It is also important to note that like most Presidential systems in Latin America, Colombia's
25:1107:73582:17:17:82:543:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:features strong Presidential dominance of the legislature with Presidents often ruling for long
25:1108:73677:17:17:82:208:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:periods by issuing decrees.
25:1109:73704:17:17:99:543:640:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:For the Senate there is a national constituency where 100 Senators are elected from lists. For
25:1110:73798:17:17:82:543:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the Congress there are 32 multi-member districts with each district corresponding to a department.
25:1111:73896:17:17:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The representation of departments depends on their population and there are 162 Congressmen
25:1112:73987:17:17:82:543:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in total. Historically in Colombia even traditional party lists are very personalized so the typical
25:1113:74087:17:17:82:543:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:situation is one where only one candidate is elected from each list. This situation did not change
25:1114:74185:17:17:82:543:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with the 2006 elections even though a reform in the electoral law stipulated that to win a seat
25:1115:74280:17:17:82:543:538:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the legislature a list had to have at least 2% of the vote nationally.  At the same time as
25:1116:74374:17:17:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:this law was introduced, the electoral system was changed to allow for open-list proportional
25:1117:74467:17:17:82:543:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:representation (with preference voting). Thus even though the number of lists fell dramatically,
25:1118:74563:17:17:82:363:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:personal politics continued unabated via preference voting.
25:1119:74622:17:17:99:543:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The organization of the Higher Courts in Colombia is rather intricate. There are four High
25:1120:74712:17:17:82:543:453:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Courts: the Supreme Court, the Conseil d' Etat (State Council), the Superior Council of the
25:1121:74803:17:17:82:543:436:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Judiciary and the Constitutional Court. While the \frst two have been in place since the 1886
25:1122:74896:17:17:82:543:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Colombian Constitution (although with some alterations), the latter ones were a creation of the
25:1123:74991:17:17:82:543:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1991 Constitution. For the purposes of paramilitary involvement in politics it is relevant to brie\ry
25:1124:75092:17:17:82:543:385:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:understand the basics of the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court. The Supreme Court's
25:1125:75184:17:17:82:543:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:main role is to review judgments of inferior (provincial) courts and decide whether there has been
25:1126:75282:17:17:82:543:351:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a correct interpretation of the law and/or the facts of the cases. The Court is divided in three
25:1127:75378:17:18:82:543:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sections: criminal, civil and labor. The Criminal Section of the Supreme Court is also in charge
25:1128:75474:18:17:82:543:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of trying and judging \the members of the Congress: Senate and Chamber of Representatives"
25:1129:75564:17:17:82:543:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(Article 235 # 3 { Constitution). This gives the Supreme Court the authority to judge members
25:1130:75657:17:17:82:543:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of Congress accused of having links with paramilitary groups. Some members of Congress, once
25:1131:75749:17:17:82:543:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:investigations for paramilitary links have started, have stepped down from their public o-ce to
25:1132:75844:17:17:82:543:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:avoid the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and have subjected themselves to ordinary procedures
25:1133:75940:17:17:82:291:231:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:under \lower-scale" prosecutors and judges.
25:1134:75983:17:17:99:543:214:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The Constitutional Court has two types of roles: on the one hand it is in charge of reviewing
25:1135:76076:17:17:82:543:197:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the judgment of provincial and sectional judges regarding `acciones de tutela,' which is a procedure
25:1136:76176:17:17:82:543:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that any person can start {generally against public o-cials{ in order to seek the protection of
25:1137:76271:17:17:82:543:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:his/her fundamental rights. On the other hand the Constitutional Court is in charge of judicial
25:1138:76366:17:17:82:543:146:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:review of legislation. In this role the Court determines whether a particular statute (law enacted by
25:1139:76467:17:17:82:543:129:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Congress) is constitutional. The Constitution provides that some statutes should be automatically
25:1140:76564:17:17:82:543:112:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reviewed by the Court, while in other cases the Court will only intervene when a citizen challenges
25:1141:76663:17:0:82:543:95:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the constitutionality of a particular statute.  In the case of the Justice and Peace Law, the
26:1142:76758:0:17:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Constitutional Court reviewed its constitutionality thanks to a challenge posed by a group of
26:1143:76851:17:17:82:336:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:citizens (under Article 241 of the 1991 Constitution).
26:1144:76905:17:17:99:543:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:There is a relatively high degree of autonomy of these High Courts vis--a-vis the Executive
26:1145:76996:17:17:82:543:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Branch, particularly the Supreme Court. There is no life tenure for the Justices in Colombia:
26:1146:77089:17:17:82:543:640:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:instead they serve during one eight-year term and re-election to the same court is explicitly
26:1147:77182:17:17:82:543:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:forbidden by the Constitution. When a Justice serves his time, the Supreme Court is in charge of
26:1148:77278:17:17:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:choosing a replacement from lists prepared by the Administrative Section of the Superior Council
26:1149:77374:17:17:82:543:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the Judiciary (another High Court also in charge of administrative functions regarding the
26:1150:77467:17:17:82:543:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:judiciary). In turn, the justices of the Administrative Section are appointed by the Constitutional
26:1151:77566:17:17:82:543:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Court (1 judge), by the Supreme Court (2 judges) and by the Conseil d'Etat (3 judges). The
26:1152:77656:17:17:82:543:538:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:impact of the legislative and executive branches is therefore very indirect on the Supreme Court.
26:1153:77753:17:17:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:They can to some extent in\ruence this process.  For instance the Constitutional Court has 9
26:1154:77845:17:17:82:543:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:judges elected for life by the Senate. However, the election takes place over lists of candidates
26:1155:77942:17:17:82:543:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:presented by the President (3 judges), the Supreme Court (3 judges) and the Conseil d'Etat (3
26:1156:78035:17:17:82:543:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:judges). Thus, from the nine justices sitting on the Constitutional Court in a particular term,
26:1157:78130:17:35:82:402:453:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:three of them have come out from lists presented by the President.

26:1168:79005:17:17:82:543:233:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by aggregating over many of these variables. For each armed actor we simply add the following
26:1169:79098:17:17:82:543:216:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:variables: explosive terrorist acts, incendiary terrorist acts, other terrorist acts, assaults to private
26:1170:79203:17:17:82:543:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:property, attacks on civil organizations, political assassination attempts, road blockades, armed
26:1171:79300:17:17:82:543:182:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:contact between state and non-state armed forces initiated by the latter, ambushes of civilians,
26:1172:79396:17:17:82:543:165:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:harassing (mainly threats to civilians), incursion into `villages', overland piracy, illegal checkpoints,
26:1173:79501:17:17:82:543:148:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:armed forces wounded by the non-state armed group, murders of civilians, murders of politicians,
26:1174:79597:17:17:82:543:131:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:massacres, deaths of members of the state armed forces, kidnappings of members of the armed
26:1175:79688:17:17:82:543:114:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:forces, kidnappings of politicians and kidnappings of civilians. We have this variable for each year
26:1176:79788:17:0:82:211:97:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the period 1997 to 2005.
27:1177:79817:0:17:99:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We check the robustness of our results with an alternative measure of the presence of non-
27:1178:79907:17:17:82:543:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:state armed actors based on displaced people.  The database from which we constructed our
27:1179:79996:17:17:82:543:674:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f2:displacedmeasure comes from Acci-on Social an agency created by the presidency. This data is
27:1180:80088:17:17:82:544:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:collected from people that report themselves and are classi\fed as displaced in the Registro-Unico
27:1181:80186:17:17:82:543:640:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:de Poblaci-on Desplazada (unique register of displaced population) in order to obtain a set of
27:1182:80280:17:17:82:543:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:subsidies. These data specify the municipality where the displacement originated, the year of the
27:1183:80377:17:17:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:displacement and the armed actor that originated it. We have these data annually for the period
27:1184:80472:17:17:82:154:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1997 and 2006.
27:1185:80486:17:17:99:543:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We use these data to construct various measures of the presence of non-state armed actors.
27:1186:80576:17:17:82:543:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Because the time series variation in both the attacks and the displaced measures appears to be
27:1187:80670:17:17:82:543:538:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:quite noisy, we focus on `averages' of these data, though we also exploit over-time variation in some
27:1188:80771:17:17:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:speci\fcations. Our \frst main measure of paramilitary presence, referred to asparamilitary attacks,
27:1189:80871:17:17:82:543:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is total paramilitary attacks between 1997 and 2005 in municipalitymper 1000 inhabitants where
27:1190:80965:17:17:82:543:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the population measure is the average population between the 1993 and 2005 censuses. Our second
27:1191:81060:17:17:82:543:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f4:measure is a dummy that takes the value of 1 if municipalitymhas a value ofparamilitary attacks
27:1192:81155:17:17:82:543:453:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:above the 75th percentile.28We also construct two similar measures with the displaced variable
27:1193:81249:17:17:82:429:436:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and identical measures for guerrilla attacks (FARC and ELN combined).
27:1194:81318:17:17:99:543:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We take elections results from the Senate, Congress and Presidential elections 1991-2006 from
27:1195:81411:17:17:82:543:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the Registradur--a Nacional del Estado Civil. Using the names of the political parties to which
27:1196:81506:17:17:82:543:385:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:politicians belonged, we constructed party vote shares in each municipality. We then classi\fed
27:1197:81601:17:17:82:543:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:parties into `third', `left' and `traditional' (Liberals or Conservatives) political parties, and calcu-
27:1198:81705:17:17:82:543:351:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:lated the vote share of third parties in each municipality.29For Presidential elections we took the
27:1199:81804:17:18:82:299:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:numbers from the \frst round election results.
27:1200:81850:18:17:99:543:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In addition to the third party vote share, we also investigate the e-ect of paramilitaries on
27:1201:81943:17:17:82:543:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:electoral outcomes by looking at electoral concentration. This is motivated by the case study
27:1202:82036:17:17:82:543:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:evidence from Magdalena, which is discussed in the Appendix, which shows how paramilitary
27:1203:82125:17:17:82:543:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in\ruence creates a highly concentrated vote share pattern in a few municipalities (where they
27:1204:82219:17:17:82:543:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:have presumably used coercion or manipulated the vote).Electoral concentrationis de\fned as
27:1205:82310:17:17:82:543:231:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the vote share of the most popular list in a municipality (for the Senate or Congress, and in the
27:1206:82407:17:17:82:543:214:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tables it is referred to as `winning votes share').30Finally, we obtained data from two crucial
27:1207:82502:17:13:82:298:197:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f5:roll-call votes from theGacetas del Senado.31
27:1208:82547:13:15:91:543:184:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:28Less than half of the municipalities have any paramilitaryAttacks; in contrast, only two municipalities have
27:1209:82657:15:7:82:367:169:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:zeroDisplacements, though several municipalities have very low levels.
27:1210:82727:7:15:91:543:162:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:29Given our focus on the impact of the AUC, when we examine votes for third parties, we do not consider parties
27:1211:82838:15:11:82:543:147:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:in the left-wing coalition, the Polo Democr-atico (`Democratic pole'), which are unconnected with the paramilitaries,
27:1212:82955:11:7:82:399:136:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:as `third parties'. See Valencia (2007) for a similar distinction and calculation.
27:1213:83037:7:15:91:543:129:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:30The results using a Her\fndahl index to measure electoral concentration are very similar and omitted to save
27:1214:83147:15:7:82:106:114:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:space.
27:1215:83153:7:0:91:389:107:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:31Roll-calls are not taken for most votes in either the Senate or Congress.
28:1216:83230:0:17:99:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:As controls, we collected data on the vote share of-Alvaro G-omez in the 1986 Presidential
28:1217:83320:17:17:82:543:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:election to construct a measure of the extent of `right-wing' support in a municipality. G-omez
28:1218:83415:17:17:82:543:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:was the son of the right wing conservative President Laureano G-omez from the earlier 1950s and
28:1219:83510:17:17:82:543:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ran on a very conservative platform as the Presidential candidate for the Conservative party.
28:1220:83603:17:17:82:543:640:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Similarly, we use the vote share of Jaime Pardo Leal the Presidential candidate for the Uni-on
28:1221:83697:17:17:82:543:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Patri-otica in the same election. Since the Uni-on Patri-otica was the uno-cial political wing of the
28:1222:83798:17:17:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:FARC, Pardo Leal's vote share is a good measure of `left-wing' support in a municipality. In many
28:1223:83895:17:17:82:543:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of our regressions, we also include interactions between a full set of time dummies and various
28:1224:83990:17:17:82:543:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:municipality-level controls. These controls are the land Gini in 1985, the area of the municipality,
28:1225:84090:17:17:82:543:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:altitude, distance to state capital, average municipality population between 1993 and 2005, an
28:1226:84184:17:17:82:543:538:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:index of how rural the population of the municipality is (in 1993), an index of `unful\flled basic
28:1227:84282:17:17:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:needs' in 1993, proxying for the level of poverty in the municipality, and dummies for coca
28:1228:84373:17:30:82:541:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:cultivation in 1994 and opium cultivation in 1994 (these controls are from the CEDE database).
28:1229:84467:30:24:82:237:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:4.2  Descriptive Statistics
28:1230:84494:24:17:82:543:450:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics. Columns 1 and 2 report the mean and standard devia-
28:1231:84587:17:17:82:543:433:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tion of the variables for the whole sample. Columns 3-6 report the same two variables for high
28:1232:84681:17:17:82:543:416:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:paramilitary areas where we use the attacks dummy de\fned in the last section to decide whether
28:1233:84776:17:17:82:336:399:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:or not a municipality has high paramilitary presence.
28:1234:84829:17:17:99:543:382:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The \frst two sets of rows show the rapid increase in paramilitary presence between 1996-1997
28:1235:84922:17:17:82:543:365:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and 2000-2001 with some evidence that this fell in 2004-2005. Interestingly, the next set of rows
28:1236:85019:17:17:82:543:348:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:show a similar increase in guerilla presence (with no tendency to fall in the most recent period,
28:1237:85116:17:17:82:543:331:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:despite President Uribe's intensi\fcation of the war against the FARC). Looking at columns 3
28:1238:85208:17:17:82:543:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and 5 it is evident that there is a positive correlation between paramilitary presence and guerilla
28:1239:85307:17:17:82:543:297:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:presence, which is not surprising since, as we discussed above, paramilitary units were often
28:1240:85400:17:17:82:228:280:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:formed to combat the guerilla.
28:1241:85430:17:17:99:543:263:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:There are several noteworthy features of the data highlighted by Table 2. Rows 9-12 show a
28:1242:85520:17:17:82:543:246:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:large increase in the share of third parties after 2002, and this increase is more pronounced in
28:1243:85616:17:17:82:543:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:high paramilitary areas. Our measure of electoral concentration also increases after 2002, and
28:1244:85710:17:17:82:543:212:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:this is again largely concentrated in high paramilitary areas (rows 13-16). Finally, rows 17 and
28:1245:85806:17:17:82:543:195:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:18 show a noticeable increase in the vote share of the winning presidential candidate in the high
28:1246:85903:17:17:82:543:178:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:paramilitary areas. These patterns give a preview of our regression evidence that will be presented
28:1247:86002:17:17:82:476:161:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the next section, as part of the evidence of paramilitary involvement in politics.
28:1248:86087:17:17:99:543:144:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Rows 19-24 show that there are also some notable di-erences between high and low paramili-
28:1249:86177:17:17:82:543:127:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tary areas in terms of the covariates. Most importantly, low paramilitary areas appear to be more
28:1250:86274:17:17:82:543:110:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:`right-wing'. This is reassuring in connection with the concerns that our measure of paramilitary
28:1251:86371:17:0:82:543:93:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:presence will capture latent right-wing leanings. There are also some di-erences in terms of other
29:1252:86471:0:35:82:312:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:covariates, though these appear relatively small.

29:1254:86566:28:17:82:543:645:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We now investigate econometrically the impact of non-state armed actors on electoral outcomes,
29:1255:86660:17:17:82:543:628:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:starting with their impact on the vote share of third parties. Our basic regressions will be from
29:1256:86757:17:27:82:314:611:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a simple panel data model of the following form:

29:1264:87412:18:17:82:543:453:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a potentially di-erential growth e-ect for every time period (relative to the base, initial date).
29:1265:87510:17:17:82:543:436:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This speci\fcation will enable us to focus on whether there is a change in an outcome variable
29:1266:87604:17:17:82:543:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(for example, the third party vote share) after the AUC become involved in politics. Our \frst
29:1267:87698:17:17:82:543:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:dependent variable will be the vote share of third parties, proxying for the direct e-ect of the
29:1268:87794:17:17:82:543:385:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:AUC in elections, and we have these data for the 1991, 1994, 1998, 2002 and 2006 elections.
29:1269:87885:17:17:82:543:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This enables us to include interactions with the 1994, 1998, 2002 and 2006 dummies and our

29:1275:88367:28:17:82:543:244:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:which include both a time-varying main e-ect of paramilitary and guerrilla presence, and focus
29:1276:88461:17:17:82:543:227:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on the interaction between year e-ects and the time-varying measures. The disadvantage of this
29:1277:88555:17:17:82:543:210:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:model is that, as noted above, year-to-year variation in paramilitary and guerrilla presence is often
29:1278:88656:17:17:82:543:193:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:due to measurement error. To minimize the impact of year-to-year variations, we estimate (8)
29:1279:88748:17:17:82:542:176:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f5:only using the election years for 1998, 2002 and 2006 and construct two dummy variablesPm;t-1

29:1281:88932:17:17:82:543:142:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:above the 75th percentile.Gm;t-1is constructed similarly. For the 1998 election we just use the
29:1282:89027:17:17:82:543:125:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1997 data, for 2002 we used data from 2000 and 2001, and so on. Equation (8) also includes the

30:1289:89592:17:17:82:543:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:subsequent tables, all standard errors are fully robust (allowing for arbitrary serial correlation at
30:1290:89693:17:17:82:543:599:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the municipality level), and Tables 3-7 include a full set of municipality and time dummies in all
30:1291:89791:17:17:82:148:582:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:speci\fcations.
30:1292:89806:17:17:99:543:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 3 shows a robust positive and signi\fcant e-ect in both 2002 and 2006 of paramilitary
30:1293:89897:17:17:82:543:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:presence on the vote share of third parties. For example, column 1 estimates ^-2002= 20:97 with
30:1294:89992:17:17:82:543:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a standard error of 3.14 and a similar estimate for 2006, ^-2006= 22:10 (s.e.=3.19). Both esti-
30:1295:90087:17:17:82:543:514:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:mates are highly statistically signi\fcant and quantitatively large (the magnitudes will be discussed
30:1296:90188:17:17:82:117:497:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:below).
30:1297:90195:17:17:99:543:480:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Column 2 adds our basic covariates (the land Gini in 1985, the area of the municipality,
30:1298:90283:17:17:82:543:463:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:altitude, distance to state capital, average population between 1993 and 2005, the index of rurality,
30:1299:90384:17:17:82:543:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the index of unful\flled basic needs, dummies for coca and opium cultivation, and our measures of
30:1300:90481:17:18:82:543:429:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:right and left leanings of the municipalities), all interacted with a full set of time dummies so as
30:1301:90581:18:17:82:543:411:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to allow for di-erential e-ects over time. To save space, we do not report the coe-cients on these
30:1302:90679:17:17:82:543:394:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:time interactions. The results in column 2 are similar to those in column 1, slightly smaller, though
30:1303:90780:17:17:82:543:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:still highly signi\fcant (15.88 for 2002 and 10.79 for 2006). In column 3, we include interactions
30:1304:90878:17:17:82:543:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with guerrilla presence as well as our main interactions of paramilitary presence and time. These
30:1305:90975:17:17:82:543:343:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:interactions are insigni\fcant, consistent with the hypothesis that the left-wing guerrillas have
30:1306:91072:17:17:82:341:326:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f5:played a much more limited role in national politics.32
30:1307:91127:17:17:99:543:309:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The next three columns re-estimate the same models of the \frst three columns but now
30:1308:91212:17:17:82:543:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:using the attacks dummy as the measure of paramilitary and guerilla presence. The results are
30:1309:91305:17:17:82:543:275:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:very similar to the \frst three columns. For example, in column 4, we estimate ^-2002= 13:71
30:1310:91397:17:17:82:543:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(s.e.=1.98) and ^-2006= 14:54 (s.e.=1.99), which are again statistically highly signi\fcant. The
30:1311:91493:17:17:82:543:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:estimates in columns 5 and 6 are very similar. These estimates also clearly show the quantitative
30:1312:91590:17:17:82:543:224:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:e-ects of paramilitary involvement. They imply that high paramilitary areas have, on average,
30:1313:91683:17:17:82:543:207:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:10 percentage points higher vote share for third parties after the AUC's involvement in politics.
30:1314:91780:17:17:82:543:190:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This is a very sizable e-ect, particularly in view of the fact that the average vote share of third
30:1315:91879:17:17:82:329:173:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:parties before 2001 was about 15 percent (Table 2).
30:1316:91930:17:17:99:543:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Prior to 2002, as the coe-cients ^-1994and ^-1998illustrate there is no robust positive relation-
30:1317:92027:17:17:82:543:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ship between paramilitary presence and third party vote share. Though both of these coe-cients
30:1318:92121:17:16:82:543:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are positive and signi\fcant in column 1, their signi\fcance vanishes when we add the covariates for
30:1319:92221:16:14:91:543:106:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:32This is not because we are focusing on the vote share of third parties. When we repeat these regressions using
30:1320:92333:14:0:82:513:92:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:the vote share of the socialist coalition of parties, interactions with guerrilla presence are still insigni\fcant.
31:1321:92450:0:17:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:columns 2 and 3. In column 4 ^-1994is again positive and signi\fcant, though ^-1998is not. As with
31:1322:92548:17:17:82:543:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the attacks data in levels these coe-cients become completely insigni\fcant once the covariates
31:1323:92643:17:17:82:226:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are added in columns 5 and 6.
31:1324:92672:17:17:99:543:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:One concern with the results in columns 1-6 is that the change in the coe-cient of the time
31:1325:92763:17:17:82:543:640:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:interactions might re\rect the changing importance of paramilitaries or guerrillas in certain areas.
31:1326:92863:17:17:82:543:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our data are not ideal to investigate these issues, since the year-to-year variation in the military
31:1327:92963:17:17:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and guerrilla presence are measured with considerable error. Nevertheless, in columns 7 and 8,
31:1328:93057:17:17:82:543:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we estimate equation (8) to provide some answers to these questions. The most parsimonious
31:1329:93147:17:17:82:543:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:speci\fcation is presented in column 7. The results here are consistent with those in the \frst 6
31:1330:93244:17:17:82:543:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:columns using our time-invariant measure of paramilitary presence. The estimated coe-cients are
31:1331:93339:17:17:83:542:538:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f5:^-2002= 17:81 (s.e.=2.87) and ^-2006= 18:02 (s.e.=3.01), and are highly statistically signi\fcant.33
31:1332:93439:17:17:99:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 4 shows the results for the votes for the Congress. The general patterns and in fact even
31:1333:93534:17:17:82:543:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the point estimates are very similar to those in Table 3, with high paramilitary areas showing
31:1334:93628:17:17:82:543:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:about a 8 percentage points higher vote shares for third parties after the AUC's involvement in
31:1335:93723:17:17:82:543:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:politics.  Nevertheless, the results are weaker than in Table 3, and in column 6 where we use
31:1336:93816:17:17:82:543:453:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f5:the attacks dummy with the full set of covariates and guerilla presence neither ^-2002not ^-2006
31:1337:93912:17:17:82:543:436:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:statistically signi\fcant. Importantly, ^-1994and ^-1998are small and statistically insigni\fcant in
31:1338:94012:17:17:82:215:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:all speci\fcations in Table 4.
31:1339:94042:17:17:99:543:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 5 investigates the robustness of these results further (focusing on the votes for the
31:1340:94133:17:17:82:543:385:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Senate; the results for the Congress are similar).  In this table, all speci\fcations include the
31:1341:94230:17:17:82:543:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:time interactions with the full set of covariates introduced above, including the interactions with
31:1342:94329:17:17:82:543:351:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:guerrilla presence (which are reported in the table, while other covariates are again not reported
31:1343:94427:17:18:82:543:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to save space).  The \frst column again estimates (7), but uses the levels of displaced people
31:1344:94521:18:17:82:543:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:as the presence measure for both paramilitary and guerilla presence.  Now we see that, less
31:1345:94612:17:17:82:543:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:supportive of our hypothesis, the estimates for the interactions between all the time dummies
31:1346:94705:17:17:82:543:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and the displaced measure of paramilitary presence are statistically signi\fcant (though the point
31:1347:94803:17:17:82:543:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:estimates are di-erent because the scale of the displaced variable is di-erent). However, there
31:1348:94898:17:17:82:543:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is a large increase in the size of the coe-cient in 2002, though it halves in 2006. In column 2
31:1349:94993:17:17:82:543:231:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we use the dummy version of the displaced measure of paramilitary presence with results very
31:1350:95085:17:17:82:544:214:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:similar to those in column 1 except that now the quantitative magnitudes of ^-2002and ^-2006are
31:1351:95180:17:17:82:543:197:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:similar. Because we are now using a dummy variable for measuring paramilitary presence, the
31:1352:95271:17:17:82:543:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:quantitative e-ects can also be directly compared to those in Table 3. The estimates suggest that
31:1353:95368:17:17:82:543:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:high paramilitary areas experienced about 12 percentage points increase in the vote share of third
31:1354:95466:17:16:82:528:146:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:parties in 2002 and 2006, which is broadly consistent with the quantitative e-ects in Table 3.
31:1355:95560:16:14:91:543:130:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:33Notice that the direct e-ect of paramilitary presence is negative. We conjecture that this is because paramili-
31:1356:95673:14:11:82:543:116:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:taries appear to have had a very strong e-ect on elections in departments on the Caribbean coast, such as Magdalena,
31:1357:95789:11:11:82:543:105:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:Sucre, C-orboda and C-esar. The third parties that existed prior to 2002 were not strong in these areas, hence the
31:1358:95903:11:0:82:431:94:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:negative correlation between paramilitary presence and third party vote share in 1998.
32:1359:95991:0:17:99:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In column 3 we again use the displaced measure, but now exploit the time series variation in
32:1360:96083:17:17:82:543:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the data estimating model (8). Here the estimates are imprecise and insigni\fcant, though still
32:1361:96178:17:17:82:543:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:positive. In column 4, we use a di-erent strategy and extract the principal component of the
32:1362:96270:17:17:82:543:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:attacks and displaced measures, and use this principal component as our measure of paramilitary
32:1363:96365:17:17:82:543:640:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:presence. The advantage of this strategy is that both attacks and displaced numbers are noisy,
32:1364:96459:17:17:82:543:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:thus their common component may contain more information. The results from this approach are
32:1365:96551:17:17:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:very much in line with those of Tables 3 and 4. We \fnd no impact of paramilitary presence prior
32:1366:96647:17:17:82:543:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to 2002 but a positive and highly signi\fcant one afterwards. In column 5, we use yet another
32:1367:96740:17:17:82:543:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:strategy and construct a dummy that takes the value 1 if in our data a municipality has high
32:1368:96832:17:17:82:543:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:paramilitary presence according to both our attacks data and our displaced data (according to
32:1369:96925:17:17:82:543:538:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:this measure all areas for which we have data for displaced numbers but for which the attacks
32:1370:97018:17:17:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:data are missing receive a value of zero). We construct a similar dummy for the guerilla presence
32:1371:97115:17:17:82:543:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:measures. The results using this combined dummy are again very similar to our basic \fnding
32:1372:97206:17:17:82:543:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:though ^-1998is now statistically signi\fcant. Finally, in column 6, we estimate the model (8), but
32:1373:97305:17:17:82:543:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:now using a time-varying dummy constructed combining information from attacks and displaced
32:1374:97396:17:17:82:543:453:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:numbers as in column 5. In contrast to the imprecise results in column 3, the estimates now are
32:1375:97491:17:17:82:388:436:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:consistent with the rest of our results and are highly signi\fcant.
32:1376:97558:17:17:99:543:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A major concern for our empirical strategy is that paramilitary groups may be selecting into
32:1377:97650:17:17:82:543:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:speci\fc areas based on their political or ideological characteristics; paramilitary presence may be
32:1378:97750:17:17:82:543:385:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:capturing a trend towards third parties unrelated to the paramilitaries' involvement in politics
32:1379:97846:17:17:82:543:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(this has to be a trend, since all speci\fcations include a full set of municipality \fxed e-ects).
32:1380:97945:17:17:82:543:351:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:For example, there might be a trend in `conservative ideology' in certain areas, and the increased
32:1381:98043:17:18:82:543:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:vote share of third parties is a re\rection of this trend in the areas where they have situated.
32:1382:98139:18:17:82:543:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:While we cannot rule out this alternative explanation for the patterns shown in Tables 3-5, we
32:1383:98233:17:17:82:543:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:do not \fnd it very plausible. First, the speci\fcations with covariates \rexibly control for potential
32:1384:98336:17:17:82:543:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:di-erential trends in `right-wing ideology' by interacting the vote share of-Alvaro G-omez in the
32:1385:98433:17:17:82:543:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1986 Presidential election with a full set of time dummies (as well as for potential di-erential
32:1386:98529:17:17:82:543:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:trends in `left-wing ideology'). Remarkably, this has almost no e-ect on the estimates. Second,
32:1387:98624:17:17:82:438:231:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the case study evidence discussed in Section 3 supports our interpretation.
32:1388:98699:17:17:99:543:214:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Overall, Tables 3-5 provide robust correlations consistent with our basic hypothesis that fol-
32:1389:98793:17:17:82:543:197:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:lowing the AUC's decision to become involved in politics, paramilitaries have systematically in-
32:1390:98889:17:17:82:543:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:\ruenced electoral outcomes. The next two subsections provide further evidence consistent with
32:1391:98983:17:29:82:141:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:this pattern.
32:1392:98996:29:24:82:452:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:5.2  Results on Electoral Concentration: Senate and Congress
32:1393:99056:24:17:82:543:110:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Motivated by the case study evidence from Magdalena, discussed in the Appendix, we hypothesize
32:1394:99150:17:0:82:543:93:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that paramilitary involvement also translated into greaterelectoral concentration(greater vote
33:1395:99246:0:17:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:share for the winning list in the Senate and Congress elections). Table 6 investigates this issue
33:1396:99343:17:17:82:543:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by estimating regressions similar to (7) and (8), with the dependent variable being the vote share
33:1397:99441:17:17:82:543:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the most popular list in either the Senate or the Congress in municipalitymat timet. For
33:1398:99532:17:17:82:543:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:these regressions, we again have data from 1991 to 2006. Throughout, we focus on the attacks
33:1399:99624:17:17:82:543:640:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:measure to save space (the results with the displaced measured are very similar and are available
33:1400:99721:17:17:82:151:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:upon request).
33:1401:99735:17:17:99:543:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The \frst six columns in Table 6 use data from the Senate, while the last six are for the
33:1402:99824:17:17:82:543:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Congress. Each of these sets of columns is broken down into three sets of two which use \frst the
33:1403:99921:17:17:82:543:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:attacks data in levels, then the attacks dummy for high paramilitary and guerilla presence, and
33:1404:100016:17:17:82:543:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:\fnally the time varying attacks dummy. All columns include the full set of covariates (interacted
33:1405:100114:17:17:82:239:538:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with a full set of time dummies).
33:1406:100147:17:17:99:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This table shows no di-erential trend in electoral concentration between high and low paramil-
33:1407:100241:17:17:82:543:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:itary areas before 2002. There is also no di-erential trend at any point between high and low
33:1408:100334:17:17:82:543:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:guerrilla areas. There is a large spike in electoral concentration in 2002 in high paramilitary areas,
33:1409:100436:17:17:82:543:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:which is visible in columns 1-4 and 7-10. This e-ect disappears in 2006, and is not visible or is
33:1410:100533:17:17:82:543:453:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:only imprecisely estimated in speci\fcations that use the time-varying measures (the regression
33:1411:100628:17:17:82:543:436:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:equation (8), cfr. columns 5, 6, 11 and 12). The quantitative e-ects in 2002 are large, correspond-
33:1412:100727:17:17:82:543:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ing to about a 4-5 percentage points increase in the vote share of the winning candidate (list).
33:1413:100823:17:17:82:543:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This is again a very large e-ect, as the vote share of the winning list in Senate and Congress
33:1414:100917:17:17:82:295:385:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:elections was around 30 percent before 2001.
33:1415:100961:17:17:99:543:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:An obvious question is why there is no di-erential e-ect on electoral concentration in high
33:1416:101052:17:17:82:543:351:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:paramilitary areas in 2006. The answer to this question is suggested by our discussion of the
33:1417:101145:17:18:82:543:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:evidence from Magdalena in the Appendix and by the arguments advanced by Valencia (2007)
33:1418:101233:18:17:82:543:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and L-opez (2007): after the experience of 2002, which was subsequently highly scrutinized in
33:1419:101326:17:17:82:543:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:places such as Magdalena, paramilitaries became much more skilled at manipulating the outcomes
33:1420:101420:17:17:82:543:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in order to guarantee the election of their candidates without drawing so much attention to
33:1421:101511:17:17:82:543:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:themselves. As we show in the Appendix, even if electoral concentration fell in Magdalena in
33:1422:101603:17:17:82:543:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2006, Senators supported by the paramilitaries were re-elected and with a rather similar number
33:1423:101698:17:17:82:543:231:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of votes, but now spread more evenly throughout the department. Indeed, recalling the evidence
33:1424:101792:17:17:82:543:214:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of Table 1, the presence in the legislature after 2006 of so many Senators and Congressmen
33:1425:101882:17:17:82:543:197:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:either under investigation or arrested for connections with paramilitaries is direct evidence of a
33:1426:101980:17:17:82:543:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:continuing impact of the paramilitaries on elections. This interpretation is also supported by the
33:1427:102078:17:17:82:543:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:evidence presented in the previous subsection (Tables 3-5), which showed the robust association
33:1428:102173:17:17:82:543:146:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:between paramilitary presence and the rise of third parties in the elections of both 2002 and
33:1429:102266:17:17:82:543:129:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2006. Had the e-ect of the paramilitaries on the electoral outcomes weakened in 2006, we would
33:1430:102360:17:17:82:543:112:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:have seen this in a decline in the vote share of third parties. The results from the votes for the
33:1431:102458:17:0:82:479:95:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:executive, presented in the next subsection, further corroborate this interpretation.
34:1432:102545:0:24:82:262:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:5.3  Results for the Executive
34:1433:102575:24:17:82:543:684:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 7 presents estimates from regression models similar to (7) and (8) for the period 1998-2006,
34:1434:102673:17:17:82:543:667:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:withym;tde\fned as the share of votes of the winning Presidential candidate in municipalitymat
34:1435:102767:17:17:82:543:650:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:timet. Once again we focus on the attacks measure (the results with the displaced measure are
34:1436:102860:17:17:82:543:633:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:again very similar). The basic robust \fnding is that in both 2002 and in 2006 the vote share of the
34:1437:102960:17:17:82:543:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:winning candidate (-Alvaro Uribe) was systematically higher in high paramilitary areas than the
34:1438:103055:17:17:82:543:599:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:vote share of the winning candidate in 1998 (Pastrana); this e-ect is in fact considerably stronger
34:1439:103154:17:17:82:543:582:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in 2006. For example, the estimate in column 4, 11.45 (s.e. = 1.67) suggests that Uribe obtained
34:1440:103250:17:17:82:543:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:about 11 percentage points more votes in high paramilitary areas than Pastrana did. The same
34:1441:103342:17:17:82:543:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:e-ect is present in models that exploit the time-varying measures of paramilitary presence (models
34:1442:103440:17:17:82:129:531:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:as in (8)).
34:1443:103451:17:17:99:543:514:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The pattern with a stronger e-ect in 2006 is plausible.  President Uribe was favored by
34:1444:103538:17:17:82:543:497:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:paramilitary groups already in 2002, but after his support for policies in line with these groups'
34:1445:103636:17:17:82:543:480:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:interests during his \frst term, the support of the paramilitary groups for his election became
34:1446:103731:17:17:82:543:463:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:much stronger. This pattern is thus consistent both with the notion that paramilitaries continued
34:1447:103828:17:17:82:543:446:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to heavily in\ruence elections after 2002, and also with the hypothesis, documented further below,
34:1448:103926:17:18:82:543:429:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that a symbiotic relationship between the executive and the paramilitaries developed after certain
34:1449:104024:18:17:82:257:411:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f5:key legislations proposed by Uribe.34
34:1450:104061:17:17:99:543:394:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The evidence in this subsection is also particularly important since it suggests that, consistent
34:1451:104158:17:17:82:543:377:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with the assumptions of our theoretical model, the executive, President Uribe, electorally bene\fted
34:1452:104258:17:29:82:260:360:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f5:from the presence of paramilitaries.35
34:1453:104296:29:24:82:221:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:5.4  Predicting Arrests
34:1454:104319:24:17:82:543:307:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:As noted in the Introduction, since the so called `Parapol--tica' scandal \frst broke in Colombia,
34:1455:104417:17:17:82:543:290:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:many Congressmen and Senators have been investigated, arrested for and even found guilty of links
34:1456:104514:17:17:82:543:273:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with illegal paramilitary organizations. A useful `reality check' on whether the evidence reported
34:1457:104612:17:17:82:543:256:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:so far indeed represents the in\ruence of paramilitaries on election outcomes is to see whether
34:1458:104707:17:16:82:543:239:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Senators elected in areas under paramilitary control have explicit links with the paramilitaries
34:1459:104803:16:15:91:543:223:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:34Nevertheless, as always, there may be other interpretations of this \fnding. For instance, to the extent that
34:1460:104914:15:10:82:543:208:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:President Uribe had been successful in de-mobilizing the paramilitaries, then people who had previously su-ered
34:1461:105025:10:11:82:543:198:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:under them might have rewarded the President by supporting his bid for re-election. Although we cannot rule out
34:1462:105136:11:11:82:543:187:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:this alternative explanation, the case study evidence is more consistent with our proposed interpretation and with
34:1463:105250:11:8:82:203:176:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:the implications of our model.
34:1464:105280:8:14:91:543:168:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:35In May 2008, somewhat surprisingly given his insistence that paramilitary crimes should not be extraditable,
34:1465:105390:14:11:82:543:154:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:President Uribe extradited 14 paramilitary leaders, including Salvatore Mancuso, Jorge 40 and Don Berna. Our
34:1466:105498:11:11:82:543:143:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:model gives two ways to think about this. First, the more popular President Uribe is with the general population,
34:1467:105611:11:11:82:543:132:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:the less he needs the paramilitaries. It may therefore not be a coincidence that the extraditions took place soon
34:1468:105724:11:11:82:543:121:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:after the killing by the military of FARC senior cadre, Ra-ul Reyes, which was hugely popular in Colombia. Second,
34:1469:105838:11:11:82:543:110:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:it is possible that the paramilitary leaders began to develop national political aspirations, which our model suggests
34:1470:105956:11:0:82:234:99:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:would make Uribe turn against them.
35:1471:105993:0:17:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and have voted for legislation favoring paramilitary interests. In this subsection, we investigate the
35:1472:106095:17:17:82:543:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:presence of explicit links, exploiting the fact that Colombian judiciary, particularly the Supreme
35:1473:106193:17:17:82:543:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Court, is broadly independent and has prosecuted politicians with links with the paramilitaries.
35:1474:106289:17:17:82:434:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The voting behavior of these Senators is discussed in the next subsection.
35:1475:106363:17:17:99:543:640:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We adopt a simple empirical strategy to measure the extent to which Senators relied on the
35:1476:106453:17:17:82:543:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:support of paramilitaries for their election. First, we de\fne!lPto be the proportion of total vote
35:1477:106552:17:17:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that Senate listlreceives in municipalities with high paramilitary presence, where we measure high
35:1478:106650:17:17:82:543:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:paramilitary presence by using our dummy variable constructed from our time-invariant measure
35:1479:106743:17:17:82:543:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of paramilitary presence. Similarly we de\fne!lGas the proportion of total vote that listlreceives
35:1480:106841:17:17:82:543:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in municipalities with high guerilla presence, where high guerilla presence is measured in the same
35:1481:106940:17:17:82:543:538:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:way as paramilitary presence. To investigate the links between Senators and paramilitaries, we
35:1482:107034:17:17:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:look at Senators who are arrested for connections with paramilitary groups. We de\fne -las
35:1483:107124:17:17:82:543:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the proportion of the Senators of listlthat have been arrested for alleged connections with
35:1484:107215:17:28:82:266:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:paramilitary groups and then estimate
35:1485:107252:28:27:227:543:459:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:-l=--!l;P+--!l;G+X0l--+"l:(9)
35:1486:107281:27:17:82:543:432:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Based on our hypothesis that Senators and Congressmen receiving a high fraction of their votes
35:1487:107375:17:17:82:543:415:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in paramilitary areas have explicit connections with paramilitaries, we expect to \fnd- >0. In
35:1488:107469:17:17:82:543:398:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the covariate vectorX0lwe also use party identity.  Though, in general, this is an example of
35:1489:107562:17:17:82:543:381:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:`bad control' (Angrist and Pischke, 2009, pp. 64-68), since being a member of a third party is
35:1490:107656:17:17:82:543:364:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:an outcome variable inbetween the causal variable of interest,!l;P, and the outcome variable,
35:1491:107749:17:17:82:544:347:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:-l, in this case we include it to examine whether being a member of a third party absorbs all of
35:1492:107845:17:17:82:543:330:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the explanatory power of!l;P(thus acting as the channel through which paramilitary presence is
35:1493:107939:17:17:82:286:313:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:impacting politician behavior and arrests).
35:1494:107982:17:17:99:543:296:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 8 shows the results from estimating (9).  In column 1, we look at the relationship
35:1495:108070:17:17:82:543:279:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:between arrests and party identity. As we saw above, there is a close correspondence between
35:1496:108162:17:17:82:543:262:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:paramilitary presence and the rise of third parties. Column 1 con\frms this, showing that third
35:1497:108257:17:17:82:543:245:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:party Senators are signi\fcantly more likely to be arrested for links with the paramilitaries than
35:1498:108355:17:17:82:432:228:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Liberals, Conservatives and Socialists (liberals are the omitted category).
35:1499:108430:17:17:99:543:211:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In the next three columns, columns 2-4, we present estimates of (9) for the Senate. Column 2 is
35:1500:108525:17:17:82:543:194:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the most parsimonious speci\fcation where we regress the proportion of Senators on a list who were
35:1501:108623:17:17:82:543:177:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:arrested on!l;Pand!l;G. We see that ^-= 1:38 (standard error=0.42) is statistically signi\fcant
35:1502:108718:17:17:82:543:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:suggesting that the higher the share of its votes that a list obtained in paramilitary areas, the
35:1503:108815:17:17:82:543:143:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:greater is the proportion of Senators on the list who are arrested for links with paramilitaries. In
35:1504:108915:17:17:82:543:126:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:column 3 we add as a covariate the proportion of its vote share that the list obtained in `right-
35:1505:109012:17:17:82:543:109:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:leaning' and `left-leaning' areas.36Neither of these controls are signi\fcant in themselves and they
35:1506:109112:17:0:91:543:92:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:36We de\fne the `right-leaning' and `left-leaning' dummies again by looking at the vote shares of-Alvaro G-omez and
36:1507:109229:0:17:82:287:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:do not in\ruence the coe-cients of interest.
36:1508:109273:17:17:99:543:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In column 4 we then add the party dummies to investigate whether the entire e-ect of the
36:1509:109361:17:17:82:543:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:paramilitaries is working through third parties. The estimates show that this is not the case.
36:1510:109455:17:17:82:543:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The third party dummy is still signi\fcant, but so is the share of votes from paramilitary areas.
36:1511:109552:17:17:82:543:640:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This suggests that the only channel of in\ruence of paramilitaries on politicians behavior is not
36:1512:109649:17:17:82:543:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:through third party a-liation (which, in hindsight, is not surprising, since in several municipali-
36:1513:109748:17:17:82:392:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ties, paramilitaries supported liberal or conservative candidates).
36:1514:109815:17:17:99:543:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The next four columns report estimates of (9) for the Congress. These are broadly consistent
36:1515:109907:17:17:82:543:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with the results for the Senate; the proportion of the votes that a list won in high paramilitary
36:1516:110004:17:17:82:543:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:areas is positively correlated with the proportion of Congressmen on that list who have been
36:1517:110096:17:17:82:538:538:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:arrested, though the results are typically somewhat less precisely estimated and less signi\fcant.
36:1518:110194:17:17:99:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Overall, these results are important \frstly because they provide some veri\fcation that our
36:1519:110286:17:17:82:543:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:strategy for measuring the e-ects of the paramilitaries is indeed capturing what they are supposed
36:1520:110384:17:17:82:543:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to. Secondly, they also show that our \fndings so far are unlikely to be driven by some omitted
36:1521:110479:17:17:82:543:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:characteristic of municipalities (making paramilitary presence `endogenous' to voters' preferences).
36:1522:110579:17:17:82:543:453:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The fact that paramilitary presence is positively correlated with arrests suggests that there is
36:1523:110675:17:17:82:543:436:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:indeed a close relationship between paramilitaries and politicians such that paramilitary groups are
36:1524:110775:17:17:82:543:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:either forming a coalition with local politicians, or are themselves running as candidates. In either
36:1525:110876:17:17:82:543:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:case, it seems highly unlikely that politicians, particularly politicians elected in high paramilitary
36:1526:110978:17:17:82:543:385:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:areas, are perfect agents of voters, supporting policies in line with their interests.  Instead, it
36:1527:111077:17:30:82:520:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:seems that these politicians are pursuing policies systematically preferred by paramilitaries.
36:1528:111171:30:24:82:234:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:5.5  Voting in the Senate
36:1529:111196:24:17:82:543:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:As a \fnal demonstration of the potential in\ruence of the paramilitaries on elections, we examine
36:1530:111294:17:17:82:543:297:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:whether Senators from lists that received large shares of their votes in paramilitary areas vote in
36:1531:111393:17:17:82:543:280:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:systematically di-erent ways. We do this in the very speci\fc but revealing context of a roll-call
36:1532:111491:17:17:82:543:263:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:vote to re-introduce two clauses of the Justice and Peace Law.  These were Article 70, which
36:1533:111583:17:17:82:543:246:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:stipulated a 10% reduction in the sentences of demobilized paramilitaries who had been charged
36:1534:111677:17:17:82:543:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:at the time of the passing of the law and Article 71, which speci\fed that the crimes of former
36:1535:111772:17:17:82:543:212:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:paramilitaries should be considered as `sedition'.37The main signi\fcance of sedition is that it
36:1536:111868:17:17:82:543:195:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:would imply that the paramilitaries had committed political crimes and would therefore not be
36:1537:111961:17:20:82:543:178:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:eligible to extradition.38These two articles were part of a \frst draft of the law presented by the
36:1538:112060:20:11:82:543:158:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:Jaime Pardo Leal in 1986; then, similar to the construction of the dummies for paramilitary and guerrilla presence,
36:1539:112175:11:10:82:543:147:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:we constructed dummy variables for `right-leaning' and `left-leaning' areas depending on whether a municipality is
36:1540:112289:10:8:82:487:137:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:above the 75th percentile of votes for the corresponding candidate in the 1986 presidential elections.
36:1541:112391:8:14:91:543:129:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:37At the time of the votes these clauses were actually Article 61 (sentence reduction) and Article 64 (sedition)
36:1542:112503:14:8:82:216:115:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:but this changed in the \fnal law.
36:1543:112537:8:14:91:543:107:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:38This is a topic with a long and contested history in Colombia. During the writing of the 1991 Constitution,
36:1544:112646:14:0:82:543:93:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:Pablo Escobar systematically tried to intimidate delegates in order to make sure that the new Constitution made
37:1545:112759:0:17:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:President but they were both rejected in the \frst commissions of the Senate and the Congress.
37:1546:112853:17:17:82:543:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The rejection of these two articles was then appealed in the Senate. In response to this appeal
37:1547:112948:17:17:82:543:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a commission was formed to inform the Senate on how to proceed with the appeal pleading.
37:1548:113036:17:17:82:543:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The members of the commission were Mario Uribe (under arrest in 2008 for connections with
37:1549:113125:17:17:82:543:640:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:paramilitaries and a cousin of President Uribe), Mauricio Pimiento (arrested and found guilty,
37:1550:113219:17:17:82:543:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:see Table 1), Juan G-omez, Miguel de la Espriella (arrested and found guilty, see Table A1), Jes-us
37:1551:113318:17:17:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Carrizosa, and Hernando Escobar. The members of the commission concluded that the appeal
37:1552:113406:17:17:82:543:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:had to be approved by the plenary of the Senate which it was and we have the roll-call for this
37:1553:113501:17:17:82:542:572:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f5:vote. This vote went in favor of re-introducing the two articles into the Justice and Peace law.39
37:1554:113599:17:17:99:543:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:To the extent that there is a positive correlation between the proportion of votes a list received
37:1555:113697:17:17:82:543:538:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in paramilitary areas and the proportion of Senators on the list who voted to re-introduce these
37:1556:113793:17:17:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:two articles, this would be further evidence that paramilitaries have indeed in\ruenced election
37:1557:113889:17:17:82:543:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:outcomes, consistent with Proposition 2 of our model. Implicitly, it is also evidence of the `quid
37:1558:113987:17:17:82:478:487:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f5:pro quo' between paramilitaries and the executive, consistent with Proposition 4.40
37:1559:114070:17:17:99:543:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:To examine the impact of the paramilitaries on these roll-call votes, we estimate versions of
37:1560:114163:17:17:82:543:453:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:model (9) in the previous sub-section. More speci\fcally we now de\fne -lto be the proportion of
37:1561:114259:17:17:82:543:436:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Senators on listlthat voted in favor of re-introducing these two clauses. The results are reported
37:1562:114357:17:17:82:212:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in columns 9-12 of Table 8.
37:1563:114384:17:17:99:543:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Column 9 shows that senators from third parties and the conservatives are most likely to
37:1564:114472:17:17:82:543:385:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:support the re-introduction of the two controversial articles of the Justice and Peace Law. The
37:1565:114567:17:17:82:543:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:fact that conservatives were as likely as third party candidates to support these clauses is probably
37:1566:114668:17:17:82:543:351:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:related to the fact that in the Senate they were also allied with President Uribe. The remaining
37:1567:114764:17:18:82:543:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:columns show a positive signi\fcant correlation between paramilitary presence in areas where a list
37:1568:114863:18:17:82:543:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:got a large proportion of its votes and the proportion of Senators who voted in favor of making
37:1569:114958:17:17:82:543:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the Peace and Justice Law more `pro-paramilitary'. (This e-ect is no longer signi\fcant in column
37:1570:115055:17:17:82:543:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:12 when we introduce the party identity variables, suggesting that a large part of the e-ect is
37:1571:115150:17:17:82:543:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:working through third party a-liation). Third party identity is again positive and signi\fcant.
37:1572:115245:17:17:82:543:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Note also that in none of the speci\fcations is there any e-ect of guerilla presence or right or left
37:1573:115346:17:17:82:543:231:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:orientation on these votes. Overall, we interpret this as evidence in support of our hypothesis
37:1574:115441:17:17:82:543:214:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that politicians receiving support from paramilitaries have in turn supported legislation in line
37:1575:115538:17:19:82:244:197:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with the interests of these groups.
37:1576:115573:19:11:82:543:178:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:extradition unconstitutional. The day after this was written into the Constitution, Pablo Escobar, who had been
37:1577:115684:11:11:82:543:167:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:in hiding, gave himself up to the authorities.  However, the Constitution was subsequently amended to allow
37:1578:115791:11:7:82:129:156:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:extradition.
37:1579:115803:7:15:91:543:149:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:39However the Supreme Court said that paramilitaries cannot be considered as seditious. So article 71 is currently
37:1580:115917:15:11:82:543:134:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:not being applied. Interestingly, even though President Uribe supported this clause, he then extradited 14 of the
37:1581:116030:11:7:82:259:123:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:paramilitary leaders as we discussed earlier.
37:1582:116075:7:15:91:543:116:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:40As we discussed in Section 3, a large literature has heavily criticized the Justice and Peace Law as being very
37:1583:116188:15:11:82:543:101:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:weak and not forcing ex-combatants to account for their crimes or provide any sort of compensation for their
37:1584:116296:11:0:82:320:90:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:victims. The structure of the law came from the executive.

38:1587:116485:17:17:82:543:663:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:systematic e-ects on elections in Colombia, we now turn to two predictions of our theoretical
38:1588:116578:17:17:82:543:646:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:model.  First, the model suggests that to the extent that paramilitaries deliver votes to the
38:1589:116671:17:17:82:543:629:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:President, the President will have a greater incentive to allow them to stay in control of the areas
38:1590:116771:17:17:82:543:612:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:where they are. Second, this e-ect will be stronger in places which President Uribe did not expect
38:1591:116869:17:17:82:336:595:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to do well without intervention by the paramilitaries.
38:1592:116923:17:17:99:543:578:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We focus on the 2002 Presidential election and the subsequent persistence of paramilitaries.
38:1593:117015:17:17:82:543:561:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We restrict attention to only municipalities that had paramilitary presence in 2000-2001.  A
38:1594:117107:17:17:82:543:544:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:municipality is classi\fed as having paramilitary presence if it experienced any paramilitary related
38:1595:117208:17:17:82:543:527:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:incidents (attacks or displacement depending on the measure used) during either 2000 or 2001.
38:1596:117301:17:17:82:543:510:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We use a time varying measure of paramilitary presence to capture presence before the election,
38:1597:117396:17:17:82:543:493:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:denotedPm;t<2002, and presence after the election, denotedPm;t>2002. In our baseline speci\fcation
38:1598:117494:17:17:82:543:476:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:this is measured as the sum of either attacks or displacements during a two-year window, the
38:1599:117586:17:17:82:543:459:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:periods 2000 and 2001 (t<2002) or between 2004 and 2005 (t>2002) in either case divided by
38:1600:117676:17:17:82:543:442:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the population of the municipality. Our results are robust to di-erent ways of measuring these
38:1601:117770:17:17:82:543:425:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:variables as we show.  We can use this variable to explicitly examine how the persistence of
38:1602:117862:17:17:82:543:408:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:paramilitary presence depends on the extent of voting for President Uribe, thus testing the \frst
38:1603:117959:17:17:82:543:391:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:prediction. To test the second implication of the model we argue that even though when Uribe
38:1604:118051:17:17:82:543:374:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:was Governor of Antioquia he was nominally a representative of the Liberal Party, in fact his key
38:1605:118148:17:17:82:543:357:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:supporters, in the absence of coercion, were conservative voters who liked his emphasis on law
38:1606:118242:17:17:82:543:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and order. Direct evidence comes from the fact that the Conservative Party chose not to run
38:1607:118333:17:17:82:543:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a candidate against him either in 2002 or 2006, while the Liberal Party did (Horacio Serpa in
38:1608:118426:17:17:82:543:306:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:both cases). As a consequence, Uribe could anticipate doing well in places where Conservative
38:1609:118519:17:17:82:543:289:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:President Andr-es Pastrana had received a high vote share in 1998. We can therefore test the
38:1610:118611:17:17:82:499:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:second hypothesis by interacting Pastrana's vote share in 1998 with Uribe's vote share.
38:1611:118698:17:28:99:329:255:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:More formally, we estimate the following model:
38:1612:118745:28:28:98:543:227:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:Pm;t>2002=--Pm;t<2002+\f-vum;2002+\r-vum;2002-vpm;1998+--vpm;1998+X0m--+"m(10)
38:1613:118823:28:17:82:543:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:wherevum;2002is the vote share of President Uribe in municipalitymin 2002 andvpm;1998is the vote
38:1614:118919:17:17:82:543:182:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:share of Pastrana in 1998. Our model predicts that\f >0 (a greater share of votes for Uribe would
38:1615:119016:17:17:82:543:165:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:lead to greater paramilitary presence after 2002), and\r <0|so that the higher was Pastrana's
38:1616:119109:17:17:82:543:148:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:vote share in 1998, the less Uribe would bene\ft from the support of the paramilitaries and thus
38:1617:119205:17:17:82:515:131:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:according to our theoretical model, the more likely are the paramilitaries to be eliminated.
38:1618:119297:17:17:99:543:114:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:An alternative measure of the paramilitary-induced vote advantage of Uribe, which is more
38:1619:119386:17:0:82:543:97:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:closely related to the predictions of Proposition 3, is to de\fne the variable maxf0; vum;2002-vpm;1998g,
39:1620:119493:0:17:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:which directly captures the vote advantage of Uribe in 2002 relative to Pastrana's vote in 1998,
39:1621:119589:17:17:82:543:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:if any (in municipalitym). With the same reasoning, we expect the coe-cient on this variable to
39:1622:119684:17:17:82:543:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:be positive|the greater isvum;2002-vpm;1998, the more Uribe gained relative to Pastrana and the
39:1623:119779:17:17:82:309:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:more we would expect paramilitaries to persist.
39:1624:119826:17:17:99:543:640:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The results from estimating various versions of (10) are shown in Table 9. Throughout this
39:1625:119916:17:17:82:543:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:table and the next where we examine robustness, all of the main e-ects are evaluated at the sample
39:1626:120014:17:17:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:means to facilitate interpretation. The \frst six columns of Table 9 use theattacksmeasure non-
39:1627:120109:17:17:82:543:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:state armed actor presence, while the next four use thedisplacedmeasure. The \fnal two use the
39:1628:120203:17:17:82:324:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:\frst principal component of attacks and displaced.
39:1629:120254:17:17:99:543:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The results are broadly consistent with our model, in particular, with the predictions of
39:1630:120343:17:17:82:543:538:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Proposition 3.  In column 1 of Table 9 we estimate the simplest version of (10).  Consistent
39:1631:120435:17:17:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with these predictions, the estimate of Uribe's vote share of value to the sample mean,\f, is
39:1632:120528:17:17:82:543:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:estimated at 0:14 (with a standard error=0.08). This estimate, which is marginally signi\fcant,
39:1633:120623:17:17:82:543:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:suggests that other things equal, the greater the vote share for President Uribe in the 2002
39:1634:120715:17:17:82:543:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:election in municipalitym, the greater the paramilitary presence in the municipality after 2002.
39:1635:120811:17:17:82:543:453:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Quantitatively this is a sizable, though not implausible, e-ect implying that a 10% increase in
39:1636:120906:17:17:82:543:436:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Uribe's vote share in an average municipality under paramilitary control will increase paramilitary
39:1637:121005:17:17:82:543:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:presence by 0.014. This is a large e-ect compared to the mean of paramilitary presence in the
39:1638:121098:17:17:82:543:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:whole sample, which is 0.04, though smaller for the mean when we restrict attention to only those
39:1639:121195:17:17:82:435:385:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f5:municipalities which had positive paramilitary presence, this being 0.15.41
39:1640:121270:17:17:99:543:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Moreover, again consistent with the predictions of Proposition 3, the coe-cient on the in-
39:1641:121360:17:17:82:543:351:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:teraction between Uribe's and Pastrana's vote shares is negative and statistically signi\fcant at
39:1642:121457:17:18:82:543:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:5%, ^\r=-0:63 (standard error=0.33). This implies that, all else equal, paramilitaries were more
39:1643:121553:18:17:82:543:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:likely to persist in areas where President Uribe received a high share of votes,andon the basis
39:1644:121648:17:17:82:543:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the votes of President Pastrana in the 1998 election, he would have been expected to receive a
39:1645:121745:17:17:82:543:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:lower vote share. Column 2 adds covariates to the basic model of Column 1 while Column 3 adds
39:1646:121838:17:17:82:543:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:controls for guerilla presence in 2000-2001. In these columns, the interaction term remains nega-
39:1647:121935:17:17:82:543:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tive and has a similar quantitative magnitudes to that in Column 1, but is no longer statistically
39:1648:122033:17:17:82:543:231:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:signi\fcant (in several other speci\fcations in this and the next table, the interaction term is again
39:1649:122135:17:17:82:138:214:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:signi\fcant).
39:1650:122148:17:17:99:543:197:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Column 4 reports a regression model more directly inspired by Proposition 3, which makes the
39:1651:122240:17:17:82:543:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:persistence of paramilitaries a function of the vote gain of President Uribe relative to President

39:1653:122438:17:17:82:502:146:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in column 3 (coe-cient = 0.25, s.e. = 0.15), consistent with our theoretical predictions.
39:1654:122527:17:16:99:543:129:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In Columns 5 and 6, we use the logarithms of all of the variables so we lose a lot of observa-
39:1655:122621:16:14:91:543:113:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:41Since this is the e-ect at the sample mean and\r<0, the impact of Uribe's vote share is signi\fcantly higher
39:1656:122731:14:0:82:259:99:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:in municipalities with lower Pastrana share.

40:1658:122874:17:17:82:543:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is not signi\fcant, but the interaction term is negative and highly signi\fcant (this speci\fcation
40:1659:122973:17:17:82:543:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:also includes guerrilla presence before 2002 as in Column 3). In Column 6, the coe-cient on

40:1661:123161:17:17:82:148:640:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:error = 0.30).
40:1662:123175:17:17:99:543:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The next four columns examine the same models using the displaced measure of paramilitary
40:1663:123264:17:17:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and guerilla presence. In all of these speci\fcations the direct e-ect of Uribe's vote share is positive
40:1664:123368:17:17:82:543:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and highly signi\fcant. The interaction term is also always negative, and statistically signi\fcant
40:1665:123467:17:17:82:543:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f9:with levels, but not with logs. Moreover, when we use the speci\fcation with maxf0; vum;2002-
40:1666:123560:17:17:82:381:555:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:vpm;1998g, the estimated e-ect is positive and highly signi\fcant.
40:1667:123626:17:17:99:543:538:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The \fnal two columns use the \frst principal components of attacks and displaced.  These
40:1668:123715:17:17:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:results are similar, and in fact more supportive of the predictions of our model. The direct e-ect
40:1669:123813:17:17:82:543:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of Uribe's vote share evaluated at the sample mean is positive and statistically signi\fcant, and the
40:1670:123914:17:17:82:543:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:interaction term is negative and signi\fcant. In this speci\fcation using maxf0; vum;2002-vpm;1998g,
40:1671:124014:17:17:82:543:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the results are now much more precisely estimated and the coe-cient on this table is now highly

40:1673:124121:17:17:99:543:436:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 10 investigates the robustness of the basic results in Table 9. In particular, it uses a
40:1674:124215:17:17:82:544:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:two-year window instead of the three-year window in Table 9 (that is, we de\fnePm;t<2002and

40:1676:124396:17:17:82:543:385:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:case divided by the population of the municipality). The results are broadly similar to those in
40:1677:124492:17:17:82:543:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 9. In particular, the interaction term is now more precisely estimated and is statistically
40:1678:124589:17:17:82:263:351:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:signi\fcant in almost all speci\fcations.
40:1679:124630:17:18:99:543:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Overall, we interpret the results in this section as providing some support to our Proposition

40:1681:124823:17:17:82:543:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:where these groups deliver votes and that this e-ect is stronger where they would not have

40:1688:125227:17:17:82:543:147:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:more likely to survive. To investigate this symbiotic relationship, or the `quid pro quo,' more
40:1689:125322:17:17:82:543:130:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:extensively, it is useful to study key legislation the executive brought to the legislature, and how
40:1690:125422:17:17:82:543:113:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:paramilitary presence may have in\ruenced voting on these legislations. We can only examine the
40:1691:125517:17:0:82:543:96:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:\frst issue, what laws the executive proposed, using case study evidence. To look at the second
41:1692:125614:0:17:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:issue, how paramilitary presence may have in\ruenced voting patterns, we again examine roll-call
41:1693:125710:17:17:82:109:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:votes.
41:1694:125716:17:17:99:543:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We focus on a very salient and relevant roll-call for which we have data: the vote on whether or
41:1695:125812:17:17:82:543:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:not to change the Constitution to drop the single-period term limit on the President. If Senators
41:1696:125909:17:17:82:543:640:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:who were elected with support from paramilitaries were more inclined to support this change
41:1697:126000:17:17:82:543:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the Constitution, then this would be direct, though naturally not de\fnitive, evidence that
41:1698:126094:17:17:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the paramilitaries supported Uribe either as quid pro quo or because he would naturally choose
41:1699:126188:17:17:82:352:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:policies more in line with their interests and preferences.
41:1700:126247:17:17:99:543:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:As in our previous analysis of roll-call votes we use a simple empirical strategy based on
41:1701:126337:17:17:82:543:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:equation (9) in subsections 5.4 and 5.5. We now de\fne -lto be the proportion of Senators on list
41:1702:126434:17:17:82:543:538:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f2:lthat voted in favor of changing the Constitution to allow President Uribe to run for re-election.
41:1703:126532:17:17:82:329:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:All of the remaining variables are de\fned as before.
41:1704:126585:17:17:99:543:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 11 looks at the roll-call vote for re-election. The structure of this table is similar to that
41:1705:126685:17:17:82:543:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of Table 8, except that the two parts of the table now use the attacks and displaced measures. The
41:1706:126783:17:17:82:543:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:\frst column again estimates a simple regression of -lon party dummies. It shows that members
41:1707:126876:17:17:82:543:453:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of third parties tended to vote in favor of re-election, as did Conservatives, while members of Left
41:1708:126976:17:17:82:543:436:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:parties tended to vote against (all relative to Liberals). Columns 2-4 then use the simple model
41:1709:127072:17:17:82:543:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(9) with the attacks data, while 5-7 estimate the same model using the displaced data. Using
41:1710:127164:17:17:82:543:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:either strategy, and even holding party a-liation constant, there is a robust positive e-ect of the
41:1711:127263:17:17:82:543:385:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:presence of paramilitaries in areas where Senate lists received a high vote share on the propensity
41:1712:127362:17:17:82:543:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of Senators on the list to vote in favor of changing the Constitution to allow President Uribe to
41:1713:127459:17:17:82:543:351:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:run again. This e-ect is statistically signi\fcant in all columns, except in column 7 where we also
41:1714:127558:17:18:82:543:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:include party identity (this suggests that in this instance most of the e-ects of paramilitaries on
41:1715:127657:18:17:82:543:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:politicians behavior might be working through third party a-liation). These columns also again
41:1716:127751:17:17:82:543:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:show that there is no robust impact of the presence of guerillas on the voting behavior of Senators
41:1717:127850:17:29:82:160:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on this measure.
41:1718:127866:29:24:82:237:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:7.2  Case Study Evidence
41:1719:127890:24:17:82:543:229:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:There is a large case study literature which is consistent with the notion of a quid pro quo between
41:1720:127990:17:17:82:543:212:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:executive and paramilitary politicians. One obvious arena is the formulation of the Justice and
41:1721:128085:17:17:82:543:195:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Peace Law which took place after the secret negotiations at Santa F-e de Ralito. This law was
41:1722:128178:17:17:82:525:178:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:widely criticized both inside and outside Colombia as being far too lenient on paramilitaries.
41:1723:128272:17:17:99:543:161:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Here we focus on a very revealing more recent series of events which also seem to speak to
41:1724:128362:17:17:82:543:144:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the symbiotic relationship. Even though many Congressmen and Senators have been arrested,
41:1725:128451:17:17:82:543:127:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:they are replaced in the legislature by their alternates (in Spanish `suplentes') who appear on the
41:1726:128550:17:17:82:543:110:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:same list at the time of the election. In consequence, their political in\ruence is little diminished.
41:1727:128652:17:0:82:543:93:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:To change this situation members of Congress proposed a political reform in 2008 to remove
42:1728:128744:0:17:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:these politicians and their alternates from the legislature. This initiative was killed when many
42:1729:128841:17:17:82:543:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:politicians failed to appear for a debate so that a quorum was not reached. The fact that Senators
42:1730:128939:17:17:82:543:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:failed to appear for the vote was widely blamed on President Uribe (see the remarks of Senators

42:1734:129316:17:17:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(used sarcastically) in the Constitution is the change to allow President Uribe to run for a third

42:1736:129506:17:17:82:422:572:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f5:politicians deeply implicated with the paramilitaries to pass key bills.44

42:1739:129766:17:17:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Congressmen. As Jos-e Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch put it \Uribe
42:1740:129857:17:17:82:543:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is brazenly trying to take the power to investigate Congressmen away from the one institution

42:1744:130166:35:28:82:190:418:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:8  Conclusions
42:1745:130180:28:17:82:543:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Why are many states in less-developed societies unable to establish Weber's famous monopoly of
42:1746:130274:17:17:82:543:373:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:violence in their territories? The standard explanation relies on the inability of the central state to
42:1747:130377:17:17:82:543:356:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:broadcast its power throughout the territories that it nominally controls and views an extension
42:1748:130473:17:17:82:543:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of this power to the periphery as a natural by-product of `political modernization'. In this paper
42:1749:130571:17:17:82:543:322:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we developed an alternative perspective, suggesting that the central state can develop (even
42:1750:130663:17:17:82:543:305:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:`modernize') without establishing such a monopoly of violence because there may be a symbiotic
42:1751:130757:17:17:82:543:288:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:relationship between the parties controlling the central state and non-state actors exercising power
42:1752:130857:17:17:82:543:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the peripheries of the country. The origins of this symbiotic relationship is that non-state armed
42:1753:130958:17:17:82:543:254:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:actors can provide support to those controlling the central state. This is particularly important
42:1754:131055:17:17:82:543:237:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in democracies where non-state armed actors can control elections. Since they naturally have
42:1755:131147:17:17:82:543:220:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:political preferences, they can (credibly) deliver votes for the national politicians in line with
42:1756:131245:17:17:82:543:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:their ideological and policy biases. Politicians elected with the implicit support of these non-state
42:1757:131346:17:17:82:543:186:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:actors will then have less incentive to eliminate them, leading to an equilibrium without a full
42:1758:131442:17:16:82:543:169:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:monopoly of violence of the central state.  We developed this idea theoretically and provided

42:1762:131818:8:14:91:543:120:6:g_d0_f6:9:g_d0_f7:44In September 2009 both houses of the legislature voted to hold a national referendum on whether to allow Uribe
42:1763:131930:14:11:82:543:106:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:to run for a third term. Socialists and members of the Liberal party abstained in these votes so we do not have
42:1764:132041:11:0:82:202:95:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:further roll-calls on this issue.

43:1766:132138:17:17:99:543:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Our model makes a series of predictions, which we investigated using Colombian data. Our
43:1767:132226:17:17:82:543:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:empirical evidence began by using a variety of strategies to con\frm that paramilitaries have
43:1768:132319:17:17:82:543:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:indeed had a signi\fcant impact on elections in Colombia. Following the foundation of the AUC,
43:1769:132413:17:17:82:543:640:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:there is a sharp increase in the vote share of third parties, which were explicitly or implicitly
43:1770:132510:17:17:82:543:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:associated with paramilitaries, in areas that have high paramilitary presence. The same areas
43:1771:132603:17:17:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:also showed an increase in electoral concentration (the vote share of the most `popular' list in a
43:1772:132701:17:17:82:543:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:municipality). We also presented evidence that high paramilitary presence in areas where senators
43:1773:132798:17:17:82:543:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:received large proportions of their votes predicts how they voted on key clauses of the Justice and
43:1774:132897:17:17:82:543:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Peace Law, and whether they get arrested for illicit links with the paramilitaries. We also found
43:1775:132994:17:15:82:543:538:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that paramilitary presence is correlated with vote share of the winning presidential candidate,
43:1776:133089:15:19:84:147:523:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:-Alvaro Uribe.
43:1777:133103:19:17:99:543:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The two key predictions of our theoretical model are that paramilitaries should persist to the
43:1778:133197:17:17:82:543:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:extent that they deliver votes to politicians whose preferences are closer to their own and that this
43:1779:133298:17:17:82:543:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:e-ect is larger in areas where these politicians would otherwise not do well. These results illustrate
43:1780:133400:17:17:82:543:453:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the possible presence of a symbiotic relationship between the executive and the paramilitaries.
43:1781:133495:17:17:82:543:436:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We further illustrated this relationship by showing that the proportion of the votes which a senate
43:1782:133594:17:17:82:543:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:list won in paramilitary areas is positively correlated with the proportion of Senators on the list
43:1783:133693:17:17:82:507:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that voted to change the Constitution to allow President Uribe to run for a second term.
43:1784:133781:17:17:99:543:385:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Nevertheless, neither our results nor the case study literature suggests the presence of a formal
43:1785:133878:17:17:82:543:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:`coalition' between paramilitary groups and President Uribe. They are consistent, however, with
43:1786:133973:17:17:82:543:351:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the idea that Uribe's policies are closer to those preferred by paramilitaries than those of other
43:1787:134071:17:18:82:543:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:parties which naturally gives the paramilitaries an interest in generating support for him. As

43:1790:134319:28:29:126:382:271:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f5:\reelection of the best President we have ever had".45
43:1791:134373:29:17:99:543:242:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Naturally, di-erent interpretations of the data are possible. For instance, it is possible that
43:1792:134468:17:17:82:543:225:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:people in paramilitary areas are naturally pro `law and order' or more `conservative' so that pres-
43:1793:134567:17:17:82:543:208:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ence of paramilitaries is endogenous to `voter preferences'. If this were true our results connecting
43:1794:134668:17:17:82:543:191:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the presence of paramilitaries to Presidential vote share could be due to omitted variable bias.
43:1795:134764:17:17:82:543:174:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This might also undermine our interpretation of the roll-call votes since it would imply that Sen-
43:1796:134862:17:17:82:543:157:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ators who voted to change the Constitution to allow President Uribe to run again did so because
43:1797:134957:17:17:82:543:140:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:their voters' preferred it. These alternative hypotheses do not appear plausible explanations for
43:1798:135054:17:16:82:543:123:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the patterns, however. First, our identi\fcation comes from the timing of the formation of the AUC

44:1800:135185:0:17:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and their decision to develop an electoral strategy (relying on intimidation, murder and manipu-
44:1801:135281:17:17:82:543:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:lation to get their candidates elected to national o-ce). For example, prior to these events, there
44:1802:135380:17:17:82:543:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:was no signi\fcant di-erences between electoral concentration in areas with or without paramili-
44:1803:135476:17:17:82:543:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:taries, indicating that political preferences did not systematically di-er between these two areas.
44:1804:135575:17:17:82:543:640:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The timing of the formation of the AUC stems mostly from the collapse of the Medell--n and
44:1805:135665:17:17:82:543:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Cali drug cartels and is unlikely to re\rect a change in political preferences on the part of voters.
44:1806:135766:17:17:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Second, to the extent that voter preferences di-er with some areas being more conservative than
44:1807:135861:17:17:82:543:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:others, this would be controlled for by our use of \fxed e-ects as long as these di-erences are
44:1808:135956:17:17:82:543:572:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:time-invariant. Moreover, the case study literature suggests something of a `reality check' on this
44:1809:136055:17:17:82:543:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:argument since it provides extensive evidence of coercion and manipulation of elections in depart-
44:1810:136153:17:17:82:543:538:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ments such as Magdalena, C-esar, C-orboda and Sucre with high paramilitary presence. Third, the
44:1811:136248:17:17:82:543:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:fact that paramilitary presence predicts arrests of Senators makes it improbable that politicians
44:1812:136345:17:17:82:543:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are simply representing voter preferences. These results, along with the case study literature,
44:1813:136440:17:17:82:543:487:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:suggests that politicians formed coalitions with paramilitaries, or paramilitaries generated their
44:1814:136538:17:17:82:543:470:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:own politicians. Fourth, we tried to explicitly control for the time varying e-ects of conservative
44:1815:136637:17:17:82:242:453:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:leanings of certain municipalities.
44:1816:136672:17:17:99:543:436:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:An important area for future investigation is the impact of non-state armed actors on public
44:1817:136764:17:17:82:543:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:good provision. If the paramilitaries, for example, are e-ectively the local state, how do they do
44:1818:136862:17:17:82:543:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:at providing public goods or services relative to the legitimate state? The case study evidence
44:1819:136957:17:17:82:543:385:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:is mixed on this. Some, such as Guti-errez San--n and Bar-on (2005, p. 13) argue in their study
44:1820:137052:17:17:82:543:368:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the development of the paramilitaries in Puerto Boyac-a that they undertook \investments in
44:1821:137146:17:17:82:543:351:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:patronage (drug stores, clinics, health campaigns, educational services)." Duncan's (2007) also
44:1822:137241:17:18:82:543:334:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:supports this idea (see also the|probably not entirely credible|claims in Casta~no, 2001). Yet
44:1823:137335:18:17:82:467:316:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:other anecdotes mitigate against it in Casanare, for example, and in La Guajira.
44:1824:137415:17:17:99:543:299:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A \fnal and crucial question concerns the external validity of these \fndings. Are the mecha-
44:1825:137508:17:17:82:543:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:nisms we discuss only relevant in Colombia, or do they also in\ruence the creation of the monopoly
44:1826:137606:17:17:82:543:265:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of violence in other states? Although our arguments in this paper contrast with the emphasis of
44:1827:137701:17:17:82:543:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:much of the existing literature on state formation, there are several other instances where non-
44:1828:137797:17:17:82:543:231:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:state actors appear to play a similar role to that of paramilitaries in Colombia. For example, as
44:1829:137894:17:17:82:543:214:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:mentioned in the Introduction, the existence of the tribal areas in Waziristan does not imply that
44:1830:137992:17:17:82:543:197:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the state has not formed in Pakistan, but is indicative of a di-erent equilibrium pattern similar
44:1831:138089:17:17:82:543:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to that in Colombia. A related example comes from Italy and the role of the Ma\fa in delivering
44:1832:138184:17:17:82:543:163:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:votes to the Christian Democratic Party (Walston, 1988). Finally, the long autonomy of the US
44:1833:138277:17:17:82:543:146:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:South after the Hayes-Tilden agreement of 1877 until the Civil Rights and Voting Rights acts of
44:1834:138372:17:17:82:543:129:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the 1960s also presents many parallels with the Colombian case. Southern political elites were
44:1835:138466:17:17:82:543:112:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:able to establish a one-party undemocratic political system based on the disenfranchisement and
44:1836:138561:17:0:82:543:95:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:coercion of blacks. The power thus consolidated gave them great in\ruence in national political
45:1837:138658:0:17:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:institutions where they could both impede legislation they did not like, but where they also sup-
45:1838:138755:17:17:82:543:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:plied votes, which was exactly what the Hayes-Tilden deal was about. A telling piece of evidence
45:1839:138851:17:17:82:543:674:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in favor of this interpretation is provided by Franklin D. Roosevelt's reaction to a proposal to
45:1840:138947:17:17:82:543:657:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:pass legislation to attempt to restrict lynching. In response he argued that Southern legislators
45:1841:139044:17:17:82:543:640:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:\are chairmen or occupy strategic places on most of the Senate and House committees ... If I
45:1842:139136:17:17:82:543:623:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:come out for the anti-lynching bill now, they will block every bill I ask Congress to pass" (quoted

45:1844:139326:17:0:82:310:589:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:identi\fed here are of quite general applicability.

51:2001:150012:17:17:82:543:611:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the proportion of votes that Senator Luis Eduardo Vives (14th on Table A1) and Congressman
51:2002:150102:17:17:82:543:594:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Alfonso Campo, one of the signatories at Sante F-e de Ralito, won in each municipality. The map
51:2003:150197:17:17:82:543:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:shows the dramatic increase in electoral concentration in 2002. In particular, in the dark red areas
51:2004:150297:17:17:82:543:560:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:speci\fc politicians were winning essentially 100% of the votes cast in a municipality. One sees
51:2005:150393:17:17:82:543:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that Vives and Campo won very large proportions of votes in the southernmost municipalities
51:2006:150484:17:17:82:543:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:such as San Sebasti-an and Guamal. In the dark red municipalities to the north Senators Salom-on
51:2007:150580:17:17:82:543:509:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Saade and Dieb Maloof won nearly all of the votes (2nd and 5th in Table 1, 3rd and 4th in Table
51:2008:150675:17:17:82:543:492:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A1).  Vives, Maloof and Saade all represented third parties and Vives and Maloof have been
51:2009:150765:17:17:82:543:475:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tried and found guilty of links with paramilitaries, while Saade is currently under investigation.
51:2010:150863:17:17:82:543:458:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Concentration falls in 2006 however and Vives wins large proportions of his vote in municipalities
51:2011:150961:17:17:82:543:441:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to the north, such as El Pinon and San Antonio, where in 2002 he had won no votes. Campo's
51:2012:151051:17:17:82:543:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:vote also becomes more evenly distributed over the Department, though he was not re-elected in
51:2013:151145:17:17:82:543:407:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2006. The pattern is similar for the other Senators and despite of this fall, Maloof and Vives were
51:2014:151244:17:17:82:543:390:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:both re-elected, with almost the same number of votes as in 2006. For example Vives got 53,759
51:2015:151338:17:17:82:289:373:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f5:in Magdalena in 2002 and 54,609 in 2006.46

51:2017:151468:17:29:82:260:339:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:collapsed in the 2002 elections, noted

51:2020:151674:17:17:110:516:276:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:be free. It must also be said clearly and directly that democracy has been kidnapped
51:2021:151758:17:17:110:516:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the department and remains kidnapped through a relationship created between

51:2023:151892:29:17:99:543:213:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Overall, the data for Magdalena show a signi\fcant increase in electoral concentration in 2002
51:2024:151986:17:17:82:543:196:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with several Senators and Congressmen who subsequently were charged with links to paramili-
51:2025:152077:17:16:82:543:179:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:taries, winning close to 100% of the vote in a few selected municipalities. In 2006 concentration

51:2027:152284:15:11:82:543:148:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:were accused of having direct links with paramilitaries. The U party dropped Habib Merheg, Dieb Maloof and Luis
51:2028:152395:11:11:82:543:137:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:Eduardo Vives and Cambio Radical dropped Jorge Caballero and Jorge Castro. Expelled candidates re-appeared
51:2029:152501:11:11:82:543:126:9:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f7:on the lists of smaller pro-Uribe parties and Merheg and Maloof won seats in Congress with the Colombia Viva

52:2032:152708:0:17:82:543:708:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:went down, but interestingly Senators Maloof and Vives were re-elected, though now with their
52:2033:152801:17:394:82:363:691:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:votes spread out much more evenly across the department.
