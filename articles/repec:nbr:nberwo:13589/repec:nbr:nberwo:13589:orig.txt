2:28:1462:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:The existing literature on skill-biased technical change has not considered how the technological endowment
2:29:1569:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:itself plays a role in the returns to skill. This paper constructs a simple model of skill biased technical
2:30:1676:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:change which highlights the role that resource endowments play in the returns to education. The model
2:31:1777:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:predicts variation in returns to education with skill biased technological change if there is significant
2:32:1882:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:heterogeneity in resource endowments before the technological change.  Using a variety of historical
2:33:1982:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:sources, we document the heterogeneous technology levels by region in the American past. We then
2:34:2078:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:estimate the returns to education of high school teachers in the early twentieth century using a new
2:35:2178:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:data source. a report from the U.S. Commissioner of Education in 1909. Overall, we find significant
2:36:2277:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:regional variation in the returns to education that match differences in resource endowments, with
2:37:2375:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:large (within-occupation) returns for the Midwest and Southwest (7%), but much lower returns in
2:38:2470:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:the South (3%) and West (0.5%). We also show that our results are generalizable to returns to education
2:39:2573:14:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:in the United States and that returns to education for teachers tracked quite closely with the overall
2:40:2675:14:42:72:263:420:12:Times:12:Times:returns to education from 1940 onward.

3:54:2942:0:45:72:185:709:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:1  Introduction
3:55:2957:45:22:72:540:664:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Research on skill biased technical change (SBTC) has given rise to a new literature linking educa-
3:56:3055:22:22:72:540:642:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tion, technology, and economic growth. The consensus now is that high rates of return to education
3:57:3153:22:22:72:540:620:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:at the beginning of the century signaled the end of the period of early industrialization where raw
3:58:3252:22:22:72:540:598:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:materials and unskilled labor substituted easily for skilled labor (Goldin and Katz 1998).  With
3:59:3348:22:22:72:540:576:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the use of new large-scale processing technologies and the increasing electriÖcation of the industrial
3:60:3450:22:22:72:540:554:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:workplace, the returns to education increased dramatically in the early years of the last century.
3:61:3548:22:22:72:540:532:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Goldin and Katz (1999, 2000) used the Iowa state Census of 1915 to sketch out the returns to
3:62:3640:22:22:72:540:510:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:education in the early twentieth century, and a new view of U-shaped returns to education over the
3:63:3738:22:21:72:540:488:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:twentieth century has emerged.  Returns declined with the advent of the high school movement in
3:64:3833:21:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the 1920s and 1930s (Goldin and Katz 1995), perhaps intensiÖed by the wage controls used in the
3:65:3928:22:22:72:522:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:second World War (Goldin and Margo 1992), and rose again in the second half of the century.
3:66:4019:22:22:88:539:423:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:At the same time, there is a growing body of contemporary evidence that factor endowments
3:67:4108:22:22:72:540:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:play a role in the returns to skill. Comin, Hobijn, and Rovito (2007) have shown that technological
3:68:4207:22:22:72:540:379:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:lags between countries are large and they are correlated across technologies, consistent with the
3:69:4304:22:22:72:540:357:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:idea that regions are at the forefront or backwater of technological change broadly and not only in
3:70:4403:22:22:72:540:335:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:selected areas.  Autor, Levy and Murname (2003) show that adoption of PCs increased the skill
3:71:4496:22:22:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:demands for the same occupations over time, leading to increasing returns to education.  Abowd,
3:72:4591:22:22:72:540:291:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:et al. (2007) have shown that Örms that use the most sophisticated technology employ more skilled
3:73:4688:22:22:72:540:269:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:workers, and this also suggest that the geographic location of Örms will not be uniform but itself
3:74:4786:22:22:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:may be a function of the level of skill in the local labor market. Beaudry, Doms, and Lewis (2006)
3:75:4884:22:22:72:540:225:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:show that cities with larger supplies of skilled labor adopted PCs more quickly than others, and
3:76:4980:22:21:72:540:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that this caused the increase in returns to skill to be greatest for cities that adopted PC more
3:77:5076:21:22:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:aggressively.  Overall, there is now strong evidence that technological di§erences and di§erences
3:78:5173:22:22:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in factor endowments such as capital and skilled labor play a large role in how SBTC e§ects the
3:79:5268:22:22:72:540:138:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:labor market and technology adoption (Caselli and Coleman 2006).  The open question is how (or
3:80:5362:22:22:72:540:116:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:if) these endowments played a role in previous waves of SBTC, such as the United States at the
3:81:5456:22:22:72:186:94:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:turn of the last century.
3:82:5481:22:0:88:539:72:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:When one takes regional heterogeneity of factor endowments into account there are very good
4:83:5573:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reasons to believe that the Northeast and Midwest had U-shaped returns to education but that
4:84:5665:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:other regions of the country had steadily increasing returns to education over the twentieth century.
4:85:5766:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:First, available large-scale processing technologies that led to the rise in the returns to education did
4:86:5871:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:not di§use evenly across the United States. The industrial states of the Northeast and Midwest had
4:87:5969:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:larger concentrations of such industries than the South and West. The South and West employed
4:88:6062:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:older-technology industries for the most part (including traditional agriculture), and it is therefore
4:89:6164:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:unlikely that the returns to education in those regions would be large in the early twentieth century.
4:90:6266:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Similarly, the increasing technological sophistication of agriculture, which led states like Iowa to
4:91:6366:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:invest heavily in education, was largely a phenomena of the Midwest and Northeast. The South
4:92:6458:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:was still able to exploit its large supply of unskilled labor, and the West had a relative abundance of
4:93:6561:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:raw materials but a scarcity of labor.  In general, potential correlates and precursors of high rates
4:94:6662:22:22:72:538:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of return to education were not evenly distributed across the U.S. at the start of the last century.
4:95:6762:22:21:88:539:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Not only would changes in demand for skill have varied across regions, but the relative supply
4:96:6856:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of skilled workers was also variable across regions. Investment in education and infrastructure more
4:97:6956:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:generally varied considerably, and the high school movement that came later di§used unevenly as
4:98:7051:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:well. In the South and Southwest in 1910, high school graduation rates were only four percent, while
4:99:7151:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:they were triple that in the Midwest and PaciÖc Coast, and still higher in New England (Goldin
4:100:7245:22:22:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1999). Finally, the transportation and information technologies at the beginning of the twentieth
4:101:7342:22:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:century were not uniform, and as such the Örst half of the twentieth century saw a signiÖcant
4:102:7435:22:22:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:integration of regional and local labor markets into a national market, spurred not only by wage
4:103:7531:22:22:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:controls, but also by the national minimum wage, which spurred capital investment in Southern
4:104:7624:22:22:72:369:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:agriculture (Wright 1987, Mitchener and McLean 1999, 2003).
4:105:7683:22:22:88:539:226:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In light of the historical fact of regional heterogeneity and the contemporary evidence about
4:106:7776:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the role of factor endowments in SBTC, this paper asks the following question: To what extent
4:107:7869:22:22:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:did di§erences in factor endowments e§ect the return to skill during the Örst era of skill biased
4:108:7966:22:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:technical change?  Indeed, it may well be true that existing factor endowments played a large role
4:109:8064:21:22:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the adoption of new technology, and as such SBTC would have been a function of pre-existing
4:110:8158:22:22:72:540:117:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:conditions. Even more, any discussion of the technology-skill complementarity in American history
4:111:8255:22:22:72:540:95:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:should take into account the regional di§erences in the American economy in the early twentieth
4:112:8350:22:0:72:540:73:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:century.  Doing so highlights the importance of the educational and capital endowments in the
5:113:8444:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:early stages of SBTC, and provides a strong link between the SBTC literature and contempo-
5:114:8534:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rary studies of local and regional labor markets. This is especially important for policies in both
5:115:8633:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:large cities and for developing countries since di§erences in factor endowments may require dif-
5:116:8729:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ferent short-term responses to skill-biased technological change.  We formally develop the idea of
5:117:8827:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:capital-complementing skill-biased technical change in a simple two-sector model and show that
5:118:8921:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the initial level of capital is an important piece of the returns to education relationship. The model
5:119:9023:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:shows that capital-rich markets should experience the largest increase in returns to education and
5:120:9121:22:22:72:520:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:complementing this, skill-rich markets will have the largest increases in the returns to capital.
5:121:9218:22:22:88:539:533:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In describing the origins of SBTC, the rates of return to education in the early twentieth century
5:122:9316:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reported by Goldin and Katz has been limited to a single state, which may have been a relative
5:123:9410:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:outlier for that time. What was lacking was a data source that would allow us to estimate the returns
5:124:9511:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to education by region, to see if signiÖcant di§erences existed and to measure the magnitude of
5:125:9606:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:those di§erences. In this paper we use a new data source, a report from the U.S. Commissioner of
5:126:9702:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Education in 1909, to estimate the returns to education of high school teachers in the early twentieth
5:127:9804:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:century. Our data list not only the education and earnings of the teachers individually for a number
5:128:9904:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of di§erent states, but also includes actual years of experience in the teaching profession, allowing
5:129:10005:22:22:72:539:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:us to estimate the returns to schooling while controlling for experience directly.1More importantly,
5:130:10105:22:22:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the data was gathered in a systematic fashion, allowing us to estimate the returns to education
5:131:10200:22:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by region without the additional complication of di§erences in data quality and reliability. These
5:132:10298:22:22:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:returns are for a single occupation ñthe absolute levels may understate returns generally, since one
5:133:10398:22:22:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of the important gains of schooling comes from enabling workers to choose higher paid occupations.
5:134:10496:22:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Nonetheless, secondary teachers returns are of interest since they likely reáect the rising demand
5:135:10594:22:22:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for high school education relative to the current stock of high school educated workers (the pool of
5:136:10694:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:potential teachers). That is, rising demand for high school education creates a derived demand for
5:137:10792:22:22:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:educated teachers. Overall, we Önd signiÖcant regional variation in the returns to education, with
5:138:10890:22:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:large returns congruent to Goldin and Katzís estimates for the Midwest (7%), but substantially
5:139:10984:21:17:72:311:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:lower returns in the South (3%) and West (0.5%).
5:140:11032:17:15:84:539:122:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:1Note that the requirements to teach at the secondary level varied greatly in the past, and the professionalization
5:141:11147:15:11:72:540:107:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:of the teaching profession, in terms of certiÖcation and degree requirements, did not begin until after the high school
5:142:11266:11:11:72:540:96:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:movement.  For example, from 1909 to 1919 only eleven states began requiring a high school diploma for the lowest
5:143:11379:11:11:72:540:85:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:level of teacher certiÖcation; Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Illinois, Indiana, New Jersey, Utah, Vermont,
5:144:11491:11:0:72:282:74:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:New Hampshire, and Maine (Law and Marks 2007).
6:145:11538:0:22:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In considering the generalizability of our main Önding, we uncover several facts which strengthen
6:146:11635:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:our conclusion.  The geographical patterns we Önd hold for male teachers and for less experienced
6:147:11732:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:teachers, for whom outside options may be more relevant and may therefore be more closely con-
6:148:11826:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:nected to the wider labor market. We further Önd that teachersíreturns to education are indicative
6:149:11924:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of overall returns to education. We use IPUMS returns to show that the returns to education for
6:150:12019:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:teachers track quite closely with the overall returns to education from 1940 onward. We also show
6:151:12116:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that the returns to education for the states in our historical data track well with national returns
6:152:12216:22:22:72:175:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:over this later period.
6:153:12239:22:22:88:539:533:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The paper proceeds as follows.  The next section reviews the facts about regional economic
6:154:12329:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:heterogeneity at the beginning of the twentieth century and presents our two sector model which
6:155:12424:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:highlights variation in returns to education at the start of skill biased technical change. The third
6:156:12525:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:section presents the empirical results, which are based on the 1909 Commissioner of Education
6:157:12618:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Report.  They show that there was signiÖcant regional variation in the returns to education in
6:158:12712:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the early twentieth century.  The fourth section addresses the robustness and extensions of the
6:159:12807:22:46:72:293:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:empirical results.  The Önal section concludes.
6:160:12854:46:33:72:437:356:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:2  Skill, Technology, and the Returns to Education
6:161:12904:33:21:72:540:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The existing explanation for the trend in returns to education has not acknowledged, for the most
6:162:13001:21:22:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:part, the substantial variation in the preconditions for the rise in the returns to education. There
6:163:13101:22:22:72:540:280:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are two ways in which the existing theory should be modiÖed to Öt the regional histories of the
6:164:13196:22:22:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:United States. First, the di§erences in the resource and capital endowments in di§erent regions of
6:165:13294:22:22:72:540:236:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the country must be accounted for. Second, the preconditions for increasing returns to education,
6:166:13391:22:22:72:540:214:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:as required by the theory, must be reconciled with the historical record. Below, we sketch out these
6:167:13491:22:22:72:540:192:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:two issues, presenting evidence of signiÖcant variation in education and other factor endowments
6:168:13587:22:22:72:540:170:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by region and augmenting the theory of skill biased technical change to yield predictions of the
6:169:13683:22:22:72:540:148:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:returns to education for di§erent regions of the United States at the beginning of the twentieth

7:171:13788:0:29:72:234:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:2.1  The Historical Record
7:172:13814:29:22:72:540:680:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The di§erences in the factor endowments in di§erent regions of the U.S. in the early twentieth
7:173:13908:22:22:72:540:658:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:century is well known. Capital development in South, from the end of the Civil War to at least
7:174:14002:22:22:72:540:636:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:World War I, was rather ine¢ cient (Davis 1965, Sylla 1969, Wright 1987, Ransom and Sutch 2001),
7:175:14098:22:22:72:540:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and Önancial institutions in the South were not structured in the same way as those in the Northeast
7:176:14198:22:22:72:540:592:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and Midwest, with Southern banks much smaller than the national average and with higher interest
7:177:14294:22:22:72:540:570:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:rates in the South. This is important to the extent that capital markets in the U.S. were segmented
7:178:14393:22:22:72:540:548:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the early twentieth century. The South did not have as many capital intensive industries as the
7:179:14491:22:22:72:540:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Northeast and Midwest at the beginning of the twentieth century, and North (1961) has argued
7:180:14583:22:22:72:540:504:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that the South did not re-invest the gains made from its productive agricultural sector.  Similarly,
7:181:14683:22:22:72:540:482:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the South, with its sharecropping system and Jim Crow legislation, had a large supply of unskilled
7:182:14781:22:22:72:540:460:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:labor of both races (Ransom and Sutch 2001, Collins 1997). Furthermore, black unskilled labor
7:183:14874:22:21:72:540:438:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:was locked in the South by the large áows of immigrants from Europe and racial discrimination in
7:184:14970:21:22:72:540:417:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:non-farm employment in the U.S. in general (Collins 1997).  The West, with its relatively sparse
7:185:15066:22:22:72:540:395:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:population, had an abundant resource endowment that was only beginning to be exploited in the
7:186:15159:22:22:72:540:373:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:early twentieth century (Nelson and Wright 1992). In general, this implies that the trade o§s where
7:187:15258:22:22:72:540:351:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:raw materials and unskilled labor substituted for skilled labor would have been more prevalent in
7:188:15355:22:22:72:378:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the South and West since they had an abundance of the former.
7:189:15416:22:22:88:539:307:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The historical record also tells us that the processes that led to the increasing returns to educa-
7:190:15515:22:22:72:540:285:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tion were less prevalent in the South and West. Given the Southís low levels of capital intensity and
7:191:15616:22:22:72:540:263:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:warm climate, there were relatively few of the new large-scale processing technologies highlighted
7:192:15714:22:22:72:540:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by Goldin and Katz (1998) in the South and West at the end of the nineteenth century. As Wright
7:193:15809:22:22:72:540:219:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(1987) has shown, the South was simply not in a position to industrialize (beyond the harvesting
7:194:15905:22:22:72:540:197:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of raw materials) in any large extent before the Örst World War. A possible exception would be
7:195:15999:22:22:72:540:175:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:textiles, an older industry that had permeated the South before the early twentieth century, which
7:196:16097:22:21:72:540:153:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:was bolstered by cheap Southern (low-skilled) labor, and would later exceed its northern com-
7:197:16190:21:22:72:540:132:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:petition (Carlson 1981, Wright 1981). Similarly, the Southís agriculture, with its dependence on
7:198:16286:22:22:72:540:110:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:labor-intensive work, was not as sophisticated as the agriculture of the Northeast and Midwest, nor
7:199:16385:22:0:72:540:88:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the cattle ranching seen in the West.  Indeed, Goldin and Sokolo§ (1984) have argued that indus-
8:200:16482:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:trialization Örst appeared in the Northeast and Midwest because of the crops grown there, which
8:201:16577:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:led to agricultural technology that made women relatively less productive than men in agriculture.
8:202:16675:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In terms of the educational structures necessary to see large returns to education develop, Goldin
8:203:16773:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and Katz (1998) have shown that large investments in education took place most successfully in
8:204:16867:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:homogeneous populations. As such, racial diversity in the South would have caused lower invest-
8:205:16962:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ments in schooling, and it is certainly true that low investments in education left large portions of
8:206:17063:22:22:72:497:577:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:the southern workforce relatively unskilled at the turn of the last century (Margo 1990).2
8:207:17153:22:22:88:539:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:There is also research that details the extent to which the labor market in the United States
8:208:17246:22:22:71:539:533:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:was fragmented in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Rosenbloom (1990, 1996) has
8:209:17342:22:22:71:539:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:shown that the labor market in the early years of the twentieth century was fragmented, and North-
8:210:17440:22:22:71:539:489:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:South di§erentials in wages suggest that a national labor market did not exist before the Örst World
8:211:17540:22:22:71:539:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:War. While it is not true that every locality had its own independent labor market, it is true that
8:212:17639:22:21:71:539:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the South and North had di§erent labor markets that were not fully integrated to any large degree
8:213:17736:21:22:71:539:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:until after the Örst World War.  Wright (1987) contends that the Southern labor market was not
8:214:17830:22:22:71:539:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:integrated until the New Deal forced the South to invest in capital for the agricultural sector, and
8:215:17930:22:22:71:539:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that the South was Önally brought into the rest of the national labor market by the end of the
8:216:18024:22:38:71:162:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:second World War.
8:217:18041:38:29:71:369:320:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:2.2  Measuring the Historical Factor Endowments
8:218:18088:29:22:71:539:291:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The literature suggest that there are educational and technological factors related to the returns to
8:219:18189:22:22:71:540:269:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:education in the early twentieth century.3Skill-biased technologies were associated with capital
8:220:18285:22:22:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:intensity. If a region had a relatively high educational levels and small amounts of capital, we would
8:221:18387:22:22:72:540:225:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:expect relatively low returns to education.  If a region had low educational levels and relatively
8:222:18485:22:22:72:540:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:large amounts of capital, we would expect for the returns to education to be high.4But how can
8:223:18579:22:22:72:540:181:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:we measure the factor endowment, and was there heterogeneity in the factor endowment by region
8:224:18673:22:21:72:540:159:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century?  To answer these questions we Örst look at
8:225:18767:21:16:72:540:138:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:estimates of labor productivity and then assemble evidence from theHistorical Statistics of the
8:226:18862:16:15:84:539:122:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:2Bleakley (2007) notes that the eradication of hookworm in the South, begun in 1910, raised the lifetime return
8:227:18973:15:7:72:179:107:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:to education in the region.
8:228:19000:7:11:84:479:100:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:3Intuitively, one could think of eductaional factors as supply and technological factors as demand.
8:229:19099:11:15:84:539:89:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:4A priori, we cannot form Örm hypotheses about the returns to education in regions that had large levels of both
8:230:19211:15:0:72:359:74:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:education and capital or small levels of both education and technology.

9:233:19477:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:century.  Educational factors include the general education level of the population in a particular
9:234:19576:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:region, investments in education, and school enrollment rates as they would be evidence that a
9:235:19670:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:particular region would have the skill in the workforce to readily adopt to new technologies.  We
9:236:19767:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:also measure proxies for the importance of new skill-intensive technologies, including the capital
9:237:19865:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:stock, both in manufacturing and agriculture, the use of various sources of power, the share of the
9:238:19964:22:22:72:513:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:labor force employed in manufacturing, and evidence of technology adoption more generally.

9:240:20150:22:22:72:539:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:per worker by region and for individual states from 1880 to 1920.5The regional heterogeneity in
9:241:20245:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:labor productivity was large, with the West far ahead of the rest of the nation while the South
9:242:20340:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:lagged behind.  In the bottom panel of Table 1 we show estimates of labor productivity for the
9:243:20434:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:states in our historical data and their geographic neighbors.  The results show that estimates for
9:244:20532:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:individual states are fairly representative for their region;they are close to the estimates for their
9:245:20634:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:neighbors and the growth over the 1880 to 1920 period for individual states varies at the regional
9:246:20732:22:22:72:96:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:level.
9:247:20738:22:22:88:539:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:While these labor productivity estimates establish regional heterogeneity in labor productivity,
9:248:20834:22:22:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and support the assertion that regional labor markets were substantially segmented, they do not
9:249:20929:22:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tell us about regional heterogeneity in factor endowments themselves.  For example, states with a
9:250:21026:22:22:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:signiÖcant percentage of the labor force in mining have a higher level of labor productivity. Mitch-
9:251:21126:22:22:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ener and McLean (2003) note that this is likely due to both the large natural resource endowment
9:252:21222:22:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the West and its relative labor scarcity.  A priori, returns to education in the West may have
9:253:21319:22:22:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:been particularly low due to the high wages commanded by unskilled workers, or they could be
9:254:21411:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:high because of the technology used to extract these resources.  Similarly, these trends in labor
9:255:21508:22:22:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:productivity tell us little about how labor productivity (price-adjusted income per worker) varied
9:256:21606:22:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with changes in the educational, capital and resource endowments.  Since these estimates of labor
9:257:21703:21:22:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:productivity are themselves a function of the factor endowments, we must turn to more direct
9:258:21795:22:16:72:540:117:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:measures to gauge the extent of heterogeneity in educational and non-labor endowments in the
9:259:21887:16:15:84:539:101:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:5Following Mitchener and McLean (1999, 2003) we take price adjusted income per worker as the measure of labor
9:260:21996:15:0:72:123:86:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:productivity.
10:261:22010:0:22:72:145:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:American past.
10:262:22024:22:22:88:539:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Tables 2 and 3 summarize these educational and non-labor factors.  Table 2 lists measures
10:263:22113:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:associated with both the level and growth of education, listing the literacy rate, school expenditures,
10:264:22216:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and school enrollment for the high school aged population in the early twentieth century. California,
10:265:22317:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Illinois, Iowa, Ohio, and Wisconsin all have high literacy rates, each above 95% by 1910 and all but
10:266:22417:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:California above 95% in 1900, suggesting a large endowment of relatively skilled workers.  Both
10:267:22512:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Georgia and Texas have relatively low literacy rates, suggesting a smaller endowment of skilled
10:268:22607:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:workers. The second panel shows school expenditures, both per capita and per capita of the school
10:269:22704:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:aged population. Although all states saw signiÖcant growth in school expenditures per capita from
10:270:22801:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1900 to 1920, Georgia was spending less than one quarter of what the Midwestern states were, and
10:271:22897:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Texas only slightly more than half. California, by contrast, was spending more than 150% of what
10:272:22993:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the Midwestern states were.  The last panel of Table 2 shows school attendance rates for high
10:273:23086:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:school age students. In 1910, Georgia is the only state in which less than three quarters of 14 or
10:274:23184:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:15 year olds are not attending school.  Texasíattendance rates were approaching the rates for the
10:275:23281:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Midwestern states and show a particularly high attendance rate for 16 to 17 year olds.  By 1930,
10:276:23377:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:California has the highest attendance Ögures for 1910 to 1930 for 14 and 15 year olds, and very
10:277:23472:22:22:72:228:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:high rates for 16 to 20 year olds.
10:278:23506:22:22:88:539:336:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 3A presents some growth in factors associated with the spread of skill-intensive production
10:279:23603:22:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:methods.  The manufacturing share of the labor force in Illinois, Ohio, and Wisconsin grows by
10:280:23697:22:22:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:an average of 95% from 1900 to 1910.  In Iowa the manufacturing share of the labor force grows
10:281:23791:22:22:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by 124% between 1900 and 1910, and in Texas the percentage employed in manufacturing nearly
10:282:23882:22:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:doubles between 1900 and 1910, increasing by 99%.  Similarly, the value of machinery per the
10:283:23974:22:22:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:agricultural workforce increases substantially between 1900 and 1910 in Texas.  The growth of
10:284:24067:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Georgiaís labor force in manufacturing was relatively modest (only 68%), suggesting a relatively
10:285:24163:22:22:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:less ináuential spread of skill-intensive technologies in Georgia, and the manufacturing sector grows
10:286:24264:22:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the least in California between 1900 and 1910 (only 64%).  Table 3A also shows that the growth
10:287:24358:21:22:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in agricultural factors associated with high-skill production such as machinery value and livestock
10:288:24457:22:22:72:540:117:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:value grow relatively modestly from 1900 to 1910 for all states.  There were di§erences in capital
10:289:24555:22:22:72:540:95:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:deepening, however, the level of capital per establishment in 1905 was much greater than in 1900
10:290:24651:22:0:72:540:73:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for all states, partly driven by a decrease in the number of establishments, but an outlier in this
11:291:24751:0:22:72:510:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:factor is Texas, which sees a signiÖcant increase in the amount of capital per establishment.
11:292:24844:22:22:88:539:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:As we noted earlier, the story of skill biased technical change supposes a displacement of the
11:293:24938:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:old technology for the new, skill complementing technology, and Table 3B presents evidence of
11:294:25031:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the prevalence of capital-intensive technologies by state in the beginning of the twentieth century.
11:295:25131:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:There was marked variation in the importance of these technologies by region in the early 20th
11:296:25225:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:century.  The number of technological Örms and the value added by manufacturing varied con-
11:297:25316:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:siderably.  There were many more technological Örms in the Midwestern states than in the South
11:298:25410:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:or the West.   California and Texas, states with signiÖcant natural resource endowments, have
11:299:25503:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:relatively low levels of value added in manufacturing.  This carries over into more direct measures
11:300:25602:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of technology, such as the number of internal combustion engines and electric motors, which were
11:301:25698:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:much more prominent in the Midwest than in the South or West. California and Texas do increase
11:302:25792:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the number of electric motors by the beginning of the twentieth century, but Georgia still lags well
11:303:25892:22:21:72:346:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:behind the other states in the use of this new technology.
11:304:25950:21:22:88:539:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:These di§erences carried over into the early twentieth century. Table 3C presents evidence from
11:305:26045:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the Örst three decades of the twentieth century. Internal combustion horsepower shows the marked
11:306:26141:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:variation in how intensively these technologies were used.  Both Georgia and Texas have less than
11:307:26238:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1,000 internal combustion horsepower in 1900, although they do increase horsepower signiÖcantly
11:308:26333:22:22:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by 1910.  Further inferences can be drawn from the number of internal combustion engines and
11:309:26425:22:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:electric motors per establishment in 1919 and the amount of horsepower from both sources in 1929.
11:310:26522:22:22:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:While Texas leads in internal combustion power in 1929 and has relatively high amounts of electric
11:311:26620:22:22:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:power, California, and Georgia lag behind the other states both in the number of electric motors
11:312:26716:22:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and in horsepower generated by them.  Even with the gains made by California, Georgia, and
11:313:26806:22:22:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Texas, they continue to lag behind the Midwestern states in the number of electric motors per
11:314:26899:22:22:72:507:204:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:establishment in 1919, and in the amount of electric horsepower per establishment in 1929.
11:315:26989:22:22:88:539:182:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:All told, the evidence in Tables 1 and 2 show that there were marked di§erences in the factors
11:316:27083:22:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:related to the returns to education in the early twentieth century.  Although we argue that these
11:317:27180:21:22:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:di§erences can allow us to crudely group states by their factor endowments and use of technologies,
11:318:27279:22:22:72:540:117:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:it is important to note that this evidence is suggestive.  We do not argue here that every measure
11:319:27377:22:22:72:540:95:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:should agree with our general assertions about the regional di§erences in the supply and demand
11:320:27472:22:0:72:540:73:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for skill, and we would be surprised if they did. For example, Lamoreaux and Sokolo§ (2000) show
12:321:27569:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that during the late nineteenth century there began to be a divide geographic divide between the
12:322:27665:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:centers of invention and the centers of production in some respects.  All of the evidence presented
12:323:27764:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:here, however, is more consistent with the proposition of regional heterogeneity than homogene-
12:324:27859:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ity, and agrees with our general point about signiÖcant regional variation in the educational and
12:325:27956:22:22:72:198:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:technological endowments.
12:326:27981:22:22:88:539:599:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:These regional di§erences do not Öt well into a monolithic model of skill-biased technical change
12:327:28078:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and U-shaped returns to education over the twentieth century.  The Midwestern states appear to
12:328:28172:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:have large endowments of capital and education, and prominent use of capital-intensive, frontier
12:329:28268:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:technologies, while Georgia has a relatively little capital for frontier technologies and low levels of
12:330:28371:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:education.  California and Texas, however, are more di¢ cult to classify.  Relative to each other,
12:331:28469:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:California has a larger educational endowment than Texas (and every other state, for that matter),
12:332:28567:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:but technologically the two states are roughly similar and are close to one another on most ordinal
12:333:28666:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:ranking of the technology indicators in Table 3.  While some regions fall easily into a set that
12:334:28762:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:would yield predictions about the returns to education, direct estimates of the returns to education
12:335:28862:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are necessary for regions with indeterminate predictions for the returns to education based on their
12:336:28962:22:22:72:137:380:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f2:endowments.6
12:337:28974:22:22:88:539:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Overall, there is striking heterogeneity in the factors and proxies related to the return to educa-
12:338:29073:22:22:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tion.  A movement towards new capital and skill-intensive processing technologies would not have
12:339:29169:22:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the same e§ect on the relatively unindustrialized South as it would on the Midwest. Similarly, one
12:340:29267:22:22:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:would predict that, given di§erences in their educational endowments, skill-biased technological
12:341:29363:22:22:72:539:270:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:change would have a di§erent impact in California as opposed to Texas.7Given these regional
12:342:29454:22:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:di§erences in factor endowments at the beginning of the twentieth century, we would expect skill
12:343:29550:22:22:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:biased technical change to produce regional di§erences in returns to education in the early twenti-
12:344:29649:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:eth century.  Below, we present a simple model that captures features of the technology-skill story
12:345:29748:22:22:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in a two-sector model, to highlight the importance of factor endowments in explaining returns to

13:353:30466:29:22:72:540:680:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Assume initially that there are two sectors of production, a land-dependent sector,t(for traditional

16:461:34082:22:22:88:539:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Together Propositions 1 and 2 show that the model replicates the story of Goldin and Katz
16:462:34171:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(1998).  That is, the new capital-dependent sector expands, increasing the relative demand for
16:463:34265:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:skilled workers and also their relative wage. If the new technology is a dramatic enough advance it
16:464:34364:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:furthers industrializationñdisplacing the old technology and even employing more unskilled workers
16:465:34462:22:22:72:464:599:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:than the old technology.9This is the standard skill-biased technical change story.
16:466:34544:22:22:88:539:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Proposition 3 has strong implications that predict higher returns and more labor employed in
16:467:34636:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the new technology in areas with high relative endowments of capital. Thus, there will be variation
16:468:34735:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the returns to education that go hand-in-hand with the nature and extent of industrialization
16:469:34831:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:before the technological change. The result is entirely intuitiveñthe region that is technologically
16:470:34931:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:backward sees little increase in the returns to education because the technological change is skill
16:471:35030:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:intensive, but the backwards region has little of either the old or new capital-intensive technologies.
16:472:35133:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In order for batch processing and electriÖcation to induce high returns to education, there had to
16:473:35231:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:be industries that could implement and successfully take advantage of the new technologies.  In
16:474:35326:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:other words, displacement of old technology will not result in increased returns to education if
16:475:35422:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:there is not a signiÖcant amount of old technology to be replaced.  Proposition 3 highlights the
16:476:35518:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:role that the technological endowment has with the return to education.  If a region did not have
16:477:35615:22:22:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the infrastructure or extensive industry before the di§usion of skill intensive technologies, it would
16:478:35717:22:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:not lead to large returns to education in that region. Proposition 3 therefore provides us with the
16:479:35816:22:22:72:287:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:central test of the theory in the next section.
16:480:35863:22:22:88:539:270:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Finally, Proposition 4 shows how the new technologies increased the incentives to invest in
16:481:35954:22:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:physical capital, especially in areas with high levels of human capital. The new technology increases
16:482:36055:22:22:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the return to capital, and the increases will be larger the larger the educational endowment.  The
16:483:36153:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:model therefore o§ers an explanation for increased levels of industrialization experienced in the
16:484:36250:22:22:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Örst half of the century, but faster industrialization in the Northeast, Midwest and West (where
16:485:36346:22:16:72:403:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:schooling levels were high) than in the South, where they were lower.
16:486:36415:16:15:84:539:144:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:9Given the static nature of the problem, Proposition 1 implies extreme displacement.  In the real world, the
16:487:36523:15:0:72:395:129:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:changeover of capital from the old to new technology is clearly a slower process.

17:489:36654:29:22:72:540:680:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Ideally, we would like to test these implications directly using economy wide wage data. Unfor-
17:490:36749:22:22:72:540:658:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tunately, such data is not readily available. We show that reasonable assumptions translate the
17:491:36844:22:22:72:540:636:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:relative wages of workers overall into relative wages of high- and low-skilled teachers through the
17:492:36943:22:22:72:540:614:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:derived demand for education and ultimately teachers. We model a schooling sector, and allow
17:493:37035:22:22:72:539:592:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:students to decide whether to become high- or low-skilled. Lethandldenote the number who
17:494:37123:22:40:72:540:570:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:become high- and low-skilled, respectively, which are produced using high- and low-skilled workers:

17:499:37262:40:22:88:539:416:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The following proposition delineates three assumptions for the above predictions regarding
17:500:37352:22:34:72:509:394:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:relative wages in the economy overall to also hold for relative wages in the schooling sector.
17:501:37446:34:22:72:191:360:11:g_d0_f1:11:g_d0_f3:Proposition 5Assume:
17:502:37466:22:22:72:540:338:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(i) the relative supply of high-skilled teachers is increasing in the relative supply of high-skilled
17:503:37567:22:22:72:539:316:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:workers in the overall labor force, i.e.,@(Hs=Ls)@(H=L)>0; (ii) the relative student demand for high- vs.
17:504:37672:22:22:72:539:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:low-skilled educations is increasing in the relative wage to high-skilled workers, i.e.,@(h=l)@(wh=wl)>0;
17:505:37777:22:21:72:540:272:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(iii) the production of high-skilled education is more intensive in high-skilled teachers than the low-
17:506:37880:21:22:72:540:251:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:skilled education, i.e.,Hh=Lh> Hl=Ll.  Then the relative wage of high-skilled teachers increases,
17:507:37977:22:33:72:334:229:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and increases more the higher the capital to land ratio:

17:517:38079:21:22:88:539:99:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Given the assumptions in Proposition 5, the predictions for relative wage overall in Propositions
17:518:38176:22:0:72:540:77:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:2 and 3 also hold for the relative wage of teachers.  Intuitively, increasing returns to skill (which
18:519:38279:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are a function of the factor endowments) lead to increasing demand for education.  Since the type
18:520:38376:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of education demanded is intensive in high-skilled individuals, the returns to education for teachers
18:521:38477:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of high level skills will mirror the returns to skill more generally.  We turn now to the data on
18:522:38574:22:46:72:160:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:teacherís earnings.

18:525:38655:29:22:72:540:523:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We estimate the returns to education with a new and unique data source, a 1909 report from the
18:526:38749:22:22:72:540:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:U.S. Commissioner of Education which allows us to estimate the returns to education of secondary
18:527:38845:22:22:72:540:479:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:teachers in the early twentieth century by region.  The data come from a report prepared for then
18:528:38942:22:22:72:540:457:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:U.S. Commissioner of Education Elmer Ellsworth Brown on the labor force of teachers. The report,
18:529:39038:22:22:72:540:435:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:entitledìThe Teaching Sta§ of Secondary Schools in the United Statesîby Edward L. Thorndike
18:530:39129:22:22:72:540:413:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:was the Örst report in a Öve-year, Öve-report plan to collect data on secondary education (the
18:531:39223:22:21:72:540:391:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:other four focused on the student body, curriculum, Önances, and special education, respectively).
18:532:39321:21:22:72:540:370:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Thorndike spent a large part of his professional life researching features of secondary education,
18:533:39419:22:22:72:366:348:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:many of which have implications for the issues analyzed here.
18:534:39480:22:22:88:539:326:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:As noted elsewhere (Goldin and Katz 1995) the rise of the high school movement in the United
18:535:39572:22:22:72:540:304:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:States was changing the relationship between schooling and wages in the early twentieth century.
18:536:39668:22:22:72:540:282:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Thorndike (1922) notes that the number of students enrolled in high school in 1918 was more than
18:537:39764:22:22:72:540:260:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:six times greater than the number enrolled in 1890.  Similarly, while only ten percent of teenagers
18:538:39863:22:22:72:540:238:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:continued on to high school in 1890, more than thirty percent did by 1920.  These changes in high
18:539:39960:22:22:72:540:216:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:school enrollment changed the high school curriculum and the requirements one had to meet to
18:540:40052:22:22:72:540:194:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:become a teacher.10Thorndike and Robinson (1923) show that the homogenized training of high
18:541:40143:22:22:72:540:172:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:school students that was the norm in the late nineteenth century had given way to a curriculum that
18:542:40242:22:22:72:540:150:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:emphasized science and mathematics at the expense of English literature and Latin.  In addition
18:543:40337:22:21:72:540:128:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to a di§erent focus, the high school curriculum was now highly specialized, the expansion of the
18:544:40433:21:16:72:540:107:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:curriculum meant that students were rarely taking identical courses of study, a common feature in
18:545:40530:16:15:80:539:91:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:10Only beginning in 1909, after our survey, did any states begin to require a high school diploma for the lowest
18:546:40642:15:0:72:186:76:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:level of teacher certiÖcation.
19:547:40674:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:modern high school education.  Thorndike and Symonds (1922) saw these changes as altering the
19:548:40767:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:returns to skill for high school graduates, but that demand for high school education would remain
19:549:40865:22:34:72:105:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:strong.
19:550:40872:34:14:99:512:631:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:It seems unlikely that the enviable status shown for graduates in 1892 to 1901 in respect
19:551:40961:14:13:99:512:617:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to occupations can be fully maintained now and in the future. To maintain it would re-
19:552:41047:13:14:99:512:604:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:quire that the favored occupations be practically closed to all but high school graduates.
19:553:41137:14:13:99:512:590:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:This may perhaps be taking place.  The supply of high school graduates is increasing
19:554:41221:13:14:99:512:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:so fast that any profession or reputable semi-profession may demand such. Even if it is
19:555:41308:14:13:99:512:563:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:not fully maintainedó indeed, even if there is a considerable movement downwardó the
19:556:41392:13:14:99:512:550:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:high school graduates will still have noteably high occupation status; the correlation
19:557:41478:14:14:99:512:536:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:between amount of education and dignity of occupation will still be close.  (Thorndike
19:558:41564:14:33:99:204:522:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and Symonds, p. 451)
19:559:41584:33:22:88:539:489:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:These changes in the function and curriculum of high schools had implications for teachers,
19:560:41675:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and they mirrored the changes in the larger labor market.  Teachers themselves were now more
19:561:41767:22:22:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:specialized than before.   Thorndike (1923) found that in a survey of teachers own interest in
19:562:41861:22:22:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:academic subjects that teachers themselves preferred courses with "modern" content such as science
19:563:41959:22:22:72:540:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and mathematics to literature.  He also noted that there were signiÖcant age di§erences in these
19:564:42055:22:22:72:540:379:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:academic interests. Older teachers, who themselves had been trained in "traditional" high schools,
19:565:42153:22:22:72:540:357:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:were more interested in Latin and English literature, while young teachers expressed strong interest
19:566:42253:22:22:72:540:335:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in physical and biological sciences. As students in high schools sought out these "modern" subjects
19:567:42352:22:22:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:more than "traditional" ones, the returns to education for teachers will reáect both derived demand
19:568:42451:22:22:72:513:291:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for skill and the same market forces that were operating in the labor market more generally.
19:569:42543:22:22:88:539:269:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The report we use was designed to uncover the relationship between experience, education, and
19:570:42636:22:22:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:wages among high school teachers.  It presents tabulated data on the (i) income, (ii) experience,
19:571:42733:22:21:72:540:225:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(iii) education, and (iv) gender of U.S. secondary school teachers in 1908, which was collected from
19:572:42833:21:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a survey corresponding to the 1906-1907 academic year. The data were collected via survey for
19:573:42926:22:22:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:approximately Öve thousand teachers, chosen to be a representative sample of the nationís secondary
19:574:43025:22:22:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:teaching workforce at the time and to be directly comparable across regions. While there are several
19:575:43125:22:22:72:540:138:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sources of data that list the education and experience of teachers in speciÖc localities and school
19:576:43224:22:22:72:540:116:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:districts, Thorndikeís goal of a nationally representative picture of the relationship makes his data
19:577:43325:22:22:72:540:94:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:unique ñ and it is the only source we know of that allows us to address the issue of geographic
19:578:43420:22:0:72:540:72:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:heterogeneity in returns to education at this time.  Indeed, Thorndike took great care to consider
20:579:43520:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and eliminate the regional and idiosyncratic biases in the data, and the report which accompanies
20:580:43617:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the data used here details many of the potential sources of error that he attempted to eliminate with
20:581:43718:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:his survey.  The Thorndike reportís systematic and consistent measures of education, experience,
20:582:43814:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and wages across space allows us to estimate geographic variation in the returns to education before

20:584:43930:22:22:88:539:599:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The data were collected using a two-part survey sent by the O¢ ce of Education to administrators
20:585:44026:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for a sample of secondary schools.  The Örst survey collected the salaries, years of secondary and
20:586:44124:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:post-secondary education, and actual years of experience of all teachers in the schools surveyed.
20:587:44221:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The fact that years of experience are directly reported is a major strength of the data, since
20:588:44315:22:22:72:539:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:imputed ìpotential years of experienceî (i.e., the traditionalage-years of  schooling-6) can
20:589:44407:22:22:71:539:489:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:diverge strongly from actual experience. This is particularly true for women, who are not as closely
20:590:44507:22:22:71:539:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tied to the labor force and who constituted a signiÖcant share of secondary school teachers at the
20:591:44605:22:21:71:539:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:time.11The second survey was a follow up survey sent with the intent of measuring any biases or
20:592:44700:21:22:71:539:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:measurement error in years of education (e.g., adding in primary schooling) and experience (e.g.,
20:593:44797:22:22:71:539:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reporting years of service at the particular school surveyed). Thorndike spent a great deal of e§ort
20:594:44897:22:22:71:539:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:discussing potential sources of measurement error and trying to quantify or minimize them. The
20:595:44991:22:22:71:539:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:second survey showed that the larger initial survey did not su§er from any aggregate biases.  The
20:596:45088:22:22:71:263:336:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:data we use comes from the Örst survey.
20:597:45127:22:22:88:539:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:In general, the data appear to be of extremely high quality. For example, Thorndike mentions
20:598:45219:22:22:71:539:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that income may vary somewhat due to varying lengths of the school year, such that low salaries
20:599:45314:22:22:71:539:270:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the South are partially explained by shorter school years. The data would nonetheless reáect
20:600:45409:22:22:71:539:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the actual income received. Thorndike also mentioned that private schools who underpay may feel
20:601:45504:22:22:71:539:226:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:pressure to overestimate their incomes. For years of education, the distinction between secondary
20:602:45601:22:22:71:539:204:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and post-secondary education was not always clear, but this will not a§ect our results since we look
20:603:45701:22:22:71:539:182:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:only at the sum of these two.  For experience, Thorndike mentioned a tendency to report roughly
20:604:45796:22:21:71:271:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and to include the current year of service.
20:605:45839:21:22:88:539:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Unfortunately, we do not have the original survey returns, only the processed data from the
20:606:45930:22:17:71:539:117:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:report.  We focus on two sets of tables (Tables 7-10 in the original Thorndike Report) for our
20:607:46024:17:15:80:539:100:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:11On the other hand, this does introduce a discrepancy between our estimates and estimates based on the more
20:608:46132:15:0:72:192:85:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:common potential experience.
21:609:46162:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:purposes. The Örst is individual public school teacher data tabulated separately for California,
21:610:46258:22:22:72:539:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Georgia, and Texas, and tabulated together for Illinois, Ohio and Wisconsin.12These states cover
21:611:46354:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the West Coast (California), Southwest (Texas), Southeast (Georgia), and Midwest (Illinois, Ohio
21:612:46450:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and Wisconsin). These tables allowed creation of a dataset of teachers including their state, gender,
21:613:46551:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:income, experience, and education levels. The second set of tables gives separate details on Illinois,
21:614:46653:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Ohio and Wisconsin teachers, but only provides the median income level for each experience-
21:615:46744:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:education-gender cell. This allows creation of a dataset of median incomes by gender, experience,
21:616:46841:22:22:72:539:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:education and state for all six states separately.13We combine this data with IPUMS data on the
21:617:46936:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:industrial composition of the workforce in 1910, 1920 and 1930, and later information on teachers
21:618:47033:22:38:72:329:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and workers earnings in Census records from 1940 on.
21:619:47085:38:29:72:213:473:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:3.2  Summary Analysis
21:620:47106:29:21:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 4 presents summary statistics for the individual data by state and gender. Several interesting
21:621:47206:21:22:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:observations can be gleaned from these.  First, secondary teachers averaged 12.6 to 13.8 years of
21:622:47303:22:22:72:540:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:education, having completed not much beyond high school education themselves. These low levels of
21:623:47400:22:22:72:540:379:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:education are of particular interest because they indicate that increased demand for more, and more
21:624:47499:22:22:72:540:357:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:modern schooling might have immediate e§ects on the derived demand for teachers education. Men
21:625:47593:22:22:72:540:335:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and women had similar levels of education with women having slightly more education on average
21:626:47687:22:22:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the Midwestern states, and men having a slight advantage in the other states. Education levels
21:627:47784:22:22:72:540:291:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are also fairly similar across states, with the exception of California, whose secondary teachers had
21:628:47885:22:22:72:278:269:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:an additional year of education on average.
21:629:47928:22:22:88:539:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Second, average salary levels vary greatly, both between men and women and across states.
21:630:48017:22:22:72:540:225:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:For example, men in California earn about three times what women in Georgia earn.  Salaries
21:631:48108:22:22:72:540:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in California are substantially higher (roughly $300/year or 35% higher) than in Georgia and the
21:632:48204:22:22:72:540:181:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Midwest states, while those in Texas are signiÖcantly lower (about $100/year or 12%).  Again,
21:633:48297:22:21:72:540:159:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:these wage patterns are in line with the patterns in output per worker, indicating that schooling
21:634:48394:21:16:72:540:138:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:wages reáected broader labor market conditions. As expected, women earn lower salaries in all
21:635:48487:16:11:80:454:122:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:12Thorndike explained that the data were calculated together because the data were similar.
21:636:48578:11:15:80:539:111:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:13All data from the tables was entered twice, in separate Öles, to assure accurtate data entry. The use of tabulated
21:637:48694:15:11:72:540:96:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:data does introduce additional sources of measurement error in the data as both income and experience are grouped
21:638:48807:11:11:72:540:85:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:into small ranges. Neither of these should substantially change our estimates of the returns to education, and indeed
21:639:48924:11:0:72:488:74:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:replicating the corresponding groupings in the U.S. census data does not alter the results substantially.
22:640:49031:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:states with the largest di§erence in Georgia and the smallest di§erences in the Midwestern states.
22:641:49129:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Beyond gender discrimination, a possible reason for this male wage premium is that a signiÖcant
22:642:49224:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:number of male secondary teachers performed a dual role of teacher and administrator. Thorndike
22:643:49319:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:notes this fact in his report, although we cannot distinguish in the data which teachers were also
22:644:49417:22:22:72:144:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:administrators.
22:645:49432:22:22:88:539:599:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Third, teachers average between 8.2 and 9.6 years of experience, with male teachers having
22:646:49522:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:on average 2.0 to 3.6 more years of experience. The additional years of experience may also be
22:647:49616:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:related to the previously-mentioned dual teacher-administrator role that males often play. Thus,
22:648:49712:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:experience levels were not particularly high, and there were likely many teachers with limited
22:649:49806:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:occupation speciÖc on-the-job training, who may have entertained options in the broader labor
22:650:49899:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:market. Finally, it should be noted that secondary teaching is a mixed-gender occupation.  For
22:651:49993:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the sample overall about half (Öfty Öve percent) of the teachers are men. In the Southern states
22:652:50089:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of Georgia and Texas, this is closer to 2/3 of teachers, while in California women constitute 2/3
22:653:50186:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of secondary school teachers in the data. Again, male teachers likely had more options for work
22:654:50281:22:38:72:165:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:outside of teaching.
22:655:50301:38:29:72:384:364:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:3.3  Regional Variation in the Returns to Education
22:656:50352:29:46:72:435:335:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We estimate the returns to education using a standard Mincerian regression
22:657:50426:46:33:206:405:289:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f4:log (w) =-+\f1s+\f2x+\f3x2+\f4g+"
22:658:50459:33:22:88:539:256:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:wherewis the wage of a person withsyears of schooling,xyears of experience, and gender
22:659:50545:22:22:72:539:234:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f2:g.  Table 5 presents the regression results for each of the states. The estimates show considerable
22:660:50644:22:22:72:539:212:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:geographic variation in the Mincerian return to schooling.14The three Midwestern states and Texas
22:661:50741:22:22:72:540:190:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:had high returns, 7.0 and 7.1 percent, respectively. Recall that the Midwestern states had high
22:662:50836:22:22:72:540:168:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:levels of industry, and so likely rapidly rising demand for skill, while Texas had a small educational
22:663:50938:22:22:72:540:146:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:endowment relative to its technological endowment. In contrast, the returns are much lower in
22:664:51031:22:16:72:540:124:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Georgia and especially California. The return in Georgia is just 3.3 percent which is signiÖcantly
22:665:51129:16:15:80:539:108:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:14We formally tested for di§erences in the regional returns to education in a pooled regression (unreported), in
22:666:51241:15:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:which we rejected the hypothesis of equal returns between the Midwest and South.  As the purpose of this study is
22:667:51354:11:10:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:to document the extent of the variation and to estimate the returns by region, we present the separate regressions
22:668:51468:10:0:72:120:72:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:throughout.
23:669:51481:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:di§erent from the returns in Texas and the Midwest states, despite the smaller sample size in
23:670:51574:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Georgia and the consequently larger standard error. This suggest that the low supply of educated
23:671:51670:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:labor and low demand for skill in Georgia combined to yield low returns to education. The return in
23:672:51769:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:California is a miniscule 0.5 percent and not statistically signiÖcant. Recall that California teachers
23:673:51872:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:averaged 1.2 more years of education than teachers in the other states, and that California had a
23:674:51969:22:22:72:404:599:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:large educational endowment relative to its technological endowment.
23:675:52037:22:22:88:539:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:As described in the previous section, the individual data for Illinois, Ohio and Wisconsin is
23:676:52130:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:pooled together. We do, however, have data on median incomes (by sex, education, and experience)
23:677:52226:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:separately for each of these three states. Regressions can therefore be run separately using median-
23:678:52326:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:level data for these three as a way to disaggregate the returns to education estimates.  A key
23:679:52420:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:question in interpreting this data is the extent to which estimates from median-level regressions are
23:680:52521:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:comparable to individual-level regression results. To answer this question, we construct comparable
23:681:52620:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:median-level data for the states that have individual data and compare regression results.  If
23:682:52714:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the estimates for the returns to education are similar in the median and individual regressions,
23:683:52810:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:then we would surmise that median regressions for the individual Midwestern states will give us
23:684:52905:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reliable estimates of the returns to education for each Midwestern state.   Table 6 shows that
23:685:52999:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:median regressions do in fact express much of the same information about returns to schooling
23:686:53092:22:22:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:that individual-regressions do and the qualitative interpretations remain the same. Focusing on
23:687:53187:22:22:72:540:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the schooling coe¢ cients, Mincerian returns are low in California and Georgia, and relatively high
23:688:53286:22:22:72:539:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:elsewhere.15We conclude that the qualitative patterns in the median-level estimates are strongly
23:689:53382:22:22:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:indicative of patterns in the individual-level estimates.  As such, we believe that estimates for the
23:690:53483:22:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:return to education for each Midwestern sate will not be biased by the median representation of
23:691:53578:22:22:72:115:226:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the data.
23:692:53587:22:22:88:539:204:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The median level estimates are presented separately for Illinois, Ohio and Wisconsin in Table
23:693:53680:22:22:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:7. The main lesson from Table 7 are that wage returns to schooling found in the Midwest using the
23:694:53777:22:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:individual-level data do not appear to be at the same high level across all three states. Mincerian
23:695:53876:21:16:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:returns are high in Illinois and Ohio, but much lower in Wisconsin. These lower Mincerian returns
23:696:53973:16:15:80:539:123:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:15Focusing on the constant term results, we see that constant terms are somewhat higher in the median regres-
23:697:54082:15:11:72:540:108:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:sions. The di§erence in levels is not surprising since the individual- and median-level regressions weight individuals
23:698:54200:11:11:72:540:97:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:di§erently; the median regressions give each experience-education cell equal weight, while the individual data use the
23:699:54318:11:11:72:540:86:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:weights in the sample population.  The patterns by sex across states also match up well. The one exception is that
23:700:54432:11:0:72:458:75:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:returns are typically lower for women in the median-level estimates and slightly higher for men.
24:701:54530:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:are accompanied by higher wage levels in Wisconsin, as evidence by the signiÖcantly larger intercept.
24:702:54631:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Thus, even amongst similar states in the same geographic region, there appear to be important
24:703:54724:22:22:72:254:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:di§erences in the returns to schooling.
24:704:54763:22:22:88:539:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Overall, there is substantial variation in the returns to education for these secondary teachers in
24:705:54862:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1909. The variation is consistent with the theory described in the previous section. As predicted,
24:706:54960:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the returns to education vary with the factor endowments. The Midwest, with its large endowment
24:707:55055:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of education, but also large and growing levels of capital and capital-intensive, skill-complementary
24:708:55156:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:technologies, had high returns to education.  The South, with its small factor endowments, had
24:709:55250:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:low returns to education.  California and Texas had similar levels of capital and capital-intensive
24:710:55349:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:technologies, but California had a much larger educational endowment. Consistent with a relative
24:711:55445:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:oversupply of skill, the relatively large educational endowment in California yields low returns to
24:712:55544:22:22:72:539:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:education, and the small educational endowment yields higher returns in Texas.16If these returns
24:713:55640:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to education are indicative of general returns to education for these regions the theory of U-shaped
24:714:55740:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:returns to education over the twentieth century would have to be augmented to reáect this regional
24:715:55838:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:heterogeneity.  In the next section we consider the generalizability and robustness of the results
24:716:55936:22:46:72:191:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:presented in this section.

24:718:55992:45:29:72:169:289:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:4.1  Robustness
24:719:56007:29:22:72:540:260:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:It is important to establish, Örst, that the returns reported above reáect the return to education
24:720:56105:22:22:72:540:238:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:across region and not another measure that varies by region such as teacher salary.  While Goldin
24:721:56202:22:22:72:540:216:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and Katz (2003) have ruled out compulsory schooling and child labor laws as sources of such
24:722:56293:22:22:72:540:194:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:di§erences, we must address the question of whether the returns to education for teachers reáect
24:723:56389:22:22:72:540:172:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:broader market conditions and not only the market for teachers.  If the returns simply reáected
24:724:56484:22:22:72:540:150:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:salary di§erences by region for teachers, we would not predict the very low returns in California
24:725:56581:22:21:72:540:128:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:given the substantially higher salaries in that state. Similarly, the high returns in Texas would not
24:726:56682:21:16:72:540:107:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:be consistent with the low salaries in that state and the similar years of schooling in Texas and in
24:727:56782:16:15:80:539:91:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:16Given the estimates of income per worker in the previous section, low returns in California could also partly be
24:728:56896:15:0:72:430:76:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:due to labor scarcity, which would raise the wages of the unskilled relative to the skilled.
25:729:56990:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the Midwestern states.  We believe that the extent to which the returns to education vary across
25:730:57086:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:regions in ways that are not predicted by the summary statistics in Table 4 establishes that the
25:731:57182:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:returns reported here are indeed estimates of the return to education and not simply teacher salary
25:732:57281:22:22:72:180:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:variation across states.
25:733:57305:22:22:88:539:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We have argued that the geographic variation uncovered in teacherís returns to schooling is
25:734:57396:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:indicative of variation in returns in the overall labor force. We use two checks to test the robustness
25:735:57499:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:of this assumption.  First, we estimate the returns for men only.  We divide the sample by gender
25:736:57596:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for two reasons.  First, women teachers may have had fewer outside options in the broader labor
25:737:57691:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:market.  Competition for their services may not have been strong enough for teacherís returns to
25:738:57787:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reáect returns overall. Men would have been more integrated into the market, however, and would
25:739:57882:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:have had fewer restrictions placed on their supply of labor. Secondly, Carter and Savoca (1991)
25:740:57977:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:have suggested that di§erent levels of education and wages by gender were due to the fact that
25:741:58071:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:women were expected to be less attached to the labor market than males, making it unwise to invest
25:742:58169:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:heavily in education and lowering the wages that they received in the labor market. Although this
25:743:58266:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:point is related to the Örst, it also suggest that the education of women in teaching occupations
25:744:58363:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:would be di§erent from those of men, which was shown earlier.  To the extent that variation in
25:745:58457:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:schooling identiÖes the returns to education in a Mincerian regression, separating the sample by
25:746:58553:22:22:72:322:336:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:gender would tell us if the total returns were biased.
25:747:58607:22:22:88:539:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Second, we estimate the returns for teachers with few years of experience. We focus on teachers
25:748:58702:22:22:72:540:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with little experience because these teachers would presumably have invested less in teacher-speciÖc
25:749:58802:22:22:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:human capital, and so would hold relatively more general human capital for potential use in the
25:750:58897:22:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:broader labor market.  As we noted earlier, younger teachers were more likely to be skilled in
25:751:58991:22:22:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:science and mathematics, and thus were di§erent in training and orientation than older teachers.
25:752:59087:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The general idea is that the returns to education for teachers with more experience in teaching
25:753:59182:22:22:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:may not reáect labor market conditions as much as they would reáect occupation or Örm-speciÖc
25:754:59275:22:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:investments or skills.  We also posit that teachers with less experience also have more and varied
25:755:59373:21:22:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:outside options.  We take ìlittle experienceî to be Öve years or less in the teaching profession.
25:756:59470:22:22:72:540:117:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Considering that teachers in the sample averaged more than eight years of experience, this cut-
25:757:59565:22:22:72:540:95:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:o§ certainly captures the less experienced teachers while at the same time being a large enough
25:758:59660:22:0:72:540:73:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sample to yield robust estimates of the returns to education for the group of teachers with the least
26:759:59763:0:22:72:212:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:attachment to the profession.
26:760:59792:22:22:88:539:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 8 shows that the pattern in overall returns shows up in menís returns as well (despite
26:761:59884:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the fact that women were an important fraction of teachers) and in returns for the young. The
26:762:59977:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:returns in California and Georgia are low, while those in the Midwest and Texas were high. These
26:763:60073:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:results further support the contention that our estimates of the return to education do not simply
26:764:60171:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:reáect regional salary di§erentials.  The returns for men in Georgia would be higher than those
26:765:60266:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in Table 8 if their high salaries and the same average schooling, as reported in Table 4, were used
26:766:60365:22:22:72:540:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to predict the return to education. Overall, the results of Table 8 give us further conÖdence that
26:767:60463:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the geographic variation in teachersíreturns to schooling reáect geographic variation in schooling
26:768:60561:22:38:72:225:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:returns of the workforce overall.
26:769:60594:38:29:72:346:473:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:4.2  Generalizability and Secular Implications
26:770:60640:29:21:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Applying the evidence for secondary teachers to our story of relative endowments in the overall
26:771:60735:21:22:72:540:423:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:economy raises the question of whether these estimated returns to education are informative about
26:772:60832:22:22:72:540:401:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the returns to education in the labor force overall. SpeciÖcally, does variation in teachersíreturns
26:773:60932:22:22:72:540:379:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to education track with the variation in returns to education of the overall labor force?  What can
26:774:61031:22:22:72:540:357:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:these data tell us about the overall returns to schooling in 1909 relative to 1940? To answer these
26:775:61130:22:22:72:540:335:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:questions we must look at comparisons of teachers with workers more generally in the U.S. We
26:776:61222:22:22:72:540:313:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:use IPUMS census data to conÖrm the relationship between teacherís returns and overall returns
26:777:61316:22:22:72:540:291:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:over time, and then compare our 1909 results with later results. One caveat is that the census
26:778:61410:22:22:72:540:269:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:occupational code for teachers includes all teachers (except for professors/instructors and music,
26:779:61508:22:22:72:540:247:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:dance or art teachers), and not just secondary teachers. To the extent that education selects people
26:780:61608:22:22:72:540:225:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:into higher paying secondary school teaching, the IPUMS data will overstate the return to schooling
26:781:61707:22:22:72:353:203:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f2:withinsecondary education and thus exceed our estimates.
26:782:61763:22:22:88:539:181:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Figure 1 answers the question about secular variation, showing that the relationship between
26:783:61855:22:21:72:543:159:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:teachersíreturns and overall returns is strong over time. The four di§erent series represent teachersí
26:784:61957:21:22:72:540:138:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:returns for the states we examine, teachersíreturns for all states, overall returns for the states we
26:785:62058:22:22:72:540:116:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:examine, and overall returns for the nation as a whole. Again the number of teachers in the sample
26:786:62156:22:17:72:539:94:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:states is relatively few (especially in the 1950 census), so we present robust regression results.17All
26:787:62259:17:0:80:539:77:6:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:17Robust regressions incorporate a recursive algorithm for reweighting observations that downweights outliers that
27:788:62375:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:four series move substantially together with a mid-century decline followed by rising returns. Indeed,
27:789:62477:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the results for all workers across the nation and all workers in the sample states are nearly identical.
27:790:62581:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:While the estimates of teachersíreturns in the sample states have perhaps the weakest relationship
27:791:62679:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with overall returns across the nation, the relationship is still quite strong. The correlation between
27:792:62782:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the two series is 0.81 and a regression of overall returns on teachersíreturns in the sample states
27:793:62881:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:explains 66 percent of the variation in overall returns. We therefore again conclude that comparing
27:794:62980:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:teachersíreturns over time can give us a strong indication of patterns in overall returns over time.
27:795:63080:22:22:88:539:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Table 9 does precisely this, comparing the 1909 return to several benchmarks from the 1940
27:796:63170:22:22:72:540:533:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:census. The 1909 return is based on a weighted regression of the individual data in 1909. Since the
27:797:63269:22:22:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:sample sizes varied greatly over region and were not entirely representative, the weights were chosen
27:798:63370:22:22:72:540:489:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to make the sample representative of the sample of teachers in 1940. This required weighting the
27:799:63466:22:22:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:California sample by a factor of 1.92, the Georgia sample by a factor of 1.94, and the Texas sample
27:800:63565:22:21:72:540:445:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:by a factor of 1.74, and weighting the Midwest sample by a factor of 0.59. The resulting estimate
27:801:63662:21:22:72:540:424:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:for the return to education was 8.3 percent in 1909. At Örst glance, the returns seem quite high for
27:802:63762:22:22:72:540:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:a within-occupation return to schooling.  Comparing with 1940, however, the return is not overly
27:803:63858:22:22:72:540:380:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:high. Indeed it is slightly less than the Mincerian return of 9.1 percent estimated for teachers in
27:804:63957:22:22:72:540:358:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:these same states in 1940 though not signiÖcantly di§erent. The returns for all workers in these
27:805:64053:22:22:72:540:336:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:states were somewhat higher at 9.6 percent per year in 1940, while those for the nation overall were
27:806:64153:22:22:72:208:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:slightly lower at 8.9 percent.
27:807:64183:22:22:88:539:292:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Using 1940 as a benchmark, we would surmise that since the return to schooling for teachers
27:808:64274:22:22:72:540:270:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the sample states was representative of the returns to workers for the nation overall, that the
27:809:64372:22:22:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:same is true for 1909. In this case, returns in 1909 would be relatively high (since 1940 preceded
27:810:64470:22:22:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the Great Compression and was a year of relatively high returns to schooling), but lower than the
27:811:64567:22:22:72:540:204:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:most comparable evidence, the returns in Iowa in 1914. Recall the caveat that the returns from
27:812:64661:22:22:72:540:182:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1940 are for all teachers, not just secondary teachers. The 1940 teachersíregressions include both
27:813:64759:22:21:72:540:160:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:primary and secondary teachers, while the 1909 estimates are based on only secondary teachers.
27:814:64853:21:22:72:540:139:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Secondary teachers tend to be more educated and substantially better paid. To the extent that
27:815:64946:22:20:72:540:117:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:schooling enables teachers to sort into higher paying secondary education jobs, the 1940 estimates
27:816:65044:20:11:72:540:97:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:have too strong an ináuence on regression results. Robust regressions produced substantially lower estimates than
27:817:65157:11:11:72:540:86:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:OLS in 1950 (0.075 vs. 0.096), but otherwise similar results. Robust regression also has little e§ect on the 1909
27:818:65270:11:0:72:143:75:9:g_d0_f2:9:g_d0_f2:sample estimates.
28:819:65289:0:46:72:495:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:would be biased upward as an estimate of the return to education of secondary teachers.
28:820:65376:46:33:72:174:663:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:5  Conclusion
28:821:65389:33:22:72:540:630:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We have presented evidence that di§erential factor endowments and prevalence of technologies are
28:822:65485:22:21:72:540:608:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:important parts of the story of how skill biased technical change the returns to education.  In
28:823:65580:21:22:72:540:587:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:our model of skill biased technical change, we showed how returns to education vary with factor
28:824:65675:22:22:72:540:565:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:endowments. We have argued that the shape of these changes over time will be related to factor
28:825:65769:22:22:72:540:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:endowments before the skill-biased technical change.   Our model predicted that regions with
28:826:65861:22:22:72:540:521:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:greater degrees of capital intensity would experience higher returns to education than those with
28:827:65958:22:22:72:540:499:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:less capital intensive endowments.  With skill biased technical change, we should expect U-shaped
28:828:66055:22:22:72:540:477:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:returns in regions with large capital endowments, but steadily increasing returns in regions with
28:829:66152:22:22:72:245:455:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:relatively small capital endowments.
28:830:66188:22:22:88:539:433:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:We have shown, using historical evidence on the returns to education for secondary teachers
28:831:66279:22:22:72:540:411:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:in the U.S., that the returns to education showed marked geographic variation.  Our data on the
28:832:66374:22:22:72:540:389:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:returns to skill for secondary teachers in the very earliest part of the twentieth century is consistent
28:833:66478:22:22:72:540:367:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with our theoretical predictions.  Teachers in the Midwest had greater returns to education than
28:834:66574:22:22:72:540:345:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:those in the South.  Furthermore, we found that this result is robust ñ the returns to teachers
28:835:66669:22:21:72:540:323:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:tracks with the returns to skill more generally, and our result was robust to considering only men
28:836:66767:21:22:72:540:302:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:and younger teachers.  In sum, we Önd strong evidence that returns to education were large in
28:837:66860:22:22:72:540:280:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:1909 in the Midwest, consistent with Goldin and Katz, but that they may have varied considerably
28:838:66956:22:22:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:across states.  As such, the study of U-shaped returns to education should be modiÖed to reáect
28:839:67051:22:22:72:532:236:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:the fact that returns for some regions would rise continuously throughout the twentieth century.
28:840:67147:22:22:88:539:214:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:The variation in returns to education has important implications for the study of the returns
28:841:67240:22:22:72:540:192:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:to skill more generally, and for education and immigration policies in many developing nations in
28:842:67337:22:22:72:540:170:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:particular. Rather than states or regions of one nation, our model easily generalizes up to di§erent
28:843:67437:22:22:72:540:148:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:nations or down to individual cities with su¢ ciently segmented factor markets, where locations
28:844:67532:22:22:72:540:126:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:with large capital endowments will see large returns to education, while those with relatively small
28:845:67632:22:22:72:540:104:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:capital endowments will see small returns initially. For example, Uwaifo (2006) notes considerable
28:846:67730:22:0:72:540:82:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:debate over the size and shape of returns to education in Sub-Saharan Africa, with most anecdotal
29:847:67829:0:22:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:evidence pointing to low returns.  Her estimates of the return to education in Nigeria in the 1990s
29:848:67928:22:22:72:540:687:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:(3.6%) are similar to the returns we found in Georgia in 1909.  Our results suggest that while skill
29:849:68028:22:22:72:540:665:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:biased technological change will eventually lead to universal large returns to skill in the long run
29:850:68128:22:22:72:540:643:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:as markets integrate and capital intensity di§uses, in the short run locations with relatively small
29:851:68228:22:22:72:540:621:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:capital endowments may see negligible returns to education.  This has important implications for
29:852:68324:22:22:72:540:599:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:immigration, emigration, and urban policies in locations with small factor endowments ñto create
29:853:68420:22:22:72:540:577:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:incentives for the high-skilled workforce to remain when the returns to education are low at home,
29:854:68518:22:0:72:249:555:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:but large in other parts of the world.
