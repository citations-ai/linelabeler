2:32:1670:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:We  study  the  design  of  provider  incentives  in  the  post-acute  care  setting –  a  high-stakes  but 
2:33:1778:14:14:72:545:574:12:Times:12:Times:under-studied segment of the healthcare system. We focus on long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) 
2:34:1870:14:14:72:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:and  the  large  (approximately$13,000)  jump  in  Medicare  payments  they  receive  when  a  patient's 
2:35:1975:14:14:72:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:stay  reaches  a  threshold  number of  days.  The  descriptive  evidence  indicates  that  discharges 
2:36:2077:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:increase  substantially  after  the  threshold, and  that  the  marginal  patient  discharged  after  the 
2:37:2182:14:14:72:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:threshold  is  in  relatively  better  health.  Despite  the large  financial  incentives  and  behavioral 
2:38:2288:14:14:72:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:response  in  a  high  mortality  population,  we  are  unable  to detect  any  compelling  evidence  of  an 
2:39:2396:14:14:72:546:490:12:Times:12:Times:impact on patient mortality. To assess provider behavior under counterfactual payment schedules, 
2:40:2492:14:14:72:546:476:12:Times:12:Times:we  estimate  a  simple  dynamic  discrete  choice  model  of  LTCH discharge  decisions.  When  we 
2:41:2591:14:14:72:546:462:12:Times:12:Times:conservatively limit ourselves to alternative contracts that hold the LTCH harmless, we find that 
2:42:2688:14:14:72:546:448:12:Times:12:Times:an alternative contract can generate Medicare savings of about $2,100 per admission, or about 5% 
2:43:2784:14:14:72:545:434:12:Times:12:Times:of  total  payments.  More  aggressive  payment  reforms  can  generate  substantially  greater savings, 
2:44:2888:14:14:72:546:420:12:Times:12:Times:but the accompanying reduction in LTCH profits has potential out-of-sample consequences. Our 
2:45:2980:14:14:72:545:406:12:Times:12:g_d0_f1:results  highlight  how  improved  financial  incentives  may  be  able  to  reduce  healthcare  spending, 
2:46:3086:14:28:72:399:392:12:Times:12:Times:without negative consequences for industry profits or patient health.

3:68:3525:0:28:71:175:708:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:1  Introduction
3:69:3540:28:16:71:534:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Healthcare spending is one of the largest scal challenges facing the U.S. federal government. In
3:70:3637:16:16:71:536:664:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:2014, the U.S. federal government spent $1.1 trillion on public healthcareprograms (BEA, 2015)
3:71:3731:16:16:71:535:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and the CBO projects that spending will grow to $2.0 trillion by 2026 (CBO, 2016). Within the
3:72:3824:16:17:71:534:632:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:healthcare system, post-acute care (PAC) is an under-studied sector, with large stakes for both
3:73:3919:17:16:71:205:615:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:spending and patient health.
3:74:3947:16:16:88:534:599:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Post-acute care is the term used for formal care provided to help patients recover from a surgery
3:75:4044:16:16:71:537:583:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:or some other acute care event. Medicare spending on PAC is substantial, about $60 billion in 2013,
3:76:4143:16:17:71:534:567:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:or about 20% more than the much-studied Medicare Part D program. PAC spending isgrowing
3:77:4230:17:16:71:535:550:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:faster than overall Medicare spending. PAC spending accounts for almost three-quarters of the
3:78:4323:16:16:71:536:534:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:unexplained geographic variation in Medicare spending (Newhouse et al., 2013). The quality of
3:79:4416:16:16:71:537:518:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:post-acute care has potentially important consequences for patient health;over 40% of hospital
3:80:4510:16:17:71:535:502:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:patients are discharged to PAC, and PAC patients are high-risk, with 15% ofMedicare deaths
3:81:4600:17:16:71:278:485:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:involving a PAC stay in the prior 30 days.1
3:82:4643:16:16:88:535:469:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In this paper, we study the impact of provider nancial incentivesin determining patient ows
3:83:4736:16:16:71:537:453:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and government spending in the Medicare PAC system. The PAC setting isattractive for several
3:84:4828:16:17:71:534:437:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:reasons.  First, given its scal importance, understanding the e¤ects of nancial incentives is a
3:85:4925:17:16:71:537:420:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:natural area for inquiry. Second, the institutional setting  involving multiple interlocking and po-
3:86:5026:16:16:71:535:404:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tentially substitutable settings that operate under di¤erent reimbursement regimes  suggests that
3:87:5124:16:16:71:535:388:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:nancial incentives may have rst order consequences. Third, ine¢ciencies in the PAC sector have
3:88:5220:16:17:71:534:372:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:potentially important implications for public health, given that PAC patients are disproportionately
3:89:5320:17:16:71:444:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:high-risk and might be more vulnerable to ine¢ciencies in the delivery of care.
3:90:5399:16:16:88:535:339:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Our analysis focuses on patients whose point of entry into the PAC system is an LTCH.2We
3:91:5487:16:16:71:537:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:focus on LTCH patients because of the sharp variation in provider incentives at this type of facility.
3:92:5589:16:17:71:536:307:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This is illustrated in Figure 1: providers are reimbursed a daily amount (of approximately $1,300)
3:93:5687:17:16:71:535:290:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:up to a threshold number of days, at which point there is a large (approximately $13,000 on average)
3:94:5787:16:16:71:535:274:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:increase in payments for keeping a patient an additional day beyond the threshold, but no payments
3:95:5885:16:17:71:535:258:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for any days beyond it. We investigate the e¤ects of this jump in payments at the threshold using
3:96:5984:17:16:71:534:241:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:detailed Medicare claims and administrative data on the universe of LTCH stays over the 2007-2012
3:97:6081:16:16:71:534:225:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:period, when this non-linear payment schedule was in e¤ect, as well asthe 2000-2002 period, when
3:98:6177:16:16:71:502:209:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:LTCHs were instead reimbursed under a linear (i.e., constant per-diem) payment schedule.
3:99:6265:16:17:88:535:193:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We start by presenting descriptive evidence on the e¤ect of the jump in payments. Discharges
3:100:6357:17:16:71:530:176:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:respond strongly to the payment increase, with the share of stays discharged increasing from 2%
3:101:6452:16:16:71:535:160:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to 9% at precisely the day of the jump. The marginal patient discharged at the threshold appears
3:102:6548:16:18:71:536:144:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to be much healthier than the average dischargee prior to the threshold. At the threshold, pa-
3:103:6642:18:17:84:537:126:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:1These statistics are taken from MedPAC (2004), MedPAC (2015a), and MedPAC (2015b), with the exception of
3:104:6747:17:10:71:392:109:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:the statistic on deaths which we calculate using the data described in Section 2.
3:105:6828:10:17:84:536:99:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:2The acronym LTCH is typically pronounced el-tack, presumably reecting the fact that LTCHs are sometimes
3:106:6935:17:0:71:437:82:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:referred to as long-term acute care hospitals (LTACs), which is pronounced in this manner.
4:107:7026:0:17:71:535:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tients are disproportionately more likely to be discharged to a lessintensive PAC facility or home
4:108:7124:17:16:71:535:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(downstream) than to an acute care hospital (upstream); they also have substantially lower
4:109:7218:16:16:71:381:675:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:post-discharge mortality than patients discharged on earlier days.
4:110:7284:16:16:88:535:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A natural question raised by this evidence is whether distortions inthe timing of discharge have
4:111:7380:16:17:71:535:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:an impact on patient health. Given the high baseline mortality rate for LTCHpatients (30% die
4:112:7473:17:16:71:534:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:within 90 days of LTCH admission), if the distortions are harmful, it seems plausible that we could
4:113:7572:16:16:71:537:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:detect an e¤ect.  Empirical analysis is challenging, however, because unlike discharge behavior,
4:114:7668:16:17:71:345:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:mortality e¤ects may not appear right at the threshold.
4:115:7725:17:16:88:536:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The available evidence shows no compelling evidence of any mortality e¤ects from the distortions
4:116:7821:16:16:72:534:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in discharge behavior. We nd no evidence of a change in the level or the slope of the mortality
4:117:7917:16:16:72:535:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:hazard in the vicinity of the threshold. We provide an additional informative contrast by comparing
4:118:8016:16:17:72:536:529:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for-prot and non-prot LTCHs. We show that while both types of hospitals have similar payment
4:119:8110:17:16:72:534:512:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:schedules, the behavioral response in discharges is much stronger for for-prot hospitals. Despite
4:120:8208:16:16:72:534:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the larger behavioral response at the threshold, we nd no indicationof a mortality impact even
4:121:8303:16:16:72:196:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for the for-prot hospitals.
4:122:8331:16:17:88:532:464:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:While these results provide no smoking gun evidence of patient harm, they do not allow
4:123:8419:17:16:72:535:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:us to comprehensively rule out a mortality e¤ect. We cannot, for instance, rule out an e¤ect for
4:124:8515:16:16:72:536:431:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:every type of patient or at each and every hospital, and we cannot rule outadverse health e¤ects
4:125:8611:16:16:72:535:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that would not manifest in higher mortality rates. However, at minimum,we do not detect robust
4:126:8705:16:17:72:535:399:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:enough mortality e¤ect that would allow us to use the jump in payments toestimate how LTCHs
4:127:8796:17:16:72:534:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:trade o¤ prots and patient health. Indeed, the results suggest that the marginal patients are able
4:128:8895:16:16:72:533:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to receive similar care whether they are located in an LTCH or in their alternative setting, which
4:129:8993:16:16:72:504:350:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:empirically is usually a less intensive PAC facility such as a Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF).
4:130:9087:16:17:88:536:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Another natural question raised by the descriptive evidence on discharge behavior at the thresh-
4:131:9183:17:16:72:537:317:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:old is how providers respond to the payment schedule on days further from the threshold. Likewise,
4:132:9281:16:16:72:537:301:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the descriptive analysis does not provide a natural way to gauge the magnitude of provider response,
4:133:9381:16:16:72:537:285:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:or to estimate how treatment patterns and Medicare payments would be a¤ected by counterfactual
4:134:9475:16:17:72:161:269:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:payment schedules.
4:135:9493:17:16:88:536:252:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To address these questions, we specify and estimate a dynamic model of LTCH discharge behav-
4:136:9585:16:16:72:536:236:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ior. In our model, patients are characterized by their health, which evolves stochastically over time.
4:137:9687:16:16:72:536:220:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:LTCHs face a (daily) decision of whether to retain the patient or discharge her to another facility.
4:138:9787:16:17:72:534:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The LTCHs objective function includes both net revenue (Medicare payments net of costs) and
4:139:9879:17:16:72:536:187:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:patient utility. If the patient is discharged from the LTCH, the provider receives zero net revenue,
4:140:9979:16:16:72:536:171:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:but internalizes at least a portion of the patient utility from beingtreated in an alternative loca-
4:141:10079:16:17:72:536:155:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tion. If the LTCH keeps the patient, it receives net revenue that depends on Medicares payment
4:142:10174:17:16:72:535:138:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:schedule, while also accounting for the patients utility from being treated in the LTCH and the
4:143:10270:16:16:72:535:122:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:option value of making a similar discharge decision the following day. The provider therefore faces
4:144:10369:16:16:72:282:106:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a standard dynamic discrete choice problem.
4:145:10412:16:17:88:534:90:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We estimate the model by simulated method of moments to match the observed discharge and
4:146:10500:17:0:72:535:73:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:mortality patterns under the linear and non-linear payment schedules.To take advantage of the
5:147:10594:0:17:71:535:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:variation provided by the sharp jump in payments, we assign greater weights to moments that are
5:148:10689:17:16:71:401:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:close to the jump. The estimated model ts the data reasonably well.
5:149:10757:16:16:88:535:675:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We use the model and the estimated parameters to investigate the e¤ects of alternative contracts
5:150:10853:16:16:71:535:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that  like the observed contract  have a daily reimbursement rate up to a cap but that  unlike
5:151:10950:16:17:71:537:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the observed contract  do not have a jump in payments at a threshold day.We nd, for example,
5:152:11044:17:16:71:535:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that if we were to lower the xed payment to eliminate the jump in payments at the threshold, we
5:153:11140:16:16:71:536:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:would reduce total payments per admission for the episode of care by 25% on average, or about
5:154:11233:16:17:71:535:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:$13,000 per admission. However, such a payment schedule substantially reduces LTCH revenue
5:155:11323:17:16:71:535:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and estimated prots, and therefore may have out-of-sample impacts on LTCH behavior that our
5:156:11415:16:16:71:456:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimates would not capture, such as induced LTCH exit or lower service quality.
5:157:11495:16:16:88:536:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We therefore also engage in a more conservative set of counterfactuals in which we restrict
5:158:11586:16:17:71:536:529:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:attention to alternative contracts that would hold the LTCH harmless iftheir behavior did not
5:159:11679:17:16:71:536:512:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:change. Specically, we consider the set of contracts that hold LTCHs revenue constant under their
5:160:11777:16:16:71:535:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:observed discharge schedule. Thus, if we apply this schedule and ittriggers behavioral response
5:161:11872:16:16:71:534:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:by LTCHs then they must be better o¤. Using our estimated model, we are ableto identify a
5:162:11961:16:17:71:536:464:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:broad set of win-win payment schedules that reduce Medicare payments and, by construction,
5:163:12053:17:16:71:535:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:leave LTCHs (weakly) better o¤.3The contract that generates the largest savings reduces Medicare
5:164:12149:16:16:71:535:431:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:payments for the episode of care by 4.5%, and increases LTCH prots by 5.1%. Interestingly, this
5:165:12245:16:16:71:534:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:reduction in Medicare payments is slightly larger than the reduction from changes in organization
5:166:12342:16:17:71:535:399:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:form; our model estimates imply that if all LTCHs behaved like non-prots rather than all LTCHs
5:167:12438:17:16:71:512:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:behaving like for-prots  Medicare payments per episode of care would be reduced by 2.9%.
5:168:12528:16:16:88:536:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Our paper relates to a large literature examining how healthcare spending responds to nancial
5:169:12622:16:16:71:535:350:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:incentives.  Given the importance of healthcare spending in the economy and in public sector
5:170:12714:16:17:71:534:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:budgets, the existence of this large literature is not surprising.What is surprising  and arguably
5:171:12813:17:16:71:535:317:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:unfortunate from this perspective  is that the vast majority of thisliterature (including much of our
5:172:12915:16:16:71:536:301:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:own work) has focused on the impact ofconsumernancial incentives, such as deductibles and co-
5:173:13009:16:16:71:534:285:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:payments, with relatively less attention to the impact ofprovidernancial incentives.4The majority
5:174:13107:16:17:71:534:269:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of healthcare spending, however, is accounted for by a small share of high-cost individuals whose
5:175:13204:17:16:71:537:252:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:spending is largely in the catastrophic range where deductibles and co-payments no longer bind,
5:176:13301:16:16:71:530:236:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and thus consumer cost-sharing is likely to have little impact relativeto provider-side incentives.
5:177:13400:16:16:88:534:220:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The relative lack of research on the provider side presumably reects the di¢culties in nding
5:178:13494:16:17:71:535:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:clean variation in incentives to model and study. Perhaps not surprisingly, the sharp incentives
5:179:13590:17:18:71:533:187:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:created by the current LTCH payment schedule have already received some attention in both
5:180:13679:18:17:84:536:169:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:3Given the lack of compelling evidence of mortality e¤ects atthe threshold, it seems reasonable to assume that
5:181:13789:17:10:71:509:152:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:mortality impacts are also unlikely to be rst-order under these LTCH held harmless alternative contracts.
5:182:13897:10:17:84:536:142:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:4The literature on the impact of consumer incentives (moralhazard) in health insurance is too vast to try to
5:183:14007:17:13:72:536:125:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:summarize or cite here. Existing work on provider-side incentives has focused on descriptive evidence that providers
5:184:14123:13:13:72:537:112:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:do respond to incentives, with much of the evidence coming from the response to the introduction of the Inpatient
5:185:14236:13:13:72:537:99:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:Prospective Payment System in 1983 (Cutler and Zeckhauser (2000) provide a review of this evidence). More recently,
5:186:14351:13:0:72:522:86:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:Clemens and Gottlieb (2014) provide a rare look at the behavioral response of physicians to nancial incentives.
6:187:14464:0:17:71:533:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:academic (Kim et al., 2015) and popular (Weaver et al., 2015) spheres. Our descriptive work on
6:188:14558:17:16:71:535:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:discharges around the threshold is quite similar to this prior work,while our descriptive analysis
6:189:14656:16:16:71:535:675:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the health of the marginal dischargee and our exploration of mortality e¤ects is new.  Our
6:190:14749:16:16:71:535:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:paper is most closely related to Eliason et al. (2016) who  in independentwork  also study the
6:191:14845:16:17:71:536:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:impact of the LTCH payment schedule on discharge behavior descriptively and through the lens of
6:192:14940:17:16:71:536:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a dynamic model. Where comparable, the results are broadly similar to ours;however they focus
6:193:15033:16:16:71:536:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:more on heterogeneity in provider responses and, unlike us, do not analyze patient mortality or
6:194:15128:16:17:71:211:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:post-discharge healthcare use.
6:195:15158:17:16:88:536:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Finally, from a more conceptual perspective, our paper is related to a growing literature that
6:196:15252:16:16:71:536:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:seeks to interpret descriptive evidence of the behavioral responses to non-linear payment schedules
6:197:15351:16:16:71:535:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(bunching) through the lens of economic models that allow for assessments ofbehavior under
6:198:15443:16:17:71:526:529:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:counterfactual schedules (e.g., Chetty et al., 2011; Einav et al., 2015; Manoliand Weber, 2017).
6:199:15539:17:16:88:532:512:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides some background on the PAC
6:200:15627:16:16:71:534:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sector, LTCHs, and our data. In Section 3, we describe the discharge and mortality patterns around
6:201:15725:16:16:71:535:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the jump in payments. Section 4 presents the model, discusses estimation, and presents the results
6:202:15823:16:38:71:289:464:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from our counterfactuals. Section 5 concludes.
6:203:15869:38:28:71:205:426:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:2  Setting and data
6:204:15888:28:23:71:311:398:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:2.1  Post-acute care in the United States
6:205:15929:23:16:71:535:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Post-acute care (PAC) is the term for rehabilitation and palliative services provided to patients
6:206:16026:16:17:71:533:359:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:recovering from an acute care hospital stay. In the United States, theCenter for Medicaid and
6:207:16119:17:16:71:535:342:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Medicare Services (CMS) associates PAC with three types of facilities  long-term care hospitals
6:208:16215:16:16:71:535:326:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(LTCHs), skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), and inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs)  as well as
6:209:16318:16:16:71:534:310:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:care at home provided by home health agencies (HHAs) (MedPAC, 2015b). In 2013, Medicare paid
6:210:16410:16:17:71:537:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:$60 billion to PAC providers, approximately 16% of the $368 billion paid that year for Traditional
6:211:16508:17:16:71:537:277:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Medicare (TM) claims (MedPAC, 2015a). This is about 20% larger than spending in Traditional
6:212:16599:16:16:71:343:261:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Medicare on the much-studied Medicare Part D program.
6:213:16652:16:16:88:534:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In recent years, the geographic variation and growth rate of spending onPAC have raised
6:214:16739:16:17:72:532:229:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:concerns about the e¢ciency of the sector. From 2001 to 2013, Medicare spending on PAC grew
6:215:16830:17:16:72:536:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:at an annual rate of 6.1%, 2 percentage points higher than the rate of total spending growth for
6:216:16926:16:16:72:535:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:TM (The Boards of Trustees for Medicare, 2002 and 2014; MedPAC, 2015a). A recent Institute
6:217:17016:16:17:72:534:180:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of Medicine report found that, despite accounting for only 16% of spending, PAC contributed to
6:218:17110:17:16:72:534:163:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a striking 73% of the unexplained geographic variation in spending, suggesting that there may be
6:219:17206:16:16:72:366:147:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:substantial ine¢ciencies in the sector (Newhouse et al., 2013).
6:220:17269:16:16:88:536:131:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:It is useful to think about patients generally owing downstream through the healthcare sys-
6:221:17363:16:17:71:536:115:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tem. Upon experiencing an acute health event, they enter a regular Acute Care Hospital (ACH);
6:222:17456:17:16:71:536:98:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from there they may enter a PAC facility to recover, and eventuallygo home once they are suf-
6:223:17549:16:0:71:533:82:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ciently healthy and can function independently. Some ACH patientsskip the PAC stay and
7:224:17639:0:17:71:534:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:return home directly from the ACH, and some patients occasionally relapseand move upstream
7:225:17731:17:16:71:246:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from a PAC facility back to an ACH.
7:226:17766:16:16:88:536:675:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The top panel of Figure 2 gives a sense of transitions among ACHs, PAC facilities (LTCHs,
7:227:17855:16:16:71:535:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:SNFs, and IRFs), home (including HHAs), and death (including hospice).(Throughout the rest
7:228:17945:16:17:71:535:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the paper, we use the term PAC facilities to refer to LTCHs, SNFs, andIRFs, because these
7:229:18037:17:16:71:535:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are facilities that provide in-house care, in contrast to HHAs, whichprovide care at the patients
7:230:18135:16:16:71:535:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:home.) In our data, described below, 26% of patients who are discharged from an ACH receive
7:231:18226:16:17:71:532:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:follow-up care from a PAC facility.5From these PAC facilities, 60% of patients continue to ow
7:232:18320:17:16:71:533:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:home, where they may still receive treatment from an HHA, while 33% are discharged back to an
7:233:18413:16:16:71:410:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ACH. The remaining 7% of discharges are to a hospice or due to death.
7:234:18482:16:16:88:537:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Just like the natural ow of patients into and out of the PAC system, there is also a general
7:235:18575:16:17:71:536:529:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ordering of care within it. LTCHs provide the most intensive care,SNFs and IRFs provide less
7:236:18667:17:16:71:535:512:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:intensive care, and HHAs provide the least intensive bundle of medicalservices. Severity of Illness
7:237:18766:16:16:71:535:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(SOI) categories are a commonly used measure of intensity of care, and are constructed using the
7:238:18862:16:16:71:534:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:patients age, diagnoses, procedures, and comorbidities. The share of patients in the highest severity
7:239:18964:16:17:71:531:464:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of illness category declines from 43% at LTCHs, to approximately 12% at SNFs andIRFs, to 4%
7:240:19055:17:16:71:481:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:at HHAs (AHA, 2010). Medicare payments per day follow the same declining pattern.
7:241:19136:16:16:88:537:431:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Our point of entry into the PAC landscape is through admission to an LTCH. The bottom panel
7:242:19227:16:16:71:534:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of Figure 2 looks at patient ows from LTCHs. About 11% of LTCH patients are discharged back
7:243:19319:16:17:71:534:399:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to an ACH, 38% are discharged to another PAC facility (SNF or IRF), and 33% are discharged
7:244:19409:17:16:71:535:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to their homes, where they may continue to receive care from an HHA. The remaining 18% are
7:245:19499:16:16:71:537:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:discharged to a hospice (4%) or die within the LTCH (14%). In contrast,once in a SNF or IRF,
7:246:19591:16:16:71:535:350:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:patients almost never get discharged to an LTCH, die much less frequently (5%), and much more
7:247:19684:16:17:71:229:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:often (60%) return directly home.
7:248:19717:17:16:88:536:317:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Despite the interlocking nature of the PAC system, the way that Medicare reimburses post-
7:249:19806:16:16:72:534:301:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:acute care varies substantially by the setting. Historically, all providers were paid according to an
7:250:19907:16:16:72:534:285:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:administrative estimate of their costs. Since the early 2000s, however,many PAC stays are paid
7:251:20001:16:17:72:537:269:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:under a prospective payment system (PPS), yet the unit of paymentvaries across sites. Loosely,
7:252:20095:17:16:72:536:252:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:HHAs are paid per 60-day episode-of-care, SNFs are paid a xed rate per day of stay, while IRFs
7:253:20190:16:16:72:535:236:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and LTCHs are in principle paid a xed amount per admission (like ACHs).6We provide more
7:254:20278:16:16:71:259:220:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:details on LTCH payments in Section 3.
7:255:20316:16:17:88:534:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The fact that each type of facility is paid under a di¤erent system has raised concerns. From a
7:256:20411:17:18:71:536:187:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:public health perspective, there is concern that the separate payment systems do not give providers
7:257:20510:18:17:84:535:169:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:5In analysis that includes HHAs in the calculation, the shareof ACH patients who are discharged to PAC rises to
7:258:20621:17:10:72:165:152:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:42% (MedPAC, 2015b).
7:259:20641:10:17:84:536:142:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:6These di¤erent payment systems also have di¤erential implications for beneciaries cost-sharing requirements
7:260:20751:17:13:72:534:125:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:across types of PAC settings. Beneciaries generally are not required to make any cost sharing for HHA services. IRF
7:261:20867:13:13:72:535:112:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:and LTCH stays are tied to the beneciaries inpatient deductible, so when patients arrive from an ACH there would
7:262:20981:13:13:72:536:99:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:typically be no requirement for additional cost sharing. SNF stays are associated with separate SNF coinsurance for
7:263:21096:13:0:72:175:86:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:stays longer than 20 days.
8:264:21123:0:17:71:535:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:enough incentive to coordinate care across di¤erent facilities. Froma budgetary perspective, there
8:265:21221:17:16:71:535:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is concern that providers may shu­e patients across facilities with the aim of increasing Medicare
8:266:21319:16:16:71:536:675:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:payments.  These concerns have spurred various proposals for payment reform, including a re-
8:267:21411:16:16:71:534:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cent bill which proposes providing a bundled payment to a singlePAC coordinator, and letting
8:268:21505:16:17:71:533:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:this coordinator internalize the costs and benets associated with the sequence of admissions and
8:269:21602:17:32:71:433:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:discharges for the entire episode of care (H.R.1458  BACPAC Act of 2015).
8:270:21676:32:23:71:242:594:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:2.2  Long-term care hospitals
8:271:21705:23:16:71:534:571:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Our primary focus is on patients whose point of entry into the PAC system is a long-term care
8:272:21798:16:17:71:535:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:hospital (LTCH). The demarcation LTCH describes how the provider gets paid by Medicare. It
8:273:21890:17:16:71:535:538:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is a regulatory concept, rather than a medical one. For a hospital to get paid as an LTCH, it must
8:274:21988:16:16:71:535:522:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:have an average inpatient length of stay of 25 days or more. Naturally, thereare many ways to
8:275:22081:16:16:71:534:506:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:meet this requirement, so from a medical standpoint the question of what exactly is an LTCH often
8:276:22178:16:17:71:264:490:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:results in di¤erentiated or fuzzy answers.
8:277:22220:17:16:88:534:473:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The LTCH category of hospitals was created to solve a potential problem created by the 1982
8:278:22311:16:16:71:536:457:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA), which established the prospective payment
8:279:22402:16:16:71:533:441:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:system (PPS) for acute care hospitals. Under the new PPS, hospitals were paid per discharge, and
8:280:22498:16:17:71:535:425:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:not based on their costs, as a way to create incentives for hospitals to be e¢cient in their treatment
8:281:22600:17:16:71:536:408:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:decisions.  Regulators who were designing the PPS realized that therewas a small number of
8:282:22690:16:16:71:536:392:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:hospitals that had long average length-of-stays (LOS) and would not be nancially viable under
8:283:22784:16:16:71:534:376:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the xed-price PPS. LTCHs were thus created as a carve-out from PPS for hospitals that had an
8:284:22877:16:17:71:534:360:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:average LOS of at least 25 days.  At that point in time, there were 40 hospitals that qualied
8:285:22971:17:16:71:534:343:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as LTCHs  mainly former tuberculosis and chronic disease hospitals in the Boston, New York
8:286:23062:16:16:71:536:327:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:City, and Philadelphia metropolitan areas. LTCH payments were based on costs measured in 1982,
8:287:23156:16:16:71:537:311:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:roughly in the spirit of the pre-1982 payment system, and adjusted for ination in subsequent years.
8:288:23256:16:17:71:402:295:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:See Liu et al. (2001) for more on the background of the LTCH sector.
8:289:23324:17:16:88:534:278:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Over the last 30 years, and perhaps because of the LTCH exemption from PPS, there was rapid
8:290:23415:16:16:72:536:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:growth in the LTCH sector. Because new entrants did not have cost data for 1982, payments for
8:291:23508:16:16:72:532:246:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:new entrants were determined by costs in their initial years of operation. This encouraged new
8:292:23602:16:17:72:536:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:entrants to be ine¢cient when they rst opened and earn prots by increasing their e¢ciency over
8:293:23698:17:16:72:535:213:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:time (Liu et al., 2001). From the initial 40 hospitals rst designated as LTCHs in1982, there are
8:294:23795:16:16:72:275:197:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:now over 400 such hospitals in the country.
8:295:23838:16:17:88:537:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Geographic penetration of LTCHs is extremely varied. This presumably reects their historical
8:296:23931:17:16:72:533:164:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:roots as tuberculosis and chronic disease hospitals in the northeast,as well as certicate of need
8:297:24029:16:16:72:535:148:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(CON) laws that restrict entry. There are only a few LTCHs in the west of the country, and three
8:298:24125:16:16:72:534:132:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:states (Massachusetts, Texas, and Louisiana) account for a third of all LTCHs.In places where
8:299:24218:16:17:72:537:116:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:there are LTCHs, these hospitals are an important part of Medicares PAC landscape. For instance,
8:300:24315:17:16:72:530:99:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in hospital service areas (HSAs) with at least one LTCH, we calculate that LTCHs account for 13%
8:301:24411:16:0:72:536:83:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of Medicare PAC facility days and 28% of Medicare PAC facility spending;nationwide, payments
9:302:24504:0:17:71:374:708:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:to LTCHs account for 12% of Medicare PAC facility spending.7
9:303:24564:17:16:88:534:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:LTCHs are much more likely to be for-prot than other medical providers.According to 2008
9:304:24653:16:16:71:535:675:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:data from the American Hospital Association (AHA), 72% of LTCHs are for-prot (versus 17% for
9:305:24746:16:16:71:535:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ACHs), 22% are non-prot, and 6% are government run. The LTCH market is dominated by two
9:306:24834:16:17:71:537:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for-prot companies, Kindred Health Systems and Select Medical, which run about 40% of LTCHs,
9:307:24927:17:16:71:536:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:according to the AHA data. Company reports indicate that LTCHs are highly protable. For their
9:308:25021:16:16:71:537:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:business segments that include LTCHs, Kindreds prots have hovered between 22% and 29% of
9:309:25111:16:17:71:424:594:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:revenue and Selects prots have ranged between 16% to 22% of revenue.8
9:310:25182:17:16:88:535:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Approximately half of LTCHs are known as Hospitals-within-Hospitals (HwHs), meaning that
9:311:25270:16:16:71:534:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:they are physically located within the building or campus of an ACH buthave a separate governing

9:313:25464:16:17:71:533:529:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:have strong relationships with a single ACH.9Because of concerns over close relationships between
9:314:25561:17:16:71:534:512:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:LTCHs and their partner ACHs, in 2005 CMS established a policy known as the 25-percent rule
9:315:25654:16:16:71:537:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that creates disincentives for admitting more than 25% of patients from asingle facility; however,
9:316:25752:16:32:71:346:480:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:Congress has delayed the full implementation of the law.10

9:319:25912:17:16:71:535:408:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:their entire healthcare episode. Our primary data source is the Medicare Provider and Analysis
9:320:26006:16:16:71:536:392:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Review (MedPAR) data, spanning the years 2000-2012. The dataset contains claim-level informa-
9:321:26099:16:16:71:533:376:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tion on discharges from ACHs, LTCHs, SNFs, and IRFs. Each record is a unique stay for which
9:322:26190:16:17:71:535:360:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a claim was submitted, and the data contain information on procedures, admission and discharge

9:324:26380:16:16:71:535:327:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:MedPAR data also provide us with basic demographic information such as the age, sex, and race
9:325:26473:16:16:71:417:311:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the beneciary, and information about the patients diagnoses (DRG).
9:326:26544:16:17:88:536:295:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We supplement this primary source with several ancillary data sources. First, we use Medicares

9:329:26819:18:17:84:533:244:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:7Authors calculations using 2007-2012 data described below. PAC facilities include LTCH, SNF and IRF. PAC
9:330:26925:17:13:72:537:227:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:facilities represent about 70% of total PAC spending, with the other 30% due to PAC provided by HHAs (MedPAC,
9:331:27034:13:10:72:99:214:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:2015a).
9:332:27041:10:17:84:535:204:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:8Prots are dened as EBITA (earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization). Kindreds prots are based on
9:333:27151:17:14:72:535:187:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:2009 to 2015 company reports. Prior to 2009, Kindred did not separate out their reporting of LTCH prots from the
9:334:27264:14:10:72:442:173:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:much larger SNF category. Selects prots are based on company reports from 2004 to 2015.
9:335:27353:10:17:84:534:163:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:9MedPAC (2004) found that HwHs receive 61% of their cases fromtheir most frequent referring hospital and
9:336:27457:17:10:72:384:146:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:freestanding hospitals receive 42% from their most frequent referring hospital.
9:337:27536:10:17:80:535:136:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:10There is also a regulation known as the 5-percent rule thataddresses the incentive for HwH to ping-pong
9:338:27645:17:13:72:533:119:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:patients between the ACH and LTCH. In particular, if more than 5% of patients who are discharged from an LTCH
9:339:27754:13:13:72:535:106:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:to an ACH are readmitted to the LTCH, the LTCH will be compensated as if the patient had a single LTCH stay

10:344:28170:16:16:71:537:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the calendar year prior to the LTCH stay. Finally, we use data from the American Hospital
10:345:28262:16:17:71:536:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Association (AHA) survey over the same period to determine whether anLTCH is for-prot, non-
10:346:28354:17:16:71:413:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:prot, or government owned, and whether it is co-located with an ACH.
10:347:28423:16:16:88:536:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Our analysis focuses on the current Medicare payment schedule for LTCHs, known as LTCH-
10:348:28510:16:17:71:535:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:PPS. We analyze the time periods before and after full implementationof LTCH-PPS, which was
10:349:28601:17:16:71:535:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:phased in over a ve year period starting on October 1, 2002. We dene thepre-PPS periodas
10:350:28691:16:16:71:535:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:discharges that occurred from January 1, 2000 to September 30, 2002. For this period, we measure
10:351:28787:16:16:71:536:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:post-discharge payments, days and mortality through March 31, 2003, which is six months after
10:352:28880:16:17:71:535:529:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the last LTCH discharge. We exclude the October 2002 to September 2007 phase-in period because
10:353:28974:17:16:71:537:512:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:provider behavior during this period potentially reects the combination of changing nancial
10:354:29067:16:16:71:535:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:incentives and learning about the new incentive structure, complicating the interpretation of the
10:355:29164:16:16:71:537:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:data. We dene thePPS periodas discharges that occurred from October 1, 2007 to July 31, 2012,
10:356:29258:16:17:71:535:464:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and analyze post-discharge payments, days and mortality through December 31, 2012, which is
10:357:29349:17:16:71:314:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:similarly six months after the last LTCH discharge.
10:358:29400:16:16:88:533:431:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Table 1 shows summary statistics on ACH, LTCH, and SNF/IRF admissions in the pre-PPS
10:359:29484:16:16:71:535:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and PPS periods.12Since an observation is an admission, some patients (16%) show up multiple
10:360:29576:16:17:71:534:399:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:times in the data. LTCH patients are, on average, slightly younger than ACHpatients and much
10:361:29668:17:16:71:534:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:younger than SNF/IRF patients. LTCH patients are also almost twice as likely to be black and
10:362:29760:16:16:71:537:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:about one-third more likely to be eligible for Medicaid, relative to ACH and SNF/IRF patients.
10:363:29854:16:16:71:534:350:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:These di¤erences are fairly stable over time. From a health perspective, patients in an LTCH look
10:364:29951:16:17:71:534:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:less healthy than those in an ACH or SNF/IRF. They have more chronic conditions prior to the stay
10:365:30048:17:16:71:534:317:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and higher mortality. For example, about 15% of LTCH patients die within 30days of admission
10:366:30140:16:16:71:535:301:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and 30% die within 90 days; these mortality rates are about 50% larger than mortality rates for
10:367:30235:16:16:71:407:285:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:SNF/IRF patients and about twice as large as those for ACH patients.
10:368:30303:16:17:88:535:269:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In terms of the intensity of medical care, LTCH stays are closer to ACH stays than stays at
10:369:30394:17:16:71:535:252:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a SNF/IRF. The majority of LTCH and ACH patients receive at least one medical procedure
10:370:30481:16:16:71:533:236:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:versus about 5% of patients who visit an SNF/IRF. The most common LTCH procedures (blood
10:371:30569:16:16:71:534:220:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:transfusion and ventilation) are also more similar to those that occur at an ACH, relative to
10:372:30662:16:17:71:534:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:occupational and physical therapies, which are the most common procedures in SNF/IRF. Length
10:373:30754:17:19:71:535:187:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of stay at an LTCH, however, is (by design) much more similar to that of a SNF/IRF. The average
10:374:30849:19:17:80:536:168:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:11In the MedPAR data, we can observe all discharge destinations, but we can only observe post-discharge payments
10:375:30961:17:13:71:533:151:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:and days for ACH and PAC facilities (SNF, IRF, LTCH) and not for home health visits or hospice. Appendix A
10:376:31067:13:13:71:537:138:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:shows how we estimate these using the summary le on cost and use which includes spending for all components of
10:377:31178:13:13:71:536:125:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:care. In practice, HHA and hospice payments are quite small as a share of the total. For example, we estimate that
10:378:31292:13:13:71:537:112:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:of individuals with an LTCH discharge, LTCH and SNF/IRF payments constitute over 90% of total PAC payments,
10:379:31399:13:10:71:238:99:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:with home health accounting for only 8%.
10:380:31439:10:17:80:536:89:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:12We group SNF and IRF admissions together for convenience, asboth represent post-acute care that is less
10:381:31545:17:0:71:486:72:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:intense than an LTCH and because IRFs only account for a small (6.4%) fraction of these admissions.
11:382:31646:0:17:71:446:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:stay at an ACH is 5 days, while it is just over 25 days in LTCH and SNF/IRF.
11:383:31722:17:16:88:535:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The bottom rows of Table 1 show statistics on Medicare and out-of-pocket payments. Medicare
11:384:31813:16:16:72:533:675:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:payments in the PPS period average $2,079 per day at an ACH, $1,392 per day at an LTCH, and
11:385:31904:16:16:72:536:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:$507 per day at a SNF/IRF. However, because LTCH stays are much longer than ACH stays, per-
11:386:31995:16:17:72:534:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:admission Medicare payments at LTCHs average over $35,000, which is three times greater than
11:387:32087:17:16:72:535:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:per-admission ACH and SNF/IRF payments. Out-of-pocket payments at ACHs and LTCHs arise
11:388:32173:16:16:72:534:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from Medicares Part A deductible ($1,156 in 2012) and from co-insurance payments that apply
11:389:32265:16:17:72:537:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:when the patient has more than 60 hospital days in the benet period ($289per day in 2012).
11:390:32356:17:16:72:536:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Because patients have no out-of-pocket exposure between the deductible and their 60th hospital
11:391:32450:16:16:72:536:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:day, out-of-pocket payments are a modest 7.7% of Medicare payments at ACHs and 5.4% at LTCHs
11:392:32542:16:16:72:536:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the PPS period. SNFs, on the other hand, have a separate co-insurance schedule with payments
11:393:32637:16:17:72:535:529:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of $144.50 per day in 2012 for stays in excess of 20 days, and have a much higher out-of-pocket
11:394:32732:17:16:72:97:512:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:share.
11:395:32738:16:16:88:534:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Our analysis encompasses not only the experience of the patient in theLTCH (i.e., length of stay
11:396:32834:16:16:72:535:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and payments) but also their post-discharge experience. Table 2 provides some summary statistics
11:397:32930:16:17:72:536:464:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on post-discharge experience. We dene a post-discharge episode of care as the spell of continuous
11:398:33028:17:16:72:535:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:days with a Medicare payment to an ACH, SNF/IRF or LTCH; the episode ends if there are two
11:399:33118:16:16:72:536:431:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:days or more without any Medicare payments being made to any of these institutions. For each post-
11:400:33216:16:16:72:537:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:discharge episode we report 30-day mortality, 90-day mortality, post-discharge Medicare payments,
11:401:33313:16:17:72:534:399:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and post-discharge facility days (i.e. days in an ACH, SNF/IRF, LTCH or hospice). Focusing on
11:402:33406:17:16:72:535:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the PPS period, about one-quarter of LTCH patients die in the 90-days postdischarge. Average
11:403:33498:16:16:72:535:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:length of stay in the post-discharge episode of care is 26 days, whichis similar to the average time
11:404:33598:16:16:72:537:350:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the LTCH (see Table 1). Average post-discharge Medicare payments is $22,975, about 60% of
11:405:33690:16:17:72:295:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Medicare payments to the LTCH (see Table 1).
11:406:33734:17:16:88:535:317:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In some of our analyses below, we will nd it useful to classify live discharges from the LTCH as
11:407:33831:16:16:72:535:301:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:either upstream or downstream based on their discharge destination. Upstream discharges
11:408:33924:16:16:72:532:285:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:represent patients in worse health than downstream destinations. Specically, we group LTCH
11:409:34017:16:17:72:536:269:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:discharges to hospice or ACH as upstream and discharges to SNF/IRF, or home (with or with-
11:410:34109:17:16:72:537:252:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:out home healthcare), or to other as downstream.13Table 2 shows that most (about 85%) of
11:411:34199:16:16:71:536:236:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:LTCH discharges are downstream, and that patients initially discharged downstream have substan-
11:412:34294:16:16:71:530:220:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tially lower post-discharge mortality (e.g. 18% 90-day mortality compared to60% for upstream
11:413:34386:16:19:71:268:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:discharges), length of stay, and payments.
11:414:34428:19:17:80:534:185:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:13Appendix Table A1 shows more granularity on the discharge destinations within upstream and downstream.  In
11:415:34536:17:13:71:538:168:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:the PPS period 97% of patients discharged upstream are sent to ACH (vs hospice); of patients discharged downstream,
11:416:34651:13:14:71:537:155:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:about half are sent to SNF/IRF (which we group together because over 90% of discharges to SNF or IRF are to SNF)
11:417:34763:14:0:71:320:141:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:and another 40% are discharged to home or home health care.
12:418:34823:0:28:71:451:708:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:3  LTCH payments, discharge patterns, and outcomes
12:419:34873:28:16:71:536:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In this section we present descriptive analysis on LTCHs responseto nancial incentives. We start
12:420:34971:16:16:71:534:664:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:by describing the LTCH budget set, including the large jump in payments that is our primary
12:421:35062:16:16:71:534:648:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:source of identication. We then show evidence on how discharge patterns and mortality rates vary
12:422:35159:16:17:71:535:632:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with the budget set. This descriptive evidence motivates severalof our key modeling choices in the
12:423:35257:17:32:71:463:615:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:dynamic model of LTCH discharge behavior, which we present in the next section.
12:424:35336:32:23:71:193:583:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:3.1  LTCH payments
12:425:35354:23:16:71:536:560:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We provide a basic overview here of how LTCH payments vary with the patients length of stay,
12:426:35447:16:16:71:535:544:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:an object we refer to as the LTCH budget set or payment schedule. Appendix B provides more
12:427:35537:16:17:71:479:528:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:details. Figure 1 summarizes the payment schedules in the pre-PPS and PPS periods.
12:428:35619:17:16:88:535:511:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Prior to October 1, 2002, LTCHs were paid their (estimated) daily cost, generating a linear
12:429:35710:16:16:71:536:495:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:relationship between the length of the hospital stay and payments.  Asdescribed earlier, this
12:430:35803:16:16:71:535:479:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cost plus reimbursement of LTCHs was seen as potentially encouraging ine¢cient entry into the
12:431:35898:16:17:71:534:463:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:LTCH market. Because of this and other concerns, the 1997 Balanced Budget Act (BBA) and
12:432:35985:17:16:71:535:446:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1999 Balanced Budget Renement Act (BBRA) implemented a PPS for LTCHs. LTCH-PPS was
12:433:36068:16:16:71:536:430:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:phased in over a 5-year period starting on October 1, 2002 and was fully implemented by October
12:434:36163:16:16:71:536:414:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1, 2007. At a broad level, LTCH-PPS is designed to operate like the PPS for acute care hospitals
12:435:36259:16:17:71:536:398:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(IP-PPS), under which hospitals are paid a lump-sum that is based on the patients diagnosis
12:436:36351:17:16:71:480:381:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(diagnosis-related group, or DRG) and does not vary with the patients length of stay.
12:437:36437:16:16:88:533:365:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Much like LTCHs were originally created to address a potential problem with the introduction
12:438:36529:16:16:71:535:349:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of PPS for ACHs, the features of the LTCH-PPS payment schedule can similarly be thought of as
12:439:36622:16:17:71:533:333:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:attempting to address a potential problem arising from the introduction of PPS for LTCHs. In
12:440:36714:17:16:71:535:316:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:particular, in designing LTCH-PPS, o¢cials were concerned that LTCHs might discharge patients
12:441:36807:16:16:71:535:300:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:after a small number of days but still receive large lump-sum paymentsintended for longer hospitals
12:442:36906:16:17:71:535:284:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:stays. To address this concern, they created a short stay outlier (SSO) threshold. If stays were
12:443:37002:17:16:71:536:267:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:shorter than the SSO threshold, payments would be based on the pre-PPScost-based reimbursement
12:444:37096:16:16:71:535:251:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:schedule and LTCHs would not receive a large lump sum. However, while reducing the incentive to
12:445:37191:16:16:71:536:235:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cycle patients in and out of the LTCH, the SSO system creates potentially problematic incentives
12:446:37287:16:17:71:530:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:at the SSO threshold. At the day when payments switch from per-day reimbursement to lump-sum
12:447:37379:17:16:71:535:202:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:prospective payment amount, Medicare payments for keeping a patient anadditional day jump
12:448:37470:16:16:71:158:186:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:by a large amount.
12:449:37488:16:16:88:536:170:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 1 graphs the average payment schedules in the pre-PPS and PPSperiods, pooling across
12:450:37579:16:17:71:533:154:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:LTCH facilities and DRGs. The y-axis shows cumulative Medicare payments, ination-adjusted
12:451:37669:17:16:71:535:137:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to 2012 dollars. The x-axis shows the length of the stay relative to the SSO threshold, which we
12:452:37765:16:16:71:536:121:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:normalize to be day 0. The SSO threshold is dened as ve-sixths the geometric mean length of
12:453:37858:16:16:71:535:105:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:stay for that DRG in the previous year and therefore varies by DRG (and also, to a much lesser
12:454:37952:16:0:71:531:89:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:extent, by year). The average threshold is at 22.5 days; the modal threshold (accounting for 22.4%
13:455:38052:0:17:71:535:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of PPS stays) is 20 days and 99% of the sample has a SSO threshold between 16 and39 days.14As
13:456:38145:17:16:72:535:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a result, in this and subsequent gures, we present results relative to the SSO threshold so that we
13:457:38245:16:16:72:536:675:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:can pool analyses across DRGs.15Because the SSO threshold is undened in the pre-PPS period,
13:458:38337:16:16:71:416:659:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:we assign pre-PPS stays the threshold for their DRG from PPS period.16
13:459:38407:16:17:88:536:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Under the pre-PPS system, average payments scale linearly with the length of stay at a rate of
13:460:38501:17:16:72:536:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:$1,071 per day. Under the PPS system, payments increase linearly by $1,386 per day to the left of
13:461:38598:16:16:72:535:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the SSO threshold, jump by $13,656 at the SSO threshold, and remain constant thereafter. The
13:462:38692:16:17:72:535:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:increase in payments at the jump is large: it is equal to 55% of the cumulative payment amount
13:463:38786:17:16:72:534:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on the day prior to the threshold, or equivalent to about 10 days of payments at the pre-threshold
13:464:38884:16:16:72:118:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:daily rate.
13:465:38895:16:16:88:536:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This sharp jump in payments was presumably not the intention of the policymakers who de-
13:466:38983:16:17:72:536:529:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:signed the LTCH-PPS, but it arises naturally from the interaction oftwo sensible policies. As is
13:467:39079:17:16:72:535:512:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:standard in xed price contracts, the LTCH-PPS payments were likely set to approximate average
13:468:39173:16:16:72:534:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:costs per stay. As noted, payments on a cost-plus basis up to the SSO threshold were introduced to
13:469:39271:16:16:72:536:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:avoid paying LTCHs large lump sum amounts for relatively short stays.While reducing the incen-
13:470:39365:16:17:72:534:464:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tive to discharge patients from an ACH to an LTCH, the transition unavoidably creates potentially
13:471:39462:17:16:72:535:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:problematic incentives. Particularly concerning is where the threshold was set: we estimate that
13:472:39558:16:16:72:534:431:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:under the pre-PPS payment scheme, 44% of stays would have been below the subsequent short stay
13:473:39652:16:16:72:536:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:outlier threshold, which is a large fraction for a policy that is at leastostensibly designed to target
13:474:39755:16:17:72:147:399:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:outlier events.
13:475:39772:17:16:88:536:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In Section 4 we explore the impact of alternative, counterfactual payment schedules. To elim-
13:476:39865:16:16:72:534:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:inate the jump in payments, our counterfactuals alter the payment prior to the SSO threshold
13:477:39957:16:16:72:535:350:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(so that it does not approximate per-day costs), alter the xed PPS amount (so that it does not
13:478:40052:16:32:72:434:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:approximate average costs), or alter both segments of the payment schedule.
13:479:40127:32:24:72:208:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:3.2  Discharge patterns
13:480:40150:24:16:72:535:278:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We present a number of descriptive results on discharge patterns from the LTCH around the
13:481:40239:16:16:72:535:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:threshold. The results can be summarized as follows. First, there is a large spike in discharges
13:482:40335:16:16:72:536:246:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:at precisely the day of the jump in payments, indicating a strong response to nancial incentives.
13:483:40433:16:17:72:535:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Second, the marginal patients discharged at the threshold are in relatively better health: they are
13:484:40532:17:16:72:535:213:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:disproportionately discharged downstream and they have lower post-discharge mortality rates
13:485:40625:16:16:72:536:197:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:than patients discharged at other times. Third, among patients discharged downstream, the mar-
13:486:40719:16:19:72:536:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ginal patients discharged at the threshold are relatively sicker, with higher post-discharge payments
13:487:40820:19:13:80:342:162:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:14Across all DRGs, the SSO threshold ranges from 14 to 56 days.
13:488:40883:13:17:80:536:149:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:15We start the x-axis range at -15 days because nearly all SSO thresholds occur after 16 days. If we extended the
13:489:40996:17:14:71:535:132:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:x-axis range to -16, for example, there would be a change in the composition of DRGs between days -16 and -15
13:490:41105:14:13:71:533:118:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:due to the entry of new DRGs into the sample. We end the x-axis range at 45 days because there are relatively few
13:491:41218:13:10:71:434:105:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:(2.1%) patients who are kept at the LTCH more than 45 days beyond the SSO threshold.
13:492:41302:10:17:80:535:95:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:16Since the thresholds occasionally vary over time, we use theSSO threshold from 2007, which is the rst year in
13:493:41414:17:0:72:134:78:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:the PPS period.
14:494:41431:0:17:71:534:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:than pre-threshold dischargees. Below we discuss how these patternscan be rationalized with a
14:495:41524:17:16:71:224:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:simple model of LTCH behavior.
14:496:41554:16:16:88:534:675:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 3 shows the aggregate pattern of discharges by length of stay in the pre-PPS and PPS
14:497:41645:16:16:71:536:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:periods. A discharge occurs when the patient is transferred to another facility, sent home, or dies at
14:498:41747:16:17:71:536:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the LTCH. The y-axis shows discharges as a share of the total number of stays at the LTCH. The x-
14:499:41844:17:16:71:535:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:axis plots the length of stay relative to the DRG-specic SSO threshold, dened in the same manner
14:500:41942:16:16:71:534:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as in Figure 1. In the PPS period, there is a sharp increase in discharges at the SSO threshold, with
14:501:42043:16:17:71:534:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the share of discharges increasing from about 2% to 9% per day. Discharge rates remain elevated
14:502:42138:17:16:71:534:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:over the subsequent 7 to 10 days before reverting to baseline. Inthe pre-PPS period, there is no
14:503:42234:16:16:71:535:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:evidence of any bunching at the SSO threshold. This discharge pattern is consistent with a strong
14:504:42331:16:16:71:237:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:response to the nancial incentives.
14:505:42367:16:17:88:536:529:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Relative to the pre-PPS constant, per-day payment schedule, the increase in discharges under
14:506:42459:17:16:72:537:512:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:PPS at the threshold could be drawn either from the left or from theright of the distribution.
14:507:42557:16:16:72:534:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In other words, the excess discharges at the threshold could reect patients who under the pre-PPS
14:508:42655:16:16:72:535:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:schedule would have been discharged before the threshold but are retained in order to get the
14:509:42750:16:17:72:533:464:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:lump sum payout at the threshold, or patients who would have been discharged after the threshold
14:510:42846:17:16:72:533:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:but are now discharged earlier since there is no longer a marginal nancialpayment associated with
14:511:42944:16:16:72:229:431:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:keeping them for additional days.
14:512:42977:16:16:88:535:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Because the share of discharges to the left of the threshold is lower in the PPS period relative to
14:513:43076:16:17:72:534:399:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the pre-PPS period, it is tempting to infer that the excess mass of discharges is primarily drawn
14:514:43174:17:16:72:535:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from the left of the distribution. However, we caution that di¤erences in the discharge rate might
14:515:43273:16:16:72:536:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:not only reect the change in nancial incentives but also changes in patient health and other secular
14:516:43375:16:16:72:534:350:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:trends between the pre-PPS and PPS periods. For example, a simple reweighting of the pre-PPS
14:517:43467:16:17:72:535:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:admissions to match the DRG composition of the PPS period eliminates approximately 30% of the
14:518:43560:17:16:72:534:317:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:di¤erence between the pre-PPS and PPS discharge rates prior to theSSO threshold (Appendix
14:519:43649:16:16:72:535:301:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure A2).  In Section 4, we show how we can use our model to compare discharge patterns
14:520:43738:16:16:72:536:285:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:under the observed PPS payment schedule to discharge patterns under alternative, counterfactual
14:521:43833:16:17:72:161:269:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:payment schedules.
14:522:43851:17:16:88:534:252:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 4 decomposes the discharge pattern by the location of discharge inorder of descending
14:523:43943:16:16:71:534:236:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:patient health: downstream, upstream, and death. The gure shows increases at the threshold in
14:524:44037:16:16:71:535:220:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:discharges both upstream and downstream, but the proportional increaseis substantially larger
14:525:44130:16:17:71:536:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on the downstream margin. Moreover, because the pre-threshold discharge rate is much higher
14:526:44221:17:16:71:535:187:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:downstream, the sharp change in discharge rate at the threshold (shown inFigure 3) is almost
14:527:44313:16:16:71:534:171:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:entirely driven by downstream discharges. We defer our discussion ofthe bottom panel on mortality
14:528:44410:16:17:71:183:155:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to the subsection below.
14:529:44434:17:16:88:534:138:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Appendix Figure A3 plots the 30-day post-discharge mortality rate, dened as death within
14:530:44523:16:16:71:535:122:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:30 days of a (live) discharge, by length of stay. The graph shows a sharp drop in post-discharge
14:531:44619:16:16:71:535:106:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:mortality at the SSO threshold, again suggesting that the patients who are discharged at the
14:532:44711:16:17:71:537:90:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:threshold are healthier than the patients who are discharged immediately beforehand. Of course,
14:533:44806:17:0:71:535:73:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the decline in mortality not only reects changes in the composition of patients discharged at the
15:534:44906:0:17:71:535:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:threshold, but could in principle reect a treatment e¤ect of discharge on health. We address this
15:535:45004:17:16:71:160:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the next section.
15:536:45024:16:16:88:531:675:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Finally, Figure 5 plots Medicare payments for the episode of care that occurs after the LTCH
15:537:45116:16:16:71:534:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:discharge, by length of stay at the LTCH. We show these post-discharge payments separately
15:538:45206:16:17:71:535:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for patients discharged upstream and discharged downstream and view themas a proxy for
15:539:45296:17:16:71:534:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the patients health at the time of discharge.  For patients discharged downstream, there is a
15:540:45390:16:16:71:535:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sharp increase in post-discharge payments at the threshold, with average post-discharge payments
15:541:45486:16:17:71:534:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:increasing from approximately $10,000 to $20,000. There is a small change in the opposite direction
15:542:45585:17:16:71:535:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for patients initially discharged upstream. For longer lengths of stay, the gure becomes noisy due
15:543:45684:16:16:71:232:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to the small number of discharges.
15:544:45718:16:16:88:534:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 5 suggests a simple model of LTCH behavior, which motivates the model we present in
15:545:45808:16:17:72:535:529:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Section 4. Prior to the threshold, retaining patients is protable,and only the healthiest patients are
15:546:45911:17:16:72:537:512:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:discharged to SNF/IRF or their home and the sickest patients discharged to an ACH or a hospice.
15:547:46006:16:16:72:535:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:After the threshold, on the downstream margin, LTCHs work down the distribution and discharge
15:548:46101:16:16:72:531:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:less healthy patients, increasing post-discharge payments on average.Similarly, on the upstream
15:549:46196:16:17:72:534:464:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:margin, LTCHs work up the distribution, discharging patients who are in better health, and
15:550:46288:17:16:72:536:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:decreasing post-discharge payments on average. The marginal patient discharged downstream at
15:551:46380:16:16:72:535:431:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the threshold is therefore sicker than the average patient discharged prior to the threshold, while
15:552:46479:16:16:72:534:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the marginal patient discharged upstream is slightly healthier thanthe average patient discharged
15:553:46576:16:32:72:181:399:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:upstream in prior days.
15:554:46599:32:24:72:253:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:3.3  (Lack of) Mortality e¤ects
15:555:46630:24:16:72:536:343:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A natural question raised by the discharge patterns is whether the distortions in the timing of
15:556:46725:16:16:72:534:327:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:discharges have an impact on patient health and in particular mortality. Since the 90-day mortality
15:557:46824:16:16:72:536:311:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rate of LTCH patients is approximately 30% (see Table 1), if these distortions are harmful to health,
15:558:46925:16:17:72:430:295:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:it seems plausible that we might be able to pick up an e¤ect with our data.
15:559:47000:17:16:95:535:278:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Empirical identication of mortality e¤ects from the distortion in patient location at the
15:560:47090:16:16:72:536:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:threshold is challenging, however.  Health evolves according to a stochastic process, with sicker
15:561:47187:16:16:72:535:246:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:patients having a higher probability of death. Distortions to the location of care might impact
15:562:47282:16:17:72:536:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the level of someones health, generating an on-impact e¤ect on the probability of death analogous
15:563:47380:17:16:72:535:213:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to the on-impact e¤ect on discharges we detected.  However, distortionsto the location might
15:564:47472:16:16:72:534:197:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:also a¤ect the stochastic process for health, which would be associated with a longer-run change in
15:565:47571:16:17:72:535:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:mortality rate, but might not have an immediate mortality e¤ect. We therefore attempt to examine
15:566:47667:17:16:72:534:164:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:not only whether there is an immediate impact on mortality at the threshold, but whether we can
15:567:47762:16:16:72:215:148:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:detect any longer-run changes.
15:568:47792:16:16:88:536:132:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We have already seen in the bottom panel of Figure 4 some suggestive evidence that mortal-
15:569:47882:16:17:71:532:116:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ity rates are declining over the course of the LTCH stay with little di¤erence around the SSO
15:570:47975:17:18:71:534:99:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:threshold.17However, the interpretation of the bottom panel of Figure 4  which plots mortality
15:571:48070:18:0:80:536:81:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:17The downward trend results from natural selection: as thesickest patients die, the remaining patients become
16:572:48184:0:17:71:535:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rates for LTCH patients by length of stay  is complicated by selection concerns. Since LTCHs are
16:573:48281:17:16:71:535:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:di¤erentially discharging healthier patients at the SSO threshold,the composition of patients who
16:574:48378:16:16:71:533:675:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:remain at the LTCH is changing, making it tricky to disentangle any potentialtreatment e¤ects on
16:575:48474:16:16:71:412:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:mortality from e¤ects due to changes in the selection of LTCH patients.
16:576:48545:16:17:88:534:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In Figure 6 we circumvent this issue by taking advantage of the fact thatour data allow us to
16:577:48638:17:16:71:534:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:track mortality outcomes for patients even after their LTCH discharge. Conceptually, our mortality
16:578:48736:16:16:71:537:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:analysis follows the logic of a reduced form regression, where the mortality hazard is the outcome,
16:579:48835:16:17:71:533:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:discharge patterns are the endogenous variable, and the SSO threshold isthe instrument.  In
16:580:48926:17:16:71:536:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:particular, since we know there is a sharp jump in discharge patterns at the threshold (analogous
16:581:49023:16:16:71:535:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to a large rst stage), if there is a change in the level or slope of the mortalityhazard at the
16:582:49119:16:16:71:534:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:threshold (that is, non-zero reduced form), we can infer that the distortion in discharge location
16:583:49217:16:17:71:200:529:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:has an impact on mortality.
16:584:49244:17:16:88:537:512:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The top panel of Figure 6 is thus similar to the bottom panel of Figure 4, butuses the full
16:585:49335:16:16:72:535:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:set of LTCH patients (unconditional on their location) rather than onlythose who have yet to be
16:586:49430:16:16:72:534:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:discharged. As before, natural selection leads mortality rates to decline over time, but we now can
16:587:49529:16:17:72:536:464:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:interpret more cleanly the mortality pattern around the SSO threshold. The plot shows no obvious
16:588:49625:17:16:72:535:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:evidence of a change in the level of mortality hazard in the vicinity of the threshold during the
16:589:49722:16:16:72:534:431:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:PPS period. In Appendix C, we examine this mortality pattern more formallyusing a regression
16:590:49814:16:16:72:535:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:discontinuity design and similarly fail to reject the null of a smooth mortality hazard around the
16:591:49912:16:17:72:535:399:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:SSO threshold. These ndings are consistent with no mortality e¤ect but do not allow us to rule
16:592:50007:17:16:72:371:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:out a gradual e¤ect that would not appear sharply in the data.
16:593:50069:16:16:88:535:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:If distortions in the location of care a¤ected the stochastic process forhealth, we might not
16:594:50162:16:16:72:535:350:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:observe an immediate e¤ect, but would see a change in mortality over a longer time horizon. The
16:595:50257:16:17:72:534:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:bottom panel of Figure 6 attempts to look for a more gradual e¤ect by plotting a 30-day mortality
16:596:50354:17:16:72:536:317:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rate, by days since LTCH admission, where the 30-day mortality hazard measures the share of
16:597:50445:16:16:72:534:301:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:patients who are alive on a given day but die during the subsequent30 days. The plot once again
16:598:50540:16:16:72:534:285:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:shows no e¤ect around the threshold, suggesting that there are no gradual e¤ects of the distortion
16:599:50638:16:17:72:534:269:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in location on mortality. In Appendix C, we present a regression discontinuity analysis that more
16:600:50735:17:16:72:207:252:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:formally conrms this result.
16:601:50764:16:16:88:534:236:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 6 suggests little evidence of a quantitatively large e¤ect on mortality that is created by
16:602:50861:16:16:72:535:220:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the sharp discharge incentives at the SSO threshold. This (lack of) reduced form e¤ect should be
16:603:50957:16:17:71:532:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:judged in relation to the size of the rst stage e¤ect on the location of care. And as we will show
16:604:51056:17:16:72:534:187:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the analysis in the next section, the jump in payments at the threshold only shifts the location
16:605:51155:16:16:72:491:171:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of care for a relatively small number of days, so perhaps the null resultis not surprising.
16:606:51246:16:17:88:536:155:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Finally, we provide some additional traction on potential mortality impacts by exploiting dif-
16:607:51340:17:16:72:535:138:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ferences in the response to incentives between for-prot and non-prot LTCHs. Figure 7 shows
16:608:51432:16:16:72:531:122:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the payment schedules (top panel), discharge shares (middle panel),and mortality rates (bottom
16:609:51526:16:23:72:535:106:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:panel), separately by for-prot status. While the payment schedules are almost the same across
16:610:51620:23:0:71:147:83:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:gradually healthier.
17:611:51642:0:17:71:536:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the two groups of hospitals, the behavioral response to the jump in payments is substantially larger
17:612:51742:17:16:71:535:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:at for-prot LTCHs.  Prior to the threshold, for-prot hospitals have a slightly lower discharge
17:613:51838:16:16:71:536:675:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rate, but at the SSO threshold their discharge share rises by about twice as much as that of non-
17:614:51935:16:16:71:535:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:prot hospitals, suggesting that, perhaps not surprisingly, for-prot hospitals are relatively more
17:615:52034:16:17:71:227:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:responsive to nancial incentives.
17:616:52068:17:16:88:537:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Given that for-prots LTCHs exhibit much larger behavioral response tothe jump in payments,
17:617:52159:16:16:71:536:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:if the PPS payment schedule a¤ected mortality, we would expect a more pronounced mortality e¤ect
17:618:52255:16:17:71:535:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:at for-prot hospitals. The bottom panel of Figure 7 provides no suggestion of any di¤erences in the
17:619:52355:17:16:71:535:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:mortality pattern by for-prot status. Mortality hazards in the PPS period are remarkably similar
17:620:52452:16:16:71:536:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:across both groups in the immediate vicinity of the SSO threshold; this suggests no on-impact e¤ect
17:621:52551:16:16:71:260:545:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:of the location distortion on mortality.18
17:622:52593:16:17:88:532:529:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:While these results provide no smoking gun evidence of patient harm, they do not allow
17:623:52681:17:16:71:535:512:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:us to comprehensively rule out a mortality e¤ect. We cannot, for instance, rule out an e¤ect for
17:624:52777:16:16:71:536:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:every type of patient or at each and every hospital, and we cannot rule outadverse health e¤ects
17:625:52873:16:16:71:535:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that would not manifest in higher mortality rates.  However, combined with the earlier results
17:626:52967:16:17:71:534:464:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:which indicate that the patients who are most a¤ected by the SSO threshold are disproportionately
17:627:53064:17:16:71:535:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:healthy, the results suggest that the marginal patients a¤ected by the PPS payment schedule are
17:628:53159:16:16:71:537:431:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:able to receive similar care whether they are located in an LTCH or in their alternative setting,
17:629:53256:16:38:71:237:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:which empirically is usually a SNF.
17:630:53291:38:27:71:442:377:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:4  Quantifying the importance of nancial incentives
17:631:53343:27:16:71:534:350:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The results in the last section provide descriptive evidence of the response of LTCHs to the sharp
17:632:53441:16:17:71:535:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:nancial incentives associated with the SSO threshold. One way to quantify the importance of the
17:633:53537:17:16:71:534:317:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:nancial incentives in determining LTCH discharge patterns is to assess how these patterns would
17:634:53633:16:16:71:535:301:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:change in response to counterfactual nancial contracts that exhibit weaker incentives. Doing so
17:635:53729:16:32:71:356:285:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:requires a dynamic model, which is the focus of this section.
17:636:53790:32:23:71:360:253:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:4.1  A simple model of LTCH discharge decisions
17:637:53837:23:17:71:536:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Consider a patientiwho is admitted at dayt= 0to LTCHl. We index patientis health at
17:638:53921:17:16:72:540:213:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the time of admission byhi;0, and assume thathi;t(conditional on patientistaying at LTCHl)
17:639:54011:16:16:71:534:197:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:evolves stochastically from day to day. In our baseline specication,we assume thathi;tfollows a
17:640:54107:16:17:71:535:181:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:monotone Markov process, such thathi;t-F(-jhi;t-1)withF(-jh)stochastically increasing inh.19
17:641:54199:17:16:72:534:164:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We use higher values ofhto indicate better health and thus assume that daily mortality hazard
17:642:54292:16:19:72:223:148:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:m(h)is strictly decreasing inh.
17:643:54323:19:17:80:535:129:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:18The mortality pattern for non-prot hospitals is slightly noisier, but this is presumably driven by sampling
17:644:54433:17:13:71:535:112:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:variation due to the smaller samples size of non-prot admissions (113,154 versus 487,988 for for-prots in the PPS
17:645:54548:13:10:71:100:99:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:period).
17:646:54556:10:17:80:535:89:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:19In sensitivity analysis, we examine the robustness to our ndings by allowing the health process to vary with
17:647:54667:17:0:72:155:72:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:time since admission.

18:655:55241:17:16:71:533:576:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:by the parameter--. The error term presumably captures idiosyncratic considerations associated
18:656:55335:16:16:71:245:560:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with the patient and/or the hospital.
18:657:55372:16:16:88:536:544:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Our focus is on the hospitals discharge decision. Consider a set ofJalternative destinations

18:662:55773:25:16:71:534:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Moreover, because hospitallloses control over the patient upon discharge, it will be convenientto

18:685:56415:16:17:71:537:278:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:decision whether to discharge or keep the patient, and in the event of a discharge the hospital
18:686:56510:17:16:71:534:261:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:also decides about the discharge location. Of course the model can allow the patient to actually
18:687:56606:16:16:71:536:245:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:decide about the discharge destination by having the hospital place a large weight on patient
18:688:56701:16:16:71:534:229:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:utility. While we did not nd a mortality e¤ect in our descriptive analysis, by allowing the health
18:689:56800:16:17:71:535:213:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:process outside the LTCH to evolve according toGj(-jh), instead ofF(-jh)within the LTCH, our
18:690:56892:17:16:71:476:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:model allows patient health to evolve di¤erentially across alternative locations of care
18:691:56980:16:16:88:535:180:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:It is convenient to benchmark the patients utility against her utility at the LTCH. That is, we

19:740:57951:24:16:72:537:508:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:Parameterization.We make several additional assumptions before we take the model to the data.
19:741:58044:16:16:72:539:492:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f6:First, we restrict the set of alternative discharge destinationsJto include only two options,J=
19:742:58139:16:16:72:534:476:11:g_d0_f9:11:g_d0_f3:fD; Ug. Motivated by the summary statistics described in Section 3, optionDcovers the collection
19:743:58235:16:17:72:535:460:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of downstream destinations (SNF, IRF, and home with or without HHA) that are appropriate
19:744:58323:17:16:72:533:443:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for LTCH patients who are of better health or require lower levels ofmedical monitoring.  In
19:745:58415:16:16:72:535:427:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:contrast, optionUcovers upstream discharge destinations (ACH and hospice) which wouldbe
19:746:58502:16:16:72:390:411:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:natural discharge destinations for patients who are of worse health.
19:747:58570:16:17:88:536:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Because, conditional on discharge, nancial incentives do not a¤ect theLTCHs discharge des-
19:748:58662:17:16:72:537:378:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tination, having a richer set of discharge options is unlikely to a¤ect our counterfactual predictions.
19:749:58765:16:16:72:537:362:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:By focusing on two options, we essentially restrict the LTCH to consider two types of marginal
19:750:58859:16:16:72:537:346:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:LTCH patients. One set of marginal patient are those who are healthier, and for whom the hospital
19:751:58956:16:17:72:537:330:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:must consider whether to keep them or discharge them to locationD. The second set of marginal
19:752:59049:17:16:72:532:313:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:patients are sicker, and for whom the hospital must consider whether to keep them in the LTCH
19:753:59142:16:16:72:220:297:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:or transfer them to locationU.
19:754:59172:16:16:88:540:281:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The second assumption is about the health process. Given that mortality is monotone inh,
19:755:59260:16:17:72:535:265:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:it is convenient to normalize the health index by mortality risk. Wedo so by assuming thathis
19:756:59353:17:27:72:424:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:dened by its associated mortality hazard using the following relationship:
19:757:59428:27:27:264:536:221:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:m(h) = 1-\b(h),(6)
19:758:59446:27:16:72:536:194:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:where\b(-)is the standard normal CDF. We note thathis an index and thus has no cardinal mean-
19:759:59539:16:17:72:534:178:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ing, and the above is simply a normalization, which endowshwith a cardinal measure. Equipped
19:760:59631:17:16:72:536:161:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with this normalization, we then make parametric assumptions about the initial (as of LTCH ad-
19:761:59725:16:16:72:535:145:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:mission,t= 0) health distribution of newly admitted patients, and about how the health process
19:762:59819:16:16:72:534:129:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:evolves over time within the LTCH. Specically, we assume thathi;0is drawn fromN(-0; -20)and
19:763:59911:16:28:71:295:113:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:thatF(-jhi;t-1)follows a simple AR(1) process:

20:765:60001:0:17:71:535:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In our baseline specication, we allow the health process to be di¤erent inside the LTCH in the
20:766:60096:17:16:71:533:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:pre-PPS and PPS periods to accommodate potential di¤erences in the LTCH patient mix, which
20:767:60186:16:16:71:537:675:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:may result from the growth of the LTCH sector, time trends in medical technology and practice,
20:768:60280:16:16:71:533:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:or directly from the change in nancial incentives. Note that we do not need to model the health
20:769:60376:16:17:71:534:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:process outside the LTCH since any e¤ect of the post-discharge location on health would a¤ect the
20:770:60473:17:16:71:535:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:discharge decisions through its (unidentied) e¤ect on the continuation values,Vj(h), which we do
20:771:60570:16:16:71:166:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:not model explicitly.
20:772:60591:16:27:88:534:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The third assumption is associated with the LTCHs costs,cl(h), which we assume are given by
20:773:60683:27:28:264:536:567:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:cl(h) =\rcreported.(8)
20:774:60705:28:16:71:535:539:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:That is, as described in Section 2 and reported in the bottom row of Table1, we observe the
20:775:60796:16:16:71:535:523:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cost associated with each hospitall, which enters the formula by which it is paid by CMS. We
20:776:60888:16:16:71:536:507:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:use the averages reported there (separately for the pre-PPS and PPS periods) as our estimates of
20:777:60984:16:17:71:536:491:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:creported.  We do not treat these reported costs as the true costs, but we use it to guide our
20:778:61080:17:16:72:534:474:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:model of costs in two ways. First, and importantly, we assume that the hospitals cost do not vary
20:779:61178:16:16:72:539:458:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with the patient healthh, which is consistent with CMSs treatment of costs and also seems natural
20:780:61276:16:17:72:535:442:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:given that LTCH patients are generally stable. Second, we assume that the reported costs are true
20:781:61373:17:16:72:536:425:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:up to a monotone transformation, which we assume to be linear.  This assumption means that
20:782:61463:16:16:72:536:409:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:if hospitallhas higher reported costs than hospitalk, we will also assume that this also reects
20:783:61559:16:16:72:533:393:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the ranking of their true underlying costs.  This seems (to us) reasonable, and could be driven
20:784:61654:16:17:72:536:377:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:by a variety of factors, including geographic location. We expect\r-1, but do not impose this
20:785:61747:17:16:72:186:360:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:constraint in estimation.
20:786:61772:16:16:88:535:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The fourth assumption is to parameterizeVU(h)andVD(h).  We approximate each using a
20:787:61855:16:16:71:200:328:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:linear function inh, so that
20:788:61883:16:23:228:536:312:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:Vj(h) =-0j+-1jhforj=D; U.(9)
20:789:61911:23:16:71:535:289:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Recall from Section 3 that healthier patients (higherh), who are associated with lower mortality, are
20:790:62012:16:17:72:534:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:discharged toD, while sicker patients (lowerh), associated with higher mortality, are discharged to
20:791:62111:17:16:71:535:256:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:U. It is therefore natural to expect-1;D>0andv1;U<0. That is, all else equal, facilityDbecomes
20:792:62205:16:16:71:534:240:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a more attractive discharge destination as health gets better (his higher) and facilityUbecomes a
20:793:62302:16:16:72:537:224:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:more attractive discharge destination as patients health worsens (his lower). As explained below,
20:794:62400:16:17:71:471:208:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:one of the intercept termsv0;Dandv0;Uneeds to be normalized, so we setv0;U= 0.
20:795:62478:17:16:88:537:191:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Fifth, as we discussed in Section 2, LTCHs are part of an interlocking post-acute care system,
20:796:62572:16:16:71:537:175:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with changes in LTCH incentives potentially a¤ecting Medicare spending throughout the patients
20:797:62667:16:16:71:536:159:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:entire episode of care. In particular, Figure 5 shows sharp changes inboth upstream and down-
20:798:62760:16:17:71:537:143:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:stream post-discharge payments at the SSO threshold, indicating a relationship between patients
20:799:62856:17:16:71:534:126:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:health at discharge and total Medicare spending. To account for this typeof spillover e¤ects in
20:800:62951:16:16:71:535:110:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:our counterfactuals, we model the relationship between health at discharge and post-discharge
20:801:63044:16:16:71:125:94:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:payments as
20:802:63055:16:0:214:535:78:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:Pj(h) = exp(-0;j+-1;jh)forj=D; U,(10)
21:803:63094:0:17:71:534:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:wherePj(h)represents the post-discharge payments for a patient initially discharged to location
21:804:63189:17:16:71:535:691:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:j=D; Uwith health statushat the time of discharge. We allow this relationship to vary by whether
21:805:63285:16:16:71:534:675:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the patient is initially discharged upstream or downstream and use anexponential specication so
21:806:63381:16:16:71:355:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that predicted post-discharge payments are strictly positive.
21:807:63442:16:17:88:535:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Finally, as is typical in these types of models, we set (rather than estimate) the daily discount
21:808:63539:17:16:72:536:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:factor to-= 0:951=365.20Thus, overall we are left with 19 parameters to estimate: ve parame-
21:809:63632:16:16:71:535:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ters (-0; -0; -; -; -) that are associated with the health distribution and the way it evolves over
21:810:63731:16:17:71:535:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:time in the pre-PPS period, ve corresponding parameters in the PPSperiod, the cost parameters
21:811:63825:17:16:71:537:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(\r), four parameters (-1U; -0D; -1D; --) associated with the relative value of patients at facili-
21:812:63924:16:16:71:534:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tiesUandD, and four parameters associated with post-discharge payments in the PPS period
21:813:64012:16:19:71:172:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(-0;D; -1;D; -0;U; -1;U).
21:814:64037:19:17:88:535:526:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:Estimation.An important decision is how to treat heterogeneity across patients, observable
21:815:64127:17:16:71:536:509:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:health conditions, and LTCH hospitals. In our baseline specication,we abstract from such hetero-
21:816:64224:16:16:71:532:493:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:geneity and instead model the average discharge decision as it pertains to the average LTCH
21:817:64319:16:16:71:533:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:patient and the average payment schedule. That is, we pool all payment schedules observed in
21:818:64413:16:17:71:534:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the data, separately for the pre-PPS and PPS periods, measure each dayin the schedule relative to
21:819:64510:17:16:71:536:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the DRG-specic SSO threshold in the PPS period (which is normalized to day zero), and construct
21:820:64606:16:16:71:535:428:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the average payment schedule for each day, as shown in Figure 1. We thenapply an analogous
21:821:64696:16:16:71:534:412:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:exercise to the discharge pattern, and construct the distribution ofdischarge patterns in a 61-day
21:822:64794:16:17:71:535:396:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:window around the SSO threshold (from day -15 to day 45), as shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. We
21:823:64889:17:16:71:535:379:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:then estimate our model in an attempt to match these average patterns. The dramatic di¤erence
21:824:64982:16:16:71:537:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the payment schedules between the pre-PPS and PPS periods will assist in the identication of
21:825:65078:16:16:71:455:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:some of the parameters and it is an important component of our research design.
21:826:65157:16:17:88:536:331:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:An advantage of this approach of focusing on the average pattern rather than the heterogenous
21:827:65250:17:16:71:534:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:pattern is that it only requires us to solve the dynamic problem once (foreach period, pre-PPS and
21:828:65348:16:16:71:535:298:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:PPS), which is computationally attractive. Given that our primary focus is on the aggregate e¤ect
21:829:65445:16:16:71:536:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of nancial incentives across the entire LTCH sector, abstracting from the heterogeneity across pa-
21:830:65544:16:17:71:535:266:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tients and hospitals is likely to be inconsequential. That said, motivated by the descriptive evidence
21:831:65646:17:16:71:534:249:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in how for-prot and non-prot LTCHs di¤erentially respond to nancial incentives, we separately
21:832:65742:16:16:71:535:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:conduct a counterfactual analysis to explore the heterogeneous e¤ectsof nancial incentives for
21:833:65837:16:16:71:535:217:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:these two types of hospitals, which reveals some intriguing patterns.Heterogeneity in the response
21:834:65935:16:17:71:416:201:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is also the focus of the related exercise reported by Eliason et al. (2016).
21:835:66011:17:16:88:534:184:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We estimate the model using simulated method of moments, by trying to match the daily
21:836:66096:16:16:71:535:168:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:mortality and discharge patterns presented in Figure 4, as well as post-discharge payment moments
21:837:66193:16:16:71:536:152:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that are based on Figure 5. Specically, we use two sets of moments. First, we use 183 moments
21:838:66287:16:17:71:535:136:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for the pre-PPS payment schedule, reecting the daily discharge andmortality risks within the
21:839:66380:17:18:71:536:119:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:61-day window around the SSO threshold. One set of moments is associated with discharge rates
21:840:66473:18:17:80:535:101:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:20While having a discount factor so close to 1 might generally create convergence issues, in our Bellman equation
21:841:66586:17:13:71:537:84:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f13:the probability of survival enters jointly with the discount factor so that the e¤ective discount factor-(1-m(h))
21:842:66701:13:0:71:151:71:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:is not too close to 1.
22:843:66725:0:17:71:536:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:toD, another with discharge rates toU, and a third with mortality rates.  We then construct
22:844:66816:17:16:71:534:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:another set of 183 corresponding moments for the PPS period. Because much of the identication
22:845:66910:16:16:71:535:675:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is driven by the sharp change to discharge incentives at the SSO threshold, we assign greater weights
22:846:67011:16:16:71:534:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to moments that are closer to day zero (the SSO threshold) by making the weights decrease by
22:847:67103:16:17:71:535:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a constant amount (1/61) per day away from the threshold.  The second set ofmoments uses
22:848:67191:17:16:71:537:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the data on post-discharge payments to allow us to capture spillover e¤ects in our counterfactuals.
22:849:67290:16:16:71:534:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Specically, we average post-discharge payments for each discharge destination (UorD), separately
22:850:67387:16:17:72:534:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for discharges before and after the SSO threshold. We then match themto the model prediction
22:851:67479:17:16:72:534:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:regarding the health status distribution of discharged patients, thus allowing us to link health and
22:852:67579:16:16:72:195:561:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:post-discharge payments.21
22:853:67605:16:16:88:535:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Generating the model predictions requires us to solve the dynamic problem described in the
22:854:67695:16:17:71:534:529:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:previous section for each set of parameters. To ease with computation, we approximate the health
22:855:67791:17:16:71:536:512:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:processF(-jhi;t-1)with a discrete health space that evolves according to a Markov transition ma-
22:856:67887:16:16:71:535:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:trix (Tauchen, 1986).22This eases the solution of the dynamic problem, and at the same time
22:857:67978:16:16:71:535:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:allows us to read the discharge probabilities directly o¤ the solution, without any need to integrate
22:858:68079:16:20:71:429:464:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(presumably by simulation) over potentially intractable integration regions.
22:859:68155:20:16:88:537:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:Intuition for Identication.To see the intuition for the identication of the parameters,
22:860:68244:16:16:71:537:428:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:it is easiest to consider rst a case where health is homogeneous across patients and over time.
22:861:68340:16:16:71:536:412:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Under this assumption, the data can be characterized by daily observations of discharge shares
22:862:68434:16:17:71:532:396:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:toUand toD(sUtandsDt, respectively), with the remaining patients staying at the LTCH
22:863:68518:17:16:71:535:379:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(slt= 1-sUt-sDt). The problem resembles a repeated static discrete choice problem, where the
22:864:68610:16:16:71:535:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:mean utility of each discharge destination is given by the continuation valuesVUt,VDt, andVlt. As
22:865:68707:16:16:71:535:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is usual in multinomial logit models, the observed daily shares can then be inverted to recover the
22:866:68806:16:17:71:449:331:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:values ofVUt,VDt, andVlt, subject to a required level and scale normalizations.
22:867:68885:17:16:88:537:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Let us start with the level normalization, and consider discharge shares after the SSO threshold,
22:868:68982:16:16:71:535:298:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:where the model is in a steady state. SettingVUt= 0allows us to estimateVDfrom the average
22:869:69072:16:16:71:535:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:values ofVDtandVlt, up to a scale normalization. To identify the scale parameter--, consider
22:870:69164:16:17:71:534:266:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the discharge shares the day before the SSO threshold: the jump in payments introduces a sharp
22:871:69258:17:16:71:534:249:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:change in the continuation values, which identies the e¤ect of payments onVs, or equivalently
22:872:69353:16:16:72:535:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:identies--. Finally, the cost parameter\ris identied o¤ the non-stationarity of the model prior
22:873:69450:16:16:71:535:217:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to the SSO threshold, and the way discharge patterns are changing as the SSO threshold gets
22:874:69541:16:17:71:536:201:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:closer. As the SSO threshold nears, the expected (remaining) lengthof stay of patients shortens,
22:875:69637:17:16:71:536:184:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:making the expected life-time costs associated with a given patientgradually decline in a way that
22:876:69735:16:16:71:537:168:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is not proportional to expected payments, allowing us to separately identify the impact of cost.
22:877:69831:16:19:71:534:152:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Loosely,Vltvaries over time as a function of the payment schedulep(t), reported costs scaled by
22:878:69926:19:17:80:537:133:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:21Because there is no variation in payments in the pre-PPS period, we do not have the variation in dischargees
22:879:70037:17:13:71:534:116:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:health that we need to identify the pre-PPS post-discharge payments model. Since we focus on the PPS period in
22:880:70147:13:10:71:537:103:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:our counterfactuals, and therefore do not need these estimates, we do not estimate pre-PPS post discharge payments.
22:881:70262:10:17:80:536:93:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:22In particular, we approximate the health distribution witha grid of 250 evenly spaced values that span a range
22:882:70374:17:0:72:413:76:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:of +/- three standard deviations around the mean of the steady state health process.
23:883:70460:0:17:71:537:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:parameter\r, and the relevant time horizon, which depends on the mortality rate and subsequent,
23:884:70555:17:16:72:539:691:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f7:endogenous discharge decisions. So one can think of the identication ofthe scale parameter--
23:885:70648:16:16:71:536:675:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and\ras a projection of the values ofVlton these observables. The sharp change in payments
23:886:70738:16:16:71:535:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:at the SSO threshold provides a sharp change in the present value of payments and identies the
23:887:70833:16:17:71:530:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:scale parameter (or equivalently the coe¢cient on payments when thevariance of the error term
23:888:70926:17:16:71:535:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is standardized), and the di¤erential change in the present value ofpayments versus costs as the
23:889:71022:16:16:71:535:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:patient approaches the SSO threshold identies\r. This identication can be achieved from the
23:890:71115:16:17:71:534:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:PPS moments alone, but given that we restrict these parameters to be time-invariant, it is also

23:892:71287:16:16:88:537:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:If health statushwere observed, we could make the argument above conditional on health,
23:893:71374:16:16:72:536:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and thus identify each object as a non-parametric function ofh. In practicehis unobserved, but
23:894:71468:16:17:72:536:529:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:identifying the health process is conceptually easy given our assumptions. If there are no discharges,
23:895:71570:17:16:72:535:512:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:which is roughly the case during the rst week or so of the LTCH stay, the only attrition from the
23:896:71668:16:16:72:533:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:sample is due to mortality. With only ve parameters that determine the initial health distribution
23:897:71767:16:16:72:535:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and how it evolves from day to day, mortality rates over ve days are su¢cient to identify the
23:898:71861:16:17:72:534:464:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:health process parameters, separately in the pre-PPS and PPS periods.  Once the unobserved
23:899:71951:17:16:72:534:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:health distribution is identied, we can integrate overhand apply a similar intuition to the one
23:900:72047:16:16:72:535:431:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:we described above for the homogenoushcase. Moreover, once the health process is identied, the
23:901:72142:16:16:72:535:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cross-sectional distribution ofhvaries over time in known ways, so we can also identify how the
23:902:72239:16:17:71:534:399:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:key parameters  in particular theVs  vary as a function ofh. Finally, the relationship between
23:903:72336:17:16:72:536:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the health statushand the post-discharge payments is directly identied o¤ the data giventhat
23:904:72429:16:16:72:373:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the model does not impose any restrictions on this relationship.
23:905:72493:16:16:88:536:350:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Finally, the parameters of the post-discharge payments model (-0;D; -1;D; -0;U; -1;U) are identi-
23:906:72590:16:17:71:536:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ed by the sharp change in health of patients discharged on di¤erent sides of the SSO threshold.
23:907:72686:17:16:71:535:317:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:That is, they are essentially mapping the models prediction regarding the average health status
23:908:72782:16:16:71:537:301:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of dischargees before and after the SSO threshold to the corresponding average of observed post-
23:909:72878:16:16:71:534:285:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:discharge payments, which also exhibit a sharp change around the SSO threshold (as shown in
23:910:72969:16:17:71:115:269:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 5).
23:911:72979:17:16:88:536:252:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Obviously, as is typically the case, the intuition for identication requires us to have substantial
23:912:73079:16:16:71:536:236:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:variation in the data. In practice, some of the variation is not as large, and statistical power issues
23:913:73182:16:16:71:534:220:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:require us to impose more parametric structure, so the estimable modelis not as exible  especially
23:914:73282:16:32:71:526:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in terms of the extent to which parameters vary withh as the identiable structure would be.

23:916:73412:24:16:71:536:148:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Table 3 presents the parameter estimates. We estimate\r= 0:78implying that LTCHs actual costs
23:917:73506:16:16:71:535:132:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are 22% lower than their reported value. This is consistent with our prior that reported costs are
23:918:73604:16:17:71:107:116:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:inated.
23:919:73612:17:16:88:540:99:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The-1;U,-0;D, and-1;Dparameters capture the value the LTCH places on the patients utility
23:920:73702:16:0:71:535:83:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from being discharged toUorDrelative to remaining at the LTCH, as well as any potential e¤ect
24:921:73797:0:17:71:534:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on patient health evolution in the discharge location (relative to remaining at the LTCH). The
24:922:73891:17:16:71:534:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimates imply that LTCHs are indi¤erent betweenUandDfor a patient withh= 2:0, which
24:923:73976:16:16:71:533:675:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is a fairly low health level. For instance,h= 2:0is the 4.2th percentile of the steady state PPS
24:924:74072:16:16:71:535:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:health (normal) distribution (with estimated parameters-= 6:2and-= 2:4) and corresponds to a
24:925:74164:16:17:71:534:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:daily mortality hazard of 2.1%. Consistent with our description of patients owing downstream
24:926:74259:17:16:71:536:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as their health improves,Dis relatively better for healthier patients andUis better for sicker

24:928:74449:16:17:71:534:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as the slope parameterv1;U, which indicates that a given change in nancial incentives will have a
24:929:74547:17:16:71:534:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:much larger e¤ect on discharges on the downstreamDmargin. These estimates are consistent with
24:930:74640:16:16:71:535:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the descriptive evidence that shows a substantially larger responseon the downstream margin at
24:931:74734:16:16:71:158:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the SSO threshold.
24:932:74752:16:17:88:536:529:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Relative to the slope parameters-1;Uand-1;D, the scale parameter--on the logit error is
24:933:74839:17:16:71:530:512:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:fairly small. The estimates imply that a tenth of a standard deviation increase in the error term
24:934:74936:16:16:71:535:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f6:increases the value of discharging a patient to a given location by$71, the product of--= 550
24:935:75029:16:0:71:344:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f5:and a tenth of a standard deviation of the logit error (-=

24:937:75088:9:16:358:534:480:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f3:6). In contrast, a tenth of a standard
24:938:75126:16:17:71:536:464:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:deviation increase in steady state health index (-= 2:4) raises the value of discharging a patient
24:939:75224:17:16:72:531:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:downstream by$1;523(= 0:1-2:4-6;330) and lowers the value of discharging a patient upstream
24:940:75315:16:16:72:534:431:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:by$7;274(= 0:1-2:4-30;230), indicating that health status is capturing most of the unobserved
24:941:75408:16:16:72:241:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:heterogeneity in discharge behavior.
24:942:75444:16:17:88:534:399:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The-0;U,-1;U,-0;D, and-1;Dparameters capture the relationship between health at discharge
24:943:75533:17:16:71:537:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and post-discharge payments in the PPS period. Consistent with our interpretation of Figure 5,
24:944:75627:16:16:71:537:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the estimates indicate that post-discharge payments are decliningas the patient gets healthier,
24:945:75722:16:16:71:537:350:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with semi-elasticities of-1;U=-0:79and-1;D=-0:27on the upstream and downstream margins,
24:946:75809:16:17:71:126:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:respectively.
24:947:75822:17:16:88:535:317:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We are cautious not to over-interpret the change between the pre-PPS and PPS periods in the
24:948:75913:16:16:71:535:301:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:health process parameters. Because they are the only parameters that are allowed to vary across
24:949:76008:16:16:71:534:285:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the time periods, they capture not only di¤erences in the health of admitted patients but may also
24:950:76106:16:17:71:535:269:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:reect other factors that vary over time, such as changes in medical technology or the administrative
24:951:76207:17:16:71:170:252:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:capacity of providers.
24:952:76229:16:16:88:535:236:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The model ts the data reasonably well.  Figure 8 presents our discharge moments and the
24:953:76317:16:16:71:534:220:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:simulated moments from the estimated model. The left column shows values in the PPS period
24:954:76407:16:17:71:535:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and the right column shows values in the pre-PPS period. The top row shows the share of discharges
24:955:76505:17:16:71:534:187:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:toUby day relative to the SSO threshold, the middle row shows the share ofdischarges toD, and
24:956:76598:16:16:72:534:171:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the bottom row shows the share of patients who die at the LTCH. The model does a very good job
24:957:76692:16:17:72:535:155:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tting the spike in discharges toUandDin the PPS period. This is particularly encouraging
24:958:76783:17:16:72:534:138:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:because this variation is our key source of identifying variation. Themodel t for the mortality
24:959:76879:16:16:72:535:122:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:patterns in the pre-PPS and PPS periods is good over the initial days, but less good at longer time
24:960:76978:16:16:72:535:106:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:horizons. This is likely due to our fairly parsimonious parameterizationof the health process. The
24:961:77076:16:17:72:385:90:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:model t is also poorer for discharges toUin the pre-PPS period.
24:962:77140:17:0:88:534:73:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 9 provides some intuition for how the model operates, illustrating the policy function
25:963:77237:0:17:71:536:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:at the estimated parameters.23Healthy patients (higherh) are discharged toD, while sick patients
25:964:77333:17:16:71:535:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(lowerh) are discharged toU. Consistent with the descriptive evidence, LTCHs work down the
25:965:77424:16:16:72:534:675:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:distribution at the jump and lower their discharge threshold on theDmargin and conversely work
25:966:77519:16:16:71:534:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:up the distribution on theUmargin and increase the discharge threshold. The larger shift on
25:967:77612:16:17:72:535:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:theDmargin relative to theUmargin relates directly to our discussion above on the magnitude
25:968:77703:17:16:72:534:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the slope parameter estimates (v1;Dandv1;U). The relatively small outward shift in the policy
25:969:77799:16:16:71:534:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:function just before the SSO threshold is consistent with the descriptive results which show limited
25:970:77899:16:32:71:420:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:evidence on missing mass immediately to the left of the SSO threshold.
25:971:77971:32:24:71:379:562:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:4.4  The e¤ects of counterfactual nancial incentives
25:972:78024:24:16:71:536:538:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We use our model to simulate discharge patterns and Medicare payments under a variety of coun-
25:973:78118:16:16:71:536:522:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:terfactual payment schedules. Throughout this section, we assume that the initial distribution of
25:974:78215:16:16:71:535:506:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:health of admitted patients stays the same but that the subsequent discharge decisions reect the
25:975:78312:16:17:71:360:490:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:incentives provided by the counterfactual payment schedules.
25:976:78372:17:16:88:533:473:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We limit our attention to alternative schedules that maintain the current practice of a cap
25:977:78463:16:16:71:536:457:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on payments after a certain number of days.  We do this both because it respects the current
25:978:78555:16:16:71:535:441:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:policy approach toward LTCH payments and because an uncapped schedule would lead to a
25:979:78642:16:17:71:536:425:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:small number of long hospitals stays, which is outside of the variation in our data. Specically,
25:980:78739:17:16:71:534:408:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:we consider three main types of counterfactuals: payment schedules that remove the jump while
25:981:78832:16:16:71:535:392:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:holding the threshold day constant, payment schedules that eliminate the jump (and allow the
25:982:78924:16:16:71:536:376:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:threshold day to vary) while holding LTCHs harmless, and cost-based reimbursement at a constant
25:983:79019:16:20:71:358:360:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:per diem, capped at 60 days. We discuss each in turn below.
25:984:79078:20:16:88:537:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:Removing the jump.We start by considering two simple modications of the baseline pay-
25:985:79164:16:16:72:535:324:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ment schedule that eliminate the jump in payments at the SSO threshold, but, like the baseline
25:986:79258:16:16:72:537:308:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:PPS payment schedule, provide no payments on the margin for stays in excess of the SSO threshold.
25:987:79355:16:17:72:537:292:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 10 plots these counterfactual payment schedules and the baseline schedule for comparison.
25:988:79451:17:16:72:534:275:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The top panel shows a counterfactual we call higher rate per day, whicheliminates the jump by
25:989:79546:16:16:72:535:259:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:increasing the per-diem payment from $1,384 to $2,151 prior to the SSO threshold but holds the
25:990:79640:16:16:72:535:243:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:post-threshold payment xed. The bottom panel shows a counterfactual schedule we call lower
25:991:79732:16:17:72:535:227:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cap, which eliminates the jump in payments at the SSO threshold byreducing the PPS payment
25:992:79823:17:16:72:536:210:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from $34,419 to $22,144 but holds the pre-SSO per diem payment xed.  The higher rate per
25:993:79913:16:16:72:536:194:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:day contract is weakly more generous than the baseline schedule, whilethe lower cap contract
25:994:80008:16:17:72:180:178:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is weakly less generous.

25:996:80117:16:16:72:536:145:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:counterfactuals. Figure 11 shows the policy functions under each payment schedule, Figure 12 shows
25:997:80215:16:18:72:533:129:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the discharge patterns, and Table 4 summarizes the impact of each of these payments schedules on

26:1002:80690:17:16:88:534:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The black dashed lines in Figure 11 show the policy function under thehigher rate per day
26:1003:80781:16:16:71:534:675:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:counterfactual. During the rst few days, the policy function is similar to that under the observed
26:1004:80880:16:16:71:535:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:schedule. However, as the length-of-stay increases, the elimination of the jump reduces the incentive
26:1005:80981:16:17:71:537:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to retain patients, and the policy function shifts inwards on the upstream and downstream margins.
26:1006:81079:17:16:71:534:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The black dashed lines in Figure 12 shows discharge patterns underthis counterfactual. Mirroring
26:1007:81175:16:16:71:534:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the changes in the policy function, the higher rate per day counterfactual increases discharges in
26:1008:81275:16:17:71:535:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the 10 days prior to the SSO threshold, relative to the observed schedule. As shown in column (2)
26:1009:81372:17:16:71:505:577:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:of Table 4, these higher discharge rates reduce average length of stay by 1.9 days or 7.2%.24
26:1010:81465:16:16:88:537:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Despite the signicantly higher per-day payments prior to the jump ($2,151 versus $1,384),
26:1011:81555:16:16:71:535:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Medicare payments to LTCHs increase by a very small amount of $369 or 1%. The small increase
26:1012:81647:16:17:71:536:529:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is due to a large behavioral response to the incentives. Holding discharge patterns xed, LTCHs
26:1013:81742:17:16:71:535:512:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:would get paid about 50% more per day for stays below the SSO threshold, butin response to the
26:1014:81836:16:16:71:534:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:elimination of the jump, patients are now discharged earlier, so overall payments are lower. Holding
26:1015:81936:16:16:71:534:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:discharge patterns xed, we calculate that the mechanical e¤ect of this counterfactual is a $1,767
26:1016:82034:16:17:71:537:464:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:increase in Medicare payments to the LTCH, implying that the behavioral response to the removal
26:1017:82129:17:16:71:535:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the jump reduces Medicare payments to the LTCH by $1,398 per admission. LTCH prots per
26:1018:82219:16:16:71:414:431:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:admission rise by about $2,483 or 37% relative to the observed schedule.
26:1019:82291:16:16:88:534:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We next explore the e¤ects of the lower cap payment schedule.  The grey lines in Figure
26:1020:82380:16:17:72:535:399:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:11 show the policy function under this counterfactual. The elimination of the jump in payments
26:1021:82474:17:16:72:535:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:shifts the policy function inwards during the entire pre-threshold period, relative to that under the
26:1022:82575:16:16:72:535:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:observed schedule. The grey lines in Figure 12 show that discharges correspondingly rise, with the
26:1023:82673:16:16:72:534:350:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:daily share of discharges toDincreasing four-fold and the share of discharges toUincreasing more
26:1024:82769:16:17:72:533:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:modestly over most of the pre-threshold period. As shown in column (3) of Table 4, average length
26:1025:82866:17:16:72:535:317:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of stay is reduced by 4.5 days, and payments to the LTCH are reducedby $11,954 or 43%. The
26:1026:82956:16:16:72:535:301:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:mechanical e¤ect (holding observed discharge patterns xed) of the lower cap payment schedule
26:1027:83051:16:16:72:531:285:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is a reduction in payments of $8,844 or about 74% of the overall reduction, with the remaining 26%
26:1028:83149:16:17:72:534:269:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:due to the behavioral response. LTCH prots per admission fall by over $6,954 per admission and
26:1029:83244:17:16:72:342:252:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are estimated to be negative, a point we return to below.
26:1030:83301:16:16:88:536:236:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The remaining rows of Table 4 consider the impact of these counterfactual payment schedules
26:1031:83392:16:16:72:535:220:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on Medicare payments throughout the rest of the episode of care. For thesecounterfactuals, the
26:1032:83486:16:17:72:536:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:spillovers on post-discharge payments are small. For the higher rate per day counterfactual, post-
26:1033:83586:17:16:72:535:187:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:discharge payments for patients dischargedUandDare a¤ected by a few hundred dollars. For
26:1034:83674:16:16:72:537:171:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the lower cap counterfactuals, the decrease in post discharge payments is larger but still small
26:1035:83772:16:17:72:536:155:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:compared to decrease in LTCH payments. Combining the e¤ects on LTCH payments and post-
26:1036:83858:17:16:72:536:138:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:discharge payments, our estimates indicate that the higher rate per day has virtually no e¤ect
26:1037:83954:16:19:72:535:122:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on total Medicare payments ($70 increase) and the lower cap reduces total Medicare payments
26:1038:84047:19:17:80:536:103:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:24Length of stay is measured from day -15. However, because theaverage SSO threshold across admissions in our
26:1039:84156:17:13:71:535:86:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:sample is 22.5 days, values for length of stay need to be increased by 7.5 (=22.5-15) days to match the summary
26:1040:84267:13:0:71:89:73:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:data.
27:1041:84274:0:17:71:224:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:by a substantial $12,467 or 26%.
27:1042:84306:17:16:88:535:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:While interesting, neither of the above counterfactuals is fully satisfactory. While the lower
27:1043:84401:16:16:71:536:675:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cap counterfactual suggests that alternative payment schedules couldsubstantially reduce Medicare
27:1044:84499:16:16:71:534:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:payments, the large decrease in LTCH revenue (and in estimated prots) might have unintended
27:1045:84591:16:17:71:537:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:consequences. For instance, under this payment schedule, LTCHs might cut back on socially valu-
27:1046:84686:17:16:71:537:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:able xed investments or even exit the market. In contrast, the higher rate per day counterfactual,
27:1047:84787:16:16:71:535:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:while clearly making LTCHs better o¤, has virtually no e¤ect on Medicarepayments. Yet, these two
27:1048:84883:16:17:71:536:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:exercises suggest that there might be intermediate contracts that generate cost savings without
27:1049:84980:17:19:71:435:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the risk of unintended consequences. We explore such counterfactuals below.
27:1050:85055:19:16:88:534:558:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:Win-win payment schedules. With the above considerations in mind, we now consider a
27:1051:85140:16:16:71:534:542:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:set of counterfactuals that hold LTCH revenue xed under the observed discharge patterns. Faced
27:1052:85235:16:17:71:537:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with these contracts, if LTCHs do not change their behavior, they will have identical revenue,
27:1053:85329:17:16:71:535:509:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:costs, and prots as they would under the observed payment schedule. If the LTCH change their
27:1054:85422:16:16:71:535:493:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:behavior, by revealed preferences, they must be (weakly) bettero¤. Therefore, by design, these
27:1055:85516:16:16:71:335:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:contracts should not have a negative impact on LTCHs.
27:1056:85569:16:17:88:536:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In the same spirit as the previous counterfactuals, we consider contracts that pay a constant
27:1057:85662:17:16:72:535:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:per-diem amount up to a threshold length of stay, at which point the payments are capped and per
27:1058:85758:16:16:72:535:428:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:diem payments drop to zero (obviously, with no jump). We considercontracts where the payment
27:1059:85850:16:16:72:535:412:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is capped at thresholds in a +/- 10 day range on either side of the currentSSO threshold day. Since
27:1060:85949:16:17:72:534:396:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the generosity of the contract is strictly increasing in the per diem rate, for a given length of stay
27:1061:86051:17:16:72:534:379:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:at which payments are capped, there is a unique payment schedule that holds LTCH revenue xed
27:1062:86144:16:16:72:250:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:under the baseline discharge patterns.
27:1063:86182:16:16:88:536:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 13 plots a set of these contracts, where to avoid overcrowding the gure, we show payment
27:1064:86278:16:17:72:531:331:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:schedules for only a subset of the 21 contracts considered. The toppanel of Figure 14 plots LTCH
27:1065:86374:17:16:72:534:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:payments against total Medicare payments (including estimated post-discharge payments) for each
27:1066:86469:16:16:72:535:298:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the contracts we consider. The bottom panel of Figure 14 plots estimated LTCH prots against
27:1067:86564:16:16:72:535:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Medicare payments for each contract. For comparison, both plots also show outcomes under the
27:1068:86656:16:17:72:201:266:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:observed payment schedule.
27:1069:86682:17:16:88:535:249:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The gures indicate that there is a broad set of win-win payment schedules that reduce
27:1070:86770:16:16:72:534:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:total Medicare payments for the episode of care while leaving LTCHs (weakly) better o¤. Every
27:1071:86863:16:16:72:533:217:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:counterfactual contract with a threshold between -8 and 8 days reduces Medicare spending, although
27:1072:86961:16:17:72:534:201:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:there is substantial heterogeneity in the reduction. LTCH revenues increase for every contract with
27:1073:87060:17:16:72:535:184:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a threshold of 6 to 10 days and declines for contracts with a threshold of -10 to 5 days. Because
27:1074:87157:16:16:72:534:168:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:LTCHs value both prots and patient utility, LTCH prots under counterfactuals do not necessarily
27:1075:87254:16:17:72:534:152:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:increase. LTCH prots are higher than their baseline level for contracts with a threshold -10 to
27:1076:87350:17:16:72:535:135:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:2 days and are lower for thresholds of 3 to 10 days. Counterfactuals thatdecrease prots do not
27:1077:87445:16:16:72:244:119:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:lower them by a substantial amount.
27:1078:87480:16:0:88:535:103:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The counterfactual with payment threshold of 1 day more than the current SSO threshold results
28:1079:87576:0:17:71:536:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the largest reduction in Medicare spending and is a natural contract to focus on.25Column (4)
28:1080:87672:17:16:71:534:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of Table 4 shows outcomes for this contract. Under this payment schedule, Medicare payments to
28:1081:87766:16:16:71:535:675:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:LTCHs are reduced by $1,660 or 5.9%. Accounting for Medicare payments acrossthe entire episode
28:1082:87860:16:16:71:535:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of care leads to somewhat higher savings of $2,145, or 4.5% of total episode payments. Despite the
28:1083:87958:16:17:71:536:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:reduced payments, LTCH prots rise by $344 per stay or 5.1%: the  decline in LTCH revenue is
28:1084:88050:17:19:71:396:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:o¤set by lower costs, as length of stay is almost 2 days (9%) shorter.
28:1085:88120:19:16:88:534:607:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:Cost-based payment schedules.The last two columns of Table 4 report results from two
28:1086:88204:16:17:71:535:591:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:additional counterfactuals that explore cost-based reimbursement as a constant per diem rate. The
28:1087:88301:17:16:71:535:574:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rst counterfactual pays LTCHs a constant per diem of their estimated costs, which is $1,107 per
28:1088:88397:16:16:71:536:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:day. The second counterfactual pays LTCHs a constant per diem of $507, which is the average per
28:1089:88492:16:16:71:534:542:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:day payment to SNFs during the post-discharge period. We think about this counterfactual as a
28:1090:88585:16:17:71:535:526:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:form of reference based pricing where Medicare pays LTCHs the opportunity cost to Medicare
28:1091:88677:17:16:71:536:509:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the patient  i.e., the amount Medicare would have incurred for thepatient at a location that
28:1092:88773:16:16:71:534:493:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:provides fairly similar care (at least for the marginal patient). To avoid extrapolating too far outside
28:1093:88877:16:16:71:535:477:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of our data, for both of these counterfactuals we cap payments after 60 days, which leads LTCHs
28:1094:88972:16:17:71:483:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to discharge virtually all of their patients within 90 days of the current SSO threshold.
28:1095:89061:17:16:88:535:444:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Paying LTCHs their estimated costs leads to a substantial $7,010 increase in payments to LTCHs
28:1096:89155:16:16:71:532:428:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and a smaller $3,530 overall increase in total Medicare payments. Paymentsincrease because LTCH
28:1097:89250:16:16:71:535:412:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:retain patients for longer time periods rather than discharging them toSNFs where Medicare
28:1098:89340:16:17:71:534:396:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:payments would be lower, with average length of stay increasing from 19.2 to 32.4 days. Paying
28:1099:89434:17:16:71:537:379:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:LTCHs the average per-diem for SNFs leads to a massive decrease in LTCH payments and total
28:1100:89524:16:16:71:536:363:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Medicare payments, accompanied by a sharp reduction in length of stay. Of course, concerns about
28:1101:89620:16:16:71:534:347:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:unintended consequences, which we discussed in the context of the lower cap schedule, are also
28:1102:89716:16:20:71:132:331:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:relevant here.

28:1104:89812:16:16:72:537:295:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:evidence where we split the sample by whether the LTCH was a for-prot or non-prot hospital.
28:1105:89905:16:16:72:536:279:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In particular, we showed that while payment schedules were similarfor for-prot and non-prot
28:1106:89998:16:17:72:536:263:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:LTCHs, for-prots exhibited a larger increase in discharges at theSSO threshold, suggesting that
28:1107:90094:17:16:72:535:246:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:these facilities are more responsive to nancial incentives. Our model allows us to quantify the
28:1108:90190:16:16:72:536:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:magnitude of the di¤erences in for-prot and non-prot behavior, and to adjust for potential di¤er-
28:1109:90289:16:16:72:534:214:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ences in the health of the patients admitted to these facilities to more precisely isolate heterogeneity
28:1110:90393:16:17:72:215:198:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in their response to incentives.
28:1111:90425:17:16:88:535:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To conduct this analysis, we estimate the model allowing all of the parameters except those
28:1112:90516:16:16:72:536:165:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:governing post-discharge payments to vary by for-prot status. We forcethe post-discharge pay-
28:1113:90610:16:17:72:536:149:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ments parameters to be the same because, conditional onhat discharge, post-discharge payments
28:1114:90703:17:16:72:537:132:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:should not depend on whether the patient was discharged from a for-prot ornon-prot hospital.
28:1115:90797:16:18:72:535:116:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In addition, requiring the parameters to be equal helps ensure that the health process has the same
28:1116:90896:18:17:80:537:98:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:25By contrast, we achieve the highest Medicare dissavings with the counterfactual with the payment threshold of
28:1117:91007:17:0:71:280:81:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:-10 days, where Medicare spending rises by over 2%.
29:1118:91060:0:17:71:361:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cardinal interpretation across these di¤erent types of LTCHs.
29:1119:91121:17:16:88:534:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Appendix Table A4 shows the parameter estimates. The health process parameters are broadly
29:1120:91211:16:16:71:536:675:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:similar across the two types of hospitals. The point estimate for costs is somewhat lower for for-
29:1121:91309:16:16:71:537:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:prot (\r= 0:81) than non-prot (\r= 0:91) hospitals, which is consistent with higher operational
29:1122:91406:16:17:71:534:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:e¢ciency by the private sector. The point estimates on the slope parameters (v1;Uandv1;D) are also
29:1123:91504:17:16:72:535:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:smaller in absolute value for for-prots than non-prots, indicating thatfor-prots are more elastic
29:1124:91604:16:16:72:535:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to nancial incentives in their discharge decisions. We note, however, that the non-prot parameters
29:1125:91704:16:17:72:515:594:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are less precisely estimated so that the di¤erences are only sometimes statistically signicant.
29:1126:91800:17:16:88:537:577:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Comparing for-prots and non-prots parameter by parameter is not particularly insightful.
29:1127:91890:16:16:72:536:561:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Therefore, to quantify the di¤erence between for- and non-prots over the full set of parameters,
29:1128:91987:16:16:72:536:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Table 5 conducts the counterfactual of assigning every LTCH for-prot versus non-prot status.
29:1129:92081:16:17:72:535:529:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:For reference, column (1) shows outcomes under the observed organizational form. To construct
29:1130:92174:17:16:72:535:512:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:column (2), we assign all LTCHs the\r,-1;U,-0;D,-1;D, and--estimates for for-prot hospitals
29:1131:92266:16:16:71:533:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:but maintain the heterogenous health process parameters so that thereis no change in the health
29:1132:92363:16:16:71:540:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:distribution of the patients. For column (3), we assign all LTCHs the non-prot estimates for\r,
29:1133:92459:16:17:72:346:464:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:-1;U,-0;D,-1;D, and--and hold the health process xed.
29:1134:92513:17:16:88:536:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Consistent with the increased responsiveness to incentives, payments to LTCHs are $458 (or
29:1135:92603:16:16:71:535:431:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:about 1.7%) higher under the all for-prot than the all non-prot counterfactual. We estimate
29:1136:92700:16:16:71:536:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that LTCH prots are more than twice as large ($5,681 versus $2,590) under the counterfactual
29:1137:92793:16:17:71:536:399:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:where they are all for-prot. Interestingly, the $458 higher payments only accounts for about one-
29:1138:92891:17:16:71:537:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:fth of the higher prots, with the majority of the di¤erence being dueto lower estimated costs.
29:1139:92987:16:16:71:536:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Accounting for post-discharge payments, the estimates imply that the counterfactual of convert-
29:1140:93083:16:16:71:536:350:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ing all LTCHs from for-prot to non-prot status would reduce total Medicare payments across
29:1141:93176:16:17:71:534:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the entire episode of care by $1,376 or about 2.9% of their current level, holding the distribution
29:1142:93275:17:19:71:177:317:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of patient health xed.
29:1143:93298:19:16:88:535:298:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f3:Robustness.In our baseline model, we made a number of parametric assumptions. In order
29:1144:93384:16:16:71:535:282:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to assess the sensitivity of our main results to these assumptions, Table 6reports the main results
29:1145:93483:16:17:71:535:266:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from a subset of the (many) alternative specications that we examined.The results appear to be
29:1146:93578:17:16:71:164:249:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:qualitatively robust.
29:1147:93599:16:16:88:534:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In our rst alternative specication, we relax the assumption that the health process is stationary
29:1148:93698:16:16:71:539:217:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f6:by allowing the auto-correlation parameter-to vary with length-of-stay according to-=-0+
29:1149:93786:16:17:72:535:201:11:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f3:-1ln(t+ 1), where the time index is dened such that the patient is admitted on datet= 0:26
29:1150:93877:17:16:72:534:184:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:While in the pre-PPS period-1is very close to zero, in the PPS period the estimate is slightly
29:1151:93971:16:16:71:535:168:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:negative-1=-0:005, which is consistent with health becoming less stable over the course of the
29:1152:94065:16:16:72:535:152:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:stay.  However, as shown in Panel B of Table 6, enriching the specication in this manner has
29:1153:94158:16:17:72:534:136:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:virtually no e¤ect on the counterfactuals. We also specied other models of health processes, such
29:1154:94256:17:18:72:534:119:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as a random walk and a random walk with a drift, but the ability of these models to t the data
29:1155:94351:18:17:80:536:101:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:26We assume that the correlation parameter becomes xed after45 days at a value of-=-0 +-1ln(46)so that
29:1156:94454:17:13:72:536:84:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:the dynamic programming problem becomes stationary fort >45, allowing us to solve thet >45problem by value
29:1157:94560:13:0:72:319:71:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:function iteration and earlier periods by backwards induction.
30:1158:94624:0:17:71:296:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:was much worse than our baseline specication.
30:1159:94670:17:16:88:535:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The second specication reported in Table 6 ts the model using onlythe PPS moments. The
30:1160:94758:16:16:71:534:675:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:counterfactuals, shown in Panel C of Table 3, are very similar to the baseline estimates, suggesting
30:1161:94858:16:16:71:535:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that the sharp jump in payments at the SSO threshold, relative to over-time variation from the
30:1162:94952:16:17:71:536:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:implementation of LTCH-PPS, is the key driver of the results. The limited importance of the over-
30:1163:95049:17:16:71:534:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:time variation presumably stems from the fact that we allow distinct health process parameters in
30:1164:95146:16:38:71:377:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:each period, thereby soaking up much of the over-time variation.
30:1165:95210:38:27:71:172:572:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:5  Conclusions
30:1166:95224:27:16:71:537:545:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In this paper, we examined the impact of provider nancial incentives in post-acute care (PAC),
30:1167:95319:16:17:71:534:529:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a setting with large stakes both for the government budget and patient health that has received
30:1168:95414:17:16:71:537:512:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:scant attention in the academic literature. Within the context of PAC,we examined the impact of
30:1169:95509:16:16:71:534:496:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a jump in Medicare payments to long term care hospitals (LTCHs) that occurs after a pre-specied
30:1170:95605:16:16:71:535:480:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:length of stay, when reimbursement shifts from a per diem rate to a lump sum payment. At the
30:1171:95697:16:17:71:534:464:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:threshold, the payment for keeping an individual another day jumps byabout $13,000, with no
30:1172:95788:17:16:71:355:447:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:marginal payment for additional days beyond the threshold.
30:1173:95846:16:16:88:535:431:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The descriptive evidence shows a large response by LTCHs to the jump in payments. At the
30:1174:95934:16:16:72:536:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:threshold, there is a large spike in discharges.  The marginal patient a¤ected by the payment
30:1175:96027:16:17:72:535:399:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:threshold is relatively healthy. We are unable to detect any impacton patient mortality at the
30:1176:96121:17:16:72:305:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:threshold, even in this high-mortality population.
30:1177:96171:16:16:88:534:366:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To examine the implications of alternative payment schedules, we specied and estimated a
30:1178:96260:16:16:71:537:350:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:stylized dynamic model of LTCH discharge behavior which allows us to model LTCH behavior,
30:1179:96349:16:17:71:535:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:payments, and prots, as well as total Medicare payments for the episodeof care, under alternative
30:1180:96447:17:16:71:534:317:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:payment schedules.  We used the estimated model to search for win-win contracts that hold
30:1181:96538:16:16:71:535:301:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:LTCHs (and presumably its patients as well) harmless, while reducingMedicare payments. The
30:1182:96628:16:16:71:535:285:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:contract with the largest Medicare savings reduced total Medicare payments by 5% while increasing
30:1183:96725:16:17:71:249:269:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:LTCH prots by a similar percentage.
30:1184:96761:17:16:88:535:252:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We also considered more aggressive payment schedules that resulted in substantially higher
30:1185:96851:16:16:71:533:236:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Medicare savings but raised the possibility of unintended consequences due to a large reduction in
30:1186:96949:16:16:71:535:220:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:LTCH prots. In particular, in our model we take admission to the LTCH asgiven and focus on the
30:1187:97044:16:17:71:535:204:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:impact of counterfactual policies on length of stay and payments to theLTCH and post-discharge
30:1188:97138:17:16:71:535:187:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:costs for this xed set of patients. However, the large reduction inprots brought about in our
30:1189:97233:16:16:71:536:171:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:more aggressive counterfactuals may a¤ect which patients are admitted to anLTCH and might
30:1190:97322:16:17:71:536:155:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:have even broader e¤ects on the market, for instance through entry and exit decisions. We consider
30:1191:97420:17:16:71:534:138:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:an important area for further work to move up the healthcare pathway and model the decision
30:1192:97513:16:16:71:438:122:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to discharge from an acute hospital stay to an LTCH or other PAC facilities.
30:1193:97589:16:16:88:536:106:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:More broadly, our results indicate how economic models and data can be combined to better
30:1194:97678:16:17:71:535:90:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:inform contract design. Little other than common sense was needed to see thatsomealternative
30:1195:97770:17:0:72:535:73:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:payment schedule should be better for both the Medicare payer and theLTCH. Data and descriptive
31:1196:97867:0:17:71:535:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:evidence, however, were important to move beyond this conceptual existence proof to demonstrate
31:1197:97964:17:16:71:534:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a quantitatively meaningful behavioral response by the LTCH to the current payment schedule. An
31:1198:98059:16:16:71:534:675:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:economic model and its estimates were necessary to identify specic contracts that could create a
31:1199:98156:16:16:71:535:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:win-win for the LTCH and Medicare payments given the LTCHs optimizing behavioral response
31:1200:98248:16:17:71:535:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to alternative contracts. While naturally our results are specic to our particular setting, we hope
31:1201:98348:17:16:71:536:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that this type of approach can inform future work examining the impact of provider nancial
31:1202:98439:16:38:71:505:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:incentives not only for the directly a¤ected provider but throughout the healthcare system.

33:1259:102383:27:16:71:535:636:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Our starting point of the analysis is an admission to an LTCH. We can observe all discharge

33:1261:102570:16:16:71:534:604:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In the PPS period, 14% of patients die during their LTCH stay, another 11% are discharged
33:1262:102659:16:17:71:534:588:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:upstream (with the vast majority going to inpatient care) and 75% are discharged downstream
33:1263:102754:17:16:71:534:571:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(with approximately half of these patients going to a SNF/IRF and 40% going home, where they
33:1264:102846:16:16:71:223:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:may receive care from an HHA).
33:1265:102876:16:16:88:534:539:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We dene a post-discharge episode of care as the spell of almost continuous days following
33:1266:102968:16:17:71:537:523:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:discharge from an LTCH with Medicare payments to an ACH, SNF/IRF or LTCH. In particular,
33:1267:103056:17:16:71:526:506:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the episode ends if there are at least two days without Medicare payments to these institutions.
33:1268:103152:16:16:88:535:490:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Although we can observe all discharge destinations within the episode of care, we only observe

33:1270:103333:16:17:71:534:458:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that we do not observe payments or days at HHAs or hospices, we supplement theMedPAR data
33:1271:103422:17:16:71:534:441:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with annual spending and utilization from the Beneciary Summary File (BSF) Cost & Utilization
33:1272:103516:16:16:71:534:425:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:le. For every stay in the MedPAR data, we observe whether the patient was discharged to an
33:1273:103607:16:16:71:531:409:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:HHA or hospice at some point in the episode of care. For patients who were discharged to an HHA
33:1274:103702:16:17:71:466:393:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:or hospice, we impute the patients payments and days using the annual BSFdata.
33:1275:103781:17:16:88:535:376:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Since these annual amounts include some payments and days that occur before or after the
33:1276:103869:16:16:71:536:360:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:episode of care, our imputation likely leads us to overestimate post-discharge Medicare payments
33:1277:103967:16:17:71:534:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and days. However, we think that the approach provides a reasonable approximation. Appendix
33:1278:104058:17:16:71:534:327:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Table A2 shows that our estimates of post-discharge payments and facility days are not a¤ected
33:1279:104152:16:38:71:451:311:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:much if we instead impute 0 costs for HHA and hospice, and 0 days for hospice.

33:1287:104731:23:16:71:536:126:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In contrast to the cost-based system, which had reimbursed hospitals based on the estimated cost of
33:1288:104830:16:17:71:535:110:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:each patients case, the PPS outlined a xed reimbursement amount for each patient, based on the
33:1289:104926:17:16:71:535:93:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:patients DRG. These DRG-based lump-sum payments were meant to reect the typical resources
33:1290:105017:16:0:71:533:77:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:consumed by each type of patient. However, in order to discourage short stays in hospitals which
34:1291:105115:0:17:71:534:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:were meant to provide long-term care, the PPS includes a short stay outlier (SSO) threshold, with
34:1292:105212:17:16:71:534:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:reduced payments below the full DRG payment for LTCH patients whoare discharged before a

34:1300:105582:27:16:88:535:491:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This payment structure is similar to the much-studied Inpatient PPS used for (regular) acute

34:1302:105767:16:17:71:533:459:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:DRGs are dened in the same way for the LTCH and Inpatient PPS, the relative weights associated
34:1303:105862:17:16:71:536:442:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with DRGs have di¤erent values in LTCH-PPS. Second, the LTCH-PPS unadjusted federal rate is
34:1304:105953:16:16:71:534:426:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:larger than the corresponding Inpatient PPS value. The result is that LTCH-PPS payments are
34:1305:106044:16:16:71:535:410:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:substantially greater than Inpatient PPS payments for the same DRG, presumably to reect the
34:1306:106136:16:32:71:296:394:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:greater costs at an LTCH relative to an ACH.27

34:1316:106818:18:17:80:537:186:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:27Also, like Inpatient PPS, LTCH PPS o¤ers a High Cost Outlier (HCO) payment for  particularly costly stays.
34:1317:106926:17:13:71:532:169:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:Specically, an LTCH can receive a HCO payment if the cost of the case exceeds the HCO Threshold. The HCO
34:1318:107031:13:13:71:535:156:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:payment is made in addition to the regular payment amount. Importantly, for our purposes, HCO payments can be
34:1319:107140:13:13:71:535:143:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:made regardless of whether the LTCH stay is considered an SSOoutlier or eligible for the full DRG payment. We
34:1320:107249:13:14:71:536:130:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:therefore exclude HCO payments from our analysis and model.About 9% of LTCH stays in our baseline sample have
34:1321:107358:14:0:71:399:116:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:HCO payments, and the median HCO payment in our baseline sample is $12,428.
35:1322:107435:0:17:99:535:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:DRG. This option is roughly equivalent to a linear interpolation of the full DRG payment
35:1323:107523:17:25:99:292:691:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:between Day 0 and the SSO Threshold.28
35:1324:107561:25:16:85:536:666:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:3. 100% of the cost of the case, which is computed as total charges multiplied by the facility-

35:1326:107685:25:17:85:537:625:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:4. A blend of the Inpatient PPS amount (used at ACH) and 120% of the DRG per diem amount.
35:1327:107774:17:32:99:390:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Note that this option converges to option 2 as LOS increases.

35:1329:107867:23:23:71:191:553:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:PPS payment schedule
35:1330:107887:23:17:71:534:530:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We use a commercial software o¤ered by the company 3M (the product is called Core Grouping
35:1331:107978:17:16:71:535:513:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:Software (CGS)) to compute counterfactual Medicare payments for eachpost-PPS period stay.29
35:1332:108070:16:16:72:535:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Specically, for each stay in the PPS period, we compute the PPS payment for the actual discharge
35:1333:108167:16:16:72:536:481:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:day and each possible counterfactual discharge day. The inputs into this calculation are the ad-
35:1334:108263:16:17:72:535:465:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:mission date, estimated hospital charges, principal and secondary diagnoses, procedures, discharge
35:1335:108361:17:16:72:536:448:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:status, age, and sex of the patient. For counterfactual lengths of stay, we assume that hospital
35:1336:108457:16:16:72:329:432:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:charges scale linearly with the observed length of stay.
35:1337:108513:16:16:88:534:416:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:With this information, the software produces the DRG code, the SSO threshold day, and the
35:1338:108602:16:17:71:534:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:total Medicare payment for each length of stay. To validate the software, we compare the predicted
35:1339:108700:17:16:71:534:383:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:DRG against the DRG we observe in the data, and the predicted payment against the observed
35:1340:108790:16:16:71:531:367:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:payment for the observed length of stay. The predicted DRG matches the observed value in 99.9%
35:1341:108884:16:16:71:536:351:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:stays and the predicted Medicare payment is within one dollar of the observed Medicare payment
35:1342:108978:16:17:71:144:335:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in 90% of stays.
35:1343:108994:17:16:88:534:318:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Appendix Figure A1 illustrates the resultant, estimated payment schedules for both the pre-PPS
35:1344:109088:16:16:71:535:302:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and PPS periods. Note that this gure di¤ers slightly from Figure 1 in the paper, which depicts
35:1345:109183:16:16:71:535:286:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a stylized model of the post-period payment schedules in which thepre-threshold payments are
35:1346:109275:16:17:71:537:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:constant per diem. In practice, the pre-threshold payments appear tobe slightly bowed downwards;
35:1347:109371:17:16:71:535:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:we abstract from this in Figure 1 which we use in our model estimates, where we used the average
35:1348:109467:16:16:71:535:237:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:payment per day for stays discharged before the threshold to construct the slope of the payment
35:1349:109562:16:16:71:218:221:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:schedule prior to the threshold.
35:1350:109594:16:17:88:536:205:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:What features of the payment rule created the jump in payments at theSSO threshold? Recall
35:1351:109684:17:16:71:535:188:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that right of the SSO Threshold, short-stay outlier rules do not applyand the payment is just the
35:1352:109781:16:16:71:536:172:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:full DRG payment, which means the cumulative payment schedule is always a at line to the right
35:1353:109876:16:18:71:535:156:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the threshold. To the left of the SSO Threshold, each stay is paid the minimum of four alternative
35:1354:109977:18:17:80:532:138:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:28To see this, note that 120% of the DRG per diem amount times thelength of stay is approximately equal to 120%
35:1355:110088:17:14:71:536:121:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:x (Full DRG payment) / ((6/5)SSO Threshold)) x LOS, which is equal to (Full DRG payment) / (SSO Threshold)
35:1356:110194:14:10:71:97:107:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:x LOS.

36:1359:110391:0:17:71:535:708:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:payments; the shape of the payment schedules therefore depends onwhich of the four alternatives
36:1360:110486:17:16:71:537:691:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is binding. If options 1, 2, or 4 were binding, we would not see a jump at the threshold. Therefore,
36:1361:110586:16:16:71:534:675:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:we conclude that cost of the case must be binding in most cases because we observe a jump on
36:1362:110678:16:16:71:534:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:average. Note that the cost of case being binding is necessary rather than the su¢cient condition
36:1363:110775:16:17:71:535:643:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for creating a jump in the payment schedule; the costs could theoretically be such that the payment
36:1364:110874:17:16:71:536:626:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:schedule only has a kink at the SSO threshold rather than a jump. In practice, however, the cost
36:1365:110970:16:32:71:502:610:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the case is on average lower than the other options, and we see a jump at the threshold.
36:1366:111061:32:23:71:214:578:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:Pre-PPS payment schedule
36:1367:111085:23:16:71:534:555:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In the pre-PPS period, LTCHs were paid their (estimated) costs, up to facility-specic per-day
36:1368:111179:16:16:71:535:539:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:limit (MedPAC 2014). For most facilities, this limit was binding. Forthese facilities, we calculate
36:1369:111278:16:17:71:537:523:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the LTCH payment schedule as the per-day limit multiplied by the length of the stay. For a small
36:1370:111374:17:16:71:536:506:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:number of facilities, the payment limit does not appear to bind. For these facilities, we assume that
36:1371:111475:16:16:71:535:490:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:reported costs are linear in the patients length of stay, and we calculate the payment schedule as
36:1372:111574:16:16:71:535:474:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the (imputed) per-day cost multiplied by the length of stay. When we analyze discharge patterns
36:1373:111669:16:17:71:536:458:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the pre-PPS period, we assign each stay the SSO threshold it would have had in the rst year
36:1374:111764:17:38:71:506:441:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:PPS period, based on the DRG assignments made using the CGS software described above.

36:1392:113182:16:0:71:536:88:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:level, which allows for correlation in the health process not only within an individual over time but

37:1417:115460:17:16:71:534:317:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:SSO threshold is not particularly large relative to the typical day-to-day variation in the mortality
