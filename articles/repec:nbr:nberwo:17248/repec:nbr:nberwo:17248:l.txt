3:41:1724:0:29:91:204:686:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:1    Introduction
3:42:1741:29:20:91:519:657:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Unemployment among the young in South Africa is stunningly high and frustratingly persistent.
3:43:1834:20:20:91:519:637:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Using thenarrowILO definition of unemployment which requires one to have actively sought work
3:44:1927:20:20:91:519:617:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in the past four weeks, unemployment among 20-24 year olds exceeds 50 percent.  These rates have
3:45:2023:20:20:91:519:597:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:persisted for over a decade.1One policy response being actively considered is an employer wage
3:46:2117:20:20:91:519:577:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:subsidy for young workers.  In this paper, we prospectively analyze such a policy for the Cape Town
3:47:2216:20:20:91:141:557:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:metro area.
3:48:2227:20:20:106:519:537:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Any analysis of a wage subsidy must be embedded in a model that generates equilibrium unem-
3:49:2318:20:20:91:519:517:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:ployment, given the magnitude and persistence of South African youth unemployment. Accordingly,
3:50:2413:20:20:91:519:497:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:we estimate a structural job search model in which reservation wages play a prominent role.  In our
3:51:2512:20:20:91:519:477:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:model, an individual’s reservation wage is an optimal response to labor market frictions that gen-
3:52:2610:20:20:91:519:457:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:erate equilibrium unemployment.  We then use our model to analyze the impact of a wage subsidy.
3:53:2705:20:19:91:519:437:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Intuitively,  the reservation wage is that which leaves an individual indifferent between accepting
3:54:2804:19:20:91:519:418:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:a job today and continuing to search.  In this dynamic model, a wage subsidy increases both the
3:55:2899:20:20:91:519:398:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:value of search and the value of employment resulting in a higher reservation wage.  The impact of
3:56:2997:20:20:91:275:378:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:a wage subsidy in this context is nuanced.
3:57:3039:20:20:106:519:358:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The  paper’s  contributions  are  two-fold.   On  the  policy  front,  the  paper  analyzes  the  efficacy
3:58:3145:20:20:91:519:338:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of  a  wage  subsidy  to  Cape  Town  youth.   We  find  that  while  a  wage  subsidy  does  lead  youth  to
3:59:3254:20:20:91:519:318:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:increase their reservation wages, they do so by a modest amount so the subsidy increases accepted
3:60:3351:20:20:91:519:298:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:wages  and  reduces  the  probability  of  lengthy  unemployment  spells.   Specifically,  we  find  that  a
3:61:3459:20:20:91:519:278:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:R1000/month wage subsidy paid to employers leads to an increase of R660 in mean accepted wages
3:62:3553:20:20:91:519:258:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and a decrease of 15 percentage points in the share of youth experiencing long-term unemployment.
3:63:3650:20:20:91:519:238:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:On  the  methodological  front,  the  paper  is  the  first  to  apply  data  on  reservation  wages  from  a
3:64:3759:20:20:91:519:218:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:developing country to estimate a structural search model.  Our model incorporates measurement
3:65:3852:20:20:91:444:198:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:error in reported wages and observed heterogeneity in the structural parameters.
3:66:3932:20:14:106:519:178:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The paper is also part of an extensive literature on unemployment in South Africa.  For our

3:68:4134:13:0:91:315:151:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:causes behind the post-apartheid increase in unemployment.
4:69:4193:0:19:91:519:686:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:purposes, the most relevant is the recent literature on search and reservation wages in Cape Town.
4:70:4291:19:20:91:519:667:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Using the Cape Area Panel Study (CAPS), which we also use in this paper, Lam, Leibbrandt and

4:72:4474:20:20:91:519:627:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:school.   Nattrass  and  Walker  (2005)  analyze  data  from  the  Khayelitsha/Mitchell’s  Plain  (KMP)
4:73:4577:20:20:91:519:607:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:survey  conducted  in  2000-2001,  which  sampled  working-age  adults  from  a  Cape  Town  working-
4:74:4678:20:20:91:519:587:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:class district.  Using the same KMP data, Schoer and Leibbrandt (2006) find that several different
4:75:4776:20:20:91:519:567:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:search strategies prevail in the data.  An employer-based wage subsidy for youth in South Africa
4:76:4872:20:20:91:519:547:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:is discussed in Pauw and Edwards (2006), Levinsohn (2008), Go, Kearney, Korman, Robinson and
4:77:4964:20:20:91:345:527:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Thierfelder (2010), and Burns, Edwards and Pauw (2010).
4:78:5019:20:20:106:519:507:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The remainder of the paper is structured as follows:  the next section presents the model and

4:80:5222:20:20:91:519:467:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:results of the search model.  Section 5 presents results of the policy simulation of an employer wage

4:84:5421:26:20:91:519:343:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:To use the terminology of Eckstein and Berg (2007), our model is a standard “classical job search”
4:85:5519:20:20:91:519:323:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:model.  It is a partial equilibrium model in that it models only the worker’s optimal search policy in
4:86:5621:20:20:91:519:303:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:a dynamic setting, leaving the firm’s behavior as exogenous; and it is a “wage posting” model in that
4:87:5722:20:20:91:519:283:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:firms post wages which potential workers must either accept or reject (in contrast to “bargaining”
4:88:5820:20:20:91:519:263:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:models, in which workers and firms bargain over the wage after a match has been made).  Flinn
4:89:5913:20:20:91:519:243:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and Heckman (1982) provide an extensive discussion of parameter identification in such models.
4:90:6007:20:20:91:519:223:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Christensen and Kiefer (1991) present a model of this type that is quite similar to ours, develop

4:93:6298:20:20:91:519:164:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:small number of papers (such as Lancaster and Chesher 1983, Lynch 1983, Berg 1990) to use survey
4:94:6394:20:0:91:399:144:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:data on the reservation wage in a structurally estimated search model.
5:95:6465:0:19:106:519:686:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:We consider the infinite-horizon, continuous-time dynamic programming problem of an unem-
5:96:6554:19:20:91:519:667:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:ployed  worker  searching  for  a  job,  who  faces  a  known  wage  offer  distribution  with  cumulative

5:99:6853:20:20:91:519:607:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:pays constant wagew,  but the worker faces an exogenous probability of job separationp.  Once
5:100:6946:20:20:91:519:587:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:rejected, wage offers may not be recalled.  The corresponding continuous-time Bellman equations

6:126:8540:19:20:106:525:667:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f10:A:The model implies a joint distribution of accepted wages and unemployment durations,f(w,d|w≥
6:127:8632:20:20:91:519:647:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f3:B:w∗), which will form the basis of the likelihood function and whose parameters we seek to recover.
6:128:8730:20:20:91:519:627:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Since the model assumes that offer arrivals are independent of wage draws, this joint distribution
6:129:8828:20:20:91:519:607:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:may  be  factored  as  the  product  of  the  marginal  distributions  of  accepted  wages  and  unemploy-
6:130:8934:20:20:91:519:587:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:ment durations, leaving us withf(w,d|w≥w∗) =fW(w|w≥w∗)×fD(d|w≥w∗).  We consider
6:131:9013:20:20:91:207:567:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:estimation of each in turn.
6:132:9040:20:20:106:519:547:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:According to the model, no agent accepts a wage below the reservation wage, allowing us to use
6:133:9134:20:20:91:520:527:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the truncation of the wage distribution from below atw∗to recover the parameters of the wage offer
6:134:9232:20:20:91:520:507:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:distribution, sincefW(w|w≥w∗) =fW(w)1−FW(w).  In practice, however, wages are measured with error,
6:135:9330:20:20:91:519:487:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:so that some reported wages may fall below the reservation wage.  Suppose classical measurement

6:137:9507:20:20:91:520:447:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:ofw.  Although the support of the measurement error distribution is unbounded, we may bound

6:139:9693:20:56:91:173:407:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Therefore we have:

6:153:9867:15:13:102:520:207:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:4This approach to bounding the measurement error distribution follows Christensen and Kiefer (1994), although
6:154:9976:13:9:91:106:194:8:g_d0_f7:6:g_d0_f6:F:they do not assume that the measurement error is normally distributed, as we do.5
6:155:10057:9:10:107:520:185:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:Allowing instead for measurement error in reservation wages rather than accepted wages would not change the
6:156:10164:10:9:91:519:175:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:results of our model.  To see this, suppose (without loss of generality) that reservation wages are measured with error,
6:157:10284:9:10:91:520:166:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:such thatw∗o=w∗−-, wherew∗ois the observed reservation wage and-is distributedN(0,σ2-), as above.  Then we
6:158:10390:10:0:91:135:156:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:would have:
7:159:10402:0:19:106:519:686:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Now consider the density of unemployment durations,fD(d).  Under the assumption of Poisson
7:160:10492:19:20:91:520:667:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:offer arrivals, the hazard rate of unemployment exit,h, is a (constant) product of the offer arrival
7:161:10592:20:20:91:520:647:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:rate and the probability that a wage draw exceeds the reservation wage, i.e.,h=q(1−FW(w∗)).
7:162:10683:20:20:91:519:627:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Accordingly,  unemployment  durations  are  distributed  exponentially  with  parameterh,  so  that

7:164:10881:20:20:91:520:587:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:so that observed durationd= min{d∗,dc}, whered∗is the true duration anddcis the duration

7:166:11062:20:40:91:350:547:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the density of observed unemployment durations,gD(d), is:

7:168:11147:30:20:106:519:477:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:We observe a sample of accepted wages and (possibly right-censored) unemployment durations.
7:169:11238:20:20:91:519:457:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:By definition, we do not observe accepted wages for those with right-censored durations, and an

8:192:12814:26:20:91:519:603:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Identification of the model parameters depends crucially on the reservation wage.  In addition to
8:193:12911:20:20:91:519:583:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:determining the policy function of the theoretical search model, the reservation wage plays a key
8:194:13008:20:20:91:519:563:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:role in empirical parameter identification in the likelihood function.  By providing the truncation
8:195:13107:20:20:91:519:543:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:point of the accepted wage distribution, the reservation wage, in conjunction with the dispersion of
8:196:13207:20:20:91:519:523:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:accepted wages around it, serves to identify the underlying wage offer distribution.  Additionally, its
8:197:13310:20:20:91:519:503:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:role in truncating the accepted wage distribution helps to identify the measurement error variance by
8:198:13411:20:19:91:519:483:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:placing an upper bound on the measurement error for all observed wages. Moreover, by entering into
8:199:13509:19:20:91:519:464:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the expression for the hazard rate of unemployment exit, the reservation wage helps to identify the
8:200:13608:20:20:91:519:444:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:offer arrival rate by reconciling variation in observed unemployment durations with the probability
8:201:13707:20:20:91:175:424:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of offer acceptance.
8:202:13727:20:20:106:519:404:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:We  estimate  the  preferred  version  of  the  model  using  survey  data  on  the  reservation  wage.
8:203:13830:20:20:91:519:384:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Because  the  CAPS  data  has  the  rare  advantage  of  self-reported  reservation  wages,  we  use  the
8:204:13935:20:20:91:519:364:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:median reservation wage (within cells defined by included covariates) as model inputs.  The median
8:205:14033:20:20:91:519:344:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:reservation wage, rather than individual reservation wage reports, is used because under the model
8:206:14131:20:20:91:519:324:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:all  agents  face  identical  structural  parameters  and  therefore  must  have  an  identical  reservation

8:208:14245:20:20:106:519:284:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:However, for comparative purposes, we also estimate the model under alternative measures of
8:209:14336:20:20:91:519:264:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the reservation wage,  and report how results change under each.  Under the model assumptions,
8:210:14430:20:20:91:519:244:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the minimum accepted wage in the data is a consistent estimator of the reservation wage (Flinn

8:212:14627:20:20:91:519:204:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:estimator will be susceptible to outliers in the left tail of the observed wage distribution, so instead
8:213:14731:20:14:91:519:184:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:we use the 5th percentile of observed wages, which is also a consistent estimator of the reservation
8:214:14831:14:13:102:520:170:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:8We could also choose the mean reservation wage or other measure of central tendency,  but chose the median
8:215:14938:13:9:91:519:157:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:because it is less sensitive to outliers.  Parameter estimates obtained using mean reservation wages are qualitatively
8:216:15056:9:0:91:254:148:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:similar to those obtained under the median.

9:218:15155:19:20:106:519:667:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The theoretical model also provides a means to identify the reservation wage in a manner that
9:219:15248:20:20:91:519:647:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:is fully structural.  Actually doing so in practice, though, is typically problematic.  This is because
9:220:15351:20:20:91:519:627:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the  reservation  wage  is  a  boundary  value  (since  it  is  the  truncation  point  of  the  accepted  wage

9:222:15563:20:20:91:519:587:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:assumes  that  measurement  error  in  the  reservation  wage  may  lead  some  observed  wages  to  fall
9:223:15668:20:20:91:519:567:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:below the reservation wage, the boundary value problem is eliminated, and the reservation wage
9:224:15762:20:20:91:519:547:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:may indeed be estimated as an additional model parameter in a conventional maximum likelihood

9:243:17304:9:12:99:520:170:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:11We define school exit as being out of school for at least 3 consecutive months.  A related paper, Pugatch (2011)
9:244:17418:12:0:91:274:158:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:uses this data to investigate school re-enrollment.

10:246:17567:19:20:91:519:667:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:appears low with 35% never searching since leaving school.  Nonetheless, few youth are returning to
10:247:17666:20:20:91:519:647:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:school:  only 6% report returning to school before obtaining their first job (or censoring), and none
10:248:17767:20:20:91:519:627:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:returned to school full-time (i.e., all report searching or working concurrently with re-enrollment
10:249:17866:20:20:91:520:607:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in school).  Of those who find work,  most (77%) are employed full-time.12Unlike many African
10:250:17959:20:20:91:519:587:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:economies, South Africa does not have a substantial informal sector.  The mean accepted wage was
10:251:18055:20:20:91:519:567:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:2486 rand and wages are measured in real South African rand per month (base month August 2002,
10:252:18149:20:20:91:519:547:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:at which time the South African rand/US dollar exchange rate was 10.59).  Table 1 appears quite
10:253:18244:20:20:91:519:527:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:consistent, at least on the surface, with a reservation wage story in which school leavers wait for a
10:254:18345:20:20:91:280:507:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:full-time, reasonably well-compensated job.
10:255:18388:20:20:106:519:487:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Table  2  presents  unemployment  durations  and  rates  by  observable  characteristics.   The  data
10:256:18489:20:20:91:519:467:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:reveal expected patterns:  unemployment is more prevalent and prolonged for coloureds and blacks,
10:257:18586:20:20:91:519:447:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:females, the young, and the low-skilled (both in terms of low schooling and low ability).  The levels
10:258:18687:20:20:91:519:427:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:can be quite striking, however, even for the most advantaged groups:  21% of whites and 15% of
10:259:18781:20:19:91:519:407:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:those with at least some post-secondary education are unemployed for at least one year since school
10:260:18880:19:20:91:519:388:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:exit,  for  instance.   Another  surprising  result  is  the  post-school  labor  market  experience  of  those
10:261:18991:20:20:91:519:368:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:who  report  never  searching:  of  this  group,  only  36%  are  censored,  meaning  that  the  remaining
10:262:19097:20:20:91:519:348:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:64% obtain a job, despite reporting to never have searched.  This suggests that “search,” at least as
10:263:19198:20:20:91:519:328:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:understood by the survey respondents, is not necessary to obtain employment, and thus many youth
10:264:19294:20:20:91:519:308:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:who may appear to be non-participants in the labor market may in fact be searching passively, or
10:265:19390:20:20:91:389:288:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f5:B:at least prepared to accept a job should an acceptable offer arrive.13
10:266:19460:20:20:106:519:268:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Because reservation wages play a key role in our model, we further investigate the quality of the
10:267:19557:20:20:91:519:248:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:reservation wage data.  Our reservation wage measure is the minimum monthly wage for which the
10:268:19651:20:20:91:519:228:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:youth reported to be willing to accept full-time work, measured at the latest wave prior to obtaining
10:269:19752:20:15:91:520:208:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:a job after permanent school exit (or censoring).14Table 1 showed that 24% of those with completed
10:270:19850:15:10:99:458:193:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:A:12Our model results are qualitatively similar when excluding part-time workers from the sample.
10:271:19945:10:12:99:520:183:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:13Our definition of “never searched” excludes those who report obtaining employment immediately after leaving
10:272:20054:12:9:91:519:171:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:school.  Although such youth do not report searching between school exit and employment,  we expect that many
10:273:20163:9:10:91:519:162:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:in fact did actively search for work prior to obtaining work, and therefore exclude them from the “never searched”
10:274:20277:10:7:91:205:152:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:group so as not to bias results.

11:279:20701:20:20:91:519:627:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:measurement  error  in  wages.   Table  3  presents  regressions  of  the  reservation  wage  on  a  set  of
11:280:20809:20:20:91:519:607:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:observable  characteristics.   Although  few  coefficients  are  statistically  significant,  they  generally
11:281:20918:20:20:91:519:587:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:enter  with  the  expected  sign:  reservation  wages  are  lower  among  females,  blacks  and  coloureds,
11:282:21025:20:20:91:519:567:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:who  likely  face  more  labor  market  disadvantages  than  similarly-skilled  males  and  whites;  lower
11:283:21131:20:20:91:519:547:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:(convexly) as a function of age, suggesting that older youth are less patient in their search; higher
11:284:21232:20:20:91:519:527:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:for the more skilled, as proxied by schooling and ability; higher for those with employed fathers or
11:285:21332:20:20:91:519:507:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:with co-resident parents, likely due to the greater availability of intra-household transfers; lower for
11:286:21436:20:20:91:519:487:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:those whose parents want them more strongly to work; and lower for those with their own children
11:287:21532:20:20:91:519:467:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in the household, who have greater need to accept paid work.  A notable exception is the negative
11:288:21629:20:20:91:519:447:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:coefficient on pension receipt by a household member, which contradicts the conventional wisdom
11:289:21724:20:20:91:519:427:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that availability of pension-related resources increases reservation wages, although the coefficient is
11:290:21827:20:19:91:519:407:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:significant only at the 10% level.  The regression results suggest that, despite some discrepancies
11:291:21926:19:20:91:519:388:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:between  observed  wages  and  reservation  wages,  the  reservation  wage  data  from  the  survey  are
11:292:22030:20:20:91:473:368:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:generally internally consistent when considering correlations with observable attributes.
11:293:22119:20:20:106:519:348:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:An assumption of our model is a constant arrival rate for job offers which (in combination with
11:294:22214:20:20:91:519:328:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the assumption that all other structural parameters are time-invariant) implies that the reservation
11:295:22314:20:20:91:519:308:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:wage is constant.  Because CAPS asks about reservation wages in each wave of the panel, we can
11:296:22408:20:20:91:519:288:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:test whether an individual’s reservation wage is constant or whether it declines with unemployment
11:297:22506:20:20:91:519:268:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:duration.  We do so by regressing the reservation wage on unemployment duration with individual-
11:298:22602:20:20:91:519:248:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:level fixed effects to account for time-invariant individual heterogeneity, and we find no evidence
11:299:22701:20:20:91:519:228:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of declining reservation wages.  We conclude that the assumption of constant reservation wages is
11:300:22798:20:15:91:140:208:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f5:B:plausible.15
11:301:22810:15:12:99:520:193:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:15This  is  convenient  since  the  leading  methods  for  incorporating  time-varying  reservation  wages  in  structurally
11:302:22934:12:9:91:519:181:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:estimated  search  models  make  assumptions  that  do  not  fit  the  South  African  context:   assuming  a  finite  search
11:303:23059:9:10:91:519:172:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:horizon  (as  in  Wolpin  1987)  seems  unsuited  to  youth  seeking  their  first  job  following  school  exit,  and  allowing
11:304:23187:10:9:91:519:162:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:structural parameters (typically the unemployment benefit, as in Berg 1990) to evolve over time in a known fashion
11:305:23301:9:0:91:259:153:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:is at odds with the South African experience.
12:306:23347:0:19:106:519:686:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, we consider the adequacy of our distributional assumptions used to form the likelihood
12:307:23442:19:20:91:519:667:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:function.  Figure 2 shows kernel density estimates of accepted wages and first unemployment spells,
12:308:23541:20:20:91:519:647:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f5:B:respectively;  recall that both distributions are assumed exponential for purposes of estimation.16
12:309:23640:20:20:91:519:627:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Although the empirical distributions from the full sample may mask considerable heterogeneity and
12:310:23737:20:20:91:519:607:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:thus can not show that our distributional assumptions are correct, observable patterns consistent
12:311:23834:20:20:91:519:587:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:with  the  exponential  distribution  (e.g.,  monotonically  decreasing  with  a  long  right  tail)  at  least
12:312:23945:20:20:91:519:567:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:suggest that our estimates may fit the data well.  The accepted wage distribution, panel [a], does
12:313:24043:20:20:91:519:547:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:exhibit the left tail mode and long right tail that is characteristic of the exponential distribution;
12:314:24145:20:20:91:519:527:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in our model, measurement error may account for the increasing density in the far left tail.  The

12:316:24339:20:20:91:519:487:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:appears to be consistent with our assumption of a constant hazard rate of unemployment exit, in

12:319:24480:29:20:91:519:393:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:In  this  section,  we  discuss  the  parameter  estimates  of  the  structural  model  that  we  next  use  to
12:320:24591:20:20:91:520:373:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:analyze  the  wage  subsidy.   Recall  the  key  parameters  governing  the  model  areq(the  job  offer

12:322:24788:20:20:91:519:333:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:incorporate observed heterogeneity by modeling the job arrival rate and the wage offer as log linear
12:323:24888:20:20:91:519:313:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:functions of a parsimonious set of covariates:  indicator variables for black,  coloured,  high school

12:325:25088:20:20:91:519:273:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:low-ability whites with less than a high school education and no previous work experience.  The
12:326:25183:20:15:91:509:253:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f5:B:measurement error variance is estimated as a single parameter for the entire sample, however.19
12:327:25278:15:12:99:520:238:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:16Under exponential wage offers, the density of accepted wages will also be exponential, with a rightward shift of
12:328:25392:12:7:91:316:226:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:the offer distribution by the amount of the reservation wage.
12:329:25453:7:12:99:520:219:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:17Although the kernel density is increasing in the far left tail, the empirical mode is 1 month (the minimum allowed,
12:330:25570:12:7:91:442:207:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:by assumption), so the empirical density does have its mode at the left tail of the distribution.

12:333:25796:7:12:99:520:181:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:19Although in principle we could have treated the measurement error as heteroskedastic by allowing its variance
12:334:25907:12:9:91:519:169:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:to vary according to observable characteristics, in practice the measurement error coefficients were rarely significant
12:335:26026:9:0:91:412:160:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:in such models, and frequently led to numerical instability in the parameter estimates.
13:336:26115:0:19:106:519:686:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:As noted above,  the reservation wage plays a key role in identification of the model.  We in-
13:337:26209:19:20:91:519:667:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:corporate  the  reservation  wage  into  our  model  first  in  a  base  case  approach  and  then  using  two
13:338:26319:20:38:91:192:647:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:alternative approaches.

13:340:26368:26:20:91:519:583:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:In  the  base  case,  we  estimate  (7)  using  the  median  reservation  wage  within  cells  defined  by  the
13:341:26479:20:20:91:419:563:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:included covariates as our measure ofw∗.  Results are presented in Table 4.
13:342:26554:20:20:106:520:543:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Results  forq,  the  job  offer  arrival  rate,  are  given  in  the  first  column.   The  “baseline  level”
13:343:26663:20:20:91:519:523:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:reported in the first row is the exponentiated value of the constant term, and may be interpreted
13:344:26760:20:20:91:520:503:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:as the monthly probability of receiving a job offer for the omitted group.20The baseline monthly
13:345:26856:20:19:91:519:483:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:probability of a job offer is 27%.  The reported coefficients on lnqrepresent the marginal effect, in
13:346:26957:19:20:91:519:464:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:log points, on the offer arrival rate.  We see that blacks and coloureds face offer arrival rates that are
13:347:27063:20:20:91:519:444:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:.8 and .4 log points (or approximately 80% and 40%) lower, respectively, than those for whites. High
13:348:27163:20:20:91:519:424:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:school graduation and post-secondary schooling generate large returns on offer arrivals (coefficients
13:349:27264:20:20:91:519:404:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of .48 and .69, respectively), while high ability and previous work experience also increase the offer
13:350:27366:20:20:91:519:384:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:arrival rate considerably (coefficients of .27 and .37, respectively).  The estimates imply that a black,
13:351:27471:20:20:91:519:364:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:low-ability high school dropout with no previous work experience has a monthly offer probability
13:352:27567:20:20:91:519:344:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of  just  12%,  but  that  high  ability,  previous  work  experience  and  some  college  education  nearly
13:353:27675:20:20:91:243:324:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:quadruple this probability, to 46%.
13:354:27710:20:20:106:520:304:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Results forλ, the wage offer distribution parameter, whose baseline represents the mean (and
13:355:27802:20:20:91:519:284:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:standard deviation) of the wage offer distribution are given in the second column.  Coefficients are
13:356:27902:20:20:91:519:264:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:marginal effects in log points, as before.  The estimated baseline wage offer, at R710, is quite low
13:357:28002:20:20:91:520:244:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:relative  to  the  mean  accepted  wage  of  R2,486.21Not  surprisingly,  the  model  predicts  that  only
13:358:28108:20:14:91:520:224:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:29% of wage offers are accepted.22As with the offer arrival rate, the estimates imply considerable
13:359:28206:14:13:99:520:210:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:20When the estimate exceeds unity, the parameter may also be interpreted as the predicted number of job offers
13:360:28316:13:9:91:106:197:8:g_d0_f7:6:g_d0_f6:F:per month.21
13:361:28328:9:10:107:520:188:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:Such  a  comparison  must  be  interpreted  with  caution,  however,  as  the  baseline  wage  offer  is  for  the  omitted
13:362:28451:10:9:91:519:178:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:category of white, low ability high school dropouts without previous work experience, while the mean accepted wage
13:363:28565:9:7:91:170:169:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:is for the full sample.
13:364:28588:7:12:99:519:162:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:22We calculate the probability of offer acceptance, Pr(w≥w∗), as the mean over the distribution of the full sample,
13:365:28703:12:0:91:248:150:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:i.e., Pr(w≥w∗) =∫Pr(w≥w∗|x)f(x)dx.

14:367:28838:19:20:91:519:667:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Schooling, ability and previous work experience generate large returns, however, with the coefficient
14:368:28939:20:20:91:519:647:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of .73 on previous work experience particularly notable (although this coefficient may be picking
14:369:29036:20:20:91:519:627:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:up a number of omitted factors that are correlated with experience, such as motivation or access
14:370:29132:20:20:91:519:607:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to  employment  networks).   Comparing  model  estimates  again  for  black,  low-ability  high  school
14:371:29235:20:20:91:519:587:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:dropouts with no previous work experience to their high ability, college-educated and experienced
14:372:29332:20:20:91:519:567:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:counterparts, we find that the former face a mean wage offer of R513, while the latter receives offers
14:373:29434:20:20:91:520:547:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:more than four times as large, at R2,113.  The estimated measurement error standard deviation,σ-,
14:374:29531:20:37:91:512:527:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f5:B:implies that measurement error accounts for 27% of the standard deviation in accepted wages.23
14:375:29625:37:26:91:489:490:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:4.2    Estimates with Alternative Measures of the Reservation Wage
14:376:29691:26:20:91:519:464:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:The base case approach above used within-cell median reported reservation wages as the measure
14:377:29785:20:20:91:520:444:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:ofw∗.  Reported reservation wage data, though, are rare.  In this section, we estimate the model
14:378:29881:20:20:91:519:424:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:using  two  alternative  measures  of  the  reservation  wage  that  do  not  require  reported  reservation
14:379:29989:20:20:91:519:404:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:wages.  First, we use the fifth percentile of accepted wages (by cell), denotedwq5as our measure
14:380:30085:20:20:91:519:384:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of the reservation wage.  We next estimate the model leaving the reservation wage as a parameter
14:381:30181:20:20:91:519:364:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:to  be  estimated  as  described  in  the  last  paragraph  of  section  2.2.   We  denote  this  measure  as
14:382:30290:20:20:91:519:344:10:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f3:B:w∗MLE.24Estimating  the  model  with  these  alternative  measures  of  the  reservation  wage  serves
14:383:30392:20:20:91:519:324:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:two purposes.  It allows us to infer the “value-added” of having data on actual reservation wages.
14:384:30490:20:20:91:519:304:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Usually, reservation wages have to be inferred (or estimated).  By comparing estimates with actual
14:385:30588:20:20:91:519:284:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:reservation wages to those without, we highlight the role that the reservation wage data play.  It
14:386:30686:20:20:91:519:264:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:also allows us to investigate how the impact of the wage subsidy varies depending on which measure
14:387:30784:20:20:91:227:244:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of the reservation wage is used.
14:388:30816:20:20:106:519:224:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Table 5 presents parameter estimates for each alternative. The first column repeats the base case
14:389:30913:20:15:91:520:204:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:estimates for comparison while column 2 reports results withwq5and column 3 reports estimates

14:391:31113:13:9:91:106:176:8:g_d0_f7:6:g_d0_f6:F:earnings for men in the US.24
14:392:31142:9:9:107:520:167:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:In the estimation,w∗MLEis restricted to bew∗=   ̄w−λ,  corresponding to the truncation of the exponential
14:393:31247:9:0:91:216:158:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:accepted wage distribution atw∗.
15:394:31281:0:19:91:520:686:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:withw∗MLE. We find that results are qualitatively similar regardless of the measure of the reservation
15:395:31383:19:20:91:305:667:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:wage used with expected signs on all coefficients.
15:396:31433:20:20:106:519:647:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Turning first to results forq,  the job offer arrival rate,  we see that baseline offer arrivals are
15:397:31533:20:20:91:519:627:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:estimated to be more frequent with the actual reservation wage data,w∗, than is the case when we
15:398:31629:20:20:91:519:607:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:use inferred or estimated reservation wages:  a monthly job offer probability of .27, versus .07 and
15:399:31729:20:20:91:520:587:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:.15 underwq5andw∗MLE,  respectively.  Although the differences between the models shrinks for
15:400:31822:20:20:91:519:567:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:some groups when coefficients are factored in, the generally higher offer arrival rates of column (1)
15:401:31923:20:20:91:519:547:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:are consistent with higher reservation wages underw∗:  youth who face more frequent offers will be
15:402:32021:20:20:91:255:527:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:more selective about which to accept.
15:403:32058:20:20:106:519:507:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Differences between the models’ estimates ofλ, the wage offer distribution parameter, are also
15:404:32152:20:20:91:520:487:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:quite striking.  The baseline mean wage offer of R1,445 in the model withwq5(Table 5, column 2) is
15:405:32250:20:20:91:519:467:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f9:B:more than double that of the model withw∗.  The baseline offer of R899 in the model withw∗MLE
15:406:32343:20:20:91:520:447:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:(column 3), while not nearly as high, still exceeds the baseline underw∗by more than 20%.  Again,
15:407:32440:20:20:91:519:427:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:certain coefficients mitigate these differences somewhat, but the generally lower level of wage offers
15:408:32542:20:19:91:520:407:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in the model withw∗comes through clearly in the estimated probabilities of offer acceptance:  29%
15:409:32639:19:20:91:383:388:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:underw∗, versus 59% and 44% underwq5andw∗MLE, respectively.
15:410:32698:20:20:106:519:368:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Considered in conjunction with the offer arrival rate results, the estimates offer a contrasting
15:411:32794:20:20:91:518:348:10:g_d0_f3:5:g_d0_f21:B:picture of the labor market:  underw∗, wage offers are relatively frequent but low, while underwq5
15:412:32892:20:20:91:519:328:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:offers are infrequent but high.  This arrival/wage offer tradeoff is how the model reconciles different
15:413:32995:20:20:91:519:308:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:reservation wages using the same data on unemployment durations and accepted wages.  Accord-
15:414:33087:20:20:91:520:288:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:ingly, the probability of offer acceptance (Pr(w≥w∗)) implied by the models suggest that if youth
15:415:33184:20:20:91:519:268:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:behave according to their reservation wage reports, they are less than half as likely to accept a wage
15:416:33286:20:20:91:520:248:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:offer than underwq5; we will return to this discrepancy and suggest possible explanations shortly.
15:417:33384:20:20:91:519:228:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Results for the model withw∗MLEfall somewhere in between the other two, with intermediate offer
15:418:33479:20:20:91:519:208:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:arrivals and wage offers for most subgroups, as may be expected when we “let the data speak” to
15:419:33574:20:20:91:162:188:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:find the best fit.
15:420:33592:20:20:106:520:168:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The estimated measurement error standard deviation,σ-, is greatest in the model withw∗and
15:421:33681:20:0:91:520:148:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:smallest in the model withwq5.  This is unsurprising:  recall that the measurement error parameter
16:422:33781:0:19:91:519:686:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:serves to reconcile the density of observed wages below the reservation wage, and hence should be
16:423:33878:19:20:91:489:667:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:largest in the model withw∗, since reservation wages are highest (on average) in that case.
16:424:33969:20:20:106:519:647:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, the coefficients onw∗MLEin column (3) follow the expected pattern:  black and coloured
16:425:34064:20:20:91:519:627:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:youth  have  lower  reservation  wages  relative  to  whites,  while  reservation  wages  are  increasing  in
16:426:34173:20:20:91:519:607:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:schooling and ability.  Interestingly, the negative coefficient on previous work experience suggests
16:427:34273:20:20:91:519:587:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that youth who have already engaged in paid work are willing to work for less than their inexperi-
16:428:34371:20:20:91:361:567:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:enced peers, although this coefficient is imprecisely estimated.
16:429:34435:20:20:106:519:547:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f11:A:The relatively frequent offer arrivals and low job acceptance probability in the model withw∗
16:430:34528:20:20:91:519:527:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:begs the question, “If the South African youth labor market is so bad, why are youth turning down
16:431:34625:20:20:91:519:507:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:so many jobs?”  Our answer is that it is unlikely that youth are actually receiving, and refusing, job
16:432:34727:20:20:91:519:487:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:offers with the frequency implied by our estimates.  Instead, we consider it more likely that low-wage
16:433:34829:20:20:91:519:467:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:jobs are more abundant than the unemployment data may suggest, but such low-wage matches are
16:434:34921:20:20:91:519:447:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:made infrequently.  “Search” is not necessarily an active process for this group, as the 64% of our

16:436:35114:20:19:91:519:407:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:frequency of offer arrivals and refusals we estimate are more likely to represent “implicit refusals”
16:437:35215:19:20:91:519:388:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of low-wage offers that are available in principle, but that are not literally made by employers to
16:438:35314:20:20:91:519:368:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:unemployed youth.  The matching costs incurred by both sides may exceed the surplus generated
16:439:35407:20:37:91:211:348:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:by these low-wage matches.

16:441:35449:27:20:91:519:284:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:The structural search model generates predictions for the distributions of unemployment durations
16:442:35546:20:20:91:519:264:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and accepted wages.  Before considering a formal Lagrange Multiplier test,  we first offer a more
16:443:35643:20:20:91:468:244:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:qualitative comparison of the predicted distributions and their empirical counterparts.
16:444:35730:20:20:106:519:224:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:We first consider the distribution of unemployment durations till obtaining the first job. Because
16:445:35828:20:20:91:519:204:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:some  durations  are  right-censored,  it  will  be  convenient  to  work  with  the  survivor  function  for
16:446:35937:20:19:91:519:184:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:unemployment, or the probability that an unemployment spelldexceeds some valued0(i.e.,S(d0) =
16:447:36030:19:20:91:520:165:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Pr(d≥d0)).   Table  6  shows,  in  column  (1),  the  empirical  survivor  function  at  various  monthly
16:448:36135:20:0:91:519:145:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:durations, along with model estimates depending on how the reservation was is treated in columns
17:449:36233:0:19:91:519:686:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:(2)-(4).  For example, 69 percent of actual unemployment spells exceed 3 months while the model,
17:450:36329:19:20:91:519:667:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:for each treatment of the reservation wage, predicts that 75 percent of the spells would exceed 3
17:451:36426:20:20:91:519:647:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:months.  The model almost exactly predicts the fraction of spells exceeding 12 months (42 percent)
17:452:36524:20:20:91:374:627:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and over-predicts the fraction of spells lasting 24 and 36 months.
17:453:36590:20:20:106:519:607:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:We next consider the distribution of accepted wages in Table 7.  The model predicts the mean
17:454:36682:20:20:91:519:587:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of the accepted wage distribution pretty well.  The actual mean is R2486 while, when we use the
17:455:36777:20:20:91:520:567:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:reported reservation wages,w∗, the model predicts a mean accepted wage of R2346.  The model,
17:456:36869:20:20:91:519:547:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:though, underestimates the standard deviation of the distribution of accepted wages, and this is
17:457:36965:20:20:91:519:527:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:seen by comparing actual and predicted accepted wages at different parts of the distribution.  The
17:458:37063:20:20:91:519:507:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:empirical distribution has a longer right tail than that predicted by the model, and this explains
17:459:37161:20:20:91:498:487:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the differences in the mean and standard deviation reported in the top two rows of the table.
17:460:37254:20:20:106:519:467:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:We  conclude  from  our  qualitative  evaluation  of  model  fit  that  the  model  does  fairly  well  for
17:461:37361:20:20:91:519:447:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:most of the mass of the distributions but does less well in the right tails.  That is, the model does
17:462:37462:20:20:91:519:427:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:not fit the really long unemployment durations or really high accepted wages very well.  At some
17:463:37558:20:19:91:519:407:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:level, this is unsurprising.  The model is quite simple and it is asking a lot to fit the far right tail of
17:464:37665:19:20:91:374:388:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the distributions of unemployment duration and accepted wages.
17:465:37727:20:20:106:520:368:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:We test the model more formally by conducting Lagrange Multiplier (LM) tests.25This test
17:466:37815:20:20:91:519:348:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:essentially  asks  whether  moments  of  the  distributions  predicted  by  model  match  their  empirical
17:467:37921:20:20:91:519:328:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:counterparts.  The LM test is similar in spirit to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test–a nonparametric
17:468:38015:20:20:91:519:308:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:test for the equality of two distributions.  Results are given in the bottom panels of tables 6 and
17:469:38114:20:20:91:519:288:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:7.   We  consistently  reject  the  null  hypothesis  that  the  model  is  correctly  specified.   This  too  is
17:470:38227:20:20:91:519:268:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:unsurprising given the simplicity of the model and the high bar set by a test that is, in essence,
17:471:38325:20:15:91:281:248:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:comparing entire distributions of outcomes.

18:475:38489:26:20:91:519:627:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Having  estimated  a  structural  search  model  consistent  with  the  observed  distributions  of  unem-
18:476:38595:20:20:91:519:607:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:ployment and accepted wages, we now use this model to prospectively analyze the impact of a wage
18:477:38691:20:20:91:270:587:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:subsidy to youth in the Cape Town area.
18:478:38730:20:20:106:519:567:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:As government in South Africa contemplates responses to youth unemployment, a wage subsidy
18:479:38820:20:24:91:519:547:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f5:B:is being actively considered.  In his 2010 budget speech, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan stated:26
18:480:38919:24:12:116:495:523:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Many  South  Africans,  speaking  of  their  own  experiences  on  the  streets  of  our  cities,
18:481:39016:12:12:116:495:511:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:at  factory  gates  and  in  rural  communities,  have  urged  us  to  take  steps  to  make  it
18:482:39112:12:11:116:495:499:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:easier for young people to find work.  Labour market data confirm that employers are
18:483:39196:11:12:116:495:488:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:reluctant to hire inexperienced work-seekers, while school-leavers lack basic workplace
18:484:39283:12:12:116:495:476:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:competencies.   Furthermore,  our  bargaining  arrangements  push  up  entry  level  wages,
18:485:39374:12:16:116:287:464:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:pricing out inexperienced work-seekers.
18:486:39413:16:12:116:495:448:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Under the leadership of the Department of Labour, initiatives are in progress to improve
18:487:39501:12:12:116:495:436:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:information services to help young people access jobs and training opportunities.  We
18:488:39586:12:12:116:495:424:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:propose to  support  these reforms  through a  subsidy to  employers  that will  lower the
18:489:39676:12:30:116:347:412:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:cost of hiring young people without work experience.
18:490:39728:30:20:106:519:382:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The impact of a wage subsidy will depend on its level, of course, but also on how individuals
18:491:39821:20:20:91:519:362:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:respond to the subsidy.  Intuitively, the subsidy shifts the wage offer distribution to the right and
18:492:39922:20:20:91:519:342:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the  bigger  the  subsidy,  the  bigger  the  shift.   Knowing  that  expected  wage  offers  will  be  higher,
18:493:40033:20:20:91:519:322:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:individuals increase their reservation wages (see eq.  (3)).  In the new equilibrium, the probability
18:494:40134:20:20:91:519:302:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of accepting a job offer increases as does the mean accepted wage.  Correspondingly, unemployment
18:495:40231:20:20:91:479:282:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:spells are shortened.  Themagnitudeof these responses, though, is an empirical question.
18:496:40319:20:20:106:519:262:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:We model the wage subsidy as a shift right in the wage offer distribution by the full amount
18:497:40411:20:20:91:520:242:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of the subsidy,s.  Hence the entire distribution, including the truncation point, shifts bys.  This
18:498:40510:20:19:91:519:222:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:approach implicitly assumes that the subsidy is fully passed through to job seekers in the form of
18:499:40608:19:20:91:519:203:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:wage offers.  In this sense, this is a best-case scenario for the impact of the subsidy, since to the
18:500:40709:20:20:91:519:183:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:extent that employers have some market power in the youth labor market, pass-through will not
18:501:40802:20:15:91:146:163:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:be complete.
18:502:40814:15:0:99:344:148:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:A:26The entire National Budget Speech is found at Gordhan (2010).
19:503:40879:0:19:106:519:686:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The  first  step  of  simulating  the  impact  of  a  wage  subsidy  is  to  compute  the  new  reservation
19:504:40986:19:20:91:520:667:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:wage.  In our model, a change in the wage offer mean (or any structural parameter) will changew∗,
19:505:41083:20:20:91:519:647:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and hence the simulation results will depend crucially on how the model accounts for the agent’s
19:506:41179:20:20:91:520:627:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:updatedw∗in response to the policy change.  Whenw∗is estimated structurally, the approach is
19:507:41271:20:20:91:520:607:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:straightforward: merely update the structural estimate ofw∗under the new wage offer distribution.
19:508:41368:20:20:91:519:587:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:However, whenw∗is estimated from individuals’ reported reservation wages as in our analysis, we
19:509:41463:20:20:91:520:567:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:must updatew∗by calibrating some elements ofθthat we did not observe (or estimate) in our
19:510:41552:20:20:91:520:547:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:baseline  specification.   We  updatew∗in  a  fashion  that  is  consistent  with  our  search  model,  as
19:511:41658:20:20:91:520:527:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:expressed in (3).  Specifically, we use our maximum likelihood estimates of (λ,q) and calibrate the
19:512:41757:20:20:91:519:507:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f11:B:model  parameters  not  estimated  by  our  model  (b,δ,p)  such  that  they  reproduce  the  value  ofw∗
19:513:41862:20:20:91:519:487:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:used in the baseline (no subsidy) estimation.  We calibratepaccording to observed job separations
19:514:41959:20:20:91:520:467:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in the data; chooseδ=.95 annually; and then choosebto matchw∗to the data (by inverting the
19:515:42049:20:20:91:519:447:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:reservation wage function).  We then updatew∗by varying the subsidy values, holding all other
19:516:42142:20:20:91:166:427:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:parameters fixed.

19:518:42266:19:20:91:520:388:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:reservation  wage  and  how  it  varies  depending  on  the  level  of  the  subsidy.27The  subsidys=  0
19:519:42370:20:20:91:520:368:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:corresponds to the baseline estimates discussed in the preceding sections, andsincreases to R1,000
19:520:42468:20:20:91:519:348:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in  increments  of  100  along  the  horizontal  axis.   (To  put  the  size  of  the  subsidy  in  context,  note
19:521:42582:20:20:91:519:328:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that  the  mean  wage  in  the  sample  is  about  R2486.)   The  top  panel  shows  that  the  reservation
19:522:42689:20:20:91:519:308:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:wage increases monotonically with the subsidy and that the relationship is close to linear.  A R1000
19:523:42789:20:20:91:519:288:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:subsidy increases the reservation wage by about R660 and, while the level of the reservation wage
19:524:42886:20:20:91:519:268:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:depends on how it is estimated, the response of the reservation wage to a subsidy is about the same
19:525:42985:20:20:91:278:248:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:for each treatment of the reservation wage.
19:526:43028:20:20:106:519:228:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The higher reservation wages that result from the introduction of the wage subsidy result in
19:527:43120:20:20:91:519:208:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:higher accepted wages.  The bottom panel of Figure 3 displays these results.  Again, the relationship
19:528:43221:20:20:91:519:188:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:between  the  mean  accepted  wage  and  the  subsidy  is  about  linear  and  that  relationship  is  fairly
19:529:43330:20:14:91:519:168:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:invariant to the way that reservation wages are treated in the estimation.  A R1000 subsidy increases
19:530:43431:14:12:99:519:154:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:27In Figures 3-5, the lines labeledwrhat=wrcorrespond to the model estimated withw∗;wrhat=wp5towq5; and

20:532:43555:0:19:91:519:686:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the mean accepted wage by about R660 (and recall this is assuming that the subsidy is fully passed
20:533:43653:19:20:91:520:667:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:through to the wage offer distribution).28Hence, only about 66% of the wage subsidy shows up
20:534:43745:20:20:91:519:647:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:as an increase in the mean accepted wage.  Of course, the wage subsidy also impacts the length of
20:535:43842:20:20:91:380:627:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:unemployment spells so the 66% figure is not the end of the story.
20:536:43908:20:20:106:519:607:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:The rise in the reservation wage is one measure of the subsidy’s impact.  The subsidy also raises
20:537:44005:20:20:91:519:587:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the likelihood that an individual will accept a job offer.  This is illustrated in Figure 4.  When we

20:539:44195:20:20:91:519:547:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:probability of accepting a job offer increases from .30 to about .44 with a subsidy of R1000.  This
20:540:44294:20:20:91:519:527:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:translates  into  shorter  unemployment  spells–presumably  the  foremost  goal  of  the  wage  subsidy–
20:541:44398:20:20:91:519:507:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:and  this  is  shown  in  Figure  5.   Focusing  again  on  the  results  that  use  the  reported  reservation
20:542:44509:20:20:91:520:487:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:wages,w∗, the fraction of youth who report an unemployment spell of 12 months falls from about
20:543:44603:20:20:91:519:467:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:42%  with  no  subsidy  to  about  27%  with  a  R1000  subsidy.   A  15  point  reduction  in  long  term
20:544:44709:20:20:91:519:447:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:unemployment strikes us as quite sizeable.  The reduction is close to 10 percentage points when we
20:545:44807:20:20:91:519:427:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:estimate the model without using reservation wages inferred from the 5th percentile of accepted
20:546:44902:20:19:91:519:407:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:wages.  These percentage point declines carry over to comparable declines in the probability of 24
20:547:45000:19:20:91:519:388:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:month unemployment spells, as shown in the bottom panel of Figure 5.  The model using reported
20:548:45094:20:20:91:519:368:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:reservation wages has 25% of individuals reporting a 24 month period of unemployment, and this
20:549:45188:20:20:91:295:348:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:falls to about 10% with a R1000 wage subsidy.
20:550:45233:20:20:106:519:328:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Overall, our prospective analysis of an employer wage subsidy indicates that the subsidy will be
20:551:45329:20:20:91:519:308:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:effective in reducing unemployment spells, even in a model that generates substantial unemployment
20:552:45427:20:20:91:519:288:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in the absence of such a subsidy.  The avenues through which the subsidy works are more subtle than
20:553:45526:20:20:91:519:268:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:would be the case in an “Econ 101” model of supply and demand.  We find that the subsidy raises
20:554:45621:20:20:91:519:248:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:reservation wages and so, even with an assumed 100% pass-through of the subsidy as it impacts
20:555:45714:20:20:91:519:228:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the wage offer distribution, accepted wages only rise by about 66% of the subsidy.  This amount of
20:556:45812:20:20:91:519:208:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:pass-through, though, is enough to generate substantial declines in long term unemployment spells.
20:557:45910:20:20:91:519:188:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:The fact that all of the impacts of the subsidy illustrated in Figures 3 - 5 are almost linear suggests
20:558:46013:20:14:91:519:168:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that  the  level  of  the  wage  subsidy  is  mostly  a  political  decision.   That  is,  there  are  no  obvious
20:559:46127:14:12:99:520:154:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:28The reservation wage and mean accepted wage increase by the same amount because the entire accepted wage
20:560:46233:12:0:91:372:142:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:distribution has shifted to the right by the increase in the reservation wage.
21:561:46313:0:37:91:474:686:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:inflection points that would support an argument for a subsidy set at a particular level.
21:562:46402:37:26:91:167:649:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:5.2    Caveats
21:563:46416:26:20:91:519:623:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Figure  5  represents  our  estimate  of  the  impact  of  a  wage  subsidy  on  unemployment  spells,  but
21:564:46523:20:20:91:519:603:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the model that generates these results is necessarily much simpler than the youth labor market in
21:565:46620:20:20:91:519:583:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:metro Cape Town.  There are assumptions in both the underlying search model as well as in how
21:566:46713:20:20:91:316:563:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:we model the wage subsidy that merit highlighting.
21:567:46763:20:20:106:519:543:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Notably, the partial equilibrium nature of our search model treats labor demand as exogenously
21:568:46857:20:20:91:519:523:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:determined  and  fully  described  by  the  Poisson  job  offer  arrival  rate  and  wage  offer  distribution.
21:569:46968:20:20:91:519:503:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Our model may fail to capture additional idiosyncratic frictions in the South African labor market
21:570:47066:20:19:91:519:483:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:that firms and workers face,  such as firing restrictions and the lack of a vibrant informal sector.
21:571:47166:19:20:91:519:464:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Moreover, young people may not behave entirely according to the reservation wage policy described
21:572:47263:20:20:91:519:444:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:by our simple search model, as the large proportion who accept wages below their stated reservation
21:573:47362:20:20:91:519:424:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:wage suggests.  The wage subsidy we model may not pass through completely to the wage offer
21:574:47453:20:20:91:519:404:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:distribution, as we assume, if firms can exercise market power and capture rents from the subsidy.
21:575:47551:20:20:91:519:384:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Finally, we ignore any possible general equilibrium effects from the wage subsidy:  even if targeted
21:576:47651:20:20:91:519:364:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:only to the young, youth make up a disproportionate share of South Africa’s unemployed, as noted
21:577:47747:20:20:91:177:344:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in the Introduction.
21:578:47767:20:20:106:519:324:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:Nonetheless, we believe that our analysis adds to the existing literature and political conversation
21:579:47867:20:20:91:519:304:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:about  wage  subsidies  by  considering  how  the  subsidy  would  affect  the  reservation  wages  of  job
21:580:47974:20:20:91:519:284:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:seekers  in  an  environment  of  equilibrium  unemployment.   Our  analysis  of  the  effects  of  a  wage
21:581:48081:20:20:91:519:264:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:subsidy complements those of Pauw and Edwards (2006), Burns et al. (2010) and Go et al. (2010),
21:582:48176:20:20:91:519:244:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:who consider wage subsidies in the context of computable general equilibrium (CGE) models of the

22:584:48351:0:29:91:192:686:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:6    Conclusion
22:585:48366:29:20:91:519:657:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Persistently high youth unemployment is one of the most pressing problems in South Africa.  The
22:586:48461:20:20:91:519:637:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:South African government has proposed an employer wage subsidy to address the issue. We prospec-
22:587:48557:20:20:91:519:617:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:tively analyze such a policy.  Recognizing that a credible estimate of the policy’s impact requires
22:588:48656:20:20:91:519:597:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:a model of the labor market that itself generates high unemployment in equilibrium, we estimate
22:589:48751:20:20:91:519:577:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:a structural search model that incorporates both observed heterogeneity and measurement error
22:590:48844:20:20:91:519:557:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:in wages.  We find that the estimated model replicates the observed unemployment spells and the
22:591:48939:20:20:91:519:537:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:distribution of accepted wages reasonably well, although not perfectly.  Using the model to examine
22:592:49038:20:20:91:519:517:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:the impact of a wage subsidy, we find beneficial effects for youth even after accounting for how the
22:593:49138:20:20:91:519:497:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:subsidy increases reservation wages.  We find that a R1000/month wage subsidy paid to employers
22:594:49233:20:20:91:519:477:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:leads to more frequent job offer acceptances, increased accepted wages and substantial declines in
22:595:49331:20:20:91:226:457:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:even long term unemployment.
22:596:49359:20:19:106:519:437:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A:This paper is hardly the final word on this question but rather represents an initial examination
22:597:49456:19:0:91:223:418:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:of an important policy option.

28:776:59140:21:12:91:519:665:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:This appendix discusses the formal test of model fit we use to compare our predicted unemployment

28:779:59438:13:13:91:520:628:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:moments and scores from the estimated model.29Let  ˆmi=m(xi,ˆθ) be the sample moment(s) for

28:781:59624:12:16:91:519:603:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f8:B:we would have  ˆmi=wi−(ˆλ+w∗).  Let ˆsi=s(xi,ˆθ) =∂lnLi∂ˆθbe the score vector for observationi
28:782:59718:16:12:91:520:587:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:evaluated atˆθ.  Under the null hypothesis that the model is correctly specified,E(m) =E(s) = 0.
28:783:59814:12:33:91:374:575:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:Cameron and Trivedi propose the following auxiliary regressions:

28:786:59911:24:12:91:520:503:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:where 1 is a vector of ones and the second auxiliary regression is valid in the case where∂m∂θ= 0,
28:787:60009:12:24:91:351:491:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:as it is in our case.  The corresponding test statistic is then:
28:788:60073:24:17:283:328:467:10:g_d0_f8:7:g_d0_f9:?:M=NR2u
28:789:60079:17:12:91:520:450:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:B:whereR2uis  the  uncenteredR2from  the  auxiliary  regression.   Under  the  null,Mis  distributed

28:792:60356:12:9:91:519:410:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:(2005, pp.  266) note that the test is invalid if the data are not generated from a multinomial distribution.  Since our
28:793:60476:9:7:91:444:401:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:outcomes of interest (duration and wages) are continuous, we use the LM test described above.
28:794:60569:7:12:99:520:394:6:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f7:F:30Another  test  of  model  fit  that  could  be  applied  in  our  context  is  the  Kolmogorov-Smirnov  test,  which  is  a
28:795:60694:12:10:91:519:382:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:nonparametric  test  for  the  equality  of  two  distributions.   However,  when  the  parameters  of  one  distribution  are
28:796:60820:10:9:91:519:372:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:estimated  using  data  from  the  other,  the  test  statistic  may  not  be  asymptotically  distributed  according  to  the
28:797:60946:9:0:91:264:363:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:Kolmogorov distribution, invalidating the test.
