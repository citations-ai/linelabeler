2:25:1237:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:The impact of segregation on Black political efficacy is theoretically ambiguous. On one hand, increased
2:26:1341:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:contact among Blacks in more segregated areas may mean that Blacks are better able to coordinate
2:27:1437:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:political behavior. On the other hand, lesser contact with non-Blacks may mean that Blacks have less
2:28:1537:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:political influence over voters of other races. As for non-Blacks, inter-group conflict theory suggests
2:29:1640:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:that greater contact yields greater conflict between the groups while inter-group contact theory suggests
2:30:1745:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:exactly the reverse. We investigate this question empirically.  We find that exogenous increases in
2:31:1844:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:segregation lead to decreases in Black civic efficacy, as measured by an ability to elect Representatives
2:32:1949:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:who vote liberally and more specifically in favor of legislation that is favored by Blacks. This tendency
2:33:2054:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:for Representatives from more segregated MSAs to vote more conservatively arises in spite of the
2:34:2150:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:fact that Blacks in more segregated areas hold more liberal political views than do Blacks in less segregated
2:35:2259:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:locales. We find evidence that this decrease in efficacy is driven by more conservative attitudes amongst
2:36:2364:14:42:72:252:434:12:Times:12:Times:non-Blacks in more segregated areas.

3:60:2961:14:27:90:159:584:144:Times:144:Times:I Introduction 
3:61:2976:27:28:90:493:557:144:Times:144:Times: A large literature suggests that segregation is associated with more negative 
3:62:3054:28:28:90:510:529:144:Times:144:Times:outcomes for Blacks.1  Blacks in more segregated areas are found to have higher infant 
3:63:3141:28:27:90:518:501:144:Times:144:Times:mortality, lower educational attainment, and fare worse on a host of other outcomes than 
3:64:3230:27:28:90:520:474:144:Times:144:Times:Blacks in less segregated areas.  Ananat (2007) shows that even when the endogeneity of 
3:65:3318:28:27:90:491:446:144:Times:144:Times:segregation is carefully controlled for, Blacks in more segregated cities have lower 
3:66:3403:27:28:90:499:419:144:Times:144:Times:education, employment and earnings than their counterparts in less segregated cities. 
3:67:3489:28:28:126:508:391:144:Times:144:Times:In this paper we explore the impact of segregation on a previously unexamined 
3:68:3567:28:27:90:511:363:144:Times:144:Times:outcome: politics. Although the relationship between political outcomes and area racial 
3:69:3655:27:28:90:492:336:144:Times:144:Times:and ethnic heterogeneity has been extensively studied,2 this is the first paper, to our 
3:70:3743:28:27:89:505:308:144:Times:144:Times:knowledge, to examine the relationship between segregation and Black civic efficacy. 
3:71:3828:27:28:89:506:281:144:Times:144:Times:We define Black political efficacy3 as the ability to elect Representatives who vote (in 
3:72:3917:28:27:90:509:253:144:Times:144:Times:Congress) in a manner that the Black electorate favors. Under this definition, it is clear 
3:73:4008:27:28:90:492:226:144:Times:144:Times:that the political views and actions of both Black and non-Black citizens will affect 
3:74:4094:28:28:90:489:198:144:Times:144:Times:efficacy. In fact, given that in no MSA are Blacks a majority of the population, the 
3:75:4179:28:27:90:468:170:144:Times:144:Times:behavior of non-Blacks may be more important than the behavior of Blacks in 
3:76:4255:27:23:90:512:143:144:Times:144:Times:determining Black political efficacy. A priori, the relationship between segregation and 
3:77:4344:23:7:90:237:120:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
3:78:4392:7:12:90:279:113:42:Times:100:Times:1 See for example Massey and Denton (1995).  
3:79:4437:12:16:90:517:101:42:Times:100:Times:2 This literature concludes that both political participation and public goods expenditures are decreasing in 
3:80:4547:16:7:90:350:85:100:Times:100:Times:racial heterogeneity. See Costa and Kahn (2003) for a summary. 
3:81:4610:7:0:90:397:78:42:Times:100:Times:3 We use the terms “political efficacy” and “civic efficacy” interchangeably. 
4:82:4689:0:27:90:514:708:144:Times:144:Times:Black civic efficacy is ambiguous. On the one hand, the more segregated Blacks are the 
4:83:4776:27:28:90:514:681:144:Times:144:Times:more contact they have with other Blacks and thus the more likely they are to be able to 
4:84:4865:28:27:90:515:653:144:Times:144:Times:influence Black political behavior. On the other hand, the less segregated Blacks are the 
4:85:4955:27:28:89:485:626:144:Times:144:Times:more contact they have with non-Blacks and the more likely they are to be able to 
4:86:5037:28:28:89:468:598:144:Times:144:Times:influence non-Black political behavior. As for non-Blacks’ propensity to align 
4:87:5116:28:27:89:491:570:144:Times:144:Times:themselves politically with Blacks, inter-group conflict theory suggests that greater 
4:88:5202:27:28:89:490:543:144:Times:144:Times:contact yields greater conflict between the groups while inter-group contact theory 
4:89:5286:28:27:89:525:515:144:Times:144:Times:suggests exactly the reverse. (See for example Taylor 1998 and Bobo 1988 on inter-group 
4:90:5374:27:28:89:459:488:144:Times:144:Times:conflict theory and Johnson et. al 2000, 2001 on inter-group contact theory). 
4:91:5452:28:28:89:503:460:144:Times:144:Times: We bring empirical evidence to bear on this theoretical ambiguity. Clearly the 
4:92:5531:28:27:89:501:432:144:Times:144:Times:challenge to an empirical analysis of the impact of segregation on any outcome is the 
4:93:5617:27:28:89:509:405:144:Times:144:Times:endogeneity of segregation. (For example, perhaps non-Black residents’ preference for 
4:94:5703:28:27:89:509:377:144:Times:144:Times:interactions with Blacks influences both the level of segregation and the level of Black 
4:95:5792:27:28:89:524:350:144:Times:144:Times:efficacy.)  We circumvent this difficulty by using the railroad division index developed in 
4:96:5884:28:27:89:491:322:144:Times:144:Times:Ananat (2007) to instrument for segregation. Before the Great Migration--the large 
4:97:5967:27:28:89:519:295:144:Times:144:Times:movement of Blacks from the South to the North during the years 1915 to 19504--Blacks 
4:98:6053:28:28:90:515:267:144:Times:144:Times:predominantly lived in former slave-holding states. The instrument exploits the fact that 
4:99:6143:28:27:90:521:239:144:Times:144:Times:this Great Migration occurred after the vast majority of the country’s present day railroad 
4:100:6235:27:28:90:523:212:144:Times:144:Times:tracks had been laid. The more subdivisions created in a city by the tracks (conditional on 
4:101:6327:28:27:89:511:184:144:Times:144:Times:the total amount of track in the city), the easier it was in that city to confine (segregate) 
4:102:6421:27:28:89:520:157:144:Times:144:Times:Blacks in neighborhoods whose boundaries were defined by these tracks. (One limitation 
4:103:6508:28:28:89:503:129:144:Times:144:Times:of this identification strategy is that we can only explore the impact of segregation on 
4:104:6597:28:15:89:264:101:144:Times:144:Times:civic efficacy outside of the South.) 
4:105:6635:15:8:89:237:86:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
4:106:6683:8:0:90:397:78:42:Times:100:Times:4 Some historians put the end date of the Great Migration at as late as 1970.  
5:107:6763:0:27:90:505:708:144:Times:144:Times: Employing the railroad instrument, we find that in the non-South, segregation, 
5:108:6842:27:28:90:497:681:144:Times:144:Times:conditional on area racial heterogeneity, has a negative causal impact on Black civic 
5:109:6928:28:27:90:480:653:144:Times:144:Times:efficacy. The more segregated the metro area, the less likely that its residents are 
5:110:7013:27:28:90:510:626:144:Times:144:Times:represented in the United States House by a Black representative or by an individual of 
5:111:7101:28:28:90:489:598:144:Times:144:Times:either race who is from the Democratic Party5 or who votes in accordance with the 
5:112:7183:28:27:90:493:570:144:Times:144:Times:desires of Black residents on civil rights and other issues. Although the relationship 
5:113:7270:27:28:89:514:543:144:Times:144:Times:between segregation and our various measures of efficacy is not always significant, it is 
5:114:7360:28:27:89:496:515:144:Times:144:Times:remarkably consistent. The negative relationship has held from the first redistricting 
5:115:7447:27:28:89:497:488:144:Times:144:Times:period after the Voting Rights Act through the most recently completed redistricting 
5:116:7532:28:28:89:483:460:144:Times:144:Times:period (or from 1973-2002). Given evidence that the tendency for Blacks to align 
5:117:7613:28:27:89:506:432:144:Times:144:Times:themselves towards the left in the political continuum is increasing in segregation, our 
5:118:7702:27:28:89:455:405:144:Times:144:Times:findings demonstrate that Black civic efficacy is decreasing in segregation.  
5:119:7780:28:27:89:515:377:144:Times:144:Times: What is the channel by which segregation impacts Black civic efficacy? We find 
5:120:7859:27:28:89:507:350:144:Times:144:Times:no evidence that variation in district demographic configuration drives our results. We 
5:121:7947:28:27:89:524:322:144:Times:144:Times:also rule out variation in voter turnout by race as a possible explanation. We do, however, 
5:122:8039:27:28:89:514:295:144:Times:144:Times:find evidence that in more segregated areas non-Blacks are more likely to hold negative 
5:123:8127:28:28:89:503:267:144:Times:144:Times:views of Blacks and of policies that aid Blacks. Further, we find some support for the 
5:124:8214:28:27:89:510:239:144:Times:144:Times:argument that segregation increases divergence between Black and non-Black political 
5:125:8299:27:28:89:466:212:144:Times:144:Times:views. Because Blacks are a minority of the population in all metro areas, this 
5:126:8379:28:27:89:471:184:144:Times:144:Times:polarization could explain the finding that Black civic efficacy is decreasing in 
5:127:8461:27:28:89:153:157:144:Times:144:Times:segregation.  
5:128:8475:28:28:125:502:129:144:Times:144:Times:As exemplified by the quotations with which we began, there is a deep-seated 
5:129:8552:28:15:89:506:101:144:Times:144:Times:belief in this country in the ability to effect change by pulling a lever on Election Day. 
5:130:8643:15:8:89:237:86:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
5:131:8691:8:0:90:454:78:42:Times:100:Times:5 Blacks vote Democratic 70 to 90% of the time in two-party elections (McDermott 1998). 
6:132:8780:0:27:90:511:708:144:Times:144:Times:Such a belief implies that Black political efficacy may be a mediator in the relationship 
6:133:8870:27:28:90:485:681:144:Times:144:Times:between segregation and Black economic outcomes. Thus our results suggest that 
6:134:8949:28:27:90:499:653:144:Times:144:Times:decreased political efficacy may explain in part why Blacks’ economic outcomes are 
6:135:9032:27:28:90:228:626:144:Times:144:Times:decreasing in segregation.6   
6:136:9062:28:28:126:508:598:144:Times:144:Times:We present these results in detail, after describing the data and methodology in

6:145:9565:27:28:89:507:350:144:Times:144:Times:(MSA).8 We focus on the MSA for two reasons: First, The MSA is not a political unit. 
6:146:9650:28:27:90:516:322:144:Times:144:Times:Political boundaries, most notably congressional districts, are defined by the individuals 
6:147:9741:27:28:90:515:295:144:Times:144:Times:who hold political power.9 The relationship between segregation and political units may 
6:148:9829:28:28:90:457:267:144:Times:144:Times:be endogenous. Thus we measure segregation at the MSA level, treating the 
6:149:9903:28:27:90:525:239:144:Times:144:Times:configuration of the congressional districts to which MSA residents belong as an outcome 
6:150:9992:27:23:90:509:212:144:Times:144:Times:variable. Second, a focus on MSAs avoids a second source of endogeneity: intra-urban 
6:151:10077:23:7:90:237:189:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
6:152:10125:7:16:90:507:182:42:Times:100:Times:6 We recognize, however, that the direction of causation may also run from economic outcomes to civic 
6:153:10227:16:7:89:129:166:100:Times:100:Times:efficacy.  
6:154:10238:7:16:90:511:159:42:Times:100:Times:7 We also include the 1972 election which chose the members of the 93rd Congress which commenced in 
6:155:10338:16:7:90:115:143:100:Times:100:Times:1973. 
6:156:10344:7:16:90:519:136:42:Times:100:Times:8 A Metropolitan Statistical Area is comprised of a county or set of counties that contain a central city of at 
6:157:10456:16:12:90:520:120:100:Times:100:Times:least 50,000 inhabitants “plus adjacent counties with a high degree of integration with the central county as 
6:158:10566:12:7:90:399:108:100:Times:100:Times:measured by commuting” (Office of Management and Budget 2000, 82238). 
6:159:10636:7:16:90:518:101:42:Times:100:Times:9 States are political units whose boundaries are not decided by those who currently hold power. However, 
6:160:10742:16:11:89:512:85:100:Times:100:Times:many states are too large (and contain too many areas in which Blacks do not reside) to speak about state 
6:161:10848:11:0:89:494:74:100:Times:100:Times:segregation meaningfully. Nearly 90% of Black Americans live within an MSA. (McKinnon 2003).  
7:162:10943:0:27:90:472:708:144:Times:144:Times:residential sorting (Cutler and Glaeser 1997). For example, the most politically 
7:163:11024:27:28:90:497:681:144:Times:144:Times:efficacious Blacks may choose to live in the least segregated parts of the metro area. 
7:164:11111:28:27:126:522:653:144:Times:144:Times:More specifically, we examine outcomes for 31210 MSAs identified by Cutler and 
7:165:11190:27:28:90:488:626:144:Times:144:Times:Glaeser (1997) as having more than 1000 Black residents in the 1990 Census. One 
7:166:11270:28:28:90:502:598:144:Times:144:Times:difficulty in comparing MSAs from decade to decade is that MSA definitions change 
7:167:11352:28:27:89:473:570:144:Times:144:Times:with each census. We overcome this limitation by holding our MSA definitions 
7:168:11429:27:28:89:383:543:144:Times:144:Times:constant11 as we trace political outcomes back to the 1970’s.

7:170:11517:27:39:90:479:488:144:Times:144:Times: Our primary measure of segregation is the dissimilarity index, defined as 
7:171:11591:39:11:90:254:449:144:Times:324:g_d0_f4:(1)   Index of dissimilarity ∑

7:185:11667:25:28:89:508:422:144:Times:144:Times:where NiK1=is the array of census tracts in the area. According to this measure, the 
7:186:11752:28:28:90:505:394:144:Times:144:Times:level of segregation in our sample has fallen across the three decades. The first row of 
7:187:11841:28:27:90:510:366:144:Times:144:Times:Table I shows mean dissimilarity for 1970, 1980 and 1990. The value of .69 in the first 
7:188:11929:27:28:90:505:339:144:Times:144:Times:cell of the table indicates that in 1970 69% of the Black population would have had to 
7:189:12016:28:27:90:505:311:144:Times:144:Times:relocate to different census tracts for there to be an even proportion of Black residents 
7:190:12106:27:28:90:485:284:144:Times:144:Times:throughout the average MSA. By 1990 that figure had dropped to 56%. While the 
7:191:12184:28:27:89:484:256:144:Times:144:Times:average level of segregation has fallen over time, the ordering of cities from most 
7:192:12268:27:28:89:491:229:144:Times:144:Times:segregated to least segregated has remained fairly stable, indicated by a correlation 
7:193:12354:28:28:89:504:201:144:Times:144:Times:between 1970 and 1990 dissimilarity of .75. Our 1990 dissimilarity values come from 
7:194:12438:28:53:89:507:173:144:Times:144:Times:Cutler, Glaeser and Vigdor (1999). We calculate the 1970 and 1980 indexes, using the 
7:195:12523:53:7:89:237:120:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
7:196:12571:7:16:90:523:113:42:Times:100:Times:10 Cutler and Glaeser (1997) identify 313 MSAs with black populations greater than 1000. We eliminate the 
7:197:12677:16:7:90:518:97:100:Times:100:Times:District of Columbia MSA because residents of the District do not elect any voting members to Congress.  
7:198:12782:7:16:90:524:90:42:Times:100:Times:11 We maintain the 1990 definitions throughout. MSAs are defined by counties outside of New England and 
7:199:12886:16:0:90:491:74:100:Times:100:Times:by towns within. We simply define the same set of counties/towns as an MSA in the three decades.  
8:200:12985:0:27:90:515:708:144:Times:144:Times:1990 MSA definitions, with Census data for these years.12 Results are not contingent on 
8:201:13073:27:28:90:509:681:144:Times:144:Times:our measure of segregation. An alternative measure of segregation, the isolation index, 
8:202:13161:28:27:90:524:653:144:Times:144:Times:represents the percentage of Black residents in the average tract in which Blacks live. Our 
8:203:13253:27:28:90:471:626:144:Times:144:Times:results are robust to the substitution of the isolation for the dissimilarity index.  
8:204:13339:28:28:90:167:598:144:Times:144:Times:II.C. Outcomes 
8:205:13354:28:27:90:503:570:144:Times:144:Times: Government structures vary from town to town both within and across MSAs. 
8:206:13428:27:28:90:515:543:144:Times:144:Times:Thus we focus on the United States House of Representatives, because representation in 
8:207:13515:28:27:90:491:515:144:Times:144:Times:the House is a metric that is comparable nationwide.13  We measure Black political 
8:208:13598:27:28:90:497:488:144:Times:144:Times:efficacy using both descriptive and substantive congressional outcomes. Descriptive 
8:209:13682:28:28:89:508:460:144:Times:144:Times:representation is the extent to which a group is represented by individuals of that same 
8:210:13771:28:27:89:466:432:144:Times:144:Times:group. However, descriptive representation does not always equal substantive 
8:211:13848:27:28:89:504:405:144:Times:144:Times:representation, or representation by individuals who share the political interests of the 
8:212:13938:28:27:89:291:377:144:Times:144:Times:group.14 Our outcomes are the following: 
8:213:13979:27:28:90:224:350:144:Times:144:Times:Descriptive Representation 
8:214:14006:28:27:126:483:322:144:Times:144:Times:1) Black Candidates:  One measure of the extent to which Blacks are 
8:215:14073:27:28:90:510:295:144:Times:144:Times:participants in politics is the fraction of congressional districts in which there is at least 
8:216:14168:28:28:90:509:267:144:Times:144:Times:one Black candidate running for the House. District candidate race data, available only 
8:217:14256:28:38:90:500:239:144:Times:144:Times:for the 1980s and 1990s, are from Washington (2006). The mean of this measure has 
8:218:14338:38:8:90:237:201:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
8:219:14386:8:16:90:515:193:42:Times:100:Times:12 Because the entire country was not fully census tracked until 1990, this procedure introduces additional 
8:220:14494:16:11:90:503:177:100:Times:100:Times:measurement error as we move backwards in time. Twenty-nine MSAs in 1970 and 69 in 1980 did not 
8:221:14590:11:12:90:487:166:100:Times:100:Times:include sufficient census tracts for us to calculate segregation indexes directly. For these MSAs we 
8:222:14691:12:11:90:515:154:100:Times:100:Times:predicted the segregation index using the 1990 segregation level and the change in percent Black, percent 
8:223:14797:11:7:90:476:143:100:Times:100:Times:in poverty, percent high school graduate and percent employed between 1970 (1980) and 1990.  
8:224:14890:7:16:90:503:136:42:Times:100:Times:13 Additionally the sheer number of local governments—more than 10,000 cities, towns and counties—
8:225:14988:16:7:90:393:120:100:Times:100:Times:within our MSAs makes a focus on local government outcomes infeasible.  
8:226:15060:7:16:90:518:113:42:Times:100:Times:14 For example, imagine a state with 10 districts. Blacks make up 10% of the state population. If all Blacks 
8:227:15169:16:12:90:514:97:100:Times:100:Times:are located in one district then that district will likely elect a Black representative. Yet, on average Blacks 
8:228:15281:12:11:90:502:85:100:Times:100:Times:will not likely have their substantive interests met by this legislative delegation as Blacks only directly 
8:229:15389:11:0:90:373:74:100:Times:100:Times:influence (through the vote) one tenth of their state’s representatives.   
9:230:15465:0:27:90:509:708:144:Times:144:Times:increased between the two decades. (See Table I for the decade by decade means of all 
9:231:15551:27:28:90:191:681:144:Times:144:Times:outcome variables.)  
9:232:15572:28:27:126:493:653:144:Times:144:Times:2) Black Representatives: A stricter measure of participation in politics 
9:233:15645:27:28:90:517:626:144:Times:144:Times:comes from looking to the election winners. Our second efficacy outcome is the fraction 
9:234:15733:28:28:90:263:598:144:Times:144:Times:of Representatives who are Black.   
9:235:15769:28:27:90:224:570:144:Times:144:Times:Substantive Representation 
9:236:15796:27:28:126:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:3) Democratic Representatives: In two-party elections, Black Americans cast 
9:237:15871:28:27:89:492:515:144:Times:144:Times:their votes in favor of the Democratic candidate 70 to 90% of the time (McDermott 
9:238:15953:27:28:89:524:488:144:Times:144:Times:1998). Hence, we take the fraction of Representatives who are Democrats as a measure of 
9:239:16041:28:28:89:496:460:144:Times:144:Times:Black political efficacy. This measure is falling over our sample period. Democrats’ 
9:240:16126:28:27:89:508:432:144:Times:144:Times:majority (in terms of number of members) over Republicans in the House shrank from 
9:241:16209:27:28:89:368:405:144:Times:144:Times:the 1970s to the 1980s and was overturned in the 1990s.   
9:242:16267:28:27:125:460:377:144:Times:144:Times:4) Leadership Conference on Civil Rights Voting Record Score: 
9:243:16328:27:28:89:516:350:144:Times:144:Times:Representative party is a coarse measure of political views. In addition to party, we look 
9:244:16419:28:27:89:512:322:144:Times:144:Times:at Representative voting on civil rights issues as rated by the Leadership Conference on 
9:245:16508:27:28:89:461:295:144:Times:144:Times:Civil Rights (LCCR).15 LCCR is a liberal leaning interest group that chooses 
9:246:16585:28:28:90:483:267:144:Times:144:Times:approximately ten to twenty congressional votes per session that the organization 
9:247:16667:28:27:90:506:239:144:Times:144:Times:considers as crucial to promoting civil rights in this country. A representative’s LCCR 
9:248:16755:27:28:90:524:212:144:Times:144:Times:score in a particular session is the fraction of these votes in which the representative votes 
9:249:16850:28:27:90:512:184:144:Times:144:Times:in accordance with the LCCR’s position.16 This measure is increasingly correlated with 
9:250:16937:27:37:90:279:157:144:Times:144:Times:Democratic representative over time.17 
9:251:16975:37:7:90:237:120:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
9:252:17023:7:16:90:438:113:42:Times:100:Times:15 The scores for the 91st through 109th Congresses are available on the LCCR website, 
9:253:17110:16:7:89:178:97:100:Times:100:Times:www.civilrights.org.  
9:254:17132:7:16:90:503:90:42:Times:100:Times:16 We do not adjust these scores for comparability across years as prescribed by Groseclose, Levitt and 
9:255:17236:16:0:90:516:74:100:Times:100:Times:Snyder (1999). Such an adjustment would be inappropriate in this analysis because it relies on restrictions 
10:256:17345:0:27:126:514:708:144:Times:144:Times:5) Congressional Black Caucus Voting Record Score: Civil rights is not the 
10:257:17419:27:28:90:497:681:144:Times:144:Times:only category of legislation of interest to Blacks.18 We follow Cameron, Epstein and 
10:258:17504:28:27:90:515:653:144:Times:144:Times:O’Halloran (1996) to create a second voting score based on the fraction of the ballots in 
10:259:17594:27:28:90:510:626:144:Times:144:Times:which the legislator votes in agreement with the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC).19 
10:260:17678:28:28:89:503:598:144:Times:144:Times:Founded in 1969 by the then thirteen Black members of Congress, the CBC has as its 
10:261:17761:28:27:89:505:570:144:Times:144:Times:goals “to positively influence the course of events pertinent to African Americans and 
10:262:17848:27:28:89:505:543:144:Times:144:Times:others of similar experience and situation, and to achieve greater equity for persons of 
10:263:17937:28:27:89:503:515:144:Times:144:Times:African descent in the design and content of domestic and international programs and 
10:264:18022:27:28:89:488:488:144:Times:144:Times:services.”20 Every Black member of Congress, since the CBC’s founding, with the 
10:265:18102:28:28:90:486:460:144:Times:144:Times:exception of JC Watts (R-OK), has been a member.21 The caucus currently has 43 
10:266:18181:28:27:90:524:432:144:Times:144:Times:members. The mean of Representatives’ average agreement with the Congressional Black 
10:267:18266:27:28:90:508:405:144:Times:144:Times:Caucus has remained about .6 across decades.22 This measure is highly correlated with 
10:268:18352:28:96:90:220:377:144:Times:144:Times:LCCR score across time.23 
10:269:18377:96:12:90:524:281:144:Times:144:Times:                                                                                                                                                 
10:270:18521:12:11:90:513:269:100:Times:100:Times:in the changes in a representative’s mean preferences from year to year. As we have no prior evidence on 
10:271:18626:11:12:90:501:258:100:Times:100:Times:the relationship between segregation and representative preference, we are more comfortable allowing 
10:272:18727:12:11:90:500:246:100:Times:100:Times:preferences to vary freely. Lack of comparability imposes no limitations in interpreting our regression 
10:273:18831:11:12:90:485:235:100:Times:100:Times:coefficients as all average LCCR scores within a regression are composed of averages of the same 
10:274:18928:12:11:89:507:223:100:Times:100:Times:congressional sessions. Nonetheless, across decades, LCCR scores are highly correlated (.84 or greater)

10:276:19134:7:12:90:390:205:42:Times:100:Times:17 The correlation is .5 in the 1970s, .67 in the 1980s and .87 in the 1990s.  
10:277:19213:12:16:90:514:193:42:Times:100:Times:18 In addition voting record scores compiled by interest groups have been criticized for including only the 
10:278:19321:16:7:90:314:177:100:Times:100:Times:most polarizing votes. See for example Snyder (1992).

10:285:19814:7:16:90:507:101:42:Times:100:Times:22 We limit our attention to only those votes in which 60% or more of the CBC voted in agreement. Our 
10:286:19916:16:7:90:282:85:100:Times:100:Times:results are robust to a change from 60 to 100%. 
10:287:19964:7:0:90:393:78:42:Times:100:Times:23 The correlation is .85 in the 1970s, .82 in the 1980s and .91 in the 1990s. 
11:288:20044:0:27:126:517:708:144:Times:144:Times:In order to merge MSAs with their congressional outcomes, we match an MSA’s 
11:289:20120:27:28:90:488:681:144:Times:144:Times:counties to its respective congressional district(s) for each congressional session.24 
11:290:20206:28:27:90:493:653:144:Times:144:Times:Because an MSA may contain more than one district25 we average outcomes across 
11:291:20285:27:28:90:507:626:144:Times:144:Times:districts within an MSA to create MSA/Congress level outcomes.26  (We use the mean 
11:292:20368:28:28:90:505:598:144:Times:144:Times:rather than the median following Cameron, Epstein and O’Halloran (1996) who argue 
11:293:20450:28:27:90:524:570:144:Times:144:Times:that the scores represent probabilities of voting in favor of a piece of legislation.) Then, to 
11:294:20546:27:28:90:506:543:144:Times:144:Times:attain our best estimate of efficacy within a redistricting period, we average across the 
11:295:20636:28:27:90:360:515:144:Times:144:Times:five Congresses to create MSA/decade level outcomes.  
11:296:20690:27:28:126:515:488:144:Times:144:Times:The focus on the House of Representatives drives our definition of decades. The 
11:297:20770:28:28:90:483:460:144:Times:144:Times:number of representatives that each state may send to the House is defined by the 
11:298:20852:28:27:90:502:432:144:Times:144:Times:decennial census. The first election affected by each census is the election in the year 
11:299:20941:27:28:90:488:405:144:Times:144:Times:ending with 2 following that census. For example, the number of districts per state 
11:300:21025:28:27:90:512:377:144:Times:144:Times:calculated using the 1970 census was first relevant for the 1972 House elections. Those 
11:301:21113:27:28:90:513:350:144:Times:144:Times:elected in 1972 served from January 1973 to January 1975. Thus we define our decades 
11:302:21198:28:27:90:513:322:144:Times:144:Times:to include all elections and congresses based on the respective census.27 (Recall that the 
11:303:21289:27:37:89:380:295:144:Times:144:Times:measures of segregation are also created using the census.)

11:305:21399:7:16:90:503:251:42:Times:100:Times:24 In the case of New England we do the match by county and by town. The county match may give an 
11:306:21497:16:12:90:505:235:100:Times:100:Times:overestimate of the districts in the MSA because counties are not contained by MSA boundaries within 
11:307:21598:12:11:90:521:223:100:Times:100:Times:New England. On the other hand towns may give an underestimate of the districts in the MSA because it is 
11:308:21703:11:12:90:505:212:100:Times:100:Times:not possible to look up the correspondence between unincorporated areas within an MSA and a district. 
11:309:21805:12:11:90:505:200:100:Times:100:Times:County/district correspondence comes from 103rd Congressional District Geographic Entity File, 1990 
11:310:21905:11:12:89:520:189:100:Times:100:Times:(ICPSR 6425) and Census of Population and Housing, 1980, Congressional District Equivalency File, 99th 
11:311:22007:12:11:89:508:177:100:Times:100:Times:Congress. County/district correspondence for 1970, town/district correspondence for all years, and intra 
11:312:22112:11:7:89:480:166:100:Times:100:Times:decennial redistricting correspondence come from Congressional District Atlas (multiple years).  
11:313:22209:7:12:90:253:159:42:Times:100:Times:25 Or portions of more than one district.  
11:314:22252:12:16:90:479:147:42:Times:100:Times:26 We would like to weight this average by the fraction of MSA residents who live in the district. 
11:315:22351:16:11:90:511:131:100:Times:100:Times:Unfortunately, these data are only available for the districts created with the 1990 redistricting. For 1990 
11:316:22460:11:12:90:500:120:100:Times:100:Times:we run specifications using outcomes created by weighted averages as well as those created by simple 
11:317:22561:12:7:90:270:108:100:Times:100:Times:averages. Results are robust to this change.   
11:318:22608:7:16:90:523:101:42:Times:100:Times:27 Although the majority of congressional redistricting is done between the census year and the election that 
11:319:22718:16:11:90:509:85:100:Times:100:Times:follows two years later, states are free to redistrict at any time. Therefore we match MSAs to districts by 
11:320:22826:11:0:90:257:74:100:Times:100:Times:congressional session and not by decade. 
12:321:22869:0:27:90:180:708:144:Times:144:Times:II.D Methodology 
12:322:22886:27:29:90:427:681:144:Times:144:Times: For each decade, we are interested in the following equation:   
12:323:22950:29:28:89:354:652:144:Times:144:Times:(2) outcomei = αι + β1(segregation)i + β2 (perblk)i + ui 
12:324:23006:28:28:89:512:624:144:Times:144:Times:where outcome is one of the political efficacy measures defined in the previous section, 
12:325:23095:28:27:89:513:596:144:Times:144:Times:segregation is the dissimilarity score and perblk is the percent of the MSA’s population 
12:326:23184:27:28:89:512:569:144:Times:144:Times:that is Black. Blacks may be more efficacious where they are a larger percentage of the 
12:327:23272:28:28:89:472:541:144:Times:144:Times:population. We condition on percent Black to isolate the effects of segregation, 
12:328:23353:28:27:89:504:513:144:Times:144:Times:conditional on area ethnic heterogeneity. Previous literature has shown an association 
12:329:23440:27:28:89:500:486:144:Times:144:Times:between demographic characteristics (such as education, poverty status, employment 
12:330:23523:28:27:90:515:458:144:Times:144:Times:status and age) and political participation and political choice. (See for example Leighly 
12:331:23614:27:28:90:518:431:144:Times:144:Times:and Nagler, 1992 and Wolfinger and Rosenstone,1980).  However, we do not control for 
12:332:23699:28:28:90:519:403:144:Times:144:Times:these demographics in our most basic specification because the demographic make up of 
12:333:23785:28:27:90:508:375:144:Times:144:Times:the MSA is in fact endogenous to segregation. For example, Ananat (2007) shows that 
12:334:23869:27:28:90:507:348:144:Times:144:Times:segregation affects the average level of education, income and even movement into an 
12:335:23954:28:27:90:477:320:144:Times:144:Times:MSA. By omitting these endogenous demographics we capture the full effect of 
12:336:24031:27:28:90:470:293:144:Times:144:Times:segregation on each outcome of interest (including any intermediary effects on 
12:337:24110:28:28:90:245:265:144:Times:144:Times:demographic characteristics.)28  
12:338:24143:28:29:90:485:237:144:Times:144:Times: The limitation of equation 2 is that the coefficient β1 cannot be interpreted 
12:339:24221:29:27:90:523:208:144:Times:144:Times:causally due to the potential endogeneity of segregation. For example, perhaps non-Black 
12:340:24310:27:28:90:521:181:144:Times:144:Times:residents’ preference for interactions with Blacks influences both the level of segregation 
12:341:24402:28:28:90:491:153:144:Times:144:Times:and the level of Black efficacy--such an influence might lead our OLS results to be 
12:342:24486:28:28:90:520:125:144:Times:144:Times:biased in a negative direction. Or perhaps the most politically active Blacks prefer to live 
12:343:24579:28:7:90:237:97:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
12:344:24627:7:16:90:478:90:42:Times:100:Times:28 Our 2SLS results are robust to the inclusion of controls for demographic characteristics, as we 
12:345:24726:16:0:90:228:74:100:Times:100:Times:demonstrate in the results section. 
13:346:24764:0:27:90:514:708:144:Times:144:Times:primarily among Blacks--such a preference might lead our OLS results to be biased in a 
13:347:24851:27:28:90:517:681:144:Times:144:Times:positive direction.  The great shortcoming of the OLS results is that we cannot even sign 
13:348:24941:28:27:90:143:653:144:Times:144:Times:their bias.  
13:349:24954:27:28:126:507:626:144:Times:144:Times:We overcome this limitation by following a 2SLS approach; we instrument for 
13:350:25030:28:28:90:487:598:144:Times:144:Times:segregation using Ananat’s (2007) railroad division index (RDI). Before the Great 
13:351:25112:28:27:90:480:570:144:Times:144:Times:Migration, Blacks predominantly lived in former slave holding states.29 The RDI 
13:352:25192:27:28:90:519:543:144:Times:144:Times:instrument exploits the fact that the Great Migration, the large movement of Blacks from 
13:353:25281:28:27:90:516:515:144:Times:144:Times:the South to the North during the years 1915 to 1950, occurred after the vast majority of 
13:354:25371:27:28:90:510:488:144:Times:144:Times:the country’s present day railroad tracks had been laid. The more subdivisions within a 
13:355:25459:28:28:90:506:460:144:Times:144:Times:city created by the tracks, the easier it was in that city to confine (segregate) Blacks in 
13:356:25551:28:39:90:507:432:144:Times:144:Times:neighborhoods whose boundaries were defined by these tracks. The RDI is defined as

13:370:25758:28:27:89:514:326:144:Times:144:Times:An RDI of zero would mean that there are no tracks running through the MSA. An RDI

13:372:25929:28:27:89:201:271:144:Times:144:Times:an area of near zero.31  
13:373:25954:27:29:89:252:244:144:Times:144:Times: Our first stage equation is 
13:374:25982:29:37:89:420:215:144:Times:144:Times:(4) segregationi = αι + δ1(RDI)i + γ1(tracklength)i + γ2(perblk)i + ui.

13:376:26103:8:16:90:492:170:42:Times:100:Times:29 Ananat (2007) estimates that in 1910 90% of Blacks still lived in former slave states of Delaware, 
13:377:26205:16:11:90:503:154:100:Times:100:Times:Maryland, the District of Columbia, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, 
13:378:26307:11:7:90:477:143:100:Times:100:Times:Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Texas and Arkansas. 
13:379:26400:7:16:90:492:136:42:Times:100:Times:30 Ananat (2007) defines the center city as the four kilometer radius circle around the centroid of the 
13:380:26504:16:12:90:508:120:100:Times:100:Times:population center in the early 20th century. Such an approach means that historical variations in city size 
13:381:26612:12:7:89:226:108:100:Times:100:Times:will not distort the RDI measure.  
13:382:26647:7:16:90:504:101:42:Times:100:Times:31 Atack and Passell (1994) estimate that 75% of total track in the United States had been laid by 1900. 
13:383:26752:16:11:90:505:85:100:Times:100:Times:Nonetheless, to better capture the pre-Great Migration track configuration Ananat (2007) calculates the 
13:384:26856:11:0:90:362:74:100:Times:100:Times:RDI using historical maps with a median year of creation of 1909.   
14:385:26926:0:27:90:510:708:144:Times:144:Times:There is a mechanical relationship between tracklength and RDI.  We therefore control 
14:386:27012:27:28:90:515:681:144:Times:144:Times:for tracklength out of a concern that the amount of track laid in a city may relate to how 
14:387:27103:28:27:90:523:653:144:Times:144:Times:prosperous the city was and therefore how desirable a location it was for, for instance, the 
14:388:27196:27:28:90:519:626:144:Times:144:Times:most politically efficacious Blacks (Ananat 2007). (Our first stage estimates for the three 
14:389:27288:28:28:90:362:598:144:Times:64:Times:decades are found in the first three columns of Table II.) 
14:390:27346:28:28:90:222:570:144:Times:144:Times: Our second stage is 
14:391:27366:28:29:90:445:542:144:Times:144:Times:(5) outcomei = αι+ β1(segregation)i + β2 (perblk)i + β3 (tracklength) + ui.. 
14:392:27443:29:27:90:511:513:144:Times:144:Times: The assumption of our identification strategy is that RDI at the beginning of the 
14:393:27525:27:28:90:490:486:144:Times:144:Times:twentieth century does not predict Black civic efficacy at the century’s end, except 
14:394:27610:28:27:90:512:458:144:Times:144:Times:through its effect on segregation. There are two obvious ways in which that assumption 
14:395:27697:27:28:89:492:431:144:Times:144:Times:could be violated. First, RDI could be correlated with early twentieth century MSA 
14:396:27780:28:28:89:486:403:144:Times:144:Times:characteristics which impact later twentieth century political efficacy. Second, the 
14:397:27865:28:27:89:461:375:144:Times:144:Times:instrument may have a direct impact on Black civic efficacy or its correlates. 
14:398:27944:27:28:125:500:348:144:Times:144:Times:RDI does not predict early twentieth century MSA politics. Table III presents 
14:399:28022:28:27:89:513:320:144:Times:144:Times:regressions of the percent of MSA voters32 casting ballots for the Democratic candidate 
14:400:28110:27:28:90:515:293:144:Times:144:Times:in the six presidential elections that occurred between 1900 and 1920. The sample is the 
14:401:28199:28:27:90:503:265:144:Times:144:Times:non-New England MSAs in our 2SLS sample. We omit New England because in that 
14:402:28276:27:28:90:493:238:144:Times:144:Times:region MSAs are not defined by counties; the early twentieth century voting data is 
14:403:28360:28:28:90:517:210:144:Times:144:Times:available by county. RDI is not a significant predictor of Democratic voting. Thus Table 
14:404:28449:28:27:90:496:182:144:Times:144:Times:III provides no evidence that our instrument affects present day Black civic efficacy 
14:405:28535:27:69:90:352:155:144:Times:144:Times:through an impact on early twentieth century politics.  
14:406:28591:69:8:90:237:86:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
14:407:28639:8:0:90:428:78:42:Times:100:Times:32 The denominator is the number who cast ballots for one of the two major parties.  
15:408:28726:0:27:90:524:708:144:Times:144:Times:  Ananat (2007) further demonstrates that RDI is not correlated with early twentieth 
15:409:28811:27:28:89:510:681:144:Times:144:Times:century demographic and economic characteristics. Using the 1910 and 1920 censuses, 
15:410:28895:28:27:90:483:653:144:Times:144:Times:she shows that RDI does not predict early century demographic descriptors of the 
15:411:28976:27:28:89:484:626:144:Times:144:Times:population including population size, percent Black, level of European immigrant 
15:412:29057:28:28:89:479:598:144:Times:144:Times:segregation,33 and physical size of the MSA. Nor does RDI predict early century 
15:413:29137:28:27:89:509:570:144:Times:144:Times:economic outcomes such as the literacy rate, the number of street cars per capita, labor 
15:414:29226:27:28:89:479:543:144:Times:144:Times:force participation rate and the share of employment in trade, manufacturing and 
15:415:29307:28:27:89:140:515:144:Times:144:Times:railroads.  
15:416:29319:27:28:125:502:488:144:Times:144:Times:As stated above, an additional concern about our identification strategy is that 
15:417:29400:28:28:89:504:460:144:Times:144:Times:RDI may have a direct impact on Black civic efficacy or its correlates. Ananat (2007) 
15:418:29486:28:27:89:513:432:144:Times:144:Times:presents evidence that the instrument does not impact later twentieth century outcomes, 
15:419:29574:27:28:89:517:405:144:Times:144:Times:except through its effect on segregation. The concern is that railroad configuration could 
15:420:29665:28:27:89:513:377:144:Times:144:Times:impact land values and therefore residential income segregation. She provides evidence 
15:421:29752:27:28:89:464:350:144:Times:144:Times:against this channel by demonstrating that RDI does not predict 1990 income 
15:422:29828:28:27:89:523:322:144:Times:144:Times:segregation.34 Further, given her results of a positive relationship between RDI and White 
15:423:29919:27:28:89:488:295:144:Times:144:Times:economic outcomes (in contrast to a negative relationship between RDI and Black 
15:424:29999:28:28:89:507:267:144:Times:144:Times:economic outcomes), Ananat (2007) argues that RDI operates through race rather than 
15:425:30083:28:27:89:174:239:144:Times:144:Times:through income.  
15:426:30100:27:28:89:481:212:144:Times:144:Times: One limitation of this identification strategy is that we can only create the 
15:427:30178:28:41:89:505:184:144:Times:144:Times:instrument for those MSAs which meet two criteria: 1) They are not located in former 
15:428:30263:41:7:89:237:143:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
15:429:30311:7:16:90:516:136:42:Times:100:Times:33 European ethnic immigrant segregation was then at its historical peak, according to Massey and Denton 
15:430:30416:16:12:90:520:120:100:Times:100:Times:(1993). Its historical peak was quite low relative to the historical peak of black segregation—the maximum 
15:431:30523:12:11:90:505:108:100:Times:100:Times:isolation index was 0.39 for Italians in Worcester, MA, in 1910 (Vigdor 2006); by contrast, the median 
15:432:30625:11:7:90:265:97:100:Times:100:Times:isolation index for blacks in 1970 was .37.  
15:433:30668:7:16:90:504:90:42:Times:100:Times:34 Income segregation is insignificant in the U.S. relative to racial segregation; the highest dissimilarity 
15:434:30777:16:0:90:488:74:100:Times:100:Times:index for income in 1990 is .28, while the lowest 1990 dissimilarity for African-Americans is .33.   
16:435:30880:0:27:90:502:708:144:Times:144:Times:slave states and 2) Ananat (2007) was able to locate an historical map to calculate the 
16:436:30968:27:28:89:504:681:144:Times:144:Times:RDI for the MSA.35 Therefore our 2SLS results will be limited to only 121 of the 312 
16:437:31053:28:27:90:524:653:144:Times:144:Times:MSAs in our full sample.36 In terms of segregation, representative race and representative 
16:438:31144:27:28:90:503:626:144:Times:144:Times:voting patterns, the full sample and the 2SLS sub-sample are quite comparable.37 The 
16:439:31229:28:28:89:480:598:144:Times:144:Times:final three columns of Table I provide the means for the 2SLS sample. However, 
16:440:31308:28:27:89:508:570:144:Times:144:Times:reflecting the fact that slightly more than half of Blacks continue to live in the South,38 
16:441:31399:27:28:90:510:543:144:Times:144:Times:percent Black is smaller in the 2SLS sample than in the full sample. In the next section 
16:442:31488:28:27:90:193:515:144:Times:144:Times:we detail our results. 
16:443:31511:27:28:90:143:488:144:Times:144:Times:III Results 
16:444:31523:28:28:90:206:460:144:Times:144:Times:III.A. Political Efficacy 
16:445:31549:28:27:90:519:432:144:Times:144:Times: Segregation had a negative impact on Black civic efficacy in the 1990s, results in 
16:446:31632:27:28:90:523:405:144:Times:144:Times:Table IV indicate. Each cell in the table presents the coefficient on the dissimilarity index 
16:447:31726:28:27:90:500:377:144:Times:144:Times:from a different regression specification. Each row reflects a different outcome; each 
16:448:31813:27:28:90:519:350:144:Times:144:Times:column reflects a different specification. The first three columns provide the results from 
16:449:31905:28:27:90:513:322:144:Times:144:Times:OLS regressions on the full sample, the non-South sample and the 2SLS sample. While 
16:450:31989:27:28:90:503:295:144:Times:144:Times:these results are not interpretable causally due to the endogeneity of segregation, they 
16:451:32078:28:28:90:514:267:144:Times:144:Times:serve to indicate the extent of generalizeability of our 2SLS results. As we move from a 
16:452:32167:28:27:89:518:239:144:Times:144:Times:sample of MSAs from across the nation to the non-South sample, although all results are 
16:453:32255:27:28:89:517:212:144:Times:144:Times:insignificant, coefficients vary considerably. One coefficient changes sign. Three of five 
16:454:32346:28:41:89:512:184:144:Times:144:Times:change by an order of magnitude. As we noted in the data and methods section, Ananat 
16:455:32431:41:7:89:237:143:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
16:456:32479:7:12:90:436:136:42:Times:100:Times:35 There are 77 non-Southern MSAs for which Ananat (2007) could not locate a map.  
16:457:32562:12:11:90:402:124:42:Times:100:Times:36 See Appendix Table I for a list of the MSAs included in the 2SLS analysis. 
16:458:32640:11:16:90:515:113:42:Times:100:Times:37 With the exception of the fraction Black candidates in 1990. The 1990 redistricting created 13 new safe 
16:459:32747:16:7:90:307:97:100:Times:100:Times:Black districts, all in southern states. (Clayton 2000).  
16:460:32805:7:16:90:518:90:42:Times:100:Times:38 Fifty-four percent of Blacks lived in the South in March 2004. (U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population 
16:461:32911:16:0:90:507:74:100:Times:100:Times:Survey, Annual Social and Economic Supplement 2004, Racial Statistics Branch, Population Division.) 
17:462:33013:0:27:90:506:708:144:Times:144:Times:(2007) was not able to locate historical maps for all non-southern MSAs. As we move 
17:463:33097:27:28:90:517:681:144:Times:144:Times:from column 2 (all non-southern MSAs) to column 3 (non-southern MSAs for which we 
17:464:33179:28:27:90:516:653:144:Times:144:Times:have the RDI instrument), coefficients are more stable. Thus while our results can likely 
17:465:33269:27:28:90:524:626:144:Times:144:Times:be generalized to the non-South, generalizing to MSAs in the South seems less tenable on 
17:466:33358:28:28:90:514:598:144:Times:144:Times:empirical as well as theoretical grounds. Previous research has found that the politics of 
17:467:33449:28:27:90:512:570:144:Times:144:Times:race differs between the South and the non-South (Massey and Denton 1994; Cameron, 
17:468:33532:27:28:90:247:543:144:Times:144:Times:Epstein and O’Halloran 1996).   
17:469:33564:28:27:90:509:515:144:Times:144:Times: Column 4 provides evidence of the causal impact of segregation on Black civic 
17:470:33642:27:28:90:508:488:144:Times:144:Times:efficacy outside of the South. Regardless of how efficacy is measured, the relationship 
17:471:33730:28:28:90:524:460:144:Times:144:Times:between segregation and efficacy is negative, although not always statistically significant. 
17:472:33823:28:27:90:476:432:144:Times:144:Times:The first row of the table indicates that as segregation increases, Blacks seem to 
17:473:33906:27:28:90:518:405:144:Times:144:Times:participate less in the political process. The -.441 in the first row of the table implies that 
17:474:34002:28:27:90:518:377:144:Times:144:Times:as segregation increases by .10, the fraction of Black House candidates decreases by .04. 
17:475:34092:27:28:90:524:350:144:Times:144:Times:Alternatively as segregation increases by a standard deviation the fraction of Black House 
17:476:34183:28:27:90:507:322:144:Times:144:Times:candidates decreases by a significant .47 standard deviations. Moving down the row, a 
17:477:34269:27:28:90:506:295:144:Times:144:Times:one standard deviation increase in segregation in an MSA causes the fraction of Black 
17:478:34355:28:28:90:520:267:144:Times:144:Times:representatives to fall by a significant .63 standard deviations, the fraction of Democratic 
17:479:34448:28:27:90:499:239:144:Times:144:Times:representatives to fall by .59 standard deviations, the average representative’s LCCR 
17:480:34534:27:28:90:498:212:144:Times:144:Times:score to fall by a significant .82 standard deviations and the average representative’s 
17:481:34622:28:27:90:493:184:144:Times:144:Times:propensity to vote in accordance with the Congressional Black Caucus to fall by.72 
17:482:34705:27:28:90:477:157:144:Times:144:Times:standard deviations. For aid in interpreting the score results, note that a standard 
17:483:34790:28:28:90:469:129:144:Times:144:Times:deviation in LCCR (or CBC) score separates a staunch Republican like former 
17:484:34866:28:0:90:513:101:144:Times:144:Times:Representative Robert Barr (R-GA), who was a leader in the fight to impeach President 
18:485:34954:0:27:90:503:708:144:Times:144:Times:Clinton, from a moderate Republican like former Representative Robert Simmons (R-
18:486:35035:27:28:90:507:681:144:Times:144:Times:CT), who lost his seat in the 2006 election. Moderate Democrat former Representative 
18:487:35120:28:27:90:490:653:144:Times:144:Times:Gary Condit (D-CA) is also separated by a standard deviation on these scores from 
18:488:35202:27:28:90:467:626:144:Times:144:Times:Representative Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), the first female speaker of the House of 
18:489:35279:28:28:90:183:598:144:Times:144:Times:Representatives.39  
18:490:35299:28:27:89:498:570:144:Times:144:Times: The remainder of the table provides the results of various checks to our basic 
18:491:35378:27:28:89:520:543:144:Times:144:Times:specification.The number of Blacks living in each MSA varies considerably. Therefore it 
18:492:35466:28:27:89:514:515:144:Times:144:Times:is possible that our column 4 results reflect a relationship that predominantly prevails in 
18:493:35558:27:28:89:503:488:144:Times:144:Times:MSAs in which few Blacks actually live. We investigate whether such heterogeneous 
18:494:35640:28:28:89:477:460:144:Times:144:Times:treatment effects are driving our findings in specifications reported in column 5. 
18:495:35723:28:27:89:518:432:144:Times:144:Times:Specifications reported in this column are the basic specifications weighted by the log of 
18:496:35814:27:28:89:524:405:144:Times:144:Times:the number of Black residents of the MSA. We choose to weight in logs rather than levels 
18:497:35903:28:27:89:496:377:144:Times:144:Times:because we are uncomfortable allowing an MSA’s influence on our estimation to be 
18:498:35984:27:28:89:519:350:144:Times:144:Times:proportional to the size of its Black population due to the presence of three outlier MSAs 
18:499:36075:28:27:89:524:322:144:Times:144:Times:with Black populations an order of magnitude greater than the sample mean.40 Our results 
18:500:36164:27:28:89:511:295:144:Times:144:Times:are robust to the change from the unweighted to the weighted specification as indicated 
18:501:36252:28:28:89:511:267:144:Times:144:Times:by the results of column 5. Thus our basic results do not seem to be driven by MSAs in 
18:502:36339:28:27:89:506:239:144:Times:144:Times:which few Blacks actually reside. (Results are also robust to the exclusion of the three 
18:503:36428:27:28:89:164:212:144:Times:144:Times:outlier MSAs.) 
18:504:36443:28:27:125:507:184:144:Times:144:Times:As indicated in the data and methods section, district outcomes are averaged to 
18:505:36523:27:37:89:517:157:144:Times:144:Times:form MSA level outcomes. For the 1990s only, we have data that allow us to population-
18:506:36609:37:7:89:237:120:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
18:507:36657:7:12:90:519:113:42:Times:100:Times:39 These differences calculated based on the 107th Congress, the most recent term included in our analysis.  
18:508:36766:12:16:90:508:101:42:Times:100:Times:40 In the 2SLS sample the average number of Blacks in an MSA in 1990 is approximately 50,000. Three 
18:509:36866:16:11:90:509:85:100:Times:100:Times:MSAs—Detroit, Philadelphia and Los Angeles—have Black populations of greater than 500,000. Level 
18:510:36963:11:0:90:378:74:100:Times:100:Times:weighted regressions would essentially be driven by these three MSAs. 
19:511:37035:0:27:90:519:708:144:Times:144:Times:weight our averages to form a better measure of the representation that the average MSA 
19:512:37123:27:28:90:457:681:144:Times:144:Times:resident faces.41 The final column of the table presents the coefficients from 
19:513:37202:28:27:89:514:653:144:Times:144:Times:specifications which use the population-weighted measures. In terms of both magnitude 
19:514:37288:27:28:89:507:626:144:Times:144:Times:and significance, coefficients are little changed from column 4 to column 6, indicating 
19:515:37376:28:28:89:498:598:144:Times:144:Times:that our column 4 results are not driven by our weighting procedure. Thus we can be 
19:516:37460:28:27:89:495:570:144:Times:144:Times:more confident in our results as we trace the impact of segregation back through the 
19:517:37545:27:28:89:124:543:144:Times:144:Times:1970s. 
19:518:37552:28:27:89:494:515:144:Times:144:Times: Looking back across decades, we learn that segregation has had a consistent 
19:519:37628:27:28:89:515:488:144:Times:144:Times:negative impact on Black civic efficacy since the first redistricting following the Voting 
19:520:37719:28:28:89:507:460:144:Times:144:Times:Rights Act. See Table V Panel A for these results. Once again, each cell represents the 
19:521:37807:28:27:89:502:432:144:Times:144:Times:coefficient on the dissimilarity index from a different regression. Each row presents a 
19:522:37895:27:28:89:504:405:144:Times:144:Times:different outcome; each column presents the results from the basic specification using 
19:523:37982:28:27:89:489:377:144:Times:144:Times:data from a different decade. Point estimates indicate that a one standard deviation 
19:524:38067:27:28:89:489:350:144:Times:144:Times:increase in segregation decreases the fraction of Black House candidates by ½ to 1 
19:525:38150:28:27:89:509:322:144:Times:144:Times:standard deviation, the fraction of Black House members by ¾ of a standard deviation, 
19:526:38236:27:28:89:505:295:144:Times:144:Times:the fraction of Democrats by ½ to 1 ¼ standard deviations and the average LCCR and 
19:527:38319:28:28:89:514:267:144:Times:144:Times:CBC scores by about one standard deviation. While the point estimates suggest that this 
19:528:38407:28:27:89:508:239:144:Times:144:Times:negative relationship shrinks in magnitude over time, for none of these three outcomes 
19:529:38494:27:28:89:522:212:144:Times:144:Times:can we distinguish between the 1970 and the 1990 coefficient statistically. Although only 
19:530:38584:28:27:89:524:184:144:Times:144:Times:9 of 14 coefficients are statistically significant, the consistency of the sign of the results is 
19:531:38682:27:28:89:515:157:144:Times:144:Times:evidence of the enduring negative impact of segregation on Black political outcomes. In 
19:532:38770:28:28:89:503:129:144:Times:144:Times:Appendix Table II we demonstrate the robustness of the results to additional controls. 
19:533:38857:28:15:89:517:101:144:Times:144:Times:The additional covariates decrease precision, but leave the pattern of results unchanged.

20:537:39069:27:28:90:489:681:144:Times:144:Times:            Individuals’            political            viewpoints are aggregated to form area-wide political 
20:538:39180:28:27:90:513:653:144:Times:144:Times:outcomes in a multi-staged process. First, a citizen must form a viewpoint. Second, that 
20:539:39269:27:28:90:517:626:144:Times:144:Times:citizen must decide whether it is worth his or her while to make the effort to express that 
20:540:39361:28:28:90:501:598:144:Times:144:Times:viewpoint in the voting booth. Thirdly, the citizen’s vote (if cast) must be aggregated 
20:541:39449:28:27:89:481:570:144:Times:144:Times:with others’ votes according to institutional regulations to determine the winning 
20:542:39532:27:28:89:490:543:144:Times:144:Times:policy.42 (In the case of House races, the institutional regulations say that votes are 
20:543:39620:28:27:90:417:515:144:Times:144:Times:summed, and representatives are therefore chosen, by district.)   
20:544:39685:27:28:125:494:488:144:Times:144:Times:At what point(s) in this process are Blacks in more segregated MSAs falling 
20:545:39761:28:28:89:515:460:144:Times:144:Times:behind those Blacks living in less segregated MSAs? Is it that Black/non-Black political 
20:546:39850:28:27:89:491:432:144:Times:144:Times:viewpoints are more divergent in more segregated metropolitan areas? Are Blacks’ 
20:547:39931:27:28:89:517:405:144:Times:144:Times:feelings of political efficacy (and therefore their belief in the value of voting) decreasing 
20:548:40025:28:27:89:523:377:144:Times:144:Times:in segregation? Are non-Blacks’ feelings of efficacy increasing in segregation? Or are the 
20:549:40116:27:28:89:519:350:144:Times:144:Times:political institutions—the districts—designed in a manner that is less conducive to Black 
20:550:40206:28:27:90:348:322:144:Times:144:Times:substantive representation in more segregated areas?  
20:551:40260:27:28:90:486:295:144:Times:144:Times: In the remainder of the paper we trace the process backward from political 
20:552:40335:28:28:90:479:267:144:Times:144:Times:outcomes to the development of political viewpoints to examine at what point(s) 
20:553:40415:28:27:90:324:239:144:Times:144:Times:segregation causes Blacks to be less efficacious. 
20:554:40465:27:28:90:193:212:144:Times:144:Times:III.B.1. Redistricting 
20:555:40488:28:27:90:493:184:144:Times:144:Times: While the process of redistricting varies from state to state, in no state is the 
20:556:40570:27:28:90:514:157:144:Times:144:Times:process determined orthogonally to the racial composition of the neighborhoods within. 
20:557:40657:28:20:90:490:129:144:Times:144:Times:Federal case law stipulates that districts be compact and contiguous (Stokes 1998). 
20:558:40741:20:8:90:237:109:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
20:559:40789:8:16:90:504:101:42:Times:100:Times:42 We ignore a fourth step where the elected politician must choose whether to enact the policy that the 
20:560:40894:16:11:90:505:85:100:Times:100:Times:people desire. We assume, given its repeated game nature, that House members do enact the will of the 
20:561:40996:11:0:90:170:74:100:Times:100:Times:people on average.  
21:562:41018:0:27:90:519:708:144:Times:144:Times:Therefore the extent of segregation in neighborhoods may mechanically impact upon the 
21:563:41104:27:28:90:500:681:144:Times:144:Times:racial composition of districts. Given that it is a federal requirement that redistricting 
21:564:41195:28:27:90:524:653:144:Times:144:Times:schemes provide “equality of opportunity” for minority voters (Stokes 1998) there is little 
21:565:41287:27:28:89:490:626:144:Times:144:Times:doubt that state legislatures pay attention to the racial makeup of the districts when 
21:566:41374:28:28:89:499:598:144:Times:144:Times:deciding whether to approve any proposed districting plan. Thus rather than treat the 
21:567:41460:28:27:89:523:570:144:Times:144:Times:districts as exogenous, we empirically estimate the relationship between Black/non-Black 
21:568:41549:27:28:89:329:543:144:Times:144:Times:racial segregation and district racial composition. 
21:569:41601:28:27:89:513:515:144:Times:144:Times: There is a long literature in political science debating the implications of district 
21:570:41687:27:28:89:519:488:144:Times:144:Times:demographic composition for Black political efficacy. (See Grofman and Davidson 1992 
21:571:41772:28:28:90:504:460:144:Times:144:Times:for an overview.) In the most extensive empirical examination of the question to date, 
21:572:41859:28:27:90:520:432:144:Times:144:Times:Cameron, Epstein and O’Halloran (1996) investigate the relationship between a district’s 
21:573:41948:27:28:90:505:405:144:Times:144:Times:percentage of Black voters and its representative’s party and LCCR score. Using their 
21:574:42034:28:27:89:523:377:144:Times:144:Times:estimates in simulation, the authors conclude that in all parts of the United States with the 
21:575:42128:27:28:89:513:350:144:Times:144:Times:exception of the South43 the optimal strategy for maximizing Black representation in an 
21:576:42216:28:27:90:447:322:144:Times:144:Times:area is to equalize the Black population across districts within that area.44  
21:577:42295:27:28:90:493:295:144:Times:144:Times: In Table V Panel B we examine the extent to which segregation predicts the 
21:578:42370:28:28:90:508:267:144:Times:144:Times:spread of Blacks in districts throughout a metropolitan area.45 It is possible that Blacks 
21:579:42461:28:27:89:480:239:144:Times:144:Times:are less efficacious in more segregated areas because, following the reasoning of 
21:580:42543:27:23:89:502:212:144:Times:144:Times:Cameron, Epstein and O’Halloran (1996), Blacks are confined to more heavily Black 
21:581:42625:23:7:89:237:189:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
21:582:42673:7:16:90:516:182:42:Times:100:Times:43 In the South, the optimal strategy, according to Cameron, Epstein and O’Halloran (1996), is to create as 
21:583:42781:16:7:90:279:166:100:Times:100:Times:many districts of about 47% Black as possible. 
21:584:42828:7:16:90:522:159:42:Times:100:Times:44 Cameron, Epstein and O’Halloran (1996) used states as the area of investigation; however, as one vote in 
21:585:42936:16:12:90:500:143:100:Times:100:Times:Congress is equal to any other vote in Congress, the aggregation of representatives to states in no way 
21:586:43040:12:11:90:504:131:100:Times:100:Times:drives their simulation results. Therefore their results should be applicable to delegations that represent 
21:587:43148:11:12:90:520:120:100:Times:100:Times:metropolitan areas as well. Nonetheless, the political reality is that the redistricting process is controlled by 
21:588:43262:12:11:90:522:108:100:Times:100:Times:the state legislature and districts must fall within state boundaries. So for MSAs that cross state boundaries, 
21:589:43374:11:12:90:512:97:100:Times:100:Times:it may not be possible to equalize percent Black throughout the MSA. This constraint, however, does not 
21:590:43478:12:7:90:474:85:100:Times:100:Times:alter the relationship between equalization of percent Black within an area and Black efficacy.   
21:591:43576:7:0:90:384:78:42:Times:100:Times:45 See Appendix Table III for means to accompany this Table V Panel B. 
22:592:43649:0:27:90:512:708:144:Times:144:Times:districts in these metro areas. To investigate this supposition we continue to run models 
22:593:43739:27:28:89:501:681:144:Times:144:Times:of the form of Equation 5 where our outcomes are now measures of the demographic 
22:594:43820:28:27:89:515:653:144:Times:144:Times:characteristics of the districts within the MSA.46 The first row of the panel examines the 
22:595:43911:27:28:89:523:626:144:Times:144:Times:influence of segregation on the fraction of districts in which Blacks comprise less than 10 
22:596:44003:28:28:89:518:598:144:Times:144:Times:percent of the population. Blacks are 5-6 percent of the population in the average district 
22:597:44095:28:27:90:522:570:144:Times:144:Times:in the 2SLS sample. Thus negative coefficients on segregation in these regressions would 
22:598:44184:27:28:90:513:543:144:Times:144:Times:indicate that in more segregated MSAs Blacks are less likely to be spread evenly across 
22:599:44272:28:27:90:505:515:144:Times:144:Times:districts, which would be one explanation for their efficacy decreasing in segregation. 
22:600:44360:27:28:90:520:488:144:Times:144:Times:However, as the results of the first row of the table indicate, segregation is positively and 
22:601:44454:28:28:90:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:significantly associated with the fraction of districts that are under 10 percent Black in all 
22:602:44549:28:27:90:487:432:144:Times:144:Times:three sample periods. We consider districts that are more than 10 percent Black as 
22:603:44632:27:28:90:514:405:144:Times:144:Times:“heavily” Black for our northern sample, where only 5-10 percent of districts fall in this 
22:604:44723:28:27:90:525:377:144:Times:144:Times:category. But there is heterogeneity in percent Black amongst this group of districts. In an 
22:605:44816:27:28:90:510:350:144:Times:144:Times:un-tabled regression we create dummies for 0-10, 10-25, 25-50 and 50 or more percent 
22:606:44901:28:27:90:488:322:144:Times:144:Times:Black to allow for the impact of segregation to differ across the three categories of 
22:607:44987:27:28:90:508:295:144:Times:144:Times:“heavily” Black districts. We find no such variation. Blacks in more segregated MSAs 
22:608:45072:28:28:90:524:267:144:Times:144:Times:are significantly less likely to be living in districts that are 10-25 percent Black. The signs 
22:609:45168:28:27:90:516:239:144:Times:144:Times:are mixed and insignificant on 25-50 and 50 and higher percent Black.  Thus we find no 
22:610:45255:27:28:90:501:212:144:Times:144:Times:evidence that segregation lessens Black efficacy by isolating Blacks in heavily Black 
22:611:45341:28:27:90:137:184:144:Times:144:Times:districts.  
22:612:45353:27:28:90:492:157:144:Times:144:Times: In the final row of Table V we measure the spread of Blacks across districts 
22:613:45430:28:20:90:508:129:144:Times:144:Times:within an MSA using a different metric: the standard deviation of the districts’ percent 
22:614:45519:20:8:90:237:109:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
22:615:45567:8:16:90:523:101:42:Times:100:Times:46 Because of data limitations, we are unable to measure the percent Black for each redistricting that occurs. 
22:616:45678:16:11:90:516:85:100:Times:100:Times:Therefore we measure these outcomes once per decade, at the time of the first election following the most 
22:617:45784:11:0:90:151:74:100:Times:100:Times:recent census.  
23:618:45802:0:27:90:522:708:144:Times:144:Times:Black. (The limitation of this measure is, of course, that it is not defined for MSAs whose 
23:619:45894:27:28:90:486:681:144:Times:144:Times:residents are all assigned to the same district.) Once again, we find no evidence of 
23:620:45979:28:27:89:473:653:144:Times:144:Times:segregation increasing the variation in percent Black across districts. In fact the 
23:621:46063:27:28:90:465:626:144:Times:144:Times:relationship between segregation and standard deviation is negative, although 
23:622:46141:28:28:90:509:598:144:Times:144:Times:insignificant, across the three decades. Cameron, Epstein and O’Halloran (1996) assert 
23:623:46228:28:27:90:523:570:144:Times:144:Times:that substantive representation of Blacks is decreasing in the standard deviation of district 
23:624:46322:27:28:90:521:543:144:Times:144:Times:percent Black in an area. Assuming their assertion correct, the results of Table V Panel B 
23:625:46413:28:27:90:507:515:144:Times:144:Times:provide no evidence that district configuration is the mechanism by which segregation 
23:626:46499:27:28:90:385:488:144:Times:144:Times:has lessened Black political efficacy across three decades.47   
23:627:46563:28:28:89:196:460:144:Times:144:Times:III.B.2 Voter Turnout 
23:628:46585:28:27:89:496:432:144:Times:144:Times: A second possible mechanism by which segregation may impact Black civic 
23:629:46657:27:28:89:493:405:144:Times:144:Times:efficacy is through political participation, particularly in the form of voting. Ananat 
23:630:46745:28:27:89:517:377:144:Times:144:Times:(2007) shows that segregation significantly increases the rate of poverty amongst Blacks 
23:631:46834:27:28:89:521:350:144:Times:144:Times:while significantly decreasing the poverty rate amongst Whites.  We know from previous 
23:632:46921:28:27:90:514:322:144:Times:144:Times:work that lower-income subgroups are less likely to vote. (See for example Leighly and 
23:633:47008:27:28:90:502:295:144:Times:144:Times:Nagler, 1992.) Thus it may be the case that segregation decreases Black voter turnout 
23:634:47094:28:28:90:527:267:144:Times:144:Times:and/or increases non-Black voter turnout, resulting in a decrease in Black civic efficacy.48  
23:635:47188:28:27:90:503:239:144:Times:144:Times: We examine the impact of segregation on voting behavior (as well as political 
23:636:47266:27:34:90:494:212:144:Times:144:Times:attitudes) using data from the National Election Studies (NES), a biennial survey of 
23:637:47351:34:8:90:237:178:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
23:638:47399:8:16:90:521:170:42:Times:100:Times:47 We also investigated the possibility that non-MSA residents who share districts with MSA residents may 
23:639:47505:16:11:90:494:154:100:Times:100:Times:be more (less) sympathetic to Black political interests and therefore driving the relationship between 
23:640:47608:11:12:90:494:143:100:Times:100:Times:segregation and Black civic efficacy. However we find no support for such a hypothesis. We find no 
23:641:47707:12:11:90:521:131:100:Times:100:Times:evidence that more segregated MSAs are carved into significantly more/fewer districts than less segregated 
23:642:47814:11:12:90:515:120:100:Times:100:Times:MSAs. These findings are not surprising given that our results in Table IV are not altered significantly by 
23:643:47922:12:7:90:221:108:100:Times:100:Times:population weighting outcomes. 
23:644:47953:7:16:90:521:101:42:Times:100:Times:48 This is just one mechanism by which segregation could impact turnout. Coate and Conlin’s (2004) group 
23:645:48058:16:11:90:521:85:100:Times:100:Times:rule utilitarian model suggests that segregation could impact turnout because in a segregated area it may be 
23:646:48167:11:0:90:217:74:100:Times:100:Times:easier to enforce group norms.  
24:647:48201:0:27:90:512:708:144:Times:144:Times:United States residents of voting age. Using these data we run 2SLS models, separately 
24:648:48288:27:29:89:384:681:144:Times:144:Times:for Black and non-Black respondents, of the following form: 
24:649:48348:29:29:89:377:652:144:Times:144:Times:(6) outcomei = αι+ β1(segregation)i + β2(tracklength)i + ui.. 
24:650:48410:29:29:90:350:623:144:Times:64:Times:(7) segregationi = αι + δ1(RDI)i + γ1(tracklength)i + ui 
24:651:48467:29:27:90:512:594:144:Times:144:Times:where segregation is now the predicted level of segregation in the respondent’s MSA.49 
24:652:48553:27:28:89:497:567:144:Times:144:Times:We conduct our analyses separately by decade50 and by racial group: Black and non-
24:653:48635:28:27:89:490:539:144:Times:144:Times:Black. When possible, we substitute the first wave of the National Survey of Black 
24:654:48718:27:28:89:499:512:144:Times:144:Times:Americans, fielded in 1979-1980, for the 1970 Black NES sample, in which our first 
24:655:48801:28:28:89:342:484:144:Times:144:Times:stage was not significant. (See Appendix Table IV.) 
24:656:48853:28:27:89:523:456:144:Times:144:Times: Across decades, we find no significant relationship between segregation and voter 
24:657:48935:27:28:89:511:429:144:Times:144:Times:turnout of either Blacks or non-Blacks. (See the first row of Table VI for these results). 
24:658:49026:28:27:89:515:401:144:Times:144:Times:Further, point estimates do not support the contention that the segregation/civic efficacy 
24:659:49117:27:28:89:486:374:144:Times:144:Times:link runs through turnout. The relationship between segregation and turnout is not 
24:660:49200:28:28:89:511:346:144:Times:144:Times:significant, except for Blacks in the 1970s, when it is positive. Thus we find no support 
24:661:49290:28:27:89:504:318:144:Times:144:Times:for the supposition that segregation decreases Black efficacy by increasing non-Black 
24:662:49376:27:28:89:286:291:144:Times:144:Times:turnout and/or decreasing Black turnout. 
24:663:49417:28:27:89:217:263:144:Times:144:Times:III.B.3. Political Attitudes 
24:664:49446:27:28:89:479:236:144:Times:144:Times: Thus far our findings suggest that neither district configuration nor racial 
24:665:49523:28:27:89:482:208:144:Times:144:Times:variation in turnout accounts for segregation’s negative impact on Black political 
24:666:49606:27:28:89:508:181:144:Times:144:Times:efficacy. A third explanation is that political views of Blacks and non-Blacks are more 
24:667:49694:28:21:89:515:153:144:Times:144:Times:divergent in more segregated areas. Blacks are not a majority of residents in any time or 
24:668:49784:21:8:89:237:132:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
24:669:49832:8:16:90:502:124:42:Times:100:Times:49 We use respondents’ states and congressional districts to match them to our time invariantly defined 
24:670:49936:16:11:90:521:108:100:Times:100:Times:MSAs. In cases where a district lies in more than one MSA we define the respondent’s level of segregation 
24:671:50042:11:12:90:516:97:100:Times:100:Times:as the average segregation in the MSAs. Reported regression results are thus clustered at the district level. 
24:672:50152:12:7:90:414:85:100:Times:100:Times:However, the significance of our results is robust to clustering at the state level.  
24:673:50238:7:0:90:514:78:42:Times:100:Times:50 We define the survey years 1972-1980 as the 1970s, 1982-1990 as the 1980s and 1992-2000 the 1990s. 
25:674:50342:0:27:90:520:708:144:Times:144:Times:place in our sample frame. Therefore, as non-Black political views move increasingly far 
25:675:50431:27:28:90:517:681:144:Times:144:Times:from Black political views, by definition, Blacks move farther away from the mean (and 
25:676:50518:28:27:90:475:653:144:Times:144:Times:likely the median) viewpoint. We examine the evidence for the divergent views 
25:677:50596:27:28:90:515:626:144:Times:144:Times:explanation in the remainder of Table VI. In this table we continue to present the results 
25:678:50687:28:28:90:524:598:144:Times:144:Times:from models of the form of equations 6 and 7 using the NES (and NSBA where possible.) 
25:679:50773:28:27:90:512:570:144:Times:144:Times: In the second panel of the table entitled “Attitudes toward Race” we explore the 
25:680:50854:27:28:90:512:543:144:Times:144:Times:impact of segregation on racial tolerance and support for policies which benefit Blacks. 
25:681:50943:28:27:90:512:515:144:Times:144:Times:Our first outcome is non-Black respondents’ feelings about Blacks measured on a scale 
25:682:51029:27:28:90:515:488:144:Times:144:Times:of 0 (very negative) to 100 (very positive). The -.889 coefficient in the 1970s regression 
25:683:51120:28:28:90:476:460:144:Times:144:Times:is unfortunately too imprecise to be informative. However, the 1980s and 1990s 
25:684:51199:28:27:90:495:432:144:Times:144:Times:coefficients say that an increase in segregation of one standard deviation results in a 
25:685:51287:27:28:89:524:405:144:Times:144:Times:significant decrease in non-Black feelings about Blacks of .06 and .18 standard deviations 
25:686:51378:28:27:89:524:377:144:Times:144:Times:respectively.51 In the remainder of the row we examine Black feelings toward Whites (the 
25:687:51467:27:28:89:493:350:144:Times:144:Times:largest non-Black subgroup). Point estimates suggest that feelings about Whites are 
25:688:51551:28:27:89:484:322:144:Times:144:Times:increasing in segregation in the 1980s and decreasing in segregation in the 1990s. 
25:689:51634:27:28:89:392:295:144:Times:144:Times:However, all estimates are far too imprecise to be informative. 
25:690:51698:28:28:89:520:267:144:Times:144:Times: Next, we examine how segregation impacts feelings about race-based policy. The 
25:691:51777:28:27:89:522:239:144:Times:144:Times:focal question asks respondents whether they support government policies to improve the 
25:692:51865:27:28:89:517:212:144:Times:144:Times:social and economic position of Blacks. Respondents were asked to place themselves on 
25:693:51951:28:27:89:492:184:144:Times:144:Times:a seven point scale from a low of 1 (Government should help Blacks) to a high of 7 
25:694:52034:27:28:89:501:157:144:Times:144:Times:(Blacks should help themselves).52 Non-Blacks have a mean score for the measure of 
25:695:52117:28:20:90:521:129:144:Times:144:Times:between four and five across decades. However, across time, Blacks increasingly support 
25:696:52205:20:8:90:237:109:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
25:697:52253:8:11:90:433:101:42:Times:100:Times:51 See Appendix Table V for means and standard deviations to accompany Table VI.  
25:698:52335:11:16:90:502:90:42:Times:100:Times:52 Prior to 1988, the question asked about “Blacks (Negroes) and other minority groups.” Beginning in 
25:699:52437:16:0:90:276:74:100:Times:100:Times:1988, the question focused solely on Blacks.   
26:700:52486:0:27:90:508:708:144:Times:144:Times:the view that Blacks should help themselves (from a mean of 2.3 in the 1970s to 3.8 in 
26:701:52573:27:28:90:503:681:144:Times:144:Times:the 1990s). Point estimates of the impact of segregation on this belief suggest that the 
26:702:52662:28:27:89:520:653:144:Times:144:Times:tendency, among non-Blacks, to believe that Blacks should help themselves is increasing 
26:703:52750:27:28:89:500:626:144:Times:144:Times:in segregation across decades. The relationship is significant in the 1980s and 1990s, 
26:704:52837:28:28:89:512:598:144:Times:144:Times:when a one standard deviation increase in segregation predicts an increase in this belief 
26:705:52927:28:27:89:479:570:144:Times:144:Times:of .11 and .17 standard deviations respectively. Results for Blacks, though never 
26:706:53009:27:28:89:520:543:144:Times:144:Times:significant, are opposite signed from non-Blacks in the 1980s and near zero in the 1990s. 
26:707:53099:28:27:89:516:515:144:Times:144:Times:Thus the “Attitudes toward Race” panel provides evidence that the relationship between 
26:708:53186:27:28:89:519:488:144:Times:144:Times:segregation and Black civic efficacy may be driven by non-Black support for Blacks and 
26:709:53273:28:28:89:435:460:144:Times:144:Times:policies that favor Blacks, as this support is decreasing in segregation.   
26:710:53349:28:27:89:509:432:144:Times:144:Times: Next we look at the impact of segregation on political attitudes more generally. 
26:711:53430:27:28:89:516:405:144:Times:144:Times:The first outcome of interest is the respondent’s view of how liberal/conservative s/he is 
26:712:53521:28:27:89:516:377:144:Times:144:Times:on a scale from 1 (extremely liberal) to 7 (extremely conservative).  Across decades, the 
26:713:53611:27:28:89:491:350:144:Times:144:Times:non-Black mean on this measure has hovered around 4.3 while the Black mean has 
26:714:53690:28:27:89:483:322:144:Times:144:Times:grown from 3.3 to 3.8. Reported in the first row under “Political Attitudes,” point 
26:715:53774:27:28:89:466:295:144:Times:144:Times:estimates from specifications using this outcome suggest that, across decades, 
26:716:53853:28:28:89:468:267:144:Times:144:Times:polarization in political views is increasing in segregation. While conservative 
26:717:53933:28:27:89:507:239:144:Times:144:Times:identification is increasing in segregation amongst non-Blacks, liberal identification is 
26:718:54023:27:28:89:503:212:144:Times:144:Times:increasing in segregation amongst Blacks. The relationship is significant only for non-
26:719:54110:28:27:89:507:184:144:Times:144:Times:Blacks in the 1980s and 1990s, where a one standard deviation increase in segregation 
26:720:54196:27:28:89:499:157:144:Times:144:Times:increases the mean tendency toward conservatism by .18 and .27 standard deviations 
26:721:54279:28:0:89:153:129:144:Times:144:Times:respectively. 
27:722:54295:0:27:90:522:708:144:Times:144:Times: The second more general political attitude we examine is party identification. The 
27:723:54378:27:28:90:495:681:144:Times:144:Times:NES asks respondents to place themselves on a scale from 1 (strong Democrat) to 7 
27:724:54460:28:27:90:522:653:144:Times:144:Times:(strong Republican). Not surprisingly, given Blacks’ tendency to vote Democratic, across 
27:725:54549:27:28:90:496:626:144:Times:144:Times:decades, the mean of this measure is approximately four for non-Blacks and two for 
27:726:54632:28:28:90:524:598:144:Times:144:Times:Blacks. Amongst non-Blacks we see that segregation increases the tendency to identify as 
27:727:54721:28:27:89:522:570:144:Times:144:Times:Republican; coefficients indicate a significant relationship for the 1970s and 1990s, when 
27:728:54812:27:28:89:521:543:144:Times:144:Times:a one standard deviation increase in segregation increases Republican identification by .4 
27:729:54903:28:27:89:523:515:144:Times:144:Times:and .14 standard deviations respectively. Identification translates into behavior, or at least 
27:730:54998:27:28:90:503:488:144:Times:144:Times:reported behavior, as the results of the final row of the table demonstrate a significant 
27:731:55088:28:28:90:507:460:144:Times:144:Times:negative relationship between segregation and votes for the Democratic Party, in 1970 
27:732:55174:28:27:90:506:432:144:Times:144:Times:and 1990. The impact of segregation on Black party identification and vote choice are 
27:733:55260:27:28:90:414:405:144:Times:144:Times:unclear, as insignificant coefficients flip signs across the decades.   
27:734:55332:28:27:90:490:377:144:Times:144:Times: Thus the results of Table VI suggest that political attitudes may explain the 
27:735:55410:27:28:89:483:350:144:Times:144:Times:relationship between segregation and decreased Black civic efficacy. Segregation 
27:736:55491:28:27:89:524:322:144:Times:144:Times:increases non-Blacks’ tendency to identify and vote conservatively and to oppose policies 
27:737:55581:27:28:89:512:295:144:Times:144:Times:that favor Blacks. Point estimates suggest that segregation, on the other hand, increases 
27:738:55671:28:28:89:513:267:144:Times:144:Times:Blacks’ tendency to identify as liberals. This evidence points not only to an explanation 
27:739:55761:28:27:89:517:239:144:Times:144:Times:for decreased efficacy for Blacks in more segregated areas, but also suggests that Blacks 
27:740:55851:27:28:89:514:212:144:Times:144:Times:in the most segregated areas are less efficacious than our Table V results suggest. Black 
27:741:55941:28:27:89:512:184:144:Times:144:Times:liberal identification is increasing in segregation, while the tendency for representatives 
27:742:56033:27:28:89:457:157:144:Times:144:Times:to vote liberally on issues of interest to Blacks is decreasing in segregation.  
27:743:56114:28:28:126:506:129:144:Times:144:Times:Such divergence could come about in either or both of two ways:  1) Increased 
27:744:56192:28:0:90:484:101:144:Times:144:Times:contact with Blacks in less segregated cities could cause non-Blacks to hold more 
28:745:56276:0:27:90:486:708:144:Times:144:Times:favorable views toward policies which benefit Blacks. This could arise because of 
28:746:56358:27:28:90:500:681:144:Times:144:Times:interactions with Black neighbors as postulated by the contact hypothesis53 or from a 
28:747:56444:28:27:89:508:653:144:Times:144:Times:feeling that they will benefit more directly from policies that benefit Blacks when they 
28:748:56533:27:28:89:517:626:144:Times:144:Times:live nearer to Blacks. 2) Alternatively, the link between segregation and efficacy may be 
28:749:56623:28:28:89:510:598:144:Times:144:Times:due to selection. Non-Blacks who hold the least favorable views toward policies which 
28:750:56709:28:27:89:402:570:144:Times:144:Times:Blacks support may choose to live in the most segregated cities.  
28:751:56775:27:28:125:519:543:144:Times:144:Times:Distinguishing between these two mechanisms is important for understanding the 
28:752:56854:28:27:89:484:515:144:Times:144:Times:impact of segregation on Black political efficacy nationally. If segregation causes 
28:753:56938:27:28:89:500:488:144:Times:144:Times:decreased efficacy through lack of contact, then increased segregation in MSA 1 will 
28:754:57023:28:28:89:519:460:144:Times:144:Times:decrease Black efficacy in MSA 1 and therefore Black efficacy nationally, on average. If 
28:755:57112:28:27:89:505:432:144:Times:144:Times:segregation causes decreased efficacy through selection, then increased segregation in 
28:756:57199:27:28:89:503:405:144:Times:144:Times:MSA 1 will decrease efficacy in MSA 1 but may increase efficacy in MSA 2 as those 
28:757:57281:28:27:89:514:377:144:Times:144:Times:who hold the least favorable views of policies that Blacks support move from MSA 2 to 
28:758:57367:27:28:89:497:350:144:Times:144:Times:MSA 1. Distinguishing between contact and selection, however, is not important for 
28:759:57450:28:27:89:522:322:144:Times:144:Times:understanding the effects of segregation on those individuals who face budget constraints 
28:760:57540:27:28:89:346:295:144:Times:144:Times:that prevent their relocating from MSA 1 to MSA 2.  
28:761:57592:28:28:89:524:267:144:Times:144:Times: In Table VII we investigate whether selection and/or contact explain the impact of 
28:762:57675:28:27:89:496:239:144:Times:144:Times:segregation on Black political efficacy. The first three columns of the table focus on 
28:763:57762:27:28:89:513:212:144:Times:144:Times:selection. In these columns, we repeat the attitudinal analysis of Table VI; however, we 
28:764:57851:28:75:89:507:184:144:Times:144:Times:limit the sample to those non-Black individuals54 over the age of 30 who moved to the 
28:765:57937:75:8:90:237:109:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
28:766:57985:8:16:90:520:101:42:Times:100:Times:53 See for example Brophy (1945), Deutsch and Collins (1951), Jackman and Crane (1986), Putnam (1966) 
28:767:58087:16:7:90:196:85:100:Times:100:Times:and Wilner et. al. (1952).  
28:768:58115:7:0:90:394:78:42:Times:100:Times:54 We do not perform this exercise for Blacks due to the small sample size.  
29:769:58194:0:27:90:515:708:144:Times:144:Times:community55 within the past two years. In other words, we focus on adults who recently 
29:770:58281:27:28:90:518:681:144:Times:144:Times:selected to live in the area. Looking at the first measure, the Black thermometer, we find 
29:771:58372:28:27:90:510:653:144:Times:144:Times:in both the 1970s and 1980s, the relationship between selecting a more segregated area 
29:772:58459:27:28:90:521:626:144:Times:144:Times:and attitude toward Blacks is insignificant. However, in the 1990s we find that those who 
29:773:58549:28:28:90:521:598:144:Times:144:Times:have chosen more segregated areas have significantly more negative ratings of Blacks. In 
29:774:58638:28:27:90:521:570:144:Times:144:Times:fact in the 1990s, for four of five attitudinal outcomes we find that individuals who select 
29:775:58731:27:28:89:515:543:144:Times:144:Times:more segregated areas hold significantly more conservative views than those who select 
29:776:58818:28:27:89:512:515:144:Times:144:Times:less segregated areas. At least for the 1990s, it appears that selection does play a role in 
29:777:58911:27:28:89:376:488:144:Times:144:Times:linking segregation and decreased Black political efficacy.  
29:778:58972:28:28:89:490:460:144:Times:144:Times: In the final three columns of Table VII we explore whether contact (or lack 
29:779:59048:28:27:89:477:432:144:Times:144:Times:thereof) is another path from segregation to efficacy. The ideal methodology for 
29:780:59129:27:28:89:524:405:144:Times:144:Times:exploring this question would be to randomly assign individuals to communities. Boisjoly 
29:781:59218:28:27:89:521:377:144:Times:144:Times:et. al (2006) use such a methodology to find that white college students who, in their first 
29:782:59311:27:28:89:510:350:144:Times:144:Times:year of school, were randomly assigned Black roommates, hold more positive views of 
29:783:59395:28:27:89:509:322:144:Times:144:Times:affirmative action several years after college entry than those who were assigned white 
29:784:59483:27:28:89:487:295:144:Times:144:Times:roommates. But whether these results are generalizeable to the community level is 
29:785:59565:28:28:89:522:267:144:Times:144:Times:unknown. Unable to randomly assign individuals to MSAs, we focus our contact analysis 
29:786:59651:28:27:89:504:239:144:Times:144:Times:on non-Black individuals thirty years of age and younger.56 Younger individuals have 
29:787:59736:27:28:90:497:212:144:Times:144:Times:had less of an opportunity to leave the locale that their parents chose for them and to 
29:788:59824:28:27:90:512:184:144:Times:144:Times:move to their ideal community. Clearly two limitations of this methodology are that: 1) 
29:789:59912:27:25:90:496:157:144:Times:144:Times:Some younger individuals have relocated from their parents’ hometowns (or made a 
29:790:59993:25:8:90:237:132:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
29:791:60041:8:16:90:523:124:42:Times:100:Times:55 The NES asks, “How long have you lived here in your present city/town/township/county?” The measure 
29:792:60144:16:11:90:512:108:100:Times:100:Times:is less than ideal for our purposes as a respondent may move to a different county but remain in the same 
29:793:60250:11:7:89:118:97:100:Times:100:Times:MSA.  
29:794:60256:7:16:90:519:90:42:Times:100:Times:56 The somewhat more convincing strategy of relating attitudes to MSA of birth is not possible because the 
29:795:60363:16:0:90:368:74:100:Times:100:Times:NES identifies only state, but not MSA or county or district, of birth. 
30:796:60437:0:27:90:506:708:144:Times:144:Times:deliberate decision to stay) and 2) The parents did select these communities. For these 
30:797:60525:27:28:90:437:681:144:Times:144:Times:reasons the results of the second half of Table VII are only suggestive.   
30:798:60600:28:27:125:484:653:144:Times:144:Times:The Table VII column 4-6 results suggest that contact affects non-Blacks’ 
30:799:60674:27:28:89:481:626:144:Times:144:Times:attitudes toward Blacks. We see in the 1990s that young people who live in more 
30:800:60754:28:28:89:494:598:144:Times:144:Times:segregated areas have significantly less positive views of Blacks. The results on the 
30:801:60840:28:27:89:503:570:144:Times:144:Times:remaining attitudinal outcomes are less informative. Coefficients are not significantly 
30:802:60928:27:28:89:524:543:144:Times:144:Times:different than the significant results we find for the full sample, suggesting that those who 
30:803:61022:28:27:89:520:515:144:Times:144:Times:were placed in more segregated communities developed more conservative attitudes than 
30:804:61108:27:28:89:479:488:144:Times:144:Times:those placed in less segregated communities. However, results are imprecise and 
30:805:61188:28:28:89:499:460:144:Times:144:Times:insignificant. Thus the results of Table VII show that selection (at least in the 1990s) 
30:806:61277:28:27:89:494:432:144:Times:144:Times:plays a role in the impact of segregation on non-Black attitudes and therefore Black 
30:807:61362:27:28:89:496:405:144:Times:144:Times:political outcomes. The table provides some evidence, particularly in regards to non-
30:808:61447:28:27:89:488:377:144:Times:144:Times:Blacks’ views of Blacks, that segregation also impacts attitudes through decreased 
30:809:61530:27:28:89:222:350:144:Times:144:Times:contact amongst the races.  
30:810:61558:28:27:89:164:322:144:Times:144:Times:IV Conclusion  
30:811:61573:27:28:89:524:295:144:Times:144:Times: Blacks in more segregated metropolitan areas fare worse than their counterparts in 
30:812:61656:28:28:89:507:267:144:Times:144:Times:less segregated areas on a variety of economic outcomes. In this paper, we explore the 
30:813:61743:28:27:89:520:239:144:Times:144:Times:connection between segregation and political efficacy, an outcome that to our knowledge 
30:814:61831:27:28:89:318:212:144:Times:144:Times:has not been studied in relation to segregation.  
30:815:61881:28:27:89:473:184:144:Times:144:Times: We find that Black political efficacy (as measured by the ability to elect 
30:816:61956:27:28:89:472:157:144:Times:144:Times:representatives who vote in accordance with the preferences of Black voters) is 
30:817:62036:28:28:89:487:129:144:Times:144:Times:decreasing in segregation. This result does not arise because of differential district 
30:818:62123:28:0:89:511:101:144:Times:144:Times:configuration or because of differential voter turnout by race. We do find evidence that 
31:819:62214:0:27:90:504:708:144:Times:144:Times:the efficacy result is due to variation in attitudes. Non-Blacks have more conservative 
31:820:62302:27:28:90:519:681:144:Times:144:Times:political views in more segregated areas.  Given the belief in this country in the ability to 
31:821:62396:28:27:90:494:653:144:Times:144:Times:effect change through political activity, our results may explain in part why Blacks’ 
31:822:62482:27:0:90:331:626:144:Times:144:Times:economic outcomes are decreasing in segregation.
