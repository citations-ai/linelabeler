2:25:1063:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:We observe less efficient capital allocation in countries whose banking systems are more thoroughly
2:26:1162:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:controlled by tycoons or families. The magnitude of this effect is similar to that of state control over
2:27:1266:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:banking. Unlike state control, tycoon or family control also correlates with slower economic and productivity
2:28:1375:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:growth, greater financial instability, and worse income inequality. These findings are consistent with
2:29:1477:14:42:72:496:532:12:Times:12:Times:theories that elite-capture of a country’s financial system can embed “crony capitalism”.

3:48:1905:0:21:72:219:705:257:Times:257:Times:1.      Introduction      
3:49:1931:21:22:72:539:684:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Economic  growth  correlates  strongly  with  financial  development  (King  &  Levine  1993ab;  Demirguc-
3:50:2037:22:22:72:543:662:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Kunt  &  Levine  1996;  Levine  1996;  Levine  &  Zervos  1998;  Rajan  &  Zingales  1998;  Demirguc-Kunt  &  
3:51:2147:22:23:72:542:640:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Maksimovic 1998; Beck et al. 2000; Levine et al. 2000; Beck & Levine 2002). But financial development 
3:52:2249:23:21:72:544:617:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:is  neither  inevitable  nor  irreversible.  Many  countries  never  sustained  dynamic  financial  systems;  and  
3:53:2364:21:22:72:433:596:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:more surprisingly, many that once did ceased doing so (Rajan & Zingales 2003).  
3:54:2444:22:23:108:542:574:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:One explanation for financial underdevelopment is that growth can undermine the positions of the 
3:55:2541:23:21:72:544:551:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:already  wealthy  (Schumpeter  1912,  1951;  Morck,  Stangeland  &  Yeung  2000,  Fogel  et  al.  2008).  Thus,  
3:56:2654:21:22:72:543:530:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Rajan & Zingales (2004) argue that early 20th century financial development enriched an initial cadre of 
3:57:2759:22:23:71:543:508:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:tycoons who, in many countries, then successfully oversaw financial development reversals that deprived 
3:58:2863:23:21:71:542:485:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:potential competitors and innovative upstarts of capital. This, they posit, locks in a status quo favoring the 
3:59:2974:21:22:71:544:464:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:initial  tycoons  and  their  heirs.  Morck,  Wolfenzon,  &  Yeung  (2005)  further  argue  that  many  countries  
3:60:3089:22:23:71:533:442:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:block financial development entirely to forestall competition that threatens entrenched economic elites.   
3:61:3196:23:21:108:544:419:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Consistent  with  these  theses,  economies  that  entrust  more  of  their  economies  to  old-moneyed  
3:62:3301:21:22:71:545:398:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:business  families  grow  slower  and  sustain  lower  living  standards  than  otherwise  similar  countries,  
3:63:3413:22:23:71:543:376:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:suggesting  that  protecting  these  families  imposes  costs  on  the  broader  economy  (Morck,  Stangeland  &  
3:64:3527:23:21:71:544:353:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Yeung  2000).  Such  countries  also  have  more  corrupt  government,  less  efficient  judiciaries,  and  more  
3:65:3641:21:22:71:543:332:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:bureaucratic red tape (Fogel 2006) – all likely barriers to entrepreneurs.  However, the most direct way to 
3:66:3749:22:23:71:544:310:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:limit  competition  from  new  entrepreneurs  is  probably  to  limit  their  access  to  capital  by  controlling  the  
3:67:3870:23:21:71:308:287:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:country’s financial system (Rajan & Zingales 2004).  
3:68:3923:21:22:108:543:266:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Such situations are described as elite capture.  This arises if an elite – a minority such as the very 
3:69:4026:22:23:71:544:244:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:wealthy,  political  insiders,  or  an  ethnic  group  –  controls  an  economic,  political,  or  other  institution  to  
3:70:4149:23:21:71:544:221:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:advance  the  minority’s  interests,  rather  than  general  social  welfare  (Glaeser,  Scheinkman  &  Shleifer  
3:71:4263:21:22:71:543:200:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:2003; Hellman, Jones & Kaufmann 2003; and others). Elite capture of a country’s financial system might 
3:72:4366:22:23:71:543:178:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:occur  in  various  ways,  but  would  be  incomplete  without  control  over  banks,  which  Beck  et  al.  (2008)  
3:73:4483:23:21:71:543:155:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:show to be an essential source of capital for small businesses across countries We measure the potential 
3:74:4588:21:22:71:543:134:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f1:elite  capture  of  each  country’s  banking  system  by  the  fraction  of  its  largest  banks,  listed  and  unlisted,  
3:75:4711:22:0:71:472:112:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:controlled by tycoons and business families. For brevity, we refer to this as family control. 
4:76:4807:0:22:108:544:702:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:  Controlling  for  banking  system  size,  stock  market  size,  and  other  relevant  factors  we  find  that  
4:77:4920:22:22:72:544:680:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:more  predominantly  family-controlled  banking  systems  allocate  capital  less  efficiently,  measured  either  
4:78:5035:22:22:72:540:658:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:by  Wurgler’s  (2000)  cross-industry  correlation  of  capital  spending  growth  with  value-added  or  by  non-
4:79:5149:22:22:72:543:636:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:performing  loans.  The  efficiency  loss  is  comparable  to  what La  Porta  et  al.  (2002),  Caprio  et  al.  (2007)  
4:80:5270:22:22:72:544:614:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:and  others  find  for  state-controlled  banking  systems.  However,  family-controlled  banking  systems  also  
4:81:5384:22:22:72:540:592:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:correlate  with  financial  instability  and  slower  per  capita  GDP  and  productivity  growth;  while  state-
4:82:5497:22:22:72:543:570:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:controlled banking systems do not. These findings are highly robust - including to reasonable sources of 
4:83:5602:22:22:72:543:548:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:endogeneity.  Family  control  of  banks  also  correlates  with  proxies  for  crony  capitalism  (Murphy  et  al. 
4:84:5717:22:22:72:544:526:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:1991,  1993;  Shleifer  &  Vishny  1993;  Shleifer  &  Vishny  1998b;  Haber  2002;  Krueger  2002;  Rajan  &  
4:85:5828:22:22:72:544:504:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Zingales  2004;  Daniels  &  Trebilcock  2008;  Fisman  &  Miguel  2008;  and  others),  such  as  high  income  
4:86:5941:22:22:72:219:482:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:inequality and barriers to entry.   
4:87:5977:22:22:108:544:460:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:We  conclude  that,  on  average,  entrusting  the  governance  of  large  banks  to  tycoons  or  families  
4:88:6086:22:22:72:544:438:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:provides  efficiency  losses  comparable  to  those  of  state-controlled  banks,  augmented  by  the  inequality  
4:89:6201:22:22:72:544:416:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:consequences  associated  with  crony  capitalism.    Of  course,  our  results  imply  neither  that  tycoon  and  
4:90:6317:22:22:72:543:394:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:family  control  are  always  inefficient  nor  that  banking  systems  predominantly  controlled  by  tycoons  or  
4:91:6433:22:22:72:544:372:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:families  always  harm  their  countries.  Our  results  do,  however,  indicate  such  cases  to  be  atypical  and  
4:92:6551:22:22:72:248:350:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:therefore especially deserving of study.

4:94:6592:22:22:74:326:306:121:g_d0_f1:257:Times: 2. The economics of bank control  
4:95:6626:22:22:72:544:284:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:The social purpose of the financial system is to allocate the economy’s savings to its highest value uses 
4:96:6732:22:22:72:545:262:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:(Tobin  1989;  Wurgler  2000)  –  especially  to  innovative  upstart  firms  (Schumpeter  1912).  A  healthy  
4:97:6843:22:22:72:544:240:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:banking  system  is  therefore  key  to  sustained  prosperity  (King  &  Levine  1993a).  Consequently,  bank  
4:98:6955:22:22:72:544:218:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:governance  affects  not  only  banks,  but  the  whole  economy.  Indeed,  policies  that  maximize  the  bank  
4:99:7068:22:22:72:543:196:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:owners’ wealth – such as excessive risk taking to exploit deposit insurance or probably bailouts – might 
4:100:7173:22:22:72:546:174:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:adversely  affect  the  overall  economy.  Such  externalities  divorce  efficient  bank  governance  from  
4:101:7281:22:22:72:544:152:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:maximizing  bank  shareholder  valuations  (Saunders  et  al.  1990).  Keeping  this  distinction  in  mind,  we  
4:102:7395:22:0:72:529:130:121:g_d0_f1:257:Times:focus on the implications of bank control for the overall economy, rather than for banks’ shareholders.  
5:103:7501:0:22:108:540:702:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Our results build on large body of previous work exploring state-controlled banking and family-
5:104:7596:22:22:71:543:680:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:controlled firms, and on a much smaller literature investigating family-controlled banks.  We now review 
5:105:7701:22:22:71:260:658:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:the most relevant parts of these literatures.

5:107:7747:22:22:72:376:614:195:Times:121:Times:2.1     State-controlled     versus private sector banks  
5:108:7804:22:22:71:544:592:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:State-controlled  banks  can  rise  above  market  forces  to  allocate  capital  where  it  advances  social  goals,  
5:109:7923:22:22:71:543:570:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:rather than where it creates the greatest bank-level profit. Such considerations allow that state-controlled 
5:110:8032:22:22:71:544:548:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:banking  systems  might  not  only  better  promote  social  goals,  such  as  income  equality  or  equality  of  
5:111:8147:22:22:71:544:526:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:opportunity,  but  also  allocate  an  economy’s  capital  more  efficiently  than  private-sector  banks  (Lewis,  
5:112:8263:22:22:71:105:504:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:1950).  
5:113:8271:22:22:107:544:482:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:However,  like  all  state-owned  enterprises,  state-controlled  banks  are  vulnerable  to  a  range  of  
5:114:8379:22:22:72:539:460:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:“government failure problems” (Shleifer & Vishny 1998a). Thus, Krueger (2002, p. 15) writes that state-
5:115:8482:22:22:72:542:438:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:controlled banking often means “cronies can be favored through the granting of domestic credit when that

5:117:8696:22:22:72:543:394:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:political entrepreneurs might still use state-controlled banks to buy political support with unsound lending

5:119:8845:22:22:108:544:350:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Which  arguments  weigh  more  heavily  in  a  typical  country  is  thus  an  empirical  question.  At  the  
5:120:8955:22:22:72:543:328:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:bank level, state control correlates with poor financial performance, and privatizations increase financial

5:123:9294:22:22:71:544:262:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:correlates  with  lower  per  capita  income  levels,  growth  rates  and  worse  financial  sector  instability  (La

5:125:9503:22:22:107:543:218:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:The weight of the evidence is thus consistent with state-controlled banking having major costs in

5:128:9838:22:22:71:543:152:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:distinguish  two  flavors  of  private  ownership  –  widely  held  banks  versus  family  held  banks,  which  are

6:136:10463:22:22:71:545:614:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:efficiently  than  state  or  family-controlled  banks.  Most  importantly,  widely  held  banks’  professional  
6:137:10576:22:22:71:542:592:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:managers, bent on maximizing shareholder value, should offer loans to established and upstart firms alike

6:142:11024:22:22:71:543:482:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:at widely held firms are thought to shun risk – either to protect firm-specific human capital (Kane 1985)

8:212:17902:22:22:108:546:240:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Politicians  might  acquiesce  because  of  rent-seeking  (Krueger  1974;  Morck  &  Yeung  2004;

8:216:18292:7:16:72:542:159:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:2 These considerations do not escape astute politicians. For example, Singapore’s then Deputy Prime Minister Hsien 
8:217:18407:16:12:72:542:143:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:Loong in a speech at The Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) on Jun 21st 2001 stated that, “with banking and 
8:218:18520:12:11:71:543:131:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:non-banking activities inter-meshed within a conglomerate, there will be a strong tendency to stretch any safety net 
8:219:18637:11:12:71:542:120:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:intended for the banking system also to cover non-bank operations in the group.” Reflecting this concern Singapore 
8:220:18752:12:11:71:542:108:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:mandates a “separation of financial and non-financial businesses within the banking groups, and to further improve

8:222:18992:12:11:71:543:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:banking  regulations  reflect  similar  concerns.  For  example  Canada  mandates  low  voting  caps  on  chartered  banks,  
8:223:19117:11:0:71:252:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:effectively forcing them to be widely held.

9:232:20016:22:22:72:543:526:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:financial  crises  if  they  continued  advancing  credit,  even  if  only  to  other  firms  controlled  by  the  same

9:244:20676:22:22:72:545:262:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:We  start  with  the  2001  global  sample  of  244  banks  Caprio  et  al.  (2007)  use  to  study  banks’  market  
9:245:20793:22:22:71:543:240:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:valuations and equity ownership structures. Although this covers 83 percent of the total banking assets in 
9:246:20900:22:22:72:543:218:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:44 large economies (Caprio et al., 2007), it omits unlisted banks – a potentially important subsample for 
9:247:21006:22:22:72:405:196:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:our study because these firms are especially likely to be family-controlled.  
9:248:21084:22:22:108:543:174:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:We therefore augment these data to include every country’s ten largest banks, listed or unlisted, 
9:249:21182:22:22:72:544:152:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:as  ranked  by  2001  assets  in  The  Banker  (2001).3 If The  Banker  lists  fewer  than  ten  large  banks  in  a  
9:250:21300:22:33:71:542:130:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:country, we add all those not already included but covered by Bankscope. This yields 427 banks from 44

9:252:21451:7:16:72:518:90:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:3 Including smaller banks would be desirable, but greatly magnifies data collection problems. Since we need to 
9:253:21562:16:0:71:469:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:gauge economy-level banking system control, focusing on large banks is defensible as a first pass.  
10:254:21664:0:22:72:543:702:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:countries.  After  merging  our  data  with  the  Caprio  et  al.  (2007)  sample  we  have  fewer  than  ten  banks  in  
10:255:21786:22:22:72:298:680:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:some countries and more than ten banks in others.  
10:256:21837:22:22:108:542:658:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:We then identify the controlling shareholder, if any, for each bank. Caprio et al. (2007) detail the 
10:257:21938:22:22:71:544:636:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:control  structures  of  the  244  banks  in  that  sample,  so  we  need  only  fill  in  control  data  only  for  the  
10:258:22060:22:22:71:548:614:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:additional   banks.   Bankscope   provides   this   information   –   in   most   cases   for   2001,   and   more

10:260:22281:22:22:71:543:570:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:banks whose controlling owner we can identify. A controlling owner is identified by 2001 for 79% of our 
10:261:22385:22:22:71:268:548:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:sample and by 2003 for 94% of the sample.

10:264:22489:22:22:72:543:482:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:We  ascertain  each  bank’s  ultimate  owners,  if  any,  as  in  Caprio  et  al.  (2007)  and  La  Porta  et  al.  (2002).  
10:265:22614:22:22:72:543:460:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:That  is,  we  first  identify  all  shareholders  with  voting  blocks  of  five  percent  or  more.  If  these  are  state  
10:266:22740:22:22:72:543:438:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:organs  or  biological  persons,  we  call  them  ultimate  owners.  However,  most  blockholders  in  most  banks  
10:267:22856:22:22:72:543:416:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:are corporations. We identify these corporations’ owners, their owners’ owners, and so on until reaching 
10:268:22961:22:22:71:543:394:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:either discernable ultimate owners (state organs or biological persons) or diffusely held entities. We then 
10:269:23069:22:22:71:542:372:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:work through these chains, aggregating voting blocks of common ultimate owners by assuming members 
10:270:23168:22:22:71:542:350:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:of a family act in concert and state organs obey a single authority. At each link in these chains, we assign 
10:271:23277:22:22:71:543:328:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:control to the ultimate owner with the largest combined voting block of ten percent or more, combining 
10:272:23380:22:22:71:544:306:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:direct  ownership  with  indirect  ownership  by  dint  of  controlling  other  corporations  owning  shares  in  the  
10:273:23499:22:22:72:543:284:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:corporation  in  question.  If  no  ten  percent  voting  block  exists,  we  say  the  corporation  in  question  has  no  
10:274:23623:22:22:71:182:262:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:controlling shareholder.  
10:275:23649:22:22:108:543:240:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1: We define each bank’s controlling shareholder, if one exists, as the ultimate owner commanding 
10:276:23744:22:22:72:544:218:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:the  largest  voting  block  of  ten  percent  of  more.  Since  the  transparency  of  ownership  structures  varies  
10:277:23863:22:22:72:543:196:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:across  countries,  this  mechanical  procedure  is  imperfect.4  We  expect  to  underestimate  the  prevalence  of  
10:278:23981:22:22:71:383:174:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:control blocks in countries with less stringent reporting requirements.  
10:279:24054:22:22:107:543:152:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:After determining the controlling shareholder we assign banks to one of three categories. We say 
10:280:24151:22:21:71:542:130:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:a bank is state-controlled if its controlling shareholder is a government entity, and family-controlled if its 
10:281:24262:21:8:216:219:109:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:                                                 
10:282:24310:8:16:72:534:101:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:4 Different countries have different blockholder reporting thresholds. In the US, all insider stakes and all owners of 
10:283:24429:16:11:71:535:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:5% or more must be disclosed. Comparable thresholds range from 2% to 25% across other countries (Schouten and 
10:284:24539:11:0:71:134:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:Siems, 2009).   
11:285:24557:0:22:72:544:702:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:controlling  shareholder  is  a  tycoon  or  family.  All  others,  denoted  widely  held  banks,  lack  a  controlling  
11:286:24678:22:22:71:543:680:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:shareholder – because they are either widely held or controlled by ten percent plus blockholders that are 
11:287:24784:22:22:71:259:658:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:widely held corporations or cooperatives.  
11:288:24827:22:22:108:544:636:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Finally,  we  construct  three  country-level  bank  governance  indexes:  fractions  of  the  banking

11:291:25171:22:22:71:453:570:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:and widely held shares of countries’ banking systems. Table 1 displays these indexes.

11:299:25701:22:22:72:543:394:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:family control (La Porta et al. 1999; Morck, Wolfenzon & Yeung 2005). An opposite problem arises for

14:417:33478:22:22:71:544:174:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:is  obtained  by  regressing  each  country’s  log  real  per  capita  GDP  on  a  constant  and  a  time  trend,  and  
14:418:33598:22:22:71:284:152:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:taking the time trend as its income growth rate.  
14:419:33648:22:22:107:543:130:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f1:TFP growth is the economy’s total factor productivity (TFP) growth rate: the growth rate in the 
14:420:33744:22:22:72:543:108:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:value  of  the  outputs  it  can  generate  from  inputs  of  a  fixed  value.  To  estimate  this,  we  assume  output  in

15:429:34312:22:22:108:543:548:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f1:Capital accumulation is the rate at which the economy’s aggregate stock of capital assets grows

15:442:35146:22:22:72:544:262:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:might  distribute  wealth  more  evenly  than  widely  held  banks  if  the  bureaucrats  or  families  place  social

15:446:35601:22:22:72:360:174:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:We therefore consider several measures of economic inequality.  
15:447:35665:22:22:72:542:152:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:             We             gauge             income  inequality  by  a  country’s  average  Gini  coefficient  from  1993  through  2003.5 
15:448:35804:22:21:72:542:130:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Another measure of inequality is the concentration of economic power in the hands of a small oligarchy,

15:450:35956:8:16:72:520:101:42:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:5 This measures the deviation of the country’s income distribution from a uniform distribution, with a zero Gini 
15:451:36069:16:11:71:539:85:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:coefficient indicating a perfectly egalitarian income distribution, and larger coefficients indicating greater inequality 
15:452:36191:11:0:71:123:74:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f1:(Gini 1921).

16:457:36663:22:22:72:481:614:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:both the income inequality and oligarchy variables using a logistic transformation, as in [2].  
16:458:36759:22:22:108:544:592:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Broad  access  to  options  for  improving  one’s  life  is  arguably  at  least  as  socially  important  as

16:461:37043:22:22:108:543:526:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:  The  first  set  gauges  access  to  information,  such  as  personal  computers  per  thousand  population  
16:462:37154:22:22:71:545:504:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:averaged  from  1993  through  2003.  Khanna  (2008)  and  others  argue  that  an  information  technology  
16:463:37263:22:22:71:544:482:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:revolution  in  the  1990s  fundamentally  changed  China,  India,  and  other  developing  economies  by  letting  
16:464:37379:22:22:71:472:460:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:their small entrepreneurs access information and markets previously unavailable to them.   
16:465:37470:22:22:107:544:438:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:  While  the  breadth  of  computer  ownership  is  a  defensible  measure  of  this  access;  there  are  
16:466:37577:22:22:71:542:416:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:alternatives. We thus use internet connections, telephone lines and car ownership per capita as robustness 
16:467:37684:22:22:72:543:394:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:checks. While we defend all these variables as proxies for equality of opportunity for small entrepreneurs, 
16:468:37792:22:22:71:544:372:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:we  recognize  that  they  also  reflect  the  size  and  wealth  of  a  country’s  “middle  class”,  and  thus  can  be

16:477:38628:22:22:72:542:174:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:upstart rivals, and might control banks to constrict financing to rivals and potential rivals. If control over 
16:478:38739:22:22:72:544:152:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:the  banking  system  complements  other  means  of  effecting  economic  entrenchment,  we  should  see  more

16:480:38963:22:22:72:543:108:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:fewer such barriers if control of the banking system is sufficient to lock in the status quo, rendering other 
16:481:39073:22:0:72:543:86:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:entry barriers superfluous. Also, state control over banks may indicate general government activism, and

17:494:40275:22:22:71:543:438:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:control  for  the  square  of  the  logarithm  of  the  country’s  per  capita  GDP  in  1992.  More  generally,  initial  
17:495:40398:22:22:71:542:416:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:economic  development  is  also  associated  with  higher  quality  institutions  (North  1989,  La  Porta  et  al. 
17:496:40513:22:22:71:543:394:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:1999), which could limit the scope for capital misallocation by providing more effective checks on bank

17:499:40733:22:22:71:542:328:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:allocation efficiency. We control for a country's general financial development with measures of the sizes 
17:500:40840:22:22:71:542:306:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:of  its  equity  and  credit  markets  relative  to  its  GDP,  following  King  &  Levine  (1993),  La  Porta  et  al.

17:503:41180:22:22:71:546:240:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:variations. Banking  system  size  is  the  total  bank  credit  outstanding  as  a  fraction  of  GDP,  likewise

17:505:41408:22:22:71:545:196:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:alternatives  to  banks  for  firms  seeking  capital  (Levine  2002).  Consequently,  a  country  with  a  large

18:514:42194:22:22:72:543:614:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:During  crises,  banks  may  be  nationalized  and  then  quickly  privatized,  making  bank  control  data  from  a  
18:515:42312:22:22:72:544:592:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:period  without  major  crises  preferable  for  our  purposes.  We  therefore  follow  Caprio  et  al.  (2007)  and  
18:516:42430:22:22:72:543:570:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Laeven & Levin (2009) in using bank control data from 2001. These are the earliest available data with 
18:517:42533:22:22:72:375:548:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:reasonably wide coverage after the 1997 Asian Crisis was resolved.  
18:518:42601:22:22:108:543:526:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:However, our dependent variables are generally estimated using data windows ending in 2003 or 
18:519:42695:22:22:72:543:504:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:2004  because  UNIDO  data,  on  which  our  investment  efficiency  measures  are  based,  exist  only  through  
18:520:42809:22:22:72:543:482:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:2003, and the Penn World Tables end in 2004. This has two unfortunate consequences. First, we cannot 
18:521:42910:22:22:72:545:460:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:run  lead  and  lag  causality  tests  between  bank  control  and  economy  performance.  Second,  our  bank  
18:522:43021:22:22:72:544:438:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:control  data  do  not  precede  the  period  in  which  we  observe  economy  level  performance.  This  timing  
18:523:43135:22:22:72:542:416:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:mismatch is important if the category of ultimate controlling shareholder changes frequently, but less so if 
18:524:43244:22:22:72:221:394:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:bank control is highly persistent.  
18:525:43280:22:22:108:544:372:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:To  check  this,  we  scan  BankScope  data  from  2001  through  2007  for  bank  control  changes.  
18:526:43382:22:22:72:544:350:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Although  banks’  controlling  shareholders  and  the  sizes  of  their  equity  blocks  both  change  during  this  
18:527:43499:22:22:72:544:328:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:period,  the  category  of  controlling  shareholder  rarely  changes;  family-controlled  banks  tend  to  remain  
18:528:43615:22:22:72:544:306:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:family-controlled,  state-controlled  banks  tend  to  remain  state-controlled,  and  widely  held  banks  tend  to  
18:529:43733:22:22:72:544:284:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:remain  widely  held.  Indeed,  we  identify  only  14  banks  (4.3%  of  the  total  324)  switching  category  from  
18:530:43852:22:22:72:543:262:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:2001  to  2007.  Two  family-controlled  banks  become  state-controlled  and  four  become  widely  held.  Four  
18:531:43966:22:22:72:543:240:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:state-controlled  banks  become  widely  held.  Two  widely  held  banks  become  family-controlled  and  two  
18:532:44077:22:22:72:542:218:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:becomes state-controlled. Laeven & Levine (2009) perform a similar exercise, checking private banks for 
18:533:44181:22:22:72:543:196:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:controlling shareholder changes from 2001 to 2005, and reach at the same conclusion: banks’ ownership 
18:534:44283:22:22:72:251:174:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:categories are very stable through time.  
18:535:44325:22:22:108:545:152:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:We  are  especially  concerned  about  temporary  bank  nationalizations  amid  financial  crises.  For  
18:536:44430:22:22:72:543:130:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:example, Sweden nationalized many of its major banks in 1992, but promptly privatized them again, and 
18:537:44532:22:22:72:544:108:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:their  controlling  shareholders  categories  reverted  to  their  pre-crisis  values.  One  major  financial  crisis  in  
18:538:44655:22:0:72:544:86:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:our  sample  period  is  the  1997  Asian  crisis.  Djankov  et  al.  (2005)  analyze  the  resolution  of  financial  
19:539:44777:0:22:72:544:702:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:distress  after  this  crisis  in  the  three  most  affected  countries,  Indonesia,  South  Korea  and  Thailand.  In  
19:540:44898:22:22:72:544:680:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:these,  only  one  Indonesian  bank  in  our  sample  is  nationalized.  Our  investigation  of  other  East  Asian,  
19:541:45016:22:22:72:544:658:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Latin  American,  and  East  European  countries’  banking  systems  also  reveals  no  substantial  changes  in  
19:542:45130:22:22:72:291:636:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:country-level controlling shareholder categories.  
19:543:45181:22:22:108:543:614:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Another obvious problem could be bank control changes during privatization episodes. We have 
19:544:45274:22:22:72:543:592:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:data on 283 bank privatizations from Megginson (2004), and work backwards from 2001 to explore how 
19:545:45373:22:22:72:542:570:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:these affect our data. For example, Italy’s Banco Nazionale del Lavoro is labeled widely held in our data, 
19:546:45480:22:22:72:542:548:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:but was state-controlled until November 1998. This exercise reveals 16 changes in bank control between 
19:547:45583:22:22:72:544:526:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:1993  and  2001  in  our  sample.  We  return  to  this  issue  below  by  directly  controlling  for  privatizations  in  
19:548:45706:22:22:72:256:504:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:recalculating our bank control measures.  
19:549:45748:22:22:108:542:482:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:These exercises suggest that country-level banking system control is likely to be highly persistent. 
19:550:45849:22:22:72:543:460:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Although this validates our use of 2001 banking system control measures, it also prevents us from using 
19:551:45953:22:22:72:545:438:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:changes  in  banking  system  control  for  identification.  We  must  therefore  contend  with  endogeneity  
19:552:46063:22:22:71:542:416:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:problems, such as reverse causality or latent factors affecting both control over countries’ banking sectors 
19:553:46172:22:22:71:375:394:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:and their economies’ performance. We return to these issues below.

20:570:46936:22:22:72:544:658:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:emerge.  First,  the  three  bank  control  indexes  sum  to  unity,  so  each  should  correlate  negatively  with  the  
20:571:47058:22:22:72:546:636:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:other   two   –   purely   as   an   algebraic   artifact.   However,   their   relative   magnitudes   are   informative   
20:572:47182:22:22:72:543:614:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:nonetheless.  Family  control  is  not  significantly  negatively  correlated  with  state  control,  but  widely  held  
20:573:47303:22:22:72:542:592:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:banks are significantly (p < 0.01) rarer wherever either state or family control is more prevalent. Thus, the 
20:574:47413:22:22:71:539:570:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:primary difference across countries seems to be widely held banks on the one hand versus state or family-
20:575:47518:22:22:71:208:548:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:controlled banks on the other.  
20:576:47550:22:22:107:543:526:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Second,  capital  allocation  efficiency  correlates  negatively  and  significantly  with  state-control  of  
20:577:47661:22:22:71:543:504:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:the banking system (1963-2003), as in Wurgler (2000). However, efficient capital allocation is positively 
20:578:47767:22:22:71:544:482:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:significantly  correlated  with  widely  held  banks  and  negatively  and  significantly,  if  measured  between  
20:579:47882:22:22:71:325:460:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:1993 and 2003, correlated with family-controlled banks.  
20:580:47939:22:22:107:543:438:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Third,  more  prevalent  family-control  over  banks  is  associated  with  more  non-performing  loans,  
20:581:48045:22:22:71:543:416:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:more  banking  crises,  slower  economic  growth,  slower  capital  accumulation,  and  worse  macroeconomic  
20:582:48155:22:22:71:543:394:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:volatility.  In  contrast,  a  more  widely  held  banking  system  correlates  with  fewer  non-performing  loans,  
20:583:48272:22:22:71:543:372:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:fewer banking crises, faster capital accumulation, and less macroeconomic volatility. A more thoroughly 
20:584:48376:22:22:71:545:350:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:state-controlled  banking  system  correlates  only  with  more  non-performing  loans  and  slower  capital

20:589:48649:22:22:72:542:240:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:state-controlled, and widely held. The figure shows clear general tendencies in the data, indicated by solid 
20:590:48758:22:22:72:543:218:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:lines; but surrounded by substantial scatter. This suggests other variables at work in the background. We 
20:591:48864:22:22:71:432:196:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:therefore turn to more formal multivariate tests to clarify the patterns in the data.

21:598:49224:22:22:72:544:636:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:across  either  1993-2003  or  1963-2003,  clearly  correlated  with  control  over  banking  systems.  Countries  
21:599:49339:22:22:72:544:614:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:with  more  widely  held  banking  systems  allocate  capital  more  efficiently.  Countries  that  entrust  their  
21:600:49455:22:22:72:451:592:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:banking systems to either families or the state exhibit less efficient capital allocation.

21:609:50056:22:22:71:543:394:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:more widely held banking system is significantly correlated with fewer non-performing loans; while more 
21:610:50160:22:22:71:540:372:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:predominantly state or family-controlled banking systems both correlate with more nonperforming loans.  
21:611:50264:22:22:107:543:350:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Next we test the relationship between bank control and the number of banking crises the country 
21:612:50360:22:22:71:543:328:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:experienced after 1993. Banking crises are more common  in  countries  whose  banking  systems  are  more

21:618:51004:22:22:71:545:196:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:banks  does  not  explain  2008  crisis,  which  began  in  the  United  States,  whose  banking  system  is

22:624:51585:0:22:72:544:702:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:positively  associated  with  family  control  over  banks  (p  =  0.01),  indicating  less  stable  economic  growth

22:629:52046:22:22:71:543:592:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:comparison, a one standard deviation increase in the fraction of banks controlled by the state corresponds 
22:630:52153:22:22:71:543:570:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:to 26% decrease in capital allocation efficiency (1963-2003) and 27% more nonperforming loans. These

25:718:60222:22:22:72:430:570:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:banks correlates only with more nonperforming loans and growth rate volatility.  
25:719:60303:22:22:108:543:548:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Obviously, instrumental variables cannot completely preclude reverse causality or missing latent

25:724:60608:22:22:72:543:438:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Our main results (Tables 5 and 6) pass a wide battery of robustness checks, in that alternative approaches 
25:725:60715:22:22:72:545:416:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:to  estimation  generate  qualitatively  similar  results,  by  which  we  mean  the  banking  system  control  
25:726:60827:22:22:71:544:394:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:measures  attract  the  same  patterns  of  signs  and  significance  as  in  the  tables.  Where  this  is  not  so,  we  
25:727:60950:22:22:71:544:372:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:describe  how  the  robustness  checks’  results  differ  from  those  shown  in  the  tables.  The  relationships  
25:728:61066:22:22:71:545:350:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:between  bank  control  measures  and  our  banking  crises  count  that  includes  2008  is  only  marginally  
25:729:61178:22:22:72:392:328:121:g_d0_f1:195:Times:significant in the tables, so we do not consider it in the robustness tests.  
25:730:61255:22:22:108:542:306:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Our results are unlikely to be driven by outliers. We check this using an iterative reweighted least

25:732:61476:22:22:72:543:262:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:converging. The algorithm does not converge for regressions explaining the number of bank crises, and so 
25:733:61581:22:22:72:542:240:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:cannot be applied to these. In all other cases, it converges. This exercise leads to a much stronger negative 
25:734:61691:22:22:72:543:218:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:correlation of family control with capital accumulation (p = 0.02); and also renders more state-controlled 
25:735:61798:22:22:72:545:196:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:banking  significantly  correlated  with  higher  growth  rate  volatility.  Widely  held  banking  systems  are  
25:736:61912:22:22:72:544:174:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:revealed  dampening  growth  rate  volatility  and  improving  capital  accumulation.  In  all  other  regressions,  
25:737:62029:22:22:72:382:152:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:controlling for outliers in this way yields qualitatively similar results.  
25:738:62105:22:22:108:545:130:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Our  economy  performance  variables  end  in  2003-2004.  Our  next  set  of  robustness  checks  
25:739:62204:22:22:72:543:108:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:ascertains  that  our  findings  are  robust  to  extending  this  time  window.  Since  the  Penn  World  Tables  and  
25:740:62324:22:0:72:544:86:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:UNIDO  data  are  made  available  with  a  lag  of  several  years,  we  cannot  extend  our  TFP  growth  rates,  
26:741:62443:0:22:72:542:702:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:capital accumulation rates, or Wurgler’s elasticity to windows after our bank control data. However, using 
26:742:62550:22:22:72:546:680:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:estimation  endpoints  different  from  those  used  in  the  tables  generates  qualitatively  similar  results  
26:743:62664:22:22:72:543:658:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:throughout.  Data  for  per  capita  GDP  growth  and  volatility,  and  for  nonperforming  loans,  are  available  
26:744:62781:22:22:72:543:636:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:through 2007 in the WDI database. We therefore reconstruct these variables using windows from 1993 to 
26:745:62883:22:22:72:543:614:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:2007,  a  window  extending  our  data  up  to  six  years  after  our  bank  control  cross  section.  Outlier  robust  
26:746:63004:22:22:71:345:592:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:regressions yield qualitatively similar results to those shown.  
26:747:63069:22:22:108:544:570:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:We  measure  banking  system  control  as  of  2001.  Above,  we  showed  that  the  banking  control  
26:748:63172:22:22:72:543:548:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:measures are highly persistent between 2001 and 2007 (by checking for all changes in bank control) and 
26:749:63275:22:22:72:543:526:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:before 2001 (by using bank privatization data to work backwards from 2001). However, we can do more 
26:750:63375:22:22:72:545:504:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:with  our  privatization  data  from  Megginson  (2004),  which  indicates  that  16  banks  in  our  sample  are  
26:751:63490:22:22:72:543:482:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:privatized:  6  become  family-controlled  and  10  become  widely  held.  In  the  tables,  we  count  these  banks  
26:752:63608:22:22:72:540:460:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:using their 2001 (post-privatization) control categories. An alternative approach is to calculate a duration-
26:753:63717:22:22:72:544:438:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:weighted measure of banking system control for 1993 through 2003. If a bank is state-controlled for the 
26:754:63821:22:22:72:543:416:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:five years from 1993 to 1998, and then sold to a family, which controls it through 2003, we say it is 50% 
26:755:63927:22:22:72:545:394:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:state-controlled  and  50%  family-controlled  when  tallying  up  our  country-level  bank  control  measures.  
26:756:64040:22:22:72:546:372:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:This  exercise  generates  qualitatively  similar  results  to  those  shown,  save  that  widely  held  banking  
26:757:64154:22:22:72:543:350:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:systems are now positively correlated with growth, negatively correlated with growth rate volatility, and 
26:758:64260:22:22:72:447:328:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:insignificant in explaining the efficiency of capital allocation in the shorter window.  
26:759:64349:22:22:108:542:306:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:We follow La Porta et al. (1999) and Caprio et al. (2007) in presuming the largest equity voting

26:761:64562:22:22:71:356:262:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:measures generates qualitatively similar results to those shown.  
26:762:64628:22:22:107:544:240:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:  Another  alternative  construction  of  our  bank  control  measures  would  use  different  weights.  We  
26:763:64737:22:22:71:544:218:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:calculate  country-level  bank  control  measures  weighting  banks  by  total  net  credit.  Credit  issued  is  a  
26:764:64854:22:22:71:543:196:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:plausible  gauge  of  the  importance  of  a  bank  as  a  capital  allocator;  but  others  are  possible.  We  therefore  
26:765:64978:22:22:71:544:174:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:reweight  banks  by  total  assets  and  reconstruct  our  bank  control  measures.  This  generates  qualitatively  
26:766:65095:22:22:71:545:152:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:similar  results  to  those  shown,  save  that  widely  held  banking  systems  now  correlate  negatively  with  
26:767:65210:22:22:71:533:130:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:growth volatility and lose significance in explaining capital allocation efficiency in the shorter window.  
26:768:65318:22:22:107:542:108:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1: We posit above that entrusting the governance of the banking system to wealthy business families 
26:769:65415:22:0:71:544:86:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:might  impede  efficient  capital  allocation  because  those  families  might  divert  capital  to  their  own  firms  
27:770:65538:0:22:72:543:702:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:and away from upstarts and competitors. These problems could arise even if the families that control the 
27:771:65643:22:22:72:544:680:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:banks  do  not  control  other  firms,  for  Faccio  (2006)  and  others  reveal  numerous  connections  between  
27:772:65757:22:22:72:544:658:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:wealthy  families.  However,  they  may  well  be  more  serious  where  the  families  that  control  banks  also  
27:773:65873:22:22:72:545:636:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:control  large  nonfinancial  corporations.  The  Orbis  dataset  identifies  other  companies  owned  by  our  
27:774:65985:22:22:72:543:614:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:banking  families.  We  augment  this  with  an  extensive  online  media  search  using  family  names  and  bank  
27:775:66101:22:22:72:545:592:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:names  to  verify  matches  in  Orbis  and  identify  other  firms  controlled  by  our  banking  families.  This  
27:776:66216:22:22:72:545:570:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:admittedly  crude  approach  probably  underestimates  the  non-financial  interests  of  these  families,  but  
27:777:66329:22:22:72:542:548:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:nonetheless confirms that 90% of the families that control banks in our data also control other firms. We 
27:778:66435:22:22:72:542:526:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:use this information to recalculate our bank control measures assuming banks controlled by families with 
27:779:66540:22:22:72:543:504:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:no other firms are equivalent to widely held banks. Under this definition, 100% of Mexican banks become 
27:780:66644:22:22:72:544:482:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:widely  held  –  a  call  many  students  of  the  Mexican  economy  might  find  low.  Rerunning  our  regressions  
27:781:66761:22:22:72:226:460:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:yields qualitatively similar results. 
27:782:66799:22:22:108:544:438:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:The  statistical  tests  in  all  our  regressions  employ  heteroskedasticity-consistent  standard  errors.

27:784:67024:22:22:72:333:394:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:allocation efficiency measure based on 1993 to 2003 data.

27:786:67188:22:22:72:542:350:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:observed. We therefore rerun regressions using these variables weighting observations by the inverses of 
27:787:67293:22:22:72:547:328:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:the  standard  errors  of  our  elasticity  estimates.  These  weighted  least  squares  regressions  generate  
27:788:67405:22:22:72:293:306:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:qualitatively similar results to those in the tables.  
27:789:67460:22:22:108:543:284:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:We can obtain data for only a few banks in some countries. If these have only a few banks, this is 
27:790:67559:22:22:72:543:262:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:not necessarily a problem; but if we are missing data for these countries, their banking control measures 
27:791:67665:22:22:72:543:240:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:may be estimated less precisely. We therefore repeat our tests after dropping the countries represented in 
27:792:67772:22:22:72:542:218:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:our data by fewer than three banks: Finland, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe. This exercise renders widely held

27:794:67984:22:22:72:542:174:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:correlated with capital accumulation; and leaves all our bank control measures insignificant in explaining

28:799:68442:0:22:72:543:702:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:control variables are commonly used in the economic growth literature; but others are sometimes added. 
28:800:68545:22:22:72:542:680:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:We therefore repeat the income growth regressions of Table 6 including other controls used in Beck et al.

28:807:69219:22:22:72:543:526:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:events, so further checking the broader generality of our findings requires extending our time period back 
28:808:69326:22:22:72:543:504:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f3:in time. We do this by counting all the crises covered in Demirguc-Kunt et al. (2006) plus Dell'Ariccia et 
28:809:69433:22:22:72:543:482:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f1:al.  (2008),  rather  than  just  those  dated  after  1993.  This  extends  our  window  back  to  1980.  We  perform  
28:810:69553:22:22:72:545:460:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:this  robustness  check  both  with  and  without  2008  crises  added  to  the  total  counts.  Both  generate  
28:811:69666:22:22:72:542:438:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:qualitatively similar results: family bank control is highly significant in explaining the number of banking 
28:812:69775:22:22:72:543:416:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:crises. For instance, when the 2008 crises is included, family bank control has a coefficient of 1.03 (p = 
28:813:69882:22:22:72:543:394:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:0.02).  Many factors contribute to financial crises (Allen & Gale 2007); however, this evidence supports 
28:814:69987:22:22:72:543:372:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:bank control being numbered among them (Saunders et al. 1990; Laeven & Levine 2009), at least in some 
28:815:70089:22:22:72:225:350:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:time periods and some countries.

28:818:70159:22:22:72:544:284:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Our  findings  above  are  consistent  with  family  control  over  banks  impairing  financial  system  efficiency  
28:819:70276:22:22:72:543:262:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:and thereby both slowing and destabilizing economic growth. This aligns with arguments that economies 
28:820:70378:22:22:71:544:240:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:are  subject  to  economic  entrenchment,  sometimes  called  crony  capitalism,  wherein  incumbent  business  
28:821:70490:22:22:71:542:218:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:leaders erect barriers to entry that lock in the advantageous (to them) status quo to the determinant of their 
28:822:70601:22:22:71:542:196:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:countries (Murphy et al. 1991, 1993; Shleifer & Vishny 1998b). Our findings also align with the thesis of 
28:823:70707:22:22:72:542:174:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Rajan & Zingales (2004) and its supporting country case studies (Haber et al. 2003; La Porta et al. 2003), 
28:824:70814:22:22:72:455:152:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:that this entrenchment can be effected by elite capture of countries’ financial systems.  
28:825:70904:22:22:108:543:130:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:But other explanations of our findings must also be considered.  For example, family-controlled 
28:826:71000:22:22:72:543:108:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:banks might simply be less competent capital allocators. Or, family-controlled banks might elevate social 
28:827:71106:22:0:72:545:86:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:goals,  such  as  equality,  above  economic  efficiency,  consistent  with  the  solidarity,  or  social  capital  
29:828:71225:0:22:72:544:702:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:strengthening,  advantages  attributed  to  family  businesses  by  e.g.  Lester  &  Cannella  (2006).  However,  
29:829:71339:22:22:72:544:680:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:both  of  these  seem  implausible  given  that  Caprio  et  al.  (2007)  find  higher  valuations  for  banks  with  
29:830:71457:22:22:72:184:658:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:controlling shareholders. 
29:831:71483:22:22:108:544:636:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:We  apply  Ockham’s  razor  by  testing  for  links  between  family-controlled  banking  systems  and  
29:832:71587:22:22:71:546:614:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:economy  characteristics  correlated  with  crony  capitalism.  First,  crony  capitalism  is  associated  with  
29:833:71700:22:22:71:542:592:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:extreme inequality.  If family bank control abets crony capitalism, it should therefore correlate negatively 
29:834:71809:22:22:71:542:570:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:with measures of equality.  Crony capitalism is also associated with high barriers to entry. Thus, if control 
29:835:71919:22:22:71:544:548:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:of  the  banking  system  alone  is  insufficient  to  achieve  crony  capitalism,  family  bank  control  should  be  
29:836:72038:22:22:71:543:526:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:positively correlated with barriers to entry. Family bank incompetence, in contrast, has no clear prediction 
29:837:72147:22:22:71:543:504:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:regarding these variables; and the solidarity explanation would presumably imply greater income equality 
29:838:72252:22:22:71:202:482:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:and equality of opportunity.

29:844:72520:22:22:71:543:350:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:families. In contrast, state-controlled banking systems significantly correlate with more egalitarianism in 
29:845:72628:22:22:71:328:328:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:income distributions, as do widely held banking systems.  
29:846:72686:22:22:108:543:306:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:The next two columns gauge economic inequality by the economic importance of each country’s 
29:847:72778:22:22:72:545:284:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:greatest  business  families,  as  assessed  by  Fogel  (2006).  Family-controlled  business  empires  are  more  
29:848:72892:22:22:72:477:262:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:important in countries whose banking systems are more extensively controlled by families.  
29:849:72983:22:22:108:544:240:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:  The  remaining  columns  use  various  measures  of  equality  of  opportunity.  Family  control  over  
29:850:73089:22:22:72:544:218:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:banks  correlates  negatively  with  PCs  per  thousand  people,  a  measure  of  the  breadth  of  access  to  new

29:852:73320:22:22:72:540:174:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:connections, and telephone lines per capita – generate qualitatively similar results (not reported). Family-
29:853:73428:22:22:72:543:152:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:controlled banks correlate with fewer, not more opportunities. Since these measures also likely correlate 
29:854:73534:22:22:72:544:130:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:with  middle  class  purchasing  power,  they  also  reinforce  our  finding,  based  on  Gini  coefficients,  that  
29:855:73651:22:0:72:374:108:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:family-controlled banking correlates with worse income inequality.  
30:856:73722:0:22:108:543:702:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:The last six columns relate banking system control to measures of barriers to entry directly due to 
30:857:73822:22:22:71:542:680:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:government  bureaucratic  procedures.  All  three  measures  –  the  number  of  procedures,  time  and cost

30:859:74044:22:22:71:543:636:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:negatively with widely held banking systems. In contrast, state control over banks is insignificant, except 
30:860:74152:22:22:71:332:614:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:for correlating with a higher cost of setting up a new firm.  
30:861:74214:22:22:107:543:592:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:These  findings  survive  the  battery  of  robustness  checks  enumerated  in  the  previous  section.  All  
30:862:74324:22:22:72:544:570:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:the  robustness  checks  used  above  generate  qualitatively  similar  results  to  those  shown  in  the  table  with  
30:863:74445:22:22:72:543:548:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:the following exceptions. If we restrict “family control” to mean control by tycoons or families who also 
30:864:74551:22:22:72:543:526:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:control other firms, family control remains significant except in regressions of the cost of starting a new 
30:865:74659:22:22:72:543:504:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:business and regressions controlling for privatizations of the number of procedures, the time required to

30:867:74871:22:22:72:546:460:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:to  estimate  the  exogenous  component  this  modified  family  banking  control  measure,  it  reasserts  
30:868:74979:22:22:72:385:438:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:significance throughout, save in regressions of the oligarchy measure.  
30:869:75051:22:22:108:543:416:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Family control correlates positively with inequality, regardless of which dimension of inequality 
30:870:75149:22:22:72:543:394:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:we measure.  Of course, correlations do not resolve causation; however correlations with third variables 
30:871:75254:22:22:72:543:372:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:relevant to one causal explanation and not others can further sharpen Ockham’s razor.  We interpret these 
30:872:75360:22:22:72:547:350:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:findings as reinforcing the plausibility of family control over banking systems reflecting crony capitalism.

30:875:75496:22:22:72:543:284:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:Banks  are  vital  intermediaries  allocating  capital  in  an  economy;  and  in  many  economies,  banks  are  the  
30:876:75614:22:22:72:543:262:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:only  intermediaries  available.  Who  controls  the  banks  therefore  matters.  Controlling  for  capital  market

30:878:75839:22:22:72:545:218:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:predominantly  by  tycoons  and  families  correlate  with  worse  economy-level  outcomes:  less  efficient  
30:879:75949:22:22:72:544:196:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:capital  allocation,  more  nonperforming  loans,  more  frequent  bank  crises,  greater  macro  volatility,  and  
30:880:76065:22:22:72:544:174:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:slower  income  and  productivity  growth  rates.  Of  course,  our  results  imply  neither  that  all  controlling  
30:881:76183:22:22:72:542:152:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:tycoons and families are entrenched nor that their control has these associations in all time periods and all

31:888:76864:22:22:72:542:636:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:starving entrants of capital. Since banks provide essential capital for new and small firms across countries
