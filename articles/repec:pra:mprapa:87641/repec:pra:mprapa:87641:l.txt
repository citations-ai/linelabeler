3:45:2034:14:25:277:325:682:12:Times:12:Times:A:Abstract 
3:46:2042:25:21:86:542:657:12:Times:12:Times:A:To overcome the limitations of the traditional approach which uses linear causality to examine 
3:47:2134:21:21:86:542:636:12:Times:12:Times:A:whether the supply-leading and demand-following theories hold. As certain countries will be 
3:48:2226:21:20:86:543:615:12:Times:12:Times:A:found not to follow the theory by using the traditional approach, this paper first suggests using 
3:49:2320:20:21:86:542:595:12:Times:12:Times:A:all the proxies of financial development and economic growth as well as both multivariate and 
3:50:2413:21:21:86:542:574:12:Times:12:Times:A:bivariate  linear  and  nonlinear  causality tests to  analyze  the relationship  between  financial 
3:51:2514:21:21:86:542:553:12:Times:12:Times:A:development  and  economic  growth. The  multivariate nonlinear test  not  only  takes  into 
3:52:2606:21:20:86:542:532:12:Times:12:Times:A:consideration  both  dependent  and  joint  effects  among  variables,  but is also  able  to  detect a 
3:53:2710:20:21:86:542:512:12:Times:12:Times:A:multivariate  nonlinear  deterministic  process  that  cannot  be  detected  by  using any linear 
3:54:2808:21:21:86:542:491:12:Times:12:Times:A:causality test.  We  find five more  countries  in  which  the supply-leading  hypothesis  and/or 
3:55:2905:21:20:86:543:470:12:Times:12:Times:A:demand-following hypothesis hold true than with the traditional approach. However, there is 
3:56:2995:20:21:86:542:450:12:Times:12:Times:A:still  one  country, Pakistan, for which  no linear or nonlinear  causality is found between  its 
3:57:3089:21:31:86:309:429:12:Times:12:Times:A:financial development and economic growth.  
3:58:3132:31:21:86:542:398:12:Times:12:Times:A:To overcome this limitation, this paper suggests including cointegration in the analysis. This 
3:59:3224:21:20:86:542:377:12:Times:12:Times:A:leads us to conclude that either supply-leading or demand-following hypotheses or both hold 
3:60:3315:20:21:86:543:357:12:Times:12:Times:A:for all  countries without  any  exception.  There  will  be  some types of relationships between 
3:61:3411:21:21:86:542:336:12:Times:12:Times:A:economic  growth  and  financial  development in  any  country such  that  either  they  move 
3:62:3505:21:20:86:542:315:12:Times:12:Times:A:together  or  economic  growth  causes  financial  development  or  financial  development  causes 
3:63:3604:20:21:86:543:295:12:Times:12:Times:A:economic  growth  without  any  exception. The  finding  in  our  paper  is may  be useful  for 
3:64:3697:21:21:86:543:274:12:Times:12:Times:A:governments, politicians, and other international institutions in their decision making process 
3:65:3793:21:31:86:371:253:12:Times:12:Times:A:for the development of the countries and reducing poverty.

4:74:4075:16:25:86:89:646:12:Times:12:Times:A: 
4:75:4075:25:21:72:542:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:Scholars and policy makers are interested in knowing whether financial development could lead 
4:76:4167:21:21:72:542:600:12:Times:12:Times:B:to economic  growth which  in  turn helps the  development  of  the  countries  and  reduces poverty. 
4:77:4266:21:20:72:543:579:12:Times:12:Times:B:The debate on the direction of the causality between financial development and economic growth 
4:78:4361:20:21:72:543:559:12:Times:12:Times:B:has been on-going since the 19th century. There are two major theories which explain the causal 
4:79:4454:21:21:72:543:538:12:Times:12:Times:B:relationship between financial development and economic growth: the demand-following theory 
4:80:4545:21:21:72:542:517:12:Times:12:Times:B:(Robinson, 1952) and the supply-leading theory (Schumpeter, 1934 and Patrick, 1966). The first 
4:81:4639:21:20:72:542:496:12:Times:12:Times:B:suggests  that  financial development will  follow economic growth, because when the  economy 
4:82:4732:20:21:72:543:476:12:Times:12:Times:B:grows, it generates new  demands  for financial services, and thus, the financial  system will 
4:83:4820:21:21:72:543:455:12:Times:12:Times:B:growth. On  the  other  hand,  the supply-leading theory suggests  that  financial development 
4:84:4913:21:20:72:542:434:12:Times:12:Times:B:promotes economic  growth, and thus, financial  development  has  a  positive  effect  on  economic 
4:85:5012:20:21:72:119:414:12:Times:12:Times:B:growth.1  
4:86:5020:21:21:86:89:393:12:Times:12:Times:A: 
4:87:5020:21:20:86:543:372:12:Times:12:Times:A:There  are  three  major  ways in  which the  financial  system  can  influence  economic  growth 
4:88:5117:20:21:72:542:352:12:Times:12:Times:B:(Patrick,  1966). First, by prompting changes  in  its  ownership  and  in  its  composition through 
4:89:5217:21:21:72:543:331:12:Times:12:Times:B:intermediation  among  various  types of  asset-holders.  Financial  institutions can  help  to  allocate 
4:90:5322:21:21:72:543:310:12:Times:12:Times:B:tangible  wealth  more  efficiently. Secondly,  financial  institutions encourage  a  more  efficient 
4:91:5424:21:20:72:543:289:12:Times:12:Times:B:allocation of new investment-additions to capital stock from savers and entrepreneurial investors, 
4:92:5521:20:21:72:543:269:12:Times:12:Times:B:by moving from relatively less to relatively more productive uses. Finally, financial institutions 
4:93:5617:21:21:72:543:248:12:Times:12:Times:B:can induce an  increase  in  the rate  of  accumulation  of  capital by  providing convenient  saving, 
4:94:5717:21:20:72:500:227:12:Times:12:Times:B:investment, and transaction services which increase incentives to save, invest, and work. 
4:95:5802:20:21:86:89:207:12:Times:12:Times:A: 
4:96:5802:21:21:86:542:186:12:Times:12:Times:A:However,  empirical studies by Demetriades  and  Hussein  (1996), Kar, et  al.  (2011),  Akbas 
4:97:5894:21:18:72:542:165:12:Times:12:Times:B:(2015), and others neither support the  supply-leading  hypothesis nor  demand-following  theory, 
4:98:5989:18:20:72:218:147:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:F:                                                           
4:99:6047:20:19:72:542:127:6:Times:9:g_d0_f9:F:1 Khan (2001) has also developed a theory for financial development based on the costs associated with the provision of external 
4:100:6175:19:15:72:542:108:9:g_d0_f9:9:g_d0_f9:F:finance  and  concluded  that  financial  development  reduces  the  costs  associated  with  the  provision  of  external  finance  and 
4:101:6312:15:0:72:213:93:9:g_d0_f9:9:Times:F:increases the rate of economic growth. 
5:102:6351:0:21:72:542:724:12:Times:12:Times:B:or  both. They use two  different proxies of  financial development to test  whether  there is  any 
5:103:6446:21:20:72:543:703:12:Times:12:Times:B:linear  causality  between  economic  growth  and  financial  development.  They  conclude  that the 
5:104:6547:20:21:72:543:683:12:Times:12:Times:B:supply-leading   hypothesis does   not   hold   if there   is   no   linear   causality   from financial 
5:105:6651:21:21:72:540:662:12:Times:12:Times:B:development to  economic  growth. Similar  tests  have  been  used  to  test  whether the demand-
5:106:6746:21:21:72:543:641:12:Times:12:Times:B:following theory holds true by testing whether there is no linear causality from economic growth 
5:107:6843:21:20:72:197:620:12:Times:12:Times:B:to financial development. 
5:108:6868:20:21:86:89:600:12:Times:12:Times:A: 
5:109:6868:21:21:86:542:579:12:Times:12:Times:A:There are two limitations to this approach. First, using a statistical test to test series of single 
5:110:6968:21:20:72:543:558:12:Times:12:Times:B:hypothesis  is  not  equivalent  to  testing those  hypotheses jointly.2 The  results  of  using  separate 
5:111:7073:20:21:72:542:538:12:Times:12:Times:B:tests  could  be unreliable (Fomby  et  al,  2012).  To circumvent  the  limitation,  in  this  paper  we 
5:112:7178:21:21:72:545:517:12:Times:12:Times:B:suggest to employ the multivariate linear Granger test (Bai, et al., 2010, 2011, 2018; Chow, et al., 
5:113:7279:21:21:72:543:496:12:Times:12:Times:B:2018) to examine the linear causal relation between financial development and economic growth. 
5:114:7372:21:20:72:543:475:12:Times:12:Times:B:The second problem  is  that a traditional  linear Granger  causality  test  may  fail  to  detect  the 
5:115:7475:20:21:72:543:455:12:Times:12:Times:B:nonlinear causal relationship between financial development and economic growth. As Granger 
5:116:7565:21:21:72:543:434:12:Times:12:Times:B:(1989)  mentions,  a real  world  is "almost certainly nonlinear”. Nonlinear relationships between 
5:117:7661:21:20:72:542:413:12:Times:12:Times:B:economic variables are widely reported in economic studies. For example, Hamilton (2011) and 
5:118:7752:20:21:72:542:393:12:Times:12:Times:B:Herrera, et al. (2011) argue that the relation between GDP growth and oil prices is nonlinear and 
5:119:7847:21:21:72:542:372:12:Times:12:Times:B:Chiou-Wei, et al. (2008) report the nonlinear relationship between economic growth and energy 
5:120:7941:21:20:72:542:351:12:Times:12:Times:B:consumption. The  debate  on  the  direction  of  causality  between  financial  development  and 
5:121:8038:20:21:72:542:331:12:Times:12:Times:B:economic growth have ignored the nonlinear behavior which could be caused by structural break. 
5:122:8133:21:21:72:542:310:12:Times:12:Times:B:In  addition  to  the structural  break  effect,  non-constant marginal  effect, and  threshold regime 
5:123:8233:21:21:72:543:289:12:Times:12:Times:B:effect may  also  make  the  causal  relationship  between  financial  development  and  economic 
5:124:8330:21:20:72:542:268:12:Times:12:Times:B:growth   become   nonlinear.   Studies   that   explicitly   test   for   causality   between   financial 
5:125:8436:20:21:72:543:248:12:Times:12:Times:B:development  and  real  GDP  (Rogalski,  1978;  Smirlock  and  Starks,  1988;  Jain  and  Joh,  1988, 
5:126:8538:21:21:72:543:227:12:Times:12:Times:B:Antoniewicz, 1992) rely exclusively on traditional linear Granger causality tests. Although such 
5:127:8635:21:20:72:543:206:12:Times:12:Times:B:tests have high power in uncovering linear causal relations, their power against nonlinear causal 
5:128:8732:20:16:72:542:186:12:Times:12:Times:B:relations can be low (Baek and Brock, 1992 and Hiemstra and Jones, 1993). Under this situation, 
5:129:8827:16:21:72:218:170:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f6:F:                                                           
5:130:8885:21:21:72:542:149:6:Times:10:g_d0_f9:F:2 For example, testing whether economic growth linear causes proxies 1 and 2 of financial development separately 
5:131:8994:21:17:72:542:128:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:(or proxies 1 and 2 of financial development linear cause economic growth separately) is significantly different from 
5:132:9109:17:17:72:542:111:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:testing whether economic growth linear causes proxies 1 and 2 of financial development jointly (or proxies 1 and 2 
5:133:9220:17:0:72:338:94:10:g_d0_f9:10:Times:F:of financial development linear cause economic growth jointly).    
6:134:9287:0:21:72:542:724:12:Times:12:Times:B:a nonlinear model may represent the proper way to model the real world that is "almost certainly 
6:135:9384:21:20:72:543:703:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times:B:nonlinear”  as  Granger  (1989)  argues.  For  this  reason,  we  employ a  multivariate  nonlinear 
6:136:9483:20:21:72:543:683:12:Times:12:Times:B:Granger causality test (Bai,  et  al., 2010,  2011,  2018; Chow,  et  al., 2018) to  investigate  the 
6:137:9583:21:21:72:542:662:12:Times:12:Times:B:presence of nonlinear causal relations between financial development and economic growth. To 
6:138:9673:21:21:72:542:641:12:Times:12:Times:B:test  whether  both demand-following  supply-leading theories  hold  true,  in  this paper  we  also 
6:139:9774:21:20:72:542:620:12:Times:12:Times:B:suggest the use of a cointegration  technique  and  examine  whether  there  is  any  cointegration 
6:140:9873:20:21:72:543:600:12:Times:12:Times:B:between financial development and economic growth. If there is cointegration between financial 
6:141:9967:21:21:72:543:579:12:Times:12:Times:B:development and economic growth, then financial development and economic growth will cause 
6:142:10055:21:20:72:318:558:12:Times:12:Times:B:each other. We provide explanation in Section 5.1. 
6:143:10104:20:21:86:89:538:12:Times:12:Times:A: 
6:144:10104:21:21:86:542:517:12:Times:12:Times:A:Using  data  from  14 developing  countries (Brazil,  Chile,  China,  Costa  Rica,  El  Salvador, 
6:145:10200:21:21:72:542:496:12:Times:12:Times:B:Guatemala, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, Peru, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Turkey), this 
6:146:10296:21:20:72:543:475:12:Times:12:Times:B:investigation  is  among  the  first,  if  not  the  first, to  use cointegration,  and both bivariate  and 
6:147:10401:20:21:72:542:455:12:Times:12:Times:B:multivariate  linear and  nonlinear Granger  causality  tests  to  examine the  relationship  between 
6:148:10500:21:21:72:543:434:12:Times:12:Times:B:financial development and economic growth. Our findings from both the Johansen cointegration 
6:149:10592:21:20:72:542:413:12:Times:12:Times:B:and Engle–Granger   two-step   cointegration   tests suggest   that financial   development and 
6:150:10688:20:21:72:542:393:12:Times:12:Times:B:economic  growth are moving positively together in  some  countries  but  not  in  others, and  thus, 
6:151:10789:21:21:72:542:372:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  demand-following  and  the  supply-leading theories  may  hold true in  some developing 
6:152:10882:21:20:72:542:351:12:Times:12:Times:B:countries  but  not  in  others. To  test whether the  demand-following  and  the  supply-leading 
6:153:10978:20:21:72:543:331:12:Times:12:Times:B:theories hold true formally for the developing countries studied in this paper, both bivariate and 
6:154:11075:21:21:72:543:310:12:Times:12:Times:B:multivariate  linear and  nonlinear causality tests are  used.  The results  of  our causality tests 
6:155:11172:21:21:72:542:289:12:Times:12:Times:B:conclude  that  both demand-following  and  the  supply-leading theories  hold  for  most  of  the 
6:156:11271:21:20:72:543:268:12:Times:12:Times:B:countries  studied  in  our  paper  except Costa  Rica, Guatemala, Pakistan, South  Africa.  Among 
6:157:11370:20:21:72:543:248:12:Times:12:Times:B:these, the demand-following theory is  only  valid for  both Costa  Rica and South  Africa, while 
6:158:11465:21:21:72:540:227:12:Times:12:Times:B:only the  supply-leading theory  holds  for Guatemala,  and  neither demand-following nor supply-
6:159:11562:21:20:72:543:206:12:Times:12:Times:B:leading theories hold for Pakistan. We note that the inclusion of nonlinearity in testing both the 
6:160:11661:20:21:72:543:186:12:Times:12:Times:B:demand-following  and  the  supply-leading hypotheses  is  important because  if  the  nonlinear  test 
6:161:11762:21:21:72:542:165:12:Times:12:Times:B:had  not  been  used,  one  could  not  find  out  that the supply-leading theory  does  hold  for  Turkey 
6:162:11869:21:21:72:542:144:12:Times:12:Times:B:and the  demand-following theory  does  hold  for Brazil, India, South  Africa,  and Sri  Lanka. It 
6:163:11969:21:20:72:546:123:12:Times:12:Times:B:could allow us to test the overall significant of nonlinear causality between two pairs of variables. 
6:164:12070:20:0:72:543:103:12:Times:12:Times:B:Using  the  multivariate  tests,  we  find  that  economic  growth  does  cause  financial  development, 
7:165:12175:0:21:72:540:724:12:Times:12:Times:B:and  financial  development  does  cause  economic  growth  which  is  consistent  with  the  demand-
7:166:12276:21:20:72:331:703:12:Times:12:Times:B:following hypothesis and supply-leading hypothesis.  
7:167:12328:20:21:86:89:683:12:Times:12:Times:A: 
7:168:12328:21:21:86:543:662:12:Times:12:Times:A:However, despite using  both  (multivariate)  linear  and  nonlinear  causality to  study  the 
7:169:12422:21:21:72:542:641:12:Times:12:Times:B:causality  relationship  between  financial  development  and  economic  growth, there  is  still  one 
7:170:12525:21:20:72:543:620:12:Times:12:Times:B:country, Pakistan,   which displays no linear or nonlinear   causality   between   its financial 
7:171:12618:20:21:72:542:600:12:Times:12:Times:B:development  and  economic  growth. One  may  not  believe that  there  is  no  relationship  between 
7:172:12720:21:21:72:543:579:12:Times:12:Times:B:financial development  and  economic  growth  in  any  country. To  solve  this  problem, we 
7:173:12811:21:20:72:543:558:12:Times:12:Times:B:recommend scholars and  practitioners use both cointegration and (multivariate)  linear  and 
7:174:12902:20:21:72:543:538:12:Times:12:Times:B:nonlinear  causality  to study  the  causality  relationship  between  financial  development  and 
7:175:13000:21:21:72:540:517:12:Times:12:Times:B:economic  growth. In  doing so,  our  findings conclude  that either supply-leading  or  demand-
7:176:13095:21:21:72:543:496:12:Times:12:Times:B:following hypotheses or both hold for all countries without any exception. This is a key finding 
7:177:13190:21:20:72:543:475:12:Times:12:Times:B:never presented in  any paper  to  date,  suggesting  that our  paper  is  the  first  paper  that  find  out 
7:178:13298:20:21:72:542:455:12:Times:12:Times:B:either supply-leading or demand-following hypotheses or both hold for all countries without any 
7:179:13392:21:21:72:543:434:12:Times:12:Times:B:exception.  One could, thereafter, conclude that there is always a relationship between economic 
7:180:13487:21:20:72:543:413:12:Times:12:Times:B:growth  and  financial  development  such  that  either  they  move  together  or  economic  growth 
7:181:13587:20:21:72:543:393:12:Times:12:Times:B:causes  financial  development  or  financial  development  causes  economic  growth  without  any 
7:182:13686:21:21:72:542:372:12:Times:12:Times:B:exception. The finding in our paper is useful for governments, politicians, and other international 
7:183:13783:21:20:72:543:351:12:Times:12:Times:B:institutions in their decision-making processes for the development of the countries and reducing 
7:184:13879:20:21:72:114:331:12:Times:12:Times:B:poverty.

7:186:13887:21:21:107:542:289:12:Times:12:Times:A:This  paper  has  the  following  structure.  After  a  brief  introduction  and  overview  in this 
7:187:13987:21:20:72:546:268:12:Times:12:Times:B:section,  Section  2  discusses the  literature  of  financial  development  and  economic  growth.  
7:188:14088:20:21:72:543:248:12:Times:12:Times:B:Section  3  presents  the  tests used  in  this  paper  including  the multivariate linear  and  nonlinear

7:190:14299:21:20:72:543:206:12:Times:12:Times:B:discusses  their  interpretations  for  the developing  economies. The  conclusions  are  presented  in

8:195:14452:0:21:72:542:724:12:Times:12:Times:B:It is interesting to analyze the relationship between financial development and economic growth 
8:196:14547:21:20:72:542:703:12:Times:12:Times:B:in  developing  countries,  especially in countries with  high  levels  of  poverty.   It  is important  to 
8:197:14654:20:21:72:543:683:12:Times:12:Times:B:understand whether financial development will lead to economic  growth or verse versa in these 
8:198:14749:21:21:72:542:662:12:Times:12:Times:B:countries.  This  will  help governments,  politicians,  and  other  international  institutions  to  adopt 
8:199:14857:21:21:72:543:641:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  best  polices  to  help  the  development  of  the country and  reduce  poverty. To  understand  the 
8:200:14961:21:20:72:470:620:12:Times:12:Times:B:issue better, we first discuss the supply-leading and demand-following hypothesis. 
8:201:15043:20:14:72:74:600:11:g_d0_f12:11:g_d0_f12:F: 
8:202:15043:14:14:72:350:586:11:g_d0_f12:12:Times:B:2.1 Supply-leading and demand-following hypotheses  
8:203:15092:14:14:72:75:572:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
8:204:15092:14:20:72:543:558:12:Times:12:Times:B:The  supply-leading  hypothesis  hypothesizes  that  money  related  advancement  is  the driver of 
8:205:15191:20:21:72:543:538:12:Times:12:Times:B:financial  development. Supply  leading  has  two  functions:  to  transfer resources  from  the 
8:206:15287:21:21:72:543:517:12:Times:12:Times:B:traditional, low-growth sectors to the modern high-growth sectors and to promote and stimulate 
8:207:15382:21:21:72:543:496:12:Times:12:Times:B:an  entrepreneurial  response  in  these  modern  sectors  (Patrick, 1966).  This  implies  that  the 
8:208:15483:21:20:72:542:475:12:Times:12:Times:B:creation  of  financial  institutions  and  their  services  occurs before  there  is  an  actual demand  for 
8:209:15592:20:21:72:542:455:12:Times:12:Times:B:them. Thus, the availability of financial services stimulates the demand for these services by the 
8:210:15690:21:31:72:335:434:12:Times:12:Times:B:entrepreneurs in the modern, growth-inducing sectors. 
8:211:15743:31:20:72:542:403:12:Times:12:Times:B:On the other hand, the demand-following hypothesis hypothesizes that productive and successful 
8:212:15838:20:21:72:543:383:12:Times:12:Times:B:utilization  of economy leads  to financial development. To  support  the  demand-following 
8:213:15929:21:21:72:543:362:12:Times:12:Times:B:hypothesis,  Robinson  (1952)  argues that  "where  venture  drives,  finance  follows" and suggests 
8:214:16028:21:20:72:542:341:12:Times:12:Times:B:that  financial  development  is  simply a response  to  the  greater  demand  for  financial  services  as 
8:215:16135:20:31:72:196:321:12:Times:12:Times:B:the real economy grows.  
8:216:16159:31:21:72:542:290:12:Times:12:Times:B:Murinde  and  Eng  (1994)  and  others  argue that  monetary  segment leads  development  instead  of 
8:217:16260:21:21:72:543:269:12:Times:12:Times:B:following it.  They argue that the expectation in embracing money related to transforming system 
8:218:16356:21:20:72:542:248:12:Times:12:Times:B:and the desire in acquiring cash identified with changing the framework is a win situation in the 
8:219:16453:20:21:72:543:228:12:Times:12:Times:B:case of economies which are driven by a supply-leading approach to improved adaptation of the 
8:220:16546:21:21:72:542:207:12:Times:12:Times:B:economy  and  financial  institutions and to  deal  with  enhanced  adjustment  of  the  economy  and 
8:221:16647:21:20:72:543:186:12:Times:12:Times:B:money  related  foundations (Murinde  and Eng, 1994). It  is  fundamental for policy  makers to  be 
8:222:16742:20:21:72:543:166:12:Times:12:Times:B:ready  to inject  funds into  some factors  that  could  be  equipped  as components  of  monetary 
8:223:16840:21:21:72:542:145:12:Times:12:Times:B:strategy, as  indicated  by  (Banerjee  and  Ghosh,  1998), on  the  grounds  that  national  financial 
8:224:16942:21:0:72:543:124:12:Times:12:Times:B:strategies  will  support  a  supply-driven analysis  as  a  budgetary reconstruction  is  being  well 
9:225:17046:0:21:72:543:724:12:Times:12:Times:B:planned.   The  reactant effect of  money  related  rebuilding  in  instigating  financial  development 
9:226:17148:21:31:72:308:703:12:Times:12:Times:B:was affirmed by past research done in East Asia.

9:230:17240:14:21:72:543:614:12:Times:12:Times:B:Monetary  development  makes  cash  related  assets  challenging  for  the  fiscal  division  to  provide 
9:231:17346:21:20:72:542:593:12:Times:12:Times:B:refined  implementation. Achieving  economies  of  scale  on  the  advancement  in  securing  costs 
9:232:17446:20:21:72:543:573:12:Times:12:Times:B:drew  within  the  appraisal  of  firms,  administrators,  and  the  monetary  circumstances  upgrading 
9:233:17550:21:21:72:543:552:12:Times:12:Times:B:resource circulation is one of the critical components of the cash related market as to adjust the 
9:234:17649:21:20:72:543:531:12:Times:12:Times:B:risk.  The  financial  system  prompts  improvement  by  encouraging  trade,  which  in  this  manner 
9:235:17751:20:21:72:542:511:12:Times:12:Times:B:propels interest and involuntary development (Adeyeye, et  al., 2015).  In light of other writings, 
9:236:17848:21:21:72:396:490:12:Times:12:Times:B:finance if utilized productively and viably can add to development.

9:238:17915:20:21:72:543:449:12:Times:12:Times:B:The evidence in the literature supports the supply-leading hypothesis only when broad monetary 
9:239:18010:21:21:72:543:428:12:Times:12:Times:B:aggregates  and  a  monetization  variable  are  used  as  surrogates  for  financial  development. 
9:240:18109:21:21:72:543:407:12:Times:12:Times:B:Murinde and Eng (1994) conclude that there is a plausible case for those economies which intend 
9:241:18202:21:20:72:542:386:12:Times:12:Times:B:to adopt a financial restructuring strategy driven by a supply-leading policy stance that involves 
9:242:18301:20:21:72:386:366:12:Times:12:Times:B:enhanced monetization of the economy and bank intermediation.

9:246:18564:21:21:72:543:283:12:Times:12:Times:B:sector  had  a  positive  impact  on  economic  growth in  the  long  run. Analyzing the  role  of  stock 
9:247:18668:21:20:72:543:262:12:Times:12:Times:B:market development on economic growth in Africa, Ngare et al. (2014) find that countries with 
9:248:18761:20:21:72:542:242:12:Times:12:Times:B:stock  markets  tend  to  grow  faster  compared to countries  without  stock  markets, inferring that 
9:249:18863:21:21:72:411:221:12:Times:12:Times:B:stock market development has a positive effect on economic growth.

9:251:18929:21:20:86:543:179:12:Times:12:Times:A:Moreover,  analyzing  109  developing  and  industrial  countries  from  1960  to  1994, Calderón 
9:252:19026:20:21:72:542:159:12:Times:12:Times:B:and  Liu  (2003) find  that  financial development  generally  leads  to  economic  growth.  They  also 
9:253:19129:21:21:72:542:138:12:Times:12:Times:B:find  that  Granger  causality  from  financial  development  to  economic  growth  and  the  Granger 
9:254:19231:21:20:72:543:117:12:Times:12:Times:B:causality  from  economic  growth  to  financial  development  coexist.  They  argue  that financial 
9:255:19331:20:0:72:542:97:12:Times:12:Times:B:deepening contributes more to the causal relationships in developing countries than in industrial 
10:256:19430:0:21:72:542:724:12:Times:12:Times:B:countries. Investigating the  relationship  between  financial  development  and  economic  growth 
10:257:19527:21:20:72:542:703:12:Times:12:Times:B:from   30   developing   countries   for   the   period   1970–1999, Al-Yousif   (2012)   finds   strong 
10:258:19631:20:21:72:543:683:12:Times:12:Times:B:bidirectional  causality  between financial  development  and  economic  growth. Examining 52 
10:259:19723:21:21:72:542:662:12:Times:12:Times:B:middle-income countries over the 1980–2008 period, Samargandi et al. (2015) find that there is 
10:260:19818:21:21:72:542:641:12:Times:12:Times:B:an inverted U-shaped relationship between finance and growth in the long run but no significant 
10:261:19914:21:20:72:542:620:12:Times:12:Times:B:relationship in the short term. Using a bootstrap  panel  causality  test to analyze the  causality

10:263:20103:21:21:72:542:579:12:Times:12:Times:B:Akbas   (2015) finds a   weak   causal   relationship   between   economic   growth   and   financial 
10:264:20204:21:20:72:542:558:12:Times:12:Times:B:development,  with the exception  of  Turkey.  Zhang  et  al.  (2012)  find  a  positive  and  statistically 
10:265:20313:20:21:72:543:538:12:Times:12:Times:B:significant  monotonic  relationship  between  economic  and  financial  development  in  China  and 
10:266:20414:21:21:72:543:517:12:Times:12:Times:B:Hassan  et  al.  (2011)  find  a  positive  relationship  between  financial  development  and  economic 
10:267:20519:21:21:72:542:496:12:Times:12:g_d0_f9:B:growth in developing countries but only on a long-term basis. Deltuvaitė and Sinevičienė (2014) 
10:268:20615:21:20:72:543:475:12:Times:12:Times:B:analyze  73  different  economies  between  1975–2011  and find  a  positive  and  statistically 
10:269:20711:20:21:72:543:455:12:Times:12:Times:B:significant monotonic relationship between economic and financial development. However, Kar 
10:270:20803:21:21:72:542:434:12:Times:12:Times:B:et al. (2011) and Menyah et al. (2014) conclude that there is no clear consensus on the direction 
10:271:20898:21:20:72:393:413:12:Times:12:Times:B:of causality between financial development and economic growth. 
10:272:20961:20:21:86:89:393:12:Times:12:Times:A: 
10:273:20961:21:21:86:543:372:12:Times:12:Times:A:Gregorio  and  Guidotti  (1995)  describe that  the  main  channel  of  transmission  from  financial 
10:274:21062:21:20:72:543:351:12:Times:12:Times:B:development  to  growth  is  the  efficiency,  rather than  the  volume,  of  investment. Hsueh  et  al. 
10:275:21166:20:21:72:542:331:12:Times:12:Times:B:(2013)  find  that  the  direction  of  causality  between  financial  development  and  economic  growth 
10:276:21272:21:21:72:542:310:12:Times:12:Times:B:is  sensitive  to  the  financial  development  variables  used.  Herwartz  and Walle (2014) argue that 
10:277:21375:21:21:72:540:289:12:Times:12:Times:B:the impact of finance on economic development  is generally stronger in high-income than low-
10:278:21468:21:20:72:543:268:12:Times:12:Times:B:income  economies. Base on  67  studies  that investigate the  effect  of  financial  development  on 
10:279:21567:20:21:72:542:248:12:Times:12:Times:B:economic   growth, Valickova   et   al.   (2015) conclude   that   studies which do   not   address 
10:280:21665:21:21:72:373:227:12:Times:12:Times:B:endogeneity tend to overstate the effect of finance on growth.

10:283:21828:21:21:72:540:165:12:Times:12:Times:B:and  trade  openness  in  China, inferring the existence of both ‘demand-following’ and ‘supply-
10:284:21924:21:21:72:542:144:12:g_d0_f9:12:Times:B:leading’  hypotheses, concluding  that Chinese  policymakers  should  further  increase  financial

11:295:22385:21:20:72:542:558:12:Times:12:Times:B:International  Monetary  Fund. Our  criteria  for  including  a  country  in  our study  is  that  the 
11:296:22488:20:21:72:543:538:12:Times:12:Times:B:developing country has a  population exceeding one million in 2017 and the database has enough 
11:297:22580:21:21:72:192:517:12:Times:12:Times:B:data in all the variables.  
11:298:22607:21:21:86:89:496:12:Times:12:Times:A: 
11:299:22607:21:20:86:542:475:12:Times:12:Times:A:It is difficult to directly measure both financial development and economic growth. Economic 
11:300:22699:20:21:72:543:455:12:Times:12:Times:B:growth is commonly measured using real GDP per capita, see for example Gelb (1989), Roubini 
11:301:22788:21:21:72:542:434:12:Times:12:Times:B:and Sala-i-Martin (1992), King and Levine (1993), and Demetriades and Hussein (1996). Similar 
11:302:22881:21:20:72:543:413:12:Times:12:Times:B:to  these  studies,  a logarithm  of  real  GDP  per  capita is used to proxy  economic  growth and has 
11:303:22983:20:21:72:164:393:12:Times:12:Times:B:been denoted as Y. 
11:304:22999:21:21:86:89:372:12:Times:12:Times:A: 
11:305:22999:21:20:86:542:351:12:Times:12:Times:A:A  common  practice  to measure  financial  development (Gelb,  1989  and  King  and  Levine, 
11:306:23091:20:21:72:542:331:12:Times:12:Times:B:1993) is to use a ratio of some broad measures of the money stock to the level of nominal GDP. 
11:307:23183:21:21:72:543:310:12:Times:12:Times:B:However, Demetriades  and  Hussein  (1996)  argue  that  this  type  of  ratio  may  reflect  more 
11:308:23281:21:21:72:543:289:12:Times:12:Times:B:extensive use of currency rather than an increase in the volume of bank deposits. To circumvent 
11:309:23377:21:20:72:543:268:12:Times:12:Times:B:the limitation, they recommend excluding currency in circulation from the broad money stock. In 
11:310:23472:20:21:72:542:248:12:Times:12:Times:B:this  paper  we  follow  their  recommendation and use the  logarithm  of  the  ratio  of  bank  deposit 
11:311:23576:21:21:72:519:227:12:Times:12:Times:B:liabilities to nominal GDP as the first proxy for financial development and represented as M.

11:313:23668:20:21:86:543:186:12:Times:12:Times:A:In  addition, academics  (Demetriades  and  Hussein,  1996) suggest using the  ratio  of  bank 
11:314:23762:21:21:72:543:165:12:Times:12:Times:B:claims on the private sector to nominal GDP to measure the financial development in a country. 
11:315:23856:21:21:72:543:144:12:Times:12:Times:B:According to Demetriades and Hussein (1996), this ratio provides more direct information on the 
11:316:23951:21:20:72:543:123:12:Times:12:Times:B:extension of  financial  intermediation  and  yield  additional  insights  pertaining  to  the  hypothesis. 
11:317:24057:20:0:72:543:103:12:Times:12:Times:B:Thus, in  this  paper  we also follow  their  recommendation and use  the  logarithm  of  the  ratio  of 
12:318:24163:0:21:72:543:724:12:Times:12:Times:B:claims  on  private  sector  to  nominal  GDP as  the second proxy  for  financial  development and

12:323:24293:21:30:72:75:620:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
12:324:24293:30:21:72:543:590:12:Times:12:Times:B:In the literature on the subject of the  relationship between financial development and economic 
12:325:24389:21:21:72:543:569:12:Times:12:Times:B:growth,  academics, such  as Horng,  et  al.  (2012) are  interested  in testing  the  following  two 
12:326:24490:21:31:72:131:548:12:Times:12:Times:B:hypotheses: 
12:327:24501:31:31:72:385:517:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times:B:H01: financial development does not cause economic growth, and 
12:328:24562:31:31:72:364:486:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times:B:H02: economic growth does not cause financial development. 
12:329:24619:31:21:72:542:455:12:Times:12:Times:B:Academics  and  practitioners, such  as Horng,  et  al.  (2012) and Fan, et  al. (2018) employ linear 
12:330:24716:21:21:72:543:434:12:Times:12:Times:B:causality to study whether there is any unidirectional or bidirectional causality between financial 
12:331:24816:21:31:72:319:413:12:Times:12:Times:B:development and economic growth. Thus, they set  
12:332:24864:31:21:72:532:382:12:Times:12:Times:B: H01′: financial development does not cause economic growth if there is no linear causality from 
12:333:24958:21:30:72:283:361:12:Times:12:Times:B:financial development to economic growth. 
12:334:24999:30:31:72:223:331:12:Times:12:Times:B:However, in this paper, we set  
12:335:25030:31:22:72:538:300:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times:B:H01: financial development does not cause economic growth if there is no linear and no nonlinear 
12:336:25125:22:21:72:532:278:12:Times:12:Times:B:causality from financial development to economic growth. Similarly, definitions are set for H02′ 
12:337:25220:21:31:72:112:257:12:Times:12:Times:B:and H02. 
12:338:25228:31:21:72:543:226:12:Times:12:Times:B:To  our  knowledge, this  is  the  first  paper  to  employ (multivariate) linear  causality  to  study 
12:339:25331:21:21:72:543:205:12:Times:12:Times:B:whether there is any unidirectional or bidirectional causality between financial development and 
12:340:25428:21:20:72:543:184:12:Times:12:Times:B:economic  growth, and also  employ (multivariate) nonlinear  causality  to  study  whether  there  is 
12:341:25528:20:21:72:543:164:12:Times:12:Times:B:any  unidirectional  or  bidirectional  nonlinear  causality  between  financial  development  and 
12:342:25627:21:21:72:543:143:12:Times:12:Times:B:economic  growth and  whether  there  is  any multivariate  linear  and  nonlinear  causality  between 
12:343:25729:21:20:72:542:122:12:Times:12:Times:B:financial  development  and  economic  growth. Ascertaining whether financial  development and 
12:344:25822:20:0:72:542:102:12:Times:12:Times:B:economic growth are cointegrated is an important piece of information. If financial development 
13:345:25918:0:21:72:540:724:12:Times:12:Times:B:and economic  growth are  cointegrated, we  conjecture  that both demand-following  and  supply-
13:346:26013:21:20:72:542:703:12:Times:12:Times:B:leading  theories  hold  so  that financial  development and economic  growth move positively 
13:347:26105:20:32:72:398:683:12:Times:12:Times:B:together. Thus, in this paper, we examine the following hypothesis: 
13:348:26172:32:21:72:460:651:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times:B:H03: financial development and economic growth are not positively cointegrated. 
13:349:26249:21:30:72:75:630:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
13:350:26249:30:21:72:542:600:12:Times:12:Times:B:There  are certain studies which  have  used cointegration  in  some  related  work.  For  example, 
13:351:26346:21:21:72:543:579:12:Times:12:Times:B:Samargandi, et al. (2015) use pooled mean group estimations in a dynamic heterogeneous panel 
13:352:26439:21:20:72:543:558:12:Times:12:Times:B:setting  and demonstrate that  there  is  an  inverted  U-shaped  relationship  between  finance  and 
13:353:26540:20:21:72:543:538:12:Times:12:Times:B:growth in the long run. However, as far as we know, no paper has used the same variable settings 
13:354:26636:21:21:72:542:517:12:Times:12:Times:B:in the cointegration relationship we are analyzing in this paper. Thus, we believe our paper is the 
13:355:26734:21:21:72:542:496:12:Times:12:Times:B:first  paper  to  use  cointegration  to  examine the  relationship  between financial  development and 
13:356:26838:21:20:72:540:475:12:Times:12:Times:B:economic growth, which, in turn could lead to conclude whether demand-following and supply-
13:357:26929:20:21:72:542:455:12:Times:12:Times:B:leading  theories  hold. In  this  paper  we  only  conjecture  that if financial  development and 
13:358:27026:21:21:72:542:434:12:Times:12:Times:B:economic  growth are  cointegrated positively,  then  both demand-following  and  supply-leading 
13:359:27121:21:20:72:543:413:12:Times:12:Times:B:theories  hold  for  the  countries.  However, if financial  development and economic  growth are 
13:360:27218:20:21:72:542:393:12:Times:12:Times:B:indeed cointegrated, does it lead  to  conclude  that  both demand-following  and  supply-leading 
13:361:27314:21:21:72:543:372:12:Times:12:Times:B:theories hold for the countries? Further development in economic theory is needed to support this 
13:362:27412:21:31:72:126:351:12:Times:12:Times:B:argument.

13:364:27422:20:21:72:542:300:12:Times:12:Times:B:In the following  subsections,  we  will  discuss cointegration  and linear  and  nonlinear  causality 
13:365:27524:21:21:72:543:279:12:Times:12:Times:B:tests  to  analyze  the  relationship  between  financial  development  and  economic  growth  in 
13:366:27622:21:20:72:484:258:12:Times:12:Times:B:developing countries. We first discuss the cointegration approach in next subsection.

13:370:27728:20:21:72:543:183:12:Times:12:Times:B:As mentioned in Section 3.1 M,  D,  and Y  have been designated to be the logarithms of the ratio 
13:371:27819:21:21:72:542:162:12:Times:12:Times:B:of bank deposit liabilities to nominal GDP (M), the ratio of claims on private sector to nominal 
13:372:27916:21:21:72:543:141:12:Times:12:Times:B:GDP, and  real  GDP  per  capita,  respectively. If  all the variables  (M, D, and Y) are  integrated  in 
13:373:28020:21:20:72:543:120:12:Times:12:Times:B:degree  one, academics  and  practitioners  will  be  interested  in  examining  whether  there  is  any 
13:374:28125:20:0:72:542:100:12:Times:12:Times:B:cointegration  relationship  among  the  variables. To analyse  the  issue, we employ the  Johansen 
14:375:28226:0:21:72:542:724:12:Times:12:Times:B:cointegration test proposed  by  Johansen  (1988), Johansen  and  Juselius  (1990)  and  Johansen 
14:376:28324:21:20:72:543:703:12:Times:12:Times:B:(1991) as some  studies,  for  example, Gonzalo  (1994), confirm that the Johansen  cointegration 
14:377:28419:20:21:72:543:683:12:Times:12:Times:B:test performs better than the other cointegration tests, namely the ADF test (Engle and Granger,

17:501:34192:21:21:72:543:620:12:Times:12:Times:B:setting,  one  has  to first  apply  the  linear  model  to {푥푡} and {푦푡} to  identify  their  linear  causal

19:610:38914:20:21:72:543:331:12:Times:12:Times:B:the other hand, Wan and Wong (2001) develop a model to study the contagion effect. Cerqueti, 
19:611:39007:21:21:72:542:310:12:Times:12:Times:B:et  al.  (2018)  develop  a  model  based  on  Mixed  Poisson  Processes to deal  with  the  theme  of 
19:612:39110:21:21:72:543:289:12:Times:12:Times:B:contagion  in  financial  markets.  Wang,  et  al.  (2018)  propose  a  non-Markovian  social  contagion 
19:613:39215:21:20:72:543:268:12:Times:12:Times:B:model  in  multiplex  networks with  inter-layer  degree  correlations  to  delineate  the  behavior of 
19:614:39319:20:21:72:543:248:12:Times:12:Times:B:spreading,  and  develop  an  edge-based  compartmental  theory  to  describe  the  model. The 
19:615:39413:21:21:72:543:227:12:Times:12:Times:B:nonlinear causality used  in this paper could  also be used to measure nonlinear cross-correlation 
19:616:39512:21:20:72:543:206:12:Times:12:Times:B:to handle the nonlinear contagion  effect. One  could  easily  use  or  modify Equation  (6) to deal 
19:617:39611:20:21:72:415:186:12:Times:12:Times:B:with the nonlinear cross-correlation and the nonlinear contagion effect.

19:621:39703:20:0:86:89:103:12:Times:12:Times:A: 
20:622:39705:0:21:72:543:724:12:Times:12:Times:B:In this section,  we apply the  econometrics tools  described in Section 3 to the  economic models 
20:623:39804:21:21:72:542:703:12:Times:12:Times:B:stated  in  Section  2  on  real  data and  test  whether these models are valid  with the data  from 
20:624:39904:21:21:72:546:682:12:Times:12:Times:B:developing  countries.  We  first  exhibit the  summary  statistics of 푀푡,퐷푡,푌푡 where M,  D,  and Y  
20:625:40000:21:20:72:543:661:12:Times:12:Times:B:are the logarithms of the ratio of bank deposit liabilities to nominal GDP (M), the ratio of claims 
20:626:40099:20:21:72:542:641:12:Times:12:Times:B:on  private  sector  to  nominal  GDP, and  real  GDP  per  capita,  respectively,  for  each  country. We 
20:627:40206:21:21:72:542:620:12:Times:12:Times:B:notice from the summary  statistics3 that the means of the first financial development proxy  (M) 
20:628:40301:21:20:72:543:599:12:Times:12:Times:B:and the second financial development proxy (D) of different countries fall within relatively large 
20:629:40397:20:21:72:543:579:12:Times:12:Times:B:ranges of [-3.308, 22.591] and [-1.983, 23.659] with an average of 0.449 and 1.729, respectively, 
20:630:40491:21:21:72:543:558:12:Times:12:Times:B:while the economic growth proxy (Y) of different countries fall within a relatively small range of 
20:631:40589:21:21:72:543:537:12:Times:12:Times:B:[-17.321, -8.210], with an average of -12.669. The summary statistics also demonstrate that all of 
20:632:40685:21:20:72:543:516:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  variables  in  most  countries  have a  smaller  variance than  a  standard  normal distribution  (12 
20:633:40790:20:21:72:543:496:12:Times:12:Times:B:out  of  14 for both variables M  and  D,  and all for  variable  Y). It is  interesting  to notice that 
20:634:40891:21:21:72:543:475:12:Times:12:Times:B:slightly more than half of the first financial development proxy series are skewed to the right (8 
20:635:40986:21:20:72:543:454:12:Times:12:Times:B:out  of  14), as  are most  of  the  second financial development  proxy series  (10 out  of  14) while 
20:636:41085:20:21:72:460:434:12:Times:12:Times:B:most of the economic growth proxy series are skewed to the left (10 out of 14).

20:641:41204:21:21:72:542:330:12:Times:12:Times:B:Before  the  cointegration  and  causality  analysis is  conducted,  we  employ  the  most commonly 
20:642:41303:21:20:72:542:309:12:Times:11:Times:B:used  unit  root  test -- augmented  Dickey-Fuller  unit  root  test  -- to  test  whether  the  variables, 
20:643:41409:20:21:72:543:289:11:g_d0_f13:12:Times:B:푀푡,퐷푡, and 푌푡, used in this paper contain a unit root. The results are exhibited in Table 2, reader may 
20:644:41509:21:21:72:542:268:12:Times:12:Times:B:refer to Chow, Vieito, and Wong (2018) for Table 2. From the table, the hypothesis of having a 
20:645:41602:21:20:72:543:247:12:Times:12:Times:B:unit  root  in  the  original  (level)  series  of  the  first  financial  development  proxy  (M),  the  second 
20:646:41715:20:21:72:543:227:12:Times:12:Times:B:financial  development  proxy  (D)  and  the  economic  growth  proxy  (Y)  are  not  rejected  for  all 
20:647:41820:21:21:72:542:206:12:Times:12:Times:B:countries. On the other hand, the hypothesis of having a unit root for the first differences of the 
20:648:41919:21:20:72:542:185:12:Times:12:Times:B:first  financial  development  proxy  (M),  the  second  financial  development  proxy  (D)  and  the 
20:649:42021:20:54:72:543:165:12:Times:12:Times:B:economic   growth   proxy   (Y)   are   rejected   for   all   countries. Thus, without   exception,   the

20:651:42185:20:0:72:370:91:6:Times:9:Times:F:3 To save space, we do not report the table but the results are available on request.  
21:652:42272:0:21:72:543:724:12:Times:12:Times:B:augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test leads us to conclude that all three variables (M, D, and Y) 
21:653:42371:21:20:72:195:703:12:Times:11:Times:B:are I (1) for all countries.

21:658:42428:31:20:72:543:603:12:Times:12:Times:B:The  cointegration  and  causality  analysis  cannot  be  carried  out  without  first  applying  the 
21:659:42530:20:22:72:543:583:12:Times:12:Times:B:Johansen  cointegration  test for the  variables, 푀푡,퐷푡, and 푌푡, to examine  whether  there  is  any 
21:660:42627:22:21:72:543:561:12:Times:12:Times:B:cointegration  relationship  among the  variables, 푀푡,퐷푡, and 푌푡, for  each  country and  the  results 
21:661:42726:21:21:72:542:540:12:Times:12:Times:B:are displayed in Table 2. The number of lags to introduce in the Johansen cointegration test is a 
21:662:42822:21:21:72:542:519:12:Times:12:Times:B:key  decision,  and  various  informational  criteria  could  recommend  different lag lengths  for  the 
21:663:42926:21:20:72:542:498:12:Times:12:Times:B:explanatory  variable and different  criteria  could  lead  to  conflicting  results.  To circumvent  the 
21:664:43031:20:21:72:546:478:12:Times:12:Times:B:limitation, we use lag one to lag four in applying the Johansen cointegration test for each country. 
21:665:43127:21:21:72:543:457:12:Times:12:Times:B:From  the  table,  the  null  hypothesis  of  no  cointegration among the  first financial development 
21:666:43229:21:21:72:542:436:12:Times:12:Times:B:proxy  (M),  the  second financial development  proxy  (D)  and  the  economic  growth  proxy  (Y)  is 
21:667:43331:21:20:72:543:415:12:Times:12:Times:B:rejected by at least half of the test statistics at ten percent significant level in all countries except 
21:668:43436:20:21:72:542:395:12:Times:12:Times:B:Brazil, El  Salvador,  Guatemala,  India, Malaysia,  Peru, and Sri  Lanka.  For Brazil,  El  Salvador, 
21:669:43537:21:21:72:543:374:12:Times:12:Times:B:Guatemala, India, Malaysia, Peru, and Sri Lanka, more than half of the test statistics suggest that 
21:670:43636:21:20:72:543:353:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  null  hypothesis  of  no  cointegration  is  not  rejected. In  particular, eight out  of  eight test 
21:671:43742:20:21:72:542:333:12:Times:12:Times:B:statistics suggest  that the  null  hypothesis  of  no  cointegration  is  not  rejected in  Malaysia. Thus, 
21:672:43849:21:21:72:542:312:12:Times:12:Times:B:the Johansen cointegration test leads us to conclude that M, D, and Y are conintegrated in some 
21:673:43945:21:20:72:542:291:12:Times:12:Times:B:countries but not in other countries. In particular, we conclude that for Chile, China, Costa Rica, 
21:674:44045:20:21:72:545:271:12:Times:12:Times:B:Pakistan, South Africa, Thailand, and Turkey, M, D, and Y are cointegrated. However, for Brazil, 
21:675:44141:21:31:72:542:250:12:Times:12:Times:B:El Salvador, Guatemala, India, Malaysia, Peru, and Sri Lanka, M, D, and Y are not cointegrated.

21:679:44276:21:21:72:543:147:12:Times:12:Times:B:We next conduct the Engle–Granger two-step cointegration test as a complementary analysis of 
21:680:44368:21:20:72:543:126:12:Times:12:Times:B:the Johansen cointegration test and report the results in Tables 3 and 4 for each of the countries 
21:681:44462:20:0:72:542:106:12:Times:12:Times:B:for different pairs of variables. Table 3 (reader may refer to Chow, Vieito, and Wong (2018) for 
22:682:44558:0:21:72:542:724:12:Times:12:Times:B:Table 3) suggests that a cointegration relationship between the first financial development proxy 
22:683:44654:21:20:72:543:703:12:Times:12:Times:B:(M)  and  the  economic  growth  proxy  (Y) exists for  Chile,  China, South  Africa, and Sri  Lanka 
22:684:44753:20:21:72:542:683:12:Times:12:Times:B:while Table 4 (reader may refer to Chow, Vieito, and Wong (2018) for Table 4) suggests that a 
22:685:44844:21:21:72:542:662:12:Times:12:Times:B:cointegration   relationship   between the second financial development   proxy   (D)   and   the 
22:686:44941:21:21:72:543:641:12:Times:12:Times:B:economic  growth  proxy  (Y) exists for  Pakistan,  South  Africa, and  Turkey  at  ten  percent 
22:687:45037:21:30:72:515:620:12:Times:12:Times:B:significant level. The results are consistent with those from the Johansen cointegration test.

22:689:45132:21:21:72:543:569:12:Times:12:Times:B:To obtain more  details, results from Tables 3 and 4 are further  analyzed: a  cointegration

22:691:45311:20:21:72:543:528:12:Times:12:Times:B:(Y)  and  between the second  financial  development  proxy  (D)  and  Y is only  found for  South 
22:692:45409:21:21:72:542:507:12:Times:12:Times:B:Africa. There is also a cointegration relationship only between M and Y for Chile, China, and Sri 
22:693:45506:21:21:72:543:486:12:Times:12:Times:B:Lanka and finally a cointegration relationship only between D and Y is found for Pakistan, South 
22:694:45602:21:20:72:542:465:12:Times:12:Times:B:Africa, and  Turkey  at  ten  percent  significant  level. In  addition,  there is  no cointegration

22:700:45885:20:21:72:543:342:12:Times:12:Times:B:As some  pairs  of  variables  are  cointegrated  while others are  not, we  employ  both VAR  and 
22:701:45983:21:21:72:543:321:12:Times:12:Times:B:VECM models to the multivariate linear Granger causality for the corresponding countries’ data. 
22:702:46077:21:20:72:542:300:12:Times:12:Times:B:More  specifically, Brazil,  El  Salvador,  Guatemala,  India,  Malaysia,  Peru  and  Sri  Lanka  are 
22:703:46179:20:21:72:543:280:12:Times:12:Times:B:modeled by the VAR model and Chile, China, Costa Rica, Pakistan, South Africa, Thailand and 
22:704:46270:21:21:72:542:259:12:Times:12:Times:B:Turkey  are  modeled  by  the VECM. The multivariate  linear  Granger causality  test  is  applied  to 
22:705:46372:21:21:72:542:238:12:Times:12:Times:B:test  the following  two  hypotheses: 1) (both  first  and  second  proxies  of) financial  development 
22:706:46475:21:21:72:543:217:12:Times:12:Times:B:does not linearly Granger cause economic growth (퐻0:푀,퐷⇏푌); 2) economic growth does not 
22:707:46560:21:21:72:543:196:12:Times:12:Times:B:linearly Granger cause (both first and second proxies of) financial development (퐻0:푌⇏푀,퐷). 
22:708:46652:21:20:72:542:175:12:Times:12:Times:B:The results are showed in Table 5 (reader may refer to Chow, Vieito, and Wong (2018) for Table 
22:709:46744:20:31:72:87:155:12:Times:12:Times:B:5). 
22:710:46747:31:21:86:542:124:12:Times:12:Times:A:As the number of lags to introduce is an important issue in the test and various informational 
22:711:46839:21:0:72:543:103:12:Times:12:Times:B:criteria  could  lead  to  conflicting  results,  we  apply  the  null  hypothesis  of  no  linear  Granger 
23:712:46949:0:21:72:542:724:12:Times:12:Times:B:causality test in all of  the countries’ data from lag one to lag four. Since  we  are  dealing  with 
23:713:47047:21:20:72:445:703:12:Times:12:Times:B:annual data, this implies that we account for lead-lag effects up to four years. 
23:714:47127:20:21:86:543:683:12:Times:12:Times:A:The results displayed in Table 5 demonstrate that 13 out of 14 countries appear to have linear 
23:715:47219:21:21:72:542:662:12:Times:12:Times:B:Granger causal relationship between (both first and second proxies of) financial development and 
23:716:47316:21:21:72:542:641:12:Times:12:Times:B:economic  growth.  The  hypothesis  of  no  linear  Granger causality  from (both  first  and  second 
23:717:47418:21:20:72:543:620:12:Times:12:Times:B:proxies of) financial development to economic growth is rejected in the case of Brazil, Chile, El 
23:718:47514:20:21:72:542:600:12:Times:12:Times:B:Salvador,  Guatemala,  India,  Malaysia,  Peru, and  Sri  Lanka at  ten  percent  significant  level.  The 
23:719:47619:21:21:72:543:579:12:Times:12:Times:B:rejection results  are  strong  in  all nine countries  in  a  sense  that  null  hypothesis  is  rejected  in  at 
23:720:47733:21:20:72:543:558:12:Times:12:Times:B:least  two  out  of  four  different  lags.  As  for  the  opposite  direction,  there  are five countries  for 
23:721:47844:20:21:72:542:538:12:Times:12:Times:B:which  the  test  statistics  suggest  that  there  is  linear  Granger  causality  from  economic  growth  to 
23:722:47955:21:21:72:543:517:12:Times:12:Times:B:(both  first  and  second  proxies  of) financial  development,  namely  Chile,  China,  Malaysia, 
23:723:48054:21:21:72:543:496:12:Times:12:Times:B:Thailand and Turkey. These results are also strong in the same manner, inferring that economic

23:732:48753:21:21:72:542:303:12:Times:12:Times:B:countries, Tables 6 and 7 show the results of bivariate linear Granger causality tests for each of 
23:733:48848:21:20:72:543:282:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  countries for  different  pairs  of  variables. The  results  in Table  6 (reader  may  refer  to Chow, 
23:734:48955:20:21:72:543:262:12:Times:12:Times:B:Vieito, and Wong (2018) for Table 6) suggest that there is a linear Granger causality relationship 
23:735:49052:21:21:72:543:241:12:Times:12:Times:B:from the first financial development  proxy to economic  growth  proxy  for 5  countries  (Chile, 
23:736:49148:21:21:72:543:220:12:Times:12:Times:B:India, Malaysia, Peru, and Turkey), while the inverse (a causality relationship from the economic 
23:737:49244:21:20:72:542:199:12:Times:12:Times:B:growth proxy to the first financial development proxy) only holds true for 2 countries (Chile and 
23:738:49337:20:21:72:543:179:12:Times:12:Times:B:China). On  the  other  hand, Table  7 (reader  may  refer  to Chow, Vieito, and Wong (2018) for 
23:739:49431:21:21:72:543:158:12:Times:12:Times:B:Table  7) suggests  that  there is a  linear  Granger  causality  relationship  from the second financial 
23:740:49534:21:20:72:543:137:12:Times:12:Times:B:development  proxy  to  economic  growth  proxy  for only Turkey,  while a causality  relationship 
23:741:49631:20:21:72:542:117:12:Times:12:Times:B:from  economic  growth  proxy  to the second financial development  proxy exists for 4  countries 
23:742:49727:21:0:72:260:96:12:Times:12:Times:B:(India, Malaysia, Peru, and Thailand).

24:744:49767:21:20:107:542:703:12:Times:12:Times:A:Based on results, the following is a detailed summary of information obtained for the first 
24:745:49859:20:21:72:543:683:12:Times:12:Times:B:financial development proxy: There is a strong bidirectional linear Granger relationship between 
24:746:49955:21:21:72:542:662:12:Times:12:Times:B:economic growth and the first financial development proxy for Chile, Peru, and China. The first 
24:747:50048:21:21:72:542:641:12:Times:12:Times:B:financial development  proxy  strongly  linear Granger  causes economic growth, but  economic 
24:748:50139:21:20:72:543:620:12:Times:12:Times:B:growth weakly linear Granger causes the first financial development proxy for Turkey. There is a 
24:749:50232:20:21:72:542:600:12:Times:12:Times:B:strong unidirectional linear  Granger  relationship from  the first financial development  proxy to 
24:750:50330:21:21:72:543:579:12:Times:12:Times:B:economic growth for  India, Malaysia, El Salvador, and Thailand. Guatemala, on the other hand 
24:751:50423:21:20:72:543:558:12:Times:12:Times:B:presents  a weak  unidirectional linear  Granger  relationship from  the first  financial  development 
24:752:50524:20:21:72:543:538:12:Times:12:Times:B:proxy to economic  growth. There is  a weak  unidirectional linear  Granger  relationship from 
24:753:50615:21:21:72:542:517:12:Times:12:Times:B:economic  growth to the first financial development for Sri Lanka. And lastly, there is no linear 
24:754:50711:21:21:72:543:496:12:Times:12:Times:B:Granger  relationship  between  economic  growth  and the first  financial  development  proxy for 
24:755:50809:21:20:72:303:475:12:Times:12:Times:B:Brazil, Costa Rica, Pakistan, and South Africa.  
24:756:50856:20:21:90:93:455:12:Times:12:Times:A: 
24:757:50856:21:21:107:543:434:12:Times:12:Times:A:The  summary  of  detailed  information  obtained  for the second financial  development 
24:758:50945:21:20:72:543:413:12:Times:12:Times:B:proxy is as follows:  No bidirectional linear Granger relationship between economic growth and 
24:759:51037:20:21:72:542:393:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  second financial  development  proxy is found for  any  country.  There is however  a strong 
24:760:51131:21:21:72:542:372:12:Times:12:Times:B:unidirectional linear  Granger  relationship from  the  second financial  development  proxy to 
24:761:51226:21:20:72:542:351:12:Times:12:Times:B:economic  growth for  Turkey. We  notice  that there  are  more  linear  causalities from the first 
24:762:51324:20:21:72:543:331:12:Times:12:Times:B:financial  development  proxy than  from the second financial  development  proxy to economic 
24:763:51418:21:21:72:543:310:12:Times:12:Times:B:growth and the  number  of  linear  causality   from economic  growth to the first  financial 
24:764:51509:21:21:72:543:289:12:Times:12:Times:B:development is about the same as those to the second financial development proxy. However, the 
24:765:51602:21:20:72:543:268:12:Times:12:Times:B:causality  could be  completely  different. For example, economic  growth strongly linear Granger 
24:766:51700:20:21:72:543:248:12:Times:12:Times:B:causes the  first financial  development  proxy but  does  not linear  cause the  second financial 
24:767:51797:21:21:72:542:227:12:Times:12:Times:B:development  proxy for  Chile. Economic  growth strongly linear Granger  causes the  second 
24:768:51887:21:20:72:543:206:12:Times:12:Times:B:financial development proxy but does not linear cause the first financial development proxy for 
24:769:51981:20:21:72:543:186:12:Times:12:Times:B:Thailand. Economic  growth  strongly  linearly Granger  causes second financial development 
24:770:52071:21:21:72:543:165:12:Times:12:Times:B:proxy but second financial development proxy not linearly Granger causes economic growth for 
24:771:52161:21:21:72:542:144:12:Times:12:Times:B:India,  Malaysia,  Peru, and  Thailand.  Second financial development  proxy  weakly  linearly 
24:772:52254:21:20:72:543:123:12:Times:12:Times:B:Granger  causes economic  growth  but  economic  growth  proxy  not  linearly Granger  causes 
24:773:52346:20:0:72:542:103:12:Times:12:Times:B:financial development for  El  Salvador  and  South  Africa.  Economic  growth weakly  linearly 
25:774:52442:0:21:72:543:724:12:Times:12:Times:B:Granger causes second financial development proxy but second financial development proxy not 
25:775:52532:21:20:72:542:703:12:Times:12:Times:B:linearly Granger  causes economic  growth for  China.  Second financial development  proxy  does 
25:776:52626:20:21:72:542:683:12:Times:12:Times:B:not  linearly Granger  cause economic  growth  and  economic growth  does  not  linearly Granger 
25:777:52723:21:21:72:542:662:12:Times:12:Times:B:cause second financial development  proxy for  Brazil,  Chile,  Costa  Rica,  Guatemala,  Pakistan 
25:778:52820:21:21:72:145:641:12:Times:12:Times:B:and Sri Lanka.

25:780:52834:31:29:72:328:589:12:Times:12:Times:B:4.6 Multivariate Nonlinear Granger causality test 
25:781:52881:29:20:72:543:560:11:Times:11:Times:F:Many studies, among which Chiang, et al. (2009), Qiao,  et al. (2008, 2009), and Owyong, et al. (2015), 
25:782:52984:20:21:72:542:540:11:Times:12:Times:B:have found that linear causality and nonlinear causality are independent from one another in the sense 
25:783:53086:21:20:72:542:519:12:Times:12:Times:B:that certain variables may present a linear causality while others a nonlinear causality. It is thus 
25:784:53187:20:20:72:542:499:12:Times:11:Times:B:advisable  to  test  for  nonlinear  causality  following  the  testing  for  linear  causality..  Thus, 
25:785:53292:20:19:72:542:479:11:Times:11:Times:F:examination  of  nonlinear  causality  is  important  after  examination  of  linear  causality  among  some 
25:786:53401:19:19:72:542:460:11:Times:11:Times:F:variables. We note that before examining whether there is any nonlinear causality among the variables, it 
25:787:53507:19:19:72:542:441:11:Times:11:Times:F:is  good  to  examine  whether  there  is  any  nonlinearity  in  the  residuals  of  fitting  linear  causality.   In  this 
25:788:53632:19:19:72:543:422:11:Times:11:Times:F:paper, we have employed the latest powerful nonlinearity test (Hui, et al., 2017) in the residuals of fitting 
25:789:53742:19:30:72:346:403:11:Times:11:Times:F:linear causality.  We omit reporting the results for simplicity.  
25:790:53806:30:21:72:542:373:12:Times:12:Times:B:We  apply the multivariate  nonlinear  Granger causality  test  to  the  residuals obtained  from  using 
25:791:53911:21:20:72:546:352:12:Times:12:Times:B:either VAR or VECM to the logarithm of the ratio of bank deposit liabilities to nominal GDP (M) 
25:792:54007:20:21:72:543:332:12:Times:12:Times:B:and the logarithm of the ratio of claims on private sector to nominal GDP (D) and the logarithm 
25:793:54102:21:21:72:543:311:12:Times:12:Times:B:of real GDP per capita (Y) and exhibit the results in Table 3. In the table, lags denote the number 
25:794:54200:21:20:72:543:290:12:Times:12:Times:B:of  lags  on  the  residuals  series  used  in  the  test.  The  results  shows  that  12  out  of  14 countries 
25:795:54312:20:21:72:542:270:12:Times:12:Times:B:appear to have nonlinear Granger causal relationship between (both first and second proxies of) 
25:796:54407:21:21:72:543:249:12:Times:12:Times:B:financial development and economic growth. There are eight countries for which at least half of 
25:797:54502:21:21:72:542:228:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  test  statistics  suggest  that  (both  first  and  second  proxies  of) financial  development 
25:798:54602:21:20:72:542:207:12:Times:12:Times:B:nonlinearly causes economic  growth,  namely Brazil,  Chile,  Guatemala, Malaysia,  Peru,  Sri 
25:799:54694:20:21:72:542:187:12:Times:12:Times:B:Lanka, and  Turkey.  The  results  again are strong  in  all eight countries  in  a  sense  that  null 
25:800:54795:21:21:72:543:166:12:Times:12:Times:B:hypothesis is rejected in at least two out of four different lags. On the other hand, there are nine 
25:801:54895:21:20:72:543:145:12:Times:12:Times:B:countries for which the test statistics suggest that economic growth nonlinearly causes  (both first 
25:802:54994:20:0:72:542:125:12:Times:12:Times:B:and  second  proxies  of) financial  development,  namely Brazil, Chile,  China,  India,  Peru,  South 
26:803:55099:0:21:72:542:724:12:Times:12:Times:B:Africa, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. However, strong results only appear in Brazil, India, Peru, and 
26:804:55192:21:31:72:152:703:12:Times:12:Times:B:South America.  
26:805:55207:31:20:107:540:672:12:Times:12:Times:A:We  now  present  more  detailed information on  the  relationship  as  follows: A bi-
26:806:55291:20:21:72:543:652:12:Times:12:Times:B:directional nonlinear Granger causal relationship is present in a strong sense for Brazil and Peru. 
26:807:55388:21:21:72:542:631:12:Times:12:Times:B:Financial development  strongly Granger  causes economic  growth nonlinearly but  economic 
26:808:55477:21:20:72:542:610:12:Times:12:Times:B:growth weakly Granger causes financial development nonlinearly for both Chile and Sri Lanka.

26:810:55654:21:21:72:543:569:12:Times:12:Times:B:development   weakly Granger   causes economic   growth nonlinearly for   India. Financial 
26:811:55741:21:20:72:543:548:12:Times:12:Times:B:development  strongly Granger  causes economic  growth nonlinearly but  economic  growth does

26:815:56105:21:20:72:543:465:12:Times:12:Times:B:growth  weakly Granger  causes financial development nonlinearly but financial development 
26:816:56193:20:21:72:543:445:12:Times:12:Times:B:does not Granger cause economic  growth nonlinearly for both China and Thailand. There is no 
26:817:56285:21:21:72:542:424:12:Times:12:Times:B:nonlinear  causality  between  financial development and economic  growth for  Costa Rica,  El

26:821:56538:21:20:72:543:324:12:Times:12:Times:B:our  analysis,  Tables 9 and  10 exhibit the  results  of  the  individual  nonlinear  Granger  causality 
26:822:56640:20:21:72:542:304:12:Times:12:Times:B:tests  for  each  of  the  countries for  different  pairs  of  variables. Table  9 suggests  that  a nonlinear 
26:823:56750:21:21:72:542:283:12:Times:12:Times:B:Granger  causality  relationship exists from the first financial development  proxy  to  economic 
26:824:56847:21:20:72:542:262:12:Times:12:Times:B:growth  proxy  for Brazil,  Chile, and  Peru,  while  there  is  causality  relationship  from  economic

26:826:57049:21:21:72:543:221:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  other  hand, Table  10 (reader  may  refer  to Chow, Vieito, and Wong (2018) for  Table  10) 
26:827:57144:21:21:72:543:200:12:Times:12:Times:B:suggests  that  a nonlinear  Granger  causality  relationship exists from the second financial

27:832:57479:0:21:107:543:724:12:Times:12:Times:A:We now present  more  detailed information on nonlinear  causality for  the first  financial 
27:833:57570:21:20:72:542:703:12:Times:12:Times:B:development proxy as  follows: There is  strong  evidence  of  a bidirectional  nonlinearly  Granger 
27:834:57668:20:21:72:543:683:12:Times:12:Times:B:relationship between economic growth and the first financial development proxy for Chile. The 
27:835:57760:21:21:72:542:662:12:Times:12:Times:B:first  financial  development  proxy  strongly Granger  causes economic  growth nonlinearly but

27:837:57952:21:20:72:543:620:12:Times:12:Times:B:both Brazil and Peru. Economic growth strongly Granger causes the first financial development 
27:838:58045:20:21:72:543:600:12:Times:12:Times:B:proxy nonlinearly but the first  financial  development proxy does not Granger  cause economic

27:847:58801:21:20:107:542:413:12:Times:12:Times:A:We turn  to present  more  detailed information in nonlinear  causality for  the second 
27:848:58888:20:21:72:542:393:12:Times:12:Times:B:financial development  proxy as  follows. The second financial development  proxy  strongly

28:864:60161:31:21:72:542:693:12:Times:12:Times:B:We summarize the results of our bivariate linear and nonlinear causality tests in Table 11, reader

28:866:60316:30:21:107:543:642:12:Times:12:Times:A:From the table, we conclude that there are bidirectional (linear or nonlinear) relationships 
28:867:60407:21:21:72:542:621:12:Times:12:Times:B:between  financial  development  and  economic  growth for  most  of  the  countries  studied  in  our

28:874:60773:21:21:72:543:456:12:Times:12:Times:B:In  this  paper,  we  draw  inference  on  cointegration  and  causality.  We  first  draw  inference  on 
28:875:60879:21:20:72:141:435:12:Times:12:Times:B:cointegration.

28:878:60911:21:30:72:75:373:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
28:879:60911:30:21:72:542:343:12:Times:12:Times:B:We first find that financial development and economic growth are cointegrated in some countries 
28:880:61007:21:21:72:542:322:12:Times:12:Times:B:but  not  in  others. From Tables 3  and  4, we  find  that cointegration  relationships are  present 
28:881:61107:21:20:72:542:301:12:Times:12:Times:B:between  both  M  and  Y  and  between  D  and  Y  only  in  South  Africa.  There is a  cointegration 
28:882:61209:20:21:72:542:281:12:Times:12:Times:B:relationship  only  between  M  and  Y  for  Chile,  China,  and  Sri  Lanka and a  cointegration 
28:883:61306:21:21:72:543:260:12:Times:12:Times:B:relationship  only  between  D  and  Y  for  Pakistan,  South  Africa,  and  Turkey  at  ten  percent 
28:884:61408:21:21:72:543:239:12:Times:12:Times:B:significant  level. In  addition,  no cointegration  relationship is found between  M  and  Y  and 
28:885:61505:21:20:72:542:218:12:Times:12:Times:B:between D  and  Y  for Brazil,  Costa  Rica,  El  Salvador,  Guatemala,  India,  Malaysia,  Peru,  and 
28:886:61606:20:31:72:120:198:12:Times:12:Times:B:Thailand. 
28:887:61615:31:21:72:543:167:12:Times:12:Times:B:Readers  may   ask  the   following  questions:  (1) could the cointegration  between financial 
28:888:61711:21:20:72:540:146:12:Times:12:Times:B:development  and  economic  growth  in  a  country  imply  that  both demand-following  and  supply-
28:889:61811:20:21:72:543:126:12:Times:12:Times:B:leading  theories  hold  for  the  country? and  (2)  why are financial  development  and  economic 
28:890:61910:21:0:72:387:105:12:Times:12:Times:B:growth cointegrated in some countries but not in other countries? 
29:891:61977:0:31:72:332:724:12:Times:12:Times:B:To answer these, the following hypothesis are tested:  
29:892:62030:31:21:72:460:693:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times:B:H03: financial development and economic growth are not positively cointegrated. 
29:893:62107:21:31:72:75:672:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
29:894:62107:31:31:72:105:641:12:Times:12:Times:B:versus 
29:895:62113:31:21:72:442:610:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times:B:H13: financial development and economic growth are positively cointegrated. 
29:896:62184:21:31:72:75:589:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
29:897:62184:31:21:72:543:558:12:Times:12:Times:B:Rejection  of H03 or  acceptance of H13 implies  that financial  development and economic  growth 
29:898:62279:21:21:72:542:537:12:Times:12:Times:B:are positively cointegrated. We suggest  that  there is either a  cointegration  relationship  between 
29:899:62380:21:21:72:542:516:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  first  financial  development  proxy  (M)  and  the  economic  growth  proxy  (Y)  or between  the 
29:900:62484:21:20:72:543:495:12:Times:12:Times:B:second  financial  development  proxy  (D)  and  Y, and conclude  that  there is a  cointegration 
29:901:62581:20:21:72:543:475:12:Times:12:Times:B:relationship  between  financial  development  and  economic  growth.  In  this  paper  we  make  the 
29:902:62683:21:31:72:177:454:12:Times:12:Times:B:following conjecture: 
29:903:62704:31:20:72:543:423:12:Times:12:Times:B:Conjecture  1: If  there is  a positive cointegration  relationship  between  financial  development 
29:904:62804:20:21:72:542:403:12:Times:12:Times:B:and economic growth in a country, then both demand-following and supply-leading theories hold 
29:905:62898:21:31:72:153:382:12:Times:12:Times:B:for that country. 
29:906:62914:31:21:72:543:351:12:Times:12:Times:B:The reasoning behind Conjecture 1 is that since financial development and economic growth are 
29:907:63005:21:20:72:543:330:12:Times:12:Times:B:cointegrated, financial   development  and  economic  growth  move positively together. If   a 
29:908:63098:20:21:72:543:310:12:Times:12:Times:B:Government could boost its economic growth, then its financial development would also expand, 
29:909:63190:21:21:72:542:289:12:Times:12:Times:B:implying  that the  supply-leading  hypothesis holds.  On  the  other  hand, if  a  Government  could 
29:910:63292:21:20:72:543:268:12:Times:12:Times:B:expand its financial development, then its economic growth would also boom, implying that the 
29:911:63384:20:21:72:543:248:12:Times:12:Times:B:demand-following hypothesis holds. We note that if financial development and economic growth 
29:912:63476:21:21:72:540:227:12:Times:12:Times:B:are  not  cointegrated positively in  a  country,  then  one  cannot  conclude  that  both demand-
29:913:63574:21:20:72:542:206:12:Times:12:Times:B:following  and  supply-leading  theories  do  not  hold  for  the  country.  To  make  such a strong 
29:914:63675:20:21:72:542:186:12:Times:12:Times:B:conclusion,  we  need  to  examine  their  (linear  and  nonlinear)  causality  as  well. We  will  discuss 
29:915:63782:21:21:72:543:165:12:Times:12:Times:B:this issue  later  on. In  addition,  we  conclude  that  financial  development  and  economic  growth 
29:916:63883:21:21:72:542:144:12:Times:12:Times:B:move together positively if  there  is  any  positive  cointegration  from  any  of  the  proxies  of 
29:917:63983:21:20:72:543:123:12:Times:12:Times:B:financial  development,  including  the first  financial  development  proxy  (M)  and  the  second 
29:918:64083:20:0:72:542:103:12:Times:12:Times:B:financial development proxy  (D),  and any  proxy  of economic  growth, which for the purpose of 
30:919:64182:0:21:72:543:724:12:Times:12:Times:B:this  analysis, only the  economic  growth  proxy  (Y) is  used where   M,  D,  and Y  are the 
30:920:64273:21:20:72:542:703:12:Times:12:Times:B:logarithms of  the  ratio  of  bank  deposit  liabilities  to  nominal  GDP  (M), the  ratio  of  claims  on 
30:921:64381:20:21:72:542:683:12:Times:12:Times:B:private sector to nominal GDP, and real GDP per capita, respectively, for each country. We also 
30:922:64477:21:21:72:546:662:12:Times:12:Times:B:note  that the  proxies  of  financial  development  and  economic  growth  are  not limited to  M,  D,  
30:923:64579:21:21:72:542:641:12:Times:12:Times:B:and Y , but could also include any new proxy of financial development or economic growth that 
30:924:64672:21:20:72:546:620:12:Times:12:Times:B:economists may encounter in the future. However, as far as we know, to date only  M,  D,  and Y  
30:925:64763:20:22:72:543:600:12:Times:12:Times:B:are  being  used as proxies  of  financial  development  and  economic  growth,  respectively.   Thus, 
30:926:64866:22:21:72:542:578:12:Times:12:Times:B:from Tables  3  and  4  (or  from Table  11),  we  can reject H03 and conclude  that financial 
30:927:64960:21:20:72:543:557:12:Times:12:Times:B:development  and  economic  growth move positively  together and both demand-following  and 
30:928:65050:20:31:72:527:537:12:Times:12:Times:B:supply-leading theories work for Chile, China, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Turkey. 
30:929:65143:31:21:72:542:506:12:Times:12:Times:B:As  far  as the  second  question of why financial  development  and  economic  growth  are 
30:930:65233:21:20:72:543:485:12:Times:12:Times:B:cointegrated in some countries but not in others, this analysis is unable to provide an answer to 
30:931:65331:20:21:72:543:465:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  second  question  as  this  is an applied  econometric study  and  not  a  theoretical  economic 
30:932:65431:21:21:72:543:444:12:Times:12:Times:B:research  paper.  Nonetheless,  we  believe  that  there  could be some  factors,  say,  Fi,  i=1,...,p  in 
30:933:65538:21:20:72:543:423:12:Times:12:Times:B:financial  development  and some  factors,  say,  Ej,  j=1,...,q  in  economic  growth that  could  be 
30:934:65639:20:21:72:543:403:12:Times:12:Times:B:related to one another. It could be an interesting topic for further research, to investigate whether 
30:935:65737:21:21:72:543:382:12:Times:12:Times:B:there  are  some  pairs  (Fi,  Ej) which are  cointegrated  while  others (Fi,  Ej)  are  not. Financial 
30:936:65839:21:21:72:543:361:12:Times:12:Times:B:development and economic growth could be cointegrated in a specific country, say, Country A, 
30:937:65931:21:20:72:543:340:12:Times:12:Times:B:due to the existence of cointegrated factors (Fi, Ej) in Country A, while in another country, say, 
30:938:66029:20:21:72:542:320:12:Times:12:Times:B:Country B,  financial development and economic growth may not be cointegrated because there 
30:939:66119:21:21:72:542:299:12:Times:12:Times:B:is no cointegrated factors (Fi, Ej) in Country  B.  Instead, which not be  cointegrated.  Country B 
30:940:66217:21:31:72:291:278:12:Times:12:Times:B:obtain all (Fi, Ej)’s that are not cointegrated.

30:943:66281:21:30:72:75:206:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
30:944:66281:30:32:72:406:176:12:Times:12:Times:B:As discussed in Section 3.2, the following two hypotheses are tested: 
30:945:66347:32:31:72:385:144:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times:B:H01: financial development does not cause economic growth, and 
30:946:66408:31:0:72:364:113:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times:B:H02: economic growth does not cause financial development. 
31:947:66467:0:21:72:543:724:12:Times:12:Times:B:Unlike other approaches employed by other researchers such as  Horng, et al. (2012) and Fan, et 
31:948:66561:21:20:72:543:703:12:Times:12:Times:B:al. (2018) who employ linear   causality   to   study   whether   there   is   any   unidirectional   or 
31:949:66663:20:21:72:546:683:12:Times:12:Times:B:bidirectional causality between financial development and economic growth, in this paper we set  
31:950:66759:21:31:72:202:662:12:Times:12:Times:B:the following hypotheses:  
31:951:66784:31:22:72:542:631:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times:B:H01: financial development does not cause economic growth if there is no linear and no nonlinear 
31:952:66879:22:31:72:519:609:12:Times:12:Times:B:causality from financial development to economic growth. Similar hypothesis are set for H02, 
31:953:66971:31:21:72:542:578:12:Times:12:Times:B:and  set H11 that the financial  development  causes  economic  growth if  there  is  any  linear  and/or 
31:954:67074:21:21:72:543:557:12:Times:12:Times:B:nonlinear  causality  from  financial  development  to  economic  growth.  In  addition,  we  conclude 
31:955:67176:21:20:72:543:536:12:Times:12:Times:B:that financial  development  causes  economic  growth if  there  is  any  linear  and/or  nonlinear 
31:956:67275:20:21:72:542:516:12:Times:12:Times:B:causality  from  any  of  the  proxies  of  financial  development,  including  the first  financial 
31:957:67376:21:21:72:543:495:12:Times:12:Times:B:development  proxy  (M)  and  the  second  financial  development  proxy  (D), to  any  proxy  of 
31:958:67474:21:20:72:543:474:12:Times:12:Times:B:economic growth, which, for the purpose of this analysis, only the economic growth proxy (Y) is 
31:959:67569:20:21:72:542:454:12:Times:12:Times:B:was used. We also note  that the proxies of financial development  and economic growth are not 
31:960:67663:21:21:72:542:433:12:Times:12:Times:B:limited to  M,  D,  and Y , but may include any other existing proxy or any new proxy of financial 
31:961:67757:21:31:72:428:412:12:Times:12:Times:B:development or economic growth that economists may find in the future.  
31:962:67826:31:21:72:543:381:12:Times:12:Times:B:Based on the results displayed in Tables 6, 7, 9, and 10 (or from Table 11), H01 is rejected and we 
31:963:67925:21:21:72:540:360:12:Times:12:Times:B:conclude that financial development does cause economic growth and consequently the supply-
31:964:68014:21:21:72:542:339:12:Times:12:Times:B:leading hypothesis holds true; in other words, either M or D or both cause Y, for Brazil, Chile, 
31:965:68110:21:21:72:543:318:12:Times:12:Times:B:China, El Salvador, Guatemala, India, Malaysia, Peru, Sri Lanka, and Turkey. However, H01 may 
31:966:68202:21:20:72:543:297:12:Times:12:Times:B:be valid and we may conclude that financial development does not cause economic growth and 
31:967:68293:20:21:72:543:277:12:Times:12:Times:B:consequently the supply-leading hypothesis does not hold true; in other words that both M or D 
31:968:68386:21:21:72:543:256:12:Times:12:Times:B:do not cause Y, for Costa Rica, Pakistan, South Africa, and Thailand if both linear and nonlinear 
31:969:68483:21:21:72:542:235:12:Times:12:Times:B:causality tests are employed.  If one adopts the  traditional  approach  to include only  linear 
31:970:68576:21:21:72:543:214:12:Times:12:Times:B:causality,  then one could accept H01 and  conclude  that financial  development  does  not  cause 
31:971:68673:21:21:72:543:193:12:Times:12:Times:B:economic growth and consequently the supply-leading hypothesis does not hold for Costa Rica, 
31:972:68765:21:20:72:542:172:12:Times:12:Times:B:Pakistan,  South  Africa,  Thailand,  and  Turkey.  This  implies that  if  one  adopts the  approach  we 
31:973:68870:20:21:72:543:152:12:Times:12:Times:B:proposed to include both linear and nonlinear causality to determine whether the supply-leading 
31:974:68966:21:0:72:394:131:12:Times:12:Times:B:hypothesis holds true, then one more country (Turkey) is included. 
32:975:69032:0:21:72:542:723:12:g_d0_f13:12:Times:B:H02 is rejected and  we  conclude  that  economic  growth  does  cause  financial  development 
32:976:69124:21:20:72:542:702:12:Times:12:Times:B:consequently validating the demand-following  hypothesis. In other words, Y causes either M or 
32:977:69218:20:21:72:542:682:12:Times:12:Times:B:D or both for Brazil, Chile, China, Costa Rica,  El Salvador, India, Malaysia, Peru, South Africa, 
32:978:69315:21:21:72:542:661:12:Times:12:Times:B:Sri  Lanka, Thailand, and Turkey. However, only  in the case of  Guatemala and Pakistan, we do 
32:979:69409:21:21:72:543:640:12:Times:12:Times:B:not  reject H02 and  conclude  that  economic  growth  does  not  cause  financial  development 
32:980:69503:21:21:72:543:619:12:Times:12:Times:B:consequently denying the demand-following hypothesis. If one adopts the traditional approach to 
32:981:69598:21:21:72:543:598:12:Times:12:Times:B:include only  linear  causality,  then  one can accept   H02  and  conclude the  demand-following 
32:982:69694:21:21:72:546:577:12:Times:12:Times:B:hypothesis does not hold true for Brazil, Guatemala, India, Pakistan, South Africa, and Sri Lanka. 
32:983:69792:21:21:72:543:556:12:Times:12:Times:B:If, however, the approach proposed to  include both linear and nonlinear causality is used, then 
32:984:69886:21:20:72:542:535:12:Times:12:Times:B:the demand-following hypothesis holds true for four more countries: Brazil, India, South Africa, 
32:985:69979:20:31:72:152:515:12:Times:12:Times:B:and Sri Lanka.   
32:986:69994:31:21:72:542:484:12:Times:12:Times:B:Thus,  if  one  adopts the proposed approach to  include  both  linear  and  nonlinear  causality  to 
32:987:70095:21:20:72:542:463:12:Times:12:Times:B:determine if the supply-leading and demand-following hypotheses hold true, then only Pakistan 
32:988:70187:20:21:72:542:443:12:Times:12:Times:B:is rejected  and  both  hypotheses  are  true  for five more  countries: Turkey, Brazil, India, South 
32:989:70285:21:21:72:543:422:12:Times:12:Times:B:Africa, and Sri Lanka. In addition, if the approach we proposed to include both cointegration as 
32:990:70381:21:20:72:543:401:12:Times:12:Times:B:well  as linear  and  nonlinear  causality is adopted to  determine  whether the  supply-leading  and 
32:991:70482:20:21:72:543:381:12:Times:12:Times:B:demand-following  hypotheses hold  true,  then six more  countries would  be  included: Pakistan, 
32:992:70578:21:21:72:540:360:12:Times:12:Times:B:Turkey, Brazil, India, South  Africa,  and Sri  Lanka and we  could conclude  that either supply-
32:993:70673:21:20:72:542:339:12:Times:12:Times:B:leading or demand-following hypotheses or both hold for all countries without exception. This is 
32:994:70769:20:21:72:542:319:12:Times:12:Times:B:a very strong finding that we believe has not been reported to date by any other study. This leads 
32:995:70867:21:21:72:543:298:12:Times:12:Times:B:us to further conclude that somehow there will be some relationships between economic growth 
32:996:70959:21:21:72:542:277:12:Times:12:Times:B:and  financial  development for  any  country such  that  either  they  move  together  or  economic 
32:997:71059:21:20:72:542:256:12:Times:12:Times:B:growth causes financial development or financial development causes economic growth without 
32:998:71151:20:31:72:144:236:12:Times:12:Times:B:any exception. 
32:999:71165:31:21:72:542:205:12:Times:12:Times:B:One  may  ask why both  demand-following  and  supply-leading  theories  hold  for  most  of  the 
32:1000:71263:21:20:72:543:184:12:Times:12:Times:B:countries  studied  in  their  paper,  with  the  former  theory  holding true  for  both  Costa  Rica  and 
32:1001:71370:20:21:72:542:164:12:Times:12:Times:B:South  Africa, and the  latter  for  Guatemala,  and neither for  Pakistan.  Our  answer  is  similar  to 
32:1002:71475:21:21:72:543:143:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  one  provided in  cointegration,  more  specifically since  our  paper  is  an  applied  econometric 
32:1003:71580:21:20:72:543:122:12:Times:12:Times:B:paper and not a theoretical economic paper, we are unable to provide an answer to this question. 
32:1004:71674:20:0:72:543:102:12:Times:12:Times:B:However,  we  believe  that  there may  be some  factors,  say,  Fi,  i=1,...,p  in  financial  development 
33:1005:71783:0:21:72:543:724:12:Times:12:Times:B:and some factors, say, Ej, j=1,...,q in economic growth which could cause one another. It could 
33:1006:71876:21:20:72:543:703:12:Times:12:Times:B:be an interesting topic in the extension to study whether there are some pairs (Fi, Ej) that (a) Fi 
33:1007:71975:20:21:72:543:683:12:Times:12:Times:B:and  Ej  cause  each  other  (linearly  or  nonlinearly),  (b) Fi  causes  Ej  (linearly  or  nonlinearly), (c) 
33:1008:72086:21:21:72:543:662:12:Times:12:Times:B:some other pairs (Fi, Ej) that Ej causes Fi (linearly or nonlinearly), and (d) the rest of pairs (Fi, 
33:1009:72187:21:21:72:542:641:12:Times:12:Times:B:Ej) such that Ej and Fi do not cause each other. Thus, if any country, say, Country A, in which 
33:1010:72283:21:20:72:543:620:12:Times:12:Times:B:both demand-following and supply-leading theories hold true, this means that there should have 
33:1011:72376:20:21:72:542:600:12:Times:12:Times:B:at least one pair of (Fi, Ej) that belongs to (a), if only the supply-leading hypothesis holds true for 
33:1012:72479:21:21:72:543:579:12:Times:12:Times:B:another country, say Country B, this means that there is no pair of (Fi, Ej) that belongs to (a) and 
33:1013:72580:21:20:72:540:558:12:Times:12:Times:B:(c)  while  there is at  least  one  pair  of (Fi,  Ej)  that  belongs  to  (b),  similarly,  if  only  the demand-
33:1014:72694:20:21:72:542:538:12:Times:12:Times:B:following theory  holds for  a  country,  say  Country  C,  this  means  that  there  is  no  pair  of (Fi,  Ej) 
33:1015:72806:21:21:72:543:517:12:Times:12:Times:B:that belongs to (a) and (b) while there is at least one pair of (Fi, Ej) that belongs to (c). Lastly, if 
33:1016:72910:21:21:72:542:496:12:Times:12:Times:B:none of the demand-following and supply-leading theories hold for a given country, say Country 
33:1017:73003:21:20:72:547:475:12:Times:12:Times:B:D, this means that there is no pair of (Fi, Ej) that belongs to (a), (b) and (c) and all pairs of (Fi, Ej) 
33:1018:73110:20:31:72:211:455:12:Times:12:Times:B:for Country D belong to (d). 
33:1019:73138:31:21:72:543:424:12:Times:12:Times:B:One  may  wonder why  some  countries  have  causality,  but  no  cointegration, while  others have 
33:1020:73237:21:20:72:542:403:12:Times:12:Times:B:cointegration but no causality, and the rest have both causality and cointegration. Our answer is 
33:1021:73333:20:21:72:542:383:12:Times:12:Times:B:similar  to  our  answer provided above: since  our  paper  is  an  applied  econometric  paper,  not  a 
33:1022:73437:21:21:72:543:362:12:Times:12:Times:B:theoretical  economic  paper,  our  paper is not  be  able  to  provide  an  answer  to  this  question. 
33:1023:73541:21:20:72:542:341:12:Times:12:Times:B:However, we believe that for each class (a) to (d) in the above, we can further partition each, say 
33:1024:73641:20:21:72:542:321:12:Times:12:Times:B:Class  (a)  into  two  parts – one  part is  (a1)  in  which  all  pairs  (Fi,  Ej)  are  cointegrated  with  each 
33:1025:73754:21:21:72:542:300:12:Times:12:Times:B:other while in another part (a2) all pairs (Fi, Ej) are not cointegrated with each other. Then, if a 
33:1026:73855:21:21:72:543:279:12:Times:12:Times:B:country, say Country E, in which all pairs (Fi, Ej) belong to (a1), then Fi and Ej in Country E are 
33:1027:73955:21:20:72:543:258:12:Times:12:Times:B:cointegrated  as  well  as  cause  each  other  (linearly  or  nonlinearly).  However,  if  a  country,  say 
33:1028:74064:20:21:72:542:238:12:Times:12:Times:B:Country F,  in  which  all  pairs  (Fi,  Ej) belong  to  (a2),  then  Fi  and  Ej  in  Country F are not 
33:1029:74167:21:21:72:542:217:12:Times:12:Times:B:cointegrated but cause  each  other  (linearly  or  nonlinearly). Similar  arguments  can  be  made  to 
33:1030:74270:21:20:72:542:196:12:Times:12:Times:B:partituion  (b),  (c),  and  (d)  into  (b1),  (c1),  and  (d1)  and  (b2),  (c2),  and  (d2). This  could  also 
33:1031:74382:20:21:72:543:176:12:Times:12:Times:B:explain why the (cointegratin and/or causality)  results hold in some countries and not in others. 
33:1032:74481:21:21:72:543:155:12:Times:12:Times:B:This may also  explain  why there  is a bidirectional  relationship  in  some  countries and  only  a 
33:1033:74580:21:0:72:448:134:12:Times:12:Times:B:unidirectional relationship in others and no relationship in yet other countries. 
34:1034:74661:0:21:72:542:724:12:Times:12:Times:B:One  may question why including a nonlinear  test  allow  us  to  detect  causality  in  five  more 
34:1035:74760:21:20:72:542:703:12:Times:12:Times:B:countries. In the above, we can further partition each class, say (a) into two other groups (ai) and 
34:1036:74860:20:21:72:542:683:12:Times:12:Times:B:(aii)  such  that Fi  and  Ej  cause  each  other  linearly  when  (Fi,  Ej)  belongs  to  (ai)  and    Fi  and  Ej 
34:1037:74975:21:21:72:542:662:12:Times:12:Times:B:cause each other nonlinearly when (Fi, Ej) belongs to (aii) and for some countries, for example, 
34:1038:75071:21:21:72:543:641:12:Times:12:Times:B:for Turkey, Brazil, India, South  Africa,  and Sri  Lanka, there  are  only  nonlinear  causality 
34:1039:75168:21:20:72:542:620:12:Times:12:Times:B:relationships for  their economic  growth  and  financial  development  but  there  is  no  linear 
34:1040:75266:20:21:72:543:600:12:Times:12:Times:B:causality   for   either   from   economic   growth   to   financial   development   or   from   financial 
34:1041:75373:21:21:72:542:579:12:Times:12:Times:B:development to economic growth. Thus, when we include nonlinearity to measure their causality 
34:1042:75465:21:20:72:255:558:12:Times:12:Times:B:relationship, we have 5 more counts.

34:1045:75502:21:21:72:150:496:12:Times:12:Times:B:6. Conclusion 
34:1046:75514:21:30:86:89:475:12:Times:12:Times:A: 
34:1047:75514:30:21:72:543:445:12:Times:12:Times:B:Since financial  sectors have witnessed  a  strong  growth  trend for  many  countries in the  last  few 
34:1048:75617:21:21:72:542:424:12:Times:12:Times:B:decades, it is important to examine the relationship between financial development and economic 
34:1049:75713:21:20:72:543:403:12:Times:12:Times:B:growth   and   test   whether economic   growth   causes   financial   development   or   financial 
34:1050:75813:20:21:72:540:383:12:Times:12:Times:B:development  causes  economic  growth.  The  relationship  can  be  explained  by both demand-
34:1051:75907:21:21:72:543:362:12:Times:12:Times:B:following  and  supply-leading  theories.  The  demand-following  theory  suggests  that  financial 
34:1052:76007:21:20:72:542:341:12:Times:12:Times:B:development will lead  to economic  growth  while  the  supply-leading  theory  suggests  that 
34:1053:76101:20:21:72:543:321:12:Times:12:Times:B:financial  development  has  a  positive effect  on  economic  growth.  The  findings of  whether 
34:1054:76197:21:21:72:543:300:12:Times:12:Times:B:economic  growth  causes  financial  development  or  financial  development  causes  economic 
34:1055:76292:21:21:72:542:279:12:Times:12:Times:B:growth  is  important as  the  results  could  help  governments,  politicians,  and  other  international 
34:1056:76399:21:20:72:543:258:12:Times:12:Times:B:institutions  to  determine  the  best  polices  to  help  the  development  of  the  countries  and  reduce 
34:1057:76508:20:21:72:129:238:12:Times:12:Times:B:poverty.      
34:1058:76521:21:21:72:75:217:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
34:1059:76521:21:20:86:543:196:12:Times:12:Times:A:Other  studies  which  have  examined whether economic  growth  causes  financial  development 
34:1060:76615:20:21:72:545:176:12:Times:12:Times:B:or financial development causes economic growth have employed linear causality tests. However, 
34:1061:76708:21:21:72:543:155:12:Times:12:Times:B:the limitations  of  this  approach  in  the  literature is that this  test  alone does  not  take  into 
34:1062:76811:21:20:72:543:134:12:Times:12:Times:B:consideration the dependent, joint, and nonlinear effects among the variables. To circumvent the 
34:1063:76906:20:21:72:543:114:12:Times:12:Times:B:limitation,  in  this  paper  we  employ  the  (multivariate) linear  and  nonlinear  causality  tests  to 
34:1064:77011:21:0:72:543:93:12:Times:12:Times:B:conclude   that   there   are   either linear and   nonlinear causal   relations between   financial 
35:1065:77113:0:21:72:542:724:12:Times:12:Times:B:development and economic growth in the 13 developing countries including Brazil, Chile, China, 
35:1066:77206:21:20:72:543:703:12:Times:12:Times:B:Costa  Rica,  El  Salvador,  Guatemala,  India,  Malaysia,  Pakistan,  Peru,  South  Africa,  Sri  Lanka, 
35:1067:77312:20:21:72:542:683:12:Times:12:Times:B:Thailand,  and  Turkey.   The multivariate nonlinear  causality  tests  not  only consider both 
35:1068:77407:21:21:72:543:662:12:Times:12:Times:B:dependent and joint effects  among the variables,  but is also  able  to  detect whether this  is  any 
35:1069:77507:21:21:72:543:641:12:Times:12:Times:B:nonlinear causal relationship among the variables. In addition, we suggest using cointegration to 
35:1070:77604:21:20:72:542:620:12:Times:12:Times:B:examine  whether  there  is  any co-movement between  financial development and  economic 
35:1071:77692:20:20:72:543:600:12:Times:12:Times:B:growth and use all  the  proxies  of financial  development  and  economic  growth  to  study  the 
35:1072:77790:20:20:72:370:580:11:Times:12:Times:B:relationship between financial development and economic growth.  
35:1073:77854:20:21:107:110:560:12:Times:12:Times:A: 
35:1074:77854:21:20:107:542:539:12:Times:12:Times:A:Our   findings   from   both the Johansen   cointegration   and Engle–Granger   two-step 
35:1075:77943:20:21:72:543:519:12:Times:12:Times:B:cointegration  tests lead  us  to  conclude that financial  development  and  economic  growth are 
35:1076:78040:21:21:72:543:498:12:Times:12:Times:B:conintegrated positively in  some  countries  but  not  in  others.  This  suggests  that financial 
35:1077:78140:21:20:72:543:477:12:Times:12:Times:B:development and economic growth could move together positively in some countries but not in 
35:1078:78230:20:21:72:542:457:12:Times:12:Times:B:others and  thus, the  demand-following  and  the  supply-leading  theories  may  hold  in  some 
35:1079:78326:21:21:72:540:436:12:Times:12:Times:B:countries  but  not  in  other  countries.  To  test  whether  the  demand-following  and  the  supply-
35:1080:78429:21:21:72:543:415:12:Times:12:Times:B:leading hypotheses are not rejected, we recommend to use both bivariate and multivariate linear 
35:1081:78525:21:20:72:542:394:12:Times:12:Times:B:and nonlinear causality tests. The  results of our multivariate linear and nonlinear causality  tests 
35:1082:78627:20:21:72:543:374:12:Times:12:Times:B:are  consistent  with  that  of our  bivariate linear  and  nonlinear  causality  tests.  The results  of  our 
35:1083:78737:21:21:72:542:353:12:Times:12:Times:B:bivariate linear  and  nonlinear  causality  tests conclude  that  both demand-following  and  the 
35:1084:78836:21:20:72:542:332:12:Times:12:Times:B:supply-leading theories hold for most of the countries studied in our paper except for Costa Rica, 
35:1085:78934:20:21:72:542:312:12:Times:12:Times:B:Guatemala, Pakistan, South  Africa  in  which  only  the demand-following  theory  holds  true  for 
35:1086:79034:21:21:72:543:291:12:Times:12:Times:B:both Costa Rica and South Africa, and only the supply-leading theory holds for Guatemala, and 
35:1087:79127:21:20:72:425:270:12:Times:12:Times:B:neither demand-following nor supply-leading theories hold for Pakistan.

35:1089:79198:21:21:107:543:229:12:Times:12:Times:A:Based  on  the  obtained  results  we  recommend  that  further  studies include  nonlinear  tests 
35:1090:79297:21:21:72:542:208:12:Times:12:Times:B:to   study the   relationship   between financial   development   and   economic   growth. Without 
35:1091:79395:21:20:72:543:187:12:Times:12:Times:B:nonlinear tests, one would conclude that the supply-leading theory does not hold for Turkey and 
35:1092:79490:20:21:72:543:167:12:Times:12:Times:B:the  demand-following  theory  does  not  hold  for Brazil,  India,  South  Africa,  and  Sri  Lanka; but, 
35:1093:79595:21:21:72:543:146:12:Times:12:Times:B:this  is  not  true  if nonlinear  tests are  used  and  included in  the  analysis.  The  inclusion  of 
35:1094:79700:21:20:72:542:125:12:Times:12:Times:B:nonlinearity   in   testing   both the   demand-following   and   the   supply-leading   hypotheses is 
35:1095:79802:20:0:72:542:105:12:Times:12:Times:B:important. Thus, we recommend that future studies apply not only bivariate linear and nonlinear 
36:1096:79898:0:21:72:542:724:12:Times:12:Times:B:causality but also multivariate linear and nonlinear causality in their analysis to account for both 
36:1097:79998:21:20:72:542:703:12:Times:12:Times:B:dependent  and  joint  effects  among  variables. More  importantly,  if  nonlinearity  and  regime 
36:1098:80098:20:21:72:543:683:12:Times:12:Times:B:changes  occur  in  the  data  among  the  variables  of  concern,  one  must  rely  on  nonlinear  tests 
36:1099:80204:21:21:72:542:662:12:Times:12:Times:B:instead  of  linear  test. Therefore, by using  both  linear and  nonlinear  bivariate  and  multivariate 
36:1100:80307:21:21:72:542:641:12:Times:12:Times:B:causality  tests, one  is  able  to  obtain  further evidence  on  whether  economic  growth  predicts 
36:1101:80409:21:20:72:543:620:12:Times:12:Times:B:financial development and financial development predicts economic growth. It is very important 
36:1102:80503:20:21:72:543:600:12:Times:12:Times:B:to  understand  if it is  the financial  development which will  lead  to  economic  growth  in  these 
36:1103:80605:21:21:72:542:579:12:Times:12:Times:B:countries, the inverse situation, or if the causality is a bi-directional relationship. This could help 
36:1104:80709:21:20:72:543:558:12:Times:12:Times:B:governments,  politicians,  and  other  international  institutions  to  adopt  the  best practices in  their 
36:1105:80818:20:21:72:476:538:12:Times:12:Times:B:decision-making to help in the development of the countries and reduce poverty.      
36:1106:80902:21:31:72:75:517:12:Times:12:Times:B: 
36:1107:80902:31:21:72:542:486:12:Times:12:Times:B:However, despite  adopting the  approach  to  include  both  linear  and  nonlinear  causality  to 
36:1108:81000:21:20:72:543:465:12:Times:12:Times:B:determine if the supply-leading and demand-following hypotheses hold true, these hypothesis are 
36:1109:81095:20:31:72:269:445:12:Times:12:Times:B:still rejected for one country – Pakistan.. 
36:1110:81137:31:21:107:543:414:12:Times:12:Times:A:It  is implausible  to  consider  that there  is  no  relationship  between  financial  development 
36:1111:81236:21:20:72:543:393:12:Times:12:Times:B:and economic growth in any country. To solve this problem, we recommend that, in addition to 
36:1112:81328:20:20:72:543:373:12:Times:12:Times:B:using both (multivariate)  linear  and  nonlinear  causality to  study the  causality  relationship, 
36:1113:81426:20:20:72:543:353:11:Times:11:Times:F:cointegration should also be used to study the relationship between financial development and economic 
36:1114:81529:20:21:72:540:333:11:Times:12:Times:B:growth. If this approach is  adopted,  results  demonstrate  that  either supply-leading  or  demand-
36:1115:81629:21:20:72:542:312:12:Times:12:Times:B:following  hypotheses  or both hold true for all  countries without  any  exception.  This  is  a  very 
36:1116:81732:20:21:72:542:292:12:Times:12:Times:B:strong  finding which we  believe has  not  been  presented  in  literature The  findings  demonstrate 
36:1117:81833:21:21:72:542:271:12:Times:12:Times:B:that there  will always be  some types of relationships between economic  growth  and  financial 
36:1118:81928:21:21:72:543:250:12:Times:12:Times:B:development   such   that   either   they   move   together   or   economic   growth   causes   financial 
36:1119:82034:21:30:72:491:229:12:Times:12:Times:B:development or financial development causes economic growth without any exception. 
36:1120:82116:30:21:107:543:199:12:Times:12:Times:A:There are many applications for our findings and the government and/or politicians could 
36:1121:82202:21:21:72:542:178:12:Times:12:Times:B:benefit  from  the  results. For  example,  if a  country,  say  Country  A,  finds that  in  their  country 
36:1122:82309:21:20:72:543:157:12:Times:12:Times:B:financial development and   economic   growth are   cointegrated   or   there   is a bidirectional 
36:1123:82406:20:21:72:543:137:12:Times:12:Times:B:relationship  between financial development and  economic  growth,  then  they  can  either boost 
36:1124:82502:21:21:72:542:116:12:Times:12:Times:B:financial development or economic growth or both. However, if in another country, say Country 
36:1125:82594:21:0:72:542:95:12:Times:12:Times:B:B, they find that their financial development and economic growth are not cointegrated and there 
37:1126:82691:0:21:72:543:724:12:Times:12:Times:B:is only an unidirectional relation from, say, financial development to economic growth, then they 
37:1127:82788:21:20:72:543:703:12:Times:12:Times:B:can  concentrate  on boosting their financial development which,  in  turn,  will increase their 
37:1128:82881:20:31:72:164:683:12:Times:12:Times:B:economic growth.  
37:1129:82898:31:21:72:543:652:12:Times:12:Times:B:One  may question whether the  supply-leading  or  demand-following  theories  are  correct  or  not 
37:1130:82997:21:21:72:540:631:12:Times:12:Times:B:and  whether the employed proxies are sufficient to  reflect  the  hidden  causality.  The  supply-
37:1131:83094:21:20:72:543:610:12:Times:12:Times:B:leading  or  demand-following  theories have  been  used  since Robinson  (1952) and  others have 
37:1132:83191:20:21:72:542:590:12:Times:12:Times:B:used the  theory  and, many  authors  have used the same proxies of  financial  development and 
37:1133:83285:21:21:72:543:569:12:Times:12:Times:B:economic  growth since Demetriades  and  Hussein  (1996). To  our  knowledge, neither  the  theory 
37:1134:83384:21:20:72:543:548:12:Times:12:Times:B:nor the proxies have been rejected However, it is a good idea to doubt whether the theory works 
37:1135:83478:20:21:72:543:528:12:Times:12:Times:B:and  improve  the  theory and  doubt  whether  the  proxies  are  good  enough  and  propose  better 
37:1136:83578:21:31:72:482:507:12:Times:12:Times:B:proxies. This is a good extension to the study but it is beyond the scope of our paper.
