2:26:1137:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:In this paper, we characterize the multi-faceted health of the elderly and understand how health along
2:27:1239:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:multiple dimensions has changed over time.  Our data are from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey,
2:28:1341:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:1991-2007.  We show that 19 measures of health can be combined into three broad categories: a first
2:29:1440:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:dimension representing severe physical and social incapacity such as difficulty dressing or bathing;
2:30:1540:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:a second dimension representing less severe difficulty such as walking long distances or lifting heavy
2:31:1642:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:objects; and a third dimension representing vision and hearing impairment.  These dimensions have
2:32:1739:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:changed at different rates over time.  The first and third have declined rapidly over time, while the
2:33:1840:14:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:second has not.  The improvement in health is not due to differential mortality of the sick or a new
2:34:1940:14:14:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:generation of more healthy people entering old age.  Rather, the aging process itself is associated with
2:35:2044:14:42:72:486:462:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:less rapid deterioration in health.  We speculate about the factors that may lead to this.

3:51:2399:28:28:108:530:667:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: Understanding changes in the health of the elderly is a central policy issue.  A healthier 
3:52:2490:28:27:71:508:639:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:elderly population is able to work to later ages, spends less on medical care each year, and 
3:53:2583:27:28:71:521:612:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:requires less informal care from family and friends.  Efforts to promote population health are 
3:54:2678:28:27:72:415:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:therefore central to many health reform proposals (Pardes et al., 1999). 
3:55:2751:27:28:108:519:557:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: By many metrics, the health of the elderly has improved over time.  For example, the 
3:56:2836:28:28:72:523:529:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:share of elderly people with basic physical impairments such as difficulty walking around the 
3:57:2930:28:27:72:530:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:home or bathing has declined markedly over the past two decades.  By other metrics, however, 
3:58:3023:27:28:72:531:474:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the health of the elderly is worsening.  Problems with more advanced functional measures such 
3:59:3117:28:27:72:522:446:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:as stooping and walking moderate distances have increased over time, and obesity among the 
3:60:3208:27:28:72:403:419:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:elderly has soared along with weight in the non-elderly population.   
3:61:3278:28:28:108:511:391:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: Researchers have attempted to combine indicators of the health of the elderly into a 
3:62:3363:28:27:72:533:363:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:single summary measure, but these summaries are generally ad hoc and lacking in nuance.  The 
3:63:3456:27:28:72:498:336:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:most common single measure of disability is whether the person has any impairments in 
3:64:3542:28:27:72:515:308:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Activities of Daily Living (ADLs, such as bathing or dressing) or Instrumental Activities of 
3:65:3635:27:28:72:517:281:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Daily Living (IADLs, such as doing light housework or managing money).  In the Medicare 
3:66:3723:28:27:72:531:253:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Current Beneficiary Survey, which we analyze in this paper, the share of the elderly population 
3:67:3819:27:28:72:518:226:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:that is disabled by this definition has declined from 53 percent in 1991 to 42 percent in 2007 
3:68:3914:28:28:72:527:198:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:(figure 1).  This summary measure exhibits somewhat different trends in different surveys and 
3:69:4008:28:27:72:514:170:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:for different measures of health (Schoeni et al., 2001; Manton and Gu, 2001), however, and 
3:70:4099:27:28:72:519:143:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:ignores measures of functional impairment (e.g., can the person walk a reasonable distance), 
3:71:4192:28:27:72:535:115:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:cognitive problems such as memory loss, and sensory impairments such as difficulty seeing and 
3:72:4286:27:0:72:114:88:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:hearing. 
4:73:4297:0:23:543:546:468:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: 
4:74:4297:23:12:112:540:445:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:?:Note: Disability is measured as the share of people reporting at least one impairment in Activities of Daily

4:78:4647:13:28:108:111:397:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: 
4:79:4647:28:28:108:538:369:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:At the same time, there is a history of more theoretically grounded measures of disability 
4:80:4738:28:27:72:515:341:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:– as with the Grade of Membership (GOM) model proposed by Ken Manton and colleagues 
4:81:4822:27:28:72:508:314:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:(Lamb, 1996; Manton et al., 1998; Woodbury et al., 1978; Manton et al., 1994).  But these 
4:82:4912:28:27:72:511:286:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:models met resistance because of their complexity.  Perhaps as a result, they have not been 
4:83:5004:27:28:72:155:259:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:widely pursued.  
4:84:5021:28:28:108:535:231:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: In this paper, we characterize the multi-faceted health of the elderly and understand how 
4:85:5111:28:27:72:506:203:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:health along multiple dimensions has changed over time.  Our data are from the Medicare 
4:86:5199:27:28:72:536:176:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), a rotating panel of nearly 12,000 elderly people annually.  
4:87:5294:28:27:72:534:148:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:The survey started in 1991; we employ data through 2007.  The MCBS has the virtue that it is a 
4:88:5389:27:28:72:518:121:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:person-based sample, not a housing-unit based sample.  Thus, it samples and follows people 
4:89:5480:28:0:72:346:93:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:when they move into nursing homes and records death.

5:96:5671:0:27:108:529:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: We first consider how to optimally combine different measures of health into a smaller 
5:97:5758:27:28:72:514:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:number of summary measures.  Of course, the best way to summarize multiple measures of 
5:98:5845:28:27:72:529:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:health depends on the question being asked.  The optimal measure to predict medical spending 
5:99:5938:27:28:72:533:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:may be somewhat different than the optimal measure to predict health transitions, for example.  
5:100:6034:28:28:72:541:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:We use a somewhat ad hoc approach and estimate factor models for 19 indicators of health in the 
5:101:6130:28:27:72:505:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:community-based population.  These measures include specific ADL impairments, IADL 
5:102:6213:27:28:72:388:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:impairments, functional impairments, and sensory impairments.   
5:103:6277:28:27:108:497:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: We show that these 19 dimensions can be compressed into three broad summary 
5:104:6353:27:28:72:519:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:measures.  The dominant factor is impairment in very basic physical and social tasks such as 
5:105:6446:28:28:71:516:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:dressing, eating, transferring in and out of bed, preparing meals, doing light housework, and 
5:106:6540:28:27:71:521:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:managing money.  This encompasses many of the ADLs and IADLs, but not all.  The second 
5:107:6627:27:28:71:528:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:factor loads heavily on functional limitations and includes measures such as walking moderate 
5:108:6721:28:27:71:533:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:distances, stooping, and reaching.  The third dimension is sensory impairments – trouble seeing 
5:109:6817:27:28:71:142:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and hearing.    
5:110:6833:28:27:107:541:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: After determining these factors, we analyze the evolution of these health dimensions over 
5:111:6923:27:28:71:515:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:time.  We show that the set of physical and social limitations and sensory impairments have 
5:112:7015:28:28:71:533:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:declined rapidly over time.  Functional ability was flat or increasing, after declining early in the 
5:113:7116:28:27:71:138:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:time period.   
5:114:7131:27:28:107:516:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: These results suggest many possible patterns.  One possibility is that the community-
5:115:7216:28:27:71:536:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:dwelling population is increasingly concentrated among the less severely ill, with more severely 
5:116:7313:27:28:71:537:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:ill individuals in nursing homes or having died.  We show, however, that composition changes – 
5:117:7408:28:28:71:539:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:both people leaving the sample and new people entering the sample – cannot explain a change in 
5:118:7503:28:0:71:541:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the health of the community-dwelling population.  In a second scenario, it may be that people are

6:120:7700:27:28:72:299:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:medical care or other environmental changes.   
6:121:7747:28:27:108:531:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: We investigate the evolution of health states in the final part of the paper.  In particular, 
6:122:7841:27:28:72:482:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:we estimate models explaining within-person health trends over time, controlling for 
6:123:7926:28:28:72:530:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:demographic characteristics and year dummy variables.  We examine health trends in the early 
6:124:8019:28:27:72:519:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:years in the sample (1991-96), middle years in the sample (1997-2001) and later years in the 
6:125:8112:27:28:72:528:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:sample (2002-2007).  We show that health deteriorates less rapidly in later years of the sample 
6:126:8208:28:27:72:515:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:than in earlier years.  This sets up an exploration of what shocks to health are occurring less 
6:127:8304:27:28:72:311:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:rapidly, which is the subject of ongoing research. 
6:128:8355:28:28:107:534:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: This paper is structured as follows.  The first section describes the data we employ.  The 
6:129:8446:28:27:72:527:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:second section presents information on trends in elderly health and reports the results of factor 
6:130:8544:27:28:72:520:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:analyses for the 1991-2007 period.  The third section shows the evolution of summary health 
6:131:8636:28:27:72:530:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:measures of health over time, and the fourth section examines within-person changes.  The last 
6:132:8731:27:28:72:163:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:section concludes. 
6:133:8750:28:28:72:75:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: 
6:134:8750:28:27:72:161:294:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:C:I. The Data  
6:135:8763:27:28:108:509:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:Our primary data source is the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS). The 
6:136:8842:28:27:72:522:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:MCBS, sponsored by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), is a nationally 
6:137:8931:27:28:72:527:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:representative survey of aged, disabled, and institutionalized Medicare beneficiaries, that over-
6:138:9028:28:27:72:506:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:samples the very old (aged 85 or older) and disabled Medicare beneficiaries. Since we are 
6:139:9118:27:28:72:528:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:interested in disability among the elderly, we restrict our sample to the population aged 65 and 
6:140:9215:28:0:72:103:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:older. 
7:141:9224:0:27:108:495:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:While a number of surveys have measures of disability in the elderly population 
7:142:9304:27:28:72:508:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:(Freedman et al., 2002), including the National Health Interview Study and the Health and 
7:143:9394:28:27:71:533:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Retirement Study, the MCBS has a number of advantages.  First, the sample size is large, about 
7:144:9489:27:28:72:537:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:10,000 to 18,000 people annually.  In addition, the MCBS samples people regardless of whether 
7:145:9583:28:28:72:539:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:they live in a household or a long-term care facility, or switch between the two during the course 
7:146:9682:28:27:72:536:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of the survey period.  Finally, the set of health questions are very broad, encompassing health in 
7:147:9781:27:28:72:154:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:many domains.   
7:148:9797:28:27:108:495:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: The MCBS started as a longitudinal survey in 1991.  In 1992 and 1993, the only 
7:149:9876:27:28:72:534:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:supplemental individuals added were to replace people lost to attrition and to account for newly 
7:150:9973:28:28:72:512:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:enrolled beneficiaries.  Beginning in 1994, the MCBS began a transition to a rotating panel 
7:151:10065:28:27:72:515:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:design, with a four year sample inclusion.  About one-third of the sample was rotated out in 
7:152:10158:27:28:72:538:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:1994, and new members were included in the sample.  The remainder of the original sample was 
7:153:10251:28:27:72:542:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:rotated out in subsequent years.  We use all interviews that are available for each person from the 
7:154:10351:27:28:72:329:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:start of the survey in 1991 through the 2007 survey.   
7:155:10406:28:27:108:525:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: The MCBS has two samples: a set of people who were enrolled for the entire year (the 
7:156:10491:27:28:72:533:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Access to Care sample) and a set of ever enrolled beneficiaries (the Cost and Use sample).  The 
7:157:10587:28:28:72:528:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:latter differs from the former in including people who die during the year and new additions to 
7:158:10683:28:27:72:532:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the Medicare population.  The primary data that we use are from the health status questionnaire 
7:159:10779:27:28:72:508:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:administered in the fall survey, which defines the Access to Care sample.  We thus use the 
7:160:10870:28:27:72:537:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Access to Care data.  We supplement this with information about death in the year following the 
7:161:10966:27:28:72:503:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:fall interview, taken from the Cost and Use data.  Because the Cost and Use data are only 
7:162:11056:28:28:72:527:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:available through 2006, our analysis of deaths, nursing home transitions, and loss to follow-up 
7:163:11152:28:0:72:341:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:go only through that year.  Other data go through 2007. 
8:164:11210:0:27:108:522:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: Table 1 shows the number of individuals in the sample by year or interview and wave 
8:165:11294:27:28:72:515:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:(number of interviews for that person).  The sample of new beneficiaries is low in 1992 and

9:249:15216:28:27:72:504:142:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:population report difficulty stooping, crouching, or kneeling, along with 93 percent of the 
9:250:15308:27:28:72:541:115:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:institutionalized.  For other questions, positive responses are reported by a quarter to a half of the 
9:251:15411:28:0:72:534:87:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:population.  Very severe physical impairments such as help needed bathing or toileting are very 
10:252:15509:0:27:72:511:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:common for the institutionalized, but rare in the community.  The same is true about social 
10:253:15601:27:28:72:520:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:indicators such as managing money and shopping, with the exception that there is significant 
10:254:15694:28:27:72:526:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:difficulty doing heavy housework among people living in the community.  About one-third of 
10:255:15785:27:28:72:307:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:both groups report difficulties seeing or hearing. 
10:256:15836:28:28:108:538:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: Figure 2 shows the trend in health for each of the dimensions identified in Table 2, along 
10:257:15927:28:27:72:531:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:with the share of people living in a nursing home.  For each dimension, we determine the share 
10:258:16022:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of people who report having being impaired in at least one specific item, in each year of the data.  
10:259:16123:28:27:72:518:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:For example, our ADL trend is the share of people in each year who report at least one ADL 
10:260:16214:27:28:72:532:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:impairment.  In this analysis, we do not distinguish between one or more than one impairment.  
10:261:16309:28:28:72:275:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Our models in the next section will do so. 
10:262:16352:28:27:108:517:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: There are very different patterns for the different dimensions of health.  The share of 
10:263:16440:27:28:72:508:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:people who are in a nursing home, who have an ADL or IADL impairment, or who have a 
10:264:16524:28:27:72:531:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:sensory impairment has declined over time.  The decline in nursing home residence is about 30 
10:265:16618:27:28:72:511:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:percent.  The reduction in ADL impairment is also about 30 percent, while the reduction in 
10:266:16709:28:27:72:534:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:IADL impairment is about 20 percent.  Sensory impairments declined by 24 percent.  The share 
10:267:16802:27:28:72:441:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of the population with functional limitations, in contrast, was relatively flat.  
10:268:16884:28:28:108:536:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: The Appendix shows the specific items that contribute to the trends for each dimension.  
10:269:16973:28:27:72:532:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:There is surprisingly little variation within the specific items in each domain.  Almost all of the 
10:270:17073:27:28:72:529:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:ADL and IADL impairments have declined, as have both of the sensory impairments.  Most of 
10:271:17163:28:27:72:520:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the functional limitations have been relatively flat, as have the two cognitive measures.  This 
10:272:17259:27:28:72:532:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:suggests that the grouping shown in Figure 1 may be relatively accurate as a true description of

12:316:17834:27:28:108:524:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:As noted above, most research defines disability as a binary variable based on the self-
12:317:17922:28:27:72:506:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:report of any ADL or IADL impairment. While simple to implement, this measure lacks a 
12:318:18008:27:28:72:536:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:theoretically rigorous foundation. Moreover, a binary measure does not capture heterogeneity in 
12:319:18104:28:28:72:524:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the population.  For many purposes, we care about the distribution of health in addition to the 
12:320:18200:28:27:72:525:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:proportion with any specific limitation.  At the same time, there is a literature (e.g. Verbrugge 
12:321:18298:27:28:72:542:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and Jette, 1994) arguing for a distinction between functional status (measures of specific physical 
12:322:18398:28:27:72:537:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:functioning) and disability (the ability to engage in the activities typically expected of a person). 
12:323:18500:27:28:72:507:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Within this latter spirit, we examine the different dimensions of health among the elderly.  
12:324:18593:28:28:108:542:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:The optimal way to combine the different measures depends on the purpose for which the 
12:325:18680:28:27:72:520:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:data are being used. If one were interested in forecasting medical spending, for example, one 
12:326:18774:27:28:72:511:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:would weight the questions by how much they are associated with medical service use. We

12:328:18956:27:28:72:541:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:health impairments that people have?  Those domains can then be used to assess the health status 
12:329:19053:28:27:72:516:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of the elderly. To do this, we will use factor analysis to characterize responses into different 
12:330:19150:27:28:72:196:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:domains of functioning.   
12:331:19176:28:28:108:518:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:Formally, denote yij as the response to question j for individual i. Suppose there are J 
12:332:19265:28:27:72:532:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:questions total (J=19 in our setting). We imagine that these health states are a linear function of 
12:333:19365:27:28:71:533:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:K different unobserved or latent factors, denoted Fik.  We fit a latent variable model of the form 
12:334:19464:28:27:72:345:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:(e.g., Bartholomew, 1987; and Knol and Berger, 1991):

13:339:19680:27:28:72:519:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:prevalence of limitations in the population (for example, limitations climbing stairs are more 
13:340:19775:28:27:72:541:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:common that limitations in bathing) and the γkj’s are factor loadings that describe the relationship 
13:341:19875:27:28:72:500:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:between unobserved factor k and question j. Unobserved factors are assumed to follow a 
13:342:19962:28:28:72:519:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Multivariate Normal distribution. The latent variable model described by (1) is similar to the

13:344:20147:27:28:71:541:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:dimensions of disability (Lamb, 1996; Manton et al., 1998; Woodbury et al., 1978; Manton et al., 
13:345:20244:28:27:72:112:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:1994).   
13:346:20253:27:28:108:517:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: We can fit this model provided K<J.  Empirically, because the data tend to be highly 
13:347:20338:28:28:72:528:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:correlated and we have 19 dimensions of health, a small number of factors is associated with a 
13:348:20433:28:27:71:248:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:wide range of variation in the data.

13:351:20654:27:28:71:524:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:significant factors.  These three also have natural economic and demographic interpretations.  
13:352:20749:28:27:72:225:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:We thus work with those three.

16:482:23899:0:27:108:531:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:We next plot the factor scores by age.  If all of the health improvement were at younger 
16:483:23988:27:28:72:514:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:elderly ages, the explanation would likely fall in the medical and environmental factors that 
16:484:24082:28:27:71:521:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:influence health of the working age population.  Conversely, improvements in health at older 
16:485:24175:27:28:72:526:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:ages raise the possibility that conditions at those older ages are the driving factor (though they 
16:486:24274:28:28:72:504:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:don’t prove it, as the literature on the impact of in utero conditions shows; Barker, 1992).

17:522:25076:0:27:108:534:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:Since there are more young elderly than old elderly, the contribution of the older elderly 
17:523:25167:27:28:72:533:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:to the reduction in total disability is perhaps overstated.  Another metric is to evaluate the share 
17:524:25268:28:27:72:519:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:of the total improvement in the health of the elderly is accounted for by improvements in the 
17:525:25362:27:28:72:522:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:health of each age group.  At any time period t, F(t) = Σa pct(a,t) * F(a,t), where pct(a,t) is the 
17:526:25462:28:28:72:532:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:percent of the population at time t that is in age group a.  The contribution of age group a to the 
17:527:25562:28:27:72:528:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:total change in health between two time periods is then pct(a,0)*ΔF(a), and the total change in 
17:528:25658:27:28:72:541:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the population is Σa pct(a,0)*ΔF(a).  The ratio of those two, pct(a,0)*ΔF(a) / Σa pct(a,0)*ΔF(a), is 
17:529:25759:28:27:72:532:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the contribution of health improvements at age group a to the total change in population health. 
17:530:25856:27:28:108:523:488:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f2:?: Figure 6 shows these contribution shares for factors 1 and 3, the dimensions on which 
17:531:25942:28:28:72:529:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:health is improving most significantly, along with the population distribution by age.  For both 
17:532:26039:28:27:72:542:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:factors 1 and 3, the oldest old contribute disproportionately to health improvements.  People aged 
17:533:26138:27:28:72:517:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:85 and older are 14 percent of the population in 1991 but account for 30 to 50 percent of the 
17:534:26232:28:27:72:529:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:health improvement.  This suggests that late life health and social conditions may be important 
17:535:26328:27:28:72:531:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:contributors to population health.  At minimum, any theory of health improvement will have to 
17:536:26422:28:212:72:229:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:account for this age differential.

18:552:26699:27:28:108:502:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:The central economic challenge is to understand why health improves in so many 
18:553:26778:28:27:72:501:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:dimensions.  We consider two explanations for improved health.  The first explanation is 
18:554:26867:27:28:72:502:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:composition change: people with severe health impairments may be more likely to die or 
18:555:26954:28:28:72:510:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:transition into a nursing home over time.  Alternatively, new entrants to the survey may be 
18:556:27046:28:27:72:539:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:healthier than the people they replace.  Either of these situations would improve the health of the 
18:557:27146:27:28:72:542:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:community-dwelling population because of selection.  Second, people may be impaired along the 
18:558:27240:28:27:72:534:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:same dimensions, but impairment may not progress to more severe stages as frequently as it did 
18:559:27335:27:28:72:521:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:formerly, either because of person-specific aging trends (e.g., richer people can manage their 
18:560:27430:28:28:72:518:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:chronic conditions better), or because of population-wide shocks (a new treatment for vision 
18:561:27523:28:27:72:143:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:impairment).   
18:562:27538:27:28:108:497:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:Figure 7 shows a schematic of the model that we estimate.  We start off with the 
18:563:27619:28:27:72:514:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:community-dwelling population in year t.  Between t and t+1, two things happen.  First, the 
18:564:27711:27:28:72:510:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:sample changes.  Some people leave the sample, either through death, loss to follow-up, or 
18:565:27802:28:27:72:484:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:nursing home entry, and others enter.  The combination of these two transitions is the 
18:566:27889:27:28:72:541:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:composition effect.  Second, new health shocks occur (for example, a heart attack or diagnosis of 
18:567:27987:28:28:72:497:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:cancer) and old health conditions exert an effect on health.  An example of the latter is a 
18:568:28079:28:27:72:486:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:continued deterioration that might occur from untreated arthritis.  The combination of 
18:569:28166:27:28:72:490:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:composition changes and health changes among the existing population yields the new 
18:570:28250:28:27:72:192:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:population health at t+1.

19:592:28936:27:28:72:327:201:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:correlated.  For simplicity, we assume they are not.   
19:593:28991:28:28:108:543:173:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: For new entrants, the issue is whether people who are new to the survey are healthier than

20:612:29638:28:27:108:520:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: We then consider the model for health of the continuing population.  We describe the 
20:613:29723:27:28:72:426:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:evolution of health for the surviving, community-dwelling population as:

20:615:29796:27:28:72:553:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B: Fkit = α0ik + α1ik t + α2ik hit + Yeart γk + εkit      (6)

20:617:29855:28:27:72:509:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:The factor score for an individual depends on their demographics (α0ik), aging (t), new and 
20:618:29947:27:28:72:366:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:ongoing health shocks (hit), and year dummy variables (γk).   
20:619:30009:28:27:108:530:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: It is natural for α0ik to vary in the population, for both measurable reasons (older people 
20:620:30101:27:28:72:488:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:are sicker than younger people) and unmeasurable reasons (random differences across 
20:621:30185:28:27:71:499:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:individuals).  Similarly, aging and health shocks may affect different people differently.  
20:622:30277:27:28:71:525:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Generally, we parameterize αjik (j=0, 1, and 2 – corresponding to the three α terms in equation 
20:623:30373:28:28:72:148:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:(6)) as follows:

20:627:30442:27:28:72:525:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Equation (7) relates the level and trend in health to a constant, person-specific factors, and the 
20:628:30541:28:0:72:133:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:time period. 
21:629:30557:0:27:108:542:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: In principle, the εkit errors may be correlated (factor scores in different domains), as might 
21:630:30652:27:28:72:528:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the ξjik errors (coefficients on different control variables).  A general formulation would model 
21:631:30750:28:27:72:531:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:these as ε ~ N(0, Σ) and ξ ~ N(0, Ψ).  For this analysis, we assume that the ε’s are independent, 
21:632:30848:27:28:72:539:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:as are the ξ’s.  Also for simplicity, we assume that the only coefficients that vary over people are 
21:633:30949:28:28:72:525:598:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f2:B:α0ik and α1ik – the constant term and the coefficient on the time trend.  We parameterize α0ik as 
21:634:31047:28:27:71:518:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:depending on demographics and an error term (i.e. α0ik = β00k + Xit β01k + ξ0ik) and the β12k as 
21:635:31144:27:28:71:541:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:differing in three time periods: 1991-96; 1997-2001; and 2002-07 (i.e. α1ik = β10k + Periodit β12k + 
21:636:31244:28:27:72:541:515:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f2:B:ξ1ik).  Finally, for this analysis, we leave out the health measures hit.  We do this not because they 
21:637:31347:27:28:72:524:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:are unimportant, but because we wish to focus on the aging effect α1ik.  We therefore estimate 
21:638:31442:28:28:72:284:460:144:g_d0_f8:144:g_d0_f2:B:β00k, β01k, β10k, β12k, var(ξ0ik), and var(ξ1ik).   
21:639:31494:28:27:72:533:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:            Our            X vector consists of basic demographics.  We include dummy variables for age and 
21:640:31602:27:28:72:523:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:gender (a dummy for aged 65-69,70-74, 75-79, 80-84, and 85+ interacted with gender), and a 
21:641:31693:28:27:72:523:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:dummy for non-whites.  We also include year dummy variables.  Future work could naturally 
21:642:31783:27:28:72:539:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:incorporate a richer array of variables, including health shocks to the individual and other family 
21:643:31883:28:27:72:494:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:members, changes in socioeconomic status such as reductions in income or wealth, and 
21:644:31968:27:28:71:205:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:environmental conditions.

21:647:32037:27:28:107:542:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: All three exits from the community sample are common.  About 1.5 percent of the elderly 
21:648:32125:28:27:71:531:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:population transitions into a nursing home in any year.  This is smaller than the share of people 
21:649:32223:27:28:71:528:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:who are living in a nursing home at a point in time (around 5 to 6 percent) because of the long-
21:650:32319:28:28:71:532:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:stayers.  We also exclude from this analysis people who died between one survey wave and the 
21:651:32412:28:0:72:517:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:next, since we do not know about nursing home utilization for them.  About 4 percent of the 
22:652:32507:0:27:72:535:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:population dies in any year (this is among the community-dwelling sample; a larger share of the 
22:653:32603:27:28:72:540:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:institutionalized population dies).  Finally, about 12 percent of the population is lost to follow-up 
22:654:32705:28:27:72:523:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:each year.  This share is particularly high early in the sample, when the initial population was 
22:655:32802:27:28:72:541:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:purposely phased out.  Outside of those years, the average loss to follow-up is about 10 percent.   
22:656:32902:28:28:107:532:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: The primary question we explore is whether people who are sicker (that is, score higher 
22:657:32990:28:27:72:532:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:on the factor score) depart the sample more frequently, and whether this is particularly likely to 
22:658:33089:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:occur over time.  Thus, we interact the factor scores in equations (2)-(4) with the period dummies 
22:659:33188:28:27:71:528:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:noted above: 1991-96, 1997-01, 2002-06.  We then test whether being sick has a greater effect 
22:660:33282:27:28:71:280:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:on sample exit in later years of the sample. 
22:661:33327:28:28:107:538:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: Table 3 shows the estimates of death, transitions to a nursing home, or loss to follow-up.  
22:662:33419:28:27:71:514:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Since we have repeat observations on the same individual, we cluster the standard errors by 
22:663:33511:27:28:72:536:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:individual – as we do in table 5 as well.  In the first column, factor 1 is particularly predictive of 
22:664:33614:28:27:72:522:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:mortality.  An increase of 1 standard deviation raises mortality rates by 3 percent.  Factor 1 is 
22:665:33712:27:28:72:534:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:mildly more predictive of death in the later years of the sample than the earlier years.  An F-test 
22:666:33812:28:27:72:483:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:rejects that that the coefficients in later years are the same as in earlier years.  But the

22:671:34247:28:27:72:517:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:later time period, but keeping the X’s the same as in the early time period.  We then average

24:781:37446:28:28:72:511:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:percent of the total decline.  For factor 3, the predicted change is only 1 percent of the total

27:925:42142:28:27:72:534:168:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:increases by .065 each year (.065 standard deviations) during the early phase of the sample, and 
27:926:42239:27:28:72:256:141:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:factor 3 increases by .019 each year.   
27:927:42279:28:27:108:537:113:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: The rate of decline in health has slowed over time.  Relative to the increase in factor 1 of 
27:928:42372:27:0:72:542:86:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:.065 each year, as shown in the first time period, the increase is only .034 in the more recent time 
28:929:42476:0:27:72:542:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:period.  This reduction, which occurs after 1997, accounts for a large change in health over time.  
28:930:42576:27:28:72:522:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:Had the decrement to health stayed the same after 1996 as before 1996, health in 2007 would 
28:931:42668:28:27:72:513:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:have been one-third of a standard deviation worse.  Another way to show the impact of this 
28:932:42759:27:28:72:534:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:change is to consider the year effects in figure 8.  While there are strong year trends in factors 1 
28:933:42860:28:28:72:410:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and 2 up through 1996, there are no consistent year trends afterwards.

28:937:42931:28:27:108:525:249:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:Health in the third dimension also deteriorates less rapidly over time, with roughly the 
28:938:43020:27:28:72:537:222:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:same pattern.  Factor 3 increases by 0.019 per year in the early time period, and then declines by 
28:939:43119:28:27:72:540:194:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:.016 per year in the later time period.  There is an unexplained year trend in the early time period 
28:940:43220:27:28:72:531:167:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:and again between 2001 and 2003.  Other than those time periods, there is little aggregate drift. 
28:941:43318:28:28:108:504:139:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?:Not only does the rate of decline in health slow, but health is actually estimated to

29:957:43937:28:28:108:514:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: Our results provide important evidence on the well-noted decline in disability in the 
29:958:44023:28:27:72:509:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:elderly population.  We show that health has several dimensions: one that is largely severe 
29:959:44115:27:28:72:535:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:physical and social impairment; a second that is less severe physical limitations; and a third that 
29:960:44215:28:27:71:529:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:encompasses sensory impairments.  The first and third of these dimensions are improving over 
29:961:44308:27:28:71:220:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:time, while the second is not.   
29:962:44341:28:28:108:506:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: The reason for the improvement in health is complex.  On the one hand, the health 
29:963:44423:28:27:71:524:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:improvement is not a result of sample or demographic changes.  Younger people are healthier 
29:964:44515:27:28:71:539:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:than younger people used to be, but the same is true of older people.  Rather, health is improving 
29:965:44614:28:27:71:539:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:because individual health deteriorates less rapidly now than in the past.  We do not know exactly 
29:966:44712:27:28:71:524:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:why this occurs, but we show that the average trend masks significant heterogeneity.  Even as 
29:967:44806:28:27:71:546:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:health deteriorates overall as people age, health is improving for a significant minority of people.   
29:968:44909:27:28:107:522:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:?: The next step is to develop a richer model of the change in health over time.  To what 
29:969:44996:28:28:71:502:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:extent is the improvement in health a result of fewer new conditions developing, existing 
29:970:45086:28:27:71:528:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:problems being cared for better, or changes in the social and environmental circumstances that 
29:971:45181:27:28:71:461:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:B:the elderly face?  Considering these questions is a fruitful area for further study.
