2:33:1786:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:How   does   investors'   information   about   a   country's   fundamentals,   and   the   fact   that   this 
2:34:1897:14:14:72:545:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:information may  be  asymmetrically  held,  affect  a  country's  financing  cost?  Motivated  by  this 
2:35:2000:14:14:72:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:question, and by the observation that sovereign bonds are usually auctioned in large lots to a large 
2:36:2100:14:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:number   of   potential investors,   we   develop   a   novel   model   of   auctions   with   asymmetric 
2:37:2205:14:14:71:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:information that relies on price-taking and rational expectations. We first characterize sovereign 
2:38:2303:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:bond prices for different degrees of asymmetric information under two commonly-used protocols: 
2:39:2397:14:14:72:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:discriminatory-price  auctions  and  uniform-price auctions.  We  show  that  there  is  trade-off 
2:40:2495:14:14:72:546:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:between  these  protocols  if  information  is  sufficiently  asymmetric: expected  bond  yields  are 
2:41:2596:14:14:72:545:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:higher when pricing is discriminatory, but yield volatility is higher when pricing is uniform.  We 
2:42:2694:14:14:72:545:462:12:Times:12:Times:C:then  study  endogenous  information  acquisition  and  find  that  (i)  discriminatory auctions  may 
2:43:2795:14:14:72:545:448:12:Times:12:Times:C:display  multiple  welfare-ranked  informational  equilibria,  and  (ii)  investors  are  less  likely to 
2:44:2900:14:28:72:267:434:12:Times:12:Times:C:acquire information in uniform auctions.

3:67:3380:0:34:72:197:707:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:1    Introduction
3:68:3397:34:22:72:540:673:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Governments finance their fiscal needs by selling bonds in sovereign debt auctions.  In
3:69:3484:22:22:72:540:651:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:these auctions, a large number of bonds are usually sold at one time to a large number
3:70:3570:22:21:72:540:629:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  investors.   Investors  can  submit  multiple  bids  and  are  often  free  to  try  and  buy  as
3:71:3671:21:22:72:539:608:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:many units of the bonds as they can afford.1Given the set of submitted bids, auctions
3:72:3756:22:22:72:540:586:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:constitute a series of rules that determine the price(s) of newly issued sovereign bonds
3:73:3844:22:21:72:540:564:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  the  corresponding  revenues  for  the  government  (or,  equivalently,  the  future  debt
3:74:3939:21:22:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:burden implied by the auction outcome). The results of sovereign debt auctions thus play
3:75:4027:22:22:72:540:521:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a critical role in determining governments’ cost of financing deficits, their implementation
3:76:4119:22:21:72:540:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of monetary policy, and even the extent to which they can successfully navigate internal
3:77:4207:21:22:72:266:478:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and external macroeconomic shocks.
3:78:4241:22:22:89:539:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Understanding the evolution of primary market sovereign bond prices has proven to
3:79:4322:22:21:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be  challenging,  however.   Figure  1  illustrates  this  problem  using  interest  rate  data  for
3:80:4422:21:22:72:540:413:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:91-day CETES bonds issued by the Mexican government between 1978 and 2016.  These
3:81:4503:22:22:72:540:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bonds are domestically denominated, sold with small face values, and in large lots, to a
3:82:4591:22:21:72:540:369:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wide variety of investors, using auctions that alternated between discriminating (shaded
3:83:4679:21:22:72:539:348:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the figure) and uniform price protocols.2During the long period displayed in the fig-
3:84:4767:22:22:71:539:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ure, annual bond yields went through periods of high turbulence (coincident to events
3:85:4852:22:21:71:539:304:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:such as the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s and the ”Tequila Crisis” of 1995) and
3:86:4941:21:22:71:539:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:periods of prolonged stability (the 2000s).  Nevertheless, it has been difficult to attribute
3:87:5034:22:22:71:539:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:these price movements to shocks to particular set of “fundamentals,” such as GDP growth
3:88:5121:22:21:71:539:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or  the  government’s  debt  service  policy.   Rather,  certain  shocks  seem  to  be  important
3:89:5218:21:22:71:539:218:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:drivers of bond yields during certain times but irrelevant in other periods.   Decipher-
3:90:5306:22:19:71:539:196:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ing the right mapping from shocks to prices is complicated by the fact that shocks will

3:92:5496:16:12:72:540:161:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:bids or tenders, many of which come from the 37 primary deals. They also receive 850-900 noncompetitive
3:93:5599:12:8:72:464:149:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:tenders through the book-entry system and another 19,000 through TREASURY DIRECT.

3:95:5779:16:12:72:540:125:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:2010.  Cetes remain among the most important public debt instruments in Mexico.  In 2001, for example,
3:96:5881:12:12:72:540:113:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:Cetes alone represented 25% of all government securities, and were auctioned 180 times to 3,581 participat-
3:97:5988:12:11:72:540:101:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:ing bidders.  Mexico has switched the auction protocol in October 5, 2017 to uniform price auctions after
3:98:6093:11:0:72:348:90:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:more than two decades of using discriminatory-price auctions.
4:99:6155:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:typically differ in the mechanism by which they affect bond prices: while shocks to GDP
4:100:6242:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:growth or debt service are likely impact investors’ common value by altering the expected
4:101:6331:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:probability of default, liquidity or wealth shocks are more likely to affect private valua-
4:102:6422:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tions.  Furthermore, the information environment is likely to differ across shocks:  while
4:103:6512:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:some fundamentals, such as GDP growth or inflation are often publicly observable (albeit
4:104:6600:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:perhaps with a lag), others are difficult or costly too learn and evaluate.  In the Mexican
4:105:6691:21:22:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:context, a particularly pertinent example is knowledge of the inner workings of financial
4:106:6780:22:28:72:423:556:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:negotiations between Clinton and Congress over the 1995 bailout.3

5:141:8029:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:actual defaults suggest that the pricing of these bonds include a substantial premium.
5:142:8115:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:While some the fluctuations in this premium can be accounted for with aggregate risk-
5:143:8200:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pricing factors (like the aggregate price-earning ratio, which is a measure of the market
5:144:8289:21:22:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price of risk,  or the VIX, which is a measure of the volatility premium),  the bulk of it
5:145:8379:22:22:72:168:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:seemingly cannot.
5:146:8396:22:21:89:539:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In this paper we argue that (potentially endogenous) changes in investor information
5:147:8480:21:22:72:540:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:may be an important driver of the observed premium on sovereign debt.  To make this
5:148:8563:22:22:72:540:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:point,  we  depart  from  the  standard  presumption  that  fundamentals  are  always  in  the
5:149:8657:22:21:72:540:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:information set of investors and explore how prices are determined if investors have to
5:150:8744:21:22:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:acquire at a cost information about non-public fundamentals (or pay a cost to process
5:151:8829:22:22:72:540:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:information about public fundamentals).   This introduces the possibility that investors
5:152:8917:22:21:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are asymmetric in their information sets,  and that this asymmetry is reflected in bond
5:153:9004:21:22:72:106:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prices.
5:154:9011:22:22:89:539:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To circumvent some of the challenges standard auction models face in determining
5:155:9091:22:21:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equilibrium prices, we propose a novel auction model with three key characteristics:  (i)
5:156:9180:21:22:72:540:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the good being auctioned is perfectly divisible, (ii) the number of bidders is large, and (iii)
5:157:9275:22:22:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:there is both common uncertainty about the good quality and about the mass of investors
5:158:9362:22:21:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:who participate in the auction. Given these three characteristics, the price-quantity strate-
5:159:9455:21:22:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:gic aspects of standard auction theory become less relevant, and a price-taking, or Wal-
5:160:9543:22:22:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rasian, analysis emerges as a good approximation.4With price-taking, instead of study-
5:161:9629:22:22:72:540:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f6:B:ing strategic bidding and information processing, we can focus on arational expectations
5:162:9717:22:21:72:540:187:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f3:B:equilibriumwhere the “market” is cleared using realistic auction rules.  We refer to such
5:163:9806:21:22:72:539:166:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:auction approximated by price-taking asWalrasian auctionsand show that they are par-
5:164:9890:22:19:72:540:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ticularly tractable, allowing for an analysis of the role of information in equilibrium price
5:165:9983:19:15:85:539:125:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:4Recent auction literature shows that price-taking arises as the number of bidders get large.  A recent
5:166:10086:15:12:72:540:110:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:example is Fudenberg, Mobius, and Szeidl (2007), who show that the equilibria of large double auctions
5:167:10188:12:12:72:540:98:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:with correlated private values are essentially fully revealing and approximate price-taking behavior when
5:168:10293:12:12:72:540:86:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:the number of bidders goes to infinity.  Another is Reny and Perry (2006) who show a similar result when
5:169:10397:12:0:72:330:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:bidders have affiliated values and prices are on a fine grid.

6:171:10542:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of information endogenously acquired by investors.  As a corollary, we show that using
6:172:10628:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:auction protocols may circumvent the Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) paradox:  there are
6:173:10713:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:strict incentives to acquire information even when equilibrium prices are fully revealing

6:175:10810:22:21:89:539:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:As with Cetes in Mexico, sovereign debt auctions worldwide are generally conducted
6:176:10892:21:22:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:using one of two formats: uniform-price or discriminatory. Discriminatory-price auctions
6:177:10980:22:22:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are slightly more prevalent, while the uniform-price auctions is the standard method used
6:178:11069:22:21:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the United States.5Given the prevalence of both protocols, and the frequency at which
6:179:11157:21:22:72:540:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:some countries switch between protocols (as is clear for Mexico), we consider both types
6:180:11245:22:22:72:540:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  auction  protocols  and  examine  their  implication  for  both  government  and  investor
6:181:11339:22:21:72:106:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:utility.
6:182:11347:21:22:89:539:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To maintain tractability while allowing for asymmetric information, we will assume
6:183:11429:22:22:72:540:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that there are just two types of investors:  the informed who know more about bond’s
6:184:11513:22:21:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:default probability, and the uninformed who know less.  We are then able to character-
6:185:11599:21:22:72:540:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ize the rational expectations equilibria of our auction model under both auction formats
6:186:11687:22:22:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for different degrees of information asymmetry (as proxied by the fraction of informed
6:187:11773:22:21:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investors). This success comes despite the fact that we deviate from the standard CARA-
6:188:11860:21:22:72:540:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:normal framework commonly used in portfolio choice models with asymmetric informa-

6:190:12033:22:21:71:539:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a theory of government bond yields, in that it may help the theory speak to bond yields
6:191:12120:21:22:71:266:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:during both normal times and crises.

6:193:12235:19:16:85:539:212:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:5The heterogeneity of treasury auction formats is well-documented. For example, the U.S. switched to a
6:194:12337:16:12:72:540:196:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:uniform-price format from a discriminating-price format in the 1970s, while Canada and Germany use the
6:195:12439:12:12:72:540:184:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:price-discriminating format. Bartolini and Cottarelli (2001) study a sample in which 39 out of 42 countries
6:196:12546:12:11:72:540:172:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:use discriminatory price auctions. Brenner, Galai, and Sade (2009) analyze a sample of 48 countries, out of
6:197:12653:11:12:72:540:161:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:which 24 use discriminatory-price auctions, 9 use uniform-price auctions and the rest use either both or an
6:198:12760:12:9:72:180:149:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:hybrid between the two.
6:199:12783:9:15:85:539:140:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:6Portfolio choice models with asymmetric information in which prices do not perfectly reveal the quality
6:200:12887:15:12:72:540:125:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:of the bond ex-post are difficult to analyze because expectations, and hence excess demands, may not be
6:201:12990:12:12:72:540:113:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:continuous in the price of an asset.  It is well known that proving the existence of an equilibrium when
6:202:13094:12:12:72:540:101:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:prices are not fully revealing is very difficult (see Allen and Jordan (1998)), and that this challenge is usually
6:203:13208:12:0:72:526:89:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:tackled assuming CARA-normal cases because this combination yields a tractable linear price function.
7:204:13310:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a level-volatility trade-off between the two protocols. While uniform-price auctions gen-
7:205:13399:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:erate a higher sensitivity to demand shocks, the discriminatory-price auction generates
7:206:13486:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a higher debt burden (lower average prices for the bond).  Interestingly, this trade-off is
7:207:13577:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:only present when there is some degree of information asymmetry.  When information
7:208:13659:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(or the lack of information) is symmetric, both protocols are nearly identical in terms of
7:209:13749:22:21:72:364:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:average price and average exposure to demand shocks.
7:210:13801:21:22:89:539:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our paper fills an important gap in the sovereign debt literature, which has typically
7:211:13887:22:22:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:focused on bond yields in secondary market,  but has neglected the specifics of how a
7:212:13972:22:21:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:government sells its bonds and the role of investors’ information in determining issue
7:213:14058:21:22:72:540:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prices.  This is surprising since issue prices, rather than secondary market prices, enter
7:214:14148:22:22:72:540:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the government’s budget constraint.  To focus squarely on the determination of auction
7:215:14234:22:21:72:540:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prices, we neglect some of the issues studied in the literature, but expand on others. First,
7:216:14327:21:22:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:most papers study  sovereign default as the outcome  of governments’ strategic choice,
7:217:14413:22:22:72:540:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:but use a parsimonious model of investor optimization. We take the opposite route, and
7:218:14499:22:21:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:focus on the auction mechanics and investors choices while entirely neglecting strategic
7:219:14587:21:22:72:540:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:considerations on the part of the government.7Second, most of the literature generates a
7:220:14675:22:22:71:539:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fixed mapping between the bond quality and its price by assuming that investors are risk
7:221:14763:22:21:71:539:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:neutral and then requiring that the return, adjusted for the probability of default, equals
7:222:14854:21:22:71:539:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the risk-free rate.  We depart from these settings dramatically by assuming risk aversion
7:223:14943:22:22:71:539:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and specific auction clearing rules.  Finally,  while there has been some attention to the
7:224:15033:22:21:71:539:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:impact of the timing of decisions and of debt maturity in sovereign markets (see Aguiar
7:225:15120:21:22:71:539:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:et al. (2016a)), the actual mechanics of how sovereign bonds are sold in reality through
7:226:15208:22:22:71:539:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:auctions and their impact on observed prices has been ignored.  Our paper focuses on
7:227:15292:22:22:71:539:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this neglected role of information acquisition in the context of an explicit auction model.
7:228:15383:22:21:71:539:187:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Addtionally, there has been a recent effort to empirically document the implications of
7:229:15470:21:22:71:539:166:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:different auction protocols and of the information sharing across dealers on the revenue

8:241:16349:30:22:72:540:520:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:There are two periods, period 1 and period 2, and a single good (the numeraire).  The
8:242:16434:22:21:72:540:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:economy is populated by a measure one of ex-ante identical risk-averse investors, and
8:243:16519:21:22:72:539:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a government.   The government is modeled mechanically:  it needs to raiseDunits of
8:244:16602:22:22:71:539:455:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the numeraire in period one by auctioning (multiple units of) a bond that promises re-
8:245:16688:22:21:71:540:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:payment in period two.8Without loss of generality, we study zero-coupon pure-discount
8:246:16773:21:22:71:539:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bonds which promise a claim to one unit of the numeraire.  Bonds are risky because the
8:247:16859:22:22:71:539:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:government only delivers the promised payment if it does not default. If the government
8:248:16946:22:21:71:539:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:defaults, then investors cannot recover any of their investment.  If the amount of money
8:249:17034:21:22:71:539:347:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:raised at auction falls short ofD,  then government simply defaults on any bonds that
8:250:17119:22:22:71:539:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:it has already sold.  (We can also take this to mean that the government defaults on the
8:251:17207:22:21:71:250:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bonds coming due in period one).
8:252:17239:21:22:89:540:282:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The government’s default probability,κθis random and determined by the realization
8:253:17321:22:22:71:539:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of an exogenous state of the worldθ∈{g,b}. We assume thatκg< κband that the ex-ante
8:254:17404:22:21:71:539:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:probability of each state is given byf(g)andf(b)respectively, withf(g) +f(b) = 1. Since
8:255:17491:21:22:71:539:217:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the default probability determines the expected repayment of the bond, we refer to the
8:256:17577:22:22:71:539:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:realization ofκas aquality shock, where the bond withκgis agood quality bondand the one
8:257:17664:22:18:71:220:173:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:withκbis abad quality bond.9
8:258:17692:18:16:85:539:155:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:8The supply of bonds being auctioned to raiseDis therefore pinned down by the realized bids. This is
8:259:17792:16:8:72:444:139:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:meant to capture the impact of revenue needs on the government’s cost of financing.
8:260:17875:8:16:85:540:131:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f6:F:9It is straightforward to think of the possibleκθrealizations being themselves governed by anaggregate
8:261:17977:16:12:72:539:115:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f3:F:public shockνat the beginning of the period.   We anticipate that such a public shock would be likely to
8:262:18081:12:12:72:540:103:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:play an important role in accounting for data like that in Figure 1. However, since the analysis that follows
8:263:18190:12:0:72:306:91:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:remains the same, we do not explicitly incorporate it.
9:264:18245:0:22:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Investors consume only in the second period.  Accordingly, their objective is to maxi-
9:265:18331:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mize their expected utility over second period consumption given a the strictly concave
9:266:18418:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:flow utility functionU.  Each investor has wealthWin period one and can either invest
9:267:18503:21:22:71:505:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in a risk-free bond (storage) or the risky bond being auctioned by the government.
9:268:18585:22:22:89:540:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To allow for the possibility that prices are not fully revealing ofθex-post, we intro-
9:269:18671:22:21:71:540:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:duce ademand shock. Specifically, we assume that a random share of investorsηcannot
9:270:18754:21:22:71:539:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f7:B:participate in the auction and instead invests in the risk-free bond only. We assume thatη
9:271:18844:22:22:71:539:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is continuously distributed on the intervalH= [0,ηM]according to a continuous density
9:272:18929:22:21:71:540:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:functiong(η)that is nonzero everywhere on the interior of the interval, withηM<1. We
9:273:19013:21:22:71:532:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f7:B:will refer tos= (θ,η)as the state of the world and to the set of states byS={g,b}×H.
9:274:19097:22:22:89:539:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:A natural interpretations ofηis that it represents the fraction of investors who suffer
9:275:19184:22:21:71:539:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a liquidity or hedging shock.  Another is that some investors may randomly have access
9:276:19270:21:22:71:539:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to more favorable investment opportunities and thus do not invest in government bonds.
9:277:19356:22:22:71:540:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In the context of the auction literature,  the shock to demand coming throughηcan be
9:278:19440:22:21:71:540:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:therefore be thought of as acorrelated private value shock, while the shock to the quality
9:279:19530:21:22:71:539:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the bond coming throughθis acommon value shock.  Note that the demand shock is
9:280:19611:22:22:71:539:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:isomorphic  to  a  supply  shock  due  to  which  the  government  needs  to  raiseDψat  the
9:281:19703:22:21:71:539:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:auction,  whereψ=  1/(1−η).   We  will  later  use  this  alternative  interpretation  in  our
9:282:19797:21:22:71:189:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:numerical illustration.
9:283:19820:22:22:89:539:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:There will be two types of investors at the auction: those who areinformed(I) about
9:284:19903:22:21:71:540:274:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:B:θand thus know its realization, and those who areuninformed(U) aboutθand do not
9:285:19982:21:22:71:539:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:know its realization.  We denote byi∈ {I,U}the type of investor and usen∈[0,1]to
9:286:20062:22:22:71:540:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:denote the share of informed investors.  The remaining share1−nthus consists of un-
9:287:20145:22:22:71:539:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:informed investors. The fractionnthus determines thedegree of asymmetric informationin
9:288:20231:22:21:71:539:187:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the sense that it measures the relative mass of investors with superior information about
9:289:20320:21:22:71:539:166:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the quality of the bond. Consistent with our mechanical modeling of the government we
9:290:20405:22:22:71:540:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assume that it observes neitherθnorηbefore the auction.  This precludes signaling by
9:291:20489:22:21:71:539:122:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the government.  Because informed (uninformed) investors are otherwise identical, we
9:292:20573:21:22:71:539:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:can refer without loss of generality to a representative informed (uninformed) investor.
9:293:20661:22:0:71:540:79:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Neither type of investor is informed aboutη, which means that all investors face some
10:294:20747:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:uncertainty about the state of the world.  We will show below that this implies that all
10:295:20835:22:45:72:518:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investors face uncertainty about the minimum price at which they can buy the bond.
10:296:20917:45:30:72:221:641:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:2.2    Auction Protocols
10:297:20941:30:22:72:540:611:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We  now  describe  the  auction  protocol  governing  which  investor  bids  the  government
10:298:21033:22:22:72:539:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:accepts and at which price accepted bids are executed.  Abidby an investor is defined
10:299:21118:22:21:72:540:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to be a pair{P,B}representing a commitment to purchaseBunits of the bond at a price
10:300:21201:21:22:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:no higher thanP, should the government decide to accept the bid.  Each investor is free
10:301:21288:22:22:72:540:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to submit as many bids as desired at the beginning of the auction. The government treats
10:302:21376:22:21:72:540:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:each bid independently, sorts all bids from the highest to the lowest bid price, and accepts
10:303:21468:21:22:72:540:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:all bids in descending order until it raisesDin revenue. We refer to the (highest possible)
10:304:21559:22:22:72:540:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:”lowest” accepted price as themarginal price ̄P.   All bids at prices above the marginal
10:305:21647:22:21:72:540:437:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price are accepted;  all bids below are rejected.  Hence we refer to these bids above the
10:306:21736:21:22:72:540:416:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:marginal price asin the money, and to bids below the marginal price asout of the money.
10:307:21823:22:22:72:540:394:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(If there is excess demand at the marginal price, we assume that the government rations
10:308:21910:22:21:72:387:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bids pro-rata. This does not occur in equilibrium, however.)
10:309:21970:21:22:89:539:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Investors lack commitment in two important dimensions. First, they cannot commit to
10:310:22053:22:22:72:540:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:honor any intertemporal contracts. We will take this to mean that they cannot borrow at
10:311:22140:22:21:72:540:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the riskfree rate, nor can they short-sell the bond at the auction. Investors must therefore
10:312:22232:21:22:72:539:286:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bid nonnegative quantities (B≥0) and can spend no more than their wealthWon bonds.
10:313:22314:22:22:72:540:264:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Second, they cannot commit to credibly share their information aboutθ. Hence investors
10:314:22400:22:21:72:540:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cannot directly acquire information from other investors.  A unit of the bond is a claim
10:315:22488:21:22:72:540:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to a real unit of the numeraire in period two.  As this claim either pays 1 or 0, the range
10:316:22579:22:22:72:540:199:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of possible prices isP∈[0,1].   Since investors will typically find it optimal to submit
10:317:22667:22:21:72:539:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:multiple bids, we start by taking the investors’ strategy to be a bid functionBI(P|θ)for
10:318:22755:21:22:72:308:156:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the informed andBU(P)for the uninformed.
10:319:22795:22:22:89:539:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The price at which an accepted bid is executed depends on the auction protocol.  We
10:320:22878:22:21:72:540:112:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consider two protocols that are widely used in a large multi-unit auctions of common-
10:321:22963:21:0:72:539:91:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:value goods, not just sovereign bonds. The first is thediscriminatory-price(DP) auction in
11:322:23054:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which all accepted bids are executed at the bid price (“pay as you bid”). The second is the
11:323:23145:22:22:72:539:686:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f3:B:uniform-price(UP) auction in which all accepted bids are executed at the lowest accepted
11:324:23233:22:21:71:502:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(or marginal) price. Government and investors take the auction protocol as given.

11:340:23826:22:22:72:540:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more funds will thus have to accept a lower marginal price.  As the auction clears when

11:354:24245:42:22:72:539:286:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In contrast to the UP auction, revenue is always declining in the marginal price ̄P(s). This
11:355:24337:22:21:72:540:264:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is because executed prices are fixed at the bidding price while the number of accepted
11:356:24423:21:22:72:540:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bids is decreasing in the marginal price. The marginal price is defined such that the gov-
11:357:24513:22:22:72:540:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ernment’s revenue is equal toD.  Hence it is immediately clear that a government that
11:358:24598:22:45:72:399:199:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:needs to raise more funds must accept a lower marginal price.

11:360:24673:30:21:72:540:124:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Investors have rational expectations: the set of marginal prices, their probabilities, and the
11:361:24767:21:22:72:540:103:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:states associated with each marginal price are all common knowledge when submitting
11:362:24850:22:0:72:540:81:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bids.  After the auction is completed and the realization of the marginal price has been
12:363:24940:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:revealed,  informed and uninformed investors can make inferences with respect to the
12:364:25024:22:22:72:539:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f7:B:state.  This is straightforward for informed investors since they knowθand can inferη
12:365:25109:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f10:B:by inverting the price schedule. Inference is harder for the uninformed. If the price ̄P(s)
12:366:25200:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is uniquely generated by a quality shock, then they too can infer the state perfectly.  If
12:367:25290:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:there are two states(g,ηg)and(b,ηb)with a common price, then they will still be able to
12:368:25377:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:update their beliefs about the set of possible states and their probabilities from observing
12:369:25469:21:22:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the price. However, they will not be able to uniquely identify the true state. Importantly,
12:370:25560:22:22:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this ex-post information is of limited use because all of the investors must choose their
12:371:25649:22:21:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bidspriorto observing the realized marginal price.  Inference thus helps investors form
12:372:25736:21:22:72:540:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expectations  regarding  the  states  in  which  a  given  bid  at  pricePis  accepted,  but  the
12:373:25833:22:22:72:540:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:auction format precludes them from revising their bids given the information contained
12:374:25919:22:21:72:540:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in prices ex-post. This ex-ante commitment to bids distinguishes our auction model from
12:375:26006:21:22:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:canonical noisy rational expectations models such as Grossman and Stiglitz (1980).  The
12:376:26093:22:22:72:539:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:advantage of informed investors is that they knowθwhen submitting bids, and thus face
12:377:26178:22:21:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:uncertaintly only about the values ofηfor which a given bid is accepted.  Uninformed
12:378:26262:21:22:72:539:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investors instead face uncertainty about bothθandηwhen forecasting the set of states
12:379:26346:22:22:72:270:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for which a given bid is in the money.
12:380:26384:22:18:89:539:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In a DP auction, it is a strictly dominant strategy to bid only at possible marginal prices
12:381:26475:18:25:74:539:321:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f3:B: ̄P(s). If the investor were to bid at a slightly higher price, the bid is accepted in the same
12:382:26570:25:22:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:states but the investors pays a higher price.  In the UP auction it is a weakly dominating
12:383:26660:22:21:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:strategy to do so. We thus restrict investors to only bid at marginal prices. This means that
12:384:26753:21:22:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we no longer need to think of our investors having a bidding strategy for each possible
12:385:26840:22:22:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price but instead think of them as choosing how many bonds to bid for at the marginal
12:386:26925:22:22:72:538:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f7:B:price for each state.  Since bids only happen at marginal prices, we drop the notation ̄P
12:387:27014:22:31:71:488:187:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and just refer toP. We also switch to a starker specification for bids and prices.
12:388:27096:31:22:71:539:156:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f6:F:Definition 1.For each states= (θ,η)∈ S,the marginal price isP(θ,η).  The set of marginal

13:392:27463:0:22:72:539:708:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f6:F:Remark 1.Bids in any two states(g,ηg)and(b,ηb)such thatP(g,ηg) =P(b,ηb),are perfect
13:393:27546:22:22:71:539:686:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:F:substitutes since they are accepted and rejected in the identical sets of states.  Thus, the investor
13:394:27647:22:31:71:524:664:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f7:C:just chooses the total quantityB(g,ηg) +B(b,ηb)to bid at the priceP=P(g,ηg) =P(b,ηb).
13:395:27732:31:22:71:540:633:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f6:F:Remark 2.This stark specification allows us to directly compare our auction to a competitive
13:396:27824:22:22:71:539:611:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:F:equilibrium.  It is also particularly helpful when the set ofη’s is finite, so that the set of possible
13:397:27927:22:21:71:539:589:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:F:marginal prices is as well. In our original specification of actions as bids on the set of all potential
13:398:28031:21:22:71:540:568:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:F:pricesP∈[0,1]this would mean that the bid function would be positive only at a finite set of
13:399:28123:22:22:71:540:546:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:F:points corresponding to those marginal prices. But even whenηis continuous, the set of marginal
13:400:28218:22:52:71:317:524:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:prices is a strict subset of the set of potential prices.

13:406:28576:22:22:71:539:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:then the investor additional consumes the unit payoff from his total holdings of the risky

16:583:33975:22:21:72:540:208:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:evaluated atP(s)< P( ̃s)because fewer bids are executed.  The bid-overhang constraint
16:584:34060:21:22:72:540:187:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:can and does bind in the UP auction,  however.   The reason is that there is a trade-off
16:585:34148:22:22:72:540:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:between the number of accepted bids and the price paid on all accepted bids in a UP
16:586:34231:22:21:72:540:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:auction. Hence total revenue may be higher when evaluated atP( ̃s)than when evaluated
16:587:34316:21:29:72:151:122:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:atP(s)< P( ̃s).
16:588:34331:29:21:72:539:93:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f7:F:Definition 5(Auction Equilibrium).An auction equilibrium is a price scheduleP:S →[0,1],
16:589:34418:21:0:72:457:72:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:and bidding fuctionsBU:S →[0,∞)andBI:S×{g,b}→[0,∞),such that
17:590:34480:0:32:86:358:708:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:1.  each investor type’s bid function solves their problem,
17:591:34539:32:32:86:387:676:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f7:A:2.  the auction-clearing condition(11)is satisfied for alls∈S,
17:592:34601:32:34:86:357:644:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f7:A:3.  the bid-overhang constraint is satisfied at eachs∈S.
17:593:34657:34:22:72:540:610:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f6:F:Remark 3.Formulating an equilibrium in this stark fashion, where bids are defined as functions
17:594:34751:22:22:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:F:directly of the state, is isomorphic to a more standard formulation where bids are defined as func-
17:595:34850:22:21:72:539:566:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:F:tions of prices.  The price functions are the same, asBU(P(s)) =BU(s)and0elsewhere, while
17:596:34939:21:22:72:539:545:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f6:F:BI(P(s),θ)  =BI(s,θ)and0elsewhere.  The main difference is that the standard formulation
17:597:35027:22:22:72:540:523:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:F:defines the bid function overallpotential prices rather than marginal prices only.  Even though
17:598:35122:22:21:72:540:501:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:F:the two formulations are formally identical, the standard formulation is poorly behaved computa-
17:599:35218:21:22:72:540:480:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:F:tionally as the bid function is discontinuous around marginal prices given that no investor bids at
17:600:35317:22:31:72:172:458:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:non-marginal prices.
17:601:35337:31:22:72:540:427:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f6:F:Proposition  1.For  both  UP  and  DP  auctions,  the  price  functionP(θ,η)is  decreasing  inη.
17:602:35433:22:32:71:492:405:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:Conditional onθ, the price function is continuous and differentiable almost everywhere.
17:603:35520:32:21:71:540:373:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f3:B:Proof.For the DP auction, monotonicity inηfollows directly from the auction-clearing
17:604:35604:21:22:71:539:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:condition, while for the UP auction it follows from the bid-overhang constraint.  Mono-
17:605:35691:22:22:71:539:330:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tonicity and boundedness of the price function then imply continuity and differentiability
17:606:35781:22:31:71:303:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:almost everywhere by Lebesgue’s Theorem.
17:607:35821:31:22:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f6:F:Corollary 2.A bid made at priceP(θ,η)is in-the-money for allˆη≥ηgivenθ, and if there exists

17:609:36000:45:30:71:539:210:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:F:3.2    Comparison of Auction Equilibrium and Competitive Equilibrium
17:610:36068:30:22:71:539:180:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Now we have defined an auction equilibrium, we can compare its structure with that of a
17:611:36155:22:21:71:539:158:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:competitive equilibrium, defined as a tuple consisting of a equilibrium price and demand
17:612:36243:21:22:71:485:137:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:functions such that there is no excess supply of bonds at the equilibrium price.
17:613:36323:22:22:89:539:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:It is evident that a DP auction equilibrium cannot be a competitive equilibrium: there
17:614:36409:22:22:71:539:93:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is a single market-clearing price in the latter, while bonds trade at multiple distinct prices
17:615:36503:22:0:71:539:71:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the former. In UP auctions, however, bonds are always sold at a single price. In many
18:616:36593:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cases,  a UP auction equilibrium will therefore turn out to be isomorphic to a standard
18:617:36680:22:22:72:521:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:competitive equilibrium with heterogeneous information. We establish this link here.
18:618:36764:22:21:89:539:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In UP auctions, uninformed investors chooseBU(s)to maximize(1)subject to con-
18:619:36841:21:22:72:539:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:straints(2),(3)and the short-sale constraint(5)(see Definition 2).  The decision problem
18:620:36929:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in a competitive equilibrium is identical except for the fact that the short-sale constraint
18:621:37021:22:21:72:539:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:applies tototalpurchases of bonds in each states,  rather than bid-by-bid.   That is,  in
18:622:37110:21:40:72:485:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:competitive equilibrium we replace (5) with a short-sale constraint of the form
18:623:37189:40:40:217:540:538:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:A:BUR(s)≥0andBURF(s)≥0∀s∈S.(13)
18:624:37218:40:21:89:539:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The same considerations hold for the informed investor.  To check whether a UP auc-
18:625:37301:21:22:71:539:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tion equilibrium is isomorphic to a competitive equilibrium, it is thus sufficient to verify
18:626:37393:22:22:71:539:455:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:whether or not constraints(5)and(13)(and their analogues for the informed investor)
18:627:37476:22:21:71:539:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:imply each other.  To go from constraint(5)to(13)we can construct the associated total
18:628:37562:21:22:72:540:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:risky bond purchases just by summing  over the in-the-money bids.  This implies that if
18:629:37649:22:22:72:358:390:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f3:B:(5)does not bind in any states, then neither does(13).
18:630:37703:22:21:89:540:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:To go from constraint(13)to(5), we can construct the associated state-by-state bids
18:631:37786:21:22:72:539:347:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:given the total bond purchases in a competitive equilibrium,{BIR(s,θ),BUR(s)}, using the
18:632:37874:22:40:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:difference between the risky bond purchases atsand those at the next highest prices′, i.e.
18:633:37964:40:39:242:540:285:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:A:BU(s) =BUR(s)−BUR(s′),(14)
18:634:37990:39:22:72:539:246:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:whereP(s′) = min{P(s′′)> P(s)}for alls′′∈S. The analogous object for the informed is
18:635:38074:22:22:72:408:224:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:constructed using their conditional total purchasesBIR(s,θ(s)).11
18:636:38139:22:21:89:539:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We can then distinguish three scenarios.  First, if the state-by-state bids are nonnega-
18:637:38227:21:22:72:540:181:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tive in the UP auction equilibrium so that (5) does not bind, then the short-sale constraint
18:638:38319:22:22:72:540:159:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cannot bind for total purchases and there is an associated competitive equilibrium.  Sec-
18:639:38408:22:21:72:540:137:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ond, if there is a state in which the short-sale constraint (5) binds in the UP auction equi-
18:640:38501:21:19:72:540:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:librium, there is an associated competitive equilibrium only if the short-sale constraint

19:648:38857:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sociated competitive equilibrium when there are states for which the nonnegativity con-

19:650:39033:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:individual bids in particular states in the UP auction. Hence UP auction equilibria are not
19:651:39124:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:necessarily isomorphic to competitive equilibria. The next proposition formalizes this dis-

20:728:41953:30:22:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Now consider the uninformed investors’ problem.   Since these investors do not know
20:729:42036:22:22:72:539:148:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  realizedθ,  they  must  form  expectations  regarding  the  quality  of  bond  conditional
20:730:42131:22:21:72:540:126:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on a given bid being executed.  In order to rewrite the problem in terms of the expected
20:731:42219:21:22:72:540:105:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:probability of default conditional on the realized marginal price, we first explain how this
20:732:42311:22:0:72:231:83:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:inference problem is resolved.
21:733:42343:0:22:89:540:708:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f3:A:Inference.Given that bids are executed depending on the realization of the marginal
21:734:42426:22:22:71:539:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price and that the quality of a bond is fully pinned down by its default probability, the
21:735:42515:22:21:71:539:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:inference problem is equivalent to computing the expected default probability of a bond
21:736:42602:21:22:71:539:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:given the realization of a marginal price.   We denote this conditional expected default
21:737:42690:22:22:71:539:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:probability by ̃κ.  For the informed, ̃κ(P(θ,η)|θ) =κθbecause they know the trueθ.  For
21:738:42777:22:34:72:261:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the uninformed there are two cases:
21:739:42812:34:32:86:503:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f7:A:1.  For any(θ,η)such that@(θ′,η′)withP(θ,η) =P(θ′,η′), then ̃κ(P(θ,η)) =κθ.
21:740:42887:32:22:86:540:533:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:2.  If there are two states(θ,η)and(θ′,η′)such thatP(θ′,η′) =P(θ,η)andθ′6=θthe
21:741:42965:22:26:101:468:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:solution to the uninformed investor’s inference problem is as follows.

22:847:44741:40:21:72:540:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Comparing this expression to the informed investors’ first-order condition, it is clear that
22:848:44833:21:22:72:540:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the uninformed face the same basic tradeoffs as the informed, but weighted by the ex-

22:850:45005:22:21:72:540:189:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this leads to a form of adverse selection:  when bidding at high marginal prices,  unin-
22:851:45093:21:22:72:540:168:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:formed investors also expect these bids to be accepted after bad quality shocks, leading to
22:852:45184:22:22:72:540:146:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a downward revision of expected asset quality.  Uninformed investors thus have weaker
22:853:45269:22:31:72:417:124:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:marginal incentives to bid at high prices than informed investors.
22:854:45335:31:22:72:540:93:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f6:F:Proposition 4.Fixing the price scheduleP(s), both the informed and the uninformed bidders do
22:855:45427:22:0:72:540:71:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:F:strictly better under the UP protocol than the DP protocol so long as there exists a set ofη’s of
23:856:45526:0:32:72:407:708:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:positive measure at which they they are making positive bids, fixingθ.
23:857:45596:32:22:72:539:676:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f3:B:Proof.The uninformed (informed) UP bidders simply have to replicate the bids of the
23:858:45679:22:21:72:539:654:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:uninformed (informed) DP bidders.  Note that sinceP(θ,η1)> P(θ,η2)ifη1< η2, they
23:859:45759:21:22:72:539:633:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have lower expenditures on the risky bond in state(θ,η2)under the UP protocol that they
23:860:45846:22:22:72:540:611:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:would under the DP protocol if they have positive bids in these two states.  Hence they
23:861:45933:22:21:72:540:589:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have higher purchases of the risk-free bond in(θ,η2).  This raises their consumption in
23:862:46020:21:31:72:316:568:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:both the default and the repayment outcomes.
23:863:46064:31:22:89:539:537:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Since, fixing prices, the investors are always better off under the UP than the DP auc-
23:864:46151:22:21:72:540:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tions, it follows that the government can only prefer the UP auction if it delivers higher
23:865:46241:21:22:72:540:494:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prices in some appropriate average sense.  Whether this will be the case is unclear since
23:866:46330:22:22:72:540:472:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the substitution effect will encourage higher bidding under UP, but the income effect com-
23:867:46420:22:21:72:540:450:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ing through the lower expenditures can have an ambiguous affect depending upon the
23:868:46502:21:53:72:246:429:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:curvature of the utility fuctionU.

23:870:46583:34:22:72:540:342:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We  now  characterize  uniform-price  auction  equilibrium.   (The  characterization  of  the

23:872:46773:22:21:72:539:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equilibrium prices depend on the fraction of informed investorsn.  We later use this to
23:873:46860:21:22:72:540:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:compute sovereign bond yields, the government’s debt burden and investors’ incentives
23:874:46945:22:22:72:540:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to acquire information givenn.  Accordingly, we will usePUP(s;n)to denote the price
23:875:47028:22:21:71:539:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:function for each state and degree of asymmetric information in the UP auction.  When
23:876:47113:21:22:71:540:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:there is no risk of confusion, we will simply writeP(s).  In a similar fashion, we will use
23:877:47204:22:22:71:540:190:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:B:BUP,U(s;n)for the bids of the uninformed andBUP,I(s,θ;n)for the bids of the informed,
23:878:47289:22:45:71:506:168:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:but use the simpler notationBU(s)andBI(s,θ)when there is no risk of confusion.

23:880:47394:30:21:71:540:93:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f6:B:We begin by considering the two symmetric benchmarks: thesymmetric ignorance equilib-

24:882:47568:0:40:72:285:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which all investors are informed (n= 1).

25:980:50248:21:22:71:539:342:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:F:else is informed? The answer may be zero. Specifically, UP auctions can generate a result similar
25:981:50345:22:22:71:539:320:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:F:to canonical rational expectations models with asymmetric information, namely that uninformed

25:983:50538:21:40:71:309:277:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:characterizes conditions such that this is the case.

25:985:50610:30:22:71:539:207:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In competitive equilibrium, there are no gains from acquiring information if prices are
25:986:50697:22:22:71:539:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fully revealing (Grossman and Stiglitz 1980).  A similar result holds in UP auction equi-
25:987:50786:22:21:71:539:163:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:librium, but under more stringent conditions. These additional restrictions arise because
25:988:50875:21:32:71:501:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bids cannot be adjusted ex-post conditional on the information revealed in prices.
25:989:50957:32:22:71:540:110:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f6:F:Proposition 5.In a UP auction, uninformed investors can replicate the total bids and ex-post
25:990:51049:22:0:71:515:88:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:payoffs of informed investors in every state (and hence informed investors’ ex-ante payoff) if:
26:991:51146:0:32:86:505:708:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f7:A:1.  Prices are fully revealing: each marginal price is associated with a unique state inS.
26:992:51236:32:21:86:540:676:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:2.  Ordering marginal prices and associated total bids of the informed from the highest to the
26:993:51330:21:30:101:540:655:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:A:lowest marginal price, the total bids of the informed are weakly ranked from lowest to highest.
26:994:51425:30:22:72:539:625:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f3:B:Proof.Condition 1 ensures that the uninformed can accurately infer the state in which
26:995:51510:22:21:72:540:603:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:each bid is accepted.  Condition 2 second ensures that the no short-sale constraint does
26:996:51598:21:30:72:278:582:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not bind for marginal bids in any state.

26:999:51770:30:22:71:540:500:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f7:F:Corollary 6.The conditions in Proposition 5 are satisfied in a UP auction equilibrium withn
26:1000:51861:22:30:71:489:478:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:informed investors ifP(g,ηM;n)> P(b,0;n)andBIR([g,ηM],g;n)<BIR([b,0],b;n).
26:1001:51935:30:21:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f3:B:Proof.P(θ,η)is strictly decreasing inηby Proposition 1, and so informed investors’ bids
26:1002:52022:21:22:72:539:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f7:B:quantities are strictly increasing inηgivenθ.  The first condition implies thatP(g,η)>
26:1003:52108:22:22:72:539:405:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:B:P(b,η′)for allη,η′, and soP(s)6=P(s′)for anys,s′∈ S.  Hence all uninformed bids on
26:1004:52190:22:21:71:539:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the high-price schedule are accepted in the bad state.  The second condition ensures that
26:1005:52279:21:22:71:539:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the short-sale constraint does not bind for uninformed investors in the bad state when
26:1006:52365:22:30:71:252:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:replicating the informed portfolio.
26:1007:52400:30:22:89:539:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Even if uninformed investors can replicate the informed portfolio, they will generally
26:1008:52486:22:21:72:540:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not make the samemarginal bidsas the informed in every state. The reason is that, unlike
26:1009:52574:21:22:72:540:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the bids of the informed, all of the bids by uninformed investors on theθ=gschedule
26:1010:52657:22:22:71:539:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are also accepted whenθ=b.To replicate the informed portfolio, the uninformed must
26:1011:52739:22:21:71:539:223:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f6:B:therefore make the same marginal bids as the informed at prices on thehigh-quality sched-
26:1012:52828:21:22:71:539:202:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f3:B:ule, but bid less than the informed on the low-quality schedule.  The cumulation of bids
26:1013:52916:22:22:71:539:180:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on both schedules is then such that the total bond holdings are identical to those of the
26:1014:53005:22:21:71:539:158:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:informed. This observation also provides intuition as to when replication fails: if the sec-
26:1015:53097:21:22:71:539:137:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ond condition is violated, then the number of bonds accumulated through bids on the
26:1016:53180:22:22:71:539:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:high-quality price schedule is so high that the uninformed would have to bid negative
26:1017:53265:22:22:71:539:93:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:amounts on the low-quality schedule in order to obtain the same total portfolio. But this
26:1018:53354:22:0:71:280:71:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is ruled out by the short-sale constraint.

27:1020:53462:31:21:72:540:677:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We now study the equilibrium with asymmetric information (n∈(0,1)).  To highlight

28:1097:57300:12:12:71:539:107:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:which the no short-sale constraint binds, forcing total bids in those states to be the same.  Hence the bid at

28:1100:57624:12:0:71:286:71:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:numerical example in which this situation arises.

29:1104:57833:28:22:72:539:627:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f3:B:Proof.  First statement.Since replication is feasible atn= 1, the short-sale constraint does
29:1105:57925:22:22:71:539:605:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not bind in the informed portfolio. Thus, replication fails if and only if the bid-overhang
29:1106:58016:22:21:71:540:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:constraint binds in at least one state. Since bids are smooth inψconditional onθ, the bid-
29:1107:58106:21:22:71:540:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:overhang constraint (BOC) cannot bind in any two states(ψ,θ)and(ψ′,θ)withψ6=ψ′.
29:1108:58185:22:22:71:540:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Since informed investors’ bids are increasing inψand prices are ranked byθgivenψ,
29:1109:58266:22:21:71:539:518:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f10:B:it  follows  that,  if  the  BOC  binds  in  some  state,  it  first  binds  in  the  pair  of  states(b,1)
29:1110:58373:21:22:71:539:497:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f10:B:and(g,ψM).   By  replication,  auction-clearing  in(g,ψM)impliesP(g,ψM)BUR([g,ψM])  =
29:1111:58458:22:22:71:539:475:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:B:DψM. SinceP(g,ψM)> P(b,1), executing bids atP(g,ψM)in state(b,1)implies that only
29:1112:58539:22:21:71:539:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:uninformed bids are accepted.  These bids are sufficient to to clear the market in(b,1)if
29:1113:58628:21:22:71:540:432:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f3:B:(1−n)P(g,ψM)BUR([g,ψM])≥D.  Hence the BOC is violated, and replication fails, if and
29:1114:58712:22:22:71:150:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:only ifn≤ηM.
29:1115:58724:22:21:89:540:388:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f3:A:Second statement.LetXU([θ,η];n)denote uninformed investors’ total expenditures on
29:1116:58805:21:22:71:539:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:risky bonds.  Thenlimn→0XU([θ,η];n)→D/(1−η)for allθby auction-clearing.  Unin-
29:1117:58883:22:22:71:540:345:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f10:B:formed bids are made unconditionally onθ.  Hencelimn→0XU([g,η];n)→XU([b,η];n)
29:1118:58960:22:21:71:539:323:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and thuslimn→0P([g,η];n)→P([b,η];n). By Proposition 1,P(θ,η;n)is strictly decreasing
29:1119:59044:21:22:71:540:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:inηgivenθandn. Whenn→0, prices must then be sorted byη. That is, there is always
29:1120:59124:22:22:71:539:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a-small enough such that forη′−η=-, i.eP([θ,η];n)< P([θ′,η′];n)< P([θ,η′];n). Since
29:1121:59207:22:21:71:539:258:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:B:ηis drawn from a closed interval, this implies that the price schedules must converge at
29:1122:59295:21:30:71:411:237:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:every interior point in which the price schedules are continuous.
29:1123:59360:30:22:89:539:207:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:What remains is a characterization of equilibrium prices forn≤ηM.  In this range,
29:1124:59441:22:21:72:539:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the bid-overhang constraint binds for some values ofη, forcing an overlap in the high-
29:1125:59527:21:22:72:540:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quality and low-quality price schedules that renders replication infeasible. Prices are then
29:1126:59619:22:22:72:539:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:determined as follows. Take any two statess= [g,ψg]ands′= [b,ψb]for which a binding
29:1127:59702:22:21:71:540:120:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:constraint forces a common price,P=P(s)  =P(s′).   The respective auction-clearing

31:1216:62440:184:22:89:539:316:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Proposition 9 shows that the equilibrium is equivalent to the symmetric information

31:1218:62610:22:21:72:539:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:verge to each other asn→0.  In the intervaln∈(0,ηM]instead, the bid-overhang con-
31:1219:62691:21:22:72:540:251:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:straint binds and price schedules overlap. To illustrate the resulting equilibrium, we plot
31:1220:62782:22:22:72:539:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equilibrium prices forn∈ {0.12,0.07,0.02}in Figure 3.  Given thatηM=  0.17, the bid-
31:1221:62866:22:21:72:540:207:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:overhang constraint binds in all three cases. Since per-capita bids are increasing inψcon-
31:1222:62956:21:22:72:540:186:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ditional onθ, moreover, the state-contingent price schedules first overlap in the pair of
31:1223:63045:22:22:72:540:164:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:states(b,1)and(g,ˆψg(n)), whereˆψg(n)is defined such that uninformed investors’ good-
31:1224:63130:22:21:72:539:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:state bids evaluated atP(g,ψg)are sufficient to cover the supply of bonds in(b,1).  (See
31:1225:63218:21:22:72:540:121:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the proof of Proposition 9 for an analogous construction.) Hence, the region of overlap is
31:1226:63308:22:22:72:478:99:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:such that fewer investors participate conditional on a good than a bad shock.
31:1227:63385:22:0:89:539:77:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Multiple  equilibria  with  different  prices  can  be  sustained  in  our  model  due  to  the
32:1228:63482:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:following logic. Suppose first that the common price is low and the short-sale constraint
32:1229:63571:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:does not bind,P <1−κb. (This threshold is plotted using pink-dotted horizontal lines.)
32:1230:63657:22:21:71:539:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Uninformed investors then infer from the low price that the bond is likely to be of low
32:1231:63744:21:22:71:539:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quality,  and reduce their demand.   But informed investors continue to buy,  and fewer
32:1232:63831:22:22:71:539:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investors suffer a demand shock ifθ=bthan ifθ=g,  allowing markets to clear and
32:1233:63910:22:21:72:258:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sustaining a low-price equilibrium.
32:1234:63945:21:22:89:539:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Conversely, suppose that the common price is high and that the short-sale constraint
32:1235:64029:22:22:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:binds on the informed.  Observing a high price, uninformed investors now infer that the
32:1236:64116:22:21:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bond  is  likely  to  be  of  high  quality,  boosting  their  demand.   Since  informed  investors
32:1237:64215:21:22:72:540:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:do not participate, however, this is entirely consistent with market-clearing.  Intuitively,
32:1238:64307:22:22:72:540:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:short-sale constraints may thus prevent the information held by informed investors from
32:1239:64394:22:27:72:493:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:being impounded into prices, allowing the model to sustain multiple equilibria.

32:1270:65005:21:22:72:539:204:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f10:B:is unique because the bid-overhang constraint binds for a relatively highψ(recall̂η=n=

32:1274:65350:22:22:71:539:117:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to bid in the bad state.  Panel (b) shows three possible equilibria forn= 0.07, two with
32:1275:65438:22:21:72:540:95:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a discontinuous jump in the range of overlapping prices (in dashed and dotted lines).
32:1276:65523:21:0:72:540:74:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Finally, Panel (c) shows the outcome whenn= 0.02.  Here the number of informed is so
33:1277:65609:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:low that only the early jump to pessimism is an equilibrium.  Finally, note that the bid-

33:1285:66271:22:21:72:539:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the range of overlapping prices.  Jumps occur from a point belowκUto a point above

33:1307:66955:151:22:89:539:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Taken together, the figures show that multiplicity is partly sustained by both jumps
33:1308:67039:22:22:72:540:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the price schedule and in the set of states for which prices overlap,  so as to ensure
33:1309:67128:22:21:72:540:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:market-clearing in all states. The logic underlying multiplicity (and also non-existence of
33:1310:67219:21:22:72:540:204:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equilibrium) in our model is thus similar to the one that pervades competitive equilibria
33:1311:67308:22:22:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with heterogeneous information more generally:  prices are determined by local beliefs,
33:1312:67395:22:19:72:540:160:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:but these can jump discontinuously while being consistent with optimality and updating.
33:1313:67482:19:15:82:539:141:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:14An implicit assumption maintained here is that the symmetric ignorance price schedule lies everywhere
33:1314:67585:15:12:72:539:126:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:above the threshold1−κbbelow which the short-sale constraint binds for informed investors givenθ=b.
33:1315:67684:12:12:72:540:114:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:This implies that it is possible for a low-quality price schedule to exist that does not require jumps in the
33:1316:67793:12:12:72:540:102:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:region of overlap in order to get informed investors to bid on low-quality bonds. Parameters may be such
33:1317:67897:12:12:72:539:90:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:that this is not feasible for sufficiently lown, however. In this case, there is no equilibrium with a continuous
33:1318:68010:12:0:72:294:78:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:low-quality price schedule in the range of overlap.

34:1321:68189:35:21:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We now characterize discriminatory-price auctions, and usePDP(s;n)to denote the price
34:1322:68274:21:22:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f10:B:for each state and eachnin the discriminatory protocol.  Similarly, will useBDP,U(s;n)
34:1323:68360:22:22:71:539:577:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for the bids of the uninformed andBDP,I(s,θ;n)for the bids of the informed.  Whenever
34:1324:68445:22:21:71:540:555:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:there is no risk of confusion, we use the simpler notationP(s),BU(s), andBI(s,θ).  As
34:1325:68530:21:45:71:416:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:before, we start with the symmetric benchmarksn= 0andn= 1.

34:1329:68735:22:40:71:518:407:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we can simplify notation toP(η)andB(η), and the auction-clearing condition (15) to

34:1334:68841:39:22:71:539:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The first important difference between UP and DP auctions is that in-the-money bids are
34:1335:68928:22:22:71:539:306:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not executed at the marginal priceP(η)but rather at bid priceP(ˆη).  As a result,  total
34:1336:69016:22:21:71:539:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expenditures must be monotonically increasing inηand bids must be strictly positive,

36:1469:71527:21:22:71:539:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at the bid price. Hence uninformed investors will typically pay higher prices than the in-

38:1612:74921:0:22:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Solving for equilibrium prices in DP auctions with asymmetric information is analyt-
38:1613:75005:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ically intractable.  Hence we use our numerical example from Table 1 to illustrate prices
38:1614:75094:22:21:72:200:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and comparative statics.
38:1615:75118:21:22:89:539:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f10:A:We first compute the equilibrium in the benchmarks with symmetric information (n=

38:1617:75284:22:21:72:539:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:probability of the bad state,f(b)∈ {0.25,0.5}.   The price functions are in Panel (a) of
38:1618:75372:21:22:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Figure  5.   As  with  the  UP  auction,  the  price  schedules  are  independent  off(b)under
38:1619:75466:22:22:72:539:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:symmetric information, but they depend onf(b)under symmetric ignorance. The graph
38:1620:75547:22:21:72:539:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shows that, asf(b)decreases, the badθ-state is less likely and the price schedule under

38:1623:75804:22:21:89:539:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:More generally, the benchmark price schedules look similar in terms of both shape and

38:1625:75981:22:22:72:540:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we show formally that average prices are indeed the same in the symmetric benchmarks.

38:1635:76873:22:22:72:540:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:auctions because a fraction of bids are locked in at high prices. Hence low marginal prices
38:1636:76964:22:21:72:540:187:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:apply only to the residual bids needed to cover any additional demand shocks, while low

40:1731:79640:21:22:89:539:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Observe first that the spread between the high-quality and low-quality price sched-
40:1732:79723:22:22:72:539:199:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ules  is  increasing  inn.   Whennis  large,  uninformed  investors  thus  face  a  substantial
40:1733:79818:22:21:72:540:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:adverse selection problem:  if they bid on the high-quality schedule,  they will overpay
40:1734:79906:21:22:72:540:156:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the bad state since the government is sure to accept their high-state bids and executes
40:1735:79996:22:22:72:539:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:them at the bid price.  Fornsufficiently large (n= 0.6in our example), the uninformed
40:1736:80081:22:21:72:540:112:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:may therefore refrain from placing any bids on the high-price schedule. This has two ef-
40:1737:80169:21:0:72:540:91:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fects. First, the an uninformed investors who bids only on the low-price schedule knows
41:1738:80258:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that,conditionalon a bid being accepted, the state must be bad.  Hence they choose the
41:1739:80344:22:22:71:539:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:same portfolio as informed investors whenθ=b, and the low-quality schedule is locally
41:1740:80429:22:21:71:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:independent ofn.  Second, precisely because the uninformed do not participate at high
41:1741:80514:21:22:71:539:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prices, informed investors have to buy more bonds per capita in the good state, and are
41:1742:80601:22:22:71:539:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:therefore disproportionately exposed to the government’s default risk.   Since there are
41:1743:80689:22:21:71:540:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fewer participants asndecreases (above and beyond the lack of participation generated
41:1744:80774:21:22:71:370:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by the demand shock), the high-price schedule must fall.
41:1745:80830:22:22:89:539:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Whennis sufficiently small (n= 0.4in our example), prices on the high-quality sched-
41:1746:80914:22:21:71:539:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ule are low enough such that the uninformed investors are less worried about adverse
41:1747:80998:21:22:71:539:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:selection and begin to bid on both price schedules. Since bids on the high-price schedule
41:1748:81087:22:22:71:539:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are also executed in the bad state, there is less residual demand that needs to be met by
41:1749:81176:22:21:71:476:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:marginal bids on the low-price schedule. Hence the low-price schedule rises.
41:1750:81252:21:22:89:540:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f10:A:The adverse selection effect continues to operate asndecreases further (ton=  0.1
41:1751:81333:22:22:71:539:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in  our  example).   In  particular,  because  the  per-capita  bids  of  the  uninformed  remain
41:1752:81430:22:21:71:540:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:below those of the informed on the high-price schedule, reductions inncontinue to fur-
41:1753:81516:21:22:72:540:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ther concentrate default risk in informed portfolios.   This forces a large fraction of the
41:1754:81607:22:22:72:539:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:high-quality schedule to drop below theuninformedprice schedule. That is, the adverse
41:1755:81692:22:21:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:selection effect may be severe enough that prices are lower than in the uninformed equi-

41:1757:81861:22:22:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the figure), price schedules start overlapping.  Uninformed investors are now willing
41:1758:81949:22:21:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to participate fully on both schedules, and, as the next result shows, prices converge to

41:1762:82226:32:21:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f6:F:Remark 7.Despite the fact that bid overhang never binds in DP auction,  it is  instructive  to
41:1763:82320:21:22:71:539:137:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:F:revisit its role in our auction model here.  Specifically, once the uninformed start bidding on the
41:1764:82419:22:22:71:539:115:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:F:high-quality  schedule,  their  overhanging  bids  impact  the  equilibrium  prices  at  the  low-quality
41:1765:82524:22:21:71:539:93:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:F:schedule in a manner reminiscent of the way the bid-overhang constraint affected the UP auction:
41:1766:82620:21:0:71:539:72:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:F:they drag up the prices on the low-quality schedule by forcing the execution of some high-price bids
42:1767:82722:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:F:originally intended for a different state. Nevertheless, the mechanism is quite different, because the
42:1768:82824:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:F:uninformed investors’ accumulated bids reduce the available supply of bonds for the informed and
42:1769:82920:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:F:thereby raise prices.   Another key difference is while the bid-overhang constraint restricted the
42:1770:83018:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:F:set of equilibria in the UP auction, in DP auctions the overhanging bids act on the nature of the
42:1771:83115:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:F:equilibrium.  The bid-overhang does not induce a pooling of prices as the inference is not at each
42:1772:83213:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:F:price but instead in-the-money set.  The bid-overhang operates as soon as uninformed investors
42:1773:83307:21:22:72:539:578:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:F:start bidding at prices in the high-quality schedule (around0.4in the example) and not when
42:1774:83398:22:22:72:539:556:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:F:they become the marginal investor (atn=ηMas in the UP auction example).  Even though the
42:1775:83486:22:21:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:F:bid-overhang constraint operates differently in both protocols, it remains the force that guarantees
42:1776:83586:21:40:72:304:513:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:convergence of price schedules in both asn→0.

42:1784:84199:21:22:72:539:313:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ever, changes the ex-ante expected probability of defaultκU, which is critical in determin-

42:1786:84372:22:21:72:539:269:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:once the bid-overhang constraint operates, at relatively lown, the parameterf(b)does af-
42:1787:84460:21:22:72:540:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fect prices. In the UP auction, the point at which the bid-overhang constraint binds is just
42:1788:84552:22:22:72:539:226:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:B:ηM, independent off(b).  Conditional on binding,f(b)affects the inference problem and

42:1790:84726:21:22:72:540:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:duces the likelihood that the uninformed buys an overpriced bad bond, speeding up and
42:1791:84811:22:22:72:540:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increasing the participation of the uninformed on the high-quality schedule. This in turn
42:1792:84900:22:21:72:539:139:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:implies that the low price schedule begins to rise for higher values ofn.  Contrary to the
42:1793:84990:21:22:72:540:118:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:UP auction, the point at which the bid-overhang constraint operates thus does depend on
42:1794:85077:22:0:72:330:96:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:B:f(b). This is summarized in the next proposition.

43:1797:85218:30:21:72:540:637:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We  now  examine  the  implications  of  the  choice  auction  protocol  from  the  perspective
43:1798:85313:21:22:72:540:616:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the government for different values ofn.  Rather than explicitly specifying a govern-
43:1799:85401:22:22:71:539:594:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ment payoff function, we simply assume that the government (i) prefers to sell bonds at
43:1800:85488:22:21:71:539:572:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:high prices (or equivalently, low yields), and (ii) dislikes price volatility stemming from
43:1801:85579:21:22:71:336:551:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:demand shocks, since these are outside its control.

43:1807:85719:39:22:71:539:450:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In UP auctions, all bonds are sold at the same price, and we can simply compute the equi-

43:1809:85894:22:21:71:539:406:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:weighted average yield using the individual yields on all sold bonds. This average yield
43:1810:85982:21:22:71:539:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:captures the risk-neutral component of the government’s payoff.  Note that the govern-
43:1811:86068:22:22:71:539:363:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ment’s debt burden can be defined asD/P=D(1 +Y ield). Hence the government faces
43:1812:86148:22:21:71:440:341:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a higher average debt burden if bonds trade at a higher average yield.

43:1817:86553:22:22:89:539:233:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f10:A:Compare first the benchmarks of symmetric information (n= 1) and ignorance (n=
43:1818:86631:22:21:72:539:211:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f3:B:0).  Given that average prices and total bids are the same across auction protocols under
43:1819:86720:21:22:72:540:190:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:symmetry,  so are average yields.   The average conditional variance of the yield,  while
43:1820:86809:22:19:72:540:168:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:small in both cases, is substantially lower in the DP auction, however.  As we discussed
43:1821:86897:19:16:82:539:149:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:16There is also an ex-ante variance across quality bonds. Because we have made the default probabilities
43:1822:87001:16:12:72:540:133:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:so different in order to allow for perfect replication in the UP auction, the differences across quality shocks
43:1823:87112:12:11:72:540:121:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:swamp the conditional variance in our numerical example.  However, this would not be true when these
43:1824:87212:11:12:72:540:110:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:differences  were  smaller.   For  example,  iff(g)→0,  almost  all  bond  yield  volatility  is  due  to  demand
43:1825:87325:12:12:71:539:98:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:shocks rather than quality shocks. For this reason, we have chosen to focus on the behavior of the average

44:1870:88142:22:21:72:539:410:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:slope of price schedules conditional on aθ-state, and these are flatter in DP auctions. The
44:1871:88233:21:22:72:527:389:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:average yield is lower under symmetric ignorance than under symmetric information.

44:1874:88483:21:22:72:540:324:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:yield rises monotonically until the point of perfect replication, and is constant thereafter
44:1875:88575:22:22:72:539:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as the equilibrium becomes invariant with respect ton.  In contrast, the average condi-
44:1876:88662:22:21:72:540:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tional variance of the yield shows a strong non-monotonicity in the region in which the
44:1877:88749:21:22:72:540:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bid-overhang constraint binds. The reason is that the bid-overhang constraint forces price
44:1878:88839:22:22:72:539:237:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pooling, thereby steepening the slope of overlapping price schedules asngrows.  Steep
44:1879:88924:22:21:72:519:215:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price schedules imply that equilibrium prices are highly sensitive to demand shocks.

44:1882:89179:22:21:72:540:150:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:face adverse selection because bid on the high-quality schedule are also accepted in the
44:1883:89267:21:22:72:540:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bad state. This depresses prices on the high-quality schedule to an extent that is not fully
44:1884:89359:22:22:72:539:107:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f13:B:compensated by an increase of the low-quality schedule.  Indeed, theadverse selection
44:1885:89444:22:0:72:539:85:12:g_d0_f13:12:g_d0_f3:B:effectgrows in importance asnrises, up to the point where uninformed investor stop
45:1886:89528:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bidding on the high-quality schedule. When only informed investors participate, further
45:1887:89615:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increases innlead to lower per-capita risk exposure.   As a result,  informed investors’
45:1888:89703:22:21:72:539:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:information rents are gradually competed away asngrows.  (Bad-state prices are unaf-
45:1889:89787:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fected because the uninformed choose the same portfolio as the informed conditional on
45:1890:89873:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the bad state.)  Thiscannibalization effectraises prices in the good state and reduces the
45:1891:89963:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:yield asn→1. In contrast to UP auctions, the conditional variance is small for alln. The
45:1892:90051:21:22:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reason again is that the lion’s share of expenditures is made at the highest bid price. Large
45:1893:90144:22:22:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:demand shocks thus necessitate only a marginal price adjustment.  Furthermore, the ab-
45:1894:90230:22:21:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sence of the bid-overhang constraint means that price schedules need not be as steep as
45:1895:90317:21:22:72:385:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in a UP auction, reducing the sensitivity to demand shocks.
45:1896:90376:22:22:89:539:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The choice of auction protocol thus leads to arisk-return tradeoffbetween average
45:1897:90457:22:21:72:540:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:yields and volatility for the government. When information is symmetric, both protocols
45:1898:90544:21:22:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:deliver the same average prices, but DP auctions offer lower exposure to demand shocks.
45:1899:90631:22:22:72:540:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Whennis relatively low, average yields are similar (and increasing inn), but UP protocols
45:1900:90720:22:21:72:539:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:feature more exposure to demand shocks. Whennis relatively large (in particular, when
45:1901:90805:21:22:72:540:383:12:g_d0_f7:12:g_d0_f3:B:nis such that the UP auction allows for perfect replication), the UP auction still displays
45:1902:90896:22:22:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a larger conditional variance, but a smaller average yield.  The resolution of this tradeoff
45:1903:90988:22:21:72:509:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:depends on the government’s preferences for lower average yields versus volatiliy.
45:1904:91070:21:22:89:539:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Note that Figure 7 shows average yields and conditional variances for two different
45:1905:91153:22:22:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:values off(b).  When the ex-ante probability that the bond is of low quality is smaller
45:1906:91240:22:21:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(f(b)  =  0.25instead off(b)  =  0.5), average yields and volatility falls for alln.  This is
45:1907:91333:21:22:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quite natural as the bond is less likely to default. More interestingly, the peak in average
45:1908:91425:22:22:72:539:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:yields in DP auctions occurs for highernwhenf(b)is lower. This is because uninformed
45:1909:91509:22:22:72:540:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investors are less afraid of bidding on the hiqh-quality schedule because the risk of over-

45:1911:91701:21:22:72:539:166:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relatively high values ofn.   In the figure,  the peak in average yields occurs at around

46:1938:92596:188:21:89:539:353:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In the benchmark symmetric ignorance case, the utility levels obtained by informed
46:1939:92678:21:22:72:540:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and uninformed investors, respectively, are the same in both protocols.  This is because
46:1940:92766:22:22:72:540:310:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prices are not contingent onθatn=  0,  and so there are no price differences that can
46:1941:92851:22:21:72:540:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be differentially exploited across protocols by an atomistic informed investors.   This is
46:1942:92941:21:22:72:539:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:not the case in the symmetric information benchmark (n= 1), however. While informed
46:1943:93024:22:22:72:540:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investors obtain the same payoffs in both protocols, the uninformed payoff is substan-
46:1944:93110:22:21:72:540:223:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tially different. In the UP auction, informed investors can perfectly replicate the informed
46:1945:93202:21:22:72:540:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:portfolio, and they thus obtain the same same payoff as well.  In the DP auction, perfect
46:1946:93291:22:22:72:540:180:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:replication is not attainable because the uninformed would pay higher prices in the bad
46:1947:93378:22:21:72:533:158:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:state. Hence they earn achieve lower utility than uninformed investors in a UP auction.
46:1948:93465:21:22:89:539:137:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:When information is asymmetric, the comparative statics of both informed and un-

46:1950:93633:22:21:71:539:93:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tocols.  First, consider uninformed investors.  In a UP auction, uninformed utility is in-
46:1951:93723:21:0:71:539:72:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:creasing innbecause (partial) portfolio replication allows the uninformed to free ride
47:1952:93811:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on the information impounded into prices by informed investors, of which there is more
47:1953:93897:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:when there are more informed investors. In a DP auction, instead, the degree of adverse
47:1954:93984:22:21:72:399:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:selection is increasing inn, and hence so is uninformed utility.
47:1955:94048:21:22:89:539:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Next, consider informed investors.  In a UP auction, all investors pay the same price.
47:1956:94134:22:22:71:539:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Since informed investors bid more aggressively than uninformed investors on average,
47:1957:94218:22:21:71:539:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an increase innraises prices and lowers rents. Hence informed investor utility is decreas-

47:1959:94392:22:22:72:539:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and payoffs are invariant ton.)  In a DP auction, bids are executed at the bid price, and
47:1960:94481:22:21:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f7:B:uninformed investors face adverse selection.  Ifnis small to begin with, increases inn
47:1961:94567:21:22:71:539:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increase the severity of adverse selection, and uninformed investors participate less and
47:1962:94656:22:22:71:539:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:less. This reduced participation lowers prices on average, leading to an increase in infra-
47:1963:94747:22:21:71:539:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:marginal rents and utility earned by informed investors. Once we reach the point where
47:1964:94833:21:22:71:539:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the uninformed no longer participate on the high-state schedule, the comparative static
47:1965:94920:22:22:71:539:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reverses.  Now, further increases innjust serve to increase competition for bonds in the
47:1966:95008:22:21:71:539:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:high-state, leading to price increases that erode information rents.  (The utility level ob-
47:1967:95100:21:22:71:539:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tained in the low state is constant, since both informed and uninformed investor choose
47:1968:95187:22:22:71:539:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the same portfolio.)  Importantly, the value of information is strictly positive even in the
47:1969:95279:22:21:71:345:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:limitn→1where prices are fully revealing ex-post.
47:1970:95328:21:22:89:539:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The figure also shows the comparison between two different levels off(b).  A lower

50:2053:100006:30:22:72:540:617:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:A classical question in general equilibrium theory pertains to where the information con-
50:2054:100095:22:21:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tained in prices comes from.  Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) argued that price-taking in-
50:2055:100182:21:22:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:vestors have no incentive to look at or acquire their private information if this informa-
50:2056:100272:22:22:72:540:552:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tion is already encapsulated in the price. But if their demands do not reflect their private
50:2057:100364:22:21:72:540:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:information, then how do prices reflect this information in the first place?  If acquiring
50:2058:100454:21:22:72:540:509:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:information is costly, this question manifests itself as a nonexistence problem known as
50:2059:100542:22:22:72:540:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the Grossman-Stiglitz paradox: when information is costly and prices are fully revealing,
50:2060:100631:22:21:72:540:465:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:no individual wants to acquire information.  We now discuss in detail how our auction
50:2061:100716:21:22:72:249:444:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model circumvents this difficulty.
50:2062:100750:22:22:89:539:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We can replicate the nonexistence problem in our UP auction if parameters are such
50:2063:100832:22:21:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f6:B:that  prices  are  fully  revealing  ex-post  givenn=  1andwe  simply  assume  that  the  bid-
50:2064:100926:21:22:72:540:379:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f3:B:overhang constraint does not exist. In the absence of the bid-overhang constraint, replication
50:2065:101020:22:22:72:539:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:atn= 1implies that replication is feasible for alln >0. Hence the value of information is
50:2066:101109:22:21:72:540:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:zero for alln >0, but positive forn= 0.  It follows that there is a non-existence problem
50:2067:101198:21:22:72:528:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:if the cost of information is strictly between zero and the value of information atn= 0.

50:2069:101366:22:21:72:540:270:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the auction protocol, eliminates this non-existence problem. Specifically, the bid-overhang
50:2070:101457:21:22:72:540:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:constraint hinders perfect replication for low levels ofn,  eliminating the discontinuity
50:2071:101546:22:22:72:539:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of information gains atn= 0, and thus inducing equilibrium existence.  Grossman and
50:2072:101629:22:21:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Stiglitz (1980) proposed a solution by adding a second source of noise to prevent the price
50:2073:101720:21:22:72:539:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:system being invertible.17In contrast we do not need to impose sufficient noise to pre-
50:2074:101807:22:22:72:540:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:vent prices from be fully revealing. Instead, the auction protocol forces pooling when the
50:2075:101897:22:17:72:540:140:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fraction of informed investors is low enough, endogenously ensuring that prices are not

50:2077:102085:16:12:72:540:107:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:is well known to be problematic, see Allen and Jordan (1998) for a survey of the existence literature.  The
50:2078:102192:12:12:72:540:95:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:combination of CARA preferences and jointly normal shocks was key to the construction of an equilibrium
50:2079:102295:12:11:72:540:83:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:in Grossman and Stiglitz (1980), though recently Breon-Drish (2015) has developed a characterization that
50:2080:102400:11:0:72:167:72:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:drops joint normality.
51:2081:102424:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fully revealing for any fixed level of noise. Hence an equilibrium with costly information
51:2082:102514:22:22:72:356:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:acquisition exists and lies endogenously in this range.
51:2083:102569:22:21:89:539:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The contrast is even starker in a DP auction.  In these auctions, the fact that bids are
51:2084:102657:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:executed at the bid price provides incentives to acquire information even when prices
51:2085:102742:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are  fully  revealing  ex-post.   The  fact  that  informed  investors  pay  the  correct  marginal
51:2086:102841:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price in every state thus allows for informational efficiency even with costly information

51:2089:102974:35:21:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This paper is motivated by the complex dynamics of sovereign debt yields in primary

51:2091:103150:22:22:72:540:447:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:contribution of our model to the sovereign debt literature. In this section we discuss how
51:2092:103240:22:21:72:540:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:our work relates three additional strands of literature. The first concerns the foundations
51:2093:103331:21:22:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of general equilibrium theory (GE) and the question of where market-clearing prices come
51:2094:103419:22:22:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from. The second concerns the question of how the private information held by multiple
51:2095:103505:22:21:72:540:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investors is aggregated into prices.  The third consists of auction-theoretic models with a
51:2096:103596:21:22:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:large number of bidders and perfectly divisible goods with uncertain common value, and
51:2097:103682:22:22:72:393:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the empirical application of such models to sovereign bonds.
51:2098:103742:22:21:89:539:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:With respect to the question of where prices come from, a key characteristic of GE the-
51:2099:103829:21:22:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ory is that the price vector is an endogenous object that is not chosen by anyone, yet is
51:2100:103918:22:22:72:540:252:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:determined by the accumulated actions of individuals who think of themselves as unable
51:2101:104004:22:21:72:540:230:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to affect prices. To get around this conundrum, Walras made up his fictional ”auctioneer”
51:2102:104093:21:22:72:540:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that matches total supply and total demand in perfectly competitive market with perfect
51:2103:104180:22:22:72:540:187:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:information and no transaction costs. But this has long been considered a thought exper-
51:2104:104268:22:21:72:540:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:iment that did not adequately address the basic question of prices (see Hahn (1989) for a
51:2105:104357:21:22:72:134:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:discussion).

51:2107:104455:22:21:72:540:100:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:literature introduces a fuller description of the environment in which all endogenous ob-
51:2108:104544:21:0:72:540:79:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:jects are selected by the agents (including prices) based upon noncooperative game the-
52:2109:104633:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ory.18Examples of this market game approach include Rubinstein and Wolinsky (1985)’s
52:2110:104717:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sequential bargaining model in which buyers and sellers are paired up under complete

52:2112:104827:21:22:89:539:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The price problem, however, becomes more severe once prices have to simultaneously
52:2113:104909:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:clear markets and aggregate information, as in Lucas (1972), Radner (1979) and Grossman
52:2114:104996:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and Stiglitz (1980).  Because agents ”need to know” both the price functionandthe real-
52:2115:105083:21:22:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ized price in order to make inferences and determine their individual demands, this leads
52:2116:105172:22:22:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to the complementary question of where the information in prices comes from.20The rel-

52:2118:105342:21:22:72:540:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Stiglitz (1980), who discuss how fully revealing information prices are logically impossi-
52:2119:105432:22:22:72:91:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ble.
52:2120:105436:22:21:89:539:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:But  even  if  there  exists  a  fully  revealing  equilibrium,  there  is  an  implementability
52:2121:105532:21:22:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:problem because it may not be possible to find a trading mechanism that induces it. Kyle
52:2122:105620:22:22:72:540:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(1989) proposes a resolution using non-competitive rational expectations model in which
52:2123:105707:22:21:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:agents submit limit orders (or demand schedules, as in our case) taking into account their
52:2124:105797:21:22:72:540:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:effect on the equilibrium price. In a similar vein, Jackson (1991) proposes an environment
52:2125:105887:22:22:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in which the number of agents is finite and all agents internalize that the extent of infor-
52:2126:105979:22:21:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mation in prices depends upon the demand schedule they submit, while Golosov, Loren-

52:2128:106151:22:22:72:539:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bilateral meetings with take-it-or-leave-it offers.21Finally, Vives (2014) and Gaballo and

52:2130:106329:21:22:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:each trader has both common and private value components, and the costly signal bun-
52:2131:106413:22:22:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dles information about these two components, such that prices can be fully revealing and
52:2132:106501:22:19:72:318:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:yet there are incentives to acquire information.

52:2136:106762:15:9:72:213:151:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:the number of agents gets large.

52:2138:106892:15:12:72:540:127:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:with incomplete information where traders make quantity offers to buy and sell and the price is determined
52:2139:106998:12:12:72:540:115:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:by the ratio of the total buy versus sell offers. Here information revelation occurs largely in one-step through
52:2140:107110:12:9:72:300:103:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:the vector of different prices for the different goods.

53:2143:107352:0:22:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our paper speaks to both of these problematic aspects of GE by using the structure
53:2144:107434:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of an auction to provide answer to the question of where prices come from, and under
53:2145:107518:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:what conditions there are incentives to acquire and impound information into prices even
53:2146:107606:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:when these are fully revealing ex-post. By specifying the auction protocol, our model fea-
53:2147:107696:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tures a specific order of moves.   First,  investors submit their bids (where each bid is a
53:2148:107787:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price-quantity pair).  Second, a specific protocol is used to select the bids which are ac-
53:2149:107878:21:22:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cepted and the prices at which they are executed. Information revelation occurs after the
53:2150:107967:22:22:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:marginal price at the auction is revealed.  The information that is revealed may be com-
53:2151:108055:22:21:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:plete, as in REE model, but still there are incentives to acquire information because the
53:2152:108144:21:22:72:540:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:information is revealed only once bids can no longer be changed. A related paper which
53:2153:108230:22:22:72:540:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:takes an auction-based approach to micro found REE is Milgrom (1981).  He considers,
53:2154:108314:22:21:72:540:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:however, an auction in which bidders are restricted in the units they can by and where
53:2155:108400:21:22:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the price is not clouded by a demand (or supply) shocks. Our paper relaxes both of these
53:2156:108488:22:22:72:113:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:aspects.
53:2157:108496:22:21:89:539:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our paper also contributes to the auction literature on multi-unit auctions more gen-

53:2162:108933:22:22:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equilibrium that involves bidders with a double dimensional strategic problem: choosing
53:2163:109020:22:21:72:539:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:both bid quantities and bid prices.24By assuming the limiting case of price taking, our set-
53:2164:109112:21:22:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ting allows to change the focus from bidding strategic considerations to how the auction
53:2165:109200:22:22:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:protocol determine prices by aggregating bids and motivating information acquisition.
53:2166:109285:22:22:72:540:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In single-unit auctions, Eso and White (2004) consider the interaction of ex-post risk and

53:2168:109419:21:22:89:539:166:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Recent work tackles these questions of how multiunit auctions determine prices in

54:2175:109973:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of potential risk-neutral bidders with symmetric and independent private values, using
54:2176:110059:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:data from Turkish Treasury auctions to estimate those bidders’ private values.  In their
54:2177:110147:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model the symmetric equilibrium bidding functions depend on how an individual bid
54:2178:110228:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:changes the probability distribution of the market clearing price, a complicated object to
54:2179:110318:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:characterize analytically. Given this theoretical difficulty, they construct a non-parametric
54:2180:110411:21:22:72:470:578:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:consistent estimator of the distribution exploiting a resampling technique.25
54:2181:110488:22:22:89:539:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In contrast to this empirical approach, our work is based on the presumption that bid-
54:2182:110574:22:21:71:539:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ders’ valuations of the auctioned treasury bonds are perfectly correlated (common value)
54:2183:110662:21:22:71:539:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:instead  of  independent  (private  value).   Unfortunately,  sorting  out  which  assumption
54:2184:110755:22:22:71:539:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is more applicable for treasury bonds is challenging.  As argued by Laffont and Vuong
54:2185:110840:22:21:71:539:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(1996), ”common value” and ”independent value” auctions are (nearly) observationally
54:2186:110924:21:22:71:539:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:equivalent, unless there are exogenous variations that allow for identification.  As a re-
54:2187:111014:22:22:71:539:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sponse, Hortac ̧su and Kastl (2012) use Canadian treasury auctions to test whether com-
54:2188:111101:22:21:71:539:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mon values or private values are a better representation of the motivations to buy treasury
54:2189:111192:21:22:71:539:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bonds. Even though they conclude that there is no evidence that dealers, who observe the
54:2190:111280:22:22:71:539:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bids of costumers, learn about fundamentals from those costumers, this is not prima fa-

54:2192:111455:21:22:71:364:318:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:B:information than costumers about the common value.26
54:2193:111507:22:22:89:539:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:A second relevant difference between our approach and this empirical literature is that
54:2194:111594:22:21:71:539:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we assume investors are risk averse, not risk neutral. This departure is not only relevant
54:2195:111684:21:19:71:539:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for the interpretation of the shading factor (as argued by Wilson (1979)) but also critical
54:2196:111775:19:16:82:539:234:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:25Kastl  (2011)  extended  Wilson  model,  which  is  based  on  continuous  and  differentiable  functions,  to
54:2197:111887:16:12:72:540:218:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:more realistic discrete-step functions, showing that in such case only upper and lower bounds on private
54:2198:111991:12:8:72:536:206:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:valuations can be identified, which he does by using the previously methodology on Czech bills auctions.
54:2199:112095:8:16:82:539:198:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:26In Canada,  some bidders (dealers) are allowed to observe the bonds of another set of bidders (cos-
54:2200:112196:16:12:72:540:182:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:tumers) when preparing their own bids.  In a private value auction, observing the bid of a costumer only
54:2201:112300:12:12:72:540:170:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:gives information about the competition the dealer faces (and then the probability of winning the auction)
54:2202:112406:12:12:72:540:158:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:but not about the fundamental value of the bond.  In this case the dealer would not revise the bid if this
54:2203:112512:12:12:72:540:146:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:was higher than the observed competing bid. In a common value price auction, however, observing a cos-
54:2204:112614:12:12:72:540:134:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:tumer’s bid induce learning not only of competition but also of the fundamental, leading to a revision of
54:2205:112719:12:12:72:540:122:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:the intended bid also when the bid was higher that the observed competing bid.  Since Canadian auctions
54:2206:112822:12:12:72:540:110:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:are discriminatory, this testable implication is not as straightforward, but they propose a correction. With a

55:2212:113374:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shocks, departing heavily from the assumptions of independent realizations across bid-
55:2213:113460:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ders.  The quality shock, the demand shocks and the signal that all informed investors
55:2214:113546:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:receive are perfectly correlated, which implies that bid shading only happens for unin-
55:2215:113633:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:formed investors in response to the possibility of adverse selection, but not because of
55:2216:113721:21:22:72:172:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:competitive forces.
55:2217:113740:22:22:89:539:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Closer to our setting, Boyarchenko, Lucca, and Veldkamp (2017) study an auction en-
55:2218:113823:22:21:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:vironment with risk averse investors that are asymmetrically informed about the common
55:2219:113909:21:22:72:540:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:value of a bond.  They assume that some investors have both superior information and

55:2222:114167:21:22:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more as they become better informed.  By focusing on the assumption that investors are
55:2223:114253:22:22:72:540:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price-takers we are able to study the effect of asymmetric information on prices instead

55:2227:114461:35:21:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We study the determination of sovereign bond yields in primary market auctions.  We
55:2228:114544:21:22:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:view this as an important departure from the literature on sovereign debt that focuses on
55:2229:114633:22:22:72:540:252:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:secondary market prices, because primary market prices are an input to the government’s
55:2230:114720:22:21:72:540:230:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:budget constraint. We start from the perspective that accounting for the evolution of bond
55:2231:114810:21:22:72:540:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prices at issuance necessitates a wide range of shocks, some public, some private, some
55:2232:114897:22:22:72:540:187:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:learnable, some not. Some of these shocks may affect common factors, like the probability
55:2233:114986:22:21:72:540:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of default, while others may affect the private valuation of the government’s bonds, like
55:2234:115075:21:22:72:540:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:liquidity shocks.  This leads us to develop a rich model of sovereign debt auctions fea-
55:2235:115163:22:22:72:540:122:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:turing shocks to both the default probability of the bond (about which investors can be
55:2236:115250:22:21:72:540:100:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:heterogeneously informed), and a correlated private shock that determines auction par-
55:2237:115336:21:0:72:540:79:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ticipation (about which no investor is informed). This setting provides new insights into
56:2238:115427:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the impact of different auction protocols on the role and extent of information asymmetry
56:2239:115516:22:22:72:318:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on bond prices in the presence of these shocks.
56:2240:115563:22:21:89:539:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We find that these two protocols behave the same in terms of payoffs and yields when
56:2241:115647:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:information (or lack of information) is symmetric, albeit with discriminatory-price auc-
56:2242:115735:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tions offering a lower variation in the yields in response to demand shocks.  These sym-
56:2243:115823:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:metric cases can be thought of as occurring during tranquil periods when there is no in-
56:2244:115911:21:22:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:formation to be obtained about the government’s future likelihood of default, or during
56:2245:115998:22:22:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:eventful periods in which this information is publicly and freely available.  Our model
56:2246:116085:22:21:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:also implies that when there is valuable information that can be learned at a cost,  this
56:2247:116174:21:22:72:540:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:induces adverse selection that can lead to a wide dispersion in realized auction prices
56:2248:116261:22:22:72:540:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and high average yields in discriminatory-price auctions, as uninformed investors are re-
56:2249:116350:22:21:72:540:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:luctant to participate.  While we find that the gains from acquiring information and the
56:2250:116438:21:22:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:adverse selection effects are smaller in uniform price auctions, the conditional variance
56:2251:116527:22:22:72:540:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of prices is higher under this protocol.   Finally,  we show that the fraction of informed
56:2252:116617:22:21:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:investors is never higher in uniform price auctions that in discriminatory auctions, with
56:2253:116706:21:22:72:540:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:these last ones also displaying multiple equilibria (one with no investor informed and
56:2254:116792:22:22:72:278:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:another with asymmetric information).
56:2255:116829:22:21:89:540:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:These results contribute to the wide discussion, dating back at least to Friedman (1960),
56:2256:116918:21:22:72:540:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of whether sovereign debt auctions should be conducted with a uniform-price or a price-
56:2257:117005:22:22:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:discriminating protocol.27Our results suggest that the answer to this question is far from
56:2258:117095:22:21:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:straightforward and depends on the nature of shocks, the relative preference of the gov-
56:2259:117183:21:22:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ernment for low average yields or low volatility, the cost of information that determines
56:2260:117272:22:22:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the extent to which investors acquire information and the impact of asymmetric informa-

56:2262:117406:22:21:89:539:187:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our model can potentially speak to the kind of data we see in sovereign debt auction,
56:2263:117491:21:22:72:540:166:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:such as the case of Mexican bonds in figure 1.  During crisis periods, when the range of
56:2264:117579:22:19:72:540:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:potential default probabilities increase, the model predicts a sharp rise and highly volatile
56:2265:117672:19:15:82:539:125:7:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:27Friedman proposed (pp 64-65) that the U.S. Treasury abandons its previous price-discriminating prac-
56:2266:117774:15:12:72:540:110:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:tice and make all awards at the stopout price instead of at differing prices down through that price. The U.S.
56:2267:117884:12:12:72:540:98:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:Treasury finally adopted this uniform-price protocol for all auctions of 2-year and 5-year notes on Septem-

56:2269:118098:12:0:72:509:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:F:Friedman’s proposal include Goldstein (1962), Friedman (1963), Rieber (1964) and Friedman (1964).
57:2270:118197:0:22:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interest rates, as those we see during Mexican ”Tequila Crisis” of 1995. When the level of a
57:2271:118289:22:22:72:540:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:country’s indebtedness increase there is a substantial pressure for information acquisition
57:2272:118380:22:21:72:540:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and information asymmetry (specially under discriminatory-price auctions), decreasing
57:2273:118465:21:22:72:540:643:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:participation of uninformed investors under the threat of adverse selection and increas-
57:2274:118553:22:22:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ing interest rates even when the quality shock is good.  This reduction in participation
57:2275:118641:22:21:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is also reminiscent of the decline in bids and failed auctions that we commonly observe
57:2276:118728:21:22:72:540:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:during crises.  At the same time, under either symmetric information or symmetric ig-
57:2277:118813:22:22:72:540:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:norance when there is little heterogeneity, the additional risk premia associated with de-
57:2278:118903:22:21:72:540:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mand shocks is small. This illustrates how the model can also accommodate the relatively
57:2279:118991:21:22:72:409:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:low volatility of the Mexican Cetes interest rates in recent years.
57:2280:119058:22:22:89:539:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In a follow-up paper (Cole, Neuhann, and Ordonez (2016)) we examine the implica-
57:2281:119138:22:21:72:540:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tions of discriminatory-price auctions within a two-country setting.  We use the insights
57:2282:119227:21:22:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:developed here to discuss spillovers of information across countries and the role of sec-
57:2283:119316:22:22:72:540:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ondary markets.  We show that the sources of complementarities on information acqui-
57:2284:119400:22:21:72:540:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sition inherent to discriminatory-price auctions extend from cross-states to cross-bonds
57:2285:119488:21:22:72:507:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and generate spillovers in sovereign spreads even in the absence of other linkages.
57:2286:119571:22:22:89:539:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our model is also applicable to a number of other important cases, including auctions
57:2287:119656:22:21:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of liquidity infusion by central banks, electricity, emission permits, gas, oil, and mineral
57:2288:119748:21:22:72:540:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rights.  The key requirement is that the auction involves a sufficiently ”thick” market for
57:2289:119839:22:22:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a homogenous divisible good of uncertain quality so as to make the price-taking assump-

67:2677:140144:15:14:71:539:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and this price will now be the same as a top point on the low-price schedule where out-
67:2678:140231:14:14:71:539:348:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:comes must be determined point-by-point along with the inference parameter ̃κof the

67:2685:140796:14:15:71:539:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and then it is more difficult for the uninformed investors alone to cover the revenue needs
67:2686:140887:15:41:71:258:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the government in the state[b,1].
