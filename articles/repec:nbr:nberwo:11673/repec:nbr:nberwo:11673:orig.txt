2:28:1467:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:Advances in structural demand estimation have substantially improved economists' ability to forecast
2:29:1567:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:the impact of mergers. However, these models rely on extensive assumptions about consumer choice
2:30:1663:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:and firm objectives, and ultimately observational methods are needed to test their validity. Observational
2:31:1769:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:studies, in turn, suffer from selection problems arising from the fact that merging entities differ from
2:32:1873:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:non-merging entities in unobserved ways. To obtain an accurate estimate of the effect of consummated
2:33:1973:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:mergers, I propose a combination of rival analysis and instrumental variables. By focusing on the effect
2:34:2077:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:of a merger on the behavior of rival firms, and instrumenting for these mergers, unbiased estimates
2:35:2176:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:of the effect of a merger on market outcomes can be obtained. Using this methodology, I evaluate
2:36:2272:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:the impact of independent hospital mergers between 1989 and 1996 on rivals' prices. I find sharp increases
2:37:2378:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:in rivals' prices following a merger, with the greatest effect on the closest rivals. The results for this
2:38:2484:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:industry are more consistent with predictions from structural models than with prior observational
2:39:2582:14:28:72:120:434:12:Times:12:Times:estimates.

3:48:2779:0:47:90:173:705:257:g_d0_f2:257:g_d0_f2:Introduction 
3:49:2792:47:28:90:497:658:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In recent years, economists have taken advantage of methodological advances in the 
3:50:2875:28:28:90:504:630:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:estimation of structural demand models to simulate the impact of horizontal mergers.  
3:51:2961:28:27:90:498:602:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The strengths of this approach are many, not least the ability to predict the impact of 
3:52:3049:27:28:89:512:575:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:future mergers rather than extrapolate from the experience of mergers that have already 
3:53:3137:28:27:89:485:547:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:occurred.   However, these models require extensive assumptions about consumer 
3:54:3216:27:28:89:519:520:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:demand and firm objectives, do not fully incorporate rivals’ reactions to actions taken by 
3:55:3307:28:28:89:487:492:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:merging parties, and are computationally intensive and challenging to implement.  
3:56:3389:28:27:89:514:464:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Moreover, the predictions generated by such models can only be validated by analyzing 
3:57:3475:27:28:89:513:437:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the effects of consummated mergers.  To date, the courts have also been more receptive 
3:58:3562:28:27:89:517:409:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to observational methods that provide “hard evidence” of the likely impact of merger, as 
3:59:3651:27:42:89:255:382:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:in the Staples-Office Depot case.1 
3:60:3685:42:27:126:508:340:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Unfortunately, most observational or “reduced-form” analyses of the impact of 
3:61:3763:27:28:89:516:313:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:mergers fail to address fundamental selection problems arising from the fact that merger 
3:62:3852:28:28:89:521:285:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:events are not randomly assigned.  These studies typically compare outcomes of merging 
3:63:3939:28:27:89:506:257:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:firms with those of non-merging firms.  The resulting estimates suffer from a classical 
3:64:4027:27:28:89:490:230:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:selection problem, as merging firms are likely different from non-merging firms in 
3:65:4110:28:27:89:479:202:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:unobserved ways that affect the outcomes of interest.  For example, suppose that 
3:66:4191:27:28:89:513:175:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:financially-distressed firms are more likely to be party to a merger, and post-merger the 
3:67:4281:28:27:89:520:147:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:new entities reduce costs and decrease prices.  Conditional on survival, these firms might 
3:68:4372:27:7:234:237:120:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                 
3:69:4420:7:16:90:515:113:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:1 In its successful attempt to block this merger, the FTC presented evidence that office supply prices were 
3:70:4528:16:12:90:509:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:lowest in markets where all three office supply superstores competed (Staples, Office Depot, and Office 
3:71:4632:12:11:90:517:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Max).  Prices were higher in markets with two competitors, and higher still in markets with a single office 
3:72:4740:11:0:90:463:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:supply superstore.   Federal Trade Commission v. Staples, Inc. and Office Depot, Inc., 1997. 
4:73:4832:0:27:90:524:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:have reduced costs and decreased prices even more absent a merger.  More generally, any 
4:74:4920:27:28:90:520:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:omitted factor that is correlated with the outcome measure as well as with the probability 
4:75:5011:28:41:89:405:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of merger will generate biased estimates of the impact of merger. 
4:76:5077:41:28:125:498:612:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Some studies enhance the basic differences-in-differences approach by using 
4:77:5153:28:28:90:503:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:matching algorithms to identify a superior control group (e.g. Dranove and Lindrooth 
4:78:5238:28:27:90:508:556:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:2003).  Yet another approach, introduced by Eckbo (1983), is to eliminate the merging 
4:79:5324:27:28:90:510:529:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:entities from the analysis entirely and to focus on the responses of rivals to mergers.  If 
4:80:5416:28:27:90:497:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:Times:merging parties exercise their newly-acquired market power by raising price, ceteris 
4:81:5501:27:28:90:519:474:144:Times:144:g_d0_f2:paribus their rivals will be able to raise price as well.2  Thus, rival analysis compares the 
4:82:5595:28:28:90:515:446:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:outcomes of firms with merging rivals to the outcomes of firms without merging rivals.  
4:83:5683:28:27:90:506:418:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:These results are also likely to be biased by selection, however, as firms with merging 
4:84:5771:27:42:90:382:391:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:rivals are likely different from firms without merging rivals. 
4:85:5834:42:27:125:521:349:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:This paper improves upon prior observational studies by combining rival analysis 
4:86:5915:27:28:90:522:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:with instrumental variables (IV).  I estimate the effect of a rival’s merger on a firm’s own 
4:87:6008:28:28:89:497:294:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:price, instrumenting for whether a firm is exposed to a rival’s merger.  Provided this 
4:88:6095:28:27:89:514:266:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:instrument is correlated with the probability of rival merger and uncorrelated with other 
4:89:6185:27:28:89:521:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:unobserved factors affecting a firm’s own price, this methodology will generate unbiased 
4:90:6274:28:27:89:509:211:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:estimates of the causal effect of merger on market-level outcomes.  I test this approach 
4:91:6363:27:28:89:466:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:using data on the general acute-care hospital industry in the U.S., a sector that 
4:92:6445:28:36:90:369:156:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:experienced a wave of merger activity during the 1990s.   
4:93:6503:36:7:234:237:120:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                 
4:94:6551:7:16:90:524:113:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:2 This argument assumes prices are strategic complements. Hospitals are typically modeled as differentiated 
4:95:6659:16:12:89:511:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Bertrand competitors, hence the assumption.  See Gaynor and Vogt (2003) for an excellent discussion of 
4:96:6762:12:11:89:513:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:prior theoretical and empirical work.  Rival analysis has also been used to infer the competitive effects of 
4:97:6871:11:0:89:371:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:other decisions, such as changes in capital structure (Chevalier 1995). 
5:98:6944:0:27:126:522:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The instrument I propose for merger in the hospital industry is co-location.  Using 
5:99:7028:27:28:90:509:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the exact latitude and longitude coordinates for each hospital’s main address in 1988, I 
5:100:7117:28:27:89:504:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:identify co-located or adjacent hospitals, defined as hospitals within 0.3 miles of each 
5:101:7206:27:28:89:514:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:other “as the crow files” and no more than 5 blocks apart.  Using this criterion, 191 (3.6 
5:102:7297:28:28:89:502:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:percent) of the 5,373 general, non-federal hospitals in the non-territorial U.S. in 1988 
5:103:7386:28:27:89:504:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:were co-located with at least one other hospital.  There are two reasons such hospitals 
5:104:7474:27:28:89:493:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:should be more likely to merge: the potential to cut costs through the elimination of 
5:105:7560:28:27:89:490:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:duplicate departments is greater, and the ability to increase price is greater because 
5:106:7647:27:28:89:510:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:location is a primary differentiating factor for inpatient care (Dranove and White 1994, 
5:107:7736:28:28:89:479:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Tay 2003).  This prediction is borne out in the data, which shows that co-located 
5:108:7818:28:27:89:506:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:hospitals are nearly three times as likely to merge as non-co-located hospitals, a factor 
5:109:7908:27:28:89:480:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:that is scarcely diminished after controlling for a large set of hospital and market 
5:110:7993:28:27:89:504:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:characteristics.  Thus, rival co-location is an excellent instrument for rival merger.  In 
5:111:8084:27:28:89:519:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:this study, a rival is defined as another hospital located within a certain distance from the 
5:112:8178:28:42:89:250:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:hospital in question, e.g. 7 miles. 
5:113:8214:42:27:125:511:280:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Using this instrument together with data on hospital mergers occurring between 
5:114:8293:27:28:89:502:253:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:1989 and 1996, I find evidence of substantial post-merger price increases by rivals of 
5:115:8380:28:27:89:500:225:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:merging hospitals.   These increases were realized by 1997; prices appear to stabilize 
5:116:8467:27:28:90:516:198:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:thereafter.  Price increases were greater among hospitals that were geographically closer 
5:117:8557:28:28:89:509:170:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to the merging parties. Failing to instrument for rivals’ mergers produces a statistically 
5:118:8648:28:0:89:309:142:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:insignificant estimate of less than 2 percent.   
6:119:8698:0:27:126:502:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The findings caution against analyses that compare merging and non-merging 
6:120:8773:27:28:90:508:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:firms, particularly in the same market, where reactions to rivals’ prices are likely.  The 
6:121:8864:28:27:90:515:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:estimates presented here are far more consistent with predictions from structural models 
6:122:8953:27:28:90:501:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of demand in similar settings (Capps, Dranove and Satterthwaite (2003); Gaynor and 
6:123:9036:28:28:90:497:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Vogt (2003)) than with estimates from prior observational studies (e.g. Connor et al. 
6:124:9122:28:27:90:488:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:1998), which generally find no effect or a negative effect of merger on price.  This 
6:125:9207:27:28:90:510:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:finding supports the use of structural models for prospective merger analysis.   Finally, 
6:126:9297:28:27:90:509:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the results suggest that hospital markets are far smaller than those typically adopted by 
6:127:9387:27:42:90:271:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:researchers, practitioners, and courts. 
6:128:9427:42:28:126:511:446:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The paper proceeds as follows.  Section 2 lays the theoretical foundation for the 
6:129:9509:28:27:90:489:418:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:empirical analysis.  Section 3 describes the hospital industry and summarizes prior 
6:130:9593:27:28:90:518:391:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:related research.  Section 4 defines the study samples and provides descriptive statistics.  
6:131:9686:28:27:90:485:363:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Section 5 presents the empirical specifications and results.  Section 6 explores the 
6:132:9771:27:46:90:449:336:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:sensitivity of the results to alternative specifications.  Section 7 concludes.

6:134:9893:47:27:90:479:243:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The theoretical foundation for my empirical strategy is a simple model of spatial 
6:135:9975:27:28:90:522:216:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:differentiation, Salop’s Circular City (1979).  Firms independently maximize their profits 
6:136:10066:28:28:90:500:188:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:taking others’ actions as given; differentiation among the firms produces equilibrium 
6:137:10152:28:27:90:514:160:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:prices that exceed costs.  In Salop’s model, the location of N firms along a circle of unit 
6:138:10244:27:36:90:474:133:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:circumference is exogenously determined.  Consumers of mass 1 are uniformly 
6:139:10320:36:7:234:237:97:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                 
6:140:10368:7:16:90:521:90:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:4Colocated hospitals are by definition undifferentiated, so under common ownership the price would be the 
6:141:10474:16:0:89:378:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:same regardless of the number of hospitals that remain open at the site.  
7:142:10549:0:27:90:482:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:distributed along the circle, and have unitary demand and value v for the product, 
7:143:10632:27:28:90:524:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:regardless of the firm supplying it.  When purchasing this product from firm j, consumer i 
7:144:10722:28:27:90:510:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:incurs transport costs of t·dij, where dij denotes the distance (along the circle) between i 
7:145:10814:27:28:90:480:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and j.  Transport costs can be viewed more generally as the costs associated with 
7:146:10896:28:28:90:521:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:consuming a product that differs from the consumer’s optimal product (i.e. a product that 
7:147:10986:28:27:90:514:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:coincides with her location in product space).  To illustrate the effect of a merger in this 
7:148:11079:27:28:89:524:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:setting, and particularly a merger of co-located firms, I solve Salop models that reflect the 
7:149:11173:28:41:89:329:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:market structures I use to identify merger effects. 
7:150:11225:41:28:125:518:474:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Gal-Or (1999) also uses the Salop circle to model competition in this sector, with 
7:151:11308:28:28:89:485:446:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:separate circles for hospitals and insurers in a given geographic market.  Gal-Or’s 
7:152:11392:28:27:89:516:418:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:treatment focuses on when it is optimal to merge without closing a facility post-merger,  
7:153:11482:27:28:89:523:391:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and on how this decision is influenced by the interaction between the market structures of 
7:154:11573:28:27:89:498:363:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the hospital and insurance sectors.  The closure decision is a non-issue in the present 
7:155:11661:27:28:89:492:336:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:setting, where the mergers of interest occur between co-located hospitals.4  I do not 
7:156:11747:28:28:90:511:308:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:model the interaction between hospitals and insurers; this interaction clearly influences 
7:157:11837:28:41:90:362:280:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the realized prices, however, in the empirical analyses.   
7:158:11896:41:28:126:463:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Consider two circular cities with 3 firms each, denoted H, R1, and R2 
7:159:11966:28:27:90:496:211:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:(representing the hospital of interest, rival 1, and rival 2).  In market 1, the rivals are 
7:160:12058:27:28:90:513:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:located in exactly the same spot and H is as far away as possible.  In market 2, the three 
7:161:12149:28:27:90:500:156:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:firms are distributed evenly around the circle.  These configurations are illustrated in

8:168:12330:42:28:90:524:542:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:I conjecture that R1 and R2 in market 1 are likelier to merge than R1 and R2 in market 2.  
8:169:12421:28:27:90:523:514:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:If true, and if firm location is exogenous, H is exogenously more likely to be exposed to a 
8:170:12513:27:28:90:517:487:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:rival merger.  Under these assumptions (explored in subsequent sections), the number of 
8:171:12601:28:27:89:499:459:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:co-located rival pairs a hospital has can serve as an instrument for rival merger.  The 
8:172:12689:27:42:89:287:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:outcome I consider in this study is price. 
8:173:12732:42:28:125:524:390:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:To illustrate the effect on H’s price of a merger between co-located rivals, I derive 
8:174:12818:28:27:89:505:362:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the pre and post-merger equilibrium prices in market 1.  For the sake of comparison, I 
8:175:12905:27:28:89:519:335:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:derive the same for market 2, assuming one of the R facilities closes post-merger and the 
8:176:12995:28:27:89:523:307:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:other remains in the same location.5   Without loss of generality, I set the marginal cost of 
8:177:13089:27:28:89:520:280:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:each firm equal to zero.  Appendix 1 gives the objective functions and equilibrium prices 
8:178:13179:28:27:89:517:252:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:for each firm-type (R and H) in each market (1 and 2) and scenario (pre and post-merger 
8:179:13267:27:42:89:336:225:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of R1 and R2).  Here I describe the general results. 
8:180:13320:42:28:125:478:183:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:So long as t is not so high that hospital H enjoys a local monopoly and is 
8:181:13395:28:58:89:510:155:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:unaffected by the actions of its rivals, a merger of co-located rivals will result in a very 
8:182:13488:58:7:234:237:97:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                 
8:183:13536:7:16:90:512:90:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:5 This seems the most plausible scenario given the high costs of construction and chronic overcapacity in 
8:184:13642:16:0:89:239:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:the industry during the merger wave.

9:189:13782:27:28:89:518:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:non-co-located rivals (as in market 2) is relatively smaller.  The reason is that R1 and R2 
9:190:13874:28:27:89:504:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:compete more intensely before the merger in market 1.  They are undifferentiated and 
9:191:13959:27:28:89:483:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:therefore set their prices equal to cost.   When they merge, market prices increase 
9:192:14043:28:28:89:510:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:dramatically.  In market 2, R1 and R2 are differentiated competitors pricing above cost 
9:193:14131:28:41:89:514:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:prior to the merger, so the merger has a smaller impact on optimal post-merger pricing.  
9:194:14220:41:28:125:521:529:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In Section 6, “Extensions and Robustness,” I return to these models to investigate 
9:195:14303:28:27:89:514:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the theoretical validity of the identifying assumption for the instrumental variables-rival 
9:196:14395:27:28:89:517:474:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:analysis: that during the merger wave, price growth in the two market types (conditional 
9:197:14484:28:28:89:517:446:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:on observables) would have been the same but for the increased frequency of mergers in 
9:198:14571:28:27:89:514:418:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:markets with co-located rivals.   (Note I need not assume that pre-merger price levels of 
9:199:14661:27:28:89:482:391:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the two market types are the same; indeed, the solutions presented in Appendix 1 
9:200:14742:28:27:89:499:363:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:illustrate they are not.)   Both the theoretical results and the empirical tests presented 
9:201:14833:27:28:89:502:336:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:below suggest colocation is not associated with faster price growth except through its 
9:202:14920:28:42:89:254:308:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:effect on the propensity to merge.

9:206:15162:7:16:90:514:90:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:6 The markets I consider are sufficiently small and contain a large enough number of providers to rule out 
9:207:15269:16:0:89:184:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:monopolistic behavior. 
10:208:15293:0:47:90:232:691:257:g_d0_f2:257:g_d0_f2:3       Background       
10:209:15318:47:28:90:513:644:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Until 1984, U.S. hospitals were generally reimbursed on a cost-plus basis by public and 
10:210:15406:28:28:90:518:616:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:private insurers.  In an effort to control escalating costs, the Medicare program instituted 
10:211:15499:28:27:90:505:588:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the Prospective Payment System (PPS) in 1984.  Under PPS, hospitals receive a fixed 
10:212:15583:27:28:90:505:561:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:payment for each Medicare patient in a given diagnosis-related group (DRG), making 
10:213:15666:28:27:90:518:533:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:hospitals the residual claimants of any profits or losses.  Payments were generous during 
10:214:15756:27:28:90:507:506:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the first few years of PPS, but by 1989 the majority of hospitals were earning negative 
10:215:15844:28:28:90:519:478:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:margins on Medicare admissions (Coulam and Gaumer 1991).  These financial pressures 
10:216:15928:28:27:90:486:450:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:were exacerbated by the rise of managed care in the private sector.  Managed care 
10:217:16010:27:28:90:502:423:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:penetration increased from under 30 percent of private insurance in 1988 to nearly 95 
10:218:16096:28:27:90:506:395:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:percent by 1999 (Kaiser Family Foundation 2004), bringing about a shift from fee-for-
10:219:16181:27:28:89:505:368:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:service to negotiated prices.  Thus, the motives to consolidate intensified substantially 
10:220:16271:28:27:89:484:340:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:during the 1990s, triggering an unprecedented wave of mergers, acquisitions, and 
10:221:16352:27:28:89:510:313:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:closures.  Between 1989 and 1996, there were 190 hospital mergers, as compared to 74 
10:222:16437:28:28:89:511:285:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:during 1983-1988 (Bazzoli et al, 2002).7  As a result, recent studies of hospital mergers 
10:223:16527:28:41:90:519:257:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:have focused on this time period (e.g. Bazzoli et al. 2002, Dranove and Lindrooth 2003). 
10:224:16616:41:28:126:475:216:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Hospital mergers have received a great deal of attention from healthcare 
10:225:16689:28:28:90:517:188:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:economists and antitrust enforcement agencies, in part because of the volume of patients 
10:226:16778:28:27:90:494:160:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and revenues involved.  In 2001, the 5,801 hospitals in the U.S. treated 1.68 million 
10:227:16864:27:36:90:499:133:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:outpatients and 658,000 inpatients each day, collecting $451 billion in revenues.  By

10:230:17103:16:0:89:498:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:were verified by the American Hospital Association for 1983-1988, and Bazzoli et al. for 1989-1996.

11:232:17291:27:28:89:495:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:localized nature of competition is also a source of concern for antitrust enforcement 
11:233:17377:28:27:89:505:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:agencies, as monopoly and oligopoly providers in a given geographic area can sustain 
11:234:17462:27:42:89:209:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:supracompetitive prices.

11:236:17571:28:27:89:508:556:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:hospitals will not exploit post-merger increases in market power.   This is an argument 
11:237:17659:27:28:89:502:529:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the courts have often cited in rejecting attempts to block proposed hospital mergers.9  
11:238:17747:28:27:89:492:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Since 1991, the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission have tried to 
11:239:17828:27:28:89:505:474:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:enjoin 7 hospital mergers and failed to prevail a single time.10  After a long hiatus, the 
11:240:17919:28:28:89:492:446:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:FTC changed course and began performing retrospective analyses of consummated 
11:241:17997:28:27:89:508:418:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:mergers to identify possible anticompetitive conduct. This initiative was dealt a severe 
11:242:18086:27:28:89:514:391:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:blow in 2007 when the full Commission failed to uphold an order to divest issued by an

12:265:20005:28:27:90:523:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the price effects of mergers in this sector.  Gaynor and Vogt (2000), Connor and Feldman 
12:266:20094:27:28:90:518:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:(1998), and Dranove and Lindrooth (2001) provide excellent summaries of the extensive 
12:267:20180:28:28:90:507:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:literature on hospital competition and mergers.  Most relevant for the present work are 
12:268:20268:28:27:90:513:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:longitudinal studies that compare pre and post-merger outcomes.  The majority of these 
12:269:20355:27:28:90:510:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:studies focus on the cost reductions achieved by merging institutions because hospitals 
12:270:20443:28:27:90:522:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:typically cite economies of scale and increased purchasing power as the main motives for 
12:271:20532:27:28:89:502:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:merger.  These studies have generally found very modest impacts of merger on costs, 
12:272:20616:28:28:89:521:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:with two recent exceptions, Alexander (1996) and Dranove and Lindrooth (2003).  Using 
12:273:20702:28:27:89:509:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:data on mergers of previously independent hospitals that operate under a single license 
12:274:20790:27:28:89:496:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:post-merger, Dranove and Lindrooth find post-merger cost decreases of 14 percent.  
12:275:20873:28:27:89:502:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:These are precisely the mergers I use for my analysis.  The combination of large post-
12:276:20959:27:28:89:523:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:merger price increases (implied by my results) and cost decreases suggests sizeable profit 
12:277:21050:28:42:89:226:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:gains for merging hospitals. 
12:278:21079:42:27:125:495:280:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The pre vs. post pricing studies are fewer in number and generally find price 
12:279:21157:27:28:89:506:253:144:Times:144:g_d0_f2:reductions following merger (e.g. Connor, Feldman, and Dowd 1998; Spang, Bazzoli, 
12:280:21239:28:27:89:502:225:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and Arnould 2001).  These estimates are plagued by the selection problems described 
12:281:21323:27:28:89:510:198:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:earlier, and biased downward by the use of nonmerging hospitals as control groups.   If 
12:282:21411:28:28:89:502:170:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:nonmerging rivals raise their prices in response to price increases by merging parties, 
12:283:21499:28:27:90:522:142:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:mergers could be associated with no relative price increase for merging parties in a given 
12:284:21590:27:0:89:469:115:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:market area but a large absolute price increase for the market area as a whole.  
13:285:21673:0:27:126:513:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Krishnan (2001) addresses the selection problem by comparing price growth for 
13:286:21751:27:28:90:523:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:diagnoses in which merging hospitals gained substantial market power (>20%) with price 
13:287:21838:28:27:90:513:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:growth for diagnoses in which they gained insignificant share (<5%).  Using data on 11 
13:288:21925:27:28:90:485:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:hospital mergers in Ohio in 1994 and 1995, Krishnan finds that merging hospitals 
13:289:22006:28:28:90:527:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:increased price 8.8 percent more in diagnoses where they gained substantial market share.  
13:290:22097:28:27:90:517:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:By design, this estimate is downward-biased: it eliminates hospital-wide price increases, 
13:291:22187:27:28:90:486:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:which are likely because many hospital features (e.g. location) are constant across 
13:292:22271:28:27:90:523:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:services.  In examining hospital responses to diagnosis-specific price changes imposed by 
13:293:22361:27:28:90:495:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Medicare, Dafny (2005) finds little evidence that hospitals compete in quality at the 
13:294:22447:28:28:90:528:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:diagnosis level; rather, the data are consistent with competition in overall hospital quality.  
13:295:22543:28:41:90:505:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:Times:These results suggest the downward bias in Krishnan’s estimates may be substantial.   
13:296:22628:41:28:126:513:391:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Two prior studies use rival analysis to estimate the impact of merger on average 
13:297:22709:28:27:90:489:363:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:market price.  Woolley (1989) is a classic “event study” that traces the effect of 29 
13:298:22795:27:28:90:499:336:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:merger-related events from 1969-85 on the stock prices of rival hospital chains.  The 
13:299:22881:28:28:90:505:308:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:study finds a positive relationship between pro-merger events and stock price, but has 
13:300:22968:28:27:90:506:280:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:been criticized on methodological grounds due to the events selected, the definition of 
13:301:23056:27:28:90:503:253:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:rival chains, and the fact that only a small fraction of hospitals are owned by publicly-
13:302:23145:28:27:90:523:225:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:traded firms (Vita and Schumann 1991).   Connor and Feldman (1998) compare price and 
13:303:23230:27:28:90:491:198:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:cost growth between 1986 and 1994 for non-merging hospitals with merging rivals 
13:304:23310:28:28:90:513:170:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:(hereafter NMW hospitals) and non-merging hospitals without merging rivals (hereafter 
13:305:23396:28:27:90:509:142:144:Times:144:g_d0_f2:NMWO hospitals).  They find no effect of rival mergers on price, with the exception of 
13:306:23483:27:28:90:515:115:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:mergers with an intermediate level of post-merger market share, where a small effect (3 
13:307:23571:28:0:90:521:87:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:percent over 8 years) is found. The lack of an effect for larger mergers is attributed to the 
14:308:23667:0:27:90:514:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:ability of the newly-formed hospitals to dominate the market and suppress rivals’ prices 
14:309:23756:27:42:90:321:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:through merger-related quality improvements.   
14:310:23803:42:27:126:513:639:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:My analysis also focuses on price changes of non-merging hospitals over a long 
14:311:23882:27:28:90:511:612:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:period of time (1988-1997) and across all states.  However, I take steps to examine and 
14:312:23970:28:28:90:501:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:address the selection problem that persists in rival analyses of mergers.  First, I apply 
14:313:24060:28:27:90:515:556:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:sample restrictions that substantially reduce the differences in observable characteristics 
14:314:24152:27:28:90:523:529:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of NMW and NMWO hospitals.  Second, I introduce rival colocation as an instrument for 
14:315:24238:28:27:90:493:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:rival merger.  These steps are discussed in turn in section 4 (Data) and 5 (Empirical 
14:316:24324:27:46:90:142:474:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Analysis).

14:318:24361:47:27:90:515:381:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Merger data constructed for Dranove and Lindrooth (2003) was generously provided by 
14:319:24445:27:28:90:510:354:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the authors.  Using the Annual Survey of Hospitals and the Annual Guide to Hospitals, 
14:320:24531:28:28:90:504:326:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:both produced by the American Hospital Association (AHA), Dranove and Lindrooth 
14:321:24611:28:27:89:496:298:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:identified 97 independent hospital mergers between 1989 and 1996.  They define an 
14:322:24693:27:28:89:500:271:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:independent merger as a combination of two hospitals that are not affiliated with any 
14:323:24779:28:27:89:510:243:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:hospital “system” into a single entity.  To qualify as a merger in this dataset, the newly-
14:324:24870:27:28:89:477:216:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:created hospital must report a single set of financial and utilization statistics and 
14:325:24956:28:28:89:516:188:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:surrender one of their facility licenses.  Figure 2 graphs the distribution of these mergers 
14:326:25049:28:40:89:503:160:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:over time.13  Because my instrument only predicts the incidence and not the timing of 
14:327:25135:40:7:234:237:120:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                 
14:328:25183:7:16:90:507:113:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:13 Although Dranove and Lindrooth’s data ends in 1996, merger figures reported by Cuellar and Gertler 
14:329:25285:16:0:90:508:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:(2003) for 1994-2000 reveal a steep dropoff in merger activity in 1997, and a steady decline thereafter.   
15:330:25394:0:27:90:495:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:merger (i.e. the instrument is not time-varying), I cannot exploit merger dates in my 
15:331:25480:27:28:90:498:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:analysis.  I therefore create an indicator variable for merger between 1989 and 1996, 
15:332:25566:28:27:90:513:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:using the sample of general, non-federal hospitals present in the 1988 AHA Survey and 
15:333:25652:27:28:90:524:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:located in metropolitan statistical areas or counties with more than 100,000 residents.14  (I

15:336:25923:27:28:89:514:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:ownership status, and number of beds.  Note that while independent mergers were more 
15:337:26008:28:27:89:509:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:common during the latter part of the study period, those involving co-located hospitals 
15:338:26096:27:28:89:496:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:(the subset that provides the variation exploited in the IV analysis), are fairly evenly 
15:339:26185:28:42:89:207:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:distributed over time.15

15:349:26901:8:16:90:519:170:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:14 Of the 5,373 general, non-federal hospitals located in the mainland U.S. in 1988, 466 are dropped due to 
15:350:27009:16:7:90:165:154:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:these restrictions.  
15:351:27030:7:16:90:521:147:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:15 There are 10 mergers involving colocated hospitals during the study period; 9 of these are cases in which 
15:352:27139:16:7:90:286:131:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:two colocated hospitals merged with each other. 
15:353:27187:7:16:90:509:124:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:16 More precisely, price = [(hospital inpatient routine service charges + hospital intensive care charges +

15:357:27594:11:0:90:495:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:charges), and reflects the common practice of discounts for private insurers.  The above formula was 
16:358:27697:0:27:90:484:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:revenue per discharge (Connor and Feldman 1998) or inpatient revenue per diem,

16:360:27867:28:27:90:510:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Medicare revenues and discharges because the federal government sets prices for these 
16:361:27953:27:28:90:523:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:patients.  However, I use each hospital’s case-mix index (CMI) for Medicare patients as a 
16:362:28043:28:28:90:506:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:proxy for the non-Medicare CMI, which is not reported.  Medicare CMIs are obtained 
16:363:28126:28:27:90:517:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:from the Prospective Payment Impact Files produced annually by CMS.18  The variables 
16:364:28211:27:28:90:516:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:needed to calculate price are available for FY1985-2000, which spans the period 3 years

16:368:28549:28:27:90:498:418:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:variables are the change in log price for a given hospital during 1985-1988 (the “pre-
16:369:28635:27:28:90:505:391:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:period”), 1988-1997 (the “treatment period”), and 1997-2000 (the “post period”).  All 
16:370:28721:28:27:90:496:363:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:dependent variables are censored at the 5th and 95th percentiles.  I also construct two 
16:371:28809:27:28:90:516:336:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:indicators of financial distress using the 1988 HCRIS data: the share of patients covered 
16:372:28899:28:28:90:517:308:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:by Medicaid, and the aggregate debt: asset ratio.  Prior research suggests that financially-
16:373:28991:28:33:90:488:280:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:distressed hospitals are more likely to be party to a merger or acquisition.  I obtain

16:375:29222:12:12:90:521:235:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:constructed with the guidance of HCRIS experts at CMS.  Records with discount factors outside of [0,1] or 
16:376:29328:12:7:90:363:223:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:negative values for any measure in the price formula are excluded.   
16:377:29397:7:16:90:500:216:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:17 Keeler et al. use a two-step process to adjust for each hospital’s case-mix.  First, they use California 
16:378:29505:16:11:90:512:200:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:discharge data for 10 common diagnoses to run 10 separate regressions of net inpatient revenue per diem 
16:379:29609:11:12:90:503:189:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:on patient characteristics and hospital dummies.  Next, they use the 10 coefficients for each hospital to 
16:380:29715:12:7:90:259:177:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:construct a weighted average price index. 
16:381:29757:7:16:90:507:170:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:18 CMS uses the distribution of a hospital’s Medicare admissions across roughly 500 Diagnosis-Related 
16:382:29859:16:11:90:507:154:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Groups, or DRGs, to construct that hospital’s annual CMI.  Each DRG is associated with a weight.  The 
16:383:29961:11:12:90:492:143:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:CMI is the admissions-weighted average DRG weight for the hospital.  The weights were originally 
16:384:30058:12:11:90:506:131:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:constructed (in 1984) so that the average CMI across all hospitals would equal 1; this average has since 
16:385:30163:11:7:90:143:120:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:crept higher. 
16:386:30177:7:16:90:511:113:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:20 Between 1985 and 2000, the 5th percentile of the annual price distribution ranges from $1374 to $1664 
16:387:30282:16:0:90:323:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:(in $2000), and the 95th percentile from $6256 to $8334.   
17:388:30342:0:27:90:509:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:market-level control variables such as county per-capita income in 1990 from the Area

17:393:30693:28:27:89:514:556:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:which contain 6 decimal places and are accurate up to the street segment, I calculate the 
17:394:30783:27:28:89:492:529:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:straight-line distance between hospitals (“as the crow flies”).  After identifying 213 
17:395:30870:28:27:89:474:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:hospitals located within 0.3 miles of another, I performed a secondary check by 
17:396:30950:27:28:89:519:474:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:examining individual maps of these pairs from Mapquest.com.  Restricting the definition 
17:397:31038:28:28:89:497:446:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to exclude hospitals located more than 5 blocks apart reduces the final number of co-
17:398:31123:28:27:89:475:418:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:located hospitals to 191.  In section 6, I illustrate the robustness of the results to 
17:399:31210:27:42:89:262:391:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:alternative colocation definitions.22

17:403:31506:28:27:89:505:266:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:sample, 178 (4 percent) were party to an independent merger between 1989 and 1996, 
17:404:31589:27:28:89:478:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and 163 (3.6 percent) were co-located with at least one hospital.23  18 of the 163 
17:405:31672:28:45:90:502:211:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:subsequently merged, yielding a merger rate of 11 percent in the co-located subset.24

17:407:31807:7:12:90:478:159:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:21 These estimates were constructed using data from the Group Health Association of America.   
17:408:31902:12:16:90:522:147:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:22 For the purposes of identifying co-located hospitals and counting rivals, all general, non-federal hospitals 
17:409:32014:16:11:90:522:131:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:with valid addresses in the non-territorial U.S. are included; sample restrictions are applied after this step is 
17:410:32128:11:7:90:132:120:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:complete. 
17:411:32138:7:16:90:517:113:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:23 A total of 194 hospitals were involved in the 97 independent mergers between 1989 and 1996.  Of these 
17:412:32243:16:12:90:515:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:hospitals, 192 are included in the 1988 AHA data, which is the starting point for the analysis.  All 192 are 
17:413:32352:12:11:90:514:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:present when rival merger counts and colocation variables are constructed.  However, the “All Hospitals” 
17:414:32457:11:0:90:503:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:sample excludes 13 of the 192 due to missing covariates, and 1 because it is located in a rural area.  As 
18:415:32565:0:27:126:509:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The “Rivals Sample” (Column 2) is limited to non-merging hospitals in the All 
18:416:32643:27:28:90:505:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Hospitals sample that have two or more rivals within 7 miles in 1988, and nonmissing 
18:417:32728:28:27:90:512:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:price data during the pre-period and the treatment period.  The rationale for the 2+ rival 
18:418:32819:27:28:90:521:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:requirement is straightforward: if a nonmerging hospital has fewer than 2 rivals, it cannot 
18:419:32911:28:28:90:510:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:experience a rival merger and thus should not be included in the sample.  The rationale 
18:420:32999:28:27:90:513:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:for the 7-mile cutoff is that the merger of adjacent hospitals can reasonably be expected 
18:421:33089:27:28:90:520:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to affect the prices of rivals located within fairly tight geographic bounds.  In Section 6, I 
18:422:33184:28:27:90:518:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:examine the sensitivity of the results to alternative market definitions.  Given the sample 
18:423:33276:27:28:90:504:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:restrictions, hospitals in the Rivals Sample are generally located in densely-populated 
18:424:33364:28:28:90:473:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:urban areas. As compared to the All Hospitals sample, they are less likely to be 
18:425:33445:28:27:90:509:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:government-owned (10 vs. 26 percent), and more likely to offer teaching programs (16 
18:426:33530:27:42:90:164:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:vs. 6 percent).  
18:427:33547:42:27:126:511:363:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The Rivals Sample can be subdivided into hospitals with merging rivals (NMW 
18:428:33623:27:28:90:506:336:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:hospitals, N=118, column 3), and hospitals without merging rivals (NMWO hospitals,

18:430:33790:28:27:90:494:280:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:although there are some statistically significant differences.  NMW hospitals have a 
18:431:33875:27:28:90:519:253:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:greater share of Medicaid patients, a larger number of rivals, and they operate in markets 
18:432:33966:28:27:90:511:225:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:with slightly higher HMO penetration rates.  They are also more likely to be very small 
18:433:34054:27:28:90:502:198:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:(<100 beds).  Price growth in the three years prior to the merger wave is significantly

18:435:34225:28:22:90:503:142:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:NMWO hospitals are inappropriate controls for NMW hospitals; that is, treating rival 
18:436:34310:22:12:521:524:120:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                                                                                                                 
18:437:34454:12:11:90:497:108:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:noted in the text, rural hospitals are excluded because Dranove and Lindrooth did not seek to identify 
18:438:34557:11:7:90:505:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:mergers in rural areas.  The sole exception is due to a merger between a non-rural and a rural hospital.   
18:439:34664:7:16:90:496:90:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:24 All 10 mergers involving colocated hospitals are represented among these 18 hospitals (2 of the 20 
18:440:34766:16:0:90:454:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:hospitals involved in the mergers are missing for reasons given in the preceding footnote). 
19:441:34860:0:27:90:526:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:mergers as exogenous will produce underestimates of the impact of rival merger on price.  
19:442:34950:27:46:90:426:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:This conjecture is corroborated in the OLS results presented below.    
19:443:35021:46:47:90:253:635:257:g_d0_f2:257:g_d0_f2:5  Empirical Analysis 
19:444:35043:47:27:90:523:588:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:To estimate the price effects of merger, I focus on the prices charged by rivals of merging 
19:445:35135:27:28:90:522:561:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:hospitals.  If merging hospitals raise price, and prices are strategic complements, rivals of 
19:446:35229:28:27:90:479:533:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:these hospitals should be able to raise price as well.  This approach allows me to 
19:447:35312:27:28:90:518:506:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:eliminate merging hospitals from the primary analysis, which is ideal as they differ from 
19:448:35402:28:28:90:501:478:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:nonmerging hospitals in unobservable ways that are likely to be correlated with price 
19:449:35488:28:27:89:514:450:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:changes.  However, selection issues persist even in the sample of nonmerging hospitals, 
19:450:35576:27:28:89:490:423:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:as nonmerging hospitals in markets with mergers (NMW hospitals) are likely to be 
19:451:35657:28:27:89:503:395:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:different in relevant, unobserved ways from nonmerging hospitals in markets without 
19:452:35741:27:28:89:496:368:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:mergers (NMWO hospitals).  Thus, I introduce an instrument for exposure to a rival 
19:453:35824:28:27:89:474:340:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:merger, namely the number of co-located rival hospital pairs.  If this measure is 
19:454:35906:27:28:89:515:313:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:correlated with the propensity for rivals to merge, and otherwise uncorrelated with price 
19:455:35996:28:28:89:493:285:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:growth of area hospitals, it is a valid instrument for rival merger and can be used to 
19:456:36083:28:41:89:390:257:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:produce unbiased estimates of the price effect of rival merger. 
19:457:36147:41:28:125:524:216:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:I proceed in two steps.  First, I validate the conjecture that co-located hospitals are 
19:458:36235:28:28:89:522:188:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:more likely to merge.  For this analysis, I use the All Hospitals sample.  Second, I use the 
19:459:36328:28:0:89:510:160:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Rivals Sample to obtain an instrumental variables estimate of the effect of rival merger 
20:460:36419:0:27:90:513:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:on price.25  I compare this estimate with the estimate from an OLS regression that takes 
20:461:36508:27:42:90:245:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:rival merger to be exogenous.    
20:462:36541:42:27:90:331:639:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:5.1 Co-location and the Probability of Merger 
20:463:36587:27:28:90:509:612:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Using the raw data from the All Hospitals sample, co-location performs quite well as a 
20:464:36674:28:28:89:520:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:predictor of merger: the merger rate for co-located hospitals is 11.0 percent, as compared 
20:465:36765:28:27:89:490:556:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to 3.7 percent for non-co-located hospitals.   Table 2 presents the results of a linear 
20:466:36853:27:28:89:511:529:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:probability model that includes all of the hospital characteristics reported in Table 1, as 
20:467:36945:28:27:89:516:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:well as market characteristics such as the county-level HMO penetration rate, per-capita 
20:468:37034:27:28:89:510:474:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:income, and total population.  To control for the possibility that state regulatory boards 
20:469:37125:28:28:89:443:446:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:affect the merger rate, results are also presented with state fixed effects.   
20:470:37204:28:27:125:522:418:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The relationship between the probability of merger and co-location is robust to all 
20:471:37288:27:28:89:516:391:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of the controls: co-location is associated with an increase of 6-7 percentage points in the 
20:472:37380:28:27:89:499:363:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:probability of merger.  As a falsification exercise, I reestimate these models using an 
20:473:37468:27:28:89:507:336:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:indicator for system merger as the dependent variable.  System mergers are defined by 
20:474:37553:28:28:89:519:308:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Dranove and Lindrooth as one-to-one consolidations of hospitals that did not surrender a 
20:475:37642:28:27:89:480:280:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:facility license and report joint data following the consolidation.  The coefficient 
20:476:37727:27:28:89:515:253:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:estimates from these regressions are small and statistically insignificant.26  As expected, 
20:477:37819:28:27:90:493:225:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:co-location is a good predictor of fully-integrated mergers but not of all merger and 
20:478:37905:27:28:90:507:198:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:acquisition-related activity.  Hence, the point estimates pertain only to these particular 
20:479:37996:28:50:90:176:170:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:types of mergers. 
20:480:38014:50:7:234:237:120:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                 
20:481:38062:7:16:90:486:113:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:25 An alternative approach would be to use own co-location as an instrument for own merger.  The 
20:482:38159:16:12:90:521:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:advantage of rival analysis is that it potentially exploits each merger several times (when multiple hospitals 
20:483:38270:12:7:90:388:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:are exposed to the same merger), increasing the sample size substantially. 
20:484:38345:7:0:90:384:78:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:26 The point estimates are -.020 (.011) with or without state fixed effects. 
21:485:38424:0:27:126:505:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Given the strong relationship between co-location and merger, the relationship 
21:486:38503:27:28:90:506:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:between rival co-location and rival merger in the rivals sample should also be strong.  
21:487:38591:28:27:90:522:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Table 2, column 3 reports the results of a linear regression of the number of rival mergers 
21:488:38682:27:28:90:481:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:on the number of co-located rival pairs, again controlling for hospital and market 
21:489:38765:28:28:90:490:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:characteristics.  Column 4 adds state fixed effects.  These specifications reveal that 
21:490:38852:28:27:90:512:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:having one additional pair of co-located rivals is associated with an increase of roughly 
21:491:38942:27:28:90:498:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:0.11 in the number of rival mergers, as compared to a mean of 0.16.  This regression 
21:492:39027:28:41:90:424:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:constitutes the first stage in the two-stage least squares rival analysis. 
21:493:39102:41:28:126:499:474:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:For rival co-location to be a good instrument for rival merger, it must also be 
21:494:39182:28:28:90:519:446:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:uncorrelated with unobserved factors related to price growth.27  To examine whether this 
21:495:39271:28:27:89:509:418:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:condition is satisfied, I regress price growth during the pre-period on the number of co-
21:496:39360:27:28:89:520:391:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:located rival pairs and the controls listed above.28  The results, reported in columns 1 and 
21:497:39453:28:27:90:500:363:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:2 of Table 3, reveal a negative and statistically insignificant relationship between the 
21:498:39542:27:28:90:514:336:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:number of co-located rival pairs and price growth.  Thus, there is no empirical evidence 
21:499:39631:28:28:90:506:308:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:suggesting that price growth before the merger wave was greater for hospitals with co-
21:500:39717:28:91:90:160:280:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:located rivals. 
21:501:39733:91:7:234:237:189:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                 
21:502:39781:7:16:90:501:182:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:27 This assumption would be violated if, for example, prior to1988 new hospitals were likelier to enter 
21:503:39885:16:12:90:521:166:100:Times:100:g_d0_f2:adjacent to existing hospitals in areas where prices were expected to increase during 1988-96.  In that case, 
21:504:39995:12:11:90:487:154:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:price growth for hospitals with colocated rivals would be faster for reasons unrelated to the greater 
21:505:40097:11:12:90:513:143:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:propensity for these rivals to merge  As there has been very little entry in the acute-care hospital industry 
21:506:40207:12:11:90:510:131:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:since the Hospital Survey and Construction Act of 1946 (known as Hill-Burton), this seems a reasonable 
21:507:40310:11:12:90:512:120:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:assumption.  Exit was not uncommon, however less than one percent of the hospitals in the study sample 
21:508:40413:12:11:90:520:108:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:have rivals who exited during the study period.  All results are robust to including a control for the number 
21:509:40523:11:7:90:158:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:of exiting rivals. 
21:510:40542:7:16:90:524:90:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:28 Regressions for pre-period price growth use hospital covariates from 1985.  Regressions for the treatment 
21:511:40651:16:0:90:471:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:period use covariates from 1988, and regressions for the post-period use covariates from 1997. 
22:512:40748:0:41:90:323:694:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:5.2 The Impact of Merger on Rivals’ Prices  
22:513:40792:41:28:90:477:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The reduced form of the rival analysis is a regression of price growth during the 
22:514:40874:28:27:90:513:625:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:treatment period on the number of co-located rival pairs and all of the control variables. 
22:515:40965:27:28:90:522:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Price growth is measured as the change in logged price between 1988, the year before the 
22:516:41054:28:27:90:506:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:first merger in the dataset, and 1997, the year following the last merger in the dataset.  
22:517:41145:27:28:90:480:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Results from the reduced form are reported in columns 3 and 4 of Table 3.  Each 
22:518:41225:28:28:90:521:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:additional pair of co-located rivals is associated with a statistically-significant increase of 
22:519:41321:28:27:90:514:487:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:0.045 in price growth, as compared to a mean of 0.010 during this period.  The estimate 
22:520:41409:27:28:90:507:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:falls slightly to 0.034 and remains statistically significant upon inclusion of state fixed 
22:521:41501:28:28:90:522:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:effects.  Columns 5 and 6 report results using price growth in the post period, 1997-2000, 
22:522:41592:28:27:90:505:404:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:as the dependent variable.  As in the pre-period, there is no relationship between price 
22:523:41681:27:42:90:303:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:growth and the number of co-located rivals. 
22:524:41725:42:27:126:506:335:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Table 4 presents the IV estimate of the effect of a rival’s merger between 1989 
22:525:41805:27:28:90:521:308:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and 1996 on price growth between 1988 and 1997.  The point estimate is simply the ratio 
22:526:41893:28:27:90:501:280:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of the reduced-form and first-stage coefficient estimates, 0.045/0.119 ≈ 0.376, with a 
22:527:41980:27:28:90:489:253:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:standard error of 0.132.29  This figure translates into a cumulative price increase of 
22:528:42067:28:28:90:517:225:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:approximately 46 percent (35 percent using the model with state fixed effects).30  This is 
22:529:42158:28:27:89:522:197:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:equivalent to moving a hospital from the 25th to the 65th percentile of price growth during 
22:530:42250:27:61:89:495:170:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:this period, or the 75th to the 95th percentile.  (Real price growth in the rivals sample

22:533:42500:16:7:90:354:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:single endogenous regressor and the model is exactly identified.

23:538:42873:27:28:89:511:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:or short-term boost in the pace of price growth rather than a transition to a permanently

23:540:42991:42:27:125:517:556:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Table 4 also reports OLS estimates of the effect of rival merger on price growth.  
23:541:43074:27:28:89:491:529:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:As in Connor and Feldman (1998), I too find no statistically significant impact of a 
23:542:43159:28:27:89:515:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:rival’s merger on price using OLS.  Hausman specification tests easily reject equality of 
23:543:43249:27:46:89:406:474:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the two estimates for models with and without state fixed effects.

23:546:43415:41:28:126:525:340:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The identification strategy assumes that, controlling for observable characteristics, 
23:547:43501:28:27:89:490:312:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:any systematic difference in the price growth exhibited by nonmerging hospitals in 
23:548:43584:27:28:89:511:285:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:markets with co-located rivals and nonmerging hospitals in markets without co-located 
23:549:43670:28:28:89:488:257:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:rivals is due to the greater frequency of rival mergers to which the former group is 
23:550:43755:28:27:89:517:229:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:exposed.  The finding that price growth is similar for both groups prior to the start of the 
23:551:43848:27:24:89:503:202:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:merger wave provides some support for this assumption; however, the study period is 
23:552:43932:24:8:234:237:178:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                 
23:553:43980:8:16:90:512:170:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:31These estimates are similar in magnitude to the price increases implemented by Evanston Northwestern 
23:554:44083:16:11:90:508:154:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Healthcare (ENH) following its 1999 acquisition of nearby (but not co-located) Highland Park Hospital. 
23:555:44186:11:12:90:514:143:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:ENH did not dispute the price increases alleged in the FTC complaint.  These include increases of 52% at 
23:556:44291:12:11:90:515:131:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:the Evanston facility for UnitedHealthcare’s HMO, 190% for UnitedHealthcare’s PPO, 60% for Humana, 
23:557:44390:11:12:90:499:120:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:40% for Private Healthcare Systems, and 15-20% for Aetna and Cigna’s HMOs (Modern Healthcare, 
23:558:44484:12:11:90:512:108:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:1/2/2006).  Note these figures represent increases by merging hospitals rather than their rivals.  Increases 
23:559:44593:11:12:90:518:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:by merging hospitals may be higher or lower than increases by rivals.  As demonstrated by Gal-Or (1999), 
23:560:44698:12:11:90:523:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Capps, Dranove, and Satterthwaite (2005), and Ho (2007), the average negotiated post-merger price for any 
23:561:44804:11:0:90:519:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:given hospital depends on its relative bargaining power vis-a-vis insurers in the post-merger marketplace.   
24:562:44915:0:27:90:516:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:long and it is possible that omitted factors affect the evolution of prices in these markets 
24:563:45008:27:42:90:284:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:differently during this particular period. 
24:564:45051:42:27:126:493:639:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The most important such factor is the strength of managed care.  Although I 
24:565:45127:27:28:89:503:612:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:control for the percent of the population enrolled in managed care in each market, the 
24:566:45214:28:28:89:507:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:negotiating power of these organizations varies widely.  As a result, it is helpful to use 
24:567:45305:28:27:89:494:556:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the model from Section 2 to generate predictions regarding how changes in demand 
24:568:45386:27:28:89:512:529:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:would affect prices in the two market types.  In the context of this model, the growth of 
24:569:45476:28:27:89:499:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:managed care is similar to a reduction in v, buyers’ maximum willingness-to-pay for 
24:570:45560:27:28:89:520:474:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:hospital services.  The impact of a decline in v on equilibrium price (i.e. dP*/dv) depends 
24:571:45652:28:28:89:515:446:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:on the value of the transport cost t, but for the relevant range of t, price is as sensitive or 
24:572:45748:28:27:89:501:418:144:Times:144:g_d0_f2:more sensitive to v markets with co-located rivals.  The intuition for this result is that 
24:573:45839:27:28:89:499:391:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:prices in more competitive markets are more sensitive to changes in costs or demand 
24:574:45923:28:27:89:504:363:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:because firms are less able to absorb such shocks by cutting into their profit margins.  
24:575:46012:27:28:89:515:336:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Thus, if anything we might expect lower price growth in markets with co-located rivals, 
24:576:46100:28:28:89:507:308:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:strengthening the argument that the higher observed growth is due not to the structural 
24:577:46187:28:27:89:511:280:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:propensity for hospitals in such markets to raise prices particularly rapidly but rather to 
24:578:46279:27:42:89:373:253:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the increased frequency of mergers induced by colocation. 
24:579:46337:42:27:125:515:211:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Another empirical test of the identifying assumption is to see whether the results 
24:580:46420:27:28:89:482:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:are robust to the exclusion of all control variables.  Assuming that the correlation 
24:581:46505:28:28:89:506:156:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:between observable factors and the instrument is similar to that between unobservable 
24:582:46591:28:0:89:486:128:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:factors and the instrument, a robust result suggests the estimates are not biased by 
25:583:46678:0:27:90:487:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:unobserved factors.  Indeed, the estimated merger effect, presented in column 2 of 
25:584:46761:27:42:90:438:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Appendix Table 1, is virtually unchanged when all controls are omitted.

25:586:46859:41:28:126:497:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Table 5 explores the sensitivity of the results to alternative definitions for co-
25:587:46941:28:27:89:512:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:location and changes in market boundaries.  IV estimates without state fixed effects are 
25:588:47030:27:28:90:520:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:reported for all combinations of these definitions and boundaries.32  The results are fairly 
25:589:47123:28:28:90:496:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:insensitive to the co-location definition, with statistically-significant point estimates 
25:590:47213:28:27:90:524:487:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:ranging between 0.326 and 0.511.  The Mapquest corrections eliminate a small amount of 
25:591:47300:27:28:90:513:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:noise in the co-location measure, but this noise does not appear to be systematic.  In the 
25:592:47391:28:28:90:491:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:(unreported) first-stage regression using 0.3 miles as the co-location definition (i.e. 
25:593:47479:28:27:90:515:404:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:eliminating the 5-block Mapquest restriction), the coefficient on co-located rival pairs is 
25:594:47571:27:28:90:524:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:0.117 (.017), as compared to 0.119 (.018) for the Mapquest-corrected version (reported in 
25:595:47661:28:41:90:142:349:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Table 2).   
25:596:47673:41:28:126:478:308:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The alternative definitions for co-location can also be used to perform an 
25:597:47748:28:27:90:498:280:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:overidentification test of the co-location instrument.  The model can be estimated by 
25:598:47834:27:28:90:518:253:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:2SLS using two instruments for rival merger: the number of rival pairs less than .2 miles 
25:599:47924:28:28:90:506:225:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:apart, and the number of rival pairs .2 to .3 miles apart.  Regressing the residuals from 
25:600:48014:28:27:90:518:197:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:this model on all instruments (which includes the exogenous regressors) and multiplying 
25:601:48102:27:28:90:511:170:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the resulting R-squared by N produces a test statistic that is distributed as a chi-squared 
25:602:48194:28:56:90:480:142:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:statistic with one degree of freedom (Hausman 1983).  The test statistic of .36 (p-

26:605:48405:0:27:90:522:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:value=.55) supports the null hypothesis of exogeneity of the instruments.  I obtain similar 
26:606:48497:27:42:90:349:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:results using 0-.2 and .2-.4 as the co-location ranges.  
26:607:48554:42:27:126:487:639:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:To expand the instrument set, I also considered a variant of the co-location 
26:608:48631:27:28:90:503:612:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:instrument: the number of co-located rival pairs of the same ownership type (i.e. both 
26:609:48718:28:28:90:492:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:NFP hospitals, both FP hospitals, and both government hospitals).  Ceteris paribus, 
26:610:48802:28:27:90:489:556:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:hospitals of the same ownership type may be more likely to merge due to common 
26:611:48881:27:28:90:487:529:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:objectives and financial arrangements.  Including these additional instruments had 
26:612:48964:28:27:90:508:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:virtually no effect on the results as there were too few non-zero values.  Other variants

26:614:49144:28:28:90:515:446:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:overlap of particular service offerings, are not time-invariant and may not be exogenous 
26:615:49233:28:41:90:290:418:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to contemporaneous market conditions.33 
26:616:49272:41:28:125:523:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In the main analysis, the market for a given hospital is defined to include all rivals 
26:617:49359:28:27:89:486:349:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:within 7 miles.  The number of rival mergers and co-located rival pairs within this 
26:618:49443:27:28:89:508:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:circular boundary are then counted.  Theoretically, the effect of rival merger should be 
26:619:49532:28:28:89:510:294:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:stronger for closer rivals, and weaker for rivals located further away.  Indeed, the point 
26:620:49623:28:27:89:524:266:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:estimates more than double when the market radius is set at 5 miles, while the price effect 
26:621:49715:27:42:89:498:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:is small and statistically insignificant when all rivals within 10 miles are included.34  
26:622:49805:42:27:125:522:197:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Appendix 2 presents results from a series of alternative specifications, including a 
26:623:49890:27:28:89:520:170:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:model with a negative binomial regression in the first stage, and a model with changes in 
26:624:49980:28:22:89:518:142:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:price levels (rather than logs) as the dependent variable.  The uniformity of the estimates

26:626:50120:7:16:90:520:113:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:33 A small number of hospitals did undergo ownership conversions during the study period, but for the vast 
26:627:50227:16:7:90:333:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:majority ownership status is time-invariant (as is location).   
26:628:50291:7:16:90:515:90:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:34 Note that reducing the market size also reduces the number of observations, as there are fewer hospitals 
26:629:50399:16:0:90:254:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:with 2+ rivals within a shorter distance.  
27:630:50444:0:27:90:464:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:across the various specifications confirms the initial results: mergers between 
27:631:50524:27:46:90:507:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:independent, close rivals lead to dramatic increases in market prices for inpatient care.

27:633:50640:47:27:90:479:588:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Observational studies of merger effects are plagued by severe selection bias.  To 
27:634:50722:27:28:90:524:561:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:overcome this bias, I propose a combination of rival analysis with instrumental variables.  
27:635:50814:28:27:90:481:533:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:This approach uses the responses of rivals to gauge the anticompetitive effects of 
27:636:50897:27:28:90:497:506:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:mergers, instrumenting for whether a rival is exposed to a merger in the first place.   
27:637:50985:28:28:90:485:478:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Using data on mergers in the hospital industry between 1989 and 1996, I find that 
27:638:51067:28:27:90:515:450:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:hospitals increase price substantially following the merger of rivals within 7 miles.  The 
27:639:51158:27:28:90:516:423:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:point estimate of approximately 40 percent is consistent with predictions from structural

27:642:51353:28:28:90:512:326:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:generate enormous quality improvements.  Only one prior study has explored the effect 
27:643:51439:28:27:90:490:298:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of hospital mergers on quality, and this study finds evidence of slight reductions in 
27:644:51525:27:28:90:508:271:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:quality (Hamilton and Ho 2000).  On the other hand, producer welfare appears to have 
27:645:51610:28:27:89:518:243:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:increased substantially, both as a result of price gains (paired with inelastic demand) and 
27:646:51702:27:28:89:484:216:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:potentially large cost reductions (Dranove and Lindrooth 2003).  Caution must be 
27:647:51783:28:56:89:522:188:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:exercised, however, when extrapolating these conclusions to hospital mergers in general.  
27:648:51873:56:8:234:237:132:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                 
27:649:51921:8:16:90:513:124:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:35 Using hospital discharge data from California, Capps et al. (2003) and Gaynor and Vogt (2003) predict 
27:650:52026:16:11:90:493:108:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:price increases of 10 to 58 percent for hypothetical mergers in markets with few competitors.  These 
27:651:52127:11:12:90:495:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:estimates are likely to be downward-biased, as the models assume that rivals do not react to the price 
27:652:52230:12:11:90:517:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:increases of the merged institution. If prices are strategic complements, the newly-merged entity will raise 
27:653:52339:11:0:90:326:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:prices more because it anticipates the reaction of its rivals. 
28:654:52404:0:27:90:516:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The estimates I obtain rely on responses to mergers of co-located hospitals, which enjoy 
28:655:52493:27:42:89:372:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:especially strong post-merger increases in market power.   
28:656:52552:42:27:125:518:639:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:There are four key implications of the findings.  First, comparing price growth of 
28:657:52635:27:28:89:492:612:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:merging firms with price growth of non-merging rivals is likely to yield substantial 
28:658:52720:28:28:90:494:584:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:underestimates of merger effects in differentiated oligopoly settings.  Second, when 
28:659:52805:28:27:90:497:556:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:selection bias is addressed, there is conclusive evidence that mergers of independent 
28:660:52891:27:28:90:501:529:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:hospitals can lead to large increases in area prices, a result that has not emerged from 
28:661:52980:28:27:89:509:501:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:prior longitudinal studies.  Third, the magnitudes of these increases are consistent with 
28:662:53070:27:28:90:501:474:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:predictions generated from structural models of similar settings (Capps, Dranove and 
28:663:53155:28:28:90:518:446:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Satterthwaite (2003) and Gaynor and Vogt (2003)).  Although these models have mainly 
28:664:53240:28:27:90:500:418:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:been used to predict price increases of merging firms themselves, the large estimated 
28:665:53326:27:28:90:507:391:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:effects (in concentrated markets) suggest rivals of these firms could sustain significant 
28:666:53416:28:27:90:513:363:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:price increases.  Therefore, the results in this paper validate the use of careful structural 
28:667:53510:27:28:90:509:336:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:modeling to estimate the impact of proposed mergers.  Fourth, the analysis reveals that 
28:668:53598:28:28:90:497:308:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:most geographic definitions of hospital markets are too large for urban areas.  Fixed-
28:669:53684:28:27:90:517:280:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:radius definitions of 5 to 7 miles appear to be more appropriate than the commonly-used 
28:670:53772:27:42:90:352:253:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:15 to 20 miles (and by extension, counties or MSAs).  
28:671:53826:42:27:126:502:211:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The methodology in this study could be applied to a number of industries that 
28:672:53904:27:28:90:499:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:have also experienced merger waves, ranging from independent video stores to retail 
28:673:53988:28:28:90:523:156:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:banks.  Various permutations of distance between firms or outlets – whether in product or 
28:674:54078:28:27:90:474:128:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:physical space – could serve as instruments for merger, assuming they meet the 
28:675:54157:27:0:90:481:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:requirement of exogeneity.  More generally, research that carefully addresses the 
29:676:54241:0:27:90:507:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:endogeneity of merger events or models the appropriate counterfactual outcome in the 
29:677:54326:27:28:90:515:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:absence of merger is needed in order to achieve a greater understanding of the effects of 
29:678:54416:28:0:90:262:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:consolidations in various settings.

42:1052:69532:47:28:90:527:644:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The following table presents the coefficients of interest from several specification checks.  
42:1053:69626:28:28:90:501:616:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:All models are based on the main specification without state fixed effects.  Column 1 
42:1054:69712:28:27:90:516:588:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:repeats the main results as a reference point.  Column 2 demonstrates that the results are 
42:1055:69803:27:28:90:488:561:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:similar when all hospital and market controls are excluded.  Column 3 reveals that 
42:1056:69886:28:27:90:486:533:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:censoring of the dependent variable has only a slight effect on the point estimates. 
42:1057:69971:27:28:90:500:506:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Column 4 adds controls for the number of rivals within a hospital’s market.  Because 
42:1058:70056:28:28:90:506:478:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:hospitals with more rivals are more likely to have co-located rivals as well as merging 
42:1059:70144:28:27:90:520:450:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:rivals, it is possible that the instrument is also capturing the effect of having more rivals.  
42:1060:70240:27:28:89:497:423:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Theoretically, this could bias the estimate downward, as it would cause a larger first-
42:1061:70327:28:27:89:512:395:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:stage coefficient and a smaller reduced-form coefficient.  Column 4 includes individual 
42:1062:70415:27:28:89:504:368:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:dummies for markets with 2,3,...9,10-15, and 15+ rivals.  The result indicates a small 
42:1063:70502:28:27:89:490:340:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:downward bias, if any.  Column 5 excludes hospitals that are co-located with other 
42:1064:70585:27:28:89:508:313:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:hospitals from the estimation sample (note the number of co-located rival pairs always 
42:1065:70672:28:28:89:506:285:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:excludes the pair to which a hospital belongs, if any).  Column 6 uses the fitted values 
42:1066:70761:28:27:89:514:257:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:from a negative binomial first-stage regression as the instrument for the number of rival

42:1068:70936:28:27:89:517:202:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:place of the change in log prices as the dependent variable.  The point estimate of $1566

42:1072:71295:27:0:89:523:92:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:variable).  Yet another specification check (excluded here for lack of space) confirms that
