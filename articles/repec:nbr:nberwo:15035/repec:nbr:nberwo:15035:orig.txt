2:25:1052:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:In this paper, we present what is to our knowledge the first theoretical economic analysis of CO2-
2:26:1150:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:enhanced oil recovery (EOR). This technique, which has been used successfully in a number of oil
2:27:1246:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:plays (notably in West Texas, Wyoming, and Saskatchewan), entails injection of CO2 into mature
2:28:1340:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:oil fields in a manner that reduces the oil's viscosity, thereby enhancing the rate of extraction. As part
2:29:1446:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:of this process, significant quantities of CO2 remain sequestered in the reservoir. If CO2 emissions
2:30:1546:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:are regulated, oil producers using EOR should therefore be able to earn sequestration credits in addition
2:31:1651:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:to oil revenues. We develop a theoretical framework that analyzes the dynamic co-optimization of
2:32:1747:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:oil extraction and CO2 sequestration, through the producer's choice at each point in time of an optimal
2:33:1850:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:CO2 fraction in the injection stream (the control variable). We find that the optimal fraction is likely
2:34:1954:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:to decline monotonically over time, and reach zero before the optimal termination time. Numerical
2:35:2051:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:simulations, based on an ongoing EOR project in Wyoming, confirm this result. They show also that
2:36:2148:14:14:72:540:434:12:Times:12:Times:cumulative sequestration is positively related to the oil price, and is in fact much more responsive
2:37:2248:14:14:72:540:420:12:Times:12:Times:to oil-price increases than to increases in the carbon tax. Only at very high taxes does a tradeoff between
2:38:2355:14:42:72:234:406:12:Times:12:Times:oil output and sequestration arise.

3:59:2806:33:23:72:540:668:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:There is a growing consensus in both policy circles and in the energy industry that within
3:60:2896:23:23:72:539:645:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:the next few years, the US Federal government will adopt some form of regulation of CO2
3:61:2983:23:22:72:541:622:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:emissions.1At the same time, it is widely believed that much of the nation’s energy supply
3:62:3073:22:23:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:over the coming decades will continue to come from fossil fuels, coal in particular (MIT; 2007).
3:63:3169:23:22:72:540:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Many analysts believe the only way to reconcile the anticipated growth in the use of coal with
3:64:3263:22:23:72:540:555:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:anticipated limits on CO2emissions is through the development and deployment of carbon
3:65:3349:23:23:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:capture and geological sequestration (CCS). There seems to be broad agreement, moreover,
3:66:3437:23:22:72:540:509:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that large-scale deployment of geological sequestration is likely to start with projects that
3:67:3530:22:23:72:286:487:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:apply CO2-enhanced oil recovery (EOR).2
3:68:3569:23:22:108:540:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:This technique, which has been used successfully in a number of oil plays (notably
3:69:3651:22:23:72:540:442:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in West Texas, Wyoming, and Saskatchewan), entails injection of CO2into mature oil fields
3:70:3740:23:23:72:540:419:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in  a  manner  that  causes  the  CO2to  mix  with  some  fraction  of  the  oil  that  still  remains
3:71:3842:23:22:72:540:396:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:underground.   Doing  so  reduces  the  oil’s  viscosity,  thereby  improving  its  ability  to  flow
3:72:3943:22:23:72:540:374:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:through  the  reservoir  rock,  and  enhancing  the  rate  of  extraction.3Although  some  of  the
3:73:4041:23:22:72:540:351:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:CO2resurfaces  with  the  oil,  it  can  be  separated  from  the  output  stream,  recompressed,
3:74:4138:22:23:72:540:329:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and  reinjected.   Eventually,  when  the  EOR  project  is  terminated,  all  the  injected  CO2is
3:75:4237:23:23:72:134:306:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sequestered.
3:76:4249:23:22:108:540:283:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:EOR is a “game-changing” technology for the recovery of oil from depleted reserves.
3:77:4332:22:23:72:540:261:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Estimates suggest that recovery rates for existing reserves could be approximately doubled,
3:78:4423:23:26:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:while the application of EOR on a broad scale could raise domestic recoverable oil reserves in
3:79:4517:26:16:72:540:212:8:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:1For example,  the Vice President of Environmental Policy for Duke Energy stated in a Washington Post
3:80:4618:16:12:72:540:196:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:article, “Our viewpoint is that it’s going to happen.  There’s scientific evidence of climate change.  We’d like
3:81:4730:12:12:72:540:184:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:to know what legislation will be put together so that, when we figure out how to increase our load, we know
3:82:4837:12:12:72:540:172:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:exactly what to expect.”  (Steven Mufson and Juliet Eilperin, “Energy Firms Come to Terms With Climate

3:84:5002:8:16:72:540:152:8:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:2This view was expressed in recent Congressional testimony by George Peridas, Science Fellow at the National
3:85:5110:16:12:72:540:136:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:Resources Defense Council, who said that CO2-EOR “has a substantial immediate- to long-term role to play
3:86:5214:12:12:72:540:124:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:in both increasing domestic oil production in a responsible way, and in sequestering CO2” (Peridas; 2008).

3:89:5497:9:16:72:540:91:8:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:3Other methods of enhanced oil recovery exist as well, including injection of steam, nitrogen, methane, and
3:90:5604:16:12:72:540:75:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:various  polymers.   Because  these  methods  are  not  the  focus  of  this  paper,  we  use  the  term  enhanced  oil
3:91:5723:12:0:72:347:63:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:recovery, or EOR, as shorthand for CO2-enhanced oil recovery.
4:92:5785:0:22:72:540:701:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the United States by over 80 billion barrels (ARI; 2006).  Similarly, Shaw and Bachu (2003)
4:93:5876:22:23:72:540:679:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:claim that 4,470 fields, just over half of the known oil reservoirs in Alberta, are amenable to
4:94:5971:23:22:72:540:656:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:CO2injection for enhanced oil recovery.  Babadagli (2006) states that enhanced oil recovery
4:95:6062:22:23:72:540:634:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:applied in these reservoirs could translate in an additional 165 billion barrels of oil recovered
4:96:6159:23:22:72:540:611:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and over 1 Gt of CO2sequestration.  Snyder et al. (2008) estimate that at current oil and
4:97:6248:22:23:72:540:589:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:carbon prices and with current technology, approximately half of this capacity is economically
4:98:6342:23:23:72:105:566:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:viable.
4:99:6349:23:22:108:540:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In  this  paper,  we  present  what  is  to  our  knowledge  the  first  theoretical  economic
4:100:6443:22:23:72:540:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:analysis  of  CO2-enhanced  oil  recovery.   In  the  tradition  of  Hotelling  (1931),  an  oil  field
4:101:6546:23:22:72:540:498:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:contains a physical quantity of oil which the producer seeks to extract at a particular rate
4:102:6638:22:23:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:over  time  so  as  to  maximize  the  economic  rents  from  extraction.   The  ability  to  enhance
4:103:6739:23:23:72:541:453:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:oil extraction rates through injection of CO2alters this extraction problem in a number of
4:104:6829:23:22:72:157:430:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:non-trivial ways.
4:105:6846:22:23:108:541:408:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:First,  CO2is  not  a  costless  input.   Significant  up-front  investments  are  required
4:106:6937:23:22:72:541:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to  make  production  and  injection  wells  suitable  for  CO2use.   In  addition,  maintaining  a
4:107:7036:22:23:72:540:363:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:given injection rate over time requires continuous purchases to make up for the fraction of
4:108:7127:23:23:72:541:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:injected CO2that remains sequestered in the reservoir.  Separating the remaining fraction
4:109:7216:23:22:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that resurfaces with the produced oil, and then dehydrating and recompressing it, is costly
4:110:7307:22:23:72:109:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:as well.
4:111:7315:23:22:108:540:272:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Second, even at a constant injection rate, the amount of oil recovered declines over
4:112:7399:22:23:72:540:250:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:time, as does the fraction of injected CO2that remains sequestered in the reservoir.  Both
4:113:7489:23:23:72:452:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the producer’s revenue stream and cost stream are therefore time varying.
4:114:7562:23:22:108:540:204:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Third,  while  sequestration  of  CO2currently  yields  no  economic  benefits  in  juris-
4:115:7652:22:23:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:dictions  without  carbon emissions  restrictions,  future  regulations  of  CO2emissions  in  the
4:116:7750:23:22:72:540:159:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:context of climate-change policies may generate such benefits if EOR projects are allowed to
4:117:7842:22:23:72:540:137:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:earn credits for units of CO2sequestered.  The producer’s objective would then be the maxi-
4:118:7933:23:23:72:540:114:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:mization of the combined revenue streams from both oil production and CO2sequestration,
4:119:8020:23:0:72:280:91:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:net of CO2purchase and recycling costs.
5:120:8060:0:22:108:540:701:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Fourth, carbon taxes affect these revenue and cost streams in multiple ways.  While a
5:121:8145:22:23:72:540:679:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:carbon tax effectively reduces the input cost for EOR and increases the net present value of
5:122:8237:23:22:72:540:656:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the CO2-storage potential of the oil field, the incidence of the tax on the price of oil reduces
5:123:8333:22:23:72:296:634:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the value of the traditional use of the asset.
5:124:8379:23:22:108:540:611:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Fifth,  in  addition  to  these  economic  tradeoffs,  fluid-dynamic  interactions  of  CO2,
5:125:8471:22:23:72:540:589:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:water, and oil inside the reservoir give rise to a further, physical tradeoff faced by the pro-
5:126:8566:23:23:72:540:566:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ducer.  Whereas injecting pure CO2maximizes oil recovery from the area of the reservoir
5:127:8653:23:22:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that the CO2sweeps through, that area itself may be small, as pure CO2tends to “finger”
5:128:8740:22:23:72:540:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:or “channel” between injection and production wells, bypassing some of the oil.  In compar-
5:129:8831:23:22:72:540:498:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ison, injecting pure water increases the area that is swept, but reduces recovery from that
5:130:8922:22:23:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:area.  Reservoir-engineering studies4indicate that both oil recovery and CO2sequestration
5:131:9011:23:23:72:541:453:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:are maximized when a mix of CO2and water is injected (whereby the CO2fraction that
5:132:9093:23:22:72:465:430:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:maximizes oil recovery typically differs from that maximizing sequestration).
5:133:9170:22:23:108:540:408:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Our paper provides an evaluation of the role of all five factors.  We start by developing
5:134:9259:23:22:72:539:385:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:a theoretical framework that analyzes the dynamic co-optimization of oil extraction and CO2
5:135:9350:22:23:72:540:363:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sequestration, through the producer’s choice at each point in time of an optimal CO2fraction
5:136:9442:23:23:72:540:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in the injection stream (the control variable).  The decision to cease extraction is determined
5:137:9537:23:22:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:by a transversality condition.  Both the injection and termination decisions depend in part
5:138:9628:22:23:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:on the anticipated price of oil and the carbon tax or credit price.  The paper concludes with a
5:139:9723:23:22:72:540:272:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:series of simulations that are based on an ongoing project, namely the Lost Soldier-Tensleep
5:140:9815:22:23:72:540:250:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:field in Wyoming.  These simulations generate time paths of CO2injection and implied time
5:141:9904:23:23:72:541:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:paths of oil production and CO2sequestration, for a range of oil prices and carbon taxes.  A
5:142:9996:23:22:72:540:204:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:key finding is that cumulative sequestration is positively related to the oil price, and is in
5:143:10090:22:103:72:503:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fact much more responsive to oil-price increases than to increases in the carbon tax.

6:146:10313:0:33:265:348:701:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:2.The Model
6:147:10324:33:23:72:540:668:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Our model of oil production is based on the physical reality that input injections (water,
6:148:10414:23:23:72:540:645:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:gas, or some mixture of the two) must balance with fluid output (oil, water, and gas).5In
6:149:10503:23:22:72:540:622:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:addition, the rate of oil production is linked to remaining reserves by the so-called “decline
6:150:10597:22:23:72:540:600:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:curve.”6This relation specifies output as a particular fraction of remaining reserves, where
6:151:10689:23:22:72:540:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that fraction is itself linked to the fraction of CO2in the injection stream.  Upon specifying
6:152:10783:22:23:72:540:555:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the relation between rate of CO2injection and oil production we may write down the formal
6:153:10872:23:23:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:dynamic optimization model, which we then use to describe the time path of CO2injection.
6:154:10960:23:22:72:540:509:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Ultimately, this allows us to describe the rate of CO2that is sequestered at every point in
6:155:11051:22:23:72:388:487:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:time, and thereby to determine the total amount sequestered.
6:156:11111:23:22:108:540:464:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We begin with some notation.  Let the rate of CO2injection at timetbec(t), and
6:157:11189:22:23:72:540:442:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the rate of water injection behi(t).  We assume the total rate of injection,I≡c(t) +hi(t), is
6:158:11282:23:23:72:540:419:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:constant across time.  This reflects the fact that CO2-EOR projects are usually operated at
6:159:11373:23:22:72:539:396:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:“minimum miscibility pressure,” which is the minimum pressure required to make the CO2
6:160:11459:22:23:72:540:374:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:mix  with  the  oil.   Maintaining  that  pressure  requires  a  roughly  constant  overall  injection
6:161:11561:23:22:72:95:351:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rate.
6:162:11566:22:23:108:540:329:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Let  the  rate  of  oil  production  at  timetbeq(t),  the  rate  of  CO2production  (or
6:163:11654:23:23:72:540:306:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:“leakage”) at timetbe`(t), and the rate of water production at timetbehp(t).  Materials
6:164:11741:23:35:72:206:283:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:balance then requires that
6:165:11767:35:35:225:387:248:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:q(t) +l(t) +hp(t) =c(t) +hi(t)
6:166:11797:35:23:72:540:213:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:at each point in time (with both sums equalingI).  In practice,  the leaked CO2could be
6:167:11884:23:23:72:540:190:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:vented or recycled.  Let the price of a unit of newly purchased CO2equalwsand the unit
6:168:11970:23:52:72:540:167:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cost of recycling CO2equalw`.  We assume thatws> w`, so that it is always cheaper for the
6:169:12059:52:16:72:540:115:8:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:5Reservoir engineers refer to this as “materials balance.”  It should be noted that this requirement applies
6:170:12167:16:12:72:540:99:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:at the temperature and pressure conditions that obtain inside the reservoir.  At these conditions, CO2exists
6:171:12275:12:8:72:406:87:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:in a highly compressed, “supercritical” state and behaves much like a liquid.
6:172:12352:8:16:72:540:79:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f5:6Fetkovitch (1980) provides an in-depth discussion of decline curves, and of the justification for their wide-
6:173:12462:16:0:72:312:63:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:spread use in predicting oil production from reservoirs.
7:174:12519:0:22:72:540:701:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:firm to recycle than to vent.7As a result, all leakage is re-injected and total CO2injection
7:175:12611:22:36:72:296:679:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is the sum of new purchases and leakage, or
7:176:12654:36:35:262:540:643:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:c(t) =s(t) +`(t).(1)
7:177:12674:35:23:108:539:608:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:The rate at which CO2is sequestered depends on the linkage between injected CO2
7:178:12753:23:22:72:540:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and produced oil. We assume that the fraction of oil production displaced by CO2(as opposed
7:179:12844:22:23:72:541:563:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to that displaced by water) is proportional to the fraction of CO2in the total injection stream.
7:180:12940:23:22:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We also assume that sequestered CO2takes up the underground space vacated by the oil
7:181:13024:22:23:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that it displaces.  To simplify the exposition, units of oil are chosen such that in the reservoir,
7:182:13123:23:22:72:540:495:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:vacating the space taken up by one unit of oil creates space for sequestering exactly one unit
7:183:13217:22:23:72:541:473:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of CO2.  As a result, we haves(t) =c(t)q(t)/I.  As we are focusing on an individual firm and
7:184:13309:23:35:72:438:450:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a particular oil reservoir, we may normalize so thatI= 1.  Accordingly,
7:185:13380:35:36:269:540:415:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:s(t) =c(t)q(t).(2)
7:186:13398:36:22:108:540:379:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:At any point in time, the amount of recoverable oil isR(t); we write the initial amount
7:187:13485:22:23:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of oil at the moment the EOR project is undertaken asR0.  As usual, this variable plays the
7:188:13576:23:32:72:372:334:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:role of the state variable in our analysis, and it evolves via
7:189:13638:32:39:289:540:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: ̇R=−q.(3)
7:190:13648:39:22:72:540:263:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In keeping with the physical reality of oil recovery, we assume that the rate of production can
7:191:13743:22:23:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:be described by a decline curve:q(t) =δR(t).  In our setting, however, the ratio of output to
7:192:13836:23:55:72:540:218:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reserves—which plays the role of the decline rate—is linked to the rate of injection:δ=δ(c).
7:193:13928:55:16:72:540:163:8:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:7In  practice,  the  purchase  price  of  CO2is  several  times  higher  than  the  cost  of  recycling.   Thus,  firms
7:194:14047:16:12:72:540:147:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:undertaking EOR do generally recycle CO2.  Importantly, the presence of a carbon priceτdoes not change
7:195:14149:12:12:72:540:135:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:the relevant comparison:  the cost of a newly purchased unit becomesws−τ(as the seller of the CO2avoids
7:196:14252:12:12:72:539:123:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f11:the carbon tax or receives a credit for sequestering), while the opportunity cost of recycling becomesw`−τ
7:197:14358:12:12:72:540:111:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:(as venting would obligate the producer to pay the carbon tax or purchase a credit).  Note,  however,  the
7:198:14464:12:12:72:540:99:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:implicit assumption that competition between CO2sellers will induce them to pass on the full savings on
7:199:14567:12:12:72:540:87:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:the tax or value of the credit to the EOR buyer.  In light of the fact (discussed further in the concluding
7:200:14674:12:12:72:541:75:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:section of the paper) that aggregate CO2emissions currently far outstrip all estimates of aggregate EOR
7:201:14777:12:0:72:284:63:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:sequestration, this assumption seems reasonable.
8:202:14826:0:22:72:227:701:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We therefore have the relation
8:203:14856:22:29:266:540:679:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:q(t) =δ(c)R(t).(4)
8:204:14874:29:20:72:245:650:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Combining (3) and (4), we obtain
8:205:14906:20:32:277:540:630:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: ̇R=−δ(c)R.(5)
8:206:14920:32:22:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Consistent with results from the reservoir-engineering studies cited in the introduction, we
8:207:15012:22:23:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:assume that theδ(c) function relating the rate of injection to the decline rate is concave,
8:208:15103:23:22:72:540:553:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with an interior maximum.  If only water is used (termed a “waterflood”), the decline rate
8:209:15193:22:23:72:540:531:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:isδw≡δ(0)>0.  If only CO2is used (termed a “pure CO2flood”), the decline rate isδ(1).
8:210:15278:23:23:72:541:508:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We assume, consistent again with reservoir-engineering studies, thatδ(1)> δw.  In light of
8:211:15368:23:22:72:272:485:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the concavity ofδ(c),δ′(0)>0> δ′(1).
8:212:15404:22:23:108:540:463:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The economic environment depends on three ingredients: the price of oil,p; the carbon
8:213:15489:23:22:72:540:440:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tax,τ; and operating costs.8We assume that all costs other than those of CO2purchases
8:214:15574:22:23:72:540:418:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and CO2recycling are tied to the overall amount of fluids injected and the amount of fluids
8:215:15665:23:23:72:540:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:produced.  As both amounts are constant and equal toI, these other costs are a constantF.
8:216:15754:23:35:72:340:372:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Accordingly, the firm earns a rate of profits equal to

8:218:15827:35:36:72:363:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Using (1), (2), and (5), we may rewrite the profit rate as
8:219:15885:36:28:177:434:266:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:π=pδ(c)R−[ws−τ]cδ(c)R−w`c[1−δ(c)R]−F

8:221:15954:36:22:72:540:202:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Since the combustion of oil generates CO2as a by-product, it seems reasonable to expect
8:222:16041:22:23:72:540:180:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that  there  will  be  a  tax  liability  embedded  within  the  market  price.   To  facilitate  further
8:223:16146:23:22:72:540:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:discussions of the role played by the carbon tax, it will be convenient to isolate this effect in
8:224:16243:22:20:72:540:135:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the expression of profits.  To that end, we denote the induced tax liability for a one-dollar
8:225:16336:20:16:72:540:115:8:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:8Because  our  focus  in  this  paper  is  on  the  optimal  operation  of  a  CO2flood,  we  abstract  from  up-front
8:226:16454:16:12:72:541:99:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:investments required to make an oil field “CO2ready.”  Such investments include changes in well equipment,
8:227:16560:12:12:72:540:87:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:additions of metering equipment and pipelines in the field, and the construction of a CO2recycling plant that
8:228:16669:12:12:72:540:75:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:separates produced CO2from the oil and then dehydrates and recompresses it.  We discuss likely implications
8:229:16776:12:0:72:418:63:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:of introducing up-front investment costs in the concluding section of the paper.

9:239:17443:23:22:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:its present discounted value, subject to the state equation (5), the initial value of the state
9:240:17538:22:23:72:540:399:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:variable,R0,  and  the  constraints  0≤c≤1,R≥0.   Both  the  terminal  timeTand  the
9:241:17622:23:23:72:540:376:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:terminal stockR(T) are free, and so the optimal choices of these values will be governed by
9:242:17713:23:22:72:540:353:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:transversality conditions.  To solve this dynamic optimization problem, we first define the
9:243:17804:22:36:72:206:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:current-value Hamiltonian
9:244:17829:36:35:162:540:295:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:H=π−mq=Y δ(c)R−Zcδ(c)R−w`c−F−mδ(c)R,(7)
9:245:17868:35:23:72:538:260:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:wheremis the current-value multiplier (shadow price) associated with a unit of oilin situ.
9:246:17958:23:22:108:540:237:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The  optimal  path  of  extraction  satisfies  the  maximum  principle,  which  consists  of
9:247:18050:22:23:72:540:215:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the state equation, an equation for identifying the optimal extraction rate at a given point
9:248:18142:23:22:72:540:192:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in time, and an equation of motion for the shadow price.  If the optimal extraction rate is
9:249:18233:22:36:72:285:170:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:described by an interior solution, we have
9:250:18275:36:35:188:540:134:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:Hc= (Y−Zc−m)δ′(c)R−Zδ(c)R−w`= 0,(8)
9:251:18310:35:23:72:540:99:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:whereHc=∂H/∂c.  Irrespective of whether the optimal value ofcis described by an interior
9:252:18398:23:0:72:540:76:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:solution, the state equation is given by (5), and the equation of motion for the shadow price
10:253:18492:0:22:72:80:701:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is
10:254:18494:22:29:234:540:679:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: ̇m=rm−(Y−Zc−m)δ(c).(9)
10:255:18517:29:23:72:540:650:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The  right-hand  side  of  equation  (9)  differs  from  the  standard  Hotelling  representation  by
10:256:18618:23:22:72:540:627:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:virtue of the second set of terms.  These terms capture the fact that current carbon injec-
10:257:18709:22:23:72:540:605:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tions reduce the productive capability of future injections.  The value associated with this
10:258:18801:23:22:72:540:582:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:induced diminution of the future production rate is the product of the marginal impact of
10:259:18890:22:23:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the production rate on the current-value Hamiltonian (Y−Zc−m) and the current decline
10:260:18975:23:23:72:128:537:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rate (δ(c)).
10:261:18987:23:22:108:540:514:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Because the end time is free, the value of the current-value Hamiltonian at the ter-
10:262:19071:22:23:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:minal timeTmust be zero.  As the end state is free, the product of the shadow price and
10:263:19158:23:22:72:540:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the state variable at the terminal time must also be zero:m(T)R(T) = 0.  As the extraction
10:264:19248:22:23:72:540:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rate is proportional to the stock, we infer from (7) that the profit rate must be zero at time
10:265:19342:23:23:72:541:424:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:T.  But for that to happen there must be positive revenues, which in turn requires a positive
10:266:19435:23:22:72:540:401:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:production rate.  It follows that the terminal stock is positive, so that the terminal value of
10:267:19530:22:23:72:231:379:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the shadow price must be zero.
10:268:19560:23:22:108:540:356:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We  now  turn  to  a  discussion  of  the  time  path  of  injection.   Assuming  an  interior
10:269:19654:22:36:72:386:334:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:solution over an interval, we may time-differentiate (8) to get
10:270:19717:36:35:238:375:298:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f8: ̇c= [−Hcm ̇m−HcR ̇R]/Hcc,
10:271:19743:35:23:72:540:263:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:whereHcx=∂2H/∂c∂x,x=m,c,  orR.   From  (8),  we  see  thatHcm=−δ′(c)Rand
10:272:19815:23:22:72:540:240:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:HcR= (Y−Zc−m)δ′(c)−Zδ(c) =w`/R(where we use (8) to extract the last relation).
10:273:19893:22:36:72:388:218:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Combining these observations with the state equation, we get
10:274:19953:36:35:237:540:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: ̇c= [δ′(c)R ̇m+w`δ(c)]/Hcc.(10)
10:275:19985:35:23:72:540:147:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:At  an  interior  solution,  the  denominator  is  negative  and  the  second  term  within  square
10:276:20084:23:22:72:540:124:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:brackets  is  positive.   It  follows  that  injection  is  falling  at  any  moment  whereδ′(c)  ̇mis
10:277:20186:22:0:72:338:102:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:positive; if it is negative, the sign of   ̇cis ambiguous.
11:278:20246:0:35:108:459:701:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:To further explore the time path ofc, we combine (8) and (9) to get
11:279:20313:35:35:202:540:666:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:δ′(c)R ̇m+w`δ(c) = [rδ′(c)m−Zδ(c)2]R.(11)
11:280:20354:35:23:72:540:631:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Comparing  (10)  and  (11),  it  is  apparent  that  a  sufficient  condition  for   ̇cto  be  negative
11:281:20457:23:23:72:540:608:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is  for  the  right-hand  side  of  (11)  to  be  positive.   This  will  occur,  for  example,  ifδ′>0
11:282:20560:23:22:72:540:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:andZis not large and positive, or ifZis negative and large in magnitude.  Heuristically,
11:283:20648:22:23:72:540:563:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:δ′>0 is consistent with the notion of restraining current production so as to allow rents
11:284:20737:23:22:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to  rise  over  time,  which  seems  plausible.   ForZto  be  small  is  a  bit  less  obvious.   Recall
11:285:20841:22:23:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:thatZ=ws−τ−w`,  and that by assumptionws−w`>0.  Ifws−w`is small,  which
11:286:20912:23:22:72:540:495:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is the case in our simulations and seems to be the empirically important case, thenZwill
11:287:21000:22:23:72:540:473:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:be small irrespective of the size of the carbon tax.  On the other hand, if the carbon tax is
11:288:21093:23:23:72:540:450:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:particularly large, thenZwill be negative.  On balance, then, the right-hand side of (11) will
11:289:21187:23:22:72:540:427:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:be positive in a range of cases that seem empirically relevant.  As such, the rate of injection
11:290:21282:22:23:72:215:405:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:will commonly be declining.
11:291:21309:23:22:108:540:382:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The preceding discussion focuses on interior solutions.  While these will be common,
11:292:21393:22:23:72:540:360:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:there are circumstances under which corner solutions obtain.  We now discuss those condi-
11:293:21482:23:23:72:540:337:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tions.  First, suppose the optimal rate of CO2injection is zero (i.e., it is optimal to undertake
11:294:21579:23:35:72:521:314:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a waterflood); in that caseHc≤0 when evaluated atc= 0.  The condition of interest is
11:295:21663:35:35:220:392:279:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f8:(Y−m)δ′(0)R−ZδwR−ws≤0.
11:296:21685:35:23:72:540:244:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:BecausemandRdo not change discontinuously, if this condition holds with strict inequality
11:297:21774:23:23:72:540:221:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:at a particular momentt, it must hold for an interval of time followingt.  Accordingly, during
11:298:21868:23:32:72:540:198:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:this interval the optimal level ofcremains equal to zero.  It follows that during this interval
11:299:21963:32:44:204:401:166:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f8: ̇Hc=−δ′(0)[R ̇m−(Y−m) ̇R]−Zδw ̇R,
11:300:21997:44:38:72:168:122:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:or, upon using (5),
11:301:22016:38:0:204:238:84:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f10: ̇Hc=−
11:302:22022:0:10:240:247:91:12:g_d0_f15:12:g_d0_f15:{
11:303:22023:10:0:247:391:81:12:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f9:δ′(0)[  ̇m+δw(Y−m)]−Zδ2w
11:304:22047:0:10:392:399:91:12:g_d0_f15:12:g_d0_f15:}
11:305:22048:10:0:401:540:81:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f2:R.(12)
12:306:22056:0:32:72:457:701:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Combining (9) and (12), taking note of the fact thatc= 0, we deduce that
12:307:22128:32:38:245:540:669:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: ̇Hc=−[rmδ′(0)−Zδ2w]R.(13)
12:308:22154:38:23:72:541:631:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The important thing to note here is that for negative values ofZ, or values ofZthat are
12:309:22241:23:23:72:540:608:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:positive but relatively small in magnitude, the right-hand side of (13) will be non-positive; as
12:310:22337:23:22:72:540:585:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:we noted above, this restriction does not seem to be terribly demanding.  In such a scenario,
12:311:22430:22:23:72:540:563:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:onceHcbecomes negative, it tends to stay negative.  We conclude that it will be typical for
12:312:22521:23:22:72:397:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the corner solutionc= 0 to remain in effect once it is initiated.
12:313:22586:22:23:108:540:518:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Now suppose the optimal rate of CO2injection is one (i.e., it is optimal to undertake
12:314:22671:23:35:72:541:495:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a pure CO2flood); in that caseHc≥0 when evaluated atc= 1.  The condition of interest is
12:315:22758:35:36:204:408:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f8:(Y−Z−m)δ′(1)R−Zδ(1)R−ws≥0.
12:316:22784:36:22:72:540:424:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:As with thec= 0 corner solution, if this condition holds with strict inequality, it must apply
12:317:22878:22:33:72:337:402:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:for an interval of time; during that interval we have
12:318:22931:33:38:239:540:369:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2: ̇Hc=−[rmδ′(1)−Zδ(1)2]R.(14)
12:319:22959:38:23:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:As noted above, the only way this corner solution can obtain is ifZis negative and large
12:320:23047:23:22:72:540:308:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in magnitude.  On the other hand,δ′(1)<0.  Thus, depending on the relative magnitudes
12:321:23132:22:23:72:540:286:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ofZandm,Hccan  either  be  rising  or  falling.   Importantly,  asmis  likely  to  fall  over
12:322:23225:23:22:72:541:263:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:time,  eventually ̇Hcwill become negative.  It follows that the pure CO2flood cannot last
12:323:23314:22:23:72:456:241:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:indefinitely:  at some point, it will be optimal to adopt an interior solution.
12:324:23393:23:23:108:540:218:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Our  model  thus  predicts  that  under  most  conditions,  from  the  point  at  which  a
12:325:23483:23:22:72:541:195:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:CO2flood is initiated, CO2injection will be non-increasing over time until it reaches zero.
12:326:23574:22:23:72:540:173:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:After this, a pure waterflood will continue until the flow profits are equal to the flow fixed
12:327:23668:23:22:72:540:150:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:costs,  at  which  time  extraction  activity  ceases.   This  endogenous  endpoint  occurs  when
12:328:23765:22:23:72:540:128:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the shadow value reaches zero.  The initial value of carbon injection, the rate of decline of
12:329:23858:23:23:72:540:105:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:injection  over  time,  the  point  at  which  a  pure  waterflood  begins  and  ends,  and  the  total
12:330:23961:23:0:72:540:82:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:amounts  of  oil  production  and  carbon  sequestration  will  be  determined  by  field-specific
13:331:24061:0:22:72:540:701:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:physical characteristics that determine theδfunction and the initial stateR.  Of course, they
13:332:24154:22:50:72:540:679:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:will also be affected by the oil price and carbon tax, which define the economic environment.
13:333:24247:50:34:228:384:629:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:4.Simulation Framework
13:334:24269:34:22:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In order to add greater context to the results derived above, we have solved and simulated
13:335:24359:22:23:72:540:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the  model  numerically  to  yield  optimal  time  paths  of  carbon  injection  rates  for  various
13:336:24459:23:22:72:540:550:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:combinations of oil price and carbon tax.  Below we first discuss the solution algorithm and
13:337:24551:22:23:72:176:528:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:then present results.
13:338:24572:23:23:108:540:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The optimization problem is reasonably straightforward, in that it involves a single
13:339:24656:23:22:72:541:482:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:control variable, CO2injectionc, which is optimized given a single state variable, remaining
13:340:24748:22:23:72:540:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:physical reservesR.  We used two approaches to solving the problem, which (up to rounding
13:341:24837:23:22:72:540:437:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:errors) yielded identical results.  The first approach was a brute-force determination of the
13:342:24930:22:23:72:540:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:optimal time path ofc.  In this approach, a discretized version of the control problem was

15:391:28046:22:23:72:540:679:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:starting  the  CO2flood  suggests  that  ultimately  about  36  million  barrels  of  oil  would  be

15:393:28240:22:23:72:432:634:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:simulation applies a scaling factor of about 1/40 to the LSTP project.
15:394:28310:23:22:108:540:611:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The various cost parameters of the model are based on a variety of sources, including
15:395:28395:22:23:72:540:589:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:data presented in McCoy (2008) and EIA (2007), as well as personal communication with
15:396:28480:23:23:72:541:566:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:industry experts.10Oil producers commonly measure CO2in units of 1,000 cubic feet (mcf)
15:397:28567:23:22:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:at standard surface temperature and pressure conditions.  In Wyoming, the purchase price
15:398:28655:22:23:72:540:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of CO2is currently about $2 permcf.  To convert this price to reservoir barrels,  we have
15:399:28744:23:22:72:540:498:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to  take  account  of  the  fact  that  the  CO2is  greatly  compressed  when  it  is  injected  into
15:400:28845:22:23:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the  reservoir.   At  LSTP,  the  compression  factor  (referred  to  by  reservoir  engineers  as  the
15:401:28948:23:23:72:540:453:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:“formation  volume  factor  for  CO2”)  is  0.471rb/mcf(which,  since  1mcfcorresponds  to
15:402:29038:23:22:72:540:430:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:about 178 barrels, amounts to a compression rate of about 380 times).  Rounding this factor
15:403:29129:22:23:72:539:408:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f9:up to 0.5, we end up with a gross CO2purchase pricewsof $4/rb.  We take the unit costw`

15:405:29303:22:23:72:240:363:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the order of $0.50/mcf, or $1/rb.
15:406:29336:23:23:108:540:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:It is important to note at this point that, although we express carbon taxes throughout

15:408:29512:22:23:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(P,wsandw`) the parameterτis expressed in dollars perrb.  Since one tCO2corresponds
15:409:29595:23:22:72:540:272:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to about 19.05mcf, the above-mentioned conversion factor for LSTP of 0.5mcf/rbresults
15:410:29680:22:23:72:541:250:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in a combined conversion factor of 9.5rb/tCO2, which we round up to 10.  In other words,
15:411:29768:23:23:72:390:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a carbon tax of $40/tCO2translates to a per-barrel tax of $4.
15:412:29829:23:22:108:540:204:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Operating costs unrelated to injection or recycling of CO2amount to about $24,000
15:413:29910:22:23:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:per  well  per  year  in  non-injection  or  production-related  expenses,  plus  about  $0.0125  per
15:414:30011:23:22:72:540:159:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:barrel of overall injection or production.  Applying our scaling factor of 1/40 to LSTP’s total
15:415:30106:22:23:72:540:137:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of about 110 active wells, each producing or injecting about 800,000rbper year, this works

16:418:30356:0:22:108:540:701:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:As noted above, the parameterβ, which describes carbon-tax incidence on oil pro-
16:419:30436:22:23:72:540:679:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ducers, is actually a combination of tax incidence effects and unit conversions that transform
16:420:30530:23:22:72:540:656:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a unit of produced oil into carbon units.  Tax incidence effects depend on demand and supply
16:421:30622:22:23:72:540:634:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:elasticities.  Based on estimates by Gately and Huntington (2002) of the long-run elasticity
16:422:30714:23:22:72:540:611:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of oil demand and by Gately (2004) of the long-run elasticity of non-OPEC oil supply, we
16:423:30802:22:23:72:540:589:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:set the tax incidence on producers of a given tax expressed in dollars per barrel of oil at
16:424:30893:23:23:72:540:566:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:55%.  Based on data reported in EPA (2007), we estimate the quantity of CO2generated by
16:425:30980:23:22:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:combusting one barrel of oil at around 0.4tCO2, or 4rb.  Multiplying this by the incidence of
16:426:31073:22:23:72:541:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:55%, and recalling thatτin the numerical model is expressed in dollars perrb, we end up
16:427:31160:23:22:72:330:498:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:with a combined incidence parameter ofβ= 2.2.11
16:428:31207:22:23:108:540:476:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Lastly,  the  parameters  ofδ(c)  function  are  based  on  a  combination  of  production

16:430:31399:23:22:72:540:430:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:oil  production  at  LSTP  since  it  started  its  CO2flood  in  1989  is  about  11.5%,  whereby
16:431:31497:22:23:72:540:408:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the fraction of CO2in overall injection has been held roughly constant over time at 0.35.
16:432:31586:23:22:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Also, simulation data based on data from an oil field in China indicate that, compared to

16:435:31875:23:22:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:years of injecting pure CO2is higher by a factor of five-thirds (Guo et al.; 2006).  These data
16:436:31970:22:36:72:300:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:are consistent with a quadraticδ(c) function

16:443:32388:31:16:72:540:103:8:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:11Because estimates of demand and supply elasticities for oil, and thereby of the tax incidence, are subject
16:444:32496:16:12:72:540:87:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:to considerable uncertainty, we have performed some sensitivity analysis on this parameter.  We find that,

17:461:33019:29:23:108:541:466:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:It should be emphasized that, although there are good reasons to believe that theδ(c)
17:462:33104:23:23:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:function is concave,12its precise shape for any given reservoir is likely to strongly depend on
17:463:33199:23:22:72:540:420:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:geological properties such as permeability, thickness, and heterogeneity of the reservoir rock.
17:464:33294:22:50:72:531:398:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The particular parameterization used here should therefore be viewed as only illustrative.

17:466:33404:34:22:72:540:314:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The first element of behavior that we wish to define is the optimal extraction and sequestra-
17:467:33497:22:23:72:540:292:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tion path for our benchmark assumptions.  Here, we use an oil price of $100 with no carbon
17:468:33587:23:23:72:540:269:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tax.  Panel (a) of Figure 2 shows the optimal paths of CO2injection (c), CO2leakage (`), oil
17:469:33679:23:22:72:316:246:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:production (q), and flow CO2sequestration (s).
17:470:33725:22:23:108:540:224:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The  optimal  initial  injection  rate  is  0.485  million  barrels/year,  somewhat  smaller
17:471:33817:23:22:72:540:201:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:than either the instantaneous oil-production maximizing rate of 0.625 or the myopic profit-
17:472:33908:22:23:72:540:179:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:maximizing injection rate of 0.582.  This reflects the producer’s tradeoffs of current against
17:473:34002:23:23:72:540:156:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:future extraction,  and of oil revenues against CO2injection costs.  Note also that a large
17:474:34093:23:22:72:540:133:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:fraction (initially about 88%) of the injected CO2resurfaces with the produced oil and must
17:475:34184:22:23:72:540:111:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:be recycled.  As oil production declines over time from its initial rate of 0.119 million bar-
17:476:34278:23:21:72:540:88:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rels/year,  the producer’s revenues decline as well,  as does CO2sequestration in the space

18:508:34829:23:22:72:540:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:over  time  even  if  the  producer  chose  to  hold  CO2injection  constant.   This  changing  bal-
18:509:34929:22:23:72:540:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ance between oil revenues and recycling costs makes it optimal for the producer to instead
18:510:35019:23:23:72:445:372:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:gradually reduce the injection rate over time, as predicted by the theory.
18:511:35093:23:22:108:541:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:After  22  years,  the  optimal  CO2injection  rate  drops  to  zero,  at  which  point  the
18:512:35185:22:23:72:540:327:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:producer  switches  to  a  pure  waterflood,  thereby  completely  avoiding  CO2injection  costs.
18:513:35282:23:22:72:540:304:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:From  that  point  in  time  forward,  profits  consist  of  the  (declining)  oil  revenues  less  fixed
18:514:35387:22:23:72:506:282:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:costs.  These remain positive for another 31 years, after which the field is shut down.

18:516:35559:22:23:72:540:237:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with our analysis in the previous section, the shadow price declines throughout, reaching its

18:519:35714:28:23:72:540:154:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Our investigation of the comparative dynamics of the model starts with the effect of higher
18:520:35805:23:22:72:540:131:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:oil prices.  Panel (a) of Figure 3 shows how the optimal CO2injection path changes as the oil
18:521:35898:22:23:72:540:109:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:price level is raised from $100 to $300/bl.  Panel (c) of Figure 3 shows how the optimal time

18:523:36082:23:0:72:540:63:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a pure water flood.  The higher resulting oil revenues make it optimal to initially raise the

19:593:36893:23:22:72:540:131:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:at the baseline price of $100, initial revenues are already very high relative to CO2-related
19:594:36986:22:23:72:540:109:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:costs,  baseline oil production is already very close to its revenue-maximizing rate at each

20:626:37735:23:23:72:540:389:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:CO2-rich injection mix implies that cumulative sequestration over the productive lifetime of
20:627:37827:23:22:72:283:366:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the field increases, as shown in panel (b).
20:628:37870:22:23:108:540:344:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Figure  4  shows  oil  supply  and  resulting  CO2sequestration  as  a  function  of  the  oil
20:629:37964:23:22:72:540:321:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:price.  Panel (a) shows cumulative levels of both,  whereas panel (b) shows the annualized
20:630:38054:22:23:72:540:299:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:equivalent.13Note  that  CO2sequestration  supply  drops  to  zero  at  at  a  price  of  $12/bl,
20:631:38151:23:22:72:540:276:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:below which incremental oil revenues from CO2injection no longer justify the higher variable
20:632:38243:22:23:72:540:254:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:costs.14At lower prices, the producer therefore optimally operates the field as a waterflood,
20:633:38336:23:23:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:resulting  in  zero  sequestration  and  in  slower  oil  extraction.   Once  the  price  drops  below
20:634:38438:23:22:72:540:208:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:$1.70/bl, oil revenues no longer cover the operating costs of a waterflood either, making it
20:635:38530:22:27:72:267:186:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:optimal to not operate the field at all.
20:636:38570:27:16:72:540:159:8:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:13The annualized values are calculated as the constant ratesorqthat,  when multiplied by the relevant

20:646:38879:9:16:72:541:79:8:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:14Recall that we abstract from up-front capital costs associated with CO2injection.  Implicitly, we assume
20:647:38985:16:0:72:370:63:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:that at time 0 these costs have already been incurred, and are sunk.
21:648:39055:0:22:108:540:701:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Note also that at prices of $50/bl and higher, changes in the price of oil have almost
21:649:39141:22:23:72:540:679:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:no effect on oil output:  at the baseline price of $100, the elasticity of cumulative output is
21:650:39236:23:22:72:540:656:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:0.01, while that of annualized output is 0.04.  This point is consistent with the result shown
21:651:39330:22:23:72:540:634:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in panels (c) and (d) of Figure 3:  at these high oil prices, operating costs become so small
21:652:39423:23:22:72:540:611:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:relative to oil revenues that the optimal oil extraction path is very close to the optimal path
21:653:39518:22:23:72:540:589:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that would obtain if costs were zero (i.e., the revenue-maximizing path).  Nevertheless, as
21:654:39609:23:23:72:540:566:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:shown  in  panels  (a)  and  (b)  of  Figure  3,  higher  oil  prices  do  induce  substantially  higher
21:655:39713:23:22:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rates of CO2injection, and thereby sequestration.  As a result, the sequestration curves in
21:656:39804:22:23:72:540:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Figure 4 are substantially more elastic: at the baseline price of $100, the cross-price elasticity
21:657:39902:23:32:72:491:498:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of cumulative sequestration is 0.52, while that of annualized sequestration is 0.47.
21:658:39986:32:28:242:370:466:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f14:5.2.Effects of carbon tax
21:659:40011:28:23:72:540:438:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:We continue our investigation of the comparative dynamics of the model with the effect of
21:660:40100:23:22:72:540:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:higher carbon taxes.  Such taxes reduce both the net-of-tax oil price received by the producer
21:661:40194:22:23:72:540:393:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:and the net-of-tax input price of CO2.  However, at a given injection ratec(t), the change
21:662:40284:23:22:72:540:370:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in oil revenues from a marginal tax change is is−q(t)dτ, whereas the change in input costs
21:663:40374:22:23:72:540:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is−c(t)q(t)dτ.  As long asc(t) is below its upper bound of 1, the revenue effect therefore
21:664:40464:23:23:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:dominates,  in which case the firm is motivated to move the injection schedule forward in
21:665:40553:23:22:72:540:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:time.  Indeed, panel (a) of Figure 5 shows that the optimal initial injection rate increases in
21:666:40648:22:23:72:540:280:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the tax rate.  However, it also shows that the optimal time to switch to pure water injection is
21:667:40744:23:22:72:540:257:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:accelerated.  As a result, injection rates decline more rapidly over time the higher is the tax.
21:668:40840:22:23:72:540:235:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Even so, the overall effect of higher carbon taxes on cumulative sequestration is positive, as
21:669:40934:23:22:72:540:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:shown in panel (b).  Panels (c) and (d) show that oil production tends to be insensitive to the
21:670:41029:22:23:72:540:190:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:level of the carbon tax, which coincides with our earlier observation that revenue effects from
21:671:41124:23:23:72:537:167:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:oil sales tend to be more important than input costs in driving the firm’s output decisions.
21:672:41216:23:22:108:540:144:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Nevertheless,  it is worth noting that at the highest tax level considered in the fig-
21:673:41302:22:23:72:540:122:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:ure, namely $120/tCO2, the initial injection rate in panel (a) slightly exceeds the output-
21:674:41393:23:22:72:540:99:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:maximizing rate of 0.625 million bl/year; further increases in the tax level would raise the
21:675:41485:22:0:72:539:77:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:initial injection rate to even higher levels.  Because such high tax levels make the net CO2

22:746:42276:46:23:72:540:154:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:price strongly negative, CO2injection is optimally pushed to levels where its marginal effect
22:747:42369:23:22:72:540:131:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:on oil production becomes negative as well, thereby reducing initial oil production.  In effect,
22:748:42465:22:23:72:540:109:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the producer sacrifices oil output and revenues early on in return for higher sequestration
22:749:42556:23:23:72:540:86:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:revenues that result from higher initial CO2injection rates.  Very high tax rates, in other
22:750:42647:23:0:72:511:63:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:words, induce a tradeoff between maximizing oil revenues and sequestration revenues.

23:779:43080:30:22:108:540:417:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Figure 6 shows CO2sequestration supply and associated oil output as a function of
23:780:43161:22:23:72:540:395:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the carbon tax.  Because the oil extraction paths are very close to their revenue-maximizing
23:781:43253:23:23:72:540:372:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:values regardless of the level of the carbon tax, oil output is almost perfectly inelastic with
23:782:43348:23:22:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:respect to the carbon tax.  More surprising is that the sequestration supply curves are quite
23:783:43441:22:23:72:540:327:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:inelastic  as  well.   At  the  current  European  tax  level  of  about  $40/tCO2,  the  elasticity  of
23:784:43545:23:22:72:540:304:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cumulative sequestration is only 0.05, and that of annualized sequestration only 0.06.  Even
23:785:43637:22:32:72:461:282:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:at much higher taxes, up to $400/tCO2, these elasticities never exceed 0.55.

23:787:43761:28:23:72:540:222:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:To recap, the results of subsection 5.1 suggest that the rates of CO2injection and seques-
23:788:43851:23:23:72:540:199:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tration  are  both  relatively  responsive  to  higher  oil  prices.   The  result  is  larger  levels  of
23:789:43957:23:22:72:540:176:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cumulative sequestration at higher prices.  On the other hand, the results of subsection 5.2
23:790:44049:22:23:72:540:154:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:indicate that higher carbon-tax levels increase the optimal CO2injection rate early on, but
23:791:44140:23:22:72:540:131:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reduce  it  later,  with  the  same  qualitative  effects  on  the  induced  CO2sequestration  rate.
23:792:44240:22:23:72:540:109:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The initial increase in sequestration dominates, however, resulting in higher overall levels of
23:793:44335:23:23:72:540:86:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cumulative  sequestration.   Even  so,  the  net  impact  is  relatively  small,  so  that  cumulative
23:794:44437:23:0:72:394:63:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sequestration is relatively unresponsive to higher carbon taxes.
24:795:44503:0:22:108:540:701:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In this subsection, we briefly consider combined changes in oil price and carbon tax,
24:796:44588:22:23:72:540:679:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to look for possible interaction effects.  Panel (a) of Figure 7 shows optimal CO2injection
24:797:44679:23:22:72:540:656:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:at four oil price/carbon tax combinations,  namely oil prices of $100/bl and $200/bl,  with
24:798:44770:22:23:72:540:634:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:carbon taxes of $40/tCO2and $80/tCO2.  At the time of writing, current oil prices are about
24:799:44861:23:22:72:540:611:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:$100/bl, while the current carbon price in the European market is about $40/tCO2.  Thus,
24:800:44949:22:23:72:540:589:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:one can interpret the variations as corresponding to a doubling of current prices.  The plots
24:801:45042:23:23:72:540:566:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in panel (a) suggest a negative interaction effect:  at both oil prices, a doubling of the carbon
24:802:45139:23:22:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tax tilts the injection path forward in time, but the effect is smaller at the higher oil price.
24:803:45235:22:23:72:540:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:As a result, the increment in cumulative sequestration, shown in panel (b), is smaller as well.
24:804:45330:23:22:108:539:498:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:The  more  obvious  point  to  take  away  from  this  figure,  however,  is  that  both  CO2
24:805:45423:22:23:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:injection and cumulative sequestration are far less sensitive to the carbon tax than to the
24:806:45514:23:23:72:540:453:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:oil price.  While a doubling of the carbon tax does tilt the CO2injection path forward, and
24:807:45605:23:22:72:540:430:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:does increase the ultimate amount of sequestered carbon, these effects pale by comparison
24:808:45694:22:23:72:334:408:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:with the impacts due to a doubling of the oil price.
24:809:45746:23:22:108:551:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The interesting—and somewhat paradoxical—implication is that for CO2-EOR projects,
24:810:45828:22:23:72:540:363:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:high oil prices are much more potent incentives for sequestration than are high carbon taxes.
24:811:45921:23:23:72:540:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:The reason is that higher oil prices induce the firm to significantly increase CO2injection
24:812:46012:23:22:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:throughout  the  lifetime  of  the  CO2flood,  so  as  to  bring  oil  production  even  closer  to  its
24:813:46116:22:23:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:physical maximum rate than it already is.  As a result, a greater fraction of the space in the
24:814:46210:23:22:72:540:272:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reservoir vacated by the produced oil is taken up by CO2rather than water.  The higher
24:815:46296:22:23:72:540:250:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:sequestration, in other words, arises essentially as an unintended by-product, or side effect,
24:816:46390:23:23:72:216:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of the higher oil production.
24:817:46419:23:22:108:540:204:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:As noted in subsection 5.2, it is only at very high carbon-tax levels that sequestration
24:818:46507:22:23:72:540:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:revenues start to compete with oil revenues, driving the firm to increase CO2injection beyond
24:819:46600:23:0:72:217:159:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the output-maximizing rate.

25:855:47103:54:34:264:348:391:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:6.Conclusion
25:856:47115:34:22:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In this paper, we have examined how the standard resource-economics problem of optimizing
25:857:47204:22:23:72:540:335:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the rate of oil extraction from a field is altered when the producer has the option of increasing
25:858:47301:23:23:72:540:312:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the rate of oil extraction through continuous injections of a mix of CO2and water into the
25:859:47391:23:22:72:540:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:reservoir.  Our focus in the paper is on the producer’s problem of determining the optimal
25:860:47481:22:23:72:540:267:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:CO2injection  rate  over  time  and  thus  the  effects  of  carbon  taxes  and  oil  prices  on  oil
25:861:47582:23:22:72:264:244:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:production and carbon sequestration.
25:862:47618:22:23:108:540:222:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Our theoretical analysis of this problem indicates that the optimal CO2injection rate
25:863:47703:23:23:72:540:199:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:will typically decline over time, and may eventually drop to zero before it becomes optimal
25:864:47794:23:22:72:540:176:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to terminate the extraction process.  Numerical simulations confirm these results and allow
25:865:47885:22:23:72:385:154:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:us to further investigate comparative dynamics of the model.
25:866:47945:23:22:108:540:131:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Our simulation results suggest good news and bad news for potential carbon seques-
25:867:48027:22:23:72:540:109:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:tration  from  EOR.  The  bad  news  is  that  EOR-based  carbon  sequestration  appears  to  be
25:868:48123:23:23:72:540:86:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:highly inelastic to carbon taxes.  As such, there is little hope that policies raising the cost of
25:869:48221:23:0:72:540:63:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:CO2emissions will induce large increases in EOR-based sequestration. The good news is that
26:870:48313:0:22:72:541:701:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:market conditions favoring high oil pricesarelikely to induce such increases in sequestration,
26:871:48407:22:23:72:445:679:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:essentially as a by-product of producers’ attempts to increase oil output.
26:872:48481:23:22:108:540:656:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Of  course,  the  apparent  inelasticity  of  EOR-based  carbon  sequestration  at  the  in-
26:873:48573:22:23:72:540:634:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:dividual well level need not imply inelastic supply at a more aggregated level.  Moreover,
26:874:48663:23:22:72:540:611:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:because oil reservoirs are generally not spatially homogeneous with respect to relevant physi-
26:875:48757:22:23:72:540:589:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:cal parameters such as thickness, permeability, and integrity of the cap rock, it is conceivable
26:876:48853:23:23:72:540:566:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:that EOR would be attractive in some sections of a reservoir,  but not others,  for a given
26:877:48944:23:22:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:combination of economic parameters.15In such a scenario, the supply of sequestration ser-
26:878:49033:22:23:72:540:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:vices for the oil reservoir might be less inelastic to the carbon price than our results indicate.
26:879:49131:23:22:72:540:498:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Additionally, if one imagines comparing across different reservoirs, it seems likely that EOR
26:880:49224:22:23:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:projects would come on-line at different combinations of oil price and carbon price.  Again,
26:881:49316:23:23:72:540:453:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:this observation suggests that the sequestration supply curve for a broader geographic entity,
26:882:49410:23:22:72:540:430:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:such as a state or country as a whole, would likely be less inelastic than is true for the single
26:883:49507:22:23:72:170:408:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:unit that we study.
26:884:49526:23:22:108:540:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:An important caveat to the good news—the significant responsiveness of sequestration
26:885:49610:22:23:72:540:363:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to oil prices—concerns a counter-balancing effect that applies at the larger geographic level,
26:886:49704:23:23:72:540:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:but  is  insignificant  at  the  single-unit  level.   Because  large-scale  deployment  of  EOR  will
26:887:49806:23:22:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:generally  raise  aggregate  oil  production,  it  will  tend  to  reduce  the  market  price  of  oil  for
26:888:49913:22:23:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:any given level of the carbon tax.  This in turn will increase the consumption of petroleum-
26:889:50005:23:22:72:540:272:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:based products, such as motor vehicle fuel, which will generate increased carbon emissions
26:890:50095:22:23:72:540:250:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in its own right.  It is not clear how these additional emissions compare to the sequestration
26:891:50189:23:23:72:540:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f14:associated with EOR, but it is conceivable that, on balance, EOR could lead to a netincrease
26:892:50281:23:22:72:325:204:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in carbon emissions at the state or national level.
26:893:50332:22:23:108:540:182:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:In addition, the overall sequestration capacity of EOR projects, while quite large in
26:894:50417:23:22:72:540:159:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:absolute terms, is quite small in comparison to both overall CO2emissions and the capacity
26:895:50507:22:23:72:540:137:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:of  other  geological  sequestration  options.   For  example,  the  12  GtCO2that  Dooley  et  al.
26:896:50606:23:35:72:540:114:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:(2006) estimate as the theoretical sequestration capacity of all depleted U.S. oil reservoirs
26:897:50699:35:16:72:540:79:8:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:15This is true, for example, of the Salt Creek field in Wyoming, one of the largest EOR projects currently
26:898:50805:16:0:72:161:63:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:operating in the US.
27:899:50827:0:22:72:539:701:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:(including  those  depleted  through  EOR)  amounts  to  just  two  years’  worth  of  U.S.  CO2
27:900:50923:22:23:72:540:679:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:emissions (EPA; 2008).  In contrast, the same study estimates the theoretical sequestration
27:901:51014:23:22:72:540:656:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:capacity of U.S. saline aquifers to be as large as 3,630 GtCO2, making clear that in the long
27:902:51107:22:23:72:540:634:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:run, the main contribution to geological sequestration will have to come from such aquifers.
27:903:51199:23:22:108:540:611:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Nevertheless, these points do not imply that EOR has no positive social role to play
27:904:51283:22:23:72:540:589:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:in promoting geological carbon sequestration.  The societal importance of EOR lies in the
27:905:51372:23:23:72:540:566:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:widely  held  expectation  that  it  can  provide  a  bridge  to  that  long  run.   That  is,  profits
27:906:51475:23:22:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:from  CO2-enhanced  oil  output  can  be  used  to  “jump-start”  the  building  of  pipelines  and
27:907:51574:22:23:72:540:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:other infrastructure required for ultimately much larger-scale sequestration in non-oil-bearing
27:908:51669:23:22:72:138:498:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f4:formations.16
27:909:51682:22:23:108:540:476:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A key question we plan to address in future work is how large these EOR profits are
27:910:51765:23:23:72:540:453:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:likely to be.  Clearly, analysis of this question will require expanding our model to account for
27:911:51862:23:22:72:540:430:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:up-front investment costs associated with converting a field to CO2-injection.  Preliminary
27:912:51953:22:23:72:540:408:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:estimates suggest that, for a field of the scale used in our numerical simulations, these costs
27:913:52048:23:22:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:would amount to several million dollars, and that the cutoff oil price (in the absence of a
27:914:52139:22:23:72:483:363:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:carbon tax) at which incurring these costs would be justified lies around $50/bl.
27:915:52220:23:23:108:540:340:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A further extension concerns the effect of rising (rather than constant) oil prices and
27:916:52307:23:22:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:carbon taxes on both the optimal management of a CO2flood and the decision to initiate such
27:917:52398:22:23:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:a flood.  In a stationary economic environment, there is never an incentive to delay switching
27:918:52492:23:22:72:540:272:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:to EOR—if doing so is not profitable at time 0, it will never be.  Increasing prices may well
27:919:52585:22:23:72:540:250:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:induce  such  delay,  however.   Geologically  heterogeneous  projects  will  make  the  switch  at
27:920:52684:23:23:72:540:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:different cutoff prices, thereby shifting out the aggregate supply of sequestration over time.
27:921:52778:23:53:72:540:204:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:Moreover, even projects that could profitably switch immediately at time 0 may optimally
27:922:52866:53:16:72:541:151:8:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:16As  noted  by  William  L.  Townsend,  CEO  of  a  major  CO2-pipeline  company,  in  recent  Congressional
27:923:52975:16:12:72:540:135:10:g_d0_f5:7:g_d0_f6:testimony:   “It  is  clear  that  the  long-term  geologic  sequestration  answer  to  single-point,  industrial  CO2
27:924:53093:12:12:72:540:123:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:emissions  capture  and  storage  is  in  saline  aquifers,  not  EOR  projects.   That  being  said,  there  is  a  very
27:925:53214:12:12:72:540:111:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:strong, cost-effective interim answer for the next ten years that employs the oil-based revenues in EOR to
27:926:53320:12:12:72:540:99:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:subsidize the infrastructure build-out and prepare the foundation of a carbon highway for the next generation
27:927:53429:12:12:72:540:87:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:of  cost-effective  CCS  in  power  generation.”   (Townsend;  2007)  The  same  view  was  expressed  also  in  the
27:928:53545:12:12:72:540:75:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:testimony by George Peridas (Peridas; 2008) and in the National Petroleum Council report (NPC; 2007)
27:929:53645:12:0:72:155:63:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:cited in footnote 2.
28:930:53667:0:22:72:540:701:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:choose to delay, if doing so increases the net present value of switching.17Interestingly, it
28:931:53760:22:23:72:540:679:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:seems likely that the latter type of delay may have the effect ofreducingsequestration in a
28:932:53851:23:22:72:540:656:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:given reservoir.  This is because the switch would occur at a lower remaining reserve stock,
28:933:53943:22:23:72:268:634:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:leaving less oil to be replaced by CO2.
28:934:53982:23:22:108:540:611:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A final complication left for future work concerns the likely endogeneity of the reserve
28:935:54070:22:23:72:540:589:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:stock to CO2injections.  By reducing the viscosity of reservoir oil, CO2injections may not
28:936:54160:23:23:72:540:566:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:only enhance the rate at which a given reserve stock can be extracted, but also increase the
28:937:54252:23:22:72:540:543:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:stock itself. That is, oil that is impossible to flush out with a waterflood—referred to by reser-
28:938:54350:22:23:72:540:521:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:voir engineers as “stranded” oil—may become recoverable once it mixes with CO2.  Clearly,
28:939:54439:23:22:72:540:498:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:this reserve-enhancing effect of CO2injections is likely to not be instantaneous, however, but
28:940:54533:22:23:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:rather tied to the cumulative amount of CO2injected.  Modeling it would therefore require
28:941:54622:23:23:72:540:453:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:introducing cumulative injection as second state variable, thereby significantly complicating
28:942:54715:23:22:72:540:430:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:the analysis.  How, if at all, this might alter the qualitative conclusions of the present paper
28:943:54811:22:329:72:174:408:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:is an open question.
28:944:54831:329:16:72:540:79:8:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:17This  is  conceivable  even  if  oil  prices  rise  at  rates  below  the  discount  rate,  because  the  ability  to  delay
28:945:54957:16:0:72:331:63:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:up-front investments implies that rents may increase faster.
