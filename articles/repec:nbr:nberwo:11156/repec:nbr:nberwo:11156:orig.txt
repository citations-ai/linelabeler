2:28:1359:31:24:71:539:592:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This  paper  empirically  explores  the  procedures  employed  by  standard-setting  organizations.
2:29:1458:24:24:71:539:568:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Consistent with Lerner-Tirole (2004), we find (a) a negative relationship between the extent to which
2:30:1559:24:24:71:539:544:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:an SSO is oriented to technology sponsors and the concession level required of sponsors and (b) a
2:31:1656:24:24:71:539:520:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:positive  correlation  between  the  sponsor-friendliness  of  the  selected  SSO  and  the  quality  of  the
2:32:1765:24:24:71:539:496:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:standard. We also develop and test two extensions of the earlier model: the presence of provisions
2:33:1863:24:24:71:539:472:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:mandating royalty-free licensing is negatively associated with disclosure requirements, and when
2:34:1959:24:24:71:539:448:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:there are only a limited number of SSOs, the relationship between concessions and user friendliness
2:35:2058:24:31:71:119:424:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:is weaker.

3:55:2439:0:13:89:169:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:1. Introduction 
3:56:2455:13:14:89:92:695:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4: 
3:57:2455:14:14:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The  economic  importance  of  technological  standards  has  grown  tremendously  over  the 
3:58:2548:14:14:89:524:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:past  two  decades.    The  growing  recognition  of  the  importance  of  the  standardization 
3:59:2644:14:13:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:process has been attributed in large part to the growth of the information technology and 
3:60:2734:13:14:89:524:640:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:communications industries, for which standards are critical.  At the same time, there has 
3:61:2824:14:14:89:524:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:been  substantial  flux  among  these  organizations:  for  instance,  over  the  past  15  years, 
3:62:2923:14:14:89:524:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:consortia  and  informal  standard-setting  bodies  have  in  many  cases  supplanted  formal 
3:63:3017:14:14:89:479:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:national and international standard development organizations (Cargill (2002)).   
3:64:3099:14:13:89:92:584:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: 
3:65:3099:13:14:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Yet  despite  this  growing  and  dynamic  economic  role,  standard-setting  organizations 
3:66:3191:14:14:89:524:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(SSOs) have attracted remarkably little empirical attention from economists.  This paper 
3:67:3280:14:14:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:seeks  to  address  this  gap  by  investigating  the  relationship  between  these  organizations’ 
3:68:3380:14:14:89:524:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:characteristics  and  their  policies  governing  the  disclosure  and  licensing  of  intellectual 
3:69:3480:14:13:89:246:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:property such as patent awards.  
3:70:3513:13:14:89:92:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: 
3:71:3513:14:14:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To  frame  our  empirical  analysis,  we  first  highlight  some  of  the  implications  of  the 
3:72:3610:14:14:89:524:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:baseline model in Lerner and Tirole (2004). In particular, we highlight that the extent of 
3:73:3701:14:14:89:521:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:concessions  made  by  technology  sponsors  will  be  positively  correlated  with  the  user-
3:74:3796:14:13:89:524:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:friendliness  of  the  SSO  (defined  as  the  relative  weight  of  users  over  sponsors  in  the 
3:75:3896:13:14:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:SSO’s  objective  function)  and  that  when  a  standard  is  more  desirable  (which  we 
3:76:3987:14:14:89:524:419:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:anticipate  will  be  associated  with  the  maturity  of  the  technology),  a  less  user-friendly 
3:77:4088:14:14:89:195:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:SSO will be selected. 
3:78:4110:14:14:89:95:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:  
3:79:4112:14:13:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We  then  extend  this  model  in  two  ways.    First,  we  consider  requirements  around 
3:80:4204:13:14:89:524:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:disclosure.      From   the   theoretical   analysis   emerges   the   prediction   that   within   an 
3:81:4307:14:14:89:524:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equilibrium,  a  higher  licensing  price  is  associated  with  more  disclosure.    Second,  we 
3:82:4405:14:14:89:524:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:examine  settings  in  which  there  are  only  a  limited  number  of  SSOs,  and  hence  these 
3:83:4502:14:14:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:organizations can dictate terms to technology sponsors.  We show that in settings where 
3:84:4590:14:13:89:524:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:there  are only  a limited  number of SSOs, the relationship between concessions and user 
3:85:4680:13:14:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:friendliness is unlikely to hold: sponsor-friendly SSOs are tempted to demand substantial 
3:86:4770:14:14:89:524:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:concessions  to  provide  certification  and  therefore  attract  weak  standards;  by  contrast, 
3:87:4868:14:14:89:524:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:user-friendly SSOs are tempted to make weak demands so as to appeal to sponsors with 
3:88:4953:14:14:89:198:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:stronger technologies. 
3:89:4976:14:13:89:92:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: 
3:90:4976:13:14:89:524:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:To address these questions, we built the first database of SSOs sufficiently large to enable 
3:91:5069:14:14:89:524:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cross-sectional  analyses.    Combining  information  from  the  SSOs’  web  sites,  records  of 
3:92:5166:14:14:89:524:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:standards bodies, and information collected from surveys and interviews, we compiled a 
3:93:5253:14:14:89:232:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:database of nearly 60 bodies. 
3:94:5283:14:13:89:92:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: 
3:95:5283:13:14:89:524:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Our  results  are  largely  consistent  with  our  theoretical  suggestions.  We  find  a  negative 
3:96:5383:14:14:89:524:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relationship  between  the  extent  to  which  a  standard  setting  organization  is  oriented 
3:97:5479:14:14:89:524:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:towards  sponsors  and  the  concessions  required  of  the  technology  sponsors.  Second, 
3:98:5571:14:14:89:524:115:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sponsor  orientation  of  the  selected  SSO  is  positively  associated  with  the  maturity  of  a 
3:99:5672:14:13:89:262:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:technological field of the standard.  
3:100:5710:13:0:89:92:88:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: 
4:101:5713:0:14:89:524:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The  results  are  also  largely  consistent  with  the  theoretical  extensions  developed  in  this 
4:102:5815:14:14:89:524:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:paper.  First, we find that the presence of a provision mandating royalty-free licensing is 
4:103:5907:14:14:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:negatively  associated  with  the  presence  of  a  disclosure  requirement,  while  weaker 
4:104:5999:14:14:89:527:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:“reasonable”  licensing  requirements  are  strongly  associated  with  such  a  provision.  
4:105:6092:14:13:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Second, when we divide the SSOs into those with above and below the median number of 
4:106:6177:13:14:89:524:640:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:other  SSOs  in  their  technological  sub-field,  we  find  that  the  relationship  between  user 
4:107:6277:14:14:89:524:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:friendliness and concessions is considerably  tighter among SSOs located in classes  with 
4:108:6367:14:14:89:217:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:many other organizations.

4:117:6699:13:14:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Despite the copious research on standards, it is striking how little work has addressed the 
4:118:6791:14:14:89:524:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:question  of  how  these  organizations  are  or  should  be  organized.    Many  of  the  papers  in

4:122:7176:14:14:89:524:419:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:played the key role in adjudicating between the desires of different parties about possible 
4:123:7268:14:14:89:524:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:standards (e.g., Farrell and Shapiro (1992)).  In addition, several papers have considered 
4:124:7359:14:14:89:524:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:which   settings   (e.g.,   the   extent   of   buyer   and   seller   concentration   and   product 
4:125:7460:14:13:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:differentiation)  are  suited  to  the  establishment  of  standards  (for  instance,  Hemenway 
4:126:7556:13:14:89:524:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(1975)).    Finally,  in  recent  years  papers  have  examined  the  interaction  between  SSO’s

4:133:8109:14:14:89:525:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:SSO), by product market competition (de facto standard setting in the marketplace), or a 
4:134:8198:14:14:89:524:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:hybrid  between  the  two  approaches.    The  SSO  in  their  model  is  a  place  where  the  two 
4:135:8298:14:13:89:521:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:parties  can  negotiate,  but  has  no  institutional  features  (e.g.,  rules  governing  decision-
4:136:8398:13:14:89:524:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:making  or  requiring  concessions  from  sponsors).    Nor  would  there  be  a  need  for  more

4:138:8601:14:14:89:524:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:show  that  the  committee  process  is  more  likely  to  arrive  at  a  high-value  consensus  than

5:150:9580:14:14:89:527:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:will be selected, but that the delays will be a function of the presence of vested interests.

7:328:14889:14:13:89:92:137:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: 
7:329:14889:13:14:89:524:124:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:One  aspect  that  we  did  not  consider  in  the  earlier  paper  is  disclosure.  In  our  interviews, 
7:330:14995:14:14:89:524:110:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:firms  highlighted  several  costs  associated  with  the  disclosure  of  information  in  the 
7:331:15091:14:14:89:524:96:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:standard  setting  process,  even  of  already-issued  patents.  In  particular,  they  argued  that 
7:332:15192:14:0:89:524:82:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:due  to  the  number  and  complexity  of  patent  portfolios,  rivals  frequently  could  not 
8:333:15290:0:14:89:524:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:determine  “the  needle  in  the  haystack”:  that  is,  which  patents  were  relevant  to  a  given 
8:334:15392:14:14:89:524:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:standardization  effort.3  By  highlighting  the  relevant  patents  or  applications,  in  many 
8:335:15489:14:14:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:cases  firms  felt  they  were  disclosing  valuable  information  to  competitors  about  the 
8:336:15584:14:14:89:524:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:applicability  of  their  patent  portfolios  and  their  future  technological  strategies  more 
8:337:15682:14:13:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:generally.  Second,  early  disclosure  of  plans  may  invalidate  the  ability  to  get  future 
8:338:15780:13:14:89:524:640:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:awards. Third, the undisclosed intellectual property may have multiple uses, one of them 
8:339:15869:14:14:89:524:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relative to the standard.   A disclosure can spur efforts to invent around the technologies 
8:340:15961:14:14:89:524:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and  thereby  either  lead  to  a  sacrifice  in  profits  in  unrelated  markets,  or  else  boost  the 
8:341:16066:14:14:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:attractiveness  of  a  competing  standard.  In  such  cases,  the  sponsor  would  like  to  retain 
8:342:16167:14:13:89:449:584:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:secrecy—or at least ambiguity—of the applicability of its patent portfolio. 
8:343:16243:13:14:89:92:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: 
8:344:16243:14:14:89:524:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Some SSOs demand that sponsors commit to revealing awards and/or applications shortly 
8:345:16329:14:14:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:before  the  standard  is  endorsed.  Others  do  not  require  disclosure,  although  there  is  an 
8:346:16430:14:14:89:524:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:understanding that undisclosed patents that are later deemed relevant to the standard will 
8:347:16521:14:13:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:be  subject  to  the  same  pricing  principles  as  the  ones  that  are  currently  examined  by  the 
8:348:16625:13:14:89:524:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:SSO:  for  example,  a  royalty-free  agreement  will  as  well  cover  undisclosed,  essential 
8:349:16721:14:14:89:521:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:patents in the future. While in our sample, the same pricing regime (for instance, royalty-
8:350:16812:14:14:89:524:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:free   or   reasonable-and-non-discriminatory   (RAND))   applies   to   both   disclosed   and 
8:351:16908:14:14:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:undisclosed patents, it is not a priori obvious why this is the case. In particular a sponsor 
8:352:17002:14:13:89:524:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:who does not wish to disclose patent applications, wants to collect royalties on examined 
8:353:17092:13:14:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:patents, and yet would like to reassure users as to the possibility of a hold-up, could offer

8:357:17349:14:13:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Intuitively,  disclosure  involves  a  trade-off  between  reassuring  users  and  not  wasting 
8:358:17445:13:14:89:524:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:intellectual  property.  On  the  one  hand,  the  absence  of  disclosure  raises  the  concern  that 
8:359:17548:14:14:89:524:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:users,  once  they  have  invested  in  the  technology,  will  be  held  up  by  the  sponsor  as  a

8:361:17740:14:14:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  technology.  On  the  other  hand,  in  the  absence  of  hold-up  concerns  of  the  users,  the 
8:362:17843:14:13:89:524:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sponsor  would  prefer  not  to  disclose  applications  or  technological  strategies  more 
8:363:17936:13:14:89:143:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:generally.  
8:364:17948:14:14:89:92:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: 
8:365:17948:14:14:89:521:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In  order  to  investigate  the  relationship  between  disclosure  policies,  pricing  and  user-
8:366:18046:14:14:89:524:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:friendliness, let us study the following extension of the basic model. The sponsor has two 
8:367:18137:14:13:89:238:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:pieces of intellectual property: 
8:368:18170:13:15:89:92:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: 
8:369:18170:15:15:89:517:211:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f3:∑ the existing, disclosed patent (or set of patents), that forms the basis for the standard; 
8:370:18262:15:13:89:518:196:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f3:∑ an “add-on” potential patent, that is subject to an application to the patent office or is 
8:371:18354:13:14:107:510:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:merely in the pipeline. There is no uncertainty about whether the patent on this add-
8:372:18439:14:26:107:519:169:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:on will be granted (nothing changes if the patent will be granted with probability less 
8:373:18527:26:7:233:236:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                 
8:374:18575:7:16:89:524:136:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:3In fact, U.S. legal rules mandating trebled damages for willful infringement lead firms to discourage their 
8:375:18684:16:12:89:385:120:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:engineers from even examining the patent portfolios of their competitors. 
8:376:18758:12:7:89:91:108:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3: 
8:377:18758:7:15:89:519:101:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:4Indeed, such a “mixed regime” has been proposed under the name of “penalty default” by Lemley (2002). 
8:378:18861:15:12:89:91:86:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3: 
8:379:18861:12:0:89:91:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3: 
9:380:18864:0:14:107:147:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:than 1). 
9:381:18873:14:14:89:92:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: 
9:382:18873:14:16:89:525:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:There  are  two  states  of  nature,  i.e.,  two  types  of  sponsors:  “good”  (probability r)  and 
9:383:18974:16:16:89:525:665:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:“bad” (probability r-1). In either case, the add-on patent adds value H to the standard. 
9:384:19063:16:14:89:524:649:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:What differs is the baseline value. For the good type, the add-on really adds to the value 
9:385:19154:14:14:89:524:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of  the  existing  technology:  the  attractiveness  parameter  increases  from a  to Ha+.  By 
9:386:19249:14:14:89:524:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:contrast,  for  the  bad  type,  the  add-on  is  a  missing  piece  in  the  initial  standard.  In  its 
9:387:19355:14:15:89:525:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:absence, the proposed standard has attractiveness Ha- only, and what the add-on does 
9:388:19440:15:14:89:525:592:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is to restore this attractiveness parameter to its full-implementation value a. Thus, H is 
9:389:19531:14:23:89:276:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:a measure of the potential for hold-up. 
9:390:19571:23:24:89:228:555:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The timing goes as follows:  
9:391:19600:24:14:89:524:531:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(i)  The  sponsor  applies  to  an  SSO  with  parameter a.  The  application  specifies  whether 
9:392:19698:14:15:89:524:517:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:patent applications are to be disclosed (D) or not (ND) upon acceptance. It also specifies 
9:393:19789:15:26:89:423:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:prices, 0≥p for the basic technology and []Hq,0Œ for the add-on.  
9:394:19855:26:14:89:524:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(ii)  The  SSO  observes b,  and  under  disclosure  the  state  of  nature;  it  then  chooses  to 
9:395:19955:14:14:89:524:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:endorse  the  technology  or  not.  If  the  technology  is  endorsed  and  under  a  disclosure 
9:396:20052:14:24:89:348:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:agreement (D), the sponsor must disclose the add-on. 
9:397:20105:24:26:89:469:424:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(iii) The users choose whether to adopt the technology and, if so, pay price p. 
9:398:20185:26:14:89:524:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:(iv) The sponsor receives a patent for the add-on, which is then deemed essential by the 
9:399:20274:14:16:89:462:384:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:SSO (if it has not been disclosed earlier) and proposes a price q to the users. 
9:400:20354:16:14:89:92:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: 
9:401:20354:14:14:89:524:354:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The good type incurs disclosure cost 0>d in unrelated markets, say, when the add-on is 
9:402:20441:14:14:89:524:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:disclosed (the disclosure cost for the bad type is irrelevant as long as it is strictly positive, 
9:403:20539:14:14:89:524:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:since  the  bad  type  then  never  has  an  incentive  to  disclose).  Disclosure  of  the  add-on 
9:404:20639:14:13:89:511:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reveals whether the add-on is a true improvement or else just implementation-enabling. 
9:405:20726:13:14:89:92:299:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: 
9:406:20726:14:14:89:524:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A  couple  of  important  points  are  in  order.  First,  the  sponsor  cannot  do  better  than 
9:407:20824:14:14:89:524:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:choosing to contract on whether to disclosure and prices (the contract is an optimal one). 
9:408:20915:14:14:89:525:257:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Because the value added by the add-on patent is the same, H, in both states of nature, it 
9:409:21005:14:13:89:524:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is  not  possible  to  elicit  from  users  information  about  the  state  of  nature.  Second,  we 
9:410:21106:13:14:89:524:230:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:implicitly assume that the sponsor cannot disclose to the SSO confidentially, i.e., that the 
9:411:21199:14:14:89:524:216:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:disclosure  is  subject  to  leakages.    Otherwise,  disclosure  would  always  be  a  dominant 
9:412:21296:14:14:89:524:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:strategy for the good type (and costless for the bad type). It would just not be perceived 
9:413:21387:14:28:89:266:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:as costly and would be a non-issue.5 
9:414:21423:28:7:233:236:160:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                 
9:415:21471:7:16:89:524:153:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:5The reader may wonder how the SSO can decide to endorse the standard before seeing the add-on in case 
9:416:21574:16:12:89:523:137:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the  policy  is  one  of  disclosure.  This,  however,  is  not  an  issue.  Because  only  the  good  type  may  in 
9:417:21691:12:12:89:524:125:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:equilibrium disclose, the SSO can presume that the basic technology has value a and accept conditionally 
9:418:21796:12:13:89:464:113:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:on checking that this is indeed correct. Mathematically it endorses the standard if and only if

9:420:21923:14:12:89:515:86:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and commits not to endorse the technology if the basic value is Ha- rather than the claimed level of a. 
9:421:22027:12:0:89:91:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3: 
10:422:22030:0:14:89:524:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The game is a signaling game. As will become clear from the expressions of profits, the 
10:423:22118:14:17:89:525:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:good  and  bad  types  have  the  same  preferences  over  prices p  and q.  Thus,  we  assume 
10:424:22213:17:16:89:524:678:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that  the  SSO  and  the  users  infer  nothing  about  the  state  of  nature  from  the  choice  of p 
10:425:22316:16:16:89:524:662:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:and q. By contrast, preferences differ as to the disclosure decision, which therefore will 
10:426:22407:16:14:89:524:646:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:convey  information  to  the  SSO  and  the  users.  Second,  we  will  show  that  the  signaling 
10:427:22506:14:13:89:524:632:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:game  always  has  a  Pareto-dominant  equilibrium;  we  will  accordingly  focus  on  this 
10:428:22598:13:14:89:309:619:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:equilibrium for comparative statics purposes.

15:748:29351:14:14:89:524:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:SSOs just demand more concessions.  To assess the validity of this alternative theory, it

19:1008:40681:16:12:89:524:189:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and the survey. Sometimes, there is no specific decision process pertaining to standard setting. In that case, 
19:1009:40792:12:11:89:524:177:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:we assumed that the publicly available decision process, which pertains to general decisions, encompasses

21:1083:46312:13:14:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Table  2  reports  the  results  of  this  analysis.    While  not  all  cross-tabulations  between  the 
21:1084:46417:14:14:89:524:501:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:proxies  for  alpha  and  c  are  statistically  significant,  the  basic  pattern  is  clear:  in  every 
21:1085:46523:14:14:89:524:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:case,  the  level  of  c  is  higher  for  those  with  a  lower  proxy  for  alpha.    When  we  add 
21:1086:46625:14:14:89:524:473:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:together the alpha dummies in the final two columns, we see in each case the difference 
21:1087:46713:14:13:89:524:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:is  significant  at  the  five-percent  confidence  level.    For  instance,  for  SSOs  who  require 
21:1088:46815:13:14:89:524:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:royalty-free licenses, the alpha score is 0.6; for the others, it is 1.6.  For SSOs requiring 
21:1089:46909:14:14:89:468:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:binding dispute resolution, the alpha score is 0.4; for the others, it is again 1.6.

21:1091:46994:14:14:89:524:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The  results  regarding  the  disclosure  requirements  are  much  less  clear-cut.    Only  one  of 
21:1092:47095:14:13:89:527:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  ten  cross-tabulations  is  significant,  and  that  only  at  the  ten-percent  confidence  level.  
21:1093:47201:13:14:89:464:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The summed alpha scores are also not significantly different from each other. 
21:1094:47279:14:14:89:92:363:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: 
21:1095:47279:14:14:89:524:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In Table 3, we look at the correlations between the alpha and c proxies.  There is a strong 
21:1096:47371:14:14:89:527:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:negative  correlation  between  the  scores,  -0.53,  which  is  highly  statistically  significant.  
21:1097:47473:14:13:89:524:321:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We also examine the correlation between these two scores and the individual elements of 
21:1098:47561:13:14:89:521:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  other  index.    These  correlations  are  each  statistically  significant,  at  least  at  the  ten-
21:1099:47668:14:14:89:524:294:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:percent confidence level.  Once again, no significant relationship between the disclosure 
21:1100:47758:14:14:89:267:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:policies and the alpha score appears. 
21:1101:47796:14:14:89:92:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: 
21:1102:47796:14:13:89:524:252:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We  next  turn  to  regression  analyses.    In  Table  4,  we  seek  to  explain  the  extent  of 
21:1103:47895:13:14:89:524:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:concessions offered by an SSO, given its level of user-friendliness.  (This assumption of 
21:1104:47985:14:24:89:524:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the exogeneity of alpha is plausible if we assume free entry. As the tabulations discussed

21:1109:48418:7:16:89:524:159:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:20The  majority (63%) of organizations  use RAND in  the patent licensing rules. Only 9%  of organizations 
21:1110:48525:16:12:89:524:143:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:use royalty-free rules. Even fewer organizations use assignment (2%) and compulsory rules (2%). We also 
21:1111:48629:12:11:89:524:131:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:repeat  the  analysis  with  a  third  dummy  that  takes  on  the  value  one  for  those  SSOs  that  require  patent 
21:1112:48749:11:12:89:443:120:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:assignment (which might be seen as particularly taxing).  The results are little changed.  
21:1113:48840:12:7:89:92:108:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3: 
21:1114:48840:7:15:89:524:101:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:21Our data show that only 9% of organizations have a dispute resolution mechanism. It should be noted that 
21:1115:48947:15:12:89:470:86:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:in some cases, separate provisions govern copyright licensing, but we have not recorded these.

22:1118:49141:14:14:89:524:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:reveal,  this  assumption  does  not  appear  unreasonable.  If  it  did  not  hold,  we  should 
22:1119:49238:14:14:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:probably regard this as more representative of correlation than causation.)  In each case, 
22:1120:49329:14:14:89:524:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we  estimate  first  a  basic  specification,  and  then  with  (unreported)  dummy  variables  that 
22:1121:49430:14:13:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:control  for  the  technologies  covered  by  the  SSO.  (We  determine  these  first  by  checking

22:1125:49824:14:14:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:organizations to respond to our survey, filling out the number of standards they published 
22:1126:49915:14:13:89:524:584:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:in  each  field  and  sub-field.    For  non-responding  SSOs,  we  make  our  own  classification, 
22:1127:50015:13:14:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:based  on  information  from  the  mission  statements  or  elsewhere  on  the  organizations’ 
22:1128:50110:14:14:89:524:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:websites.)  We employ ordered logit regressions throughout, reflecting the fact that while 
22:1129:50201:14:14:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we  expect  that  an  organization  with  a  c  score  of  2  is  more  restrictive  than  that  with  a 
22:1130:50306:14:14:89:400:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:score of 1, it is difficult to say exactly how more restrictive it is.

22:1132:50377:13:14:89:524:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The table reveals again that there is a strong relationship between c and alpha, even after 
22:1133:50469:14:14:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we  add  industry  controls.    When  we  examine  the  individual  elements  of  alpha,  we  see 
22:1134:50567:14:14:89:524:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:that while all the coefficients are negative, the two consistently significant indicators are 
22:1135:50661:14:14:89:434:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:if the standards body is an SIG and if all the members are corporations.

22:1137:50734:13:14:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:When we look at the three individual components of the  c score in Table 5, we see that 
22:1138:50822:14:14:89:524:419:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the alpha score is consistently negative in each.  Moreover, each coefficient is statistically 
22:1139:50917:14:14:89:524:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:significant  at  least  at  the  five-percent  confidence  level.    When  we  look  at  the  two 
22:1140:51015:14:14:89:524:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:disclosure  measures,  we  find  that  not  only  is  the  alpha  coefficient  not  statistically 
22:1141:51113:14:13:89:295:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:significant, but it takes on a different sign.

22:1145:51185:14:14:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In this section, we look at three additional predictions of our model.  These relate to the 
22:1146:51277:14:13:89:524:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relationships  between  disclosure  requirements  and  licensing  price,  the  impact  of  limited 
22:1147:51376:13:14:89:515:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:competition between SSOs, and the consequences of the differing maturity of standards. 
22:1148:51463:14:14:89:92:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: 
22:1149:51463:14:14:89:524:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:First,  as  was  discussed  in  Section  3  above,  we  also  hypothesize  a  relationship  between 
22:1150:51563:14:14:89:524:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:disclosure and price.  In particular, Proposition 2 suggested that within an equilibrium, a 
22:1151:51655:14:13:89:377:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:higher licensing price was associated with more disclosure. 
22:1152:51715:13:14:89:92:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: 
22:1153:51715:14:14:89:524:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In  Table  6,  we  look  at  the  two  most  commonly  encountered  terms  relating  to  licensing 
22:1154:51814:14:14:89:524:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:fees and their relationship with the disclosure provisions.  We find that the presence of a 
22:1155:51906:14:14:89:524:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:provision mandating royalty-free licensing is negatively associated with the presence of a 
22:1156:51997:14:13:89:524:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:disclosure  requirement,  while  RAND  licensing  is  strongly  associated  with  such  a 
22:1157:52087:13:14:89:524:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:requirement.    The  pattern  goes  the  same  way  in  both  the  analysis  of  the  disclosure  of 
22:1158:52188:14:23:89:449:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:patent awards and applications, but it is much stronger in the former case.

23:1164:52564:0:14:89:92:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: 
23:1165:52564:14:14:89:524:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The pattern of more disclosure being associated with higher licensing rates in Table 6 is 
23:1166:52654:14:14:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:broadly consistent with the theoretical predictions above. The fact that the relationship is 
23:1167:52747:14:14:89:524:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:stronger for patent awards is also consistent with our predictions. Lemma 1 states that if 
23:1168:52838:14:13:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:the  disclosure  cost  is  high,  then  it  is  more  likely  that  there  will  be  pooling  with  no 
23:1169:52941:13:14:89:524:640:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:disclosure, making the relationship overall weaker. Since it is plausible to assume that the 
23:1170:53034:14:14:89:524:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:disclosure  cost  is  higher  for  patent  applications  than  for  awards,  this  pattern  is  also 
23:1171:53135:14:14:89:138:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9:expected. 
23:1172:53144:14:14:89:92:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: 
23:1173:53144:14:13:89:524:584:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Second,  as  noted  above,  an  alternative  hypothesis  for  the  relationship  between  c  and 
23:1174:53241:13:14:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:alpha is that the patterns are due to market power.   It may be that some  SSOs have few 
23:1175:53330:14:14:89:524:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:competitors.    As  a  result,  they  are  able  to  demand  that  sponsors  make  concessions,  as 
23:1176:53430:14:14:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:well  as  having  a  much  more  user-orientated  approach.    As  shown  in  Section  3.3,  this 
23:1177:53528:14:14:89:524:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:argument,  while  initially  plausible,  does  not  bear  up  under  scrutiny.    As  Proposition  4 
23:1178:53629:14:13:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:showed,  when  there  are  a  limited  number  of  SSOs,  it  is  by  no  means  clear  that  the 
23:1179:53727:13:14:89:319:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:relationship between alpha and c will still hold. 
23:1180:53777:14:14:89:92:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: 
23:1181:53777:14:14:89:524:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We  address  this  issue  in  two  ways.    First,  we  rerun  the  regressions  in  Table  4,  simply 
23:1182:53880:14:14:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:adding a proxy for the market power of each SSO. The proxy we employ is the density of 
23:1183:53967:14:13:89:525:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:other  SSOs  in  the  same  technological  sub-field(s)  as  a  given  SSO.23    If  the  sponsor  can 
23:1184:54070:13:14:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:turn  to  many  other  SSOs,  then  it  is  unlikely  that  the  SSO  can  impose  these  types  of 
23:1185:54170:14:14:89:524:419:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:requirements.    We  determine  this  measure  again  through  the  ILI  Infobase,  using  the 
23:1186:54265:14:14:89:524:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f5:classification   scheme   in   the   International   Organization   for   Standardization’s ISO 
23:1187:54361:14:14:89:525:391:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f3:Catalogue.24 In general, the density of SSOs is quite high.  The mean SSO has 13.9 other 
23:1188:54450:14:13:89:313:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:SSOs in its sub-field (with a median of 13.5).  
23:1189:54498:13:14:89:92:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: 
23:1190:54498:14:14:89:524:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We check to see whether once this control is added, the relationship between alpha and c 
23:1191:54587:14:14:89:524:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:still  holds.    Then,  we  compare  the  goodness-of-fit  in  regressions  when  SSOs  do  and  do 
23:1192:54687:14:14:89:263:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:not have considerable competition.

23:1194:54723:13:14:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Table 7 presents the results of the analysis.  In the first four regressions, we examine the 
23:1195:54816:14:14:89:527:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:impact  of  adding  the  measure  of  density  of  other  SSOs  in  the  technological  sub-fields.  
23:1196:54917:14:14:89:524:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We  find  the  measure  has  little  impact:  across  all  four  regressions  (and  numerous 
23:1197:55010:14:14:89:524:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:unreported ones), it is not statistically or economically significant.  As  before, there is  a 
23:1198:55106:14:13:89:326:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:strong negative association between c and alpha. 
23:1199:55155:13:14:89:92:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: 
23:1200:55155:14:14:89:524:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We then compare the goodness-of-fit in regressions using SSOs that did and did not have 
23:1201:55243:14:14:89:524:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:market  power.    We  divide  the  SSOs  into  those  where  there  was  above  and  below  the 
23:1202:55339:14:14:89:524:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:median  number  of  other  SSOs  in  their  technological  sub-fields.    In  the  reported 
23:1203:55431:14:27:89:524:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:regressions (and in numerous unreported ones), the goodness-of-fit is higher when we use 
23:1204:55520:27:7:233:236:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:                                                 
23:1205:55568:7:16:89:518:136:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:23For instance, if an organization is active in sub-fields A and B, and there are 3 and 4 active organizations 
23:1206:55679:16:12:89:451:120:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:in A and B, respectively, then the market power index for this organization is (3 + 4)*1/2. 
23:1207:55771:12:7:89:92:108:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3: 
23:1208:55771:7:15:89:524:101:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:24Of course, the sponsor may have the option to create a new SSO, a possibility that our measure can only 
23:1209:55877:15:12:89:174:86:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:imperfectly capture.  
23:1210:55899:12:0:89:92:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3: 
24:1211:55902:0:14:89:524:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:SSOs located in sub-fields with many other organizations: the absolute t-statistics of the 
24:1212:55993:14:14:89:524:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:independent   variables   of   interest   are   larger,   the -2-statistics   are   more   statistically 
24:1213:56098:14:14:89:524:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:significant,  and  the  log  likelihoods  are  smaller.    This  is  particularly  striking  in  the  last 
24:1214:56205:14:14:89:524:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:pair  of  regressions  reported  in  Table  7.    When  using  those  SSOs  with  above-median 
24:1215:56300:14:13:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:density,  three  of  four  c-score  elements  are  statistically  significant;  when  using  those 
24:1216:56399:13:14:89:524:640:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:below  the  median  density,  none  are.    This  pattern  is  consistent  with  the  predictions  of 
24:1217:56501:14:14:89:174:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Proposition 4.

24:1219:56521:14:14:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The  final  analysis  in  Table  8  examines  the  relationship  between  the  maturity  of  the 
24:1220:56618:14:13:89:524:584:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:standards  in  the  technology  where  the  SSO  is  operating  and  the  alpha  measure.    We 
24:1221:56714:13:14:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:believe that the best indicator of opportunity is not the maturity of the project per se, but 
24:1222:56808:14:14:89:524:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:rather the collective state of projects in that particular technological sub-field.  Over time, 
24:1223:56904:14:14:89:524:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:many  of  the  substantial  technological  uncertainties  about  standards  in  a  sub-field  are 
24:1224:57002:14:14:89:524:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:likely to be resolved, increasing its attractiveness.  If a field is less developed, it would be 
24:1225:57098:14:13:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:more difficult for technical committees to come up with standard proposals or drafts that 
24:1226:57188:13:14:89:524:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:take  into  account  all  technological  implications,  thus  lengthening  the  approval  time  of 
24:1227:57287:14:14:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:standards in the field. Alternatively, there may be a higher option value to sponsors from 
24:1228:57378:14:14:89:524:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:delaying their decision to participate, as suggested in Farhi, et al. (2005). We thus use the 
24:1229:57472:14:14:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:maturity  level  of  standards  in  a  technological  field  as  a  proxy  for  the  standard’s 
24:1230:57568:14:13:89:206:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:attractiveness to users.   
24:1231:57595:13:14:89:92:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: 
24:1232:57595:14:14:89:524:419:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We  compute  the  maturity  of  the  technological  sub-field(s)  in  which  each  standard 
24:1233:57687:14:14:89:524:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:operates   as   follows.      Following   the   procedure   outlined   above,   we   assign   each 
24:1234:57786:14:14:89:525:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:organization  to  one  or  more  sub-fields  as  delineated  in  the ISO  Catalogue.    We  then 
24:1235:57883:14:13:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:construct the maturity level for each of the sub-fields by summing up the maturity rank of 
24:1236:57974:13:14:89:524:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:each other standards in the sub-field and dividing the sum by the number of standards in 
24:1237:58063:14:14:89:524:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:each sub-field. We use the ISO’s rating of maturity, which indicates the maturity of that 
24:1238:58153:14:14:89:524:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:standard  on  a  scale  of  0  (“preliminary  stage”)  to  99  (standard  withdrawn  after  being 
24:1239:58251:14:14:89:524:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:implemented).    We  compute  the  average  maturity  of  the  standards  in  that  category.    If 
24:1240:58351:14:13:89:524:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:there are no standards in a sub-field, it receives the least mature rank.  If an organization 
24:1241:58445:13:14:89:524:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:spans across fields or sub-fields, we compute a simple average of the maturity levels for 
24:1242:58535:14:14:89:253:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:all relevant fields or sub-fields.25

24:1244:58573:14:14:89:527:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Table 8 reports that there appears to be a positive correlation between maturity and alpha.  
24:1245:58666:14:13:89:524:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:The first panel indicates that SSOs operating in sub-fields where standards are above the 
24:1246:58756:13:14:89:524:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:median maturity tend to have a significantly higher alpha.  The second panel presents an 
24:1247:58845:14:14:89:524:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ordered logit regression, with the alpha score of the SSO as the dependent variable.  Once 
24:1248:58936:14:14:89:524:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:again,  a  higher  maturity  score  is  significantly  associated  with  a  higher  alpha,  consistent 
24:1249:59039:14:14:89:328:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:with the theoretical predictions delineated above.

24:1255:59153:8:16:89:524:90:6:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:25In principle,  we could  have calculated a  weighted average  but since  we do  not  have information for the 
24:1256:59265:16:0:89:434:74:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:number of standards of most of the organizations, we have not pursued this approach. 
25:1257:59353:0:14:89:524:709:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:Standard-setting organizations have received surprisingly little empirical scrutiny, despite 
25:1258:59446:14:14:89:524:695:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:their  economic  importance  and  dynamism.  This  paper  seeks  to  address  this  omission, 
25:1259:59540:14:14:89:408:681:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:empirically examining a cross-section sample of nearly 60 SSOs.  
25:1260:59605:14:14:89:92:667:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: 
25:1261:59605:14:13:89:524:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We  focus  initially  on  two  key  testable  hypotheses  from  Lerner-Tirole  (2004).  First,  we 
25:1262:59704:13:14:89:524:640:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:expect  that  there  is  a  negative  relationship  between  the  extent  to  which  an  SSO  is 
25:1263:59801:14:14:89:524:626:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:oriented  to  technology  sponsors  and  the  concession  level  required  of  sponsors.  In  this 
25:1264:59900:14:14:89:524:612:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:paper,  we  indeed  find  a  significant  negative  relationship,  even  when  we  control  for 
25:1265:59996:14:14:89:524:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:industry  effects.  Second,  we  expect  the  sponsor-friendliness  of  the  selected  SSO  to  be 
25:1266:60095:14:13:89:524:584:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:positively  associated  with  the  quality  of  a  standard.  The  data  reveal  a  statistically 
25:1267:60193:13:14:89:524:571:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:significant  association  between  sponsor-friendliness  and  the  maturity  of  a  technological 
25:1268:60291:14:14:89:524:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:sub-field  in  which  the  standard  is  located,  which  we  suggest  should  be  a  proxy  for 
25:1269:60388:14:14:89:163:543:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:attractiveness.  
25:1270:60405:14:14:89:92:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: 
25:1271:60405:14:13:89:524:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:In this paper,  we  also derive a number of further  theoretical  results, which we then test. 
25:1272:60500:13:14:89:527:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:We  extend  the  model  in  two  ways.    First,  we  consider  requirements  around  disclosure.  
25:1273:60599:14:14:89:524:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:From the theoretical analysis emerges the prediction that within an equilibrium, a higher 
25:1274:60689:14:14:89:524:474:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:licensing price should be associated with more disclosure.  Empirically, we find that the 
25:1275:60779:14:14:89:524:460:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:presence of a provision mandating royalty-free licensing is negatively associated with the 
25:1276:60870:14:13:89:524:446:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:presence of a disclosure requirement, while weaker “reasonable” licensing provisions are 
25:1277:60959:13:14:89:524:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:strongly associated with such a requirement. Second, we examine settings in which there 
25:1278:61047:14:14:89:524:419:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:are  only  a  limited  number  of  SSOs,  and  hence  these  organizations  can  dictate  terms  to 
25:1279:61147:14:14:89:524:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:technological sponsors.  We show that in settings where there are only a limited number 
25:1280:61235:14:14:89:524:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:of SSOs, the relationship between concessions and user-friendliness may not hold. When 
25:1281:61322:14:13:89:524:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:we divide our sample of SSOs into those where there were above and below the median 
25:1282:61406:13:14:89:524:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:number  of  other  SSOs  in  their  technological  sub-field,  we  find  that  the  relationship 
25:1283:61503:14:14:89:524:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:between user-friendliness and concessions is considerably tighter among SSOs located in 
25:1284:61591:14:14:89:240:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:classes with many other SSOs. 
25:1285:61621:14:14:89:92:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3: 
25:1286:61621:14:13:89:524:308:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:This work leaves a number of questions unexplored. One of the most intriguing of these
