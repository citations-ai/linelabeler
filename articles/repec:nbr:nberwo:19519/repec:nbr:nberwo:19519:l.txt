2:30:1567:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:This paper provides a data-driven overview of the different online platforms that consumers use to
2:31:1665:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:search for books and booksellers, and documents how the use of these platforms is shifting over time.
2:32:1766:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:Our data suggest that, as a result of digitization, consumers are increasingly conducting searches for
2:33:1868:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:books at retailer sites and closed systems (e.g., the Kindle and Nook) rather than at general search
2:34:1968:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:engines (e.g., Google or Bing). We also highlight a number of challenges that will make it difficult
2:35:2068:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:for researchers to accurately measure internet-based search behavior in the years to come. Finally,
2:36:2167:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:we highlight a number of open agenda items related to the pricing of books and other digital media,
2:37:2266:14:42:72:250:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:as well as consumer search behavior.

3:47:2467:0:34:72:185:709:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:1    Introduction
3:48:2484:34:23:72:540:675:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The internet has had a profound impact on the way people shop; online sales in the U.S. were $213
3:49:2581:23:23:72:539:652:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:billion in 2012, accounting for 8 percent of all retail sales.1The internet and digitization have had
3:50:2682:23:23:72:540:629:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:an even greater impact on sales of media products, thanks in part to changes in the way people
3:51:2776:23:23:72:540:606:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:search  for,  acquire,  and  consume  these  products.   Online  sales  of  books  accounted  for  about  44
3:52:2884:23:23:72:539:583:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:percent of all U.S. book sales in 2012, with e-books accounting for 11 percent of total book sales.2
3:53:2984:23:23:72:452:560:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:Digital sales of music accounted for over half of the industry’s 2012 total sales.3
3:54:3067:23:24:88:539:537:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:This  chapter  focuses  on  how  the  internet  and  digitization  are  changing  the  way  consumers
3:55:3168:24:23:72:540:513:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:obtain information about media products such as books, music, and movies.  Less than two decades
3:56:3264:23:23:72:540:490:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ago, a consumer looking for a book, CD, or DVD had to spend considerable time searching among
3:57:3357:23:23:72:540:467:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sellers of these physical products.  Given search technologies at the time (e.g., using a telephone to
3:58:3459:23:23:72:540:444:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:call different sellers or traveling from one physical store to another), the typical consumer limited
3:59:3560:23:23:72:540:421:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:purchase decisions to retailers proximate to his or her domicile.  The internet and digitization have
3:60:3661:23:23:72:540:398:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:reduced consumers’ costs of obtaining information, thus making it easier for consumers to identify
3:61:3759:23:23:72:332:375:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and purchase media that best match their preferences.
3:62:3812:23:23:88:539:352:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Leading media platforms (e.g.,  Netflix,  Amazon,  and iTunes) now provide users with recom-
3:63:3904:23:23:72:540:329:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mendations  for  specific  media  titles  based  on  sophisticated  algorithms  that  account  for  a  given
3:64:4012:23:23:72:540:306:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:user’s preferences as well as the ratings provided by other users.  Consumers also receive recom-
3:65:4109:23:23:72:540:283:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mendations through social networks such as Facebook; “friends” can indicate whether they “liked”
3:66:4205:23:23:72:540:260:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a particular song,  movie,  or book.  Many of these recommendation systems operate in real-time
3:67:4300:23:23:72:540:237:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and use purchase patterns of consumers with similar profiles to identify products consumers would
3:68:4397:23:23:72:190:214:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:be otherwise unaware of.
3:69:4421:23:23:88:539:191:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Additionally,  advances  in  search  technologies  have  made  it  easier  for  consumers  to  directly
3:70:4524:23:23:72:540:168:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:access information that is relevant for their purchase decisions.  Consumers can easily search for
3:71:4622:23:23:72:540:145:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:product information by using a general search engine (e.g., Google), a price comparison site (e.g.,
3:72:4721:23:25:72:540:122:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Bookfinder),  as  well  as  by  navigating  to  a  specific  retailer’s  site  and  conducting  a  search  on  its

4:77:5063:23:24:72:540:686:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:find a greater breadth of products and make the long tail more accessible; it is now easier to find
4:78:5162:24:23:72:540:662:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:rare and obscure books, music, and movies.  And thanks to digitization, consumers can now view
4:79:5256:23:23:72:540:639:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:samples  of  book  pages,  listen  to  sample  music  tracks,  and  watch  scenes  from  movies  through  a
4:80:5363:23:23:72:540:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:plethora of devices connected to the internet.  In short, finding the “right” product now takes less
4:81:5463:23:23:72:474:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:effort, and it is easier to compare the prices different sellers charge for that product.
4:82:5552:23:23:88:539:570:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:This paper is motivated by more recent changes in the way consumers search for media prod-
4:83:5642:23:23:72:540:547:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:ucts.  Until recently, most online product searches for media were conducted using browser-based
4:84:5738:23:23:72:540:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:platforms.   Increasingly,  however,  searches  for  digital  media  take  place  on  closed  platforms  that
4:85:5847:23:23:72:540:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sell music and video content (e.g., iTunes) or books (e.g., the Amazon Kindle and Barnes & Noble
4:86:5943:23:23:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Nook).  This shift is more mature in the music industry; digital content accounted for 37 percent
4:87:6040:23:23:72:534:455:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of music sales in 2012—more than three times the share of digital books among total book sales.
4:88:6135:23:23:88:539:432:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Because  digital  books  are  still  in  their  infancy,  the  remainder  of  this  chapter  focuses  on  the
4:89:6244:23:23:72:540:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:impact of the internet and digitization on the book industry.  Our goal is to provide readers with a
4:90:6344:23:23:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:glimpse of how searches for books are likely to evolve over the next decade and to highlight some
4:91:6441:23:23:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of the challenges and questions that researchers working in this area are likely to encounter in the
4:92:6541:23:23:72:540:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:years to come.  Nonetheless, many of the issues that we discuss are relevant for media such as music
4:93:6641:23:23:72:540:317:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and videos, as well as non-media products that consumers may search for and purchase online.  We
4:94:6737:23:23:72:540:294:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:highlight a number of data limitations and technical challenges associated with identifying product
4:95:6836:23:23:72:540:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and  product-related  searches  on  browser-based  platforms  (e.g.,  search  engines,  price  comparison
4:96:6941:23:23:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sites, and retail websites), as well as closed systems (e.g., applications, or apps, on smartphones
4:97:7040:23:23:72:540:225:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and  tablets  such  as  the  iPad,  and  platforms  such  as  the  Kindle  and  Nook).   Finally  we  provide
4:98:7149:23:23:72:540:202:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:some preliminary evidence that searchers are shifting toward new and evolving search platforms
4:99:7243:23:23:72:450:179:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and away from browser-based platforms (such as search engines) to find books.
4:100:7320:23:23:88:539:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:As  alluded  to  above,  the  book  industry  is  a  useful  one  to  examine  because  it  has  already
4:101:7424:23:23:72:540:133:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:felt  significant  changes  as  a  result  of  the  internet  and  is  likely  to  experience  additional  changes
4:102:7538:23:23:72:540:110:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:over the next decade as a result of digitization.  Even though e-books are still in their infancy, this
4:103:7641:23:0:72:540:87:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:technology allows consumers to locate, purchase, and read books virtually anywhere.  The challenge
5:104:7740:0:23:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for researchers over the next decade is that this activity increasingly occurs on closed systems where
5:105:7842:23:24:72:432:686:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:search activity is not readily observable by those “outside” of the platform.
5:106:7919:24:23:88:539:662:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Our chapter is related to a vast literature on consumer search behavior that began with Stigler’s
5:107:8016:23:23:72:540:639:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(1961)  seminal  article  on  the  economics  of  information.   Subsequent  literature  has  focused  on
5:108:8121:23:23:72:540:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:explaining price dispersion as an equilibrium phenomenon—particularly in online markets where
5:109:8214:23:23:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:informational  frictions  are  very  modest.4The  more  recent  literature  is  decidedly  empirical  and
5:110:8319:23:23:72:540:570:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:examines how industry characteristics, such as search costs, impact levels of price dispersion.  For
5:111:8419:23:23:72:540:547:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:instance,  at the beginning of the millennium a large number of studies examined the effects the
5:112:8515:23:23:72:540:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:internet on prices and price dispersion.5Several of these studies focused specifically on the online
5:113:8615:23:23:72:540:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:book industry.  Clay, Krishnan, and Wolff (2001) examined prices at online bookstores and found
5:114:8710:23:23:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that heightened competition among sellers led to lower prices and less price dispersion.  Moreover,
5:115:8809:23:23:72:540:455:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:they established heterogeneity in firm-level behavior.  Brynjolfsson, Hu, and Smith (2003) quantify
5:116:8908:23:23:72:540:432:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the  economic  impact  of  increased  variety  at  online  bookstores  (and  the  ability  of  consumers  to
5:117:9016:23:23:72:540:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:identify books in the long tail).  Their   estimates indicate that online markets for books increased
5:118:9117:23:23:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:consumer welfare by as much as $1 billion for the year 2000.  Chevalier and Goolsbee (2003) show

5:123:9601:23:23:72:540:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:their methods to books sold online.  Forman, Ghose, and Goldfarb (2009) provide powerful evidence
5:124:9698:23:23:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that online and offline markets for books are linked:  When a physical book store opens, consumers

6:136:10774:23:23:72:540:639:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:engines are beginning to decline.  Specifically, consumers appear to be shifting away from general
6:137:10872:23:23:72:540:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:search engines and are increasingly using retailer sites and closed systems to find books.  Section

6:141:11266:23:34:72:492:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in Section 6 by briefly describing several additional agenda items for research programs.
6:142:11355:34:34:72:317:490:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:2    Overview of the Book Industry
6:143:11389:34:23:72:540:456:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:The  book  industry  has  seen  many  changes  throughout  the  past  20  years.   The  most  significant
6:144:11494:23:23:72:540:433:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:change,  to  date,  has  been  the  move  from  selling  physical  books  in  traditional  brick-and-mortar
6:145:11601:23:23:72:540:410:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:bookstores to selling physical books online.  Books were one of the first products that were success-
6:146:11702:23:23:72:540:387:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:fully sold online.  One of the earliest and largest online retailers, Amazon.com, started as an online
6:147:11804:23:23:72:540:364:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:bookstore in July 1995.  Barnesandnoble.com was launched in May 1997.  Many startups followed,
6:148:11898:23:23:72:540:341:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and existing brick-and-mortar bookstores began creating an online presence.  Most of these online
6:149:11995:23:23:72:540:318:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:bookstores (retailers such as 1bookstreet.com, A1books, and Fatbrain.com) no longer exist; many
6:150:12090:23:23:72:540:295:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:went bankrupt during the collapse of the internet bubble shortly after the new millennium began.
6:151:12186:23:23:72:540:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Borders, which was one of the largest brick-and-mortar bookstores in the U.S., went bankrupt in
6:152:12281:23:23:72:540:249:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:2011.  Today, the retail book industry consists of Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and smaller bookstores
6:153:12378:23:23:72:514:226:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:as well as mass-merchants (such as Walmart) which typically have thinner offerings of titles.
6:154:12471:23:23:88:539:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:A  more  recent  change  in  the  book  industry  is  the  shift  toward  electronic  books,  or  e-books.
6:155:12577:23:23:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Although e-books have been around since at least 1971, when Michael Hart made the Declaration

6:158:12868:23:36:72:540:111:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:marked the beginning of the recent surge in popularity of e-books.6The Sony LIBRI ́e was the first

7:161:13133:23:24:72:540:686:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:experience and required less battery power than existing e-readers at the time.  Amazon released
7:162:13229:24:23:72:540:662:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:its E Ink technology-based Kindle in November 2007.  Barnes & Noble followed in November 2009
7:163:13322:23:23:72:540:639:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with the release of the Nook.  At the end of June 2012, Amazon led the market for devices used
7:164:13416:23:23:72:540:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for reading e-books, with an overall market share of 55 percent (with its Kindle and Kindle Fire),
7:165:13514:23:23:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:followed by Nook (14 percent).  Today, Sony’s e-book readers have 1 percent of the market.7The
7:166:13608:23:23:72:540:570:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:definition of an e-reader is increasingly blurred by the presence of devices such as tablets, smart
7:167:13707:23:23:72:540:547:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:phones, desktops, and laptops with apps for reading e-books.  Indeed, after having seen dramatic
7:168:13803:23:23:72:540:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:growth since 2006, the sales of traditional e-readers are expected to decline in 2012, with consumers
7:169:13904:23:23:72:186:501:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:shifting toward tablets.8
7:170:13929:23:23:88:539:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The sales of e-books have grown alongside the increasing popularity of e-readers.  By July 2010,
7:171:14025:23:23:71:539:455:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Amazon was selling more Kindle books than hardcover books, and since April 2011 it is selling more
7:172:14123:23:23:71:539:432:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Kindle books than hardcover and paperback books combined (excluding free e-books).9However,
7:173:14214:23:23:71:539:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:as shown in Table 1, the overall increase in e-book sales revenue was very modest between 2006
7:174:14308:23:23:71:539:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and 2009.  Between 2009 and 2012, however, sales of e-books grew from 2.8 percent to 11 percent
7:175:14403:23:23:71:178:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of total industry sales.
7:176:14427:23:23:88:539:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Most e-readers support the open ePub format (Amazon’s Kindle, which supports the proprietary
7:177:14519:23:23:71:539:317:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:AZW format, is a notable exception).  In theory, this means consumers can buy an e-book at one
7:178:14613:23:23:71:539:294:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of  the  bookstores  that  supports  the  ePub  format  and  read  it  on  a  different  e-reader.   However,
7:179:14722:23:23:71:539:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:bookstores  use  Digital  Rights  Management  (DRM)  to  protect  the  content  of  the  e-books,  and
7:180:14824:23:23:71:539:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:different bookstores do not necessarily use the same DRM standard.  Even though there are ways
7:181:14918:23:23:71:539:225:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to get around this (for instance, by stripping the DRM), for most consumers this is difficult to do.
7:182:15018:23:23:71:539:202:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:This  means  that  in  practice  the  e-book  market  has  many  characteristics  of  a  two-sided  market,
7:183:15125:23:23:71:539:179:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with publishers on one side of the market, readers on the other side, and bookstores and e-readers

8:190:15648:0:23:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:e-books are less likely to use web browsers to find and purchase books, as it is often more convenient
8:191:15750:23:24:72:540:686:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to search within the device that is used to read e-books.  Moreover, the lack of interchangeability
8:192:15849:24:23:72:540:662:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:due to DRM makes it less beneficial for consumers to compare prices across bookstores or platforms,
8:193:15948:23:23:72:540:639:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:resulting in fewer retailers being visited. Unfortunately, we do not observe consumer search patterns
8:194:16049:23:23:72:540:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:within most of the (closed) platforms, and future researchers are likely to increasingly experience
8:195:16148:23:23:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:this problem not only for searches for books, but searches for any product that take place through
8:196:16246:23:23:72:540:570:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a closed device or mobile device app.  Our challenge here is to attempt to tease out—from available
8:197:16345:23:23:72:540:547:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:data on brower-based searches—evidence of shifts toward searches on platforms or devices for which
8:198:16443:23:23:72:540:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:search data are unavailable.  Thus, the remainder of this chapter focuses exclusively on browser-
8:199:16540:23:23:72:144:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:based searches.
8:200:16555:23:23:88:539:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:These developments—the move toward selling books online as well the transition to e-books—
8:201:16645:23:23:72:540:455:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:have  significantly  impacted  the  sales  of  books  at  traditional  brick-and-mortar  stores.   Figure  1
8:202:16753:23:23:72:540:432:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:shows that average monthly sales at brick-and-mortar bookstores roughly doubled between 1992
8:203:16845:23:23:72:540:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and 2007.  Since 2007, however, sales at traditional bookstores have been in decline.  This decline
8:204:16944:23:23:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in the sales of physical books coincides with two events, making it difficult to separately identify
8:205:17044:23:23:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the  impact  of  the  decline.   One  event  was  a  recession,  which  according  to  the  NBER  started  in
8:206:17153:23:23:72:540:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:December 2007 and ended in June 2009.  The other event was Amazon’s introduction of the Kindle
8:207:17247:23:23:72:540:317:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:e-book reader in November 2007.  While we view the cause of this decline as an interesting and open
8:208:17346:23:23:72:540:294:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:question, the data in Table 2 suggest that the post-2007 decline in sales at traditional bookstores
8:209:17445:23:23:72:540:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:may,  in part,  be due to a shift toward e-books and the online channel more generally.  Between
8:210:17541:23:23:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:2007 and 2009, the sales of the leading online bookstores in Table 2 all increased in absolute terms.
8:211:17642:23:35:88:333:225:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:With this brief background, we now turn to search.
8:212:17692:35:33:72:354:190:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:3    Searching for Books and Booksellers
8:213:17732:33:23:72:540:157:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:There  are  numerous  ways  consumers  can  use  the  internet  to  search  for  books  or  a  bookseller.
8:214:17838:23:23:72:540:134:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Consumers can use a general search engine such as Google, Yahoo, or Bing to search for a specific
8:215:17935:23:23:72:540:111:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:book title, author name, or other book-related search term.  When using a search engine, search
8:216:18030:23:0:72:540:88:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:results  typically appear  as links  that can  be clicked,  which  redirect the  user  to  a  specific  (often
9:217:18141:0:23:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:external)  website.   Most  of  the  general  search  engines  display  both  paid  and  non-paid  (organic)
9:218:18249:23:24:72:512:686:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:results; paid results typically appear on top of the search results page as well as on the side.
9:219:18345:24:23:88:539:662:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:An alternative way to search is by using a price comparison site to identify sellers of a particular
9:220:18445:23:23:72:540:639:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:book.  Price comparison sites are intermediaries that provide consumers with price information as
9:221:18542:23:23:72:539:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:well  as  other  product  information.11Most  price  comparison  sites  are  free  for  consumers  to  use
9:222:18648:23:23:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:while retailers pay fees.  Typically, these fees are paid each time a searcher clicks a link at the price
9:223:18753:23:23:72:540:570:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:comparison site that directs the user to the retailer’s site.  Most comparison sites allow users to
9:224:18852:23:23:72:540:547:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:either  browse  or  use  a  search  box  to  search.   Consumers  searching  for  books  can  choose  among
9:225:18959:23:23:72:540:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:many different comparison sites, ranging from general price comparison sites such as Nextag and
9:226:19054:23:23:72:540:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Bing Shopper, to book-specific comparison sites such as Booksprice.com or Bookfinder.com.  The
9:227:19148:23:23:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:more book-oriented price comparison sites typically allow users to search by ISBN as well as title
9:228:19246:23:23:72:149:455:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:or author name.
9:229:19261:23:23:88:539:432:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:A third option is to go directly to a bookseller’s (or other retailer’s) website and conduct a search
9:230:19362:23:23:72:540:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:within its site.  Most online bookstores allow consumers to search by title, author name, or ISBN.
9:231:19460:23:23:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Online bookstores such as Amazon and Barnes & Noble also list links to best-sellers prominently on
9:232:19558:23:23:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:their webpages, allowing consumers to explore product offerings without having to use the search
9:233:19654:23:23:72:540:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:box.  Suggestions based on previous purchases or items previously viewed are typically displayed as
9:234:19753:23:23:72:540:317:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:well, which is meant to help the consumer find the right book.  Some online booksellers also allow
9:235:19851:23:23:72:540:294:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:third-party sellers to sell books on their websites (e.g., Amazon Marketplace and Barnes & Noble
9:236:19947:23:23:72:534:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Marketplace), which allows consumers to do a price comparison without having to leave the site.
9:237:20042:23:23:88:539:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:As we noted earlier, an increasingly attractive fourth option—especially for those searching for
9:238:20138:23:23:72:540:225:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:e-books—is to conduct a search on a closed device such as Amazon’s Kindle or the Barnes & Noble
9:239:20233:23:23:72:434:202:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Nook.  Recall that these search data are not readily available to researchers.
9:240:20311:23:23:88:539:179:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The remainder of this section examines the relative importance of the first three types of book
9:241:20406:23:23:72:540:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:searches and highlights a number of obstacles that make it difficult to precisely measure the share
9:242:20505:23:23:72:540:133:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of book searches that are conducted on different search platforms.  Later, we will attempt to use
9:243:20602:23:24:72:540:110:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the data that are available to examine whether recent trends in general search engine use suggest
9:244:20699:24:14:83:539:86:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:11See Moraga-Gonz ́alez and Wildenbeest (2012) for a discussion on comparison sites and their implications for
9:245:20809:14:0:72:145:72:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:price competition.
10:246:20828:0:23:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that consumers are indeed shifting to closed search platforms, for which detailed search data are
10:247:20925:23:30:72:175:686:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:presently unavailable.
10:248:20947:30:30:72:400:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:3.1    Book-Related Searches on General Search Engines
10:249:21001:30:23:72:540:626:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We first turn to the issue of measuring the number of book-related searches on the main general
10:250:21096:23:23:72:540:603:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:search engines (Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Ask).  For this we make use comScore’s Search Planner
10:251:21190:23:23:72:540:580:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:data, which is based on the browsing activity of two million U.S. users that are part of the comScore
10:252:21291:23:23:72:540:557:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:panel.  As part of this data we observe the most popular search terms used at the main general
10:253:21385:23:23:72:540:534:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:search  engines  to  reach  a  specific  site.   To  illustrate  the  nature  of  the  data,  Table  3  shows  the
10:254:21499:23:23:72:540:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:top 25 search terms on Google that resulted in organic traffic to Barnes & Noble.12The number
10:255:21592:23:23:72:540:488:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:one search phrase is “barnes and noble,” which generated 376,670 clicks to this site.  Notice that
10:256:21690:23:23:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:several other top 25 search terms in Table 3 are variations or misspellings of the site name or URL
10:257:21789:23:23:72:540:442:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(e.g., “barnes and nobles,” “barnes,” “bn,” and “www.bn.com”). This suggests that searchers may
10:258:21884:23:23:72:540:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:frequently use general search engines as a shortcut for typing in the URL of the site they wish to
10:259:21982:23:23:72:540:396:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:visit, and then conduct actual searches for books at the site.  Also notice that the list of top 25
10:260:22081:23:23:72:540:373:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:search terms includes competitors (e.g., “amazon”).  Farther down the list we begin seeing terms
10:261:22177:23:23:72:450:350:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:related to specific books (e.g., the 20th ranked search term is “the vow book”).
10:262:22257:23:23:88:539:327:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Table 3 also illustrates a weakness of the Search Planner data:  For privacy and other reasons,
10:263:22352:23:23:72:540:304:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:comScore sometimes reports “***” and “name name” rather than the actual search phrase.  This
10:264:22444:23:23:72:540:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is the case for the 4th and 6th ranked search terms in Table 3, and as a consequence, one cannot
10:265:22540:23:23:72:540:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:precisely determine the nature of these searches.  For purposes of the analysis that follows, these
10:266:22639:23:23:72:540:235:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:terms are ignored.  This is not ideal, since these unknown (and hence excluded) searches may refer
10:267:22737:23:23:72:218:212:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to an author or ISBN number.
10:268:22765:23:23:88:539:189:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:In order to get a better picture of the nature of search terms leading users from search engines
10:269:22861:23:23:72:540:166:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:to  bookstores,  we  examined  the  entire  list  of  search  terms  resulting  in  traffic  to  Amazon  and
10:270:22969:23:24:72:540:143:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Barnes & Noble (2,053 and 180 search terms, respectively), and grouped them into 5 categories:
10:271:23063:24:22:72:539:119:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(1)Site Name, which includes the name or URL (including misspellings) of the site, (2)Non-Book,
10:272:23158:22:15:83:539:97:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:12In September 2011, Barnes & Noble acquired Borders’ intellectual property, including Borders’ domain name.
10:273:23266:15:10:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:Borders.com now redirects to barnesandnoble.com, explaining the relatively large number of Borders’ related search
10:274:23380:10:0:72:141:72:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:terms in Table 3.
11:275:23398:0:23:72:539:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:which includes products other than books,  (3)Book,  which includes physical as well as e-books,
11:276:23494:23:24:71:539:686:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f6:B:(4)E-reader,  which  includes  searches  for  e-reader  related  hardware  or  software,  and  (5)Other
11:277:23597:24:23:72:540:662:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f2:B:Bookstore,  which  includes  names  and  URLs  of  other  bookstores  (including  misspellings).   The
11:278:23699:23:23:72:540:639:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:results  are  displayed  in  Figures  2(a)  and  2(b),  and  provide  a  breakdown  of  the  observed  search
11:279:23808:23:23:72:540:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:terms consumers entered at the main search engines that resulted in clicks to Amazon and Barnes
11:280:23903:23:23:72:176:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:& Noble, respectively.
11:281:23925:23:23:88:539:570:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Several features of Figure 2 are worth noting.  First, the overwhelming majority of searches at
11:282:24020:23:23:72:540:547:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the main search engines leading users to Amazon or Barnes & Noble were navigational searches,
11:283:24113:23:23:72:540:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:i.e., search terms that only include the name or URL of the retailer.  This means that most of the
11:284:24211:23:23:72:540:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:traffic Amazon and Barnes & Noble receive from the main search engines is from consumers using
11:285:24305:23:23:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:search engines instead of the address bar to navigate.  Presumably, users conduct specific searches
11:286:24404:23:23:72:319:455:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for books once they land on these booksellers’ sites.
11:287:24457:23:23:88:539:432:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Second, notice in Figure 2(a) that non-book related searches generate more traffic to Amazon
11:288:24549:23:23:72:540:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:than book related searches.  This is consistent with the fact that Amazon is now a mass-merchant
11:289:24645:23:23:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that  sells  many  products  other  than  books.   Figure  2(b)  shows  that  book-related  search  terms
11:290:24750:23:23:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:generate far more traffic to Barnes & Noble than non-book related search terms.  This is consistent
11:291:24849:23:23:72:540:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:with the fact that Barnes & Noble specializes in books.  Finally, Figure 2 reveals that searches for
11:292:24949:23:23:72:540:317:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:e-readers and other bookstores are more important for Barnes & Noble than Amazon in generating
11:293:25043:23:23:72:540:294:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:traffic to its site.  The key takeaway from Figure 2 is that navigational searches account for much
11:294:25142:23:23:72:470:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of the traffic that Amazon and Barnes & Noble obtain from general search engines.
11:295:25223:23:23:88:539:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We conclude this section with a caveat that is related to another drawback of the Search Planner
11:296:25319:23:23:72:540:225:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:data used in our analysis:  comScore reports search terms leading users to a particular site only
11:297:25416:23:23:72:540:202:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:if the number of clicks exceeds a certain threshold.  Thus, while we do observe the most popular
11:298:25512:23:23:72:540:179:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:search terms generating traffic to a specific bookstore, we do not observe the more obscure searches
11:299:25612:23:23:72:540:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:taking place on general search engines.  For instance, for Amazon we only observe the search terms
11:300:25710:23:23:72:540:133:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:corresponding  to  24  percent  of  total  click  volume.   Brynjolfsson,  Hu,  and  Simester  (2011)  have
11:301:25817:23:23:72:540:110:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:shown that internet markets have increased the importance of niche markets in terms of sales.  This
11:302:25916:23:0:72:540:87:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:long tail phenomenon suggests that a portion of the unobserved searches may include searches for
12:303:26014:0:23:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:book titles and other more obscure book-related search terms.  If this is the case,  Figure 2 may
12:304:26111:23:24:72:540:686:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:understate the relative importance of book-related searches on search engines.  The importance of
12:305:26208:24:29:72:392:662:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the long tail for book sales and searches remains an open question.
12:306:26275:29:30:72:284:633:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:3.2    Incoming and Outgoing Traffic
12:307:26311:30:23:72:540:603:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Search engines are not the only way consumers reach a bookseller’s site.  Consumers may directly
12:308:26407:23:23:72:540:580:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:visit the site, be referred from another site (such as a price comparison site), and so on.  Likewise,
12:309:26509:23:23:72:540:557:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:consumers that visit a bookseller’s site may simply be gathering information before visiting another
12:310:26609:23:23:72:540:534:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:site to compare prices or make a purchase.  This section examines these patterns of incoming and
12:311:26705:23:29:72:148:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:outgoing traffic.
12:312:26722:29:30:72:295:482:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:C:3.2.1  How Searchers Reach Booksellers
12:313:26760:30:23:72:540:452:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:To better understand how searchers actually reach the websites of different online booksellers, we
12:314:26858:23:23:72:540:429:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:analyze incoming traffic to five of the leading online bookstores in the U.S. (Amazon,  Barnes &
12:315:26954:23:23:72:540:406:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Noble, Books-a-Million, Ecampus, and Powells).  In addition to observing the most popular search
12:316:27050:23:23:72:540:383:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:terms for these retailers, comScore’s Search Planner data allows us to observe which sites get clicks
12:317:27151:23:23:72:540:360:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for specific searches conducted at the main search engines as well as the source of incoming and
12:318:27247:23:23:72:297:337:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the destination of outgoing traffic for each site.
12:319:27297:23:23:88:539:314:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The results summarized in Table 4 show the percentages of visitors to these online bookstores
12:320:27390:23:23:72:540:291:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in August 2012, categorized by the most important referring sites or platforms.  For example, 27.8
12:321:27488:23:23:72:540:268:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:percent of Amazon’s traffic is due to direct logins, i.e., consumers directly navigating to its site.
12:322:27589:23:23:72:540:245:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Amazon received 40.2 percent of its traffic through Google, 5.9 percent through Yahoo, and 15.1
12:323:27684:23:23:72:540:222:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:percent through Bing.  As shown in Figure 2(a),  most of this traffic stemmed from navigational
12:324:27779:23:23:72:540:199:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:searches, which are effectively a shortcut for direct logins.  Finally, 3.9 percent of Amazon’s traffic

12:326:27966:23:23:88:539:153:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:More broadly, Table 4 shows that there is considerable heterogeneity in the sources of traffic for
12:327:28064:23:23:72:540:130:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:different booksellers.  Amazon and Barnes & Noble receive much more traffic through direct logins
12:328:28161:23:23:72:540:107:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:than  Ecampus.com,  Powell’s,  and  Books-a-Million.   This  may  stem  from  the  fact  that  Amazon
12:329:28262:23:0:72:540:84:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and Barnes & Noble are better known brands; see Baye, De los Santos, and Wildenbeest (2012).
13:330:28356:0:23:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Powell’s and Books-a-Million rely more heavily on general search engines to receive traffic, while
13:331:28454:23:24:72:540:686:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:referrals from other bookstores are relatively important for Barnes & Noble, Ecampus, and Books-
13:332:28550:24:23:72:539:662:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:A-Million.13Finally, Amazon receives a far greater share of its traffic from price comparison sites
13:333:28649:23:28:72:215:639:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:than do the other booksellers.

13:335:28731:30:23:72:540:581:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:To identify what happens after having visited an online bookseller, we analyze the outgoing traffic
13:336:28830:23:24:72:540:558:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:from the bookstores using comScore’s Search Planner data.  The results are summarized in Table
13:337:28924:24:23:72:540:534:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:5, using data from August 2012 for Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Ecampus.com, Powell’s, and Books-
13:338:29016:23:23:72:120:511:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:A-Million.
13:339:29026:23:23:88:539:488:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:First, note that a searcher that terminates his or her search activity after visiting a bookseller
13:340:29124:23:23:72:540:465:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:is  more  likely  to  have  consummated  a  purchase  than  is  a  searcher  that  does  not  terminate  but
13:341:29232:23:23:72:540:442:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:instead visits another bookseller or a price comparison site.  Table 5 shows that 43 percent of users
13:342:29333:23:23:72:540:419:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:that visited Amazon terminated their search by logging off; this share is much lower for the other
13:343:29431:23:23:72:376:396:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:bookstores, especially for Ecampus.com, which was 5.7 percent.
13:344:29493:23:23:88:539:373:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Second, note that consumers that choose to leave one bookstore and visit another bookstore may
13:345:29587:23:23:72:540:350:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:be doing so because the book was not in stock or was priced above their reservation price.  Table 5
13:346:29686:23:23:72:540:327:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:shows that only 4.2 percent of visitors to Amazon chose to visit another bookstore after searching
13:347:29784:23:23:72:540:304:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:there.  This is significantly lower than for the other bookstores in our sample;  for example,  38.7
13:348:29884:23:23:72:540:281:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:percent of Barnes & Noble visitors and 79.5 percent of Ecampus visitors chose to search another
13:349:29979:23:23:72:287:258:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:bookstore immediately after visiting the site.
13:350:30025:23:23:88:539:235:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Finally,  consumers may visit a bookseller with the intent of free riding on the general infor-
13:351:30120:23:23:72:540:212:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:mation,  reviews,  or  recommendations  it  provides,  and  then  leave  the  bookseller’s  site  to  search
13:352:30228:23:23:72:540:189:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for the best available price.  As shown in Table 5, 2.9 percent of Amazon visitors directly visit a
13:353:30327:23:23:72:540:166:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:price comparison site after viewing pages at Amazon.  Visits to price comparison sites comprise a
13:354:30424:23:46:72:425:143:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:negligible share of outgoing traffic for the other booksellers in our sample.
13:355:30501:46:15:83:539:97:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:13The other bookstores category includes Abe-books.com, Alibris.com, Amazon.com, Audible.com, Barnesandno-

14:359:30866:31:23:72:540:678:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:As discussed earlier, general search engines are not the only way consumers can search for books.
14:360:30963:23:23:72:540:655:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Consumers can search the websites of booksellers and other retailers, as well price comparison sites.
14:361:31064:23:23:72:540:632:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In light of the fact that major booksellers receive a considerable share of their traffic from direct
14:362:31165:23:23:72:540:609:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:logins  and  navigational  searches,  one  would  expect  the  number  of  searches  on  these  sites  to  be
14:363:31274:23:23:72:540:586:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:substantial.  Unfortunately,  comScore does not provide information about the keywords used for
14:364:31369:23:23:72:540:563:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:searches “inside” these retailers.  Nonetheless, limited information is available through the qSearch
14:365:31470:23:23:72:117:540:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:database.
14:366:31479:23:23:88:539:517:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The qSearch data are based on the comScore panel, which contains all of the browsing activity of
14:367:31575:23:23:72:540:494:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:about two million users in the U.S. It contains monthly data on searches conducted by consumers
14:368:31670:23:23:72:539:471:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on  the  internet.14These  searches  include  searches  through  traditional  search  boxes  as  well  as
14:369:31775:23:23:71:539:448:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:toolbars and widgets.  The qSearch database includes the actual search volume and search intensity
14:370:31873:23:23:71:539:425:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:at over 200 online properties, including Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and several other book-oriented
14:371:31969:23:23:71:539:402:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:platforms.  Unlike Search Planner, the data indicate the total number of searches on each site rather
14:372:32070:23:23:71:539:379:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:than a breakdown of searches by keyword.  Thus, one cannot distinguish between searches for books
14:373:32167:23:23:71:286:356:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:versus other products with the qSearch data.
14:374:32211:23:23:88:539:333:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Table  6  provides  a  snapshot  (February,  2012)  of  the  total  number  of  searches  conducted  on
14:375:32314:23:23:71:539:310:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the five largest book-oriented sites that are tracked by the qSearch database.  Amazon processed
14:376:32410:23:23:71:539:287:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the majority of searches among the bookstores, having almost ten times as many searches as the
14:377:32504:23:23:71:539:264:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:number two bookstore, Barnes & Noble.  In terms of total searches, a smaller number of searches
14:378:32599:23:23:71:539:241:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:were conducted on the price comparison site (Bookfinder).  The level of search activity is even more
14:379:32699:23:23:71:422:218:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:skewed toward Amazon when one measures searches using search visits.15
14:380:32769:23:23:88:539:195:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 3 shows the evolution of searches between January 2011 and February 2013 for these

14:382:32961:31:15:83:539:141:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:14According to comScore’s qSearch documentation, a search is defined as:  (1) a user interaction where the user
14:383:33072:15:11:72:540:126:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:is presented with a search result page that contains results that match the consumer’s search intent; (2) the search
14:384:33188:11:11:72:540:115:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:result page allows the user to refine or change their search parameters; and (3) the search can be initiated from a
14:385:33303:11:7:72:380:104:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:drop down menu or by clicking a link, as long as first two rules are satisfied.
14:386:33382:7:15:83:539:97:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:15According to comScore’s qSearch documentation, a search visit is a session in which a user conducted one or
14:387:33491:15:10:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:more searches.  If searches are conducted at different points during the day,  with more than 30 minutes of search
14:388:33605:10:0:72:305:72:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:inactivity at the site, they count as multiple search visits.
15:389:33668:0:23:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Noble, there is seasonality in searches during the holiday shopping season, with searches increasing
15:390:33768:23:24:72:540:686:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sharply near the end of the calendar year.  Searches at Barnes & Noble appear to have peaked near
15:391:33865:24:23:72:540:662:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the end of 2011, while searches at Amazon have generally increased, with the exception of the most
15:392:33963:23:23:72:162:639:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:recent few months.
15:393:33981:23:23:88:539:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We emphasize that the qSearch data displayed in Figure 3 does not indicate how many of the
15:394:34071:23:23:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:searches  at  these  book-oriented  platforms  are,  in  fact,  book  related.   While  this  is  not  so  much
15:395:34182:23:23:72:540:570:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:an issue for sites that specialize in books (such as Barnes & Noble, Bookfinder, and Google Book
15:396:34278:23:23:72:540:547:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Search), it is clearly an issue for Amazon.  While Amazon began its life as an online bookstore, it
15:397:34377:23:23:72:540:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:has evolved into a mass merchant where over 53 percent of its 2009 revenues derived from products
15:398:34474:23:23:72:540:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:outside  the  book  category.   And  today,  Amazon  is  itself  a  platform  that  services  thousands  of
15:399:34581:23:23:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Amazon  Marketplace  sellers.   Similarly,  these  data  do  not  permit  us  to  measure  book-related
15:400:34684:23:23:72:540:455:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:searches  at  retailers  such  as  Walmart  or  on  platforms  such  as  eBay  (which  received  more  than
15:401:34791:23:34:72:330:432:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:twice as many searches as Amazon in February 2012).

15:403:34884:34:23:72:540:364:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:This section provides a look at how searches for books on search engines evolve during a window
15:404:34979:23:23:72:540:341:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:around the release date of the book and also explores how the shifts toward other platforms have
15:405:35075:23:29:72:355:318:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:impacted book-related searches at the main search engines.

15:407:35186:30:23:72:540:259:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Since  our  comScore  database  only  contains  information  about  searches  for  specific  book-related
15:408:35291:23:23:72:540:236:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:keywords on a monthly basis for the 2010-2012 period, our strategy is to combine these data with
15:409:35387:23:24:72:461:213:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:data from Google Trends to create a dataset that runs from 2004 through 2013.16
15:410:35466:24:23:88:539:189:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:For a given search term, Google Trends provides a measure of the number of searches for that
15:411:35558:23:23:71:539:166:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:term between 2004 and 2013.  The measure is relative:  the maximum number of searches within
15:412:35650:23:46:71:539:143:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the period is normalized to 100.  To illustrate, Figure 4 displays search volume reported by Google
15:413:35749:46:15:83:539:97:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:16Choi and Varian (2012) described how Google Trends data can help to predict economic time series of interest.
15:414:35860:15:10:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:Google  Trend  data  has  been  used  in  epidemiology  to  detect  influenza  epidemics  (Ginsberg  et  al.,  2009)  and  in
15:415:35985:10:0:72:504:72:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:economics to predict the unemployment rate (D’Amuri and Marcucci, 2010) and inflation (Guzman, 2011).

16:417:36180:23:24:72:540:686:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:gives the seasonally adjusted trend.  The figure shows search volume has been rising for the term
16:418:36277:24:23:72:540:662:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:“Amazon,” with the growth in search volume accelerating after July 2010.  Figure 5 displays the
16:419:36372:23:23:72:540:639:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:relative search volume over time for “Amazon” and “Barnes and Noble” in a single graph.  The
16:420:36464:23:23:72:540:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:number of search queries for Barnes & Noble was relatively stable up to 2010, after which searches
16:421:36562:23:23:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:went up quickly.  However, searches at Barnes & Noble peaked near the end of 2011, whereas the
16:422:36656:23:23:72:267:570:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:search volume for Amazon kept growing.
16:423:36694:23:23:88:539:547:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Since the Google Trends measure of search is relative, the relative position of the two lines in
16:424:36790:23:23:72:540:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Figure 5 is uninformative: It would be erroneous to infer that Barnes & Noble had more navigational
16:425:36889:23:23:72:540:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:searches than Amazon for the 2004-2012 period.  Our strategy for overcoming this limitation is to
16:426:36986:23:23:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:use information about the actual number of searches for a given search term in comScore to convert

16:428:37179:23:23:88:539:432:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Figure 6 provides one example of the utility of combining Google Trends and comScore data.

16:430:37367:23:23:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:“e-book,” “ereader,” and “sony ebook reader.”  By combining the data, we not only obtain a time
16:431:37462:23:23:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:series dating back to 2004, but the resulting numbers of searches are cardinal so the different graphs
16:432:37564:23:23:72:540:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:may be compared.  Figure 6 illustrates that searches for “kindle” took off in January 2008, and the
16:433:37663:23:23:72:540:317:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:number of searches for the Kindle has exceeded that for the Nook every year since.  Notice that the
16:434:37762:23:23:72:540:294:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:recent decline in searches for these two e-readers is consistent with our earlier remarks regarding
16:435:37861:23:29:72:540:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the projected decline in post-2012 e-reader sales as consumers switch to tablets and other devices.
16:436:37960:29:30:72:261:242:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:4.2    Searches for Specific Titles
16:437:37995:30:23:72:540:212:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:We are now in a position to take a deeper dive into searches for books on search engines and to
16:438:38090:23:23:72:540:189:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:examine how search patterns are evolving over time.  We use the Search Planner data for a sample
16:439:38186:23:36:72:540:166:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of 735 books to study how the number of clicks on Google changes throughout a book’s life cycle.
16:440:38282:36:11:83:293:130:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:?:17We limit search volume to the United States only.
16:441:38333:11:15:83:539:119:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:18Google Trends allows a comparison of up to 5 search terms.  Nevertheless, the relative search volume of more
16:442:38443:15:11:72:540:104:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:than 5 search terms can be obtained by running multiple Google Trends comparisons, with each comparison having
16:443:38553:11:11:72:540:93:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:at least one search term that is common across all comparisons.  The comScore (or similar) data is nonetheless still
16:444:38669:11:10:72:540:82:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:needed to pin down the level of searches.  Also notice that searches according to the comScore data by definition lead
16:445:38787:10:0:72:462:72:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:to a click to a bookstore, whereas a search according to Google Trends may not result in a click.
17:446:38886:0:23:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Our  sample  includes  titles  released  in  every  year  since  2003,  but  roughly  half  of  the  sample  is
17:447:38997:23:24:72:540:686:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:composed of books released in 2012.  The search queries we use to obtain the clicks on Google are
17:448:39094:24:23:72:540:662:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the exact titles of the book in our sample.  In addition to clicks, we observe book characteristics
17:449:39193:23:23:72:540:639:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:such as ISBN, list price, publisher, date of publication, format (hardcover or paperback), number
17:450:39290:23:23:72:540:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of pages, edition (e.g., first or reprint), dimension, and weight.  Moreover, for 2012 we have daily
17:451:39390:23:23:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:observations of a book’s price as well as availability at each of the leading online bookstores.19For
17:452:39491:23:23:71:539:570:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Amazon we also observe a book’s customer rating,  number of customer reviews,  and sales rank.
17:453:39585:23:23:71:539:547:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Most books in our sample are first editions; the vast majority are New York Times Bestsellers that
17:454:39683:23:23:71:224:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:came out during 2011 and 2012.
17:455:39713:23:23:88:539:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The Search Planner data has two limitations.  A first limitation is that we only observe clicks
17:456:39808:23:23:71:539:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for the period between February 2010 and February 2013.  Secondly, we only observe clicks if they
17:457:39905:23:23:71:539:455:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:exceed  a  certain  threshold.   To  deal  with  these  two  matters,  we  supplement  the  Search  Planner
17:458:40012:23:23:71:539:432:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:data with Google Trends data,  as discussed above.  For each book in our sample we use Google
17:459:40105:23:23:71:539:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Trends to capture the volume of search queries that users enter into Google when searching for the
17:460:40203:23:23:71:539:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:title of a book.20Since Google Trends only gives a relative measure of search volume, we convert
17:461:40299:23:23:71:539:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the index to actual levels of search volume by setting the maximum value of the index during the
17:462:40395:23:23:71:539:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:period between February 2010 and February 2013 equal to the corresponding clicks according to
17:463:40488:23:23:71:146:317:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Search Planner.
17:464:40503:23:23:88:539:294:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Figure  7  gives  an  example  for  the  book  “The  End  of  Illness”  by  David  B.  Agus,  which  was
17:465:40607:23:23:71:539:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:released on January 17,  2012.  Searches on Google for this title start relatively high,  but within
17:466:40707:23:23:71:539:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a  few  months  after  the  release  date  decay  to  relatively  low  levels.   Also  shown  in  this  graph  is
17:467:40820:23:23:71:539:225:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Amazon’s sales rank for this title, which shows a reverse pattern.  This illustrates that sales rank is
17:468:40923:23:23:71:539:202:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:actually inversely related to the number of searches.  It is an open question whether this is a result
17:469:41025:23:23:71:539:179:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of lags in Amazon’s construction of sales rank or whether this means that, during the life cycle of
17:470:41124:23:23:71:539:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a book, consumers increasingly visit Amazon’s site directly to purchase the book rather than using
17:471:41222:23:25:71:184:133:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a general search engine.
17:472:41246:25:15:83:539:108:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:19These  are  Amazon.com,  Barnesandnoble.com,  Booksamillion.com,  Walmart.com,  Powells.com,  and  Ecam-

17:474:41426:7:14:83:540:86:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:F:20We use exact phrases (exact words in quotes), e.g.,“Gone girl”instead ofGone girl.  We limit search volume to
17:475:41537:14:0:72:165:72:9:g_d0_f5:9:g_d0_f5:F:the United States only.
18:476:41562:0:23:88:539:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The  pattern  for  this  particular  title  is  fairly  representative  of  the  other  titles  in  our  sample.
18:477:41674:23:24:72:540:686:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:In particular, we ran a linear regression of the total number of searches for each book title in our
18:478:41774:24:23:72:540:662:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sample on a constant and a set of dummies that represent months since release.  The underlying
18:479:41868:23:23:72:540:639:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:regression results for various specifications are shown in Table 7.  For the specification in column
18:480:41968:23:23:72:540:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:(1), which includes book fixed effects to control for heterogeneity among books, most of the month-
18:481:42067:23:23:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:since-release coefficients are significantly different from zero at conventional levels.  Figure 8 plots
18:482:42171:23:23:72:540:570:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the predicted values of each of the dummies using the parameter estimates for specification (1).
18:483:42267:23:23:72:540:547:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:This figure shows that the patterns of search observed around the release window for “The End of
18:484:42363:23:23:72:540:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Illness” (see Figure 7) is typical of newly released books:  Search activity tends to be high in the
18:485:42463:23:23:72:399:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:first few months, but then quickly drops to significantly lower levels.
18:486:42534:23:23:88:539:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Column (2) of Table 7 is a specification that includes book characteristics rather than book fixed
18:487:42632:23:23:72:540:455:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:effects.  Although this reduces the fit of the model and the significance of some of the months-since-
18:488:42734:23:23:72:540:432:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:release dummies, the magnitude of the coefficients is similar to that in the first specification.  Most
18:489:42837:23:23:72:540:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:book characteristic variables have parameter estimates that are significantly different from zero.
18:490:42935:23:23:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:There is less search for first edition books than for books in later editions.  This may stem from
18:491:43033:23:23:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the fact that later editions are only published if the book is popular.  There are more searches for
18:492:43133:23:23:72:540:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:paperbacks than hardcover books in our sample, and again this may reflect the fact that paperbacks
18:493:43231:23:23:72:540:317:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are targeted to the masses and therefore result in more searches.  The final column of Table 7 adds
18:494:43330:23:23:72:540:294:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a linear and quadratic time trend to control for possible changes in search behavior between 2004
18:495:43427:23:23:72:540:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and 2013.  Both coefficients are highly significant, suggesting that (controlling for changes in search
18:496:43530:23:23:72:540:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:behavior around release windows, edition, format, and so on) the number of book searches at search
18:497:43628:23:23:72:163:225:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:engines is evolving.
18:498:43648:23:23:88:539:202:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:To more clearly see the implied evolution of searches for books over time, Figure 9 plots the
18:499:43741:23:23:72:540:179:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:number  of  searches  predicted  by  the  model  for  each  year  in  our  sample.   This  plot  shows  that
18:500:43849:23:23:72:540:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:searches per book on Google increased between 2003 and 2007, but since then have declined.  This
18:501:43945:23:23:72:540:133:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:predicted pattern is consistent with our view that searchers are shifting away from using general
18:502:44042:23:23:72:540:110:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:search engines to find books, and are increasingly (1) visiting online bookstores (such as Amazon
18:503:44139:23:0:72:540:87:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and Barnes & Noble) to conduct searches, and (2) searching within closed systems (e.g., Kindle or
19:504:44238:0:23:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Nook) to purchase books.  Thus,  while we cannot directly measure book related searches within
19:505:44332:23:24:72:540:686:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:these alternative search platforms, the observable data from search engines is consistent with this
19:506:44431:24:23:72:125:662:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:hypothesis.
19:507:44442:23:23:88:539:639:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We conclude by noting that the pattern in Figure 9 is also consistent with the trend in average
19:508:44537:23:23:72:540:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:monthly retail sales for bricks-and-mortar bookstores, as shown in Figure 1, and may reflect the
19:509:44633:23:23:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:same structural changes in the book industry that have led to a decline in the sales of physical
19:510:44729:23:23:72:540:570:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:books at traditional bookstores.  For instance, the decline coincides with the increasing popularity
19:511:44829:23:23:72:540:547:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of e-readers shown earlier in Figure 6, the general shift toward e-books, and the rising prominence
19:512:44928:23:34:72:401:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of Amazon as a platform for searching for books and other products.
19:513:44995:34:34:72:181:490:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:5    Book Prices
19:514:45011:34:23:72:540:456:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Another open question is how changes in search technologies and behavior have impacted the prices
19:515:45108:23:23:72:539:433:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of physical and digital books.A priori, it is not clear how these prices should evolve over time.  In
19:516:45209:23:23:72:540:410:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the short run, intermediaries may use penetration pricing in an attempt to induce consumers to
19:517:45303:23:23:72:540:387:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:switch from buying printed books to e-books.  Once the market is more mature, and a sufficient
19:518:45397:23:23:72:540:364:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:number of consumers is locked into a specific platform, firms may find it optimal to increase prices.
19:519:45498:23:23:72:540:341:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Sales of physical and digital books are also likely to be related.  Hu and Smith (2013) use a natural
19:520:45599:23:23:72:540:318:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:experiment  to  analyze  the  effect  of  e-book  availability  on  sales  of  physical  books  and  find  that
19:521:45710:23:23:72:428:295:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:delayed e-book availability results in a large decrease in total e-book sales.
19:522:45788:23:23:88:539:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:We analyze book prices using a large dataset of daily prices collected using a scraper written in
19:523:45885:23:23:72:540:249:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Java.  The dataset contains daily price information throughout 2012 for physical books as well as e-
19:524:45985:23:23:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:books sold at Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and Books-A-Million, physical books sold at Ecampus.com,
19:525:46079:23:23:72:540:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Powell’s  Books,  and  Walmart,  and  e-books  sold  at  Kobo  and  Google.   In  addition  to  prices  we
19:526:46185:23:23:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:observe  availability  and  several  book  characteristics  such  as  the  publisher,  format  (hardcover  or
19:527:46294:23:23:72:366:157:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:paperback), edition, number of pages, weight, and dimension.
19:528:46354:23:23:88:539:134:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Figure  10  shows  the  kernel  estimates  of  the  price  densities  for  hardcover  books,  paperbacks,
19:529:46459:23:23:72:540:111:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and e-books.  The prices used are average prices across books within format and across bookstores,
19:530:46557:23:0:72:540:88:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:so the variation reflects changes over time.  E-books are on average less expensive than hardcover

20:532:46708:23:24:88:539:686:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The relationship between publishers and retailers complicates the analysis of prices for e-books.
20:533:46805:24:23:72:540:662:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Traditionally,  books were sold using a wholesale model:  a publisher sells a book to a retailer at
20:534:46904:23:23:72:540:639:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a wholesale price,  which is typically half the list price for the book.  The retailer is then free to
20:535:47006:23:23:72:540:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:sell the book at whatever price it wants.  Initially this model was used by all players for selling
20:536:47105:23:23:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:e-books  as  well.   However,  to  foster  e-book  sales,  Amazon  began  heavily  discounting  popular  e-
20:537:47212:23:23:72:540:570:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:books, selling them for $9.99—a price that is below the wholesale price of many physical books.
20:538:47307:23:23:72:540:547:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Publishers, fearing that e-books would cannibalize sales of printed books and that consumers would
20:539:47405:23:23:72:540:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:grow accustomed to low e-book prices, were concerned about the low e-book prices.  When Apple
20:540:47498:23:23:72:540:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:launched its iBookstore in April 2010,  five of the “big six” publishers (HarperCollins,  Hachette,
20:541:47597:23:23:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Macmillan,  Penguin,  and  Simon  &  Schuster)  adopted  Apple’s  newly  developed  agency  model.
20:542:47695:23:23:72:540:455:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Under the agency model the retailer receives a fixed percentage of the book’s sales price (typically
20:543:47795:23:23:72:540:432:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:30 percent).  Moreover, under the agency model, the retail price is no longer set by the retailer but
20:544:47896:23:23:72:540:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:set by the publisher.  Other online bookstores reached similar agreements with the publishers.  As
20:545:47994:23:23:72:540:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a reaction to these developments, the Department of Justice sued Apple and the five publishers on
20:546:48091:23:23:72:413:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:April 12, 2012, alleging that they conspired to fix the prices of e-books.
20:547:48165:23:23:88:539:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Table 8 provides descriptive statistics for the prices of books in our sample.  The table makes
20:548:48260:23:23:72:540:317:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a distinction between e-books that are sold under the agency model and those that are sold under
20:549:48356:23:23:72:540:294:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the wholesale model.  Average prices are generally higher for the agency model e-books and show
20:550:48451:23:23:72:137:271:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:less variation.
20:551:48466:23:23:88:539:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Figure  11 plots  the  average  prices  of paperbacks,  e-books  sold  under the  agency  model,  and
20:552:48567:23:23:72:539:225:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:e-books  sold  under  the  wholesale  model  across  bookstores.21Even  though  the  DOJ  reached  a
20:553:48667:23:23:72:540:202:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:settlement with three of the publishers in April 2012 (HarperCollins, Hachette, and Macmillan),
20:554:48762:23:23:72:540:179:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and as part of the settlement e-book retailers are allowed to discount e-book titles,  prices for e-
20:555:48862:23:23:72:540:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:books sold under the wholesale model increased shortly after the lawsuit was announced.  The steep
20:556:48960:23:23:72:540:133:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:decline in e-book prices sold under the wholesale model a few months later coincides with the final
20:557:49059:23:35:72:540:110:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:approval of the settlement between the DOJ and the three publishers, with HarperCollins books
20:558:49152:35:0:83:388:75:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f5:?:21Since we do not have sales data, average prices are not weighted by sales.
21:559:49230:0:23:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:starting to be discounted on Amazon soon after (Hachette and Simon & Schuster discounting began
21:560:49325:23:24:72:165:686:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in December 2012).
21:561:49343:24:23:88:539:662:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:One might wonder whether the evolution of search has impacted the degree of price dispersion
21:562:49435:23:23:72:540:639:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for  books.   One  standard  measure  of  disperson  is  the  coefficient  of  variation—the  ratio  of  the
21:563:49543:23:23:72:540:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:standard deviation  in the  prices different  sellers charge for a  given  book  divided  by  the average
21:564:49648:23:23:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:price sellers charge for that book.  Since this measure is homogeneous of degree zero in the level
21:565:49746:23:23:72:540:570:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of prices, one can average these coefficients of variation across all books in our sample to obtain
21:566:49845:23:23:72:540:547:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:a useful summary statistic for the level of price dispersion.  Figure 12 plots the average coefficient
21:567:49947:23:23:72:540:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:of  variation  over  time  for  the  three  book  formats  in  our  sample.   Notice  that  the  coefficient  of
21:568:50059:23:23:72:540:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:variation is highest for e-books sold under the wholesale model,  lower for paperback books,  and
21:569:50156:23:23:72:540:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:lowest for e-books sold under the agency model.  Additionally, note that the coefficient of variation
21:570:50257:23:23:72:540:455:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:for e-books sold under the wholesale model declined significantly after the e-book settlement, while
21:571:50357:23:23:72:540:432:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the coefficient of variation for e-books sold under the agency model increased slightly.  In contrast,
21:572:50459:23:23:72:513:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the coefficient of variation for paperbacks was relatively stable throughout the entire period.
21:573:50554:23:23:88:539:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:The  underlying  reasons  for  these  changes  in  prices  and  levels  of  price  dispersion  remains  an
21:574:50660:23:23:72:540:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:open  question.   We  note  that  the  two  remaining  publishers  (Macmillan  and  Penguin)  settled  in
21:575:50765:23:34:72:540:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:early 2013, so this event is unlikely to be the driver of the patterns observed in Figures 11 and 12.
21:576:50866:34:34:72:244:306:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:C:6    Concluding Remarks
21:577:50889:34:23:72:540:272:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:Our initial look at the evolution of platforms through which consumers search for, purchase, and
21:578:50985:23:23:72:540:249:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:read books highlights a number of issues that should be on the agenda of those interested in digital
21:579:51085:23:23:72:540:226:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:media and other products sold online.  There are a variety of different platforms where consumers
21:580:51182:23:23:72:540:203:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:can search for books, including online bookstores (such as Barnes & Noble), mass merchants (Ama-
21:581:51278:23:23:72:540:180:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:zon), and price comparison sites (Bookfinder).  While data suggest that consumers are increasingly
21:582:51376:23:23:72:540:157:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:conducting  searches  on  closed  systems  (such  as  e-readers)  and  retailer  platforms  (such  as  Ama-
21:583:51483:23:23:72:540:134:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:zon), measurement of these trends is difficult.  In contrast to these platforms, data on the types of
21:584:51584:23:23:72:344:111:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:searches conducted on search engines is readily available.
21:585:51642:23:0:88:539:88:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:While  Amazon  and  Barnes  &  Noble  get  significant  numbers  of  visits  from  those  conducting
22:586:51744:0:23:72:540:709:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:searches  on  Google  and  Bing,  most  of  the  observed  searches  are  navigational  ones—situations
22:587:51847:23:24:72:540:686:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:in  which  users  query  a  search  engine  as  a  shortcut  for  navigating  to  the  site  of  the  bookseller
22:588:51959:24:23:72:540:662:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:where actual product searches are performed.  Navigational searches to these top booksellers have
22:589:52056:23:23:72:540:639:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:steadily  increased  going  back  to  2004.   The  number  of  browser-based  searches  on  book-related
22:590:52160:23:23:72:540:616:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:platforms such as Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Bookfinder, and Google Books is sizable, but it is an
22:591:52255:23:23:72:540:593:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:open question whether browser-based searches on these platforms will continue to grow.  Indeed,
22:592:52350:23:23:72:540:570:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:our preliminary analysis of searches for book titles on Google suggests a declining trend in book
22:593:52447:23:23:72:540:547:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:searches since 2007.  While these patterns are consistent with shifts toward non-browser searches
22:594:52544:23:23:72:540:524:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:on closed platforms, including smartphone and tablet apps, additional research is required to reach
22:595:52643:23:23:72:196:501:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:any definitive conclusions.
22:596:52670:23:23:88:539:478:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Another open agenda item is the importance of the long tail for product searches in general
22:597:52761:23:23:72:540:455:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:and more specifically for book searches.  The search terms corresponding to long-tail searches at
22:598:52858:23:23:72:540:432:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:the major search engines are not observed in comScore data because of low search volume; we do
22:599:52952:23:23:72:540:409:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:not observe niche searches, which presumably take place in the long tail.  Additional research will
22:600:53051:23:23:72:237:386:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:be needed to analyze the long tail.
22:601:53086:23:23:88:539:363:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:An interesting new area of research has emerged relating to e-books.  We have identified several
22:602:53182:23:23:72:540:340:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:new developments with respect to pricing strategies of publishers and booksellers and have provided
22:603:53281:23:23:72:540:317:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:some preliminary findings on how some of these developments have influenced book prices.  More
22:604:53375:23:23:72:540:294:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:research will be needed on how different selling formats (e.g.,  the agency and wholesale models)
22:605:53472:23:23:72:470:271:11:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:affect pricing more generally, from both a theoretical and empirical point of view.22
22:606:53557:23:23:88:539:248:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, note that we have completely side-stepped the first-order question of what consumers
22:607:53650:23:23:72:540:225:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:are seeking when they conduct searches for books, digital media, or (more broadly) other products.
22:608:53748:23:23:72:540:202:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:More  bluntly,  this  chapter  says  nothing  about  whether  consumers  are  searching  for  information
22:609:53853:23:23:72:540:179:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:about the best book to read or information about the best prices available.  Future research that
22:610:53950:23:70:72:502:156:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f2:B:unpacks these and other motives for search would be a valuable addition to the literature.
