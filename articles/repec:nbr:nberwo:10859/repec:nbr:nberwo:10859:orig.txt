2:21:902:31:24:71:539:592:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This article provides an empirical investigation of the determinants of terrorism at the country level.
2:22:1005:24:24:71:539:568:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:In contrast with the previous literature on this subject, which focuses on transnational terrorism only,
2:23:1109:24:24:71:539:544:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:I use a new measure of terrorism that encompasses both domestic and transnational terrorism. In line
2:24:1209:24:24:71:539:520:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:with the results of some recent studies, this article shows that terrorist risk is not significantly higher
2:25:1316:24:24:71:539:496:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:for poorer countries, once the effects of other country-specific characteristics such as the level of
2:26:1417:24:24:71:539:472:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:political freedom are taken into account. Political freedom is shown to explain terrorism, but it does
2:27:1519:24:24:71:539:448:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:so in a non-monotonic way: countries in some intermediate range of political freedom are shown to
2:28:1616:24:24:71:539:424:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:be more prone to terrorism than countries with high levels of political freedom or countries with
2:29:1713:24:24:71:539:400:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:highly authoritarian regimes. This result suggests that, as experienced recently in Iraq and previously
2:30:1816:24:24:71:539:376:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:in Spain and Russia, transitions from an authoritarian regime to a democracy may be accompanied
2:31:1911:24:24:71:539:352:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:by temporary increases in terrorism. Finally, the results suggest that geographic factors are important
2:32:2014:24:31:71:207:328:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to sustain terrorist activities.

3:39:2167:0:27:255:355:690:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:i.  Introduction
3:40:2183:27:22:74:534:663:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:After the 9/11 attacks, much of the political and media debate on terrorism has focused
3:41:2270:22:22:74:534:641:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:on prevention policies. The widespread view that poverty creates terrorism has dominated
3:42:2358:22:21:74:534:619:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:much of this debate (see, for example, Kahn and Weiner, 2002). This is hardly surprising.
3:43:2447:21:22:74:534:598:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:After all, the notion that poverty generates terrorism is consistent with the results of most
3:44:2540:22:22:74:534:576:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of the existing literature on the economics of conflicts. In particular, the results in Alesina
3:45:2635:22:21:74:534:554:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:et al (1996) suggest that poor economic conditions increase the probability of political
3:46:2723:21:22:74:534:533:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:coups. Collier and Hoeffer (2004) show that economic variables are powerful predictors of
3:47:2812:22:22:74:534:511:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:civil war, while political variables have low explanatory power. Miguel, Satyanath, and
3:48:2899:22:21:74:534:489:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Sergenti (2004) show that, for a sample of African countries, negative exogenous shocks in
3:49:2989:21:22:74:534:468:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:economic growth increase the likelihood of civil conflict. Because terrorism is a manifesta-
3:50:3081:22:22:74:534:446:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tion of political conflict, these results seem to indicate that poverty and adverse economic
3:51:3173:22:21:74:381:424:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:conditions may play an important role explaining terrorism.
3:52:3232:21:22:92:535:403:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:However, recent empirical studies have challenged the view that poverty creates terror-
3:53:3319:22:22:74:534:381:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ism. Using U.S. State Department data on transnational terrorist attacks, Krueger and
3:54:3404:22:21:74:534:359:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Laitin (2003) and Piazza (2004) find no evidence suggesting that poverty may generate ter-
3:55:3494:21:22:74:534:338:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:rorism. In particular, the results in Krueger and Laitin (2003) suggest that among countries
3:56:3586:22:22:74:534:316:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:with similar levels of civil liberties, poor countries do not generate more terrorism than rich
3:57:3681:22:21:74:535:294:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:countries. Conversely, among countries with similar levels of civil liberties, richer countries
3:58:3776:21:22:74:401:273:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:seem to be preferred targets for transnational terrorist attacks.1
3:59:3842:22:22:92:535:251:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:While the results in Krueger and Laitin (2003) and Piazza (2004) are extremely sug-
3:60:3925:22:21:74:534:229:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:gestive, these studies may suffer, in principle, from some potential shortcomings. First of
3:61:4016:21:22:74:534:208:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:all, the U.S. State Department data covers only events of international terrorism, that is,
3:62:4107:22:22:74:534:186:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:those that involve citizens or property of more than one country. However, international
3:63:4195:22:21:74:534:164:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:terrorism represents only a small fraction of terrorist activity. For example, for the year
3:64:4286:21:18:74:534:143:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:2003, the MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base reports 1,536 events of domestic terrorism,
3:65:4369:18:16:88:535:125:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:1In addition, for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict Krueger and Maleˆckov ́a (2003) show that participants
3:66:4474:16:12:74:535:109:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:in politically motivated violence tend to originate, if anywhere, from relatively affluent sectors of the
3:67:4579:12:0:74:124:97:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:population.
4:68:4591:0:22:74:534:690:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:but only 240 events of international terrorism.2The difference between reported domes-
4:69:4677:22:22:74:534:668:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tic and international terrorist events in the MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base is large, in
4:70:4765:22:21:74:534:646:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:spite of the probable fact that international terrorist incidents tend to have more visibility.
4:71:4860:21:22:74:534:625:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:While it is clearly interesting to elucidate the impact of potential policy interventions on
4:72:4952:22:22:74:534:603:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the level of international terrorism, the effects of such policies on the overall amount of
4:73:5043:22:21:74:534:581:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:terrorism, both domestic and of foreign origin is of obvious importance too. However, the
4:74:5132:21:22:74:534:560:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:identity of the determinants of international terrorism is not necessarily informative about
4:75:5224:22:22:74:534:538:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the identity of the determinants of domestic terrorism. Much of modern-day transnational
4:76:5312:22:21:74:534:516:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:terrorism seems to generate from grievances against rich countries. In addition, in some
4:77:5400:21:22:74:534:495:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:cases terrorist groups may decide to attack property or nationals of rich countries in order
4:78:5492:22:22:74:535:473:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to gain international publicity. As a result, transnational terrorism may predominantly
4:79:5579:22:21:74:535:451:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:affect rich countries. The same is not necessarily true for domestic terrorism.3Second,
4:80:5666:21:22:74:534:430:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the adequacy of the U.S. State Department data to measure terrorism has been recently
4:81:5751:22:22:74:534:408:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:under attack. Krueger and Laitin (2004) have questioned the quality of this dataset on the
4:82:5841:22:21:74:535:386:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:basis of the ambiguity of the definitions used for the variables in the dataset and the lack
4:83:5933:21:22:74:535:365:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of transparency of the process through which this dataset is assembled.4Finally, because
4:84:6021:22:22:74:534:343:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:terrorism may in turn affect economic prosperity (see, e.g., Abadie and Gardeazabal, 2003;
4:85:6111:22:21:74:534:321:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Frey, Luechinger and Stutzer, 2004; Sandler and Enders, 2005) the observed correlation
4:86:6197:21:22:74:534:300:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:between terrorism and national income cannot be interpreted as a measure of the magni-
4:87:6283:22:22:74:534:278:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tude of the effect of economic variables on terrorism. Because terrorism adversely affects
4:88:6373:22:21:74:535:256:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:economic prosperity, ordinary regression estimates of the effect of economic development
4:89:6461:21:22:74:534:235:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:on terrorism are biased downwards. Therefore, the estimates in Krueger and Laitin (2003)
4:90:6549:22:22:74:535:213:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and Piazza (2004) can be interpreted as a lower bound on the effect of economic prosperity
4:91:6639:22:17:74:516:191:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:on terrorism. The magnitude of that effect is not identified in an ordinary regression.5
4:92:6727:17:12:88:285:174:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:2See MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base, 2004.
4:93:6768:12:16:88:535:162:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:3Sandler (2003) describes the differences in terms of motivation and targets between international and
4:94:6870:16:8:74:158:146:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:domestic terrorism.
4:95:6889:8:16:88:535:138:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:4Subsequently, Secretary Powell admitted errors and omissions in the construction of the State Depart-
4:96:6991:16:8:74:247:122:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:ment terrorism data. See Eggen (2004).

4:98:7131:16:0:74:293:98:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:between economic growth and political instability.
5:99:7182:0:22:92:535:690:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:As in the Krueger and Laitin (2003) and Piazza (2003) articles mentioned above, most
5:100:7266:22:22:74:534:668:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:studies on the causes and effects of terrorism have relied on measures of terrorist casualties
5:101:7360:22:21:74:534:646:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:or terrorist incidents as proxies for the level of terrorist risk. Frey (2004) and others have re-
5:102:7458:21:22:74:534:625:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:cently questioned the quality and adequacy of the available data on terrorist casualties and
5:103:7550:22:22:74:534:603:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:incidents. In this article, I use a new dataset on the intensity of country-level terrorist risk
5:104:7646:22:21:74:534:581:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to study the linkages between terrorism and economic and political variables. The measure
5:105:7735:21:22:74:534:560:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of terrorism intensity used in this article comes from country-level ratings on terrorist risk
5:106:7829:22:22:74:535:538:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:from an international risk rating agency. Risk ratings are used by international investors
5:107:7919:22:21:74:534:516:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to evaluate specific types of country risks. Terrorist risk ratings have obvious limitations.
5:108:8012:21:22:74:535:495:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:They provide only a summary measure of an intrinsically complex phenomenon. However,
5:109:8096:22:22:74:535:473:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:they have the advantage of reflecting directly the total amount of terrorist risk for every
5:110:8187:22:21:74:534:451:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:country in the world. To my knowledge, this article represents the first attempt to measure
5:111:8278:21:22:74:342:430:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the determinants of terrorism using risk rating data.
5:112:8331:22:22:92:535:408:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The analysis of risk rating data presented in this article validates the findings in Krueger
5:113:8423:22:21:74:534:386:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and Laitin (2003) and Piazza (2004) and produces a number of new results. The empirical
5:114:8510:21:22:74:534:365:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:results reported below show that terrorist risk is not significantly higher for poorer coun-
5:115:8602:22:22:74:534:343:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tries, once the effects of other country-specific characteristics such as the level of political
5:116:8698:22:21:74:534:321:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:freedom are taken into account. In contrast with the results for civil wars in Collier and
5:117:8788:21:22:74:534:300:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Hoeffler (2004), lack of political freedom is shown to explain terrorism, and it does so in a
5:118:8881:22:22:74:534:278:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:non-monotonic way. Countries with intermediate levels of political freedom are shown to
5:119:8968:22:21:74:534:256:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:be more prone to terrorism than countries with high levels of political freedom or countries
5:120:9060:21:22:74:534:235:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:with highly authoritarian regimes. This result suggests that, as experienced recently in
5:121:9148:22:22:74:534:213:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Iraq and previously in Spain and Russia, transitions from an authoritarian regime to a
5:122:9234:22:21:74:534:191:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:democracy may be accompanied by temporary increases in terrorism.6Finally, the results
5:123:9320:21:22:74:534:170:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of this article suggest that geographic factors may be important to sustain terrorism. In
5:124:9409:22:18:74:534:148:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:particular, variables which measure average elevation, tropical weather, and country area
5:125:9498:18:15:88:535:130:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:6In Spain, for example, the number of deaths caused by terrorism increased sharply in the late 1970’s,
5:126:9600:15:12:74:535:115:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:with the beginning of the democratic transition, and decreased gradually afterwards.  See Abadie and
5:127:9700:12:0:74:162:103:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:Gardeazabal (2003).
6:128:9720:0:22:74:534:690:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:are powerful predictors of terrorism. The results obtained using ordinary regression become
6:129:9811:22:22:74:534:668:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:even sharper when instrumental variables methods are used to correct for reverse causation.
6:130:9902:22:21:92:535:646:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The rest of the article is structured as follows.  Sectioniidescribes the data.  The
6:131:9986:21:22:74:535:625:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:results of the empirical analysis are reported in Sectioniii.  Sectionivsummarizes the
6:132:10072:22:36:74:233:603:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:main conclusions of the article.
6:133:10104:36:27:279:331:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:ii.  Data
6:134:10113:27:22:74:534:540:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Table I contains definitions of the variables in the dataset and descriptive statistics. The
6:135:10205:22:21:74:534:518:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:measure of terrorist risk that I use in this article is the World Market Research Center’s
6:136:10295:21:22:74:534:497:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Global Terrorism Index (WMRC-GTI). The WMRC-GTI seems to be the first attempt
6:137:10372:22:22:74:534:475:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:to measure globally the risk from terrorist attacks at a country level. The WMRC-GTI
6:138:10456:22:21:74:534:453:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:assesses the risk of terrorism in 186 countries and against these countries’ interests abroad
6:139:10549:21:22:74:534:432:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:for the period 2003/4. The WMRC-GTI encompasses five factors forecasting motivation,
6:140:10633:22:22:74:535:410:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:presence, scale, efficacy and prevention of terrorism. The potential range of the WMRC-
6:141:10720:22:21:74:460:388:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:GTI is 1-100 with higher values representing higher exposure to terrorism.7
6:142:10795:21:22:92:535:367:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:To measure poverty I use data on country GDP per capita, which comes from World
6:143:10874:22:22:74:534:345:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Bank (2004a). In some regressions, instead of GDP per capita, I use the United Nations
6:144:10960:22:21:74:534:323:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Human Development Index or the country Gini Index. The Human Development Index
6:145:11038:21:22:74:534:302:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:measures the well-being of the inhabitants of a country along three different dimensions:
6:146:11127:22:22:74:534:280:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:health, education, and income.  It is constructed using country data on life expectancy
6:147:11214:22:21:74:534:258:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:at birth, adult literacy and school enrollment ratio, and GDP per capita.  The Human
6:148:11298:21:22:74:534:237:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Development Index has a 0-1 potential range. The Gini Index is a widely-used measure of
6:149:11385:22:22:74:535:215:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:income or consumption inequality. The potential range of the Gini Index is 0-100, a value
6:150:11474:22:22:74:534:193:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of zero meaning perfect equality. Data on the Human Development Index and the Gini
6:151:11556:22:21:74:282:171:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Index come from United Nations (2004).
6:152:11594:21:22:92:535:150:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The measure of (absence of) political freedom is the Freedom House’s Political Rights
6:153:11679:22:22:74:534:128:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Index (Freedom House, 2004). In contrast with Krueger and Laitin (2003), I use a measure
6:154:11767:22:17:74:534:106:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of political rights rather than a measure of civil liberties to describe the political climate
6:155:11861:17:0:88:382:89:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:7See World Market Research Center (2003) for further information.
7:156:11927:0:22:74:534:690:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of a country. The reason is that endogeneity may be a more serious concern for the latter,
7:157:12017:22:22:74:534:668:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:if countries restrict civil liberties in response to terrorism. However, given that these two
7:158:12110:22:21:74:535:646:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:variables are highly colinear, the results of the empirical section do not depend on which
7:159:12200:21:22:74:534:625:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:one is used in the regressions. The Freedom House’s Political Rights Index has a 1-7 range,
7:160:12291:22:22:74:361:603:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:with high values representing absence of political rights.
7:161:12349:22:21:92:535:581:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Indices for linguistic, ethnic, and religious fractionalization come from Alesina et al
7:162:12436:21:22:74:535:560:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:(2003). These indices range between zero and one; they reflect the probability that two
7:163:12523:22:22:74:534:538:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:individuals chosen at random from the same country belong to different linguistic, ethnic,
7:164:12613:22:21:74:172:516:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:or religious groups.
7:165:12633:21:22:92:535:495:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Finally, data on geography and climate come from Gallup, Mellinger, and Sachs (2001).
7:166:12718:22:22:74:534:473:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Geographic variables include measures of country land area, average elevation, fraction of
7:167:12808:22:36:74:332:451:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the country area in tropical climate, and landlock.

7:169:12882:20:27:74:181:395:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:A.  OLS Regressions
7:170:12901:27:21:74:534:368:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In this section, I use country-level data for the period 2003-2004 to estimate the following
7:171:12993:21:34:74:169:347:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:basic specification.
7:172:13013:34:34:160:535:313:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ln(terrorist risk) =α+βln(GDP per capita) +X′γ+ε.(1)
7:173:13065:34:21:74:534:279:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:As explained above, I use the WMRC Global Terrorism Index to measure terrorist risk at
7:174:13151:21:22:74:534:258:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the country level. The vectorXincludes other potential predictors of terrorism such as
7:175:13237:22:22:74:505:236:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:measures of political freedom, fractionalization, and country geography and climate.
7:176:13321:22:21:92:535:214:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Table II, in columns (1)-(6), reports Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimates of the
7:177:13404:21:22:74:535:193:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:coefficients in equation (1).8The coefficient on log GDP per capita in column (1) shows
7:178:13491:22:22:74:534:171:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that a 1% increase in per capita GDP is associated in the data with a .17% reduction in
7:179:13578:22:21:74:534:149:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:terrorism, as measured by the WMRC Global Terrorism Index. Columns (2) and (3) show
7:180:13661:21:18:74:534:128:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:that this negative association decreases but remains significant when the Freedom House’s
7:181:13750:18:16:88:535:110:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:8Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are shown in parentheses. All specifications include regional
7:182:13854:16:0:74:235:94:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:dummies. See table notes for details.
8:183:13892:0:22:74:534:690:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Index of Political Rights is introduced in the regression. The effect of political freedom on
8:184:13985:22:22:74:330:668:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:terrorism is significantly non-linear in column (3).
8:185:14037:22:21:92:535:646:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In column (4), I include in the regression measures of linguistic, ethnic, and religious
8:186:14125:21:22:74:534:625:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:fractionalization. Only the measure of linguistic fractionalization shows a significant as-
8:187:14216:22:22:74:534:603:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:sociation with terrorism:  conditional on income, political freedom, and linguistic frac-
8:188:14305:22:21:74:534:581:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tionalization, ethnic and religious fractionalization are not significantly associated with
8:189:14396:21:22:74:534:560:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:terrorist risk. The association between linguistic fractionalization and terrorism becomes
8:190:14486:22:22:74:534:538:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:even clearer when the other non-significant fractionalization measures are excluded from
8:191:14574:22:21:74:534:516:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:the regression in column (5). In columns (4) and (5), where fractionalization indices are
8:192:14663:21:22:74:534:495:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:included in the regression, the coefficient of log GDP per capita remains negative but it
8:193:14752:22:22:74:461:473:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:becomes statistically indistinguishable from zero at conventional test levels.
8:194:14830:22:21:92:535:451:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:It is well-known that certain geographic characteristics may favor terrorist activities.
8:195:14918:21:22:74:534:430:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:First of all, areas of difficult access offer safe haven to terrorist groups, facilitate training,
8:196:15016:22:22:74:534:408:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and provide funding through other illegal activities, like the production and trafficking
8:197:15105:22:21:74:534:386:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of cocaine and opiates. Failure to eradicate terrorism in some areas of the world has of-
8:198:15194:21:22:74:534:365:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ten been attributed to geographic barriers, like mountainous terrain (e.g., Afghanistan) or
8:199:15285:22:22:74:535:343:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tropical jungle (e.g., Colombia). In addition, large countries tend to generate centrifugal
8:200:15376:22:21:74:534:321:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:pressures, include disaffected minorities, and accumulate grievances.9To control for the
8:201:15464:21:22:74:534:300:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:effect of geographic factors on terrorism, I include in column (6) three additional variables
8:202:15557:22:22:74:534:278:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in the regression: total country area, average elevation, and proportion of the country area
8:203:15649:22:21:74:535:256:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in tropical weather. Because geographic factors are also believed to affect economic devel-
8:204:15740:21:22:74:534:235:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:opment (see, for example Gallup, Sachs, and Mellinger, 1998), it is potentially important to
8:205:15832:22:22:74:534:213:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:correct for the confounding effect of these variables. Once geographic factors are included
8:206:15923:22:21:74:534:191:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:in the regression, the coefficient on per capita GDP decreases below its standard error, in
8:207:16014:21:22:74:150:170:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:absolute value.
8:208:16029:22:22:92:535:148:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:To sum up, the regression results in columns (1) to (6) show that after controlling for
8:209:16116:22:17:74:534:126:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:other country characteristics, including the level of political rights, fractionalization, and
8:210:16210:17:16:88:535:109:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:9See also Fearon and Laitin (2003) and Collier and Hoeffer (2004) for a discussion of how certain
8:211:16307:16:0:74:275:93:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:geographic characteristic may favor civil wars.
9:212:16355:0:22:74:456:690:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:geography, national income is not significantly associated with terrorism.10
9:213:16431:22:22:92:535:668:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Columns (7) and (8) report the coefficients for the same regression as in column (6), but
9:214:16520:22:21:74:534:646:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:this time using the U.N. Human Development Index and the Gini Index, respectively, as
9:215:16605:21:22:74:534:625:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:explanatory variables instead of log per capita GDP. The results show again that once other
9:216:16696:22:22:74:534:603:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:country characteristics are included in the regression, human development and inequality
9:217:16784:22:36:74:480:581:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:do not show a significant correlation with terrorism, at conventional test levels.
9:218:16866:36:27:74:170:545:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f8:B.  IV Regressions
9:219:16884:27:21:74:534:518:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The regression results in the previous section describe correlations between terrorism and
9:220:16974:21:22:74:534:497:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:other country characteristics, such as economic factors. It would be erroneous, however, to
9:221:17065:22:22:74:534:475:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:interpret those correlations as measures of the effect of economic variables on terrorism. Of
9:222:17158:22:21:74:534:453:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:course, the reason is that not only economic factors may cause terrorism, but also terrorism
9:223:17250:21:22:74:236:432:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:may affect economic prosperity.
9:224:17281:22:22:92:535:410:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:In this section, I use variation in country income induced by geographic landlock to
9:225:17365:22:21:74:535:388:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:estimate the effect of country income on terrorism. Landlock (the fraction of a country
9:226:17452:21:22:74:534:367:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:area distant to sea access) has been shown to predict economic growth (see Gallup, Sachs,
9:227:17541:22:22:74:534:345:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:and Mellinger, 2001). The identification assumption adopted in this section is that landlock
9:228:17633:22:21:74:534:323:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:does not cause terrorism directly; that is, landlock is only related to terrorism through its
9:229:17726:21:22:74:534:302:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:effect on national income. If this assumption holds, variation in national income induced by
9:230:17818:22:22:74:534:280:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:country landlock can be treated as exogenous and used to assess the effect of an exogenous
9:231:17908:22:21:74:259:258:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:change in income on terrorism level.
9:232:17944:21:22:92:535:237:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Table III, in columns (1)-(6), reports instrumental variables estimates of the effect of
9:233:18032:22:18:74:534:215:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:national income on terrorism. Qualitative results remain virtually unchanged relative to
9:234:18120:18:16:84:535:197:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:10Besides the results reported here, I estimated additional specifications which included measures of
9:235:18221:16:12:74:535:181:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:other potential determinants of terrorism. In particular, following Fearon and Laitin (2003) and Collier
9:236:18325:12:11:74:535:169:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:and Hoeffer (2004) work on civil conflicts, I included explanatory variables measuring education and the
9:237:18429:11:12:74:535:158:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:proportion of young males in the population. Collier and Hoeffer (2004) argue that education may affect
9:238:18532:12:12:74:535:146:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:political attitudes and increase the opportunity cost of political violence. Fearon and Laitin (2003) hy-
9:239:18637:12:12:74:535:134:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:pothesize that young males may be particularly apt or inclined to engage in political violence. The specific
9:240:18745:12:12:74:535:122:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:measures that I employed were the average years of schooling for adults (World Bank, 2004b) and the pro-
9:241:18849:12:12:74:535:110:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:portion of males aged 15-24 in the population (United Nations, 2003). None of these variables produced
9:242:18951:12:0:74:287:98:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:significant coefficients at conventional test levels.
10:243:19005:0:22:74:534:690:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Table II. However, the magnitude of some of the coefficients change considerably. In con-
10:244:19094:22:22:74:534:668:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:trast with the results in Table II, the instrumental variables coefficient on log per capita
10:245:19186:22:21:74:534:646:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:GDP becomes positive in columns (4)-(6) where the fractionalization and geographic vari-
10:246:19274:21:22:74:534:625:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:ables are included in the regression. Nevertheless, this coefficient remains non-significant
10:247:19366:22:22:74:534:603:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:at conventional test levels. In addition, the magnitude of the coefficients on the political
10:248:19458:22:21:74:534:581:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:freedom variables increases considerably. The results in column (6) show that the effect of
10:249:19549:21:22:74:534:560:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:political variables is significantly non-linear once the effect of geographic factors is taken
10:250:19643:22:22:74:149:538:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:into account.11

10:252:19749:21:22:74:534:495:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:variables evaluated at their means. Over most of the range of the political rights index,
10:253:19838:22:22:74:534:473:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:lower levels of political rights are associated with higher levels of terrorism. However, highly
10:254:19934:22:21:74:534:451:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:authoritarian countries (political rights index equal to 7) experience lower terrorist risk than
10:255:20030:21:22:74:534:430:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:countries in some intermediate range of political rights (political rights index equal to 4-6).
10:256:20125:22:22:74:534:408:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:The non-monotonic nature of the relationship between political rights and terrorism can be
10:257:20215:22:21:74:534:386:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:interpreted in different ways. On the one hand, the repressive practices commonly adopted
10:258:20304:21:22:74:534:365:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:by autocratic regimes to eliminate political dissent may help keeping terrorism at bay.12
10:259:20393:22:22:74:534:343:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:On the other hand, intermediate levels of political freedom are often experienced during
10:260:20481:22:21:74:534:321:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:times of political transitions, when governments are weak, political instability is elevated,
10:261:20574:21:22:74:385:300:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:so conditions are favorable for the appearance of terrorism.13
10:262:20636:22:22:92:535:278:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:As with the OLS regression results in the previous table, column (7) reports the esti-

10:264:20812:21:22:74:534:235:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:of per capita income, as an explanatory variable. The U.N. Human Development Index is
10:265:20897:22:18:74:535:213:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:instrumented also with landlock.14Similar to the results in the previous column, the instru-
10:266:20989:18:15:84:535:195:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:11Similar to the OLS results, measures of education and of the proportion of young males in the popu-
10:267:21090:15:9:74:272:180:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:lation did not produce significant coefficients.
10:268:21138:9:15:84:535:171:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:12The country with the lowest value of the WMRC Global Terrorism Index 2003/4 is North Korea, a
10:269:21233:15:9:74:183:156:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:highly autocratic regime.
10:270:21258:9:12:84:478:147:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:13See Fearon and Laitin (2003) for a discussion of the same issues in relation to civil wars.
10:271:21351:12:15:84:535:135:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:14Table III does not include a specification with the Gini Index treated as an endogenous explanatory
10:272:21452:15:12:74:535:120:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:variable. Arguably, country inequality is affected to a lesser extent by reverse causation than per capita
10:273:21558:12:12:74:535:108:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:GDP or human development. In addition, while landlock is believed to affect per capita income and human
10:274:21661:12:12:74:535:96:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:development, to my knowledge a similar effect has not been documented for inequality. In fact, while the
10:275:21765:12:0:74:535:84:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:landlock variable produces decent first stages for per capita income and human development (with first-

11:278:22010:36:27:212:397:632:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:iv.  Summary and Conclusions
11:279:22038:27:22:74:534:605:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:Using a new dataset on terrorist risk worldwide, I fail to find a significant association be-
11:280:22131:22:21:74:534:583:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:tween terrorism and economic variables such as income once the effect of other country
11:281:22217:21:22:74:534:562:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:characteristics is taken into account. Instrumental variables estimates, which are used to
11:282:22307:22:22:74:534:540:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:correct for reverse causation, produce the same qualitative results.  The estimates sug-
11:283:22395:22:21:74:534:518:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:gest, however, that political freedom has a non-monotonic effect on terrorism. This result
11:284:22485:21:22:74:534:497:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:is consistent with the observed increase in terrorism for countries in transition from au-
11:285:22575:22:22:74:534:475:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:thoritarian regimes to democracies. In addition, the results show that certain geographic
11:286:22664:22:346:74:336:453:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:characteristics may favor the presence of terrorism.

11:288:22822:12:12:74:535:95:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:same is not true for inequality. The first-stage F-statistic on landlock with the Gini Index as the endogenous
11:289:22932:12:0:74:216:83:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:explanatory variable is just 1.22.
