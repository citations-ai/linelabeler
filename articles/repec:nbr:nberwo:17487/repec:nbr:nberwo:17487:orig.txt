3:36:1561:0:30:108:237:692:209:g_d0_f1:209:g_d0_f1:1Introduction
3:37:1574:30:20:108:504:662:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:This paper considers the measurement of human capital.   A generalized framework for
3:38:1658:20:20:108:504:642:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:human capital accounting is developed.  Under this framework, human capital variation
3:39:1743:20:20:108:504:622:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:can play a much bigger role in explaining cross-country income differences than traditional
3:40:1834:20:20:108:504:602:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:accounting exercises suggest. Moreover, in assessing the wealth and poverty of nations, the
3:41:1925:20:19:108:443:582:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:existing conflict between regression and accounting evidence can be resolved.
3:42:2002:19:20:122:503:563:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:To situate this paper,first consider the literature’s standard methods and results, which
3:43:2091:20:20:108:504:543:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:rely on assumptions about (1) the aggregate production function, mapping capital inputs
3:44:2178:20:20:108:504:523:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:into output, and (2) the measurement of capital inputs. The traditional production function
3:45:2269:20:20:108:504:503:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:is Cobb-Douglas. In a seminal paper, Mankiw et al. (1992) used average schooling duration
3:46:2358:20:20:108:504:483:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:to measure human capital and showed its strong correlation with per-capita output (see
3:47:2444:20:19:108:504:463:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Figure 1).  Overall, Mankiw et al.’s regression analysis found that physical and human
3:48:2530:19:20:108:423:444:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:capital variation predicted 80% of the income variation across countries.
3:49:2603:20:20:122:503:424:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:The interpretation of these regressions is not obvious however, given endogeneity con-
3:50:2689:20:20:108:503:404:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:cerns (Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare 1997). To avoid regression’s inference challenges, more
3:51:2778:20:20:108:504:384:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:recent research has emphasized accounting approaches, decomposing output directly into
3:52:2864:20:20:108:504:364:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:its constituent inputs (see, e.g., the review by Caselli 2005).  A key innovation also came
3:53:2955:20:19:108:504:344:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:in measuring human capital stocks, where an economy’s workers were translated into "un-
3:54:3042:19:20:108:504:325:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:skilled worker equivalents", summing up the country’s labor supply with workers weighted
3:55:3130:20:20:108:504:305:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:by their wages relative to the unskilled (Hall and Jones 1999, Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare
3:56:3219:20:20:108:503:285:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:1997).  This method harnesses the standard competitive market assumption where wages
3:57:3303:20:20:108:504:265:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:represent marginal products and uses wage returns to inform the productivity gains from
3:58:3390:20:20:108:504:245:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:human capital investments.  With this approach, the variation in human capital across
3:59:3475:20:20:108:504:225:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:countries appears modest, so that physical and human capital now predict only 30% of the
3:60:3563:20:19:108:504:205:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:income variation across countries (see, e.g., Caselli 2005) — a quite different conclusion than
3:61:3658:19:20:108:198:186:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:regression suggested.
3:62:3679:20:20:122:503:166:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:This paper reconsiders human capital measurement while maintaining neoclassical as-
3:63:3762:20:20:108:504:146:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:sumptions. The analysis continues to use neoclassical mappings between inputs and outputs
3:64:3851:20:20:108:503:126:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:and continues to assume that inputs are paid their marginal products. The main difference
3:65:3940:20:0:108:361:106:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:comes through generalizing the human capital aggregator.
4:66:3997:0:20:122:503:692:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:The primary results and their intuition can be introduced briefly as follows. Write a

4:70:4328:20:20:108:504:612:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:paper shows that any human capital aggregatorthat meets basic neoclassical assumptions
4:71:4414:20:29:108:325:592:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:can be written in a general manner as (Lemma 1)

4:73:4481:30:20:107:504:533:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:where1is the marginal increase in total (i.e. collective) human capital services from an
4:74:4570:20:20:107:503:513:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:additional unit of unskilled human capital services.  This result is simple, general, and
4:75:4659:20:20:107:503:493:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:intuitive.  It says that, once we have used relative wages in an economy to convert workers
4:76:4750:20:20:107:503:473:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:into equivalent units of unskilled labor ( ̃), we must still consider how the productivity of
4:77:4844:20:20:107:503:453:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:an unskilled worker depends on the skills of other workers, an effect encapsulated by the
4:78:4933:20:19:107:147:433:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:term1.
4:79:4940:19:20:122:503:414:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:This result clarifies the potential limitations of standard human capital accounting, which
4:80:5031:20:20:107:503:394:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:focuses on variation in ̃across countries. Because the variation in ̃is modest in practice,
4:81:5124:20:20:107:503:374:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:human capital appears to explain very little.1In revisiting that conclusion, one possibility
4:82:5216:20:20:107:503:354:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:is that1varies substantially across countries.   Traditional human capital accounting
4:83:5302:20:20:107:504:334:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:assumes that1is constant, so that unskilled workers’ output is a perfect substitute for other
4:84:5396:20:19:107:504:314:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:workers’ outputs. However, this assumption rules out two kinds of effects. First, it rules out
4:85:5490:19:20:107:503:295:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:the possibility that the marginal product of unskilled workers might be higher when they are
4:86:5582:20:20:107:503:275:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:scarce (110). Second, it rules out that possibilitythat the marginal product of unskilled
4:87:5673:20:20:107:503:255:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:workers might be higher when they work with skilled workers (16=10).2In practice,
4:88:5757:20:20:107:504:235:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:because rich countries are relatively abundant in skilled labor,1will tend to be higher in
4:89:5848:20:20:108:503:215:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:rich than poor countries, amplifying human capital differences.  This reasoning establishes
4:90:5939:20:19:108:504:195:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:natural conditions under which traditional human capital accounting is downward biased,
4:91:6026:19:15:108:468:176:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:providing only a lower bound on actual human capital differences across countries.
4:92:6108:15:12:119:504:161:36:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:1For example, comparing the 90th and 10th percentile countries by per-capita income, the ratio of per-
4:93:6210:12:10:108:504:149:65:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:capita income is 20 while the ratio of unskilled worker equivalents is only 2 (see, e.g., the review of Caselli
4:94:6321:10:7:108:131:139:65:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:2005).
4:95:6327:7:12:119:504:132:36:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:2For example, hospital orderlies might have higher real wages when scarce and when working with
4:96:6422:12:9:108:504:120:65:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:doctors. Farmhands may have higher real wages when scarce and when directed by experts on fertizilation,
4:97:6526:9:10:108:503:111:65:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:crop rotation, seed choice, irrigation, and market timing. Such scarcity and complementarity effects are
4:98:6630:10:9:108:504:101:65:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:natural features of neoclassical production theory.  They are also found empirically in analyses of the wage
4:99:6738:9:0:108:381:92:65:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:structure within countries (see, e.g., the review by Katz and Autor 1999).
5:100:6813:0:20:122:504:692:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:To estimate human capital stocks while incorporating these effects, this paper further in-
5:101:6903:20:20:108:504:672:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:troduces a “Generalized Division of Labor” (GDL) human capital aggregator, which features
5:102:6992:20:30:108:371:652:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:a constant-returns-to-scale aggregation of skilled labor types

5:104:7069:30:20:107:511:592:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:that combines with unskilled labor services with constant elasticity of substitution,.This
5:105:7160:20:19:107:503:572:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:approach has several useful properties.  First, the GDL human capital stock can be cal-
5:106:7247:19:20:107:504:553:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:culated without specifying(·), so that the human capital stock calculation is robust to a
5:107:7337:20:20:108:504:533:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:wide variety of sub-aggregations of skilled workers. Second, GDL aggregation encompasses
5:108:7425:20:20:108:504:513:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:traditional human capital accounting as a special case.  Third, the human capital stock
5:109:7512:20:20:108:504:493:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:calculation becomes log-linear in unskilled labor services and unskilled labor equivalents,
5:110:7603:20:20:108:354:473:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:making it also amenable to linear regression approaches.
5:111:7659:20:20:122:503:453:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Using this aggregator, accounting estimatesshow that physical and human capital varia-
5:112:7745:20:19:108:504:433:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:tion can fully explain the wealth and poverty of nations when≈16. Meanwhile, regression
5:113:7834:19:20:107:503:414:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:estimates suggest values forin a similar range. This approach can thus resolve the conflict
5:114:7926:20:20:108:503:394:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:between regression and accounting evidence inthe existing literature.  This consistency
5:115:8013:20:20:108:503:374:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:appears both in the capacity to estimate central roles for human capital and in specific
5:116:8101:20:20:108:503:354:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:estimates ofin the generalized aggregator.  Moreover, while these calculations are made
5:117:8189:20:20:108:503:334:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:across countries, existing micro-estimates within countries for related sub-classes of human
5:118:8281:20:19:108:503:314:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:capital aggregators appear broadly consistent with values ofin this range (e.g., Katz and
5:119:8371:19:20:107:385:295:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Autor 1999, Ciccone and Peri 2005, Caselli and Coleman 2006).
5:120:8432:20:20:122:504:275:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Having established these results about human capital stocks, sources of human capi-
5:121:8515:20:20:107:517:255:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:tal variation are further investigated by unpacking the skilled aggregator,(·).First,
5:122:8601:20:20:108:504:235:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:skill differences across countries are examined along quantity and quality dimensions.  To
5:123:8691:20:20:108:504:215:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:perform this analysis, it is shown that differences in the quality of skilled workers across
5:124:8783:20:19:108:504:195:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:economies will tend to appear through differences in labor supply (quantities), not wages
5:125:8872:19:20:108:504:176:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:(factor prices), providing a further caveat against relying on wage returns alone to make
5:126:8961:20:20:108:504:156:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:human capital inferences. Second, it is shown -always maintaining neoclassical assumptions
5:127:9051:20:20:108:504:136:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:- that quality differences between skilled workers in rich and poor countries can be naturally
5:128:9145:20:20:108:503:116:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:amplified by labor division. Moving beyond the traditional treatment of skilled workers as
5:129:9235:20:0:108:504:96:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:perfect substitutes, this analysis instead acknowledges that technicians, engineers, medical
6:130:9328:0:20:108:504:692:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:professionals, et cetera come in many varieties with highly differentiated task specializa-
6:131:9419:20:20:108:503:672:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:tions.  Such task differentiation may be inevitable in advanced economies where the set
6:132:9506:20:20:108:504:652:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:of advanced knowledge used in production is too large for any one person to know (Jones
6:133:9593:20:20:108:504:632:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:2009).  This analysis supports the human capital stock calculations by showing in greater
6:134:9682:20:20:108:420:612:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:detail where human capital differences across countries may come from.
6:135:9752:20:19:122:503:592:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Lastly, the paper discusses the broader meaning of a “human capital” explanation for the
6:136:9840:19:20:108:504:573:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:wealth and poverty of nations. A human capital explanation acts to eliminate total factor
6:137:9929:20:20:108:504:553:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:productivity residuals in explaining economic prosperity, which can be construed as a central
6:138:10022:20:20:108:503:533:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:goal of macroeconomic research. At the same time, because residual productivity differences
6:139:10113:20:20:108:503:513:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:are often interpreted as variation in "ideas" or "institutions", a human capital explanation
6:140:10205:20:20:108:504:493:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:might be interpreted as limiting these other stories.  I will argue, to the contrary, that the
6:141:10299:20:20:108:504:473:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:embodiment of ideas (facts, theories, methods) into people is a good description of what
6:142:10387:20:19:108:504:453:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:human capital actually is. Further, this process of human capital investment can be critically
6:143:10481:19:20:108:503:434:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:influenced by institutions. In this interpretation, the contribution of this paper is not in
6:144:10573:20:20:108:504:414:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:reducing the roles of ideas or institutions, but in showing how the role of human capital
6:145:10662:20:20:108:503:394:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:can be substantially amplified, making it a central vessel for understanding productivity

7:180:12954:27:20:108:504:240:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:The basic challenge in accounting for human capital is as follows. From a production point
7:181:13044:20:19:108:504:220:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:of view, we would like to measure a type of human capital as an amount of labor,(e.g.,

9:253:16491:20:30:108:222:493:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:can be justified as follows.
9:254:16519:30:0:108:360:463:100:g_d0_f1:100:g_d0_f6:Assumption 3Let the human capital aggregator be ̃=

9:257:16580:27:19:122:504:433:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Note that this aggregator assumes an infinite elasticity of substitution between human
9:258:16666:19:20:108:504:414:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:capital types.  This perfect substitutes assumption implies that=for any two types
9:259:16752:20:28:108:504:394:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:of human capital. It then follows directly that the human capital aggregate can be written

9:261:16852:32:20:108:504:334:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Thus, as a matter of measurement, the perfect substitutes assumption solves the problem

10:293:18358:30:20:108:504:378:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:we see that human capital can be assessed through three essential objects.  First, there
10:294:18446:20:0:108:419:358:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:is an aggregation across labor types weighted by their relative wages,

10:299:18533:17:20:108:503:338:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:translates different types of labor into a common type - equivalent units of unskilled labor.
10:300:18626:20:19:108:504:318:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Second, there is the quality of the unskilled labor itself,1.  Third, there is the marginal
10:301:18718:19:20:108:503:299:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:product of unskilled labor services,1.Thelastobject,1, may be thought of generically
10:302:18804:20:20:107:504:279:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:as capturing effects related to the division of labor, where different worker classes produces
10:303:18898:20:20:108:504:259:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:different services. It incorporates the scarcity of unskilled labor services and complementar-
10:304:18992:20:20:108:504:239:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:ities between unskilled andskilled labor services, effects that are eliminated by assumption
10:305:19084:20:17:108:504:219:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:in the perfect substitutes framework. Therefore, the traditional human capital aggregator

11:321:19857:20:20:122:504:608:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:This bias may be substantial.  Moreover, there is reason to think thatΛ≥1; i.e., that
11:322:19942:20:20:108:504:588:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:the perfect-substitutes assumption will leadto a systematic understatement of true human
11:323:20030:20:20:108:504:568:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:capital differences.  To see this, note that1is likely to be substantially larger in a rich
11:324:20122:20:20:107:503:548:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:country than a poor country, for two reasons. First, rich countries have substantially fewer
11:325:20214:20:20:107:503:528:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:unskilled workers, a scarcity that will tend to drive up the marginal product of unskilled

11:327:20390:19:20:108:504:489:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:workers, which will tend to increase the productivity of the unskilled workers to the extent
11:328:20482:20:20:108:504:469:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:that highly skilled workers have some complementarity with low skilled workers (16=10).
11:329:20572:20:27:108:501:449:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:It will follow under fairly mild conditions thatΛ≥1. Onesetofconditionsisasfollows.

13:399:23973:26:20:108:504:558:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:In comparing human capital across economies, analyses must also specify the relationship

13:401:24140:20:20:108:504:518:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:i.e.  that the unskilled have the same innate skill in different economies.  Alternatively,
13:402:24231:20:19:108:504:498:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:one might imagine that children in a rich country have initial advantages (including better
13:403:24322:19:20:108:504:479:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:nutrition and/or other investments prior to starting school) that make11.7On the
13:404:24407:20:20:108:504:459:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:other hand, one might be concerned about selection. Those with little or no schooling are a
13:405:24498:20:20:108:504:439:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:tiny part of the population in rich countries and a large part in poor countries. Especially in
13:406:24593:20:20:108:504:419:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:the presence of compulsory schooling programs, the uneducated in a rich country may select

13:408:24772:20:19:107:504:379:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Because human capital differences across countries track linearly in11(just as they

13:410:24951:20:26:107:364:340:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:how to relax Assumption 4 and let data determine11.

15:498:28622:26:20:108:504:459:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Table 1 summarizes some basic data.  Comparing the richest and poorest countries in the

15:502:28968:20:19:108:504:379:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:25th percentile (S. Korea and India), we again see that the ratio of income and physical

15:510:29651:19:26:108:332:221:100:g_d0_f2:49:g_d0_f2:to add little to explaining productivity differences.8

16:540:31941:15:13:119:504:240:36:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:9See, e.g. reviews in Katz and Autor (1999) and Ciccone and Peri (2005).  Most estimates come from

17:578:35038:9:10:107:503:138:65:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:not relaxing Assumption 3, which means that one will require1 1to increase the explanatory power
17:579:35140:10:9:108:501:128:65:g_d0_f2:36:g_d0_f28:of human capital in a cross-country setting.  The immigrant wage data is inconsistent with1 1

18:584:35556:20:20:108:504:672:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:highly correlated with income per-capita, regressions of income on schooling variables will
18:585:35647:20:20:108:504:652:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:tend to show highly significant positive relationships and large2.  While this correlation
18:586:35738:20:20:108:387:632:100:g_d0_f2:49:g_d0_f2:might be causative, it may well not be, and caution is needed.13
18:587:35802:20:20:122:503:612:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Given these concerns, the more telling aspectof regression analysis may come less from

18:589:35971:19:20:107:503:573:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:is informative whether the estimated production function parameters are consistent with

18:593:36330:20:20:108:504:493:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:role in cross-country income differences, but explicit accounting using a perfect substitutes
18:594:36423:20:20:108:305:473:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:aggregation suggests the opposite conclusion.
18:595:36468:20:19:122:504:453:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:In this section, we show that the generalized aggregator may avoid this conflict.  Con-

18:607:37311:15:13:115:504:202:36:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:13An additional challenge for the original Mankiw, Romer, and Weil (1992) approach is the linear use of
18:608:37414:13:10:108:503:189:65:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:schooling duration for the human capital aggregator, i.e.==1,whereis the number of years
18:609:37512:10:9:108:503:179:65:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:of school.  This approach is an efficiency units aggregator (Assumption 3) combined with an additional
18:610:37614:9:10:108:503:170:65:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:assumption equating skill to years in school, i.e.=.  However, this combination is inconsistent with
18:611:37718:10:9:107:503:160:65:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:the wage evidence.  Under Assumption 3, the relative skillis linear in the relative wage,,

18:613:37917:10:9:108:122:141:65:g_d0_f2:36:g_d0_f2:supportable with a neoclassical aggregator.14

19:629:39085:20:20:108:503:461:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:discussed in the Appendix.  In general, the regressions tend to point to estimates ofin
19:630:39173:20:31:107:170:441:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:similar ranges.
19:631:39188:31:20:122:503:410:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Overall, we see broad consistency between (1) the range ofthat eliminates TFP dif-

19:634:39452:20:19:107:503:350:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:suggest that the GDL aggregator may provide a reasonable theoretical approach, resolving

19:640:39888:29:20:108:504:209:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:A value of the human capital stock calculations above is that they do not require detailed

19:642:40068:20:20:108:504:169:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:the hood" and gain a better understanding of where the variation in stocks may come from.
19:643:40157:20:20:108:504:149:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:One basic question is whether the increased human capital services in rich countries follow
19:644:40248:20:20:108:504:129:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:from the quantity and/or quality of skilled labor. It is clear (Figure 1), that the quantity of
19:645:40343:20:19:108:504:109:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:skilled laborers is much greater in rich countries. It will be shown below that the quality of
19:646:40437:19:0:108:504:90:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:skilled laborers also appears much greater in rich countries. An ensuing question is then how
20:647:40532:0:20:108:504:692:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:quality advantages in rich countries may emerge, and the greater acquisition of knowledge
20:648:40621:20:20:108:504:672:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:by skilled workers will be offered as a potential explanation.  While empirical estimation
20:649:40711:20:20:108:504:652:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:becomes increasingly challenging, given the lack of consensus (or knowledge) about produc-

20:664:41348:20:20:108:504:433:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:prices, and the relative marginal products of the human capital intermediates (),

20:685:42410:20:15:108:504:154:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:precise by allowing for the labor allocation to shift in response to variations in skill returns.
20:686:42507:15:12:115:503:139:36:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:16Ignoring such price variation in general equilibrium requires Assumption 3 — that different skill classes
20:687:42614:12:9:107:504:127:65:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:are perfect substitutes — so thatis a constant.  However, as discussed above, perfect substitutability
20:688:42721:9:10:107:503:118:65:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:across educational groups appears inconsistent with the empirical evidence (e.g., Katz and Autor 1999,
20:689:42823:10:0:107:195:108:65:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:Ciccone and Peri 2005).
21:690:42848:0:30:108:446:692:100:g_d0_f2:49:g_d0_f2:To see this, consider a simple stylized theory with endogenous labor supply.17

21:701:43490:30:20:122:503:493:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:This result provides exactly the opposite intuition from the partial equilibrium reasoning.
21:702:43581:20:20:107:503:473:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Namely, the lemma says that quality variation will appear through quantities, not through

21:715:43957:31:20:110:503:352:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:With endogenous labor supply, quality variation becomes divorced from wage variation and
21:716:44045:20:20:107:504:332:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:appears instead through the allocative shifts that the partial equilibrium reasoning ignored.
21:717:44138:20:20:122:503:312:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:To further establish this general equilibrium intuition, and its empirical relevance, con-
21:718:44228:20:19:107:504:292:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:sider the following observation (and see Figure 3 below). Skilled-unskilled wage ratios tend
21:719:44320:19:20:107:503:273:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:to be fairly similar across economies, while skilled-unskilled labor supply ratios tend to be
21:720:44413:20:20:107:503:253:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:extremely different. That wage returns to education are fairly similar across economies fol-
21:721:44505:20:20:107:504:233:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:lows naturally from result (a) of the lemma;when labor supply is endogenous, equilibrium
21:722:44593:20:20:107:503:213:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:investment levels in education drive the rate of return to the local discount rate.  How
21:723:44681:20:20:107:503:193:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:then can a country like the United States sustain high wage returns to education despite a
21:724:44771:20:20:107:503:173:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:massive increase in the quantity of highly-educated workers?  Quality advantages provide
21:725:44859:20:19:107:504:153:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:an answer. Expanded labor supply lowers the prices for skilled labor services. To maintain
21:726:44949:19:15:107:384:134:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:such labor supply in equilibrium, one needs quality advantages.
21:727:45012:15:12:115:503:119:36:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:17The educational choice decision follows Mincer’s original theoretical justification for the log-linear wage-
21:728:45122:12:10:108:503:107:65:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:schooling relationship (Mincer 1958).  The assumption thatisfixed could be relaxed.  See also Jones
21:729:45222:10:0:108:134:97:65:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:(2010).
22:730:45231:0:20:122:503:692:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:The lemma also makes this quantity-qualitylinkage explicit, via result (b).  When the
22:731:45316:20:20:108:504:672:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:elasticity of substitution between skilled and unskilled labor is greater than one, economies
22:732:45409:20:20:108:504:652:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:with higher skilled quality will see greater skilled labor supply in response. Moreover, for a
22:733:45503:20:20:108:504:632:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:given difference in labor quantity, the implied quality differences become increasingly large as
22:734:45599:20:20:108:504:612:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:the elasticity of substitution falls toward one (because skilled output prices fall increasingly
22:735:45695:20:19:108:504:592:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:quickly in response to skilled quantity increases, so that larger quality differences are required
22:736:45793:19:20:108:504:573:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:to maintain the wage ratio). This theoretical reasoning explains why, in Table 2, human
22:737:45880:20:20:108:503:553:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:capital’s capacity to explain cross-country income differences is increasing as the elasticity

22:743:46316:19:20:108:504:422:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:supply is enormous.  Taking the Israel-Kenya example, the relative skilled labor allocation

22:747:46655:20:20:108:504:342:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:increases in skilled labor supply can be reconciled with little if any drop in wage returns

24:822:50016:20:20:107:504:672:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:145 accredited medical specialities in the United States, and MIT offers 119 courses across
24:823:50107:20:20:108:503:652:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:8 sub-specialities within aeronautical engineering alone.19By comparison, Uganda has 10
24:824:50194:20:20:108:504:632:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:accredited medical specialties, and the engineering faculty of Mekerere University, often
24:825:50283:20:20:108:503:612:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:rated as the top university in Sub-Saharan Africa outside South Africa, does not offer any

24:827:50427:19:20:122:503:573:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:This section considers greater task specialization among skilled workers as a possible
24:828:50513:20:20:108:504:553:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:explanation for the greater skilled serviceflows in rich countries. The approach incorporates
24:829:50606:20:20:108:504:533:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:the classic idea that the division of labor may be a primary source of economic prosperity
24:830:50696:20:20:108:503:513:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:(e.g., Smith 1776) and builds on ideas in a related paper (Jones 2010), which considers
24:831:50783:20:20:108:473:493:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:micro-mechanisms that can obstruct collective specialization among skilled workers.
24:832:50866:20:20:122:503:473:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:The core observation is that focused training and experience can provide extremely
24:833:50948:20:19:108:503:453:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:large skill gains at specific tasks.  For example, the willingness to pay a thoracic surgeon
24:834:51040:19:20:108:504:434:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:to perform heart surgery is likely orders of magnitude larger than the willingness to pay a
24:835:51131:20:20:108:504:414:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:dermatologist (or a Ph.D. economist!) to perform that task.  Similarly, when building a
24:836:51218:20:20:108:503:394:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:microprocessor fabrication plant, the serviceflows from appropriate, specialized engineers
24:837:51308:20:20:108:504:374:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:are likely orders of magnitude greater than could be achieved otherwise. Put another way,
24:838:51397:20:20:108:504:354:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:if no individual can be an expert at everything, then embodying the stock of productive
24:839:51484:20:19:108:504:334:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:knowledge in the workforce requires a division of labor. Possible limits to task specialization
24:840:51579:19:20:108:504:315:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:include: (i) the extent of the market (e.g. Smith 1776); (ii) coordination costs across workers
24:841:51674:20:20:108:504:295:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:(e.g. Becker and Murphy 1992); (iii) the extent of existing advanced knowledge (Jones 2009);
24:842:51766:20:20:108:504:275:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:and (iv) local access to advanced knowledge (e.g. Jones 2010).  Here we consider a simple
24:843:51855:20:20:108:504:255:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:production theory to explore how variation in task specialization may explain variation in
24:844:51945:20:25:108:259:235:100:g_d0_f2:49:g_d0_f2:skilled services across economies.20

24:846:52022:26:20:108:504:184:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Consider skilled production as the performance of a wide range of tasks, indexed over a
24:847:52109:20:20:108:504:164:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:unit interval. Production can draw on a group ofindividuals.  Withindividuals, each
24:848:52194:20:14:107:503:144:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:member of the group can focus on learning an interval1of the tasks. This specialization

25:855:52743:20:20:108:503:672:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:at this set of tasks.  If an individual devotes a total ofunits of time to learning, then the

25:861:53226:20:20:108:504:553:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:We assume that0()0, so that bigger teams face larger coordination costs, acting to

25:897:54312:12:10:108:504:125:65:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:given the presence of complementarities across workers, multiple equilibria are possible (see Jones 2010).
25:898:54418:10:9:108:122:115:65:g_d0_f2:36:g_d0_f2:Here we consider the output maximizing case as a useful benchmark.23

26:925:56540:20:20:108:504:203:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:primary observation here is that considerationsof task specialization face little theoretical

27:930:56847:24:27:108:195:668:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:5.1  Summary
27:931:56859:27:19:108:504:641:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:This paper introduces a generalized framework for human capital accounting. Traditional
27:932:56946:19:20:108:504:622:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:development accounting is nested as a special case and, under mild conditions, is shown to
27:933:57036:20:20:108:504:602:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:provide only a lower bound on human capital variation across economies.  A "generalized
27:934:57123:20:20:108:504:582:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:division of labor" aggregator is introduced, which allows human capital stocks to be calcu-
27:935:57214:20:20:108:503:562:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:lated with relatively little aggregation structure. This framework can reconcile the conflict
27:936:57307:20:20:108:503:542:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:between regression analyses (e.g. Mankiw, Romer, and Weil 1992) and traditional account-
27:937:57395:20:19:108:504:522:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:ing approaches (e.g. Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare 1997, Hall and Jones 1999, Caselli 2005).
27:938:57484:19:20:108:504:503:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Human capital stocks can now play a central role in explaining the wealth and poverty of
27:939:57572:20:20:108:142:483:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:nations.
27:940:57580:20:20:122:503:463:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Having established these results about human capital stocks, the paper further considers
27:941:57668:20:20:108:504:443:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:possible underlying sources of human capital variation. First, the generalized framework
27:942:57756:20:20:108:504:423:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:is extended to account for quality differences in workers’ serviceflows.  Wage variation is
27:943:57847:20:19:108:503:403:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:found to be a poor guide to quality differences, because labor supply adjustments tend to
27:944:57936:19:20:108:503:384:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:neutralize the wage effects. In consequence, quality differences tend to appear as quantity
27:945:58027:20:20:108:504:364:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:differences rather than wage differences.  Because skilled labor quantity differences are so
27:946:58119:20:20:108:503:344:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:large across countries, one infers correspondingly large differences in skilled labor qualities.
27:947:58215:20:20:108:504:324:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Second, variation in knowledge acquisition is incorporated into the accounting framework.
27:948:58304:20:20:108:504:304:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Increased specialization — allowing greater collective acquisition of knowledge — is seen to
27:949:58396:20:20:108:503:284:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:amplify skilled serviceflows, providing a candidate, underlying production theory for the
27:950:58485:20:27:108:422:264:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:relatively large quality of skilled worker services in advanced economies.
27:951:58559:27:27:108:405:237:145:g_d0_f1:145:g_d0_f1:5.2  Interpretations, Implications, and Extensions
27:952:58609:27:20:108:504:210:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:The paper’s estimates of human capital stocks suggest that cross-country output variation
27:953:58698:20:19:108:504:190:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:can now be accounted for without relying on residual, total factor productivity (TFP) vari-
27:954:58789:19:20:108:503:171:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:ation. Because TFP is often interpreted as (i) "ideas" and/or (ii) "institutions", this paper
27:955:58882:20:20:108:504:151:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:might therefore seem to diminish these explanations for economic development.  Such an
27:956:58968:20:20:108:504:131:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:implication, however, need not follow if (1) ideas are embodied in the capital inputs and (2)
27:957:59061:20:20:108:504:111:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:the embodiment process is influenced by institutions. In this interpretation, the contribution
27:958:59155:20:0:108:504:91:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:of this paper is not in reducing the roles of ideas or institutions, but in emphasizing human
28:959:59250:0:20:108:504:692:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:capital’s potential as a central feature of understanding productivity differences. This paper
28:960:59344:20:20:108:273:672:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:closes by considering this perspective.
28:961:59383:20:20:122:503:652:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Consider ideasfirst.  Macroeconomic arguments aside, studies of actual production
28:962:59464:20:20:107:504:632:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:processes through history suggest that the creation and diffusion of ideas are central to
28:963:59553:20:20:108:504:612:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:understanding productivity.24Yet one may also claim, by studying any particular pro-
28:964:59637:20:19:107:503:592:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:duction process, that ideas enter production only when they are known and implemented;
28:965:59723:19:20:107:503:573:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:that is, only when actuated through tangible inputs - the people and their physical inputs
28:966:59813:20:20:107:503:553:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:that actually make things. In fact, the physical instantiation of an idea may be a good
28:967:59900:20:20:107:503:533:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:description of what physical capital is (e.g. a microprocessor is a set of ideas etched on
28:968:59990:20:20:107:503:513:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:silicon) and learning ideas may be a good description of education (e.g. skilled workers are
28:969:60082:20:20:107:503:493:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:vessels of facts, theories, and techniques).  In this view, one doesn’t need TFP for ideas to
28:970:60175:20:20:107:292:473:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:be a centerpiece of economic development.
28:971:60216:20:19:122:503:453:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Putting ideas into production through capital inputs, rather than as a residual, also pro-
28:972:60306:19:20:107:504:434:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:vides explicit processes in which institutionsmatter. As further emphasized by the division
28:973:60397:20:20:107:503:414:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:of labor model, individuals may collectively fail to embody advanced ideas when faced, e.g.,
28:974:60489:20:20:107:503:394:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:with high interest rates, high coordination costs, and poor educational institutions. Institu-
28:975:60583:20:20:107:503:374:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:tional features like credit constraints, weak property rights and contracting environments,
28:976:60674:20:20:107:494:354:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:and poor public good provision would then naturally underpin these investment failures.
28:977:60761:20:19:122:503:334:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Lastly, claiming that ideas enter production through people and their machines leads
28:978:60845:19:20:107:503:315:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:quickly to an emphasis on the division of labor.   If embodiment is needed for ideas to
28:979:60932:20:20:107:503:295:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:become useful in production, then this next logical step follows to the extent that the set
28:980:61023:20:20:107:504:275:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:of existing ideas is too large for any one person to know.  Differentiated knowledge across
28:981:61114:20:20:107:503:255:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:workers is thennecessaryto bring the collective set of advanced ideas into production (Jones
28:982:61206:20:20:107:503:235:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:2009). Thus, while the division of labor calibration in Section 5 provides one approach, the
28:983:61298:20:20:107:503:215:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:broader point is that successfully mapping an advanced economy’s ideas into productive
28:984:61384:20:19:107:503:195:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:inputs naturally depends on specialized workers, which suggests that the division of labor
28:985:61474:19:20:107:503:176:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:is a central aspect of understanding human capital and economic development.   Jones
28:986:61558:20:20:107:504:156:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:(2010) further develops this idea and suggests that, beyond cross-country income differences,
28:987:61651:20:15:107:500:136:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:division of labor variation can explain a variety of stylized facts about the world economy.
28:988:61743:15:12:115:503:121:36:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:24See, e.g., Mokyr’sThe Lever of Riches(1992) for many historical examples.  Nordhaus (1997) provides
28:989:61844:12:10:107:503:109:65:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:a powerful example by studying the price of light through time.  Conley and Udry (2010) is one of many
28:990:61946:10:0:107:364:99:65:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:studies demonstrating that ideas can fail to diffuse in poor countries.
29:991:62019:0:20:122:504:692:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:In summary, the analysis in this paper suggests a substantially amplified role of human
29:992:62106:20:20:108:503:672:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:capital. Thefindings offer a reconciliation of regression and accounting approaches to human
29:993:62198:20:20:108:503:652:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:capital measurement.  More broadly, thefindings are fully consistent with a framework in
29:994:62286:20:20:108:504:632:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:which investment, ideas, and institutions play substantive roles — but where human capital
29:995:62376:20:20:108:315:612:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:is drawn to the heart of economic development.
29:996:62422:20:19:122:503:592:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:While the framework is applied here to cross-country income differences, the same frame-
29:997:62510:19:20:108:503:573:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:work has other natural applications at the level of countries, regions, cities, orfirms. Growth
29:998:62605:20:20:108:504:553:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:accounting provides one direction for futurework.  The urban-rural economy literature is
29:999:62693:20:20:108:503:533:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:another direction, where productivity differences from specialization are often suggested as
29:1000:62785:20:0:108:430:513:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:critical but cannot be captured using traditional human capital measures.

31:1052:64649:19:20:107:503:549:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:data in Caselli’s (2005) review of cross-country income accounting.  Income per worker is
31:1053:64738:20:20:107:503:529:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:taken from the Penn World Tables v6.1 (Heston et al. 2002) and uses the 1996 benchmark
31:1054:64824:20:20:107:504:509:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f6:year.  Capital per worker is calculated using the perpetual inventory method,=+

31:1056:64993:20:20:107:504:469:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:estimated as0=0(+).  Further details are given in Section 2.1 of Caselli (2005).
31:1057:65078:20:20:107:503:449:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:As a robustness check, I have also consideredcalculating capital stocks as the equilibrium

31:1060:65336:20:20:107:200:390:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:as in the main paper.
31:1061:65357:20:20:122:503:370:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:To calculate human capital stocks, I use Barro and Lee (2001) for the labor supply

31:1064:65621:20:19:107:503:310:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:completed tertiary.  Schooling duration for primary and secondary workers are taken from
31:1065:65709:19:20:107:503:291:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Caselli and Coleman (2006) and schooling duration for completed tertiary is assumed to be
31:1066:65798:20:20:107:503:271:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:4 years.  Schooling duration for "some" education in a category is assumed to be half the
31:1067:65887:20:20:107:322:251:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:duration for complete education in that category.
31:1068:65936:20:20:122:504:231:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:For wage returns to schooling, I use Mincerian coefficients from Psacharopoulos (1994)
31:1069:66022:20:20:107:503:211:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:as interpreted by Caselli (2005).  Letbe the years of schooling and let relative wages be

31:1071:66196:20:19:108:503:171:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:higher in poorer countries, and Caselli summarizes thesefindings with the following rule.

32:1078:66567:0:20:122:503:692:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:As a robustness check, I have considered calculating human capital stocks under a va-
32:1079:66652:20:20:108:503:672:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:riety of other assumptions.  The results using the GDL aggregators are broadly robust to
32:1080:66740:20:20:108:504:652:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:reasonable alternative human capital input measures. The sample mean value ofat which

32:1082:66920:20:20:108:504:612:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:human capital accounting methods.  For example, if we set=10(the global average)
32:1083:67002:20:19:108:504:592:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:for all countries, then the gap between unskilled labor equivalents widens slightly, since the
32:1084:67096:19:20:108:504:573:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:returns to education in poor countries now appear lower and the returns in rich countries
32:1085:67185:20:20:108:503:553:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:appear higher. The resulting increase in humancapital ratio means that capital inputs can
32:1086:67274:20:30:108:452:533:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:explain income differences at somewhat higher values of, but still with2.
