2:28:1403:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:?:We model the motives for residents of a country to hold foreign assets, including the precautionary
2:29:1502:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:?:motive that has been omitted from much previous literature as intractable.  Our model captures many
2:30:1601:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:?:of the principal insights from the existing specialized literature on the precautionary motive, deriving
2:31:1705:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:?:a convenient formula for the economy's target value of assets.  The target is the level of assets that
2:32:1807:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:?:balances impatience, prudence, risk, intertemporal substitution, and the rate of return.  We use the
2:33:1907:14:16:72:539:518:12:Times:12:Times:?:model to shed light on two topical questions: The "upstream'' flows of capital from developing countries

3:53:2537:0:27:100:221:679:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:1 Introduction
3:54:2551:27:14:100:510:652:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The remarkable recent accumulation of foreign reserves in emerging economies has
3:55:2631:14:14:100:510:638:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:captured attention from academics, policymakers, and financial markets, partly
3:56:2709:14:15:100:510:624:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:because reserve accumulation seems to have played a role in the development
3:57:2784:15:14:100:510:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of global financial imbalances. A distinct (but probably related) puzzle is that
3:58:2864:14:15:100:510:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:national saving rates of fast-growing emerging economies have been rising over
3:59:2942:15:14:100:510:580:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time,1leading to surprising “upstream” flows of capital from developing to rich
3:60:3021:14:15:100:510:566:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:countries. The corresponding accumulation of foreign assets in “sovereign wealth
3:61:3101:15:14:100:510:551:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:funds” has begun to attract scrutiny as those funds have emerged as prominent
3:62:3178:14:15:100:265:537:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:actors in global capital markets.
3:63:3211:15:14:112:511:522:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:A popular interpretation of all these trends is that they reflect precautionary
3:64:3290:14:14:100:429:508:12:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f4:B:saving against the risks associated with economic globalization.2
3:65:3355:14:15:112:511:494:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Such an interpretation raises several questions.  What are the main deter-
3:66:3429:15:14:100:510:479:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:minants of the demand for external assets?  What are the welfare benefits of
3:67:3505:14:15:100:510:465:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:international integration, if it leads developing countries to export rather than
3:68:3586:15:14:100:510:450:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:import capital? How persistent will the recent increase in developing countries’
3:69:3666:14:15:100:510:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:demand for foreign assets prove to be? How does the precautionary motive for
3:70:3742:15:14:100:377:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:accumulating such assets interact with other motives?
3:71:3795:14:15:112:511:407:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:This paper introduces a tractable model that can be used to analyze these
3:72:3868:15:14:100:510:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:questions and others. The model is a small-open-macroeconomy version of the
3:73:3943:14:14:100:510:378:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model of individual precautionary saving developed by Carroll (2009a), based
3:74:4019:14:15:100:510:364:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on Toche (2005) (see also Sargent and Ljunqvist (2000)). The model permits us
3:75:4096:15:14:100:510:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to characterize the dynamics of foreign asset accumulation with phase diagrams
3:76:4174:14:15:100:510:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that should be readily understandable to anyone familiar with the benchmark
3:77:4249:15:14:100:510:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Ramsey model of economic growth, and to derive closed-form expressions that
3:78:4324:14:15:100:510:306:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relate the target level of net foreign assets to fundamental determinants like
3:79:4402:15:14:100:510:291:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the degree of risk, the time preference rate, and expected productivity growth.
3:80:4481:14:15:100:510:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The model’s structure is simple enough to permit straightforward calculations
3:81:4558:15:14:100:510:262:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of welfare-equivalent tradeoffs between growth, social insurance generosity, and
3:82:4638:14:36:100:122:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:risk.
3:83:4643:36:12:117:510:212:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:F:1For evidence of causality from growth to saving, see Carroll and Weil (1994); Loayza, Schmidt-Hebbel,

3:86:4857:8:12:117:510:182:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:F:2“The East Asian countries that constitute the class of ’97—the countries that learned the lessons of
3:87:4958:12:10:100:510:170:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:instability the hard way in the crises that began that year—have boosted their reserves in part because they
3:88:5066:10:9:100:510:160:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:want to make sure that they won’t need to borrow from the IMF again. Others, who saw their neighbors suffer,
3:89:5174:9:10:100:510:151:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:came to the same conclusion—it is imperative to have enough reserves to withstand the worst of the world’s
3:90:5280:10:22:100:272:141:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:economic vicissitudes.” (Stiglitz, 2006, p. 248)

3:93:5536:10:0:100:206:100:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:excellent research assistance.
4:94:5567:0:15:112:511:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We then present two applications of our framework. First, we look at what the
4:95:5644:15:14:100:510:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model says about the puzzling relation between economic growth and interna-
4:96:5719:14:15:100:510:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tional capital flows (especially the fact that fast-growing developing countries
4:97:5799:15:14:100:510:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tend to export capital).  We show that this puzzle can be explained in our
4:98:5873:14:14:100:510:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:framework if the bargain that countries make when they embark on a path
4:99:5944:14:15:100:510:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of rapid development involves not only a pickup in productivity growth but
4:100:6018:15:14:100:510:592:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:also an increase in the degree of idiosyncratic risk borne by individuals (like
4:101:6097:14:15:100:510:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unemployment spells that result in substantial lost wages). Second, we use a two-
4:102:6178:15:14:100:510:563:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:country version of the model to investigate the long-term impact on the United
4:103:6256:14:15:100:510:549:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:States and the rest of the world if the recent global financial imbalances were
4:104:6335:15:14:100:510:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to be resorbed by a fall in non-U.S. savings (as some analysts have advocated).
4:105:6414:14:15:100:510:520:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Our model implies that a decrease in the desired level of wealth in the rest of the
4:106:6497:15:14:100:510:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:world has a substantial negative impact on the global capital stock as well as the
4:107:6579:14:14:100:243:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:U.S. (and global) real wage.
4:108:6607:14:15:112:511:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:A central purpose of the paper is to distill the main insights of the complex
4:109:6684:15:14:100:510:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:literature that interprets capital flows through the lens of the precautionary
4:110:6762:14:15:100:511:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:motive.3The older literature on the intertemporal approach to the current
4:111:6835:15:14:100:510:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:account simply ignores precautionary behavior by considering a linear-quadratic
4:112:6914:14:15:100:510:419:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:formulation of the consumption-saving problem (see Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995)
4:113:6991:15:14:100:510:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for a review).  An exception is Ghosh and Ostry (1997), who look at the im-
4:114:7066:14:15:100:510:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:plications of precautionary motives for the current account balance of advanced
4:115:7145:15:14:100:510:375:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:economies. They use a model with aggregate income shocks in which the domestic
4:116:7223:14:15:100:510:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consumer has constant absolute risk aversion utility (an assumption that makes
4:117:7301:15:14:100:510:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the model solvable in closed form but also implies rather special properties for
4:118:7381:14:14:100:261:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the dynamics of foreign assets).
4:119:7413:14:15:112:511:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:More recently, one strand of the intertemporal literature looks at the effects of
4:120:7494:15:14:100:510:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:aggregate risk on domestic precautionary wealth. For example, Durdu, Mendoza,
4:121:7571:14:15:100:510:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and Terrones (2007) present some estimates of the optimal level of precautionary
4:122:7651:15:14:100:510:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wealth accumulated by a small open economy in response to business cycle
4:123:7723:14:15:100:510:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:volatility, financial globalization, and the risk of a sudden stop. They conclude
4:124:7804:15:14:100:510:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that these risks are plausible explanations of the observed surge in reserves in
4:125:7884:14:15:100:510:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:emerging market countries.4Arbatli (2008) argues that precautionary motives
4:126:7959:15:14:100:510:216:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:associated with the possibility of sudden stops in credit can explain the dynamics
4:127:8041:14:14:100:510:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the current account in emerging economy business cycles.  Fogli and Perri
4:128:8117:14:15:100:510:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(2006) instead take the perspective of the U.S. and argue that the decrease in

8:272:15857:14:15:100:511:443:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as a result of human capital accumulation, whereasGis the factor by which

8:274:16009:14:15:100:510:414:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:accumulation and technological advance (Mankiw (1995)). This means that for
8:275:16084:15:20:100:451:399:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a consumer who remains employed, labor income will grow by factor

8:277:16154:21:14:112:511:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Following Toche (2005), unemployment means a complete and permanent de-
8:278:16225:14:14:100:510:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:struction of the individual’s human wealth: Once a person becomes unemployed,
8:279:16302:14:15:100:510:330:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that person can never become employed again. Thus, unemployment could also
8:280:16376:15:14:100:510:315:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be interpreted as retirement (we calibrate the model so that the average length
8:281:16455:14:15:100:510:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the working life is forty years). Employed consumers face a constant risk0of
8:282:16534:15:14:100:333:286:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:becoming unemployed regardless of their age.

8:286:16800:15:14:100:510:228:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:into annuities.  As shown in the appendix, the solution to the unemployed

8:292:17180:12:10:100:510:129:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:induced by the words ‘saving’ and ‘savings’; saving is a behavior (a flow; a choice not to spend some portion of
8:293:17292:10:9:100:510:119:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:current income) while savings is a stock of resources that result from past saving flows. Authors in this literature
8:294:17408:9:10:100:510:110:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:frequently misapply the stock word savings for the flow word saving or vice versa, so we prefer to use the word

10:371:19585:30:15:100:510:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Here is the intuition behind the target wealth ratio: On the one hand, consumers
10:372:19665:15:14:100:510:472:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are growth-impatient. This prevents their wealth-to-income ratio from heading
10:373:19742:14:15:100:510:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:off to infinity.  On the other hand, consumers have a precautionary motive
10:374:19816:15:14:100:510:443:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that intensifies more and more as the level of wealth gets lower and lower.
10:375:19891:14:14:100:510:429:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:At some point the precautionary motive gets strong enough to counterbalance
10:376:19966:14:15:100:510:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:impatience.  The point where impatience matches prudence defines the target
10:377:20041:15:14:100:219:400:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wealth-to-income ratio.
10:378:20064:14:15:112:511:386:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Expression (17) encapsulates several of the key economic effects captured by
10:379:20140:15:14:100:511:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the model. The human wealth effect of growth is captured by theΓandÞÞÞΓterms.
10:380:20217:14:15:100:510:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:IncreasingΓwill decrease the growth patience factorÞÞÞΓand therefore reduce the
10:381:20296:15:14:100:511:342:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:target level of wealth. An increase in the worker’s patience (an increase inβand

10:383:20457:15:14:100:510:313:12:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f4:B:increase in unemployment risk increases the target level of precautionary wealth.10

10:394:20622:24:14:112:511:190:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The response of the target asset ratio to the risk aversion parameterρis less
10:395:20699:14:15:100:510:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:straightforward.  On the one hand, higher risk aversion enhances the demand
10:396:20774:15:14:100:510:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for precautionary reserves. On the other hand, it also implies that consumption
10:397:20853:14:25:100:511:147:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is less elastic intertemporally. The response ofˇstoRis also ambiguous, which

10:399:21030:12:10:100:510:110:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:unemployed means a greater risk of having zero income. See Carroll and Toche (2009) for a careful analysis of
10:400:21139:10:0:100:298:100:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:the case of a human-wealth-preserving spread in risk.
11:401:21193:0:15:100:510:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is unsurprising given that even in the deterministic model the relation between
11:402:21272:15:14:100:510:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:interest rates and spending can be either positive or negative depending on the
11:403:21351:14:15:100:510:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relative sizes of the income and subsititution effects. In our model it is possible
11:404:21434:15:14:100:510:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to show that ifρ≤1, then the target level the wealth-to-income ratio increases
11:405:21512:14:14:100:511:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with the interest rate. For the usual case whereρ >1, however, the sign of the
11:406:21590:14:35:100:347:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:response ofˇstoRcould be positive or negative.

11:408:21654:22:15:100:510:550:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We now add up the individuals’ balance sheets to find the country’s aggregate net
11:409:21735:15:14:100:510:535:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:foreign assets. We first present a general formula that aggregates the resources
11:410:21815:14:15:100:510:521:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of all generations of employed and unemployed workers.  We then specialize
11:411:21889:15:14:100:510:506:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this formula under two assumptions about the initial ‘stake’ of newborns in the
11:412:21968:14:15:100:510:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:economy. (We use ‘stake’ to designate a transfer received by newborns). In the
11:413:22046:15:14:100:510:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model without stakes, newborns do not receive any transfer and must accumulate
11:414:22124:14:14:100:510:463:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wealth through their own frugality.  The microeconomic consumer’s problem,
11:415:22198:14:15:100:510:449:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:therefore, is the one we have described in the previous section. In the model with
11:416:22280:15:14:100:510:434:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stakes, newborns receive a transfer that puts their wealth-to-income ratio at par
11:417:22361:14:15:100:510:420:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with the rest of the population. The main advantage of the model with stakes is
11:418:22440:15:14:100:510:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that it is more tractable and yields a closed-form expression for the ratio of net
11:419:22522:14:31:100:215:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:foreign assets to GDP.

11:446:23259:14:14:112:511:145:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Second, let us consider the wealth of the unemployed households (managed by

12:455:23830:20:15:100:510:554:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This equation fully characterizes the dynamics of the unemployed households’

13:520:26047:22:15:100:510:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We now consider a version of the model in which an exogenous redistribution
13:521:26122:15:14:100:510:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:program guarantees that the behavior of employed households can be understood
13:522:26199:14:15:100:510:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by analyzing the actions of a “representative employed agent.”  This will be
13:523:26275:15:14:100:510:447:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:achieved by the introduction of lump-sum transfers that ensure that the newborn
13:524:26354:14:15:100:510:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:individuals are endowed with the same wealth-to-income ratio that older gener-
13:525:26432:15:14:100:510:418:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ations already hold. This is explicitlynotan inheritance, as we have assumed
13:526:26508:14:15:100:510:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that individuals have no bequest motive and newborns are unrelated to anyone
13:527:26584:15:14:100:510:389:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the existing population. Our motivation is largely to make the model more
13:528:26660:14:14:100:510:375:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tractable, rather than to represent an important feature of the real world; hence,
13:529:26742:14:15:100:510:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we perform simulations designed to show that the characteristics of the model
13:530:26819:15:14:100:510:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with no ‘stake’ are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those of the more
13:531:26900:14:15:100:341:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tractable model with a carefully chosen ‘stake.’
13:532:26948:15:14:112:511:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The details of the model with stakes are given in the appendix. The transfer
13:533:27024:14:15:100:510:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ensures that the workers have the same wealth-to-income ratio at all times. Thus

14:563:27589:15:14:100:176:614:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:assets to GDP.
14:564:27603:14:15:112:511:600:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:It is interesting to compare formula (25) with the one that we obtained for
14:565:27678:15:12:100:511:585:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an individual in the model without stakes—equation (17). SinceΛ<1we have
14:566:27750:12:17:101:511:573:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:B:ˇˇs <ˇs. Thus equations (17) and (25) both predict that the ratio of wealth to
14:567:27828:17:14:100:511:556:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:GDP is lower than(1−α)ˇs, but in the new formula this comes from the fact that
14:568:27906:14:14:100:510:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the target wealth-to-income ratio is lowered by the tax, rather than from the fact
14:569:27988:14:15:100:411:528:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that the wealth-to-income ratio is lower for younger workers.
14:570:28049:15:14:112:511:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We will show below that the model with stakes provides a good approximation
14:571:28124:14:15:100:510:499:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to the model with no stake. But the model with stakes has several advantages.
14:572:28201:15:14:100:510:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:First, the transition dynamics can be characterized using equation (26). In the
14:573:28280:14:15:100:510:470:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model without stakes the transition dynamics involve an infinite state space as the
14:574:28363:15:14:100:510:455:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:wealth-to-income ratio must be tracked separately for each generation. Second,
14:575:28441:14:15:100:510:441:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the model with stakes gives a closed-form expression for the steady state ratio of
14:576:28523:15:14:100:510:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:foreign assets to GDP. This makes it possible to study analytically how the ratio
14:577:28604:14:14:100:510:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of foreign assets to GDP depends on the exogenous parameters of the model.
14:578:28678:14:40:100:510:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:With formula (23), by contrast, such a study must rely on numerical simulations.

15:604:30260:20:15:112:511:537:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:First, we observe that the model with stakes gives results that are higher than
15:605:30339:15:14:100:510:522:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the model without stakes, but generally provides a good approximation for the
15:606:30416:14:15:100:465:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variation of the net foreign assets with respect to the main parameters.
15:607:30488:15:14:112:511:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The variation with respect to the growth rate and the unemployment prob-
15:608:30560:14:14:100:510:479:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ability confirm theoretical properties derived earlier.  The foreign assets ratio
15:609:30641:14:15:100:510:465:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decreases withG, as predicted by (18). The ratio of foreign assets to GDP also
15:610:30719:15:14:100:510:450:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increases with the unemployment probability. The ratio of foreign assets to GDP
15:611:30798:14:15:100:510:436:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is increasing with risk aversionρ. Finally, the foreign asset ratio is increasing
15:612:30879:15:14:100:511:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:withR, mainly because of the impact of higher interest rates in reducing the
15:613:30955:14:15:100:510:407:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ratio of physical capital to output. The wealth-to-GDP ratio (not reported in
15:614:31032:15:14:100:511:392:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Figure 3) is not very sensitive toR, which is consistent with the ambiguity of the
15:615:31114:14:53:100:232:378:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model prediction ifρ >1.
15:616:31138:53:22:100:343:325:14:g_d0_f7:14:g_d0_f7:C:3.2 Comparison with the Ramsey Model
15:617:31174:22:14:100:510:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The Ramsey model corresponds to the particular case where the economy is
15:618:31246:14:15:100:511:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:populated by one representative infinitely-lived worker (Ξ = 1and0= 0). Thus,
15:619:31323:15:14:100:510:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:one might expect our model to yield the same results as the Ramsey model in
15:620:31398:14:15:100:511:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the limiting case as population growth and unemployment risk go to zero (Ξand
15:621:31475:15:14:100:141:245:12:g_d0_f15:12:g_d0_f3:B:0→0).
15:622:31480:14:15:112:511:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:In fact this is not the case. The predictions of our model for net foreign assets
15:623:31561:15:14:100:510:216:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and capital flows exhibit a discontinuity at0= 0. To see this, note that taking

16:648:32171:15:14:100:510:521:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the same at the individual level and at the aggregate level. We can also assume,

16:650:32329:15:25:100:468:492:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that the asymptotic ratio of total net foreign assets to GDP is given by,

16:663:32458:14:14:112:511:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Comparing (27) with (28) shows that the ratio of foreign assets to GDP is
16:664:32531:14:15:100:510:411:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:smaller in the Ramsey model. In fact, it is much smaller for plausible calibrations
16:665:32614:15:14:100:510:396:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the model. The ratio of gross foreign liabilities to GDP implied by the Ramsey
16:666:32695:14:15:100:510:382:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model is close to 70 ifR= 1.04andG= 1.03, and goes to infinity asGconverges

16:668:32844:14:15:100:510:353:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:workers to have a finite target for their wealth to income ratio when they are
16:669:32922:15:14:100:510:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:vulnerable to unemployment, makes the infinitely-lived Ramsey consumer willing
16:670:33000:14:15:100:314:324:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to borrow a lot against his future income.
16:671:33042:15:14:112:511:309:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The intuition for the discontinuity is that a consumer with CRRA utility will
16:672:33119:14:14:100:510:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:never allow wealth to fall to zero if there is a possibility of becoming permanently
16:673:33203:14:15:100:510:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unemployed, because unemployment with zero wealth yields an infinitely negative
16:674:33282:15:14:100:510:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:level of utility (ifρ >1). This is the reflection, in the international macroeco-
16:675:33363:14:15:100:510:252:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nomic context, of a result long understood in the precautionary saving literature:
16:676:33445:15:14:100:510:237:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Perfect foresight solutions are not robust to the introduction of uninsurable
16:677:33522:14:69:100:487:223:12:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f4:B:noncapital income shocks, even if those shocks occur with low probability.14
16:678:33598:69:12:114:511:154:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:F:12This results from the fact thatse(n)≤ˇsconverges to zero for alln. In the model with stakes this results
16:679:33704:12:9:100:172:142:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:from equation (25).
16:680:33723:9:11:114:422:133:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:A:13Note that this condition is not satisfied by the benchmark calibration in Table 1.
16:681:33807:11:12:114:510:122:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:F:14Another interpretation is that the precautionary motive acts as a form of self-imposed liquidity constraint;
16:682:33917:12:10:100:510:110:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:see Carroll (2009b) for a formal proof of the equivalency, in the limit, of precautionary saving and liquidity
16:683:34027:10:0:100:143:100:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:constraints.
17:684:34041:0:22:100:221:679:14:g_d0_f7:14:g_d0_f7:C:3.3 Social Insurance
17:685:34061:22:15:100:510:657:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The model assumes that the income of an unemployed worker falls to zero. This
17:686:34138:15:14:100:510:642:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is a reasonable assumption for a country in which unemployed and retired workers
17:687:34218:14:15:100:510:628:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:receive no social transfer (i.e., in which there are no unemployment benefits
17:688:34295:15:14:100:510:613:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the retirement system is entirely based on capitalization). However, many
17:689:34372:14:15:100:510:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:countries have such transfers, and it is interesting to see their impact on foreign
17:690:34455:15:14:100:510:584:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:asset accumulation in our model.  We consider now the consequences if the
17:691:34528:14:15:100:510:570:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:government creates a balanced-budget partial ‘unemployment insurance’ system.
17:692:34605:15:14:112:511:555:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our definition of partial insurance starts by assuming that the ‘true’ labor
17:693:34681:14:14:100:510:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:income process is the one specified above, but the government interferes with
17:694:34758:14:15:100:510:527:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this process by transferring to the workers who become unemployed in period
17:695:34833:15:14:100:511:512:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:B:ta multipleςof the labor income that they would have received if they had
17:696:34906:14:15:100:510:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:remained employed. The social insurance of our model could be interpreted as
17:697:34982:15:14:100:441:483:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an unemployment benefit or as a pay-as-you-go retirement benefit.
17:698:35047:14:15:112:511:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The wealth of a newly-unemployed worker now includes the payment from the
17:699:35120:15:20:100:348:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:insurance scheme, so that equation (8) becomes:

17:723:35679:24:14:100:511:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Figure 4 shows how the ratio of foreign assets to GDP,NNN/PPP, varies withς. The

17:726:35916:14:87:100:335:200:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quite sensitive to the level of social insurance.

18:733:36357:15:14:100:510:609:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that have been discussed in recent policy debates and academic research: The
18:734:36433:14:15:100:510:595:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relationship between economic development and capital flows, and the long-run

18:736:36554:34:23:100:378:546:14:g_d0_f7:14:g_d0_f7:C:4.1 Economic Development and Capital Flows
18:737:36596:23:14:100:510:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Many observers have noted the paradox that international flows of capital have
18:738:36674:14:14:100:510:509:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:recently been going “upstream” from developing countries (especially in Asia and
18:739:36754:14:15:100:510:495:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:most notably China) to the United States. The case of China, which has caused
18:740:36831:15:14:100:510:480:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:so much consternation recently, is merely the latest and largest example of a long-
18:741:36914:14:15:100:510:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:established pattern: Over long time periods and in large samples of developing
18:742:36992:15:14:100:510:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:countries, the countries that grow at a higher rate tend to export more capital
18:743:37071:14:15:100:510:437:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(see the evidence cited in footnote 1), a fact that is difficult to reconcile with
18:744:37153:15:14:100:510:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the standard neoclassical model of growth (Carroll, Overland, and Weil (2000);
18:745:37231:14:15:100:510:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Gourinchas and Jeanne (2007); Prasad, Rajan, and Subramanian (2007); Sandri
18:746:37306:15:31:100:356:393:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(2008)). Can our model shed light on this puzzle?
18:747:37355:31:22:100:189:362:12:g_d0_f18:12:g_d0_f18:C:4.1.1 Transitions
18:748:37372:22:14:100:510:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In this section we look at the correlation between economic growth and capital
18:749:37450:14:15:100:510:326:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:flows in a given country over time.  We assume that the small open economy
18:750:37524:15:14:100:510:311:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:enjoys an economic “take-off,” defined as a permanent increase in the growth rate
18:751:37605:14:15:100:510:297:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of productivity. However, the rate of growth is not the only thing that increases
18:752:37686:15:14:100:510:282:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at the time of the transition: Idiosyncratic unemployment risk rises too.  An
18:753:37763:14:15:100:510:268:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increase in idiosyncratic risk has been observed in many transition countries as
18:754:37843:15:14:100:510:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:they adopt market systems, a development that has not been associated, in most
18:755:37921:14:15:100:510:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:countries, with a corresponding increase in social insurance. In particular, the
18:756:38001:15:14:100:510:224:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rise in idiosyncratic risk has been fingered as a reason for the very high saving
18:757:38082:14:14:100:509:210:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rate in China (see, e.g., Chamon and Prasad (2008) and the references therein).
18:758:38161:14:15:112:511:196:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:More formally, we assume that the economy starts from a steady state with
18:759:38234:15:14:100:510:181:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:constant levels for the productivity growth rate and the unemployment proba-

18:762:38452:39:13:114:510:113:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:F:16This fact obviously does not constitute a test of the model (which would go beyond the scope of this paper),
18:763:38562:13:0:100:505:100:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:but it suggests that the quantitative implications of the model cannot be dismissedprima facieas irrelevant.
19:764:38672:0:15:100:510:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and “after” the transition. The death probability is adjusted so as to keep the
19:765:38751:15:14:100:365:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expected lifetime of an individual equal to 60 years.
19:766:38804:14:15:112:511:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Note that in order to benefit the domestic population, the transition must
19:767:38878:15:14:100:510:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:strictly increase the expected present value of an individual’s labor income, given

19:777:39035:20:15:100:510:520:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The increase in the idiosyncratic risk, in other words, should not be so large
19:778:39113:15:14:100:510:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relative to the increase in the growth rate as to decrease workers’ expected present
19:779:39197:14:15:100:213:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:value of labor income.
19:780:39219:15:14:112:511:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We consider the model with stakes, so that the transition dynamics for ag-
19:781:39293:14:15:100:510:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:gregate wealth can be derived from those for the representative agent. There is
19:782:39372:15:14:100:510:447:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:no social insurance. The appendix explains how the path of the main relevant
19:783:39448:14:14:100:510:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variable can be computed. We are interested in whether capital tends to flow in
19:784:39527:14:15:100:351:419:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:or out of the country when the transition occurs.
19:785:39576:15:14:112:511:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:For the sake of the simulation, we assume that the growth rate increases from
19:786:39653:14:15:100:510:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2 percent to 6 percent in the transition, whereas the unemployment probability
19:787:39731:15:14:100:510:375:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increases from 2 percent to 3 percent (Gb=  1.02,0b=  0.02, andGa=  1.06,
19:788:39804:14:15:100:510:361:12:g_d0_f15:12:g_d0_f3:B:0a=  0.03).  The other parameters remain calibrated as in Table 1.17Note
19:789:39876:15:14:100:510:346:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that condition (31) is satisfied: indeed, the economic transition multiplies the
19:790:39956:14:15:100:510:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expected present value of individual labor income by a factor 20.  If the risk
19:791:40034:15:14:100:510:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of unemployment did not increase with the transition, the expected net present
19:792:40112:14:14:100:329:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:value of labor income would become infinite.
19:793:40156:14:15:112:511:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Figure 5 shows the time paths for the growth rate, the ratio of net foreign assets
19:794:40238:15:14:100:510:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to GDP and the ratio of capital outflows to GDP, with and without the increase
19:795:40316:14:15:100:510:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in unemployment risk.  Note that if unemployment risk increases, the growth
19:796:40391:15:14:100:510:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rate takes time to converge to its new higher level because the rate of labor
19:797:40468:14:15:100:510:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:participation decreases over time, which dampens the acceleration of growth.
19:798:40544:15:14:100:510:216:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The figure also shows that the increase in idiosyncratic risk has a large impact on
19:799:40627:14:15:100:510:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the desired level of net foreign assets in the long run—and thus on the direction
19:800:40708:15:14:100:510:187:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of capital flows during the transition. If the level of idiosyncratic risk remains the
19:801:40794:14:14:100:510:173:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:same, the pickup in growth lowers the long-run level of foreign assets from -23.9
19:802:40875:14:15:100:510:159:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:percent to -135.6 percent of GDP, so that the higher growth rate is associated
19:803:40953:15:31:100:510:144:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with a larger volume of capital inflows, both in the transition and in the long
19:804:41032:31:13:114:511:113:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:F:17WithG= 1.04and0= 0.025, our benchmark calibration is the average of the pre-transition and post-
19:805:41130:13:0:100:169:100:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:transition regimes.
20:806:41151:0:15:100:510:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:run.  By contrast, if the level of idiosyncratic risk increases with growth, the
20:807:41231:15:14:100:510:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:long-run level of foreign assets increases to 69.7 percent of GDP, implying that
20:808:41311:14:15:100:510:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:higher growth is associated with capital outflows.18Thus, small changes in the
20:809:41389:15:14:100:510:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:level of idiosyncratic risk have a first-order impact on the volume and direction
20:810:41470:14:14:100:510:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of capital flows and may help explain the puzzling correlation between economic
20:811:41549:14:44:100:367:607:12:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f4:B:growth and capital flows that is found in the data.19

20:813:41621:22:14:100:510:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We now look at what the model says about the steady-state correlation between
20:814:41698:14:15:100:510:527:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:growth and capital flows, rather than the correlation for a given country over
20:815:41776:15:14:100:510:512:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time.  The country exports capital if its net foreign asset position is positive
20:816:41856:14:15:100:511:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(NNN >0), since the level of its net foreign assets increases over time with output.

20:833:42346:14:15:100:510:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the sign of the relation between growth and net capital flows is theoretically
20:834:42424:15:14:100:158:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ambiguous.
20:835:42434:14:15:112:511:343:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We calibrate the model with the pre-transition regime parameter values (i.e.
20:836:42510:15:14:100:511:328:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:withG= 1.02and0= 0.02). Figure 6 shows how the right-hand side of (32)
20:837:42580:14:15:100:510:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:varies withGunder two different assumptions. The line “constant risk” shows the
20:838:42659:15:14:100:510:299:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ratio of capital outflows to GDP if the only variable that changes is the growth
20:839:42739:14:14:100:510:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rate. The line “increasing risk” is based on the assumption that the idiosyncratic
20:840:42821:14:15:100:510:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:risk increases linearly by 0.25 percent for every additional percent of growth.
20:841:42900:15:14:100:510:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Points A, B, and C respectively correspond to the benchmark calibration, the
20:842:42976:14:15:100:489:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:pre-transition regime and the post-transition regime of the previous section.
20:843:43053:15:14:112:511:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Two findings stand out.  First, if idiosyncratic risk does not increase with
20:844:43129:14:21:100:510:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:growth, the ratio of capital outflows to GDP is decreasing with growth. Second,
20:845:43208:21:12:114:510:192:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:F:18The pattern shown in figure 5 is robust to plausible changes in the values of the parameters. For example,
20:846:43316:12:10:100:510:180:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:higher growth remains associated with capital outflows if the post-transition growth rate is 8 percent instead of
20:847:43429:10:9:100:511:170:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:6 percent (keeping0aequal to 3 percent) or if the unemployment probability increases to 2.5 percent instead
20:848:43536:9:9:100:371:161:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:of 3 percent (keeping the post-transition growth rate equal to 6 percent).
20:849:43610:9:12:114:510:152:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:F:19A similar point is made by Sandri (2008). In Sandri’s model, the increase in the growth rate and in the
20:850:43715:12:10:100:510:140:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:level of idiosyncratic risk are jointly determined by the emergence of a class of entrepreneurs who invest in a
20:851:43826:10:9:100:510:130:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:risky technology, but must provide for the possibility of bankruptcy by putting aside riskless assets outside of
20:852:43938:9:8:100:208:121:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:their entrepreneurial activity.
20:853:43969:8:13:114:510:113:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:F:20See Carroll (2000) for further discussion of the possibility for precautionary models to generate a positive
20:854:44079:13:0:100:220:100:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:causality from growth to saving.
21:855:44113:0:15:100:510:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:if idiosyncratic risk increases with growth as we have specified, the ratio of
21:856:44191:15:14:100:510:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:capital outflows to output is positive, i.e., an increase in growth always causes
21:857:44272:14:15:100:510:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the economy to export more capital (even if it grows at 10 percent per year). The
21:858:44353:15:14:100:510:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:relationship between the ratio of capital outflows to GDP and the growth rate is
21:859:44433:14:14:100:510:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:non-monotonic. Capital outflows increase (as a share of GDP) with the growth
21:860:44509:14:15:100:510:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rate if the latter is lower than 6 percent. For higher levels of the growth rate the
21:861:44593:15:45:100:278:592:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sign of the relationship is reversed.

21:863:44651:23:14:100:510:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The main counterpart for the accumulation of net foreign assets by developing

21:865:44812:15:14:100:510:495:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In a famous 2005 speech, Ben Bernanke hypothesized that the then-prevailing low
21:866:44891:14:14:100:510:481:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:level of world interest rates and high level of U.S. current account deficits could be
21:867:44977:14:15:100:510:467:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:due in part to this global “savings glut” (Bernanke (2005)). The U.S. authorities
21:868:45058:15:14:100:510:452:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:subsequently argued that an orderly resolution of global financial imbalances
21:869:45135:14:15:100:510:438:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:required the saving rate of Asian emerging market countries, most notably China,
21:870:45215:15:14:100:282:423:12:g_d0_f3:6:g_d0_f4:B:to decrease to more normal levels.21
21:871:45251:14:15:112:511:409:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The small economy assumption is not appropriate for studying such large
21:872:45322:15:14:100:510:394:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:events. We therefore present in this section a two-country general equilibrium
21:873:45400:14:15:100:510:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:version of the model that can be used instead. The model is solved only for the
21:874:45479:15:14:100:510:365:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:steady state equilibria, which means that we will be interested in the long-term
21:875:45559:14:14:100:510:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consequences of particular policy experiments. We first look at a closed-economy

21:897:46150:15:14:100:471:157:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from the model with stakes and social insurance, i.e., it is given by (30).
21:898:46225:14:15:112:511:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Figure 7 shows how the desired stocks of saving and of capital vary with the

22:910:47113:22:15:100:510:527:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This section uses a two-country version of our model to investigate the long-run

22:912:47274:14:15:100:510:498:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We consider a two-country world, where each country has the same structure

22:917:47649:14:15:100:510:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:there is a well-defined balanced growth path in which each country maintains a

22:935:48337:15:14:100:511:214:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9:B:is lower at home than in the rest of the world. We assume the valuesςh= 1.5

22:941:48752:20:12:114:510:122:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:F:22We would obtain similar results by varying parameters other than the level of social insurance. We choose
22:942:48859:12:10:100:510:110:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:F:social insurance (as opposed to, say, taste parameters such as the level of risk aversion) because it is a policy

23:946:49156:14:15:100:510:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the world; this is achieved by increasingςfto the home level (from 0.75 to 1.5).
23:947:49236:15:14:100:510:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Figure 8 shows the long-run response of the foreign assets and liabilities, as well
23:948:49319:14:14:100:510:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as the global real interest rate and real wage (normalized by productivity). As
23:949:49398:14:15:100:510:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:expected, the net foreign assets of the home and foreign countries go to zero as
23:950:49478:15:14:100:510:592:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the two countries converge to the same ratio of wealth to GDP. However, this
23:951:49554:14:15:100:510:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:convergence is achieved mainly by a decrease in global capital, which is reflected
23:952:49636:15:14:100:510:563:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in an increase in the real interest rate (from 4.2 to 5.6 percent), and a decrease
23:953:49718:14:15:100:330:549:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in the normalized real wage (by 5.4 percent).
23:954:49763:15:14:112:511:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The decrease in the desired foreign level of wealth thus has a large negative
23:955:49840:14:15:100:510:520:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:impact on the real wage.  The welfare effect is unambiguously negative for
23:956:49914:15:14:100:510:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the home country. The long-run welfare impact is also negative in the foreign
23:957:49991:14:14:100:510:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:country, although not necessarily during the transition, as the generations that
23:958:50071:14:15:100:510:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are alive at the time of the increase in social insurance benefit from consuming
23:959:50151:15:14:100:510:462:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the accumulated net foreign assets. The home country enjoys an export boom
23:960:50225:14:15:100:510:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:during the transition, but this is associated with lower investment rather than
23:961:50304:15:14:100:173:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:higher output.
23:962:50318:14:15:112:511:419:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:The intuition should be clear from the analysis of the closed economy in the
23:963:50394:15:14:100:510:404:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:previous section. The decrease in the desired level of foreign wealth raises the
23:964:50474:14:15:100:510:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:world interest rate, with little impact on the level of home wealth. Thus, it is
23:965:50554:15:14:100:510:375:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reflected mainly in a decrease in the ratio of capital to output, which depresses
23:966:50635:14:52:100:171:361:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the real wage.
23:967:50649:52:26:100:207:309:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:5 Conclusion
23:968:50661:26:15:100:510:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This paper has presented a tractable model of the net foreign assets of a small
23:969:50740:15:14:100:510:268:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:open economy.  The desired level of domestic wealth was endogenized as the
23:970:50814:14:15:100:510:254:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:optimal level of precautionary wealth against an idiosyncratic risk. We presented
23:971:50895:15:14:100:510:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:two applications of the model.  The first concerned the relationship between
23:972:50971:14:14:100:510:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:economic development and capital flows.  The second concerned the long-run
23:973:51045:14:15:100:510:211:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:global implications of reducing global imbalances by reducing the desired stock
23:974:51124:15:14:100:296:196:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of saving outside of the United States.
23:975:51163:14:15:112:511:182:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Although very stylized, the model is able to predict plausible orders of mag-
23:976:51240:15:14:100:510:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:nitude for the ratio of net foreign assets to GDP. This being said, there are
23:977:51317:14:15:100:510:153:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:several dimensions in which the model could be made more realistic, probably
23:978:51393:15:14:100:510:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at the expense of tractability.  In particular, it would be interesting to know
23:979:51472:14:15:100:510:124:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the exchange rate implications of a multi-goods extension of the model.  (We
23:980:51548:15:0:100:510:109:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:anticipate that such an extension would show that a developing country that
24:981:51625:0:15:100:510:679:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:increases its desired level of foreign assets following economic liberalization will
24:982:51709:15:14:100:510:664:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:see a depreciation of its real exchange rate.) It would be also interesting to look
24:983:51792:14:15:100:510:650:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at the impact of changes in the desired level of wealth on the price of assets other
24:984:51876:15:14:100:181:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:than currencies.
24:985:51892:14:14:112:511:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:Our paper also has potential implications for future empirical work. To the
24:986:51967:14:15:100:510:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:best of our knowledge, the empirical literature has not looked at the impact of
24:987:52046:15:14:100:510:592:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:idiosyncratic risk and social insurance on net foreign assets in the context of a
24:988:52127:14:15:100:510:578:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:large sample of countries. The available evidence is anecdotal or focused on one
24:989:52207:15:14:100:510:563:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:country (e.g., Chamon and Prasad (2008)), or it is about financial development
24:990:52285:14:15:100:510:549:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rather than social insurance (Mendoza, Quadrini, and Rios-Rull (2007)). It would
24:991:52365:15:14:100:510:534:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be interesting to see if the predictions of our framework for net foreign assets can
24:992:52449:14:15:100:510:520:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be tested with the available data (although we have not been able to find a cross-
24:993:52531:15:14:100:510:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:country database on social insurance that could be used for such an empirical
24:994:52608:14:0:100:136:491:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:study).
