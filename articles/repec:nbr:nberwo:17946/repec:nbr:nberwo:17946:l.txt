2:29:1490:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:This paper documents the puzzling evidence that a substantial number of large public non-financial
2:30:1588:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:US firms follow a zero-debt policy. Over the 1962-2009 period, on average 10.2% of such firms have
2:31:1686:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:zero debt and almost 22% have less than 5% book leverage ratio. Neither industry nor size can account
2:32:1787:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:for such puzzling behavior. Zero-leverage behavior is a persistent phenomenon, with 30% of zero-debt
2:33:1887:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:firms refrain from debt for at least five consecutive years. Particularly surprising is the presence of
2:34:1990:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:a large number of zero-leverage firms who pay dividends. They are more profitable, pay higher taxes,
2:35:2090:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:issue less equity, and have higher cash balances than their proxies chosen by industry and size. These
2:36:2192:14:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:firms also pay substantially higher dividends than their proxies and thus their total payout ratio is virtually
2:37:2303:14:14:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:independent of leverage. Firms with higher CEO ownership and longer CEO tenure are more likely
2:38:2397:14:14:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:to follow a zero-leverage policy, especially if boards are smaller and less independent. Family firms
2:39:2498:14:14:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:are also more likely to be zero-levered. Our results suggest that managerial and governance  characteristics
2:40:2606:14:42:72:366:434:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?:are related to the zero-leverage phenomena in an important way.

3:53:2964:0:19:99:544:653:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:In the year 2000, 701 (or 14.0%) of large public non-financial US firms had zero outstanding
3:54:3056:19:18:82:543:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:debt, including both short- and long-term debt, in their capital structure.  This is neither an
3:55:3151:18:18:82:543:616:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:outlier nor an aberration. Between 1962 and 2009, on average 10.2% of firms show no debt in
3:56:3242:18:19:82:543:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:their capital structure, and 32% have zero or negative net debt. This is also not a short-term fad,
3:57:3341:19:18:82:543:579:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for 61% of firms that have no debt in their capital structure in any given year show no inclination
3:58:3440:18:18:82:543:561:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to take on any debt in the next year. We call the tendency of so many firms to eschew any debt
3:59:3534:18:19:82:543:543:11:g_d0_f2:11:g_d0_f4:B:the zero-leverage puzzle. In this paper we document the puzzle along various dimensions and test
3:60:3630:19:18:82:543:524:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a number of economic mechanisms that can shed light on such an extreme corporate financial
3:61:3720:18:18:82:113:506:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:policy.
3:62:3727:18:18:99:543:488:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:There are a number of reasons why studying the zero-leverage phenomenon is important for
3:63:3815:18:19:82:543:470:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:better understanding of capital structure decisions. It is closely related to the much studied low-
3:64:3914:19:18:82:543:451:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:leverage puzzle, which refers to the stylized fact that on average firms have low leverage ratios
3:65:4011:18:18:82:543:433:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:relative to what we would expect from various models of capital structure. The way theoretical
3:66:4105:18:19:82:543:415:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:work has typically addressed the low-leverage puzzle is by considering plausible economics forces
3:67:4202:19:18:82:542:396:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that would drive the optimal average leverage ratio down (e.g., Goldstein, Ju, and Leland (2001)).
3:68:4300:18:18:82:543:378:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:However, this reconciles empirical facts with theory only insofar as average leverage ratios are
3:69:4396:18:18:82:543:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:equated. What we show is that to explain the low-leverage puzzle one really needs to explain why
3:70:4492:18:19:82:543:342:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:some firms tend not to have debt at all rather than why firms on average have lower outstanding
3:71:4587:19:18:82:543:323:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:debt than expected, and most of extant models fail on this dimension. For example, excluding
3:72:4679:18:18:82:543:305:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:firms with lower than 5% of book (market) leverage (optimal leverage under a reasonable set of
3:73:4773:18:19:82:543:287:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:parameters is higher than 5% in most theoretical models) increases the average book (market)
3:74:4865:19:18:82:542:268:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:leverage ratio from 25% to 32% (28% to 37%). Thus, this result partially replaces the low-leverage
3:75:4963:18:18:82:543:250:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:puzzle with a zero-leverage puzzle. In addition, corporate theorists find it difficult to explain the
3:76:5064:18:18:82:543:232:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:coexistence of different securities (e.g. debt and equity) at the firm level (e.g., Tirole (2001)) and
3:77:5166:18:19:82:480:214:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:zero-levered firms is the only type of public firms to resolve this coexistence puzzle.
3:78:5253:19:18:99:543:195:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:From the empirical perspective, studying the determinants of zero-leverage behavior can shed
3:79:5345:18:18:82:543:177:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:light on the economic mechanisms that lead firms to become low-levered as such factors are likely
3:80:5442:18:19:82:543:159:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to be dominating for zero-debt firms and are thus easier to identify. In addition, it is important to
3:81:5543:19:18:82:543:140:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:investigate whether zero-leverage firms leave a substantial fraction of their value on the table by
3:82:5642:18:18:82:538:122:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:not optimizing on tax benefits of debt, extending line of research originated by Graham (2000).
3:83:5737:18:18:99:543:104:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:In addition to documenting the extent of the zero-leverage behavior, the paper presents evi-
3:84:5829:18:0:82:543:86:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:dence on another surprising (given our theories of capital structure and dividend policies) stylized
4:85:5964:0:19:82:543:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:fact that about a third of zero-leverage firms pay dividends. Moreover, and more intriguingly,
4:86:6058:19:18:82:543:661:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we find that, conditional on paying dividends, firms effectively replace interest expense with div-
4:87:6157:18:18:82:543:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:idends and share repurchases, so that the total payout ratio is relatively flat across the whole
4:88:6253:18:19:82:183:625:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:spectrum of leverage.
4:89:6274:19:18:99:542:606:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:To understand better the nature of zero-leverage behavior, we construct for each zero-leverage
4:90:6368:18:18:82:543:588:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:firm-year observation a reference set of proxy firms that serve as control observations. Each set
4:91:6465:18:18:82:543:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:has up to four firm-observations in the same year and industry that are closest in size and have
4:92:6561:18:19:82:543:552:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the same dividend-paying status as the zero-leverage observation. Importantly, in constructing
4:93:6655:19:18:82:543:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:reference sets, we do not condition on debt policy.  Our findings strongly indicate that there
4:94:6749:18:18:82:543:515:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are substantial differences in fundamental characteristics between zero-leverage firms and their
4:95:6845:18:19:82:543:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:proxies. Proxy firms are highly levered (on average 20%), indicating that neither industry nor
4:96:6939:19:18:82:265:478:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:size can account for zero-debt policies.
4:97:6979:18:18:99:543:460:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Firms that follow zero-leverage policy have higher market-to-book ratios and higher cash
4:98:7067:18:18:82:543:442:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:balances, are more profitable, and pay more taxes and dividends.  Perhaps surprisingly, zero-
4:99:7160:18:19:82:543:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:leverage firms are not younger than their control firms. Our analysis also indicates that debt
4:100:7254:19:18:82:543:405:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:substitutes such as leasing and pension liabilities cannot account for zero-leverage behavior. Taken
4:101:7354:18:18:82:543:387:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:together, these stylized facts provide a striking illustration of the assertion by Graham (2000) that
4:102:7455:18:19:82:307:369:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:many profitable firms seem to be underlevered.
4:103:7501:19:18:99:543:350:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Dividend-paying zero-leverage firms leave a lot of money on the table by not levering up. Were
4:104:7595:18:18:82:543:332:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:an average such firm to increase its leverage to the level of its dividend-paying proxies, potential
4:105:7695:18:18:82:543:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tax benefits amount, under the conservative scenario, to more than 7% of the market value of
4:106:7787:18:19:82:543:296:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:equity. Were the same firm to refinance to the point where its marginal corporate tax rate is zero,
4:107:7886:19:18:82:377:277:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:gains would be much larger at about 15% of the equity value.
4:108:7946:18:18:99:543:259:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Zero-leverage behavior is a highly persistent phenomenon. For example, conditioning on sur-
4:109:8037:18:19:82:543:241:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:vival for five years, 30% of zero-leverage firms do not raise any debt in the next four years. In
4:110:8134:19:18:82:543:222:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the absence of persistence, simulations show that this fraction is only 0.3%. If the firm survives
4:111:8232:18:18:82:464:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for 10 years, it does not have any debt over the ten-year period in 15% of cases.
4:112:8313:18:19:99:543:186:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:A plausible explanation of the zero-leverage phenomenon is that the manager’s personal prefer-
4:113:8407:19:18:82:543:167:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ences differ from those of shareholders. For example, if the manager is endowed with substantial
4:114:8503:18:18:82:543:149:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:stock ownership and thus under-diversified, he would find debt more costly than shareholders.
4:115:8596:18:18:82:543:131:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Furthermore, if the board is more manager-friendly, a manager will find it easier to implement
4:116:8690:18:19:82:543:113:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a strategy of his personal choice. In our empirical analysis, we find strong evidence consistent
4:117:8786:19:0:82:543:94:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with these mechanisms. For example, for the sample of 1,006 firm-year observations with CEO
5:118:8912:0:19:82:543:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ownership above 10%, 22% of observations have no debt, doublethe fraction for the total sample.
5:119:9007:19:18:82:543:661:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Controlling for other factors, a one standard deviation increase in CEO ownership increases the
5:120:9102:18:18:82:543:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:likelihood that a firm adopts (almost) zero-leverage policy by an economically significant 2.8%.
5:121:9198:18:19:82:543:625:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We also find that firms with longer-tenured CEOs and smaller and more independent boards are
5:122:9290:19:18:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:more likely to use debt conservatively. Moreover, CEO ownership and tenure are significantly re-
5:123:9386:18:18:82:543:588:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lated to zero-leverage policy only in firms with smaller and less independent boards. Interestingly,
5:124:9486:18:18:82:543:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:these findings are much stronger in the dividend-paying sample than in the zero-dividend sample,
5:125:9582:18:19:82:543:552:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:indicating that economic forces related to managerial preferences have a potential to explain the
5:126:9679:19:18:82:297:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:most puzzling part of zero-leverage behavior.
5:127:9724:18:18:99:543:515:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Family-controlled firms can also be expected to follow conservative debt policies. Becker (1981)
5:128:9820:18:19:82:543:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and Bertrand and Schoar (2006) argue that family members can be altruistic and derive utility
5:129:9913:19:18:82:543:478:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:from passing on the family legacy and safeguarding the well being of other family members. Desire
5:130:10010:18:18:82:543:460:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for the long-term survival increases the perceived risk of default-risky debt. Consistent with this
5:131:10109:18:18:82:478:442:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:intuition, we find that family firms are substantially more likely to be zero-levered.
5:132:10195:18:19:99:543:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Our paper belongs to the cohort of empirical studies that have recently investigated conser-
5:133:10287:19:18:82:543:405:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:vatism in corporate debt policy. Graham (2000) finds that firms are substantially underlevered
5:134:10381:18:18:82:543:387:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:from the debt tax benefits viewpoint; moreover, firms that follow conservative debt policy are more
5:135:10480:18:19:82:542:369:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:likely to be stable and profitable. Minton and Wruck (2001) analyze the behavior of low-leverage
5:136:10576:19:18:82:543:350:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:firms. Similar to our study, they form reference sets for low-leverage firms in their sample and an-
5:137:10676:18:18:82:543:332:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:alyze the persistence and implications of financial conservatism. Our empirical method and set of
5:138:10773:18:18:82:543:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:questions differ from theirs in a number of ways. Their low-leverage sample includes firms that had
5:139:10872:18:19:82:543:296:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:long-term leverage in the bottom 20% of all firms for five pre-specified years, and the reference set
5:140:10973:19:18:82:543:277:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:includes all remaining firms. Thus, their proxy construction is conditioned on leverage, while our
5:141:11071:18:18:82:543:259:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:proxy construction specifically exclude capital structure. Our results also add to the existing body
5:142:11171:18:19:82:543:241:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of literature exploring relationship between managerial features and corporate capital structure
5:143:11267:19:18:82:543:222:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:policies. One stream of literature (Agrawal and Nagarajan (1990), Berger, Ofek, and Yermack

5:145:11450:18:19:82:542:186:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:managerial ownership and compensation on leverage choices. Graham and Narasimhan (2004)
5:146:11537:19:18:82:543:167:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and Malmendier, Tate, and Yan (2011) show that CEO characteristics such as overconfidence and
5:147:11630:18:18:82:543:149:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Great Depression experience cause managers to reduce leverage. Our findings complement this
5:148:11721:18:18:82:543:131:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:literature by linking the puzzling extreme debt conservatism with several salient CEO and firm
5:149:11815:18:19:82:359:113:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:characteristics, such as CEO ownership and family status.
5:150:11872:19:0:99:543:94:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The following section presents the data, the
6:151:11998:0:19:82:544:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:methodology we use to estimate capital structure and construct proxies for zero-leverage firms,
6:152:12093:19:18:82:543:661:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and our initial empirical analysis. Section II provides further empirical analysis on potential tax

6:154:12287:18:19:82:543:625:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:debt behavior. Section III presents our analysis of the relation between zero-leverage policy and
6:155:12384:19:35:82:367:606:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:managerial and governance variables. Section IV concludes.

6:158:12554:30:18:99:543:512:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:To construct our sample, we start with the merged annual Compustat/CRSP data set over the
6:159:12643:18:18:82:543:494:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:period 1962–2009.1We exclude financial companies (SIC 6000–6999), utilities (SIC 4900–4999),
6:160:12735:18:18:82:543:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:non-U.S. companies (entries in Compustat withF ICcode not equal to USA), and non-publicly
6:161:12824:18:19:82:543:458:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:traded firms and subsidiaries (entries in Compustat with stock-ownership variable,ST KO, equal
6:162:12918:19:18:82:543:439:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to 1 or 2). There are 259,579 firm-year observations that satisfy these criteria. We also exclude
6:163:13015:18:18:82:542:421:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:firm-years with total book value of assets (Compustat data itemAT) of less than $10 million
6:164:13106:18:19:82:543:403:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in inflation-adjusted year-2000 dollars.2All nominal values are converted into year 2000 dollar

6:166:13294:18:18:82:543:366:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:refers to calendar yeart.3We also require the observations to have valid market leverage and
6:167:13386:18:18:82:543:348:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:book leverage ratios as defined below. This leaves us with 157,536 firm-year observations with
6:168:13480:18:19:82:543:330:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:14,327 unique firms, from a minimum of 471 observations in 1962 to a maximum of 5,358 in 1997.

6:176:13835:18:18:82:543:211:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:defined similarly in most recent capital structure papers (e.g., Lemmon, Roberts, and Zender
6:177:13927:18:17:82:525:193:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f7:B:(2008), Graham and Leary (2010), Leary and Roberts (2010), Lemmon and Zender (2010)).4

6:179:14075:11:15:95:543:165:6:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f11:F:2Another possibility is to exclude all firms with less than $10 million nominal value of book assets, which results
6:180:14190:15:10:82:543:150:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:in the omission of more observations. As the exclusion of small firms is due to the presence of noise in the accounting
6:181:14309:10:11:82:542:140:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:data, the rationale for either of the two procedures depends on the nature of noise, which can be either fixed across
6:182:14426:11:11:82:543:129:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:years or proportional to average input numbers. We have replicated all the empirical analysis in the paper on the
6:183:14539:11:8:82:397:118:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:resulting second data set without any of the qualitative results being affected.
6:184:14619:8:14:95:543:110:6:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f11:F:3Specifically, we use Compustat data itemDAT ADAT Ewhich is the calendar date of the fiscal year end. For
6:185:14724:14:8:82:390:96:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:consistency, we also use fiscal-year end stock prices (the variableP RCCF).

7:195:15198:18:18:99:543:577:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The choice of leverage definitions requires a special discussion in the context of our paper.
7:196:15291:18:19:82:543:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:As we are interested in interpreting empirical results, we would like to use the measures most
7:197:15385:19:18:82:543:540:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:often used in the empirical literature. From this perspective, definitions (1) and (2) are the most
7:198:15484:18:18:82:543:522:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:common definitions of total leverage. At the same time, there is no widespread consensus on what
7:199:15580:18:19:82:542:504:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:constitutes “debt” and one alternative is to use total liabilities (e.g., Rajan and Zingales (1995)).
7:200:15681:19:18:82:543:485:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:However, we are interested in active capital structure choices of firms while a non-trivial portion
7:201:15780:18:18:82:543:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of non-debt liabilities (such as accounts payable) may reflect day-to-day business arrangements
7:202:15875:18:18:82:261:449:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f7:B:rather than financing considerations.5
7:203:15913:18:19:99:543:431:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The choice of denominator is less important in the context of zero leverage. Also, since all U.S.
7:204:16010:19:18:82:543:412:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:firms follow broadly the same accounting rules, there is no need to make any of the adjustments one
7:205:16109:18:18:82:543:394:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:has to make when comparing leverage internationally (e.g., Rajan and Zingales (1995)). Finally,
7:206:16204:18:36:82:533:376:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:using the interest-coverage ratio as our main definition does not materially change our results.

8:224:17778:19:18:553:543:661:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:here]carry no long-term debt, implying that on average about 30% of firms with zero long-term debt
8:225:17876:18:18:82:543:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:carry liabilities classified by Compustat as short-term debt. Whether these firms refinance their
8:226:17973:18:19:82:543:625:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:short-term debt every year, or the definition of short-term debt includes items that would not be
8:227:18070:19:18:82:464:606:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:classified as “debt” for financial, as opposed to accounting, purposes, is unclear.
8:228:18153:18:18:99:543:588:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We also define the second category of firms which we callalmost zero-leverage (AZL)firms.
8:229:18242:18:18:82:543:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:AZL firms have a marginal debt presence in their capital structure and we classify a firm as an AZL
8:230:18341:18:19:82:543:552:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:firm if its book leverage ratio is less than 5%. There are a number of reasons why we consider these
8:231:18441:19:18:82:543:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:firms in addition to ZL firms. From a theoretical standpoint, a number of models (e.g., Fisher,
8:232:18536:18:18:82:543:515:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Heinkel, and Zechner (1989), Leland (1994), Leland and Toft (1996), Leland (1998), Goldstein, Ju,
8:233:18633:18:19:82:543:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and Leland (2001), Ju, Parrino, Poteshman, and Weisbach (2005)) produce leverage ratios that
8:234:18725:19:18:82:543:478:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are well above zero. Cross-sectional dynamics modeled by Strebulaev (2007) may produce firms
8:235:18817:18:18:82:542:460:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that are almost zero-leverage but in his benchmark case their fraction is very low. Practically,
8:236:18913:18:18:82:543:442:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the finance nature of various liabilities assigned by accounting conventions to debt is ambiguous
8:237:19010:18:19:82:543:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(for example, advances to finance construction or installment obligations). While our choice of
8:238:19105:19:18:82:543:405:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the 5% cut-off is ad hoc, it is likely on the conservative side. Increasing the cut-off to 7% (10%)
8:239:19204:18:18:82:543:387:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:increases the average annual fraction of AZL firms by 3.1 (7.7) percentage points. As Columns
8:240:19297:18:19:82:543:369:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:3 of Table I shows, an astonishing 22% of firms are almost zero-levered for the whole sample
8:241:19389:19:18:82:544:350:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and almost 28% can be classified as AZL over the 1987–2009 period.7To reflect on the models
8:242:19480:18:18:82:543:332:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:mentioned above, none of them, whether dynamic or static, can produce such low leverage for
8:243:19571:18:18:82:543:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:reasonable parameters (for example, in Strebulaev (2007), less than 1% of firms have leverage of
8:244:19667:18:19:82:210:296:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:less than 5% in dynamics.)
8:245:19693:19:18:99:543:277:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Finally, as cash may be viewed as negative debt in some contexts, we also investigate the
8:246:19782:18:18:82:543:259:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:fraction of firms that have non-positive net debt (NPND), where net debt is defined as the book
8:247:19877:18:19:82:543:241:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:value of debt minus cash (CHE).8We find that 33% (39%) of firms had non-positive net debt
8:248:19966:19:18:82:543:222:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:over the 1962–2009 (1987–2009) period.  Again, the means hide a substantial variation across
8:249:20058:18:18:82:543:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:years. A comparison of ZL and NPND firms suggests that for a substantial number of firms cash
8:250:20151:18:16:82:426:186:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:plays a more important role in their balance sheets than debt liabilities.
8:251:20225:16:11:95:450:170:6:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f11:A:7Untabulated results for AZL firms defined by market leverage are qualitatively similar.

9:255:20566:30:18:99:543:650:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The consistently large fractions of ZL and AZL firms are surprising and the obvious next
9:256:20654:18:18:82:543:632:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:question to ask is whether comparable firms have different leverage ratios.  To gauge this, we
9:257:20748:18:18:82:543:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:proceed by constructing for every ZL and AZL firm-year observation a reference set of proxy firm-
9:258:20845:18:19:82:543:596:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:years. Our benchmark construction procedure is by calendar year, industry, size, and dividend-
9:259:20939:19:18:82:543:577:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:paying status. It is important to stress that we donotcondition on leverage-related measures.
9:260:21032:18:18:82:543:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:For example, proxies can be zero-levered as well. Specifically, we start by identifying for each
9:261:21128:18:19:82:543:541:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ZL/AZL firm-year all firms in that year with the same three-digit SIC code. Compustat reports
9:262:21221:19:18:82:543:522:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:historical SIC codes (SICH) starting from 1987. For firm-years before 1987 we have to use the
9:263:21314:18:18:82:543:504:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:1987 historical SIC codes or, if unavailable, the codes in Compustat primary SIC variable (SIC)

9:266:21518:19:18:82:543:449:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:industry standards) and mature, we condition by choosing only those proxies that follow the
9:267:21609:18:18:82:543:431:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:same dividend policy:  for zero-dividend (dividend-paying) ZL/AZL firms, proxies are chosen
9:268:21700:18:19:82:543:413:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:among zero-dividend (dividend-paying) firms. This conditioning has been used in other studies.
9:269:21794:19:18:82:543:394:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:For example, Fama and French (2002) justify the separation of ZD and DP firms by arguing that

9:272:22077:18:19:99:543:340:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Of all the firms in the same three-digit SIC industry in the yearof the observation and the
9:273:22168:19:18:82:543:321:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:same dividend-paying status we choose up to four firms closest to the ZL/AZL observation in size,

9:276:22451:19:18:82:543:266:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:this a reference set of proxy firms. On average, for each ZL/AZL observation, this set contains
9:277:22546:18:18:82:543:248:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:3.4 proxies. The set of proxy firms varies cross-sectionally for ZL/AZL firms within the same
9:278:22639:18:18:82:543:230:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:industry because of differences in size and varies temporally for the same ZL/AZL firm because

9:282:22964:18:19:82:594:157:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:proxies, we weigh all observations equally within each reference set. All statistics are then equally  [Table II
9:283:23076:19:12:553:543:138:11:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f11:A:here]9In unreported analysis, using the 1987–2009 sample does not change our results qualitatively. Thus the potential
9:284:23194:12:7:82:479:126:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:misidentification of the industry code prior to 1987 does not seem to bias the results substantially.
9:285:23295:7:15:91:543:119:6:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f11:F:10In an earlier version of the paper, we used two proxy sets for each ZL/AZL firm, with and without conditioning
9:286:23407:15:0:82:517:104:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:on the dividend-paying status. Most results hold for both proxy sets; the results are available upon request.
10:287:23551:0:19:82:544:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:weighted for each year and then annual statistics are averaged.11The table demonstrates that
10:288:23643:19:18:82:542:661:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:proxy firms do indeed have substantially larger leverage. For the 1962–2009 period, the average
10:289:23738:18:18:82:543:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:book (market) leverage ratio of proxies is 19% (20%)12. These statistics are also closer to the
10:290:23833:18:19:82:543:625:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:average leverage ratio in the aggregate Compustat sample (which is 25% (28%) for book (market)
10:291:23927:19:18:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:leverage) than to their ZL/AZL counterparts. This suggests that industry and size alone can
10:292:24018:18:18:82:543:588:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:not account for the zero-leverage phenomenon. The unreported results for the 1987–2009 period
10:293:24111:18:18:82:543:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are similar suggesting that using constant SIC for the pre-1987 sample is unlikely to introduce a
10:294:24208:18:19:82:159:552:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:substantial bias.
10:295:24225:19:18:99:543:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:ZL/AZL firms and their proxies are also different along a number of other dimensions: on
10:296:24313:18:18:82:543:515:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:average, they have higher market-to-book ratio, less tangible assets, are more profitable, pay
10:297:24407:18:19:82:543:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:higher dividends and higher income taxes.13An important observation is that ZL/AZL firms
10:298:24495:19:18:82:543:478:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:have substantially higher cash balances, on average 75% more, than their proxies.14This suggests
10:299:24591:18:18:82:543:460:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that zero-leverage firms may prefer having negative debt to the extent that increasing cash is a
10:300:24687:18:18:82:543:442:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:substitute for negative debt. If that is the case, it may have non-trivial implications for standard
10:301:24787:18:19:82:543:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:econometric analysis of leverage decisions for it implies that zero leverage is in fact a binding
10:302:24884:19:18:82:543:405:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:constraint and the results reported in the first three columns of Table I may underestimate the
10:303:24979:18:18:82:543:387:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:number of low-levered firms. At the same time, ZL/AZL firms and their proxies are similar along
10:304:25074:18:19:82:543:369:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:other dimensions, such as “age” (defined as the number of years in Compustat), R&D expenditure,
10:305:25169:19:35:82:190:350:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and earnings volatility.

10:307:25239:29:18:99:543:286:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:While this descriptive analysis is suggestive, it overlooksthe possibility that the differences
10:308:25334:18:19:82:543:268:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are driven by ZL firms that are high-growth firms. That very high-growth firms may prefer having
10:309:25430:19:18:82:543:249:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:substantially less debt is not very surprising. At the same time, for the total sample, ZL/AZL
10:310:25524:18:18:82:543:231:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:firms pay higher dividends and have higher cash balances. As a standard approach to distinguish
10:311:25619:18:18:82:543:213:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:between high-growth firms and cash cows we study dividend-paying (DP) and zero-dividend (ZD)
10:312:25711:18:16:82:543:195:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:samples separately.  From an economic viewpoint, it would be more surprising to observe ZL

10:314:25890:11:15:91:543:168:6:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f11:F:12Note that book leverage is slightly lower than market leverage because of the way we define book leverage. See

10:316:26013:7:15:91:543:146:6:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f11:F:13One has to be careful in interpreting the tax-related results, as the accepted GAAP measures and the actual
10:317:26122:15:7:82:308:131:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:taxes reported to the IRS can be substantially different.
10:318:26179:7:15:91:543:124:6:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f11:F:14One well-known explanation of higher cash balances is that large global companies are tax-disadvantaged when

10:321:26513:11:0:82:364:87:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:largest zero-leverage firms, however, the result is virtually unchanged.

11:333:27306:18:19:82:543:461:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:respectively. An important result is that conditioning on dividend-paying policy does not resolve
11:334:27403:19:18:82:543:442:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the zero-leverage puzzle: both ZL/AZL-ZD and ZL/AZL-DP firms have substantially lower lever-
11:335:27495:18:18:82:543:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:age than their proxies. The characteristics of ZL/AZL-ZD firms support the contention that these
11:336:27591:18:18:82:543:406:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:firms are high-growth: their size is smaller than that of DP firms, they are younger, their R&D
11:337:27686:18:19:82:543:388:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:expense is higher, and, importantly, they are on average substantially less profitable than DP
11:338:27780:19:18:82:543:369:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:firms.16Perhaps surprisingly, ZL/AZL-ZD and ZL/AZL-DP firms are similar along a number of
11:339:27869:18:18:82:543:351:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:other dimensions in that ZD firms also have higher cash balances and pay higher income taxes
11:340:27961:18:19:82:170:333:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:than their proxies.

11:342:28070:18:18:82:543:296:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:out on average 57% (41%) more than their proxies as measured relative to book assets. What
11:343:28160:18:18:82:543:278:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is then about the total payout of these firms? Figure 1 shows the decomposition of the ratio of
11:344:28255:18:19:82:543:260:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:total payout to book assets as a function of leverage for the total sample period. It shows that, as
11:345:28355:19:18:82:543:241:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:expected, interest expense is a monotonically increasing function of leverage. It also shows that
11:346:28452:18:18:82:543:223:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:dividends and share repurchases are almost monotonically decreasing in leverage. A surprising
11:347:28545:18:19:82:543:205:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:observation is that the total payout ratio is relatively stable across the leverage spectrum, between
11:348:28646:19:18:82:543:186:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:about 5.1% to 6.1%. If anything, the payout ratio of zero-leverage firms isalmost the largestof
11:349:28741:18:18:82:543:168:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:all firms at 6.0%. This supports the intuition that ZL/AZL-DP firms do not choose to eschew
11:350:28832:18:16:82:543:150:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:debt because they think they have to retain a higher fraction of earnings – something one would
11:351:28927:16:15:91:543:134:6:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f11:F:15We also explored several alternative classification schemes, for example, based on (a) the expected tax benefits
11:352:29041:15:7:82:542:119:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:and (b) on the total payout policy (the sum of interest and dividend payments) with qualitatively similar conclusions.
11:353:29159:7:15:91:543:112:6:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f11:F:16Although many of these firms report negative GAAP profits, some still pay income taxes. We also do not take

12:373:29933:18:19:82:543:339:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is that to explain the zero-leverage puzzle we need to identify economic mechanisms that make
12:374:30026:19:35:82:465:320:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:firms willing to replace payments to debtholders with payments to shareholders.

12:377:30224:18:19:82:543:238:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tivariate logit regressions, where the dependent variable takes the value of 1 if a firm-year ob-

12:379:30419:18:18:82:543:201:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:DP and ZD subsamples. Unreported, when we conduct the analysis only for the sample of AZL
12:380:30508:18:19:82:543:183:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:firms and their proxies, or using the ZL dummy variable as the dependent variable, the results are
12:381:30606:19:18:82:543:164:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:very similar. Firms that follow zero-leverage policy are smaller, have higher market-to-book ratio,
12:382:30705:18:16:82:543:146:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:more profitable, have less tangible assets, and pay higher dividends. Zero-leverage policy is also
12:383:30803:16:15:91:543:130:6:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f11:F:17Unreported, when we produce the same figure for zero-dividend firms, the result is strikingly different: ZD
12:384:30912:15:11:82:543:115:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:firms have a payout that is monotonically increasing with leverage. These firms may need to save retained earnings
12:385:31026:11:10:82:543:104:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:for expansion and their access to credit may be more limited. Also unreported, the results of both of these figures,
12:386:31142:10:0:82:280:94:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:for DP and ZD firms, are consistent across years.
13:387:31227:0:19:82:543:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:persistent: firms that have zero leverage when they are reported in Compustat for the first time,
13:388:31324:19:18:82:543:661:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are more likely to have zero leverage in subsequent years. Firms are also more likely to have zero
13:389:31422:18:18:82:543:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:leverage when the fraction of ZL firms is high in their three-digit SIC industry. The table also
13:390:31518:18:19:82:543:625:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:shows the economic significance of these measures by providing the change in probability that the
13:391:31615:19:18:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:firm follows a ZL policy for one standard deviation change in the independent variable (or for the
13:392:31713:18:18:82:543:588:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:change from 0 to 1 for a dummy variable). A one standard deviation increase in profitability is
13:393:31808:18:18:82:543:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:associated with an increase in propensity to become an AZL firm by between 2.1% and 3.8% and
13:394:31900:18:19:82:504:552:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the same change in tangibility with a decrease in propensity by between 4.9% and 8.0%.
13:395:31986:19:18:99:543:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:A straightforward explanation of low leverage is that debt is squeezed out by various sub-
13:396:32076:18:18:82:543:515:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:stitutes or non-debt tax shields (DeAngelo and Masulis (1980), Graham, Lang, and Shackleford
13:397:32168:18:19:82:543:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(2004), Graham and Tucker (2006), Shivdasani and Stefanescu (2010)). Data availability allows
13:398:32261:19:18:82:543:478:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:us to check two such economic mechanisms. First, although capital leases are included on the
13:399:32353:18:18:82:543:460:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:balance sheet as debt, operating leases are not. Recently, the topic of operating leases has re-
13:400:32449:18:18:82:542:442:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ceived renewed attention in the capital structure literature. Rampini and Viswanathan (2010)
13:401:32541:18:19:82:543:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and Rauh and Sufi (2010) propose including the capitalized value of operating leases in total
13:402:32634:19:18:82:543:405:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:debt valuation. However, operating leases can both complement traditional debt and play the
13:403:32725:18:18:82:543:387:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:role of its substitute (see, e.g., Ang and Petersen (1984), Lewis and Schallheim (1992), Graham,
13:404:32821:18:19:82:543:369:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Lemmon, and Schallheim (1998), Yan (2006), Eisfeldt and Rampini (2010)). Following Graham,
13:405:32911:19:18:82:543:350:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Lemmon, and Schallheim (1998), we define operating leases as the sum of current rental payment
13:406:33005:18:18:82:543:332:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(XREN T) and the discounted present value of future rental commitments (M RC1,M RC2,. . .,
13:407:33095:18:18:82:543:314:11:g_d0_f8:11:g_d0_f4:B:M RC5). The discount rate is set to be 10% for all firms as in Graham, Lemmon, and Schallheim
13:408:33188:18:19:82:543:296:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(1998).18Results of univariate comparison in Table II and logit regressions Table III show that

13:410:33381:18:18:82:543:259:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:samples we consider. This finding suggests that operating leases are unlikely to play a major role
13:411:33479:18:19:82:243:241:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in explaining zero-leverage policy.
13:412:33514:19:18:99:543:222:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Second, unfunded pension and healthcare liabilities constitute potentially an important debt
13:413:33606:18:18:82:543:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:substitute. These liabilities have recently played an important part in many high-profile bankrupt-
13:414:33705:18:19:82:543:186:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:cies, such as GM and United Airlines. Shivdasani and Stefanascu (2010) find that for firms with
13:415:33800:19:18:82:543:167:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:defined benefit pension plans, tax deductions of pension contributions equal about one-third of
13:416:33895:18:18:82:543:149:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that of debt interest payments. Following Shivdasani and Stefanascu, we define Pension Obliga-
13:417:33989:18:17:82:543:131:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tions as the sum of Projected Pension Obligations (P BP RO) and Projected Pension Obligations
13:418:34082:17:14:91:543:114:6:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f11:F:18We also tried an alternative definition of operating leases using available short-term borrowing rate (BAST R).
13:419:34195:14:11:82:543:100:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:Adopting this alternative definition reduces the size of the sample by more than two thirds, but does not change
13:420:34307:11:0:82:171:89:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:any results materially.

14:423:34548:18:18:82:543:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ference between Pension Obligations and Pension Assets if Pension Obligations are greater than
14:424:34642:18:19:82:543:625:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:or equal to Pension Assets, and as zero otherwise. We use Pension Liabilites as a proxy for the
14:425:34737:19:18:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:extent of tax deductibility of pension plans.19In our sample, only about one-tenth (16,966) of the
14:426:34835:18:18:82:543:588:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:firm-year observations report positive Pension Liabilities. Interestingly, Tables II and  III show
14:427:34933:18:18:82:543:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that zero-leverage firms have significantly less (net) pension liabilities than other firms.  This
14:428:35031:18:19:82:543:552:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:result is consistent with a stylized observation that firms with large unfunded pension plans are
14:429:35128:19:18:82:543:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:also typically highly levered. Overall, it is likely that economic factors that lead to higher debt
14:430:35227:18:18:82:543:515:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:usage also contribute to larger pension liabilities and are unlikely to explain zero-leverage policy.
14:431:35328:18:19:99:543:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The results of our regression analysis need to be taken with a large grain of salt as leverage
14:432:35422:19:18:82:543:478:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:decisions are obviously endogenous to other financial and investment decisions. Nevertheless, the
14:433:35519:18:18:82:543:460:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:reported correlations are suggestive: firms (and more so, dividend-paying firms) that prefer to
14:434:35614:18:18:82:543:442:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:eschew debt are profitable, exhibit large tax payments, accumulate large cash balances, pay out
14:435:35709:18:19:82:543:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:larger dividends — in fact, they replace interest payments with dividends and stock repurchases. If

17:567:41086:19:18:99:543:566:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Table IV shows the potential tax benefits of ZL/AZL firms as a fraction of market asset values

17:569:41279:18:18:82:543:530:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and alternative assumptions. We first investigate the scenario of target leverageL∗being the
17:570:41371:18:19:82:598:512:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:average market leverage ratio of the reference set, which we denote byLP r.22To control for  [Table IV
17:571:41473:19:18:553:543:493:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:here]implicit distress costs, we impose an additional upper bound of 70% (see e.g. Asquith, Gertner,
17:572:41573:18:18:82:542:475:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f7:B:and Scharfstein (1994) for evidence of distress at high leverage). Thus,L∗= min(LP r,7  0%).23
17:573:41667:18:19:82:543:457:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:For brevity, we discuss the results using the before-interest tax rates (Panel A) and note that
17:574:41762:19:18:82:543:438:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the results in Panel B are quantitatively similar. Column 1 in Panel A of Table IV shows that
17:575:41855:18:18:82:543:420:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:dividend-paying ZL firms leave on average 7.6% (8.0% at the median) of their market value
17:576:41944:18:18:82:543:402:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:“on the table” by not increasing leverage ratios to the level of their proxy firms. In this case,
17:577:42041:18:19:82:543:384:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the use of average proxy leverage can also be thought of as accounting for unobserved industry
17:578:42135:19:18:82:543:365:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:factors. Our second choice ofL∗is the optimal leverage ratio,Lm. Again, to be conservative,
17:579:42226:18:18:82:543:347:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we useL∗= min(Lm,7  0%). Column 2 of Panel A shows that dividend-paying ZL firms give up
17:580:42314:18:19:82:543:329:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on average a striking 15.6% (17.1% at the median) of their market value by not restructuring to
17:581:42409:19:18:82:543:310:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:optimal leverage ratios. Potential savings for dividend-paying AZL firms are of similar magnitude.
17:582:42507:18:18:82:543:292:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The other columns of Table IV also show that these numbers are robust to alternative assumptions
17:583:42603:18:18:82:543:274:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:about cash flows and corporate bond interest rates. On the other hand, the tax savings for zero-
17:584:42699:18:19:82:543:256:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:dividend ZL/AZL firms are much smaller at 2.8% (0.1%) for an average (median) ZD-ZL firm. The
17:585:42792:19:18:82:543:237:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:difference between means and medians indicates, however, that tax benefits are also substantial
17:586:42887:18:18:82:543:219:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for a number of (A)ZL firms that do not pay dividends, which include such high-profile firms such
17:587:42984:18:19:82:272:201:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:as Microsoft (until recently) and Apple.
17:588:43024:19:18:99:543:182:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Our assumptions in deriving potential tax benefits are mostly on the conservative side: (i)
17:589:43115:18:18:82:543:164:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tax savings from carry-forward/-back provisions are largely excluded; (ii) by using the minimum
17:590:43210:18:16:82:543:146:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:cash flow in the past five years as the liquidity threshold in the benchmark case, the chances

17:592:43416:15:11:82:543:115:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:potential tax-benefit function be zero. This does not change any results as there can be no such cases for ZL firms
17:593:43531:11:7:82:203:104:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:and only a few for AZL firms.

18:596:43776:19:18:82:543:661:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the assumption that the marginal tax rate function is linear decreases tax benefits relative to
18:597:43871:18:18:82:543:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the case when it is concave (which is more likely to be the case in practice). Therefore, the fact
18:598:43969:18:19:82:543:625:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that ZL-DP firms give up substantial amount of tax benefits reinforces the mystery about their
18:599:44063:19:18:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:extreme debt aversion. One issue where we are likely to have overestimated the potential tax
18:600:44155:18:18:82:543:588:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:benefits is our lack of adjustment for personal taxes. As the level of marginal personal taxes on
18:601:44252:18:18:82:543:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:income and capital gains depends on the ownership structure of firms, and firm-specific marginal
18:602:44348:18:36:82:421:552:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:personal tax rates are not available, we leave it for further exploration.
18:603:44422:36:29:82:413:516:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:II.B. Relation Between Zero-Leverage and Low-Leverage Puzzles
18:604:44483:29:18:99:543:487:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The low-leverage puzzle refers to the stylized fact that, on average, firms are lower levered than
18:605:44581:18:18:82:543:469:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:otherwise would be expected by standard trade-off models of capital structure. For example, over
18:606:44677:18:19:82:543:451:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the period 1987–2003, the market leverage ratio of an average firm in the Compustat sample is
18:607:44770:19:18:82:543:432:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:about 26%. A benchmark static capital structure model of Leland (1994) produces a leverage ratio
18:608:44866:18:18:82:543:414:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in the order of 70–90% under reasonable parameters. A number of studies have been trying to
18:609:44957:18:19:82:543:396:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:identify theoretically the reasons why firms are on average low levered. For example, Goldstein, Ju,
18:610:45057:19:18:82:543:377:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and Leland (2001), Ju, Parrino, Poteshman, and Weisbach (2005) and Strebulaev (2007) explain
18:611:45149:18:18:82:543:359:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the low-leverage puzzle by considering dynamic capital structure and non-linear tax benefits to
18:612:45244:18:18:82:543:341:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:debt. In addition, Strebulaev (2007) shows that in dynamic capital structure models typically
18:613:45337:18:19:82:543:323:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lead to higher leverage in dynamics compared to refinancing points. Ju et al. (2005) and Morellec
18:614:45434:19:18:82:543:304:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(2003) consider managerial risk-aversion and managerial entrenchment.  All these studies find
18:615:45527:18:18:82:543:286:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that their calibrated models can produce, under reasonable parameters, lower leverage ratios,
18:616:45620:18:19:82:543:268:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:thus explaining the average corporate leverage ratio in the economy. For example, by considering
18:617:45716:19:18:82:543:249:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the dynamic version of their static model, Goldstein et al. (2001) reduce the benchmark leverage
18:618:45812:18:18:82:451:231:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ratio in their calibrations from 55% to a more reasonable 36% at refinancing.
18:619:45889:18:18:99:543:213:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Characteristically, however, all these models produce arelatively highlowest leverage ratio
18:620:45980:18:19:82:543:195:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:under the most cases they consider: the lowest leverage is 34.3% in Goldstein et al. (2001, Table
18:621:46077:19:18:82:543:176:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:1, page 498), 6% at the 1 percentile value in the dynamic version of Strebulaev (2007, Table 3,
18:622:46172:18:18:82:543:158:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:page 40), 9.35% in Morellec (2003, Table 1, page 274) and 8.03% in Ju et al. (2005, Table 2, page
18:623:46269:18:19:82:543:140:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:270). The exceptions are models with endogenous investment (Hennessy and Whited (2005)) and
18:624:46360:19:18:82:543:121:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:models which introduce fixed costs in the dynamic capital structure model with sufficiently small
18:625:46457:18:18:82:428:103:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:firms optimally choosing zero leverage (Kurshev and Strebulaev (2006)).
18:626:46528:18:0:99:543:85:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:These models are a long way from being able to explain the presence of ZL/AZL firms in
19:627:46650:0:19:82:543:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the economy.  Broadly, our results demonstrate that these models are unlikely to explain the
19:628:46742:19:18:82:543:661:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:cross-sectionaldistributionof corporate leverage ratios. This is consistent with the observation
19:629:46838:18:18:82:543:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of Graham (2003) that many low-debt firms are not firms that one would think of having high
19:630:46929:18:19:82:146:625:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:costs of debt.
19:631:46943:19:18:99:543:606:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The low-leverage and zero-leverage puzzles are closely connected. Table V shows that if one
19:632:47034:18:18:82:543:588:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:excludes ZL firms from the Compustat sample, then the average (market) leverage ratio over the
19:633:47128:18:18:82:594:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:1987–2009 period increases from 24.7% to 28.6%. Moreover, if one also excludes AZL firms (as  [Table V
19:634:47230:18:19:553:543:552:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:here]most of these models can not produce almost zero leverage as well), the average leverage ratio
19:635:47329:19:18:82:543:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:increases further from 28.6% to 36%, which is roughly the level of debt produced by such models as
19:636:47427:18:18:82:543:515:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Goldstein et al. (2001) and Strebulaev (2007). The fact that excluding ZL/AZL firms produces a
19:637:47521:18:19:82:543:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:moderately “high” leverage of about 36% suggests that the explanation of the low-leverage puzzle
19:638:47617:19:18:82:543:478:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is likely to lie not in the behavior of the average firm, which is almost “normally” levered, but in
19:639:47717:18:18:82:543:460:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the extremely low-levered firms. In other words, these results show that the low-leverage puzzle
19:640:47813:18:18:82:543:442:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is actually an artifact of the zero-leverage puzzle and we may need a new generation of theoretical
19:641:47912:18:36:82:180:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:models to explain it.
19:642:47933:36:29:82:309:388:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:II.C. Persistence of Zero-Leverage Behavior
19:643:47976:29:18:99:543:359:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:It is well known that corporate leverage is a persistent phenomenon (e.g. Lemmon, Roberts,
19:644:48066:18:18:82:543:341:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and Zender (2008)). In this section we therefore address an important question of whether zero-
19:645:48161:18:19:82:543:323:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:leverage policy is persistent. If zero-leverage is an artifact of imbalance between maturing debt
19:646:48258:19:18:82:543:304:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:contracts and new debt issuance, this would imply that the puzzling behavior is only of short
19:647:48351:18:18:82:126:286:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:duration.
19:648:48360:18:19:99:543:268:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:To analyze the persistence with which firms follow ZL/AZL policies, for each firmjin our
19:649:48448:19:18:82:544:249:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sample and for eachkbetween 1 and 20, we estimate the probability that firmjfollows the ZL
19:650:48538:18:18:82:543:231:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(AZL) policy continuously fork−1 more years, conditional on adopting such a policy in any
19:651:48627:18:18:82:543:213:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:given year and surviving for at leastk−1 years. To give an example, assume the firm has 25
19:652:48717:18:19:82:543:195:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:consecutive annual observations in Compustat and has zero leverage in the first 15 years and is
19:653:48812:19:18:82:543:176:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:highly levered in the remaining 10 years. There are 15 sequences ofk= 10 consecutive years for
19:654:48906:18:18:82:543:158:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:this firm beginning with a year in which the firm has zero debt. The firm follows the zero-debt
19:655:49001:18:19:82:543:140:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:policy for at least 10 years for 6 out of these 15 sequences. Thus, conditional on adopting a ZL
19:656:49097:19:18:82:542:121:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:policy, the firm continues to follow it for a further 9 years with likelihood of 0.4. By averaging
19:657:49195:18:18:82:543:103:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:over all firms we get a measure of thek-year conditional persistence of a chosen debt policy in
19:658:49290:18:0:82:444:85:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the sample. Averaging over firms avoids bias in favor of more mature firms.
20:659:49401:0:19:99:543:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Table VI reports the results of this exercise. Firms have a 61%chance of continuing a ZL
20:660:49489:19:18:82:543:661:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:policy in the next year. About 30%, 15%, and 5% (35%, 20%, and 9%) of firms that survived for
20:661:49582:18:18:82:543:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:5, 10, and 20 years respectively continuously exhibit ZL (AZL) behavior. Although these numbers
20:662:49677:18:19:82:543:625:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are suggestive, to compare them to similar statistics in the absence of intertemporal dependence,
20:663:49774:19:18:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we construct the same persistence measure for Monte Carlo (MC) simulated economies. The MC
20:664:49864:18:18:82:543:588:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:economy is generated by preserving the number of firms and the distribution of firms’ leverage
20:665:49958:18:18:82:543:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ratios in each year so as to be identical to the Compustat economy, but otherwise randomly
20:666:50048:18:19:82:598:552:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:reshuffling firms cross-sectionally. Constructed in this way, the MC economy can be thought of  [Table VI
20:667:50153:19:18:553:543:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:here]as a benchmark economy with no persistence in debt policies, which at the same time produces
20:668:50250:18:18:82:543:515:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:cross-sectional descriptive statistics of leverage ratios identical to the economy actually observed
20:669:50350:18:19:82:142:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in each year.
20:670:50363:19:18:99:543:478:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Table VI reports that in the MC economy a ZL firm stays ZL in the next year with a 9.3%
20:671:50450:18:18:82:543:460:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:chance, compared with the actually observed 61%. For longer periods the MC economy generates
20:672:50542:18:18:82:543:442:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:persistence values close to zero. As confirmed by t-statistics, there is a statistically significant
20:673:50642:18:19:82:543:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:difference in persistence between the actual and MC economies. Such differences effectively rule
20:674:50738:19:18:82:543:405:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:out the possibility that zero-leverage is not a persistent phenomenon. This result is consistent with
20:675:50839:18:18:82:543:387:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:findings that firms restructure their leverage infrequently (Leary and Roberts (2005), Strebulaev
20:676:50936:18:36:82:119:369:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(2007)).
20:677:50944:36:29:82:288:333:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:II.D. Industry and Zero-Leverage Firms
20:678:50982:29:18:99:544:304:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Results in Table III strongly indicate that zero-leverage behavior is driven in part by industry-
20:679:51079:18:18:82:543:286:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:specific factors. To explore this further, Panel A of Table VII reports the distribution of ZL/AZL
20:680:51177:18:19:82:542:268:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:firms in major industries. There is indeed a substantial variation of the extent of zero-leverage
20:681:51274:19:18:82:543:249:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:behavior across industries – from 4.3% (9.4%) of firms following a ZL (AZL) policy in the Tele-
20:682:51369:18:18:82:543:231:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:com sector to 15.0% (32.0%) of firms following ZL (AZL) policy in the Technology sector over the
20:683:51465:18:18:82:543:213:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:1962–2009 period. The extent of ZL (AZL) behavior in healthcare and technology industries may
20:684:51558:18:19:82:543:195:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:be consistent with the view that reputation, human capital, and asset illiquidity considerations
20:685:51654:19:18:82:543:176:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are influential. Nevertheless, as the table shows, there is a significant number of ZL/AZL firms in
20:686:51753:18:18:82:543:158:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:each industry, indicating that extreme debt-aversion is a widespread rather than a specialized phe-
20:687:51852:18:19:82:602:140:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:nomenon. The results over the two sample periods (1962–2009 and 1987–2009) also demonstrate  [Table VII
20:688:51955:19:0:553:459:121:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Here]that the distribution of ZL firms in each industry is relatively stable over time.
21:689:52078:0:30:148:477:680:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:?:III.  Zero-Leverage Behavior and Corporate Governance
21:690:52131:30:18:99:543:650:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:A plausible explanation of the puzzling zero-leverage behavior is in the preferences of corporate
21:691:52228:18:18:82:543:632:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:decision-makers, managers and large shareholders. Firms may end up low levered if managers have
21:692:52323:18:18:82:543:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a personal preference to use debt conservatively. For example, CEOs with large stock ownership
21:693:52417:18:19:82:543:596:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are likely to be less diversified than institutional investors, leading to personal costs of distress
21:694:52518:19:18:82:543:577:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:being substantially higher.24Furthermore, when CEOs are more entrenched and face friendlier
21:695:52609:18:18:82:542:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:boards, they are more likely to be successful in pursuing policies of their choice (Weisbach (1988),
21:696:52709:18:19:82:543:541:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Hermalin and Weisbach (1998)). In this section, we examine whether the relationship between
21:697:52800:19:18:82:543:522:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:zero-leverage phenomena and CEO and governance variables is consistent with some of these
21:698:52889:18:18:82:159:504:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:economic forces.
21:699:52905:18:18:99:543:486:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:There is by now a substantial empirical literature linking managerial preferences and corpo-
21:700:52997:18:19:82:543:468:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rate actions. For example, Lewellen (2006) finds that the larger the stock ownership of CEOs
21:701:53089:19:18:82:543:449:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and the smaller their option grants the more likely their firms have lower leverage. Agrawal and
21:702:53185:18:18:82:543:431:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Nagarajan (1990) find that firms that had no long term debt between 1979 and 1983 have higher
21:703:53278:18:19:82:542:413:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:managerial stockholdings than their levered industry counterparts. Coles, Daniel, and Naveen
21:704:53370:19:18:82:543:394:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(2006) find that managers with greater delta (sensitivity of compensation to stock prices) and
21:705:53464:18:18:82:544:376:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:smaller vega (sensitivity of compensation to stock volatility) use less debt.25In addition, Graham
21:706:53562:18:18:82:543:358:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and Narasimhan (2004) show that CEOs with Great Depression experience tend to rely more on
21:707:53652:18:19:82:543:340:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:internal than external financing and Malmendier, Tate, and Yan (2011) show that CEO overconfi-
21:708:53746:19:18:82:543:321:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:dence and Great Depression experience lead to more conservative leverage policy. In a theoretical
21:709:53843:18:18:82:543:303:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:model, Hackbarth (2008) studies the implications of managerial traits such as optimism and over-
21:710:53939:18:19:82:543:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:confidence on leverage decisions. Ryan and Wang (2011) find that CEOs who have worked for
21:711:54028:19:18:82:543:266:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:more employers increase firm’s leverage. Our results complement these studies by providing links
21:712:54124:18:14:82:520:248:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f7:B:between the extreme debt conservatism of firms and salient CEO and firm characteristics.26
21:713:54214:14:14:91:543:234:6:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f11:F:24Another argument that CEOs who are large shareholders may be unwilling to lever up is that their personal
21:714:54321:14:11:82:543:220:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:tax situation is different from that of a marginal shareholder. Grinblatt and Titman (2002, p. 552) give an example
21:715:54436:11:8:82:538:209:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:of Microsoft, suggesting that a potential reason of Microsoft’s zero leverage is Bill Gates’s personal tax situation.
21:716:54553:8:14:91:543:201:6:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f11:F:25However, in an earlier work, Berger, Ofek, and Yermack (1997) find that both CEO stock ownership and option
21:717:54662:14:8:82:252:187:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:holdings are positively related to leverage.
21:718:54706:8:14:91:543:179:6:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f11:F:26Zwiebel (1996) proposes an economic mechanism, in which managers may optimally choose higher leverage
21:719:54809:14:11:82:543:165:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:when faced with a possibility of hostile takeovers.  Using such measures as the G-index of Gompers, Ishii, and
21:720:54919:11:11:82:543:154:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:Metrick (2003) we do not find support for this argument. However, these measures are known to be endogenous
21:721:55026:11:11:82:543:143:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:and more robust empirical methods, such as structural modeling, are needed to shed further light on this issue. We
21:722:55140:11:0:82:188:132:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:leave it to future research.
22:723:55204:0:30:82:216:680:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:III.A. Data and Variables
22:724:55229:30:18:99:543:650:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Adding CEO characteristics, as well as ownership and corporate governance measures, reduces
22:725:55320:18:18:82:543:632:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:our sample substantially. We first introduce the new variables and discuss the resulting sample.
22:726:55416:18:18:82:543:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We use board and certain CEO characteristics from the RiskMetrics Directors database (formerly
22:727:55510:18:19:82:543:596:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:IRRC). The database covers the S&P 1500 firms over the period 1996–2009. The variables we
22:728:55599:19:18:82:543:577:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:use are:Board Size, the number of directors in the board;Frac.  Indep.  Directors, the fraction of
22:729:55697:18:18:82:543:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:independent (non-insider and non-affliated) directors in the board;CEO Tenure, the number of
22:730:55789:18:19:82:360:541:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:years that the current CEO has served as the firm’s CEO.
22:731:55845:19:18:99:543:522:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We also use CEO ownership and compensation variables from the Compustat ExecComp
22:732:55925:18:18:82:543:504:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:database, which covers essentially the S&P 1500 firms over the period 1992–2009. The variables
22:733:56019:18:18:82:543:486:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we use are:CEO Stock Ownership, CEO holdings of the firm’s stock as a fraction of total shares
22:734:56113:18:19:82:543:468:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:outstanding;CEO Option Holdings, CEO holdings of the firm’s stock options as a fraction of
22:735:56203:19:18:82:543:449:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:stock shares outstanding;CEO Cash Comp., logarithm of the sum of CEO salary and bonus. In
22:736:56292:18:18:82:543:431:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:this section, we restrict analysis to firms in our entire sample for which the above CEO and board
22:737:56390:18:19:82:543:413:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:variables are defined. The restricted sample consists of of 13,446 observations with 1,962 unique
22:738:56487:19:35:82:237:394:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:firms over the period 1996–2009.
22:739:56519:35:29:82:213:359:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:III.B. Empirical Analysis
22:740:56544:29:18:99:543:330:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We start by describing the relationship between zero-leverage policies and CEO ownership in
22:741:56635:18:19:82:543:312:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:our sample. Table VIII ranks all sample firm-years (Panel A) and firms (Panel B) by CEO stock
22:742:56728:19:18:82:543:293:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ownership and reports the fraction of ZL and AZL among these firms. The table clearly shows
22:743:56819:18:18:82:606:275:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that two measures are highly correlated. For example, consider 100 firms with the highest CEO  [Table VIII
22:744:56925:18:18:553:543:257:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:here]ownership. For these firms, the average CEO ownership is 24% (vs. 2.8% for the whole sample)
22:745:57022:18:19:82:543:239:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and the fraction of these firms that pursue ZL (AZL) policy is 20.4% (40.5%) compared to just
22:746:57115:19:18:82:543:220:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:14.1% (27.1%) for the whole sample. Overall, the table shows a nearly monotonic relationship
22:747:57207:18:18:82:457:202:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:between the extent of the CEO stock ownership and the zero-leverage policies.
22:748:57284:18:19:99:543:184:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Table IX shows the results of the logit analysis of AZL policy. For all regressions, we control for
22:749:57383:19:18:82:543:165:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the variables used in Table III (except Net Pension Liabilities and Operating Leases). Unreported,
22:750:57481:18:18:82:543:147:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the economic and statistical significance of these variables are consistent with the results in Table
22:751:57582:18:18:82:543:129:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:III, suggesting that the determinants of ZL policy in the restricted sample have a similar impact.
22:752:57680:18:19:99:543:111:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Table IX shows that firms with larger CEO stock ownership are substantially more likely to
22:753:57770:19:18:82:598:92:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:be zero-levered, consistent with managerial preference explanations. A one standard deviation  [Table IX
22:754:57874:18:0:553:576:74:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:here]
23:755:57915:0:19:82:543:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:increase in CEO stock ownership increases the likelihood of AZL policy by an economically and
23:756:58008:19:18:82:543:661:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:statistically significant 2.8 percentage points. In addition, firms in which CEOs have larger option-
23:757:58109:18:18:82:543:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:based compensation packages are likely to be more levered, although this relation is less robust.
23:758:58206:18:19:82:543:625:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The results also indicate that poorer corporate governance is related to ZL policy: firms with
23:759:58300:19:18:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:more independent directors, larger boards, and shorter CEO tenure are less likely to choose zero
23:760:58396:18:18:82:543:588:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:leverage. In addition, unreported results show that these results are substantially stronger for
23:761:58492:18:18:82:543:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the sample of dividend-paying firms than for zero-dividend firms, suggesting that the managerial
23:762:58588:18:19:82:543:552:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:preference story is able to explain the most puzzling part of zero-leverage behavior.  Existing
23:763:58683:19:18:82:543:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:empirical evidence on the relationship between board size and firm performance is ambiguous
23:764:58774:18:18:82:543:515:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(e.g., Yermack (1996), Eisenberg, Sundgren, and Wells (1998), Bhagat and Black (2001), and
23:765:58864:18:19:82:543:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Coles, Daniel, and Naveen (2008)).  Cheng (2008) finds that firms with a larger board adopt
23:766:58955:19:18:82:543:478:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:less extreme policies, suggesting that it is harder for a larger group to reach a consensus. This
23:767:59052:18:18:82:543:460:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:economic mechanism can explain why a smaller board is more associated with ZL policy. In an
23:768:59143:18:18:82:543:442:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:unreported analysis, we also find that lagged CEO and governance variables can predict firms’
23:769:59236:18:19:82:543:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:decisions to adopt and abandon ZL policy. For example, larger CEO ownership is associated with
23:770:59330:19:18:82:540:405:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a significantly higher chance of adopting and lower chance of abandoning a zero leverage status.
23:771:59426:18:18:99:543:387:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The governance story suggests that CEOs should find it easier to adopt a low-debt policy with
23:772:59519:18:19:82:543:369:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a more favorable board. Therefore, the effects of the CEO ownership and tenure are likely to be
23:773:59614:19:18:82:543:350:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:stronger when the board is smaller and less independent. Table X reports the results of the logit
23:774:59711:18:18:82:594:332:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:analysis where we include the interaction terms of board and CEO characteristics. Specifically,  [Table X
23:775:59816:18:18:553:543:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:here]we include the interactions of a board size dummy (where Small (Large) Board is defined as the
23:776:59915:18:19:82:543:296:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:board with the size below (above) the sample median) and a board independence dummy (where
23:777:60005:19:18:82:543:277:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Low (High) Independence is defined as the board with the fraction of independent directors below

23:779:60193:18:19:82:543:241:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:effects of CEO stock ownership and tenure are indeed mostly driven by observations where the
23:780:60285:19:18:82:267:222:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:boards are less independent and small.
23:781:60323:18:18:99:543:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:It is important to emphasize that, although the economic mechanisms underlying our intuition
23:782:60415:18:19:82:543:186:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are plausible, we cannot rule out the potential explanation that firms for which zero-leverage policy
23:783:60516:19:18:82:543:167:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is optimal (for as yet unknown to us reasons), choose CEOs and their compensation packages
23:784:60606:18:18:82:543:149:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:correspondingly. Our results in this section clearly indicate the need for further study of these
23:785:60703:18:0:82:349:131:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:economic mechanisms when additional data is available.
24:786:60793:0:30:82:319:680:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:III.C. Family Firms and Zero-Leverage Firms
24:787:60836:30:18:99:543:650:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The private benefits of control is another well-recognized dimension of agency costs. Large
24:788:60927:18:18:82:543:632:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:shareholders and founders may care more about the private benefits of control and their voting
24:789:61021:18:18:82:543:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rights. With respect to family firms, Becker (1981) and Bertrand and Schoar (2006) argue that
24:790:61114:18:19:82:543:596:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:family members can be altruistic in the sense that they can derive utility from maintaining the
24:791:61209:19:18:82:543:577:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:family legacy or the well being of other family members. Taken together, CEOs of family firms
24:792:61302:18:18:82:396:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:may be particularly averse to risks posed by the presence of debt.
24:793:61368:18:19:99:543:541:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:To shed light on this issue, we use a hand-collected dataset that contains family firm status
24:794:61461:19:18:82:543:522:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for S&P 1500 firms over the 2003–2006 period.27The definition of a family firm follows that
24:795:61552:18:18:82:543:504:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of Anderson and Reeb (2003), Villalonga and Amit (2006), and Li, Wang, and Ryan (2011).
24:796:61639:18:18:82:543:486:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Specifically, a family firm is one in which the founder or any family member of the founding
24:797:61731:18:19:82:543:468:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:family is a director, an officer, or owns 5% or more of the outstanding equity.  Our resulting
24:798:61825:19:18:82:476:449:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sample consists of 4,010 firm-year observations for 1,457 unique firms over 4 years.
24:799:61909:18:18:99:543:431:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:As Table XI reports, a family firm is significantly more likely to use debt conservatively. At
24:800:62003:18:19:82:543:413:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the same time, most of related corporate governance variables remain significant (apart from the
24:801:62099:19:18:82:598:394:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:board independence). Even after controlling for other variables, family firms are 7% more likely  [Table XI
24:802:62206:18:18:553:543:376:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:here]to pursue zero-leverage policy than non-family firms.28Given the limited availability of data on
24:803:62307:18:18:82:543:358:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:family status in our sample, a broader study of the impact of family firms can shed more light on
24:804:62404:18:36:82:377:340:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:their relation with other CEO and governance characteristics.
24:805:62465:36:29:239:387:304:12:g_d0_f5:12:g_d0_f5:?:IV.  Concluding Remarks
24:806:62488:29:18:99:543:275:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:This paper documents the puzzling evidence that a substantial number of large public non-
24:807:62577:18:18:82:543:257:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:financial US firms follow a zero-debt policy. Using the Compustat data set we find that, over
24:808:62670:18:19:82:543:239:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the 1962–2003 period, on average 10.2% of such firms have zero leverage and almost 22% have
24:809:62761:19:18:82:543:220:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a less than 5% book leverage ratio.  Neither industry nor size can fully explain such puzzling
24:810:62855:18:18:82:543:202:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:behavior. Particularly surprising evidence is the presence of a large number of zero-leverage firms
24:811:62954:18:19:82:543:184:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:who pay dividends. Zero-leverage dividend-paying firms are more profitable, pay higher taxes,
24:812:63047:19:18:82:543:165:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and have higher cash balances than their proxies chosen by industry and size. These firms also
24:813:63141:18:16:82:543:147:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:pay substantially higher dividends than their proxies and thus the total payout ratio is relatively
24:814:63240:16:15:91:543:131:6:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f11:F:27We thank Harley R. Ryan for generously sharing the data with us. See Li, Wang, and Ryan (2011) for a detailed
24:815:63351:15:7:82:176:116:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:description of the data.
24:816:63375:7:14:91:543:109:6:g_d0_f10:9:g_d0_f11:F:28Consistent with the intuition that family members care about survival, ZL firms on average survive by about
24:817:63484:14:0:82:274:95:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:13% (10 months) longer than their proxy firms.
25:818:63566:0:19:82:197:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:independent of leverage.
25:819:63590:19:18:99:543:661:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Were they to lever up to the level of their proxies, zero-leverage dividend-paying firms would
25:820:63684:18:18:82:542:643:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:save about 7% of the market equity value in a conservative scenario. Nevertheless, zero-leverage
25:821:63780:18:19:82:543:625:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:policy is found to be persistent over the long term. Firms with large CEO ownership and more
25:822:63872:19:18:82:543:606:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:CEO-friendly boards are more likely to end up being zero-levered. Family firms are also more
25:823:63964:18:18:82:543:588:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:likely to pursue zero-leverage policies.  Overall, our results suggest that CEO and governance
25:824:64058:18:18:82:543:570:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:features of firms are important determinants of the zero-leverage phenomena.  More research
25:825:64149:18:19:82:542:552:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that further explores these relationships will be helpful for our understanding of the zero-leverage
25:826:64249:19:35:82:276:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:puzzle and debt conservatism in general.

32:1096:78485:22:13:82:551:629:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:This table reports the descriptive statistics for ZL/AZL firms and their proxy firms.  ZL firms
32:1097:78580:13:14:82:550:616:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are firms that have zero book debt in a given year. AZL firms are firms with book leverage not
32:1098:78674:14:13:82:550:602:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:exceeding 5% in a given year. The selection procedure of proxy firms is described in Section I.B.2.
32:1099:78773:13:14:82:550:589:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:All variables are defined in Appendix B. Panel A reports statistics for all ZL/AZL firms and their
32:1100:78871:14:14:82:550:575:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:proxy firms. Panel B reports the same statistics for dividend-paying (DP) ZL/AZL firms and Panel
32:1101:78967:14:13:82:550:561:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:C for zero-dividend (ZD) ZL/AZL firms. The statistics of ZL/AZL firms are obtained by taking
32:1102:79059:13:14:82:550:548:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:first means for firms in each year and then averaging over all years. To compute proxy statistics,
32:1103:79157:14:13:82:550:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:proxy firms for each ZL/AZL observation are first equally weighted, then means are taken for each
32:1104:79254:13:14:82:550:521:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:year, assigning equal weight to each set of proxy firms, and then means are averaged over all years.
32:1105:79354:14:13:82:550:507:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Thet-statistic is obtained by applying the Fama-MacBeth procedure to the time-series of annual
32:1106:79448:13:14:82:550:494:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:averages. The absolute value of a positive (negative)sigis the number of years in which there is a
32:1107:79546:14:13:82:550:480:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:significant positive (negative) difference (at 5% level) between ZL/AZL firms and proxy firms. The
32:1108:79644:13:18:82:492:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:‘All’ columns give the means for the total sample (all DP (ZD) firms in Panel B (C)).
