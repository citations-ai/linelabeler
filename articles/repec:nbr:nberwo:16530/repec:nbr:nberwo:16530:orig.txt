2:32:1767:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:We study the characteristics of self-selected candidates in corrupt political systems. Potential candidates
2:33:1874:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:differ along two dimensions of unobservable character: public spirit (altruism toward others) and honesty
2:34:1979:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:(the disutility suffered when selling out to special interests after securing office). Both aspects combine
2:35:2086:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to determine an individual's quality as governor. We characterize properties of equilibrium candidate
2:36:2187:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:pools for arbitrary costs of running for office, including the case where those costs become vanishingly
2:37:2291:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:small. We explore how policy instruments such as the governor's compensation and anti-corruption
2:38:2387:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:enforcement affect the expected quality of governance through candidate self-selection. We also show
2:39:2487:14:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that self-selection can have surprising implications for the effect of information disclosures concerning
2:40:2592:14:42:72:192:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:candidates' backgrounds.

3:55:3047:52:35:72:208:620:296:g_d0_f3:296:g_d0_f3:1  Introduction
3:56:3062:35:18:72:540:585:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:According to one long-standing and widespread view, representative democracies suffer from
3:57:3152:18:18:72:540:567:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:a pernicious adverse selection problem: the citizens who are best suited to govern are least
3:58:3244:18:18:72:540:549:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:likely to seek office.  Drawing on the citizen-candidate models of representative democracy
3:59:3335:18:18:72:540:531:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:due toBesley and Coate(1997)andOsborne and Slivinski(1996), a recent and growing
3:60:3415:18:18:72:540:513:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:literature has examined the nature of candidate self-selection with respect to ability or com-
3:61:3509:18:18:72:540:495:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:petence.1Yet concerns over adverse self-selection extend beyond candidates’ abilities, to
3:62:3598:18:18:71:539:477:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:questions of character. As the political scientist V.O. Key quipped, “If the people can only
3:63:3690:18:18:71:540:459:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:choose among rascals, they are certain to choose a rascal.”(Key,1966) Some commentators
3:64:3777:18:18:71:539:441:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:attribute the purported prevalence of rascals among politicians to special interest groups,
3:65:3868:18:18:71:539:423:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:suggesting that they sully the political process and attract those of low character while
3:66:3957:18:23:71:252:405:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:discouraging those with conscience.
3:67:3992:23:18:97:540:382:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:It is not obvious, however, that one should expect negative rather than positive can-
3:68:4077:18:18:71:539:364:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:didate self-selection along all pertinent dimensions of character.  On the one hand, office-
3:69:4169:18:18:71:539:346:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:holding provides opportunities for personal rent-seeking at the expense of the public good,
3:70:4260:18:18:71:539:328:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:which are presumably more attractive to selfish than public-spirited citizens.  But on the
3:71:4350:18:18:71:539:310:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:one hand, the opportunities to promote the greater good that accompany office-holding are
3:72:4439:18:24:71:451:292:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:presumably more attractive to public-spirited citizens than to selfish ones.
3:73:4515:24:18:97:540:268:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:The literature on candidate self-selection has largely ignored questions of character (we
3:74:4604:18:18:71:539:250:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:discuss exceptions later).  In this paper, we study candidate self-selection with respect to
3:75:4696:18:18:71:539:232:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:two dimensions of character:public spirit, which is defined as altruism toward other citizens,
3:76:4790:18:18:71:540:214:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:andhonesty, which is defined as susceptibility to corruption.  Those two characteristics
3:77:4878:18:18:71:539:196:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:impact thequality of governance, defined as the net benefit the representative citizen derives
3:78:4972:18:18:71:539:178:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:from the public sector.  In our model, citizens who run for office may hope to benefit from
3:79:5063:18:17:71:539:160:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:both legitimate compensation (salary and ego-rents) and illicit compensation (contributions
3:80:5154:17:19:71:539:143:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:or bribes from interest groups).   They bear campaign costs and, if elected, effort costs
3:81:5243:19:16:85:540:124:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:1See, e.g.,Caselli and Morelli(2004),Messner and Polborn(2004),Dal B ́oetal.(2006),Poutvaara and
3:82:5339:16:0:72:303:108:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:Takalo(2007), andMattozzi and Merlo(2008,2010).
4:83:5387:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:associated with producing public goods.  Each citizen also recognizes that, if elected, his
4:84:5478:18:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:character will impact the quality of governance and hence general welfare. Character affects
4:85:5570:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the tradeoffs between these costs and benefits.  However, a candidate’s character is not
4:86:5658:18:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:observed by the electorate (at least not initially).  Thus, having a better character than
4:87:5748:18:24:72:300:636:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:one’s opponents does not guarantee election.
4:88:5792:24:18:97:540:612:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A central feature of our model is that, as a consequence of the competing considerations
4:89:5880:18:18:72:540:594:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:noted in the previous paragraph, the incentive to run for office is a U-shaped function of
4:90:5970:18:18:72:540:576:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:public spirit. Moreover, dishonest citizens extract greater rents from holding office because
4:91:6063:18:18:72:540:558:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:of special interest politics. As a result, the citizens with the greatest incentive to run for office
4:92:6164:18:18:72:540:540:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:are those who are maximally dishonest, and either maximally or minimally public-spirited.
4:93:6253:18:24:72:427:522:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:This property has important implications for candidate self-selection.
4:94:6323:24:18:97:540:498:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:We find that for any given number of candidates, the set of equilibrium candidate pools
4:95:6410:18:17:72:540:480:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:(when non-empty) is typically characterized by non-trivial lower and upper bounds on the
4:96:6498:17:18:72:539:463:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:expected quality of governance.2Candidates tend to be ofmediocre quality: neither too
4:97:6583:18:18:72:540:445:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:good, because opponents would then drop out, nor too bad, because others would then
4:98:6666:18:18:72:540:427:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:enter. Note that the upper bound obtains without assuming a positive correlation between
4:99:6754:18:18:72:540:409:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:a citizen’s quality and his outside market option; rather, in our model, all individuals have
4:100:6847:18:18:72:540:391:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the same outside option.  Indeed, because our focus is on citizens’ character rather than
4:101:6936:18:18:72:540:373:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:competence, it is not clear that higher quality should be positively correlated with better
4:102:7027:18:24:72:217:355:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:private sector opportunities.
4:103:7056:24:18:97:540:331:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:The bounds on average candidate quality yield a negative correlation between public-
4:104:7140:18:18:72:540:313:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:spiritedness and honesty among candidates, even when these characteristics are uncorrelated
4:105:7231:18:18:72:540:295:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:in the population. Equilibria may be either symmetric (with candidates of identical or sim-
4:106:7322:18:18:72:540:277:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:ilar quality running for office) or asymmetric (with candidates of sharply different quality),
4:107:7416:18:18:72:539:259:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:but in some casesallequilibria with a given number of candidates are asymmetric.  This
4:108:7502:18:17:72:540:241:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:is a consequence of the U-shaped entry incentives noted earlier. Thus, the model generates
4:109:7592:17:24:72:329:224:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:endogenousvolatilityin the quality of governance.
4:110:7641:24:18:97:540:200:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:We investigate the effects of changes in two public policy instruments: the governor’s
4:111:7727:18:18:72:540:182:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:compensation and the level of anti-corruption enforcement.  The effects of these policies on
4:112:7819:18:18:72:540:164:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the costs and benefits of holding office depend on a candidate’s character; hence, beyond any
4:113:7912:18:18:72:540:146:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:incentive effects once in office, the policies alter the composition of the self-selected candidate
4:114:8011:18:16:85:539:128:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:2The number of candidates will be endogenously determined, but one must first understand the properties
4:115:8114:16:0:72:279:112:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:of candidate pools taking this number as given.
5:116:8162:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:pool. As the set of equilibria for a given number of candidates tends to be large (when it is
5:117:8255:18:24:72:493:690:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:non-empty), we focus on the comparative statics for the best and worst equilibria.
5:118:8337:24:18:97:540:666:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:For equilibria with a given number of candidates, the expected quality of governance
5:119:8421:18:18:72:540:648:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:in the best equilibria rises with the level of the governor’s compensation, but does not im-
5:120:8513:18:18:72:540:630:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:prove, and may even decline, with the level of anti-corruption enforcement. Subject to some
5:121:8604:18:18:72:540:612:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:qualifications, the quality of governance in the worst equilibria typically improves when the
5:122:8697:18:18:72:540:594:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:governor’s compensation rises, but declines when anti-corruption enforcement becomes more
5:123:8786:18:18:72:540:576:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:vigorous. Thus, focusing on equilibria with any fixed number of candidates, higher compen-
5:124:8876:18:18:72:540:558:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:sation tends to promote good governance, while anti-corruption enforcement is surprisingly
5:125:8966:18:18:72:540:540:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:counterproductive (and at best ineffective). The latter result holds even though enforcement
5:126:9058:18:18:72:540:522:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:reduces the degree to which any given governor would make concessions to special interests;
5:127:9149:18:24:72:530:504:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:it turns out that perverse selection effects overwhelm the beneficial pure incentive effects.
5:128:9242:24:17:97:540:480:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Apart from certain exceptional points in the policy space, the comparative static results
5:129:9331:17:18:72:540:463:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:described in the previous paragraph also hold locally for theoverallbest and worst equilibria
5:130:9424:18:18:72:540:445:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:(i.e., without fixing the number of candidates).  At the exceptional points, policy changes
5:131:9515:18:18:72:540:427:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:alter the sizes of candidate pools for which equilibria exist, bringing additional effects into
5:132:9610:18:18:72:540:409:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:play.  Specifically, if the number of candidates in the overall best or worst equilibrium also
5:133:9704:18:18:72:540:391:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:changes at such a point, overall quality can jump discontinuously.  As a general matter, an
5:134:9795:18:18:72:539:373:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:increase in the number of candidates tends to generatedetrimentalselection effects: from the
5:135:9887:18:18:72:540:355:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:perspective of selection, the fewer candidates the better.  It follows that, for our two policy
5:136:9982:18:18:72:540:337:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:variables at the aforementioned exceptional points, these effects tend to work in the opposite
5:137:10076:18:18:72:540:319:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:direction from those discussed in the previous paragraph. Thus, when the policy parameters
5:138:10166:18:18:72:540:301:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:pass through the exceptional points, the overall effects of the governor’s compensation and
5:139:10257:18:24:72:484:283:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:anti-corruption enforcement on the quality of governance reflect opposing forces.
5:140:10338:24:18:97:540:259:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:As the costs of running for office become vanishingly small (a common assumption in
5:141:10421:18:17:72:540:241:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the “citizen-candidate” literature), multiple-candidate equilibria converge to an essentially
5:142:10514:17:18:72:540:224:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:unique limiting equilibrium, which we characterize.  This equilibrium consists of citizens
5:143:10604:18:18:72:540:206:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:with the greatest incentives to run for office, who effectively crowd out all other types of
5:144:10696:18:18:72:540:188:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:candidates.  Typically, there is a bimodal distribution of character: all of the candidates
5:145:10787:18:18:72:540:170:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:are maximally dishonest, but, due to the U-shaped entry incentives noted above, there is
5:146:10875:18:18:72:540:152:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:a mixture of those with maximal and minimal public spirit.  In other words, with small
5:147:10961:18:18:72:539:134:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:costs of running for office, typicallyonly highly asymmetric equilibria survive; the model
5:148:11051:18:44:72:540:116:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:then has the strong implication that there is no variability in the predictable (dis)honesty of
5:149:11146:44:0:303:309:72:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:3
6:150:11147:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:politicians, but substantial variability in the quality of governance through volatility in the
6:151:11242:18:24:72:284:690:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:public-spiritedness of the electoral victor.
6:152:11286:24:18:97:540:666:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:For the limiting multiple-candidate equilibrium, we show that an increase in anti-
6:153:11368:18:18:72:540:648:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:corruption enforcement unambiguously improves the quality of governance.   While this
6:154:11453:18:18:72:540:630:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:finding is consistent with simple intuition, the mechanism is surprising: for a wide range
6:155:11543:18:18:72:540:612:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:of parameter values, anti-corruption enforcement is on balance beneficial only because it
6:156:11632:18:18:72:539:594:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:reduces the number of candidates in equilibrium, therebyindirectlyimproving selection. In
6:157:11721:18:18:72:539:576:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:contrast, an increase in the governor’s compensation hasno overall effect, either beneficial
6:158:11813:18:24:72:373:558:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:or adverse; in other words, salary is surprisingly irrelevant.
6:159:11875:24:18:97:540:534:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:As an extension of the model, we also allow for the possibility that candidates may have
6:160:11963:18:18:72:540:516:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:different track records and/or reputations.  We find that as long as this information is not
6:161:12055:18:18:72:540:498:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:conclusive in a sense we make precise, changes in the information structure have no effect
6:162:12145:18:17:72:540:480:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:on the set of equilibrium outcomes.  This neutrality result has surprising implications for
6:163:12236:17:18:72:540:463:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:public policy. First, positive short-term effects of information disclosures on voters’ choices,
6:164:12332:18:18:72:540:445:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:documented for example byFerraz and Finan(2008)andBanerjee et al.(2010,2011), can
6:165:12413:18:18:72:540:427:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:be neutralized by self-selection effects once such disclosures are institutionalized.  Second,
6:166:12507:18:18:72:540:409:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:elections for lower office in decentralized democracies—which provide opportunities for es-
6:167:12598:18:18:72:540:391:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:tablishing track records and reputations—need not necessarily improve electoral outcomes
6:168:12686:18:24:72:499:373:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:for higher office by filtering the set of candidates (cf.Cooter,2003;Myerson,2006).
6:169:12769:24:18:97:540:349:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:We are not the first to study political self-selection with respect to any aspect of can-
6:170:12858:18:18:72:539:331:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:didate character (as opposed to competence).Caselli and Morelli(2001)—the working
6:171:12939:18:18:72:539:313:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:paper version ofCaselli and Morelli(2004)—andBesley(2004) consider models in which
6:172:13021:18:18:72:540:295:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:citizens choose to run for office based on a characteristic which one can interpret as hon-
6:173:13112:18:18:72:540:277:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:esty.3Neither of these papers studies selection with respect to public-spiritedness, which
6:174:13202:18:18:72:540:259:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:is central to our analysis.  Both conclude that higher compensation improves the quality of
6:175:13293:18:17:72:539:241:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the candidate pool—a result our model doesnotreplicate for small entry costs—but neither
6:176:13381:17:18:72:539:224:143:g_d0_f2:64:g_d0_f4:explicitly models special-interest influence activities or studies anti-corruption enforcement.4

6:181:13877:12:12:72:540:154:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:The empirical evidence on this issue is mixed: using data from Brazlian municipal elections,Ferraz and Finan
6:182:13985:12:12:72:539:142:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:(2010) suggest that higher salaries do attract somewhat more educated and more experienced candidates;
6:183:14087:12:12:72:539:130:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:on the other hand, in their study of the European Parliament,Fisman et al.(2012) find that higher salaries
6:184:14193:12:12:72:540:118:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:reduce of fraction of parliamentarians who attended highly-ranked colleges. Both studies agree, however,
6:185:14297:12:0:72:362:106:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:that higher salaries lead to larger numbers of candidates for office.
7:186:14367:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Their analyses of self-selection with respect to honesty also involve very different mechanisms
7:187:14462:18:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:than the one examined here, and these differences account for our contrasting conclusions

7:193:14947:18:18:72:543:576:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:concerned with the interest groups’ choice between violence and bribes (see alsoDal B ́oand

7:196:15218:18:18:72:540:522:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:lead to more dishonest individuals selecting into politics. They also find empirically that
7:197:15309:18:18:72:540:504:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:higher levels of immunity generate more corruption from those in office; see alsoFisman and

7:204:15858:51:36:72:194:340:296:g_d0_f3:296:g_d0_f3:2  The Model
7:205:15870:36:18:72:540:304:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:We consider a society consisting of a continuum of citizens.  Each citizen consumes two
7:206:15957:18:18:72:539:286:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:goods, a public goodxand a private goodr.  For convenience, each citizen’s endowment
7:207:16041:18:18:72:540:268:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:of the private good is normalized to zero.  Citizens differ with respect to two preference
7:208:16131:18:18:72:539:250:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:parameters: an altruism or public spirit parametera∈[0,1], and an honesty parameter
7:209:16214:18:18:72:540:232:143:g_d0_f8:143:g_d0_f2:h∈[0,1].  The public spirit parameter,a, measures the degree to which a citizen cares
7:210:16299:18:16:85:539:214:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:5In Caselli and Morelli’s model, dishonest candidates successfully run for office when the supply of honest
7:211:16406:16:12:72:540:198:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:candidates is insufficient to fill all available positions. Because the quality of governance is assumed to reflect
7:212:16521:12:12:72:540:186:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:the combined decisions of a continuum of office holders, honest candidates are not motivated by the desire
7:213:16627:12:12:72:540:174:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:to displace dishonest office holders, as they are in our model.  Besley’s assumptions concerning candidates’
7:214:16735:12:12:72:540:162:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:payoffs likewise remove any incentive to displace dissonant office holders.  Furthermore, he assumes that
7:215:16840:12:12:72:540:150:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:the costs of running for office are zero, rather than vanishingly small.  As a result, the pool of candidates
7:216:16949:12:12:72:540:138:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:does not consist of the citizens with the greatest incentives to run for office, as it does in our model. If the
7:217:17061:12:12:72:540:126:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:costs of running for office were vanishingly small rather than zero, all candidates would be dissonants with
7:218:17169:12:12:72:540:114:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:poor private-sector prospects, and as in our framework, compensation would have no impact on the quality
7:219:17273:12:0:72:150:102:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:of candidate pool.

8:221:17382:18:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:if a citizen holds office; it determines the size of a utility penalty the individual suffers if he
8:222:17481:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:accepts payments from special interests.  The magnitude ofhcould reflect susceptibility to
8:223:17571:18:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:pangs of conscience, aversion to social stigma or penalties, or skill at evading detection. We

8:229:18080:18:40:72:540:540:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:number of candidates is finite and the probability of winning for any candidate is non-zero.
8:230:18172:40:18:72:540:500:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f2:Governance.One citizen eventually becomes governor through a process explained below.
8:231:18257:18:18:72:539:482:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:The governor receives compensations, which includes a salary and any ego benefits/costs
8:232:18344:18:18:72:540:464:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:from holding office.6He exerts efforte≥0toproducef(e)≥0 units of the public good
8:233:18424:18:18:71:540:446:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:at a personal costc(e), where bothf(·)andc(·) are twice-differentiable functions.7Effort
8:234:18512:18:18:72:539:428:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:has positive but declining marginal returns (f->0>f--), as well as positive and increasing
8:235:18602:18:18:72:540:410:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:marginal costs (c->0andc-->0).  For the usual reasons, we also assumef(0) =c(0) = 0,
8:236:18686:18:18:72:539:392:143:g_d0_f8:143:g_d0_f2:f-(0)>c-(0), and lime→∞c-(e)=∞. In addition to producing the public good, the governor
8:237:18772:18:18:72:539:374:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:must decide whether to undertake a highly inefficient special-interest project (z= 1 denotes
8:238:18864:18:18:72:539:356:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:yes,z= 0 denotes no) which provides concentrated benefits to a small special-interest group
8:239:18955:18:18:72:540:338:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:(as described further momentarily) at a non-negligble cost to every citizen.  In particular,
8:240:19047:18:18:72:539:320:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:if implemented, the project is funded by a per-capita lump-sum tax,q>0, levied on all
8:241:19132:18:40:72:235:302:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:citizens, including the governor.
8:242:19165:40:18:72:539:262:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f2:Special Interests.There is one special interest group or lobby, denotedL.  The lobby’s
8:243:19251:18:18:72:540:244:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:constituency consists of a small group of citizens which, for simplicity, we take to be of
8:244:19341:18:18:72:539:226:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:negligible size relative to the entire population.8These constituents receive a total payoff
8:245:19433:18:18:72:539:208:143:g_d0_f8:143:g_d0_f8:v≥0 if the governor choosesz= 1, and zero ifz= 0.  After the governor is elected,v
8:246:19515:18:18:72:544:190:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:is drawn from a cumulative distribution Φ(v) with support [0,v] and densityφ(v)>0for
8:247:19599:18:16:85:539:172:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:6Because there is a continuum of citizens, the per capita costs of the governor’s compensation is infinites-
8:248:19707:16:8:72:375:156:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:simal, and hence it does not require a strictly positive per capita tax.
8:249:19779:8:16:85:539:148:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:7For simplicity, the level of expenditure on the public good is taken as fixed, so that the governor’s
8:250:19881:16:12:72:540:132:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:effort is the only variable input.  Any positive expenditure on the public good requires a tax, but since the
8:251:19990:12:8:72:404:120:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:expenditure (and hence the tax) is fixed, we can suppress it in the notation.
8:252:20067:8:0:85:386:112:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:8Another interpretation is that the lobby represents foreign interests.
9:253:20139:0:18:72:539:708:143:g_d0_f8:143:g_d0_f2:v∈[0,v].Lcan attempt to influence the governor by negotiating a payment to him,t≥0,
9:254:20222:18:18:71:540:690:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:contingent on choosingz= 1.  Agreeing to a contingent payment triggers a utility penalty
9:255:20310:18:18:72:544:672:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:on the governor ofg(h, σ)≥0.  The penalty depends upon the governor’s honesty,h,as
9:256:20392:18:18:71:539:654:143:g_d0_f2:64:g_d0_f4:well as a policy variable,σ∈[0,σ], which captures the level of anti-corruption enforcement.9
9:257:20484:18:18:72:540:636:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:We assumegis twice continuously differentiable withgh>0andgσ>0, where subscripts
9:258:20564:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:denote partial derivatives. Thus, higher levels of honesty and anti-corruption enforcement
9:259:20654:18:24:72:420:600:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:imply higher costs to the governor of selling out to special interests.
9:260:20725:24:18:97:540:576:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:For simplicity, we assume that the contingent transfer,t, is determined by generalized
9:261:20811:18:18:72:540:558:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Nash bargaining between the governor and the lobby. (Other models of lobbying yield similar
9:262:20902:18:18:72:540:540:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:results.) Specifically, the governor extracts the fractionα>0 of any bilateral surplus from
9:263:20993:18:18:72:540:522:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the project. Implicitly, this assumption presupposes that prior to negotiating the contingent
9:264:21086:18:18:72:540:504:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:payment, the lobby learns not only the stakes (v) but also the governor’s true character
9:265:21174:18:17:72:539:486:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:(a, h), perhaps from their interaction after the governor takes office.  Complete information
9:266:21267:17:18:72:540:469:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:between the lobby and the governor simplifies the bargaining problem but is not critical;
9:267:21356:18:18:72:540:451:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:our analysis requires only that more honest governors receive smaller benefits from special
9:268:21447:18:24:72:495:433:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:interest interactions, which is a property that will hold in a wide range of settings.
9:269:21533:24:18:97:540:409:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Special interest activities are limited to lobbying. Members of the special interest group
9:270:21623:18:18:72:540:391:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:do not run for office, and the lobby sponsors no candidates. While it would be of interest
9:271:21713:18:18:72:540:373:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:to investigate these other types of special interest activities, such an inquiry is beyond the
9:272:21807:18:41:72:539:355:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:scope of the current paper; we make some pertinent observations in the concluding section.
9:273:21897:41:18:72:545:314:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f2:Net Payoffs.We assume that a citizeni’s preferences are represented by the (von Neumann-
9:274:21985:18:18:72:222:296:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Morgenstern) utility function
9:275:22014:18:25:249:540:278:143:g_d0_f8:143:g_d0_f2:Ui(·)=ui(·)+aiuc(·),(1)
9:276:22037:25:18:72:540:253:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:whereuiisi’s utility from personal consumption of private and public goods,ucis the
9:277:22120:18:18:72:540:235:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:utility from personal consumption of the average (non-candidate) citizen, andaiisi’s public
9:278:22211:18:18:72:539:217:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:spiritedness characteristic.10Our central results hold generally for altruistic preferences
9:279:22302:18:16:85:539:199:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:9For simplicity, we assume that more aggressive anti-corruption enforcement involves the redeployment
9:280:22403:16:12:72:540:183:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:of otherwise slack government resources (financed by a fixed tax, suppressed in the notation), and hence is
9:281:22510:12:12:72:540:171:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:costless.  Adding a direct cost (and hence a variable tax) changes nothing of consequence; in that case, the
9:282:22618:12:8:72:467:159:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:benefits of more aggressive enforcement (if any) must simply be weighed against the costs.
9:283:22708:8:16:81:539:151:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:10Even though citizens are altruistic, the payoffs of candidates and the governor do not show up in a
9:284:22809:16:12:72:540:135:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:typical citizen’s utility function, because those individuals are of measure zero. Likewise, we do not include
9:285:22919:12:11:72:540:123:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:the special interest group’s payoff in any citizen’s utility, because the interest group is assumed to have
9:286:23026:11:0:72:405:112:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:constituents of measure zero (and the governor himself is not a constituent).
10:287:23104:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:belonging to this broad and widely-studied class (cf.fn. 17),11but to ease exposition we
10:288:23192:18:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:adopt a simple functional form forui(·). Specifically, lettingr=−zqdenote the level of
10:289:23278:18:33:72:524:672:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:private good consumption for non-candidate citizens,12assume that for any individuali,
10:290:23364:33:33:213:540:639:143:g_d0_f8:143:g_d0_f2:Ui(x, ri,r;ai)=(x+ri)+ai(x+r).(2)
10:291:23397:33:18:71:540:606:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f8:For a non-candidate citizeni,ri=r=−zq, and henceUi(x, ri,r;ai)=(1+ai)(x−zq); ifi
10:292:23477:18:24:72:539:588:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:is a losing candidate,ri=r−k=−zq−k, and henceUi(x, ri,r;ai)=(1+ai)(x−zq)−k.
10:293:23552:24:18:97:540:564:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:This formulation implicitly assumes that all candidates have identical outside options.
10:294:23639:18:18:72:540:546:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Unlike ability, characteristics such as honesty and public spiritedness create both advantages
10:295:23733:18:17:72:540:528:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and disadvantages in the private sector, and it is not obvious whether they render the outside
10:296:23827:17:18:72:540:511:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:option more or less attractive. Systematic variation in potential private sector compensation
10:297:23920:18:24:72:489:493:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:would, of course, skew the candidate pool toward types with inferior alternatives.
10:298:24002:24:18:97:539:469:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:We will use the indexGto denote the governor. IfGdoes not accept payments from
10:299:24080:18:18:72:539:451:143:g_d0_f8:143:g_d0_f2:L(so thatz= 0), his payoff takes the same form as that of a losing candidate, except that
10:300:24169:18:18:72:539:433:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:he receives compensation,s, and incurs the disutility of effort,c(e), to produce the public
10:301:24260:18:18:72:540:415:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:good. IfGaccepts a paymentt≥0fromL(so thatz= 1), he also receivestand incurs a
10:302:24338:18:33:71:404:397:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:utility penaltyg(hG,σ).  Thus, the governor’s utility is given by:
10:303:24404:33:0:124:408:364:143:g_d0_f8:143:g_d0_f8:UG(x, rG,r,e;aG)=(1+aG)(x−zq)−k+s−c(e)+z

10:305:24445:10:0:416:477:364:143:g_d0_f8:143:g_d0_f2:t−g(hG,σ)

10:307:24455:10:38:484:540:364:143:g_d0_f8:143:g_d0_f2:.(3)
10:308:24459:38:28:97:362:326:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Throughout, we maintain the following assumption:
10:309:24508:28:34:72:510:298:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f5:Assumption 1.The distribution of character(a, h)has full support on[0,1]×[0,1].
10:310:24587:34:18:97:540:264:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Note that we make no assumption about correlation or lack thereof between honesty and
10:311:24672:18:18:71:539:246:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:public spirit. Candidates of the four extreme types will play significant roles in our analysis:
10:312:24768:18:18:71:539:228:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:those with maximal public spirit and maximal honesty,a=h=1(Saints); those with
10:313:24846:18:18:71:539:210:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:minimal public spirit and minimal honesty,a=h=0(Scoundrels); those with maximal
10:314:24925:18:18:71:539:192:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:public spirit and minimal honesty (Sell-Outs); and those with minimal public spirit and
10:315:25012:18:18:71:268:174:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:maximal honesty (Principled Egoists).
10:316:25049:18:16:81:539:156:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:11The use of a simple weighted average of own- and other-utility has a long tradition in economics (see,
10:317:25153:16:12:72:540:140:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:e.g.Barro and Becker,1989), and is now standard (see, e.g.Levine,1998). Our results can be generalized
10:318:25255:12:8:72:386:128:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:to an even broader class of utility functions under suitable assumptions.
10:319:25328:8:16:81:539:120:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:12Recall that we normalized private good endowment to 0 and the special-interest project is funded by a
10:320:25431:16:0:72:155:104:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:per-capita tax ofq.
11:321:25451:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f2:Candidates and elections.We assume that onlypolitical insidershave the opportunity
11:322:25533:18:18:72:539:690:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:to run for office.13The distribution of insiders’ characteristics is representative of the
11:323:25623:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:population and has full support on the character space, [0,1]×[0,1].  The mass of insiders
11:324:25713:18:18:71:539:654:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:is negligible, so the election is determined bypolitical outsiders, who share the objective of
11:325:25807:18:18:72:540:636:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:maximizingx+r. As detailed below, we distinguish between insiders and outsiders so that
11:326:25894:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:we can make different assumptions concerning the knowledge of (potential) candidates and
11:327:25982:18:24:72:184:600:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:that of the electorate.
11:328:26005:24:18:97:540:576:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:It is natural to assume that outsiders know rather little about the character of any
11:329:26089:18:18:72:540:558:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:yet-to-be-elected insider; for the sake of simplicity we assume that they are completely un-
11:330:26181:18:18:72:540:540:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:informed in that regard. In keeping with the citizen-candidate approach, candidates cannot
11:331:26271:18:17:72:540:522:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:differentiate themselves by commiting to either effort or project choices before they take
11:332:26361:17:18:72:540:505:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:office, and cannot signal their character during the electoral process.14Because candi-
11:333:26448:18:18:72:540:487:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:dates appear identical to the electorateex ante, we make the following stylized assumption
11:334:26538:18:27:72:238:469:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:concerning the electoral process:
11:335:26571:27:33:72:455:442:143:g_d0_f3:64:g_d0_f4:Assumption 2.Every candidate wins the election with equal probability.15
11:336:26643:33:18:97:540:409:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:This assumption ensures that there is no inherent advantage for candidates of one type
11:337:26729:18:18:71:539:391:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:or another during the election phase.  The assumption is compatible with outsiders voting
11:338:26818:18:18:71:539:373:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:on the basis of some idiosyncratic or even publicly observable shock, such as candidates’
11:339:26907:18:18:71:539:355:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:personalities or other valence attributes, so long as the distribution of voters’ idiosyncratic
11:340:27002:18:23:71:408:337:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:valuations is ex-ante identical across indistinguishable candidates.
11:341:27070:23:18:97:540:314:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:It is natural to assume that political insiders know more about each others’ character-
11:342:27157:18:18:71:539:296:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:istics (through professional reputations, past dealings, and explicit inquiries) than does the
11:343:27251:18:18:71:539:278:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:general public.  For tractability, we make the stark but directionally reasonable assump-
11:344:27340:18:18:71:539:260:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:tion that insiders can observe each others’ characters perfectly.  This greatly simplifies our
11:345:27434:18:17:71:429:242:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:analysis because the baseline game then entails complete information.
11:346:27503:17:16:81:539:225:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:13In democratic systems, even political outsiders can usually run for office.  However, viable candidates
11:347:27608:16:12:72:540:209:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:tend to become politically active before running for office.  One can think of the insiders in our model as
11:348:27715:12:8:72:111:197:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:activists.
11:349:27725:8:16:81:540:189:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:14In a Downsian model,Kartik and McAfee(2007) study the policy consequences of an exogenous set of
11:350:27823:16:8:72:340:173:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:candidates trying to signal character through their platforms.
11:351:27885:8:16:81:539:165:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:15Some care must be taken when the set of candidates is countably infinite, because one cannot define a
11:352:27988:16:12:72:540:149:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:uniform probability measure on a countably infinite space.  What is important for our purposes, however,
11:353:28092:12:12:72:540:137:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:is the probability with which any insider believes he will win the election if he runs, taking as given the
11:354:28199:12:12:72:540:125:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:set of other candidates.  We assume that this probability is zero when there is an infinite number of other
11:355:28306:12:12:72:540:113:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:candidates.  The actual probability measure governing the winner’s selection from the infinite number of
11:356:28410:12:0:72:179:101:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:candidates is inessential.
12:357:28437:0:31:72:327:708:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f2:Sequence of Events.Events unfold as follows:
12:358:28481:31:27:86:308:677:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:1. Insiders decide whether to run for office.
12:359:28526:27:18:86:540:650:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:2. The governor is elected through a simple lottery, and his character is observed by the
12:360:28615:18:18:101:540:632:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:lobby group and political outsiders. If there are no candidates, no governor is elected
12:361:28702:18:26:101:487:614:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and the quality of governance is assumed to be very low (as detailed later).
12:362:28778:26:18:86:540:588:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:3. The magnitude of lobbying stakes,v∈[0,v], is realized, and is observed by the governor
12:363:28867:18:18:101:540:570:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and the lobby group. The lobby then makes an offer to the governor, determined by
12:364:28948:18:27:101:248:552:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:generalized Nash bargaining.
12:365:28976:27:18:86:540:525:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:4. The governor chooses effort,e≥0, and makes a project implementation decision,
12:366:29056:18:30:101:311:507:143:g_d0_f8:143:g_d0_f2:z∈{0,1}, imposing any necessary taxes.
12:367:29094:30:51:97:404:477:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:We study the subgame perfect Nash equilibria of this game.

12:369:29180:35:18:72:540:391:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:In this section, we solve for post-electoral behavior, including the governor’s choices of
12:370:29270:18:18:72:540:373:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:whether to implement the special interest project and how much effort to expend toward
12:371:29356:18:18:72:540:355:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:producing the public good. For notational simplicity, in this section only we will usehand

12:373:29515:44:31:72:231:293:206:g_d0_f3:206:g_d0_f3:3.1  The Public Good
12:374:29535:31:18:72:540:262:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:The governor’s effort at producing the public good is determined solely by his public spirit,
12:375:29628:18:18:72:539:244:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and does not depend on his honesty or the special-interest transfer.16The optimal effort
12:376:29716:18:17:72:540:226:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:level,e∗(a), is given by the first order condition (1 +a)f-(e∗(a)) =c-(e∗(a)).  Sincefis
12:377:29804:17:18:72:544:209:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:strictly concave andcis strictly convex,e∗(·) is strictly increasing.  For every citizenj,let
12:378:29897:18:24:72:220:191:143:g_d0_f8:143:g_d0_f2:ej:=e∗(aj)andxj:=f(ej).
12:379:29920:24:33:97:511:167:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:The contribution of the public good to the well-being of the governor is given by
12:380:30001:33:17:211:540:134:143:g_d0_f8:143:g_d0_f2:π(a):=(1+a)f(e∗(a))−c(e∗(a)).(4)
12:381:30033:17:16:81:539:117:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:16This result follows from the assumed separability of utility. Our analysis only requires that the governor’s
12:382:30143:16:0:72:519:101:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:effort is increasing in his public spirit, which would also be the case under less restrictive assumptions.
13:383:30252:0:0:72:497:708:143:g_d0_f2:64:g_d0_f11:Bytheenvelopetheorem,π-(a)=f(e∗(a))>0.  Furthermore,π--(a)=f-(e∗(a))de

13:386:30331:13:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:i.e. the governor’s gain from providing the public good (measured as an equivalent variation
13:387:30423:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:in units of the private good) is aconvex functionof the public spirit parameter,a.  This
13:388:30511:18:18:71:539:654:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:convexity property will prove important, so it is essential to recognize that it does not rely
13:389:30605:18:18:71:539:636:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:on the particular functional form for preferences specified in (2). The intuition is transpar-
13:390:30699:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:ent: given preferences of the form (1), the envelope theorem implies that the derivative of
13:391:30790:18:18:72:540:600:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the governor’s utility with respect to his public spirit is just the utility of the average citi-
13:392:30887:18:18:72:540:582:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:zen evaluated using the governor’s optimal choices, and under mild conditions the average
13:393:30976:18:45:72:381:564:143:g_d0_f2:64:g_d0_f4:citizen’s utility is increasing in the governor’s public spirit.17
13:394:31042:45:31:72:309:519:206:g_d0_f3:206:g_d0_f3:3.2  The Special Interest Project
13:395:31075:31:18:72:540:488:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Ignoring any transfer from the interest group, implementing the special-interest project im-
13:396:31167:18:33:72:231:470:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:poses a cost on the governor of
13:397:31198:33:33:224:540:437:143:g_d0_f8:143:g_d0_f2:v∗(a, h, σ):=(1+a)q+g(h, σ).(5)
13:398:31229:33:18:71:539:404:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Nash bargaining implies that the project will be implemented if and only if it generates
13:399:31317:18:18:71:539:386:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:positive bilateral surplus forGandLcombined, which requiresv−v∗(a, h, σ)>0.18The
13:400:31397:18:24:72:513:368:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:governor receives the fractionαof any positive surplus, sot=αv+(1−α)v∗(a, h, σ).
13:401:31477:24:18:97:540:344:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Sincev∗(a, h, σ) is increasing in each argument, governors who are more public spirited
13:402:31564:18:18:71:539:326:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and more honest are less likely to accept special interest payments, and the frequency with
13:403:31655:18:17:71:539:308:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:which any governor sells out declines with the level of anti-corruption enforcement.  Thus,
13:404:31746:17:18:71:539:291:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:one might expect anti-corruption enforcement to improve the quality of governance; we will
13:405:31836:18:24:71:304:273:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:see, however, that matters are more complex.
13:406:31880:24:22:97:353:249:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Throughout, we impose the following assumption:
13:407:31927:22:16:81:540:227:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:17More formally, suppose that any citizeni’s personal utility can be written asu1(x, ei)+u2(ri,zihi)
13:408:32027:16:12:72:539:211:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:and his overall utility is given by (1). Note that hereeiandzirefer respectively to the effort exerted by
13:409:32132:12:12:72:540:199:99:g_d0_f13:99:g_d0_f7:iand whetherihas committed the dishonest act of accepting payments from special interests; both are
13:410:32231:12:12:72:540:187:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:necessarily 0 for any citizen who is not the governor. Suppose further that standard conditions justifying
13:411:32337:12:12:72:539:175:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:interior optima, the envelope theorem, and local comparative statics hold. Then, in lieu of (4), we would
13:412:32442:12:13:72:540:163:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:haveπ(a)=u1(f(e∗(a)),e∗(a)) +au1(f(e∗(a)),0). Differentiating and applying the envelope theorem yields
13:413:32544:13:0:72:479:150:99:g_d0_f13:49:g_d0_f15:π-(a)=u1(f(e∗(a)),0), and differentiating again yieldsπ--(a)=u1x(f(e∗(a)),0)f-(e∗(a))de
13:414:32631:0:12:479:494:158:25:g_d0_f17:49:g_d0_f6:∗(a)

13:416:32644:8:8:72:529:138:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:strictly positive as long as effort rises with public-spiritedness, as it must in any reasonable specification.
13:417:32755:8:16:81:539:130:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:18We assume the project is not implemented when the surplus is exactly zero; this is innocuous because
13:418:32857:16:0:72:213:114:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:the distribution ofvis atomless.
14:419:32891:0:34:72:308:708:143:g_d0_f3:64:g_d0_f4:Assumption 3.v∗(0,1,0)>v>v∗(1,0,σ).19
14:420:32928:34:18:97:540:674:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:According to the first inequality, a maximally honest governor never sells out even
14:421:33011:18:18:71:539:656:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:if he is minimally public spirited (i.e., a Principled Egoist) and anti-corruption policy is
14:422:33103:18:18:71:539:638:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:lax.  According to the second inequality, even with maximal anti-corruption enforcement, a
14:423:33193:18:18:71:539:620:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:minimally honest but maximally public-spirited governor (i.e., a Sell-Out) always sells out if
14:424:33287:18:18:71:539:602:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the stakes are sufficiently high.  We note that no governor (including a Scoundrel) will sell
14:425:33380:18:24:71:464:584:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:out whenvis sufficiently small, even under minimal anti-corruption policies.
14:426:33456:24:18:97:540:560:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:The preceding discussion readily implies that the governor’s expected rents from special
14:427:33544:18:18:71:539:542:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:interest politics, evaluated prior to the realization ofv,isEvmax{α[v−v∗(a, h, σ)],0}.
14:428:33630:18:18:72:540:524:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Moreover, the special interest’s impact on the expected payoff of any citizen with public

14:430:33799:18:18:72:540:488:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:that the governor’s expected rents from lobbying depend not only on his honesty, but also on
14:431:33891:18:17:72:540:470:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:his public-spiritedness.  As a result, special interest politics distort self-selection incentives
14:432:33989:17:18:72:540:453:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:toward less public-spirited insiders (and not simply toward less honest ones), who have
14:433:34076:18:18:72:540:435:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:relatively more to gain from securing office in their presence.  Moreover, anti-corruption
14:434:34166:18:18:72:540:417:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:enforcement can affect the quality of governance through selection effects involving public-
14:435:34258:18:24:72:540:399:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:spiritedness as well as honesty. As we will see, this selection effect turns out to be important.
14:436:34355:24:18:97:540:375:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:In what follows, it will be useful to understand how the governor’s expected rents from
14:437:34442:18:27:72:396:357:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:lobbying vary with his public spiritedness.  Using equation (5),

14:446:34702:18:18:72:540:227:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:spiritedness reduces the expected rents for a governor from special interests.  Furthermore,

14:449:34972:18:18:72:540:173:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:important, so we emphasize that it too does not rely on the specific functional form of
14:450:35059:18:17:72:539:155:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:preferences specified in (2). The general intuition is as follows: when taking the derivative
14:451:35152:17:18:72:540:138:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:of the governor’s expected rents from lobbying with respect toa, the effect ofaon the set of

15:455:35454:18:18:71:539:690:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:ignored because the governor optimizes the scope of that set. Thus, as long as preferences
15:456:35544:18:18:71:540:672:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:take the general form shown in (1), that derivative will equal the expected utility loss the

15:458:35727:18:18:71:539:636:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:governor’s bargaining weight).  This derivative, which is negative, will be increasing inaas
15:459:35819:18:45:71:478:618:143:g_d0_f2:64:g_d0_f4:long as greater public spirit reduces the likelihood that the governor sells out.20

15:467:36350:33:18:72:102:401:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:where

15:471:36567:18:18:72:540:315:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:depends on the levels of the public good and expected taxes. Anti-corruption enforcement,
15:472:36656:18:17:72:539:297:143:g_d0_f8:143:g_d0_f2:σ, has a direct effect on a candidate’s quality (except whenhis sufficiently high) because
15:473:36746:17:18:72:540:280:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:it affects the lobbying stakes for which the candidate would sell out as governor; on the

15:475:36923:18:18:71:539:244:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:each component of a citizen’s character and hence is bounded above by that of a Saint,

15:477:37071:24:18:97:540:202:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:In the (a, h)-plane, constant quality curves defined by the equationY(a, h|σ)=C(for

15:479:37243:18:18:72:539:166:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:is required to offset a decrease in honesty.22An increase in anti-corruption enforcement,σ,
15:480:37334:18:12:81:378:148:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:20A formal argument can be given along the same lines as in fn.17.
15:481:37400:12:15:81:540:136:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:21The quality of a Saint does not depend on anti-corruption enforcement,σ, because a Saint never

15:483:37574:9:0:81:539:112:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:22The “generally” caveat excludes cases where honesty is already so high that the candidate never sells

16:486:37786:24:18:97:540:666:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Finally, we note for subsequent reference that both the governor’s payoff (expression

16:535:39343:16:12:72:540:135:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:equilibria as less interesting and less empirically relevant; the 2012 working paper version of this article
16:536:39451:12:0:72:199:123:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:contains a thorough analysis.
17:537:39482:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:The inequalities in (9), which we call thewilling-candidate constraints, require that ever

17:539:39659:18:18:72:539:672:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:in (10), which we call thewilling-bystander constraints, require that each non-candidate

17:541:39840:18:41:72:378:636:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and in the next two subsections we examine them in depth.
17:542:39897:41:31:72:309:595:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:4.1.1  The willing-candidate constraints
17:543:39937:31:18:72:540:564:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Intuitively, the willing-candidate constraints collectively provide an upper bound on the qual-
17:544:40032:18:18:72:540:546:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:ity of governance: if opponents are of sufficient quality, potential candidates will refrain from
17:545:40129:18:18:72:540:528:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:running.  While this intuition proves correct, we will see that there are also circumstances
17:546:40221:18:24:72:432:510:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:in which these same constraints can provide a lower bound on quality.
17:547:40290:24:33:97:371:486:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Each willing-candidate constraint can be rewritten as
17:548:40343:33:33:178:540:453:143:g_d0_f8:143:g_d0_f2:Nk≤uG(a, h|σ,s)−(1 +a)y=:I(a, h|y,σ,s),(11)

17:550:40475:18:17:72:539:402:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:decreases with the level of the governor’s honesty,h, it follows that if the willing-candidate
17:551:40569:17:18:72:540:385:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:constraint is satisfied for some individual, it is also satisfied for less honest individuals with
17:552:40667:18:18:72:540:367:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the same level of public spirit. Thus, the equationI(a, h|y,σ,s)=Nkdefines the boundary
17:553:40754:18:18:72:543:349:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:between candidates who are willing and not willing to run for office, givenN−1opponents

17:557:41108:24:18:97:539:271:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:We next define awilling-candidate-quality correspondence,ΨN(·), that maps the average
17:558:41193:18:33:72:534:253:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:quality ofN−1 opponents into the quality levels of all candidates who are willing to run:
17:559:41282:33:32:85:519:220:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f8:ΨN(y|σ,s)={y-|∃(a, h)∈[0,1]2withY(a, h|σ)=y-andI(a, h|y,σ,s)≥Nk}.
17:560:41347:32:18:72:540:188:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:It is routine to verify that an increase in the opponents’ average quality,y, shrinks (weakly)
17:561:41441:18:18:72:539:170:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the set of willing candidates (and hence ΨN(y|σ,s)), and therefore reduces the quality of
17:562:41530:18:19:72:326:152:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the best willing candidate (i.e., max ΨN(y|σ,s)).
17:563:41579:19:15:81:539:133:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:24IfNis a singleton, then the left hand side of (9) is not well defined.  We assume that any insider is
17:564:41682:15:0:72:512:118:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:willing to run if no-one else will because the consequences of having no governor are sufficiently dire.

18:577:42078:18:18:71:539:447:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:path-connected (as it is for the valueyin Figure 1), then the willing-candidate-quality cor-
18:578:42170:18:18:72:539:429:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:respondence is convex-valued, becauseY(·,·|σ) is continuous. However, the set of willing
18:579:42258:18:18:72:540:411:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:candidates need not be path-connected for all levels of opponents’ average quality. An in-
18:580:42348:18:18:72:539:393:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:spection of (11) reveals that when opponents’ average quality increases, the willing-candidate
18:581:42442:18:18:72:539:375:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:boundary shifts downward, and more so at higher values ofabecause more public spirited
18:582:42528:18:18:72:540:357:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:individuals attach greater weight to quality. Consequently, when opponents’ average qual-
18:583:42617:18:18:72:540:339:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:ity is sufficiently large, the willing-candidate boundary can intersect thea-axis twice (as it

18:585:42802:18:18:72:540:303:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:in Figure 1) is not path-connected, and the willing-candidate correspondence may not be
18:586:42889:18:24:72:146:285:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:convex-valued.
18:587:42903:24:17:97:540:261:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Figure 2 illustrates willing-candidate-quality correspondences with two candidates: for
18:588:42990:17:18:72:540:244:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:candidate 1, it is bounded by the dashed curve, and for candidate 2, it is bounded by the
18:589:43079:18:18:72:540:226:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:solid curve.  We have drawn each correspondence as convex-valued for low values ofybut
18:590:43165:18:18:72:540:208:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:not for moderate values, reflecting the possibilities shown in Figure 1.  We have also drawn
18:591:43257:18:18:72:540:190:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the correspondences as empty for high values ofyto illustrate the possibility that there may
18:592:43349:18:18:72:540:172:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:be no willing candidates when the average of quality of opponents is too high.  Together,
18:593:43438:18:18:72:540:154:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the two willing-candidate constraints require that the candidates’ qualities correspond to a

18:595:43625:18:46:72:355:118:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:an upper bound on the expected quality of governance.

19:617:44134:18:18:71:552:429:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:possible that neither correspondence will be convex valued even for low values ofy.We

19:619:44309:18:18:72:540:393:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:satisfied only for candidate-quality pairs in the light- or dark-shaded regions.  In this case,
19:620:44404:18:18:72:540:375:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:these constraints not only establish an upper bound on the expected quality of governance,
19:621:44494:18:41:72:263:357:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:but also rule out intermediate values.
19:622:44532:41:31:72:310:316:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:4.1.2  The willing-bystander constraints
19:623:44572:31:18:72:540:285:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Intuitively, the willing-bystander constraints collectively provide a lower bound on the ex-
19:624:44664:18:18:72:540:267:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:pected quality of governance: if expected quality is sufficiently low, new candidates will
19:625:44754:18:24:72:319:249:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:enter.  This subsection derives the lower bound.
19:626:44802:24:18:97:540:225:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Generally, most of the willing-bystander constraints do not bind.  The ones that do
19:627:44885:18:18:72:540:207:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:bind (and hence matter) are associated with the types of non-candidate insiders who have
19:628:44973:18:18:72:539:189:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the greatest incentive to run for office. Ifyis the average candidate quality, the magnitude
19:629:45065:18:18:72:540:171:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:of that incentive is given byuG(a, h|σ,s)−(1+a)y.25The governor’s personal benefit from
19:630:45152:18:17:72:540:153:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:lobbying is weakly decreasing in his honesty,h.AswasshowninSection 3, the benefits
19:631:45234:17:16:81:539:136:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:25For this expression, we can ignore the probability of winning as well as the cost of running because these
19:632:45342:16:12:72:539:120:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:factors affect all potential candidates equally.  An individual of type (a, h) has a strict incentive to enter if
19:633:45455:12:0:72:284:108:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:and only ifuG(a, h|σ,s)−(1 +a)y>(N+1)k.

20:659:46276:18:18:71:540:351:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:spirit.  Consequently, there is a threshold quality level,y∗(σ), such that the non-candidate
20:660:46368:18:18:71:539:333:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:insiders with the greatest incentives to run are all Sell-Outs ifyN(σ)<y∗(σ), all Scoundrels

20:663:46586:24:17:97:540:273:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:It follows that all of the willing-bystander constraints are satisfied if and only if they are

20:665:46774:18:36:72:409:238:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:to the following simple lower bound on average candidate quality:

20:675:47078:18:0:71:363:122:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and 3; no equilibrium quality pair can lie below this line.

21:680:47437:23:18:97:540:617:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Two features of Figure 3 merit notice.  First, the willing-candidate constraints bound
21:681:47523:18:18:72:540:599:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:average quality from above, while the willing-bystander constraints bound average quality
21:682:47612:18:18:72:540:581:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:from below.  Thus, in a multi-candidate equilibrium, the candidate pool tends to be of
21:683:47698:18:18:72:540:563:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:intermediate quality: neither too good (or opponents would drop out) nor too bad (or others
21:684:47789:18:18:72:539:545:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:would enter).26Second, because the upper and lower boundaries on the set of equilibrium
21:685:47876:18:18:72:540:527:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:quality pairs slope downward, there will tend to be negative correlation between public-
21:686:47964:18:18:72:540:509:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:spiritedness and honesty among candidates, even if those characteristics are unrelated in the
21:687:48057:18:23:72:304:491:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:population from which candidates are drawn.
21:688:48100:23:18:97:540:468:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Two features of Figure 4 are also noteworthy. First, the lower bound on the expected
21:689:48184:18:18:72:540:450:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:quality of governance is determined by the willing-candidate constraint rather than the
21:690:48271:18:18:72:540:432:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:willing-bystander constraint. Second, in contrast to Figure 3,allequilibria are asymmet-
21:691:48359:18:18:71:539:414:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:ric. In such cases, there will necessarily be substantial random variation in the quality of
21:692:48451:18:18:71:539:396:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:governance from election to election. This is not merely a technical curiosity; we will see
21:693:48542:18:18:71:539:378:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:subsequently that only analogs of these asymmetric equilibria may survive as the costs of
21:694:48631:18:44:71:234:360:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:running for office become small.
21:695:48663:44:32:72:314:316:206:g_d0_f3:206:g_d0_f3:4.2  Effects of Policy Instruments
21:696:48697:32:18:72:539:284:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:We now study the effects of anti-corruption enforcement,σ, and the governor’s compensation,
21:697:48788:18:18:72:540:266:143:g_d0_f8:143:g_d0_f2:s, on the quality of governance. Since equilibria are not generally locally unique, we focus on
21:698:48883:18:23:72:540:248:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the policies’ effects on the highest and lowest expected quality achievable in an equilibrium.
21:699:48977:23:18:97:539:225:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:A change in a policy variable (σors) can affect electoral outcomes either by altering
21:700:49062:18:18:72:540:207:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the set of equilibria for a fixed number of candidates (N), or by inducing either more or fewer
21:701:49157:18:16:81:539:189:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:26One might argue that there are more compelling explanations for why the citizens of highest quality do
21:702:49261:16:12:72:540:173:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:not run for office, e.g., that they have better opportunities in the private sector.  It is important to bear in
21:703:49373:12:12:72:540:161:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:mind, however, that our analysis focuses not on competence or ability, but rather on honesty and public-
21:704:49477:12:12:72:540:149:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:spiritedness. It is not at all obvious that these dimensions of candidate quality are positively correlated with
21:705:49589:12:12:72:540:137:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:private sector opportunities. We readily grant that the mediocrity of politicians with respect to competence
21:706:49697:12:12:72:540:125:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:reflects other considerations; our analysis shows, in addition, why politics does not attract the most public-
21:707:49807:12:12:72:540:113:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:spirited or honest citizens among those with any given level of competence. In effect, citizens of the highest
21:708:49917:12:0:72:507:101:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:character have less incentive to enter politics than those who are willing to benefit from corruption.
22:709:50021:0:18:72:539:708:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:candidates to enter.  We begin by studying policy effects for fixedN, which are interesting
22:710:50112:18:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:for three separate reasons.  First, any directional local comparative static result for the
22:711:50203:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:best (or worst) equilibrium withNfixed will also generally hold for the overall best (or
22:712:50291:18:18:72:539:654:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:worst) equilibrium.  The exception is when a policy change alters the set ofNfor which
22:713:50377:18:18:72:540:636:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:equilibria exist in a way that produces a discontinuous jump in the best or worst equilibrium.
22:714:50471:18:18:72:539:618:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:However, for local policy changes, such exceptions are presumably “rare.”27Second, even
22:715:50558:18:18:72:540:600:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:when a policy change crosses one of the exceptional points in the parameter space, one still
22:716:50650:18:18:72:540:582:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:obtains a better understanding of comparative statics by examining the component effects
22:717:50738:18:18:72:540:564:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:separately. Third, it is possible that social norms, potentially reinforced by slowly changing
22:718:50832:18:18:72:540:546:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:institutions (such as parties), would create inertia with respect to the number of candidates,
22:719:50926:18:40:72:320:528:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:so thatNwould remain fixed whenever feasible.
22:720:50971:40:32:72:450:488:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f3:4.2.1  Comparative Statics with a Fixed Number of Candidates
22:721:51031:32:18:72:540:456:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:As we will see, withNfixed, anti-corruption enforcement has both anincentive effect(an
22:722:51117:18:18:72:539:438:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:impact on the post-election behavior of the governor) and aselection effect(an impact on
22:723:51205:18:18:72:540:420:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the composition of the candidate pool through the willing-candidate and willing-bystander
22:724:51294:18:18:72:540:402:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:constraints), which work in opposite directions.  In contrast, the governor’s compensation
22:725:51384:18:28:72:206:384:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:only has a selection effect.
22:726:51412:28:18:72:540:356:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f5:Theorem 1.Assume that forN>1,N-candidate equilibria exist for some range of pol-
22:727:51492:18:17:72:540:338:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:icy parameters.   The expected quality of governance in the best such equilibrium weakly
22:728:51580:17:18:72:540:321:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:decreases with higher anti-corruption enforcement and weakly increases with higher compen-
22:729:51670:18:34:72:319:303:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:sation (strictly unless all candidates are Saints).
22:730:51721:34:18:97:540:269:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:The intuition for this result is as follows. From Figures 3 and 4, it should be clear that
22:731:51811:18:18:72:540:251:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:when a policy change expands the set of willing-candidate quality levels regardless of the
22:732:51901:18:18:72:540:233:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:opponent’s quality, it will improve the best equilibrium.  Plainly, higher compensation pro-
22:733:51993:18:18:72:540:215:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:duces such an expansion. What is perhaps more surprising is that increased anti-corruption
22:734:52083:18:18:72:540:197:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:enforcement has the opposite effect. To understand why, suppose a given candidate is will-
22:735:52173:18:18:72:539:179:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:ing to run againstN−1 opponents of average qualityywhen the enforcement level isσ-.
22:736:52256:18:18:72:540:161:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Then, for some slightly lower enforcement level,σ--, there is a slightly more honest potential
22:737:52350:18:18:72:540:143:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:candidate who experiences the same disutility from selling out as does the first candidate
22:738:52440:18:17:72:539:125:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:under policyσ-. Now recall from the end ofSubsection 3.3that both candidate quality and
22:739:52527:17:0:81:504:108:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:27To be precise, we conjecture that the policy points at which such exceptions occur are isolated.
23:740:52627:0:18:72:539:708:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the governor’s utility (and hence the incentive to enter,uG(a, h|σ,s)−(1 +a)y) depend on
23:741:52715:18:18:71:539:690:143:g_d0_f8:143:g_d0_f2:handσonly through the disutility from selling out. Since the second candidate’s incentive
23:742:52804:18:18:71:540:672:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:to enter under policyσ--is the same as the first candidate’s under policyσ-, the second can-
23:743:52896:18:18:72:539:654:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:didate is willing to run againstN−1 opponents of average qualityywhen the enforcement
23:744:52981:18:18:72:544:636:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:level isσ--.  Furthermore, the second candidate’s quality under policyσ--isthesameasthe
23:745:53068:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:first candidate’s under policyσ-. It follows that a reduction in anti-corruption enforcement
23:746:53160:18:24:72:360:600:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:cannot reduce the set of willing-candidate quality levels.
23:747:53218:24:18:97:540:576:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Analysis of the worst equilibria is more complicated because it could be determined by
23:748:53304:18:18:72:540:558:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:(i) the willing-bystander constraint, as in Figure 3, (ii) the willing-candidate constraint, as in
23:749:53402:18:18:72:540:540:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Figure 4, or (iii) neither, and hence by the quality of Scoundrels. Case (iii) is easiest, because
23:750:53500:18:18:72:539:522:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the expected quality of governance in the worst equilibrium is simplyY(0,0|σ), which is
23:751:53587:18:18:71:539:504:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:increasing in the level of anti-corruption enforcement and unaffected by compensation. For
23:752:53677:18:17:71:539:486:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:case (ii), the policy effects on the worst equilibrium are precisely opposite those for the
23:753:53768:17:18:71:539:469:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:best equilibrium: greater anti-corruption enforcement leads to an improvement, and higher
23:754:53857:18:18:71:544:451:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:compensation makes matters worse.  In light of the intuition provided forTheorem 1,the
23:755:53943:18:18:71:539:433:143:g_d0_f2:64:g_d0_f4:reason is clear: expanding a set has opposite effects on its maximum and its minimum.28
23:756:54030:18:28:72:283:415:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:For case (i), we have the following result:
23:757:54073:28:18:72:540:387:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f5:Theorem 2.Assume that forN>1,N-candidate equilibria exist for some range of policy
23:758:54155:18:18:72:539:369:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:parameters. If, throughout this range, the expected quality of governance in the worstN-
23:759:54243:18:18:72:540:351:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:candidate equilibrium is determined by the willing-bystander constraint, it strictly decreases
23:760:54337:18:34:72:524:333:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:with higher anti-corruption enforcement and strictly increases with higher compensation.
23:761:54425:34:18:97:540:299:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:The intuition for this result is as follows.   An increase in compensation improves
23:762:54508:18:18:72:540:281:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the worst equilibrium because it increases the lure of running for office, and consequently
23:763:54599:18:18:72:540:263:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:renders potential candidates less willing to settle for poor governance; thus, the lower bound
23:764:54693:18:18:72:540:245:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:on the quality of governance must rise.  Once again, the surprise is that anti-corruption
23:765:54782:18:17:72:540:227:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:enforcement has the opposite effect; after all, greater enforcement has a positive incentive
23:766:54874:17:18:72:540:210:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:effect on the quality of any given candidate, and it is not obvious that selection effects are of
23:767:54971:18:18:72:540:192:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the opposite sign and dominate.  However, the explanation is straightforward. Recall that
23:768:55060:18:18:72:540:174:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the willing-bystander constraint is satisfied when non-candidate Scoundrels and Sell-Outs
23:769:55149:18:16:81:539:156:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:28If the set of equilibrium expected quality levels is non-convex, changes in the best and worst equilibria
23:770:55256:16:12:72:540:140:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:do not completely characterize the effects of policy changes on the range of expected governance quality.
23:771:55361:12:12:72:540:128:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:Suppose the set in question is a sequence of disjoint intervals.  In that case, an increase ins(resp.σ)
23:772:55464:12:12:72:540:116:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:increases (resp.  decreases) the upper bound of every interval, and decreases (resp.  increases) the lower
23:773:55570:12:0:72:496:104:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:bound (some of those effects being strict and some weak).  Additional intervals may also appear.
24:774:55668:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:have no incentive to run for office.  It is straightforward to check that these incentives are
24:775:55762:18:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:strictly decreasing in the level of anti-corruption enforcement. Hence, with more aggressive
24:776:55854:18:24:72:473:672:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:enforcement, a lower average-quality group of candidates can go unchallenged.
24:777:55931:24:18:97:540:648:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Together, Theorems1and2imply that, in what we view as the most interesting case
24:778:56010:18:18:72:540:630:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:(where the willing-bystander constraint determines the lower bound on equilibrium quality),
24:779:56101:18:18:72:540:612:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:both the best and the worstN-candidate equilibria improve as the governor’s compensation
24:780:56189:18:41:72:350:594:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:increases, and as anti-corruption enforcementdeclines.

24:782:56304:31:18:72:540:522:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Now we turn our attention to the questions of whether a change in a policy variable can alter
24:783:56397:18:18:72:539:504:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the set ofNfor which equilibria exist in a way that produces a discontinuous jump in the
24:784:56485:18:18:72:540:486:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:best or worst equilibrium, and how such possibilities affect comparative statics of the policy
24:785:56579:18:18:72:540:468:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:instruments.  The discussion in this section is intuitive and informal; the next section will
24:786:56672:18:24:72:306:450:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:derive formal results when entry costs vanish.
24:787:56718:24:18:97:540:426:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:First consider the effect of different values ofN. The only effect an increase inNhas on
24:788:56806:18:18:72:540:408:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:any insider’s entry incentive is to reduce the probability of winning the election.  Hence, as
24:789:56900:18:18:72:540:390:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:is readily verified, the willing-candidate constraints become more restrictive, which reduces
24:790:56993:18:18:72:540:372:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:expected quality in the best equilibrium, while the willing-bystander constraints become less
24:791:57086:18:18:72:540:354:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:restrictive, which reduces expected quality in the worst equilibrium (assuming this constraint
24:792:57180:18:17:72:540:336:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:binds).  Two conclusions follow.  First, with respect to the expected quality of governance,
24:793:57272:17:18:72:539:319:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:an increase in the number of candidates tends to generatedetrimentalselection effects: from
24:794:57363:18:18:72:539:301:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the perspective of selection, the fewer candidates the better.29Second, the best equilibria
24:795:57454:18:18:72:540:283:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:tend to involve the smallest feasible number of candidates, and the worst equilibria tend to
24:796:57546:18:24:72:175:265:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:involve the greatest.
24:797:57567:24:18:97:540:241:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Now consider the effects of policy variables on the existence of equilibria with any given
24:798:57657:18:18:72:540:223:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:number of candidates. Intuitively, higher compensation makes entry more attractive, which
24:799:57746:18:18:72:540:205:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:can eliminate equilibria with smaller numbers of candidates and introduce equilibria with
24:800:57835:18:18:72:540:187:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:larger numbers of candidates. More aggressive anti-corruption enforcement would have the
24:801:57923:18:18:72:540:169:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:opposite effect. It follows from this observation and the arguments in the previous paragraph
24:802:58016:18:18:72:540:151:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:that when a change in a policy variable creates a discontinuous jump in the best or worst
24:803:58105:18:15:81:539:133:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:29We say “tends to” because there may be exceptions, depending on which constraints bind and the nature
24:804:58208:15:0:72:153:118:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:of non-convexities.

25:809:58583:18:18:72:540:630:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:also typically be small), reversing the conclusions of the preceding sub-section. In contrast,
25:810:58677:18:18:72:539:612:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:forlargepolicy changes, one cannot generally say which effect will dominate. However, as we
25:811:58768:18:18:72:540:594:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:show in the next subsection, it is possible to evaluate all the pertinent effects in combination
25:812:58864:18:18:72:540:576:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:when the costs of running for office are treated as vanishingly small, a common assumption

25:815:59028:31:18:72:540:482:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:We now examine the behavior of the model askbecomes vanishingly small. As before, we
25:816:59112:18:18:72:540:464:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:focus on multiple-candidate equilibria and their comparative statics, accounting simultane-
25:817:59203:18:18:72:540:446:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:ously for all of the effects discussed inSubsection 4.2. More specifically, we assume that
25:818:59293:18:18:72:540:428:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:parameters are such that single-candidate equilibria do not exist when running costs are
25:819:59381:18:24:72:168:410:143:g_d0_f2:64:g_d0_f4:sufficiently small.30
25:820:59402:24:18:97:540:386:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Due to integer constraints, the existence of pure-strategy equilibria is not generally as-
25:821:59492:18:18:71:539:368:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:sured. Consequently, we now broaden the scope of our analysis to include mixed-strategy
25:822:59579:18:18:71:539:350:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:equilibria.  We study mixed-strategy equilibria in which insiders probabilistically run for
25:823:59670:18:18:71:539:332:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:office if and only if they belong to a finite or countably infinite set of (potential) candi-
25:824:59763:18:18:71:539:314:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:dates.  Formally, amixed-strategy equilibrium—or just equilibrium hereafter—consists of
25:825:59850:18:18:72:540:296:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:a denumerable setNof political insiders with cardinalityN:=|N| ∈N∪{+∞}, plus an

25:827:60013:18:17:71:539:260:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:insider running, such that the natural generalizations of the willing-candidate and willing-
25:828:60105:17:18:71:539:243:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:bystander constraints, (9)and(10), are satisfied (see the Appendix forspecifics).  Insiders
25:829:60196:18:18:71:539:225:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:not in the setNrun with zero probability. Amultiple-candidate equilibriumrefers to any

25:831:60363:18:18:71:539:189:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Given any (N,μ), whether an equilibrium or not, we denote the associated expected quality

25:833:60477:19:15:81:540:152:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:30Lemma 5in the Appendix establishes that as running costs vanish, all equilibria are multiple-candidate
25:834:60581:15:12:71:539:137:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:equilibria if and only if the quality of a Saint is lower than some threshold that is determined by the willingness
25:835:60696:12:12:71:539:125:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:of Sell-Outs and Scoundrels to enter costlessly against a Saint. We assume throughout this subsection that
25:836:60802:12:0:71:539:113:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:this condition is satisfied. For example, it is sufficient (but not necessary) that compensation be large enough.
26:837:60917:0:18:97:540:708:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:As we are not aware of an equilibrium existence result that applies to the current
26:838:60999:18:23:71:263:690:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:framework,31we record the following:
26:839:61035:23:28:72:402:667:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f5:Theorem 3.For anyk>0, a mixed-strategy equilibrium exists.
26:840:61093:28:18:97:540:639:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Assured of existence, we next establish the crucial result that as the cost of running
26:841:61179:18:18:71:539:621:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:for office approaches zero, the character of every candidate must approach that of either a
26:842:61270:18:22:71:195:603:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Scoundrel or a Sell-Out.
26:843:61294:22:18:71:540:581:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f5:Theorem 4.For anyε>0, there existsˆk(ε)>0such that whenk<ˆk(ε), any multiple-
26:844:61371:18:18:72:540:563:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:candidate equilibrium,(N,μ), satisfies: ifn∈N, then(an,hn)∈Bε(1,0)∪Bε(0,0), where

26:846:61514:28:18:97:540:517:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:In proving this result, a key step demonstrates that as running costs vanish, so does
26:847:61599:18:18:72:539:499:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the probability that any particular candidate will win the election (seeLemma 6in the
26:848:61684:18:18:72:540:481:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Appendix).   It follows that, in the limit, the willing-candidate constraints are virtually
26:849:61775:18:18:72:540:463:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:identical to the willing-bystander constraints, except that the direction of the inequality is
26:850:61869:18:18:72:539:445:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:reversed.Theorem 4then follows from the earlier observation that either Scoundrels or
26:851:61954:18:18:72:540:427:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Sell-Outs always have the greatest incentive to run for office.  For, if a candidate were of
26:852:62046:18:18:72:540:409:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:any other type, the fact that the willing-candidate constraint is satisfied for that candidate
26:853:62140:18:18:72:540:391:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:would imply that the willing-bystander constraint is violated for either Scoundrels or Sell-
26:854:62232:18:23:72:239:373:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Outs, precluding an equilibrium.
26:855:62264:23:18:97:540:350:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Given this characterization of the support of candidates’ character types, the expected
26:856:62351:18:17:72:546:332:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:quality of governance can now be pinned down.   Recall that we had definedy∗(σ)as
26:857:62432:17:18:72:540:315:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the expected quality of governance that equalizes the incentives to enter for Sell-Outs and
26:858:62523:18:18:72:540:297:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Scoundrels: fory>y∗(σ), Scoundrels have greater incentive to enter than Sell-Outs, and
26:859:62609:18:23:72:195:279:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:vice versa fory<y∗(σ).

26:872:62957:16:12:72:540:125:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:that choices by a measure zero set of opponents do not affect a player’s payoff.   That requirement is
26:873:63059:12:12:72:540:113:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:obviously not satisfied here: for example, if an insider chooses to run, his (expected) payoff depends on the
26:874:63168:12:0:72:255:101:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:exact number and identities of opponents.

27:876:63260:31:18:97:540:677:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:In other words, as entry costs vanish, the equilibrium quality of governance converges

27:878:63436:18:18:72:540:641:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Scoundrel. To build intuition for this result, supposey∗(σ) is strictly between the quality of a
27:879:63532:18:18:72:539:623:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Scoundrel and that of a Sell-Out.Theorem 4says that, as entry costs vanish, Sell-Outs and
27:880:63621:18:18:72:540:605:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Scoundrels run for office.  Clearly, the equilibrium cannot consist of all Scoundrels, because
27:881:63715:18:18:72:539:587:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:that would entailyN(μ, σ)<y∗(σ), which implies that Sell-Outs would have greater incentive
27:882:63805:18:18:71:539:569:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:to enter than Scoundrels. Similarly, the equilibrium cannot consist of all Sell-Outs, because
27:883:63898:18:18:71:540:551:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:then we would haveyN(μ, σ)>y∗(σ), which implies that Scoundrels would have greater
27:884:63980:18:18:72:540:533:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:incentive to enter than Sell-Outs.  Thus, the equilibrium must involve a non-degenerate
27:885:64067:18:18:72:540:515:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:mixture of Scoundrels and Sell-Outs.  To preserve a mixture in the limit, Scoundrels and
27:886:64155:18:23:72:517:497:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Sell-Outs must have the same incentives to enter, which implies thatyN(μ, σ)=y∗(σ).
27:887:64238:23:18:97:540:474:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Together, Theorems4and5have a surprising and important implication: with small
27:888:64316:18:18:72:539:456:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:entry costs, the quality of governance is typically highly variable.32Though all candidates
27:889:64407:18:18:72:540:438:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:are maximally dishonest, they vary widely in public spirit.  A given election can yield a
27:890:64496:18:18:72:540:420:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:governor with either extremely high or extremely low public spirit (Sell-Outs or Scoundrels),
27:891:64589:18:18:72:540:402:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and hence either the maximum or minimum level of the public good.  Thus, analogs of the
27:892:64676:18:18:72:539:384:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:asymmetric equilibria identified inSubsection 4.2typically turn out to be the only ones that
27:893:64768:18:18:72:540:366:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:survive in the limit. It is worth remembering, however, that when entry costs are not small,
27:894:64860:18:18:72:540:348:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:asymmetric equilibria can also yield substantial variability with respect to the governor’s
27:895:64951:18:23:72:524:330:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:honesty; it is only ask→0 that all candidates necessarily become maximally dishonest.
27:896:65036:23:18:97:539:307:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Theorem 5also allows us to determine the effects of our two public policy instruments,
27:897:65122:18:18:72:540:289:143:g_d0_f8:143:g_d0_f2:sandσ, on the expected quality of governance askvanishes. We begin withs, the governor’s
27:898:65210:18:18:72:539:271:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:compensation.  Sincey∗(σ),Y(0,0|σ), andY(1,0|σ) are all independent ofs, it follows
27:899:65293:18:18:71:540:253:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:that, in the limit, changes in compensation haveno effecton the expected quality of gover-
27:900:65383:18:18:72:540:235:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:nance. The reason is clear when the candidates are either all Sell-Outs or all Scoundrels: in
27:901:65476:18:18:72:540:217:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:such cases there are no candidate selection effects, and selection provides the only possible
27:902:65569:18:18:72:540:199:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:channel through which compensation can influence the quality of governance. More interest-
27:903:65659:18:18:72:540:181:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:ingly, the result tells us that when both Sell-Outs and Scoundrels run for office, the typically
27:904:65755:18:17:72:539:163:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:detrimental selection effects that an increase inshas through stimulating additional entry
27:905:65845:17:24:72:535:146:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f2:exactly offset, at the limit, the beneficial selection effects for a fixed number of candidates.
27:906:65941:24:17:97:539:122:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Next we consider the effects ofσ, the level of anti-corruption enforcement. Plainly, both
27:907:66030:17:0:81:538:105:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:32“Typically” because this requiresy∗(σ)∈(Y(0,0|σ),Y(1,0|σ)), which we view as the interesting case.
28:908:66132:0:18:72:539:708:143:g_d0_f8:143:g_d0_f2:Y(0,0|σ)andY(1,0|σ) are strictly increasing inσ.  Furthermore,y∗(σ) is also strictly
28:909:66216:18:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:increasing: while increased anti-corruption enforcement makes holding office less attractive to
28:910:66311:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:both Scoundrels and Sell-Outs, it has a stronger effect on Scoundrels because they succumb
28:911:66401:18:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:to lobbying more often; hence, a higher expected quality of governance is required to restore
28:912:66494:18:18:72:539:636:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:equal entry incentives.  (SeeLemma 3in the Appendix for a formal proof.)  Therefore,
28:913:66578:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Theorem 5implies that in the limit ask→0, an increase inσunambiguously improves the
28:914:66661:18:18:72:540:600:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:quality of governance. The explanation is again clear when the candidates are either all Sell-
28:915:66755:18:18:72:539:582:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Outs or all Scoundrels: with no selection effects, an increase inσmust be beneficial because
28:916:66847:18:18:72:540:564:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:it has positive incentive effects on both types. When Sell-Outs and Scoundrels both run for
28:917:66938:18:18:72:539:546:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:office, selection effects also come into play. If an increase inσdid not affect the expected
28:918:67030:18:18:72:540:528:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:quality of governance that equalizes entry incentives for the two types, then the policy change
28:919:67125:18:18:72:540:510:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:would have no net benefit—the positive incentive effects would be exactly offset by a selection
28:920:67220:18:18:72:540:492:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:effect shift toward more Scoundrels. However, as already noted, higher expected quality is
28:921:67310:18:17:72:540:474:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:in fact required to preserve equal incentives for Sell-Outs and Scoundrels to run for office.
28:922:67403:17:18:72:540:457:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Thus, in the limit ask→0, the direct incentive effects of anti-corruption enforcement and
28:923:67492:18:18:72:540:439:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the typically beneficial selection effects associated with deterring additional entry combine to
28:924:67588:18:24:72:540:421:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:more than offset the typically detrimental selection effects for a fixed number of candidates.
28:925:67682:24:18:97:540:397:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:While the direction of this effect is consistent with simple intuition, the mechanism is
28:926:67770:18:18:72:540:379:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:rather surprising and worth emphasizing. As entry costs vanish, any effect of anti-corruption
28:927:67863:18:18:72:539:361:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:enforcement,σ, on candidate selection operates entirely throughpublic-spiritedness(the mix
28:928:67953:18:18:72:539:343:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:of Scoundrels and Sell-Outs), rather than throughhonesty(given that all candidates are
28:929:68039:18:18:72:540:325:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:maximally dishonest in the limit).  Also, recall from Theorems1and2that if the number
28:930:68124:18:18:72:540:307:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:of candidates is held fixed, the positive incentive effects of anti-corruption enforcement on a
28:931:68219:18:18:72:540:289:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:governor’s incentives are typically more than offset by perverse selection effects.  Thus, as
28:932:68312:18:18:72:540:271:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:entry costs vanish, anti-corruption enforcement is on balance beneficial only because it also
28:933:68405:18:24:72:522:253:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:reduces the number of candidates in equilibrium, therebyindirectlyimproving selection.
28:934:68491:24:17:97:540:229:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Setting aside the incentive effects of increased anti-corruption enforcement, it is also
28:935:68579:17:18:72:540:212:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:of interest whether the overall selection effects are beneficial or not as entry costs vanish;
28:936:68673:18:18:72:540:194:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:i.e. are the typically detrimental effects for a fixed number of candidates dominated by the
28:937:68765:18:18:72:540:176:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:typically beneficial effects operating through reduced entry? This is equivalent to asking
28:938:68855:18:18:72:540:158:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:whether the ratio among candidates of Sell-Outs to Scoundrels falls or rises at the limit. It
28:939:68948:18:24:72:248:140:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:turns out that either may happen.
28:940:68981:24:0:97:382:116:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:The following result summarizes our policy conclusions:
29:941:69038:0:18:72:539:708:143:g_d0_f3:143:g_d0_f5:Theorem 6.Consider multiple-candidate equilibria in the limit as the costs of running
29:942:69123:18:18:72:539:690:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:become vanishingly small. An increase in anti-corruption enforcement (σ) strictly increases
29:943:69214:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:the expected quality of governance but may increase or decrease the fraction of Sell-Outs who
29:944:69307:18:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:run for office relative to Scoundrels, while a change in the governor’s compensation (s) has
29:945:69399:18:45:72:528:636:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f5:no impact on the expected quality of governance or the composition of the candidate pool.

29:947:69543:32:18:72:540:559:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:So far we have assumed that the electorate cannot distinguish at all between candidates’
29:948:69631:18:18:72:540:541:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:character.  In practice, information concerning candidates’ personal backgrounds and track
29:949:69721:18:18:72:540:523:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:records in other positions may be available, and this has been found to influence voters’
29:950:69810:18:17:72:540:505:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:choices (e.g.Banerjee et al.,2010,2011).  Indeed, some scholars argue that elections for
29:951:69898:17:18:72:540:488:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:lower office may improve electoral outcomes for higher office by providing opportunities for
29:952:69990:18:18:72:540:470:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:candidates to establish reputations, thereby beneficially filtering the set of candidates (e.g.
29:953:70085:18:18:72:539:452:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Cooter,2003;Myerson,2006). We examine these possibilities here by extending our model to
29:954:70173:18:18:72:540:434:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:allow for observable differences among candidates. Our main conclusion is that a change in
29:955:70263:18:18:72:540:416:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the information structure (such as the provision of more extensive background information)
29:956:70353:18:18:72:540:398:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:hasno effecton the set of equilibrium candidate-character profiles, provided the information
29:957:70445:18:24:72:336:380:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:remains inconclusive in a sense made precise below.
29:958:70496:24:18:97:540:356:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Letβbe an observable parameter that encapsulates the past track record of any par-
29:959:70578:18:18:72:540:338:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:ticular insider.  To keep matters simple, we will assume thatβis a scalar that lies in the
29:960:70668:18:18:72:540:320:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:normalized interval [0,1], but one could just as easily take it to be a vector.  We will also
29:961:70761:18:18:72:540:302:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:make the following weak but critical assumption: the distribution of (a, h) has full support
29:962:70853:18:18:72:540:284:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:on [0,1]×[0,1] for allβ.33In other words, no track record allows a voter to rule out with
29:963:70942:18:17:72:539:266:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f2:certaintythe possibility that an insider is of any given type; it is in this sense that observable
29:964:71040:17:24:72:212:249:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:information is inconclusive.
29:965:71068:24:18:97:540:225:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:The introduction of observable differences among candidates potentially complicates the
29:966:71155:18:18:72:540:207:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:analysis of equilibria.  Without such differences, all candidates are indistinguishable, and
29:967:71247:18:18:72:540:189:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:hence must have the same probability of winning on and off the equilibrium path.  With
29:968:71333:18:18:72:540:171:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:observable differences, the probability with which a candidate wins can depend upon his
29:969:71420:18:18:72:540:153:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:observableβ, and the manner in which the probabilities vary withβboth on and off the
29:970:71504:18:18:72:357:135:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:equilibrium path will depend on the electorate’s beliefs.
29:971:71561:18:15:81:539:117:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:33Notethatthisassumptionrulesoutthecasewhere(a, h) is perfectly observable. Moreover, we implicitly
29:972:71660:15:0:72:360:102:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:assume that there is a continuum of insiders with each possibleβ.
30:973:71727:0:18:97:540:708:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Depending on whether and how one refines the set of equilibria, introducing observable
30:974:71813:18:18:71:539:690:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:differences among candidates may or may not change the set of equilibrium candidate-quality
30:975:71904:18:18:71:540:672:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:profiles, compared to the baseline model without observable differentiation.34However, if
30:976:71993:18:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:there is a change, it generally reflects the introduction of observable labels (here,β), rather
30:977:72088:18:24:72:451:636:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:than correlations between those labels and aspects of character (aandh).
30:978:72160:24:18:97:540:612:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:To see why, first consider the set of unrefined equilibria (i.e., absent any restriction
30:979:72248:18:18:72:540:594:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:on off-path beliefs).  An equilibrium consists of a candidate set (where each candidate is
30:980:72338:18:18:72:539:576:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:identified by a triplet (β, a, h)) and a system of beliefs (concerning candidate qualities both
30:981:72433:18:18:72:540:558:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:on and off the equilibrium path), such that the beliefs are consistent with the true candidate
30:982:72527:18:18:72:540:540:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:set on the equilibrium path, and such that all willing-candidate and willing-bystander con-
30:983:72618:18:18:72:540:522:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:straints are satisfied, given the beliefs.  Now suppose the underlying correlations between
30:984:72709:18:18:72:539:504:143:g_d0_f8:143:g_d0_f2:β,a,andhchange.  Since information is inconclusive (in the sense defined above), the
30:985:72793:18:17:72:540:486:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:set of population types compatible with any observedβis unchanged.  Therefore, one can
30:986:72879:17:18:72:540:469:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:assign the same candidate pool and the same system of beliefs, in which case the willing-
30:987:72968:18:18:72:540:451:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:candidate and willing-bystander constraints continue to hold, because these constraints do
30:988:73058:18:18:72:540:433:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:not depend directly either onβor on the correlations betweenβ,a,andh.  It follows that
30:989:73144:18:24:72:284:415:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the configuration remains an equilibrium.
30:990:73185:24:18:97:540:391:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:In principle, one could impose a belief restriction that depends in some fashion on the
30:991:73272:18:18:72:540:373:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:correlations betweenβ,a,andh, in which case a change in those correlations could alter the
30:992:73362:18:18:72:540:355:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:(refined) equilibrium constraints.  However, familiar equilibrium refinements do not have
30:993:73451:18:18:72:540:337:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:that property.  To the contrary, typical criteria for restricting off-path beliefs (e.g.Cho
30:994:73542:18:18:72:539:319:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and Kreps,1987) are based on the incentives of each type to make a deviation rather than
30:995:73630:18:18:72:540:301:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the underlying frequencies of those types within the population.  Thus, the irrelevance of
30:996:73720:18:24:72:467:283:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:background information is robust to a wide range of equilibrium refinements.
30:997:73796:24:18:97:540:259:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:These findings have surprising implications for public policy.  First, policies requiring
30:998:73885:18:17:72:540:241:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the disclosure of background information concerning political candidates may have little or
30:999:73976:17:16:81:539:224:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:34To illustrate, suppose we restrict attention to equilibria in which all candidates have the same track
30:1000:74080:16:12:72:544:208:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:record (e.g.  the best record,β=1),andimposenorestrictiononoff-pathbeliefs.  Thenitiseasyto
30:1001:74171:12:12:72:540:196:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:show that the set of candidate-quality profiles are the same regardless of whether or not the candidates
30:1002:74275:12:12:72:540:184:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:are observably differentiated.  The same conclusion follows if one refines beliefs by insisting that perceived
30:1003:74385:12:12:72:540:172:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:candidate quality is increasing inβ.  If one instead imposes a restriction on beliefs in the spirit of the D1
30:1004:74494:12:12:72:539:160:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:criterion (Cho and Kreps,1987), attributing unexpected entry to a candidate whose character provides the
30:1005:74598:12:12:72:540:148:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:“greatest” or “most robust” incentive to enter (i.e., the type that would enter for the lowest probability of
30:1006:74707:12:12:72:540:136:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:electoral success), then one can show that equilibrium candidate-quality profiles must satisfy an additional
30:1007:74815:12:12:72:540:124:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:constraint that bounds from below the expected quality of governance. Consideration of equilibria involving
30:1008:74922:12:0:72:428:112:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:candidates with different track records generally opens up additional possibilities.
31:1009:75008:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:no effect on the character of elected officials or the quality of governance.   To put the
31:1010:75098:18:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:matter starkly, the set of equilibria is identical regardless of whetherβrepresents zip codes
31:1011:75191:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:for primary residences, or zip codes supplemented with criminal records (provided the full-
31:1012:75282:18:18:72:540:654:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:support condition is satisfied). Positive effects of information disclosures on voters’ choices,
31:1013:75378:18:18:72:540:636:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:as documented for example byFerraz and Finan(2008)andBanerjee et al.(2010,2011),
31:1014:75458:18:18:72:540:618:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:may be rendered ineffective by selection effects once such disclosures are institutionalized.
31:1015:75551:18:18:72:540:600:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Thus, our analysis may help explain whyChemin(2008) finds no evidence that the election
31:1016:75638:18:18:72:540:582:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:of criminal politicians increases bribe-taking in India following a 2003 Supreme Court ruling
31:1017:75731:18:18:72:539:564:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:mandating that all political candidates reveal criminal records.35Second, our neutrality
31:1018:75819:18:18:72:540:546:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:result provides a cautionary note to the notion that elections for lower office in decentralized
31:1019:75915:18:18:72:540:528:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:democracies beneficially filter the set of candidates for higher office according to their track
31:1020:76011:18:49:72:443:510:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:records, as suggested for example byCooter(2003)andMyerson(2006).
31:1021:76076:49:35:72:278:461:296:g_d0_f3:296:g_d0_f3:5  Concluding Remarks
31:1022:76097:35:18:72:540:426:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:We have examined the impact of special interest politics on the character of self-selected
31:1023:76187:18:18:72:540:408:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:politicians. Our focus has been on two dimensions of character: honesty and public spirit.
31:1024:76277:18:18:72:540:390:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Our analysis emphasizes the role of selection effects in determining the quality of governance.
31:1025:76372:18:18:72:540:372:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:The effects of public policy instruments, such as the level of the governor’s compensation,
31:1026:76463:18:18:72:540:354:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the intensity of anti-corruption enforcement, and the disclosure of background information,
31:1027:76554:18:18:72:540:336:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:turn out to be surprisingly subtle.  Nevertheless, a number of robust—and in some cases
31:1028:76641:18:18:72:540:318:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:unexpected—findings emerge, which we have summarized in the Introduction and hence will
31:1029:76728:18:23:72:459:300:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:not repeat here.  We conclude instead by discussing some additional issues.
31:1030:76803:23:18:97:540:277:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:We have focussed on a one-time election with no incumbent. Assuming character is at
31:1031:76886:18:18:72:540:259:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:least partially revealed during a governor’s first term, re-election opportunities can promote
31:1032:76980:18:18:72:540:241:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:better governance through three channels. The first is purely mechanical: the electorate
31:1033:77068:18:18:72:540:223:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:gains opportunities to re-elect desirable incumbents. This generates a second channel, which
31:1034:77160:18:18:72:540:205:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:is the standard account of electoral accountability: a desire to be re-elected can have positive
31:1035:77256:18:18:72:540:187:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:incentive effects on the governor. Consequently, even policies such as the governor’s com-
31:1036:77346:18:18:72:540:169:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:pensation level can have incentive effects (by altering the value of re-election), unlike in the
31:1037:77442:18:18:72:540:151:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:one-period model. The third, and most novel, channel operates through self-selection effects:
31:1038:77535:18:16:72:540:133:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the benefits of running for office in the first place, as a non-incumbent, rise for high-quality
31:1039:77631:16:16:81:539:117:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:35In fact, Chemin finds that bribe-taking is lower when the victorious candidate has a criminal record,
31:1040:77734:16:0:72:496:101:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:which he interprets as indicating that criminal officeholders reduce the prosecution of corruption.
32:1041:77835:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:candidates (for whom the odds of re-election are high) relative to low-quality candidates (for
32:1042:77929:18:18:72:540:690:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:whom the odds are low). In aSupplementary Appendix, we formally develop this point in
32:1043:78014:18:24:72:472:672:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:both a two-period model and an infinite-horizon model with a two-term limit.
32:1044:78090:24:18:97:540:648:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:The Supplementary Appendix also raises a counterpoint: if lower-quality candidates
32:1045:78172:18:18:72:540:630:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:benefit more from re-election than higher-quality candidates, then the possibility of re-
32:1046:78261:18:18:72:540:612:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:election can have pernicious selection effects.  Such effects can emerge if, as many have
32:1047:78350:18:18:72:540:594:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:suggested, more senior politicians are able to extract greater pork and/or rents from hold-
32:1048:78441:18:18:72:540:576:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:ing office, e.g.  by cultivating relationships with large contributors or obtaining appoint-
32:1049:78533:18:18:72:540:558:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:ments to powerful committees.  These possibilities generate adverse self-selection among
32:1050:78621:18:18:72:540:540:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:non-incumbents unless the electorate can differentiate sufficiently well between incumbents
32:1051:78712:18:18:72:540:522:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:of good and bad character. Future research may fruitfully examine the optimal choice of
32:1052:78799:18:24:72:525:504:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:term limits in light of these potentially opposing effects of longer terms on self-selection.
32:1053:78892:24:17:97:540:480:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:We have assumed throughout that insiders differ only with respect to honesty and
32:1054:78972:17:18:72:540:463:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:public-spiritedness.  Another potentially interesting dimension along which candidates may
32:1055:79062:18:18:72:540:445:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:differ is the relative weight they attach to monetary payments, public goods, effort, and
32:1056:79151:18:18:72:540:427:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:honesty. To take a simple case, suppose insiders are differentiated by a third characteristic,
32:1057:79245:18:18:72:539:409:143:g_d0_f8:143:g_d0_f2:m∈[0,1], that acts as a multiplier for all monetary payoffs (largermindicating greater
32:1058:79331:18:18:72:540:391:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:weight on money relative to other considerations). In multiple-candidate equilibria, elections
32:1059:79425:18:18:72:540:373:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:will tend to attract those with higher values ofm. The potential implications for the effects of
32:1060:79521:18:18:71:539:355:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:compensation and anti-corruption enforcement are intriguing. An increase in compensation,
32:1061:79610:18:18:71:540:337:143:g_d0_f8:143:g_d0_f2:s, will tend to attract candidates with higher values ofm, which is deleterious insofar as such
32:1062:79705:18:18:71:539:319:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:individuals will more easily succumb to the influence of special interests.  Thus, increasing
32:1063:79798:18:18:71:539:301:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:compensation mayreducethe quality of governance.  On the other hand, increasing anti-
32:1064:79883:18:24:72:338:283:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:corruption enforcement,σ, will not have that effect.
32:1065:79935:24:18:97:540:259:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:We have also assumed throughout that the special interest group interacts with politi-
32:1066:80021:18:17:72:540:241:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:cians only after they gain office.  In practice, such groups also encourage particular candi-
32:1067:80114:17:18:72:540:224:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:dates to run for office by supporting their campaigns.  In our model, lobbies plainly have
32:1068:80204:18:18:72:540:206:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:incentives to reduce entry barriers for citizens of low character such as Scoundrels. The im-
32:1069:80297:18:18:72:540:188:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:plications of allowing campaign contributions will depend on (i) the amount of information
32:1070:80387:18:18:72:540:170:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the lobby has about the candidate before he takes office, (ii) the likelihood that voters will
32:1071:80481:18:18:72:540:152:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:observe the contributions, (iii) the extent to which the incentives to support a Scoundrel are
32:1072:80575:18:18:72:540:134:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:diluted by the public goods problem among lobbies (all of which will prefer Scoundrels), and
32:1073:80667:18:0:72:459:116:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:(iv) the extent to which public interest groups provide offsetting incentives.

34:1137:83549:32:18:72:551:295:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Thus, the function Δ(a,0,y)isconvexina, hence is maximized only bya∈{0,1}.The

35:1149:84162:33:18:72:540:642:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:To see this, note first that ifg(hi,σ-)+(1+ai)q≥v, agentiwould never implement

35:1154:84572:18:18:72:540:552:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:(byAssumption 3), the continuity ofg(·,σ) implies that there is someh∗∈(hi,1) such that

35:1156:84717:23:18:97:540:511:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f9:Now we claim that under anti-corruption enforcementσ,theslateN={j(1),...,j(N)}

36:1220:87929:35:18:72:539:304:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f2:Proof.Recall fromfn. 24that the willing-candidate constraint for a single candidate is always
36:1221:88022:18:18:72:540:286:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:satisfied because the consequences of having no governor are sufficiently dire.  Moreover,
36:1222:88112:18:18:72:540:268:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:using (10)andLemma 3, the willing-bystander constraints in a single-candidate equilibrium

36:1225:88370:18:32:71:365:215:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:each component of his character (a, h), the result follows.

36:1227:88506:18:18:72:540:165:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:probabilities of running translate into probabilities of winning conditional on running for

36:1230:88782:16:12:72:540:113:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:of candidates is now stochastic;ρi(N,μ) encompasses both sources of randomness.  Note thatρi(N,μ)

37:1250:89737:23:18:97:540:443:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Note that, because all choices and electoral events are independent, the probability of

37:1256:90121:31:18:97:540:322:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:The equilibrium conditions for mixed strategies generalize those for pure strategies.
37:1257:90206:18:18:72:540:304:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Since the expected quality of governance is the same regardless of whetheriruns and loses

38:1282:90913:0:18:72:540:708:143:g_d0_f5:143:g_d0_f2:Proof ofTheorem 3.Fix anyk>0 and consider a sequence of restricted models, indexed by
38:1283:90998:18:18:71:540:690:143:g_d0_f8:143:g_d0_f2:m, such that in modelmthere are 2minsiders, consisting ofmSell-Outs andmScoundrels.
38:1284:91081:18:18:72:540:672:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:For each restricted model in this sequence, the entry game is finite and hence a mixed-strategy
38:1285:91176:18:24:72:513:654:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:equilibrium exists. Fix any selection of equilibria in the sequence of restricted models.
38:1286:91265:24:18:97:540:630:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Case 1: Suppose first that, for somem, the equilibrium has at least one Sell-Out and at
38:1287:91352:18:18:72:539:612:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:least one Scoundrel entering with zero probability. Then (20) is satisfied for all insiders who
38:1288:91447:18:18:72:540:594:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:enter with strictly positive probability, and (21) is satisfied for all insiders who enter with
38:1289:91542:18:18:72:540:576:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:zero probability.  This equilibrium remains an equilibrium when any number of Sell-Outs
38:1290:91629:18:18:72:539:558:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and Scoundrels are added so long as they enter with zero probability: (20) is unaffected and
38:1291:91721:18:18:72:540:540:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:therefore still satisfied for those who enter with positive probability; while (21) is unaffected
38:1292:91818:18:18:72:540:522:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:and therefore still satisfied by the original insiders who enter with zero probability as well
38:1293:91912:18:18:72:540:504:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:as the new insiders. ByLemma 3, it follows that (21) is also satisfied for any new insiders
38:1294:92003:18:17:71:539:486:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:of other character types.  Therefore, the equilibrium of modelmis also an equilibrium of
38:1295:92091:17:24:71:397:469:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:the unrestricted model, featuring a finite number of candidates.
38:1296:92155:24:18:97:539:445:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:Case 2:  Now suppose that, for allmrestricted models, either all Sell-Outs or all

38:1301:92418:18:18:72:540:391:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:listed in non-increasing order; and let-τmdenote the associated vector of entry probabilities
38:1302:92511:18:18:72:540:373:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:for Scoundrels, again listed in non-increasing order. Note that (20) implies that there must
38:1303:92603:18:18:72:540:355:143:g_d0_f2:143:g_d0_f2:be strictly positive lower bound on the probability of winning conditional on running, and

39:1369:94886:17:16:81:539:284:49:g_d0_f6:99:g_d0_f7:39To prove compactness, note that (22) implies that for anyε>0,thereisasomei-such that for all

39:1373:95239:15:12:72:540:232:99:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f7:is along the same lines): LetRKi(θ,τ)bei’s probability of winning conditional on running when the first
