2:23:1131:35:24:72:540:590:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:This paper examines how phased retirement plans in higher education create value for both the
2:24:1224:24:24:72:540:566:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:institution  and  individual  faculty,  based  upon  evidence  from  the  Survey  of  Changes  in  Faculty
2:25:1330:24:24:72:540:542:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:Retirement Policies and an in-depth case study of the University of North Carolina system. Faculty
2:26:1428:24:24:71:539:518:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:benefit by receiving improved opportunities for part-time work and by having the ability to make
2:27:1524:24:24:71:539:494:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:a smoother transition to retirement. The policy is clearly of great value to the 25 to 35 percent of
2:28:1624:24:24:71:540:470:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:UNC faculty who opt for phased over full retirement. The biggest payoff to the university is an
2:29:1719:24:24:72:539:446:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:increase in the odds that low-performing faculty will start the retirement process earlier. Universities
2:30:1823:24:24:72:540:422:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:also anticipate increased flexibility in managing faculty employment and compensation; phased
2:31:1916:24:31:72:540:398:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:retirement is most likely to be observed on campuses where a high percentage of faculty has tenure.

3:40:2190:0:27:90:517:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:           Higher education faces a unique challenge in the coming years as faculty 
3:41:2274:27:28:90:508:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:who are members of the baby boom generation near retirement.  There will be 
3:42:2350:28:27:90:520:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:one set of problems if the most senior faculty stay on too long and there will be a 
3:43:2434:27:28:90:475:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:different set of problems if they all leave at once.  With the elimination of 
3:44:2512:28:28:90:521:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:mandatory retirement in 1994, universities and colleges are concerned about the 
3:45:2592:28:27:90:514:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:possibility that many faculty will remain on the job past age 70.  There are fears 
3:46:2675:27:28:90:514:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that this will have adverse consequences for teaching and research productivity 
3:47:2755:28:27:90:504:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and will lead to higher tuition to cover salaries and benefits.  At the same time 
3:48:2837:27:28:90:493:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:there is concern on many campuses that the age distribution of faculty is so 
3:49:2914:28:28:90:524:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:heavily skewed toward the 50-and-over range that universities will face shortages 
3:50:2996:28:27:90:314:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in many fields by the end of this decade.   
3:51:3040:27:28:126:508:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:From a faculty perspective, there are serious challenges as well.  Some 
3:52:3112:28:27:90:487:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:faculty work longer than they would prefer simply because they are not yet 
3:53:3187:27:28:90:524:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:eligible for full pension and Social Security benefits.  The tenure system generally 
3:54:3272:28:28:90:514:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:does not permit part-time work, making it difficult for older faculty to cut back on 
3:55:3357:28:27:90:486:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:their work hours as they near retirement.  In the private sector, many older 
3:56:3434:27:28:90:505:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:workers take bridge jobs as they transition from full-time work into retirement.  
3:57:3516:28:27:90:509:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Although some faculty members have good options off campus, those in many 
3:58:3590:27:28:90:492:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:disciplines will have difficulty finding opportunities to apply the teaching and 
3:59:3671:28:28:90:402:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:research skills valued in academe to other types of work.   
3:60:3731:28:27:126:512:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Phased retirement has been introduced on many campuses to help deal 
3:61:3799:27:28:90:507:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with these challenges.  Under most phased retirement plans, faculty members 
3:62:3875:28:0:90:508:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:resign their full-time position (and often give up tenure) in return for the right to 
4:63:3962:0:27:90:510:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:work half-time at half-salary for a given number of years.  This paper examines 
4:64:4042:27:28:90:505:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:how phased retirement creates value for both the university and the individual 
4:65:4121:28:27:90:474:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:faculty member.  The analysis begins in Section I with a summary of the 
4:66:4193:27:28:90:514:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:theoretical arguments about how phased retirement should be able to help both 
4:67:4271:28:28:90:516:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sides of the academic labor market.  The paper then turns to empirical evidence 
4:68:4351:28:27:90:525:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that sheds light on why universities and colleges offer phased retirement and why 
4:69:4433:27:28:89:507:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:certain faculty accept it (and why others do not).   To obtain some insights into 
4:70:4515:28:27:89:516:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the motivation for phased retirement, Section II analyzes the odds that a college 
4:71:4597:27:28:89:524:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:or university will have a phased retirement policy.  Are research universities more 
4:72:4681:28:28:90:513:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:likely to offer phased retirement than four-year or two-year institutions?  Are the 
4:73:4765:28:27:90:489:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:odds of offering phased retirement linked to the age distribution of faculty?  
4:74:4844:27:28:90:505:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Section III is a detailed case study of the experience of the University of North 
4:75:4926:28:27:90:494:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Carolina (UNC) system with phased retirement.  The discussion shows how 
4:76:4998:27:28:90:499:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:many faculty opted for phased retirement, analyzes whether it accelerates or 
4:77:5075:28:28:90:514:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:postpones full retirement, and summarizes evidence on its overall effectiveness 
4:78:5155:28:27:90:521:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:from the perspectives of both faculty and management.  Section IV concludes by 
4:79:5234:27:28:90:520:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:summarizing which of the theoretical sources of value have been most important 
4:80:5313:28:27:90:158:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in practice.

4:83:5348:14:14:90:93:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: 
4:84:5348:14:27:126:492:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Absent a phased retirement plan, tenured university professors have 
4:85:5416:27:28:90:522:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:relatively few options for reducing their contracted work hours in the years before 
4:86:5500:28:0:90:510:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:they retire.  The tenure system at most universities does not allow for part-time 
5:87:5583:0:27:90:515:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:work on campus.  Faculty can resign and contract to work for the university part-
5:88:5664:27:28:90:504:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:time, but such contracts are usually for no more than one year and, in a world 
5:89:5743:28:27:90:497:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:where non-tenure track instructors provide teaching services at low cost, the 
5:90:5821:27:28:90:524:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:financial terms of such contracts are often  unattractive.  Faculty with the capacity 
5:91:5907:28:28:90:480:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to consult or do research for the private sector or government could have 
5:92:5981:28:27:90:493:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:attractive part-time opportunities off campus, but such opportunities may be 
5:93:6058:27:28:90:505:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:extremely limited in some academic disciplines.  Finally, even in today’s wired 
5:94:6138:28:27:90:510:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:labor market, jobs off-campus usually do not pop up after a few mouse clicks – 
5:95:6217:27:28:90:524:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:search and negotiation costs have to be factored into any decision about whether 
5:96:6298:28:28:90:345:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:seeking a part-time position is worth the effort.   
5:97:6350:28:27:126:522:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Given these constraints, consider a phased retirement contract that allows 
5:98:6425:27:28:90:511:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:a faculty member who has met certain age and years of service criteria to work 
5:99:6504:28:27:90:491:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:half-time at half-salary.  The value of such a contract is readily apparent for 
5:100:6584:27:28:90:483:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:faculty who have greater earnings potential on campus than off.  In purely 
5:101:6659:28:28:90:523:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:financial terms, the promise to pay half a salary for part-time work is equivalent to 
5:102:6745:28:27:90:523:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:an option to sell one’s labor back to the university at that price.  In the absence of 
5:103:6832:27:28:90:506:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:phased retirement, faculty would have to either (1) negotiate on their own with 
5:104:6912:28:27:90:511:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:department heads and deans when they retire to secure a commitment for part-
5:105:6988:27:28:90:484:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:time work or (2) look for work off-campus.  To see the value of the phased 
5:106:7063:28:28:90:505:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement option, compare the hourly rate under each of these two choices to 
5:107:7141:28:27:90:515:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the hourly rate that faculty receive while working (which they also would receive 
5:108:7223:27:28:90:521:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:under phased retirement).  The financial option created by phased retirement will 
5:109:7305:28:0:90:511:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:have no economic value for faculty who expect that they can negotiate a better 
6:110:7385:0:27:90:485:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:deal on their own with either the university or an off-campus organization.  
6:111:7462:27:28:90:521:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:However, if the hourly rate on campus dominates the other two alternatives, then 
6:112:7543:28:27:90:486:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:phased retirement provides greater earnings potential for individual faculty 
6:113:7620:27:28:90:147:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:members. 
6:114:7629:28:28:126:519:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:In some situations, phased retirement will enable professors to earn more 
6:115:7703:28:27:90:517:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:income while working fewer hours.  This happens whenever the sum of one-half 
6:116:7780:27:28:90:503:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of the academic salary and all pension income exceeds the regular academic 
6:117:7855:28:27:90:525:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:salary (or equivalently, if pension income exceeds one-half the academic salary).  
6:118:7938:27:28:90:510:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The ability to make more money and work less will be highly tempting to many, 
6:119:8016:28:28:90:503:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:but such a combination does not automatically predict movement into phased 
6:120:8091:28:27:90:524:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement.  When faculty near the age of eligibility for partial or full benefits under 
6:121:8180:27:28:90:510:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Social Security or a defined benefit pension, there is a tremendous incentive to 
6:122:8261:28:27:90:496:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:work an extra year because annuity income increases considerably at those 
6:123:8335:27:28:90:523:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:ages.  In such a situation, there is an economic logic behind working full-time one 
6:124:8419:28:28:90:524:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:more year, even if it means less income and more work than phased retirement.   
6:125:8499:28:27:126:486:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Faculty covered by defined contribution pensions face considerable 
6:126:8566:27:28:90:523:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:uncertainty about their pension income because the value of their pension hinges 
6:127:8647:28:27:90:493:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:on outcomes in financial markets.  Someone who fears that the value of the 
6:128:8722:27:28:90:519:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:assets in his or her retirement account are likely to decline could choose to retire 
6:129:8807:28:28:90:504:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in order to lock in an annuity on favorable terms.  Eligibility to receive pension 
6:130:8890:28:27:90:500:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:income is generally tied to severance from the university.  Phased retirement 
6:131:8968:27:0:90:521:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:allows faculty to start receiving pension income while continuing to work, thereby 
7:132:9052:0:27:90:500:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:allowing them to make their labor supply and annuity receipt decisions with a 
7:133:9130:27:28:90:284:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:greater degree of independence.      
7:134:9167:28:27:126:465:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:This discussion has emphasized financial benefits from phased 
7:135:9229:27:28:90:485:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement, but given the unique nature of academic labor markets, such a 
7:136:9303:28:28:90:470:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:narrow focus would lead one to underestimate the true value of phased 
7:137:9373:28:27:90:490:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement for faculty.  Most tenured faculty in their 50s and 60s have spent 
7:138:9451:27:28:89:501:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:virtually their entire life in school.  Phased retirement gives them extra time to 
7:139:9534:28:27:89:486:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:collect information about retirement opportunities and potential bridge jobs 
7:140:9611:27:28:89:508:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:outside academe before they exit the university.  The psychological benefits of 
7:141:9691:28:28:89:488:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:phased retirement will likely be substantial in many cases -- faculty receive 
7:142:9769:28:27:89:500:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:access to colleagues and academic resources, the opportunity to continue to 
7:143:9845:27:28:89:522:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:contribute in the classroom and in research, and the ability to still call themselves 
7:144:9931:28:27:89:224:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:members of the faculty.   
7:145:9957:27:28:125:476:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Even if phased retirement is a great deal for faculty, why should a 
7:146:10025:28:28:89:523:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:university consider offering such a benefit?  Half pay for half work may sound like 
7:147:10109:28:27:89:508:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:a wash at first, but phased retirees will expect to continue to receive employee 
7:148:10190:27:28:89:494:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:benefits, especially health insurance, along with their half-salary.  So unless 
7:149:10270:28:27:89:481:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:phased retirement can reduce labor costs along some other dimension or 
7:150:10341:27:28:89:511:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:improve professor performance, one must question whether it has any value to 
7:151:10418:28:28:89:156:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:universities. 
7:152:10432:28:27:125:522:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The first question university chancellors and presidents should ask is what 
7:153:10508:27:28:89:490:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:happens to faculty retirement rates?  Phased retirement makes bridge jobs 
7:154:10582:28:0:89:517:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:outside the university less attractive, leading faculty members seeking to reduce 
8:155:10665:0:27:90:502:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:work hours to stay with the university longer than they might have otherwise.  
8:156:10744:27:28:90:499:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:However, it also creates an option for part-time work on campus where none 
8:157:10819:28:27:90:510:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:previously existed, which will lead some faculty to enter phased retirement well 
8:158:10900:27:28:90:501:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:before the time they would have fully retired.  The one unambiguous effect of 
8:159:10978:28:28:90:519:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:phased retirement is that it accelerates the date at which faculty start to cut back 
8:160:11063:28:27:90:516:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:on their commitments to the university.  It also is conceivable that under phased 
8:161:11145:27:28:90:522:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement they will stay on campus more years than they would have otherwise.  
8:162:11225:28:27:90:517:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:For instance, a professor who might have fully retired at age 65 might choose to 
8:163:11306:27:28:90:490:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:enter phased retirement at age 62 and work until age 67.  Economic theory 
8:164:11380:28:28:90:491:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cannot predict whether the introduction of a phased retirement program will 
8:165:11456:28:27:90:500:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:accelerate or decelerate the rate at which faculty totally sever their ties to the 
8:166:11539:27:28:90:478:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:university.  One would expect that faculty who have the option of phased 
8:167:11612:28:27:90:519:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement would start the retirement process earlier than those who do not have 
8:168:11693:27:28:90:160:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that option.   
8:169:11708:28:28:126:485:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The second big question university leaders should ask is how will a 
8:170:11776:28:27:90:482:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:phased retirement program affect the productivity mix of the faculty?  The 
8:171:11851:27:28:90:485:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:nightmare scenario is where top researchers use phased retirement as an 
8:172:11923:28:27:90:504:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:opportunity to start a new business or an affiliation with another campus.  The 
8:173:12003:27:28:90:505:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:preferred scenario is where phased retirement gives unproductive faculty who 
8:174:12080:28:28:90:502:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:have become jaded with academe but who are not yet eligible for full pension 
8:175:12157:28:27:90:509:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:benefits a chance to exit gracefully.  Phased retirement is most attractive to (1) 
8:176:12240:27:28:90:513:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:faculty with the worst earnings opportunities off campus and (2) faculty who are 
8:177:12321:28:0:90:511:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:least likely to be able to negotiate for themselves a satisfactory part-time salary 
9:178:12406:0:27:90:501:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:on campus after regular retirement.  Assuming a positive correlation between 
9:179:12483:27:28:90:521:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:productivity on campus and either a negotiated part-time wage on campus or the 
9:180:12562:28:27:90:497:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:best wage opportunity off campus, this would imply that unproductive faculty 
9:181:12639:27:28:90:514:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:would be more likely to enter phased retirement than highly productive faculty.   
9:182:12721:28:28:126:505:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Given the manpower planning challenges facing university leaders that 
9:183:12791:28:27:90:519:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:were noted in the introduction, phased retirement also will create value if it leads 
9:184:12876:27:28:90:522:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to improved personnel planning and economizes on adjustment costs associated 
9:185:12953:28:27:90:497:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with new hires and retirements.  Under a formal phased retirement program, 
9:186:13028:27:28:90:523:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:professors announce their intention to leave typically between two to five years in 
9:187:13112:28:28:90:490:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:advance, a much longer time horizon than would be involved under regular 
9:188:13185:28:27:90:503:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement.  This should improve succession planning and thereby reduce the 
9:189:13261:27:28:90:514:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:odds of having unfilled positions or the likelihood of resorting to early retirement 
9:190:13346:28:27:89:517:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:buyouts or layoffs.  If provosts and deans decide to use the half-salary saved by 
9:191:13428:27:28:89:491:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:phased retirement on non-tenure track instructors, there is the possibility of 
9:192:13507:28:28:90:257:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:simple cost reduction as well.1

9:199:13850:8:19:90:493:160:64:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:1 Leslie and Janson (2004) offer a different perspective for the motivation of 
9:200:13929:19:14:90:493:141:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:universities that offer phased retirement.  Based on a series of interviews at 
9:201:14008:14:14:90:488:127:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:different campuses, they conclude that universities start phased retirement 
9:202:14084:14:13:90:498:113:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:because it “humanizes employee relations.”   They conclude that most of the 
9:203:14160:13:14:90:478:100:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:benefits from phased retirement accrue to the individual faculty member, 
9:204:14233:14:12:90:406:86:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:whereas the benefits to the institution appear less certain.

10:207:14373:27:28:90:513:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:examined U.S. institutions of higher learning in all five Carnegie categories with 
10:208:14456:28:27:90:524:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:75 or more full-time faculty members.  At the time of the survey, 27 percent of the 
10:209:14540:27:28:90:486:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:responding institutions had a phased retirement program in place.2  These 
10:210:14614:28:28:89:327:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:programs had the following characteristics:   
10:211:14660:28:28:107:524:570:144:Symbol:144:g_d0_f3:A:• Faculty in most programs (64 percent) must obtain administrative approval 
10:212:14736:28:28:125:207:542:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:to participate.   
10:213:14754:28:28:107:478:514:144:Symbol:144:g_d0_f3:A:• Most programs require faculty to reach minimum levels of age (75 
10:214:14821:28:28:125:482:486:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:percent) and years of service (73 percent) to be eligible for phased 
10:215:14890:28:27:125:500:458:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:retirement.  The modal age requirement is 55, but some programs are 
10:216:14958:27:28:125:506:431:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:open to 50-year-olds whereas many others require participants to be at 
10:217:15029:28:27:125:499:403:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:least 60.  Programs typically require 10 or more years of service to be 
10:218:15101:27:29:125:176:376:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:eligible.   
10:219:15113:29:27:107:503:347:144:Symbol:144:g_d0_f3:A:• A minority of programs (21 percent) put a ceiling on age of eligibility, in 
10:220:15191:27:29:125:260:320:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:most cases 62 or higher. 
10:221:15216:29:27:107:512:291:144:Symbol:144:g_d0_f3:A:• Roughly two-thirds of the programs provide special financial benefits.  In 
10:222:15293:27:28:125:494:264:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:most cases the special benefit is full contribution to health insurance, 
10:223:15366:28:28:125:475:236:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:although some institutions provide extra salary payments or extra 
10:224:15432:28:28:125:294:208:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:retirement payments or credits.

10:226:15537:28:27:125:503:152:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:before they enter phased retirement.  Faculty members generally must 
10:227:15606:27:23:125:507:125:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:lose their tenured status after three or five years in phased retirement.

10:229:15730:8:20:90:505:94:64:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:2 Ehrenberg (2003) summarizes the key features of the programs that were in 
10:230:15806:20:0:89:187:74:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:place at that time. 
11:231:15827:0:27:126:504:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:One way to potentially better understand the motivation behind phased 
11:232:15897:27:28:90:521:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement plans is to compare the characteristics of universities which offer such 
11:233:15981:28:27:90:513:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:plans to those which do not.  It is reasonable to expect that the value of phased 
11:234:16063:27:28:90:472:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement to the institution should be a function of its mission.  Doctoral 
11:235:16140:28:28:90:491:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:institutions must be especially sensitive to the orderly replacement of aging 
11:236:16218:28:27:90:471:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:faculty to be competitive for graduate students and research contracts.  
11:237:16291:27:28:90:503:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Presuming that phased retirement polices provide improved capacity to make 
11:238:16366:28:27:90:498:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:long run plans for staffing, one would expect doctoral universities to be more 
11:239:16445:27:28:90:514:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:likely to adopt such policies.  In contrast, universities and colleges that focus on 
11:240:16530:28:28:90:522:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:teaching, especially baccalaureate and 2-year institutions, have more flexibility in 
11:241:16615:28:27:90:478:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:how they replace aging faculty members and thus may not value phased 
11:242:16684:27:28:90:521:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement as much.  These patterns are borne out in the SCFRP data, as shown 
11:243:16762:28:27:90:509:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in Table 1.  Phased retirement programs are most commonly observed among 
11:244:16835:27:28:90:522:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:doctoral universities (35 percent).  The percentage of masters and baccalaureate 
11:245:16916:28:28:90:510:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:institutions with phased retirement plans is slightly lower (29 percent), whereas 
11:246:16998:28:27:90:489:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the percentage of two-year institutions is considerably lower (16 percent).   
11:247:17076:27:28:126:525:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The age and tenure structure of the faculty also should have some bearing 
11:248:17150:28:27:90:502:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:on the value of phased retirement to the institution.  Colleges and universities 
11:249:17231:27:28:90:502:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with a high percentage of faculty who are near retirement have much more to 
11:250:17307:28:28:90:494:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:gain from successfully managing the transition to retirement than those with 
11:251:17384:28:27:89:513:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:relatively fewer faculty in their 50s and 60s.  There is no systematic relationship 
11:252:17468:27:28:89:509:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:between the age structure of the faculty and the adoption of phased retirement 
11:253:17547:28:0:90:471:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:policies across the campuses in the SCFRP sample (Table 1).  Phased 
12:254:17617:0:27:90:505:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement policies are most prevalent among schools with 30 to 39 percent of 
12:255:17695:27:28:90:507:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:faculty in the 55-and-over age bracket and least prevalent among schools with 
12:256:17773:28:27:90:494:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:fewer than 30 percent of faculty in this age bracket, as expected.  However, 
12:257:17850:27:28:90:514:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:phased retirement policies are least common among schools with 40 percent or 
12:258:17927:28:28:90:477:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:more of faculty in this age bracket, which runs contrary to expectations.   
12:259:18003:28:27:126:511:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Holding age structure constant, tenure has an obviously large impact on 
12:260:18075:27:28:90:473:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the degrees of freedom the institution has available to manage an aging 
12:261:18147:28:27:90:518:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:workforce.  Institutions with a high percentage of tenured faculty have much less 
12:262:18229:27:28:90:503:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:flexibility than those with relatively low percentages of tenured faculty.  To the 
12:263:18312:28:28:90:490:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:extent that tenured faculties are also highly compensated faculties, phased 
12:264:18388:28:27:90:465:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement plans also generate greater opportunities for cost savings.   
12:265:18461:27:28:90:518:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Empirically, there appears to be a strong relationship between the percentage of 
12:266:18542:28:27:90:525:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:full-time faculty with tenure and the adoption of phased retirement policies.  Table 
12:267:18627:27:28:90:524:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:1 shows that the percentage of schools with phased retirement steadily increases 
12:268:18708:28:28:89:508:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with the percentage of full-time faculty with tenure.  Phased retirement policies 
12:269:18790:28:27:89:522:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:are in place at only 16.5 percent of the schools where less than 40 percent of the 
12:270:18873:27:28:89:523:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:faculty have tenure.  In contrast, phased retirement is available at 25.3 percent of 
12:271:18958:28:27:90:496:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the schools where the tenure ratio is 40 to 49 percent, at 30.2 percent of the 
12:272:19037:27:28:90:486:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:schools where the tenure ratio is 50 to 69 percent, and 33.7 percent of the 
12:273:19113:28:28:90:387:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:schools where the tenure ratio is 70 percent or higher.   
12:274:19171:28:27:126:508:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The fit between a phased retirement plan and the pension plan must be 
12:275:19241:27:28:90:510:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:assessed carefully.  Defined benefit plans are a poor fit with phased retirement 
12:276:19322:28:0:90:497:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for two reasons.  First, the pension payment under defined benefit plans is a 
13:277:19402:0:27:90:507:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:function of final average salary, which means that a move to a half-time job on 
13:278:19482:27:28:90:514:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:campus is also a move to as much as a 50 percent cut in one’s pension (unless 
13:279:19560:28:27:90:510:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the retiree can start receiving the annuity upon entering phased retirement or a 
13:280:19641:27:28:90:501:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:special exemption for phased retirees can be created in the benefit formula).  
13:281:19720:28:28:90:524:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Second, the formulas for most defined benefit plans are set up in such a way that 
13:282:19802:28:27:90:511:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the present value of the pension annuity is maximized at the time the individual 
13:283:19883:27:28:90:490:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:becomes eligible for full retirement benefits.  The pension-based incentives 
13:284:19960:28:27:90:504:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:facing these individuals for retirement are extremely powerful and are likely to 
13:285:20041:27:28:90:511:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:reduce the value of retirement-management policies to the university.   Phased 
13:286:20120:28:28:90:524:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement plans are likely to be a better fit on campuses with defined contribution 
13:287:20205:28:27:90:487:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:plans because they offer managers a mechanism to productively influence 
13:288:20277:27:28:90:505:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement decisions.  The data in Table 1 show a strong relationship between 
13:289:20355:28:27:90:490:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:type of pension plan and the adoption of phased retirement plans.  Phased 
13:290:20429:27:28:90:518:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement is available at 38 percent of schools which exclusively have a defined 
13:291:20511:28:28:90:517:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:contribution plan, versus 19 percent of schools which exclusively have a defined 
13:292:20592:28:27:90:166:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:benefit plan.   
13:293:20608:27:28:126:484:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Private colleges and universities are likely to have more degrees of 
13:294:20677:28:27:90:516:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:freedom to adopt phased retirement plans than their public counterparts.  Public 
13:295:20758:27:28:90:499:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:colleges and universities tend to be less autonomous, facing some degree of 
13:296:20834:28:28:90:519:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:oversight from state government.  In some states, public institutions are part of a 
13:297:20918:28:27:90:499:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:statewide system, which would have mixed effects on the odds of adopting a 
13:298:20993:27:28:90:510:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:phased retirement plan.  On the one hand, there would be greater transactions 
13:299:21071:28:0:90:515:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:costs associated with adopting a new policy in a statewide system than a single 
14:300:21153:0:27:90:517:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:campus.  On the other hand, a successful launch of a statewide plan would lead 
14:301:21232:27:28:89:516:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to earlier adoption on campuses that left on their own would not have adopted a 
14:302:21312:28:27:89:507:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:plan.  Further, private schools may have such an advantage in dealing one-on-
14:303:21389:27:28:89:523:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:one with individual faculty about their compensation and workloads that they may 
14:304:21470:28:28:89:505:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:have little need for a phased retirement policy.  In the SCFRP data in Table 1, 
14:305:21550:28:27:89:489:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:there is very little difference in the odds of having a phased retirement plan 
14:306:21629:27:28:89:310:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:between public and private institutions.3   
14:307:21673:28:27:126:492:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The adoption of phased retirement policies is also likely to reflect the 
14:308:21746:27:28:90:498:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:management style of the organization.  Institutions that have decided to take 
14:309:21824:28:28:90:511:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:active steps to manage the age structure of their faculty are likely to consider a 
14:310:21907:28:27:90:507:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:variety of steps, rather than focus on a single policy.  If true, one would expect 
14:311:21990:27:28:90:511:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:campuses that have phased retirement policies to also have taken other steps, 
14:312:22068:28:27:90:469:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:including seminars on retirement planning, financial incentives for early 
14:313:22142:27:28:90:501:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement, and targeted buyouts.  These patterns are born out in the SCFRP 
14:314:22218:28:28:90:524:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:data, as shown in Table 1.  Phased retirement plans are available in 29.2 percent 
14:315:22300:28:27:90:519:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of the schools that offer retirement planning seminars or programs, in contrast to

14:317:22459:28:27:90:470:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:policies are in place in 31.9 percent of the schools that offered financial 
14:318:22535:27:28:90:515:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:incentives for retirement since 1995, versus 22.7 percent of the schools that did 
14:319:22617:28:28:90:499:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:not offer such incentives.  Phased retirement is available at 32 percent of the 
14:320:22697:28:54:90:519:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:schools that offered buyouts to faculty since 1995 (either on a college-by-college

14:323:22902:20:0:89:442:74:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:private university (Syracuse) adopted its phased retirement plan.

15:327:23130:27:28:89:524:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:instance, it is well known that the tenure ratio is much lower at baccalaureate and 
15:328:23214:28:28:89:515:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:two-year schools than at doctoral and masters level institutions.  Probit analysis

15:333:23618:28:28:89:522:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:do not have one).  Table 2 reports the results of a probit analysis of the odds that 
15:334:23703:28:27:89:508:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:a campus will have a phased retirement plan, using the variables from Table 1 
15:335:23781:27:28:89:519:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:along with number of full-time faculty.  The number of full-time faculty is included 
15:336:23866:28:27:90:515:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in the analysis to determine whether there are economies of scale involved with 
15:337:23946:27:28:90:524:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:developing and implementing phased retirement plans.  If the costs of developing 
15:338:24027:28:28:90:506:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:a phased retirement plan increase less rapidly with size than the benefits, one 
15:339:24107:28:27:90:521:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:would expect that small schools would be less willing than large schools to adopt 
15:340:24189:27:28:90:152:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the plans.   
15:341:24202:28:27:126:520:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:In the probit analysis, three variables stand out as significant predictors of 
15:342:24281:27:28:90:494:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the odds that a campus will have a phased retirement plan.  Institutions that 
15:343:24359:28:28:90:502:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:exclusively offer a defined contribution plan have a 23 to 24 percentage point 
15:344:24438:28:27:89:510:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:greater probability of offering phased retirement than schools that offer defined 
15:345:24520:27:28:89:508:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:benefit plans.  This reflects both the poor fit between defined benefit plans and 
15:346:24602:28:0:89:509:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:phased retirement policies as well as the possible use of phased retirement for 
16:347:24684:0:27:90:495:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:strategic human resource management on campuses that only offer defined

16:349:24779:28:27:125:522:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Schools with a large percentage of tenured faculty are much more likely to 
16:350:24854:27:28:89:515:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:have phased retirement plans than schools with a relatively small percentage of 
16:351:24934:28:28:89:502:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:tenured faculty.  At the extreme, a school where all faculty have tenure would 
16:352:25013:28:27:89:517:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:have a 38 to 40 percent greater chance of having a phased retirement plan than 
16:353:25092:27:28:89:513:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:a school where none have tenure.  Percentage of faculty with tenure is strongly 
16:354:25172:28:27:89:478:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:correlated with Carnegie categorization, so the analysis was repeated by 
16:355:25245:27:28:89:519:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:estimating separate probit models for each Carnegie class (these results are not 
16:356:25326:28:28:89:487:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:reported in Table 2; they are available from the author upon request).  The 
16:357:25402:28:27:89:485:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:decrease in sample size makes these results more fragile, but percentage 
16:358:25475:27:28:89:493:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:tenured was still statistically significant at or near the p=0.10 threshold in all 
16:359:25558:28:27:89:515:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:levels of institutions except two-year institutions without faculty ranks.  Note that

16:367:26124:8:19:90:477:176:64:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:4 Pencavel (2004) finds the same thing.  His model differs in that phased 
16:368:26198:19:14:89:512:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement and other retirement policies are jointly determined, which leads him 
16:369:26279:14:8:89:315:143:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to use a different set of control variables.   
16:370:26326:8:19:90:515:135:64:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:5 This can be easily explained by the strong correlation between Carnegie class 
16:371:26406:19:14:90:506:116:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and the tenure ratio.  In Carnegie I institutions, if one takes simple unweighted 
16:372:26488:14:14:90:485:102:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:averages across schools, 64 percent of faculty have tenure in the average 
16:373:26562:14:14:90:516:88:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:school.  This falls off to 54 percent in IIA, 46 percent in IIB, 45 percent in III, and 
16:374:26650:14:0:90:191:74:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:32 percent in IV.    
17:375:26673:0:27:90:499:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Schools that have offered retirement planning seminars are 12 percent more 
17:376:26748:27:28:90:507:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:likely to have phased retirement plans than schools that have not offered such 
17:377:26827:28:27:90:504:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:seminars.  Schools that have offered financial incentives for retirement before 
17:378:26907:27:28:90:517:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:age 70 are 10 percent more likely to have phased retirement plans than schools 
17:379:26986:28:28:90:480:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that have not offered such incentives.  There is no significant relationship 
17:380:27063:28:27:90:486:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:between buyouts by college or individual and the odds of having a phased 
17:381:27136:27:28:90:524:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement plan.  Public institutions have a 10 percentage point greater probability 
17:382:27221:28:27:90:482:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of having a phased retirement plan than private institutions.  This effect is 
17:383:27299:27:28:90:486:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:statistically significant at the 6 to 10 percent level, a bit below the standard 
17:384:27380:28:28:90:273:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:threshold used in social science.   
17:385:27416:28:27:126:518:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:There was no evidence in the probit analysis of economies of scale in the

17:387:27571:28:27:90:502:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:age structure of the faculty and the odds of having a phased retirement plan.  
17:388:27650:27:28:90:517:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:This conclusion was robust across a number of other measures of age structure 
17:389:27728:28:28:90:369:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(e.g., percentage above 60, percentage below 50).   
17:390:27780:28:27:126:513:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:To sum up, this discussion shows that phased retirement plans have not

17:392:27924:28:27:90:475:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:leaders have carefully considered preexisting conditions such as type of

17:394:28075:28:28:90:518:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:campuses with a high percentage of faculty members with tenure are most likely 
17:395:28154:28:27:90:506:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to have phased retirement plans (as well as retirement planning seminars and

18:404:28667:28:28:126:504:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The percentage of faculty in the UNC system who are age 50 or higher 
18:405:28736:28:27:90:513:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:has increased considerably in the 1980s and 1990s, following national trends.7  
18:406:28816:27:28:89:485:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:In 1996 UNC President C.D. Spangler appointed a committee to study the 
18:407:28887:28:27:89:521:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:possible need for early retirement programs.  Because the university system was 
18:408:28967:27:28:89:517:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:predicted to add 40,000 students in the first decade of the 2000s, the committee 
18:409:29048:28:28:89:508:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:concluded that there was no need for an early-retirement program designed to 
18:410:29125:28:27:89:505:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:reduce the number of faculty members above a given age threshold.  Instead, 
18:411:29201:27:28:89:516:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:they recommended that the UNC system consider a phased retirement program 
18:412:29275:28:27:90:467:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that would moderate the aging of the faculty without increasing costs.

19:431:30684:28:27:90:490:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:required to implement a phased retirement program.8  To be eligible for the 
19:432:30760:27:28:90:522:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:program, faculty must be tenured.  When the program was launched, faculty also 
19:433:30839:28:27:90:521:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:had to be age 50 with 20 years of service or age 60 with 5 years of service at the

19:437:31163:27:28:90:512:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:year and a maximum length of five years.  Twelve of the 15 institutions chose a 
19:438:31243:28:27:90:523:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:three-year phased retirement contract, two institutions chose a two-year contract, 
19:439:31326:27:28:90:479:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and one campus chose a five-year phased retirement contract.  Although 
19:440:31397:28:28:90:468:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:launched as a five-year pilot, the program is now permanently in place. 
19:441:31469:28:27:126:493:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Individuals considering entering the program negotiate their half-time 
19:442:31540:27:28:90:515:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:duties with their department chairs prior to accepting phased retirement.  Duties 
19:443:31622:28:27:90:506:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:could be performed evenly across both semesters or the individual could work 
19:444:31699:27:28:90:516:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:full-time one semester and have no specific assigned duties the next semester.  
19:445:31779:28:28:90:473:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:They may elect to start receiving pension benefits after entering phased 
19:446:31852:28:27:90:512:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement.  If they begin their retirement benefits, they are eligible for the same 
19:447:31937:27:16:90:501:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:health insurance as active employees.  Since 1971, newly hired faculty in the

20:453:32238:27:28:90:493:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for teachers and state employees or a variety of defined contribution plans.  
20:454:32316:28:27:90:457:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Faculty hired in earlier years are covered by the defined benefit plan. 
20:455:32388:27:28:125:515:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Robert Clark, Linda Ghent and I have studied the phased retirement plan 
20:456:32460:28:28:89:520:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of the UNC system using the annual faculty censuses that each campus submits 
20:457:32537:28:27:90:512:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to the Office of the President.  These are the employment records for all faculty 
20:458:32619:27:28:90:503:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employed as of September of the specified year.  Information on each person 
20:459:32695:28:27:89:524:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:includes age, hire date, rank, gender, race, tenure status, annual salary, and type 
20:460:32779:27:28:89:509:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of pension plan.  The annual records are linked across years so we are able to 
20:461:32858:28:28:89:508:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:determine whether an individual remains in his or her faculty position from one 
20:462:32938:28:27:89:518:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:year to the next.  The census data for the years 1994 until 2003 are employed in 
20:463:33019:27:28:89:515:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:this study.  The analysis is limited to faculty members who were eligible to enter 
20:464:33102:28:27:89:514:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the phased retirement program.  This paper briefly summarizes the key findings 
20:465:33181:27:28:89:504:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of our earlier papers and then reports new evidence on the experience faculty 
20:466:33259:28:28:89:400:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and department heads have had with phased retirement.   
20:467:33315:28:27:125:485:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:In the three years prior to the introduction of phased retirement, the 
20:468:33386:27:28:89:520:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement rate from UNC institutions among eligible faculty age 50 averaged 8.7 
20:469:33467:28:27:89:515:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percent (see Table 3).  After the introduction of the new retirement program, the 
20:470:33549:27:28:89:501:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:total retirement rate (full retirement plus phased retirement) increased to 10.4 
20:471:33630:28:28:89:508:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percent in 1997-98, 11.3 percent in 1998-99, and 10.4 percent in 1999-20009.  
20:472:33708:28:27:89:519:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The percentage of faculty selecting phased retirement was 3.2 in 1997-98, 2.3 in 
20:473:33789:27:27:89:499:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:1998-99, and 3.0 in 1999-2000.  The full retirement rates were 7.2 percent in 
20:474:33867:27:8:90:237:102:121:g_d0_f3:121:g_d0_f3:F:                                                 
20:475:33915:8:20:90:519:94:64:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:9 The retirement rates represent the percentage of eligible faculty in census year 
20:476:33998:20:0:90:300:74:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:t who were retired in census year t+1.   
21:477:34041:0:27:90:505:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:1997-98, 9.0 percent in 1998-99, and 7.4 percent in 1999-2000.  During these 
21:478:34118:27:28:90:519:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:years, phased retirees represented between 20 and 31 percent of all retirements 
21:479:34198:28:27:90:525:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:from the UNC system.  In absolute numbers, about 70 faculty entered the phased 
21:480:34277:27:28:90:418:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement program each year while around 225 fully retired.   
21:481:34340:28:28:126:503:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The percentage of faculty entering full and phased retirement began to 
21:482:34411:28:27:90:518:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:decline in 2000-01, which is the same time that the stock market began to drop.  
21:483:34492:27:28:90:514:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:From 1999-2000 to 2002-03 the full retirement rate had fallen by more than half 
21:484:34572:28:27:90:520:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to 3.3 percent.  Over the same period, the phased retirement rate had fallen by a 
21:485:34654:27:28:90:522:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:third to 2.0 percent.  In the 2000s, phased retirement accounted for 35 percent of 
21:486:34737:28:28:90:514:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:total retirement.  In absolute numbers, 71 faculty entered the phased retirement 
21:487:34818:28:27:90:341:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:each year in the 2000s while 130 fully retired.   
21:488:34868:27:28:126:502:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Table 4 shows how phased and full retirement rates vary by age in the 
21:489:34938:28:27:90:492:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:1990s.  In most years, the full retirement rate increases steadily with age, a 
21:490:35017:27:28:90:500:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:pattern consistent with previous research.  A similar pattern holds for phased 
21:491:35096:28:28:90:488:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement in 1997-98, with more faculty age 70 and over selecting phased 
21:492:35170:28:27:90:524:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement than full retirement.  In 1998-99 and 1999-2000, the phased retirement 
21:493:35252:27:28:90:476:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:rate rises with age through the early to mid-60s, but then declines.  In all 
21:494:35329:28:27:90:518:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:likelihood the very large response of the 70 and over group in 1997-98 reflects a 
21:495:35411:27:28:90:497:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:constrained demand for phased retirement at the time it was implemented.    
21:496:35487:28:28:126:480:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Ghent, Allen, and Clark (2001) and Allen, Clark, and Ghent (2003) 
21:497:35553:28:27:90:500:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:conducted an analysis of how those entering phased retirement differed from 
21:498:35629:27:0:90:501:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:those who continued working full-time and those who entered full retirement.  
22:499:35709:0:27:90:454:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The following are the key findings of those two studies regarding the 
22:500:35779:27:29:90:422:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:characteristics of those most likely to enter phased retirement: 
22:501:35844:29:27:126:480:652:144:Symbol:144:g_d0_f3:A:• Those entering phased retirement were much more likely to be 
22:502:35907:27:28:144:510:625:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:employed at masters and baccalaureate universities than at doctoral 
22:503:35975:28:27:144:491:597:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:universities.  This may reflect differences in teaching loads and a 
22:504:36043:27:28:144:483:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:tendency to focus on teaching loads in negotiating duties under 
22:505:36107:28:28:144:517:542:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:phased retirement.  Faculty who teach eight courses a year can buy a 
22:506:36176:28:27:144:485:514:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:lot more free time by going half-time than faculty who teach four 
22:507:36242:27:28:144:472:487:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:courses a year.  It is also possible that faculty on the doctoral 
22:508:36308:28:27:144:509:459:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:campuses (NC State and UNC-Chapel Hill) have more opportunities 
22:509:36372:27:29:144:289:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:for bridge jobs off campus. 
22:510:36400:29:27:126:505:403:144:Symbol:144:g_d0_f3:A:• Faculty who are covered by the defined benefit plan are much more 
22:511:36468:27:28:144:494:376:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:likely to enter phased retirement than those who selected defined 
22:512:36534:28:28:144:517:348:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:contribution plans.  This likely reflects the strong incentives to retire at 
22:513:36611:28:27:144:519:320:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:the age of eligibility for full pension benefits, and may be influenced by 
22:514:36686:27:28:144:511:293:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Social Security as well.  Reduced earnings during phased retirement 
22:515:36754:28:27:144:513:265:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:do not adversely affect retirement benefits for faculty who elected the 
22:516:36826:27:29:144:259:238:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:defined benefit plan.  
22:517:36849:29:27:126:497:209:144:Symbol:144:g_d0_f3:A:• The odds of entering phased retirement by age map closely to the 
22:518:36916:27:28:144:493:182:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:odds of entering full retirement by age; in both cases, there is are 
22:519:36985:28:28:144:462:154:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:significant upswings in retirement odds at ages 62 and 65.

23:523:37068:27:28:90:508:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Why do faculty enter phased retirement?  The Office of the President of 
23:524:37140:28:27:90:514:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the UNC system conducted surveys of faculty in phased retirement in 1998 and 
23:525:37217:27:28:90:513:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:2003 to address this question.  The reason given by most faculty (60 percent in 
23:526:37297:28:28:90:484:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the 1998 survey and 69 percent in the 2003 survey) is that they wanted to 
23:527:37371:28:27:90:473:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:“gradually transition into retirement.”  Very few planned to “pursue other 
23:528:37446:27:28:90:524:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employment” (6 percent in 1998 and 1 percent in 2003), whereas a modest share 
23:529:37524:28:27:90:513:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:planned to “pursue other interests” (18 percent in 1998 and 9 percent in 2003).  
23:530:37605:27:28:90:512:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The remainder cited other factors, including health, changing university policies 
23:531:37687:28:28:90:447:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(including post-tenure review), and inability to afford full retirement. 
23:532:37760:28:27:89:493:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: More insight can be obtained when one looks at how faculty entering 
23:533:37828:27:28:89:480:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:phased retirement changed their allocation of time to university and other 
23:534:37903:28:27:89:516:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:activities.  Table 5 summarizes how faculty changed their on-campus workloads 
23:535:37981:27:28:89:501:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:after entering phased retirement.  The average number of courses taught per 
23:536:38057:28:28:89:499:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:year dropped by 44 percent from 4.3 to 2.4.  In most individual cases, faculty 
23:537:38136:28:27:89:520:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:loads dropped by exactly 50 percent, but a few faculty had equal or even greater 
23:538:38217:27:28:89:524:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:teaching loads, either because they were leaving administrative posts or because 
23:539:38298:28:27:89:523:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:they cut back on time for research and service.  Most faculty (60 percent) worked 
23:540:38380:27:28:89:327:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:at the university both academic semesters.   
23:541:38425:28:28:89:516:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Going beyond teaching, the biggest change in time allocation on campus 
23:542:38496:28:27:89:489:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:involved a significant cutback on administrative activities.  Among the 2003 
23:543:38573:27:28:89:514:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:phased retirees who responded to the survey, 32 percent had an administrative 
23:544:38651:28:0:89:519:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:appointment.  Across the entire sample, time allocated to administration fell from 
24:545:38736:0:27:90:515:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:24 percent on a full-time basis before phased retirement to 10 percent on a part-
24:546:38817:27:28:89:519:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:time basis after phased retirement.  Faculty spent about the same percentage of 
24:547:38897:28:27:89:497:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:their time on public service and extension activities before and after entering 
24:548:38977:27:28:89:481:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:phased retirement.  There was a slight increase in the percentage of time 
24:549:39051:28:28:89:507:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:allocated to research, but total time allocated to research dropped significantly 
24:550:39133:28:27:89:487:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(28 percent of time on a full-time basis to 30 percent of time on a part-time 
24:551:39211:27:28:89:134:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:basis).   
24:552:39221:28:27:89:500:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: With their on-campus workload reduced by 50 percent, how do faculty 
24:553:39289:27:28:89:498:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:reallocate their time?  Roughly two-thirds of the sample (67.7 percent) report 
24:554:39368:28:28:89:468:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:spending more time in activities with friends, family, and community.  A 
24:555:39441:28:27:89:522:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:substantial share (42.7 percent) report spending more time “engaged in research 
24:556:39521:27:28:89:511:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:or other creative or scholarly activities,” spending 16.9 hours per week on such 
24:557:39602:28:27:89:474:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:activities.  Exactly one-third of the sample report spending more time on 
24:558:39676:27:28:89:501:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:volunteer activities and family assistance, spending 7 hours a week.  Only 22 
24:559:39754:28:28:89:510:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percent report spending more time working for pay away off-campus (including 
24:560:39831:28:27:89:500:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:self-employment) and these individuals spend 11.5 hours per week working.  
24:561:39906:27:28:89:506:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Phased retirees also spent more time on civic activities, taking classes, travel, 
24:562:39988:28:27:89:178:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and health care. 
24:563:40005:27:28:89:497:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Faculty almost always begin receiving pension benefits upon entering 
24:564:40074:28:28:89:502:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:phased retirement.  In the 1998 survey, all faculty entering phased retirement 
24:565:40153:28:27:89:486:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:started receiving benefits, whereas in 2003, 90.5 percent started receiving 
24:566:40229:27:28:89:515:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:benefits.  The decision to start receiving Social Security as well largely depends 
24:567:40312:28:0:89:499:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:on age.  In the 2003 survey, 42 percent started receiving Social Security and 
25:568:40392:0:27:90:523:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:those individuals were considerably older (68.7 years) than those who postponed 
25:569:40472:27:28:90:343:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Social Security or were ineligible (62.4 years).   
25:570:40523:28:27:89:501:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: In the 2003 survey, faculty were asked to estimate what percentage of 
25:571:40593:27:28:89:480:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:their earnings in their last year of university employment was replaced by 
25:572:40668:28:28:89:496:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:pension benefits (excluding Social Security).  There was no small amount of 
25:573:40744:28:27:89:517:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:noise in the responses, including a value of zero for a person who claimed to be 
25:574:40825:27:28:89:503:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in the defined benefit pension plan with 30 or more years of service.  The raw 
25:575:40904:28:27:89:506:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:mean response was a replacement rate of 39.2 percent.  If one trims all cases 
25:576:40982:27:28:89:507:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:from the sample where the estimated percentage was below five (almost all of 
25:577:41059:28:28:90:509:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:which claim 25 years or more of service), the mean replacement rate becomes 
25:578:41135:28:27:90:170:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:46.0 percent.   
25:579:41151:27:28:90:504:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Faculty in phased retirement came fairly close to maintaining their total 
25:580:41225:28:27:90:492:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:level of income.  For the average respondent in the 2003 survey, combined 
25:581:41299:27:28:90:486:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:income from pensions, Social Security, and phased retirement equaled 90 
25:582:41371:28:28:90:524:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percent of university earnings before entering phased retirement.  Almost half (42 
25:583:41454:28:27:90:515:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of 86 respondents) reported that they had replaced 100 percent or more of their 
25:584:41534:27:28:90:484:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:income.  The overwhelming majority (95 percent) said that their combined 
25:585:41607:28:27:90:490:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:income was about what they expected before entering phased retirement.   
25:586:41680:27:28:90:508:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: With nearly the same income and a 50 percent reduction in work hours, 
25:587:41750:28:28:90:504:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:one would expect most faculty entering phased retirement to be very satisfied 
25:588:41828:28:27:90:513:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with the arrangement.  In 1998, 80 percent said they were pleased with phased 
25:589:41906:27:28:90:500:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement, 17 percent said they were somewhat pleased, and 3 percent said 
25:590:41981:28:0:90:221:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:they were not pleased.   
26:591:42008:0:27:90:523:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:In 2003, 60 percent strongly agreed that they were “pleased with my participation 
26:592:42090:27:28:90:509:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in the Phased Retirement Program and would make the same decision again,” 
26:593:42164:28:27:90:505:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:33 percent agreed, 6 percent disagreed, and 1 percent strongly disagreed.  In 
26:594:42242:27:28:90:514:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:1998, 89.7 percent said they would recommend the phased retirement program 
26:595:42317:28:28:89:478:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to their colleagues.  In 2003, 59 percent strongly agreed that they “would 
26:596:42392:28:27:89:493:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:recommend the Phased Retirement Program to my colleagues,” 30 percent 
26:597:42462:27:28:89:428:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:agreed, 6 percent disagreed, and 5 percent strongly disagreed. 
26:598:42525:28:27:89:516:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Despite high overall levels of satisfaction, some areas of contention were 
26:599:42600:27:28:89:501:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:revealed in the 2003 survey.  One set of comments focused on the loss of on-
26:600:42676:28:28:89:499:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:campus amenities, including a private office, access to parking, and ability to 
26:601:42756:28:27:90:524:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:teach summer school.  Others reflected a desire to continue in phased retirement 
26:602:42837:27:28:90:521:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:over a longer time period (usually five years instead of three).  Issues concerning 
26:603:42921:28:27:89:499:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:health care coverage (including a plan that enabled employees to use pretax 
26:604:42997:27:28:89:509:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:income to pay for healthcare) were raised by about 10 percent of the sample.   
26:605:43076:28:28:89:514:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Lastly, a few individuals seemed to have problems adjusting to a world in which 
26:606:43156:28:27:89:512:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:they were no longer full-time faculty, as reflected by comments such as “It's the 
26:607:43238:27:28:89:467:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:same thing as committing suicide” and “You will be taken advantage of 
26:608:43308:28:27:89:243:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:constantly and consistently.” 
26:609:43338:27:28:89:499:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Faculty currently working in the UNC system that are age 50 or above 
26:610:43407:28:28:89:518:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:have a strong interest in pursuing phased retirement in the future.  In a separate 
26:611:43490:28:27:89:495:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:survey conducted in fall 2003, 36 percent of those responding said that they 
26:612:43567:27:0:89:511:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:planned to enter phased retirement.  This matches almost exactly with the ratio 
27:613:43649:0:27:90:514:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of retiring faculty who entered phased retirement (as opposed to full retirement) 
27:614:43731:27:28:90:202:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:so far in the 2000s.   
27:615:43754:28:27:90:217:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:Managerial perspective 
27:616:43777:27:28:90:493:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: The most basic question for top management in academe is whether 
27:617:43842:28:28:90:509:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:phased retirement makes faculty leave earlier or stay longer.   Table 3 showed 
27:618:43921:28:27:90:478:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:an increase in the rate at which faculty left full-time employment after the 
27:619:43998:27:28:90:507:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:introduction of phased retirement.  With 2.8 percent of faculty entering phased 
27:620:44078:28:27:90:503:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement and a decline in the full retirement rate of 0.8 percent in the 1990s, 
27:621:44160:27:28:90:506:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:one might reasonably infer that most of the people entering phased retirement 
27:622:44238:28:28:90:523:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:would have continued working if the option had not been available.  Ghent, Allen, 
27:623:44320:28:27:90:512:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and Clark (2001) examined this issue more rigorously using a probit analysis of 
27:624:44400:27:28:90:502:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:data for the two years before and after the introduction of phased retirement.  
27:625:44480:28:27:90:503:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:They rejected the hypothesis that there was a stable model that could explain 
27:626:44558:27:28:90:467:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:both forms of retirement over this four-year period.  In other words, the 
27:627:44632:28:28:90:498:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:characteristics that predict entry into full retirement in 1995-97 do not predict 
27:628:44714:28:27:90:518:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:entry into full and phased retirement in 1997-99.  Ghent et al could not reject the 
27:629:44798:27:28:90:522:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:hypothesis that there was a stable model of full retirement over the same period.  
27:630:44881:28:27:90:512:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Equivalently, the characteristics that predict entry into full retirement in 1995-97 
27:631:44966:27:28:90:519:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:predict entry into full retirement equally well in 1997-99.  These results imply that 
27:632:45052:28:28:90:478:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:phased retirees more closely resemble full-time workers than fully retired 
27:633:45127:28:27:90:159:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:individuals.   
27:634:45142:27:28:90:521:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: With the 2003 survey of phased retirees, a more straightforward approach 
27:635:45215:28:0:90:518:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:can be employed – simply ask the phased retirees what they would have done if 
28:636:45295:0:27:90:502:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the plan had not been available.  When asked if they had not chosen to enter 
28:637:45372:27:28:89:519:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:phased retirement, the overwhelming majority (84 percent) said they would have 
28:638:45451:28:27:89:496:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:continued to work full-time.  Phased retirees say they would have worked an 
28:639:45527:27:28:89:518:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:average of 3.6 more years if the program had not been available.  On campuses 
28:640:45605:28:28:90:520:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:where the phased retirement contract lasts three years, phased retirees say they 
28:641:45686:28:27:90:500:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:would have worked full-time for 3.5 more years, versus 4.2 more years of full-
28:642:45764:27:28:90:492:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:time work on campuses where phased retirement contracts are five years.   
28:643:45838:28:27:90:505:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: One further consideration from a management standpoint is that not all 
28:644:45909:27:28:90:487:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:phased retirees work part-time for the maximum time allowed.  In the 2003 
28:645:45983:28:28:90:518:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:survey, 11 percent say they intend to fully retire before the end of their contract.  
28:646:46069:28:27:89:512:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Data on the actual duration of phased retirements are not available at this time. 
28:647:46151:27:28:125:508:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Looking across all the evidence assembled, it is quite clear that phased 
28:648:46224:28:27:89:506:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement leads faculty to cut back on their workload well before the time they 
28:649:46305:27:28:89:522:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:would have fully retired.  To determine whether this is beneficial to the university, 
28:650:46391:28:28:89:492:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:one must consider how this decreased contribution by senior faculty affects 
28:651:46467:28:27:89:212:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:productivity and cost.   
28:652:46492:27:28:125:472:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Allen, Clark, and Ghent (2003) explored the productivity issue by 
28:653:46558:28:27:89:520:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:examining how two different measures of productivity were related to the relative 
28:654:46640:27:28:89:518:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:odds of full retirement, phased retirement and continued full-time work.  The first 
28:655:46724:28:28:89:516:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:measure is the average pay increase received in the three previous years.  This 
28:656:46804:28:27:89:499:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is the most logical proxy measure for performance in the late 1990s because 
28:657:46880:27:28:89:498:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:faculty pay raises were based entirely on merit during that period.  The other 
28:658:46959:28:0:89:519:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:measure is academic rank.  Among tenured faculty in a relatively senior age and 
29:659:47041:0:27:90:493:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:tenure bracket, full professors have been judged by their peers, department 
29:660:47117:27:28:90:509:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:heads, and deans as more productive than associate or assistant professors.   
29:661:47195:28:27:126:496:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The introduction of phased retirement increased the rate at which low 
29:662:47265:27:28:90:481:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:performing faculty separated from the university.  Consider two otherwise 
29:663:47339:28:28:90:522:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:identical professors, one who received an average pay raise of eight percent and 
29:664:47420:28:27:90:486:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:one who received an average pay raise of zero (the mean pay raise was 4 
29:665:47492:27:28:90:502:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percent with a standard deviation of 4 percent, so this is not an unreasonable 
29:666:47571:28:27:90:513:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:spread in the last half of the 1990s).  Before phased retirement was introduced, 
29:667:47652:27:28:89:506:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:there was a 6.0 percent chance that a professor receiving eight percent raises 
29:668:47731:28:28:90:508:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:would retire.  After the launch of phased retirement, the odds changed to a 5.9 
29:669:47811:28:27:90:520:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percent chance of full retirement and a 1.7 percent chance of phased retirement, 
29:670:47892:27:28:89:512:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for a combined increase in retirement odds of 1.6 percent.  Compare this to the 
29:671:47972:28:27:89:522:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:case of a professor receiving no raises.  Before phased retirement was available, 
29:672:48054:27:28:89:477:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:this professor had a 12.0 percent chance of full retirement.  After phased 
29:673:48129:28:28:89:498:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement the full retirement odds increased to 10.3 percent and the phased 
29:674:48206:28:27:89:512:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement odds were 4.3 percent, an overall retirement rate of 14.6 percent, an 
29:675:48287:27:28:89:519:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:increase of 2.6 percent.  Retirement probabilities went up for both, but they went 
29:676:48370:28:27:89:509:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:up more for the least productive professors.  There was a similar pattern in the 
29:677:48451:27:28:89:469:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:change of retirement odds for full, associate and assistant professors.   
29:678:48525:28:28:125:501:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The response of faculty to the introduction of phased retirement varied 
29:679:48597:28:27:89:515:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with the mission of the institution.  Phased retirement generated a much greater 
29:680:48678:27:28:89:489:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:response on campuses where the main mission is teaching than where the 
29:681:48749:28:0:89:524:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:mission also included research.  Allen, Clark, and Ghent (2003) found, controlling 
30:682:48834:0:27:90:511:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for other factors, a phased retirement rate of 1.6 percent on the two Research I 
30:683:48915:27:28:90:480:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:campuses.  This is much higher than the rates elsewhere: 4.0 percent on 
30:684:48987:28:27:90:485:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:doctoral campuses, 3.9 percent on masters campuses and 3.2 percent on 
30:685:49057:27:28:90:498:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:baccalaureate campuses.  This likely reflects the fact that phased retirement 
30:686:49135:28:28:90:524:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:provides a greater increase in free time on campuses with heavy teaching loads.  
30:687:49216:28:27:90:510:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Full retirement rates also are lower in research-oriented than teaching-oriented 
30:688:49297:27:28:89:501:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:campuses, possibly reflecting the greater concentration of PhDs who need to 
30:689:49373:28:27:89:475:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:work additional years to fully leverage their investment in human capital. 
30:690:49448:27:28:125:516:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:What impact does phased retirement have on an academic department?  
30:691:49516:28:28:89:517:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:So far the analysis points to earlier exits of faculty who are past their prime.  But 
30:692:49602:28:27:89:517:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:at the micro level of an academic school, college, or department, the full answer 
30:693:49684:27:28:89:513:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:depends upon how many faculty elect to enter phased retirement, how much of 
30:694:49760:28:27:89:501:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:their salary line gets returned to the unit, and how difficult these faculty are to 
30:695:49844:27:28:89:524:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:replace.  With only two to three percent of eligible faculty electing to enter phased 
30:696:49930:28:28:89:497:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement in any year, most units are likely to have no more than one or two 
30:697:50008:28:27:89:519:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:persons on phased retirement at any point in time.  When only one person in the 
30:698:50088:27:28:89:482:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:unit enters phased retirement, the savings of half a salary generally is not 
30:699:50165:28:27:89:501:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:enough to fund a new position -- and of course there is no guarantee that the 
30:700:50243:27:28:89:507:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:salary savings will be returned to the unit.  Looking across a school or college, 
30:701:50325:28:28:89:517:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:deans have the opportunity to fund new hires in some departments, creating the 
30:702:50404:28:27:89:291:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:opportunity for growth and renewal.    
30:703:50443:27:28:125:519:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Even when funds are returned to the department, close substitutes for the 
30:704:50517:28:0:89:496:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:services provided by tenured faculty are not always readily available.  Some 
31:705:50596:0:27:90:515:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:campuses are located far away from metropolitan areas and have relatively few 
31:706:50674:27:28:90:475:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:options for adjunct or part-time faculty.  Substitutes are more likely to be 
31:707:50751:28:27:90:511:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:available for faculty teaching courses taken by freshmen and sophomores than 
31:708:50828:27:28:90:519:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for courses taken by upperclassmen and graduate students.  Adjunct faculty can 
31:709:50907:28:28:90:502:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:help on the teaching dimension, but are unlikely to contribute to research and 
31:710:50986:28:27:90:477:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:departmental service.  The faculty survey indicated that time allocated to 
31:711:51061:27:28:90:488:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:research declined by half.  Time allocated to departmental service was not 
31:712:51136:28:27:90:518:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:directly addressed in the faculty survey, but it is difficult to imagine that faculty in 
31:713:51225:27:28:90:501:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:phased retirement would play as active a role as when they were working full-
31:714:51302:28:28:90:506:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:time.  Presuming the service workload stays the same for the department, this 
31:715:51380:28:27:90:294:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:means more work for everyone else.   
31:716:51417:27:28:126:507:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:To address these issues, the Office of the President of the University of 
31:717:51491:28:27:90:525:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:North Carolina system conducted a survey of deans and department heads in the 
31:718:51569:27:28:90:501:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:1999-2000 academic year to learn about the impact of the phased retirement 
31:719:51644:28:28:90:487:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:plan on each campus.  The number of responses relative to the number of 
31:720:51716:28:27:90:519:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:colleges and departments varied significantly across each campus, ranging from 
31:721:51795:27:28:89:485:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:two at UNC-Charlotte to 42 at East Carolina University.  At the two largest 
31:722:51871:28:27:89:504:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:campuses (which have the most academic programs and departments), there 
31:723:51943:27:28:89:503:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:were only ten responses at UNC-Chapel Hill and 38 at NC State.  Because of 
31:724:52018:28:28:89:522:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:this variation in responses across campuses, the survey results do a better job of 
31:725:52101:28:27:89:339:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:highlighting issues than of measuring impact.   
31:726:52149:27:28:125:523:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:A total of 231 departments and colleges responded to the survey, of which 
31:727:52223:28:0:89:498:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:107 departments or colleges reported that faculty from their unit had entered 
32:728:52303:0:27:90:466:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:phased retirement.  Across all campuses, 57 percent of the deans and 
32:729:52372:27:28:90:498:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:department heads who had phased retirees reported that some of the salary 
32:730:52446:28:27:90:517:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:savings were made available to their unit.  This percentage varied widely across 
32:731:52527:27:28:90:503:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:campuses, ranging between 21 and 100 percent.  In units which lost a faculty 
32:732:52604:28:28:90:512:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:member and failed to gain any resources, the department head or dean tended 
32:733:52680:28:27:90:520:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to have an unfavorable view of phased retirement.  The issue that came up most 
32:734:52759:27:28:90:481:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:frequently (mentioned on 26 responses) was the loss of resources for the 
32:735:52832:28:27:90:521:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:collective work of the department, especially service on committees and advising 
32:736:52913:27:28:90:494:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:graduate students.  Changes in teaching assignments, larger classes, class 
32:737:52988:28:28:90:511:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cancellations, and greater use of non-tenure track faculty were also cited in the 
32:738:53070:28:27:90:524:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:responses.  The allocation of office space was another contentious issue (cited in 
32:739:53153:27:28:90:460:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:35 responses), as anyone in academic administration would expect.   
32:740:53221:28:27:126:520:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Improved personnel planning is a major goal of the UNC system’s phased 
32:741:53292:27:28:90:524:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement plan.  When the survey asked the department heads and deans if “you 
32:742:53371:28:28:90:508:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:believe PRP provides an additional management tool for planning,” 59 percent 
32:743:53448:28:27:90:488:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:responded affirmatively.  Although this is quite close to the 57 percent who 
32:744:53525:27:28:90:467:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:received released salary funds, there was no direct relationship across 
32:745:53597:28:27:90:500:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:campuses between the answers to this question and to the odds of receiving 
32:746:53672:27:28:90:519:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:salary release funding.  Some department heads gave open-ended explanations 
32:747:53748:28:28:90:521:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for their response.  Most of the comments were favorable and tended to note two 
32:748:53828:28:27:90:504:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:key benefits from phased retirement: (1) it provides the department with more 
32:749:53906:27:28:90:507:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:time to develop a hiring strategy (cited 41 times) and (2) released salary funds 
32:750:53987:28:0:90:521:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:give the department head more degrees of freedom to meet staffing needs (cited 
33:751:54068:0:27:90:464:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:19 times).  In nine cases, the respondents said that phased retirement 
33:752:54139:27:28:90:481:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:encourages earlier retirement of less productive faculty.  The unfavorable 
33:753:54214:28:27:90:482:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:comment that came up most frequently was that phased retirement made

33:759:54546:27:28:126:525:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:This paper has examined the value created by phased retirement plans for 
33:760:54619:28:28:90:507:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:both faculty members and the university that employs them.  From the point of 
33:761:54697:28:27:90:517:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:view of faculty, there are two payoffs from having access to a phased retirement 
33:762:54778:27:28:90:498:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:program: (1) greater opportunities for part-time work on campus, including in 
33:763:54856:28:27:90:524:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:many cases the capacity to earn more income while working fewer hours, and (2) 
33:764:54935:27:28:90:485:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the ability to make the transition to a new stage of life more gradually than 
33:765:55013:28:28:90:507:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:permitted by the tenure system.  Over the period of this study, phased retirees 
33:766:55093:28:27:90:519:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:accounted for between 25 and 35 percent of all retirements, indicating that many 
33:767:55174:27:28:90:484:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:faculty appreciate having more degrees of freedom in transitioning toward 
33:768:55248:28:27:90:502:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement.  In the UNC system, the take-up rates for phased retirement were 
33:769:55325:27:28:90:515:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:significantly higher on campuses with the heaviest teaching loads, reflecting the 
33:770:55407:28:28:90:455:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:fact that phased retirement buys more free time in those situations.   
33:771:55478:28:27:126:517:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:From the perspective of the university, the biggest payoff from adopting a 
33:772:55553:27:28:90:522:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:phased retirement plan is the increased odds that low performing faculty will start 
33:773:55637:28:0:89:482:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the retirement process earlier.  The precise payoff depends on how these 
34:774:55712:0:27:90:504:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:individuals are replaced, but there is the opportunity for both cost savings and 
34:775:55793:27:28:90:516:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:intellectual renewal.  Cost savings arise from either pocketing the salary release 
34:776:55876:28:27:90:475:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:or from replacing senior faculty with junior faculty or adjuncts.  Given the 
34:777:55953:27:28:90:470:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:conditions of excess supply prevailing in most academic labor markets, 
34:778:56024:28:28:90:523:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:particularly among junior faculty, universities should expect to eventually fill these 
34:779:56111:28:27:90:319:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:positions with highly capable new faculty.   
34:780:56156:27:28:126:521:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:According to a survey of deans and department heads, phased retirement 
34:781:56227:28:27:90:517:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is a useful tool for planning and management.  Universities that have introduced 
34:782:56308:27:28:90:508:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:phased retirement have carefully assessed the fit between this new policy and 
34:783:56386:28:28:90:476:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:their current situation.  Schools are much more likely to launch a phased 
34:784:56460:28:27:90:507:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement plan if they have a high percentage of tenured faculty, implying that 
34:785:56541:27:28:90:482:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the value of an additional management tool is greater in such a situation.  
34:786:56617:28:27:90:482:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Campuses with defined contribution plans are more likely to have phased 
34:787:56689:27:28:90:513:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement plans than those with defined benefit plans, which is what one would 
34:788:56769:28:28:90:521:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:expect given the difficulties that come up with phased retirement under a defined 
34:789:56851:28:27:90:503:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:benefit plan.  However, in the case study of the UNC system, employees who 
34:790:56926:27:28:90:518:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:had chosen to be covered by the defined benefit pension plan had much greater 
34:791:57004:28:27:90:487:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:odds of entering phased retirement than those who had selected a defined 
34:792:57077:27:28:90:522:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:benefit plan.  Campuses with defined benefit plans would thus do well to develop 
34:793:57158:28:28:90:502:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:some way to overcome the built-in conflicts between benefit formulas and the 
34:794:57235:28:27:90:513:156:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:incentives for entering phased retirement, perhaps following the example of the 
34:795:57315:27:0:90:507:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:UNC system.  The main challenges associated with the introduction of phased 
35:796:57393:0:27:90:511:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement have been at the college or departmental level where administrators 
35:797:57472:27:28:89:517:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:must scramble to find substitutes until the phased retiree becomes fully retired.   
35:798:57556:28:27:126:492:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:This study has shown that a phased retirement program encourages 
35:799:57621:27:28:90:515:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:faculty to start the transition to full retirement earlier than they would have in the 
35:800:57708:28:28:90:503:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:absence of such a program.  More years of data from the UNC system will be 
35:801:57783:28:27:90:522:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:needed to assess whether phased retirees end up entering full retirement sooner 
35:802:57863:27:28:90:504:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:or later than they would have otherwise.  The survey data of faculty in phased 
35:803:57942:28:27:90:506:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement suggest that they enter full retirement earlier, but the answer to this 
35:804:58025:27:28:89:512:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:question can be more rigorously ascertained with data on employment patterns 
35:805:58102:28:28:89:509:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:before and after the introduction of phased retirement, including whether those 
35:806:58182:28:27:89:444:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:entering phased retirement stay for the maximum time permitted.   
35:807:58248:27:28:125:521:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:It would be helpful to learn how phased retirement rates vary by academic 
35:808:58322:28:27:89:484:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:discipline.  Accelerated exit rates from academe can be better tolerated in 
35:809:58398:27:28:89:512:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:disciplines with an excess supply of faculty than in those where new faculty are 
35:810:58479:28:28:89:510:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:relatively scarce.  The organizational structure of the various universities in the 
35:811:58563:28:27:89:513:294:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:UNC system varied so much that it was impossible to explore this issue over all 
35:812:58643:27:28:89:519:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:15 campuses, but it would be feasible to conduct within-campus studies at some 
35:813:58722:28:0:89:228:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of the largest universities.
