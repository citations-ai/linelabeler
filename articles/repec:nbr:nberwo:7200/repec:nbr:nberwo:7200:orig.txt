2:26:1209:22:20:108:539:555:16:Times:16:Times:The Social Security earnings test reduces benefits at a 33-50% rate once
2:27:1270:20:20:72:540:535:16:Times:16:Times:earnings pass a threshold amount - among the highest marginal tax rates in the
2:28:1335:20:20:72:538:515:16:Times:16:Times:economy.  Previous research dismissed the importance of the earnings test but
2:29:1412:20:21:72:540:495:16:Times:16:Times:failed to take advantage of three changes in the earnings test rules in order to
2:30:1485:21:20:72:537:474:16:Times:16:Times:identify its impact.   Each change applied to some age groups and not others -
2:31:1561:20:20:72:539:454:16:Times:16:Times:which make them useful for identifying the effect of tax rules on the labor
2:32:1623:20:20:72:540:434:16:Times:16:Times:supply of working beneficiaries.    Beneficiaries  in  the  Current  Population
2:33:1699:20:21:72:540:414:16:Times:16:Times:Survey satisfy the strongest prediction:  many keep their earnings just below
2:34:1774:21:21:72:541:393:16:Times:16:Times:the exempt amount, and this bunching shifts with the earnings  test  rule
2:35:1838:21:20:72:539:372:16:Times:16:Times:changes.  The rule changes are then incorporated into an econometric model
2:36:1910:20:20:72:539:352:16:Times:16:Times:of labor supply to identify income and substitution elasticities.  The resulting
2:37:1982:20:20:72:540:332:16:Times:16:Times:elasticity estimates suggest considerable deadweight loss suffered by working
2:38:2051:20:21:72:540:312:16:Times:16:Times:beneficiaries.  Simulations predict a substantial boost to labor supply from
2:39:2127:21:20:72:538:291:16:Times:16:Times:eliminating the earnings test, and at a minimal fiscal cost.  However, a slight
2:40:2205:20:20:72:540:271:16:Times:16:Times:decrease in labor supply is predicted from the recently legislated increase in
2:41:2280:20:44:72:194:251:16:Times:16:Times:the exempt amount.

4:74:4465:15:23:108:497:678:12:Times:12:Times:The Social Security earnings test generates some of the highest marginal tax rates in the
4:75:4554:23:22:72:521:655:12:Times:12:Times:economy today.  The earnings test reduces someone’s Social Security benefits once earnings pass a
4:76:4651:22:23:72:540:633:12:Times:12:Times:threshold amount.  When the earnings test was introduced in 1939, the intent was to push older workers
4:77:4753:23:22:72:529:610:12:Times:12:Times:out of the labor force, so beneficiaries lost an entire month's benefits when monthly earnings exceeded
4:78:4856:22:23:72:536:588:12:Times:12:Times:$15.  Since the 1950s, the earnings test has been gradually relaxed as the emphasis has shifted towards
4:79:4959:23:22:72:509:565:12:Times:12:Times:encouraging work and saving.  In 1998, the earnings test took away $1 in benefits for every $2 in
4:80:5056:22:23:72:540:543:12:Times:12:Times:earnings above $9,120 for a beneficiary under the age of 65 – a 50% tax on wages.  A beneficiary aged
4:81:5157:23:22:72:394:520:12:Times:12:Times:65-69 with earnings above $14,500 faced a 33% earnings test tax rate.
4:82:5226:22:23:108:524:498:12:Times:12:Times:Altogether, a 64-year old beneficiary in 1995 faced a combined marginal tax rate of 83% on
4:83:5316:23:22:72:506:475:12:Times:12:Times:average, and possibly up to 114%, for earnings above the exempt amount.1  In consequence, the
4:84:5409:22:23:72:539:453:12:Times:12:Times:earnings test receives substantial popular attention, typified by the title of the 1989 study Paying People
4:85:5516:23:22:72:519:430:12:Times:12:Times:Not to Work (Robbins and Robbins).  The 1999 Economic Report of the President reviewed the
4:86:5606:22:23:72:509:408:12:Times:12:Times:impact of the earnings test.2  Concern over distortions to labor supply led to a 1996 law gradually
4:87:5705:23:22:72:534:385:12:Times:12:Times:raising the earnings exempt amount for older beneficiaries to $30,000 by 2002.  On the other hand, the
4:88:5807:22:23:72:531:363:12:Times:12:Times:earnings test will grow more restrictive for some beneficiaries beginning in 2000, as the tighter rules for
4:89:5914:23:22:72:473:340:12:Times:12:Times:62-64 year olds are extended while the normal retirement age slowly rises from 65 to 67.
4:90:6002:22:23:108:540:318:12:Times:12:Times:In spite of substantial popular attention to the earnings test, the existing literature concludes it has
4:91:6106:23:22:72:527:295:12:Times:12:Times:a small impact on the labor supply of the elderly.3  Earlier papers used the Retirement History Survey,
4:92:6209:22:23:72:530:273:12:Times:12:Times:which ended in 1979 and has become dated.  More importantly, there were virtually no changes in the
4:93:6308:23:22:72:510:250:12:Times:12:Times:earnings test during the time period covered by the Retirement History Survey, so estimates of the
4:94:6406:22:23:72:517:228:12:Times:12:Times:earnings test's effect are identified primarily from potentially endogenous cross-sectional variation in
4:95:6510:23:55:72:206:205:12:Times:12:Times:wages and non-labor income.

5:101:6903:0:23:108:524:708:12:Times:12:Times:In this paper I investigate three changes in the earnings test rules instituted between 1978 and
5:102:6999:23:22:72:531:685:12:Times:12:Times:1990.  These changes, which remain mostly unexplored, involved different combinations of shifts in the
5:103:7101:22:23:72:538:663:12:Times:12:Times:earnings test tax rate and the earnings exempt amount.  Also, each applied to beneficiaries of some ages
5:104:7205:23:22:72:521:640:12:Times:12:Times:and not others, so the behavior of unaffected age groups can be used to control for other changes in
5:105:7305:22:23:72:130:618:12:Times:12:Times:labor supply.
5:106:7318:23:22:108:516:595:12:Times:12:Times:This sets the stage for a "natural experiment" analysis of the earnings test of the sort used to
5:107:7414:22:23:72:512:573:12:Times:12:Times:study many social programs and tax changes.4  In this vein, I find that the working elderly bunch in
5:108:7514:23:22:72:531:550:12:Times:12:Times:substantial numbers at and just below the earnings exempt amount.  The bunching reacts directly to the
5:109:7616:22:23:72:513:528:12:Times:12:Times:changes in the earnings test rules.  The evidence of bunching casts doubt on earlier findings that the
5:110:7718:23:22:72:525:505:12:Times:12:Times:earnings test has little impact on behavior and contrasts with other circumstances where people fail to
5:111:7821:22:23:72:516:483:12:Times:12:Times:bunch as predicted at smaller convex kinks in the budget constraint.5  The bunching at the kink also
5:112:7921:23:22:72:409:460:12:Times:12:Times:demonstrates that econometric analysis needs to allow for these responses.
5:113:7995:22:23:108:523:438:12:Times:12:Times:This paper extends the natural experiment approach by exploiting the changes in the earnings
5:114:8087:23:22:72:531:415:12:Times:12:Times:test rules to estimate labor supply elasticities.  The estimation incorporates the reactions to the earnings
5:115:8195:22:23:72:537:393:12:Times:12:Times:test along the entire piecewise linear budget constraint and decomposes those reactions into income and
5:116:8298:23:22:72:509:370:12:Times:12:Times:substitution elasticities.  This type of estimation is typically faulted for imposing assumptions on the
5:117:8402:22:23:72:513:348:12:Times:12:Times:specification that drive the estimates and for overlooking identification.  However, the earnings test
5:118:8504:23:22:72:537:325:12:Times:12:Times:budget constraint is well-defined and easy to measure, avoiding the pitfalls that sometimes arise with this
5:119:8611:22:23:72:531:303:12:Times:12:Times:estimation method.  And, to get the most out of the changes in the earnings test, I combine data before
5:120:8714:23:22:72:494:280:12:Times:12:Times:and after the major rule changes.  The substantial variation in the budget constraint both cross-
5:121:8811:22:23:72:487:258:12:Times:12:Times:sectionally and over time drives the resulting econometric estimates, as will be demonstrated.
5:122:8905:23:22:108:522:235:12:Times:12:Times:The estimation yields relatively large income and substitution elasticities that imply substantial
5:123:9003:22:23:72:532:213:12:Times:12:Times:deadweight loss from the earnings test.  Eliminating the earnings test is predicted to raise average hours
5:124:9109:23:22:72:520:190:12:Times:12:Times:worked by 5.3% for those currently at or above the exempt amount.  In contrast, the increase in the
5:125:9208:22:23:72:507:168:12:Times:12:Times:exempt amount to $30,000 is predicted to lower aggregate hours slightly because of the negative
5:126:9303:23:31:72:523:145:12:Times:12:Times:substitution and income effects imposed on high earners.  It is important to note that the fiscal cost of
5:127:9408:31:9:72:216:114:12:Times:12:Times:                                                
5:128:9456:9:12:72:328:105:6:Times:10:Times:4  These methods and their applications are described in Meyer (1995).

6:130:9561:0:23:72:515:708:12:Times:12:Times:easing the earnings test over the medium term is small and declining, because of the rules governing
6:131:9661:23:22:72:530:685:12:Times:12:Times:future benefits.  These rules ultimately erase most of the fiscal gains from the earnings test, but they are
6:132:9769:22:23:72:386:663:12:Times:12:Times:complicated and do not appear to reduce the labor supply distortions.
6:133:9838:23:22:108:513:640:12:Times:12:Times:The elasticities estimated here are also of broader interest in understanding the elderly who
6:134:9931:22:23:72:529:618:12:Times:12:Times:continue to work, in contrast to the general focus in the literature on retirement.  It will be important to
6:135:10039:23:22:72:532:595:12:Times:12:Times:keep in mind this apparent sensitivity of older workers to tax and transfer rules conditional on working,
6:136:10144:22:23:72:517:573:12:Times:12:Times:which will affect policies that aim to induce later retirement.  The results suggest a potentially severe
6:137:10249:23:22:72:509:550:12:Times:12:Times:negative effect on labor supply if benefits are means tested – a proposal gaining attention recently.
6:138:10350:22:23:72:500:528:12:Times:12:Times:Another important consideration involves 62-64 year olds.  They continue to face a much more
6:139:10442:23:22:72:513:505:12:Times:12:Times:restrictive earnings test, unchanged since the mid-1970s, which will gradually be extended to older
6:140:10541:22:23:72:497:483:12:Times:12:Times:beneficiaries as the normal retirement age begins to rise from 65 to 67 in 2000.  As the median
6:141:10636:23:22:72:538:460:12:Times:12:Times:retirement age continues to drop – from 65 in the 1970s to 62 today – the earnings test is growing more
6:142:10739:22:23:72:253:438:12:Times:12:Times:binding for the younger group over time.
6:143:10779:23:22:108:512:415:12:Times:12:Times:The rest of this paper is divided into five sections.  Section I describes the earnings test, its
6:144:10876:22:23:72:534:393:12:Times:12:Times:impact on beneficiaries, and the earlier literature.  The actual response of workers to the earnings test is
6:145:10984:23:22:72:541:370:12:Times:12:Times:demonstrated in Section II.  Section III incorporates the piecewise linear budget constraint generated by
6:146:11089:22:23:72:497:348:12:Times:12:Times:the earnings test into an econometric model of labor supply.  Section IV describes the resulting
6:147:11185:23:37:72:327:325:12:Times:12:Times:maximum likelihood estimates, and Section V concludes.
6:148:11239:37:23:72:173:288:12:Times:12:Times:I.  BACKGROUND
6:149:11253:23:22:108:525:265:12:Times:12:Times:This section describes how the earnings test works at present and in the past.  It follows with
6:150:11348:22:23:72:529:243:12:Times:12:Times:evidence on the number of beneficiaries affected by the earnings test and then discusses earlier papers
6:151:11451:23:37:72:161:220:12:Times:12:Times:on the earnings test.
6:152:11472:37:23:72:214:183:12:Times:12:Times:A.  The Earnings Test Rules
6:153:11499:23:22:108:518:160:12:Times:12:Times:Once a Social Security beneficiary earns more than a certain amount, his or her benefits are
6:154:11591:22:23:72:525:138:12:Times:12:Times:reduced at a rate proportional to additional earnings.  The benefit reduction rate is equivalent to a tax
6:155:11696:23:0:72:532:115:12:Times:12:Times:applied to wages until benefits are gone.  In 1998 a beneficiary aged 62-64 could earn up to $9,120 –
7:156:11798:0:23:72:516:708:12:Times:12:Times:the earnings exempt amount – with no reduction in benefits.  When he works more, he loses $1 in
7:157:11893:23:22:72:494:685:12:Times:12:Times:benefits for every $2 he earns – a 50% tax rate. For 65-69 year olds, the earnings test is less
7:158:11988:22:23:72:527:663:12:Times:12:Times:restrictive with a higher exempt amount and a 33% tax rate, as reported in Table 1.  The earnings test
7:159:12090:23:22:72:262:640:12:Times:8:Times:no longer applies once a person turns 70.6
7:160:12132:22:23:108:531:618:12:Times:12:Times:As shown in Figure 1, the earnings test generates a piecewise linear budget constraint with one
7:161:12227:23:22:72:503:595:12:Times:12:Times:convex kink corresponding to the exempt amount and one nonconvex kink corresponding to the
7:162:12317:22:23:72:513:573:12:Times:12:Times:exhaustion of benefits.  The point where each segment of the budget constraint intercepts the zero-
7:163:12416:23:22:72:527:550:12:Times:12:Times:hours-of-work axis measures virtual income, which is the analog on that segment to non-labor income
7:164:12515:22:23:72:538:528:12:Times:12:Times:and is due to nonlinear taxation.  When a change in the earnings test shifts the budget constraint, the shift
7:165:12624:23:22:72:499:505:12:Times:12:Times:in the virtual income intercept measures the income effect and the shift in the slope measures the
7:166:12722:22:23:72:157:483:12:Times:8:Times:substitution effect.7
7:167:12743:23:22:108:519:460:12:Times:12:Times:At a convex kink a person faces distinct marginal wages when he considers working slightly
7:168:12833:22:23:72:533:438:12:Times:12:Times:more or less.  Choosing hours just on the kink is compatible with a range of indifference curves.  There
7:169:12937:23:22:72:531:415:12:Times:12:Times:is no other reason for people to mass at a particular point, so observing a cluster at the kink will be the
7:170:13044:22:23:72:328:393:12:Times:8:Times:strongest evidence that people react to the earnings test.8
7:171:13103:23:22:108:526:370:12:Times:12:Times:The earnings test has been altered several times in recent years, as highlighted in Table 1.9  In
7:172:13200:22:23:72:511:348:12:Times:12:Times:1990 the tax rate for 65-69 year olds was reduced from 50% to 33%, which rotates upwards the
7:173:13292:23:22:72:530:325:12:Times:12:Times:middle segment of the budget constraint in Figure 1.  Intuitively, one expects labor supply to rise when
7:174:13396:22:23:72:539:303:12:Times:12:Times:the penalty for working is lowered.  People at the kink do enjoy a higher marginal wage and an incentive
7:175:13500:23:22:72:539:280:12:Times:12:Times:to work more.  However, people on the middle segment already losing benefits become better off when
7:176:13599:22:23:72:535:258:12:Times:12:Times:their income rises and may work more or less.  The income effect grows along the middle segment, and
7:177:13699:23:22:72:523:235:12:Times:12:Times:people just above the nonconvex kink experience a negative substitution effect as well and will lower
7:178:13800:22:23:72:521:213:12:Times:12:Times:their hours.  It is more difficult to search for this range of predicted responses in the raw data than to
7:179:13906:23:8:72:216:190:12:Times:12:Times:                                                
7:180:13954:8:17:72:515:182:6:Times:10:Times:6  Nonlabor income is not subject to the earnings test.  The exempt amount for 62-64 year olds is raised yearly according to
7:181:14078:17:12:72:532:165:10:Times:10:Times:average earnings.  1996 legislation raises the exempt amount for older beneficiaries $1,000 a year through 1999 and to $17,000 in
7:182:14207:12:12:72:536:153:10:Times:10:Times:2000, $25,000 in 2001, and $30,000 in 2002.  The normal retirement age will be raised from age 65 to 67 by two months per year
7:183:14333:12:7:72:227:141:10:Times:10:Times:from 2000 to 2005 and from 2017 to 2022.
7:184:14373:7:12:72:461:134:6:Times:10:Times:7  Figure 1 abstracts from income taxes for simplicity, but taxes are incorporated in the econometric analysis.
7:185:14484:12:17:72:534:122:6:Times:10:Times:8  Another prediction is that people should avoid the nonconvex kink, depending on the convexity of their indifference curves.  It
7:186:14614:17:12:72:534:105:10:Times:10:Times:is difficult to detect in the data because the location of the nonconvex kink differs across people and is unknown for those on the
7:187:14745:12:0:72:128:93:10:Times:10:Times:upper segment.
8:188:14760:0:23:72:499:708:12:Times:12:Times:look for a reaction at the kink, especially lacking longitudinal data.  Thus, understanding how all
8:189:14859:23:22:72:433:685:12:Times:12:Times:beneficiaries react demands a more structured framework for analyzing the data.
8:190:14938:22:23:108:511:663:12:Times:12:Times:The other changes in the earnings test rules also shifted the budget constraint.  In 1983 the
8:191:15031:23:22:72:516:640:12:Times:12:Times:earnings test was eliminated entirely for 70-71 year olds.  This is the most substantial change, and it
8:192:15134:22:23:72:535:618:12:Times:12:Times:creates two natural comparison groups:  younger people who face the same budget constraint as 70-71
8:193:15233:23:22:72:506:595:12:Times:12:Times:year olds before 1983, and older people who face the same budget constraint after.  In 1978 the
8:194:15328:22:23:72:538:573:12:Times:12:Times:exempt amount was raised about 25% for 65-71 year olds.  A comprehensive picture emerges from the
8:195:15425:23:22:72:518:550:12:Times:12:Times:set of rules changes, involving different combinations of shifting the convex kink and the slope of the
8:196:15528:22:23:72:533:528:12:Times:12:Times:budget constraint. And, since each change affected a particular age group, the earnings test response is
8:197:15632:23:22:72:519:505:12:Times:12:Times:further isolated by comparing the change in behavior to the unaffected group as a way to control for
8:198:15732:22:23:72:243:483:12:Times:12:Times:other trends in labor supply over time.
8:199:15771:23:22:108:540:460:12:Times:12:Times:As illustrated, Figure 1 presumes that workers can freely choose their hours on the entire budget
8:200:15868:22:23:72:536:438:12:Times:12:Times:constraint.  Research on prime-age workers, though, shows that hours choices are constrained by fixed
8:201:15969:23:22:72:514:415:12:Times:12:Times:costs, minimum hours requirements, and tied wage-hours contracts.10  The responsiveness of older
8:202:16065:22:23:72:538:393:12:Times:12:Times:workers to the earnings test suggests that they enjoy greater hours flexibility.  Ruhm (1990) documented
8:203:16169:23:22:72:534:370:12:Times:12:Times:the importance of flexible “bridge jobs” taken by many people who continue working after leaving their
8:204:16271:22:23:72:525:348:12:Times:12:Times:career jobs.  Also, older workers are much more likely to work part-time.  44.7% of 65-69 year old
8:205:16369:23:22:72:485:325:12:Times:8:Times:men working in 1990 worked part-time hours, compared to 4.2% of 40-49 year old men.11
8:206:16454:22:23:108:523:303:12:Times:12:Times:It is important to mention another set of rules governing the relationship between the earnings
8:207:16549:23:22:72:531:280:12:Times:12:Times:test and future benefits.  These rules substantially reduce the long-run fiscal gains from the earnings test
8:208:16657:22:23:72:536:258:12:Times:12:Times:and should reduce its impact on labor supply.  Just as people are rewarded with higher future benefits if
8:209:16762:23:22:72:522:235:12:Times:12:Times:they delay claiming, beneficiaries who work are compensated for current benefits lost to the earnings
8:210:16863:22:23:72:533:213:12:Times:12:Times:test.  For beneficiaries aged 62-64 the actuarial adjustment raises future benefits by about 7% for each
8:211:16967:23:22:72:518:190:12:Times:12:Times:year’s worth of benefits forgone.  For beneficiaries aged 65-69 the Delayed Retirement Credit was
8:212:17064:22:30:72:535:168:12:Times:12:Times:introduced in 1973 at 1%, raised in 1982 to 3%, and since 1990 is being raised gradually to 8%.  A 7-
8:213:17165:30:9:72:540:138:12:Times:12:Times:                                                                                                                                                            
8:214:17321:9:12:72:321:129:6:Times:10:Times:9  The history of earnings test changes is detailed in Friedberg (1998).
8:215:17393:12:12:72:408:117:6:Times:10:Times:10  For example, Card (1990), Altonji and Paxson (1988), Cogan (1981), and Hausman (1980).
8:216:17483:12:16:72:511:105:6:Times:10:Times:11  Data on usual hours of work in the previous year from the March 1991 CPS, reported in Friedberg (1999).  Part-time is
8:217:17604:16:0:72:213:89:10:Times:10:Times:defined as less than 35 hours per week.
9:218:17644:0:23:72:523:708:12:Times:12:Times:8% credit is meant to be actuarially fair on average, so someone with average life expectancy and no
9:219:17744:23:22:72:537:685:12:Times:12:Times:borrowing constraints should be indifferent between either receiving benefits today or forgoing them and
9:220:17848:22:23:72:379:663:12:Times:8:Times:later receiving higher benefits over the rest of the expected lifetime.12
9:221:17921:23:22:108:524:640:12:Times:12:Times:However, the credits do not appear to affect behavior and may not be well understood.  The
9:222:18011:22:23:72:536:618:12:Times:12:Times:earnings test's impact is confirmed by the clustering at the convex kink demonstrated in the next section.
9:223:18117:23:22:72:517:595:12:Times:12:Times:Recent articles in Money and the Los Angeles Times describing the earnings test failed to note that
9:224:18216:22:23:72:531:573:12:Times:12:Times:future benefits are raised if current benefits are reduced.13  Similarly, Reimers and Honig (1993, 1996)
9:225:18320:23:22:72:541:550:12:Times:12:Times:found no evidence of increased labor force re-entry when the Delayed Retirement Credit was raised.  In
9:226:18422:22:23:72:529:528:12:Times:12:Times:the estimation described in Sections III and IV I tried allowing the effective earnings test tax rate to be
9:227:18529:23:22:72:534:505:12:Times:12:Times:reduced below the statutory rate by the Delayed Retirement Credit, but no such effect emerged.  In the
9:228:18631:22:23:72:530:483:12:Times:12:Times:rest of this paper I take the view that the credits adjusting future benefits do not influence the response
9:229:18738:23:37:72:159:460:12:Times:12:Times:to the earnings test.
9:230:18759:37:23:72:214:423:12:Times:12:Times:B.  How Many Are Affected
9:231:18784:23:22:108:521:400:12:Times:12:Times:Figure 1 made it clear that the earnings test will change the incentives of people who want to
9:232:18878:22:23:72:536:378:12:Times:12:Times:work a significant amount.  Data from the Social Security Bulletin summarized in Table 2 suggests that
9:233:18980:23:22:72:366:355:12:Times:12:Times:a large fraction of older workers are affected by the earnings test.
9:234:19048:22:23:108:526:333:12:Times:12:Times:About 926,000 out of 9.8 million retired-worker beneficiaries aged 62-69 in 1989 suffered a
9:235:19139:23:22:72:536:310:12:Times:12:Times:reduction in benefits due to the earnings test, according to Bondar (1993).  Leonesio (1990) also noted
9:236:19242:22:23:72:512:288:12:Times:12:Times:the impact of the earnings test on an estimated 173,700 beneficiaries aged 65-69 in the immediate
9:237:19339:23:22:72:537:265:12:Times:12:Times:vicinity of the kink and 582,000 eligibles with earnings who did not claim benefits and should be located
9:238:19444:22:23:72:504:243:12:Times:12:Times:on the upper segment of the budget constraint in Figure 1.  Those and other articles in the Social
9:239:19542:23:22:72:508:220:12:Times:8:Times:Security Bulletin argued that a small percentage of the elderly are affected by the earnings test.14
9:240:19642:22:24:72:506:198:12:Times:12:Times:However, with over one-third of working 65-69 year olds losing benefits to the earnings test and
9:241:19738:24:9:72:216:174:12:Times:12:Times:                                                
9:242:19786:9:16:72:535:165:6:Times:10:Times:12  Burkhauser (1980) and Blinder, Gordon, and Wise (1980) noted this potential impact of the actuarial adjustment, although the
9:243:19914:16:12:72:539:149:10:Times:10:Times:Delayed Retirement Credit is only slowly becoming actuarially fair.  Beneficiaries are compensated for each full month’s worth of
9:244:20043:12:8:72:119:137:10:Times:10:Times:benefits lost.
9:245:20057:8:16:72:535:129:6:Times:10:Times:13  Simon (1996), Kristof (1997).  Coile, et al, (1999) found that many beneficiaries for whom the adjustment is actuarially fair or
9:246:20189:16:12:72:533:113:10:Times:10:Times:better claim benefits early at age 62, more evidence that the credits are not fully taken into account.  Burtless and Moffitt (1985)
9:247:20321:12:8:72:333:101:10:Times:10:Times:did not incorporate the credits, as people do not appear to react to them.
9:248:20395:8:0:72:189:93:6:Times:10:Times:14  Packard (1990), Lingg (1986).
10:249:20429:0:23:72:527:708:12:Times:12:Times:hundreds of thousands more affected as well, it appears that the earnings test could have an important
10:250:20531:23:37:72:113:685:12:Times:8:Times:impact.15
10:251:20540:37:23:72:185:648:12:Times:12:Times:C.  Previous Literature
10:252:20563:23:22:108:532:625:12:Times:12:Times:In spite of the substantial popular attention, the previous literature on the earnings test generally
10:253:20664:22:23:72:524:603:12:Times:12:Times:dismissed its importance. The most thorough papers to date are by Burtless and Moffitt (1985), who
10:254:20762:23:22:72:532:580:12:Times:12:Times:noted the reaction of beneficiaries at the exempt amount, and Gustman and Steinmeier (1986).16  They
10:255:20862:22:23:72:527:558:12:Times:12:Times:incorporated the effect of the earnings test into joint models of retirement and “post-retirement” labor
10:256:20966:23:22:72:518:535:12:Times:12:Times:supply.  The post-retirement hours choice was modeled using the piecewise linear budget constraint
10:257:21064:22:23:72:269:513:12:Times:12:Times:approach, which is described in Section III.
10:258:21108:23:22:108:539:490:12:Times:12:Times:Each paper used the Retirement History Survey, a rich longitudinal survey that lasted from 1969
10:259:21203:22:23:72:529:468:12:Times:12:Times:to 1979, but with a major weakness for studying the earnings test.  During that time beneficiaries of all
10:260:21308:23:22:72:519:445:12:Times:12:Times:ages faced virtually unchanged earnings test parameters.17  What remains to identify the estimates of
10:261:21409:22:23:72:537:423:12:Times:12:Times:post-retirement hours elasticities is other variation in the budget constraint across individuals.  However,
10:262:21517:23:22:72:515:400:12:Times:12:Times:cross-sectional variation due to wages and non-labor income is likely to be correlated with omitted
10:263:21616:22:23:72:536:378:12:Times:12:Times:individual characteristics, biasing the estimates.  Moreover, time series variation in post-retirement labor
10:264:21724:23:22:72:527:355:12:Times:12:Times:supply may be confounded by a strong trend in retirement during those years.18  Krueger and Pischke
10:265:21823:22:23:72:536:333:12:Times:12:Times:(1992) pointed out the potential for spurious correlation, since real Social Security benefits rose sharply
10:266:21930:23:22:72:148:310:12:Times:12:Times:at the same time.
10:267:21947:22:23:108:512:288:12:Times:12:Times:Both papers estimated significant elasticities, but both concluded that the earnings test was
10:268:22040:23:22:72:509:265:12:Times:12:Times:unimportant.  Burtless and Moffitt, like the articles in the Social Security Bulletin, judged that the
10:269:22142:22:33:72:532:243:12:Times:12:Times:percentage affected by the earnings test was minor, although the previous subsection showed that over
10:270:22243:33:9:72:216:210:12:Times:12:Times:                                                
10:271:22291:9:16:72:514:201:6:Times:10:Times:15  These statistics do not account for the possible impact on retirement, arising if there are restrictions on hours choices, as
10:272:22420:16:8:72:459:185:10:Times:10:Times:discussed earlier.  The focus is on the cleanest predictions, relating to hours of work conditional on working.
10:273:22531:8:12:72:432:177:6:Times:10:Times:16  Vroman (1985) also documented the bunching of beneficiaries at the exempt amount in the 1970s.
10:274:22629:12:16:72:532:165:6:Times:10:Times:17  In 1972 a higher earnings test “tax bracket” with a 100% tax rate was eliminated.  However, the 1972 change is less useful for
10:275:22759:16:12:72:513:149:10:Times:10:Times:identifying the reaction to the earnings test.  It applied to beneficiaries of all ages, yielding no natural comparison group, an
10:276:22888:12:12:72:536:137:10:Times:10:Times:important factor with the sharp contemporaneous increase in retirement.  Also, there was no apparent reaction to the higher kink
10:277:23016:12:12:72:527:125:10:Times:10:Times:or to its elimination.  While that bounds the underlying responsiveness to the earnings test, it is still consistent with the strong
10:278:23148:12:12:72:532:113:10:Times:10:Times:reaction to the initial kink demonstrated here.  The propensity to locate at the higher kink is reduced because of its proximity to
10:279:23279:12:8:72:209:101:10:Times:10:Times:the nonconvex kink, which is avoided.
10:280:23316:8:0:72:441:93:6:Times:10:Times:18  The proportion of non-working men aged 64 in the CPS rose from 44.0% in 1969 to 54.1% in 1977.
11:281:23415:0:23:72:496:708:12:Times:12:Times:one-third of working beneficiaries lose benefits to the earnings test.  Gustman and Steinmeier’s
11:282:23511:23:22:72:511:685:12:Times:12:Times:conclusions were influenced by their treatment of the actuarial adjustment and Delayed Retirement
11:283:23608:22:23:72:518:663:12:Times:12:Times:Credit, which should reduce the impact of the earnings test for many beneficiaries.19  However, as I
11:284:23708:23:22:72:520:640:12:Times:12:Times:noted previously, beneficiaries do not appear to be taken into account in the reaction to the earnings
11:285:23810:22:38:72:91:618:12:Times:12:Times:test.
11:286:23815:38:22:72:406:580:12:Times:12:Times:II.  EARNINGS DISTRIBUTIONS AND THE EARNINGS TEST
11:287:23864:22:23:108:514:558:12:Times:12:Times:The conclusion in earlier research, therefore, is that the earnings test has a minor impact on
11:288:23958:23:22:72:530:535:12:Times:12:Times:behavior.  On the other hand, beneficiaries appear to be well informed about the earnings test, and the
11:289:24061:22:23:72:515:513:12:Times:12:Times:popular view is that it deters people from working.20  How can one determine its influence on labor
11:290:24160:23:22:72:524:490:12:Times:12:Times:supply?  Empirical strategies vary in the degree to which they formalize individual behavior:  the more
11:291:24263:22:23:72:533:468:12:Times:12:Times:structured the approach, the more closely the conclusions resemble theoretical concepts of interest; but
11:292:24367:23:22:72:493:445:12:Times:12:Times:also the more the accuracy of the conclusions depends on the formalization itself being a good
11:293:24461:22:23:72:166:423:12:Times:12:Times:description of reality.
11:294:24484:23:22:108:498:400:12:Times:12:Times:In the rest of this paper, I combine two approaches.  In order to focus on the strongest
11:295:24572:22:23:72:493:378:12:Times:12:Times:predictions, this section analyzes raw data on earnings relative to the earnings exempt amount.
11:296:24667:23:22:72:535:355:12:Times:12:Times:Comparing earnings before and after the different rule changes decomposes how people respond to the
11:297:24766:22:23:72:525:333:12:Times:12:Times:exempt amount and to the tax rate.21  Further, comparing these shifts to other unaffected groups over
11:298:24867:23:22:72:521:310:12:Times:12:Times:time controls for aggregate trends which also move the earnings distribution. However, capturing the
11:299:24967:22:23:72:519:288:12:Times:12:Times:responses of people along other parts of the budget set, and quantifying those responses in terms of
11:300:25067:23:22:72:490:265:12:Times:12:Times:income and substitution elasticities, will require a more structured framework.  Section III will
11:301:25164:22:23:72:507:243:12:Times:12:Times:incorporate the entire piecewise linear budget constraint illustrated in Figure 1 in a model of labor
11:302:25265:23:58:72:103:220:12:Times:12:Times:supply.
11:303:25272:58:9:72:216:162:12:Times:12:Times:                                                
11:304:25320:9:12:72:398:153:6:Times:10:Times:19  Simulations involving the earnings test appear in Gustman and Steinmeier (1985, 1991).
11:305:25410:12:16:72:524:141:6:Times:10:Times:20  Leonesio (1990) reported that 73% of retirees under age 72 in the 1982 New Beneficiary Survey knew of the earnings test.
11:306:25534:16:12:72:504:125:10:Times:10:Times:Simon (1996) in Money and Kristof (1997) in The Los Angeles Times are recent examples of articles in the popular press
11:307:25652:12:8:72:172:113:10:Times:10:Times:describing the earnings test.
11:308:25681:8:16:72:537:105:6:Times:10:Times:21  The earnings test affects narrow age ranges, so the response to rule changes generally occurs among new cohorts entering these
11:309:25811:16:0:72:534:89:10:Times:10:Times:age ranges and facing new earnings test rules, rather than among the same people facing new rules and adjusting their work hours.
12:310:25941:0:23:108:539:708:12:Times:12:Times:Figure 2 begins by showing the earnings distribution relative to the exempt amount before and
12:311:26034:23:22:72:511:685:12:Times:12:Times:after the exempt amount was raised for 65-71 year olds in 1978.  Using data from March Current
12:312:26128:22:23:72:530:663:12:Times:12:Times:Population Surveys (CPS), the graphs compare the previous year earnings of 67-69 year old men and
12:313:26225:23:22:72:520:640:12:Times:12:Times:63-64 year old men, who did not experience any change in the exempt amount.  Figure 2-A shows,
12:314:26319:22:23:72:539:618:12:Times:12:Times:before 1978, how many of the older and younger groups had earnings in each $1000 interval above and
12:315:26418:23:22:72:532:595:12:Times:12:Times:below the convex kink defined by the exempt amount, as a proportion of the total number of people in
12:316:26518:22:23:72:154:573:12:Times:8:Times:the age group.22,23
12:317:26537:23:22:108:521:550:12:Times:12:Times:Figure 2-A demonstrates a strong response to the earnings kink.  People in both age groups
12:318:26627:22:23:72:525:528:12:Times:12:Times:bunch just below the kink.  Roughly the same number of people appear in each increment for several
12:319:26725:23:22:72:526:505:12:Times:12:Times:steps below the kink, followed by a big drop – of over 2% of the sample for the 63-64 year olds and
12:320:26824:22:23:72:540:483:12:Times:12:Times:4% for the 67-69 year olds (about 8% of working 67-69 year olds) – in the step from just below to just
12:321:26926:23:22:72:526:460:12:Times:12:Times:above the kink.  The visible reaction to the earnings test is somewhat in contrast to earlier conclusions
12:322:27031:22:23:72:239:438:12:Times:12:Times:that the earnings test has little impact.
12:323:27072:23:22:108:507:415:12:Times:12:Times:After 1978, the cluster of 67-69 year olds moves up to the new kink.  Figure 2-B shows
12:324:27158:22:23:72:533:393:12:Times:12:Times:earnings of both age groups in relation to the unchanged exempt amount of the younger group. The 63-
12:325:27258:23:22:72:516:370:12:Times:12:Times:64 year olds cluster just below it as before, but the earnings of 67-69 year olds have clearly shifted
12:326:27360:22:23:72:380:348:12:Times:12:Times:upwards.  Figure 2-C shows them bunching at their new higher kink.
12:327:27426:23:22:108:532:325:12:Times:12:Times:Quantifying the visual evidence allows conclusions about statistical significance.  The first panel
12:328:27525:22:23:72:526:303:12:Times:12:Times:of Table 3 reports the same data as Figure 2.  Each column reports the proportion of individuals with
12:329:27626:23:22:72:512:280:12:Times:12:Times:earnings within a few intervals around the kink.  The last row computes the difference between the
12:330:27724:22:23:72:538:258:12:Times:12:Times:percentage of people just below and above the kink and demonstrates that the bunching in every case is
12:331:27826:23:22:72:512:235:12:Times:12:Times:both significant and significantly different from the behavior across any other interval.  The first and
12:332:27930:22:23:72:521:213:12:Times:12:Times:fourth columns report the distribution of people in both age groups before 1978.  The other columns
12:333:28029:23:8:72:216:190:12:Times:12:Times:                                                
12:334:28077:8:17:72:527:182:6:Times:10:Times:22  Figures 2-4 show earnings from wages and salaries and from self-employment.  Age groups were narrowed because the CPS
12:335:28198:17:12:72:523:165:10:Times:10:Times:reports age in March following the working year, instead of exact birthdays.  The sample is restricted to men because spousal
12:336:28323:12:12:72:512:153:10:Times:10:Times:benefits are complex.  A spouse chooses whether to receive benefits as a dependent or a retiree, and the benefit type is not
12:337:28447:12:12:72:535:141:10:Times:10:Times:reported in the CPS.  Dependent spouses lose benefits from both the dependent's and the retiree's earnings, while retiree spouses
12:338:28576:12:7:72:233:129:10:Times:10:Times:lose benefits only from the retiree's earnings.
12:339:28623:7:17:72:536:122:6:Times:10:Times:23  While theory predicts a cluster exactly at the kink, measurement error or restrictions in hours choices will plausibly spread out
12:340:28756:17:12:72:502:105:10:Times:10:Times:the cluster in the neighborhood of or just below the kink.  The interval width of $1000 was chosen because respondents
12:341:28874:12:0:72:515:93:10:Times:10:Times:sometimes round off reported earnings to the nearest thousand, so a different interval length confounds the measurement of
13:342:28998:0:23:72:511:708:12:Times:12:Times:compare the patterns of earnings at the new separate kinks and demonstrate that each group now
13:343:29092:23:22:72:538:685:12:Times:12:Times:responds strongly to its own kink.  Together, the visual and statistical evidence confirms that a significant
13:344:29201:22:23:72:425:663:12:Times:12:Times:number of people react to the earnings test by holding down their labor supply.
13:345:29280:23:22:108:538:640:12:Times:12:Times:Figure 3 makes the same comparisons of earnings around the kink before and after 1983, when
13:346:29371:22:23:72:526:618:12:Times:12:Times:the earnings test was eliminated for 70-71 year olds.  Figures 3-A and 3-B illustrate earnings patterns
13:347:29474:23:22:72:534:595:12:Times:12:Times:before 1983.24  Figure 3-A compares the earnings of the affected group to that of a younger group that
13:348:29576:22:23:72:529:573:12:Times:12:Times:faces the earnings test both before and after 1983.  The clustering at the kink by those of both ages is,
13:349:29681:23:22:72:538:550:12:Times:12:Times:again, substantial.  Figure 3-B gives a sense of the counterfactual by comparing the affected group to an
13:350:29786:22:23:72:533:528:12:Times:12:Times:older group of 73-75 year olds who do not face the earnings test and whose earnings decline smoothly
13:351:29886:23:22:72:166:505:12:Times:12:Times:over the same range.
13:352:29906:22:23:108:504:483:12:Times:12:Times:Figures 3-C and 3-D make the same comparisons after 1983.  Now, the earnings of the
13:353:29989:23:22:72:526:460:12:Times:12:Times:affected 71-72 year olds resembles the older group, declining smoothly over the range of the earnings
13:354:30090:22:23:72:499:438:12:Times:12:Times:kink.  The younger group continues to bunch at the kink.  The evidence is quantified in Table 3,
13:355:30186:23:22:72:533:415:12:Times:12:Times:comparing the affected 71-72 year olds (in the middle columns) with the younger and older groups.  In
13:356:30287:22:23:72:533:393:12:Times:12:Times:the first three columns, among those facing the earnings test, the percentage located just below the kink
13:357:30392:23:22:72:521:370:12:Times:12:Times:is large:  4.1% of the younger group before 1983, 2.2% of the younger group after, and 2.3% of the
13:358:30490:22:23:72:533:348:12:Times:12:Times:71-72 year olds before; versus 0.8-1.3% for those with no earnings test, including the 71-72 year olds
13:359:30592:23:22:72:535:325:12:Times:12:Times:after 1983.  In this case, the usefulness of both comparison groups is clear.  Comparing the 71-72 year
13:360:30695:22:23:72:537:303:12:Times:8:Times:olds to the younger group could be ambiguous because the younger group were bunching less as well.25
13:361:30795:23:22:72:529:280:12:Times:12:Times:On the other hand, after 1983 the 71-72 year olds look more like the older group than the younger as
13:362:30895:22:23:72:510:258:12:Times:12:Times:they did before.  The reaction to the 1983 change shows, similarly to 1978, how the kink governs
13:363:30991:23:22:72:155:235:12:Times:12:Times:people's behavior.
13:364:31009:22:23:108:533:213:12:Times:12:Times:The analysis concludes with Figure 4, focusing on the 1990 decline in the tax rate from 50% to
13:365:31103:23:22:72:529:190:12:Times:12:Times:33% for 65-69 year olds.  Figure 4-A shows the earnings of 63-64 and 67-69 year olds before 1990
13:366:31199:22:13:72:540:168:12:Times:12:Times:                                                                                                                                                            
13:367:31355:13:8:72:106:155:10:Times:10:Times:bunching.
13:368:31364:8:16:72:539:147:6:Times:10:Times:24  Figure 3 shows 71-72 year olds, since they were 70-71 when the earnings were earned.  1982 is omitted because the change had
13:369:31492:16:8:72:308:131:10:Times:10:Times:been scheduled for 1982 but was postponed in 1981 by one year.
13:370:31554:8:16:72:512:123:6:Times:10:Times:25  67-69 year olds might bunch less because the Delayed Retirement Credit was raised from 1% to 3% in 1982.  However,
13:371:31672:16:12:72:535:107:10:Times:10:Times:earnings did not rise, and labor force participation declined instead of rising, which is not consistent with a response to the DRC.
13:372:31804:12:0:72:476:95:10:Times:10:Times:Reimers and Honig (1993, 1996) found no evidence of increased labor market re-entry by the affected age group.
14:373:31916:0:23:72:512:708:12:Times:12:Times:and Figure 4-B shows earnings after 1990.  In both, we see the familiar piling up at the kink.  Yet,
14:374:32016:23:22:72:512:685:12:Times:12:Times:comparing the graphs, it is difficult to detect a change in the degree of bunching by the older group
14:375:32117:22:23:72:517:663:12:Times:12:Times:relative to the younger.  Table 3 also shows the lack of a significant reaction.  While this bounds the
14:376:32220:23:22:72:533:640:12:Times:12:Times:underlying responsiveness of labor supply, it does not contradict the evidence of strong reactions to the
14:377:32325:22:23:72:532:618:12:Times:12:Times:other changes.  The 17-percentage point decline in the tax rate is smaller than earlier changes when the
14:378:32429:23:22:72:506:595:12:Times:12:Times:tax rate at the kink went from 50% to zero, and a small aggregate response is predicted from the
14:379:32525:22:23:72:196:573:12:Times:8:Times:elasticities estimated later.26
14:380:32556:23:22:108:531:550:12:Times:12:Times:In sum, the visual and statistical analysis of earnings patterns demonstrates substantial bunching
14:381:32654:22:23:72:538:528:12:Times:12:Times:at the convex kink generated by the earnings test, along with considerable responsiveness to the shifts in
14:382:32760:23:22:72:528:505:12:Times:12:Times:the kink when the earnings test rules change.  The next section will expand the analysis to consider the
14:383:32864:22:38:72:180:483:12:Times:12:Times:entire budget constraint.
14:384:32889:38:22:72:363:445:12:Times:12:Times:III.   PIECEWISE LINEAR BUDGET SET MODELLING
14:385:32932:22:23:108:488:423:12:Times:12:Times:This section describes the econometric model of labor supply that arises out of utility
14:386:33019:23:22:72:530:400:12:Times:12:Times:maximization subject to a kinked budget constraint.  The estimation will capture the bunching, together
14:387:33122:22:23:72:519:378:12:Times:12:Times:with reactions along other parts of the budget constraint which are difficult to detect in the raw data.
14:388:33226:23:22:72:524:355:12:Times:12:Times:This will permit broader conclusions about the earnings test while providing estimates of labor supply
14:389:33328:22:38:72:265:333:12:Times:12:Times:elasticities that are of more general interest.
14:390:33375:38:22:72:156:295:12:Times:12:Times:A.  Methodology
14:391:33390:22:23:108:517:273:12:Times:12:Times:In estimating the determinants of labor supply, the problem of distinguishing the effect of the
14:392:33485:23:22:72:524:250:12:Times:12:Times:budget constraint on labor supply from the effect of preferences on the budget constraint come to the
14:393:33586:22:23:72:532:228:12:Times:12:Times:fore.  Past labor supply may shape the budget constraint through the current wage, Social Security and
14:394:33688:23:22:72:512:205:12:Times:12:Times:other income, and may also be correlated with current labor supply.  The resulting estimates of the
14:395:33787:22:23:72:524:183:12:Times:12:Times:impact of the current wage and non-labor income will be inconsistent.  The substantial variation in the
14:396:33890:23:22:72:520:160:12:Times:12:Times:net wage and virtual income across age groups and over time caused by changes in the earnings test
14:397:33988:22:24:72:307:138:12:Times:12:Times:rules are key for identifying the estimated elasticities.
14:398:34045:24:21:72:540:114:12:Times:12:Times:                                                                                                                                                            
14:399:34201:21:0:72:367:93:6:Times:10:Times:26  Also, the smaller rule change may have been noted less widely by beneficiaries.
15:400:34286:0:23:108:479:708:12:Times:12:Times:Most tax and transfer programs generate nonlinearities in the budget constraint and
15:401:34369:23:22:72:533:685:12:Times:12:Times:discontinuities in labor supply.  Ignoring them mis-specifies labor supply, but using the net instead of the
15:402:34477:22:23:72:539:663:12:Times:12:Times:gross wage as the regressor makes the net wage endogenous because it is correlated with hours through
15:403:34578:23:22:72:514:640:12:Times:12:Times:the nonlinear tax schedule.  Taking  account of taxes in the estimation is not only important but also
15:404:34680:22:23:72:532:618:12:Times:12:Times:useful because policy changes are a source of variation that serve to identify the estimates.  Accounting
15:405:34785:23:22:72:538:595:12:Times:12:Times:fully for the nonlinearities generally demands maximum likelihood techniques, introduced by Burtless and
15:406:34889:22:23:72:507:573:12:Times:12:Times:Hausman (1978) and outlined in Moffitt (1986).27  This involves selecting a labor supply function,
15:407:34987:23:22:72:538:550:12:Times:12:Times:specifying the source of stochastic variation, and forming the likelihood function.  The likelihood function
15:408:35095:22:23:72:538:528:12:Times:12:Times:takes into account the choice of hours over the entire exogenous tax schedule – in this way removing the
15:409:35199:23:22:72:413:505:12:Times:12:Times:endogeneity of jointly choosing hours and a tax rate on a particular segment.
15:410:35276:22:23:108:517:483:12:Times:12:Times:However, the econometric application of the piecewise linear budget constraint method has
15:411:35365:23:22:72:528:460:12:Times:12:Times:been called into question by the work of MaCurdy, Green, and Paarsch (1990).  They, and Pencavel
15:412:35461:22:23:72:527:438:12:Times:12:Times:(1986) earlier, showed that the probability of locating at a convex interior kink is positive, and the log
15:413:35567:23:22:72:527:415:12:Times:12:Times:likelihood is defined, only if the estimated coefficients yield a positive compensated substitution effect.
15:414:35674:22:23:72:529:393:12:Times:12:Times:When this condition was not satisfied, researchers imposed it by constraining the income coefficient to
15:415:35777:23:22:72:495:370:12:Times:12:Times:be negative.  MaCurdy, Green, and Paarsch suggested further that the piecewise linear budget
15:416:35869:22:23:72:523:348:12:Times:12:Times:constraint method automatically imposes a positive compensated effect.  Blomquist (1995) explained
15:417:35967:23:22:72:530:325:12:Times:12:Times:that this conclusion is not warranted.  The compensated effect may be estimated to be positive without
15:418:36069:22:23:72:506:303:12:Times:12:Times:the researcher imposing it, and MaCurdy, Green, and Paarsch obtained estimates with a negative
15:419:36163:23:22:72:502:280:12:Times:12:Times:compensated effect, so it is not automatically imposed.  The real trouble is with the estimate of a
15:420:36262:22:23:72:520:258:12:Times:12:Times:negative compensated effect, which has occurred in many econometric settings.  This outcome casts
15:421:36359:23:22:72:509:235:12:Times:8:Times:doubt on either the theoretical underpinnings or the econometric implementation of the problem.28
15:422:36456:22:23:108:535:213:12:Times:12:Times:The earnings test estimation described in the next section does not encounter such trouble.  The
15:423:36552:23:22:72:509:190:12:Times:12:Times:compensated substitution effect is positive for all observations without imposing restrictions on the
15:424:36653:22:9:72:216:168:12:Times:12:Times:                                                
15:425:36701:9:16:72:534:159:6:Times:10:Times:27  Instrumental variables methods have been employed in some cases, but they do not deal with the kink observations, who face
15:426:36827:16:8:72:258:143:10:Times:10:Times:two different marginal tax rates and virtual incomes.
15:427:36880:8:16:72:535:135:6:Times:10:Times:28  Two papers have focused on functional form.  Blundell, Duncan, and Meghir (1998) excluded observations around the convex
15:428:37004:16:12:72:526:119:10:Times:10:Times:kink and added a selection term to account for it.  That approach is unappealing here because the kink observations provide so
15:429:37130:12:12:72:537:107:10:Times:10:Times:much information.  Blomquist and Newey (1996) estimated a nonparametric labor supply function subject to a parametric budget
15:430:37254:12:0:72:534:95:10:Times:10:Times:constraint.  That approach requires major simplifications to be feasible.  It omits covariates, only incorporates convex kinks, and
16:431:37387:0:23:72:532:708:12:Times:12:Times:coefficients.  The literature on kinked budget constraints suggests that the problems arise in the case of
16:432:37493:23:22:72:514:685:12:Times:12:Times:income taxes.  We do not observe a person’s precise tax schedule, which depends on other family
16:433:37588:22:23:72:530:663:12:Times:12:Times:income, household structure, and unobserved filing status and deductions.29  This is exacerbated when
16:434:37689:23:22:72:517:640:12:Times:12:Times:there are many small kinks, as in the tax code before 1986 and 1981.  In contrast, the earnings test
16:435:37789:22:23:72:519:618:12:Times:12:Times:creates a simple budget constraint with a large kink that has the same location for everyone and that
16:436:37890:23:22:72:503:595:12:Times:12:Times:appears well understood, which explains why we observe much more bunching.  Finally, there is
16:437:37983:22:23:72:424:573:12:Times:12:Times:considerably more variation in elderly labor supply, which aids in identification.
16:438:38065:23:22:108:514:550:12:Times:12:Times:These reasons explain why the earnings test estimation escapes the problems described by
16:439:38153:22:23:72:516:528:12:Times:12:Times:MaCurdy, Green, and Paarsch.  The outcome here suggests the circumstances when the piecewise
16:440:38245:23:37:72:278:505:12:Times:12:Times:linear budget constraint method is most useful.

16:446:38499:30:23:72:485:383:12:Times:12:Times:where w is the gross wage, w(1-τ) is the net wage, YV is virtual income, X are demographic
16:447:38589:23:22:72:517:360:12:Times:12:Times:characteristics that influence labor supply, and α is a random variable which represents unobserved
16:448:38688:22:23:72:201:338:12:Times:12:Times:heterogeneity in preferences.
16:449:38717:23:22:108:509:315:12:Times:12:Times:The net wage and virtual income terms are defined in terms of the piecewise linear budget
16:450:38806:22:23:72:521:293:12:Times:12:Times:constraint generated by the earnings test.  Let E denote the earnings exempt amount and YSS denote
16:451:38904:23:22:72:356:270:12:Times:12:Times:Social Security benefits.  Then τ and YV are defined as follows:
16:452:38968:22:15:72:392:248:12:Times:12:Times:(2)   τ = τ1 ≡ 0 if earnings < E;
16:453:39000:15:23:72:228:233:12:Times:12:Times:       YV = YV1 ≡ non-labor income
16:454:39033:23:15:72:423:210:12:Times:12:Times:       τ = τ2 ≡ τETif E < earnings < E + YSS/τET;
16:455:39080:15:22:72:201:195:12:Times:8:Times:       YV = YV2 ≡ YV1 + E*τ2
16:456:39107:22:15:72:403:173:12:Times:12:Times:       τ = τ3 ≡ 0if E + YSS/τET < earnings.
16:457:39149:15:30:72:194:158:12:Times:8:Times:       YV = YV3 ≡ YV1 - YSS
16:458:39175:30:13:72:540:128:12:Times:12:Times:                                                                                                                                                            
16:459:39331:13:7:72:407:115:10:Times:10:Times:does not account for the participation decision, an important consideration for older workers.
16:460:39425:7:17:72:530:108:6:Times:10:Times:29  Heckman (1983) pointed out that measurement error in the location of the kinks gets incorporated into the log likelihood and
16:461:39553:17:0:72:536:91:10:Times:10:Times:causes inconsistent estimates.  Using Monte Carlo methods, Blomquist (1992) found that imputing income tax deductions causes
17:462:39679:0:23:72:535:708:12:Times:12:Times:The structure in (2) makes apparent the correlation of the net wage and virtual income terms with hours
17:463:39782:23:22:72:512:685:12:Times:12:Times:as hours and earnings increase along the budget constraint.  It is through (2) that the changes in the
17:464:39884:22:23:72:535:663:12:Times:12:Times:earnings test rules will be incorporated.  While there may be concern that α is correlated with the gross
17:465:39989:23:22:72:529:640:12:Times:12:Times:wage and non-labor income, the identifying assumption is that the substantial shifts in the net wage and
17:466:40093:22:23:72:535:618:12:Times:12:Times:virtual income terms generated by the policy changes will dominate the potential endogeneity of α.  The
17:467:40196:23:22:72:514:595:12:Times:12:Times:extent to which the policy variables drive the estimates will be demonstrated after the estimates are
17:468:40297:22:23:72:119:573:12:Times:12:Times:presented.
17:469:40307:23:22:108:527:550:12:Times:12:Times:Assuming α in equation (1) is distributed over the population as N(0,σα2) yields an expanded
17:470:40399:22:23:72:523:528:12:Times:12:Times:tobit.  The log likelihood function in (3) expresses the probability of α occurring such that the person
17:471:40503:23:45:72:328:505:12:Times:12:Times:wishes to locate on the segment or kink where observed:

18:645:41672:0:23:72:518:708:12:Times:12:Times:term for a person at the kink expresses the condition that desired hours are below the kink when he
18:646:41771:23:22:72:506:685:12:Times:12:Times:faces the budget parameters of the middle segment and above the kink when he faces the budget
18:647:41864:22:23:72:353:663:12:Times:8:Times:parameters of the lower segment, neither of which is feasible.30
18:648:41928:23:22:108:493:640:12:Times:12:Times:The last term conditions the hours choice on the decision to work positive hours.  This
18:649:42015:22:23:72:524:618:12:Times:12:Times:specification entails truncating nonworkers from the sample.  Truncating focuses the estimation on the
18:650:42117:23:22:72:529:595:12:Times:12:Times:hours choices of those who work, instead of trying to explain the work decision too, which is far from
18:651:42219:22:23:72:511:573:12:Times:12:Times:trivial with so much of the sample retired.  The strategy places stress on the useful policy variation,
18:652:42322:23:22:72:539:550:12:Times:12:Times:occurring well away from the zero hours point.  Truncating is also practical because observed instead of
18:653:42426:22:23:72:538:528:12:Times:12:Times:imputed wages can be used.31  Truncating might raise concern if people of different ages exhibit different
18:654:42532:23:22:72:318:505:12:Times:8:Times:trends in retirement, but there is little evidence of this.32
18:655:42593:22:23:108:490:483:12:Times:12:Times:A few more details will make (3) operational.  The major features of the tax code are
18:656:42678:23:22:72:537:460:12:Times:12:Times:incorporated.  The estimation includes the payroll tax and the kink generated when people first enter the
18:657:42783:22:23:72:530:438:12:Times:12:Times:income tax system and face a tax rate of 11-15%.  It is the only one of a comparable magnitude to the
18:658:42884:23:22:72:513:415:12:Times:12:Times:earnings test during this time period.  Modeling all the additional small tax kinks would increase the
18:659:42986:22:23:72:506:393:12:Times:12:Times:demands of the type noted by MaCurdy, Green, and Paarsch, subjecting it to considerably more
18:660:43078:23:22:72:521:370:12:Times:12:Times:measurement error without adding meaningful information.  Bunching at the initial tax kink is minor at
18:661:43180:22:23:72:320:348:12:Times:8:Times:best and bunching at any other kink is not discernible.33
18:662:43237:23:22:108:516:325:12:Times:12:Times:A final issue involves assigning people to the kink.  As Section II demonstrated, people are
18:663:43329:22:23:72:533:303:12:Times:12:Times:massed near the earnings test kink, but only some are located exactly on the kink, with many more in a
18:664:43431:23:22:72:535:280:12:Times:12:Times:small range below.  One way that other researchers have handled this is by assigning observations from
18:665:43533:22:24:72:525:258:12:Times:12:Times:a small band on both sides of the kink to the kink itself.  The earnings distributions showed no sign of
18:666:43637:24:9:72:216:234:12:Times:12:Times:                                                
18:667:43685:9:16:72:538:225:6:Times:10:Times:30  The terms involving α' account for the nonconvex kink that people avoid. α' is the value of α corresponding to the indifference
18:668:43816:16:8:72:444:209:10:Times:10:Times:curve tangent to both the middle and upper segments.  This is discussed in more detail in the Appendix.
18:669:43919:8:16:72:531:201:6:Times:10:Times:31  Heckman and MaCurdy (1981) pointed out that the usual sample selection procedure to impute the wage yields inconsistent
18:670:44042:16:12:72:518:185:10:Times:10:Times:estimates in the piecewise linear setting.  The way to handle missing wages is to integrate over the stochastic variation in the
18:671:44170:12:8:72:344:173:10:Times:10:Times:imperfectly observed wage as well as over the other sources of randomness.
18:672:44244:8:16:72:537:165:6:Times:10:Times:32  Labor force participation in the sample fell 2.9 percentage points before and after the 1983 earnings test change.  Though it fell
18:673:44378:16:8:72:437:149:10:Times:10:Times:more for the affected 71-72 year olds than for the older and younger workers, the trends were similar.
18:674:44480:8:16:72:521:141:6:Times:10:Times:33  The Appendix discusses the details.  The nonconvex kink from the payroll tax ceiling on taxable earnings is not included, a
18:675:44607:16:12:72:532:125:10:Times:10:Times:minor detail in this sample with few high earners.  Income taxation of benefits began in 1984 but is ignored here, as it affects few
18:676:44739:12:12:72:527:113:10:Times:10:Times:beneficiaries and only those with earnings well above the exempt amount, and it requires information about tax-exempt interest
18:677:44865:12:12:72:528:101:10:Times:10:Times:income which is unavailable.  Taxes did not change differentially across ages, so a simplified treatment should not confound the
18:678:44993:12:0:72:154:89:10:Times:10:Times:identification strategy.

19:684:45345:23:22:72:512:550:12:Times:12:Times:for 70-71 year olds.  The sample includes the affected group along with two comparison groups –
19:685:45440:22:23:72:513:528:12:Times:12:Times:younger men who face the same budget constraint before 1983, and older men who face the same
19:686:45532:23:22:72:535:505:12:Times:12:Times:budget constraint after.  I also estimate the model on the three years before and after the 1978 increase
19:687:45637:22:23:72:520:483:12:Times:12:Times:in the exempt amount for 65-71 year olds, to check robustness.  The reaction of the affected 65-71
19:688:45735:23:22:72:516:460:12:Times:12:Times:year olds was strong relative to unaffected 63-64 year olds; however, only one natural comparison
19:689:45832:22:23:72:161:438:12:Times:8:Times:group is available.35
19:690:45853:23:22:108:533:415:12:Times:12:Times:Statistics for the sample are reported in Table 4, and the variables are defined in the Appendix.
19:691:45950:22:23:72:528:393:12:Times:12:Times:80% of the 1983 sample does not work.  Within the subsample that works, 57.2% located below the
19:692:46045:23:22:72:530:370:12:Times:12:Times:earnings test kink, 8.9% on the kink, 16.6% on the middle segment above the kink, and 17.3% on the
19:693:46143:22:23:72:527:348:12:Times:12:Times:upper segment.36  Their annuals hours will be explained as a function of their net wage, virtual income,
19:694:46247:23:31:72:226:325:12:Times:12:Times:and other personal characteristics.
19:695:46282:31:9:72:216:294:12:Times:12:Times:                                                
19:696:46330:9:16:72:525:285:6:Times:10:Times:34  As discussed earlier, the interval length of $1000 is appropriate because some people round off their earnings to the nearest
19:697:46459:16:12:72:530:269:10:Times:10:Times:thousand.  Burtless and Moffitt similarly assigned people within 100 annual hours on either side of the earnings test kink to the
19:698:46588:12:12:72:518:257:10:Times:10:Times:kink.  Other papers without major bunching, such as those on income taxes, formalize measurement or optimization error to
19:699:46709:12:12:72:527:245:10:Times:10:Times:explain why individuals locate near, but not on, the kink.  I tried estimating such a model, with observed hours equal to desired
19:700:46838:12:12:72:532:233:10:Times:10:Times:hours plus white noise, but it did not converge.  Moffitt noted that the measurement error variance is identified by dispersion in
19:701:46968:12:8:72:245:221:10:Times:10:Times:bunching at the kink, which does not occur here.
19:702:47016:8:16:72:534:213:6:Times:10:Times:35  The availability of two comparison groups serves to identify the two elasticities of interest.  Longitudinal data would be more
19:703:47147:16:12:72:522:197:10:Times:10:Times:useful, but the Retirement History Survey ended in 1979, the Survey of Income and Program Participation did not begin until
19:704:47270:12:12:72:528:185:10:Times:10:Times:1984, and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics is too small.  A weakness with annual cross-sectional data is that people claim
19:705:47394:12:12:72:532:173:10:Times:10:Times:benefits through the year and may switch to a different part of the budget constraint, but annual earnings and benefits determine
19:706:47523:12:12:72:535:161:10:Times:10:Times:where they are assigned.  Previous research on retirement and the earnings test has generally used annual or biannual data as well.
19:707:47654:12:12:72:532:149:10:Times:10:Times:The timing of claiming is not well understood, and with this data it is impossible to avoid mis-assigning some people.  However,
19:708:47782:12:12:72:534:137:10:Times:10:Times:this will not be systematically related to the identifying earnings test variation and is unlikely to involve the key observations on
19:709:47915:12:8:72:103:125:10:Times:10:Times:the kink.
19:710:47924:8:16:72:525:117:6:Times:10:Times:36  The samples exclude those with self-employment income, negative non-labor non-Social Security income, or a real wage not
19:711:48048:16:12:72:530:101:10:Times:10:Times:between $1 and $100, and those who earn less than the exempt amount but receive no benefits, since they do not claim benefits
19:712:48173:12:0:72:538:89:10:Times:10:Times:for a reason unrelated to the earnings test.  Though this might introduce selection bias, the alternative of modeling benefit claiming
20:713:48309:0:23:72:355:693:12:Times:12:Times:IV.  RESULTS OF THE STRUCTURAL ESTIMATION
20:714:48350:23:22:108:522:670:12:Times:12:Times:This section discusses the estimates of the model in equation (3).  It follows by considering a
20:715:48445:22:23:72:537:648:12:Times:12:Times:number of specification checks that demonstrate the robustness of the results and the closeness of fit.  It
20:716:48552:23:37:72:328:625:12:Times:12:Times:concludes with policy simulations based on the estimates.
20:717:48609:37:23:72:277:588:12:Times:12:Times:A.  Estimates of the Labor Supply Model
20:718:48648:23:22:108:532:565:12:Times:12:Times:The estimates are reported in Table 5.  The coefficients have the predicted signs, and the wage
20:719:48743:22:23:72:533:543:12:Times:12:Times:and income terms are estimated precisely.  The estimated elasticities are large compared to many in the
20:720:48846:23:22:72:530:520:12:Times:12:Times:literature, especially for prime age males.  Still, they follow from the strong reaction to the earnings test
20:721:48955:22:23:72:512:498:12:Times:12:Times:demonstrated earlier and also from the greater variation in hours among older workers.  The 1983
20:722:49051:23:22:72:535:475:12:Times:12:Times:estimates indicate that a $1 increase in the real wage would lead to an increase of 48 hours worked per
20:723:49154:22:23:72:535:453:12:Times:12:Times:year, implying an uncompensated wage elasticity of 0.316 at the sample means.  The income coefficient
20:724:49255:23:22:72:513:430:12:Times:12:Times:indicates that a $1000 increase in non-labor income would lower hours worked by 17, yielding an
20:725:49350:22:23:72:289:408:12:Times:12:Times:income elasticity of -0.332 at the sample means.
20:726:49398:23:22:108:531:385:12:Times:12:Times:The 1978 estimates are generally slightly smaller but similar in magnitude, a sign that the results
20:727:49497:22:23:72:517:363:12:Times:12:Times:are robust.  In the rest of the discussion, I will focus on the 1983 results because they are based on
20:728:49599:23:22:72:523:340:12:Times:12:Times:more substantial identifying variation and because they relate directly to the proposed policy changes
20:729:49701:22:23:72:506:318:12:Times:12:Times:today.  These involve changes in the earnings test for ages 65-69, and in particular eliminating the
20:730:49801:23:22:72:333:295:12:Times:12:Times:earnings test entirely, as occurred in 1983 for ages 70-71.
20:731:49860:22:23:108:517:273:12:Times:12:Times:The large elasticity estimates imply significant deadweight loss imposed by the earnings test.
20:732:49954:23:22:72:480:250:12:Times:12:Times:Exact deadweight loss can be computed using the unique indirect and direct utility functions
20:733:50046:22:23:72:529:228:12:Times:12:Times:corresponding to the linear labor supply function, as in Hausman (1981).  The 1983 estimates indicate
20:734:50147:23:22:72:535:205:12:Times:12:Times:average deadweight loss for people located on the kink of $1923 – without the earnings test, we would
20:735:50248:22:23:72:518:183:12:Times:12:Times:have to take away $1923 to make them as unhappy as they are with the earnings test.  The average
20:736:50344:23:22:72:520:160:12:Times:12:Times:deadweight loss for people on the middle segment, facing a 50% tax rate, is $892.  While their total
20:737:50444:22:36:72:524:138:12:Times:12:Times:utility loss is higher, worth $4603 on average, their deadweight loss is smaller because of the benefits
20:738:50548:36:13:72:540:102:12:Times:12:Times:                                                                                                                                                            
20:739:50704:13:0:72:222:89:10:Times:10:Times:would be a stretch with the available data.
21:740:50749:0:23:72:539:708:12:Times:12:Times:they forfeit to the earnings test.37  However, it is important to recall that most of the benefits are returned
21:741:50860:23:22:72:527:685:12:Times:12:Times:over the long-run because of the actuarial adjustment and Delayed Retirement Credit, leaving only the
21:742:50961:22:23:72:532:663:12:Times:12:Times:deadweight loss.  Thus, the earnings test imposes high efficiency costs, relative to shrinking fiscal gains.
21:743:51069:23:22:108:532:640:12:Times:12:Times:The estimation controls for education, race, marital status, and age.  People with at least a high
21:744:51167:22:23:72:531:618:12:Times:12:Times:school education and nonwhites work more.  In 1978 married people work slightly more, and in 1983
21:745:51264:23:22:72:527:595:12:Times:12:Times:they work slightly less.38,39  Age has the usual negative effect on labor supply.  To verify that the wage
21:746:51370:22:23:72:521:573:12:Times:12:Times:and income coefficients are not picking up nonlinear age effects on labor supply – which might occur
21:747:51470:23:22:72:503:550:12:Times:12:Times:because the policy variation is a function of age – I tried adding a quadratic in age.  Including the
21:748:51571:22:23:72:512:528:12:Times:12:Times:quadratic does not change the wage and income coefficients.  It makes both age terms individually
21:749:51668:23:22:72:518:505:12:Times:12:Times:insignificant and negative but jointly significant; and as the quadratic does not add appreciably to the
21:750:51772:22:23:72:540:483:12:Times:12:Times:explanatory power of the estimation, I left it out.  I also tried including a linear time trend or a dummy for
21:751:51882:23:22:72:536:460:12:Times:12:Times:the years following the rule changes, to allow for a time effect on labor supply that might be confounded
21:752:51987:22:23:72:435:438:12:Times:12:Times:with the earnings test variation; the coefficients were insignificant in both samples.
21:753:52073:23:22:108:529:415:12:Times:12:Times:The changes in the earnings test rules over time and across age groups are presumed to be the
21:754:52166:22:23:72:539:393:12:Times:12:Times:source of identifying variation.  Our confidence in the estimates depends on the degree to which they are
21:755:52271:23:22:72:529:370:12:Times:12:Times:determined by the earnings test variation, as opposed to the potentially endogenous variation in wages
21:756:52373:22:23:72:517:348:12:Times:12:Times:and non-labor income.  A series of exercises, summarized in Table 6, confirm the importance of the
21:757:52471:23:22:72:292:325:12:Times:12:Times:earnings test variation in generating the estimates.
21:758:52523:22:23:108:533:303:12:Times:12:Times:First, estimating labor supply using OLS with the gross wage and other income – instead of the
21:759:52617:23:22:72:535:280:12:Times:12:Times:net wage and virtual income – yields insignificant coefficients with the wrong signs, so accounting for the
21:760:52724:22:23:72:539:258:12:Times:12:Times:shape of the budget constraint is crucial for obtaining sensible estimates.  A similar point is demonstrated
21:761:52832:23:22:72:527:235:12:Times:12:Times:by including income and payroll taxes but not the earnings test.  The estimation does not converge, so
21:762:52934:22:23:72:509:213:12:Times:12:Times:the remaining variation is insufficient to yield results.  Estimating the model using non-labor income
21:763:53036:23:22:72:512:190:12:Times:12:Times:instead of virtual income in effect turns off the income variation from the shifts in the kinked budget
21:764:53139:22:9:72:216:168:12:Times:12:Times:                                                
21:765:53187:9:16:72:529:159:6:Times:10:Times:37  People on the upper segment of the budget constraint experience no deadweight loss because they face only an income effect
21:766:53313:16:8:72:272:143:10:Times:10:Times:from losing all their benefits, but no substitution effect.
21:767:53372:8:12:72:476:135:6:Times:10:Times:38  The effects of education, race and marital status are not statistically different if freed up by age group or time.
21:768:53491:12:16:72:528:123:6:Times:10:Times:39  As discussed earlier, the earnings test treats spousal earnings differently if the spouse receives dependent or retiree benefits,
21:769:53624:16:12:72:530:107:10:Times:10:Times:which is not reported in the CPS.  This might make the results sensitive to marital status, so I tried stratifying the sample.  The
21:770:53755:12:0:72:533:95:10:Times:10:Times:estimates were almost identical, with substitution and income elasticities in the 1983 sample of 0.318 (0.016) and -0.328 (0.026)
22:771:53886:0:23:72:493:708:12:Times:12:Times:constraint.  The result is that the earnings test variation gets channeled into a much larger wage
22:772:53984:23:22:72:520:685:12:Times:12:Times:coefficient.  The coefficient on non-labor income becomes less significant, so the variation due to the
22:773:54087:22:23:72:159:663:12:Times:12:Times:earnings test is key.
22:774:54108:23:22:108:508:640:12:Times:12:Times:I also tried estimating the model for various subsets of the sample, eliminating some of the
22:775:54200:22:23:72:538:618:12:Times:12:Times:earnings test variation to gauge its importance.  In the pre-1983 sample the estimation did not converge.
22:776:54305:23:22:72:533:595:12:Times:12:Times:In the other cases the estimates were less precise and somewhat, though not statistically, different.  The
22:777:54411:22:23:72:494:573:12:Times:12:Times:comparison with 66-70 year olds has the strongest influence.  Since they face the earnings test
22:778:54506:23:22:72:536:550:12:Times:12:Times:throughout, it suggests again its importance in the estimation.   These results suggest that both the cross-
22:779:54614:22:23:72:317:528:12:Times:12:Times:age and time-series earnings test variation is important.
22:780:54671:23:22:108:539:505:12:Times:12:Times:I tried another specification check allowing the Delayed Retirement Credit to mitigate the impact
22:781:54768:22:23:72:535:483:12:Times:12:Times:of the earnings test.  I undertook this by freeing up the earnings test tax rate from both the net wage and
22:782:54875:23:22:72:538:460:12:Times:12:Times:virtual income terms and including an additional coefficient affecting the tax terms jointly.  The coefficient
22:783:54985:22:23:72:520:438:12:Times:12:Times:can be viewed as a measure of tax sensitivity, which should fall below one if the Delayed Retirement
22:784:55085:23:22:72:538:415:12:Times:12:Times:Credit reduces the impact of the earnings test.  The estimated coefficient did not drop below one, so the
22:785:55190:22:23:72:459:393:12:Times:12:Times:Delayed Retirement Credit does not appear to affect the response to the earnings test.
22:786:55276:23:22:108:527:370:12:Times:12:Times:Lastly, to check the model's fit, Table 7 compares actual location on the budget constraint for
22:787:55371:22:23:72:525:348:12:Times:12:Times:66-70 year olds to predicted location.40  The model correctly predicted segment location for 85% of
22:788:55470:23:22:72:506:325:12:Times:12:Times:the group, a very close fit overall.  The model also predicted hours relatively closely for the entire
22:789:55572:22:23:72:535:303:12:Times:12:Times:sample, and for those at or above the earnings test kink and being directly affected by the earnings test.
22:790:55678:23:22:72:503:280:12:Times:12:Times:This suggests that the estimates will reliably predict the response to other possible changes in the
22:791:55778:22:38:72:155:258:12:Times:12:Times:earnings test rules.
22:792:55798:38:22:72:179:220:12:Times:12:Times:B.  Policy Simulations
22:793:55820:22:23:108:519:198:12:Times:12:Times:The labor supply estimates in Table 5 allow us to simulate the impact of other changes in the
22:794:55913:23:22:72:497:175:12:Times:12:Times:earnings test rules.  The simulations also give a better sense about the estimates, since elasticity
22:795:56013:22:23:72:540:153:12:Times:12:Times:calculations pertain only to marginal changes away from the kinks.  Table 8 reports simulations removing
22:796:56117:23:22:72:525:130:12:Times:12:Times:the earnings test for 65-69 year olds or raising their exempt amount to $30,000, which it will reach in
22:797:56220:22:13:72:540:108:12:Times:12:Times:                                                                                                                                                            
22:798:56376:13:0:72:311:95:10:Times:10:Times:for married and 0.332 (0.040) and -0.331 (0.053) for single people.
23:799:56445:0:23:72:515:708:12:Times:12:Times:2002.  The first simulation simply repeats the 1983 change for another age group, while the second
23:800:56543:23:22:72:538:685:12:Times:12:Times:simulation amounts to doing so for many, so the estimates should be informative.  Since the earnings test
23:801:56648:22:23:72:505:663:12:Times:12:Times:has been altered since 1983, the simulations are best compared to those identified as the Current
23:802:56745:23:22:72:532:640:12:Times:12:Times:Benchmark predictions, where the earnings test parameters have been updated to resemble the current
23:803:56844:22:23:72:525:618:12:Times:12:Times:rules.  The Benchmark predicts mean hours of 1251 for all workers and 1782 for those located at or
23:804:56942:23:22:72:149:595:12:Times:8:Times:above the kink.41
23:805:56959:22:23:108:538:573:12:Times:12:Times:Removing the earnings test would raise mean hours for people initially at or above the kink from
23:806:57055:23:22:72:507:550:12:Times:12:Times:1782 to 1876, a 5.3% increase.  The positive substitution effect from eliminating the earnings test
23:807:57154:22:23:72:539:528:12:Times:12:Times:dominates in the aggregate, therefore.  The lower panel makes this more explicit, reporting the change in
23:808:57259:23:22:72:535:505:12:Times:12:Times:average earnings by initial location on the budget constraint.  The substitution effect for those at the kink
23:809:57368:22:23:72:524:483:12:Times:12:Times:causes a 50% increase in average earnings, from $8,758 under the benchmark to $13,145 predicted
23:810:57463:23:22:72:522:460:12:Times:12:Times:without the earnings test.  While the negative income effect grows along the middle segment, average
23:811:57563:22:23:72:530:438:12:Times:12:Times:earnings are still predicted to rise 18% from $18,600 to $21,983.  The income effect for those initially
23:812:57667:23:22:72:538:415:12:Times:12:Times:on the upper segment leads them to work less and reduce their earnings 4%, from $43,892 to $42,128.
23:813:57766:22:23:72:537:393:12:Times:12:Times:Nevertheless, the overall effect on hours and earnings of eliminating the earnings test is strongly positive.
23:814:57875:23:22:108:534:370:12:Times:12:Times:While the high initial cost is one deterrent to eliminating the earnings test, the medium run cost is
23:815:57976:22:23:72:537:348:12:Times:12:Times:small and declining.42  The cost would gradually be offset because the Delayed Retirement Credit would
23:816:58078:23:22:72:518:325:12:Times:12:Times:not be granted to beneficiaries who otherwise get higher benefits later when they lose benefits to the
23:817:58180:22:23:72:536:303:12:Times:12:Times:earnings test today, as Honig and Reimers (1989) pointed out.  At present, the cumulative fiscal cost of
23:818:58284:23:22:72:517:280:12:Times:12:Times:eliminating the earnings test is diminishing as the Delayed Retirement Credit is increased every other
23:819:58386:22:23:72:520:258:12:Times:12:Times:year.  Once the Delayed Retirement Credit becomes fully actuarially fair for the average beneficiary,
23:820:58487:23:25:72:525:235:12:Times:8:Times:then the cost of eliminating the earnings test today will be virtually canceled out within several years.43
23:821:58594:25:9:72:540:210:12:Times:12:Times:                                                                                                                                                            
23:822:58750:9:12:72:460:201:6:Times:10:Times:40  Tables 7 and 8 focus on 66-70 year olds, who are the 65-69 year olds facing the earnings test throughout.
23:823:58859:12:16:72:506:189:6:Times:10:Times:41  In 1995 65-69 year olds faced a tax rate of 33% instead of 50% and an exempt amount about 20% higher in real terms.
23:824:58978:16:12:72:522:173:10:Times:10:Times:Separately lowering the tax rate or raising the exempt amount are each predicted to reduce average hours, but by less than one
23:825:59104:12:12:72:526:161:10:Times:10:Times:percent.  Lowering the tax rate is predicted to induce a small increase in earnings (about 3%) even for those located at the kink,
23:826:59234:12:8:72:342:149:10:Times:10:Times:which is consistent with the lack of reaction in 1990 observed in Section II.
23:827:59311:8:16:72:532:141:6:Times:10:Times:42 Leonesio (1993) reported Social Security Administration forecasts that eliminating the earnings test for ages 65-69 would cost
23:828:59439:16:12:72:538:125:10:Times:10:Times:$4.3 billion in the first year.  Increased tax payments would offset 14.8% of that.  The forecasts are based on Hanoch and Honig’s
23:829:59569:12:12:72:515:113:10:Times:10:Times:(1983) estimates of 0.17 for the uncompensated wage elasticity and virtually zero for the income elasticity.  The elasticities
23:830:59695:12:8:72:331:101:10:Times:10:Times:estimated here imply a greater boost to labor supply and tax collections.
23:831:59768:8:0:72:503:93:6:Times:10:Times:43  The medium-run offset might not be complete due to adverse selection:  the lower a person’s life expectancy, the less
24:832:59891:0:23:108:530:708:12:Times:12:Times:Lastly, Table 8 reports the results of simulating the increase in the exempt amount to $30,000.
24:833:59986:23:22:72:499:685:12:Times:12:Times:Interestingly, aggregate hours for those at or above the kink would be virtually unchanged.  The
24:834:60082:22:23:72:529:663:12:Times:12:Times:breakdown of earnings by initial location gives more insight.  Average earnings for those initially on the
24:835:60188:23:22:72:512:640:12:Times:12:Times:middle segment barely rise, compared to the substantial increase from eliminating the earnings test.
24:836:60288:22:23:72:525:618:12:Times:12:Times:Average earnings for those on the upper segment fall by 10%.  They experience not only the negative
24:837:60387:23:22:72:527:595:12:Times:12:Times:income effect, as they would if the earnings test were eliminated, but also a negative substitution effect
24:838:60493:22:23:72:530:573:12:Times:12:Times:from facing the earnings test tax rate.44  In sum, raising the earnings exempt amount makes the earnings
24:839:60597:23:22:72:488:550:12:Times:12:Times:test bind for a new group of people with higher earnings, who would lower their labor supply
24:840:60689:22:38:72:132:528:12:Times:12:Times:considerably.
24:841:60702:38:22:72:180:490:12:Times:12:Times:VI.  CONCLUSIONS
24:842:60718:22:23:108:539:468:12:Times:12:Times:The earnings test has been the subject of substantial popular attention, but less academic interest
24:843:60817:23:22:72:531:445:12:Times:12:Times:in recent years.  This paper revisits the evidence on the earnings test using more recent data and a new
24:844:60921:22:23:72:504:423:12:Times:12:Times:identification strategy.  Several changes in the earnings test rules altered the budget constraint for
24:845:61023:23:22:72:523:400:12:Times:12:Times:beneficiaries of certain ages and not other ages.  Comparing the reactions of beneficiaries before and
24:846:61125:22:23:72:527:378:12:Times:12:Times:after the changes, using the unaffected groups to control for other changes in labor supply, isolates the
24:847:61230:23:22:72:501:355:12:Times:12:Times:reaction to the earnings test.  This strategy is implemented here using a combination of methods.
24:848:61327:22:23:108:528:333:12:Times:12:Times:The first approach focuses on the strongest implication of the theory – that we should observe
24:849:61421:23:22:72:521:310:12:Times:12:Times:bunching at the convex kink induced by the earnings test.  The data show that people respond to the
24:850:61520:22:23:72:540:288:12:Times:12:Times:earnings test by clustering at the kink in substantial numbers.  The clustering moves when the kink moves
24:851:61625:23:22:72:518:265:12:Times:12:Times:and disappears when the earnings test is eliminated.  The clustering is evidence that the earnings test
24:852:61728:22:23:72:327:243:12:Times:12:Times:leads some beneficiaries to hold down their labor supply.
24:853:61785:23:22:108:533:220:12:Times:12:Times:The behavior around the exempt amount is the most noticeable but is not a complete picture of
24:854:61878:22:36:72:499:198:12:Times:12:Times:the earnings test’s impact.  Therefore, I also estimate a model of labor supply that characterizes
24:855:61976:36:13:72:540:162:12:Times:12:Times:                                                                                                                                                            
24:856:62132:13:8:72:363:149:10:Times:10:Times:constrained they will be to postpone filing for benefits without the earnings test.
24:857:62215:8:16:72:519:141:6:Times:10:Times:44  This result in particular depends on the assumption that everyone can adjust their labor supply flexibly.  However, while
24:858:62340:16:12:72:529:125:10:Times:10:Times:those near the kink can (and do) adjust their hours, others who work a lot may have less flexibility.  If labor supply of those on
24:859:62470:12:12:72:537:113:10:Times:10:Times:the upper segment were completely inflexible, then the static response to raising the exempt amount would be less negative – and
24:860:62598:12:12:72:518:101:10:Times:10:Times:similarly, the response to eliminating the earnings test would be more strongly positive.  On the other hand, if the incentives
24:861:62725:12:0:72:511:89:10:Times:10:Times:become great enough, full-time workers might choose to leave their jobs for part-time work – a stronger negative response.
25:862:62849:0:23:72:521:708:12:Times:12:Times:behavior along the entire budget constraint.  A typical criticism of this type of estimation, however, is
25:863:62954:23:22:72:537:685:12:Times:12:Times:that it overlooks identification of the parameter estimates.  This is where the variation in the earnings test
25:864:63064:22:23:72:505:663:12:Times:12:Times:rules, causing major shifts in the budget constraint, is most important.  The policy changes induce
25:865:63163:23:22:72:511:640:12:Times:12:Times:substantial variation in the right-hand side variables to identify the model's estimates.  The resulting
25:866:63267:22:23:72:512:618:12:Times:12:Times:income and substitution elasticities are relatively large, implying considerable deadweight loss from
25:867:63368:23:22:72:189:595:12:Times:12:Times:taxation of older workers.
25:868:63394:22:23:108:530:573:12:Times:12:Times:The estimates from a formal model also yield predictions about the effect of various policies to
25:869:63490:23:22:72:513:550:12:Times:12:Times:liberalize the earnings test.  Thus, it was interesting to find that the model predicts a slight decline in
25:870:63597:22:23:72:523:528:12:Times:12:Times:aggregate labor supply among 65-69 year olds resulting from raising the exempt amount to $30,000,
25:871:63694:23:22:72:538:505:12:Times:12:Times:which will occur by 2002.  The positive effect on hours worked by low earners gets offset by a negative
25:872:63797:22:23:72:523:483:12:Times:12:Times:effect for high earners.  On the other hand, the model predicts that eliminating the earnings test would
25:873:63901:23:22:72:539:460:12:Times:12:Times:raise aggregate hours by 5.3%, with a major increase for people at and near the kink.  The fiscal cost of
25:874:64006:22:23:72:533:438:12:Times:12:Times:such a measure would shrink over the medium run and is approaching zero, because increased benefits
25:875:64105:23:22:72:503:415:12:Times:12:Times:from the Delayed Retirement Credit would no longer be triggered as beneficiaries no longer lose
25:876:64200:22:23:72:504:393:12:Times:12:Times:benefits.  Further savings might arise because workers age 65 and over are covered first by their
25:877:64297:23:22:72:533:370:12:Times:12:Times:employer-provided health insurance and only secondarily by Medicare.  Finally, those who continue to
25:878:64397:22:23:72:515:348:12:Times:12:Times:work into their relative old age even with only moderate earnings will be able to save more for their
25:879:64498:23:22:72:530:325:12:Times:12:Times:eventual retirement.  These results demonstrate the usefulness of the substantial changes in the earnings
25:880:64603:22:23:72:331:303:12:Times:12:Times:test rules in exposing underlying labor supply preferences.
25:881:64662:23:22:108:499:280:12:Times:12:Times:The estimated elasticities also tell us about the labor supply of the working elderly more
25:882:64752:22:23:72:532:258:12:Times:12:Times:generally, a distinct focus compared to most previous research on retirement.  The estimates imply that
25:883:64855:23:22:72:530:235:12:Times:12:Times:rules affecting hours choices conditional on working will influence the success of other policies that aim
25:884:64961:22:23:72:513:213:12:Times:12:Times:to encourage later retirement.  The results also suggest a potentially severe negative effect on labor
25:885:65063:23:22:72:530:190:12:Times:12:Times:supply if benefits start to be means tested – a proposal that has gained attention in Congress.  Another
25:886:65167:22:23:72:531:168:12:Times:12:Times:important consideration will involve 62-64 year olds.  Compared to 65-69 year olds they face a much
25:887:65266:23:22:72:519:145:12:Times:12:Times:more restrictive earnings test, with a 50% tax rate and an exempt amount virtually unchanged in real
25:888:65366:22:23:72:539:123:12:Times:12:Times:terms since the mid-1970s.  As the median retirement age continues to drop, the earnings test is likely to
25:889:65472:23:0:72:536:100:12:Times:12:Times:grow more binding on the labor supply of this age group over time.  Furthermore, these tighter rules will
26:890:65579:0:23:72:532:708:12:Times:12:Times:gradually be extended to 65 and 66 year olds as the normal retirement age is raised beginning in 2000.
26:891:65681:23:22:72:532:685:12:Times:12:Times:In sum, the earnings test is an important consideration in understanding the decisions of the elderly who
26:892:65786:22:0:72:152:663:12:Times:12:Times:continue to work.

30:1005:73535:15:15:72:534:175:12:Times:12:Times:value of α, the heterogeneity error term defined in (1), that sets equal the indirect utility functions on the
30:1006:73645:15:15:72:535:160:12:Times:12:Times:middle and upper segments.  The log likelihood specifies that someone locates on the middle segment if

31:1023:74127:44:15:72:527:618:12:Times:12:Times:Taxes.  A simplified version of the income tax system is incorporated into the estimation, although it is
31:1024:74232:15:15:72:531:603:12:Times:12:Times:not specified in (3).  Payroll taxes are assumed to apply to all earnings.  The lowest federal income tax
31:1025:74337:15:15:72:516:588:12:Times:12:Times:rate is also incorporated, along with the kink corresponding to that tax bracket for people with low
31:1026:74437:15:15:72:514:573:12:Times:12:Times:income, who do not face income taxes for the first hour of work.  In some cases the location of the
31:1027:74536:15:15:72:514:558:12:Times:12:Times:initial tax kink and the earnings test kink coincide within $1000 (8% of the sample) or are reversed
31:1028:74636:15:15:72:167:543:12:Times:12:Times:(10% of the sample).
31:1029:74656:15:15:108:531:528:12:Times:12:Times:This could raise the concern that the location of the tax kink might interfere with the analysis of
31:1030:74755:15:15:72:516:513:12:Times:12:Times:bunching at the earnings test kink.  However, since the income tax treatment is the same across age
31:1031:74854:15:15:72:538:498:12:Times:12:Times:groups, comparisons will difference out the effect of the tax kink.  Furthermore, the data suggest that the
31:1032:74961:15:15:72:536:483:12:Times:12:Times:income tax kink is not very important.  There does not appear to be significant bunching at the initial tax
31:1033:75068:15:15:72:530:468:12:Times:12:Times:kink:  the number of people within $1000 below the initial tax kink is less than one-third of the number
31:1034:75172:15:15:72:521:453:12:Times:12:Times:within $1000 below the earnings test kink and causes no visible or statistically significant spike in the
31:1035:75277:15:15:72:529:438:12:Times:12:Times:earnings distribution.  Moreover, the kinks coincide for only a small proportion of the sample.  Finally,
31:1036:75382:15:15:72:514:423:12:Times:12:Times:71-72 year olds in particular exhibit no noticeable bunching at the initial tax kink after 1983, which
31:1037:75484:15:15:72:538:408:12:Times:12:Times:serves as a check on their pre-1983 behavior when this might be of concern.  Therefore, the reaction to
31:1038:75587:15:30:72:390:393:12:Times:12:Times:the tax kink does not appear to interfere with the earnings test analysis.

31:1040:75760:15:15:72:531:348:12:Times:12:Times:the earnings test omits the terms specific to the earnings test.  Those with high non-labor income face a
31:1041:75865:15:15:72:531:333:12:Times:12:Times:single budget segment and pay income and FICA taxes, and those with low non-labor income face the
31:1042:75962:15:0:72:146:318:12:Times:12:Times:income tax kink.
