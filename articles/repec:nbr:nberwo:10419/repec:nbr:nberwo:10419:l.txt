2:26:1373:14:45:273:338:624:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:C:ABSTRACT
2:27:1381:45:24:72:539:579:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:This  paper  examines  why  some  employers  provide  matching  contributions  to  401(k)  plans  in
2:28:1481:24:24:72:540:555:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:company  stock  and  explores  the  implications  of  match  policy  for  employee  retirement  wealth.
2:29:1584:24:24:72:540:531:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:Unlike stock option grants to non-executives, a firm's decision to match in company stock does not
2:30:1682:24:24:72:539:507:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:appear  to  be  strongly  correlated  with  cash  flow  or  with  measures  of  the  benefits  of  aligning
2:31:1789:24:24:72:540:483:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:incentives  of  employees  and  employers.  Rather,  we  find  evidence  that  firms  are  more  likely  to
2:32:1896:24:24:72:540:459:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:provide the match in company stock if firm risk is low (i.e. lower stock price volatility and lower
2:33:1995:24:24:72:540:435:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:bankruptcy risk) and employees are also covered by a defined benefit plan. These findings suggest
2:34:2092:24:24:72:540:411:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:that firms consider the retirement security of their workers in making the match decision, either
2:35:2189:24:24:72:540:387:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:because  firms  want  to  minimize  the  risk  of  violating  their  fiduciary  responsibility  or  because
2:36:2296:24:24:72:540:363:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:employees more fully value company stock at companies with lower firm-specific risk. Evidence
2:37:2389:24:24:72:539:339:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:also indicates that firms may want to match in company stock to boost employee ownership, perhaps
2:38:2486:24:24:72:539:315:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:to help deter takeovers, or because of the tax advantages for dividends on the company stock match.
2:39:2585:24:24:72:539:291:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:Simulation results suggest that sufficiently risk-tolerant individuals actually prefer a 401(k) plan at
2:40:2688:24:24:72:540:267:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:a company with a company stock match to a plan at a company with an unrestricted match, unless
2:41:2782:24:32:72:285:243:144:g_d0_f1:144:g_d0_f1:C:the equity premium is reduced substantially.

3:61:3153:0:20:72:154:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:C:I.  Introduction 
3:62:3170:20:21:108:538:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Company stock in 401(k) plans has been the subject of intense scrutiny by policy makers 
3:63:3258:21:21:72:522:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:over the past several years.  In the wake of high profile corporate bankruptcies for companies 
3:64:3353:21:20:72:530:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that had a large fraction of 401(k) plan assets invested in company stock, numerous lawmakers 
3:65:3447:20:21:72:541:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:began calling for new regulations and restrictions on company stock ownership in 401(k) plans.1  
3:66:3544:21:21:71:537:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:In part motivated by these events, a growing number of academic papers have begun to examine 
3:67:3637:21:20:71:535:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:assets in 401(k) plans in general, and the effects of employer match policy in particular.  Recent 
3:68:3736:20:21:71:522:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:research papers have examined the relative adequacy of retirement wealth for defined benefit 
3:69:3829:21:21:71:528:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:versus defined contribution plans (Samwick and Skinner, 2003; Even and McPherson, 2003a), 
3:70:3919:21:21:71:540:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the importance of plan design and employee inertia (Choi, Laibson, Madrian, and Metrick, 2001; 
3:71:4014:21:20:71:533:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Agnew, Balduzzi, and Sunden, 2003), the effect of 401(k) match policy on employee purchases 
3:72:4106:20:21:71:539:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of company stock (Bernartzi 2001; Liang and Weisbenner, 2002), and the role of company stock 
3:73:4199:21:21:71:394:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in 401(k) portfolios (Mitchell and Utkus, 2004; VanderHei, 2002). 
3:74:4265:21:20:107:512:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Notably absent from this literature is an understanding of why companies choose to 
3:75:4348:20:21:71:516:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:provide their match in company stock in the first place.2  After all, standard portfolio theory 
3:76:4444:21:21:71:528:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:suggests that there are potentially large welfare costs to forcing employees to hold part of their 
3:77:4543:21:20:71:516:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:portfolio in company stock (Meulbroek, 2002).  Presumably, there must be some benefits of 
3:78:4633:20:21:71:499:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:providing a match in company stock to offset these potential welfare costs, or else profit-
3:79:4724:21:21:71:536:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:maximizing companies would not compensate their employees in a form that may not be valued 
3:80:4815:21:20:71:506:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:fully.  Indeed, there are a number of potential benefits to a firm from providing a match in 
3:81:4908:20:21:71:492:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company stock.  Specifically, a match in company stock has lower expenses than other 
3:82:4993:21:21:71:534:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:investment options, can free up cash for other uses, boosts employee ownership, and potentially 
3:83:5089:21:21:71:537:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:reduces corporate taxes if the firm pays dividends.  Firms that match in company stock may also 
3:84:5185:21:20:71:542:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:be those where the cost to employees of being concentrated in company stock is the lowest.  That 
3:85:5282:20:21:71:503:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is, the costs of matching in company stock could be lower at firms that also provide other 
3:86:5373:21:25:71:521:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement benefits or have lower stock price volatility.  We test these alternative hypotheses, 
3:87:5470:25:7:71:219:166:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
3:88:5518:7:16:72:535:159:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:1 For example, Senators Boxer and Corzine introduced legislation that would place a 20 percent cap on the share of 
3:89:5633:16:12:71:322:143:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:401(k) plan balances that could be invested in company stock.

3:91:5771:7:16:72:535:124:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:2 In a paper written concurrently with this one, Even and Macpherson (2003b) examine why company stock is held 
3:92:5882:16:11:71:536:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:in defined contribution plans, but do not specifically focus on match policy.  Our study focuses on why, conditional 
3:93:5999:11:12:71:523:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:on offering company stock as an investment option, firms decide to offer a match in company stock.  Most large 
3:94:6110:12:11:71:542:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:publicly-traded corporations offer company stock as an investment option while approximately one-third require that 
3:95:6226:11:0:71:434:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:the match be held in company stock (Profit Sharing / 401(k) Council of America, 2002).    
4:96:6317:0:20:72:536:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:providing the first evidence of how a company’s decision to provide its match in company stock 
4:97:6412:20:21:72:424:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:or to offer an unrestricted match is affected by company characteristics.   
4:98:6488:21:21:108:542:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Using a sample of all publicly traded companies that filed an 11-k statement from 1994 to 
4:99:6578:21:20:72:531:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:2001,3 we find little evidence that firms provide the employer match in company stock because 
4:100:6672:20:21:71:534:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of cash flow constraints or to increase employee ownership to better align incentives.  This is in 
4:101:6771:21:21:71:519:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:contrast to the literature on stock options to non-executive employees, which finds that these 
4:102:6866:21:20:71:439:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:factors are important determinants of options grants (Core and Guay, 2001). 
4:103:6942:20:21:107:534:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Instead, we find that less risky firms, in terms of lower stock price volatility and a lower 
4:104:7035:21:21:71:531:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:expected bankruptcy rate, are more likely to provide the employer match in company stock.  In 
4:105:7129:21:21:71:510:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:addition, we find that firms that have a defined benefit plan are significantly more likely to 
4:106:7224:21:20:71:511:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:provide the match in company stock, particularly if the match is small relative to employee 
4:107:7316:20:21:71:536:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:contributions and hence employer contributions to the 401(k) plan are a less important source of 
4:108:7413:21:21:71:539:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:wealth for employees.  These findings suggest that firms do take into account the effect of match 
4:109:7511:21:20:71:533:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:policy on the retirement security of plan participants, either because firms want to minimize the

4:111:7702:21:21:71:534:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) or because employees at these firms more fully value 
4:112:7794:21:20:71:536:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company stock because of the lower firm-specific risk.  Our results also suggest that some firms 
4:113:7891:20:21:71:524:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:may match in company stock to put stock in “friendly hands” to help thwart takeovers.  Firms 
4:114:7984:21:21:71:512:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with multiple classes of stock, which confer superior voting rights on management, are less 
4:115:8076:21:20:71:533:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:likely to match with company stock, consistent with Rauh (2003) who found that state takeover 
4:116:8170:20:21:71:491:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:laws and the company stock holdings in defined contribution (DC) plans of companies 
4:117:8254:21:21:71:498:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:incorporated in those states are substitutes.  In addition, we find that the likelihood of an 
4:118:8348:21:21:71:523:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employer match in company stock increases with the dividend yield, likely because of the tax 
4:119:8441:21:20:71:541:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:benefit associated with dividends paid on stock in leveraged ESOP plans.4  However, the relation 
4:120:8538:20:21:72:211:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with dividends is not robust. 
4:121:8568:21:21:108:536:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:We then confirm the findings of prior work concerning the effect of the 401(k) match on 
4:122:8656:21:27:72:516:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participant behavior.  Consistent with past research (Benartzi, 2001; Liang and Weisbenner,

4:125:8915:16:12:71:530:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:the past year such as employee and employer contributions to the various investment options.  See Section II for a 
4:126:9030:12:7:71:153:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:further description.  
4:127:9052:7:16:72:536:101:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:4 The firm is allowed to deduct dividends paid on stock contributed to leveraged ESOP plans from taxable income.  
4:128:9166:16:11:71:502:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:The match component of a defined contribution plan can be converted to a leveraged ESOP to reap this tax

5:130:9297:0:20:72:528:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f5:B:2002), we show that having an employer match in company stock leads employees to increase 
5:131:9387:20:21:72:512:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:their own purchases of company stock, resulting in even more concentrated holdings.  This 
5:132:9477:21:21:72:510:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:finding has been attributed to a match in company stock being interpreted by employees as 
5:133:9567:21:20:72:535:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:implicit investment advice that company stock is a good investment.  Further, we document that 
5:134:9662:20:21:71:481:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:about two-fifths of this boost in company stock purchases comes from a reduction in 
5:135:9746:21:21:71:507:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:contributions to the safest, lowest-return asset in the plan, typically a money market fund.

5:137:9924:20:21:71:535:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:behavior, we then present simulations of the expected distribution of 401(k) account balances at 
5:138:10021:21:21:71:522:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement in order to assess the effect of an employer match in company stock on participant 
5:139:10115:21:21:71:524:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement security.  We present a number of alternative simulations to capture both the direct 
5:140:10211:21:20:71:527:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:effect of the match (i.e., the entire match is made in company stock) and the indirect effects of 
5:141:10309:20:21:72:542:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the match (e.g., individuals contribute more of their own contribution to company stock when the 
5:142:10406:21:21:72:513:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:match is in company stock).  Rather than imposing a strictly optimal portfolio selection, we 
5:143:10499:21:20:72:525:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:parameterize the simulations to reflect the available evidence on how 401(k) plan participants 
5:144:10594:20:21:72:490:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:actually behave.  In particular, we assume an “average” participant follows a naïve 1/n

5:146:10779:21:20:72:531:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Liang and Weisbenner, 2002), boosts own allocations to company stock in response to a match 
5:147:10871:20:21:72:525:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in company stock (Benartzi, 2001; Liang and Weisbenner, 2002), and rarely rebalances assets 
5:148:10963:21:21:72:538:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(Samuelson and Zeckhauser, 1988; Ameriks and Zeldes, 2001), which leads to a greater share of 
5:149:11057:21:20:72:533:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:assets in equities in company stock match portfolios.  These parameterizations result in an asset 
5:150:11155:20:21:72:499:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:composition of the simulated contributions and account balances that correspond well to 
5:151:11243:21:21:72:534:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:observed 401(k) plans.  In later simulations, we consider the desirability of a match in company 
5:152:11340:21:21:72:541:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stock for participants that would otherwise invest all of their own contributions in only one asset. 
5:153:11441:21:20:108:525:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The simulations demonstrate the dual effect of matching in company stock, namely an 
5:154:11525:20:21:72:536:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:increase in the mean account balance and an increase in the variance of its distribution.  Perhaps 
5:155:11624:21:21:72:539:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:surprisingly, the simulated account balances for participants at retirement age indicate that given 
5:156:11724:21:20:72:515:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the historical equity premium, sufficiently risk-tolerant participants would prefer a plan that 
5:157:11820:20:21:72:505:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:offers a company stock match to a plan that offers an unrestricted match.  This preference 
5:158:11911:21:21:72:549:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:increases with the amount of other uncorrelated wealth (e.g., Social Security, home equity, etc.).     
5:159:12014:21:20:108:539:108:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The preference for a plan at a firm with a company stock match rather than at a firm with 
5:160:12104:20:0:72:530:88:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:a choice match primarily reflects two factors.  First, firms that match with company stock have 
6:161:12201:0:20:72:530:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:lower stock price volatility and lower bankruptcy risk than firms with a choice match.  Second, 
6:162:12297:20:21:72:518:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:given participant behavior, the effect of a match in company stock is to increase the share of 
6:163:12392:21:21:72:505:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:assets held in equities and reduce the share in lower-yielding and lower-risk fixed-income 
6:164:12483:21:20:72:507:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:securities (e.g., money market funds and long-term bonds).  Naturally, the assumed equity 
6:165:12573:20:21:72:535:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:premium plays a key role in assessing the preference for a match in company stock.  Imposing a 
6:166:12668:21:21:72:520:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:four-percentage point reduction in the equity premium, i.e., cutting the historical premium in 
6:167:12763:21:20:72:493:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:half, significantly reduces the risk aversion level at which participants would prefer the 
6:168:12854:20:21:72:465:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:distribution of outcomes under a company stock match to an unrestricted match.   
6:169:12935:21:21:107:484:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:A company stock match is also generally preferred to an unrestricted match if 
6:170:13013:21:21:72:518:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participants do not diversify their own contributions (i.e., do not adopt the 1/n strategy).  For 
6:171:13111:21:20:72:522:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:example, when the match is in company stock, participants who would otherwise concentrate 
6:172:13201:20:21:72:512:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:their own and their employer’s contributions in a fixed-income security (e.g., stick with the 
6:173:13295:21:21:72:528:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:default investment option which is typically a money market fund) obtain equity exposure and 
6:174:13388:21:20:72:486:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:gain from diversification that they would otherwise not receive.  On the other hand, if 
6:175:13476:20:21:72:530:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participants would otherwise concentrate their investments in a small-cap equity fund, then the 
6:176:13572:21:21:72:509:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company stock match has little to offer in terms of higher expected returns from additional 
6:177:13664:21:20:71:509:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:exposure to equities but exposes the individual to more idiosyncratic risk.  In this case, the 
6:178:13759:20:21:71:448:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:distribution of account balances is less favorable to the company stock match. 
6:179:13838:21:21:107:535:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:These simulations provide several interesting insights into the effect of a company stock 
6:180:13928:21:20:71:536:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:match on retirement wealth.  Although we find that one reason for the desirability of a company 
6:181:14024:20:21:71:524:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stock match is the greater holdings of equities that results, this finding is not meant to suggest 
6:182:14123:21:21:71:525:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that matching with company stock is the best way to increase 401(k) participants’ exposure to 
6:183:14217:21:21:71:529:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:equities.  That is, the company stock match does not yield a mean-variance efficient portfolio.  
6:184:14314:21:20:72:519:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Rather, it improves a participant’s distribution of retirement wealth if his portfolio otherwise 
6:185:14411:20:21:72:529:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:would have had too little invested in stock, either because he followed a 1/n investment rule or 
6:186:14508:21:21:71:539:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:because he concentrated his investments in a single fixed-income security. Neither do our results 
6:187:14606:21:20:71:535:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:indicate that workers would want firms that currently provide an unrestricted match to switch to 
6:188:14703:20:21:71:536:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:requiring that employer contributions be in company stock.  Indeed, the significantly higher risk 
6:189:14801:21:21:71:520:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of firms that offer an unrestricted match would substantially increase the variance of account 
6:190:14896:21:20:71:528:108:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:balances if these firms were to switch match policy, and only the most risk-tolerant employees 
6:191:14991:20:0:71:531:88:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:would be better off from such a change.  Overall, the results of our simulations suggest that the 
7:192:15090:0:20:72:538:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:preference for a plan at a company that matches with company stock depends importantly on the 
7:193:15184:20:21:72:516:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:lower risk of firms that provide such a match.  Further, since firms do not have incentives to 
7:194:15279:21:21:72:532:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:guide participants to equities other than company stock, the equity exposure obtained through a 
7:195:15375:21:20:72:520:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company stock match, while inefficient, may be better than the alternative asset composition 
7:196:15468:20:21:72:514:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:under a choice match, particularly if participants stick with low-yielding default investment 
7:197:15562:21:21:72:333:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:options (Choi, Laibson, Madrian, and Metrick, 2001).

7:215:17032:21:20:72:531:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:largest number of firms, 635, in 1998.  On average, there are 3.4 observations per firm, with 42 
7:216:17129:20:21:72:507:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percent of the firms with 2 observations or less and 58 percent of the firms with 3 or more 
7:217:17221:21:21:71:515:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:observations.  The information provided on the 11-k is in accordance with ERISA reporting 
7:218:17311:21:20:71:511:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:guidelines.  In 1999, there was a change in ERISA reporting requirements that led to fewer 
7:219:17402:20:21:71:522:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:companies reporting contributions by asset category, leaving us with contribution data for far 
7:220:17497:21:20:71:303:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:fewer plans in 1999 and 2000 than in 1998.

7:222:17595:8:16:72:541:101:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:5 11-k filings are available on the SEC’s Edgar website starting in 1994.  The 1994 filing reports plan activity during 
7:223:17715:16:11:71:536:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:1993.  Some firms will report not only plan activity during the past year, but plan activity over the past three years.  
7:224:17836:11:0:71:353:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:Thus, we have 174 observations in 1992 and 49 observations in 1991.

8:230:18294:21:21:108:522:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:To characterize our sample, we focus on firms in the sample in 1998, one of the more 
8:231:18379:21:20:72:506:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:recent years with the largest number of firms.  As shown in table 2a, about one-half of the 
8:232:18471:20:21:72:522:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sample was a member of the S&P 1500 during 1998.6  Thus, the typical firm in our sample is 
8:233:18562:21:21:72:529:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:smaller, measured by both market value and employees, than the typical S&P 1500 firm, but is 
8:234:18655:21:21:72:507:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:larger than the average of all public companies, as available from Compustat.  The sample 
8:235:18745:21:20:72:534:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:represents a broad cross-section of industries.  As noted in the table, 15 percent of the sample is 
8:236:18845:20:21:72:382:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in the technology sector, somewhat less than the overall market. 
8:237:18910:21:21:108:532:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Companies that issue shares for their retirement plan, rather than purchase shares on the 
8:238:19000:21:20:71:519:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:open market, are required to file an 11-k.  This raises the possibility that the sample could be 
8:239:19097:20:21:72:511:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:biased toward firms that do not repurchase stock.  While data on plans that exclusively buy 
8:240:19189:21:21:72:527:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:shares on the open market for the plan are not publicly available, we are able to document that 
8:241:19285:21:20:72:513:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:repurchase activity by firms in our sample does not differ from that at other publicly-traded 
8:242:19379:20:21:72:523:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:firms.7  Specifically, we find that roughly half of the firms in the sample repurchased stock in 
8:243:19476:21:21:72:527:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:1998 (just evidently not in conjunction with their retirement plan), and as shown in the bottom 
8:244:19572:21:20:72:538:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:row of table 2a, the share repurchase yield (an estimate of the fraction of shares repurchased) for 
8:245:19672:20:21:72:494:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f5:B:the sample was 1.8 percent in 1998, similar to the yield for the S&P 1500 and all firms. 
8:246:19760:21:21:108:519:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:We also compare our sample of plans to those at publicly-traded firms as reported on

8:248:19938:21:20:72:511:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:companies in 1998, total plan assets were $264 billion, representing 38 percent of the $698 
8:249:20030:20:21:71:495:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:billion in plan assets at all publicly-traded companies (table 2b).  Total contributions by 
8:250:20122:21:21:71:528:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participant and company for our sample totaled $15.2 billion, just over 30 percent of the $49.2 
8:251:20218:21:15:71:541:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:billion for publicly traded firms.   Estimates from the DOL for 1998 for all US companies, public

8:255:20498:7:16:72:529:124:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:7 In the uncommon event that the plan does not allow employees to purchase stock but does provide the employer 
8:256:20609:16:11:71:542:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:match in company stock , it would generally not be deemed an offer of securities, and the plan would not be required 
8:257:20726:11:7:71:534:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:to file.  In our discussion with SEC staff, the onus is on the company to determine whether it needs to file an 11-k.  
8:258:20845:7:16:72:531:90:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:8 Publicly-traded companies in the DOL Form 5500 data set were identified by whether they had a CUSIP, and by 
8:259:20955:16:0:71:236:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:matching EINs with those in Compustat. 
9:260:20995:0:20:72:427:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and private, are $1.54 trillion in assets and $135 billion in contributions.   
9:261:21074:20:21:72:483:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: For our sample of 635 companies in 1998, company stock totaled $97 billion, 
9:262:21150:21:21:72:537:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:representing 37 percent of plan assets.  One-third of total participant and employer contributions 
9:263:21249:21:20:72:535:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:were allocated to company stock (employees in aggregate contributed one-quarter of participant 
9:264:21344:20:21:72:517:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:contributions to company stock).  The DOL 5500 data indicate that at public companies, the 
9:265:21435:21:21:72:524:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:share of defined contribution plan assets held in company stock was 39 percent, similar to the 
9:266:21530:21:20:72:520:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:share for our sample.  Thus, our sample represents two-fifths of 401(k)-type plan assets at all 
9:267:21626:20:21:72:507:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:publicly traded companies in 1998, and the fraction of assets invested in company stock is 
9:268:21717:21:21:72:302:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:similar to that of all publicly traded companies.

9:271:21818:20:21:72:428:481:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:C:A.  Summary Statistics Regarding the Employer Match in Company Stock 
9:272:21887:21:21:108:514:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:As noted in the first row of table 3, 39.3 percent of the 3,179 firm-year observations 
9:273:21974:21:20:72:505:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:required that the entire employer match be in company stock, comparable to the one-third 
9:274:22063:20:21:72:518:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:reported by the Profit Sharing / 401(k) Council of America (2002).9  Such a requirement has 
9:275:22155:21:21:72:530:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:substantial consequences because, for a typical employee who contributes six percent of salary 
9:276:22250:21:20:71:531:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and receives a match of $0.50 per dollar up to this limit, the match would account for one-third 
9:277:22347:20:21:71:533:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of the total (employee plus employer) contributions.  However, match policy has an even larger 
9:278:22442:21:21:71:536:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:effect because employees respond to a match in company stock by boosting their own voluntary 
9:279:22535:21:20:71:536:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:purchases, perhaps because they interpret the employer match as implicit investment advice that 
9:280:22631:20:21:71:517:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company stock is a good investment.  Rows 2 through 8 of table 3 assess the effect of match 
9:281:22723:21:21:71:441:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:policy upon the concentration of company stock holdings in 401(k) plans.     
9:282:22800:21:21:107:532:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:In row 2 of table 3, we show that, in our sample, participants at firms with the employer 
9:283:22890:21:20:71:511:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:match in company stock allocated 9.5 percentage points more of their own contributions to 
9:284:22980:20:21:71:526:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company stock.  Thus, after factoring in the match, participants at firms with a company stock 
9:285:23075:21:21:71:537:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:match had on average 45.5 percent of their total annual contributions being invested in company 
9:286:23171:21:20:71:526:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stock, compared to 17 percent at firms with an unrestricted match (row 3).  This large share of 
9:287:23267:20:21:71:517:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:contributions allocated to company stock is not simply because of the match requirement, as 
9:288:23359:21:32:71:510:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:required purchases of company stock at these companies are on average 28 percent of total 
9:289:23449:32:7:71:219:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
9:290:23497:7:16:72:530:90:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:9 Firms rarely change their match policy, as only 41 of 946 firms switched from an all company stock match to an 
9:291:23610:16:0:71:306:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:unrestricted match or vice versa during the sample period. 
10:292:23670:0:20:72:508:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:annual contributions, or only three-fifths of the observed company stock purchases.10  The 
10:293:23761:20:21:72:533:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:annual contributions appear to translate into similarly-concentrated asset holdings:  as shown in 
10:294:23859:21:21:72:501:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:row 5, the percent of plan assets held in company stock averaged 42 percent at firms that 
10:295:23949:21:20:72:466:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f5:B:matched in company stock, versus 18 percent at firms with an unrestricted match. 
10:296:24029:20:21:108:530:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A: In addition, the size of the employer match relative to employee contributions does not 
10:297:24118:21:21:72:519:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:differ substantially across firms by match policy.  In row 6 of table 3, we see that the ratio of 
10:298:24216:21:20:72:530:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employer to employee contributions averages 46 percent at firms that match in company stock, 
10:299:24309:20:21:72:535:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and 53 percent at firms with an unrestricted match, but the difference is not significant.  Median 
10:300:24408:21:21:72:532:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:ratios show a similar pattern, 37 and 40 percent respectively, with the difference significant but 
10:301:24507:21:21:72:129:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:not large.    
10:302:24521:21:20:72:493:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Rows 7 and 8 show that, as expected, firms that match in company stock have a 
10:303:24599:20:21:72:522:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:significantly higher fraction of their total outstanding shares held inside the 401(k) plan.  The 
10:304:24697:21:21:72:542:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:amount of company stock held inside the 401(k) plan at company stock match firms averaged 4.5 
10:305:24791:21:20:72:539:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percent, exceeding that for choice match firms by 2.9 percentage points.  The annual purchase of 
10:306:24888:20:21:72:528:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company stock via employee and employer contributions represented nearly 0.6 percent of the 
10:307:24980:21:21:72:513:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:shares of company stock match firms.  Within 401(k) plans of firms that match in company 
10:308:25069:21:20:72:500:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stock, the number of shares held in the plans is comparable to the number of outstanding 
10:309:25158:20:21:72:535:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employee stock options held by non-executives, as reported in Core and Guay (2001) and Liang 
10:310:25251:21:21:72:529:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and Weisbenner (2001).  This suggests that when studying stock-based compensation to lower-
10:311:25342:21:20:72:514:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:level employees, incorporating stock received through the pension plan could be important. 
10:312:25433:20:21:108:513:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The difference in the amount of stock held in 401(k) plans across match policy is of 
10:313:25518:21:21:72:522:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:sufficient magnitude to help deter hostile takeover attempts.  Shivdasani (1993) finds that the 
10:314:25614:21:21:72:525:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:probability of a hostile takeover is significantly lower when a greater share of stock is held by 
10:315:25712:21:20:72:499:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:affiliated stockholders (i.e., family trusts, company retirement plans, etc.); differences in 
10:316:25806:20:21:72:516:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:ownership of affiliated holders amounted to four percentage points, 3.2 percent at firms that 
10:317:25900:21:21:72:531:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:received a hostile takeover bid compared to 7.3 percent at firms that were not subject to a bid.   
10:318:25999:21:20:108:502:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:In row 9 we see that firms that offer a company stock match also tend to offer, on 
10:319:26082:20:30:72:527:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:average, one fewer investment option to their plan participants.  To the extent that participants

10:321:26228:7:16:72:508:113:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:10 The percent of total contributions required to be in company stock is non-zero for some firms that offer an 
10:322:26339:16:12:72:536:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:employer 401(k) match with choice because in addition to the unrestricted 401(k) plan, these firms may also have a 
10:323:26454:12:11:72:518:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:small profit sharing plan that when triggered (e.g., company profit targets are met) provides the employee with 
10:324:26566:11:0:72:434:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:company stock.  Less than 10 percent of choice match firms offer such an additional plan. 
11:325:26657:0:20:72:506:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:follow naïve diversification rules (i.e., follow “1/n” behavior), this would lead to a greater 
11:326:26752:20:21:72:347:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:investment of employee contributions in company stock. 
11:327:26807:21:21:72:538:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: In rows 10 though 15, we provide data on the number of participants in the plans, as well 
11:328:26897:21:20:72:514:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:as the size of account balances and the amount of contributions per participant.  Data on the 
11:329:26991:20:21:72:514:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:number of plan participants was collected by matching the 11-k sample with the DOL 5500 
11:330:27079:21:21:72:522:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:forms.  We were able to obtain participant data for 906 of the 1232 plans for 1997 and 1998.  
11:331:27173:21:20:72:529:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The plans that match in company stock are typically larger than those that offer an unrestricted 
11:332:27270:20:21:72:531:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:match, as measured by the number of participants (row 10), with the fraction of total firm-wide 
11:333:27366:21:21:72:527:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employees covered by the 401(k) plan averaging about two-thirds for both types of firms (row 
11:334:27459:21:21:72:535:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:11).  Total employee contributions per participant are roughly $300 per year higher at firms that 
11:335:27557:21:20:72:532:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:match in company stock relative to those that do not (average employee contributions of $3100 
11:336:27651:20:21:72:526:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and $2800, respectively, row 12), while the employer contributions are roughly the same (row 
11:337:27744:21:21:72:525:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:13).  Average account balances per participant at company stock match firms are significantly 
11:338:27838:21:20:72:522:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:greater than balances at choice match firms ($60,600 and $43,220, respectively, row 14), and 
11:339:27931:20:21:71:534:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company stock holdings are higher by nearly $20,000 at company stock match firms (row 15).   
11:340:28024:21:21:72:391:398:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:C:B.  The Costs and Benefits of Offering a Match in Company Stock 
11:341:28088:21:20:108:536:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The decision by a firm to provide a match in company stock involves a tradeoff between 
11:342:28175:20:21:72:541:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:a number of costs and benefits.  There are two related reasons that providing a match in company 
11:343:28272:21:21:72:492:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stock may be costly for a firm.  First, elementary portfolio theory makes it clear that an 
11:344:28363:21:20:72:513:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:optimizing agent should prefer a diversified portfolio to one that is highly concentrated in a 
11:345:28458:20:21:72:529:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:single asset.  Rational employees would recognize that a match in company stock substantially 
11:346:28552:21:21:72:536:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:increases the concentration of assets and therefore the volatility of their future retirement wealth 
11:347:28653:21:21:72:531:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and, as a result, would value a match in company stock less than a match in cash, which allows 
11:348:28748:21:20:72:525:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:them to diversify their portfolio.11  If the company stock match is not fully valued, companies 
11:349:28844:20:21:72:470:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:might need to provide a larger match than if it were made in cash or increase other 
11:350:28928:21:21:72:482:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:compensation.  Second, firms might be concerned that in the case of poor stock price 
11:351:29013:21:50:72:506:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:performance, the plan sponsor could be considered by the courts to be in violation of their 
11:352:29105:50:7:72:219:120:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
11:353:29153:7:16:72:533:113:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:11 It is worth noting that there are some tax advantages to employees for holding company stock versus other stock 
11:354:29268:16:12:72:537:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:in 401(k) plans (Iwry, 2003).  Company stock withdrawn from a 401(k) plan is not taxed until the stock is sold, and 
11:355:29384:12:11:72:536:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:then at long-term capital gains rates.  In contrast, other stock holdings are taxed at typically higher ordinary income 
11:356:29504:11:0:72:178:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:tax rates at withdrawal.     
12:357:29535:0:20:72:439:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:fiduciary responsibilities if they had provided a match in company stock.12   
12:358:29613:20:21:108:525:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:To the extent that these potential costs are important to the firm, one might expect that 
12:359:29703:21:21:71:534:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:less risky firms (i.e., lower stock price volatility and/or a lower bankruptcy rate) would be more 
12:360:29802:21:20:72:538:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:likely to match with company stock because the additional risk imposed on workers is lower.  In 
12:361:29898:20:21:72:528:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:addition, a firm might not be as concerned about these costs if it also provides other retirement 
12:362:29996:21:21:72:541:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:benefits, such as a defined benefit (DB) plan, which reduces the importance of 401(k) plan assets 
12:363:30094:21:20:72:504:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for financial security.  In particular, the presence of a DB plan means that the 401(k) plan 
12:364:30187:20:21:72:501:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participants also have an additional asset that is largely uncorrelated with company stock 
12:365:30278:21:21:72:532:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:performance, because DB plans are prohibited by ERISA to have more than ten percent of plan 
12:366:30370:21:21:72:536:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:assets invested in company stock.  In addition, DB plans, unlike 401(k) plans, are insured by the 
12:367:30468:21:20:72:531:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC).  While the benefits from DB plans are at some 
12:368:30559:20:21:72:528:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:risk if the company fails because of the fact that DB benefits are back-loaded and the PBGC is 
12:369:30654:21:21:71:530:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:responsible for obligations incurred only up to the time at which the firm fails, the provision of 
12:370:30753:21:20:71:512:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:these benefits mitigates the risk to retirement wealth from a high concentration in company 
12:371:30845:20:21:71:533:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stock.13  Thus, firms that provide DB plans, as well as firms that have less risky stock, may feel 
12:372:30944:21:21:72:408:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:less constrained in providing the employer match in company stock.   
12:373:31013:21:20:108:541:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Firms must trade off these costs with several potential benefits to the firm from providing 
12:374:31105:20:21:72:514:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the employer match to 401(k) plans in company stock.  A direct benefit that all firms would 
12:375:31197:21:21:72:521:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:achieve is a cost reduction, because administrative fees for company stock are negligible and 
12:376:31291:21:20:72:524:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:considerably less than fees associated with providing other investment options, such as equity 
12:377:31386:20:21:72:523:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and bond mutual funds.  There are also other potential benefits to matching in company stock 
12:378:31479:21:21:72:326:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that likely vary across firms, which we now discuss. 
12:379:31532:21:21:108:521:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:First, it may be cheaper for a firm to issue stock to fund its 401(k) match than to raise 
12:380:31622:21:20:72:526:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:funds from outside investors to provide an unrestricted match, perhaps because of asymmetric 
12:381:31715:20:21:72:535:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:information (Myers and Majluf, 1984).  This argument would predict that firms with less excess 
12:382:31810:21:21:72:540:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:cash flow and greater asymmetric information would be more likely to offer a match in company 
12:383:31904:21:20:72:541:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stock, consistent with the use of stock options (Core and Guay, 2001).  Low cash flow firms may 
12:384:32000:20:16:72:525:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:also be more likely to match in company stock because of less ability to raise funds via debt.   
12:385:32097:16:8:72:219:134:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
12:386:32145:8:18:72:512:126:64:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:12 Section 404(c) of ERISA generally relieves employers from liability for fiduciary error when the employer 
12:387:32253:18:11:71:521:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:permits participants to exercise control over their retirement plan accounts.  If a firm requires the match to be in 
12:388:32370:11:7:71:440:97:100:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company stock, however, the safe harbor provisions may no longer apply (Purcell, 2002).  
12:389:32457:7:16:72:518:90:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:13 There is also a statutory limit on the amount of benefits that the PBGC can guarantee.  For plans with a 2004 
12:390:32570:16:0:72:502:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:termination date, the maximum guarantee is just under $45,000 annually for a single life annuity at age 65. 
13:391:32680:0:20:108:510:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Second, for firms that pay dividends, there is a tax advantage to firms that match in 
13:392:32766:20:21:72:537:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company stock.  Any contribution to a 401(k) plan, whether paid in cash or in company stock, is 
13:393:32862:21:21:72:525:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:initially deductible from corporate income taxes.  However, by making the contribution in the 
13:394:32956:21:20:72:543:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:form of company stock, a dividend paying firm may be able to “double dip” by receiving a future 
13:395:33052:20:21:72:508:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:tax deduction for all dividends paid on shares held within the plan in addition to the initial 
13:396:33147:21:21:72:538:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:deduction for the value of the shares themselves.  Specifically, while dividends paid on stock are 
13:397:33246:21:20:72:498:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:not usually tax deductible, if firms contribute the employer match in company stock to a 
13:398:33335:20:21:72:522:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:leveraged employee stock ownership plan (ESOP), dividends paid on that stock to repay debt 
13:399:33426:21:21:72:537:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:may be tax-deductible (Beatty, 1995; Schultz and Francis, 2002; Iwry, 2003).14  Recent business 
13:400:33522:21:21:72:534:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:press cites that such tax savings may be significant for some firms (Schultz and Francis, 2002).  
13:401:33620:21:20:72:532:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:We test for the importance of this tax advantage by looking at whether a firm’s dividend policy 
13:402:33716:20:21:72:358:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:helps to explain the likelihood of a company stock match.   
13:403:33776:21:21:108:522:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Third, a company stock match likely leads to a greater share of the firm being held by 
13:404:33863:21:20:72:529:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employees.  Recall that the average percent of total company stock held in the 401(k) plan was 
13:405:33958:20:21:72:542:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:three times higher for firms that match in company stock relative to those that do not (4.5 percent 
13:406:34058:21:21:72:530:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and 1.6 percent, respectively).  There are several potential advantages of this, including having 
13:407:34156:21:20:71:530:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stock in “friendly hands” to help protect the firm from hostile takeovers (Rauh, 2003).  We test 
13:408:34253:20:21:72:536:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for this motive by examining whether firms that have multiple classes of stock, and thus already 
13:409:34350:21:21:72:540:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:have a mechanism to thwart takeovers or protect managerial wealth in a takeover (DeAngelo and

13:411:34537:20:21:72:541:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:mandate holdings of company stock because of the perceived benefits from aligning workers and 
13:412:34631:21:21:72:536:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stakeholders’ interests (Jensen and Meckling, 1976; Demsetz and Lehn, 1985; Smith and Watts, 
13:413:34724:21:21:72:542:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:1992).  Firms with greater monitoring difficulties, as measured by number of employees (Lazear, 
13:414:34820:21:20:72:539:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:1979 and 1983), or greater noise in the operating environment, as measured by idiosyncratic risk 
13:415:34917:20:21:72:538:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(Demsetz and Lehn, 1985), might benefit more from aligning incentives.  In addition, firms with 
13:416:35012:21:21:72:522:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:a larger value in growth opportunities and intangible assets may benefit more from employee 
13:417:35104:21:20:72:509:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stock ownership due to the asymmetric information between insiders (i.e., employees) and 
13:418:35193:20:21:72:531:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:outside shareholders (Holmstrom and Milgrom, 1987).  As applied to our question, their model 
13:419:35286:21:20:72:540:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:would predict that firms with higher market-to-book ratios would be more likely to offer a match 
13:420:35383:20:8:72:219:109:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
13:421:35431:8:16:72:529:101:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:14 While this benefit is not likely to encourage dividend payments, since most stock is held outside of ESOP plans 
13:422:35546:16:11:72:534:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:and so is subject to double taxation, the benefit could encourage companies that already pay dividends to provide a 
13:423:35662:11:0:72:407:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:401(k) employer match in company stock in order to qualify for this deduction.

14:426:35860:21:21:108:531:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:We are interested in determining empirically which of these potential costs and benefits 
14:427:35949:21:20:71:517:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:are most relevant to the firm’s decision about whether to offer their match in company stock 
14:428:36042:20:21:71:527:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:versus cash.  In addition to the general academic interest of this question, knowing the relative 
14:429:36140:21:21:72:438:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:importance of these factors is crucial for guiding public policy in this area.   
14:430:36221:21:20:108:520:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:As shown in appendix table 1, firms that match in company stock generally have less 
14:431:36305:20:21:72:520:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:volatile stock prices and idiosyncratic risk and are considerably more likely to also sponsor a 
14:432:36401:21:21:72:520:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:defined benefit plan, have an investment-grade debt rating, pay dividends, and have multiple 
14:433:36494:21:21:72:486:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:classes of stock.  To assess the quantitative importance of these factors and other firm 
14:434:36583:21:20:72:533:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:characteristics in explaining firm match policy, and thus disentangle the alternative hypotheses, 
14:435:36681:20:21:72:542:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:table 4 presents coefficient estimates from a regression of match policy upon these firm attributes 
14:436:36781:21:21:72:515:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:one at a time (columns 1 to 10).15  Because many of these firm characteristics are correlated 
14:437:36875:21:20:72:465:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(appendix table 2), we then turn to a multivariate analysis (column 11 of table 4). 
14:438:36959:20:21:108:529:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:As shown in column 1, whether the firm already provides retirement benefits through a 
14:439:37045:21:21:72:528:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:defined benefit plan appears to be very important.16  The estimated effect is positive and large, 
14:440:37143:21:20:72:502:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:suggesting that firms that have a defined benefit plan are substantially more likely, by 22 
14:441:37235:20:21:72:532:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percentage points, to require the match to be in company stock.  To put the size of this effect in 
14:442:37334:21:21:72:521:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:perspective, recall that in the sample, 39 percent of firms require the match to be in company 
14:443:37429:21:20:72:530:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stock.  Our interpretation of this result is that the provision of retirement benefits through a DB 
14:444:37529:20:21:72:532:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:plan significantly mitigates the risk to employee retirement wealth of having 401(k) plan assets 
14:445:37626:21:21:72:504:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:concentrated in company stock.  In addition, columns 2 and 3 show a significant negative 
14:446:37715:21:21:72:521:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:relationship between stock price volatility and the probability of matching in company stock, 
14:447:37809:21:20:72:509:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:also suggesting that employers consider the effect of match policy on employee retirement 
14:448:37899:20:21:72:509:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:wealth.  Similarly, firms with an investment-grade bond rating, as gauged by Standard and 
14:449:37989:21:21:72:538:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Poor’s, are 18 percentage points more likely to require the match in company stock (column 4).   
14:450:38086:21:20:108:500:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:We find no direct evidence that cash constraints are an important factor in setting 
14:451:38170:20:16:72:512:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employer match policy (column 5), as there is no direct correlation between cash flow (i.e., 
14:452:38263:16:7:72:219:134:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
14:453:38311:7:18:72:491:127:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:15 We estimate a linear regression to provide an easy-to-interpret estimate of the marginal effects of firm 
14:454:38419:18:8:72:430:109:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:characteristics on the choice of match policy.  A Probit model yields very similar results. 
14:455:38510:8:16:72:533:101:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:16 One could envision a scenario in which firms face the choice of offering a 401(k) plan with a match in employer 
14:456:38625:16:11:72:537:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:stock or a defined benefit plan as alternative means to tie the worker to the firm.  In our sample, however, DB plans 
14:457:38743:11:0:72:515:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:have been in place for some time and so we are not concerned with potential endogeneity of the DB variable.   
15:458:38855:0:20:72:541:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:operating income before depreciation) and match policy.  To explore this relationship further, we 
15:459:38953:20:21:72:535:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:split the sample into firms by whether cash flow is positive or negative, allowing the coefficient 
15:460:39052:21:21:71:537:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:on cash flow to vary across these two types of firms.17  For the small segment of the sample (3.5 
15:461:39150:21:20:71:524:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percent) that has negative cash flow, we find that the probability of a match in company stock 
15:462:39245:20:21:71:534:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:increases as cash flow decreases (i.e., the coefficient is negative), suggesting some role for cash 
15:463:39345:21:21:71:531:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:constraints for a select minority of firms.  However, because only a small portion of the sample 
15:464:39442:21:20:71:535:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:has negative cash flow, these results should be interpreted cautiously.  Moreover, if cash flow is 
15:465:39541:20:21:71:507:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:positive, the coefficient estimate is positive, indicating that higher cash flow increases the 
15:466:39636:21:21:71:528:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:likelihood of a company stock match.  The point estimates for these cash flow variables do not 
15:467:39731:21:21:71:522:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:change much when other firm attributes are added, with the coefficient for positive cash flow 
15:468:39825:21:20:71:518:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:firms remaining significantly positive.  Ceteris paribus, more profitable firms matching with 
15:469:39919:20:21:71:534:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company stock runs counter to what we would expect if companies matched with stock because 
15:470:40010:21:21:71:434:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:they were cash constrained and so had no other means to make a match.18   
15:471:40084:21:20:108:533:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The tax-based motivation to match in company stock if dividends are paid appears to be 
15:472:40171:20:21:72:527:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:somewhat important.  Coefficient estimates suggest that a one percentage point increase in the 
15:473:40266:21:21:72:530:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:dividend yield is associated with a 3.3 percentage point increase in the probability that a firm’s 
15:474:40365:21:20:72:539:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:match is all company stock (the sample average is 39 percent).  This variable, however, is highly 
15:475:40463:20:21:72:507:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:correlated with measures of firm risk and the presence of a DB plan, and thus the estimate 
15:476:40554:21:21:72:540:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:becomes less precisely measured and actually flips sign once these other variables are included.   
15:477:40653:21:20:108:506:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The evidence is mixed concerning motivations to boost employee ownership.  The 
15:478:40732:20:21:72:529:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:market-to-book ratio, a proxy for the presence of growth opportunities and intangible assets, is 
15:479:40829:21:21:72:541:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:not significant, while the coefficient on log(employees) is only marginally significant on its own, 
15:480:40929:21:21:72:517:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with the coefficient flipping signs in the multivariate specification.  Thus, the desire to align 
15:481:41027:21:20:71:511:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:incentives and/or better monitor employees, as proxied for by these two variables, does not 
15:482:41119:20:21:71:353:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:appear to be important factors in explaining match policy. 
15:483:41178:21:21:107:541:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Finally, the effect of multiple classes of stock is compelling, decreasing the probability of 
15:484:41272:21:27:71:530:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:a match by 17 percentage points.  This result is consistent with the presence of multiple classes 
15:485:41370:27:7:71:219:143:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
15:486:41418:7:12:72:536:136:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:17 We also examined excess cash flow (cash flow less capital expenditures) and found qualitatively similar results.   
15:487:41536:12:16:72:536:124:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:18 This is not to say that cash flow is not an important determinant of whether a firm offers a 401(k) plan or a match 
15:488:41655:16:11:72:523:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:at all, but only that it is not an important determinant of the type of match that is provided.  Surveys suggest that 
15:489:41773:11:12:72:528:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:cash flow constraints are an important determinant of providing 401(k) benefits to employees (see Department of 
15:490:41885:12:11:72:541:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:Labor, 2001), and studies have identified cash flow constraints as an important factor for terminating defined benefit 
15:491:42004:11:0:72:240:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:pension plans (see e.g., Petersen, 1992).

16:493:42146:20:21:72:521:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:substitutes in preventing unwanted takeover attempts.  While the estimated effect of multiple 
16:494:42240:21:21:72:535:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:classes of stock is little changed, the coefficient loses significance in the multivariate regression 
16:495:42342:21:20:71:161:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(p-value = 0.17).   
16:496:42362:20:21:107:498:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Because these variables are highly correlated, as discussed earlier, some of these 
16:497:42445:21:21:71:521:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:variables lose significance when all firm characteristics are included simultaneously (column 
16:498:42539:21:20:72:526:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:11).  This specification also includes dummy variables for whether the firm went public in the

16:500:42726:21:21:72:526:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:variables for the firm’s two-digit SIC industry classification (the sample spans 66 distinct two-

16:504:43100:21:21:72:510:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:while the industry variables loosely control for differences in worker characteristics across 
16:505:43194:21:20:72:489:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:industries that may influence pension plan design.  Only the presence of a DB plan, an

16:512:43856:20:21:71:538:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:specification).19  On balance, the coefficients suggest that firms may be concerned about the risk 
16:513:43955:21:21:72:525:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of company stock in retirement portfolios and provide the match in company stock only when 
16:514:44046:21:21:72:539:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employees have a fall-back retirement plan or when the firm is less likely to experience financial 
16:515:44145:21:20:72:516:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:distress.  It is also consistent with the idea that these firms may view themselves as having a 
16:516:44241:20:21:71:540:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:lower risk of being considered a poor fiduciary, and thus be more willing to restrict the employer 
16:517:44340:21:21:71:200:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:match to company stock.   
16:518:44366:21:27:107:519:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:In summary, our evidence suggests that companies are primarily trading off a greater

16:520:44499:7:16:72:498:136:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:19 While the inclusion of the firm age and industry indicator variables does not affect the magnitude of the 
16:521:44608:16:12:72:529:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:correlation between the presence of a DB plan and match policy, this is not to say that these variables do not have 
16:522:44724:12:11:72:529:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:their own independent effects upon match policy.  Both the firm age variables and the industry indicator variables 
16:523:44839:11:12:72:529:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:are significant, with p-values of 0.09 and 0.00, respectively.  For example, A firm that went public in the 1990s is 
16:524:44956:12:11:72:538:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:18.8 percentage point less likely to match with company stock than is a firm that went public in the 1970s or earlier, 
16:525:45075:11:0:72:542:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:and firms in the telecommunications, utilities, and retail trade industries are more apt to match with company stock.   
17:526:45197:0:20:72:531:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:share of stock in friendly hands and perhaps the benefits of the dividend tax advantage with the 
17:527:45294:20:21:72:507:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:recognition that a lack of diversification may be costly to employees.  Firms for which the 
17:528:45386:21:21:72:531:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:diversification costs to employees are low (i.e., those companies with low bankruptcy risk) and 
17:529:45482:21:20:72:533:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:firms that offer a DB plan are more likely to provide a company stock match.  The implications 
17:530:45577:20:21:72:529:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of the lower risk and other sources of retirement income for employee welfare are examined in 
17:531:45671:21:21:72:449:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:simulations of retirement wealth by match policy presented later in Section V.

17:533:45806:20:21:72:540:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Table 5 further explores one of our most robust findings, the role of the DB plan. The left

17:535:45995:21:21:72:541:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:plan if they also offer a DB plan (column 1, which replicates column 1 of table 4), but even more 
17:536:46093:21:20:72:500:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:so if the match they are offering is less generous as measured by the ratio of employer to 
17:537:46184:20:21:72:529:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employee contributions (columns 2 and 3).  For example, among firms that offer a DB plan, as 
17:538:46277:21:21:72:523:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the size of the match relative to employee contributions falls from 50 percent to 20 percent of 
17:539:46373:21:20:72:537:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employee contributions, and thus the share of match contributions in retirement wealth declines, 
17:540:46470:20:21:72:537:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the probability that the firm matches with company stock rises by about six percentage points.20  
17:541:46568:21:21:72:529:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:In contrast, the generosity of the match has no predictive power for match policy for firms that 
17:542:46665:21:20:72:536:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:do not offer a DB plan.  Thus, firms are more apt to match in company stock if they both offer a 
17:543:46762:20:21:72:513:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:defined benefit pension and provide a less generous match, perhaps because firms take into 
17:544:46853:21:21:72:534:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:account the effect of match policy on the retirement security of plan participants, either due to a 
17:545:46953:21:20:72:533:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:lower risk of the plan sponsor being considered in violation if its fiduciary responsibility or due 
17:546:47053:20:21:72:534:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to simple market forces (i.e., employees at riskier firms without DB plans are less likely to fully 
17:547:47153:21:21:72:242:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:value a match in company stock).   
17:548:47188:21:21:108:489:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:One concern about the interpretation of the DB coefficient is whether the same 
17:549:47267:21:20:72:525:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employees are covered by both the DB and the 401(k) plan, or if DB benefits apply only to an 
17:550:47360:20:21:72:538:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:earlier cohort of workers, while more recent hires are limited to participation in the 401(k) plan.  
17:551:47461:21:21:72:506:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Fortunately, in our sample of firms, DB benefits appear to apply largely to the same set of 
17:552:47553:21:20:72:527:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employees as those that contribute to 401(k) plans.  While there are no data available from the 
17:553:47649:20:21:72:526:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:11-k, 5500 form, or Compustat to establish the fraction of employees that are covered by both 
17:554:47743:21:21:72:542:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:types of plans, other data strongly suggest that it is the case.  In the aggregate, data from the 1998 
17:555:47846:21:22:72:538:108:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Survey of Consumer Finances indicate that of the roughly 40 million households with a member

17:557:47987:8:0:72:500:78:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:20 In the sample, the interquartile range for the ratio of employer to employee contributions is 0.28 to 0.58. 
18:558:48100:0:20:72:538:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that works at a firm with more than 500 employees and that is covered by a defined benefit plan, 
18:559:48197:20:21:72:531:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:62 percent of these workers also participate in a defined contribution (DC) plan.  Data from the 
18:560:48294:21:21:72:527:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:DOL 5500 data present roughly the same picture – 69 percent of wage and salary workers that 
18:561:48386:21:20:72:412:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f5:B:were covered by a DB plan also were covered by a DC plan in 1998.21 
18:562:48453:20:21:108:531:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:In the right panel of table 5 we focus attention on the subsample of firms over 1997 and 
18:563:48542:21:21:72:528:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:1998 that offer broad-based plans where it is likely that workers are covered both by a DC and 
18:564:48637:21:20:72:521:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:DB plan, if the firm offers both.  To construct this sample, we first obtain the number of plan 
18:565:48733:20:21:72:523:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participants from the DOL 5500 form and then compare this number with the number of total 
18:566:48823:21:21:72:537:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employees from Compustat.  If the number of participants in the DC plan and, in the cases when 
18:567:48918:21:21:72:537:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:it is offered as well, DB plan total at least 50 percent of total firm employees, then we define the 
18:568:49019:21:20:72:525:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:plan to be broad-based, and include the firm in the regression.22  Relative to the results for the 
18:569:49118:20:21:72:518:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:full sample (table 5, left panel), the estimated effect of the presence of a defined benefit plan 
18:570:49216:21:21:72:539:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:remains highly significant, with the point estimates little changed.  The results obtained with this 
18:571:49317:21:20:72:530:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:subsample of firms with broad-based plans support the conclusion that firms are more likely to 
18:572:49412:20:21:72:462:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:match in company stock when workers have alternative wealth in DB benefits.

18:574:49549:21:20:72:506:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: The Vanguard Group (2003) conducted a survey of 76 firms to ascertain employer 
18:575:49628:20:21:72:529:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:attitudes toward company stock in 401(k) plans.  The firms were asked whether they agreed or 
18:576:49721:21:21:72:511:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:disagreed with various statements concerning potential costs and benefits of matching with 
18:577:49812:21:20:72:541:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company stock in 401(k) plans.  Table 6 presents the results of the survey, with responses broken 
18:578:49910:20:21:72:538:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:down by whether the firm actually matches with company stock or allows choice.  The results of 
18:579:50005:21:21:72:517:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the survey are quite striking and are very consistent with our empirical findings.  Employers 
18:580:50099:21:21:72:512:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:seem to divide into two camps in terms of their beliefs regarding the costs and benefits of a 
18:581:50193:21:20:72:537:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:match in company stock.  Those that match in company stock feel less concern for the reduction 
18:582:50288:20:21:72:515:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in diversification for participant accounts and feel there is less risk that a match in company 
18:583:50384:21:21:72:528:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stock will be deemed a breach of fiduciary responsibility and result in a lawsuit.  These survey 
18:584:50481:21:20:72:527:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:responses are in keeping with the empirical findings that firms that match with company stock 
18:585:50575:20:21:72:542:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:are more apt to provide other sources of retirement income (i.e., a DB plan) and have lower stock 
18:586:50673:21:18:72:252:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:price volatility and bankruptcy risk.

18:589:50851:13:16:72:529:90:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:22 The 50 percent threshold is selected to assure there will be an overlap between workers covered by the DC plan 
18:590:50965:16:0:72:483:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:and those covered by the DB plan.  Regressions estimated with higher thresholds yield similar results. 
19:591:51070:0:20:108:529:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:On the benefits side, those that match with company stock are significantly more apt to 
19:592:51158:20:21:72:513:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:view having stock in friendly hands and promoting employee stock ownership as important 
19:593:51246:21:21:72:527:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:reasons for a company stock match.  The first survey response is consistent with our empirical 
19:594:51341:21:20:72:536:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:result that the presence of multiple classes of shares and boosting stock in “friendly hands” (i.e., 
19:595:51442:20:21:72:533:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:through a company stock match) are substitutes. However, we do not find empirical support for 
19:596:51536:21:21:72:529:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the notion that employers match in company stock because the company realizes benefits from 
19:597:51628:21:20:72:527:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:greater employee stock ownership.  Indeed, the Vanguard Group survey finds no difference in 
19:598:51720:20:21:72:532:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:self-reported motivational levels between surveyed employees that hold company stock in their

19:602:51902:20:21:108:537:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Given that on average the employer match represents about a third of total contributions, 
19:603:51992:21:21:72:504:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:a match in company stock forces employees to hold a substantial share of their retirement

19:605:52173:20:21:72:515:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:match leads employees to boost their own voluntary purchases of company stock.  Previous

19:607:52357:21:20:71:501:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with employees viewing a match in company stock as the firm’s implicit endorsement of 
19:608:52443:20:21:71:253:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company stock as a good investment.

19:612:52755:21:21:72:537:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:offered, a Guaranteed Investment Contract (GIC)), and all other investment options.  The results 
19:613:52852:21:21:72:492:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:are displayed in table 7.  When the employer match is in company stock, the percent of 
19:614:52939:21:20:72:528:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employees’ own contributions allocated to company stock are seven to eight percentage points 
19:615:53032:20:21:72:534:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:higher.  This boost in employee contributions to company stock comes disproportionately at the 
19:616:53127:21:21:71:499:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:expense of the safest asset; employees allocate three percentage points less to the money 
19:617:53217:21:20:71:539:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:market/GIC fund if the employer matches in company stock.  Thus, about two-fifths of the boost 
19:618:53312:20:21:71:537:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in company stock purchases comes from a reduction in contributions to the lowest-return asset.   
19:619:53409:21:21:108:506:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Consistent with Benartzi and Thaler (2001) and Liang and Weisbenner (2002), the 
19:620:53489:21:20:72:527:108:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:regressions indicate that 1/n is also a significant predictor of purchases across all asset classes, 
19:621:53590:20:0:72:529:88:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:where n is the number of investment alternatives.  Company stock purchases are also greater if 
20:622:53687:0:20:72:495:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stock price volatility is lower and the firm is larger, with the contributions to the money 
20:623:53779:20:21:72:345:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:market/GIC fund increasing with stock price volatility.   
20:624:53837:21:21:108:526:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The relation between asset returns and contribution decisions is in general fairly weak, 
20:625:53926:21:20:72:524:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with the minor exception of the effect of past Treasury bill returns.  For example, relative to a 
20:626:54024:20:21:72:539:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:firm with a zero stock return, a doubling of stock price over the past five years is associated with 
20:627:54125:21:21:72:505:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:only a 0.5 percentage point increase in the fraction of employee contributions allocated to 
20:628:54217:21:20:72:526:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company stock.  Past five-year Treasury bill returns are strongly positively correlated with the 
20:629:54314:20:21:72:522:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percent of employee contributions allocated to the money market/GIC fund, while negatively 
20:630:54405:21:21:72:433:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:related to contributions to company stock and all other investment options.

20:633:54550:20:21:72:529:481:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f3:B: Participants in plans that match with company stock end up with a highly undiversified 
20:634:54637:21:21:72:528:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:portfolio.  However, our empirical results also indicate that these employees are more likely to 
20:635:54734:21:20:72:510:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:work for firms that have lower idiosyncratic risk, lower bankruptcy risk, and provide other 
20:636:54826:20:21:72:511:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement income through defined benefit plans.  While a higher concentration of assets in 
20:637:54918:21:21:72:524:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company stock entails more risk, company stock has a higher expected return than most other 
20:638:55010:21:20:71:525:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:investment alternatives, especially money market and government bond funds.  As mentioned 
20:639:55100:20:21:71:514:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:earlier, past research finds that when making investments, employees invest consistent with 
20:640:55192:21:21:71:530:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:naïve 1/n diversification strategies, rarely rebalance plan assets, and tend to place more of their 
20:641:55292:21:20:71:527:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:own contributions in company stock if the match is provided in company stock.  As a result of 
20:642:55386:20:21:71:531:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:these many countervailing forces, the net effect of company match policy on the distribution of 
20:643:55482:21:21:71:512:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:possible retirement wealth levels is complex.  In this section, we use simulation methods to 
20:644:55575:21:21:71:451:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:compare the distribution of retirement wealth under alternative assumptions.    
20:645:55655:21:20:71:252:232:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:C:A.  Key Assumptions and Procedures 
20:646:55690:20:21:107:494:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:We assume that an individual begins contributing to a 401(k) plan at age 27 and 
20:647:55770:21:21:71:532:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:contributes six percent of wages annually until age 62.  The company matches this contribution 
20:648:55865:21:20:71:513:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:at a rate of 50 cents on the dollar, meaning that the company contributes an additional three 
20:649:55959:20:21:71:515:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percent of wages each year.  The individual’s lifetime wage path is taken from Munnell and 
20:650:56050:21:32:71:531:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Sunden (2003).23  In particular, wage growth is a composite of two factors.  The first is that the 
20:651:56149:32:7:71:219:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
20:652:56197:7:16:72:542:90:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:23 For more details on the calculation of the wage profiles, we refer readers to page 30 of Munnell & Sunden (2003).  
20:653:56315:16:0:72:473:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:We are grateful to these authors for providing us with the wage profiles for use in our simulations.   
21:654:56420:0:20:72:502:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:growth in real wages across the economy is assumed to be 1.1 percent annually, which is 
21:655:56508:20:21:72:528:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:consistent with projections of the Office of the Actuary of the Social Security Administration.  
21:656:56605:21:21:72:539:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:The second is an age-earnings profile based on career earnings profiles for men and women born 
21:657:56700:21:20:72:529:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:between 1926 and 1965.  Salary at age 50 is set to $44,000, which is the median wage for a 50-
21:658:56794:20:21:72:462:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:year old covered by a pension plan in the 2001 Survey of Consumer Finances.     
21:659:56874:21:21:108:532:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Consistent with our 11-k data, we assume that firms offer seven investment options (the 
21:660:56962:21:20:72:527:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:median number of options in our sample) – company stock, large-cap equities, money market, 
21:661:57053:20:21:72:534:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:long-term government bond, a balanced fund (which is invested in a monthly rebalanced mix of 
21:662:57146:21:21:72:523:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:50 percent stocks and 50 percent bonds), high-grade long-term corporate bond, and small-cap 
21:663:57238:21:21:72:535:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:equities.  Based on our results from table 7 and previous research findings (Benartzi and Thaler, 
21:664:57336:21:20:72:506:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:2001; Liang and Weisbenner, 2002), we assume initially that participants invest their own 
21:665:57426:20:21:72:507:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:contributions using a simple 1/n diversification heuristic.24  We also assume that when the 
21:666:57518:21:21:71:526:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company matches with cash, the individual invests the employer match in the same manner as 
21:667:57609:21:20:71:535:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:their own contributions.  In our base case simulation, we assume that the company’s decision to 
21:668:57705:20:21:71:527:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:match in company stock has no effect on an employee’s own contribution allocation, although 
21:669:57797:21:21:71:534:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:we alter this assumption in later specifications.  As such, for many of the simulations presented, 
21:670:57896:21:20:71:514:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the difference in annual purchases of alternative assets arises solely from a difference in the 
21:671:57992:20:21:71:534:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employer match.  These assumptions approximate the actual contribution data to money market 
21:672:58084:21:21:71:519:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:funds and company stock that we observe for these firms.  Consistent with previous research 
21:673:58176:21:20:72:530:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(Samuelson and Zeckhauser, 1988; Ameriks and Zeldes, 2001), we assume that participants do 
21:674:58267:20:21:72:541:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:not rebalance their accounts.  This assumption is also consistent with restrictions that many firms 
21:675:58367:21:21:72:540:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:had in place that did not allow participants to diversify out of employer match contributions until 
21:676:58467:21:21:72:307:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:certain age and service requirements were met.   
21:677:58516:21:20:108:519:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Specifically, our assumptions of 1/n and seven investment options lead to one-half of 
21:678:58602:20:21:72:537:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:annual employee and employer contributions directed toward equities and one-half toward fixed 
21:679:58696:21:21:72:539:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:income securities at firms that match in cash.  For firms that match in company stock, two-thirds 
21:680:58794:21:20:72:503:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:are directed toward equities and one-third toward fixed income.  Initially, we assume that 
21:681:58885:20:21:72:521:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participants do not alter their portfolio allocation when forced to receive a match in company 
21:682:58980:21:32:72:525:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stock, although we relax this assumption below.  As discussed below, these parameterizations 
21:683:59073:32:7:72:219:97:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
21:684:59121:7:16:72:532:90:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:24 In later simulations, we further consider the desirability of a match in company stock for participants that would 
21:685:59239:16:0:72:316:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:otherwise invest all of their own contributions in one asset.   
22:686:59305:0:20:72:527:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:result in an asset-composition of the simulated contributions and account balances that closely 
22:687:59401:20:21:71:252:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:correspond to observed 401(k) plans. 
22:688:59438:21:21:107:529:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:To estimate retirement wealth, we need to specify processes for asset returns.  Monthly 
22:689:59526:21:20:71:539:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:returns to the assets --- large-cap equity, small-cap equity, money market, long-term government 
22:690:59623:20:21:71:524:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:bond, and high-grade long-term corporate bond --- are reported in Ibbotson Associates (2002) 
22:691:59716:21:21:71:477:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:from January 1927 through December 2001.  The historical annual returns averaged 
22:692:59797:21:20:71:532:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:approximately 12 percent for large-cap equities, 17 percent for small cap equities, 4 percent for 
22:693:59895:20:21:71:527:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:money market (i.e., Treasury bills), just below 6 percent for long-term government bonds, and 
22:694:59989:21:21:72:329:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:just above 6 percent for high-grade corporate bonds.  
22:695:60043:21:21:108:536:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:We draw randomly with replacement from the historical distributions of monthly returns 
22:696:60130:21:20:72:525:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:from 1927-2001, with the returns for the assets other than company stock and an inflation rate 
22:697:60225:20:21:72:481:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:drawn as a package for a given month in order to retain all within-month, cross-asset 
22:698:60311:21:21:72:538:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:correlations.  For company stock returns, we simultaneously draw the returns of four factors (the 
22:699:60409:21:20:72:489:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:three Fama-French (1993) factors that summarize the overall market excess return, the 
22:700:60495:20:21:72:531:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:performance of small stocks relative to big stocks, and the performance of value stocks relative 
22:701:60592:21:21:72:524:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to growth stocks, and the fourth momentum factor that summarizes the performance of stocks 
22:702:60683:21:20:72:511:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with recent gains relative to stocks with recent losses) for the same month, and use these to 
22:703:60777:20:21:72:531:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:generate an expected return on company stock using the individual firms’ estimated betas from 
22:704:60871:21:21:72:324:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the four-factor model proposed by Carhart (1997).25 
22:705:60922:21:20:108:520:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:We estimate the betas for the four-factor model using CRSP stock returns for 1991 to 
22:706:61007:20:21:72:513:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:2001.  For each of the 867 firms that had at least 24 months of stock returns over the period 
22:707:61101:21:21:72:532:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:1991-2001 and whose match policy did not change over the sample, we estimate regressions of 
22:708:61193:21:21:72:527:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:monthly stock returns on the four factors.26  Specifically, following a standard approach in the 
22:709:61290:21:20:72:520:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:finance literature, the excess stock return (stock return less the risk-free rate) is related to the 
22:710:61391:20:21:71:524:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:market return (also in excess of the risk-free rate), the return of small capitalization minus big

22:713:61678:20:30:71:531:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:fallen (UMD).  As shown in table 8, average raw returns and excess returns computed from the

22:715:61819:7:12:72:534:113:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:25 The four factor returns are taken from http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html. 
22:716:61935:12:16:72:534:101:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:26 Of the original 946 firms in the sample, 41 had a change in match policy over the sample, 23 could not be linked 
22:717:62051:16:11:72:522:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:with CRSP, and 15 were successfully merged with CRSP but did not have 24 months of returns, resulting in the 
22:718:62160:11:0:72:178:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:final sample of 867 firms. 
23:719:62189:0:20:72:536:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:four-factor model do not differ significantly across match policy.  With the exception of the size 
23:720:62288:20:21:72:536:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:factor, there is no difference in systematic risk across the two groups of firms.  The SMB beta is 
23:721:62387:21:21:72:537:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:significantly smaller for firms with a company stock match, reflecting that firms that match with 
23:722:62485:21:20:72:507:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company stock tend to be somewhat larger.  However, total risk (the standard deviation of 
23:723:62575:20:21:72:514:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:monthly returns) and idiosyncratic risk (the standard deviation of the residual from the four-
23:724:62669:21:21:72:528:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:factor return model) are both significantly lower for firms with a company stock match, on the 
23:725:62764:21:20:72:303:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f5:B:order of 1.5 to 2.1 percentage points per month. 
23:726:62812:20:21:108:507:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:After using the estimated excess return and betas and the monthly draw of the four 
23:727:62895:21:21:72:533:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:factors from the historical return distribution to compute the expected return on company stock, 
23:728:62992:21:21:72:531:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:we then draw randomly from the company stock return error distribution, a normal distribution 
23:729:63086:21:20:72:530:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with variance based on the estimated idiosyncratic risk of the firm, and apply it to the expected 
23:730:63184:20:21:72:529:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:return to generate the realized return for that month.27  These rates of return are then applied to 
23:731:63284:21:21:72:528:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:existing account balances and new contributions.  This process is repeated for each month that 
23:732:63379:21:20:72:532:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the individual is contributing from age 27 through age 61, a total of 420 months.  We then save 
23:733:63475:20:21:72:519:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the total account balance at age 62, and repeat this process 100,000 times for each of the 867 
23:734:63570:21:21:72:185:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f4:B:firms in our sample.28

23:736:63637:20:21:107:502:357:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f3:A:1.  Base case.  In the first scenario of table 9, we present results for the base case, 
23:737:63725:21:21:71:530:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:comparing the distribution of retirement account balances when investments are made with the 
23:738:63818:21:20:72:540:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:1/n rule and the employer match is unrestricted or required to be in company stock.  To construct 
23:739:63916:20:21:72:527:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the table, we run the simulation exercise for each of the 574 choice companies and each of the 
23:740:64011:21:21:72:530:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:293 firms that match in company stock based on each firm’s characteristics.  For each firm, we 
23:741:64106:21:21:72:542:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:then take the simulated final account balances at age 62 and sort them into a distribution from the 
23:742:64206:21:20:72:521:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:lowest to the highest.  In order to make comparisons between the two types of plans, we then 
23:743:64299:20:21:72:529:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:construct the median across firms of each sample statistic.  Thus, the reported 1st percentile for 
23:744:64398:21:21:72:518:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:choice firms represents the median of the 1st percentile of the 574 choice companies, and the 
23:745:64492:21:27:72:502:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:reported 1st percentile for the company stock match firms represents the median of the 1st 
23:746:64582:27:7:72:219:143:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
23:747:64630:7:16:72:522:136:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:27 The inclusion of the years 1997 to 2000, when realized stock returns were high, does not materially affect our 
23:748:64744:16:12:72:540:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:estimates of expected returns (i.e., excess returns and betas).  Estimating excess returns and betas using stock returns 
23:749:64865:12:11:72:536:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:over the subsample 1991 to 1996 results in total and idiosyncratic risk that are a bit lower, but the difference in risk 
23:750:64986:11:7:72:427:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:across match policy is quite similar to that estimated using the full sample of returns.      
23:751:65080:7:16:72:536:90:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:28 Through repeated experimentation, we found that 100,000 simulations is sufficient for the distribution of account 
23:752:65197:16:0:72:158:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:balances to stabilize.

24:754:65314:20:21:72:516:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:points in the distribution.  We also report the percent of times that an individual would have 
24:755:65409:21:21:72:532:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:more wealth with company stock than with choice.  This represents the point in the distribution 
24:756:65505:21:20:72:536:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of 401(k)-plan wealth where balances are the same across match policy (i.e., the crossover point 
24:757:65602:20:21:72:194:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of the two distributions).

24:759:65719:21:20:71:530:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of the possible distribution of outcomes, the bottom panel of the table reports the coefficient of

24:761:65910:21:18:71:436:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:distributions.  Specifically, we use the standard utility function of the form:

24:775:66101:22:21:71:532:457:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:levels of risk aversion.  The case of γ=1 corresponds to log utility.  We search for the value of γ 
24:776:66200:21:21:71:542:436:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:such that the expected utility from the two distributions is the same.  Note that up to this point we 
24:777:66302:21:20:71:503:415:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:have made no assumptions about utility maximizing behavior, but rather have focused on 
24:778:66389:20:21:71:532:395:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:understanding the effect of match policy on retirement wealth, given our empirical estimates of 
24:779:66485:21:21:71:525:374:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:how plan participants actually respond to match policy.  Our use of a utility evaluation here is 
24:780:66582:21:20:72:524:353:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:meant to provide a summary statistic for a nonlinear valuation of the distribution of outcomes 
24:781:66677:20:21:72:535:333:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that places more weight on “bad” events.  We report these results conditional on having varying 
24:782:66773:21:21:72:345:312:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:amounts of additional uncorrelated wealth at retirement. 
24:783:66830:21:20:108:537:291:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The results of our base case indicate that retirement-age account balances at choice firms 
24:784:66921:20:21:72:523:271:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:are larger than the account balances from company stock match firms 31 percent of the time.  
24:785:67014:21:21:72:535:250:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Conversely, balances at company stock match firms are larger 69 percent of the time, indicating 
24:786:67110:21:21:71:541:229:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that the median balance is larger.  The difference in the mean account balance is substantial, with

24:788:67299:20:21:71:526:188:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:choice.  An examination of the full distribution illustrates the basic result of having a match in 
24:789:67398:21:21:71:530:167:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company stock, namely that the mean is higher but there is substantially greater dispersion.  At 
24:790:67495:21:20:71:537:146:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the 1st percentile of the distribution, the company stock match results in retirement wealth that is 
24:791:67596:20:21:72:526:126:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:17 percent lower than under a choice match, whereas at the 99th percentile, the company stock 
24:792:67690:21:21:72:412:105:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:match outcome is 50 percent greater than that of the choice outcome.   
24:793:67761:21:0:108:540:84:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:For CRRA utility, what matters is the size of the gains and losses relative to total wealth.  
25:794:67857:0:20:72:527:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:In addition to the wealth from the 401(k) plan, we recognize that most retirees have additional

25:796:68051:21:21:72:536:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:other wealth is perfectly correlated with 401(k) wealth, then the results would be identical to the 
25:797:68151:21:20:72:501:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:case in which only 401(k) wealth is considered.  To the extent that some of this wealth is 
25:798:68242:20:21:72:511:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:uncorrelated, such as Social Security wealth, it increases one’s tolerance for risk within the

25:800:68436:21:20:71:534:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:plan, we report the risk aversion coefficient assuming the individual has additional uncorrelated 
25:801:68534:20:21:71:539:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:wealth ranging from zero to $1 million.  Using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), Poterba,

25:807:69104:21:20:71:509:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for the two groups, respectively).  Total household wealth excluding DC plan accounts but 
25:808:69194:20:21:71:504:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:including expected Social Security and DB benefits ranges from $362,300 for the median 
25:809:69281:21:21:71:522:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:household with less than a high school education to $1,102,400 for households with at least a 
25:810:69375:21:20:71:524:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:college degree.  This suggests that for utility comparisons, assuming $250,000 or $500,000 of 
25:811:69469:20:21:71:436:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:wealth uncorrelated with the 401(k) account balance would be reasonable.   
25:812:69544:21:21:107:530:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:We find that individuals would prefer a company stock match to a choice match if their

25:815:69805:21:21:71:519:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:individual prefers the company stock match is 6.1.  With no uncorrelated wealth, individuals 
25:816:69898:21:21:71:439:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with a risk aversion coefficient below 1.8 prefer the company stock match.   
25:817:69975:21:20:107:527:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:In interpreting these results, it is important to note that the level of uncorrelated wealth 
25:818:70068:20:21:71:534:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:may differ between individuals across match policy assumptions.  For example, as shown in the 
25:819:70162:21:21:71:484:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:appendix, individuals in companies whose 401(k) plan matches in company stock are 
25:820:70244:21:20:71:510:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:substantially more likely to also have a defined benefit plan.  By comparing our match and 
25:821:70335:20:21:71:532:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:choice assumptions at equivalent levels of uncorrelated wealth, we may in fact be biasing these 
25:822:70431:21:21:71:297:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:calculations against the company stock match. 
25:823:70477:21:20:107:522:108:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The outperformance of the retirement portfolio at company stock match firms reflects 
25:824:70562:20:0:71:539:88:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:two factors.  First, more contributions are directed toward higher-yielding assets when the match 
26:825:70662:0:20:72:509:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:is provided in company stock, which implies that less is invested in lower-yielding assets.  
26:826:70755:20:21:72:512:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Second, company stock match firms have lower risk, which, for an equal share in company 
26:827:70843:21:21:72:533:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stock, reduces the likelihood that the portfolio balance at these firms will fall below the balance 
26:828:70943:21:20:72:213:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:at unrestricted match firms.   
26:829:70974:20:21:108:526:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:To illustrate the effects of these two factors in explaining the desirability of a match in 
26:830:71066:21:21:72:509:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company stock, we present two counterfactual scenarios.  The first counterfactual scenario 
26:831:71157:21:20:72:519:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:compares the distribution of account balances when a firm that actually matches in company 
26:832:71248:20:21:72:540:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stock provides an unrestricted match to account balances when the firm instead follows its actual 
26:833:71346:21:21:72:513:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:policy of matching with company stock.  This scenario holds constant stock characteristics, 
26:834:71438:21:21:72:534:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:while allowing match policy and the share of assets in company stock to vary, thus isolating the 
26:835:71535:21:20:72:516:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:effect of differences in asset holdings on the distribution of account balances.  In the second 
26:836:71631:20:21:72:503:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:scenario, we hold match policy constant (i.e., both types of firms are required to match in 
26:837:71723:21:21:72:536:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company stock), thus isolating the effect of the differences in stock characteristics across choice 
26:838:71823:21:20:71:539:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:match firms and company stock match firms on the distribution in account balances.  The results 
26:839:71919:20:21:72:536:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of these two scenarios are shown in the second and third sets of columns in table 9.  Note that in 
26:840:72018:21:21:72:512:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the base case, “vary match policy”, and “vary firm characteristics” scenarios, the rightmost 
26:841:72111:21:20:72:501:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:column describes the distribution of account balances when a company stock match firm 
26:842:72197:20:21:72:471:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:matches with company stock.  Thus, these three columns report identical numbers. 
26:843:72278:21:21:108:528:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The “vary match policy” simulation indicates that the stock characteristics of company 
26:844:72365:21:20:72:505:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stock match firms (i.e., their lower idiosyncratic risk) contributes to the desirability of the 
26:845:72461:20:21:72:534:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company stock match found in the base case.  Recall in the base case, when the comparison is a 
26:846:72556:21:21:72:542:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:choice match firm with a choice match versus a company stock match firm with a company stock 
26:847:72649:21:21:71:527:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:match, the company stock match outperforms the choice match 69 percent of the time, and the 
26:848:72741:21:20:72:536:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:distribution of account balances under the company stock match plan is preferred to participants 
26:849:72838:20:21:72:489:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with a CRRA of 2.9 (assuming $250,000 of uncorrelated wealth).  However, when the 
26:850:72920:21:21:72:528:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:comparison is a company stock match firm with a choice match versus a company stock match 
26:851:73010:21:20:72:535:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:firm with a company stock match, the company stock match outperforms the choice match only 
26:852:73101:20:21:72:532:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:59 percent of the time, and the indifference level of risk aversion falls to 2.3.  Thus, controlling 
26:853:73202:21:21:72:497:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for stock characteristics, a match in company stock is still desirable given sufficient risk 
26:854:73295:21:20:72:536:108:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:tolerance due to the increased exposure to equities.  However, the company stock match is more 
26:855:73390:20:0:72:528:88:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:attractive if stock characteristics are not held constant across match policy, as firms that match 
27:856:73491:0:20:72:541:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with company stock have lower idiosyncratic risk which, ceteris paribus, tightens the distribution 
27:857:73590:20:21:72:181:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of retirement wealth.   
27:858:73614:21:21:108:534:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:In the “vary firm characteristics” simulation, we isolate the effect of differences in stock 
27:859:73707:21:20:72:518:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:characteristics on retirement wealth by comparing the distribution of account balances when 
27:860:73799:20:21:72:509:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:choice firms match with company stock (the counterfactual situation) to the distribution of 
27:861:73891:21:21:71:525:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:account balances when company stock firms match with company stock.  Thus, in both cases, 
27:862:73981:21:20:71:516:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participants are getting the same exposure to equities, but the employees of choice firms are 
27:863:74075:20:21:71:538:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:getting exposure more inefficiently (i.e., by investments in a single stock with a similar expected 
27:864:74175:21:21:72:541:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:return but more risk).  The distribution of account balances at company stock firms is much more 
27:865:74272:21:21:72:527:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:favorable than that at choice firms – the account balances at company stock firms outperforms 
27:866:74366:21:20:72:524:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:those at choice firms 88% of the time, and only risk-neutral participants (i.e., CRRA less than 
27:867:74462:20:21:72:522:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:0.6) would prefer the retirement plan at the choice firms (assuming both choice and company 
27:868:74554:21:21:72:271:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stock firms match with company stock).

27:870:74678:20:21:72:529:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Having established that the relative performance of the portfolios depends importantly on both 
27:871:74773:21:21:72:538:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the share of assets in company stock as well as firm characteristics, we present scenarios in table 
27:872:74873:21:20:72:542:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:10 in which we alter some of our simplifying assumptions to assess whether they affect our result 
27:873:74971:20:21:72:537:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of a preference for a plan at a company that matches with company stock.  In scenario 2, we add 
27:874:75067:21:21:72:537:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:fund management expenses, which make company stock more attractive because it has very low 
27:875:75158:21:20:72:535:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:or zero administrative costs, while other investment options have higher costs.  We assume zero 
27:876:75254:20:21:72:513:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:costs for company stock, and make assumptions concerning management expenses of other 
27:877:75340:21:21:72:515:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:assets that are in line with costs at corporate plans reported in a confidential industry study.  
27:878:75438:21:21:72:535:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Given the assumed asset composition of total contributions (i.e., employee and employer), these 
27:879:75534:21:20:72:539:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:assumed fees translate into a $0.31 reduction per $100 of contributions for company stock match 
27:880:75630:20:21:72:528:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:firms compared to a $0.21 reduction for choice match firms, a difference of ten basis points.29  
27:881:75727:21:21:107:533:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:As illustrated in scenario 2, the difference in costs compounds over time, with the lower 
27:882:75817:21:20:71:518:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:relative fees for company stock making the company stock match more attractive.  Despite a 
27:883:75908:20:30:71:539:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:significantly lower average account balance before adding administrative costs, a participant in a

27:885:76055:7:16:72:536:113:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:29 Samwick and Skinner (2003) assume expenses of 42, 71, and 92 basis points for money market, bond, and equity 
27:886:76167:16:12:72:520:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:funds, respectively, based on Investment Company Institute (ICI) data for funds outside of 401(k) plans.  Using 
27:887:76279:12:11:72:528:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:these higher expenses would increase the advantage of company stock relative to these alternative assets, roughly 
27:888:76393:11:0:72:302:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:doubling the difference in total fees across match policy. 
28:889:76454:0:20:72:518:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:plan with a choice match pays on average $23,000 more in fees over the 35-year period than 
28:890:76545:20:21:72:538:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:does a participant in a plan with a match required to be in company stock; the higher fees for the 
28:891:76644:21:21:72:540:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:choice firms thus reduce their average 401(k) account balance by roughly 2 percent.  Participants 
28:892:76742:21:20:72:513:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with $250,000 in uncorrelated wealth and a CRRA up to 3.5 now prefer the company stock 
28:893:76829:20:21:72:529:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:match.  The indifference level of risk aversion is 7.6 with $1 million of outside wealth, and 2.0 
28:894:76927:21:21:72:187:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with no outside wealth. 
28:895:76951:21:20:108:533:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The next two scenarios incorporate the indirect effects of a company stock match policy 
28:896:77039:20:21:72:536:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that were discussed in Section IV, on top of the administrative costs.  Scenario 3 recognizes that 
28:897:77138:21:21:72:496:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the employer match in company stock leads participants to increase their own voluntary 
28:898:77225:21:21:72:516:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:purchases of company stock, and scenario 4 makes the additional assumption that firms that 
28:899:77316:21:20:72:532:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:match in company stock typically offer one fewer alternative investment choice in their plan.30  
28:900:77413:20:21:71:542:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Since we only observe how participants invest given the match policy of their firm, but not under 
28:901:77511:21:21:71:524:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the counterfactual, an implicit assumption underlying the utility comparisons for scenario 3 is 
28:902:77607:21:20:71:542:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that employees in a firm with a company stock match would invest their contributions differently 
28:903:77704:20:21:71:515:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:if they switched to an unrestricted match firm, and vice versa.  These indirect effects lead to 
28:904:77800:21:21:71:536:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:greater purchases of company stock in company stock match firms, boosting the annual share of 
28:905:77894:21:20:71:532:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employee contributions invested in company stock from 14 to 24 percent, and the share of total 
28:906:77989:20:21:71:378:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:contributions invested in company stock from 42 to 49 percent. 
28:907:78052:21:21:107:507:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Not surprisingly, the incorporation of these effects jointly boosts the mean account 
28:908:78137:21:20:71:537:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:balance at company stock match firms by $84,000 (from $1,178,000 in scenario 2 to $1,262,000 
28:909:78230:20:21:71:528:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in scenario 4) or seven percent.  The mean balance under a company stock match is 41 percent 
28:910:78323:21:21:71:528:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:higher than that under a choice match.  However, incorporating these indirect effects increases 
28:911:78419:21:21:71:529:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the dispersion in account balances, slightly raising the risk that the portfolio will underperform 
28:912:78518:21:20:71:524:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the choice match portfolio (from 28 to 30 percent) and reducing the indifference risk aversion

28:915:78768:21:27:71:490:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:account balances that closely match those of actual 401(k) plans.  Our assumptions for

28:917:78903:7:16:72:501:136:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:30 Under scenario 3, two-fifths of the indirect boost in company stock purchases comes from a reduction in 
28:918:79010:16:12:72:520:120:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:contributions to the safest asset, the money market fund, with the remaining three-fifths of the reduction evenly 
28:919:79124:12:11:72:515:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:distributed across the remaining five options.  Under scenario 4, the company stock match plan now offers six 
28:920:79234:11:12:72:540:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:options, which boosts employee contributions to company stock by approximately 2.4 percentage points (i.e., 16.7 – 
28:921:79349:12:11:72:539:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:14.3 = 2.4).  Rather than eliminate fully one of the six non-company stock assets, we reduce employee contributions 
28:922:79465:11:0:72:408:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:to these six assets by approximately 0.4 percentage points each, i.e., (16.7–14.3)/6.  
29:923:79554:0:20:72:517:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:contributions lead to participants in company stock match (choice match) plans investing 24 
29:924:79646:20:21:72:541:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percent (14 percent) of employee contributions in company stock, comparable to the observed 25 
29:925:79741:21:21:72:516:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percent (16 percent) recorded in table 3.  Total contributions allocated to company stock are 
29:926:79835:21:20:72:534:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:assumed to be 49 percent for company stock match firms and 14 percent for choice firms, again 
29:927:79929:20:21:72:509:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:very similar to the observed 46 and 17 percent, respectively.  The asset composition of our 
29:928:80021:21:21:72:516:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:simulated account balances is also in line with asset holdings in other studies.  For example, 
29:929:80116:21:20:71:506:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Benartzi and Thaler (2001) document that among plans that offer company stock, equities 
29:930:80204:20:21:71:524:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:account for 71 percent of assets (see also Holden and VanDerhei, 2001a).  In our simulations, 
29:931:80298:21:21:71:503:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:this corresponds to the average equity allocation across all firms after about nine years of 
29:932:80391:21:21:71:514:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participation.31  At this same point, plans that match in company stock have, on average, 24 
29:933:80484:21:20:72:536:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percentage points more of the account balance allocated to company stock than do firms with an 
29:934:80579:20:21:72:542:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:unrestricted match.  This is very consistent with the average difference of 24 percentage points in 
29:935:80679:21:21:72:141:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the 11-k data. 
29:936:80694:21:20:108:533:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:An important omission from our simulations thus far is the possibility of the bankruptcy 
29:937:80783:20:21:72:535:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of the firm, and the associated wiping out of the company stock holdings in the 401(k) account.  
29:938:80880:21:21:72:527:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Indeed, it was the bankruptcy of firms like Enron and Worldcom that precipitated much of the 
29:939:80973:21:20:72:533:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:public policy interest in the question of firm match policy in the first place.  To address this, we 
29:940:81074:20:21:72:522:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:introduce a bankruptcy probability by designating each firm as being included in one of three 
29:941:81168:21:21:72:535:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:groups – those with investment-grade bonds, speculative-grade bonds, and no rated bonds – and 
29:942:81262:21:20:72:512:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:applying the expected default probability for that group to the firm.32  The expected default 
29:943:81356:20:21:71:537:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:probabilities used for each group represent the median rate for that group during 1997 and 1998, 
29:944:81453:21:21:71:497:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:as estimated by KMV Corporation, a group that implements a method that measures the 
29:945:81537:21:21:71:511:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:likelihood that the market value of a firm’s assets falls short of its liabilities.  The expected 
29:946:81635:21:20:72:537:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:default probabilities for the year ahead are 0.15 percent for investment-grade firms, 1.93 percent 
29:947:81734:20:21:72:514:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for speculative-grade firms, and 1.61 percent for firms with no bond rating.  Across the 867 
29:948:81827:21:21:72:536:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:firms, the average expected bankruptcy rate is 1.1 percent per year, roughly in line with realized 
29:949:81926:21:20:72:511:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:bond default rates that averaged about 1.3 percent per year from 1981 to 2000 according to 
29:950:82017:20:18:72:540:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Standard & Poor’s, and the aggregate business failure rate from 1990 to 1997 reported by Dun & 
29:951:82112:18:8:72:219:132:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
29:952:82160:8:16:72:541:124:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:31 The Vanguard Group (2003) reports an average job tenure of 9.5 years for a sample of 401(k) participants that had 
29:953:82277:16:7:72:270:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:access to company stock in their retirement plan. 
29:954:82327:7:16:72:504:101:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:32 Bond ratings are made by Standard and Poor’s and available in Compustat.  A rating of BBB- or better is 
29:955:82434:16:11:72:538:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:classified as investment grade.  For firms that changed bond rating over the period, we calculated the average rating 
29:956:82552:11:0:72:138:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:over the period. 
30:957:82571:0:20:72:525:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Bradstreet.33  These rates imply that a firm has a 32 percent chance of failure over the 35-year 
30:958:82668:20:21:72:170:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:investment horizon. 
30:959:82688:21:21:108:538:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:We implement this bankruptcy procedure by calculating a return cut-off that corresponds 
30:960:82776:21:20:72:517:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to the bottom 0.15, 1.93, or 1.61 percent of the return distribution for each group.  When the 
30:961:82871:20:21:72:532:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:random return draw for a particular company is lower than the bankruptcy return cutoff for that 
30:962:82967:21:21:72:542:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:firm’s group, we set the company stock account balance to zero.  Following Poterba, Rauh, Venti 
30:963:83063:21:20:72:522:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and Wise (2003), we assume that the individual continues to participate in a 401(k) plan after 
30:964:83158:20:21:72:499:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:bankruptcy, with new contributions commencing in the following month.34  Variation in 
30:965:83244:21:21:72:528:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:bankruptcy rates across firms therefore depends both on which default group the firm is in and 
30:966:83339:21:21:72:496:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the firm’s stock price volatility, as firms with greater volatility are more likely to hit the 
30:967:83434:21:20:72:539:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:bankruptcy return cutoff.  For our sample, the expected default probability averages 0.59 percent 
30:968:83532:20:21:72:508:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for company stock match firms, and 1.41 for choice match firms, substantially higher both 
30:969:83622:21:21:72:518:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:because there are fewer investment-grade firms in the choice match group and because these 
30:970:83713:21:20:72:255:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:firms have higher idiosyncratic risk.   
30:971:83753:20:21:72:518:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Scenario 5 shows that bankruptcy risk slightly reduces the mean and median account 
30:972:83836:21:21:72:530:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:balances, but the balances for the company stock match plan still exceed the choice match plan 
30:973:83931:21:20:72:505:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:balance two-thirds of the time.  It is still the case that sufficiently risk-tolerant individuals 
30:974:84029:20:21:72:529:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(CRRA of 2.7 with $250,000 of uncorrelated wealth) would prefer the company stock match.   
30:975:84120:21:21:108:520:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The limited effect of bankruptcy might at first seem somewhat puzzling, but it can be 
30:976:84206:21:20:72:524:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:explained by two factors.  First, the firms that match with company stock have a substantially 
30:977:84301:20:21:72:534:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:lower risk of bankruptcy, as reflected in their greater likelihood of being rated investment grade 
30:978:84400:21:21:72:517:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and lower stock price volatility.  Thus, while employees at company stock match firms have 
30:979:84491:21:21:72:524:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:more of their account subject to bankruptcy risk (i.e., invested in company stock), bankruptcy 
30:980:84586:21:20:72:536:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:happens less frequently.  Second, bankruptcy, which reduces company stock holdings to zero, is 
30:981:84681:20:21:72:535:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:related to the realization of a very bad outcome, which, in the absence of the forced bankruptcy, 
30:982:84779:21:21:72:536:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:would already have reduced company stock holdings substantially.  In our previous simulations, 
30:983:84874:21:27:72:537:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:it was possible to have monthly return realizations at the bottom tail of the distribution as low as 
30:984:84975:27:7:72:219:143:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
30:985:85023:7:12:72:538:136:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:33 See Standard & Poor’s (2001) and Dun & Bradstreet, Table B-96 in the Economic Report of the President, 2002.  
30:986:85136:12:16:72:532:124:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:34 Incorporating some period of post-bankruptcy unemployment would lower the average account balance for both 
30:987:85246:16:11:72:512:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:choice and company stock match firms, and thus the difference in the distributions would not be substantially 
30:988:85356:11:12:72:537:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:altered.  Indeed, given that choice match firms have higher average bankruptcy rates, due to their higher stock price 
30:989:85474:12:11:72:533:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:volatility, including a period of unemployment would increase the relative advantage of participating in a plan at a 
30:990:85591:11:0:71:227:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:firm that matches in company stock.    
31:991:85632:0:20:72:522:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:-100 percent; our implementation of bankruptcy effectively treats monthly return realizations 
31:992:85726:20:21:72:498:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:beyond -65 to -70 percent as if they were -100 percent.  Thus, the marginal effect of this 
31:993:85817:21:21:72:533:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:“imposed” bankruptcy is not that large because the stock would have performed poorly anyway 
31:994:85909:21:20:72:525:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(i.e., whereas a -80 percent return wipes out four-fifths of the account balance in scenario 4, it 
31:995:86008:20:21:72:520:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:would lead to bankruptcy in scenario 5 and thus wipe out the entire company stock balance). 
31:996:86100:21:21:108:523:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Another potential concern is that we draw from the distribution of historical returns in 
31:997:86189:21:20:72:515:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:which there was a sizeable equity premium.  There are numerous reasons to believe that the 
31:998:86280:20:21:72:530:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:equity premium has fallen and that the equity premium going forward may be lower than it has 
31:999:86373:21:21:72:529:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:been in the past  (Fama and French, 2002; Blanchard, 1993; Campbell, 2001; Diamond 2001).  
31:1000:86464:21:21:72:534:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:To account for the possibility that the equity premium will be lower in the future, we reduce the 
31:1001:86562:21:20:72:538:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:historical gap between the equity return and Treasury bill rate of approximately eight percentage 
31:1002:86660:20:21:72:410:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:points to approximately four percentage points for our simulations.35   
31:1003:86732:21:21:108:540:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:This four-percentage point cut, implemented in scenario 6, dramatically reduces expected 
31:1004:86821:21:20:72:533:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement account balances, more so for company stock match firms since a larger part of their 
31:1005:86917:20:21:72:521:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:holdings are in equities.  The median balance for the company stock match firms is $243,000 
31:1006:87009:21:21:72:512:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(versus $465,000 before the halving of the equity premium), just about equal to the median 
31:1007:87100:21:20:72:522:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:balance for the choice match firms of $244,000.  Thus, the company stock match exceeds the 
31:1008:87191:20:21:72:511:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:choice match only 49 percent of the time.36  As has been the case, the mean balance for the 
31:1009:87283:21:21:72:531:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company stock match firm still exceeds that for the choice match firm, however it now does so 
31:1010:87377:21:20:72:539:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:by only 29 percent, compared to 41 percent before the reduction in the equity premium (scenario 
31:1011:87473:20:21:72:520:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:4).  When additional uncorrelated wealth of $250,000 is assumed, the reduction of the equity 
31:1012:87566:21:21:72:540:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:premium reduces the CRRA at which participants are indifferent to match policy from 3.2 to 2.2. 
31:1013:87662:21:21:72:534:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: The final simulation, scenario 7, combines the previous two scenarios – jointly allowing 
31:1014:87751:21:20:71:510:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for bankruptcy and reducing the equity premium.  Now the company stock match portfolio 
31:1015:87838:20:23:71:536:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:underperforms the choice match 55 percent of the time, and only individuals with CRRA of 2 or 
31:1016:87932:23:7:72:219:189:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:                                                 
31:1017:87980:7:16:72:534:182:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:35 The equity premium reduction of 32.5 basis points per month is applied to all equity instruments, including large 
31:1018:88097:16:12:72:530:166:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:cap, small cap, company stock, and the equity portion of the balanced fund.  We have not altered the return on the 
31:1019:88212:12:11:72:524:154:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:money market or bond investments, although in general equilibrium one might expect these returns to change as 
31:1020:88322:11:12:72:533:143:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:well if the equity premium is reduced.  A reduction in the expected return of fixed-income securities as well would 
31:1021:88438:12:7:72:296:131:100:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:enhance the desirability of a match in company stock.   
31:1022:88494:7:16:72:533:124:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:36 The account balance at the company stock match firms exceeds than at the choice firms 70 percent of the time if 
31:1023:88609:16:11:72:530:108:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:there is no reduction in the historical equity premium and 49 percent of the time if there is a four-percentage point 
31:1024:88727:11:12:72:542:97:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:reduction in the equity premium.  Assuming a two-percentage point reduction in the equity premium, consistent with 
31:1025:88842:12:11:72:525:85:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:Samwick and Skinner (2003), results in the company stock match plan accounts outperforming 57 percent of the 
31:1026:88951:11:0:72:100:74:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:F:time.   
32:1027:88961:0:20:72:509:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:less prefer the company stock match (again assuming $250,000 of additional wealth).  The 
32:1028:89050:20:21:72:533:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:simulations in scenarios 5 through 7 underscore that a lower equity premium is a greater source 
32:1029:89146:21:21:72:354:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of risk to a match in company stock than firm bankruptcy. 
32:1030:89204:21:20:108:522:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:An alternative way to examine the importance of the equity premium is to impose the 
32:1031:89288:20:21:72:536:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:restriction that choice firms provide their matching contributions entirely in the large-cap equity 
32:1032:89388:21:21:72:532:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:fund.  While this scenario is of little real world relevance -- no firms do this because there is no 
32:1033:89489:21:20:72:522:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:advantage to restricting match choice except if it is in company stock -- this scenario helps to 
32:1034:89586:20:21:72:534:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:further quantify the role of the equity premium.  In unreported analyses, we evaluated scenarios 
32:1035:89683:21:21:72:481:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:assuming that the “choice” firms actually matched with a large-cap equity fund.  Not 
32:1036:89768:21:21:72:513:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:surprisingly, this approach reduces the desirability of the company stock match because the 
32:1037:89860:21:20:71:539:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:large-cap equity portfolio has less risk.  When the choice match is directed into the S&P 500, the 
32:1038:89959:20:21:71:521:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:balance at choice plans outperforms the balance at company stock match plans roughly three-
32:1039:90050:21:21:71:543:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:fifths of the time, versus about 30 percent of the time when the choice firm match was distributed 
32:1040:90149:21:20:71:525:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:evenly across all seven investment options.  Once we incorporate bankruptcy risk and a lower 
32:1041:90242:20:21:72:534:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:equity premium, individuals with CRRA of 1.8 or less prefer the match to be in company stock, 
32:1042:90336:21:21:72:506:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:even if the “choice” match would all be in the S&P 500 (assuming $250,000 of additional 
32:1043:90424:21:20:72:520:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:wealth).  As outside wealth rises to $1 million, the indifference level of relative risk aversion 
32:1044:90522:20:21:72:518:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:rises to 3.7.  These results underscore that from an employees’ perspective, a company stock 
32:1045:90615:21:21:72:523:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:match is not the best way to increase the equity exposure of the 401(k) account; however, the 
32:1046:90709:21:21:72:388:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employer has no incentive to restrict the match to an equity fund. 
32:1047:90776:21:20:72:330:294:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:C:C.  Do Firms Choose the Appropriate Match Policy? 
32:1048:90826:20:21:72:536:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Our earlier results suggest that the choice of employer match policy is negatively related 
32:1049:90917:21:21:71:530:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to firm risk and is more likely if the firm also offered additional retirement benefits in the form 
32:1050:91017:21:20:71:521:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of a DB plan.  We hypothesized that these effects owed to fewer concerns by these firms that 
32:1051:91110:20:21:71:523:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participants would have inadequate retirement wealth.  To explore this hypothesis further, we 
32:1052:91204:21:21:71:541:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:consider two counterfactual scenarios that assess whether participants would have been better off 
32:1053:91302:21:20:71:541:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:if the firms had chosen the alternative match policy.  That is, we test whether account balances at 
32:1054:91402:20:21:71:517:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:choice firms are higher with an unrestricted match (their actual policy) than with a company 
32:1055:91495:21:21:72:533:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stock match (the counterfactual policy) for these same firms, and visa versa.  The point of these 
32:1056:91593:21:20:72:507:108:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:comparisons is to see if firms appear to choose the employer match that provides the most 
32:1057:91683:20:0:72:436:88:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:favorable distribution of account balances given the firm’s characteristics.   
33:1058:91764:0:20:72:514:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: We do these counterfactual exercises for the base case and the scenario allowing for 
33:1059:91849:20:21:72:524:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:bankruptcy risk and a reduced equity premium (scenario 7 in table 10).  For the base case, we 
33:1060:91943:21:21:72:537:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:first simulate balances for choice match firms allowing an unrestricted match, their actual policy 
33:1061:92042:21:20:72:542:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:(column 1 in table 11), but then require the counterfactual that the employer match is in company 
33:1062:92140:20:21:72:524:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stock (column 2 in table 11).  Similarly, we simulate balances for company stock match firms 
33:1063:92233:21:21:72:526:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:first allowing these firms to make an unrestricted match (the counterfactual policy, column 3), 
33:1064:92329:21:20:72:516:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and then requiring a match all in company stock (their actual policy, column 4).  Results for 
33:1065:92423:20:21:72:326:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:scenario 7 are reported similarly in columns 5 to 8.   
33:1066:92478:21:21:72:542:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Comparing columns 1 and 2, we find that the account balance would have been lower just 
33:1067:92565:21:21:72:507:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:over half the time (51 percent) if the choice match companies had been forced to match in 
33:1068:92655:21:20:72:527:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company stock.  Columns 3 and 4 show that the companies that actually do match in company 
33:1069:92745:20:21:72:511:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stock end up with a higher account balance three-fifths of the time (59 percent) than if they 
33:1070:92839:21:21:72:524:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:would have offered an unrestricted match.  This evidence is at least consistent with the notion 
33:1071:92935:21:20:72:488:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that companies are selecting their match policy in a manner that takes into account the 
33:1072:93023:20:21:72:280:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:risk/reward trade-off for their employees.   
33:1073:93068:21:21:72:512:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: Once one jointly considers the substantially reduced equity premium and the risk of 
33:1074:93152:21:20:72:511:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:bankruptcy, it is clear that the typical choice firm is making the “right” decision to offer an 
33:1075:93248:20:21:72:516:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:unrestricted match since the choice firm is relatively risky (columns 5 and 6).  However, the 
33:1076:93342:21:21:72:542:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:evidence also suggests that the company stock match firms are forcing employees into an inferior 
33:1077:93439:21:20:72:527:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:distribution relative to if they had allowed choice for all but the most risk-tolerant employees.  
33:1078:93538:20:21:72:529:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:While forcing employees into company stock is less costly for the firms that actually do it than 
33:1079:93635:21:21:72:508:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for the choice firms, it is nonetheless the case that, once one incorporates a reduced equity 
33:1080:93729:21:21:72:522:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:premium and the risk of bankruptcy, the comparison of the distributions is unfavorable to the 
33:1081:93823:21:20:72:520:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company stock match.  Naturally, therefore, the appropriateness of the company stock match 
33:1082:93914:20:21:72:279:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:policy is sensitive to the equity premium.   
33:1083:93959:21:21:72:539:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: On net, the evidence is consistent with the idea that firms are partially sorting themselves 
33:1084:94052:21:20:72:533:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:based on how the match policy decision affects the distribution of employee retirement wealth.  
33:1085:94148:20:21:71:502:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:In all scenarios, the decision to match in company stock is a better decision for those that 
33:1086:94241:21:21:72:538:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:actually do the match in company stock than it would be for those that currently provide choice.  
33:1087:94339:21:20:72:397:108:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f5:C:D.  What if Employees Do Not Diversify Their Own Contributions? 
33:1088:94403:20:0:108:535:88:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Up to this point, we have assumed that participants hold somewhat diversified portfolios 
34:1089:94494:0:20:72:494:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:because of their 1/n allocation rule for contributions.  But, empirically, 1/n contribution 
34:1090:94586:20:21:72:533:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:allocations apply to the average investor, and we know from participant-level studies that while 
34:1091:94683:21:21:72:515:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:some 1/n investors exist, there are many who put all of their funds in a single asset (Agnew, 
34:1092:94777:21:20:72:399:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:2002; Benartzi and Thaler, 2001; Holden and VanDerhei, 2001b).    
34:1093:94843:20:21:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B: To assess the desirability of a company stock match for participants who would otherwise 
34:1094:94932:21:21:72:515:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:not diversify their retirement account holdings, we present simulation results for a company 
34:1095:95025:21:20:72:503:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stock match versus a choice match if employees invested only in a single asset.  Table 12 
34:1096:95115:20:21:72:519:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:presents statistics for retirement-age account balances for each asset separately, starting with 
34:1097:95212:21:21:72:512:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company stock, allowing for bankruptcy risk and a reduction in the equity premium of four 
34:1098:95302:21:21:72:530:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:percentage points per year.  It is assumed that when the match is unrestricted (i.e., choice), that 
34:1099:95402:21:20:72:518:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the worker invests both employee and employer contributions in the one asset, and when the 
34:1100:95493:20:21:72:516:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:match is required to be in company stock, the employer contribution is invested in company 
34:1101:95584:21:21:72:384:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stock, but the employee contribution is invested in the one asset. 
34:1102:95651:21:20:108:508:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Not surprisingly, an account that is fully concentrated in a single stock exposes the 
34:1103:95737:20:21:72:538:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participant to considerable risk.  However, when we compare results when participants put all of 
34:1104:95834:21:21:72:523:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:their assets in company stock (first pair of columns in table 12), risk averse employees would 
34:1105:95929:21:20:72:538:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:prefer the account at a company stock match firm over that at a choice match firm, reflecting the 
34:1106:96027:20:21:72:281:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:lower risk of company stock match firms.   
34:1107:96070:21:21:108:515:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Similarly, if participants concentrate their holdings in one of the other non-company 
34:1108:96156:21:20:72:526:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stock assets, a company stock match will be preferred to a choice match that is invested in the 
34:1109:96252:20:21:72:497:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:same undiversified asset, except in the case of small-cap equities.  When the match is in 
34:1110:96342:21:21:72:501:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company stock, participants who would otherwise concentrate their and their employer’s 
34:1111:96429:21:21:72:542:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:contributions in a fixed-income security (scenarios two through four), obtain exposure to equities 
34:1112:96528:21:20:72:515:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:and some diversification gains they otherwise would not receive.  For example, although an 
34:1113:96619:20:21:72:507:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:inefficient means of obtaining equity exposure, most participants who would otherwise be 
34:1114:96708:21:21:72:514:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:concentrated in the money market fund are better off having one-third of total contributions 
34:1115:96801:21:20:72:523:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:directed toward company stock.  Assuming $250,000 of additional uncorrelated wealth, those 
34:1116:96892:20:21:72:366:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:with CRRA less than 11.1 prefer the company stock match.   
34:1117:96951:21:21:108:541:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:On the other hand, if participants would otherwise concentrate investments in a small-cap 
34:1118:97041:21:20:72:509:108:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:equity fund, then the company stock match has little to offer in terms of added exposure to 
34:1119:97133:20:0:72:526:88:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:equities, so the distribution of account balances is less favorable to the company stock match.  
35:1120:97232:0:20:72:532:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Since the beta on the size factor (small minus big) is substantially less than one (the median for 
35:1121:97331:20:21:72:508:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company stock match firms is 0.28), adding company stock to a portfolio that is otherwise 
35:1122:97421:21:21:71:522:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:concentrated in small stocks does provide some diversification value in terms of reducing the 
35:1123:97515:21:20:71:535:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:risk associated with the size factor.  However, this effect must be balanced against the increased 
35:1124:97614:20:21:72:353:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:idiosyncratic risk associated with a company stock match. 
35:1125:97672:21:21:108:517:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The results of our simulations, whether contributions are diversified or concentrated, 
35:1126:97759:21:20:72:533:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:suggest that sufficiently risk-tolerant participants generally would prefer a 401(k) plan at a firm 
35:1127:97859:20:21:72:536:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that matches with company stock than a plan at a firm that provides an unrestricted match.  This 
35:1128:97956:21:21:72:535:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:conclusion reflects two empirical findings.  First, firms that match in company stock have lower 
35:1129:98053:21:21:72:532:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:idiosyncratic risk and lower bankruptcy risk than firms that allow match choice.  Our results do 
35:1130:98150:21:20:72:541:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:not indicate that workers would want firms that currently provide an unrestricted match to switch 
35:1131:98248:20:21:72:527:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to requiring that employer contributions be in company stock.  Indeed, the significantly higher 
35:1132:98344:21:21:72:541:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:risk of firms that offer an unrestricted match would substantially increase the variance of account 
35:1133:98444:21:20:72:513:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:balances if the firm were to switch match policy, and only the most risk-tolerant employees 
35:1134:98536:20:21:72:272:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:would be better off from such a change.   
35:1135:98578:21:21:108:520:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Second, since firms do not have incentives to guide participants to equities other than 
35:1136:98666:21:20:72:535:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company stock, the equity exposure obtained through a company stock match, while inefficient, 
35:1137:98760:20:21:72:500:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:may be better than the alternative asset composition under a choice match, particularly if 
35:1138:98851:21:21:72:522:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participants stick with low-yielding default investment options.  Choi, Laibson, Madrian, and 
35:1139:98945:21:20:72:507:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:Metrick (2001) report that 80% of participants accept both the default savings rate and the 
35:1140:99037:20:21:72:512:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:default investment fund (a money market or stable value fund) at firms that have automatic 
35:1141:99128:21:21:72:518:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:enrollment for their 401(k) plan.  Further, even after three years, half of the plan participants 
35:1142:99226:21:21:72:531:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:subject to automatic enrollment continue to invest all of their contributions in the default fund.  
35:1143:99326:21:20:72:516:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:A more efficient means to provide such participants equity exposure would be to provide an 
35:1144:99417:20:21:72:508:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employer match in a well-diversified stock fund.  However, given the lack of incentive for 
35:1145:99508:21:21:72:532:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:employers to do this, a match in company stock, particularly at firms that provide other sources 
35:1146:99605:21:20:72:513:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of retirement income and have lower risk, can be a second-best means of promoting greater 
35:1147:99695:20:21:72:230:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement wealth accumulation.

35:1150:99769:20:0:108:542:88:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:The increasing importance of 401(k) plans in providing for retirement has raised concerns 
36:1151:99861:0:20:72:524:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:about the financial security of future retirees.  An especially important part of a 401(k) plan is 
36:1152:99960:20:21:71:530:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:whether the employer matching contributions are restricted to company stock or can instead be 
36:1153:100054:21:21:71:524:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:invested as the employee chooses.  Match policy has a large effect on the amount of company 
36:1154:100146:21:20:71:520:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stock in the retirement account because employer contributions are roughly one-third of total 
36:1155:100240:20:21:71:533:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:contributions, employees at firms that match in company stock tend to invest more of their own 
36:1156:100335:21:21:71:537:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:contributions into company stock, and participants rarely rebalance their portfolios to reduce the 
36:1157:100434:21:20:71:524:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:concentration in company stock.  This paper studies why some firms match in company stock 
36:1158:100524:20:21:71:520:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:while others do not.  Employers must trade off a number of costs and benefits that arise from 
36:1159:100618:21:21:71:540:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:requiring that employees hold their 401(k) match in company stock.  This paper provides what is 
36:1160:100714:21:21:71:528:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the first evidence on which of these costs and benefits appear to matter most to firms, and then 
36:1161:100811:21:20:71:436:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:explores the implications of match policy for employee retirement wealth.   
36:1162:100887:20:21:107:525:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Unlike stock option grants to non-executives, the firm’s decision to match in company 
36:1163:100973:21:21:71:541:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:stock does not appear to be correlated with cash flow or with measures of the benefits of aligning 
36:1164:101072:21:20:71:529:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:incentives of employees and owners.  Rather, consistent with the notion that firms consider the 
36:1165:101168:20:21:71:526:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:retirement security of their workers in making the match decision, we find that firms are more 
36:1166:101263:21:21:71:534:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:likely to provide the match in company stock if firm risk is low and employees are also covered 
36:1167:101359:21:20:71:526:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:by a defined benefit plan.  We interpret these findings as consistent with firms considering the 
36:1168:101456:20:21:71:531:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:effect of match policy on the retirement security of plan participants, either because firms want 
36:1169:101554:21:21:71:538:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:to minimize the chance of being considered in violation of their fiduciary duties under ERISA or 
36:1170:101651:21:20:71:519:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:because employees at these firms more fully value company stock because of the lower firm-
36:1171:101741:20:21:71:531:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:specific risk.  We also find evidence that a company stock match is more likely if the firm does 
36:1172:101838:21:21:71:534:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:not have multiple classes of stock, which is an alternative mechanism to reduce hostile takeover 
36:1173:101935:21:21:71:499:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:attempts, and if the firm pays dividends, likely reflecting the potential tax deductions for 
36:1174:102028:21:20:71:433:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:dividends paid on match stock (although the dividend result is less robust). 
36:1175:102105:20:21:107:492:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:We use simulation methods to assess the effect of match policy on the expected 
36:1176:102184:21:21:72:533:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:distribution of account balances at retirement for plan participants, incorporating the behavioral 
36:1177:102283:21:20:72:530:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:responses to match policy by participants as well as the characteristics of the firms offering the 
36:1178:102382:20:21:72:535:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:plan.  Our results suggest that, for sufficiently risk-tolerant individuals, participating in a 401(k) 
36:1179:102485:21:21:72:533:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:plan at a company with a company stock match is often preferable to participating in a plan at a 
36:1180:102582:21:20:72:498:108:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company with an unrestricted match, given the historical equity premium.  This result is 
36:1181:102671:20:0:72:525:88:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:attributable to several factors.  First, the firms that match in company stock have substantially 
37:1182:102771:0:20:72:534:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:lower bankruptcy risk and stock price volatility.  Second, the match in company stock increases 
37:1183:102867:20:21:72:520:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the equity exposure of participants, often by reducing the share of assets held in lower-return 
37:1184:102963:21:21:71:496:667:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:fixed-income securities.  For example, after confirming that an employer match leads to 
37:1185:103051:21:20:71:534:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:participants contributing more of their own contributions to company stock, we show that about 
37:1186:103146:20:21:71:530:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:two-fifths of this boost in company stock purchases comes from a reduction in contributions to 
37:1187:103241:21:21:71:498:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:the safest asset, which is typically a money market fund.  Lower administrative costs for 
37:1188:103331:21:20:72:538:584:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company stock holdings also contribute to the desirability of a company stock match.  However, 
37:1189:103426:20:21:72:437:564:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:a lower equity premium reduces the preference for a company stock match. 
37:1190:103499:21:21:108:528:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Disentangling the alternative hypotheses for firms’ choice of match policy is important 
37:1191:103587:21:21:72:522:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:for guiding public policy.  Our evidence that cash flow constraints are not important suggests 
37:1192:103682:21:20:72:539:501:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:that policy prescriptions to prohibit a match in company stock would be unlikely to lead to a less 
37:1193:103781:20:21:72:533:481:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:generous employer match, which might have been the case if these firms had no other means to 
37:1194:103874:21:21:72:536:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:contribute to the plan.  However, if a firm matches in company stock to deter a takeover attempt 
37:1195:103971:21:20:72:506:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:by increasing the shares held in “friendly hands,” then a cap on company stock may make 
37:1196:104059:20:21:72:527:419:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:offering an employer match less desirable for the firm.  The lack of evidence supporting that a 
37:1197:104155:21:21:72:504:398:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company stock match is provided for traditional equity incentive purposes suggests that a 
37:1198:104245:21:20:72:508:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:prohibition on a match in company stock is unlikely to lead firms to increase equity-based 
37:1199:104336:20:21:72:505:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:compensation to employees through other means, such as by granting more stock options. 
37:1200:104423:21:21:108:542:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:Consistent with our empirical result that less risky firms match in company stock, we find 
37:1201:104514:21:20:72:538:315:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:evidence in our simulations that firms, on average, appear to sort themselves into a match policy 
37:1202:104612:20:21:72:498:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:in part based on the implications for participant retirement wealth.  That is, the expected 
37:1203:104704:21:21:72:513:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:distribution of retirement wealth at firms that require the match in company stock generally 
37:1204:104797:21:21:72:522:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:dominates the distribution simulated under the counterfactual assumption that the same firms 
37:1205:104890:21:20:72:532:232:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:instead provided an unrestricted match.  Thus while matching in company stock may not be the 
37:1206:104983:20:21:72:498:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:most efficient way to increase equity exposure, this result suggests that across-the-board 
37:1207:105074:21:21:72:539:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:limitations on a company stock match may not be appropriate for all firms.  Only if we assume a 
37:1208:105170:21:20:72:531:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:significant cut in the equity premium or assume that the participant is already concentrated in a 
37:1209:105268:20:21:72:453:150:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:small-cap equity fund would a participant not prefer the company stock match. 
37:1210:105346:21:21:108:539:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:A:A promising direction for future research is to consider the role of 401(k) plans in studies 
37:1211:105439:21:20:72:519:108:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:of stock based compensation for non-executives.  Within 401(k) plans of firms that match in 
37:1212:105531:20:0:72:488:88:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:company stock, the number of shares held in the plans is comparable to the number of 
38:1213:105618:0:20:72:540:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:outstanding employee stock options held by non-executives.  However, the firms that grant stock 
38:1214:105714:20:21:72:518:688:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:B:options appear to be very different than the firms that grant stock to their employees through
