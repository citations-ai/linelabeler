2:34:1930:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:We  investigate  how  the  scientific  community's  perception  of  a  scientist's  prior  work  changes 
2:35:2035:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:when one  of  his  articles  is  retracted.  Relative  to  non-retracted  control  authors,  faculty  members 
2:36:2144:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:who  experience a  retraction  see  the  citation  rate  to  their  earlier,  non-retracted  articles  drop  by 
2:37:2255:14:14:72:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:10%  on  average,  consistent with  the  Bayesian  intuition  that  the  market  inferred  their  work  was 
2:38:2362:14:14:72:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:mediocre  all  along.  We  then  investigate whether  the  eminence  of  the  retracted  author  and  the 
2:39:2467:14:14:72:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:cause  of  the  retraction  (fraud  vs.  mistake)  shape the  magnitude  of  the  penalty.  We  find  that 
2:40:2573:14:14:72:546:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:eminent scientists are more harshly penalized than their less distinguished peers in the wake of a 
2:41:2671:14:14:72:546:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:retraction,  but  only  in  cases  involving  fraud  or  misconduct. When  the  retraction  event  had  its 
2:42:2778:14:14:72:543:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:source  in  “honest  mistakes,”  we  find  no  evidence  of  differential  stigma between  high-  and  low-
2:43:2884:14:28:72:186:462:12:Times:12:Times:C:status faculty members.

3:58:3178:0:35:72:208:708:17:g_d0_f3:17:g_d0_f3:C:1    Introduction
3:59:3195:35:18:72:540:673:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:In July 1987 Charles Glueck, a leading scientist known for his investigations into the role
3:60:3286:18:18:72:540:655:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of cholesterol in heart disease, was censured by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for
3:61:3378:18:18:72:540:637:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:serious scientific misconduct in a study he published inPediatrics, a major medical journal
3:62:3469:18:18:72:540:619:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:(Glueck  et  al.   1986).   At  the  time  the  article  was  retracted,  Dr.   Glueck  was  the  author
3:63:3573:18:18:72:540:601:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of 200 publications that had garnered more than 10,000 citations.  The scandal was well-
3:64:3661:18:18:72:540:583:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:publicized,  including two articles in the New York Times calling into question the ability
3:65:3752:18:18:72:540:565:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of peer reviewers to root out misconduct in scientific research more generally.  Glueck’s fall
3:66:3846:18:19:72:540:547:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:from grace was swift—he had to resign his post from the University of Cincinnati College
3:67:3934:19:18:72:540:528:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of Medicine—but also far from complete:  he found employment as the Medical Director of
3:68:4021:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:The Jewish Hospital Cholesterol Center in Cincinnati, and was still an active researcher as
3:69:4112:18:22:72:374:492:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of 2014, though he never again received funding from NIH.
3:70:4169:22:19:89:539:470:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Across many economic settings, including the realms of entertainment, sports, and the
3:71:4254:19:18:72:540:451:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:upper  echelons  of  the  corporate  world,scandallooms  as  one  of  the  primary  mechanisms
3:72:4348:18:18:71:539:433:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:through which the mighty are often brought low.  The consequences of scandalous revela-
3:73:4435:18:18:71:539:415:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:tions are especially important in the scientific community, where reputation functions like a
3:74:4528:18:18:71:539:397:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:currency (Dasgupta & David 1994).  However, the efficiency of the scientific reward system
3:75:4618:18:18:71:539:379:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:is predicated upon the community’s ability to separate truth from falsehood, to strike inac-
3:76:4710:18:18:71:539:361:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:curacies from the scientific record, and to dole out reputational punishment in the wake of
3:77:4801:18:18:71:539:343:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:errors or misconduct (Budd et al.  1998; Lacetera & Zirulia 2011; Fang et al.  2012; Furman
3:78:4892:18:18:71:539:325:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:et al.  2012;  Azoulay et al.  2015).  Which scientists are most vulnerable to these punish-
3:79:4984:18:18:71:539:307:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:ments?  How does the nature of an infraction and the prominence of the scientist moderate
3:80:5073:18:18:71:539:289:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the effect of scandal on scientific reputation?  Because scandal is at its core an informational
3:81:5169:18:18:71:539:271:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:phenomenon, we study the professional fate of scientists whose transgressions are suddenly
3:82:5259:18:23:71:511:253:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:publicized—to paraphrase the succinct definition of scandal provided by Adut (2005).
3:83:5343:23:18:89:539:230:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The reigning theoretical paradigm to assess the effects of the revelation of information is
3:84:5434:18:18:71:539:212:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Bayesian updating.  When the “market” (the scientific community) observes the release of
3:85:5522:18:18:71:539:194:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:negative information, it might infer that the agent (in this case, a scientist) was mediocre
3:86:5614:18:18:71:539:176:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:all  along,  therefore  discounting  the  work  that  he  produced  in  the  past.   In  line  with  this
3:87:5719:18:18:71:539:158:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:paradigm,  we  develop  a  theoretical  model  that  incorporates  two  key  factors  in  the  com-
3:88:5818:18:18:71:539:140:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:munity’s  assessment  of  a  scandal:  (i)  the  agent’s  prominence  at  the  time  of  the  negative
3:89:5920:18:69:71:539:122:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:revelation,  and  (ii)  the  informational  content  of  the  disclosure  itself.   Our  model  predicts
3:90:6024:69:0:303:309:53:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:1
4:91:6025:0:19:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:that  more  prominent  scientists  will  suffer  greater  reputation  loss  than  less  prominent  au-
4:92:6127:19:22:72:540:689:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:thors following disclosures of misconduct, but not following disclosures of “honest mistakes.”
4:93:6221:22:18:89:539:667:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:To address these issues empirically, we turn to the setting of scientific retractions.  We
4:94:6311:18:18:72:540:649:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:start from a list of biomedical research articles retracted during a period that spans the years
4:95:6407:18:18:72:540:631:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:1980 to 2009.  We carefully match the authors of these publications to the Faculty Roster
4:96:6496:18:19:72:540:613:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), a comprehensive panel dataset
4:97:6581:19:18:72:540:594:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:recording  the  career  histories  of  U.S.  academic  biomedical  researchers.   This  generates  a
4:98:6681:18:18:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:list  376  US-based  faculty  with  at  least  one  retracted  publication  (retracted  authors)  for
4:99:6782:18:18:72:540:558:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:whom we assemble a curated history of publications, NIH grants, and citations.  Our novel
4:100:6871:18:18:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:multi-level panel dataset links individual faculty members associated with retraction events
4:101:6963:18:18:72:540:522:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:together  with  their  prior,  un-retracted  publication  output.   We  proceed  in  a  symmetric
4:102:7060:18:18:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:fashion to produce a sample of articles linked to 759 control authors who were not embroiled
4:103:7152:18:18:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:in retraction scandals, but published articles in the same journals where the retraction events
4:104:7247:18:23:72:123:468:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f7:B:occurred.1
4:105:7257:23:18:89:539:445:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Armed with these data, we analyze the impact of retraction events on the rate of cita-
4:106:7343:18:18:72:540:427:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:tion received by non-retracted articles published prior to the retraction in a difference-in-
4:107:7436:18:18:72:540:409:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:differences framework.  Analyzing citations to prior work,  rather than citations to articles
4:108:7529:18:18:72:540:391:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:published after the retraction event, is a key feature of our empirical strategy.  Following a
4:109:7623:18:18:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:negative reputation shock, scientists might adjust their level of effort or face new production
4:110:7718:18:18:72:539:355:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:constraints (e.g., reduced funding opportunities).  Focusing on unretracted prior work allows
4:111:7811:18:18:72:540:337:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:us to attribute any shift in citation patterns to the negative reputation shock, rather than
4:112:7903:18:23:72:238:319:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:to changes in production inputs.
4:113:7935:23:18:89:539:296:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:This type of analysis may, however, confound any citation penalty suffered by a specific
4:114:8023:18:18:72:540:278:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:retracted  author  with  the  broader  consequences  of  the  scientific  community  abandoning
4:115:8118:18:18:72:540:260:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:a  research  field  altogether.   Significant  spillover  effects  of  retractions  on  the  evolution  of
4:116:8224:18:18:72:540:242:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:research  fields  were  documented  by  Azoulay  et  al.   (2015),  who  examined  the  impact  of
4:117:8322:18:18:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:retractions on the citation of papers in the same field by non-overlapping authors.  In order to
4:118:8418:18:18:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:isolate the effects of retractions on individuals’ reputations and avoid the field-level spillover
4:119:8516:18:18:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:effects, we focus exclusively on publications by the retracted authors in a different research
4:120:8610:18:18:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:subfield than the retracted paper.  Having filtered out the research field-specific effects, we

5:126:9072:19:22:72:203:689:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:retracted control authors.
5:127:9098:22:18:89:539:667:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We then investigate the impact of the authors’ reputation at the time of the retraction
5:128:9185:18:18:72:540:649:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:(whether they belonged to the top quartile of the citation or funding distribution) and of the
5:129:9279:18:18:72:540:631:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:reasons for the retraction by carefully separating instances of misconduct (including fraud
5:130:9370:18:19:72:540:613:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:and  plagiarism)  from  instances  of  mistakes  (stemming,  for  example,  from  contaminated
5:131:9464:19:18:72:540:594:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:biological samples or statistical errors).  Our results indicate that the cause of the retraction
5:132:9561:18:18:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:(mistake vs.  misconduct) and the scientist’s prior reputation interact in very specific ways to
5:133:9657:18:18:72:540:558:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:shape the magnitude of the community’s response. In particular, the work of eminent authors
5:134:9748:18:18:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:is not penalized more severely than that of less eminent ones in the case of honest mistakes.
5:135:9841:18:18:72:540:522:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:However, the difference in citation penalty is much more pronounced when retraction events
5:136:9931:18:18:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:stem  from  clear-cut  cases  of  scientific  misconduct.   In  these  instances,  the  prior  work  of
5:137:10034:18:23:72:383:486:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:retracted authors sees its rate of citation fall by almost 20%.
5:138:10097:23:18:89:539:463:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Jointly, these results show that the penalty levied by the scientific community on a re-
5:139:10185:18:18:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:tracted author matches the response of a Bayesian decision maker who holds prior beliefs
5:140:10273:18:18:72:540:427:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:correlated with the author’s prominence in the profession and perceives misconduct cases
5:141:10361:18:18:72:540:409:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:as  more  informative  signals  than  honest  mistakes.   To  then  assess  how  well  the  market
5:142:10459:18:18:72:540:391:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:is  able  to  parse  the  “truth”  in  signals  of  varying  informativeness,  we  circle  back  to  the
5:143:10563:18:18:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:joint  distribution  of  author  reputations  and  retraction  events.   Consistent  with  the  scien-
5:144:10665:18:18:72:540:355:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:tific community’s beliefs, we find that prior reputation levels are negatively correlated with
5:145:10759:18:18:72:540:337:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the incidence of retractions (as it should be if reputation is informative of the true quality
5:146:10853:18:18:72:540:319:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of  a  scientist).   Surprisingly,  however,  cases  of  misconduct  are  not  relatively  more  preva-
5:147:10956:18:18:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:lent among low-reputation authors and should not, therefore, carry statistical information.
5:148:11047:18:18:72:540:283:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Among possible explanations, this discrepancy in the market’s reaction may suggest either
5:149:11136:18:18:72:540:265:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:an  information-processing  problem  (i.e.,  the  market  is  unable  to  filter  truth  from  noise),
5:150:11238:18:18:72:540:247:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:or an information-acquisition problem (i.e., misconduct cases involving famous authors are
5:151:11328:18:23:72:270:229:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:much more publicized than all others).
5:152:11366:23:18:89:539:206:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Our study is related to a recent paper by Jin et al.  (2017).  These authors also study
5:153:11453:18:18:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the effect of retraction events on the citations received by prior work from retracted authors,
5:154:11548:18:18:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:but they focus on the differential penalty suffered by junior and senior authors on the same
5:155:11640:18:18:72:540:152:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:retracted paper.  They find that the senior authors (those in last authorship position) escape
5:156:11734:18:18:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:mostly unscathed following a retraction, whereas their junior collaborators (typically gradu-
5:157:11827:18:19:72:540:116:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:ate students of postdoctoral fellows) are often penalized severely, sometimes to the point of
5:158:11920:19:44:72:540:97:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:seeing their careers brought to an abrupt end.  Their results are seemingly at odds with ours,

6:160:12015:0:19:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:but it is important to note that the variation we exploit exists between authorship teams,
6:161:12105:19:18:72:540:689:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:rather than within them.  In other words, for each retracted article, we usually focus on a
6:162:12196:18:18:72:540:671:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:single  author,  typically  the  principal  investigator.   In  contrast,  Jin  et  al.   (2017)  compare
6:163:12301:18:18:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the citation trajectories of scientists who appeared on the authorship roster of the same re-
6:164:12394:18:18:72:540:635:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:tracted publication.2Additionally, our study directly investigates how the type of retraction
6:165:12487:18:18:71:539:617:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:signal (mistake vs.  misconduct) moderates reputation penalties, while Jin et al.  (2017) aim
6:166:12580:18:18:71:539:599:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:to remove such variation by discarding self-reported errors from their sample of retraction
6:167:12671:18:23:71:106:581:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:events.
6:168:12678:23:18:89:539:558:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The manuscript proceeds as follows.  The next section summarizes the institutional con-
6:169:12765:18:18:71:539:540:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:text of retractions as part of the broader scientific peer review system.  Section 3 introduces
6:170:12860:18:18:71:539:522:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:a Bayesian model to frame the empirical exercise.  Section 4 describes the data and the pro-
6:171:12952:18:18:71:539:504:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:cess followed to assemble it.  Section 5 presents our empirical strategy and results.  Section 6
6:172:13048:18:18:71:539:486:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:revisits the model to discuss the extent to which the market’s reaction is, in fact, consistent
6:173:13143:18:45:71:335:468:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:with Bayesian learning.  Section 7 briefly concludes.
6:174:13196:45:34:71:272:423:17:g_d0_f3:17:g_d0_f3:C:2    Institutional Setting
6:175:13222:34:18:71:539:389:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:While the role of scientific research in enabling economic growth has become a truism among
6:176:13313:18:18:71:539:371:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:economists, scientific progress does not unfold in an institutional vacuum.  Rather, the sci-
6:177:13406:18:18:71:539:353:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:entific enterprise relies on a set of reinforcing institutions that support individual account-
6:178:13501:18:18:71:539:335:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:ability and reliable knowledge accumulation (Merton 1973; Dasgupta and David 1994).  In
6:179:13588:18:19:71:539:317:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the context of this manuscript, peer review, the allocation of credit through citation, and
6:180:13679:19:22:71:457:298:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the retraction system are three fundamental practices worthy of discussion.
6:181:13754:22:18:89:539:276:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:One of the central institutions of science is the peer-review system.  By submitting sci-
6:182:13843:18:18:71:539:258:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:entific articles for independent review by expert peers, the path to publication balances the
6:183:13936:18:18:71:539:240:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:integrity of published results with the desire to have an adequate pace of discovery.  Simi-
6:184:14028:18:19:71:539:222:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:larly, the practice of citing relevant prior literature allows scientists to clearly and concisely
6:185:14126:19:18:71:539:203:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:communicate where there contributions fall within the scientific landscape, while allocating
6:186:14218:18:17:71:293:185:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:credit to the originators of particular ideas.
6:187:14264:17:16:85:539:168:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:2These authors might be graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, staff scientists, or heads of laboratory,
6:188:14370:16:12:72:540:152:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:though they cannot be separately identified within the constraints of the Jin et al.  (2017) empirical exercise.
6:189:14482:12:12:72:540:140:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:In contrast, we have gathered extensive information about the scientists in our sample, such as demographic
6:190:14589:12:12:72:540:128:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:characteristics and past productivity.  At the time of the retraction event, all of the scientists in our sample
6:191:14701:12:63:72:274:116:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:are faculty members in a U.S. Medical School.

7:193:14747:0:19:89:539:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Retractions are often the culmination of a process used by journals to alert readers when
7:194:14836:19:18:72:540:689:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:articles they published in the past should be removed from the scientific literature.  They
7:195:14927:18:18:72:540:671:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:are qualitatively different from simple corrections in that their intent is to strike the entire
7:196:15023:18:18:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:publication from the scientific record.  Retraction notices may be initiated by the journal
7:197:15114:18:18:72:540:635:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:editors,  by all or some of the authors of the original publication,  or at the request of the
7:198:15208:18:23:72:167:617:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:authors’ employer.
7:199:15226:23:18:89:539:594:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The informational content of retraction notices is highly variable.  Some notices contain
7:200:15315:18:18:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:detailed explanations about the rationale for the decision to retract, while others are a single
7:201:15411:18:18:72:540:558:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:sentence  long  and  leave  the  scientific  community  uncertain  about  (i)  whether  the  results
7:202:15511:18:18:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:contained  therein  should  be  disregarded  in  part  or  in  their  entirety,  and  (ii)  whether  the
7:203:15615:18:18:72:540:522:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:retraction was due to fraud, more benign forms of scientific misconduct, or instead had its
7:204:15706:18:23:72:218:504:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:root in an “honest mistake.”
7:205:15734:23:18:89:539:481:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f6:A:In the recent past, specialized information resources, such as the popular blogRetraction-

7:207:15916:18:18:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:events.  One aspect of a retraction’s “back story” that often proves vexing to decipher per-

7:209:16097:18:18:72:540:409:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:egregious and clear-cut instances of fraud would a retraction notice single out particular in-
7:210:16191:18:18:72:540:391:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:dividuals.  In the United States and for research supported by NIH, scientific misconduct is
7:211:16283:18:18:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:also policed by the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) within the Department of Health and
7:212:16373:18:18:72:540:355:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Human Services.  ORI is vested with broad investigative powers, and its reports are often
7:213:16462:18:23:72:526:337:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the forerunners of retraction events, sometimes involving more than a single publication.
7:214:16551:23:18:89:539:314:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Retraction events are still rare (occurring at the rate of roughly one retraction per ten
7:215:16640:18:18:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:thousand scientific articles), but their frequency has been increasing steadily over the past 20
7:216:16736:18:18:72:540:278:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:years (see Figure 1).  This trend has been the cause of increasing concern in the media (e.g.,
7:217:16830:18:18:72:540:260:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Wade 2010; Van Noorden 2011), and much hand-wringing within the scientific community

7:219:17003:18:18:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:accounts espouse the view that heightened competition for funding leads to increased levels
7:220:17094:18:18:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of sloppiness,  scientists can also gain prominence by detecting instances of misconduct or
7:221:17185:18:18:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:error (Lacetera and Zirulia 2009).  Moreover, the rise of the Internet and electronic resources
7:222:17280:18:18:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:has in all likelihood increased the speed at which peers can direct their attention to results
7:223:17374:18:99:72:372:152:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:that are both noteworthy andex-postdifficult to replicate.

8:226:17459:35:18:72:540:673:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Reputation is a canonical concept across the social sciences.  Within the economics litera-
8:227:17550:18:18:72:540:655:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:ture,  the  existing  theoretical  research is  concerned with how,  and  under  what conditions,
8:228:17647:18:18:72:540:637:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:economic agents acquire a good (or a bad) one, and more generally, how they influence the

8:236:18382:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:and accounting literature also addresses the career effects of financial fraud by evaluating how
8:237:18478:18:18:72:540:474:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:financial fraud and earnings restatements impact the reputations of board members (Srini-

8:239:18659:18:23:72:277:438:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:in sociology (Goffman 1963; Fine 2001).
8:240:18698:23:18:89:539:415:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Our theoretical framework formalizes the dynamics of reputation in a model of Bayesian
8:241:18784:18:18:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:learning.  In particular, we explore how scandal impacts individual reputations, as a func-
8:242:18875:18:18:72:540:379:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:tion of the informational content of the scandalous revelation and of the prominence of the
8:243:18966:18:18:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:individual scientists involved.  The model yields insights that guide the interpretation of the
8:244:19061:18:23:72:159:343:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:empirical results.
8:245:19079:23:18:89:539:320:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We begin with a single, representative researcher (theagent) who is continuously evalu-
8:246:19166:18:18:72:539:302:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:ated by the scientific community (themarket).  The agent has a fixed binary characteristic
8:247:19256:18:18:72:204:284:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f6:B:that denotes hisreliability
8:248:19283:18:24:271:339:266:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f10:C:θ∈{θB,θG}.
8:249:19293:24:18:72:539:242:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Thus, the agent is either good or bad.  We letp0,Pr (θ=θG) denote the market’s prior
8:250:19377:18:23:71:283:224:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f7:B:belief that the agent is of the good type.3
8:251:19420:23:30:89:373:201:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The agent’s output at each point in time is also binary,
8:252:19476:30:19:276:334:171:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f10:C:yt∈{0,1}.
8:253:19485:19:15:85:539:152:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:3In  practice,  a  researcher’s  quality  is  definitely  multi-dimensional,  and  the  shocks  we  observe  (e.g.,  a
8:254:19603:15:12:72:540:137:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:retraction  due  to  mistake  or  misconduct)  lead  to  updating  about  different  dimensions  (e.g.,  the  author’s
8:255:19721:12:12:72:540:125:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:carefulness or honesty).  Ultimately though, we are interested in the market’s ability to trust the author’s
8:256:19829:12:12:72:540:113:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:results.  Put differently, reliability requires the author to be both careful and honest, so that every retraction
8:257:19943:12:48:72:267:101:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:leads to negative updating about his quality.

9:261:20106:22:18:89:539:667:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The market learns about the agent’s reliability from observing his scientific output, and
9:262:20195:18:18:72:539:649:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:rewards the agent with citations based on his reputation. Letptdenote the market’s posterior
9:263:20287:18:18:72:539:631:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:belief that the agent is good, conditional on the output produced up to that time.4The flow
9:264:20378:18:19:72:540:613:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of citations to any of the agent’s papers at timetis given byw(pt), wherewis a strictly
9:265:20465:19:18:72:540:594:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:increasing and twice differentiable function.  In other words,  the citations received by the
9:266:20558:18:18:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:agent’s body of work are a function of the market’s belief that his reliability is high, based
9:267:20652:18:18:72:540:558:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:on  his  output  history.   Rewards  for  reputation  are  highly  nonlinear  in  our  database  (see
9:268:20753:18:39:72:539:540:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f7:B:Figure 7), where the distribution of citations is heavily skewed towards “superstar” agents.5

9:270:20876:31:18:72:540:470:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:The market learns about the agent’s reliability through retractions that we model as a Poisson
9:271:20970:18:18:72:539:452:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:process.  The intensity of the Poisson process is higher for low-reliability (bad) agents.6Thus,
9:272:21066:18:18:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:retractions  are  rare,  publicly  observable  events  that  reveal  information  about  an  agent’s
9:273:21166:18:18:72:540:416:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:reliability.  As our interest lies in the comparison across rather than within retracted papers,
9:274:21262:18:18:72:540:398:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:we assume that a retraction is an equally informative signal for every identifiable author of
9:275:21355:18:18:72:540:380:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:a retracted paper.  The consequences of this signal, however, vary with each author’s prior
9:276:21446:18:23:72:231:362:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:reputation, as described below.
9:277:21477:23:18:89:540:339:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:More formally, retraction events for an agent of typeθare exponentially distributed with
9:278:21565:18:18:72:539:321:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:parameterλθ, where we assume thatλB≥λG≥0.  Under this learning model, the agent’s
9:279:21646:18:18:72:539:303:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:reputation  at  each  timetis  measured  by  the  market’s  beliefpt.   Figure  2  illustrates  the
9:280:21745:18:23:72:439:285:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:dynamics of reputation through a sample path generated by our model.
9:281:21813:23:18:89:539:262:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:As  Figure  2  shows,  the  market’s  posterior  beliefptdrifts  upward  in  the  absence  of  a
9:282:21909:18:18:72:540:244:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:retraction.  Upon observing a retraction, the market belief jumps downward.  The magnitude
9:283:21999:18:18:72:540:226:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of  this  jump  is  related  to  the  agent’s  reputation  levelptat  the  timetof  the  retraction.
9:284:22099:18:12:85:519:208:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:4A sample path that illustrates the dynamics of posterior beliefs in our model is shown in Figure 2.
9:285:22199:12:15:85:539:196:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:5We have chosen not to model the agent’s actions explicitly, as our data is not sufficiently rich to identify
9:286:22308:15:12:72:540:181:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:a model with both incomplete information and moral hazard.  However,  both the agent’s output and the
9:287:22409:12:12:72:540:169:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:market’s reward can be endogenized in the model through a choice of (unobserved) retraction-reducing effort.
9:288:22517:12:12:72:540:157:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:This suggests a version of the career concerns model of Holmstr ̈om (1999) that allows for lumpy output and
9:289:22624:12:8:72:470:145:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:coarse signals, similar to Board and Meyer-ter-Vehn (2013) or Bonatti and H ̈orner (2017a).
9:290:22715:8:16:85:539:137:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:6This  type  of  Poisson  process  is  analogous  to  the  models  in  Bonatti  and  H ̈orner  (2017b)  and  Halac

11:347:24340:35:18:89:539:484:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:As Figure 3 shows, the negative effect of a retraction is a nonlinear function of the agent’s
11:348:24433:18:19:71:539:466:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:prior reputation:  forp= 0 andp= 1, the market’s prior belief is so strong that no signal
11:349:24522:19:18:71:539:447:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:can affect it.  In contrast, when the market is very uncertain about the agent, the reputation
11:350:24616:18:22:71:538:429:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:change is large:  the loss−∆(p,α) is greatest for an agent with an intermediate reputation.
11:351:24707:22:18:89:539:407:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We now turn to the comparative statics of reputation losses with respect to the informa-
11:352:24795:18:18:71:539:389:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:tiveness of the signal. We are particularly interested in whether a more informative signal has
11:353:24890:18:19:71:539:371:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:a larger effect on agents with higher prior reputations. Proposition 1 collects our comparative
11:354:24985:19:35:71:144:352:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:statics results.
11:355:25001:35:27:71:520:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f6:C:Proposition 1 (Signal Informativeness)As the signal informativenessαincreases:
11:356:25079:27:25:85:409:290:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:1.  retractions yield greater reputation losses for all values ofp;
11:357:25146:25:31:85:508:265:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:2.  reputation losses are increasing in the prior reputation only for low values ofp.
11:358:25231:31:18:89:539:234:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Part (1) establishes that∂∆(p,α)/∂α <0 for allp.  This result is intuitive:  if signals are
11:359:25322:18:18:71:540:216:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:uninformative (α= 1), then ∆ (p,1) = 0 for allp.  Conversely, if signals become arbitrarily
11:360:25413:18:18:71:539:198:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:informative  (α→ ∞),  then  ∆ (p,α)→ −p.   Part  (2)  shows  that  the  interaction  effect
11:361:25504:18:18:71:540:180:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f4:B:∂2∆(p,α)/∂α∂p <0 if and only ifp < α/(1 +α).  This effect follows a similar logic to the
11:362:25592:18:18:71:540:162:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f4:B:levelof  reputation  losses.   For  agents  with  sufficiently  high  reputation  levels,  the  market
11:363:25694:18:18:71:539:144:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:essentially  attributes  a  retraction  to  “chance,”  which  also  dampens  the  negative  effect  of
11:364:25796:18:18:71:539:126:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:greater  signal  precision.As  signals  become  arbitrarily  informative,  the  negative  effect  of  a
11:365:25899:18:19:71:540:108:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:retraction  becomes  increasing  inpon  (0,1).   Moreover,  an  increase  in  signal  precision  is
11:366:25998:19:36:71:539:89:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:most damaging to the agents with the highest reputation.  However, for any finite level of

12:371:26252:30:18:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:We now turn to the average effect of retractions across a population of heterogeneous agents.
12:372:26345:18:19:72:539:602:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:We consider a population of agentsiwhose reputationspiare uniformly distributed,  i.e.,
12:373:26432:19:18:72:540:583:12:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f4:B:F(pi) =pi.  This is consistent with our empirical approach in Section 5, where we use the
12:374:26521:18:22:72:539:565:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f7:B:quantiles of the distribution of citations and funding as proxies for a scientist’s reputation.7
12:375:26617:22:18:89:539:543:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:In order to compare the average effect of a retraction on the citations of scientists with
12:376:26707:18:18:72:540:525:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:high and low initial reputations, we partition the population of agentsiin two groups, and we
12:377:26800:18:19:72:540:507:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:aggregate the reputation losses at the group level.  We assume that the parameters (λB,λG)
12:378:26890:19:18:72:539:488:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of the Poisson process governing the occurrence of retractions are common to all agentsi.
12:379:26979:18:18:72:540:470:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:We then compare the average effect of a retraction in each group.  In particular, for a given

12:394:27274:38:19:89:539:309:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We now study the gap in the reputation losses of the two groups as a function of the
12:395:27358:19:29:71:451:290:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:signal’s informativeness.  We define the gap in reputation losses as follows:

12:397:27463:30:33:72:459:231:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:We then obtain the result in Proposition 2, which is illustrated in Figure 4.

12:400:27653:33:18:89:539:147:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:As  Figure  4  shows,  an  increase  in  the  informativeness  of  the  retraction  signalαmay

13:420:28284:23:18:89:539:442:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Viewed in the light of this result, our main empirical findings—that high-status agents
13:421:28371:18:18:72:540:424:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:after a retraction due to misconduct suffer the sharpest drop in reputation, while the three
13:422:28463:18:18:72:540:406:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:other reputation losses are of comparable magnitude to one another—are consistent with a

13:425:28664:23:18:89:539:347:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:It  may  be  useful  to  illustrate  the  differences  between  our  paper  and  the  one  in  Jin

13:427:28866:18:18:72:540:311:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:can  explain  the  finding  of  Jin  et  al.   (2013)  that  established  authors  (with  a  very  high

13:429:29060:18:18:72:540:275:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:uncertainty  still  looms  large).   However,  our  model  also  implies  that  more  drastic  events,
13:430:29162:18:18:72:540:257:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:such as simultaneous retractions of multiple papers due to a case of misconduct, would cause
13:431:29254:18:18:72:540:239:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:more  severe  reputation  losses  for  more  established  coauthors,  reversing  the  above  result.
13:432:29354:18:18:72:540:221:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Unfortunately, such major events are excluded from the sample in Jin et al.  (2013).  In this
13:433:29447:18:23:72:447:203:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:sense, their paper focuses on retraction events of limited informativeness.
13:434:29522:23:18:89:539:180:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We conclude this section by deriving implications for the effect of retractions on the flow
13:435:29613:18:18:72:540:162:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of citations.  Consider an agent with initial reputationpi.  In order to correctly capture the
13:436:29707:18:18:72:540:144:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:effect of a retraction, we must consider two elements: the shape of the rewards for reputation
13:437:29801:18:15:85:539:126:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:8For ease of exposition, we interpret the comparative statics with respect to the signal informativeness

14:457:30812:34:18:72:540:386:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:This section details the construction of our multilevel, panel dataset.  We begin by describing
14:458:30907:18:18:72:540:368:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the criteria used to select the sample of retracted scientists and how we identified their career
14:459:31004:18:19:72:540:350:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:and publication histories.  Next, we present the outcome variables used in the study, as well
14:460:31097:19:18:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:as our classification of retraction type and author prestige.  The last step is to explicate the
14:461:31193:18:18:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:process through which a sample of control authors—faculty members who did not experience
14:462:31281:18:30:72:502:295:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:a retraction event, but are otherwise similar to the retracted authors—was selected.
14:463:31365:30:18:72:539:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:B:Retractions,  retracted authors,  and career histories.In order to build our sample
14:464:31448:18:18:72:540:247:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of retracted authors and their publication histories, we begin with a set of 1,129 retractions
14:465:31542:18:18:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:published in the period 1977-2007, and retracted prior to 2009.  The source of these retrac-
14:466:31634:18:18:72:539:211:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:tions isPubMed, the United States National Library of Medicine’s (NLM) primary database
14:467:31721:18:18:72:539:193:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:for biomedical and life science publications.PubMedcontains more than 24 million citations
14:468:31811:18:23:72:475:175:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:and indexes articles along a number of dimensions, including retraction status.
14:469:31890:23:18:89:540:152:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The  critical  ingredient  in  the  construction  of  our  dataset  is  thebibliomefor  each  re-
14:470:31987:18:18:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:tracted author,i.e., an exhaustive and accurate list of articles published by these authors.
14:471:32079:18:18:72:540:116:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:A perennial challenge in collecting author-specific publication data is name disambiguation,
14:472:32171:18:45:72:540:98:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:since bibliographic databases such asPubMedandWeb of Sciencedo not typically include

15:474:32257:0:19:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:individual  author  identifiers.   A  related  paper  by  Lu  et  al.   (2013)  uses  self-citation  link-
15:475:32363:19:18:72:540:689:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:ages (starting with the retracted paper) to build author publication histories; this approach
15:476:32456:18:18:72:540:671:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f6:B:has the advantage that it is automated, scalable, and effectively deals with errors ofcom-
15:477:32546:18:18:71:539:653:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f4:B:mission—mistakenly attributing publications authored by a namesake to the focal author.
15:478:32633:18:18:71:539:635:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:However, it is much less effective in warding off errors ofomission, especially when scientists
15:479:32728:18:18:71:539:617:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:have multiple streams of work that are not connected through self-citation.  In our view, this
15:480:32822:18:18:71:539:599:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:limitation argues against the use of an automated approach:  using authors’ prior work that
15:481:32913:18:18:71:539:581:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:falls outside the line of research culminating in a retraction can help us distinguish between
15:482:33007:18:18:71:539:563:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the  punishment  meted  out  to  individual  scientists  from  the  loss  of  intellectual  credibility
15:483:33110:18:18:71:539:545:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:suffered by the specific ideas associated with the retraction.  This concern leads us to invest
15:484:33205:18:18:71:539:527:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:in  the  labor-intensive  process  of  disambiguating  publication  histories  manually.   This  is  a
15:485:33307:18:18:71:539:509:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:rate-limiting step for our empirical approach, and it has implications for the way in which
15:486:33398:18:23:71:262:491:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:we select control authors (see below).
15:487:33436:23:18:89:539:468:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:First, we carefully matched retracted authors to the Faculty Roster of the Association
15:488:33522:18:18:71:539:450:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), to which we secured licensed access for the years
15:489:33608:18:18:71:539:432:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:1975 through 2006, and which we augmented using NIH grantee information (cf.  Azoulay et
15:490:33696:18:18:71:540:414:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:al.  [2010] for more details).9Whenever the authors we identified in this way were trainees
15:491:33787:18:18:71:539:396:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:(graduate students or postdoctoral fellows) at the time of the retraction event, we excluded
15:492:33879:18:18:71:540:378:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:them from the sample.10See Appendix B for a full description of the process of matching
15:493:33966:18:23:71:257:360:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:author names to the Faculty Roster.
15:494:34001:23:18:89:539:337:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:We  were  able  to  match  at  least  one  author  on  43%  of  the  retracted  publications  to
15:495:34097:18:18:71:539:319:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:scientists in the AAMC Faculty Roster.  While this figure may seem low, it is a reflection of
15:496:34190:18:18:71:539:301:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the fact that the majority of the retractions are authored by non-US scientists who would
15:497:34279:18:18:71:539:283:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:not, by definition, be expected to appear in the AAMC Faculty Roster.  The match rate for
15:498:34368:18:18:71:539:265:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:American scientists is much higher.  Of the 488 retractions with US reprint addresses,  we
15:499:34458:18:18:71:539:247:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:matched at least one author on 412 (84%) of the publications.  The matching process yielded
15:500:34549:18:18:71:539:229:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:195 retractions with one author matched, 148 retractions with two authors matched, and 146
15:501:34639:18:18:71:539:211:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:retractions with three or more authors matched.  Since many of these authors are involved
15:502:34728:18:16:85:539:193:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:9An important implication of our reliance on these source of data is that we can only identify authors
15:503:34830:16:12:72:540:177:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:who are faculty members in U.S. medical schools, or recipient of NIH funding.  Unlike Lu et al.  (2013), we
15:504:34937:12:12:72:540:165:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:cannot identify trainees, staff scientists without a faculty position, scientists working for industrial firms, or
15:505:35051:12:12:72:540:153:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:scientists employed in foreign academic institutions.  The great benefit of using these data, however, is that
15:506:35161:12:12:72:540:141:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:they ensure we know quite a bit about the individuals we are able to identify:  their (career) age, type of
15:507:35268:12:8:72:272:129:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:degree awarded, place of employment, gender.
15:508:35312:8:16:81:539:121:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:10We do so because these trainees-turned-faculty members are selected in a non-random fashion from the
15:509:35414:16:52:72:391:105:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:entire population of trainees which we cannot get systematic data about.

16:512:35589:19:18:72:540:689:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the  sample.   As  in  Azoulay  et  al.   (2015),  our  analyses  exclude  the  202  retraction  cases
16:513:35691:18:18:72:540:671:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:where the retracted paper’s claims remain valid after the retraction event (i.e., most—but
16:514:35781:18:18:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:not all—cases of plagiarism, duplication of publications, faulty IRB approval, etc.).11From
16:515:35872:18:18:71:539:635:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:this sample of retractions, we matched a total of 376 retracted faculty authors.  For more
16:516:35962:18:23:71:388:617:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:information on the author matching process, see Appendix B.
16:517:36021:23:18:89:539:594:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Once  matched  to  the  AAMC  Faculty  Roster,  we  linked  authors  to  their  publication
16:518:36112:18:18:71:540:576:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:histories by developing detailedPubMedsearch queries that return the author’s entire body
16:519:36201:18:18:71:539:558:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of work.  Figure 5 illustrates this process for the case of one faculty member, Kirk E. Sperber,
16:520:36297:18:18:71:539:540:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:MD. This process allowed us to identify author publication histories while carefully removing
16:521:36390:18:18:71:539:522:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:papers belonging to other authors with similar or identical names,  and reliably capturing
16:522:36480:18:30:71:280:504:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f7:B:the full set of a scientist’s publications.12

16:524:36612:18:18:71:539:456:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:citations to authors’ publications in the sample.  Citations are both a measure of intellectual
16:525:36707:18:18:71:539:438:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:credit and professional attention.  Scientists cite prior work in order to communicate where
16:526:36799:18:18:71:539:420:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:their contributions fall within their field or subfield,  and to bestow credit to the research
16:527:36893:18:18:71:539:402:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:they are building upon.  Citations also serve as the currency that is essential to maintaining
16:528:36987:18:18:71:539:384:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the  incentives  and  norms  that  compel  honest  work  and  competition  in  science  (Merton
16:529:37082:18:18:71:539:366:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:1957).13We follow in the footsteps of prior scholarship in the economics of science in using
16:530:37174:18:18:71:539:348:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:an  information  shock  to  trace  out  the  effect  of  this  shock  on  the  citation  trajectories  of
16:531:37279:18:18:71:539:330:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:scientific articles published before the shock (e.g., Furman and Stern 2011;  Azoulay et al.
16:532:37371:18:23:71:102:312:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:2015).
16:533:37377:23:18:89:540:289:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f5:A:SincePubMeddoes not provide citation data, we use Thomson-Reuters’Web of Science

16:536:37635:18:12:81:527:235:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:11We verified that including these retractions in the sample does not materially affect our conclusions.
16:537:37739:12:16:81:539:223:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:12This  manual  process  is  made  possible  by  the  construction  of  a  dossier  on  each  author,  based  on  a

16:541:38161:8:15:81:539:175:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:13Citations can also be used for less noble purposes such as appeasing editors and reviewers by adding
16:542:38263:15:12:72:540:160:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:citations, or making larger claims by reducing the number of citations.  It is a limitation of our study that
16:543:38372:12:12:72:540:148:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:we do not have the ability to determine which cites are “strategic” rather than “substantive” (cf.  Lampe
16:544:38477:12:83:72:370:136:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:[2012] for examples of such strategic citation in the case of patents).

17:556:39389:18:18:72:540:510:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:mistakes,  we used the misconduct codes assigned to retractions in Azoulay et al.  (2015).
17:557:39479:18:18:72:540:492:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:These codes required manual review of every retraction and their associated public docu-

17:560:39755:18:18:72:540:438:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:due to misconduct and mistakes is often quite stark:  misconduct retractions include cases

17:562:39933:18:23:72:285:402:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f7:B:frequent reasons for mistake retractions.15
17:563:39976:23:18:89:539:379:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Importantly, we do not assume that misconduct events provide stronger evidence regard-
17:564:40062:18:18:72:540:361:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:ing an author’s reliability, relative to mistakes.  Instead, our empirical specifications allow
17:565:40157:18:18:72:540:343:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the market response to depend on the type of event in a flexible fashion.  Certainly, instances
17:566:40252:18:18:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of fraud and misconduct attract much more attention in the comment sections of specialized
17:567:40342:18:18:72:539:307:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:blogs such asRetractionWatch, while retractions due to mistakes tend to be less sensational.
17:568:40434:18:18:72:540:289:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:We  comment  on  the  relationship  between  misconduct  and  publicity  when  discussing  our
17:569:40528:18:16:72:173:271:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:results in Section 6.
17:570:40549:16:15:81:540:255:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:14In a separate analysis, available from the authors, we found that citations fromPubMed-indexed articles
17:571:40654:15:12:71:540:240:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:toPubMed-indexed  articles  that  are  also  in  the  Web  of  Science  account  for  86%  of  the  total  number  of
17:572:40771:12:12:71:539:228:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:citations that are received by these articles in a sample of 320,000 articles carefully matched between the
17:573:40878:12:12:71:539:216:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:two sources of data.  The correlation betweenPubMed-to-PubMedcitations andWoS-to-PubMedcitations
17:574:40974:12:12:71:539:204:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:is higher than .99.  We conclude that our decision to focus on thePubMed-to-PubMedcitation information
17:575:41076:12:8:71:303:192:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:for the analyses presented in this paper is innocuous.
17:576:41130:8:16:81:539:184:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:15The case of anesthesiologist Scott Reuben is a clear-cut example of retractions due to misconduct.  As
17:577:41234:16:12:71:539:168:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:a professor at Tufts University purportedly running clinical trials on the effectiveness of painkillers, Reuben
17:578:41345:12:12:71:539:156:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:was charged with and found guilty of health care fraud, resulting in a sentence of six months in federal prison
17:579:41456:12:12:71:539:144:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:and over $400,000 in fines and restitution.  Our retractions data set contains 15 of his publications, many
17:580:41563:12:12:71:539:132:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:of which were simultaneously retracted.  Instead, an example of a “honest mistake” consists of the authors
17:581:41669:12:12:71:539:120:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:retracting a publication after realizing that they mistakenly analyzed the genetic code of a butterfly rather
17:582:41778:12:12:71:539:108:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:than a dragonfly (Arikawa et al.  1996).  Occasionally, authors also retract papers due to flawed interpretation
17:583:41890:12:43:71:317:96:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:of results, or conclusions nullified by subsequent studies.

18:585:41951:0:19:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:B:Measures of author prestige.The seminal work of Merton (1968) alerted scholars that
18:586:42034:19:18:72:540:689:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:recognition and rewards for a given level of achievement are more likely to accrue to scientists
18:587:42130:18:18:72:540:671:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:whose reputation was already established, a phenomenon known as the “Matthew Effect.”
18:588:42215:18:18:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:As pointed out by Jin et al.  (2013), the retraction phenomenon presents an opportunity to
18:589:42305:18:18:72:540:635:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:ask whether the Matthew Effect also operates in reverse, that is, whether more prominent
18:590:42393:18:18:72:540:617:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:are  penalized  more  harshly  by  the  scientific  community  in  the  wake  of  a  retraction  than
18:591:42494:18:18:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:their less-distinguished peers.  In their work, Jin et al.  (2013) choose to operationalize prior
18:592:42591:18:18:72:540:581:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:prestige using authorship position on the retracted article.  Given the prevailing authorship
18:593:42684:18:18:72:540:563:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:norms in most of natural and life sciences, this approach effectively distinguishes between
18:594:42775:18:18:72:539:545:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:high and low-status scientistswithina research team (i.e., graduate student or postdoctoral
18:595:42866:18:23:72:338:527:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:fellow vs.  faculty member or principal investigator).
18:596:42920:23:18:89:539:504:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Because we have at our disposal detailed career and publication histories for each of the
18:597:43009:18:18:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:scientists in our sample, we adopt a strategy to measure variation in prior prestige that is
18:598:43101:18:18:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:more global in nature.  In a first analysis,  we compute each matched author’s cumulative
18:599:43190:18:18:72:540:450:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:citation count, across all of their publications, through the year before their first retraction.
18:600:43287:18:18:72:540:432:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:We define “high-status” scientists as those authors who belong in the top quartile of this
18:601:43377:18:18:72:540:414:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:citation  distribution  at  baseline,  and  those  whose  cumulative  citations  place  them  in  the
18:602:43478:18:18:72:540:396:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:bottom three quartiles as “low-status.”  Using this measure, high-status scientists account
18:603:43569:18:18:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:for  58%  of  all  of  the  articles  published  by  retracted  authors  up  to  the  year  of  their  first
18:604:43677:18:23:72:125:360:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:retraction.
18:605:43688:23:18:89:539:337:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:In a second analysis, we also compute cumulative funding from the National Institutes
18:606:43773:18:18:72:540:319:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of Health (NIH). Again, we defined high-status authors as those in the top quartile of the
18:607:43863:18:18:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:corresponding distribution at baseline, and low-status authors as those in the bottom three
18:608:43954:18:18:72:540:283:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:quartiles.  The high-funding group accounts for 47% of all the articles published by retracted
18:609:44048:18:30:72:317:265:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f7:B:authors up to the year of their first retraction.16
18:610:44099:30:18:72:539:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:B:Identifying and selecting control authors.To shed light on the counterfactual citation
18:611:44185:18:18:72:540:217:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:trajectories of retracted authors’ pre-retraction publications, we need to assemble a set of
18:612:44277:18:18:72:540:199:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:control authors.  The most direct approach to identifying controls would be to select from
18:613:44367:18:19:72:540:181:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the  population  of  scientists  those  whose  flows  and  stocks  of  publications  best  mirror  the
18:614:44469:19:18:72:540:162:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:corresponding  flows  and  stocks  for  retracted  authors,  as  in  Jin  et  al.   (2013).   However,
18:615:44571:18:16:81:539:144:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:16We  also  used  average  citations  per  publication  and  average  yearly  funding  as  measures  of  prestige,
18:616:44685:16:12:72:540:128:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:and the results were similar to those we present below.  We considered using membership in the National
18:617:44788:12:11:72:540:116:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:Academy of Sciences (NAS) as an additional measure of author prestige.  However, this measure did not give
18:618:44894:11:12:72:540:105:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:us enough power to perform our analysis as only 3.6% of the authors in our sample were members of the
18:619:44995:12:40:72:145:93:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:NAS at baseline.
18:620:45011:40:0:300:312:53:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:16
19:621:45013:0:19:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:this direct approach is infeasible, since we do not have at our disposal name-disambiguated
19:622:45104:19:18:72:540:689:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:bibliomes for every individual in the AAMC Faculty Roster.  Instead, we follow an indirect
19:623:45194:18:18:72:539:671:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:approach that enables us to delineate,ex ante, a much smaller set of potential control authors
19:624:45288:18:18:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:that we expect to exhibit productivity profiles comparable to that of the retracted authors,
19:625:45380:18:18:72:539:635:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:at least on average.  The onus will be on us to demonstrate,ex post, that treated and control
19:626:45473:18:23:72:494:617:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:authors are well-balanced along demographic characteristics and output measures.
19:627:45553:23:18:89:539:594:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Specifically, we focus on the authorship roster of the articles immediately preceding and
19:628:45642:18:18:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:following  the  retracted  publication  in  the  same  journal/issue.   Using  adjacent  articles  to
19:629:45743:18:18:72:540:558:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:construct a control group for a set of treated articles is an approach pioneered by Furman
19:630:45833:18:18:72:539:540:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f7:B:and  Stern  (2011),  and  adopted  by  Furman  et  al.   (2012),  and  Azoulay  et  al.   (2015).17
19:631:45932:18:18:72:540:522:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:The procedure we follow mirrors in all respects the process we adopted to identify treated
19:632:46022:18:18:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:authors in the sample of retracted articles:  matching the authors to the faculty roster, then
19:633:46116:18:18:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:assembling detailed publication histories (see Appendix B and C). The final analytic sample
19:634:46207:18:18:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:includes  only  retracted  authors  for  whom  we  have  located  at  least  one  matched  control
19:635:46305:18:18:72:540:450:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:author.  In total, we have 759 such control authors.  Tables 1 and 2 demonstrate that the
19:636:46394:18:18:72:540:432:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:control  authors  selected  by  our  procedure  are  very  similar  to  the  retracted  authors  along
19:637:46496:18:23:72:430:414:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:multiple dimensions, a point to which we return in more detail below.
19:638:46565:23:18:89:539:391:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:One legitimate concern with this indirect approach to selecting control authors is that of
19:639:46655:18:18:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:contamination:  these immediately adjacent publications could be intellectually related, or
19:640:46746:18:18:72:540:355:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:their authors might have been competing for funding during the period leading up to the
19:641:46833:18:18:72:540:337:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:retraction.  If this were the case, then it is possible that the retraction event also affected the
19:642:46932:18:18:72:540:319:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:control author and the market’s perception of her work.  Fortunately, the data allows us to
19:643:47023:18:18:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:do more than speculate about the potential for contamination:  we can assess empirically the
19:644:47115:18:18:72:540:283:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:extent to which treated and control authors are related.  First, we use the PubMed Related
19:645:47205:18:18:72:540:265:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Citation  Algorithm  (see  Appendix  E  for  more  details)  to  ascertain  whether  the  retracted
19:646:47304:18:18:72:540:247:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:articles and their journal/issue neighbors are intellectually related.  We find this to be the
19:647:47398:18:18:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:case in only three instances.18Second, we check in NIH’s Compound Grant Applicant File
19:648:47484:18:19:72:540:211:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:whether treated/control author pairs compete directly for funding.  We found no instances
19:649:47573:19:18:72:540:192:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of author pairs who applied for funding from the same component institute within NIH and
19:650:47661:18:17:72:540:174:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:whose work was evaluated by the same review committee in a window of five years before
19:651:47747:17:16:81:539:157:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:17One  can  think  of  different  choices  to  identify  a  set  of  potential  control  authors,  including  choosing  a
19:652:47868:16:12:72:540:141:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:random  article  in  the  same  journal/issue  as  the  treated  article,  or  all  non-retracted  articles  in  the  same
19:653:47990:12:12:72:540:129:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:journal/issue.   In  past  work,  we  showed  that  there  is  very  little  difference  between  choosing  a  “random
19:654:48108:12:8:72:370:117:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:neighbor” as opposed to a “nearest neighbor” (Azoulay et al.  2015).
19:655:48176:8:16:81:539:109:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:18We select the articles twice-removed from the retracted publication in the table of contents in these three
19:656:48285:16:40:72:114:93:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:instances.

20:658:48297:0:19:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the retraction event.  Despite publishing in the same journal at the same time, we conclude
20:659:48388:19:18:72:540:689:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:that treated and control authors’ scientific trajectories are sufficiently distinct in intellectual
20:660:48487:18:18:72:540:671:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:space to ward off the specter of contamination between the treated and control groups.  At
20:661:48577:18:18:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the same time, the fact that they are part of the same broad labor market (faculty members
20:662:48667:18:18:72:540:635:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:in  US  Medical  Schools),  participate  in  the  same  broad  scientific  fields,  and  face  a  similar
20:663:48772:18:18:72:540:617:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:institutional  environment  entails  that  the  comparison  between  their  publications  and  the
20:664:48870:18:30:72:376:599:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:citations they garner over time is substantively meaningful.

20:678:50052:18:18:71:539:330:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:out  as  particularly  blameworthy.   The  assignment  of  blame  was  unambiguous  for  only  24

20:680:50236:18:18:71:539:294:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:are precisely the types of scientists that would be less likely to ever appear in the AAMC

20:682:50421:18:19:71:539:258:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:set of blamed authors is a proper subset of authors whose work was retracted because of
20:683:50508:19:18:71:539:239:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:misconduct;  in  our  data,  there  is  not  a  single  example  of  an  article  retracted  because  of
20:684:50612:18:18:71:539:221:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:a mistake which laid blame for the event at the feet of a specific member of the research
20:685:50701:18:18:71:539:203:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:team.  As a result,  while the “blamed” indicator variable is interesting from a descriptive
20:686:50793:18:18:71:358:185:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:standpoint, we will not use it in the rest of the analysis.

21:696:51522:18:18:72:540:635:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Figure 6).  Figure 7 provides evidence of the skew in the distribution of eminence at baseline,

21:709:52610:18:18:72:540:345:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of  these  publications  is  not  affected  by  subsequent  changes  to  the  research  environment.

21:713:52918:23:18:89:539:268:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:A maintained assumption in this approach is the absence of citation trends that might
21:714:53003:18:18:72:540:250:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:affect the pre-retracted articles of retracted authors, relative to control authors.  Preexisting

22:727:54114:18:18:72:540:635:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:contributed.  Indeed, prior work has shown that non-retracted articles related to the same

23:773:57775:18:30:72:540:362:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:to increase over time; it appears to be a permanent, and not merely transitory, phenomenon.
23:774:57866:30:18:72:540:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:B:Exploring heterogeneity in the retraction effect.We begin by splitting the sample
23:775:57947:18:18:72:540:314:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:into high- and low-status subgroups, first using cumulative citations as a marker of eminence
23:776:58040:18:18:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:(Table 3, columns 2a and 2b), second using cumulative funding (Table 3, columns 3a and 3b).
23:777:58131:18:18:72:540:278:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Since high-status authors tend to produce more publications, splitting the sample by separat-
23:778:58224:18:18:72:540:260:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:ing the top quartile of each status metric from its bottom three quartiles yields subsamples
23:779:58316:18:18:72:540:242:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of  approximately  equivalent  size.   We  cannot  detect  large  differences  in  the  magnitude  of
23:780:58417:18:18:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the treatment effects across these groupings.  Even in the case of funding, where there is a
23:781:58509:18:18:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:slightly larger difference in the post-retraction penalty for low-status faculty members (7.6%
23:782:58603:18:23:72:447:188:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:vs.  12.2% decrease), this difference is in itself not statistically significant.
23:783:58684:23:18:89:539:165:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:The next step is to split the sample by separating instances of misconduct from instances
23:784:58773:18:18:72:540:147:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of mere error (see Appendix D for the process of assigning misconduct and mistake coding).
23:785:58863:18:18:72:540:129:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:The  estimates  reported  in  columns  (4a)  and  (4b)  of  Table  3  do  suggest  a  much  stronger
23:786:58963:18:58:72:492:111:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:market response when misconduct or fraud are alleged (17.6% vs.  8.2% decrease).
23:787:59043:58:0:300:312:53:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:21
24:788:59045:0:19:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:C:Interaction  between  prior  eminence  and  the  informativeness  of  the  retraction
24:789:59130:19:18:72:540:689:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:B:event.Table  4  splits  the  sample  into  four  subgroups,  corresponding  to  both  the  status
24:790:59227:18:18:72:540:671:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:and  misconduct  dimensions.   One  result  stands  out  qualitatively:  the  high-status  authors
24:791:59325:18:18:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:are more harshly penalized than their less-distinguished peers, but only in instances of mis-
24:792:59418:18:18:72:540:635:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:conduct (columns 1b and 2b).  In all other subgroups, the differences in the magnitude of
24:793:59507:18:18:72:539:617:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the treatment effect are modest at best.21But are the differences in treatment effect across
24:794:59599:18:18:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:subgroups themselves statistically significant?  This is less clear, since our strategy of split-
24:795:59696:18:18:72:540:581:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:ting the overall data into four subgroups results in relatively noisy estimates for some of the
24:796:59791:18:18:72:540:563:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:subgroups.  An alternative is to pool the entire data and focus on the coefficients for the
24:797:59882:18:18:72:540:545:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:interaction effects corresponding to each subgroup.  Appendix G discusses these comparison
24:798:59972:18:18:72:540:527:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:challenges and deploys two different approaches to comparing magnitudes statistically.  Re-
24:799:60063:18:18:72:540:509:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:gardless of the approach chosen, the statistical tests support the main qualitative conclusion:
24:800:60158:18:18:72:540:491:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:high-status authors embroiled in misconduct cases are punished significantly more severely
24:801:60248:18:18:72:540:473:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:than high-status authors guilty of making a mistake resulting in a retraction.  The claim that
24:802:60342:18:18:72:540:455:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the high-status misconduct group’s penalty is greater than that of all the other subgroups is
24:803:60435:18:45:72:207:437:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:statistically more tenuous.
24:804:60462:45:35:72:189:392:17:g_d0_f3:17:g_d0_f3:C:6    Discussion
24:805:60477:35:18:72:540:357:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:B:Bayesian Learning.Three different comparisons bear directly on the suitability of our sim-
24:806:60567:18:18:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:ple Bayesian framework to explain the empirical patterns that emerge from the econometric
24:807:60656:18:23:72:115:321:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:analysis.
24:808:60665:23:18:89:539:298:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:First,  for  authors  of  any  status,  the  effect  of  a  retraction  due  to  misconduct  is  larger
24:809:60768:18:18:72:540:280:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:than the effect of a retraction due to mistake (Table 3, columns 4a and 4b).  This result is
24:810:60860:18:18:72:540:262:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:consistent with a model where a case of misconduct is more informative about an author’s
24:811:60948:18:22:72:539:244:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:reliability,i.e., a higherαin Proposition 1.  See Figure 3 for the intuition behind this result.
24:812:61044:22:19:89:539:222:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Second, the most significant effect of retractions occurs only after a misconduct event for
24:813:61135:19:18:71:539:203:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:authors in the top status quartile.  Citation penalties for all other event type/author status
24:814:61229:18:18:71:539:185:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:combinations have a lower and relatively homogeneous effect (Table 4).  The aggregate im-
24:815:61318:18:18:71:539:167:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:plications of our model match these regression results (see Figure 4 for a simple illustration).
24:816:61414:18:18:71:539:149:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:When a signal is very informative, it has a large impact on an author’s reputation, indepen-
24:817:61506:18:18:71:539:131:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:dently of its initial level.  The resulting loss of reputation is therefore largest for high-status
24:818:61605:18:15:81:539:113:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:21Appendix F shows that even after removing from the sample authors involved in multiple retractions
24:819:61705:15:44:72:402:98:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:across multiple years, these patterns continue to hold, at least qualitatively.
24:820:61784:44:0:300:312:54:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:22
25:821:61786:0:19:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:authors.  Conversely, when the signal is not particularly informative, the reputation loss is
25:822:61879:19:18:72:540:689:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:mostly  tied  to  the  initial  level  of  uncertainty.   This  is  highest  for  agents  with  intermedi-
25:823:61985:18:18:72:540:671:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:ate reputations, which explains why very high- and very-low status authors may experience
25:824:62074:18:22:72:213:653:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:similar drops in reputation.
25:825:62102:22:18:89:539:631:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Third, we can go one step beyond the binary distinction between high- and low-status au-
25:826:62190:18:19:72:540:613:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:thors.  We do not have sufficient statistical power to recover the full shapes of the reputation
25:827:62286:19:18:72:540:594:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:loss as characterized in our model, for example in Figure 3.  Instead, to generate the coeffi-
25:828:62380:18:18:72:539:576:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f7:B:cients graphed in Figure 9, we partition authors into quintiles of the status distribution.22
25:829:62473:18:18:72:540:558:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:We  then  contrast  the  effects  of  different  types  of  retraction  events  for  each  of  five  status
25:830:62580:18:18:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:grouping.  Figure 9, Panel A suggests that the largest drop in citations following a mistake
25:831:62672:18:18:72:540:522:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:occurs for scientists with intermediate reputation levels (the third quintile).  Conversely, the
25:832:62768:18:18:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:drop in citations following misconduct is largest for the highest-status scientists (fourth and
25:833:62863:18:23:72:263:486:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f7:B:fifth quintiles in Figure 9, Panel B).23
25:834:62903:23:18:89:539:463:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Together, these results suggest that the market response to a retraction event is consistent
25:835:62995:18:18:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:with Bayesian learning about the author’s reliability.  In particular, the distinct responses
25:836:63088:18:18:72:540:427:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:to mistakes and misconduct indicate that the market considers misconduct events as more
25:837:63175:18:18:72:540:409:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:precisely revealing the (low) quality of an individual scientist, relative to instances of “honest
25:838:63273:18:23:72:120:391:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:mistake.”
25:839:63282:23:18:89:539:368:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:From this standpoint,  the fact that the ratio of misconduct and mistake retractions is
25:840:63369:18:18:72:540:350:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:about the same for both high and low-status authors (Table 5) is an anomaly.  While high-
25:841:63458:18:18:72:540:332:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:status  scientists  experience  fewer  retractions  overall,  observing  a  mistake  vs.   misconduct
25:842:63559:18:18:72:540:314:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:retraction is not particularly helpful to predict the eminence of a retracted author.  If mis-
25:843:63653:18:18:72:540:296:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:conduct is a more informative signal, and high-status scientists are, in fact, more reliable on
25:844:63748:18:30:72:474:278:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:average, we would expect them to exhibit a lowermisconduct-to-mistakeratio.
25:845:63823:30:18:71:539:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:B:Market  overreaction.We  now  explore  three  distinct  explanations  for  the  discrepancy
25:846:63914:18:18:71:539:230:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:between  the  empirical  distribution  of  retraction  events  and  the  theory  consistent  with  an
25:847:64015:18:18:71:539:212:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:equilibrium market response, i.e., for why the market “overreacts” to instances of misconduct
25:848:64108:18:23:71:190:194:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:by high-status authors.
25:849:64131:23:18:89:539:171:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:It  is  possible  that  the  market  overestimates  the  informativeness  of  misconduct  events.
25:850:64228:18:18:71:539:153:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Under this interpretation, the outlook on the market’s ability to correctly “parse the truth”
25:851:64321:18:12:81:505:135:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:22In this case, status is only measured by cumulative citation count at the time of the retraction.
25:852:64420:12:15:81:539:123:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:23These statements must be interpreted with a great deal of caution, since the sample size is too small for
25:853:64527:15:12:72:540:108:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:these differences between coefficient estimates to be statistically significant.  We only mean to suggest that
25:854:64637:12:43:72:437:96:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:their overall pattern is consistent with the more nuanced implications of our model.
25:855:64721:43:0:300:312:53:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:23
26:856:64723:0:19:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:is  quite  bleak.   Quite  simply,  the  scientific  community  may  perceive  the  misconduct  (vs.
26:857:64823:19:18:72:540:689:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:mistake) signal as more revealing while, in fact, high-reliability authors cheat at a similar
26:858:64916:18:22:72:390:671:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:rate as low-reliability authors—they just retract fewer papers.
26:859:64979:22:18:89:539:649:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:However,  misconduct  retractions  come  closer  to  our  definition  of  scandal—a  suddenly
26:860:65072:18:18:72:540:631:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:publicized transgression.  Very few, if any, instances of retraction due to mere error lead to
26:861:65166:18:19:72:540:613:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:editorials, pontificating, or hand-wringing in scientific journals or the national press. Instead,
26:862:65264:19:18:72:540:594:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:much of the public attention to the retraction phenomenon can be attributed to a handful
26:863:65352:18:18:72:539:576:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of high-profile cases of scientific misconduct.24Thus,  an equally plausible explanation for
26:864:65444:18:18:72:539:558:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the discrepancy in responses is based onrational  inattention:  acquiring information about
26:865:65535:18:18:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:the validity of scientific results is costly, but it is relatively cheaper to learn about highly-
26:866:65632:18:18:72:540:522:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:publicized retractions.  This mechanism introduces a scale dimension to the market response,
26:867:65724:18:18:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:whereby a larger number of researchers are aware of fraud by famous authors, which leads
26:868:65812:18:23:72:294:486:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:to a proportionally larger drop in citations.
26:869:65857:23:18:89:539:463:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Finally, the citation penalty may represent more than just the market’s response to an
26:870:65943:18:18:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:information shock.  For instance,  it may be part of an implicit incentive scheme that sees
26:871:66034:18:18:72:540:427:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:ordinary scientists recoil from the prior work of scientists embroiled in scandal, particularly
26:872:66129:18:18:72:540:409:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:if they have achieved great fame.  That part of the punishment is carried out by giving less
26:873:66221:18:18:72:540:391:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:credit to the author’s earlier work makes sense especially if some of the citations accruing
26:874:66313:18:18:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:to  these  scientists  were  “ceremonial”  in  nature.   If  principal  investigators  can  control  the
26:875:66417:18:18:72:540:355:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:likelihood  of  their  team  making  a  mistake  or  explicitly  cheating,  then  this  stigmatization
26:876:66519:18:18:72:540:337:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:(whether  understood  as  a  deterrent  or  as  pure  sociological  mechanism  `a  la  Adut  [2005])

26:879:66681:34:18:72:544:240:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:The distribution of scientific recognition is a complex phenomenon. Disproportionate amounts
26:880:66773:18:19:72:540:222:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of credit are given to the very best authors in a field (Merton 1968), but these authors must
26:881:66866:19:18:72:540:203:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:maintain their reputation at a high level through consistent performance.  We have docu-
26:882:66954:18:18:72:540:185:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:mented the scientific community’s response to negative information shocks about a scientist’s
26:883:67047:18:18:72:539:167:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:past output.  The flow of credit (in the form of citations) responds to scandal (i.e., retractions
26:884:67145:18:16:81:539:149:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:24Stem  cell  science  has  been  rocked  by  two  especially  sensational  scandals.   The  first  was  the  case  of
26:885:67263:16:12:72:540:133:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:Woo-suk Hwang—the South Korean scientists who fabricated experiments and claimed to have successfully
26:886:67364:12:12:72:540:121:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:cloned human embryonic stem cells.  More recently, the media gave major coverage to the retraction of a
26:887:67467:12:12:72:540:109:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:stem cell paper that claimed to usse acid baths to turn mature cells into stem cells.  Tragically, one of the
26:888:67576:12:44:72:483:97:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:Japanese authors on the retracted paper, Yoshiki Sasai, committed suicide at his research lab.

27:890:67672:0:19:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:involving misconduct), all the more sharply when bad news involve an established member
27:891:67759:19:18:72:540:689:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of the profession.  Overall,  the community’s response is consistent with Bayesian learning
27:892:67850:18:18:72:540:671:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:under the assumptions that high-status scientists have a better initial reputation, and that
27:893:67942:18:22:72:434:653:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:misconduct is a more revealing signal, compared to an honest mistake.
27:894:68011:22:18:89:539:631:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:In our current approach,  we have taken the retraction-generating process as given.  In
27:895:68098:18:19:72:540:613:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:other  words,  we  do  not  attempt  to  construct  and  test  a  model  of  scientist  behavior  and
27:896:68199:19:18:72:540:594:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:market response to scandal, where the frequency and the consequences of a retraction are
27:897:68287:18:18:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:jointly determined in equilibrium.  With endogenous effort choices, incorporating drivers of
27:898:68379:18:18:72:540:558:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:incentives such as punishment schemes and career concerns would enhance our understanding
27:899:68468:18:18:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of the scientific reward system. The data currently available do not allow us to distinguish the
27:900:68564:18:18:72:540:522:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:effects of pure learning from those of more elaborate incentive schemes.  However, developing
27:901:68657:18:18:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:empirical tests capable of adjudicating their relative salience is a valuable objective for future
27:902:68755:18:23:72:178:486:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:research in this area.
27:903:68777:23:18:89:539:463:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:One limitation of looking at the retraction phenomenon through the prism of information
27:904:68864:18:18:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:revelation is that it sheds light on only a fraction of the private costs of false science — those
27:905:68962:18:18:72:540:427:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:narrowly associated with the prior work of the scientists embroiled in scandal.  But these
27:906:69052:18:18:72:540:409:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:scientists  bear  additional  costs  in  the  form  of  foregone  future  funding,  collaboration,  and
27:907:69155:18:18:72:540:391:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:publication opportunities.  Moreover, we cannot say anything definitive regarding the private
27:908:69248:18:18:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f4:B:benefitsof fraud or sloppiness,  because we only observe their consequences conditional on
27:909:69338:18:18:72:540:355:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:detection  by  the  scientific  community.   Furman  et  al.   (2012)  have  shown  that  retracted
27:910:69437:18:18:72:540:337:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:articles exhibit “excess” citations prior to retraction.25Therefore, it is reasonable to infer
27:911:69531:18:18:72:540:319:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:that undetected instances of false science confer on their authors enhanced prestige, as well as
27:912:69627:18:18:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:privileged access to tangible resources, such as editorial goodwill, better trainees, or state-
27:913:69722:18:18:72:540:283:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of-the-art  laboratory  equipment.   These  benefits  are  extremely  difficult  to  assess  without
27:914:69822:18:23:72:284:265:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:making a host of untestable assumptions.
27:915:69862:23:18:89:539:242:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:A troubling narrative is that prominent and powerful scientists escape major reputational
27:916:69951:18:18:72:540:224:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:damage following scientific misconduct scandals, while their junior colleagues shoulder most
27:917:70043:18:18:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of  blame.   For  example,  a  March  2017  New  York  Times  article  titled,  “Years  of  Ethics
27:918:70141:18:18:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Charges,  but  Star  Cancer  Researcher  Gets  a  Pass,”  reported  that  cancer  biologist  Carlo
27:919:70239:18:18:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:Croce  of  Ohio  State  University  had  avoided  any  official  sanctions  from  the  university  or
27:920:70340:18:18:72:540:152:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:federal agencies, despite multiple accusations of academic fraud.  Croce “largely placed the
27:921:70432:18:16:81:539:134:7:g_d0_f8:10:g_d0_f9:F:25When  false  science  persists  in  the  literature  without  retraction,  the  authors  reputations  benefit  from
27:922:70549:16:12:72:540:118:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:the additional credit for both productivity (one additional item on their CVs) and their abnormally large
27:923:70654:12:53:72:139:106:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:citation counts.
27:924:70670:53:0:300:312:53:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:25
28:925:70672:0:19:72:540:708:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:blame for any problems with figures or text on junior researchers or collaborators at other
28:926:70763:19:18:72:540:689:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:labs” (Glanz & Armendariz 2017).  This report fits the more general storyline of established
28:927:70855:18:22:72:391:671:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:professionals and executives skirting blame following scandals.
28:928:70918:22:18:89:539:649:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Jin  et  al.   (2017)  show  that  scandals  impact  the  reputations  of  early  career  scientists
28:929:71018:18:18:72:540:631:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:more than that of senior authors.  But our evidence speaks to reputation penalties across
28:930:71107:18:19:72:540:613:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:researchers who are in a similar career stage. Among scientists with established track records,
28:931:71202:19:18:72:540:594:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:we find that retraction events involving misconduct disproportionately hurts the reputation
28:932:71293:18:22:72:232:576:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:of the most prominent authors.
28:933:71323:22:18:89:539:554:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:Our findings do not imply that the scientific community currently has the optimal incen-
28:934:71411:18:18:72:540:536:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:tive system, but by showing the additional punishments for misconduct and revealing that
28:935:71499:18:19:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:senior scientists cannot escape blame, our results do speak against the jaundiced narrative
28:936:71590:19:18:72:540:499:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:that regards peer review as fundamentally undermined by hypercompetitiveness, fraud, and
28:937:71678:18:18:72:540:481:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:other forms of misconduct (Fang & Casadevall 2015).  Furthermore, the results highlight the
28:938:71769:18:18:72:540:463:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:importance of transparency in the retraction process itself.  Retraction notices often obfus-
28:939:71862:18:18:72:540:445:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:cate the difference between instances of “honest mistake” and scientific misconduct in order
28:940:71954:18:18:72:540:427:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:to avoid litigation risk or more rigorous fact-finding responsibilities.  In spite of this garbled
28:941:72052:18:18:72:540:409:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:information, our study reveals that the content and context of retraction events influences
28:942:72143:18:18:72:540:391:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:their fallout.  We surmise that more straightforward “findings of fact” published concurrently
28:943:72237:18:18:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:with a retraction notice would allow the scientific community to mete out punishment more
28:944:72326:18:302:72:456:355:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:B:effectively, thus buttressing the norms that govern the Republic of Science.

43:1435:92477:21:12:72:539:499:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:We assume that the misconduct signal is more informative of the agent’s low reliability, i.e.β > α.  Our
43:1436:92581:12:12:72:540:487:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:earlier Proposition 1 states that reputations suffer a larger drop following a retraction due to misconduct
43:1437:92688:12:21:72:163:475:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:than after a mistake.
43:1438:92709:21:12:72:540:454:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:Finally, Bayesian updating and rational expectations have testable implications for the distribution of re-

43:1440:92928:12:22:72:488:430:10:g_d0_f24:10:g_d0_f9:F:ptat each point in time, the arrival rate of a retraction for agents with reputationpis given by

43:1442:93050:22:12:72:540:386:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:It then follows that the distribution of retractions of different kinds is related to the current reputation level

45:1547:95752:12:12:72:540:581:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:and full career publication histories from prior work (see Azoulay et al.  2012).  We determined this set of
45:1548:95860:12:12:72:540:569:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:pre-matched  authors  by  identifying  any  relevant  source  publications  (retracted  or  control  articles)  in  the
45:1549:95979:12:21:72:383:557:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:validated career publications for our set of previously matched authors.
45:1550:96051:21:12:72:540:536:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:For the remaining unmatched retraction or control authors, we undertook an iterative process to determine
45:1551:96156:12:12:72:540:524:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:accurate matches in the augmented AAMC Faculty Roster.  As a first pass, we identified potential matches
45:1552:96260:12:12:72:540:512:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:using author names, and confirmed and matched those with only one possible match.  For those with common
45:1553:96364:12:12:72:540:500:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:names or multiple potential name matches, we used additional observable characteristics such as institution,
45:1554:96472:12:12:72:540:488:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:department, and degree to remove erroneous potential matches.  When multiple potential matches remained,
45:1555:96576:12:12:72:539:476:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:we compared the topic area of the retracted/control paper to the grant titles,PubMedpublication titles
45:1556:96678:12:12:71:539:464:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:and abstracts associated with author name and the AAMC Faculty Roster entry.  In these cases, we only
45:1557:96779:12:80:71:390:452:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:declared a match when the additional information made the choice clear.

46:1581:98755:12:12:72:540:684:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:suffix.  This makes it difficult to unambiguously assign publication output to individual scientists, especially
46:1582:98867:12:21:72:260:672:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:when their last name is relatively common.

46:1584:99011:12:12:72:540:639:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:large, since scientists are often inconsistent in the choice of names they choose to publish under.  By far the
46:1585:99122:12:12:72:540:627:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:most common source of error is the haphazard use of a middle initial.  Other errors stem from inconsistent

46:1593:99979:12:12:72:540:522:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:may  simply  require  a  name  and  date  range.   For  example,  scientist  Wilfred  A.  van  der  Donk  required  a

47:1648:105047:12:12:72:540:226:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:wanted to remove such papers to avoid contaminating our measurement of individual reputation effects with

47:1650:105264:12:21:72:474:202:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:we can also differentiate between citations coming from within vs.  outside a particular field.

48:1662:106412:12:12:72:540:684:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:[NLM]  controlled  vocabulary  thesaurus.   It  consists  of  sets  of  terms  naming  descriptors  in  a  hierarchical
48:1663:106531:12:12:72:540:672:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:structure  that  permits  searching  at  various  levels  of  specificity.   There  are  27,149  descriptors  in  the  2013
48:1664:106654:12:12:72:540:660:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:MeSH edition.  Almost every publication in PubMed is tagged with a set of MeSH terms (between 1 and
48:1665:106753:12:12:72:540:648:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:103 in the current edition of PubMed, with both the mean and median approximately equal to 11).  NLM’s
48:1666:106855:12:12:72:540:636:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:professional indexers are trained to select indexing terms from MeSH according to a specific protocol, and
48:1667:106961:12:12:72:540:624:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:consider each article in the context of the entire collection (Bachrach and Charen 1978; N ́ev ́eol et al.  2010).
48:1668:107075:12:12:72:540:612:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:What is key for our purposes is that the subjectivity inherent in any indexing task is confined to the MeSH

48:1670:107249:21:12:72:540:579:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:Using the MeSH keywords as input, PMRA essentially defines a distance concept in idea space such that

48:1672:107451:12:12:72:539:555:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:algorithm  focuses  on  the  smallest  neighborhood  in  this  space  that  includes  100  related  records.viThe
48:1673:107564:12:27:72:383:543:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:following paragraphs were extracted from a brief description of PMRA:
48:1674:107633:27:10:101:510:516:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:The  neighbors  of  a  document  are  those  documents  in  the  database  that  are  the  most  similar  to  it.  The  simi-
48:1675:107758:10:9:101:510:506:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:larity between documents is measured by the words they have in common, with some adjustment for document
48:1676:107862:9:10:101:510:497:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:lengths.   To  carry  out  such  a  program,  one  must  first  define  what  a  word  is.   For  us,  a  word  is  basically  an
48:1677:107991:10:9:101:510:487:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:unbroken  string  of  letters  and  numerals  with  at  least  one  letter  of  the  alphabet  in  it.  Words  end  at  hyphens,
48:1678:108119:9:10:101:510:478:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:spaces, new lines, and punctuation.  A list of 310 common, but uninformative, words (also known as stopwords)
48:1679:108228:10:9:101:510:468:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:are  eliminated  from  processing  at  this  stage.   Next,  a  limited  amount  of  stemming  of  words  is  done,  but  no
48:1680:108352:9:10:101:510:459:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:thesaurus  is  used  in  processing.  Words  from  the  abstract  of  a  document  are  classified  as  text  words.  Words
48:1681:108475:10:9:101:510:449:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:from  titles  are  also  classified  as  text  words,  but  words  from  titles  are  added  in  a  second  time  to  give  them  a
48:1682:108606:9:10:101:510:440:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:small advantage in the local weighting scheme.  MeSH terms are placed in a third category, and a MeSH term
48:1683:108712:10:9:101:510:430:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:with  a  subheading  qualifier  is  entered  twice,  once  without  the  qualifier  and  once  with  it.   If  a  MeSH  term  is
48:1684:108840:9:9:101:510:421:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:starred  (indicating  a  major  concept  in  a  document),  the  star  is  ignored.  These  three  categories  of  words  (or
48:1685:108965:9:10:101:510:412:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:phrases in the case of MeSH) comprise the representation of a document.  No other fields,  such as Author or
48:1686:109073:10:19:101:235:402:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:Journal, enter into the calculations.
48:1687:109110:19:9:101:510:383:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:Having obtained the set of terms that represent each document, the next step is to recognize that not all words
48:1688:109221:9:10:101:510:374:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:are  of  equal  value.   Each  time  a  word  is  used,  it  is  assigned  a  numerical  weight.   This  numerical  weight  is
48:1689:109347:10:9:101:510:364:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:based on information that the computer can obtain by automatic processing.  Automatic processing is important
48:1690:109456:9:10:101:510:355:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:because the number of different terms that have to be assigned weights is close to two million for this system.
48:1691:109567:10:9:101:510:345:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:The weight or value of a term is dependent on three types of information:  1) the number of different documents
48:1692:109678:9:10:101:510:336:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:in the database that contain the term;  2) the number of times the term occurs in a particular document;  and
48:1693:109787:10:9:101:510:326:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:3) the number of term occurrences in the document.  The first of these pieces of information is used to produce
48:1694:109898:9:10:101:510:317:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:a number called the global weight of the term.  The global weight is used in weighting the term throughout the
48:1695:110008:10:9:101:510:307:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:database.  The  second  and  third  pieces  of  information  pertain  only  to  a  particular  document  and  are  used  to
48:1696:110131:9:10:101:510:298:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:produce  a  number  called  the  local  weight  of  the  term  in  that  specific  document.   When  a  word  occurs  in  two
48:1697:110256:10:9:101:510:288:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:documents, its weight is computed as the product of the global weight times the two local weights (one pertaining
48:1698:110369:9:19:101:200:279:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:to each of the documents).
48:1699:110395:19:9:101:510:260:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:The global weight of a term is greater for the less frequent terms.  This is reasonable because the presence of a
48:1700:110508:9:10:101:510:251:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:term that occurred in most of the documents would really tell one very little about a document.  On the other
48:1701:110617:10:9:101:510:241:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:hand,  a  term  that  occurred  in  only  100  documents  of  one  million  would  be  very  helpful  in  limiting  the  set  of
48:1702:110745:9:10:101:510:232:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:documents  of  interest.  A  word  that  occurred  in  only  10  documents  is  likely  to  be  even  more  informative  and
48:1703:110869:10:19:101:229:222:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:will receive an even higher weight.
48:1704:110904:19:9:101:510:203:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:The  local  weight  of  a  term  is  the  measure  of  its  importance  in  a  particular  document.   Generally,  the  more
48:1705:111028:9:10:101:510:194:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:frequent a term is within a document,  the more important it is in representing the content of that document.
48:1706:111137:10:9:101:510:184:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:However, this relationship is saturating, i.e., as the frequency continues to go up, the importance of the word
48:1707:111248:9:10:101:510:175:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:increases less rapidly and finally comes to a finite limit.  In addition, we do not want a longer document to be
48:1708:111360:10:25:101:444:165:8:g_d0_f52:8:g_d0_f52:F:considered more important just because it is longer; therefore, a length correction is applied.

48:1711:111583:7:13:82:539:120:7:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f7:F:viHowever, the algorithm embodies a transitivity rule as well as a minimum distance cutoff rule, such that the effective number
48:1712:111710:13:10:72:540:107:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:of related articles returned by PMRA varies between 58 and 2,097 in the larger sample of 3,071 source articles published by the
48:1713:111837:10:44:72:487:97:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:451 star scientists in the five years preceding their death.  The mean is 185 related articles, and the median 141.

49:1721:112544:30:12:72:539:630:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:To summarize, PMRA is a modern implementation ofco-word analysis, a content analysis technique that
49:1722:112643:12:12:72:540:618:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:uses patterns of co-occurrence of pairs of items (i.e., title words or phrases, or keywords) in a corpus of texts
49:1723:112756:12:12:72:540:606:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:to identify the relationships between ideas within the subject areas presented in these text (Callon et al. 1989;
49:1724:112869:12:12:72:540:594:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:He 1999).  One long-standing concern among practitioners of this technique has been the “indexer effect”
49:1725:112973:12:12:72:540:582:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:(Whittaker 1989).  Clustering algorithm such as PMRA assume that the scientific corpus has been correctly
49:1726:113078:12:11:72:540:570:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:indexed.  But what if the indexers who chose the keywords brought their own “conceptual baggage” to the
49:1727:113181:11:12:72:540:559:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:indexing task, so that the pictures that emerge from this process are more akin to their conceptualization
49:1728:113287:12:21:72:369:547:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:than to those of the scientists whose work it was intended to study?
49:1729:113355:21:12:72:540:526:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:Indexer effects could manifest themselves in three distinct ways.  First, indexers may have available a lexicon
49:1730:113466:12:12:72:540:514:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:of permitted keywords which is itself out of date.  Second, there is an inevitable delay between the publication
49:1731:113578:12:12:72:540:502:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:of an article and the appearance of an entry in PubMed.  Third, indexers, in their efforts to be helpful to users
49:1732:113691:12:12:72:540:490:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:of the database, may use combinations of keywords which reflect the conventional views of the field.  The first
49:1733:113802:12:12:72:540:478:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:two concerns are legitimate, but probably have only a limited impact on the accuracy of the relationships
49:1734:113907:12:12:72:540:466:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:between  articles  which  PMRA  deems  related.   This  is  because  the  NLM  continually  revises  and  updates
49:1735:114020:12:12:72:540:454:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:the  MeSH  vocabulary,  precisely  in  an  attempt  to  neutralize  keyword  vintage  effects.   Moreover,  the  time
49:1736:114137:12:12:72:540:442:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:elapsed  between  an  article’s  publication  and  the  indexing  task  has  shrunk  dramatically,  though  time  lag
49:1737:114254:12:12:72:540:430:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:issues might have been a first-order challenge when MeSH was crated, back in 1963.  The last concern strikes
49:1738:114362:12:12:72:540:418:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:us as being potentially more serious; a few studies have asked authors to validate ex post the quality of the
49:1739:114471:12:12:72:540:406:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:keywords selected by independent indexers, with generally encouraging results (Law and Whittaker 1992).
49:1740:114574:12:80:72:315:394:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:Inter-indexer reliability is also very high (Wilbur 1998).

49:1743:114690:34:12:72:540:258:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:In the analyses presented in the main body of the manuscript, we use the retracted authors’ earliest retraction
49:1744:114801:12:12:72:540:246:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:event  as  their  year  of  “treatment.”   One  problem  with  this  approach  is  the  possibility  that  scientists  are
49:1745:114923:12:12:72:540:234:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:associated  with  retraction  events  across  multiple  years  over  the  course  of  their  careers.   This  is  not  idle
49:1746:115046:12:11:72:540:222:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:speculation:  71 of the 376 authors (18.88%) in the sample have retraction events that occur in more than
49:1747:115151:11:12:72:540:211:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:one calendar year (with a maximum of nine different years with retractions).  If we also count authors who
49:1748:115257:12:12:72:539:199:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:retract multiple articlesin the same year, the number of multiple retractors grows to 115 (30.59%).  This
49:1749:115362:12:12:72:540:187:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:appendix investigates the role that these “multiple retractors” have on the manuscript’s key findings.  First,
49:1750:115472:12:12:72:540:175:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:we provide descriptive summaries regarding the nature of the retracted authors with retractions that span
49:1751:115577:12:12:72:540:163:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:more  than  one  year.   We  focus  on  this  group,  rather  than  additionally  including  authors  with  multiple
49:1752:115693:12:12:72:540:151:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:retractions  in  the  same  year,  because  the  paper’s  theoretical  and  empirical  approach  rely  heavily  on  the
49:1753:115812:12:12:72:540:139:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:timing of the earliest retractions as representing one-time shocks to scientist reputation.  Retractions across
49:1754:115923:12:12:72:540:127:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:multiple years are a threat to this approach because, in those cases, the timing of the reputation shock is
49:1755:116030:12:18:72:540:115:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:spread out such that our empirical estimation could be picking up reactions to the subsequent retractions

50:1758:116192:0:12:72:540:708:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:and assigning those responses to the earlier events.  Next, we evaluate the impact of the multiple-retraction
50:1759:116301:12:21:72:414:696:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:cases by running the regression analyses with the multiple retractors removed.
50:1760:116379:21:12:72:540:675:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:As one might expect, multiple retractions authors are more likely to be affiliated with misconduct retractions
50:1761:116489:12:12:72:540:663:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:than the singleton retractors.  Table F2 shows that of the 71 scientists in our sample with retractions in more
50:1762:116600:12:12:72:540:651:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:than one year, 69.01% have earliest retractions associated with misconduct.  Among the 305 single retractions
50:1763:116709:12:12:72:540:639:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:authors, only 33.77% have misconduct earliest retractions. This disproportionate number of misconduct cases
50:1764:116816:12:12:72:540:627:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:among the multiple retractors raises the possibility that more drawn out (and potentially more severe and
50:1765:116921:12:12:72:540:615:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:higher-profile) “retraction episodes” drive the negative citation impact for prior work. This concern motivates
50:1766:117032:12:12:72:540:603:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:our supplemental regression analysis that excludes the multiple retractors group (see below).viiiIn contrast
50:1767:117140:12:12:72:540:591:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:to the misconduct split, the proportion of high-status authors (as measured by cumulative citations) is fairly
50:1768:117250:12:12:72:540:579:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:similar for singleton and multiple retractors.  Table F3 shows that 30.49% and 23.94% of single and multiple
50:1769:117358:12:21:72:281:567:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:retraction authors, respectively, are high status.
50:1770:117408:21:12:72:540:546:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:To evaluate the impact of multiple retractors on our results, we ran our primary sets of regressions (Tables 3
50:1771:117518:12:12:72:540:534:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:and  4,  as  well  as  the  event-study  graph)  excluding  the  authors  with  multiple  retraction  events  spanning
50:1772:117636:12:12:72:540:522:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:multiple years.  We also excluded their associated control authors, so that the sample contains the articles of
50:1773:117747:12:12:72:540:510:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:authors with retraction events occurring in the same year, together with the corresponding control authors
50:1774:117853:12:12:72:540:498:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:identified  by  looking  at  articles  in  the  same/journal  issues  as  the  retraction  events.   Naturally,  excluding
50:1775:117975:12:12:72:540:486:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:these authors means that the coefficients of interest are less precisely estimated, especially when splitting
50:1776:118084:12:21:72:313:474:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:the sample using the misconduct and status covariates.
50:1777:118138:21:12:72:540:453:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:Column  1  of  Table  F5  shows  that  despite  the  more  limited  sample,  we  still  see  that  retraction  authors
50:1778:118256:12:12:72:540:441:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:experienced a statistically significant drop in citations to prior work after the retraction event. The magnitude
50:1779:118369:12:12:72:540:429:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:of this effect is slightly smaller than in the main analyses (8.1% yearly decrease in citation rate, as opposed to
50:1780:118483:12:12:72:540:417:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:10.7% in the full sample version).  Figure F2 displays the interactions between the treatment effect variable
50:1781:118592:12:11:72:540:405:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:with indicator variables for number of years until the retraction event.  The general pattern is the same as
50:1782:118700:11:12:72:540:394:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:the full sample version (Figure 8), but there are two notable differences.  First, the confidence intervals are
50:1783:118811:12:12:72:540:382:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:slightly larger in Figure F2.  Second, the magnitude of the treatment effect is more steady over time than
50:1784:118917:12:12:72:540:370:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:in the full sample analysis, with very little change between year three and year nine after treatment.  One
50:1785:119024:12:12:72:540:358:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:explanation for this difference is that the steady negative slope in the full analysis graph may be influenced by
50:1786:119137:12:21:72:540:346:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:the multiple retraction authors’ later retraction events, which serve as additional shocks to their reputation.
50:1787:119248:21:12:72:540:325:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:The results in Table F6 (which is analogous to Table 4 in the paper) show that the subgroup comparisons
50:1788:119351:12:12:72:540:313:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:remain  directionally  the  same  with  multiple  retractors  excluded.   We  still  find  the  most  stark  difference
50:1789:119470:12:12:72:540:301:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:between mistake and misconduct authors within the high-status category (as measured either by citations
50:1790:119573:12:12:72:540:289:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:or funding).  We also continue to observe similar magnitudes in the citation decline for low-status authors,
50:1791:119681:12:21:72:406:277:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:whether or not misconduct is involved in the corresponding retraction event.
50:1792:119757:21:12:72:540:256:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:We  highlight  two  important  findings  contained  in  these  supplemental  analyses.   First,  multiple-retraction
50:1793:119873:12:12:72:540:244:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:authors are more likely to be associated with misconduct cases than are singleton retractors.  Removing the
50:1794:119980:12:12:72:540:232:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:multiple-year  retraction  authors  from  the  analysis  sample  reduces  statistical  power,  but  our  main  results
50:1795:120098:12:12:72:540:220:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:continue  to  hold,  at  least  qualitatively.   A  single  retraction  event  is  enough  to  damage  the  reputation  of
50:1796:120220:12:12:72:540:208:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:an  author’s  prior  work,  and  the  punishment  meted  out  by  failing  to  cite  these  authors  still  varies  across
50:1797:120342:12:84:72:481:196:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:misconduct and status subgroups in ways that are consistent with our theoretical predictions.
50:1798:120435:84:13:78:539:112:7:g_d0_f8:8:g_d0_f7:F:viiiJin et al.  (2013) and Lu et al.  (2013) remove authors who retracted publications multiple times from their analyses.  This
50:1799:120563:13:9:72:540:99:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:data  construction  choive  makes  the  difference-in-differences  analysis  more  straightforward,  but  also  entails  that  the  miscon-
50:1800:120702:9:36:72:533:90:8:g_d0_f7:8:g_d0_f7:F:duct/mistake split in their sample of authors is less representative of the split in the overall population of retracted authors.

57:1806:128466:31:12:72:540:655:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:In our analysis of heterogeneous treatment effects, we split the sample by retraction type interacted with
57:1807:128572:12:12:72:540:643:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:status cells (Table 4).  The advantage of the “split-sample” approach is that the corresponding treatment
57:1808:128677:12:12:72:540:631:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:effects  are  estimated  off  control  groups  that  correspond  exactly  to  the  treatment  group  (e.g.,  high-status
57:1809:128797:12:12:72:540:619:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:retracted authors are only compared to high-status control authors).  A downside of this approach, however,
57:1810:128904:12:12:72:540:607:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:is  that  it  becomes  more  challenging  to  compare  the  magnitudes  of  the  treatment  effects,  since  they  are
57:1811:129022:12:18:72:450:595:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:estimated from separate samples that are not randomly selected from the overall data.
57:1812:129107:18:12:72:540:577:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:An obvious alternative is to run a regression on the entire sample, interacting the “after retraction” treat-
57:1813:129216:12:12:72:540:565:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:ment variable (as well as all the other covariates) with indicator variables for each of the four subgroups.
57:1814:129324:12:18:72:398:553:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:Unfortunately, we cannot get this fully saturated specification to converge.
57:1815:129400:18:12:72:540:535:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:We  use  two  different  approaches  to  statistically  compare  the  magnitudes  of  the  treatment  effects  across
57:1816:129517:12:12:72:540:523:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:subgroups.  First, under the assumption that, conditional on the included covariates, the four subsamples
57:1817:129622:12:12:72:539:511:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:are randomly drawn from the overall data, then we can compare the coefficients’ magnitudes using aZ-test
57:1818:129726:12:17:72:223:499:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:in the spirit of Clogg et al.  (1995):

57:1823:129785:18:11:72:545:456:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:Using this approach, thep-value for the one-tailed test of equality between the treatment effects in columns (1a)

57:1825:130017:12:12:72:540:433:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:columns  (1b)  and  (1d)  is  0.13:  the  difference  between  these  coefficient  estimates  is  not  statistically  sig-
57:1826:130139:12:18:72:204:421:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:nificant at conventional levels.
57:1827:130171:18:12:72:539:403:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:Since theZ-test relies on a problematic assumption (that the subsamples are randomly drawn from the overall
57:1828:130278:12:12:72:540:391:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:data), we also pool the data in a slightly simplified version of the fully-saturated model.  In particular, our
57:1829:130389:12:12:72:540:379:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:pooled specification does not include a full suite of interaction terms between the year effects, age effects,
57:1830:130499:12:12:72:540:367:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:and the subgroup indicator variables.  The results are displayed in Table G1.  Columns (1) and (2) utilize
57:1831:130605:12:12:72:540:355:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:the entire analysis sample, and columns (3) and (4) split the sample by author citation status.  We use Wald
57:1832:130713:12:12:72:540:343:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:hypothesis tests to compare the magnitudes of the treatment effect variables.  In column (1), we observe a
57:1833:130819:12:12:72:540:331:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:statistically significant (p <0.05) difference between the misconduct and mistake groups.  In column (2), we
57:1834:130927:12:12:72:540:319:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:compare the treatment effects for each of the four subgroups.  The Wald test statistic allows us to reject the
57:1835:131037:12:12:72:539:307:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:null hypothesis that the coefficient on the treatment variable “After Retraction×High Status×Misconduct”
57:1836:131141:12:12:72:540:295:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:is equal to any of the other treatment variables (when the Wald test is performed in a pairwise manner).  We
57:1837:131249:12:12:72:540:283:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:cannot reject the null hypothesis that any of the other three treatment variables are equal at conventional
57:1838:131356:12:12:72:540:271:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:levels of statistical significance.  Column (3) also offers support for the claim that the high-status misconduct
57:1839:131469:12:12:72:540:259:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:group suffers the largest citation penalty; conversely, in column (4), the two low-status subgroups experience
57:1840:131579:12:193:72:360:247:10:g_d0_f9:10:g_d0_f9:F:penalties that are statistically indistinguishable from one another.
