2:27:1322:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:The latest boom in commodity prices fueled concerns about fiscal policies in commodity-exporting
2:28:1418:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:countries, with many claiming that it triggered loose fiscal policy and left no funds for a rainy day.
2:29:1520:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:This paper examines the links between fiscal policy and terms-of-trade fluctuations using a sample
2:30:1618:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:of 74 countries, both developed and developing.   It finds evidence that booms in the terms of trade
2:31:1718:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:do not necessarily lead to larger government surpluses in developing countries, particularly in emerging
2:32:1822:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:markets and especially during capital flow bonanzas.   This is not the case in OECD countries, where
2:33:1922:14:42:72:251:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:fiscal policy is of an acyclical nature.

3:40:2080:0:13:72:151:708:144:Times:100:Times:B:I. Introduction 
3:41:2095:13:14:72:75:695:144:Times:144:Times:B: 
3:42:2095:14:21:108:543:681:144:Times:144:Times:A:After several years of relatively stable commodity prices, volatility has returned, fueling 
3:43:2187:21:21:72:545:660:144:Times:144:Times:B:as  always  worries  about  its  effects  on  overall  economic  stability  around  the  world.  This  time  
3:44:2296:21:20:72:546:639:144:Times:144:Times:B:around,  the  debate  is  also  focused  on  fiscal  policy.  During  the  boom  that  started  in  2003,  
3:45:2403:20:21:72:544:619:144:Times:144:Times:B:concerns  were  raised  that  commodity  price  increases  were  encouraging  excessive  government  
3:46:2504:21:21:72:545:598:144:Times:144:Times:B:spending  in  resource-abundant  countries,  leaving  no  funds  for  a  rainy  day.  For  example,  the  
3:47:2610:21:20:72:543:577:144:Times:144:Times:B:Inter-American Development Bank 2007 Annual Report is entitled All that Glitters May Not Be 
3:48:2702:20:21:72:545:557:144:Times:144:Times:B:Gold,  partly  in  reference  to  the  fiscal  positions  of  Latin  American  countries  during  the  latest  
3:49:2813:21:21:72:543:536:144:Times:144:Times:B:boom  in  commodity  prices.  This  report  concludes  that  the  fiscal  surpluses  observed  during  this  
3:50:2922:21:20:72:544:515:144:Times:144:Times:B:period are far from reassuring since they are based on inflated and unsustainable fiscal revenues 
3:51:3020:20:21:72:544:495:144:Times:144:Times:B:due  to  transitory  increases  in  the  price  of  commodities.  In  fact,  the  report  concludes  that  when  
3:52:3133:21:21:72:544:474:144:Times:144:Times:B:government  revenues  are  estimated  at  the  ‘long-run’  prices  of  commodities,  the  average  fiscal  
3:53:3240:21:21:72:484:453:144:Times:144:Times:B:position of these countries has deteriorated with deficits averaging 4 percent of GDP. 
3:54:3327:21:20:108:544:432:144:Times:144:Times:A:This  concern  is  not  limited  to  Latin  America.  Both  in  academic  and  policy  circles  the  
3:55:3428:20:21:72:542:412:144:Times:144:Times:B:debate regarding what governments in commodity producer countries should do when their terms 
3:56:3521:21:21:72:543:391:144:Times:144:Times:B:of trade improve has intensified. A new proposal based on neo-classical models of fiscal policy 
3:57:3617:21:20:72:543:370:144:Times:144:Times:B:supports the creation of Commodity Sovereign Wealth funds. According to this proposal, fiscal 
3:58:3711:20:21:72:543:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:policy should be acyclical, with government consumption smoothed over the business cycle and 
3:59:3804:21:21:72:543:329:144:Times:144:Times:B:savings accumulating in boom times to provide funding for a rainy day. In fact, this policy has 
3:60:3900:21:20:72:548:308:144:Times:144:Times:B:been  at  the  core  of  the  IMF  recommendations  for  countries  dependent  on  commodity  exports.1   
3:61:4006:20:21:71:544:288:144:Times:144:Times:B:This  paper  does  not  examine  the  role  of  these  funds  but  rather  pays  particular  attention  to  the  
3:62:4119:21:21:71:400:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects of terms of trade cycles on fiscal positions around the world. 
3:63:4190:21:20:107:545:246:144:Times:144:Times:A:Relying  on  data  for  74  countries  for  the  period  1960-2008,  this  paper  examines  the  
3:64:4287:20:21:71:543:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:evidence on the cycles in the terms of trade and those of fiscal policy. In particular, it studies the 
3:65:4390:21:21:71:544:205:144:Times:144:Times:B:behavior  of  government  expenditure,  revenues,  and  primary  balances,  as  well  as  inflation.  The  
3:66:4497:21:21:71:547:184:144:Times:144:Times:B:paper  examines  separately  the   evidence   on   countries   grouped   by   income   levels.   It   also   
3:67:4606:21:20:71:543:163:144:Times:144:Times:B:disaggregates the sample along a variety of dimensions, by (i) differentiating episodes of capital 
3:68:4705:20:21:71:546:143:144:Times:144:Times:B:flow  bonanzas  from  those  when  international  capital  flows  are  at  their  historical  lows,  (ii)  
3:69:4812:21:15:71:545:122:144:Times:144:Times:B:differentiating  episodes  of  terms  of  trade  booms  from  those  of  terms  of  trade  crashes,  (iii)

4:73:5174:20:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:transitory terms of trade shocks, (iv) comparing responses during periods of more rigid exchange 
4:74:5271:21:21:72:542:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:rate regimes separately from more flexible arrangements, and (v) examining separately the fiscal 
4:75:5368:21:20:72:291:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:responses in commodity-exporting countries. 
4:76:5412:20:21:108:543:626:144:Times:144:Times:A: The paper proceeds as follows. The next section briefly discusses the theoretical literature 
4:77:5505:21:21:72:542:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:on fiscal policy used to interpret the results on terms of trade and fiscal policy cycles. Section III 
4:78:5608:21:20:71:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:provides a visual representation of alternative fiscal policies and terms of trade cycles around the 
4:79:5709:20:21:71:545:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:world  by  focusing  on  the  evidence  of  just  two  countries:  Argentina  and  Norway.  Section  IV  
4:80:5814:21:21:71:544:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:extends  the  analysis  of  fiscal  responses  to  the  whole  sample  of  74  countries  using  panel  data  
4:81:5924:21:33:71:377:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimation techniques. Section V contains concluding remarks. 
4:82:5986:33:32:71:208:489:144:Times:144:Times:B:II. Models of Fiscal Policy 
4:83:6012:32:21:107:545:457:144:Times:144:Times:A:A  number  of  models  have  been  proposed  to  explain  the  cyclical  behavior  of  fiscal  
4:84:6107:21:21:71:544:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:policies.  Keynesian  models  provide  the  rationale  for  countercyclical  fiscal  policy.      In  these  
4:85:6216:21:20:71:544:415:144:Times:144:Times:B:models,  the  fiscal  authority  has  an  objective  function  that  penalizes  deviations  of  output  from  
4:86:6326:20:21:71:543:395:144:Times:144:Times:B:trend.  Since  an  increase  in  government  spending  and/or  a  reduction  in  tax  rates  expands  output  
4:87:6436:21:21:71:543:374:144:Times:144:Times:B:(and vice versa), fiscal policy will be countercyclical. In contrast, neoclassical models rationalize 
4:88:6538:21:20:71:543:353:144:Times:144:Times:B:acyclical fiscal policy since roughly constant tax rates over the business cycle reduce distortions 
4:89:6638:20:21:71:545:333:144:Times:144:Times:B:(see  Chari  and  Kehoe,  1999).  Moreover,  if  government  spending  is  endogeneized  (by,  say,  
4:90:6739:21:21:71:543:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:providing direct utility), neo-classical models predict that it would be optimal for it to behave in 
4:91:6840:21:20:71:543:291:144:Times:144:Times:B:a similar way to private consumption and hence would be acyclical in the presence of complete 
4:92:6934:20:21:71:246:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:markets (Riascos and Végh, 2003).  
4:93:6969:21:21:107:544:250:144:Times:144:Times:A:In  contrast  to  Keynesian  and  neo-classical  recommendations,  recent  empirical  literature  
4:94:7067:21:21:71:544:229:144:Times:144:Times:B:has  noted  that  while  fiscal  policy  is  acyclical  or  countercyclical  in  developed  countries,  it  is  
4:95:7179:21:20:71:544:208:144:Times:144:Times:B:procyclical  in  most  developing  countries,  with  fiscal  policy  probably  exacerbating  the  business  
4:96:7287:20:21:71:543:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:cycle in those countries. This begs the question of why these countries follow policies that tend 
4:97:7385:21:21:71:544:167:144:Times:144:Times:B:to create macroeconomic instability. Theoretical models suggest two possible explanations. The 
4:98:7480:21:20:71:543:146:144:Times:144:Times:B:first one relies on the presence of distortions in international capital markets. For example, Gavin 
4:99:7581:20:21:71:547:126:144:Times:144:Times:B:and  Perotti  (1997),  Caballero  and  Krishnamurthy  (2004),  and  Guerson  (2004)  argue  that  
4:100:7679:21:0:71:545:105:144:Times:144:Times:B:developing  countries  face  credit  constraints  that  prevent  them  from  borrowing  in  bad  times.  
5:101:7786:0:20:72:544:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:Hence, they are ‘forced’ to repay in bad times, which requires a contractionary fiscal policy. In 
5:102:7884:20:21:71:542:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:the same vein, Riascos and Végh (2003) show that incomplete markets could explain procyclical 
5:103:7978:21:21:71:545:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:fiscal  policy  as  the  outcome  of  a  Ramsey  problem  without  having  to  impose  any  additional  
5:104:8082:21:20:71:120:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:frictions.  
5:105:8094:20:21:107:546:626:144:Times:144:Times:A:The  second  strand  of  the  literature  relies  on  a  political  economy  explanation.  For  
5:106:8190:21:21:71:543:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:example, Tornell and Lane (1999) develop a model in which competition for a common pool of 
5:107:8281:21:20:71:545:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:funds  among  different  units  (ministries,  provinces)  leads  to  the  so-called  ‘voracity  effect,’  
5:108:8387:20:21:71:544:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:whereby  expenditure  could  actually  exceed  a  given  windfall.  Taking  as  given  such  a  political  
5:109:8494:21:21:71:543:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:distortion, Talvi and Végh (2005) show how policymakers would find it optimal to run smaller 
5:110:8587:21:21:71:527:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:primary surpluses in good times by increasing government spending and reducing tax rates.2    
5:111:8681:21:20:108:545:501:144:Times:144:Times:A:While  political  distortions  can  be  present  in  all  countries,  a  number  of  authors  have  
5:112:8781:20:21:72:540:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:concluded that these distortions can be more widespread in resource-rich economies where non-
5:113:8874:21:21:72:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:resource taxes are low and resource rents are high. For example, Lane and Tornell (1996) argue 
5:114:8969:21:20:72:540:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:that  resource-rich  economies  are  subject  to  more  extreme  rent-seeking  behavior  than  resource-
5:115:9073:20:21:72:544:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:poor  economies  because  national  politics  is  oriented  to  appropriating  the  rents  earned  by  the  
5:116:9181:21:21:72:548:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:natural   resource   endowments.   In   their   model,   a   windfall   coming   from   a   terms-of-trade   
5:117:9290:21:20:72:545:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:improvement  can  lead  to  sharp  increases  in  spending,  a  distorted  allocation  of  spending  over  
5:118:9397:20:21:72:331:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:time, dissipated revenues, and a collapse in growth.    
5:119:9453:21:21:108:543:336:144:Times:144:Times:A:There  is  also  an  important  literature  that  links  fiscal  policy  with  exchange  rate  regimes.  
5:120:9558:21:20:72:545:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:Conventional  wisdom  indicates  that  fixed  exchange  rates  provide  more  fiscal  discipline  than  
5:121:9662:20:21:72:546:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:flexible  exchange  rates  (see,  for  example,  Frenkel,  Goldstein,  and  Masson  (1991);  Aghevli,  
5:122:9765:21:21:72:543:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:Khan, and Montiel (1991); and Giavazzi and Pagano (1988)). The claim is that fixed rates induce 
5:123:9861:21:21:72:544:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:more  discipline  because  the  sustained  adoption  of  lax  fiscal  policies  must  eventually  lead  to  a

5:125:10084:20:21:72:545:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:contrast,  Tornell  and  Velasco  (2000)  argue  that  flexible  exchange  rate  regimes  trigger  more  
5:126:10189:21:21:72:543:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:austere  fiscal  policies.  They  examine  the  role  of  exchange  rate  regimes  using  an  intertemporal  
5:127:10298:21:20:72:543:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:model with endogenous optimal fiscal policy. In this model, loose fiscal policies are costly under 
5:128:10397:20:22:72:544:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:both  fixed  and  flexible  exchange  rates.  While  under  fixed  exchange  rates  bad  behavior  today

6:133:10771:20:21:72:546:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:under  flexible  exchange  rates  unsound  fiscal  policy  manifests  itself  immediately  through  
6:134:10871:21:21:72:544:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:movements  in  the  exchange  rate.  The  difference  is  in  the  intertemporal  distribution  of  these  
6:135:10978:21:20:72:543:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:costs. They show that if fiscal authorities are impatient, flexible rates – by forcing the costs to be 
6:136:11081:20:21:72:523:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:paid up-front – provide more fiscal discipline and higher welfare for the representative agent. 
6:137:11177:21:21:108:546:605:144:Times:144:Times:A:Finally,  the  last  strand  of  the  literature  on  suboptimal  macropolicies  concludes  that  
6:138:11275:21:20:72:546:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:distortionary  macroeconomic  policies  are  likely  to  be  symptoms  of  underlying  institutional  
6:139:11377:20:21:72:545:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:problems,  such  as  lack  of  enforcement  of  property  rights  and  repudiation  of  contracts.  As  
6:140:11481:21:21:72:545:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:Acemoglu et  al  (2003)  conclude,  in  societies  with  institutional  problems,  politicians  may  be  
6:141:11586:21:33:72:528:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:forced to pursue unsustainable policies in order to satisfy various groups and remain in power. 
6:142:11682:33:32:67:433:489:144:Times:144:Times:?:III. Fiscal Stance and Terms of Trade Cycles: A Tale of Two Countries 
6:143:11752:32:21:108:544:457:144:Times:144:Times:A:To  grasp  the  distinct  characteristics  of  cycles  in  the  terms  of  trade  and  the  fiscal  stance  
6:144:11860:21:21:72:545:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:around  the  world,  visual  evidence  from  two  commodity-exporting  countries  is  presented.  The  
6:145:11963:21:20:71:546:415:144:Times:144:Times:B:first  country  is  a  developing  economy,  Argentina,  the  second  one  is  a  developed  economy,  
6:146:12066:20:21:71:543:395:144:Times:144:Times:B:Norway. On average, the share of commodity exports in total exports in both countries oscillates 
6:147:12163:21:21:71:545:374:144:Times:144:Times:B:around  70  percent.  Figure  1  shows  the  cycles  in  the  terms  of  trade  as  well  as  the  cycles  in  
6:148:12274:21:20:71:543:353:144:Times:144:Times:B:government expenditure, government revenues, and the primary balance. In this figure and also 
6:149:12368:20:21:71:543:333:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the panel estimations in Section IV, I identify cycles by using the ubiquitous Hodrick-Prescott 
6:150:12467:21:21:71:544:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:(HP)  filter.  Figure  1  also  reports  pairwise  correlations  between  the  cyclical  components  of  the  
6:151:12577:21:20:71:543:291:144:Times:144:Times:B:terms of trade and the fiscal stance for the two economies. While these correlations only provide 
6:152:12675:20:21:71:546:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:a  metric  of  contemporaneous  comovements,  Section  IV  explores  potential  temporal  causal  
6:153:12773:21:21:71:120:250:144:Times:144:Times:B:patterns.3 
6:154:12783:21:21:108:547:229:144:Times:144:Times:A:It  should  also  be  noted  that  only  government  expenditure  provides  a  measure  of  
6:155:12875:21:20:72:544:208:144:Times:144:Times:B:discretionary  fiscal  policy.  As  discussed  extensively  in  Kaminsky,  Reinhart,  and  Végh  (2004),  
6:156:12981:20:21:72:543:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:government revenues and the primary balance depend on the tax base (output or in this case  the 
6:157:13077:21:27:72:543:167:144:Times:144:Times:B:terms of trade), with the correlations between these two indicators and output (or terms of trade) 
6:158:13176:27:9:216:218:140:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:?:                                                            
6:159:13235:9:17:72:543:131:49:g_d0_f1:100:Times:F:3 Both fiscal and terms of trade indicators are obtained from the WEO database of the International Monetary Fund 
6:160:13348:17:19:71:268:114:100:Times:100:Times:F:and are described in Table A1 in the appendix.    
6:161:13398:19:0:72:74:95:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:F: 
7:162:13400:0:20:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:providing in most cases ambiguous information on the cyclicality of fiscal policy.4 Still, in order 
7:163:13500:20:21:72:542:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:to examine whether the fiscal stance tends to be loose when the terms of trade improve, the paper 
7:164:13598:21:21:72:454:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:is also concerned with the cycles in government revenues and primary balance. 
7:165:13676:21:20:108:547:646:144:Times:144:Times:A:As  shown  in  the  top  panel  of  Figure  1,  while  government  expenditure  is  highly  
7:166:13768:20:21:72:545:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:countercyclical  in  Norway,  this  is  not  the  case  in  Argentina  where  government  expenditure  
7:167:13871:21:21:72:542:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:becomes increasingly procyclical since the early 1990s. Again, the evidence from the middle and 
7:168:13967:21:20:72:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:lower panels indicates that booms in the terms of trade in Argentina did not trigger higher public 
7:169:14066:20:21:71:543:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:savings;  in  fact,  the  primary  balance  is  below  trend  when  Argentina’s  terms  of  trade  improve.  
7:170:14175:21:21:71:544:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:The  evidence  from  Norway  is  in  stark  contrast, with the fiscal stance improving with booms in 
7:171:14276:21:33:71:170:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:the terms of trade.    
7:172:14299:33:32:67:177:489:144:Times:144:Times:?:IV. Panel Estimation 
7:173:14320:32:21:107:543:457:144:Times:144:Times:A:Kaminsky,  Reinhart,  and  Végh  (2004)  examine  the  cyclical  characteristics  of  fiscal  and  
7:174:14419:21:21:71:545:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:monetary  policies  around  the  world  and  find  that  developing  countries  (in  particular,  middle  
7:175:14525:21:20:71:543:415:144:Times:144:Times:B:income countries) follow procyclical policies while industrialised countries implement acyclical 
7:176:14622:20:21:71:545:395:144:Times:144:Times:B:or  countercyclical  policies.  In  a  similar  vein,  this  paper  documents  the  relationship  between  
7:177:14729:21:21:71:545:374:144:Times:144:Times:B:booms  and  busts  in  the  terms  of  trade  and  government  expenditure  and  revenues,  primary  
7:178:14830:21:20:71:542:353:144:Times:144:Times:B:balances, and inflation. The purpose of this paper is not to examine the cyclical characteristics of 
7:179:14931:20:21:71:543:333:144:Times:144:Times:B:fiscal policy but to evaluate whether fiscal positions of countries around the world deteriorate or 
7:180:15031:21:21:71:244:312:144:Times:144:Times:B:improve with terms of trade cycles. 
7:181:15067:21:20:107:543:291:144:Times:144:Times:A:As discussed in Section II, political and institutional distortions are at the core of models 
7:182:15161:20:21:71:543:271:144:Times:144:Times:B:of suboptimal fiscal policy. Since these distortions are more widespread in developing countries, 
7:183:15259:21:21:71:545:250:144:Times:144:Times:B:I  examine  separately  the  evidence  on  countries  grouped  by  income  levels.  The  World  Bank  
7:184:15361:21:21:71:540:229:144:Times:144:Times:B:classification  in  2008  is  used  to  divide  the  sample  into  groups  of  low-income,  lower-middle-
7:185:15466:21:20:71:546:208:144:Times:144:Times:B:income,  upper-middle-income,  and  high-income  (OECD)  countries  (see  the  Appendix  for  
7:186:15560:20:56:71:115:188:144:Times:144:Times:B:details).  
7:187:15571:56:8:216:218:132:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:?:                                                            
7:188:15630:8:18:72:542:124:64:Times:100:Times:F:4 For example, tax revenues = tax rate × tax base. Suppose the government follows a procyclical fiscal policy. Since, 
7:189:15747:18:11:71:542:106:100:Times:100:Times:F:by definition, the tax rate goes down in good times (and vice versa) but the tax base moves in the opposite direction, 
7:190:15866:11:0:72:425:95:100:Times:144:Times:B:the correlation of tax revenues with the business (or terms of trade) cycle is ambiguous. 
8:191:15957:0:20:108:540:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:Even within the panel estimation by income groups, I also examine the possibility of non-
8:192:16046:20:21:72:544:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:linear  relationships  between  the  various  measures  of  the  fiscal  stance  and  fluctuations  in  the  
8:193:16155:21:21:72:397:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:terms of trade as suggested by the various models of fiscal policy.   
8:194:16225:21:20:108:546:646:144:Times:144:Times:A:First,  as  discussed  in  Gavin  and  Perotti  (1997),  I  examine  whether  the  relationship  
8:195:16322:20:21:72:547:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:between  the  fiscal  stance  and  the  terms  of  trade  depends  on  the  degree  of  liquidity  in  
8:196:16425:21:21:72:545:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:international  capital  markets,  that  is,  on  the  ability  of  countries  to  tap  international  capital  
8:197:16536:21:20:72:545:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:markets.  To  identify  liquidity  in  international  capital  markets,  I  follow  Reinhart  and  Reinhart  
8:198:16645:20:21:72:544:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:(2008)  who  identify  capital  flow  bonanza  episodes  country  by  country5  using  a  sample  of  181  
8:199:16752:21:21:72:544:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries  and  then  tally,  year  by  year,  the  number  of  countries  with  capital  flow  bonanzas.  An  
8:200:16863:21:21:72:546:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:index  of  worldwide  bonanzas  is  then  constructed.  This  index  indicates  the  proportion  of  
8:201:16964:21:20:72:544:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries  with  an  episode  of  capital  flow  bonanza  in  any  given  year.        I  identify  episodes  of  
8:202:17078:20:21:72:543:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:worldwide capital flow bonanzas when the Reinhart and Reinhart index indicates that at least 20 
8:203:17174:21:21:72:544:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:percent  of  the  countries  are  found  to  be  having  a  capital  flow  bonanza.  This  metric  identifies  
8:204:17285:21:20:72:517:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:1978-1983, 1991-1993, 1998, and 2005-2008 as periods of worldwide capital flow bonanza. 
8:205:17373:20:21:112:544:419:144:Times:144:Times:A:Second,  models  with  liquidity  constraints  and  overall  imperfections  in  capital  markets  
8:206:17471:21:21:71:544:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:also  suggest  that  fiscal  responses  in  bad  states  (when,  for  example,  terms  of  trade  deteriorate)  
8:207:17583:21:20:71:545:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:may  be  more  procyclical  than  those  in  good  times,  with  government  introducing  draconian  
8:208:17684:20:21:71:543:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:reforms in response to a collapse in the terms of trade due to lack of access to credit. Thus, I also 
8:209:17786:21:21:71:544:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:examine  whether  the  fiscal  stance  responds  asymmetrically  to  booms  and  busts  in  the  terms  of  
8:210:17894:21:20:71:543:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:trade.   I identify good times (terms of trade booms) as those years when the terms of trade are 
8:211:17991:20:21:71:543:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:above their trend and bad times (terms of trade busts) as those years when they are below their 
8:212:18087:21:21:71:383:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:trend, with the trend estimated with the Hodrick-Prescott filter.   
8:213:18155:21:21:112:543:253:144:Times:144:Times:A:Third, the response of the fiscal stance to terms of trade fluctuations may depend on the 
8:214:18245:21:20:71:544:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:exchange rate regime. To test for this, episodes of fixed and floating exchange rate regimes are 
8:215:18342:20:21:71:543:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:identified by using the Reinhart and Rogoff (2004) de facto exchange rate regime classification. 
8:216:18439:21:21:71:546:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:For  this  paper,  it  is  enough  to  define  two  exchange  rate  regimes:  fixed  or  predetermined  
8:217:18543:21:49:71:542:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:exchange rates, and flexible exchange rates (which are defined as including any regime in which 
8:218:18639:49:9:216:218:121:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:?:                                                            
8:219:18698:9:17:72:543:112:64:Times:100:Times:F:5 For  each  country,  a  capital  flow  bonanza  year  is  one  with  a  large  current  account  deficit,  defined  as  a  current  
8:220:18831:17:0:72:236:95:100:Times:144:Times:B:account balance in the 20th percentile.    
9:221:18875:0:20:72:545:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  exchange  rate  is  allowed  some  flexibility).  Flexible  exchange  rate  regimes  include  clean  
9:222:18981:20:21:72:390:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:floats (which are rare) and dirty floats (which are more common). 
9:223:19047:21:21:108:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:A:Fourth, many have argued that fiscal authorities tend to believe that good times are more 
9:224:19137:21:20:72:543:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:permanent than they really are, leading to too much spending or a reduction in tax rates in times 
9:225:19235:20:21:72:545:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:of  terms  of  trade  booms.  According  to  this  hypothesis,  the  fiscal  stance  responds  equally  to  
9:226:19343:21:21:72:543:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:transitory and persistent terms of trade shocks. To examine this hypothesis, I classify shocks into 
9:227:19443:21:20:72:546:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:transitory  and  persistent  following  the  analysis  in  Kent  and  Cashin  (2003).  These  authors  
9:228:19546:20:28:72:224:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimate equations of the form: 
9:229:19578:28:31:364:413:536:144:Times:144:Times:?:          titiiititotctot,1,,μφ+Δ+=Δ−         (1) 
9:230:19628:31:23:72:544:505:144:Times:144:Times:B:where totΔ is  the  growth  rate  of  the  terms  of  trade.  The  coefficient  φ  captures  the  degree  of  
9:231:19737:23:23:72:543:482:144:Times:144:Times:B:persistence of the shocks, with shocks becoming more persistent as φ approaches 1 in absolute 
9:232:19831:23:21:72:543:459:144:Times:144:Times:B:value. Again, following Kent and Cashin (2003), transitory and permanent terms of trade shocks 
9:233:19926:21:27:72:375:438:144:Times:144:Times:B:are separated by first estimating the half-life of a shock (HLS):

10:252:21596:21:21:108:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:A:As in Section III, cycles in the fiscal stance, economic activity, and the terms of trade are 
10:253:21690:21:20:72:546:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:identified  using  the  Hodrick-Prescott  (HP)  filter.  The  indicators  are  obtained  from  the  IMF  
10:254:21795:20:21:72:391:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:(WEO) database and are described in Table A1 of the appendix.    
10:255:21860:21:21:108:545:605:144:Times:144:Times:A:To  examine  the  links  between  the  fiscal  stance  and  the  terms  of  trade  the  following  
10:256:21959:21:23:72:516:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:regression using fixed effects panel techniques is estimated. Each regression takes the form: 
10:257:22053:23:25:423:468:561:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:?:      titijtititiitiXIctotctotcY,,,,,,   εδγβα++×++=          (3) 
10:258:22117:25:20:72:543:536:144:Times:144:Times:B:where cY represents alternatively the cycle in government expenditure, government revenue, the 
10:259:22212:20:21:72:544:516:144:Times:144:Times:B:primary  balance  and  inflation;  ctot  is  the  cycle  in  the  terms  of  trade;  I is an  indicator  used  to  
10:260:22326:21:21:71:543:495:144:Times:144:Times:B:examine the presence of non-linearities; and X captures the state of the business cycle, that is, the 
10:261:22428:21:20:71:214:474:144:Times:144:Times:B:output cycle of each country. 
10:262:22458:20:21:107:543:454:144:Times:144:Times:A:The simplest strategy is to estimate the model in Equation (3) using ordinary least squares 
10:263:22550:21:21:71:545:433:144:Times:144:Times:B:(OLS)  regressions.  However,  cycles  in  economic  activity  as  captured  by  cycles  in  GDP  are  
10:264:22653:21:20:71:544:412:144:Times:144:Times:B:endogenous,  so  we  may  be  capturing  reverse  causality.  In  this  case,  OLS  regressions  will  give  
10:265:22762:20:21:71:542:392:144:Times:144:Times:B:results that do not correspond to the causal effect of economic activity on the fiscal stance. Thus, 
10:266:22863:21:21:71:544:371:144:Times:144:Times:B:Equation  (3)  is  estimated  using  Two-Stage  Least  Squares  (2SLS)  with  lagged  values  of  GDP  
10:267:22966:21:21:71:349:350:144:Times:144:Times:B:cycles as instruments for current values of GDP cycles.    
10:268:23025:21:20:107:543:329:144:Times:144:Times:A:In the regressions, I test sequentially each possible non-linearity between the fiscal stance 
10:269:23119:20:21:72:544:309:144:Times:144:Times:B:and  the  terms  of  trade.  More  precisely,  when  examining  for  the  effect  of  liquid  international  
10:270:23228:21:21:72:543:288:144:Times:144:Times:B:capital markets, the index I is equal to one during episodes of worldwide capital flow bonanzas 
10:271:23324:21:20:72:543:267:144:Times:144:Times:B:and zero otherwise. When examining the presence of asymmetric responses to booms and busts 
10:272:23415:20:21:72:544:247:144:Times:144:Times:B:in the terms of trade, the index I is equal to one when the country experiences a terms of trade 
10:273:23512:21:21:72:542:226:144:Times:144:Times:B:boom and zero otherwise. When studying whether countries respond differently to transitory and 
10:274:23607:21:20:72:543:205:144:Times:144:Times:B:permanent terms of trade shocks, I is equal to one for countries with permanent shocks and zero 
10:275:23703:20:21:72:543:185:144:Times:144:Times:B:otherwise. When evaluating whether the exchange rate regime matters, the indicator I is equal to 
10:276:23800:21:21:72:543:164:144:Times:144:Times:B:one when the country adopts a flexible exchange rate regime and zero otherwise. Finally, when 
10:277:23894:21:21:72:543:143:144:Times:144:Times:B:studying whether resource-abundant economies respond differently to terms of trade shocks, I is 
10:278:23990:21:23:72:543:122:144:Times:144:Times:B:equal to one for resource-abundant countries and zero otherwise. That is, the coefficient β will 
10:279:24087:23:0:71:543:99:144:Times:144:Times:B:capture, respectively, the response of the fiscal indicator to terms of trade fluctuations in times of 
11:280:24192:0:20:72:546:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:illiquidity  in  world  capital  markets,  in  times  when  the  terms  of  trade  are  not  booming,  in  
11:281:24299:20:21:72:544:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries  with  transitory  terms-of-trade  shocks,  in  years  of  fixed  exchange  rate  regimes,  and  in  
11:282:24410:21:23:72:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries which are not resource-abundant. γβ+ will capture, respectively, the response of the 
11:283:24505:23:21:72:543:644:144:Times:144:Times:B:fiscal indicators to terms of trade shocks at times of capital flow bonanzas, in times of booms in 
11:284:24604:21:20:72:545:623:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  terms  of  trade,  in  countries  with  permanent  terms-of-trade  shocks,  in  years  with  flexible  
11:285:24712:20:21:72:329:603:144:Times:144:Times:B:exchange rates and in resource-abundant countries.    
11:286:24766:21:21:108:546:582:144:Times:144:Times:A:Tables  1–4  show  the  panel  regressions  for  cycles  in  government  primary  balances,  
11:287:24859:21:21:72:544:561:144:Times:144:Times:B:government  revenues,  government  spending,  and  inflation,  respectively.  Four  panel  models  are  
11:288:24963:21:20:72:540:540:144:Times:144:Times:B:estimated separately according to income groups: high-income (OECD) countries, upper-middle-
11:289:25055:20:21:72:458:520:144:Times:144:Times:B:income countries, lower–middle-income countries, and low-income countries.    
11:290:25133:21:21:108:546:499:144:Times:144:Times:A:For  each  fiscal  indicator,  there  are  6  regressions.  The  top  regression  provides  the  
11:291:25230:21:21:72:543:478:144:Times:144:Times:B:benchmark. The other five regressions allow for non-linearities in the responses to terms of trade 
11:292:25329:21:22:72:542:457:144:Times:144:Times:B:shocks.  Each  regression  includes  the  terms  of  trade  cycle;  the  coefficient  of  this  variable  is  β 
11:293:25440:22:21:71:543:435:144:Times:144:Times:B:(from Equation 3). The next variable captures the possible non-linear effects. The coefficient on 
11:294:25538:21:23:71:543:414:144:Times:144:Times:B:this variable is γ (from Equation 3). The final variable is the GDP cycle. The coefficient of this 
11:295:25637:23:21:72:228:391:144:Times:144:Times:B:variable is δ(from Equation 3). 
11:296:25669:21:21:108:544:370:144:Times:144:Times:A:Table  1  shows  the  relationship  between  cycles  in  fiscal  primary  balances  and  cycles  in  
11:297:25770:21:21:72:544:349:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  terms  of  trade  and  overall  GDP.  It  is  important  to  highlight  the  varied  responses  across  the  
11:298:25884:21:20:72:543:328:144:Times:144:Times:B:different income groups. First, fiscal balances in OECD countries increase when output is above 
11:299:25980:20:21:72:543:308:144:Times:144:Times:B:trend, suggesting the presence of countercyclical or acyclical fiscal policies.7 This is not the case 
11:300:26082:21:21:72:543:287:144:Times:144:Times:B:in developing countries. In middle-income countries, fiscal balances tend to decline when output 
11:301:26179:21:21:72:546:266:144:Times:144:Times:B:is  above  trend,  suggesting  more  procyclical  policies,  while  in  low-income  countries,  fiscal  
11:302:26283:21:20:72:543:245:144:Times:144:Times:B:balances are uncorrelated with GDP cycles. To examine whether the responses are economically 
11:303:26376:20:21:72:543:225:144:Times:144:Times:B:significant, I estimate the elasticity of fiscal balances to GDP cycles (evaluated at the mean value 
11:304:26477:21:21:72:544:204:144:Times:144:Times:B:of primary-balance and GDP cycles).8 The elasticities of primary balances with respect to GDP 
11:305:26571:21:31:72:544:183:144:Times:144:Times:B:cycles  are:  2.00  for  OECD  countries,  -0.60  for  upper-middle-income  countries,  and  -0.04  for  
11:306:26676:31:9:216:218:152:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:?:                                                            
11:307:26735:9:17:72:544:143:64:Times:100:Times:F:7 Even  if  government  expenditure  and  tax  rates  do  not  change  (acyclical  policy),  primary  balances  improve  with  
11:308:26861:17:14:72:157:126:100:Times:100:Times:F:increases in output.   
11:309:26884:14:17:72:543:112:64:Times:100:Times:F:8 I  use  the  mean  of  the  absolute  value  of  the  primary  balance  and  GDP  cycles  since  by  construction,  these  cycles  
11:310:27016:17:0:72:140:95:100:Times:144:Times:B:have zero mean. 
12:311:27034:0:20:72:540:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:lower-middle-income  countries,  indicating  strong  responses  in  both  high-income  and  upper-
12:312:27132:20:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:middle-income  countries.      Second,  fiscal  balances  in  OECD  and  low-income  countries  are  not  
12:313:27238:21:21:72:544:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:affected by terms of trade cycles.  Third, primary balances responses to terms of trade cycles in 
12:314:27336:21:20:72:544:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:middle-income  countries  are  affected  by  the  extent  of  liquidity  in  international  capital  markets,  
12:315:27447:20:21:72:544:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:episodes of terms of trade booms or busts, and exchange rate regimes.  As shown in regression 
12:316:27541:21:21:72:543:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:(1), in times of international capital market liquidity, the response of fiscal balances to terms of 
12:317:27642:21:20:72:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:trade  cycles  in  lower-middle-income  countries  is  negative,  with  the  fiscal  balance  deteriorating  
12:318:27751:20:21:72:543:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:in good times (when the terms of trade are above trend) and improving in bad times (when they 
12:319:27845:21:21:72:543:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:are below trend), suggesting procyclical responses to terms-of-trade fluctuations.    In the case of 
12:320:27946:21:21:72:548:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:upper-middle-income  countries,  the  response  of  fiscal  balances  to  terms  of  trade  cycles  while    
12:321:28055:21:20:72:545:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:still  positive  in  episodes  of  capital  flow  bonanza  it  is  significantly  smaller  indicating  a  less  
12:322:28167:20:21:72:544:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:countercyclical  policy  than  during  episodes  of  illiquidity  in  international  capital  markets.    For  
12:323:28278:21:21:72:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:upper-middle-income countries, the elasticity of fiscal balances to terms of trade cycles is equal 
12:324:28377:21:20:72:544:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:to  2.00  in  times  of  illiquid  international  capital  markets  and  1.00  in  episodes  of  capital  flow  
12:325:28489:20:21:72:545:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:bonanza.  The  corresponding  elasticity  for  lower-middle-income  countries  is  respectively  0.40  
12:326:28592:21:21:72:543:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:and -0.10.  Also, as shown in regression (2), there is evidence of asymmetric responses to terms 
12:327:28689:21:20:72:546:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:of  trade  booms  and  busts.  The  fiscal  balance  of  upper-  and  lower-middle-income  countries  
12:328:28791:20:21:72:543:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:responds less countercyclically in times of terms of trade booms. Again in this case, responses in 
12:329:28890:21:21:72:539:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:upper-middle-income  countries  are  stronger  in  terms  of  elasticity  (2.00  and  1.00  for  upper-
12:330:28993:21:20:72:543:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:middle-income countries and 0.30 and -0.10 for lower-middle-income countries, respectively for 
12:331:29088:20:21:72:543:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:times of terms of trade busts and for times of terms of trade booms).   Furthermore, as shown in 
12:332:29185:21:21:72:545:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:regression  (3),  responses  to  terms  of  trade  cycles  in  middle-income  countries  depend  on  the  
12:333:29291:21:21:72:544:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:exchange  rate  regime.  Flexible  exchange  rate  regimes  seem  to  fuel  more  countercyclical  fiscal  
12:334:29398:21:20:72:542:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:policies in both upper–middle and lower-middle-income countries, providing some support to the 
12:335:29493:20:21:72:545:212:144:Times:144:Times:B:model  in  Tornell  and  Velasco  (2000).    Third,  as  shown  in  regression  (4),  for  most  income  
12:336:29598:21:21:72:543:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:groups, the degree of persistence of terms of trade shocks does not seem to matter. Surprisingly, 
12:337:29696:21:20:72:543:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:primary balances of upper-middle-income countries tend to improve more in countries with more 
12:338:29790:20:20:72:544:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:persistent  terms  of  trade.9  Fourth,  responses  to  terms  of  trade  cycles  in  commodity-abundant  
12:339:29896:20:8:216:218:130:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:?:                                                            
12:340:29955:8:16:72:544:122:42:Times:100:Times:F:9  These  results  should  be  interpreted  with  caution  since  the  degree  of  persistence  of  terms  of  trade  shocks  is  
12:341:30085:16:12:71:543:106:100:Times:100:Times:F:estimated  by  using  information  on  the  evolution  of  terms  of  trade  for  all  of  the  sample  period.  Governments  in  
12:342:30215:12:0:71:545:94:100:Times:144:Times:B:contrast may underestimate or overestimate the degree of persistence of shocks by using available past information.    
13:343:30336:0:20:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries are significantly different from those in non-commodity  producing  economies  only  in  
13:344:30435:20:21:72:239:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:the upper–middle-income group.   
13:345:30468:21:21:108:542:667:144:Times:144:Times:A:Table 2 shows the responses of government revenues to fluctuations in the terms of trade. 
13:346:30558:21:20:72:543:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:As  in  the  previous  table,  all  the  regressions  control  for  cycles  in  GDP  and  allow  for  non-linear  
13:347:30672:20:21:72:544:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:responses  to  terms  of  trade  shocks.  While  the  results  in  this  table  indicate  that  fiscal  revenues  
13:348:30786:21:21:72:544:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:increase  with  output  across  all  groups  of  countries,  these  responses  are  far  stronger  in  OECD  
13:349:30895:21:20:72:543:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries. For the high-income group, the elasticity is equal to 0.80. In contrast, the elasticities of 
13:350:30999:20:21:72:542:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:government revenues with respect to the cycles in GDP vary from 0.03 for lower-middle-income 
13:351:31092:21:21:72:543:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries and 0.32 in low-income countries, with the elasticity of upper-middle-income countries 
13:352:31189:21:21:72:544:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:equal  to  0.12.  Again,  the  responses  to  terms  of  trade  cycles  in  middle-income  countries  are  
13:353:31296:21:20:72:543:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:different  from  those  in  OECD  and  low-income  countries.  In  OECD  and  low-income  countries,  
13:354:31398:20:21:72:544:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:government revenues are uncorrelated with terms of trade cycles. For middle-income countries, 
13:355:31492:21:21:72:544:460:144:Times:144:Times:B:Table  2  indicates  that  while  there  is  an  overall  positive  link  between  government  revenues  and  
13:356:31602:21:20:72:544:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:terms  of  trade  cycles  (a  sign  of  either  countercyclical  or  acyclical  responses  to  terms  of  trade  
13:357:31715:20:21:72:543:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:shocks), this link is weaker or even reversed in times of international capital flow bonanzas and 
13:358:31813:21:21:72:544:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:in  episodes  of  terms  of  trade  booms  (evidence  of  more  procyclical  responses  to  terms  of  trade  
13:359:31923:21:20:72:544:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:cycles).  Table  2  also  shows  that  the  exchange  rate  regime  affects  the  responses  of  government  
13:360:32032:20:21:72:546:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:revenues  to  terms  of  trade  cycles.  Again,  for  upper-middle-income  countries,  responses  of  
13:361:32134:21:21:72:544:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:government  revenues  to  terms  of  trade  cycles  tend  to  be  more  countercyclical  during  floating  
13:362:32241:21:20:72:547:315:144:Times:144:Times:B:exchange  rates,  with  elasticities  of  0.60  and  0.20  under  flexible  exchange  rate  and  fixed  
13:363:32345:20:21:72:547:295:144:Times:144:Times:B:exchange  rate  regimes,  respectively.  In  contrast,  for  lower-middle-income  countries,  fiscal  
13:364:32447:21:21:72:545:274:144:Times:144:Times:B:revenues  seem  to  become  more  procyclical  during  flexible  exchange  rate  regimes.  Lastly,  as  
13:365:32551:21:21:72:545:253:144:Times:144:Times:B:shown  in  Regression  5,  government  revenues  in  middle  income  countries  are  only  positively  
13:366:32654:21:20:72:388:232:144:Times:144:Times:B:related to terms of trade cycles in resource abundant countries.     
13:367:32723:20:21:108:544:212:144:Times:144:Times:A:Table  3  shows  the  responses  of  government  spending  to  terms  of  trade  cycles  and  the  
13:368:32822:21:21:72:542:191:144:Times:144:Times:B:overall business cycle. Supporting previous results in the literature, Table 3 shows that responses 
13:369:32922:21:20:72:547:170:144:Times:144:Times:B:to  GDP  cycles  in  OECD  countries  are  countercyclical,  while  they  are  procyclical  in  all  
13:370:33023:20:21:72:544:150:144:Times:144:Times:B:developing  countries  (as  captured  by  the  positive  and  statistically  significant  coefficient  of  the  
13:371:33135:21:21:72:544:129:144:Times:144:Times:B:GDP  cycle).  Responses  to  terms  of  trade  cycles  are  also  different  across  countries  in  different  
13:372:33246:21:0:72:543:108:144:Times:144:Times:B:income groups.  Overall, terms of trade cycles do not affect government spending in OECD and 
14:373:33342:0:20:72:547:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:low-income  countries.    Interestingly,  responses  of  government  spending  to  terms  of  trade  
14:374:33443:20:21:72:540:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:fluctuations  are  countercyclical  in  upper–middle-income  countries  but  procyclical  in  lower-
14:375:33543:21:21:72:543:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:middle-income  countries.  Importantly,  when  examining  the  role  of  the  exchange  rate  regime  in  
14:376:33649:21:20:72:545:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  responses  to  terms  of  trade  shocks,  the  evidence  suggests  that  government  spending  in  
14:377:33753:20:21:72:479:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:middle-income countries is countercyclical only when exchange rates are floating.    
14:378:33838:21:21:108:543:605:144:Times:144:Times:A:Table  4  links  inflation  to  fluctuations  in  the  terms  of  trade.  The  experience  in  low-  and  
14:379:33944:21:20:72:544:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:middle-income  countries  with  bouts  of  hyperinflation  and  overall  chronic  inflation  during  most  
14:380:34051:20:21:72:543:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:of  the  years  of  the  sample  examined  suggests  that  terms  of  trade  fluctuations  are  not  the  main  
14:381:34163:21:21:72:545:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:drivers  of  inflation.  The  results  in  Table  4  confirm  this  expectation.  The  evidence  for  OECD  
14:382:34271:21:21:72:550:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries   indicates   that   overall   inflation   increases   when   economic   activity   is   strong.   
14:383:34380:21:20:72:546:501:144:Times:144:Times:B:Interestingly,  inflation  declines  with  increases  in  the  terms  of  trade,  suggesting  perhaps  the  
14:384:34488:20:21:72:551:481:144:Times:144:Times:B:effects of lower commodity prices since most of the OECD countries are commodity importers.10    
14:385:34585:21:21:108:543:460:144:Times:144:Times:A:Table 5 examines in more detail the responses of the fiscal stance to terms of trade cycles 
14:386:34677:21:20:72:544:439:144:Times:144:Times:B:in  resource  abundant  countries.  This  table  only  reports  the  responses  in  upper-middle-income  
14:387:34782:20:21:72:544:419:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries because the results in Tables 1-3 indicate that it is in this group of countries where the 
14:388:34883:21:21:72:544:398:144:Times:144:Times:B:fiscal  stance  responds  significantly  different  in  commodity-producing  countries.  In  particular,  
14:389:34989:21:20:72:543:377:144:Times:144:Times:B:Table  5  explores  whether  responses  to  terms  of  trade  cycles  in  resource-abundant  countries  are  
14:390:35098:20:21:72:544:357:144:Times:144:Times:B:affected  by  episodes  of  capital  flow  bonanzas,  terms  of  trade  booms  and  busts,  and  fixed  and  
14:391:35207:21:23:72:410:336:144:Times:144:Times:B:flexible exchange rate regimes. The estimated regression in Table 5 is

14:394:35463:20:21:71:543:266:144:Times:144:Times:B:alternately  the  episodes  of  capital  flow  bonanzas,  booms  in  the  terms  of  trade,  and  episodes  of  
14:395:35575:21:21:71:224:245:144:Times:144:Times:B:flexible exchange rate regimes. 
14:396:35607:21:21:107:539:224:144:Times:144:Times:A:As  in  Tables  1-3,  the  results  in  Table  5  indicate  that  terms  of  trade  cycles  in  the  upper-
14:397:35714:21:20:71:543:203:144:Times:144:Times:B:middle-income group only affect the fiscal stance in commodity-abundant countries. While fiscal 
14:398:35810:20:21:71:544:183:144:Times:144:Times:B:policy in upper-middle-income countries is procyclical with respect to fluctuations in GDP, it is 
14:399:35908:21:21:71:550:162:144:Times:144:Times:B:countercyclical   with   respect   to   terms   of   trade   fluctuations.   However,   the   degree   of   
14:400:36016:21:23:71:543:141:144:Times:144:Times:B:countercyclicality declines sharply in episodes of capital flow bonanza and in times of booms in

14:402:36172:7:16:72:543:111:42:Times:100:Times:F:10 It may also reflect the effect of an appreciation of the exchange rate when the terms of trade are high. This is also 
14:403:36293:16:0:71:352:95:100:Times:144:Times:B:consistent with the stronger effect for flexible exchange rate regimes. 
15:404:36367:0:20:72:543:708:144:Times:144:Times:B:the terms of trade, suggesting that the claim that “all that glitters might not be gold” may in fact 
15:405:36468:20:21:72:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:B:have some support. In particular, the combination of booms in the terms of trade and the increase 
15:406:36566:21:21:72:544:667:144:Times:144:Times:B:in  liquidity  in  international  capital  markets  from  2003  to  2008  may  have  fueled  an  easy  fiscal  
15:407:36677:21:20:72:543:646:144:Times:144:Times:B:policy in commodity-abundant countries with access to international capital markets. In contrast, 
15:408:36775:20:21:72:544:626:144:Times:144:Times:B:the  results  in  Table  5  suggest  that  the  degree  of  countercyclicality  increases  during  episodes  of  
15:409:36888:21:21:72:543:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:flexible exchange rates. The results on the links between exchange rate regimes and fiscal policy 
15:410:36986:21:20:72:544:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:are  preliminary  and  need  to  be  examined  in  a  larger  sample  of  commodity-abundant  countries,  
15:411:37092:20:21:72:543:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:but the possibility that flexible exchange rates may contribute to less distortionary fiscal policies 
15:412:37194:21:33:72:195:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:merits our full attention.  
15:413:37222:33:33:72:151:510:144:Times:144:Times:B:V. Conclusions 
15:414:37236:33:20:108:544:477:144:Times:144:Times:A:This  paper  has  examined  the  links  between  the  fiscal  stance  and  terms  of  trade  cycles.  
15:415:37338:20:21:72:544:457:144:Times:144:Times:B:While  still  much  more  analysis  needs  to  be  undertaken  to  refine  our  understanding  of  the  links  
15:416:37449:21:21:72:544:436:144:Times:144:Times:B:between the terms of trade fluctuations and fiscal policies, the main findings of the paper can be 
15:417:37548:21:30:72:189:415:144:Times:144:Times:B:summarized as follows: 
15:418:37571:30:21:108:543:385:144:Times:144:Times:A:i) Confirming the results in the empirical literature, the results in this paper indicate that 
15:419:37665:21:21:126:543:364:144:Times:144:Times:A:fiscal policy is countercyclical in OECD countries (vis à vis GDP). In contrast, fiscal 
15:420:37753:21:20:126:422:343:144:Times:144:Times:A:policy is procyclical (vis à vis GDP) in developing countries. 
15:421:37816:20:21:108:545:323:144:Times:144:Times:A:ii) In  OECD  and  low-income  countries,  fiscal  policy  is  acyclical  with  regards  to  the  
15:422:37913:21:21:126:544:302:144:Times:144:Times:A:terms  of  trade.  Moreover,  the  responses  of  the  fiscal  stance  to  terms  of  trade  cycles  
15:423:38014:21:21:126:542:281:144:Times:144:Times:A:are not affected by international capital liquidity, exchange rate regimes, or the degree 
15:424:38104:21:20:126:274:260:144:Times:144:Times:A:of persistence of the shocks.    
15:425:38137:20:21:108:553:240:144:Times:144:Times:A:iii) For    upper-middle-income    countries,    there    is    evidence    of    fiscal    policy    
15:426:38238:21:21:126:550:219:144:Times:144:Times:A:countercyclicality   with   respect   to   the   terms   of   trade.   But   the   degree   of   
15:427:38335:21:20:126:543:198:144:Times:144:Times:A:countercyclicality declines in episodes of capital flow bonanzas or during episodes of 
15:428:38422:20:21:126:544:178:144:Times:144:Times:A:terms  of  trade  booms,  suggesting  that  in  those  episodes  these  countries  may  not  be  
15:429:38519:21:21:126:543:157:144:Times:144:Times:A:saving  enough  for  a  rainy  day.  Importantly,  flexible  exchange  rate  regimes  seem  to  
15:430:38615:21:20:126:366:136:144:Times:144:Times:A:contribute to a more countercyclical fiscal policy. 
15:431:38667:20:21:108:545:116:144:Times:144:Times:A:iv) For  lower-middle-income  countries,  there  is  even  evidence  suggesting  that  fiscal  
15:432:38761:21:0:126:543:95:144:Times:144:Times:A:policy responds procyclically to terms of trade fluctuations, that is, there is evidence 
16:433:38853:0:20:126:539:708:144:Times:144:Times:A:that fiscal policy contributes to reinforce the terms of trade cycle. Again, as in upper-
16:434:38942:20:21:126:543:688:144:Times:144:Times:A:middle-income  countries,  episodes  of  capital  flow  bonanza  and  terms  of  trade  boom  
16:435:39036:21:21:125:548:667:144:Times:144:Times:A:fuel   even   more   procyclicality   while   flexible   exchange   rate   regimes   enhance   
16:436:39131:21:20:125:234:646:144:Times:144:Times:A:countercyclicality.11    
16:437:39156:20:21:108:544:626:144:Times:144:Times:A:These  findings  suggest  that  the  boom  in  commodity  prices  during  the  latest  episode  of  
16:438:39256:21:21:72:545:605:144:Times:144:Times:B:capital  flow  bonanza  of  2003-2008  may  have  fueled  a  procyclical  policy  in  middle-income  
16:439:39357:21:20:72:545:584:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries  that  reinforced  the  terms  of  trade  cycle.  While  a  variety  of  models  explain  why  
16:440:39462:20:21:72:543:564:144:Times:144:Times:B:countries follow these suboptimal fiscal policies, we need to find mechanisms that would enable 
16:441:39558:21:21:72:544:543:144:Times:144:Times:B:macro-policies  to  be  conducted  in  a  neutral  or  stabilizing  way.  In  this  regard,  the  suggestive  
16:442:39668:21:21:72:534:522:144:Times:144:Times:B:results on flexible exchange rates for upper–middle-income countries deserve our full attention. 
16:443:39765:21:338:108:111:501:144:Times:144:Times:A: 
16:444:39765:338:8:216:218:163:121:g_d0_f1:121:g_d0_f1:?:                                                            
16:445:39824:8:18:72:545:155:64:Times:100:Times:F:11 I  should  note  that  in  lower-middle-income  countries,  flexible  exchange  rates  seem  to  contribute  to  lower  
16:446:39946:18:11:72:543:137:100:Times:100:Times:F:government  revenues  when  the  terms  of  trade  increase.  However,  this  effect  is  not  significant  from  an  economic  
16:447:40074:11:11:72:542:126:100:Times:100:Times:F:point of view.   The elasticity of the government revenues with respect to terms of trade cycles in these countries are 
16:448:40194:11:20:72:386:115:100:Times:100:Times:F:quite small: 0.04 for fixed exchange rates and 0 for flexible exchange rates.
