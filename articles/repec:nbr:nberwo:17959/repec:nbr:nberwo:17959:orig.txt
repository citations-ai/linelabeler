2:25:1032:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:We study a new data set of US sports card conventions in order to evaluate the pricing theory of two-sided
2:26:1138:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:markets. Conventions are two-sided because organizers must set fees to attract both consumers and
2:27:1235:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:dealers. We have detailed information on consumer price, dealer price and, since most conventions
2:28:1332:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:are local, the market structure for conventions. We present several findings: first, consumer pricing
2:29:1433:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:decreases with competition at any reasonable distance, but pricing to dealers is insensitive to competition
2:30:1540:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:and in longer distances even increases with competition. Second, when consumer price is zero (and
2:31:1637:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:thus constrained), dealer price decreases more strongly with competition. These results are compatible
2:32:1739:14:42:72:513:490:12:Times:12:Times:with existing models of two-sided markets, but are difficult to explain without such models.

3:46:2058:0:25:79:192:657:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:1  Introduction
3:47:2073:25:15:79:531:632:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:The theory of platform competition and two-sided markets is an important recent development in in-
3:48:2171:15:15:79:531:617:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:dustrial organization (see Armstrong, 2006; Caillaud & Jullien, 2003; Rochet & Tirole, 2006; Rysman,
3:49:2271:15:15:79:531:602:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:2009; Weyl, 2010; Hagiu & Wright, 2011), but empirical work has been restricted.  While the empirical
3:50:2372:15:15:79:531:587:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:literature is growing, we argue below that significant gaps remain.  In particular, there is little research
3:51:2480:15:15:79:531:572:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:that focuses on descriptive analysis of data sets with a large number of platforms or in relatively simple
3:52:2586:15:15:79:531:557:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:settings that are easily interpretable by theory.  This paper analyzes sports card conventions in the US,
3:53:2691:15:15:79:531:542:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:which must attract both buyers and sellers of cards to be successful.  We provide a series of empirical
3:54:2794:15:15:79:531:527:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:results, particularly about the relationship between competition and pricing, and especially competition
3:55:2898:15:15:79:531:512:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:that we expect affects one side more than the other.  Our results would be difficult to rationalize with a
3:56:3004:15:15:79:531:497:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:one-sided market model, but we argue that our results can be generated by a model based on two-sided
3:57:3104:15:14:79:531:482:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:markets.  The theory of two-sided markets is difficult to test in the sense of falsifiability because it is
3:58:3211:14:15:79:531:468:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:very  flexible.   Rather  than  a  direct  test,  our  aim  is  to  provide  descriptive  results  from  a  market  that
3:59:3331:15:15:79:531:453:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:appears  to  be  two-sided,  and  discuss  our  results  in  the  context  of  theoretical  models.   Our  results  go
3:60:3449:15:15:79:531:438:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:beyond existing theoretical models in that we consider markets with many platforms, whereas existing
3:61:3549:15:15:79:531:423:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:theoretical research considers markets with at most two.  Thus, we evaluate whether intuition obtained
3:62:3651:15:15:79:409:408:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:from duopoly markets can be extended to more complex market structures.
3:63:3722:15:15:94:531:393:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:By definition, two-sided markets involve two (or more) groups of agents in which (1) agents interact
3:64:3822:15:15:79:531:378:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:through  an  intermediary  and  (2)  participation  or  usage  of  each  group  affects  the  utility  of  the  other
3:65:3939:15:15:79:531:363:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:groups.  The intermediating firm is often referred to as a “platform” and each group of agent is referred
3:66:4044:15:15:79:531:348:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:to as one “side” of the market.  The economics of two-sided markets focus on agent’s choice of platform
3:67:4147:15:15:79:531:333:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:and  the  pricing  decisions  of  possibly  competing  platforms.1Hagiu  &  Wright  (2011)  argue  that  this
3:68:4256:15:15:79:391:318:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:literature would be better termed the study of “multi-sided platforms.”
3:69:4327:15:15:94:531:303:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:For example, consumers value video game consoles that are served by many game developers, and
3:70:4420:15:15:79:531:288:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:developers value consoles that attract many consumers.  In this case, the console producer is the platform
3:71:4526:15:15:79:531:273:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:firm, accounting for interactions between game players and game developers.  Similarly, a local sports
3:72:4628:15:15:79:531:258:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:card convention provides a platform for dealers of sports cards (most time acting as sellers) to interact
3:73:4733:15:15:79:531:243:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:with consumers that visit the convention.  Sports card dealers prefer conventions with many consumers
3:74:4834:15:15:79:450:228:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:(holding competition constant) and consumers prefer conventions with many dealers.
3:75:4916:15:14:94:531:213:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:For several reasons, sports card conventions provide an excellent environment to study the theory of
3:76:5016:14:15:79:531:199:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:two-sided markets, particularly for the relationship between platform pricing and platform competition.
3:77:5119:15:15:79:531:184:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:First, conventions are two-sided markets.  A successful convention requires both buyers and dealers to
3:78:5221:15:15:90:531:169:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:1This  focus  differentiates  the  literature  on  two-sided  markets  from  the  literature  on  network  effects.   The  definition
3:79:5354:15:12:79:531:154:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:of a two-sided market is very similar to the definition of a market with indirect network effects.  However, the literature
3:80:5477:12:11:79:531:142:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:on network effects tended to focus on technology adoption and network size, rather than the choices of the intermediary
3:81:5596:11:12:79:531:131:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:(although this distinction is not perfect).  For more on network effects, and definitional issues in two-sided markets, see
3:82:5719:12:0:79:350:119:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:Farrell & Klemperer (2007), Rochet & Tirole (2006) and Rysman (2009).
4:83:5789:0:15:79:531:657:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:appear  at  the  convention,  and  a  convention  organizer  must  take  this  into  account  in  setting  prices.
4:84:5903:15:15:79:531:642:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Second, pricing is very simple and observable.  Dealers and consumers pay separate entrance fees only.
4:85:6005:15:15:79:531:627:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:There  are  no  transaction  fees  or  other  complicating  issues.   We  observe  these  fixed  fees  in  a  set  of
4:86:6122:15:15:79:531:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:uniformly formatted classified advertisements in a trade magazine.  Third, there are a huge number of
4:87:6223:15:15:79:531:597:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:conventions in the United States, more than two thousand per month at the height of their popularity,
4:88:6324:15:15:79:531:582:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:which gives us tremendous leverage for econometric estimation, as well as important panel variation in
4:89:6426:15:15:79:155:567:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:market structure.
4:90:6443:15:15:94:531:552:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:In comparison, many two-sided markets (e.g.  yellow pages directories, radio, internet search engine)
4:91:6544:15:15:79:531:537:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:have zero price on one side and therefore restrict platform pricing to the other side only.  Contexts in
4:92:6648:15:15:79:531:522:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:which we see pricing on both sides are often complex.  For example, video games consoles are a canonical
4:93:6752:15:15:79:531:507:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:example of a two-sided market,  but the number of important platforms and game developers are less
4:94:6850:15:15:79:531:492:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:than 25, contracts are complex and secret, and technological change makes time series variation difficult
4:95:6955:15:15:79:132:477:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:to interpret.
4:96:6968:15:14:94:531:462:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We  highlight  several  empirical  results.   We  show  that  consumer  pricing  responds  to  increases  in
4:97:7076:14:15:79:531:448:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:competition  at  any  reasonable  distance.   However,  pricing  to  dealers  is  more  complex:   it  does  not
4:98:7188:15:15:79:531:433:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:respond to competition within relatively long distances,  up to 100 miles.  As we consider even longer
4:99:7290:15:15:79:531:418:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:distances,  past 100 miles,  dealer prices actually increase in competition.  We also distinguish between
4:100:7395:15:15:79:531:403:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:dealer pricing by conventions that allow free consumer admission and those that charge consumers.  We
4:101:7496:15:15:79:531:388:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:interpret conventions that charge free admission,  about half of our data set,  to be constrained on the
4:102:7600:15:15:79:531:373:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:consumer side.  We show that conventions with free consumer admission reduce the price to dealers in
4:103:7700:15:15:79:531:358:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:response to competition,  whereas conventions with positive consumer admission do not change dealer
4:104:7799:15:15:79:226:343:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:prices in response to competition.
4:105:7833:15:15:94:531:328:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We argue that these results are difficult to explain in a one-sided model:  why would price increase
4:106:7933:15:15:79:531:313:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:in or does not respond to competition if the firm has set price and responded negatively to competition
4:107:8036:15:15:79:531:298:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:for another product in the market?  However, these results arise naturally in reasonable models of two-
4:108:8139:15:15:79:531:283:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:sided  markets.   For  instance,  if  dealers  multi-home  (i.e.   attend  multiple  conventions)  and  consumers
4:109:8252:15:15:79:531:268:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:single-home (i.e.  attend a single convention), increased competition between conventions (for instance,
4:110:8356:15:15:79:531:253:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:exogenously moving them closer together) leads to lower prices for consumers but not for dealers.  The
4:111:8458:15:15:79:531:238:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:result that the single-homing side benefits more from competition than the multi-homing side is a common
4:112:8562:15:15:79:531:223:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:result and appears in a number of set-ups (see Rochet & Tirole, 2003; Armstrong, 2006; Gomes, 2011).
4:113:8662:15:15:79:531:208:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A second result is that if both sides single-home,  and consumer face higher travel costs than dealers,
4:114:8765:15:14:79:531:193:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:prices fall on the consumer side but can actually increase on the dealer side.  Intuitively, since increased
4:115:8873:14:15:79:531:179:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:competition  lowers  market  shares  of  consumers,  the  value  of  attracting  dealers  goes  down,  and  the
4:116:8984:15:15:79:531:164:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:platforms  raise  price.   This  result  can  be  inferred  from  Weyl  (2010)  and  we  present  a  model  in  the
4:117:9099:15:15:79:531:149:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:appendix that makes this point explicitly.  Thus, a model in which consumers single-home and dealers
4:118:9199:15:15:79:531:134:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:multi-home when competing conventions are nearby but single-home when they are far apart (i.e.  greater
4:119:9302:15:0:79:531:119:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:than 100 miles) generates the pricing pattern we observe.  Our discussions with industry participants
5:120:9404:0:15:79:354:657:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:suggest that this is a reasonable description of dealer behavior.
5:121:9469:15:15:94:531:642:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Armstrong & Wright (2007) and Gomes (2011) provide an interesting extension to the result that if
5:122:9566:15:15:79:531:627:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:one side multi-homes, competition does not affect prices on the multi-homing side.  If instead we consider

5:124:9776:15:15:79:531:597:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:price to fall on the multi-homing side.  This result is consistent with our finding that dealer prices fall
5:125:9883:15:15:79:531:582:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:in response to competition at conventions with free admission,  but do not do so for conventions with
5:126:9984:15:15:79:430:567:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:positive admission fees when dealers are likely to multi-home (within 100 miles).
5:127:10065:15:15:94:531:552:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Several papers seek to empirically evaluate two-sided markets.  Rysman (2004) estimates the positive

5:137:11076:15:15:94:531:403:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Our paper differs from previous research in that we directly study pricing decisions using a descriptive
5:138:11180:15:15:79:531:388:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:(or  “reduced-form”)  framework.   These  empirical  results  are  useful  because  predictions  about  pricing
5:139:11291:15:15:79:531:373:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:choices  are,  in  our  view,  the  major  results  of  the  two-sided  markets  literature  so  far.   By  taking  a
5:140:11408:15:15:79:531:358:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:reduced-form approach, we seek to shed light on whether correlations in the data are consistent with the
5:141:11512:15:15:79:531:343:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:proposed theories.  In contrast, most other papers that analyze pricing estimate an explicit theoretical
5:142:11616:15:15:79:531:328:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:model  using  structural  techniques,  which  makes  it  difficult  to  detect  if  the  model  does  not  hold.   A
5:143:11732:15:15:79:531:313:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:descriptive approach seems natural given that both the theoretical and empirical literatures are at such

5:146:11872:25:15:79:531:236:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Collecting sports cards and sports memorabilia is a popular pastime in the United States.  Sports cards
5:147:11975:15:15:79:531:221:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:are small cards with a picture of a professional player and the player’s statistics.  Baseball cards are the
5:148:12083:15:15:79:531:206:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:most popular.  Collectors value cards of top players in top or rookie years, as well as complete sets and
5:149:12188:15:15:79:531:191:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:well-produced cards.  Collectors are often interested in other types of memorabilia, such as game balls,
5:150:12292:15:15:79:531:176:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:jerseys or player signatures.  The popularity of collecting cards can vary a great deal, including seasonally
5:151:12401:15:15:79:531:161:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:with whether a sport is in season, and regionally with the success of the local team.  A major event in
5:152:12504:15:14:90:531:146:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:2A  related  empirical  literature  focuses  on  indirect  network  effects,  such  as  Gandal,  Kende  &  Rob  (2000),  Saloner  &
5:153:12635:14:12:79:531:132:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:Shepard  (1995)  and  Ackerberg  &  Gowrisankaran  (2006).   Consistent  with  the  theoretical  literature  on  network  effects,
5:154:12765:12:0:79:385:120:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:these papers focus on technology adoption rather than pricing by an intermediary.
6:155:12847:0:15:79:531:657:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:our data set is the labor strike in Major League Baseball in 1994, which hurt the popularity of the league
6:156:12953:15:15:79:218:642:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:and of collecting baseball cards.
6:157:12986:15:15:94:531:627:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Sports card conventions provide short events for dealers and consumers to come together.  While a
6:158:13083:15:15:79:531:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:number of dealers establish retail shops, many dealers trade entirely at conventions.  A small convention
6:159:13188:15:15:79:531:597:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:may  last  one  day  and  consist  of  10  tables  set  up  at  a  mall.   The  largest  conventions  have  more  than
6:160:13306:15:15:79:531:582:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:250 tables, last a week, and take over a large convention center in a major city.  Convention organizers
6:161:13410:15:15:79:531:567:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:rent  the  location,  advertise  the  convention  and  charge  fees  to  dealers  and  consumers.   Conventions
6:162:13521:15:15:79:531:552:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:sometimes  contract  for  the  appearance  of  professional  athletes  who  will  provide  signatures  for  free.
6:163:13634:15:15:79:531:537:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Organizers primarily profit from the entrance fees, although some organizers are also dealers who will
6:164:13736:15:15:79:531:522:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:trade cards at the convention.  Both the organizer and dealer markets are extremely unconcentrated and
6:165:13838:15:15:79:531:507:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:are characterized by many small participants, many of whom have separate full-time jobs unrelated to
6:166:13938:15:15:79:134:492:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:sports cards.
6:167:13951:15:15:94:531:477:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Pricing  at  conventions  is  very  simple.   Consumers  and  dealers  pay  a  fixed  fee  to  the  convention
6:168:14061:15:14:79:531:462:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:organizer.   Typically,  consumers  pay  less  than  $2,  with  about  half  of  the  conventions  in  our  data  set
6:169:14178:14:15:79:531:448:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:offering  free  admission.   Dealers  pay  the  “table  fee”,  typically  $25  to  $100.   The  table  fee  allows  the
6:170:14297:15:15:79:531:433:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:dealer to set up a table at the convention.  Prices at multi-day events may be more complicated, with
6:171:14398:15:15:79:531:418:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:prices varying by day (for instance, weekend prices are typically higher) or with lower per-day fees for
6:172:14502:15:15:79:531:403:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:admission over multiple days.  Also, we observe some discounts from the table fee for purchasing multiple
6:173:14607:15:15:79:112:388:10:g_d0_f2:7:g_d0_f3:tables.3
6:174:14615:15:15:94:531:373:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Our data set is based on the trade magazineBecket Baseball Card Monthly.  This magazine provides
6:175:14711:15:15:79:531:358:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:articles on baseball and collecting, market prices for a huge number of cards, and most importantly for
6:176:14814:15:15:79:531:343:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:our purpose, listings for sports card conventions (the “Convention Calendar”).  Listing is free and, as we
6:177:14920:15:15:79:531:328:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:understand it, every convention would be sure to place a listing in this magazine.  The magazine requires
6:178:15025:15:15:79:531:313:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:that listed conventions have at least 10 tables, although this does not appear to be binding (see below).
6:179:15130:15:15:79:531:298:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Each calendar covers the month of the issue, so the October 1997 issue has listings for all conventions in
6:180:15236:15:15:79:139:283:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:that October.
6:181:15249:15:15:94:531:268:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Our data set consists of the convention listings from a selection of issues of this magazine.  Convention
6:182:15354:15:15:79:531:253:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:organizers fill out a standard form and listings follow a uniform pattern, which is amenable to computer
6:183:15458:15:15:79:531:238:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:interpretation.  To create our data set,  we scanned all of the listings and used an Optimal Character
6:184:15560:15:15:79:531:223:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Recognition (OCR) program (in particular ABBYY PDF Transformer 1.0) to convert these scans to text
6:185:15658:15:15:79:531:208:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:files.   Then  we  wrote  computer  programs  to  parse  the  results  into  a  usable  data  set.   To  ensure  data
6:186:15775:15:14:79:487:193:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:quality, we compared the original copy with each parsed listing and corrected errors by hand.
6:187:15868:14:15:90:531:179:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:3In practice, dealers can buy from consumers and dealers can trade with other dealers, as can consumers with other
6:188:15982:15:12:79:531:164:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:consumers.  Hence, the important distinction is not who buys cards and who sells cards but who pays the table fee and
6:189:16099:12:12:79:531:152:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:who pays the consumer fee.  There could be substitution between entering with a table and not doing so.  Such substitution
6:190:16221:12:11:79:531:140:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:could be problematic for our theoretical predictions since it does appear in existing theoretical work, but should bias our
6:191:16344:11:0:79:366:129:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:results away from finding the differences between the two sides that we show.
7:192:16422:0:15:94:531:657:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Each convention lists the city or town in which it occurs.  We match these towns to a list of towns
7:193:16521:15:15:79:531:642:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:from the U.S. Census and assign the longitude and latitude of the town to the convention.  Hence, we
7:194:16621:15:15:79:531:627:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:assume that each convention is located in the population center of the town in which it occurs.4We
7:195:16719:15:15:79:531:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:drop conventions that do not occur in the continental United States.  We dropped some listings that did
7:196:16822:15:15:79:531:597:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:not provide town names that we could reliably match to a location in the census.  Altogether, we have
7:197:16923:15:15:79:315:582:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:data on 50,450 conventions in 36 months over 9 years.
7:198:16976:15:15:94:531:567:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:For each listing, we use the dates of the convention, the town and state, the number of tables, the
7:199:17075:15:15:79:531:552:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:admission fee for consumers and the table fee for dealers.5For prices,  we always took the price for a
7:200:17177:15:15:79:531:537:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:single day of admission if there were discounts for multi-day admission.  We used the simple average of
7:201:17280:15:15:79:531:522:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:prices if there were different prices for different days.  We took the price for a single table if there were
7:202:17389:15:15:79:205:507:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:discounts for multiple tables.
7:203:17419:15:15:94:531:492:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Our selection of magazines range from April, 1989 to December, 1997, for a total of 36 issues.  As the
7:204:17521:15:15:79:531:477:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:magazines are drawn from a personal collection, it is not a continuous set of magazines.6We purposely
7:205:17622:15:14:79:531:462:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:stopped collecting data after 1997, which coincides with the popularity of the World Wide Web.  There
7:206:17723:14:15:79:531:448:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:is a significant decline in the number of conventions during the late 1990s which makes our approach
7:207:17823:15:15:79:531:433:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:difficult since we rely on the presence of competition to create our tests.7Table 1 lists the issues of the
7:208:17930:15:15:79:531:418:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:magazine in the data set, along with the number of conventions in each issue.  Figure 1 graphs this series.
7:209:18037:15:15:79:531:403:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:There is a peak in activity in the Summer and Fall of 1992 when there are regularly more than 2000
7:210:18135:15:15:79:531:388:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:conventions in a month.  There is a steady decline afterwards, presumably due to the baseball strike in
7:211:18238:15:15:79:505:373:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:1994 and the popularity of the Internet.  In 1997, there are less than 1000 conventions per month.
7:212:18336:15:15:94:531:358:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We are interested in oligopoly interactions, so it is useful to get a sense of the number of conventions
7:213:18440:15:15:79:531:343:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:in any given region.  Table 1 provides the mean number of conventions per 3-digit zip code by month for
7:214:18543:15:15:79:531:328:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:zip codes that have at least one convention.  The overall average is 3.15, and this ranges from 1.90 to
7:215:18646:15:15:79:531:313:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:4.35 in months with low and high activity.  Not surprisingly, the distribution underlying these means is
7:216:18750:15:15:79:531:298:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:highly skewed.  Table 2 displays the number of 3-digit zip code-months with each count of the number
7:217:18850:15:15:79:531:283:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of conventions.  For instance, there are 6,886 zip code-months in which we observe only 1 convention in
7:218:18953:15:14:90:531:268:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:4The listings provide addresses which in principle could be used to more accurately identify locations.  However, many
7:219:19071:14:12:79:531:254:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:addresses are descriptive (“VFW Hall” or “Westgate Mall”) and therefore are difficult to geocode.  Even for the entries
7:220:19190:12:7:79:349:242:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:that provide a street address, cleaning them would be an enormous task.
7:221:19261:7:15:90:531:235:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:5We discarded some information:  the exact location,  the times of day of each convention and the contact name and
7:222:19375:15:8:79:411:220:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:number.  The contact names are potentially very interesting but difficult to clean reliably.
7:223:19467:8:14:90:531:212:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:6Our collection of magazines is drawn from those we found for sale at several conventions, and some contributions from
7:224:19585:14:12:79:531:198:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:John List (for which we are very grateful).  We made a number of attempts to find missing issues, for instance at public
7:225:19705:12:7:79:314:186:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:libraries.  We believe that our selection of magazines is random.
7:226:19770:7:15:90:531:179:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:7The impact of the Web on the convention market represents an interesting topic in its own right,  as in Goldmanis,
7:227:19885:15:12:79:531:164:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:Hortascu, Syverson & Emre (2010) for booksellers and travel agents.  Jin & Kato (2007) present a detailed study on the

9:266:21681:52:15:79:531:409:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:a month,  which represents 43.04 percent of the data.  Zip code-months with three or less conventions
9:267:21782:15:15:79:531:394:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:represent almost 75% of the data, and 10 or less represents 95% of the data.  There is a tail of observations
9:268:21891:15:15:79:531:379:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:with a large number of conventions, the maximum being 49 conventions in a 3 digit zip code in a single
9:269:21993:15:15:79:110:364:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:month.
9:270:21999:15:15:94:531:349:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:The number of tables at a convention is an important explanatory variable for price.  We treat the
9:271:22097:15:15:79:531:334:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:number  of  tables  as  an  exogenous  measure  of  the  quality  of  the  convention.   Clearly,  the  quantity  of
9:272:22213:15:15:79:531:319:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:dealers that purchase a table at the convention may be endogenous to the price of a table.  However, the
9:273:22317:15:15:79:531:304:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:“number of tables” listed in the calendar is determined well before the final count of how many dealers
9:274:22420:15:14:79:531:289:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:will appear.  We regard the posted number as “cheap talk” that serves to inform readers of the expected
9:275:22523:14:15:79:531:275:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:size of the event.  Consider that the “number of tables” variable falls disproportionately on multiples of 5
9:276:22631:15:15:79:531:260:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:(like 10, 15, 20 etc.), unlike a true measure of quantity.  The variable is also highly correlated with other
9:277:22740:15:15:79:531:245:10:g_d0_f2:7:g_d0_f3:measures of quality, such as the number and quality of athletes that will be available to sign autographs.8
9:278:22847:15:15:79:531:230:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Thus,  we interpret the number of tables to capture in reduced form both the effect of the number of
9:279:22947:15:15:79:531:215:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:tables  and  the  effect  of  other  correlated  quality  variables.   As  the  number  of  tables  is  not  verified  by
9:280:23068:15:15:79:531:200:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:our data source,  organizers could choose it in a misleading way.  Our approach assumes the extent of
9:281:23169:15:15:79:364:185:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:misrepresentation does not vary systematically with competition.
9:282:23233:15:13:94:531:170:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Table 3 describes the distribution of the number of tables.  The mean is 41.6 and the median is 35.
9:283:23332:13:15:90:531:157:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:8We  do  not  observe  other  measures  of  quality.   However,  some  conventions  take  out  display  advertisements  in  the
9:284:23459:15:11:79:531:142:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:calendar  section,  and  from  these  it  is  clear  that  larger  conventions  offer  extra  features  such  as  autograph  sessions  with
9:285:23598:11:0:79:213:131:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:athletes, door prizes and free raffles.

10:301:23909:30:15:79:531:402:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:The  distribution  is  approximately  log  normal.   The  99th  percentile  is  160.   The  magazine  states  that
10:302:24023:15:15:79:531:387:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:conventions have at least 10 tables to be listed but this does not appear to be binding.  A number of
10:303:24124:15:15:79:531:372:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:conventions list less than 10 tables and the number of conventions listing 10 is not large compared to
10:304:24226:15:15:79:531:357:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:surrounding numbers.  For instance, 589 conventions list 10 tables and 1,502 list 15, and 4,212 list 20.
10:305:24330:15:14:79:531:342:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We  find  missing  listings  or  listing  of  0  number  of  tables  at  1,853  observations  and  drop  these  in  our

10:307:24466:15:15:94:531:313:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Most conventions, 77.1%, last only one day.  Almost all (98.8%) last three days or less.  Most take
10:308:24565:15:15:79:531:298:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:place on weekends.  In our data, 49% cover a Saturday, 53.7% cover a Sunday, and 81% cover Saturday
10:309:24664:15:15:79:125:283:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:or Sunday.
10:310:24674:15:15:94:531:268:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:The dependent variables in our empirical work are the prices.  Table 4 displays the distribution of
10:311:24773:15:15:79:531:253:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the table fee.  The mean is $43.7 and the median is $35.  The distribution is approximately log normal,
10:312:24876:15:15:79:531:238:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:with a long tail of expensive conventions.  The 99th percentile is $165 but we observe a few with table
10:313:24979:15:15:79:183:223:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:fees greater than $1000.
10:314:25003:15:15:94:531:208:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A striking feature of the distribution of the admission fee is that 52.9% of conventions feature free
10:315:25104:15:15:79:531:193:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:admission.  A further 29.6% charge a fee of $1.  There is little further variation, with much of it falling
10:316:25211:15:15:79:531:178:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:on multiples of 50 cents.  The 95th percentile is $2.  These features lead us to model the admission fee
10:317:25315:15:15:79:531:163:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:as a binary variable so we simply predict whether admission is free or not.  With more than 80% of the
10:318:25417:15:15:79:531:148:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:observations choosing 0 or 1, this seems like a decent approximation.  Figure 2 graphs the distribution
10:319:25520:15:0:79:221:133:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of admission fees in a histogram.

11:345:26268:15:15:79:531:309:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:one day that overlaps with the convention in question.  As stated above, we calculate distance based on
11:346:26371:15:15:79:531:294:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the latitude and longitude of the relevant towns in the U.S. Census.  Table 5 provides the average number
11:347:26476:15:14:79:531:279:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of competitors by different distances.  Note that when computing the “within three days” variable, we
11:348:26577:14:15:79:531:265:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:treat the observation as missing for any convention for which we do not have data on conventions within
11:349:26680:15:15:79:531:250:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:three days.  So for instance, a convention on April 30, 1989 would be problematic since we do not have
11:350:26782:15:15:79:531:235:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the May,  1989 issue so we cannot count all conventions within three days.  Hence,  Table 5 displays a
11:351:26884:15:15:79:531:220:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:lower number of observations for the “within three days” row than the “same day” row.  Given that the
11:352:26985:15:15:79:531:205:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:great majority of conventions appear on the weekends, we interpret “within three days” as essentially
11:353:27086:15:15:79:531:190:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:meaning “same weekend”.  Because of these small numbers and the very local nature of the organizing
11:354:27185:15:15:79:531:175:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:market, we expect organizers to know with some accuracy in advance the number of conventions they
11:355:27282:15:15:79:531:160:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:will face on any given day.  Hence, prices respond to competition although prices and competition are
11:356:27383:15:15:79:243:145:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:announced publicly at the same time.
11:357:27419:15:0:94:531:130:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A final element of our data set is our contact with card convention organizers.  We interviewed several
12:358:27524:0:15:79:531:657:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:convention organizers via e-mail.  Their answers were similar and were sufficient to get a sense of how our
12:359:27631:15:15:79:531:642:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:issues were regarded by industry participants.  Our questions were focused on the nature of competition
12:360:27734:15:15:79:531:627:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:between conventions, as well as competition with other sources of memorabilia. We asked about strategies
12:361:27838:15:15:79:531:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:that organizers used to maintain successful conventions and we were particularly interested in whether
12:362:27940:15:15:79:531:597:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:consumers and dealers were likely to be attending multiple conventions.  The basic results were consistent
12:363:28046:15:15:79:531:582:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:with how we characterize the theoretical models of the market.  Dealers are likely to travel further (have
12:364:28152:15:15:79:531:567:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:lower travel costs) than consumers.  For a dealer, 100 miles was feasible but more than 200 miles of travel
12:365:28259:15:15:79:531:552:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:was unlikely.  Larger dealers might attend multiple conventions in the same weekend, but would probably
12:366:28362:15:15:79:531:537:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:not be willing to do so if it meant long travel times.  Also, our participants regard theBecketmagazine
12:367:28465:15:37:79:209:522:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:as a very reliable data source.
12:368:28496:37:25:79:165:485:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:3  Empirics
12:369:28507:25:15:79:531:460:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:In this section, we present a series of regressions that further explore this data set.  In the next section,
12:370:28616:15:15:79:429:445:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:we interpret the results from the perspective of the theory of two-sided markets.
12:371:28697:15:15:94:531:430:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:In addition to considering issues of two-sided markets,  we must also address econometric issues of
12:372:28796:15:15:79:531:415:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:unobserved heterogeneity and omitted variable bias.  These issues are important when we consider the
12:373:28896:15:15:79:531:400:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:relationship between pricing and competition.  Demand factors are not entirely observable, and we expect
12:374:29000:15:15:79:531:385:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:that high unobservable demand will lead both to high prices and to more entry, which creates bias in
12:375:29100:15:15:79:531:370:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:our estimates.  We address this issue by including location fixed effects, where locations are indicated by
12:376:29207:15:15:79:153:355:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:3-digit zip codes.
12:377:29225:15:14:94:531:340:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:To  see  how  our  strategy  works,  we  start  with  regressions  of  price  on  nearby  competition.   These
12:378:29335:14:15:79:531:326:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:regressions  do  not  address  any  issues  raised  by  two-sided  markets  but  rather  serve  to  verify  that  our
12:379:29452:15:15:79:531:311:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:fixed effects strategy works appropriately.  Results appear in Table 6.  In the first two columns, we have
12:380:29558:15:15:79:531:296:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:results from a linear probability model predicting when admission fees are not zero, as a function of the
12:381:29663:15:15:79:213:281:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:number of nearby competitors.
12:382:29692:15:15:94:531:266:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We do not include location fixed effects in the first two columns.  We do however include time fixed
12:383:29792:15:15:79:531:251:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:effects, at the level of the month, and controls for the days of the week.9We include time fixed effects
12:384:29896:15:15:79:531:236:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:and day-of-the-week controls in all specifications in this paper, although we do not report their effects.
12:385:30002:15:15:79:531:221:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We include one control variable in all of the regressions:  the log of the number of tables.  We interpret
12:386:30108:15:15:90:531:206:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:9Our  controls  for  the  days  of  the  week  consist  of  dummy  variables  for  each  combination  of  days  that  appear  in  our
12:387:30241:15:11:79:531:191:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:data set more than 500 times.  For instance, there is a dummy variable for Saturday-only conventions, one for Sunday-only
12:388:30362:11:12:79:531:180:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:conventions, and a separate dummy for conventions on both Saturday and Sunday.  The full set of dummy variables capture
12:389:30481:12:12:79:531:168:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:97% of the data set.  We also include the duration of the convention (1, 2 or 3 days), which serves to better match the
12:390:30600:12:12:79:531:156:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:remaining 3% of conventions.  We do not report any of these results in the paper.  In all regressions, we reduce heterogeneity
12:391:30726:12:12:79:531:144:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:by dropping conventions that last more than three days, although we still use them for purposes of computing the number
12:392:30845:12:0:79:135:132:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:of competitors.
13:393:30862:0:15:79:531:657:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:this variable as a control for the quality of the convention and, not surprisingly, it is positive and both
13:394:30969:15:15:79:352:642:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:economically and statistically significant in every specification.
13:395:31035:15:15:94:531:627:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:In column 1 of Table 6, we define competition to be the log of the number of competitors within 25
13:396:31133:15:15:79:531:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:miles, and in column 2 we use 50 miles.  We add one to the number of competitors to address log zero
13:397:31233:15:15:79:531:597:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:issues.  In both cases, we see that competition is positive and statistically significant, as if competition
13:398:31341:15:15:79:531:582:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:caused higher prices.  However, this result appears to be driven by unobserved geographic heterogeneity.
13:399:31445:15:15:79:531:567:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:In columns 3 and 4, we include location fixed effects.  In this specification, we see that competition has
13:400:31551:15:15:79:531:552:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:a negative effect on the likelihood of setting a non-zero admission fee and that this effect is significantly
13:401:31660:15:15:79:531:537:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:different from zero at a confidence level of 1%.  Our results are robust to using Chamberlain’s conditional
13:402:31767:15:15:79:531:522:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:logit model (Chamberlain, 1980) to predict the probability of using a positive admission fee with location
13:403:31873:15:15:79:531:507:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:fixed effects.  We conclude from this regression that our measure of competition and our fixed effects
13:404:31975:15:15:79:363:492:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:strategy addresses the omitted variable problem, at least in part.
13:405:32041:15:15:94:531:477:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We see similar results when we use the log of the table fee as the dependent variable.  We use a linear
13:406:32144:15:14:79:531:462:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:model for the log of the table fee and estimate with linear panel data techniques.  In the first two columns
13:407:32252:14:15:79:531:448:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of the second panel in Table 6, we present results without location fixed effects.  In these cases, the effect
13:408:32362:15:15:79:531:433:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of competition on price is estimated to be statistically insignificant, and is very close to zero.  However,
13:409:32470:15:15:79:531:418:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the next two columns include location fixed effects, and here we see that competition has a negative and
13:410:32574:15:15:79:531:403:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:statistically significant effect for distances of both 25 and 50 miles.  The effect is not large – the elasticity
13:411:32687:15:15:79:531:388:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:is around -0.02.  But we believe this to be an upper bound due to the positive correlation induced by
13:412:32788:15:15:79:246:373:10:g_d0_f2:7:g_d0_f3:remaining unobserved heterogeneity.10
13:413:32825:15:15:94:531:358:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Note that the number of observations is slightly lower when we use the table fee because the table
13:414:32923:15:15:79:531:343:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:fee is missing for a number of observations.  Restricting the admissions fee regressions to observations in
13:415:33030:15:15:79:531:328:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:which the table fee is present does not change results.  For both admission fee and table fee regressions
13:416:33135:15:15:79:531:313:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:with fixed effects, some observations are dropped because the dependent variable does not vary within a
13:417:33238:15:15:79:117:298:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:zip code.
13:418:33247:15:15:94:531:283:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:The focus of our interest is on the asymmetric effect of competition on the two sides of the market.
13:419:33347:15:15:79:531:268:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:To  the  extent  that  distance  affects  consumers  and  dealers  differently,  we  capture  the  asymmetry  by
13:420:33459:15:15:79:531:253:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:distinguishing between “near competition” and “far competition.” We define near to be those conventions
13:421:33562:15:15:79:531:238:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:within 25 or 50 miles, and far to be those within 100 or 150 miles, not including near competitors.  Again,
13:422:33669:15:15:79:402:223:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:we require all competitors to overlap in calendar time by at least one day.
13:423:33744:15:15:94:531:208:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We report the results of near and far competition in Table 7.  In the first panel, we see that for all
13:424:33846:15:14:79:531:193:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:definitions of distance, an increase in both near and far competition makes free admission more likely.
13:425:33949:14:15:79:293:179:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:All effects are significant at 1% confidence levels.
13:426:34001:15:15:94:531:164:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:In the second panel, we see that near competition also drives down table fees, and does so with effects
13:427:34104:15:15:79:531:149:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:similar to what we found in Table 6.  However, far competition measured within a 100 mile radius has
13:428:34204:15:15:87:531:134:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:10Note that the negative coefficient on dealer prices is not predicted by the theory of two-sided markets, but we show
13:429:34322:15:0:79:446:119:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:below that it is explained by the conventions that do not charge admission, consistent with theory.

14:450:35280:32:15:79:531:465:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:no significant effect on table fees, and far competition measured within 150 miles has apositiveeffect on
14:451:35385:15:15:79:531:450:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:prices.  The key feature of our empirical result is the pairing of the negative coefficient on one side of the
14:452:35495:15:15:79:346:435:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:market with the zero or positive coefficient on the other side.
14:453:35558:15:15:94:531:420:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Obviously,  a  positive  effect  of  competition  or  even  a  zero  effect  is  hard  to  explain  with  standard
14:454:35672:15:15:79:531:405:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:models. We argue below that it is consistent with a reasonable model of two-sided markets. An alternative
14:455:35777:15:15:79:531:390:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:explanation for the positive coefficient on far competition is that it is due to endogenous entry, so that
14:456:35883:15:15:79:531:375:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:unobserved temporal-geographic heterogeneity causes this result.  However, this idea is hard to formulate
14:457:35988:15:15:79:531:360:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:because we include time and location fixed effects and because we find a negative coefficient on nearby
14:458:36091:15:15:79:531:345:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:competition.  While it is plausible that there is heterogeneity that varies over time and space jointly, it
14:459:36198:15:14:79:531:330:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:must also somehow operate in a wider area more strongly than a local area, and affect the two sides of
14:460:36300:14:0:79:228:316:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the market in an asymmetric way.
16:461:37766:0:15:94:531:657:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We  also  study  whether  conventions  constrained  that  allow  free  admission  to  consumers  set  dealer
16:462:37874:15:15:79:531:642:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:prices differently in response to competition than conventions that charge admissions.  For these pur-
16:463:37976:15:15:79:531:627:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:poses, we additionally project dealer price onto a dummy variable for whether the convention offers free
16:464:38080:15:15:79:531:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:admission, and importantly, the interaction of the dummy with the log of nearby competition.  We inter-
16:465:38183:15:15:79:531:597:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:pret conventions that allow free admission to be price-constrained.  Presumably these conventions would
16:466:38286:15:15:79:531:582:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:not reduce their fee in response to small changes in exogenous variables.  There is a sense in which every
16:467:38392:15:15:79:531:567:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:convention is constrained as they tend to use round numbers for the admission fee so it does not appear
16:468:38495:15:15:79:531:552:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:to be a truly continuous choice variable.  However, we view the conventions with free admission as the
16:469:38597:15:15:79:531:537:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:“most constrained” conventions:  they would be least likely to adjust their admission fee in response to
16:470:38701:15:15:79:531:522:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:changes in market variables.  In theory, conventions could use raffle tickets or door prizes to implement
16:471:38806:15:15:79:531:507:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:a sort of negative price, but these should be inefficient instruments to pay consumers relative to actual
16:472:38911:15:15:79:531:492:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:price, so we still view conventions with free admission as price constrained.  We discuss the theoretical
16:473:39016:15:15:79:531:477:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:treatment of price constraints in the next section, but as we argue, the theoretical models do not depend
16:474:39121:15:14:79:531:462:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:on competition affecting one side more than the other, which is why we focus the interaction term on
16:475:39221:14:15:79:337:448:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:“near” competition, which affects both sides of the market.
16:476:39280:15:15:94:531:433:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Results appear in the third panel of Table 7.  In these columns, the coefficient on nearby competition
16:477:39382:15:15:79:531:418:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:becomes  insignificant  and  precisely  estimated  near  zero.   Instead,  we  see  a  negative  and  significant
16:478:39495:15:15:79:531:403:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:coefficient  on  the  interaction  term,  with  a  substantially  higher  magnitude  than  we  found  on  nearby
16:479:39607:15:15:79:531:388:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:competition  in  panel  2.   That  is,  the  negative  effect  of  nearby  competition  that  we  observed  earlier
16:480:39722:15:15:79:531:373:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:appears  to  be  coming  from  the  constrained  firms.   Thus,  constrained  firms  respond  more  strongly  to
16:481:39834:15:15:79:531:358:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:competition than unconstrained firms.11As before, we see no effect of far competition when measured
16:482:39933:15:15:79:348:343:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:at 100 miles and a positive and significant effect at 150 miles.
16:483:39997:15:15:94:531:328:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:These set of results motivate us to try a final, more ambitious regression that captures our “entire
16:484:40097:15:15:79:531:313:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:story” in a single regression.  We predict table fees with separate variables to control for near competition
16:485:40206:15:15:79:531:298:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:(less than 50 miles), far competition (50-100 miles), very far competition (100-250 miles) and out-of-range
16:486:40313:15:15:79:531:283:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:competition (250-400 miles). We also interact near competition with a dummy for free admission. Results
16:487:40416:15:15:79:531:268:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:for the table fee appear in Column 1 of Table 8.  Results are largely consistent with our earlier findings.
16:488:40523:15:15:79:531:253:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We find no effect of competition more than 250 miles away, which we interpret as being too far to be in
16:489:40626:15:15:79:531:238:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the relevant market.  We find a positive effect on competition for the 100-250 mile range, and we find
16:490:40728:15:15:79:531:223:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:competition  has  no  effect  on  dealer  prices  in  the  50-100  mile  range.   We  find  a  negative  effect  in  the
16:491:40848:15:15:79:531:208:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:nearby range (less than 50 miles) for conventions that do not charge admission.  Unlike in the previous
16:492:40951:15:14:79:531:193:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:regression, we find that competition within 50 miles has a negative effect even for conventions that charge
16:493:41058:14:15:79:124:179:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:admission.
16:494:41068:15:15:94:531:164:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:For our story to be complete,  we should also find that the effect of competition on admission fees
16:495:41167:15:15:79:531:149:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:is negative over the 0-250 mile range and zero outside of that range.  Column 2 of Table 8 estimates
16:496:41267:15:15:87:531:134:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:11Note that both admission and table fees are determined simultaneously so there is a potential endogeneity problem
16:497:41382:15:0:79:390:119:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:with including admission fees on the right-hand side.  We discuss this further below.

17:521:42199:15:15:79:531:379:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the  table  fee.   We  find  significantly  negative  coefficients  for  0-50  and  50-100.   However,  we  we  find  a
17:522:42318:15:15:79:531:364:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:zero coefficient for 100-250 and positive coefficient for the 250-400 range.  We prefer the specification in
17:523:42426:15:15:79:531:349:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Column 3, in which we restrict the model to have the same coefficient for 50-100 and 100-250.  In this
17:524:42528:15:15:79:461:334:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:case, we find the expected results of negative coefficients on 0-250 and zero for 250-400.
17:525:42618:15:15:94:531:319:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Note  that  all  results  in  Tables  6,  7  and  8  are  robust  to  using  standard  errors  that  are  clustered
17:526:42733:15:15:79:531:304:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:at the level of the location-month.  The one exception is the surprising positive coefficient on the 250-
17:527:42838:15:15:79:531:289:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:400 range in Column 2 in Table 8.  Under clustering, this coefficient is not significantly different from
17:528:42943:15:15:79:531:274:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:zero, which conforms to our expectations for this coefficient.  One issue that clustering addresses is that
17:529:43050:15:14:79:531:259:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:location-months with many conventions count more in the regression results.  Also, all results on sign
17:530:43152:14:15:79:531:245:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:and significance in the admission fee regressions are robust to switching to Chamberlain’s conditional

17:533:43283:25:15:79:531:167:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:The previous section establishes a set of stylized facts drawn from a two-sided market.  We find that
17:534:43384:15:15:79:531:152:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:competition at any relevant distance decreases consumer admission prices.  However, prices for dealers
17:535:43486:15:14:79:531:137:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:are more complex.  In this section, we argue that set of results is consistent with the theory of two-sided
17:536:43593:14:0:79:531:123:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:markets.  These theories are very flexible and perhaps could generate a variety of results.  However, we
18:537:43699:0:15:79:459:657:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:argue that the set of assumptions that generate our results are natural for this market.
18:538:43787:15:15:94:531:642:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Among  the  most  widely  accepted  implications  of  the  theoretical  literature  on  competition  in  two-
18:539:43896:15:15:79:531:627:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:sided markets is that competition between platforms affects the side that single-homes much more than
18:540:43997:15:15:79:531:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the  side  that  multi-homes.   For  instance,  this  result  appears  in  Armstrong  (2006),  Rochet  &  Tirole
18:541:44109:15:15:79:531:597:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:(2003), and Gomes (2011).  Assuming that dealers are more likely to multi-home than consumers, that
18:542:44208:15:15:79:531:582:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:implies that competition affects consumer prices more than dealer prices.  Intuitively, the only way for
18:543:44312:15:15:79:531:567:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:dealers to reach consumers is through the convention that the consumer chooses.  Hence, the convention
18:544:44414:15:15:79:531:552:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:has  monopoly  power  over  the  dealer  for  access  to  its  consumers.   This  makes  competition  to  attract
18:545:44527:15:15:79:531:537:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:consumers particularly intense.  There is no competition to attract dealers, since multihoming implies
18:546:44629:15:15:79:531:522:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:that  the  decision  of  dealers  is  separable  across  conventions.   Thus,  an  increase  in  competition  among
18:547:44744:15:15:79:531:507:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:conventions (for instance, by exogenously moving conventions closer together or by adding one to the
18:548:44844:15:15:79:458:492:10:g_d0_f2:7:g_d0_f3:market) creates lower prices for consumers but much less so, or not at all for dealers.12
18:549:44933:15:15:94:531:477:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Interestingly,  Armstrong (2006) provides a similar result in the case in which both consumers and
18:550:45031:15:14:79:531:462:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:dealers single-home.  In that case, increasing competition on one side of the market but not the other
18:551:45133:14:15:79:531:448:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:lowers prices on that side, but does not affect prices on the other.13However, this result is driven by
18:552:45236:15:15:79:531:433:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the  assumption  that  both  sides  of  the  market  are  fully  served  by  the  conventions.   Thus,  there  is  no
18:553:45353:15:15:79:251:418:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:market-expansion effect to lower prices.
18:554:45393:15:15:94:531:403:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:To  capture  a  more  realistic  case  in  which  some  agents  choose  not  to  attend either  convention,  we
18:555:45504:15:15:79:531:388:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:present a formal theoretical model in the appendix.  In our model, consumers and dealers are distributed
18:556:45608:15:15:79:531:373:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:uniformly  on  separate  “Hotelling”  lines.   Two  conventions  have  separate  locations  on  each  line.   The
18:557:45721:15:15:79:531:358:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:conventions are not at the end points of the lines. Rather, the lines extend far enough past the conventions
18:558:45829:15:15:79:531:343:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:in both directions that there is always a market expansion effect to lower prices.  Conventions choose
18:559:45931:15:15:79:531:328:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:fees simultaneously, separately setting both a consumer and dealer admission fee.  Then, consumers and
18:560:46033:15:15:79:531:313:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:dealers  simultaneously  decide  which  convention  to  attend,  accounting  for  their  travel  costs,  the  fees,
18:561:46148:15:15:79:531:298:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:and the number of agents on the other side.  We consider parameters such that in equilibrium, agents
18:562:46248:15:15:79:531:283:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:between  the  conventions  are  fully  served  whereas  some  agents  on  the  sides  choose  not  to  participate.
18:563:46363:15:15:79:531:268:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Thus, our model extends Armstrong (2006) to allow for a market expansion effect.  While the model does
18:564:46465:15:15:79:531:253:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:not generate easily interpretable equations, numeric solutions replicate all of the theoretical results that
18:565:46573:15:15:79:343:238:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:we discuss for both single-homing and multi-homing dealers.
18:566:46632:15:15:94:531:223:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Our presentation in the appendix focuses on the case in which single-homing consumers and dealers
18:567:46729:15:14:79:531:208:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:since this generates a striking result does not appear in the preceding theoretical literature:  An increase
18:568:46837:14:15:87:531:194:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:12Existing theoretical work on platform competition considers cases with only two conventions, and studies changes in
18:569:46954:15:12:79:531:179:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:competition by varying the distance between them.  Naturally, our empirical specification is designed to handle much more
18:570:47075:12:12:79:531:167:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:varied market structures.  We interpret an increase in the number of competing conventions as the theoretical equivalent
18:571:47195:12:11:79:531:155:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:of moving a platform from a really far distance that has a minimal competitive effect (say more than 300 miles away) to a
18:572:47316:11:8:79:258:144:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:distance that counts for near or far competition.
18:573:47365:8:0:87:286:136:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:13For example, see Equation 12 in Armstrong (2006).
19:574:47418:0:15:79:531:657:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:in competition for consumers leads to lower prices for consumers andhigherprices for dealers.  Intuitively,
19:575:47525:15:15:79:531:642:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:as competition increases for consumers, the number of consumers served decreases for each convention.
19:576:47626:15:15:79:531:627:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Since part of the value of attracting dealers is that it allows the convention to raise price to consumers,
19:577:47733:15:15:79:531:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:dealers become less valuable as the number of consumers goes down.  The decreased marginal benefit of
19:578:47834:15:15:79:531:597:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:attracting a dealer causes the conventions to raise the price to dealers.  This effect was masked in the
19:579:47938:15:15:79:531:582:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:model of Armstrong, which assumed that quantity stayed constant on both sides (via the “fully served”
19:580:48039:15:15:79:531:567:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:assumption).14In our model, the only difference between consumers and dealers is that consumers have
19:581:48139:15:15:79:161:552:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:higher travel costs.
19:582:48159:15:15:94:531:537:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Thus, our basic empirical result that competition causes prices to fall for consumers but to remain
19:583:48258:15:15:79:531:522:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:unchanged or increase for dealers can be rationalized by the theory of two-sided markets.  In fact, we
19:584:48360:15:15:79:531:507:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:can say more.  Competition does not affect dealer prices in a model in which dealers multi-home and
19:585:48459:15:15:79:531:492:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:competition  causes  prices  to  increase  in  a  model  in  which  dealers  single-home.   Thus,  our  empirical
19:586:48572:15:15:79:531:477:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:result that competition between conventions less than 100 miles apart has no effect on dealer price and
19:587:48675:15:14:79:531:462:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:competition greater than 100 miles away causes dealer prices to increase is consistent with a model in
19:588:48777:14:15:79:528:448:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:which dealers multi-home between conventions at lower distances but single-home at greater distances.
19:589:48878:15:15:94:531:433:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We  have  no  direct  data  on  the  extent  to  which  dealers  single-home  or  multi-home.   Presumably,
19:590:48985:15:15:79:531:418:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:there is a mix of each.  It is difficult to say when multi-homing is more prevalent.  Certainly, it seems
19:591:49090:15:15:79:531:403:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:natural to think that dealers would be more likely to split their collection among two conventions when
19:592:49193:15:15:79:531:388:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the  conventions  are  not  very  far  apart.   Furthermore,  our  interviews  with  industry  participants  were
19:593:49306:15:15:79:531:373:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:suggestive of our interpretation.  They confirm that dealers travel further than consumers, and generally
19:594:49411:15:15:79:531:358:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:treat travel as less important.  Furthermore, dealers are capable of splitting their collection.  One example
19:595:49520:15:15:79:531:343:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:where this might come up would be if a dealer regularly appeared at a monthly card show that happened
19:596:49621:15:15:79:531:328:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:to overlap with a very large annual show.  Without further data, which we do not believe is available,
19:597:49723:15:15:79:531:313:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:we cannot further explore this issue, so we simply note that our interpretation of the empirical results is
19:598:49830:15:15:79:341:298:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:consistent with a reasonable description of market behavior.
19:599:49890:15:15:94:531:283:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:To be clear, there are no theoretical models we know of that endogenize the change from single-homing
19:600:49991:15:15:79:531:268:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:to multi-homing – it is always imposed by the model.  However, it is straightforward to think about how
19:601:50094:15:15:79:531:253:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:this might work.  Recall that most dealers are very small businesses.  Multi-homing probably means that
19:602:50197:15:15:79:531:238:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the dealer attends one convention and hires an employee or family member to attend another.  Whereas
19:603:50297:15:15:79:531:223:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the  dealer  may  regard  his  own  travel  costs  as  very  low,  paying  an  employee  for  time  and  car  usage
19:604:50412:15:15:79:531:208:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:may make distant conventions more costly.  Alternatively,  a dealer may hire employees to go to both
19:605:50512:15:14:79:531:193:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:conventions (perhaps for only part of the day) and then the dealer would visit both conventions himself as
19:606:50618:14:15:79:531:179:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:well. In either case, we could imagine increasing the distance between conventions endogenously switching
19:607:50723:15:15:87:531:164:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:14One  can  see  our  result  in  the  model  of  Weyl  (2010),  which  only  models  the  monopoly  case  but  with  more  general
19:608:50854:15:12:79:531:149:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:demand functions than we have here.  Weyl shows that the equilibrium price to one side depends on the number of agents
19:609:50972:12:12:79:531:137:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:on the other side (see equation 4).  If the quantity on the other side goes down, for instance because of competition, so
19:610:51093:12:0:79:133:125:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:does the price.
20:611:51110:0:15:79:531:657:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the dealer’s preferences from a multi-homing model,  where the dealer’s decision at each convention is
20:612:51212:15:15:79:531:642:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:independent of the other, to a single-homing model, where the dealer must choose which one of a set of
20:613:51314:15:15:79:176:627:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:conventions to attend.
20:614:51336:15:15:94:531:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Recall  that  in  Table  8,  we  found  that  price  responded  negatively  to  competition  within  50  miles
20:615:51446:15:15:79:531:597:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:even for conventions that charged for admission.  This result is not consistent with our story in which
20:616:51549:15:15:79:531:582:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:dealers purely multi-home, consumers single-home and agents never substitute between being consumers
20:617:51649:15:15:79:531:567:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:and  dealers,  which  would  predict  no  effect  of  competition  on  dealer  price.   However,  we  do  not  view
20:618:51764:15:15:79:531:552:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:this as particularly troubling.  First, we did obtain the result of no significant effect in Table 7, so this
20:619:51873:15:15:79:531:537:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:problematic result is not entirely robust.  Furthermore, it seems reasonable that at close distance, one-
20:620:51978:15:15:79:531:522:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:sided logic is more powerful than two-sided logic, and leads prices to fall in competition.  Perhaps some
20:621:52083:15:15:79:531:507:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:dealers substitute to enter as consumers, or some consumers multi-home at short distances, which could
20:622:52185:15:15:79:211:492:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:explain this outcome formally.
20:623:52215:15:15:94:531:477:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:An additional empirical result is that competition affects price-constrained platforms differently. Arm-
20:624:52319:15:14:79:531:462:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:strong & Wright (2007) study how a constraint on one side affects pricing on the other.  Writing in terms
20:625:52424:14:15:79:531:448:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of the sports card application, they show that conventions that choose free admission reduce dealer prices
20:626:52530:15:15:79:531:433:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:in response to increases in competition more strongly than do conventions that use positive admission
20:627:52631:15:15:79:531:418:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:fees.  Intuitively, competition induces firms to set lower consumer fees.  When consumer fees reach zero,
20:628:52736:15:15:79:531:403:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:conventions must find another method to attract consumers as competition increases,  and so conven-
20:629:52835:15:15:79:531:388:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:tions turn towards attracting dealers.  Thus, pricing to dealers is more aggressive in competition when
20:630:52938:15:15:79:229:373:10:g_d0_f2:7:g_d0_f3:consumer prices are constrained.15
20:631:52972:15:15:94:531:358:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Gomes (2011) also finds that competition has a bigger effect on seller prices when the platform cannot
20:632:53074:15:15:79:531:343:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:price to consumers, with similar intuition.  His approach is notable because he uses a mechanism design
20:633:53177:15:15:79:396:328:10:g_d0_f2:7:g_d0_f3:approach, and so in this sense considers very general pricing functions.16
20:634:53251:15:15:94:531:313:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A potential issue in the empirical model is that admissions and dealer prices are set simultaneously.
20:635:53352:15:15:79:531:298:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:However, the theoretical relationship between the two prices can be interpreted as an equilibrium corre-
20:636:53456:15:15:79:531:283:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:lation rather than a causal effect.  That is, in Armstrong & Wright (2007), competition is the exogenous
20:637:53560:15:15:79:531:268:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:variable.  As competition increases, consumer prices drop until they hit their boundary, at which point
20:638:53663:15:15:79:531:253:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:dealer prices fall.  Thus, our regressions are consistent with the theory in this sense.  There may still be
20:639:53771:15:14:87:531:238:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:15Armstrong & Wright (2007) make this point in the context of their model in which agents are fully served by conventions.
20:640:53893:14:12:79:531:224:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:We have confirmed these predictions in our model which allows for a market expansion effect. Also, they generate asymmetry
20:641:54015:12:12:79:531:212:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:by allowing the “network effect” parameters (what we labelαin the appendix) to differ across consumers and dealers.  We
20:642:54134:12:12:79:531:200:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:have confirmed these results allowing for heterogeneity in the other parameters, such as the travel cost (t) and stand-alone
20:643:54258:12:7:79:531:188:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:utility (v).  We also have checked these results when dealers single-home and multi-home.  Results are available on request.
20:644:54382:7:15:87:531:181:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:16Gomes (2011) is motivated by Internet search auctions but the model is still relevant for our context.  In considering
20:645:54502:15:12:79:531:166:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:implementation, Gomes focuses on a platform that auctions access to users.  In his model, the platform sets the weight it
20:646:54623:12:11:79:531:154:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:will put on the seller’s bid relative to the quality the seller will provide to the consumers.  While Gomes does not study
20:647:54745:11:12:79:531:143:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:price explicitly, raising the weight on the bid causes sellers to bid more aggressively, which is analogous to raising price in
20:648:54872:12:12:79:531:131:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:our setting.  He finds that the auction is not affected by competition between platforms when the platform can subsidize
20:649:54992:12:0:79:491:119:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:consumers, but that the weight on the bid goes down in competition when pricing to consumers is constrained.
21:650:55102:0:15:79:531:657:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:more standard empirical problems to worry about.  For instance, unobserved location heterogeneity could
21:651:55205:15:15:79:531:642:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:lead to low consumer and dealer prices and high competition, which would generate our empirical result.
21:652:55308:15:15:79:531:627:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We find this possibility unlikely – standard intuition suggests that unobserved heterogeneity generates a
21:653:55413:15:15:79:336:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:positive correlation between prices and entry, not negative.
21:654:55473:15:15:94:531:597:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Overall,  theory  provides  a  consistent  interpretation  of  our  regression  results.   Dealers  multi-home
21:655:55583:15:15:79:531:582:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:and so competition between conventions has no effect on dealer prices over some middle range.  When
21:656:55682:15:15:79:531:567:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:conventions are very close, admission fees are driven to zero and then conventions compete by lowering
21:657:55784:15:15:79:531:552:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:dealer fees.  When conventions are far from each other, dealers switch to single-homing, in which case
21:658:55886:15:15:79:531:537:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:dealer prices increase in competition, since competition for consumers is more intense than competition
21:659:55989:15:15:79:127:522:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:for dealers.
21:660:56001:15:15:94:531:507:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Clearly, we have not established that the theory of two-sided markets is theonlytheory that could
21:661:56098:15:15:79:531:492:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:generate these results, but we believe that it is difficult to find an alternative, particularly for the result
21:662:56209:15:15:79:531:477:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:about increased prices.  There are a variety of ways that someone might model this market but without
21:663:56310:15:14:79:531:462:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:specifying  an  explicit  model,  it  is  surely  true  that  most  multi-product  oligopoly  models  predict  that
21:664:56425:14:15:79:531:448:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:prices fall in competition, rather than increase.  Our empirics do not provide a test of two-sided market
21:665:56530:15:15:79:531:433:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:theories in the sense of developing falsifiable predictions from the theory of two-sided markets.  Rather,
21:666:56636:15:15:79:531:418:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:our goal is to provide a set of stylized facts from the industry and argue that they can be rationalized
21:667:56740:15:15:79:164:403:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:with these theories.
21:668:56760:15:15:94:531:388:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:A theory that generates prices that increase in competition exists for prescription drugs,  in which
21:669:56860:15:15:79:531:373:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:we  have  seen  brand-name  drugs  raise  prices  after  entry  by  a  generic  drug  (for  instance,  see  Ching,
21:670:56974:15:15:79:531:358:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:2010).   These  models  rely  on  the  entrant  successfully  capturing  the  high  elasticity  customers,  leaving
21:671:57089:15:15:79:531:343:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the incumbent to exploit the remaining low elasticity customers, where elasticity is driven by the type
21:672:57192:15:15:79:531:328:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of insurance that a consumer has.  That kind of differentiation between platforms and heterogeneity in
21:673:57294:15:37:79:388:313:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:elasticity seems unlikely to be relevant for the card convention market.
21:674:57366:37:25:79:180:276:14:g_d0_f1:14:g_d0_f1:5  Conclusion
21:675:57379:25:15:79:531:251:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We provide a set of empirical results drawn from a new data set on sports card conventions in the U.S. in
21:676:57484:15:15:79:531:236:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the mid-1990s.  These conventions are a two-sided market since convention organizers must set admission
21:677:57587:15:15:79:531:221:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:and table fees to attract consumers and dealers.  This setting is compelling for the study of two-sided
21:678:57690:15:15:79:531:206:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:markets because we observe many,  many conventions and thus variation in market structure,  and the
21:679:57789:15:15:79:291:191:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:pricing setting is simple and easily interpretable.
21:680:57840:15:15:94:531:176:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We show that consumer prices respond to the number of conventions both nearby and far.  In contrast,
21:681:57940:15:15:79:531:161:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:dealer prices at conventions within 100 miles do not respond to competition between conventions, except
21:682:58043:15:15:79:531:146:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:for a negative effect for conventions that do not charge admission.  Also, competition that is more than
21:683:58147:15:0:79:531:131:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:100 miles away (when dealer single-homing is likely) causes prices to increase.  We argue that this set of
22:684:58255:0:15:79:531:657:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:results is consistent with the existing theories of two-sided markets. Thus, we find that empirical evidence
22:685:58363:15:15:79:531:642:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:from the sports cards market supports the recent theoretical literature on two-sided markets.  Existing
22:686:58466:15:15:79:531:627:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:theoretical  work  considers  no  more  than  two  competing  conventions,  whereas  our  empirical  setting  is
22:687:58578:15:15:79:531:612:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:much more varied.  Therefore, our results suggest that intuition obtained in a duopoly market structure
22:688:58681:15:0:79:326:597:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:can be extended to more complicated market structures.

25:744:63161:22:12:79:531:635:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Competition among sports card conventions can be summarized as the number of competitors that a
25:745:63256:12:12:79:531:623:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:convention faces in the same time frame within a specific distance.  However solving a theoretical model
25:746:63360:12:12:79:531:611:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:that allows for variation in both the number of platforms and distance between platforms is a challenge.
25:747:63464:12:12:79:531:599:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Like the existing theoretical literature on two-sided markets, we restrict our model to have two platforms
25:748:63570:12:12:79:531:587:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:and and we use the distance between platforms to proxy for the level competition.  In Section 4 ,  we
25:749:63671:12:12:79:531:575:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:explain  how  we  interpret  predictions  from  this  model  in  the  context  of  sports  card  conventions.   See
25:750:63786:12:12:79:163:563:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:footnote 12 as well.
25:751:63806:12:12:94:531:551:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We base our work closely on the model of Armstrong (2006).  This model is useful for representing the
25:752:63907:12:12:79:531:539:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:sports card convention market because it address competition between two platforms that charge only a
25:753:64008:12:12:79:531:527:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:fixed fee to each agent and do not charge based on the number of trades made through the platform.  We
25:754:64110:12:12:79:531:515:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:extend this model to allow for a market expansion effect from lowering prices.  While doing so complicates
25:755:64216:12:12:79:360:503:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the model, it also provides more realistic results to take to data.
25:756:64283:12:12:94:531:491:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Consider two sides of a market, with one set of agents on each side.  SideCis made up of consumers

25:765:65195:12:12:79:531:384:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:change in geographic location would affect all types of agents, but we think of this is an approximation

25:769:65602:12:12:79:531:335:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:find the same qualitative results, although the equations are much more complicated and we must resort
25:770:65704:12:12:79:531:323:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:to numerical analysis to a greater degree.  For this reason, we only present the model that assumes equal
25:771:65809:12:12:79:449:311:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:travel cost but allows platforms to change locations on the two sides asymmetrically.

25:778:66344:11:12:79:531:201:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:parameterizes the travel cost.  We assume that agents could instead use some outside good with utility
25:779:66446:12:12:79:275:189:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of zero.  Figure 3 displays our model visually.
25:780:66493:12:12:94:531:177:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Note  that  we  are  treating  dealers  symmetrically  with  consumers.   We  do  not  model  price-setting,
25:781:66601:12:12:79:531:165:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:competition or other externalities between dealers.  Doing so would complicate our analysis unnecessarily.
25:782:66707:12:16:79:531:153:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Wright  (2010)  presents  a  model  with  within-group  competition  that  turns  out  to  be  just  a  change  of
25:783:66821:16:12:87:531:137:6:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:17The  important  assumption  is  not  that  agents  extend  forever  across  each  line  but  that  they  extend  past  whatever
25:784:66950:12:0:79:471:125:8:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f5:location would generate sales for zero prices, so there is always a demand expansion effect to lower prices.

26:803:67279:32:12:79:531:469:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:variables from the model we consider.  Also, we assume there is agent heterogeneity inlibut notα.  Weyl
26:804:67382:12:12:79:531:457:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:(2010) explores a model with heterogeneity in both terms but we have not done so as we believe that
26:805:67481:12:12:79:393:445:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:geographic heterogeneity is the most important issue in our application.
26:806:67553:12:20:94:520:433:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Throughout, we parameterize the model as follows, which we regard as without loss of generality:
26:807:67649:20:20:79:364:413:10:g_d0_f30:10:g_d0_f23:Assumption 1lC1=−1lD1=−1lD2= 1t= 1.
26:808:67684:20:12:79:530:393:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We want to consider comparative statics of prices inlC2.  An alternative would be to allowtto be hetero-
26:809:67788:12:12:79:531:381:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:geneous across markets and consider comparative statics in consumert.  However, note that reductions
26:810:67888:12:12:79:531:369:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:intbring conventions closer togetherandincrease the responsiveness to the number of agents on the
26:811:67985:12:12:79:474:357:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:other side, like increasingα.  We wish to isolate the competitive effect, and so focus onlC2.
26:812:68078:12:12:94:531:345:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We assume that the two platforms choose prices simultaneously and we solve for a Nash equilibrium
26:813:68175:12:11:79:531:333:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of the game.  Platforms are symmetric and we find only symmetric equilibria.  Hence, we always find that
26:814:68279:11:12:79:197:322:10:g_d0_f23:10:g_d0_f2:Pm1=Pm2form={C,D}.
26:815:68297:12:12:94:531:310:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We  consider  the  case  in  which  consumers  and  dealers  both  single-home.   That  is,  agents  pick  the
26:816:68407:12:12:79:531:298:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:single platform that gives the highest utility,  or choose no platform if the value of purchase does not
26:817:68511:12:12:79:243:286:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:exceed their reservation value of zero.
26:818:68550:12:12:94:531:274:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:We are interested in cases in which there is a strategic interaction between the two platforms, so we
26:819:68651:12:12:79:531:262:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:consider cases in which all consumers located between the two platforms prefer purchasing from either
26:820:68752:12:12:79:531:250:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:platform to no purchase.  Armstrong (2006) obtains simple analytic solutions to a similar model in which
26:821:68856:12:12:79:531:238:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:agents are assumed to be on finite lines and platforms are at the ends of these lines.  However, the lack
26:822:68961:12:12:79:531:226:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:of  a  demand  expansion  effect  leads  to  some  unrealistic  implications.   The  principal  innovation  of  our
26:823:69076:12:12:79:531:214:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:model is to incorporate a demand expansion effect by allowing agents to be located on both sides of the
26:824:69179:12:12:79:489:202:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:platforms.  While our solutions are less elegant, they are more relevant for our empirical work.
26:825:69275:12:12:94:531:190:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:For each platform, profit isπj=pCjnCj+pDjnDj.  Demand for each platform on each side of the market

27:844:69637:0:12:79:531:657:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:zero in a symmetric equilibrium and the second term increases as the platforms become farther apart.
27:845:69737:12:12:79:468:645:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:The last term captures the profits drawn from agents on the other sides of the platforms.

27:854:70147:12:12:79:531:552:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:effect is not too large.19That is, higher competition on one side increases prices in the other.  We consider
27:855:70256:12:12:79:531:540:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:the finding that prices increase in competition to be very surprising.  It would be difficult to replicate in
27:856:70365:12:12:79:264:528:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:a model with only single-sided interaction.
27:857:70408:12:12:94:531:516:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:The condition that the network effect be not too large turns out to be non-binding.  As is well-known
27:858:70509:12:12:79:531:504:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:in the network effects literature, large network effects lead to intense price competition.  There exists a
27:859:70616:12:12:79:531:492:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:critical value ofαsuch that prices become zero.  It takes on a particularly simple form in our model:
27:860:70717:12:12:79:531:480:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:whenlC2= 1, prices are greater than zero ifα <1/2.  Obviously, this lies below 5/8.  Hence, we would
27:861:70817:12:12:79:298:468:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:never consider values ofαsuch thatdpD1/dlC2>0.
27:862:70863:12:12:94:531:456:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:To get a sense of the whole set of prices, consider the specification withv= 1 andα= 0.3.  These
27:863:70959:12:12:79:531:444:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:parameters  imply that  forlC2=  1,  all consumers and  dealers between the  platforms purchase.   Then,
27:864:71063:12:22:79:123:432:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:prices are:
27:865:71074:22:15:212:395:410:10:g_d0_f23:7:g_d0_f3:pC1= 0.27 + 0.19lC2pD1= 0.49−0.03lC2
27:866:71110:15:22:212:395:395:10:g_d0_f23:7:g_d0_f3:pC2= 0.27 + 0.19lC2pD2= 0.49−0.03lC2
27:867:71146:22:11:79:531:373:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:Not surprisingly, platform 1 increases its price to consumers as platform 2 becomes farther away on that
27:868:71250:11:12:79:531:362:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f6:side.  However, we also see that platform 1decreasesits price to dealers as platform 2 becomesfarther
27:869:71351:12:12:79:199:350:10:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f2:awayon the consumer side.
27:870:71376:12:12:94:531:338:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:What is the intuition for this surprising result?  As platforms become closer together, they serve fewer
27:871:71480:12:12:79:531:326:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:consumers.  Thus dealers, who are attractive in part because they allow the platform to raise price on
27:872:71582:12:12:79:531:314:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:consumers, are less attractive.  Hence, platforms raise price to dealers.  Note that this result is unique
27:873:71688:12:12:79:531:302:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:to our setting because we have a demand expansion effect.  Armstrong (2006) finds that changing the
27:874:71787:12:12:79:531:290:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:distance between platforms on one side does not affect prices on the other.  This follows from Armstrong’s
27:875:71893:12:12:79:271:278:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:assumption that consumers are fully served.
27:876:71936:12:12:94:531:266:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:As noted in footnote 15, we have also solved versions of our model when assuming that dealers can
27:877:72033:12:12:79:531:254:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:multi-home, and whenv,αortdiffer for consumers and dealers, inducing platforms to set a price of zero
27:878:72134:12:12:79:531:242:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f2:to one side.  As these results are consistent with existing theory, we do not present them here, although
