2:31:1612:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:?:Using  a  unique  new  survey,  we  study  the  relationship  between  search  effort  and  outcomes  for 
2:32:1718:14:14:72:543:574:12:Times:12:Times:?:employed and  non-employed  workers.  We  find  that  the  employed  fare  better  than  the  non-
2:33:1815:14:14:71:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:?:employed in job search: they receive more offers per application and are offered higher pay even 
2:34:1911:14:14:71:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:?:after   controlling   for   observable characteristics.   We   use   an   on-the-job   search   model   with 
2:35:2019:14:14:71:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:?:endogenous search effort and find that unobserved heterogeneity explains less than a third of the 
2:36:2116:14:14:72:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:?:residual  wage  offer  differential.  The  model  calibrated using  various  moments  from  our  survey 
2:37:2219:14:42:72:481:504:12:Times:12:Times:?:provides a good fit to the data and implies a reasonable flow value of unemployment.

3:64:2828:36:25:81:529:673:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Job-to-job transitions are an important feature of the U.S. labor market. Fallick and Fleischman
3:65:2924:25:25:81:529:648:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(2004)  show  that,  at  the  end  of  the  1990s,  the  monthly  job-to-job  transition  rate  was  2.6
3:66:3028:25:25:81:530:623:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:percent, which accounted for around 40 percent of all monthly hiring.1Furthermore, job-to-
3:67:3118:25:25:81:529:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:job transitions are an important driver of aggregate wage and productivity growth (Faberman
3:68:3209:25:25:81:458:573:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and Justiniano, 2015; Moscarini and Postel-Vinay, 2017; Karahan et al., 2017).
3:69:3287:25:25:98:529:548:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Despite  the  critical  importance  of  on-the-job  search  for  understanding  labor  market  dy-
3:70:3385:25:25:81:529:523:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:namics  and  the  central  role  it  takes  in  search  theories  of  the  labor  market,  evidence  on  the
3:71:3493:25:24:81:530:498:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:extent and nature of the on-the-job search remains scant.2In this paper, we help fill this void
3:72:3588:24:25:81:529:474:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:by documenting the search behavior and outcomes of employed and non-employed individuals
3:73:3676:25:25:81:524:449:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and assessing the importance of our findings for search-theoretic models of the labor market.
3:74:3769:25:25:98:529:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:To  this  end,  we  design  and  implement  a  unique  new  survey  that  focuses  on  job  search
3:75:3867:25:25:81:530:399:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:behavior and outcomes forallindividuals, regardless of their labor force status.  Our survey
3:76:3959:25:25:81:529:374:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is  administered  as  a  supplement  to  the  Survey  of  Consumer  Expectations,  which  is  fielded
3:77:4060:25:25:81:529:349:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:monthly by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to a sample of roughly 1,300 individuals.
3:78:4149:25:25:81:529:324:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Our supplement has been fielded annually each October since 2013.  It asks an expansive list of
3:79:4244:25:25:81:529:299:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:questions on the employment status and current job search, if any, of all respondents.  We ask
3:80:4338:25:25:81:529:274:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:about an individual’s search effort and search methods, including whether any unsolicited con-
3:81:4432:25:24:81:529:249:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tacts, referrals, or other informal methods were involved.  We also elicit extensive information
3:82:4528:24:25:81:529:225:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on worker and job characteristics.  For search outcomes, we ask about any job offers received,
3:83:4622:25:16:81:529:200:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:how those offers came about, the characteristics of those offers, and whether these offers were
3:84:4717:16:16:94:530:184:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:1More  recently,  the  job-to-job  transition  rate  has  declined  (Davis  and  Haltiwanger,  2014),  but  so  has  the
3:85:4837:16:12:81:529:168:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:transition rate from unemployment to employment,  so job-to-job transitions remain an important fraction of
3:86:4944:12:8:81:251:156:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:aggregate hiring in the U.S. labor market.
3:87:4986:8:16:94:530:148:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:2Notable  exceptions  are  earlier  work  by  Blau  and  Robins  (1990)  and  Holzer  (1987).   As  we  detail  in  the
3:88:5105:16:12:81:529:132:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:empirical section, these studies are based on older, discontinued surveys.  Researchers have used the more recent
3:89:5218:12:12:81:529:120:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:American  Time  Use  Survey  (ATUS)  extensively  to  analyze  the  job  search  behavior  of  the  unemployed  (see
3:90:5334:12:12:81:529:108:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:Krueger and Mueller,  2010,  Aguiar,  Hurst,  and Karabourbanis,  2013,  and Mukoyama,  Patterson,  and S ̧ahin,
3:91:5446:12:12:81:529:96:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:2017),  but the ATUS is not well-suited to analyze the job search effort of the employed as we discuss in the
3:92:5555:12:0:81:151:84:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:empirical section.
4:93:5574:0:25:81:529:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:accepted.  We also ask those who are currently employed similar questions about the search
4:94:5664:25:25:81:255:684:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:process that led to their current job.
4:95:5702:25:25:98:529:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Our findings provide the most comprehensive evidence to date on the nature of on-the-job
4:96:5790:25:25:81:529:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:search for the U.S. On-the-job search is pervasive, with 23 percent of the employed looking for
4:97:5885:25:25:81:529:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:work during our survey months.  The overarching theme from our analysis is that the employed
4:98:5977:25:25:81:529:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:face relatively better job search prospects along multiple dimensions.  With regard to theories
4:99:6072:25:25:81:529:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of labor market search, two margins in particular stand out.  First, the search process of the
4:100:6166:25:25:81:529:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employed appears to be more efficient than that of the unemployed.  The unemployed exert
4:101:6254:25:25:81:529:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:nearly twice as much search effort as employed job seekers but generate fewer employer contacts
4:102:6349:25:25:81:529:484:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and about the same number of job offers compared to the employed.  In addition, employed
4:103:6437:25:24:81:529:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:workers who report no measurable search activity receive over one-quarter of all offers in our
4:104:6531:24:25:81:529:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sample, underscoring the importance of informal recruiting mechanisms for generating differ-
4:105:6623:25:25:81:529:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ences in search efficiency by labor force status.3Second, the employed appear to sample from
4:106:6715:25:25:81:529:385:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a higher-quality job offer distribution than the non-employed.  This holds even after control-
4:107:6809:25:25:81:529:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ling for observable characteristics of the worker and the job.  When the non-employed receive
4:108:6902:25:25:81:529:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a job offer, we find that it tends to pay a lower wage, offer fewer hours, and is considerably
4:109:6996:25:25:81:529:310:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:less likely to offer any benefits.  Unconditionally,  the wages offered to the non-employed are
4:110:7091:25:25:81:529:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:40 log points (49 percent) lower than the wages offered to the employed.  After accounting for
4:111:7185:25:25:81:529:260:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:observable characteristics, the average wage offered to the non-employed remains 25 log points
4:112:7279:25:25:81:529:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(28 percent) lower.  Despite the poor quality of these job offers, the non-employed are about
4:113:7372:25:25:81:313:210:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:one-and-a-half times more likely to accept them.
4:114:7420:25:24:98:529:185:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The finding that employed workers face better wage offers suggests that factors that are
4:115:7508:24:25:81:529:161:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:unique to employment status are important determinants of the hiring process.  An obvious
4:116:7597:25:16:81:529:136:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:concern about this interpretation, however, is that unobserved differences in productivity be-
4:117:7691:16:16:94:530:120:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:3This finding has strong implications for labor market models that incorporate on-the-job search and analo-
4:118:7798:16:12:81:529:104:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:gous to recent work on vacancies by Davis, Faberman, and Haltiwanger (2013), who find that a sizable fraction
4:119:7907:12:0:81:329:92:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:of hiring by firms occurs without the use of a formal vacancy.
5:120:7970:0:25:81:530:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f6:B:tween employed and non-employed job seekers may be the reason for what appears to be awage
5:121:8060:25:25:81:530:684:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f4:B:offer premium.  To assess the role of heterogeneity in our data more systematically, we set up an
5:122:8157:25:25:81:530:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on-the-job search model with unobservedex anteheterogeneity in worker productivity.  We dis-
5:123:8249:25:25:81:529:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:cipline the differences in unobserved productivity in our model with data on individuals’ wages
5:124:8344:25:25:81:529:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for the job held prior to their current job.  The model simulation suggests that low-productivity
5:125:8441:25:25:81:530:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:workers are negatively selected into unemployment.4Nevertheless, the negative selection only
5:126:8533:25:25:81:529:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:accounts for 28 percent (7 log points) of the 25 log point residual wage offer differential.  We
5:127:8629:25:25:81:529:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:also provide evidence that controlling for the fraction of time employed over the last 5 years
5:128:8723:25:25:81:529:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(in addition to the standard observables) reduces the unexplained wage offer premium only to
5:129:8815:25:25:81:529:484:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a limited extent, but in similar magnitude in the data and the model.  This suggests that our
5:130:8908:25:24:81:529:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:model—which, for the purpose of identification, exploits prior wages rather than employment
5:131:8999:24:25:81:529:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:histories as a source of variation—captures the unobserved heterogeneity that is relevant for
5:132:9092:25:25:81:298:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the empirically-observed wage offer premium.
5:133:9136:25:25:98:529:385:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The model also allows us to relate our findings to the quantitative implications of search
5:134:9226:25:25:81:529:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:theory.  We base our framework on the model of Christensen et al.  (2005), and—in addition
5:135:9316:25:25:81:529:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to incorporating worker heterogeneity—extend it along several dimensions.  First, we allow for
5:136:9410:25:25:81:529:310:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:differences in search costs and search efficiency by employment status.  Search efficiency in the
5:137:9507:25:25:81:529:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:model captures differences in the job-offer arrival rate (per unit of search effort) between the
5:138:9603:25:25:81:529:260:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employed  and  unemployed  that  we  observe  in  our  survey.   In  practice,  these  differences  can
5:139:9706:25:25:81:529:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:occur for a variety of reasons, including employer preferences and differences in the incidence
5:140:9801:25:25:81:529:210:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of unsolicited employer contacts and referrals.  When fed into the model, our findings on search
5:141:9897:25:24:81:529:185:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:effort  and  search  outcomes  suggest  that  the  employed  are  nearly  three  times  more  efficient
5:142:10000:24:25:81:529:161:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in their job search than the unemployed.  Second, we allow for wage offers to be censored to
5:143:10092:25:16:81:529:136:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:account for the possibility that employed job seekers are more selective in the pre-offer stage of
5:144:10190:16:16:94:530:120:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:4Our model estimates are consistent with Mueller (2017) who finds in the Current Population Survey that
5:145:10293:16:12:81:529:104:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:unemployment risk is 36 percent higher for workers below the median residual wage (i.e., after controlling for
5:146:10403:12:0:81:341:92:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:observables) compared to those above the median residual wage.
6:147:10466:0:25:81:530:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f6:B:the search process.  We calibrate the degree of censoring using specific questions onunrealized
6:148:10561:25:25:81:530:684:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f4:B:offersin our survey.  To the extent that the employed are more selective and reject or avoid
6:149:10653:25:25:81:529:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:offers before they are formally made, this magnifies their underlying search efficiency.  Finally,
6:150:10751:25:25:81:529:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we extend our model to allow for differences in the wage offer distributions of the employed
6:151:10843:25:25:81:471:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and unemployed that are independent of censoring and unobserved heterogeneity.
6:152:10921:25:25:98:529:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:All three model extensions improve the fit to our data.  The full version of our model also
6:153:11012:25:25:81:529:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:implies a reasonable flow value of unemployment of 0.74, passing a key test advocated by Horn-
6:154:11106:25:25:81:529:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:stein, Krusell, and Violante (2011).  These authors show that standard search models (such as
6:155:11199:25:25:81:529:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in McCall, 1970, Mortensen, 1977, Pissarides, 1985) exhibit a tension between observed worker
6:156:11292:25:25:81:530:484:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f6:B:flows, wage dispersion and the flow value of unemployment (also known as thefrictional wage
6:157:11383:25:24:81:530:459:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f4:B:dispersionpuzzle).  The tension arises because high dispersion in potential wage offers generates
6:158:11480:24:25:81:529:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a large option value of waiting for a better offer, so only a low (often negative) flow value of
6:159:11576:25:25:81:529:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:unemployment can rationalize the observed flow rate of the unemployed into employment.  In
6:160:11666:25:25:81:529:385:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:our model, the option value of unemployment is limited since employed searchers are relatively
6:161:11760:25:25:81:529:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:efficient in generating offers and face a better wage offer distribution.  Therefore, leaving un-
6:162:11857:25:25:81:529:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employment for a job does not require unemployment to have a low flow value.  Our empirical
6:163:11948:25:25:81:529:310:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:findings  thus  constitute  an  important  piece  in  the  solution  of  the  frictional  wage  dispersion
6:164:12054:25:25:81:114:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:puzzle.
6:165:12061:25:25:98:529:260:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:An open question remains for why wage offers are of better quality for the employed.  While
6:166:12152:25:25:81:529:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we  do  not  model  the  many  potential  micro-foundations  for  the  wage  offer  differential,  but
6:167:12254:25:25:81:529:210:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:simply calibrate an exogenous differential to match the empirically observed one, the reduced
6:168:12347:25:24:81:529:185:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:form is consistent with auction models where incumbent and outside employers compete for
6:169:12435:24:25:81:529:161:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:workers  and  bid  up  the  wages  of  the  employed  (Postel-Vinay  and  Robin,  2002,  and  Cahuc,
6:170:12535:25:25:81:529:136:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Postel-Vinay and Robin, 2006).  It is also consistent with employer discrimination against the
6:171:12629:25:25:81:529:111:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:unemployed, either to take advantage of their lower reservation wages (as in Carrillo-Tudela,
6:172:12722:25:0:81:529:86:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:2009)  or  through  a  stigma  effect  (as  in  Gibbons  and  Katz,  1991).   Finally,  the  wage  offer
7:173:12827:0:25:81:529:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:differential may be the result of the employed having access to networks that provide better
7:174:12919:25:25:81:128:684:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:job offers.
7:175:12930:25:25:98:529:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The next section describes our survey.  Section 3 presents our evidence on job search be-

7:177:13114:25:25:81:529:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:search  with endogenous  search  effort and  its calibration  to our  key  findings.  Section 5  con-
7:178:13215:25:25:81:529:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:cludes and offers some additional thoughts on the mechanisms underlying the observed wage
7:179:13304:25:36:81:414:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:offer differential between the employed and non-employed job seekers.

7:181:13400:36:25:81:529:487:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Our data come from a supplement to the Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE), administered
7:182:13490:25:25:81:529:462:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The SCE is a monthly nationally-representative
7:183:13578:25:25:81:529:437:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:survey of roughly 1,300 individuals that asks respondents about their expectations about vari-
7:184:13672:25:24:81:529:412:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ous aspects of the economy.  We designed the supplement ourselves and first administered it in
7:185:13766:24:25:81:529:388:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:October 2013.  We have administered it annually since then, and present results for a sample
7:186:13858:25:25:81:529:363:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that  pools  the  2013-15  data  together.   Our  supplement  asks  a  broad  range  of  questions  on
7:187:13960:25:25:81:529:338:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employment status, job search behavior, and job search outcomes.  Demographic data are also
7:188:14051:25:25:81:433:313:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:available for respondents through the monthly portion of the SCE survey.
7:189:14123:25:25:98:529:288:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The  survey  asks  a  variety  of  questions  that  are  tailored  to  an  individual’s  employment
7:190:14222:25:25:81:529:263:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:status and job search behavior.  For the employed, including the self-employed, the survey asks
7:191:14317:25:25:81:529:238:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:questions  about  their  wages,  hours,  benefits,  and  the  type  of  work  that  they  do,  including
7:192:14421:25:25:81:529:213:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:questions on the characteristics of their workplace.  For the non-employed, the survey asks a
7:193:14514:25:25:81:529:188:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:range of detailed questions on their most recent employment spell and their reasons for non-
7:194:14606:25:24:81:529:163:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employment.  The survey also asks questions related to the type of non-employment, including
7:195:14698:24:25:81:529:139:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:those  related  to  retirement,  school  enrollment  status,  and  any  temporary  layoff.   We  also
7:196:14799:25:25:81:529:114:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ask individuals about their prior work history.  This includes detailed information about the
7:197:14892:25:0:81:274:89:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:preceding job of the currently employed.
8:198:14933:0:25:98:529:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Regardless of employment status, the survey asks all individuals if they have searched for
8:199:15023:25:25:81:529:684:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:work within the last four weeks, and if they had not searched, whether or not they would accept
8:200:15118:25:25:81:529:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a job if one was offered to them.  Among the employed, the survey distinguishes between those
8:201:15211:25:25:81:529:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:searching  for  new  work  and  those  searching  for  a  job  in  addition  to  their  current  one.   For
8:202:15318:25:25:81:529:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:individuals who have searched or would at least be willing to accept a new job if offered, the
8:203:15412:25:25:81:529:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:survey asks a series of questions relating to their job search (if any), including the reasons for
8:204:15510:25:25:81:529:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:their decision to (not) search.  It then asks an exhaustive set of questions on the types of effort
8:205:15609:25:25:81:529:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:exerted when seeking new work (e.g., updating resumes, searching online, contacting employers
8:206:15702:25:25:81:529:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:directly). It also asks about the number of job applications completed within the last four weeks
8:207:15799:25:25:81:529:484:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and the number of employer contacts and job offers received.  It also probes further to see how
8:208:15894:25:24:81:529:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:those contacts and offers came about, i.e., whether they were the result of traditional search
8:209:15988:24:25:81:529:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:methods or whether they came about through a referral or an unsolicited employer contact.
8:210:16077:25:25:81:529:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:For those who received an offer, including any offers within the last six months, the survey asks
8:211:16174:25:25:81:529:385:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:about a range of characteristics of the job offer, including the wage offered, the expected hours,
8:212:16272:25:25:81:529:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:its benefits, as well as the type of work to be done and the characteristics of the employer.  It
8:213:16369:25:25:81:529:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:also asks what led, or may lead, the respondent to accept or reject the offer, and asks a range of
8:214:16467:25:25:81:529:310:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:questions about whether there was any bargaining with either the current or future employer.
8:215:16559:25:25:81:529:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Since only a fraction of respondents in our sample report a job offer in the months leading up
8:216:16653:25:25:81:529:260:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to the survey,  we ask those who are currently employed a range of additional,  retrospective
8:217:16746:25:25:81:386:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:questions about the search process that led to their current job.
8:218:16811:25:25:98:529:210:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Many  of  the  survey  questions  follow  a  format  similar  to  the  Current  Population  Survey
8:219:16909:25:24:81:529:185:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(CPS),  though  there  are  notable  differences.   The  survey  identifies  the  labor  force  status  of
8:220:17015:24:25:81:529:161:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:respondents at several different points in their employment history:  at the time of the survey,
8:221:17111:25:25:81:529:136:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:at the time of their hiring (if currently employed), and at the time of their job offer (if they
8:222:17207:25:25:81:529:111:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:received an offer within the last six months).  We also impute a labor force status for individuals
8:223:17306:25:0:81:529:86:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:four weeks prior to the survey.  Our ability to identify labor force status at these different points
9:224:17408:0:25:81:529:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:allows us to deal with time aggregation and related issues when comparing the search and job-
9:225:17501:25:25:81:331:684:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:finding behavior of the employed and non-employed.
9:226:17551:25:25:98:529:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We define a respondent’s labor force status at the time of the survey in a manner similar
9:227:17640:25:25:81:529:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to  the  CPS,  but  because  we  ask  about  search  effort  more  broadly  than  the  CPS,  we  can
9:228:17740:25:25:81:529:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:generate  two  measures  of  unemployment.   The  Bureau  of  Labor  Statistics  (BLS)  definition
9:229:17838:25:25:81:529:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:classifies someone as unemployed if they “do not have a job, have actively looked for work in

9:231:18036:25:25:81:529:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:also  included  regardless  of  search  effort  or  availability.   We  employ  the  same  definition,  but
9:232:18143:25:25:81:529:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:due to the skip logic of the CPS survey design, there are some non-employed in the CPS who
9:233:18233:25:25:81:529:484:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are never asked whether they searched for work.  These are primarily retired individuals who
9:234:18325:25:24:81:529:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:state that they do not want a job (and are therefore assumed to be unavailable for work).  Our
9:235:18419:24:25:81:529:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:survey, however, captures search effort regardless of whether a non-employed individual states
9:236:18513:25:25:81:529:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that they want work.  We define a respondent’s labor force status at the time of the survey
9:237:18604:25:25:81:529:385:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:using  the  broader  “job  search”  definition  of  unemployment  since  we  aim  to  capture  overall
9:238:18706:25:25:81:529:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:search activity and its effectiveness within the aggregate economy.  The difference is that the
9:239:18801:25:25:81:529:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:“job search” definition includes non-employed individuals who did not state that they want to
9:240:18894:25:25:81:529:310:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:work but actively searched and are available, while the stricter “BLS definition” includes only
9:241:18989:25:25:81:529:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:those who additionally state that they want work.  Given the well-known observation that even
9:242:19082:25:25:81:529:260:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:workers who state that they are not available for work and they have not searched for work
9:243:19172:25:25:81:529:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:transition from nonparticipation to employment in the CPS, we view our broader “job search”
9:244:19263:25:25:81:315:210:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:definition of unemployment as a reasonable one.5
9:245:19311:25:24:98:529:185:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We identify individuals as either employed or non-employed at the time of their hiring or
9:246:19400:24:25:81:529:161:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:receipt of a job offer.  The survey allows for some greater disaggregation of these labor force sta-
9:247:19500:25:16:81:529:136:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tuses and we obtain results similar to those in our main analyses when using the more detailed
9:248:19594:16:16:94:530:120:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:5While our baseline is the job search definition of unemployment, in Appendix A, we replicate our estimates
9:249:19701:16:12:81:529:104:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:on search effort and outcomes using the definition consistent with the CPS survey design.  The results in the
9:250:19810:12:12:81:529:92:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:appendix show that those included in the broader “job search” definition represent about 12 percent of those
9:251:19918:12:0:81:318:80:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:considered out of the labor force under the BLS definition.

10:278:20691:12:12:81:521:301:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:Survey (CPS) for data pooled across October 2013, 2014, and 2015.  Both samples are for heads of household
10:279:20797:12:12:81:527:289:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:ages 18 to 64.  Job search definition of unemployment includes all non-employed who actively searched and are
10:280:20906:12:33:81:498:277:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:available for work, regardless of reporting whether they want work.  Standard errors are in parentheses.
10:281:21010:33:25:81:530:244:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:definitions.6We also impute a labor force status four weeks prior to the survey for individuals
10:282:21105:25:25:81:529:219:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:using a range of their responses on employment status, job tenure, non-employment duration,

10:284:21298:25:16:81:529:169:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Having a labor force status for individuals one month prior to the survey is useful for when
10:285:21390:16:16:94:530:153:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:6Specifically, the labor force status at the time of hiring distinguishes between those who quit from a previous
10:286:21502:16:12:81:529:137:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:job and those who lost their job immediately prior to starting the current job.  The majority of the employed
10:287:21611:12:12:81:529:125:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:quit from their current job, so the results for this group are very similar to those reported in our analysis.  The
10:288:21726:12:12:81:529:113:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:labor force status at the time of job offer distinguishes between those who were employed either full-time or
10:289:21835:12:12:81:529:101:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:part-time at the time of the offer.  Most individuals were employed full-time, and consequently their results are
10:290:21948:12:12:81:529:89:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:similar to what we report in our analysis.  The vast majority of the non-employed under both definitions report
10:291:22059:12:0:81:155:77:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:actively searching.
11:292:22079:0:25:81:529:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we apply our empirical findings to the model because the model characterizes a job seeker’s
11:293:22170:25:25:81:529:684:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:search behavior using their labor force status prior to exerting search effort or receiving any
11:294:22265:25:25:81:132:659:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:job offers.7
11:295:22277:25:25:98:529:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Our analysis uses a sample from the SCE of individuals aged 18 to 64 pooled across the 2013-
11:296:22369:25:25:81:529:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:15 surveys.  This provides just under 2,900 observations.  Individuals are only in the SCE for, at
11:297:22467:25:25:81:529:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:most, one year, so our sample is a panel of repeated cross sections rather than longitudinal.  By
11:298:22564:25:25:81:529:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:design, the SCE only includes heads of household.  The survey does not ask the self-employed
11:299:22656:25:25:81:529:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:about job search, so the self-employed are generally excluded by construction throughout our
11:300:22748:25:25:81:529:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:job search analysis.  Table 1 presents basic summary statistics for our analysis sample and a
11:301:22841:25:25:81:529:484:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:comparable sample using the same months of data from the CPS. The demographic statistics
11:302:22929:25:24:81:529:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:across the two surveys are roughly similar, though the shares that are married and white are
11:303:23021:24:25:81:529:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:both higher in the SCE sample.  The employment-to-population ratio, which is unaffected by
11:304:23111:25:25:81:529:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  differing  unemployment  definitions,  is  somewhat  higher  in  the  SCE  as  well.   Under  the
11:305:23213:25:25:81:529:385:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:BLS definition, the unemployment rate in the SCE is slightly higher than the CPS rate, but
11:306:23303:25:25:81:529:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:not statistically different.  Including the additional job seekers in the “job search” definition
11:307:23400:25:25:81:529:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:increases the unemployment rate considerably, from 5.3 percent to 8.0 percent, suggesting that
11:308:23494:25:25:81:467:310:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the BLS definition of unemployment misses some search activity in the economy.
11:309:23572:25:25:98:529:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:In addition to our main sample,  we also focus on two subsamples of the data.  The first
11:310:23660:25:25:81:529:260:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is  the  subsample  of  the  currently  employed  (excluding  the  currently  self-employed).   After
11:311:23761:25:25:81:529:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:removing respondents with missing data, this sample includes 1,763 respondents.  We use this
11:312:23853:25:25:81:529:210:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:subsample to examine the job search behavior that led to their hiring at their current jobs.  The
11:313:23950:25:24:81:529:185:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:second is a subsample of all individuals who received a job offer within the last six months.  By
11:314:24047:24:25:81:529:161:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:construction, some of these offers will reflect the respondent’s current job, which we identify
11:315:24142:25:16:81:529:136:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:through a separate question in the survey.  After removing offers with only partial data, the
11:316:24235:16:16:94:530:120:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:7We evaluate the performance of our measure of labor force status along several dimensions in the appendix.
11:317:24342:16:12:81:529:104:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:We also merged the SCE labor market module to the SCE monthly survey and used the labor market status
11:318:24443:12:12:81:529:92:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:from the most recent survey available for a given individual, in either September or August of the same year.
11:319:24552:12:0:81:529:80:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:The results using prior labor force status from the SCE monthly are very similar, see Table B2 in the appendix.
12:320:24665:0:25:81:529:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sample has 654 observations.  We use this sample to examine a range of job offer characteristics,
12:321:24762:25:25:81:529:684:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:including the offer wage distribution, as well as the characteristics of accepted job offers.  Note
12:322:24861:25:25:81:529:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that we first asked respondents whether they received any offer in the last month, and only if
12:323:24955:25:25:81:529:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:not, did we ask about offers received in the last 6 months.  Thus the data allow us to determine
12:324:25051:25:36:81:189:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the monthly offer rate.
12:325:25074:36:36:81:169:573:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:C:3    Evidence
12:326:25087:36:25:81:529:537:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We now turn to our empirical analysis on job search behavior.  We can summarize our main
12:327:25175:25:24:81:529:512:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:findings as follows:  (i) on-the-job search is pervasive among the employed; (ii) those searching
12:328:25272:24:25:81:529:488:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on-the-job receive at least as many offers as the unemployed; (iii) employed job seekers search
12:329:25367:25:25:81:529:463:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:less than the unemployed, but their search is more effective per unit of effort; (iv) the employed
12:330:25465:25:25:81:529:438:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:who do not search still receive a non-negligible number of (mostly unsolicited) offers; (v) the
12:331:25560:25:30:81:425:413:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employed receive better-quality offers but are less likely to accept them.
12:332:25634:30:32:81:388:383:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:C:3.1    Extensive and Intensive Margins of Job Search
12:333:25686:32:25:81:529:351:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:We begin with evidence on the basic characteristics of individual job search effort.  It is useful
12:334:25784:25:25:81:529:326:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to analyze the extensive and intensive margins of job search separately since the distribution
12:335:25878:25:25:81:529:301:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of  total  search  effort  along  both  dimensions  is  informative  for  thinking  about  the  efficiency
12:336:25984:25:25:81:530:276:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of  job  search.8Table  2  reports  the  incidence  of  job  search  by  labor  force  status,  which  we
12:337:26089:25:25:81:529:251:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:interpret as theextensive  marginof job search.  By definition, all unemployed, save for those

14:383:29148:25:25:81:529:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Some older studies that relied on survey data found pervasive job search activity among the
14:384:29239:25:25:81:529:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employed.  For example, according to Black (1980), around 14 percent of white workers and 10
14:385:29331:25:25:81:529:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:percent of black workers reported on-the-job search in the 1972 interview of the Panel Study
14:386:29423:25:25:81:529:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of Income Dynamics (PSID). Similarly, Blau and Robins (1990) report that employed search
14:387:29511:25:25:81:529:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:spells  represent  about  10  percent  of  all  employment  spells  in  the  Employment  Opportunity

14:392:29983:25:25:81:529:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:28 percent of the employed reported using the internet for job search in the last six months in
14:393:30078:25:25:81:529:385:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the 2015 survey.  We also asked a question about whether an individual searched in the last
14:394:30169:25:25:81:530:360:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f4:B:twelve months.  Around 45 percent employed reported searching in the last twelve months using
14:395:30262:25:25:81:529:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:any active search method, including online job search.  Given that we designed our survey to
14:396:30354:25:25:81:529:310:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:cast a wide net to identify any “search activity,” we find our estimates for the extensive margin

14:401:30753:25:24:81:529:185:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employed.  We find that the unemployed send substantially more job applications and dedicate
14:402:30845:24:25:81:529:161:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:more  hours  to  search  than  the  other  groups.   They  put  in  roughly  twice  as  much  effort  as

15:408:31349:25:25:81:529:684:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:half of the employed and about one-third of the unemployed apply to either one or two jobs.

15:410:31531:25:25:81:529:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:percent of the unemployed sent more than 10 applications.  The right panel of the figure shows

15:412:31726:25:25:81:529:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:more pronounced when we consider the distribution of search time.  Around 40 percent of the
15:413:31817:25:25:81:529:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employed report searching for one hour or less within the last seven days, but around 80 percent
15:414:31913:25:25:81:529:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of the unemployed searched for longer than one hour.  Moreover, searching for longer than 10
15:415:32005:25:25:81:529:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:hours a week is relatively more common among the unemployed than the employed (around 35
15:416:32093:25:25:81:529:484:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:percent vs.  15 percent).  Interestingly, even among those people who reported searching in the
15:417:32188:25:24:81:529:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:last four weeks, 25 percent of the employed and 15 percent of the unemployed did not search
15:418:32279:24:25:81:529:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:at all within the last seven days.  This observation highlights the intermittent nature of search
15:419:32376:25:25:81:529:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:effort and reinforces our view that ATUS, which is based on a time dairy reported at the daily
15:420:32470:25:25:81:530:385:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:frequency, greatly understates the extensive margin of job search.14Given that the employed
15:421:32561:25:25:81:529:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are likely to search during work hours (which they would report in the ATUS as their main
15:422:32650:25:31:81:489:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:activity during that time), the bias is likely to be more pronounced for the employed.

18:545:38575:25:24:81:529:403:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:time of a job offer can create a selection issue.16Since the focus is job search behavior by labor
18:546:38673:24:25:81:529:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:force status, we address this issue by constructing a measure of labor force status for the prior
18:547:38770:25:25:81:530:354:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:month using a wide range of survey questions from the SCE labor supplement.17In the middle
18:548:38860:25:25:81:529:329:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:panel of Table 4, we report offer outcomes by prior labor force status.  The results show that the
18:549:38958:25:25:81:529:304:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:fraction with at least one offer over the last four weeks decreases slightly for the employed, from
18:550:39057:25:25:81:529:279:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:11.8 percent to 10.5 percent, but increases substantially for the unemployed, from 22.0 percent
18:551:39152:25:25:81:529:254:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to  33.9  percent,  when  considering  labor  force  status  in  “prior  month”  instead  of  “at  time
18:552:39255:25:25:81:529:229:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of  survey”.   This  is  in  line  with  the  expectation  that  some  individuals  who  are  unemployed
18:553:39359:25:25:81:529:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:at  the  time  of  the  job  offer  started  working  by  the  time  of  the  survey.   Another  concern  is
18:554:39467:25:25:81:529:179:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that a substantial fraction of employed workers are only seeking an additional job.  Job-to-job

18:556:39652:16:15:90:530:138:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:16This selection issue is similar to the time-aggregation issue that plagues calculations of the separation rate
18:557:39764:15:8:81:147:123:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:using CPS data.
18:558:39779:8:16:90:530:115:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:17In Appendix B, we detail our methodology for determining labor force status in the prior month and evaluate
18:559:39888:16:12:81:529:99:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:our measure along several dimensions.  Unfortunately, the survey does not allow us to directly identify whether a
18:560:40001:12:12:81:529:87:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:respondent was searching on-the-job in the prior month.  We also consider an alternative measure of prior status
18:561:40113:12:0:81:396:75:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:based on the monthly SCE data and show that we obtain vary similar results.
19:562:40190:0:25:81:529:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in an individual’s main job.  Nearly all models of labor market search only consider this type of
19:563:40287:25:25:81:529:684:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:job-to-job transition as well.  In the bottom panel of Table 4, we report offer outcomes ignoring
19:564:40384:25:25:81:529:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the offers of those who reported only looking for additional work.  The fraction of the employed
19:565:40480:25:25:81:529:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:receiving at least one offer falls to 9.1 percent in this case.  We use this estimate of the offer
19:566:40578:25:25:81:253:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rate in our model calibration below.
19:567:40614:25:25:98:529:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:It  is  possible  that  some  individuals  simply  do  not  pursue  offers  that  they  are  likely  to
19:568:40717:25:25:81:530:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:reject.  In this case, the job offers we observe in the data would becensored.  Most importantly,
19:569:40814:25:25:81:529:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:this type of censoring could be correlated with employment status.  To address this issue, our
19:570:40908:25:25:81:529:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:survey asks respondents whether a potential employer indicated that they would be willing to
19:571:41000:25:25:81:529:484:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:make an offer but the respondent indicated that he or she was not interested.  We label these
19:572:41093:25:24:81:529:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:offers asunrealizedrejected offers as respondents rejected these offers even before a formal offer
19:573:41191:24:25:81:529:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:was made.  We indeed find that these unrealized offers are more common for the employed.
19:574:41279:25:25:81:529:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Among those who did not report a formal offer over the last four weeks, about 4 percent of the
19:575:41373:25:25:81:529:385:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employed indicated that they rejected such an unrealized offer, compared to only 1 percent of
19:576:41466:25:25:81:529:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the unemployed.  The bottom panel of Table 4 reports the fraction of individuals who received
19:577:41559:25:25:81:529:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:at  least  one  offer,  including  these  unrealized  offers.   Accounting  for  unrealized  offers  raises
19:578:41666:25:25:81:529:310:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the fraction receiving a job offer to 13.2 percent for the employed and to 34.9 percent for the
19:579:41761:25:25:81:141:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:unemployed.
19:580:41772:25:25:98:529:260:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Table 5 reports the acceptance rate for offers received within the last four weeks by labor
19:581:41863:25:25:81:529:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:force status in the prior month.  The results show that the unemployed are much more likely
19:582:41954:25:25:81:529:210:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to accept a given offer, with 48 to 53 percent of their offers accepted, depending on whether
19:583:42047:25:24:81:529:185:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we include all offers or just the best offer in the denominator of the acceptance rate, compared
19:584:42143:24:25:81:529:161:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:to the employed, who accept 26 to 32 percent of their offers, depending on the measure used.18
19:585:42237:25:25:81:529:136:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:In  our  calibration,  we  focus  on  the  acceptance  rates  of  the  best  offers,  excluding  offers  for
19:586:42345:25:16:81:528:111:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:additional work, which is 30.0 percent for the employed and 53.2 percent for the unemployed.
19:587:42437:16:16:90:530:95:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:18The survey only asks respondents if they accepted their best offer.  The acceptance rate including all offers
19:588:42548:16:0:81:311:79:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:assumes that none of the remaining offers were accepted.

20:605:43407:32:25:98:529:438:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Finally, we present the distribution of search effort and search outcomes across the different
20:606:43501:25:25:81:529:413:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:labor  force  categories.   Examining  these  distributions  provides  another  way  of  assessing  the
20:607:43604:25:25:81:529:388:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:relative efficiency of employed and unemployed job seekers.  Table 6 reports the distribution of
20:608:43700:25:25:81:529:363:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:respondents, job applications, and job search outcomes by labor force status.  The unemployed
20:609:43793:25:25:81:529:338:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:make up just over 7 percent of our sample, but account for nearly 40 percent of all job applica-
20:610:43889:25:25:81:529:313:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tions sent.  At the same time, they only receive 16 percent of all offers made.  In stark contrast,
20:611:43988:25:25:81:529:288:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the employed who report not looking for work send no applications by construction but account
20:612:44081:25:25:81:529:263:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for around 28 percent of all employer contacts and receive over 27 percent of all job offers.  This
20:613:44180:25:24:81:529:238:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is due,  in part,  to the fact that they also account for 44 percent of all unsolicited employer
20:614:44276:24:25:81:529:214:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:contacts and 53 percent of all unsolicited offers.  Those actively searching on the job account
20:615:44371:25:25:81:529:189:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for another 48 percent of all job offers.  Thus, the job search behavior of the unemployed can
20:616:44465:25:25:81:529:164:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:be characterized by high effort, but relatively low returns in terms of employer contacts and
20:617:44558:25:25:81:529:139:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:job offers.  The employed,  on the other hand,  fare fairly well regardless of whether they are
20:618:44653:25:25:81:529:114:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:actually  looking  for  work.   Though  the  unemployed  are  seemingly  less  effective  in  their  job
20:619:44757:25:0:81:464:89:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:search efforts, they are also more likely to accept the offers that they do receive.

21:644:46380:25:25:81:484:213:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:process.  It also asks if the offer was accepted (and if it represents their current job).

21:650:46974:12:12:81:529:94:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:residual wage offer differential that we document below is even larger if we restrict the non-employed to those

22:689:47757:25:24:81:529:443:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:non-employed.  Unconditionally, the employed receive wage offers that are about 40 log points
22:690:47850:24:25:81:530:419:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:higher than the wage offers of the non-employed.20Even after conditioning on the observable
22:691:47941:25:25:81:529:394:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:characteristics of the worker and the job offer, the employed enjoy wage offers that are 25 log

22:693:48125:25:25:81:529:344:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that, even after accounting for these controls, the distribution of wage offers for the employed
22:694:48221:25:25:81:452:319:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:stochastically dominates the distribution of wage offers for the non-employed.
22:695:48299:25:25:98:529:294:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The remainder of Table 7 shows that job offers received by the employed are superior on
22:696:48386:25:25:81:529:269:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:other  margins  as  well.   Their  hours  are  only  8  log  points  higher  (which  is  not  statistically
22:697:48493:25:25:81:529:244:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:significant),  but  they  are  20  percentage  points  more  likely  to  include  at  least  some  benefits
22:698:48600:25:25:81:529:219:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:such as retirement pay or health insurance.  The employed are nearly twice as likely to have
22:699:48692:25:16:81:529:194:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:received their offer through an unsolicited contact. The employed and non-employed are roughly
22:700:48786:16:15:90:530:178:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:20The offer wage, as well as all other wages in our analysis, refers to the real hourly wage.  Respondents report
22:701:48899:15:12:81:529:163:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:their nominal earnings as an hourly wage, or as a measure of weekly or annual earnings.  In the latter cases, we
22:702:49011:12:13:81:529:151:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:measure the wage as earnings per hour, based on the reported usual hours worked.  We convert all wages used
22:703:49118:13:7:81:302:138:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:into real terms using the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
22:704:49171:7:16:90:530:131:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:21Our conditional estimates of the offered wage and the subsequent accepted wage control for worker and job
22:705:49278:16:12:81:529:115:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:characteristics, as well as state and year fixed effects.  Our worker controls include sex, age, age squared, marital
22:706:49395:12:12:81:530:103:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:status, marital status×sex, education, race, homeowner status, and number of household children.  Our firm and
22:707:49505:12:12:81:529:91:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:job controls are the two-digit occupation of the job and the size of the offering firm.  We report estimates of the
22:708:49620:12:0:81:438:79:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:other job offer characteristics that control for observable characteristics in the appendix.
23:709:49714:0:25:81:529:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:equally  likely  to  have  had  a  “good  idea”  of  what  the  job  paid  prior  to  receiving  the  offer.
23:710:49822:25:25:81:529:684:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Potentially contributing to the differences in offer wages between the two groups, the employed
23:711:49917:25:25:81:529:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are significantly more likely to bargain over their offers, with 39 percent of their offers involving
23:712:50018:25:25:81:530:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:some bargaining, compared to 24 percent for the non-employed.22Counter-offers by the current
23:713:50110:25:25:81:529:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employer,  defined  as  anything  from  matching  the  outside  offer  to  offering  a  promotion,  pay
23:714:50213:25:25:81:529:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:raise, or some added job benefit, occurred for about 14 percent of the employed who received
23:715:50305:25:25:81:529:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:an offer from an outside firm.  Despite these relatively poor job offers, we still find that the non-
23:716:50406:25:25:81:529:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employed are about one-and-a-half times more likely to accept them, with 55 percent of offers
23:717:50499:25:25:81:529:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:accepted by the non-employed versus 35 percent by the employed.  The acceptance rates are
23:718:50588:25:25:81:529:484:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:very close to those we obtain using the prior month’s labor force status.  Table 7 also suggests
23:719:50684:25:24:81:529:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that a primary reason that the non-employed are more likely to accept their relatively poorer
23:720:50777:24:25:81:529:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:job offers is a perceived lack of alternative options.  About 27 percent of the non-employed cite
23:721:50874:25:25:81:529:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a lack of other alternatives as the main reason for accepting an offer, while only 7 percent of
23:722:50969:25:25:81:529:385:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the employed cite that as their primary reason.  The right panel of Figure 2 shows that, even
23:723:51062:25:25:81:529:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:after controlling for observed worker and job characteristics, the accepted wage distribution of
23:724:51158:25:25:81:518:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the employed stochastically dominates the accepted wage distribution of the non-employed.
23:725:51247:25:25:98:529:310:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We  can  also  examine  job  search  retrospectively  for  those  employed  at  the  time  of  the
23:726:51345:25:25:81:529:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:survey interview by asking them how they came about their current jobs.  The advantage of
23:727:51434:25:25:81:529:260:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:this approach is that we are able to examine their starting wages and previous earnings as a
23:728:51526:25:25:81:529:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:function of their labor force status.  This provides us with additional guidance for our model
23:729:51620:25:25:81:140:210:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in Section 4.

23:732:51818:25:25:81:529:136:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:from employment to their current job.  At the time of the survey interview, those hired from
23:733:51910:25:16:81:529:111:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:non-employment are paid lower wages, have fewer work hours, and are much less likely to have
23:734:52002:16:16:90:530:95:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:22These estimates are consistent with Hall and Krueger (2012) who find that around a third of all workers
23:735:52107:16:0:81:369:79:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:engaged in some bargaining over their pay with their current employer.

26:805:55644:25:25:81:529:684:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:be looking for new work at the time of the survey.  Estimates reported in the middle of Table 8
26:806:55739:25:25:81:529:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:show that most of the wage differences between those hired from employment and those hired
26:807:55829:25:25:81:529:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:from  non-employment  stem  from  wage  differences  at  their  time  of  hiring.   The  real  starting
26:808:55932:25:25:81:529:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:wage of those hired from non-employment is 28 log points lower than the real starting wage
26:809:56022:25:25:81:529:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of those hired from employment, on average.  Conditioning on the observable characteristics of
26:810:56116:25:25:81:529:559:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:the worker and the job reduces the wage difference by nearly half, to about 14 log points.23
26:811:56208:25:25:81:529:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Despite the large differences in the wage and hours of the current job across the two labor force
26:812:56305:25:25:81:529:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:categories, the differences in their previous jobs’ wages are small and statistically insignificant.
26:813:56405:25:25:81:529:484:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:This  is  true  for  both the  unconditional  real wage and  the  wage  that  controls  for observable
26:814:56507:25:24:81:529:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:worker  and  job  characteristics.   Note  that  the  smaller  difference  in  the  premium  in  starting
26:815:56612:24:25:81:529:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:wages compared to the difference in offered wages is likely due to a selection issue:  poor job
26:816:56707:25:25:81:529:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:offers are less present in the cross-section of current jobs, as individuals accepting these jobs
26:817:56804:25:25:81:529:385:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are more likely to quit and to move to better-paying jobs.  If the non-employed get worse offers
26:818:56900:25:25:81:529:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:than the employed, this explains why the E-NE gap is smaller among starting wages compared

26:821:57066:36:25:81:529:263:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:In this section, we set up and calibrate a partial equilibrium model of on-the-job search where,
26:822:57162:25:25:81:529:238:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in the spirit of Christensen et al.  (2005), both employed and unemployed workers face a random
26:823:57257:25:25:81:529:213:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:arrival of job offers.  We do not distinguish between unemployment and nonemployment in our
26:824:57348:25:16:81:529:188:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:model since our survey responses show that most of those who were non-employed when they
26:825:57436:16:15:90:530:172:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:23Our conditional estimates of the starting wage and previous wage use the same worker characteristics as our
26:826:57545:15:13:81:529:157:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:conditional estimates of the offer wage.  The starting wage uses the same firm and job controls, and additionally
26:827:57658:13:12:81:529:144:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:controls for two-digit industry.  The previous wage only includes the two-digit occupation as a job or firm control.
26:828:57774:12:12:81:529:132:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:We report estimates of the other characteristics of the current job that control for observable characteristics in
26:829:57888:12:7:81:136:120:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:the appendix.
26:830:57901:7:16:90:530:113:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:24Figure C2 in the appendix shows the distribution of starting wages relative to workers’ prior wages with
26:831:58007:16:12:81:529:97:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:and without controlling for observables.  Even after conditioning out our controls, those who transition directly
26:832:58120:12:12:81:529:85:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:from employment receive a 8 log point increase in their wage, on average, while those who were non-employed
26:833:58227:12:0:81:310:73:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:receive a 13 log point decrease in their wage, on average.

27:835:58383:25:25:81:529:684:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:this framework, ranging from a baseline model where we assume that search effort is constant
27:836:58475:25:25:81:529:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and  exogenous  to  a  model  where  search  is  endogenous  and  both  search  efficiency  and  the
27:837:58575:25:25:81:529:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:wage offer distribution vary by employment status.  We then evaluate how well the search and
27:838:58667:25:25:81:529:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:acceptance decisions in each version of the model match those observed in our data and relate to
27:839:58763:25:25:81:529:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the discussion in Hornstein, Krusell, and Violante (2011), who argued that plausibly-calibrated
27:840:58858:25:25:81:445:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:search models typically imply implausibly low flow values of unemployment.
27:841:58932:25:25:98:529:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:One can think of a variety of reasons why wage offers are better, on average, for the employed
27:842:59026:25:25:81:529:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:compared to the unemployed as we discuss following our model calibration results.  It is also
27:843:59119:25:25:81:530:484:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:possible that these differences arise simply because we cannotfullycontrol for the differences
27:844:59213:25:24:81:529:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in  the  characteristics  of  the  employed  and  the  non-employed  workers,  often  referred  to  as
27:845:59315:24:25:81:530:435:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f4:B:unobserved heterogeneity.  Those with higher unobserved skills are more likely to be employed
27:846:59408:25:25:81:529:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and more likely to earn a higher wage.  This creates a selection issue that naturally generates a
27:847:59505:25:25:81:529:385:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:wage gap between the job offers of the employed and unemployed.  We incorporate unobserved
27:848:59595:25:25:81:529:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:heterogeneity within the offer wage distribution into our model and exploit additional moments
27:849:59689:25:25:81:529:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:from our survey to quantify its importance in accounting for the wage offer differential between
27:850:59785:25:31:81:257:310:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the employed and the non-employed.

27:852:59835:32:24:81:529:247:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The model economy is comprised of homogeneous, risk neutral workers who can search on the
27:853:59924:24:25:81:530:223:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:job or while unemployed.25We allow for differences in search efficiency between the employed
27:854:60016:25:25:81:530:198:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f17:B:and unemployed.  Wage offers,w, are drawn from an i.i.d.  distribution with upper support   ̄w
27:855:60110:25:25:81:530:173:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and c.d.f.F(w), i.e.,F(w) equals the probability a wagew′≤wis drawn.  We allow for the
27:856:60196:25:16:81:529:148:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:possibility that the wage offer distribution varies for the employed and unemployed,  so that
27:857:60289:16:16:90:530:132:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:25Our model is closely related to the extension of Christensen et al.  (2005) derived by Hornstein, Krusell, and
27:858:60401:16:12:81:530:116:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:Violante (2011), but it maintains the distinction between search effort,si, and search efficiency,βi, since our
27:859:60512:12:12:81:529:104:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:data can separately identify the two, and allows for censoring in wage offers as well as exogenous differences in
27:860:60625:12:12:81:529:92:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:the wage offer distribution between the employed and unemployed.  Our model is also related to Lise (2013) who
27:861:60735:12:0:81:392:80:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:introduces precautionary savings into a model with endogenous search effort.

28:869:61376:25:25:81:529:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rates as well.  Search effort has an increasing, convex cost that may also vary by employment

28:874:61840:25:25:81:530:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and unemployed.  Theex  anteheterogeneity also affects a worker’s cost of search effort and

28:900:62574:25:16:81:529:127:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of employment is increasing in the wage.  Consequently, optimal search effort will vary with the

28:902:62765:11:16:90:530:100:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:27We could also extend the model to allow worker heterogeneity to affect the offer arrival rate, but our evidence
28:903:62878:16:12:81:529:84:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:in Appendix Table C.2 shows that controlling for observable characteristics, including the previous employment
28:904:62988:12:0:81:479:72:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:history of the worker, do little to affect the likelihood of receiving a job offer by labor force status.

29:913:63337:25:25:81:529:612:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:increasing and convex, search effort will decline with the wage.  Note that, sincese,2(x,w)<0,

31:994:68409:25:25:81:529:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and Wellschmied (2014).  We choose this estimate of wage dispersion over one derived from the
31:995:68502:25:25:81:529:310:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:SCE data because of the relatively small sample of wage offers we observe in the SCE data.
31:996:68592:25:25:81:529:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:In the full model, we set the mean log offered wage of the employed to match the difference in
31:997:68686:25:25:81:520:260:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:mean wage offers observed in the SCE data after one controls for observable characteristics.
31:998:68778:25:25:98:529:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We calibrate the remaining parameters to match the moments derived from our survey, as
31:999:68864:25:25:81:530:210:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:shown in Table 9.  First, we calibrate theβi’s to match the observed job offer arrival rates for
31:1000:68960:25:24:81:530:185:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:all offers (including unsolicited offers) for the employed and unemployed in the data.31Recall
31:1001:69054:24:25:81:530:161:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that we assume an offer production function of the formλi(s) =αi+βisand thusβiis a key
31:1002:69140:25:16:81:529:136:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:determinant of the returns to search.  For the model versions with endogenous search effort, we
31:1003:69235:16:16:90:530:120:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:31We set the offer arrival rates equal to the probability of receiving at least one offer over the course of the
31:1004:69347:16:12:81:529:104:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:last four weeks, ignoring offers for additional jobs, i.e., jobs where a worker does not leave her current employer.
31:1005:69463:12:12:81:529:92:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:We measure search effort as the average number of applications sent over the last four weeks,  again ignoring
31:1006:69572:12:0:81:189:80:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:search for additional work.
32:1007:69601:0:0:81:501:707:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:follow Christensen et al.  (2005) and let the search effort cost function beci(s) =κis1+

32:1010:69694:27:25:81:530:682:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:use their estimate ofγ= 1.19.  Note that, unlike Christensen et al.  (2005), we assume that
32:1011:69785:25:25:81:530:657:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the cost function differs for the employed and unemployed by the scaling parameterκi.  We
32:1012:69874:25:25:81:530:632:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:normalize the search effort of the unemployed to unity and set theκi’s to match the normalized
32:1013:69968:25:25:81:530:607:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:search efforts of the unemployed and employed.  We set theαi’s to match the unsolicited offer
32:1014:70061:25:25:81:529:582:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rates of the employed and unemployed.  As discussed in the empirical section, unrealized offers
32:1015:70156:25:24:81:529:557:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:represent a non-negligible fraction of overall offers among employed workers,  and we set the
32:1016:70249:24:25:81:530:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:parametersχito match the unrealized offer rates for both the employed and unemployed.  We
32:1017:70338:25:25:81:530:508:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:calibratebto match the average acceptance rate of the unemployed.  This allows our model
32:1018:70426:25:25:81:529:483:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:calibrations, by assumption, to match their job-finding rate, as both the acceptance rate and
32:1019:70519:25:25:81:529:458:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the offer rate of the unemployed are targets in the calibration.  The key test then is whether
32:1020:70613:25:25:81:454:433:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:the different models can match the average acceptance rate of theemployed.32
32:1021:70689:25:25:98:529:408:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:As Table 9 shows, in the SCE data, the offer rate of the employed is around 9 percent and the
32:1022:70782:25:25:81:529:383:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:acceptance rate is 30 percent, implying a target of 2.7 percent for the job-to-job transition rate.
32:1023:70881:25:25:81:529:358:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:This rate is above the average employer-to-employer transition rate in the CPS, which averages
32:1024:70975:25:25:81:529:333:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:around 1.9 percent for our sample period.33However, there are also job-to-job transitions that
32:1025:71069:25:24:81:529:308:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:do not involve employer changes.  For the time period that we consider, around 1 percent of
32:1026:71160:24:25:81:529:284:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employed  workers  reported  that  the  usual  activities  and  duties  of  their  current  job  changed
32:1027:71264:25:25:81:529:259:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:since the prior month and another 0.9 percent reported a change in job description in the CPS.
32:1028:71358:25:25:81:529:234:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Adding up all these transition implies a job-to-job transition rate of 3.8 percent.  Our target
32:1029:71453:25:25:81:529:209:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for  the  job-to-job  transition  rate  in  the  SCE  (2.7  percent)  is  between  the  strict  and  broad
32:1030:71559:25:25:81:529:184:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:definitions of the job-to-job transition rate in the CPS. If we think of the job-ladder model as
32:1031:71655:25:16:81:529:159:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a change in job description and salary, it is natural to take into account internal moves when
32:1032:71749:16:16:90:530:143:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:32Another option would be to assume that it is equal to a specific value as in Shimer (2005) or Hall and Milgrom
32:1033:71861:16:12:81:529:127:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:(2008),  but we prefer our approach of inferring it directly from our data,  because there is little consensus of
32:1034:71974:12:7:81:369:115:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:what the appropriate level ofbis, except that it should not be too low.
32:1035:72045:7:16:90:530:108:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:33The calculation of the transition rate from one employer to the other is based on the following question:
32:1036:72152:16:12:81:529:92:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:Last month, it was reported that you worked for (employer’s name).  Do you still work for (employer’s name)

33:1040:72390:25:25:81:530:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a low-xand a high-xtype.  We calibrate thexfor each type by setting it toxlow=−σxand

33:1042:72562:25:25:81:529:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:control  for  unobserved  worker  and  job  characteristics.   We  choose  to  target  the  residualized
33:1043:72666:25:25:81:447:584:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:moments since our goal is to quantify the role ofunobservedheterogeneity.35
33:1044:72741:25:25:98:529:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:A key issue in the models with worker-heterogeneity is the skewness of the unemployment
33:1045:72828:25:25:81:530:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:pool towards the low-xtypes.  For the purpose of our calibration here, we assume that (1) the
33:1046:72921:25:25:81:530:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:average ofδ(x) matches a monthly separation rate of 0.015 and (2) we match the difference in
33:1047:73013:25:25:81:529:484:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:prior wages between the employed and unemployed that can not be explained by observable
33:1048:73100:25:24:81:529:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:characteristics.   The  latter  is  the  critical  moment  that  identifies  the  skewness  of  the  unem-
33:1049:73206:24:25:81:529:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ployment pool towards the low-productivity types.  In other words,  the larger the difference
33:1050:73299:25:25:81:530:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:betweenδ(xlow) andδ(xhigh), the lower the average productivity of the unemployed and thus
33:1051:73388:25:31:81:339:385:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:the lower the average prior wage of the unemployed.36

33:1053:73515:32:25:81:529:322:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Table 9 shows the simulation results for all four versions of our model. In the basic version of the
33:1054:73615:25:16:81:529:297:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:model, which has exogenous offer arrival rates and search effort, the unemployed are 2.7 times
33:1055:73709:16:16:90:530:281:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:34A longstanding literature in personnel economics documented the importance of internal hires.  For example,
33:1056:73818:16:12:81:529:265:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:Lazear and Oyer (2004), using employee-employer data from Sweden show that firms fill a substantial fraction of
33:1057:73929:12:12:81:529:253:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:jobs internally and that the rate of internal hiring relative to external hiring increases monotonically at higher
33:1058:74043:12:12:81:529:241:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:levels.  At lower levels around 40 percent of jobs are filled internally while at the higher levels, almost 90 percent
33:1059:74161:12:7:81:494:229:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:of hires come from within the firm.  This evidence points to the prominence of within-firm job ladders.
33:1060:74264:7:24:90:397:222:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:?:35To be more precise, we assume that our observed offered wage,  ̃y, satisfies

33:1066:74487:20:12:81:529:135:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:We assume a moderate degree of measurement error of 13 percent of the unconditional variance in offered wages,

35:1118:76626:25:25:81:529:684:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:unemployed receive more than twice as many offers as the employed, and the basic version of
35:1119:76717:25:25:81:529:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the model abstracts from all other aspects of job search.  The models with endogenous search
35:1120:76809:25:25:81:529:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:effort,  however,  imply  the  opposite  finding.   In  all  three  cases,  the  models  predict  that  the
35:1121:76916:25:25:81:529:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employed have a search efficiency parameter of 0.93-0.95, while the unemployed have a search
35:1122:77008:25:25:81:529:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:efficiency parameter of 0.32, implying that the employed are almost three times more efficient
35:1123:77102:25:25:81:529:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:per unit of search effort.  The high level of search efficiency and low level of search effort among
35:1124:77202:25:25:81:529:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the employed implies a very high cost of search for the employed in our calibration.  Censoring
35:1125:77297:25:25:81:529:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of the wage offer distribution due to unrealized, rejected offers appears to be negligible for the
35:1126:77395:25:25:81:530:484:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:unemployed  but  substantial  for  the  employed,  as  indicated  by  the  parametersχi.   About  6
35:1127:77494:25:24:81:529:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:percent of offers are unrealized for the unemployed but 35-39 percent of offers are unrealized
35:1128:77588:24:25:81:164:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for the employed.
35:1129:77605:25:25:98:529:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:In our baseline version of the model, the job offer acceptance rate of the employed is 17.6
35:1130:77696:25:25:81:529:385:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:percent, well below the empirical estimate of 30.0 percent in our survey.  In this version, workers
35:1131:77795:25:25:81:529:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:who move up the wage ladder reject most offers once they get near the top.  The versions of the
35:1132:77890:25:25:81:529:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:model with endogenous search effort improve on this substantially.  The acceptance rate rises
35:1133:77983:25:25:81:529:310:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to over 21 percent in the two intermediate versions of the model where we allow for endogenous
35:1134:78077:25:25:81:529:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:search but maintain an identical wage offer distribution for the employed and unemployed.  In
35:1135:78170:25:25:81:529:260:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:these versions, workers at the bottom of the wage ladder are more likely to accept an offer and,
35:1136:78266:25:25:81:529:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:due to endogenous search, are also more likely to receive an offer than those at the top of the
35:1137:78361:25:25:81:529:210:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ladder.  When we include differing wage offer distributions by employment status, we match
35:1138:78451:25:24:81:529:185:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the empirical acceptance rate of the employed exactly.  In this version of the model, the wage
35:1139:78545:24:25:81:529:161:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:offer distribution of the employed stochastically dominates the wage offer distribution of the
35:1140:78639:25:25:81:530:136:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:unemployed, so the acceptance rate for an employed worker at the reservation wageRexceeds
35:1141:78728:25:25:81:300:111:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the acceptance rate of an unemployed worker.
35:1142:78772:25:0:98:529:86:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Our  first  two  versions  of  the  model,  which  ignore  unobserved  heterogeneity,  generate  a
36:1143:78872:0:25:81:529:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:positive but negligible wage offer gap between the employed and unemployed of just two log
36:1144:78962:25:25:81:529:684:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:points.  This is due to the differential censoring of the wage offer distribution by employment
36:1145:79057:25:25:81:113:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:status.
36:1146:79064:25:25:98:529:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:When we add heterogeneity to the model but maintain identical wage offer distributions for
36:1147:79154:25:25:81:529:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the employed and the unemployed (i.e., the third version of the model), the wage offer gap only
36:1148:79249:25:25:81:529:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rises to 4 log points.  Half of the gap is due to censoring while the other half is due to worker
36:1149:79346:25:25:81:529:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:heterogeneity.  Adding worker heterogeneity, we match the differential in prior wages of about
36:1150:79440:25:25:81:529:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:-10 log points between the employed and unemployed.  In both the model and the data, prior
36:1151:79530:25:25:81:529:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:wages are higher for the unemployed.  This is because the prior wages of the employed tend to
36:1152:79623:25:25:81:529:484:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:be from jobs further down the wage ladder, while the prior wages of the unemployed are wages
36:1153:79715:25:24:81:529:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:prior to a separation and thus further up on the wage ladder.  With worker-heterogeneity, the
36:1154:79808:24:25:81:529:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:pool of unemployed is skewed towards the low-xtypes.  This reduces the gap in prior wages
36:1155:79897:25:25:81:529:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:between the employed and the unemployed so as to match the empirically-observed gap (to see
36:1156:79988:25:25:81:286:385:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:this, compare columns 2 and 3 in Table 9).
36:1157:80030:25:25:98:529:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:In the full version of the model, which additionally allows for a differing wage offer distri-
36:1158:80124:25:25:81:529:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:bution by employment status, we impose a 25 log point wage offer gap based on the observed
36:1159:80214:25:25:81:529:310:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:gap in the data once we control for observable characteristics.  Interestingly, this version of the
36:1160:80313:25:25:81:529:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:model attributes a larger fraction of the gap to unobserved worker heterogeneity.  The reason
36:1161:80406:25:25:81:529:260:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is that,  in this model version,  for a givenx,  there is a larger differential in prior wages.  As
36:1162:80505:25:25:81:529:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a consequence, the pool of unemployed needs to be more skewed towards the low-xtypes for
36:1163:80593:25:25:81:529:210:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the model to match the observed differential in prior wages.  The unemployment rate of the
36:1164:80683:25:24:81:530:185:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:low-xtype is 8.9 percent as compared to 6.5 percent for the high-xtype,  implying that the
36:1165:80773:24:25:81:529:161:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:share of the low-productivity group is 57.7 percent among the unemployed.  This is consistent
36:1166:80866:25:25:81:529:136:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with Mueller (2017) who finds in the CPS data that unemployment risk is 36 percent higher
36:1167:80955:25:25:81:529:111:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for workers below the median residual wage (i.e., after controlling for observables) compared
36:1168:81048:25:0:81:529:86:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to those above the median residual wage, implying that the share of low-residual wage workers
37:1169:81143:0:25:81:529:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:among the unemployed is 57.6 percent in the CPS data.  Yet, despite this non-trivial degree
37:1170:81234:25:25:81:529:684:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of  negative  selection  among  the  unemployed  in  our  model,  it  accounts  for  only  about  7  log
37:1171:81338:25:25:81:529:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:points out of the 25 log point residual wage premium of the employed.  The contribution of
37:1172:81428:25:25:81:529:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:censoring  remains  small,  again  explaining  only  two  log  points  of  the  wage  offer  gap.   Thus,
37:1173:81533:25:25:81:529:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:our  calibration  of  the  full  model  suggests  that  neither  unobserved  worker  heterogeneity  nor
37:1174:81636:25:25:81:529:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:differential censoring of the wage offer distribution can explain the remaining 16 log points (64
37:1175:81733:25:25:81:227:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:percent) of the wage offer gap.
37:1176:81764:25:25:98:529:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Table 9 also reports the flow value of unemployment relative to the average wage in the
37:1177:81851:25:25:81:529:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:economy.  Hornstein, Krusell, and Violante (2011) advocate that any search model that aims
37:1178:81941:25:25:81:529:484:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to  fit  transition  rates  and  wage  dispersion  should  have  its  performance  evaluated  using  its
37:1179:82045:25:24:81:529:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:implied flow value of unemployment.  The reason is that search models often imply very low
37:1180:82135:24:25:81:529:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:or even negative flow values.  Our benchmark job-ladder model without search effort implies
37:1181:82226:25:25:81:529:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a flow value of unemployment of 0.33, which is slightly below the lower end of the parameter
37:1182:82318:25:25:81:529:385:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:values used in the literature.  Note that the dispersion of offer wages used for this exercise is
37:1183:82415:25:25:81:529:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:relatively modest, as in Hall and Mueller (2017).  If we used a higher level of wage dispersion,
37:1184:82511:25:25:81:529:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the benchmark model would fare worse, implying an even lower flow value of unemployment.
37:1185:82599:25:25:81:529:310:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The models with endogenous search effort do substantially better at producing a reasonable
37:1186:82689:25:25:81:529:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:flow  value  of  unemployment  of  between  0.50  and  0.69,  depending  on  whether  one  nets  out
37:1187:82789:25:25:81:140:260:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:search costs.
37:1188:82802:25:25:98:529:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Finally,  our  model  with  differential  offer  distributions  by  employment  status  performs
37:1189:82898:25:25:81:529:210:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:demonstrably better than the other three models in matching the amount of wage dispersion
37:1190:82987:25:24:81:529:185:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:observed in the data.  Hornstein,  Krusell,  and Violante (2011) argue that a standard model
37:1191:83079:24:25:81:529:161:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of frictional search and matching in the labor market can only account for a tiny fraction of
37:1192:83172:25:25:81:529:136:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the wage dispersion observed in the data.  They find that extending the model to include on-
37:1193:83264:25:25:81:529:111:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the-job search can increase the ratio of the mean wage to the minimum wage observed in the
37:1194:83354:25:0:81:529:86:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:data (the mean-min ratio), as high as 1.4, but not nearly as high as the 1.7 ratio they observe
38:1195:83451:0:25:81:529:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in the data.  Our baseline model that includes on-the-job search yields a mean-min wage ratio
38:1196:83544:25:25:81:529:684:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of 1.43, very similar to their estimate.  Endogenizing search effort increases the implied ratio
38:1197:83640:25:25:81:529:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to 1.48.  The model, which also allows for heterogeneity in wage offer distributions, increases
38:1198:83735:25:25:81:530:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the ratio (conditional on worker-heterogeneityx) to 1.68.  The ability of our model to generate

38:1207:84539:25:25:81:529:397:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:were more likely to be unemployed and less likely to have worked in the past.  This observation
38:1208:84634:25:25:81:529:372:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:makes the work history of a worker a useful proxy for unobserved heterogeneity.  Our survey
38:1209:84725:25:25:81:529:347:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:allows us to control for workers’ labor force history over the last five years.  As Table 10 shows,
38:1210:84824:25:25:81:529:322:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:controlling  for  the  fraction  of  the  last  five  years  that  the  worker  was  employed  reduces  the
38:1211:84931:25:25:81:529:297:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:wage offer gap from 0.25 to 0.22.  When we additionally control for share of time unemployed
38:1212:85023:25:25:81:529:272:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and  share  of  time  spent  as  a  student,  the  difference  goes  down  to  0.21.   When  we  run  the
38:1213:85128:25:24:81:529:247:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:same regression on the model-generated data, we find that the difference goes down from 0.25
38:1214:85220:24:25:81:529:223:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to  0.21,  very  similar  to  the  data  verifying  the  usefulness  of  labor  force  history  as  a  control
38:1215:85330:25:25:81:529:198:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for  unobserved  heterogeneity.   The  congruence  of  the  regression  results  in  the  data  and  the
38:1216:85434:25:16:81:529:173:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:model is particularly noteworthy because the calibration of our model exploits an independent
38:1217:85527:16:16:90:530:157:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:37It is not clear what the empirical target for the dispersion in offered wages should be.  Hornstein, Krusell, and
38:1218:85642:16:12:81:529:141:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:Violante (2011) find mean-min ratios of 1.48 to above 2, depending on how narrowly they define a given labor
38:1219:85750:12:12:81:529:129:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:market.  Our measure of dispersion is taken from Hall and Mueller (2017) who estimate the standard deviation
38:1220:85858:12:12:81:529:117:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:of wage offers for a given worker at 0.24.  This estimate is at the upper end of other papers who identify the
38:1221:85968:12:12:81:529:105:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:dispersion of wage offers from wage changes associated with job switches for a given individual (e.g.,  Tjaden
38:1222:86078:12:12:81:529:93:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:and Wellschmied, 2014).  Interestingly, the mean-min ratio in our model with endogenous search effort exactly
38:1223:86187:12:0:81:473:81:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:matches the lower end of the mean-min wage ratios reported in Hornstein, Krusell, and Violante.

39:1225:86380:25:25:81:529:684:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to go one step further and ask how powerful a proxy work history is to control for unobserved
39:1226:86473:25:25:81:529:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:heterogeneity since our model provides us with an estimate of the role of unobserved hetero-
39:1227:86565:25:25:81:530:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:geneity.  If we shut down the differences inx, the wage offer differential goes down from 0.25
39:1228:86659:25:25:81:529:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to 0.18 suggesting that controlling for work history controls for more than half of the effect of

40:1257:88567:25:25:81:529:684:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ings is that the employed are more selective in their job search and apply only to jobs that
40:1258:88659:25:25:81:529:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:they think would dominate their current job.  Furthermore, workers further up the wage ladder
40:1259:88752:25:25:81:529:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:should  be  more  selective.   We  address  this  concern  in  our  baseline  model  by  accounting  for
40:1260:88856:25:25:81:529:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:censoring of the wage offer distribution.  The results in Table 9 show that this only accounts
40:1261:88950:25:25:81:529:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for eight percent of the observed wage offer gap.  Our approach, however, only addresses the
40:1262:89042:25:25:81:529:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rejection of unrealized offers.  It does not account for censoring due to employers passing on
40:1263:89136:25:25:81:529:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:extending job offers to those they feel are out of their reach.  We address this possibility by cal-
40:1264:89236:25:25:81:529:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ibrating a version of the model where the offer distributions are assumed to be the same for the
40:1265:89332:25:25:81:530:484:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employed and unemployed, but choose the censoring parameter,χe, to match the acceptance
40:1266:89419:25:24:81:529:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rate of the employed, which constitutes a natural upper bound on the extent of censoring in
40:1267:89510:24:25:81:530:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employed offers.39This version implies a substantial incidence of censoring of the wage offers
40:1268:89604:25:25:81:530:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of the employed, withχeof 0.72, and thus endogenously generates a wage offer differential of
40:1269:89696:25:25:81:529:385:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:observed offers of 0.08.  However, this calibration generates only half of the wage offer differ-
40:1270:89793:25:25:81:529:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ential observed in the data (0.12 in the model vs.  0.25 in the data) suggesting that even if
40:1271:89886:25:25:81:529:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we attribute the high acceptance rate of the employed to censoring, the model still falls short
40:1272:89981:25:25:81:529:310:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of explaining the wage offer differential.  At the same time, it is worth pointing out that this
40:1273:90077:25:25:81:529:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:version generates a reasonable flow value of unemployment of 0.70 and a mean-min ratio of 1.58
40:1274:90171:25:25:81:529:260:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:even though we do not allow for any exogenous wage offer differential.  The reason is that this
40:1275:90266:25:25:81:529:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:version of the model implies a very high underlying contact rate for the employed, and thus
40:1276:90357:25:25:81:529:210:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:limits the option value of unemployment to a similar extent as the model with an exogenous

40:1281:90774:16:12:81:529:103:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:calibration of job ladder models.  This version produces somewhat lower wage dispersion and implies a lower
40:1282:90881:12:0:81:370:91:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:flow value of unemployment than the baseline but differences are small.

41:1284:91050:25:25:81:529:684:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:wage dispersion as measured by the mean-min ratio is of course larger under this calibration

41:1286:91238:25:25:81:270:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and from 1.68 to 1.94 in the full model.

41:1293:91844:25:24:81:529:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:unemployed)  at  the  95th  percentile  of  the  stationary  effort  distribution,  which  is  somewhat
41:1294:91947:24:25:81:529:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:below  the  0.38  value  observed  in  the  data.   The  shape  of  the  search  effort  distribution  for

41:1297:92235:25:25:81:529:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:95th percentile of the distribution.  These versions of the model generate more search at the
41:1298:92328:25:25:81:529:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:bottom of the wage ladder and less at the top, consistent with our empirical findings.  Implied
41:1299:92423:25:25:81:423:310:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:B:flow values for unemployment and mean-min ratios are little changed.40

41:1302:92669:25:25:81:529:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is lower than the transition rate used in Hornstein, Krusell, and Violante (2011), which they
41:1303:92762:25:25:81:529:210:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:target directly.  This is partly driven by their sample period (1994-2007) and by their use of
41:1304:92856:25:24:81:529:185:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:total unemployment outflows (both to employment and out of the labor force) when calculating
41:1305:92948:24:16:81:529:161:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the transition rate.  To see how this affects our calibration,  we increase the offer rate of the
41:1306:93045:16:16:90:530:145:6:g_d0_f7:9:g_d0_f8:F:40Another robustness check we performed was to target the acceptance rate of all offers as opposed to the
41:1307:93150:16:12:81:529:129:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:acceptance rate of best offers, which ignores the implicit rejection of offers received along with the best offer.
41:1308:93264:12:12:81:529:117:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:While the acceptance rate of all offers is lower for the employed, so is the acceptance rate of the unemployed
41:1309:93374:12:12:81:529:105:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:and thus the model does no better in matching the acceptance rate of the employed.  We believe that targeting
41:1310:93483:12:12:81:529:93:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:the acceptance rate of best offers as our baseline is consistent with using the fraction receiving at least one offer
41:1311:93600:12:0:81:325:81:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:in a given month as our measure of the job offer probability.
42:1312:93663:0:25:81:529:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:unemployed  to  0.60,  from  0.339,  which  implies  the  unemployment-to-employment  transition
42:1313:93759:25:25:81:529:684:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rate of 0.32 targeted by Hornstein, Krusell, and Violante (2011).  The results indicate a flow
42:1314:93853:25:25:81:529:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:value  of  unemployment  of  0.16  and  0.58  for  the  two  versions  of  our  model  with  unobserved
42:1315:93956:25:25:81:529:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:worker heterogeneity that preclude and allow for differing wage offer distributions between the
42:1316:94051:25:25:81:529:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employed and unemployed, respectively.  Thus, our resolution of the puzzle holds for the full
42:1317:94144:25:25:81:182:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:version of our model.

42:1319:94247:25:25:81:529:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:feature observed heterogeneity such as education and gender, our baseline calibration targets
42:1320:94340:25:25:81:529:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:data moments that control for observable worker and job characteristics. As a robustness check,
42:1321:94435:25:25:81:529:484:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we also consider a calibration where we target the raw, unconditional moments in our data.  In
42:1322:94529:25:24:81:529:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:this case, the empirical wage offer gap between the employed and unemployed is 0.40.  While
42:1323:94620:24:25:81:529:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the importance of heterogeneity obviously rises relative to our baseline in this case, nearly half
42:1324:94718:25:25:81:529:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of the wage offer differential remains unexplained by either worker heterogeneity or censoring
42:1325:94812:25:25:81:223:385:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of the wage offer distribution.
42:1326:94843:25:25:98:529:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:In  summary,  we  take  from  our  calibration  exercise  that  models  with  endogenous  search
42:1327:94939:25:25:81:529:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:effort and wage offer distributions that differ across labor force status do better at fitting the
42:1328:95037:25:25:81:529:310:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:relevant facts in our survey and in particular the acceptance rate of the employed, which was not
42:1329:95134:25:25:81:529:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:targeted in the calibration.  The models also produce reasonable flow values of unemployment.
42:1330:95227:25:25:81:529:260:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:While there is substantial disagreement in the literature on the exact value of the flow value,
42:1331:95322:25:25:81:529:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ranging from 0.4 (Shimer, 2005) to near unity (Hagedorn and Manovskii, 2008), it is difficult
42:1332:95415:25:25:81:529:210:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to rationalize a value below 0.4.  Our full version of the model with endogenous search effort,
42:1333:95510:25:36:81:504:185:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:worker-heterogeneity and differing wage offer distributions produces a flow value of 0.74.
42:1334:95600:36:35:81:253:149:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:C:5    Concluding Remarks
42:1335:95623:35:25:81:529:114:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:In  this  paper,  we  document  new  facts  about  the  search  effort  and  search  outcomes  of  both
42:1336:95726:25:0:81:529:89:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employed and non-employed workers.  We find that search among the employed is pervasive
43:1337:95815:0:25:81:529:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and  more  efficient.   Moreover,  among  the  employed,  we  find  a  strong  correlation  of  search
43:1338:95917:25:25:81:529:684:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:outcomes  and  effort,  with  those  searching  having  a  five  times  higher  chance  of  receiving  at
43:1339:96022:25:25:81:529:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:least  one  offer  over  the  period  of  a  month.   Nevertheless,  a  sizable  fraction  of  job  offers  go
43:1340:96132:25:25:81:529:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to  employed  workers  not  even  looking  for  work,  underscoring  the  importance  of  unsolicited
43:1341:96233:25:25:81:529:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employer  contacts  in  the  job  search  process.   We  also  find  that  the  employed  are  not  only
43:1342:96337:25:25:81:529:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:more efficient in their search, but they also tend to receive and accept better job offers.  The
43:1343:96433:25:25:81:529:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:differences in search outcomes persist even after controlling for observable characteristics of the
43:1344:96532:25:25:81:156:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:worker and job.
43:1345:96547:25:25:98:529:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We apply our results to an on-the-job search framework with endogenous search effort and
43:1346:96635:25:25:81:530:484:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:unobservedex anteworker heterogeneity, also accounting for the many distinct aspects of our
43:1347:96726:25:24:81:529:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:data such as unsolicited offers, censoring, and heterogeneity in search efficiency by labor force
43:1348:96823:24:25:81:529:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:status.   We  find  that  unobserved  heterogeneity  explains  only  28  percent  of  the  offered  wage
43:1349:96927:25:25:81:529:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:differential between the employed and the unemployed.  Extending our model by allowing for
43:1350:97017:25:25:81:529:385:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:differences in wage offer distributions provides a remarkably good fit to the data, generating
43:1351:97111:25:25:81:529:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:enough wage dispersion and a reasonable flow value of unemployment.  Our empirical findings
43:1352:97202:25:25:81:530:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:thus constitute an important piece in the resolution of thefrictional wage dispersion puzzlein
43:1353:97296:25:25:81:249:310:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the search and matching literature.
43:1354:97331:25:25:98:529:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:An  open  question  remains  as  to  why  wage  offers  appear  to  be  of  better  quality  for  the
43:1355:97432:25:25:81:529:260:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employed compared to the non-employed even after controlling for unobserved heterogeneity
43:1356:97521:25:25:81:529:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and the censoring of job offers.  One can think of a variety of possible reasons.  Some are more
43:1357:97617:25:25:81:529:210:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:familiar  to  the  literature  that  has  studied  wages,  job  loss,  and  unemployment,  while  others
43:1358:97721:25:24:81:529:185:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are more specific to the job search process.  While we leave a thorough evaluation of different
43:1359:97816:24:25:81:382:161:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:mechanisms to future research, we briefly discuss these factors.
43:1360:97880:25:25:98:529:136:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:One possibility is that human capital depreciates during periods of non-employment.  In
43:1361:97967:25:25:81:529:111:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:this case,  the employed and non-employed may have a similar wage (and potentially similar
43:1362:98057:25:0:81:529:86:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:skill  levels)  when  they  separate  from  their  previous  job,  but  the  skills  of  the  non-employed
44:1363:98165:0:25:81:529:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:depreciate, leading them to have lower-quality job offers, on average.  In this case, accounting
44:1364:98261:25:25:81:529:684:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for the work history of the employed and non-employed would reduce the gap.  We show that
44:1365:98350:25:25:81:529:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:controlling  for  the  previous  five-year  work  history  (specifically,  the  fraction  of  the  prior  five
44:1366:98460:25:25:81:529:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:years spent employed, unemployed, etc.)  only reduces the wage gap from 0.250 to 0.205.  This
44:1367:98553:25:25:81:529:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:suggests that human capital depreciation can explain only a small fraction of the wage offer
44:1368:98645:25:25:81:529:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:gap.  As discussed in the previous section, questions about five-year work histories do a good
44:1369:98739:25:25:81:381:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:job at capturing unobserved differences in worker productivity.
44:1370:98802:25:25:98:529:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The presence of bargaining and counter-offers are another way the search process can affect
44:1371:98893:25:25:81:529:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the wage offer gap.  We find that 39 percent of offers to the employed, while only 24 percent of
44:1372:98989:25:25:81:529:484:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:offers to the non-employed, involved some bargaining between the individual and the potential
44:1373:99082:25:24:81:529:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employer.   In  general,  a  greater  propensity  to  bargain  with  the  potential  employer  should
44:1374:99183:24:25:81:529:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:increase the reported wage offer, all else equal.  Moreover, 14 percent of the employed with an
44:1375:99278:25:25:81:529:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:outside offer received some form of counter-offer from their current employer.  While the latter
44:1376:99374:25:25:81:529:385:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimate  falls  clearly  short  of  the  rate  of  counter-offers  in  models  such  as  Postel-Vinay  and
44:1377:99481:25:25:81:529:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Robin (2002) and Cahuc, Postel-Vinay, and Robin (2006), it is possible that the threat of such
44:1378:99575:25:25:81:529:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:counter-offers raises the mean wage offers for the employed even when no such offer occurs in
44:1379:99668:25:25:81:138:310:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:equilibrium.
44:1380:99680:25:25:98:529:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The employed may have access to more effective job search networks that provide better job
44:1381:99770:25:25:81:529:260:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:offers (see, for example, Arbex, O’Dey, and Wiczer, 2016).  Our empirical analysis shows that
44:1382:99863:25:25:81:529:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the employed are about twice as likely to have received an offer through an unsolicited contact
44:1383:99958:25:25:81:529:210:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:as  the  non-employed.   If  these  informal  offers  represent  higher-quality  jobs,  then  the  higher
44:1384:100063:25:24:81:529:185:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:incidence of unsolicited offers should also contribute to the wage offer gap.  However, we find
44:1385:100158:24:25:81:529:161:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that unsolicited offers have lower wages, on average, and that there is no significant difference
44:1386:100255:25:25:81:529:136:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:between the unsolicited offers of the employed and non-employed.  If anything, the employed
44:1387:100346:25:25:81:529:111:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:receive slightly lower wage offers from unsolicited contacts than the non-employed,  with our
44:1388:100439:25:0:81:529:86:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimates indicating that the log wage offer of the employed is a statistically-insignificant 0.023
45:1389:100540:0:25:81:109:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lower.
45:1390:100546:25:25:98:529:684:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Finally, our evidence is also consistent with an implicit penalty for job seeking while unem-
45:1391:100639:25:25:81:529:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ployed, in line with the results of Kroft, Lange, and Notowidigdo (2013).  Such a penalty could
45:1392:100734:25:25:81:529:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:be due to either explicit discrimination or a perceived signal about a worker’s unobserved pro-
45:1393:100829:25:25:81:529:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ductivity that employers infer from their employment status (as in Gibbons and Katz, 1991).
45:1394:100920:25:25:81:529:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:It is also possible that it is the result of firms discriminating against the unemployed to take
45:1395:101016:25:25:81:529:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:advantage  of  their  lower  reservation  wages  (as  in  Carrillo-Tudela,  2009).   Regardless  of  its
45:1396:101120:25:25:81:529:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:source, any such penalty on job search while unemployed would imply that the employed and
45:1397:101209:25:0:81:352:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:unemployed draw from differing wage offer distributions.

51:1503:108835:25:25:81:529:501:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:non-employed individuals (predominantly the retired and disabled), who report that they either
51:1504:108929:25:25:81:379:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:do not want work or cannot work, to ask if they had searched.
51:1505:108990:25:25:98:529:451:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Our  survey  suggests  that  many  of  these  individuals  actively  search  and  are  available  for
51:1506:109091:25:25:81:529:426:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:work.  Table A1 shows that they represent just over 12 percent of those counted as out of the
51:1507:109184:25:25:81:529:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:labor force under the CPS definition.  As Table 1 in the main text shows, including these indi-
51:1508:109279:25:24:81:529:376:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:viduals in our job search measure increases the measured unemployment rate by 2.7 percentage
51:1509:109371:24:25:81:529:352:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:points.  Further analysis (not reported here) suggests that the majority of the difference is due
51:1510:109468:25:25:81:322:327:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to retired individuals seeking only part-time work.
51:1511:109519:25:25:98:529:302:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Tables A1, A2, and A3 replicate our job search analysis using the CPS scope and definition
51:1512:109609:25:25:81:529:277:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of unemployment.  Using the SCE labor survey,  this counts those non-employed who do not
51:1513:109697:25:25:81:529:252:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:explicitly report wanting work as out of the labor force, regardless of whether they later report
51:1514:109794:25:25:81:529:227:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that they actively searched and are available.  The tables correspond to Tables 2, 3, and 4 in
51:1515:109888:25:25:81:529:202:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the main text, though we only report the replicated results of Tables 3 and 4 by labor force
51:1516:109980:25:25:81:529:177:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:status at the time of the survey since the difference in unemployment definition only matters
51:1517:110073:25:25:81:529:152:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for this period.  We determine labor force status in the previous month using responses from a
51:1518:110167:25:25:81:529:127:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:variety of other survey questions that do not directly correspond to the CPS definition.  Note
51:1519:110261:25:24:81:529:102:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:also that the results for the employed (regardless of whether they actively searched for work)
51:1520:110355:24:0:81:254:78:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are the same under both definitions.
52:1521:110393:0:25:98:529:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Table A1 shows that there is a sizable fraction (12 percent) of those out of the labor force
52:1522:110485:25:25:81:529:684:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:actively searching and available for work.  By definition, none of these individuals are out of
52:1523:110580:25:25:81:529:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  labor  force  using  the  job  search  measure  of  unemployment.   A  similar  fraction  of  those
52:1524:110684:25:25:81:529:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:out of the labor force sent at least one application in the prior four weeks or spent some time
52:1525:110779:25:25:81:529:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:searching in the previous seven days.  Unlike the unemployed under the CPS definition, about
52:1526:110871:25:25:81:529:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:half of those actively searching from out of the labor force are only seeking part-time work.
52:1527:110964:25:25:81:529:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Conditional on actively searching, just under 10 percent are looking for work similar to their
52:1528:111058:25:25:81:158:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:most recent job.
52:1529:111074:25:25:98:529:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Tables A2 and A3 show that moving from our job search measure to the CPS measure of
52:1530:111157:25:25:81:529:484:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:unemployment has only a minor effect on our estimates for the intensive margin of search effort
52:1531:111252:25:24:81:529:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and search outcomes for the unemployed.  The CPS definition implies a somewhat higher level
52:1532:111343:24:25:81:529:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of search effort.  The number of applications rises by 19 percent, to 9.65 per month, and time
52:1533:111437:25:25:81:529:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:spent searching rises by 30 percent, to 10.96 hours per week.  The number of employer contacts,
52:1534:111532:25:25:81:529:385:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:job interviews, and job offers received all rise somewhat as well, though the differences between
52:1535:111629:25:25:81:529:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the estimates in Table A3 and Table 4 in the main text are not statistically significant.  The job
52:1536:111727:25:25:81:529:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:search definition and the CPS definition of employment also imply similar ratios of employer
52:1537:111819:25:25:81:372:310:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:contacts per application and mean job offers per application.
52:1538:111880:25:25:98:529:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Finally, note that the definitions used here have no bearing on our model calibration since
52:1539:111971:25:30:81:529:260:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:it uses job search effort and outcome estimates based on labor force status in the prior month.

52:1544:112393:25:25:81:386:123:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rare, particularly when one wants to measure on-the-job search.

55:1656:116876:25:25:81:529:219:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:between the frequencies over which each survey measures search time, which we cannot control
55:1657:116968:25:25:81:529:194:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for.   The  ATUS  measures  search  time  for  the  previous  day  using  a  detailed  time  diary  of
55:1658:117070:25:25:81:529:169:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:activities, while the SCE asks respondents the number of hours they spent searching for work
55:1659:117162:25:24:81:220:144:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:over the previous seven days.
55:1660:117191:24:25:98:529:120:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We find notable differences between our estimates of time spent searching for work in the

56:1663:117438:0:25:81:529:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:much  more  time  spent  searching  for  work  overall,  but  less  time  spent  searching  in  terms  of
56:1664:117543:25:25:81:529:684:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:a  daily  average,  when  we  condition  on  individuals  who  reported  positive  search  time.   We
56:1665:117644:25:25:81:529:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:believe  that  this  is  likely  because  of  both  measurement  differences  between  the  surveys  and
56:1666:117748:25:25:81:529:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  nature  of  search.   Aside  from  the  obvious  difference  between  the  ATUS  and  SCE  data
56:1667:117848:25:25:81:529:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that  the  former  measures  search  for  a  single  day  and  the  SCE  over  one  week,  the  ATUS
56:1668:117948:25:25:81:529:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:time diary also likely understates the time spent searching for work because individuals only
56:1669:118041:25:25:81:529:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:report their primary activity in the diary.  Thus,  if an individual is literally searching while
56:1670:118138:25:25:81:529:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on the job, it will likely show up as work time rather than search time.  The daily data also
56:1671:118231:25:25:81:529:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:likely understate search effort because, as the comparison of the two surveys suggests, search
56:1672:118325:25:25:81:529:484:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:effort is discrete and intermittent.  The daily data imply that only 0.5 percent of the employed
56:1673:118421:25:24:81:529:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:reported any time spent searching on a given day, yet we find that 20.5 percent of the employed
56:1674:118516:24:25:81:529:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:reported searching within the last seven days, and in Table 2 of the main text, we find that
56:1675:118608:25:25:81:529:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:23.3 percent of the employed report actively searching within the past four weeks.  Even among
56:1676:118702:25:25:81:529:385:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the  unemployed,  who  are  defined  as  actively  looking  for  work,  the  ATUS  estimates  suggest
56:1677:118803:25:25:81:529:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that only 20.2 percent looked for work on the previous day, while the SCE estimates suggest
56:1678:118894:25:25:81:529:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that 93.5 percent searched within the last seven days.  If we condition our estimates on those
56:1679:118988:25:25:81:529:310:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:who reported positive search time, and compare the daily average time from the SCE to the
56:1680:119077:25:25:81:529:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:reported daily time spent searching in the ATUS, we get that the SCE estimates suggest lower
56:1681:119169:25:25:81:529:260:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:search effort per day, on average.  Again, this is likely evidence that search is intermittent, with
56:1682:119269:25:25:81:529:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:individuals searching for some time on several days during a week than a set amount each day.
56:1683:119362:25:25:81:529:210:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Consequently, when we couple our evidence from the SCE data with the previous research on
56:1684:119451:25:24:81:529:185:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on-the-job search mentioned in the main text (e.g., Black, 1980; Blau and Robins, 1990), we
56:1685:119542:24:25:81:529:161:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:feel that our estimates of search effort provide a more comprehensive and reliable measure than

57:1691:119967:25:25:81:529:601:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:status in our model calibration because it treats the search effort and offer arrivals reported in
57:1692:120065:25:25:81:436:576:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the survey as subsequent outcomes based on this initial labor force status.
57:1693:120140:25:25:98:529:551:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:This  appendix  details  our  methodology  for  determining  labor  force  status  in  the  prior
57:1694:120237:25:25:81:529:526:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:month and evaluates our measure along several comparable dimensions.  To determine labor
57:1695:120325:25:25:81:529:501:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:force status in the prior month, we first check to see if an individual received an offer in the
57:1696:120421:25:25:81:529:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:four weeks prior to the survey.  If so, we assign them their labor force status at the time they
57:1697:120517:25:25:81:529:451:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:received their job offer (employed or non-employed).  This approach assumes that labor force
57:1698:120609:25:25:81:529:426:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:status did not change between the time they received their job offer and four weeks prior to
57:1699:120701:25:25:81:529:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the labor supplement survey.  We feel that this is a reasonable assumption given the relatively
57:1700:120796:25:24:81:529:376:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:short time interval.  In the 2014 and 2015 waves of the survey, we have additional information
57:1701:120890:24:25:81:529:352:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on whether an individual was actively searching at the time they received their offer.  If so, we
57:1702:120987:25:25:81:529:327:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:count them as unemployed, and if not, we count them as out of the labor force.  For those in
57:1703:121079:25:25:81:529:302:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the 2013 wave, we have to make some modest assumptions to determine whether someone was
57:1704:121166:25:25:81:529:277:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:unemployed or out of the labor force.  If an individual who was non-employed at the time of the
57:1705:121261:25:25:81:529:252:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:job offer was employed at the time of the 2013 labor survey, we assume that they were actively
57:1706:121355:25:25:81:529:227:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:searching and count them as unemployed.  If they were unemployed at the time of the survey
57:1707:121445:25:25:81:529:202:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and have been searching for over four weeks, we also count them as unemployed.  Otherwise,
57:1708:121535:25:25:81:382:177:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we count them as out of the labor force in the previous month.
57:1709:121597:25:25:98:529:152:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:For  the  remaining  individuals  (who  are  the  vast  majority  of  respondents),  we  determine

57:1711:121791:25:24:81:529:102:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:survey.  If an individual did not receive a job offer in the last four weeks but was employed
57:1712:121884:24:0:81:529:78:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:at the  time of the  survey,  we determine  their prior month’s  labor  force status as  follows:  if
58:1713:121987:0:25:81:529:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:they report that their current job tenure is at least one month, or if they report tenure of less
58:1714:122084:25:25:81:529:684:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:than a month but with less than two weeks between jobs, we count them as employed in the
58:1715:122172:25:25:81:529:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:previous month.  Otherwise, we assume that these individuals were actively searching for work
58:1716:122265:25:25:81:342:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and count them as unemployed in the previous month.
58:1717:122316:25:25:98:529:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:If an individual was unemployed at the time of the survey and did not receive an offer in the
58:1718:122409:25:25:81:529:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:last four weeks, we count them as employed in the previous month if they were on temporary
58:1719:122499:25:25:81:529:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:layoff  for  less  than  one  month  or  if  their  current  non-employment  spell  was  one  month  or
58:1720:122602:25:25:81:529:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:less.  We count them as unemployed in the prior month if they were on temporary layoff for
58:1721:122692:25:25:81:529:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:more than one month or if they report actively searching for work for more than one month.
58:1722:122782:25:25:81:328:484:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Otherwise, we count them as out of the labor force.
58:1723:122833:25:24:98:529:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Finally,  if  an  individual  was  out  of  the  labor  force  at  the  time  of  the  survey  and  did
58:1724:122936:24:25:81:529:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:not receive an offer in the last four weeks,  we count them as employed if their current non-
58:1725:123029:25:25:81:529:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employment spell is one month or less.  We count them as unemployed if they report actively
58:1726:123120:25:25:81:529:385:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:searching for more than one month and they are not currently disabled.  Otherwise, we count
58:1727:123211:25:25:81:227:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:them as out of the labor force.
58:1728:123242:25:25:98:529:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Evaluation of this approach suggests that our methodology produces a sensible measure of
58:1729:123330:25:25:81:529:310:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the prior month’s labor force status along several dimensions.  First, our estimates imply an
58:1730:123423:25:25:81:529:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employment-to-population ratio of 0.750,  an unemployment rate of 6.3 percent,  and a labor
58:1731:123514:25:25:81:529:260:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:force participation rate of 80.0 percent.  All are roughly comparable to the CPS estimates and
58:1732:123608:25:25:81:529:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the SCE labor supplement estimates (using the BLS definition of unemployment) in Table 1
58:1733:123696:25:25:81:529:210:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of  the  main  text.   The  unemployment  rate  in  the  previous  month  is  likely  somewhat  higher
58:1734:123798:25:24:81:529:185:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:because of our assumption that all those who became employed during the month but did not
58:1735:123887:24:25:81:308:161:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:report a job offer were unemployed when hired.
58:1736:123933:25:25:98:529:136:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Second, Table B1 reports labor force transition rates for two data sources.  The first source
58:1737:124026:25:25:81:529:111:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:is the SCE labor supplement, which estimates the transition rates using our measure of labor
58:1738:124118:25:0:81:529:86:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:force status in the prior month and labor force status at the time of survey (using the CPS
59:1739:124211:0:25:81:529:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:definition described in Appendix A). The second source is the monthly CPS, which measures
59:1740:124300:25:25:81:529:684:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the transition rates between September and October of each year (2013-15) for individuals in
59:1741:124392:25:25:81:529:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the survey during both months.  The transition rates for the SCE are generally very comparable
59:1742:124486:25:25:81:529:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to the transition rates for the CPS. The job-separation rates into unemployment and out of
59:1743:124576:25:25:81:529:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the labor force are nearly identical.  The SCE labor supplement has a slightly lower job-finding
59:1744:124672:25:25:81:529:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rate of the unemployed and a notably lower job-finding rate for those out of the labor force.
59:1745:124765:25:25:81:529:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Transitions between unemployment and being out of the labor force are roughly comparable
59:1746:124853:25:24:81:201:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:between the two surveys.

59:1761:125472:12:12:81:511:254:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:2013-15.  It uses the methodology described in the appendix to determine the previous months’ labor force
59:1762:125577:12:12:81:506:242:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:status and uses the CPS definition of unemployment for labor force status at the time of the survey.  The
59:1763:125682:12:12:81:525:230:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:bottom panel reports the labor force transition rates from the CPS using data matched across September and
59:1764:125788:12:39:81:160:218:9:g_d0_f8:9:g_d0_f8:F:October of 2013-15.

59:1766:125872:32:25:81:529:147:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Another way to test the validity of our estimates of labor force status in the prior month is
59:1767:125965:25:25:81:529:122:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to  compare  it  to  results  based  on  labor  force  status  for  individuals  in  the  regular,  monthly
59:1768:126072:25:25:81:529:97:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:SCE for the previous month.  The monthly SCE data’s measure of labor force status in the
59:1769:126160:25:0:81:529:72:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:previous month is generally not consistent with the timing of the SCE labor supplement because
60:1770:126256:0:25:81:529:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:individuals  may  respond  to  the  labor  supplement  anywhere  from  a  few  days  to  nearly  two
60:1771:126356:25:25:81:529:684:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:months after their most recent monthly SCE interview.  To deal with this, we assign a prior
60:1772:126447:25:25:81:529:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:month’s labor force status to individuals in the labor supplement based on the timing between
60:1773:126540:25:25:81:529:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the supplement and their September SCE interview.  If the gap between interviews is 22 days
60:1774:126631:25:25:81:529:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:or  more,  we  use  their  September  labor  force  status.   If  the  gap  is  21  days  or  less,  or  if  the
60:1775:126743:25:25:81:405:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:September data are missing, we use their August labor force status.
60:1776:126810:25:25:98:529:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Table B2 replicates the bottom panels of Tables 3 and 4 of the main text using the prior
60:1777:126898:25:25:81:529:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:month’s labor force status measure derived from the monthly SCE data.  The table shows that
60:1778:126989:25:25:81:529:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the estimates are very similar to those estimated using our prior month’s labor force status
60:1779:127081:25:25:81:529:484:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:measure derived from the labor supplement.  Some minor exceptions exist for the unemployed.
60:1780:127172:25:24:81:529:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:For  example,  their  application  and  offer  rates  are  somewhat  lower  using  the  monthly  SCE

60:1782:127372:25:25:81:529:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:identical estimates of search effort and search outcomes.  Note that we adjusted all estimates

60:1784:127555:25:25:81:529:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:or September and the interview of the SCE supplement in October, so all estimates of search
60:1785:127646:25:0:81:302:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:outcomes can be interpreted as monthly rates.

64:1897:133714:25:25:81:529:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:text.  Table C1 shows that search effort is practically unchanged regardless of the measure used

64:1899:133905:25:25:81:529:484:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to the unemployed, ignoring search for additional work (our preferred measure of relative effort
64:1900:134001:25:24:81:354:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for our model calibration) falls slightly from 0.91 to 0.86.
64:1901:134061:24:25:98:529:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Tables C2 and C3 show that search outcomes and acceptance rates also change little after
64:1902:134149:25:25:81:529:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:controlling for observables.  If we ignore the effects of censoring of the wage offer distribution,
64:1903:134248:25:25:81:529:385:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we can infer the relative search efficiency of the employed to the unemployed directly from the

64:1905:134429:25:25:81:529:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:suggests that relative efficiency measured this way is about 2.2 (compared to nearly three in

64:1907:134614:25:25:81:455:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:suggest that the relative efficiency under this method is slightly higher, at 2.5.

72:2142:148810:25:25:81:529:684:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of the labor force. In Table 10 of the main text, we report the results of including two versions of
72:2143:148910:25:25:81:529:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:these controls, in addition to the controls for observable worker and job characteristics reported
72:2144:149008:25:25:81:529:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in Table 7.  We use two versions of work history.  The first version controls for employment
72:2145:149100:25:25:81:529:609:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:history by adding the fraction of the last five years spent employed to the existing controls for
72:2146:149197:25:25:81:529:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:observables.  The first column of Table 10 shows that this reduces the estimated (log) wage
72:2147:149288:25:25:81:529:559:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:offer gap between the employed and non-employed from 0.250 to 0.222.  The second version
72:2148:149376:25:25:81:529:534:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:controls for labor force history by additionally adding the fraction of the last five years spent
72:2149:149473:25:25:81:529:509:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:as either unemployed or as a student (with the share spent otherwise out of the labor force as
72:2150:149567:25:25:81:524:484:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the excluded category).  Table 10 shows that this further reduces the estimated gap to 0.205.
72:2151:149660:25:24:98:529:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:We can simulate our model to generate what our calibration implies about how the controls
72:2152:149749:24:25:81:529:435:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for work history should affect our estimated wage gap.  To this end, we simulated data from the
72:2153:149844:25:25:81:529:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:model and then performed the same regressions as in the data.  The second column of Table
72:2154:149933:25:25:81:529:385:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:10 reports our simulation results.  The model is calibrated to match the estimated wage offer
72:2155:150026:25:25:81:529:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:gap controlling for observables only by construction.  The simulation suggests that controlling
72:2156:150121:25:25:81:529:335:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for work history should reduce the gap from 0.25 to 0.21 if we only control for the time spent
72:2157:150215:25:25:81:529:310:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:employed over the last five years.  The model-implied gaps are very similar to the gaps that
72:2158:150307:25:25:81:529:285:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:we  estimate  from  the  data.   As  discussed  in  the  text,  the  similarity  of  results  is  remarkable
72:2159:150415:25:25:81:529:260:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:as  the  model  calibration  exploits  an  independent  source  of  variation  in  prior  wages  rather
72:2160:150518:25:25:81:529:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:than employment histories.  This, thus, suggests that the question about five-year employment
72:2161:150611:25:25:81:529:210:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:history captures well the unobserved heterogeneity that is relevant for the empirically observed
72:2162:150707:25:0:81:178:185:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:wage offer premium.
