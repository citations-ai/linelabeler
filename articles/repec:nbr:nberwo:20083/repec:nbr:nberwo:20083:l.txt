2:39:2356:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:When faced with a run on a “systemically important” but insolvent bank in 1889, the Banque de France
2:40:2456:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:pre-emptively organized a lifeboat to ensure that depositors were protected and an orderly liquidation
2:41:2558:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:could proceed.  To protect the Banque from losses on its lifeboat loan, a guarantee syndicate was formed,
2:42:2663:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:penalizing those who had participated in the copper speculation that had caused the crisis bringing
2:43:2762:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:the bank down.  Creation of the syndicate and other actions were consistent with mitigating the moral
2:44:2863:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:hazard from such an intervention. This episode contrasts the advice given by Bagehot to the Bank
2:45:2959:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:of England to counter a panic by lending freely at a high rate on good collateral, allowing insolvent
2:46:3060:14:42:72:160:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:F:institutions to fail.

3:68:3607:13:38:90:176:695:144:Times:144:Times:C:1. Introduction 
3:69:3622:38:28:108:543:657:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:In  this  paper,  we  recover  the  history  of  the  Crisis  of  1889,  when  the  Banque  de  France  
3:70:3726:28:27:72:544:629:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:(BdF)  quickly  intervened,  ensuring  that  a  run  on  the  Comptoir  d’Escompte  (CdE),  one  of  the  
3:71:3832:27:28:72:543:602:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:largest banks in France, did not turn into a general panic.  The remedy for this banking crisis, the 
3:72:3933:28:27:71:543:574:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:most severe in late nineteenth century France, was not a pure British Bagehot-style lender of last 
3:73:4032:27:28:72:544:547:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:resort  operation  (LOLR)  but  a  divisive  and  contested  intervention,  resembling  more  a  modern  
3:74:4137:28:27:72:546:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:“lifeboat”  or  “bailout”  operation,  supplemented  by  additional  liquidity  for  the  market.      By  
3:75:4244:27:28:72:543:492:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:providing loans to the insolvent CdE, the BdF guaranteed that depositors would have continued 
3:76:4338:28:28:72:543:464:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:access to their accounts while the bank was liquidated in an orderly fashion and a new bank was 
3:77:4434:28:27:72:543:436:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:formed and capitalized.  Similar modern interventions, such as the rescues of Long Term Capital 
3:78:4530:27:28:72:543:409:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Management in 1998 or Bear Stearns in 2008, have led critics to complain that central banks that 
3:79:4627:28:28:72:547:381:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:deviate  from  Bagehot’s  rule  create  moral  hazard,  inducing  greater  losses  in  subsequent  crises.    
3:80:4737:28:27:72:544:353:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Yet,  in  contrast  to  the  modern  experience  with  lifeboats  the  BdF  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  
3:81:4847:27:28:72:545:326:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:backed  by  the  contemporary  French  legal  system,  took  prompt  actions  in  1889  that  had  the  
3:82:4951:28:27:72:544:298:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:potential  to  mitigate  this  problem.    Banks,  including  their  management  and  directors,  that  had  
3:83:5060:27:28:72:544:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:contributed to the debacle were quickly compelled to absorb losses arising from the collapse of 
3:84:5156:28:28:72:544:243:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the  CdE;  many  officials  were  purged;  and  other  penalties  imposed.    This  strong  response  may  
3:85:5263:28:27:72:486:215:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:have contributed to the absence of major crisis in France for the next quarter century.  
3:86:5352:27:28:108:543:188:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:This type of central bank intervention would appear to be ruled out in the U.S. today.  In 
3:87:5443:28:27:72:540:160:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:reaction to the Federal Reserve’s lending programs during the financial crisis of 2008, the Dodd-
3:88:5540:27:28:72:543:133:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Frank Act of 2010 altered Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act that had, since 1932, given 
3:89:5635:28:28:72:542:105:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the Fed discretionary authority to lend to “any individual partnership, or corporation” in “unusual 
3:90:5735:28:0:72:544:77:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and  exigent  circumstances.”    The  Fed  used  this  authority  beginning  with  the  Great  Depression  
4:91:5845:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:through the Crisis of 2008 (Fettig, 2008), though there were long-standing complaints that it had 
4:92:5943:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:been misused (Schwartz, 1992; Goodfriend, 2012).  Emergency assistance in Section 13(3) now 
4:93:6035:28:27:72:547:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:requires  that  the  Board  of  Governors  consult  with  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury,  before  
4:94:6137:27:28:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:implementing a new lending program, which should provide liquidity to the financial system, not 
4:95:6233:28:28:72:546:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:aid  an  insolvent  or  failing  firm  and  be  collateralized  sufficiently  to  protect  taxpayers  (U.S.  
4:96:6342:28:27:72:543:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Senate, 2010; Office of Inspector General, 2010).  While this policy shift implies that there is no 
4:97:6442:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:case to be made for pre-emptive intervention with insolvent firms, the French experience in 1889 
4:98:6539:28:27:72:193:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:may suggest otherwise.   
4:99:6564:27:28:108:543:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:After reviewing the extant literature, we describe the origins of the crisis, arising from an 
4:100:6658:28:28:72:543:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:effort to control the world copper market and measure the damage inflicted on the CdE.  In the 
4:101:6753:28:27:72:542:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:third section, we examine whether the run on the bank had begun to spread before the authorities 
4:102:6850:27:28:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:intervened and detail the debate at the BdF and Ministry of Finance over the plan to rescue the 
4:103:6946:28:27:72:543:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:CdE.  Next, we show that the BdF’s intervention was primarily a lifeboat operation with modest 
4:104:7041:27:28:72:544:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:extra liquidity supplied to other banks and the markets.  Fifthly, we analyze the determinants of 
4:105:7139:28:27:72:544:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:membership in and contributions to the guarantee syndicate, intended to absorb losses from the 
4:106:7234:27:28:72:543:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:lifeboat operation, finding that, in addition to capacity to pay, responsibility for the debacle was 
4:107:7335:28:28:72:543:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:an important factor.   In the final section, we discuss the penalties imposed in the aftermath of the 
4:108:7437:28:37:71:463:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:crisis that may have minimized the moral hazard arising from the BdF’s actions.

5:115:8035:27:28:72:545:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Bagehot  (1873).    They  ordained  that  a  central  bank  should  respond  to  a  financial  crisis  by

5:117:8246:27:28:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:banks from failing.  Summarizing this view, Humphrey (1975) and Bordo (1990) point out that it 
5:118:8341:28:28:72:544:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:was  not  the  duty  of  the  LOLR  to  prevent  financial  shocks  but  neutralize  them  once  they  had

5:124:8874:28:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the bank rate above the market rate, providing loans to all that had good collateral, as determined 
5:125:8974:27:28:72:544:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:by  the  Bank’s  meticulous  bookkeeping  (Bignon,  Flandreau,  and  Ugolini,  2012;  Flandreau  and

5:128:9298:28:27:72:543:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:not simply follow Bagehot’s advice in the late nineteenth century.  Unfortunately, the secondary 
5:129:9395:27:28:72:544:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:literature  on  the  BoE  has  paid  little  attention  to  the  lifeboat  operation  during  the  1890  Barings

5:132:9718:27:28:72:548:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:suggesting that support for the CdE in 1889 was a model for the BoE’s action the following year.

6:138:10270:28:28:71:544:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:establishment  of  the  Fed.    Two  volumes  treat  the  BdF;  yet,  the  first  (Liesse,1909)  gives  only  a  
6:139:10383:28:27:71:544:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:cursory  description  of  the  1889  rescue  and  the  second  (Patron,  1910)  omits  it  entirely,  which  
6:140:10492:27:28:71:543:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:may have led modern authorities on central banking (Goodhart, 1988; Grossman, 2010) to offer 
6:141:10585:28:27:71:543:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:only brief comments on the 1889 episode.  Direct evidence on the BdF as a LOLR is found in the 
6:142:10680:27:28:71:543:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Commission’s interview with the Governor of the BdF, Georges Pallain, conducted by Benjamin

6:146:11066:28:14:107:507:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:There is no fixed rule, and although the balance of the account is not a matter of

8:205:16472:28:27:71:173:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:to £40 a ton in 1886. 
8:206:16494:27:28:107:543:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:In  September  1887,  Secrétan  organized  a  syndicate  composed  primarily  of  members  of  
8:207:16589:28:27:71:544:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the haute  banque  to  provide  credit  to  purchase  existing  stocks  of  copper.    Purchases  drove  up  
8:208:16698:27:28:71:542:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:prices from £40 per ton to over £80 by December 1887.  As seen in Figure 1, British and French 
8:209:16793:28:28:71:544:129:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:copper  stocks  began  to  rise.    If  support  for  Secrétan’s  scheme  had  remained  within  a  circle  of  
8:210:16905:28:0:71:543:101:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:metals companies, wealthy investors and private investment banks, there would have been large 
9:211:17002:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:losses if the price crashed, but it is unlikely there would have been a banking crisis.  However, 
9:212:17100:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Secrétan began to draw upon the support of the commercial banks.   Their aid was essential, as 
9:213:17195:28:27:72:543:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the modest capital of the SdM did not provide a credible guarantee to buy the copper when the 
9:214:17289:27:28:72:439:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:futures contracts fell due; hence, guarantees from the banks were necessary.

10:263:19591:28:28:72:545:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:have  led  some  compromised  regents  and  auditors  to  remain  silent,  buying  shares  in  mining

11:278:21028:28:27:71:543:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:appeal  by  Georges  Girod,  a  director  of  both  the  SdM  and  the  CdE  (Banque  de  France,  Conseil

11:285:21675:28:27:71:543:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:As  evident  in  Figure  2,  the  public  did  not  perceive  that  there  was  any  danger  to  the  banks.  All

12:312:23522:28:28:72:543:153:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Joubert and Girod about the warrants.  The following day, the Governor reported that quality of

13:327:24154:28:27:71:543:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:results of his meeting with Denfert-Rochereau, showing that the CdE had sustained huge losses. 
13:328:24249:27:28:71:543:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:It  was  a  rude  shock.  The  BdF  was  owed  78.8  million  francs  by  the  CdE.    Then,  on  March  5,

13:337:25141:28:27:72:542:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the CdE was liable for the SdM’s copper warrants that were discounted at the BdF because it had 
13:338:25237:27:28:72:543:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:given a guaranteeing signature. This obligation is shown on line 2; so that the total obligation of

13:340:25432:27:28:71:543:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:liabilities and capital of the SdM, 276.3 million. From this sum, the credits from the Compagnie

13:342:25625:28:27:71:543:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:debt of the SdM to outside creditors was thus 224.6 million francs, as seen on line 6.  The 96.2 
13:343:25722:27:28:71:544:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:million  francs  due  to  the  CdE  represented  43%  of  this  total,  shown  on  line  7.    Against  these  
13:344:25833:28:27:71:543:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:liabilities, the SdM had 154,900 tons of copper (line 8), which if valued at the March 1st price of

13:346:26048:28:28:71:544:129:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:CdE’s share of this collateral is the same as its share in SdM’s debts (an optimistic hypothesis), 
13:347:26147:28:0:71:541:101:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the CdE’s share of these assets would be 66.9 million francs on line 10. Then the loss to the CdE

15:392:27896:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:at  approximately  £70  per  ton  for  the  SdM  of  the  delivery  of  large  quantities  of  copper  in  1889

15:402:28882:27:28:71:544:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:would  give  it  assets  of  136  million  francs,  shown  on  line  9.  The  CdE’s  share  of  these  assets  
15:403:28993:28:27:71:544:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:would  be  61.5  million  francs  on  line  10  (again  assuming  its  credits  are  as  well  secured  as  the

15:412:29901:28:28:71:543:129:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:from the liquidateurs was much worse, as seen in Panel C. Credits of the CdE to the SdM were 
15:413:29994:28:0:71:544:101:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:higher  on  lines  1  and  2,  146.5  million  francs.    The  collateral  of  the  CdE  credits,  on  line  9a,  
16:414:30112:0:27:72:544:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:valued  at  £40  in  line  9,  implied  a  direct  loss  on  line  11  of  78.7  million,  to  which  another  2.9  
16:415:30228:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:million losses should be added (line 11a) for a total direct loss of 81.6 million (line 11b)---which 
16:416:30329:28:27:71:543:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:alone would wipe out the CdE’s 80 million francs of capital. If the guarantees from line 15 are 
16:417:30425:27:28:71:543:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:added, the total direct and indirect losses would reach 197.5 million francs on line 16 for Panel 
16:418:30523:28:28:72:544:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:C.  The  CdE’s  credits  to  the  SdM  of  this  last  panel  seem  to  be  in  line  with  the  estimates  of  the  
16:419:30640:28:27:72:547:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:auditor  appointed  by  the  court  hearing  lawsuits  following  the  crisis.  According  to  these  
16:420:30742:27:28:72:549:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:estimates,  the  CdE’s  credits  to  the  SdM  on  December  31,  1888  were  172.2  million  francs.    
16:421:30847:28:27:72:544:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Noting  that  the  SdM’s  position  vis-à-vis  the  CdE  did  not  change  significantly  in  the  first  three  
16:422:30960:27:28:72:387:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:months of 1889, the auditor relied on the liquidators’ estimates5.  
16:423:31028:28:28:108:542:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Consequently, in most optimistic case, the CdE needed the guarantees to be abandoned in 
16:424:31116:28:27:72:545:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:order  to  survive;  in  the  second  one  it  had  to  be  liquidated  even  if  the  guarantees  were  to  be  
16:425:31229:27:28:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:abandoned;  in  the  third  and  more  likely  case,  it  was  deeply  insolvent.    Depositors  rightly  fled,  
16:426:31342:28:37:72:320:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:when knowledge of this situation become public. .

16:428:31422:38:28:108:544:302:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:On  the  evening  of  March  7,  1889  following  two  days  of  steady  withdrawals  of  deposits  
16:429:31522:28:27:72:545:274:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and  a  failed  private  attempt  to  raise  support  for  the  CdE,  the  Minister  of  Finance,  Maurice  
16:430:31630:27:28:72:544:247:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Rouvier,  summoned  the  Governor  and  leading  bankers  to  his  office.6    Although  there  are  no  
16:431:31735:28:27:72:544:219:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:records  of  this  late  night  meeting,  it  was  certainly  tense,  lasting  from  10  p.m.  to  2  a.m.  The  
16:432:31848:27:28:72:545:192:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Minister  was  blunt:  if  the  CdE  did  not  receive  100  million  francs  before  opening,  the  rising  
16:433:31957:28:28:72:543:164:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:number of withdrawals would force it to stop payments. The Minister expected the BdF to lend 
16:434:32050:28:27:72:544:136:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:100  million  francs,  with  the  CdE’s  entire  assets  serving  as  a  guarantee.    This  request  was  in

17:439:32490:0:27:72:544:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:violation  of  the  statutes  of  the  BdF,  which  required  that  discounts  only  be  provided  for  three

17:441:32712:28:27:71:545:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:BdF  against  potential  losses,  the  Minister  required  the  formation  of  a  syndicate  of  banks  to  
17:442:32820:27:28:71:279:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:absorb any losses up to 20 million francs.   
17:443:32865:28:28:107:543:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:At 9 a.m. the following morning, Friday, March 8, 1889, an hour before banks opened for 
17:444:32953:28:27:71:543:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:business, the Governor convened an extraordinary meeting of the regents7   He read a letter from 
17:445:33050:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the  Minister  who  insisted  they  act.    An  influential  regent,  Frédéric  de  Pillet-Will  interrupted  to  
17:446:33164:28:27:72:543:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:ask what collateral would be provided.  The Governor responded that it would be notes issued by 
17:447:33260:27:28:72:543:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Secrétan on the SdM and endorsed by the CdE, revealing it was dubious collateral not permitted 
17:448:33355:28:28:72:544:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:by  the  BdF’s  statutes.    To  justify  this  extraordinary  exception,  Magnin  argued  that  the  bank’s  
17:449:33465:28:27:72:541:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:failure would be a terrible blow to the French economy.  The minutes summarized his argument:  
17:450:33560:27:14:108:508:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:There  is  no  doubt  that  this  imposes  a  heavy  obligation  on  the  Banque,  but  M.  le  
17:451:33656:14:14:108:509:391:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Gouverneur  hopes  that  the  good  faith  shown  to  the  Comptoir  would  ease  that  
17:452:33744:14:14:108:509:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:responsibility  and  that  the  Banque  would  be  rewarded  for  its  self-sacrifice  and  
17:453:33836:14:13:108:507:363:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:confidence.  He chose the word good faith because a moral guarantee [underlined 
17:454:33916:13:14:108:510:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:in  the  minutes]  is,  perhaps,  what  is  required.    A  standard  approach  is  not  
17:455:34005:14:14:108:508:336:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:sufficient.    If  the  Banque  agrees  to  come  to  the  aid  of  the  Comptoir  under  these  
17:456:34102:14:14:108:509:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:conditions,  it  will  have  rendered  a  great  new  service  to  the  Parisian  financial  
17:457:34195:14:13:108:322:308:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:market, business in general, and the nation.8

17:459:34240:14:28:72:543:281:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Following this declaration to aid an insolvent institution, the Governor faced hostile questioning 
17:460:34339:28:27:72:273:253:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:rarely seen in the minutes of the Council. 
17:461:34382:27:28:108:543:226:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:The industrialist Fernand Raoul-Duval observed that some of the guarantors for the BdF 
17:462:34469:28:28:72:543:198:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:loan were “notoriously involved in the copper syndicate” and asked whether there was reason to 
17:463:34564:28:27:72:544:170:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:fear that the collateral was inadequate.  This question was inflammatory, given that some of the 
17:464:34661:27:23:72:543:143:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:signatories were regents’ banks.   One  target,  André,  responded  simply  that  the  guarantees  were

18:470:35080:0:27:72:544:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:sufficient.   Next, Pillet-Will spoke of the great risk to which the BdF would be exposed by this 
18:471:35178:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:credit and pointed out that even if the CE’s assets were acceptable as collateral, their transfer to 
18:472:35279:28:27:72:544:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the  BdF  might  be  contested  by  other  creditors.      He  estimated  that  a  guarantee  of  75  not  20  
18:473:35390:27:28:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:million francs was necessary.  André countered that it was impossible to follow the rules; the key 
18:474:35489:28:28:72:543:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:was to stop the panic.  Opponents of the Minister’s proposal demanded further assurances for the 
18:475:35586:28:27:72:544:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:BdF,  but  supporters  argued  that  there  was  no  time  left.  When  the  proposal  was  put  to  a  vote,  
18:476:35697:27:28:72:545:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:eleven  regents  voted  for  and  four  against,  barely  reaching  the  required  super  majority  for  the  
18:477:35807:28:27:72:544:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:motion  to  pass.    The  defeated  regents  were  enraged.      Pillet-Will  felt  that  he  and  the  BdF  had  
18:478:35921:27:28:72:545:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:been  betrayed  by  the  insiders---including  Rothschild.  In  an  act  without  precedence  since  the  
18:479:36027:28:28:72:544:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:founding  the  Banque,  Pillet-Will  resigned  in  protest:  after  three  generations,  his  family;s  bank  
18:480:36137:28:27:72:380:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:now no longer had a representative on the Council of Regents..  
18:481:36201:27:28:108:542:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:The CdE quickly drew on its loan to meet the demands of depositors, taking 94 of the 100 
18:482:36290:28:27:72:544:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:million  francs  by  March  15.  1889.9    Even  though  it  was  initially  believed  that  the  CdE  had  
18:483:36398:27:28:72:546:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:sufficient  good  assets  to  cover  any  liabilities  beyond  the  100  million  franc  loan,  it  became  
18:484:36506:28:27:72:545:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:obvious  there  was  a  gaping  hole  in  its  balance  sheet.    On  Saturday,  March  16,  1888,  the  
18:485:36611:27:28:72:545:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Governor  and  representatives  of  the  leading  banks  were  again  summoned  to  a  meeting  at  the  
18:486:36716:28:28:72:544:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Ministry of Finance.  The bankers were informed that the Minister wanted the creation of a new 
18:487:36811:28:27:72:543:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:institution to replace the CdE and that a new 40 million francs loan from the BdF was required to 
18:488:36909:27:28:72:543:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:prevent the CdE bank from collapsing.  For this credit, there would be a new guarantee syndicate 
18:489:37006:28:27:72:543:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:of  banks  to  cover  the  first  20  million  francs  of  losses.10  Another  extraordinary  meeting  of  the

19:494:37473:0:27:72:544:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:of  Regents  voted  13  to  2  to  give  an  additional  loan  of  40  million  francs.11  These  funds  were  
19:495:37584:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:immediately  drawn  upon  by  the  CdE  and  the  run  abated,  as  the  Ministry  and  the  BdF  signaled  
19:496:37692:28:27:72:543:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:their commitment to depositors.  With threat of a panic having receded, an orderly liquidation of 
19:497:37790:27:28:72:327:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the CdE could proceed without a fire sale of assets.   
19:498:37845:28:28:108:543:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:The question whether the BdF’s quick intervention prevented a panic presents a difficult 
19:499:37934:28:27:72:543:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:counterfactual that runs would have been limited to the CdE because the public could determine 
19:500:38029:27:28:72:547:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:whether  other  banks  were  solvent.    But,  to  use  an  anachronistic  term,  the  CdE  was  a  
19:501:38129:28:27:72:542:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:“systemically important financial institution” and neither the Minister of Finance nor most of the

22:598:44221:28:28:72:545:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:leaked  out  and  the  CdE  shares’  prices  begin  to  tumble,  with  an  11.3%  drop.    His  suicide  on  
22:599:44330:28:27:72:542:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:March 5 brought a further decline.  Extraordinary meetings at the Ministry on the night of March 
22:600:44427:27:28:71:543:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:7  and  before  the  banks  opened  on  March  8  saw  drops  of  29.1%  for  the  CdE  and  8.6%  for  the  
22:601:44536:28:27:71:543:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:PBBP.  The 100 million francs lifeboat calmed the markets.  The insufficiency of this credit then 
22:602:44634:27:28:71:544:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:led to drops for the CdE and smaller declines for the BPPB.  The March 18th 40 million francs 
22:603:44728:28:27:71:544:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:loan  seems  to  have  steadied  the  market  for  bank  stocks  with  the  exception  of  the  CdE,  which  
22:604:44837:27:28:71:545:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:continued  to  fluctuate  with  news  of  its  liabilities  and  plans  to  recapitalize  the  bank.    While  
22:605:44948:28:28:71:544:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:certainly not conclusive evidence of a potential panic, these returns reveal why French officials 
22:606:45046:28:37:71:413:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:would have considered one imminent if drastic actions were not taken.

22:608:45173:38:28:107:543:164:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Although the BdF created a lifeboat to preserve the CdE, there may also have been a need 
22:609:45262:28:27:72:545:136:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:to  make  liquidity  generally  available  to  the  market.    However,  it  appears  to  have  played  a  
22:610:45369:27:28:72:543:109:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:supporting rather than a dominant role in halting a panic.   Bignon, Flandreau and Ugolini (2012) 
22:611:45467:28:0:72:543:81:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:show that the hallmark of the BoE’s LOLR actions à la Bagehot were to keep the discount rate 
23:612:45564:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:above  the  market  rate,  lending  freely  to  all  who  had  acceptable  collateral.      White  (2007)  also  
23:613:45677:27:28:72:544:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:provides  graphical  evidence  that  the  BdF  followed  a  similar  discount  policy.15    To  measure  the  
23:614:45787:28:27:72:543:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:1889 policy mix of lifeboat and additional liquidity requires a determination of the discounts that 
23:615:45887:27:28:72:544:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:exceeded  any  increase  driven  by  interest  rates,  clearing  and  settlement  on  the  Bourse,  or  other

23:621:46427:28:28:72:542:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:huge gold reserves did not feel it necessary to respond to every BoE discount rate change.  When 
23:622:46524:28:27:71:543:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the BoE raised its rate from 2.5 to 3% in July 1888 and then 4% in August, the BdF responded 
23:623:46617:27:28:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:with a lag, increasing its discount rate from 2.5 to 3.5% on September 13.  Falling gold reserves 
23:624:46715:28:27:72:549:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:prompted   the   regents   increase   their   rate   to   4.5%   on   October   4   after   the   next   BoE

23:626:46921:28:27:72:542:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:in early 1889.  On January 10, 1889, the regents cut the discount rate to 4%, following the BoE’s 
23:627:47019:27:48:72:543:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:drop to 4%.20  Then in quick order, shadowing the London rate, the BdF lowered its rate to 3.5%

23:629:47175:8:16:72:543:239:42:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:15  The  BdF  conducted  monetary  policy  by  providing  discounts  and  advances.    During  the  years  1888  and  1889,  
23:630:47300:16:11:72:543:223:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:advances were almost steady at 130 million francs with a standard deviation of 4.5 million, whereas the mean and 
23:631:47413:11:7:72:379:212:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:standard deviation for discounts were 313 million and 89.5 million francs.  .

25:679:50464:28:27:71:543:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and  entailing  counterparty  risk.    A  quick  drop  in  securities  prices  could  lead  to  a  scramble  for  
25:680:50578:27:28:71:543:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:liquidity, as happened spectacularly in 1882.23 There were two settlement periods (liquidations), 
25:681:50676:28:28:71:542:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:one mid-month and the second end-of-month.  Spikes in the volume of discounts in Figures 4 are

25:700:52523:16:11:72:543:85:100:g_d0_f4:100:g_d0_f4:F:of the Lyon Bourse and nearly caused the demise of the Paris Bourse, which was avoided by a lifeboat operation by

26:708:53069:28:27:72:543:541:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B: Equation 1 is estimated using weekly data for two separate periods: (1) August 26, 1871 
26:709:53157:27:28:72:543:514:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:to December 27, 1888 and (2) June 1, 1882 until December 27, 1888.  The shorter second period 
26:710:53251:28:28:72:540:486:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:was  included  to  ensure  that  the  disruptions  caused  by  the  post-Franco-Prussian  War  of  1870-

26:712:53469:27:28:72:544:431:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:observation,  December  27,  was  selected  to  permit  observation  of  any  pre-emptive  increases  in  
26:713:53575:28:27:72:465:403:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:liquidity provided prior to the run on the CdE.  The results are shown in Table 3.  
26:714:53659:27:28:108:546:376:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:For  both  samples,  the  lagged  dependent  variable  and  the  interest  rates  variables  and  
26:715:53757:28:28:72:544:348:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:lagged values all have the expected signs.  It is interesting to note that for the dummy variables 
26:716:53856:28:27:72:544:320:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:that  are  intended  to  capture  the  demand  from  the  Bourse,  the  strongest  effect  is  the  first  day  of  
26:717:53972:27:28:72:543:293:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the  end-of-month  settlement---the  spikes  seen  in  Figure  4.    The  estimates  for  the  longer  period  
26:718:54083:28:27:72:543:265:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:are used to predict the discounts given from January through May 1889.  The predicted discounts 
26:719:54179:27:28:72:544:238:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:at  week  t  are  equal  to  the  actual  lagged  discounts  plus  the  predicted  increase.    The  additional

26:722:54429:27:28:108:543:155:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:During  the  months  of  January  and  February  1889,  there  was  no  anticipatory  increase  in  
26:723:54529:28:27:72:545:127:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:discounts,  as  the  model  over-predicts  the  volume  of  the  discounts.    Nevertheless,  the  model  
26:724:54635:27:0:72:545:100:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:under-predicts  the  increases  in  discounts  for  the  crisis  month  of  March  1889.    There  are  four  
27:725:54749:0:27:72:547:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:weeks---March  14,  21,  and  28  and  April  4---when  there  might  be  considered  additional

27:727:54959:28:27:72:543:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and 23 million francs.  Given the models standard error of 31 million francs for a mean value of 
27:728:55056:27:28:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:330 million francs of discounts, these are not extraordinarily high values.  However, it is notable 
27:729:55156:28:28:72:544:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:that the additional 79 million francs of discounts occurred in the same time frame as the second 
27:730:55253:28:27:72:542:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:40 million francs credit to the CdE.  Additional liquidity given to the market would be consistent 
27:731:55352:27:28:72:542:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:with markets remaining jittery with some bank stock prices taking new hits, as seen in Table 2.

29:829:60302:28:0:72:543:95:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:seem to have been assessed large contributions.  These included small banks, far down the list in

30:831:60509:27:28:72:539:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:were  hit  with  relatively  big  assessments,  for  their  size.    The  deeply  involved  private  bankers---

30:835:60884:28:27:72:542:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:according to ability to pay, as measured by a bank’s capital.  Column 5 in Table 4 examines this 
30:836:60981:27:28:72:547:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:hypothetical   alternative   by   selecting  the  largest  19  banks   and   apportioning   contributions   
30:837:61089:28:27:72:544:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:according to their individual share of their aggregate capital.  Several large banks that were left 
30:838:61189:27:28:72:543:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:out would have been forced to join and a number of smaller banks would have been omitted.  For 
30:839:61284:28:28:72:547:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:banks  remaining  in  the  syndicate,  the  share  allocation  would  have  been  significantly  different.    
30:840:61395:28:27:71:545:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:This  comparison  suggests  that  inclusion  in  the  syndicate  and  the  size  of  contributions  were

30:845:61910:27:28:72:545:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:identify  conflicted  participants,  we  employ  the  1888  subscription  list  to  the  SdM’s  stock  and  
30:846:62018:28:28:72:545:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:bond  issue,  which  provided  the  firm  with  the  means  to  further  the  copper  scheme.        The

33:919:65745:27:28:72:543:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:institutions.  Two measures of centrality or connectedness used in network analysis are deployed 
33:920:65842:28:28:72:543:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:here to measure the conflicts of interest---degree centrality and eigenvector centrality (Borgatti, 
33:921:65942:28:27:72:543:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:2005).  Degree centrality it is the sum of all the edges (an edge is a line representing individuals 
33:922:66043:27:28:72:543:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:who hold two positions) that connect a vertex (a bank) to other vertices (banks).  The number of 
33:923:66140:28:27:72:545:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:lines  or  individuals  connecting  two  institutions  is  taken  as  a  measure  of  the  strength  of  the  
33:924:66250:27:28:72:544:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:conflicted  relationship  between  the  two  institutions.    Degree  centrality  here  is  the  number  of  
33:925:66359:28:28:72:545:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:managers  or  directors  that  a  bank  has  in  common  with  the  CdE  or  the  SdM.    Eigenvector  
33:926:66462:28:27:72:544:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:centrality  emphasizes  that  not  all  connections  are  equal.    The  idea  behind  this  measure  is  that  
33:927:66574:27:28:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:connections to a vertex that are themselves influential or well-connected should give that vertex 
33:928:66672:28:27:72:545:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:more  influence.  Values  for  eigenvector  centrality  are  calculated  from  the  eigenvalues  of  the  
33:929:66778:27:28:72:544:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:adjacency matrix which is an n by n symmetric matrix (n = number of banks) and the elements 
33:930:66870:28:27:72:543:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:are the number of connections between ith and jth banks.  Degree and eigenvector centrality are 
33:931:66966:27:28:72:543:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:calculated  for  connections  with  the  CdE  (DegreeCE  and  EVCE)  and  the  SdM  (DegreeSM  and  
33:932:67066:28:28:72:543:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:EVSM) and thus focus on whether a direct connection for a bank to either institution created an 
33:933:67162:28:27:72:532:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:exploitable conflict of interest that may have used in the formation of the guarantee syndicate.

34:943:68142:28:27:72:546:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:these  securities  were  made  largely  by  individuals  who  had  multiple  affiliations  and  yet  the

39:1112:78886:28:28:72:544:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:shifted losses to mine owners, although these may have been minimal if they had not started to 
39:1113:78981:28:27:72:545:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:mine  the  copper.    Although  the  dismissal  of  its  off-balance  guarantees  could  not  have  been  
39:1114:79087:27:28:72:545:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:foreseen  in  March  1889,  this  development  greatly  improved  the  ability  of  the  CdE  to  pay  its  
39:1115:79195:28:27:72:402:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:creditors with shortfalls covered by penalties and other assessments.

39:1120:79650:28:27:72:542:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:that the BdF would accept ownership of 53,000 tons of copper in exchange for a reduction of the

41:1176:84982:28:27:71:511:219:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:magnified the shocks to the financial system, making the tasks of a LOLR more difficult.    
41:1177:85074:27:28:71:545:192:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:  In  spite  of  the  different  environment  of  the  late  nineteenth  century,  this  pre-emptive  
41:1178:85176:28:28:71:543:164:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:action by the BdF, prompted by the Minister of Finance, is notable. The central bank engineered 
41:1179:85272:28:27:71:542:136:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:a lifeboat to rescue the CdE in 1889 so that it could be liquidated in an orderly fashion and a new 
41:1180:85372:27:28:71:545:109:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:CNEP  could  be  organized.    Backed  by  a  discount  window  that  readily  provided  loans  to  a  
41:1181:85475:28:0:71:543:81:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:troubled market, a general panic was prevented by this lifeboat operation.    The BdF---with no 
42:1182:85575:0:27:72:543:708:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:promise of any funds from the government---offered the insolvent CdE large loans collateralized 
42:1183:85671:27:28:72:543:681:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:by questionable assets.  The central bank was protected from losses by a guarantee syndicate of 
42:1184:85767:28:27:72:544:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:bankers  that  was  coerced  to  give  guarantees  of  40  million  francs  against  losses  the  BdF  might  
42:1185:85877:27:28:72:544:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:sustain.    Court  decisions  nullifying  forward  contracts  and  the  subsequent  rise  in  the  price  of  
42:1186:85987:28:28:72:546:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:copper reduced losses to the CdE made the deployment of the guarantee syndicate unnecessary.  
42:1187:86081:28:27:72:548:570:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Judges   imposed   heavy   payments   of   damages   to   CdE’s   and   SdM’s   board   members.   As   
42:1188:86185:27:28:72:545:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:contemporaries  knew,  the  danger  from  this  intervention  was  that  it  might  encourage  banks  to  
42:1189:86291:28:27:72:544:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:take  bigger  risks  in  the  future  in  the  knowledge  that  the  BdF  would  come  to  their  rescue.    The  
42:1190:86405:27:28:72:543:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:assignment of shares in the guarantee syndicate and the legal system’s punitive responses would 
42:1191:86501:28:28:72:544:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:have  mitigated  the  moral  hazard,  though  the  precise  effects  are  hard  to  measure.    While  one  
42:1192:86609:28:27:72:543:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:cannot easily run a counterfactual, these actions may have contributed to the absence of further
