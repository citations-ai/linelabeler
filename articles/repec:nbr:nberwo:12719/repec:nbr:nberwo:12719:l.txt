2:20:803:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:?:Hooks and Robinson argue that moral hazard induced by deposit insurance induced banks to invest
2:21:898:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:?:in riskier assets in Texas during the 1920s. Their regressions suggest this manifestation of moral hazard
2:22:1003:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:?:may explain a portion of the events that occurred during the 1920s, but some other phenomena, hitherto
2:23:1105:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:?:overlooked, must also be at work. Economic logic and evidence form the archives of the Board of
2:24:1200:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:?:Governors suggest that phenomenon is mismanagement and defalcation by corporate officers, which
2:25:1295:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:?:increases when insurance reduces depositors' incentives to monitor and react to the safety and soundness
2:26:1399:14:28:72:116:504:12:Times:12:Times:?:of banks.

3:34:1521:14:28:122:517:695:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?: An article by Linda Hooks and Kenneth Robinson, “Deposit Insurance and Moral 
3:35:1598:28:27:86:521:667:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:Hazard: Evidence from Texas Banking During the 1920s”contains a contradiction (Hooks 
3:36:1683:27:28:86:479:640:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:and Robinson, 2002). Pondering it reveals an insight which the authors may have 
3:37:1763:28:28:86:149:612:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:overlooked.

3:40:1794:27:28:122:494:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?: Hooks and Robinson examine balance sheet data for banks in Texas. Table 3 
3:41:1868:28:27:86:521:515:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:focuses on state banks during the 1920s and finds “evidence that declines in capitalization 
3:42:1960:27:28:86:522:488:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:led to increases in asset risk, as measured by loan concentrations. Such activity on the part 
3:43:2054:28:27:86:516:460:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:of insured banks would indicate that banks with weakened financial conditions increased 
3:44:2142:27:28:86:526:433:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the riskiness of their asset portfolios, which would be consistent with a moral-hazard effect 
3:45:2236:28:28:86:519:405:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:at work (p. 848).” Table 4 examines two control groups: state banks in 1909, and national 
3:46:2326:28:27:86:505:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:banks during the 1920s. Neither group exhibits correlations between capitalization and 
3:47:2413:27:28:86:521:350:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:loan concentration, suggesting that a difference between the control and treatment groups, 
3:48:2504:28:27:86:523:322:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:one of which was deposit insurance, encouraged poorly capitalized state banks to invest in 
3:49:2595:27:28:86:508:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:assets, such as loans to local farmers and businessmen, with higher expected return and 
3:50:2683:28:28:86:110:267:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:risk. 
3:51:2689:28:27:122:484:239:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?: According to Hooks and Robinson’s regressions in Table 2, however, such 
3:52:2761:27:28:86:490:212:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:behavior did NOT increase the likelihood that banks failed. Banks whose portfolios 
3:53:2844:28:27:86:520:184:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:contained a higher proportion of loans had LOWER failure rates than other banks, all else 
3:54:2934:27:28:86:509:157:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:being equal (see coefficient on the portfolio concentration variable, which measures the 
3:55:3023:28:28:86:511:129:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:ration of loans to assets, LOANASS). The beneficial effect of additional loans was large. 
3:56:3113:28:0:86:517:101:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:An extra $1 of loans reduced the probability of failure to the same extent as an additional 
4:57:3206:0:28:86:483:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:43 cents of retained earnings (-0.140/-0.327) (see Table 2, column 1). The authors 
4:58:3289:28:28:86:494:681:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:acknowledge this result when they write “we expect a positive sign on LOANASS ... 
4:59:3371:28:27:86:521:653:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:However, LOANASS is negative and significant, the opposite of what was hypothesized.”  
4:60:3458:27:28:122:520:626:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?: Their hypothesis rests on the notion that “declines in capitalization can induce ‘go-
4:61:3543:28:27:86:514:598:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:for-broke’ strategies among insured banks. With less of their own funds at risk as capital 
4:62:3634:27:28:86:476:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:declines, insured banks may be tempted to gamble on risky projects with a small 
4:63:3714:28:28:86:503:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:probability of payoff. If these ventures prove successful, the bank gains, otherwise the 
4:64:3803:28:27:86:480:515:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f3:B:insurance fund suffers the losses (p. 844).” The expectation of a “positive sign on 
4:65:3886:27:28:86:514:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f1:B:LOANASS” presumes that investing in loans rather than safer assets, such as government 
4:66:3973:28:27:86:518:460:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:securities and eligible commercial paper, actually resulted in large losses and high failure 
4:67:4066:27:28:86:528:433:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:rates. Table 2’s regressions indicate the opposite. Texas banks benefited from lending more 
4:68:4158:28:28:86:503:405:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:money. Their ex ante gambles yielded ex post profits. This is understandable since the 
4:69:4245:28:27:86:491:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:banks made these loans during the era known as the Roaring 20s, when the national 
4:70:4327:27:28:86:422:350:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:economy prospered, and Texas experienced oil and industrial booms. 
4:71:4394:28:27:122:507:322:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?: Table 2’s regressions contain another variable, INSURED, an indicator for state 
4:72:4474:27:28:86:513:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:banks, all of which had to participate in one of the two Texas deposit insurance systems. 
4:73:4564:28:28:86:511:267:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:The author’s argue that “if moral hazard incentives are present at insured banks, leading 
4:74:4654:28:27:86:490:239:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:them to pursue excessively risky activities, then we would expect a positive sign on 
4:75:4739:27:28:86:512:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f1:B:INSURED (p. 843).” The sign is indeed “positive and significant at the 10-percent level, 
4:76:4828:28:27:86:522:184:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:indicating that deposit insurance significantly increased the likelihood of failure (p. 843).” 
4:77:4923:27:28:122:491:157:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?: This brings us to the contradiction in the essay, and I believe, an overlooked 
4:78:5002:28:28:86:469:129:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:insight. The author’s interpretations of LOANASS and INSURED in Table 2 are 
4:79:5078:28:0:86:512:101:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:inconsistent with their interpretations of Tables 3 and 4. For the latter tables, the authors 
5:80:5173:0:28:86:480:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:claim that the structure of a bank’s assets, measured by loan concentrations in the 
5:81:5257:28:28:86:514:681:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:portfolio, serves as a good proxy for risk. “Loans are one of the riskiest assets that banks 
5:82:5350:28:27:86:526:653:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:can hold (p. 842).” “A higher proportion of loans leaves a bank more exposed to credit risk 
5:83:5442:27:28:86:502:626:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:and more vulnerable to adverse economic shock (p. 843).” The statistically significant 
5:84:5529:28:27:86:517:598:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:relationship between LOANASS, TOTCAP, and CAPLOAN reveals moral hazard at work. 
5:85:5609:27:28:86:506:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:In Table 2, however, the authors’ argue that the coefficient on INSURED indicates that 
5:86:5696:28:28:86:500:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:moral hazard induced excess risk taking and influenced the survival of banks. But the 
5:87:5782:28:27:86:526:515:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f3:B:regressions also contain the variable LOANASS. If LOANASS serves as a good proxy for ex 
5:88:5870:27:28:86:520:488:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f1:B:ante portfolio risk, as the authors argue throughout their essay and in Tables 3 and 4, then 
5:89:5963:28:27:86:508:460:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:the variable INSURED cannot also do so. Regression analysis imposes a ceteris paribus 
5:90:6049:27:28:86:523:433:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:assumption. The coefficient on INSURED measures the correlation between insurance and 
5:91:6135:28:28:86:499:405:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:failure that is orthogonal to LOANASS, that is holding the loan to asset ratio constant. 
5:92:6224:28:27:122:505:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?: In other words, if the coefficient on INSURED reveals moral hazard at work, it 
5:93:6303:27:28:86:527:350:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:must reveal moral hazard operating through a channel other than distorting banks decisions 
5:94:6394:28:27:86:377:322:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:concerning the bearing of risk. What might that channel be? 
5:95:6454:27:14:86:92:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:  
5:96:6456:14:28:86:233:281:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:C:Resolving the Contradiction 
5:97:6484:28:27:122:517:253:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?: The literature on deposit insurance discusses two types of moral hazard. The first, 
5:98:6568:27:28:86:506:226:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:which the authors explicitly search for in this essay, involves excess risk-taking among 
5:99:6657:28:28:86:500:198:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:insured banks. The relationship at issue is that between managers and regulators, who 
5:100:6743:28:27:86:506:170:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:indirectly underwrite gambles gone bad by zombie banks. The Savings and Loan crisis 
5:101:6827:27:0:86:228:143:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:inspired this line of research. 
6:102:6860:0:28:122:494:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?: The second occurs when the presence of insurance reduces the incentives for 
6:103:6936:28:28:86:518:681:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:depositors to monitor the safety of their savings. Depositors stop monitoring the behavior 
6:104:7027:28:27:86:476:653:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:of bankers, and no longer bother to move deposits from worse to better managed 
6:105:7106:27:28:86:525:626:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:institutions. Mismanagement increases. Bad banks proliferate. Competitive pressures force 
6:106:7196:28:27:86:501:598:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:good banks to cut costs and corners, initiating what may become a race to the bottom. 
6:107:7282:27:28:122:524:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?: Mismanagement of this type does not generate predictable patterns in bank balance 
6:108:7364:28:28:86:516:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:sheets. Some classic examples of mismanagement illustrate this point. One, a bank never 
6:109:7452:28:27:86:523:515:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:bothers to make loans. Instead, it invests in eligible paper, deposits funds in correspondent 
6:110:7546:27:28:86:527:488:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:banks, and keeps the bulk of its resources in its vault. Its costs exceed revenues, and it goes 
6:111:7642:28:27:86:497:460:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:bankrupt, because its portfolio has too low of a return and too little risk. Two, a bank 
6:112:7731:27:28:86:511:433:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:invests in a large, expensive building with beautiful new furniture and artwork, which it 
6:113:7821:28:28:86:491:405:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:cannot afford on current revenues, and goes bankrupt. Three, bank managers do not 
6:114:7903:28:27:86:527:377:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:perform due diligence and fail to collect outstanding debts. Losses rise. Bankruptcy results. 
6:115:7997:27:28:86:524:350:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:In the first two examples, the balance sheets of the banks would exhibit low ratios of loans 
6:116:8090:28:27:86:493:322:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:to assets. In the third example, the balance sheet of a bank could exhibit any level of 
6:117:8178:27:28:86:166:295:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:investment risk. 
6:118:8195:28:28:122:501:267:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?: This property of mismanagement makes it a likely explanation for the positive 
6:119:8273:28:27:86:520:239:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:coefficient on INSURED in Table 2, since the logic of regression analysis dictates that the 
6:120:8365:27:28:86:509:212:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:factor generating the coefficient must be orthogonal to LOANASS and to the underlying 
6:121:8451:28:27:86:511:184:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:phenomena, portfolio concentration and overall asset risk, for which LOANASS proxies.

6:124:8698:28:0:86:515:101:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:supposition. Each year when deposit insurance existed in Texas between 1921 and 1926, 
7:125:8785:0:28:86:516:709:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:mismanagement forced an average of 3.2% of all state banks to suspend operations. That 
7:126:8872:28:28:86:496:681:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:fraction amounted to nearly 80% of all state bank suspensions. In the four years after 
7:127:8959:28:27:86:507:653:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:deposit insurance, mismanagement forced an average of only 1.2% of all state banks to 
7:128:9045:27:28:86:514:626:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:suspend operations. The share of suspensions attributed to mismanagement fell similarly

7:132:9212:28:27:122:487:529:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:?: Hooks and Robinson indicate that their article provides additional evidence 
7:133:9288:27:28:86:521:502:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:supporting the conventional academic wisdom. This comment argues that their essay does 
7:134:9375:28:28:86:503:474:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:that and much more. Their regressions demonstrate that while the prevailing paradigm 
7:135:9460:28:27:86:509:446:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:explains a portion of the events that occurred during the 1920s, some other phenomena, 
7:136:9547:27:28:86:523:419:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:hitherto overlooked, must also be at work. Economic logic and evidence form the archives 
7:137:9636:28:27:86:515:391:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:of the Board of Governors suggest that phenomenon is mismanagement, which increases 
7:138:9720:27:28:86:493:364:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:B:when insurance reduces depositors’ incentives to monitor and react to the safety and
