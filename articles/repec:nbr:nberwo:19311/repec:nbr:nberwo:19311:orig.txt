2:31:1602:28:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Starting in 2006, respondents in the U.S. Health and Retirement Study were asked to submit biomarkers
2:32:1703:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and were notified of certain results. Respondents with very high blood pressure were given a card
2:33:1800:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:during the interview; all respondents were notified by mail of their BP,  hemoglobin A1c, and total
2:34:1899:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and HDL cholesterol readings alongside recommended thresholds. About 5.8 percent received the
2:35:1992:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:high blood pressure card, and 5.4 percent had high A1c levels, an indicator of diabetes. Rates of undiagnosed
2:36:2101:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:high BP and diabetes according to these biomarkers were 1.5 and 0.7 percent. Average treatment effects
2:37:2203:14:14:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of biomarker collection on the panel overall were effectively zero, but notification of rare and dangerous
2:38:2309:14:14:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:readings triggered new diagnoses, increased pharmaceutical usage, and altered health behaviors among
2:39:2409:14:14:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:small subsamples of respondents and their spouses. Very high BP or A1c readings raised new diagnosis
2:40:2509:14:14:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and medication usage by 20 to 40 percentage points. Uncontrolled high BP triggered reductions in
2:41:2605:14:14:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:own smoking and own and spouse’s drinking. High A1c was associated with a 2.2 percent drop in
2:42:2698:14:14:72:540:420:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:weight and an increase in exercise among respondents without a previous diagnosis of diabetes, but
2:43:2796:14:42:72:540:406:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:with no changes among those already diagnosed, whose self-reported health and disability worsened.

3:51:3020:0:30:108:221:674:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:1  Introduction
3:52:3035:30:20:108:504:644:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:There is great interest in the ability of biomarkers to enhance our knowledge about the
3:53:3122:20:20:108:504:624:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:determinants of healthy aging, longevity, and disparities (Weinstein, Vaupel and Wachter,
3:54:3211:20:20:108:503:604:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:2007).1Biomarkers convey rich information to researchers and potentially also to survey
3:55:3298:20:20:108:504:584:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:respondents as well. Principles surrounding the protection of human subjects, and in par-
3:56:3387:20:20:108:504:564:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:ticular informed consent, may require a data collection team to inform the research subject
3:57:3478:20:20:108:503:544:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:about observed biomarkers when the withholding of such information could be harmful.2
3:58:3563:20:20:108:504:524:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:The natural question is whether notifying individuals about their biomarker readings causes
3:59:3654:20:20:108:504:504:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:any changes in behavior or circumstances that are distinct from any effects of the underlying
3:60:3747:20:20:108:277:484:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:conditions indexed by the biomarkers.3
3:61:3785:20:20:122:503:464:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:In 2006, the fourteen year-old Health and Retirement Study (HRS) of the University of
3:62:3870:20:19:107:503:444:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Michigan’s Institute for Social Research expanded to include biomarkers and several other
3:63:3959:19:20:107:503:425:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:new measures in an Enhanced Face-to-Face interview conducted on randomly selected ro-
3:64:4044:20:15:107:503:405:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:tating halves of the sample.4During the eighth and each subsequent biennial HRS wave,
3:65:4129:15:12:119:503:390:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:1Biomarkers vary widely in what they measure, running from relatively standard objective measurements
3:66:4230:12:10:108:504:378:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:of body characteristics, such as height, weight, and waist circumference, but also extending to genetic analy-
3:67:4340:10:9:108:504:368:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:sis of the DNA in blood samples. Between these two extremes are metrics that physicians commonly collect
3:68:4444:9:10:108:504:359:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:during routine physicals in addition to height and weight, such as blood pressure and blood characteris-
3:69:4548:10:9:108:504:349:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:tics like the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood sugar. Recent years have brought the addition
3:70:4655:9:10:108:504:340:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:of biomarkers to several preexisting longitudinal surveys, including the National Longitudinal Study of
3:71:4758:10:9:108:123:330:8:g_d0_f6:6:g_d0_f5:Adolescent Health (Add Health) in its third wave, and the Health and Retirement Study in its eighth wave.2
3:72:4864:9:10:123:504:321:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) also notifies participants of a wide
3:73:4962:10:9:108:504:311:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:array of biomarker levels, including overweight, blood pressure, oral health, and so on. The Add Health
3:74:5065:9:10:108:504:302:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:collected biomarkers in its third wave and notified respondents of results of testing for HIV, chlamydia, and
3:75:5174:10:9:108:504:292:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:gonorrhea. By contrast, the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) measure HIV status in developing
3:76:5271:9:10:108:504:283:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:countries but explicitly do not inform respondents about results, ostensibly to preserve anonymity and
3:77:5373:10:9:108:123:273:8:g_d0_f6:6:g_d0_f5:respondents’ safety. Instead, DHS participants are offered referrals for free counseling and testing.3
3:78:5475:9:10:123:504:264:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:Researchers are increasingly aware that participation in a panel study can change some types of behavior
3:79:5579:10:9:108:503:254:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:under some conditions (Halpern-Manners and Warren, 2012), no matter how much the researcher would like
3:80:5681:9:9:108:504:245:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:to minimize his or her footprint. In the present context, the possibility that observation becomes a treat-
3:81:5788:9:10:108:504:236:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:ment seems considerably more likely than in standard cases of panel conditioning, because the motivating
3:82:5892:10:9:108:504:226:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:presumption of the IRB is that information about risky levels of biomarkers has measurable impacts on
3:83:5993:9:7:108:384:217:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:behavior and outcomes. If it did not, withholding it would cause no harm.
3:84:6066:7:12:119:504:210:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:4HRS ostensibly chose to collect biomarkers and other measures on half the panel once every other wave,
3:85:6169:12:10:108:504:198:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:so that every respondent would submit biomarkers every four years, because the core HRS survey was
3:86:6267:10:9:108:504:188:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:already lengthy, and because of the increased costs involved with in-person collection of biomarkers. As
3:87:6371:9:10:108:503:179:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:discussed byWeir(2007), the original plan was for a third of the sample to be biomarked every wave, for
3:88:6474:10:9:108:504:169:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:a six-year gap between readings. A pilot consisting of a subset of the 2006 biomarkers was conducted in
3:89:6577:9:10:108:504:160:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:the 2004 wave, during which 3,734 HRS respondents were asked for consent. Of those, 3,447 complied and
3:90:6679:10:9:108:504:150:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:most completed breath and hand strength tests. About half completed walking tests, and 515 completed
3:91:6779:9:10:108:504:141:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:height and weight measurements. No measures of blood pressure or blood composition were attempted. As
3:92:6880:10:9:108:504:131:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:shown in Figure5, the 2004 wave was abnormal in that most interviews were conducted in person in hopes
3:93:6982:9:0:108:358:122:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:of raising rates of consenting to the Social Security earnings match.
4:94:7052:0:20:108:503:674:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:respondents in one rotating half or “biomarker group” were asked their consent to physical
4:95:7142:20:20:108:504:654:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:measures including three measures of blood pressure (BP), a saliva sample, and a blood
4:96:7228:20:20:108:504:634:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:sample, all collected by an interviewer roughly in the middle of the core interview.  For
4:97:7317:20:20:108:504:614:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:respondents whose minimum blood pressure was greater than 160 systolic or 110 diastolic,
4:98:7405:20:20:108:504:594:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:interviewers left behind a “high blood pressure card,” which recommended that the re-
4:99:7490:20:20:108:504:574:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:spondent immediately see a physician for a recheck of blood pressure. HRS later notified
4:100:7578:20:20:108:504:554:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:all participants of up to four results by mail, accompanied by suggestions to see a physi-
4:101:7668:20:20:108:504:534:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:cian if their biomarkers were outside normal ranges: blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, total
4:102:7758:20:20:108:299:514:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:cholesterol, and HDL or “good” cholesterol.
4:103:7801:20:20:122:503:494:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Whether information about biomarkers that is new to the researcher may trigger any
4:104:7883:20:20:108:504:474:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:behavioral change by the respondent is unclear. First, the information may not be new to
4:105:7971:20:20:108:504:454:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the respondent. Individuals who already know their biomarkers, even if they are at risky
4:106:8059:20:20:108:504:434:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:levels, either may have already attempted to change their behavior without successfully
4:107:8146:20:19:108:504:414:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:altering the biomarker, may not be able to change their behavior, or may have chosen not
4:108:8234:19:20:108:504:395:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:to do so. Second, even new information may not trigger behavioral change if respondents
4:109:8321:20:20:108:504:375:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:do not understand or believe it, do not visit or believe their doctors, or if their doctors do
4:110:8415:20:20:108:503:355:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:not adequately help control the condition (Berlowitz et al.,1998;Hyman and Pavlik, 2001).
4:111:8504:20:20:107:504:335:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Third, there are measurement issues. The “white coat effect” in a physician’s office (Verdec-
4:112:8597:20:20:107:504:315:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:chia et al., 1997) may translate to biomarker collection during a home visit. Readings could
4:113:8689:20:20:108:503:295:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:be influenced by events prior to the interview,5and lab irregularities could produce classical
4:114:8783:20:20:108:504:275:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:measurement error or missing data. Pre-existing knowledge about biomarker levels, or other
4:115:8873:20:20:108:504:255:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:characteristics that are correlated with biomarkers may determine a subject’s willingness
4:116:8962:20:20:108:504:235:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:or ability to be biomarked, and it could alter observed relationships between biomarkers
4:117:9050:20:15:108:504:215:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and outcomes.6Fourth, it is challenging to distinguish statistically between effects of the
4:118:9141:15:12:119:504:200:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:5This is not true of hemoglobin A1c, which measures average blood sugar over several preceding months
4:119:9242:12:9:107:503:188:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:(Weir, 2007). Likewise, total and HDL cholesterol appear to be unaffected   by fasting. But there are well-
4:120:9349:9:7:108:492:179:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:known daily patterns in blood pressure, which may also respond to the stress of an in-person interview.
4:121:9452:7:12:119:504:172:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:6If respondents are aware of their health conditions and are taking medication to return biomarkers to
4:122:9554:12:10:108:504:160:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:normal ranges, like high blood pressure medication or insulin shots, then one would expect the biomarkers not
4:123:9663:10:9:108:504:150:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:to register outside of normal ranges and thus not prompt behavioral change. Thus in terms of the biomarker,
4:124:9770:9:10:108:504:141:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:an individual who is successfully managing the biomarker via medication should be indistinguishable from
4:125:9874:10:9:108:504:131:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:one whose biomarker was normal all along. But health outcomes may well differ between these two groups,
4:126:9977:9:0:108:304:122:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:even if behavioral responses seem likely not to differ.
5:127:10033:0:20:108:504:674:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:notification versus effects of the abnormal biomarker level, because informed consent does
5:128:10123:20:20:108:504:654:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:not permit some individuals to submit biomarkers but not be informed in order to serve
5:129:10209:20:20:108:504:634:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:as a control group. Whether the revelation of an objectively risky biomarker reading in a
5:130:10298:20:20:108:504:614:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:household panel survey may change behavior is thus an open question, and it is the focus
5:131:10386:20:20:108:166:594:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of this paper.
5:132:10400:20:20:122:503:574:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Two key aspects of the data are the prevalence of biomarker readings outside normal
5:133:10483:20:20:108:504:554:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:range and the extent of preexisting knowledge of the underlying condition.  The HRS is
5:134:10569:20:20:108:504:534:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:nationally representative of Americans over age 50, a group that has relatively good access
5:135:10660:20:20:108:504:514:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:to health insurance and care and seems likely to be aware of their health. Of the roughly
5:136:10749:20:20:108:504:494:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:7,000 individuals who submitted biomarkers in the eighth wave of the HRS in 2006 and
5:137:10833:20:20:108:504:474:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:were interviewed again in 2008, 5.8 percent received the high blood pressure card, and 5.4
5:138:10923:20:20:108:504:454:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:percent had A1c levels of 7.0 percent or higher, an indicator of diabetes. A majority of
5:139:11011:20:20:108:504:434:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:individuals in these two interesting subgroups had also reported a preexisting diagnosis of
5:140:11102:20:19:108:504:414:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the underlying disease, but 25 and 12 percent of them respectively had not, suggesting rates
5:141:11194:19:20:108:504:395:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of undiagnosed high blood pressure and diabetes of 1.5 and 0.7 percent. Individuals with
5:142:11282:20:20:108:504:375:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:HDL cholesterol below the recommended threshold of 40 mg/dL were only 8.5 percent of the
5:143:11370:20:20:108:504:355:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:sample, about half of whom were already on cholesterol medication. As one might expect,
5:144:11457:20:20:108:504:335:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the prevalence of high blood pressure more broadly defined, in this case anything over
5:145:11543:20:20:108:504:315:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:120/80, high total cholesterol above 200 mg/dL, and previous diagnoses of those conditions
5:146:11633:20:20:108:504:295:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and usage of associated medications were much higher, often approaching half the sample.
5:147:11721:20:20:108:504:275:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Those most at risk for screening outside of normal range on these four biomarkers were
5:148:11807:20:20:108:504:255:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:disproportionately male, African-American, Hispanic, not homeowners, and did not report
5:149:11894:20:20:108:222:235:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:health insurance coverage.
5:150:11920:20:20:122:503:215:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Probably because dangerous levels of biomarkers were relatively rare in the sample, and
5:151:12007:20:20:108:504:195:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:rarer still among those previously undiagnosed, an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis reveals
5:152:12096:20:20:108:504:175:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:that average treatment effects of collecting biomarkers and notifying participants of results
5:153:12189:20:20:108:504:155:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:tend to be indistinguishable from zero. The only statistically significant findings are that
5:154:12281:20:19:108:504:135:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:biomarker collection may have reduced rates of doctor visits and prescription medication
5:155:12369:19:0:108:504:116:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:usage by about 1.5 percent on average. This is a small amount relative to average rates of
6:156:12460:0:20:108:504:674:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:around 80 to 90 percent reported in the sample, and the reduction does not extend to the
6:157:12548:20:20:108:503:654:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:average number of doctor visits, but it is an interesting result that could reflect a perception
6:158:12644:20:20:108:504:634:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:that biomarker collection substitutes for a physical examination. Thus a blanket policy of
6:159:12734:20:20:108:504:614:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:screening Americans over age 50 in households seems unlikely to produce tangible health
6:160:12821:20:20:108:504:594:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:benefits. Given the high rates of insurance coverage and care utilization reported by HRS
6:161:12910:20:20:108:286:574:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:respondents, this result is not surprising.
6:162:12953:20:20:122:509:554:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:More interesting findings are that conditions and behavior among subgroups with biomark-
6:163:13041:20:20:108:504:534:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:ers outside normal range appear to have responded to notification. This is especially true
6:164:13131:20:20:108:504:514:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:among the smaller subsets of those not reporting a previous diagnosis of the underlying
6:165:13218:20:20:108:504:494:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:condition, who presumably were surprised by the news. For those who did not know they
6:166:13303:20:20:108:504:474:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:had high blood pressure, receiving the high blood pressure card raised the prevalence of
6:167:13391:20:20:108:504:454:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:diagnosis and medication usage two years later by around 20 percentage points. Effects for
6:168:13481:20:20:108:504:434:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:respondents with A1c above 7.0 were larger, around 40 percentage points in increased diag-
6:169:13571:20:19:108:504:414:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:nosis and medication usage for the previously undiagnosed, and self-reported weight appears
6:170:13662:19:20:108:504:395:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:to fall among these individuals by around 2 percent while frequency of physical activity in-
6:171:13754:20:20:108:504:375:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:creases. Perhaps most interesting is that spouses seem to react to the abnormal biomarker
6:172:13843:20:20:108:504:355:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:readings of their partners in addition to their own, revealing some nuanced household-based
6:173:13934:20:20:108:504:335:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:approaches to health maintenance and production. In particular, an undiagnosed spouse’s
6:174:14021:20:20:108:504:315:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:high A1c reading also increases own exercise, while a diabetic spouse’s reading appears to
6:175:14111:20:20:108:504:295:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:reduce own weight, suggesting responses of a shared input like diet, which unfortunately
6:176:14199:20:20:108:504:275:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the HRS does not measure. Spouses of respondents with uncontrolled high blood pressure
6:177:14285:20:20:108:504:255:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:appear to reduce their drinking, and in particular their binge drinking, at the same time as
6:178:14377:20:20:108:229:235:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the respondents themselves.
6:179:14404:20:20:122:503:215:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:These results are interesting in view of their implications for behavior and policy, and
6:180:14492:20:20:108:504:195:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:for interpreting dynamics in panel studies with biomarker collection. Estimated impacts
6:181:14579:20:20:108:504:175:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of abnormal biomarker notification can be statistically significant and meaningful for the
6:182:14669:20:20:108:504:155:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:individual but are often but not always relegated to the 1 or 2 percent of the eligible
6:183:14756:20:19:108:504:135:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:sample who screened positive without prior knowledge of the condition. Biomarker collection
6:184:14847:19:0:108:504:116:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and notification, or by extension visits by trained medical professionals, thus has real but
7:185:14940:0:20:108:504:674:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:extremely circumscribed average effects on outcomes among Americans over 50. Compared
7:186:15025:20:20:108:503:654:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:to the likely costs involved with a blanket extension of such services, the benefits seem
7:187:15114:20:20:108:504:634:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:minimal to nonexistent without additional targeting. A strategy of screening individuals
7:188:15202:20:20:108:504:614:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:whose characteristics place them more at risk of screening outside normal range might
7:189:15287:20:20:108:504:594:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:maximize the benefits.  Analysis of panel datasets that include biomarker collection and
7:190:15375:20:20:108:504:574:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:notification is likely prone to small amounts of bias unless the panel information is utilized
7:191:15469:20:20:108:504:554:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:to control for the effects of biomarking, which appear real but certainly not as large as the
7:192:15562:20:20:108:504:534:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:effects of mode of interview on self-reports. The tight correlation between mode of interview
7:193:15655:20:20:108:504:514:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and biomarker collection in the HRS implies that an analysis of either should account for
7:194:15744:20:20:108:291:494:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:both whenever that correlation is present.
7:195:15786:20:20:122:503:474:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:In the sections that follow, I describe HRS biomarker collection and notification in greater
7:196:15878:20:20:108:504:454:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:detail and briefly discuss my statistical approaches. Then I present the basic characteristics
7:197:15972:20:20:108:504:434:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of the panel interviewed in 2006 before revealing the main results and discussing robustness
7:198:16064:20:44:108:302:414:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and persistence. The final section concludes.
7:199:16109:44:30:108:476:370:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:2  Biomarkers in the Health and Retirement Study
7:200:16157:30:20:108:504:340:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is a biennial panel survey of U.S. households
7:201:16240:20:20:108:504:320:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:sponsored by the National Institute on Aging and conducted by the University of Michigan’s
7:202:16330:20:20:108:503:300:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Institute for Social Research (Juster and Suzman, 1995). Originally begun in 1992 with a
7:203:16418:20:20:108:503:280:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:representative sample of Americans born between 1931 and 1941, the HRS was merged with
7:204:16504:20:20:107:503:260:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:a sister dataset and expanded in its fourth wave in 1998 to represent Americans aged 50 and
7:205:16595:20:20:107:503:240:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:over, and it has periodically added new birth cohorts in order to maintain representative
7:206:16684:20:20:107:503:220:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:coverage.  In the eighth wave of data collection in 2006, when biomarker collection was
7:207:16771:20:37:107:316:200:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:added, there were a total of 18,469 respondents.
7:208:16819:37:26:107:356:163:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:2.1  Biomarker collection and notification
7:209:16861:26:20:107:503:137:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Starting in 2006, the HRS expanded to include biomarkers and several other new measures in
7:210:16951:20:0:107:503:117:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Enhanced Face-to-Face (EFTF) interviews conducted on randomly selected rotating halves
8:211:17038:0:20:108:504:674:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of the panel each wave. Consenting respondents would thus be biomarked once every four
8:212:17124:20:20:108:503:654:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:years.7During EFTF interviews, interviewers measured and collected biomarkers including
8:213:17211:20:20:108:504:634:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:blood pressure, pulse, saliva and blood samples; conducted tests of grip strength, breath,
8:214:17301:20:20:108:504:614:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:balance, and walking; and left behind a questionnaire on psychosocial topics.Weir(2007)
8:215:17388:20:20:108:503:594:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:describes biomarking as having occurred roughly in the middle of the EFTF interview, after
8:216:17478:20:20:108:370:574:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:the self-reports of health, height and weight, and disability.8
8:217:17541:20:20:122:503:554:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A key feature of biomarker collection in the HRS was the commitment to notifying
8:218:17621:20:20:108:504:534:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:respondents about four biomarker results: blood pressure, A1c, total cholesterol, and HDL
8:219:17710:20:20:108:504:514:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:cholesterol.9Notification of very high blood pressure occurred immediately, and notification
8:220:17802:20:20:108:504:494:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:by mail of all four results followed within about a month for all respondents who submitted
8:221:17893:20:20:108:504:474:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:biomarkers. When the minimum of three measures of blood pressure exceeded 160 mmHg
8:222:17975:20:20:108:504:454:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:systolic or 110 diastolic, HRS interviewers left behind a “high blood pressure card” similar to
8:223:18070:20:20:108:504:434:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:that depicted in Figure1. The card, which here shows the average readings for the subsample
8:224:18161:20:19:108:503:414:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:that received it in 2006, recommends that the respondent see a physician immediately, with
8:225:18251:19:20:107:503:395:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:bold and underline emphasis on the word “immediately.”  Later, all recipients received
8:226:18337:20:20:107:503:375:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:a mailed notification letter reporting all four biomarker levels, the recommended normal
8:227:18425:20:20:107:503:355:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:ranges, and suggestions to see a physician if the biomarkers were outside normal range. A
8:228:18514:20:20:107:504:335:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:representative mockup of the notification letter is shown in Figure2, which lists biomarker
8:229:18605:20:15:108:460:315:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:levels for the sample average and the thresholds as they were specified in 2006.10
8:230:18687:15:12:119:503:300:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:7Both respondents in a couple household in HRS would be measured in the same wave; new spouses who

8:232:18890:10:9:107:503:278:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:the biomarked pool include non-respondents in previous waves who are asked to biomark when they reenter
8:233:18993:9:7:107:474:269:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:the panel. The method of assignment of previous non-responders to biomarking waves is unknown.
8:234:19087:7:12:119:504:262:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:8Section C of the computerized HRS questionnaire asks about health, height, and weight, while disability
8:235:19191:12:10:107:503:250:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:questions appear in section G. The biomarkers were in section I, presumably followed by questions on
8:236:19291:10:9:107:503:240:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:employment (J), work history (L), work-related disabilities (M), and so on. An open question is whether
8:237:19394:9:10:107:503:231:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:respondents knew in advance of the self reports what biomarker collection was going to entail and changed
8:238:19499:10:9:107:503:221:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:their responses in a special way. I cannot rule this out, but I think it is more likely their self reports changed
8:239:19613:9:9:107:503:212:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:only because it was an in-person rather than telephone interview, an effect that I find in the data and that
8:240:19721:9:7:107:218:203:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:I control for as I discuss later.
8:241:19754:7:12:119:504:196:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:9Consent forms for biomarker collection included language indicating that HRS would communicate
8:242:19849:12:10:107:503:184:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar results to the respondent, as well as an indication if they are
8:243:19957:10:7:107:407:174:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:outside normal range, and an instruction to share the information with a doctor.
8:244:20037:7:12:115:504:167:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:10The recommended thresholds that appear here and in the instructions for the high blood pressure
8:245:20134:12:9:107:503:155:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:card roughly match official guidelines from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Mayo
8:246:20235:9:10:107:503:146:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:Clinic, and other sources that can be found online. Thresholds for the high BP card correspond to stage-2
8:247:20340:10:9:107:503:136:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:hypertension as defined by the NHLBI. The A1c threshold of 7.0 is higher than that of 6.5 recommended
8:248:20441:9:10:107:504:127:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:by  International Expert Committee(2009), but the Mayo Clinic’s target for diabetes control in diagnosed
8:249:20545:10:9:108:504:117:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:populations is 7.0 or lower.  Respondents whose blood work was incomplete due to lab errors or other
8:250:20645:9:0:108:504:108:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:considerations received a letter including text to that effect on the first page. In the 2012 wave, the high blood
9:251:20760:0:20:122:504:674:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:On average, mailed notification letters followed collection by about 10 days. More than
9:252:20847:20:20:108:504:654:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:half of the reports occurred before July 2006, and over ninety percent were reported before
9:253:20938:20:20:108:504:634:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:November 2006, but about 50 were delayed into the first two months of 2007. Most reports
9:254:21026:20:20:108:504:614:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:were marked either the same month as the collection or in the following month. For com-
9:255:21113:20:20:108:504:594:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:parison, the earliest core interview in wave 9 was conducted in February 2008, or a full year
9:256:21206:20:20:108:504:574:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:after the latest blood spot report. The average gap between the report and the starting
9:257:21293:20:20:108:504:554:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:date of the core interview in the following wave was about 23 months. The timing of data
9:258:21381:20:20:108:504:534:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:collection and biomarker notification in the HRS panel is depicted in two timelines in Figure

9:266:21958:20:28:108:224:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:collection and notification:

9:269:22122:28:20:120:504:275:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:2. Average treatment effects on the treated (ATET) of screening outside normal range
9:270:22206:20:28:132:220:255:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:in 2006 are nonzero.
9:271:22226:28:20:108:504:227:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:I can assess the average treatment effects of biomarker collection and notification using

9:273:22404:20:18:108:503:187:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:variable (Imbens and Angrist, 1994); here, it suffices to estimate the reduced form equation
9:274:22496:18:9:108:503:169:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:pressure thresholds in the notification letters were changedto 140/90, and the total cholesterol threshold
9:275:22602:9:10:108:504:160:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:was changed to 240. Thresholds for A1c and HDL cholesterol have remained the same. Starting with the
9:276:22702:10:9:108:504:150:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:2008 wave, HRS ceased mailing results to respondents in the states of New York and California based on a
9:277:22806:9:9:108:504:141:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:determination by legal advisors to HRS. Respondents in those states were sent a different notification letter
9:278:22915:9:10:108:504:132:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:listing a call-in number they could use to obtain results. I obtained information about these thresholds via
9:279:23023:10:9:108:504:122:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:email discussions with HRS investigators; aside from the high BP card instructions, they are otherwise not
9:280:23129:9:0:108:248:113:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:mentioned in the public data releases.
10:281:23168:0:20:108:503:674:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of the outcome on the instrument. This approach benefits from the rigorous identification
10:282:23257:20:20:108:504:654:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:provided by randomization, but if behavioral changes are concentrated among the small
10:283:23342:20:20:108:504:634:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:subgroups who screen outside normal range, the average treatment effect could be near
10:284:23427:20:20:108:504:614:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:zero even when there are interesting but rare reactions in the sample. I can test for these
10:285:23518:20:20:108:504:594:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:average treatment effects on the treated by exploiting the panel nature of the HRS. Analysis
10:286:23610:20:20:108:504:574:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of pooled longitudinal data with individual fixed effects (FE) is a generalized difference-in-
10:287:23704:20:20:108:499:554:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:differences approach where past observations of treated cases serve as additional controls.
10:288:23795:20:20:122:504:534:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Figure4 provides a visualization of treatment and control groups. Within the group

10:291:24045:20:20:107:503:474:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:who had a preexisting diagnosis. It is natural to expect behavioral change to be concentrated
10:292:24138:20:20:107:504:454:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:here. SubgroupsD2006,E2006, andF2006were assigned to the 2006 biomarker group but
10:293:24219:20:20:108:504:434:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:did not or could not comply with the treatment. From an intent-to-treat perspective, the
10:294:24307:20:19:108:503:414:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:average treatment effects of biomarker collection in hypothesis1 are revealed by comparing
10:295:24397:19:20:108:503:395:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the entire 2006 biomarker group shown at left with the entire 2008 biomarker group shown
10:296:24485:20:20:108:504:375:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:at right, in which there are analogous subgroups that are not all observable in 2006.  If
10:297:24574:20:20:108:504:355:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:randomization is strong, this can be done by simply comparing means in 2008; a generalized

11:310:25351:0:20:108:503:674:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:submitted biomarkers in 2006 was also notified.11With a pooled dataset of all respondents,

11:325:25945:26:20:108:504:461:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A complication is that biomarker collection and telephone interviewing are inversely corre-
11:326:26036:20:20:108:504:441:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:lated in the HRS, and both appear to affect self-reported outcomes. Biomarkers are collected
11:327:26128:20:20:108:504:421:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:in person via EFTF interviews, but the HRS has historically been a telephone-based sur-
11:328:26215:20:20:108:504:401:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:vey, with in-person interviews limited to first-time respondents, nursing home residents, and
11:329:26308:20:20:108:504:381:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:others for whom a telephone interview was inadequate. As revealed by Figure5, which plots
11:330:26397:20:20:108:503:361:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the share of the groups assigned to biomarking in 2006 and 2008 interviewed by telephone
11:331:26485:20:20:107:503:341:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:in each wave starting with 1998, mode of interview has shifted dramatically first in 2004,
11:332:26575:20:20:107:504:321:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and then again in 2006 with the initiation of regular biomarker collection.12Since then, the
11:333:26667:20:20:108:504:301:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:group not asked for biomarkers is almost exclusively telephoned each wave, while the other
11:334:26757:20:20:108:357:281:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:group requires EFTF interviews for biomarker collection.
11:335:26813:20:20:122:503:261:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Patterns in the data suggest that mode of interview affects several important self reports
11:336:26903:20:20:108:503:241:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:in the HRS. Figure6 shows averages and confidence intervals in self-reported weight since
11:337:26992:20:20:108:503:221:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:1998 separately for the two groups who submitted biomarkers in 2006 and in 2008. The two
11:338:27080:20:14:107:503:201:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:track each other closely prior to 2006, when they sharply diverge. Before they submitted
11:339:27168:14:13:115:503:187:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:11Although respondents in groupA2008submitted biomarkers two years later in 2008, it is unclear whether
11:340:27271:13:9:107:503:174:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:their 2008 biomarkers would be good proxies for what their 2006 biomarkers would have been. The key
11:341:27370:9:10:107:503:165:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:unknown is the persistence of biomarkers over the life course, which likely depends both on biological and on
11:342:27479:10:9:107:503:155:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:socioeconomic conditions. If high blood pressure, A1c, and cholesterol are chronic and stable among those
11:343:27584:9:9:107:503:146:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:undiagnosed, and if those undiagnosed in the HRS tend to remain undiagnosed, then the 2008 biomarker
11:344:27684:9:10:107:504:137:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:levels would be good proxies for the 2006 levels among the key subgroupA2008−B2008. But it is easy to
11:345:27785:10:7:107:181:127:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:speculate otherwise.
11:346:27805:7:0:115:334:120:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:12See footnote4 for a discussion of why 2004 was different.
12:347:27866:0:20:108:503:674:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:biomarkers during the 2006 wave, respondents told their EFTF interviewers that their weight
12:348:27957:20:20:108:504:654:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:had risen by about 0.25 kg, while the rest of the sample on telephone interview indicated
12:349:28046:20:20:108:504:634:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:they had not gained any weight on average. A similar pattern appears in 2008, when the
12:350:28132:20:20:108:504:614:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:group on telephone interview indicated they lost an average of 1 kg while those submitting
12:351:28222:20:20:108:504:594:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:biomarkers in person said they had gained about 0.5 kg. Similar fluctuations are apparent
12:352:28311:20:20:108:504:574:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:in self-reported current smoking behavior. The most plausible explanation for this is that
12:353:28401:20:20:108:504:554:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:face-to-face interviews elicit more accurate responses about characteristics with a visible or
12:354:28495:20:20:108:245:534:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:otherwise apparent component.
12:355:28524:20:20:122:503:514:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:When mode of interview and biomarker collection both affect self-reported outcomes
12:356:28606:20:20:108:504:494:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and are themselves tightly correlated, not only are simple mean comparisons between the
12:357:28693:20:20:108:504:474:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:rotating biomarker groups confounded, so too are simple differences in differences.13One
12:358:28781:20:20:108:504:454:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:could simply avoid this problem by comparing outcomes within rather than between rotating
12:359:28870:20:20:108:504:434:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:biomarker groups, but hypothesis1 could not be directly tested in this way, and rigorously
12:360:28960:20:19:108:504:414:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:testing hypothesis2 requires a better control group than the members of the 2006 biomarker
12:361:29050:19:20:108:503:395:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:group who did not screen outside normal range. A better alternative is to alter the panel
12:362:29139:20:20:108:504:375:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:FE regression equations to control for effects of interview mode, which will be separately

12:386:30287:10:0:108:162:117:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:effects instead.
13:387:30305:0:20:108:503:674:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A final helpful modification is to interact the biomarker notification indicatorszkwith

13:402:30854:26:20:108:504:440:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:The rows in Table1 list an array of salient characteristics of the 2006 biomarker group
13:403:30941:20:20:108:503:420:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:stratified across the columns according to their biomarker results.14Of the five subgroups
13:404:31031:20:20:108:504:400:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:shown, three small groups of around 400 respondents each screened positive for what I
13:405:31116:20:20:108:504:380:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:loosely term “rare and dangerous” conditions: blood pressure high enough to receive the
13:406:31203:20:20:108:504:360:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:high BP card (above 160/110 mmHg), A1c above 7.0 percent, or HDL cholesterol below 40
13:407:31288:20:20:108:504:340:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:mg/dL. Between 2,400 and 3,800 screened positive for high BP (above 120/80 but not over
13:408:31375:20:20:108:504:320:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:160/110) or high total cholesterol (above 200 mg/dL), shares that approach half the sample.
13:409:31466:20:20:108:482:300:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:In 2010, HRS revised upward their normal-range thresholds for these two biomarkers.
13:410:31549:20:20:122:503:280:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:The broad messages in Table1 are that screening out of normal range on these four
13:411:31630:20:20:108:504:260:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:biomarkers is associated with many preexisting characteristics; undiagnosed health con-
13:412:31717:20:20:108:504:240:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:ditions apparently exist even though insurance coverage rates and utilization tend to be
13:413:31805:20:20:108:504:220:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:high; and although health care utilization and behavior may not vary much in the sample,
13:414:31893:20:19:108:504:200:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:there is room for behavioral responses. The top of the table reveals familiar socioeconomic
13:415:31984:19:15:108:504:181:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:patterns in disease incidence, with African American and Hispanic males overrepresented
13:416:32071:15:13:115:503:166:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:14Irestrict attention to respondents who appeared in both the 2006 and 2008 waves, which effectively
13:417:32171:13:9:108:504:153:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:drops about 10 percent of the sample submitting biomarkers across the board, of whom typically 6 percent
13:418:32275:9:9:108:504:144:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:had died and the other 4 percent HRS apparently could not reach. As I discuss shortly, there did not appear
13:419:32382:9:10:108:504:135:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:to be substantial differentials in attrition or mortality across these groups defined by biomarker results by
13:420:32491:10:0:108:246:125:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:2008, a finding that seems surprising.
14:421:32531:0:20:108:504:674:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:among those with very high blood pressure or high A1c.  Depending on the biomarker,
14:422:32614:20:20:108:503:654:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:screening out of normal range may also be associated with marital status, homeownership,
14:423:32702:20:20:108:504:634:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and health insurance coverage. The middle of the table shows that self-reported rates of
14:424:32790:20:20:108:504:614:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:physicians’ diagnoses of health conditions certainly vary across these groups but are not
14:425:32879:20:20:108:504:594:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:universally reported by those who screened out of normal range on the relevant biomarker,
14:426:32968:20:20:108:504:574:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and that rates of new diagnosis for these conditions hover around 2–6 percent between bi-
14:427:33057:20:20:108:504:554:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:ennial waves.15Health care utilization is high across the board, with 90 percent or more
14:428:33145:20:20:108:504:534:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:reporting at least one visit to a doctor, ER, or clinic in the past 2 years, and pharmaceutical
14:429:33240:20:20:108:504:514:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:usage rates above 75 percent. The bottom of the table shows reduced self-reported health
14:430:33328:20:20:108:504:494:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and increased disability among respondents with high A1c, which appear to correlate with
14:431:33416:20:20:108:504:474:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:weight and less exercise, but also less drinking and somewhat less smoking.  Aside from
14:432:33503:20:20:108:504:454:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:that and some limited evidence that respondents with high blood pressure are behaving less
14:433:33593:20:20:108:504:434:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:healthily, there is much similarity across these groups in these behavior metrics. Smoking
14:434:33683:20:19:108:504:414:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:is not very prevalent at around 14 percent, but exercise and drinking could probably be
14:435:33770:19:20:108:349:395:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:altered. Unfortunately the HRS does not measure diet.

14:438:33995:20:20:108:504:335:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:understanding behavioral responses. In addition, comorbidity across spouses is potentially
14:439:34085:20:20:108:504:315:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:relevant because some responses to biomarker notification may be made at the level of the
14:440:34174:20:20:108:504:295:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:household. Table2 shows pairwise correlations between respondents’ and spouses’ screens
14:441:34261:20:20:108:504:275:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:outside of normal range.16Notable results here are the significant but small correlations
14:442:34350:20:20:108:504:255:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:between the high BP card and high A1c, and between high A1c and low HDL, which
14:443:34428:20:20:108:504:235:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:are around 0.05.  Other significant correlations appear between high A1c and high total
14:444:34515:20:20:108:504:215:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:cholesterol, and between high total cholesterol and low HDL cholesterol, which range from
14:445:34604:20:20:108:504:195:10:g_d0_f13:10:g_d0_f3:−0.04 to−0.13. Correlations across spouses are also small and follow an interesting matching
14:446:34696:20:14:108:504:175:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:pattern: the correlations between spouses’ high A1c screens or between spouses’ high total
14:447:34786:14:13:115:504:161:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:15For the current level of condition diagnosis here and in the panel FE analysis later, I use the raw
14:448:34887:13:9:107:503:148:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:responses, in which respondents can dispute records from past waves. In this table, the change in diagnosis
14:449:34994:9:10:107:503:139:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:is calculated using the current statements about present and past diagnosis. Differences between these data
14:450:35101:10:9:107:122:129:8:g_d0_f6:6:g_d0_f5:definitions are minimal and do not appreciably affect results.16
14:451:35165:9:10:123:504:120:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:Pairwise correlations between levels of these biomarkers are qualitatively similar to the correlations

15:453:35321:0:20:108:504:674:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:cholesterol screens are around 0.1 and significant, and there is some weak evidence that
15:454:35409:20:20:108:504:654:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:blood pressure may be jointly elevated among spouses, but both typically do not receive the

15:456:35586:20:20:107:503:614:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:respondents and their spouses are sometimes significant, they are also small, indicating that
15:457:35679:20:37:107:455:594:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:notification of an abnormal screen is often an independent and isolated event.18
15:458:35759:37:27:108:320:557:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:3.2  Mortality and sample attrition
15:459:35794:27:20:108:503:530:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:The HRS tracks mortality well (Weir,2010), and attrition is low compared to other house-
15:460:35882:20:20:108:503:510:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:hold surveys (Banks, Muriel and Smith, 2010). An important question is whether respon-
15:461:35968:20:20:108:504:490:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:dents who screen out of normal range on these biomarkers might have experienced differential
15:462:36060:20:19:107:503:470:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:mortality or panel attrition, which could inject bias into estimates of the effects of biomarker
15:463:36156:19:20:107:503:451:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:notification. I tested for differential mortality and attrition among the 2006 biomarker group
15:464:36250:20:20:107:503:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:by separately modeling death or nonresponse in 2008 as functions of indicator variables for
15:465:36341:20:20:107:503:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:screens out of normal range and an array of socioeconomic control variables using probit
15:466:36429:20:20:107:503:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and logit specifications.19Once I controlled for self-reported health conditions, scores out-
15:467:36522:20:20:108:504:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:side normal range were not significantly associated with either mortality or attrition after
15:468:36614:20:15:108:149:351:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:2 years.20
15:469:36624:15:12:115:503:336:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:17Similarity in spousal characteristics probably due to assortative mating suggest that if anything, we
15:470:36727:12:10:108:504:324:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:might expect to see more correlation in these notifications than we do.  Correlations between spouses’
15:471:36829:10:9:108:504:314:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:weight or body mass indexes, smoking, and frequencies of physical activity are between about 0.12 and 0.4
15:472:36934:9:7:108:162:305:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:in this sample.
15:473:36949:7:12:115:504:298:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:18Another way to summarize the comorbidity structure is by cross tabulation.  Within each group of
15:474:37047:12:9:108:503:286:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:roughly 400 respondents in Table1 with one of the three rare screens, the high BP card, high A1c, orlow
15:475:37150:9:10:108:504:277:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:HDL, only between 21 and 41 individuals received a second notification of a rare screens, such as a high BP
15:476:37257:10:9:108:504:267:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:card combined with high A1c or low HDL, or high A1c combined with low HDL. Only 5 respondents scored
15:477:37357:9:10:108:504:258:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:outside normal range on all three. Respondents with spouses who also screened outside normal range on
15:478:37458:10:9:108:504:248:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:the same one of these three rare measures similarly numbered between 16 and 33 in total depending on the
15:479:37562:9:7:108:148:239:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:biomarker.
15:480:37572:7:12:115:503:232:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:19I used the same covariates that are shown in Table3 plus 9 indicators of diagnosed health conditions:
15:481:37675:12:10:107:503:220:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer, lung disease, heart problems, stroke, psychological problems, memory-
15:482:37783:10:9:107:122:210:8:g_d0_f6:6:g_d0_f5:related disease, and arthritis. Results are available from the author upon request.20
15:483:37868:9:10:123:503:201:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:This is not to say that biomarkers do not affect mortality.Rosero-Bixby and Dow(2012) reveal signifi-
15:484:37969:10:9:107:503:191:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:cant effects of biomarkers on mortality in a Costa Rican panel. Rather, this is a statement about how scoring
15:485:38078:9:10:108:504:182:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:above particular thresholds of biomarkers does or does not affect mortality and other forms of attrition over
15:486:38187:10:9:108:504:172:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:two years in the HRS. In these HRS data, the levels of A1c and total cholesterol are significant predictors of
15:487:38297:9:10:108:504:163:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:death by 2008 even though screens out of normal range on those biomarkers are not. Presumably the infor-
15:488:38401:10:9:108:504:153:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:mation contained in the thresholds alone is picked up well by other covariates, likely the health conditions
15:489:38509:9:0:108:156:144:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:in particular.
16:490:38525:0:27:108:390:674:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:3.3  Predictors of screens outside normal range
16:491:38572:27:20:108:503:647:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Table3 displays selected marginal effects of respondents’ characteristics on the probability
16:492:38664:20:20:107:503:627:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of screening outside normal range in 2006 on the five biomarker categories either with or
16:493:38753:20:20:107:503:607:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:without a previous diagnosis of the disease. HRS directly asks about high blood pressure
16:494:38841:20:20:107:503:587:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and diabetes but not about diagnoses of high or low cholesterol per se.  To proxy the
16:495:38926:20:19:107:503:567:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:latter, I experimented with using diagnoses of heart problems, the closest match among the
16:496:39016:19:20:107:503:548:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:questions, and results were comparable to what I show here, which instead differentiates by
16:497:39107:20:20:107:371:528:10:g_d0_f3:7:g_d0_f4:whether the respondent was taking cholesterol medication.21
16:498:39166:20:20:122:504:508:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Differences according to preexisting knowledge of the disease are evident in Table3,
16:499:39250:20:20:107:503:488:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:as are familiar correlations between socioeconomic status and disease incidence, especially
16:500:39341:20:20:108:504:468:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:when uncontrolled.  There are large and significant effects of many covariates, including
16:501:39430:20:20:108:504:448:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:most prominently sex, race, Hispanic origin, and weight, on the probability of rare and
16:502:39517:20:20:108:504:428:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:dangerous screens resulting in the high BP card or high A1c among those with preexisting
16:503:39605:20:20:108:504:408:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:diagnoses. These respondents could be termed “noncompliers,” because they know they have
16:504:39693:20:20:108:504:388:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the underlying condition but are unable or unwilling to control the biomarker. In contrast,
16:505:39784:20:20:108:504:368:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:there are small and insignificant effects of most characteristics on the incidence of rare and
16:506:39878:20:20:108:504:348:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:dangerous screens among those whom we might call the “undiagnosed.” Although the latter
16:507:39965:20:20:108:503:328:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:are not unpredictable, the patterns in Table3 imply that such screens are probably more
16:508:40052:20:20:108:503:308:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:unexpected. Finally, the marginal effects of not having health insurance on undiagnosed
16:509:40139:20:19:108:504:288:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:moderately high blood pressure and on the cholesterol screens are interesting but apparently
16:510:40231:19:20:108:246:269:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:do not reflect a universal trend.
16:511:40264:20:20:122:503:249:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Results here also bolster the argument that there is room for behavioral change. Un-
16:512:40348:20:20:108:504:229:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:fortunately they also reveal that unhealthy behaviors are more significantly linked to the
16:513:40438:20:15:108:278:209:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:noncompliers than to the undiagnosed.
16:514:40475:15:12:115:503:194:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:21Ican similarly define previous knowledge of high blood pressure and diabetes by whether or not the
16:515:40575:12:0:108:436:182:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:respondent is taking the associated medicine. Results are similar to those reported here.
17:516:40666:0:27:108:291:674:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:3.4  Average treatment effects
17:517:40696:27:20:108:504:647:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Findings thus far suggest that any new information conveyed by biomarker notification is
17:518:40784:20:20:108:504:627:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:likely to be very limited in scope within the sample. Tables1 and 3 report that only around
17:519:40875:20:20:108:503:607:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:1.5 percent of participants in the biomarker wave received a high blood pressure card and did
17:520:40968:20:20:108:504:587:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:not know they had high blood pressure, and perhaps 0.7 percent screened positive for high
17:521:41057:20:19:108:504:567:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A1c and did not already have a diabetes diagnosis. If these notifications are most salient,
17:522:41148:19:20:108:504:548:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:one would expect the average treatment effects of biomarker collection and notification on
17:523:41238:20:20:108:255:528:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:all panel respondents to be small.
17:524:41272:20:20:122:503:508:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Table4 confirms this, reporting insignificant effects of assignment to the 2006 biomarker
17:525:41361:20:20:108:504:488:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:group on 18 of 20 outcomes in 2008 obtained by estimating equation (3) with a linear panel
17:526:41451:20:20:108:504:468:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:FE estimator on the pooled sample of all HRS respondents observed between 1998 and
17:527:41533:20:20:108:504:448:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:2008.22Two outcomes appear to respond significantly to assignment: having seen a doctor
17:528:41620:20:20:108:504:428:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and regularly taking prescription drugs since the previous wave, which fall by 1.5 and 1.2
17:529:41710:20:20:108:504:408:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:percentage points respectively. The average number of doctor visits since the previous wave
17:530:41801:20:20:108:504:388:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:does not respond significantly (not shown), which could be consistent with small changes
17:531:41889:20:20:108:504:368:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:in the prevalence of a common event like this.  Both of these results pass a falsification
17:532:41979:20:20:108:504:348:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:test of regressing the variable contemporaneously on the assignment rather than on the lag
17:533:42069:20:20:108:504:328:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:assignment. That does not reproduce these coefficients, and it should have if the association
17:534:42162:20:20:108:504:308:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:were preexisting or due to an third variable. Simple difference-in-differences estimation, valid
17:535:42258:20:19:108:504:288:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:here because mode of interview is insignificant in these two cases, roughly confirms these
17:536:42348:19:20:108:504:269:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:findings. Given later results that indicate elevated medication usage among some subgroups
17:537:42438:20:20:108:504:249:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:after biomarker notification and no effects on doctor visits, it is hard to know what to make
17:538:42531:20:20:108:504:229:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of these two outliers. It is possible that respondents may have viewed biomarker collection,
17:539:42623:20:20:108:504:209:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:which could not have resulted in a new or refilled prescription, as a substitute for a doctor
17:540:42716:20:15:108:352:189:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:visit or routine physical examination, which could have.
17:541:42772:15:12:115:503:174:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:22All regressions in Tables4–7   are linear, including those modeling dichotomous outcomes.As shown in
17:542:42874:12:10:108:503:162:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:Table1, these outcomes tend to be quite common in the sample, removing a typical concern about applying
17:543:42977:10:9:108:504:152:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:the linear probability model to limited dependent variable analysis. An additional motivation for using the
17:544:43084:9:10:108:504:143:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:linear model, aside from its more straightforward asymptotic characteristics in the presence of fixed effects,
17:545:43194:10:9:108:504:133:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:is that interaction terms are better defined. Results of nonlinear logit models tended to be consistent with
17:546:43302:9:0:108:246:124:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:those of the linear probability model.
18:547:43342:0:20:122:504:674:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:In 13 of the 20 regressions, mode of interview is significantly associated with the self-
18:548:43431:20:20:108:504:654:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:reported outcome. On average, these effects are not particularly large, but due to the tight
18:549:43523:20:20:108:504:634:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:correlation between biomarker collection and mode of interview, they are important here.
18:550:43611:20:20:108:504:614:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Self-reported weight is 0.3 percent lower for those on telephone interview, significant at the 1
18:551:43707:20:20:108:504:594:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:percent level, but this is only about one sixth the size of the average percent understatement
18:552:43801:20:20:108:504:574:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of self-reported weight relative to objective weight as measured in the EFTF, which is about
18:553:43893:20:20:108:503:554:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:1.8 percent in the data and has been discussed elsewhere (Weir,2007). Without controlling
18:554:43982:20:20:108:504:534:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:for mode of interview, however, estimating equation (1) with log weight as the endogenous
18:555:44071:20:20:108:503:514:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:variable attaches that highly significant estimate of−0.003 to lagged biomarker assignment,
18:556:44162:20:37:108:267:494:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:a clear case of omitted variable bias.

18:558:44245:26:20:108:504:431:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:While the average treatment effects on the entire 2006 biomarker sample tend to be insignif-
18:559:44337:20:20:108:504:411:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:icant, a different picture emerges when I model effects on individuals specifically treated by
18:560:44431:20:20:108:504:391:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:notifications of screens outside normal range. In particular, I observe statistically significant
18:561:44528:20:20:108:504:371:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and interesting responses among individuals who screened positive for either of two of the
18:562:44618:20:20:108:504:351:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:three rare and dangerous conditions, very high BP or high A1c, and especially among those
18:563:44707:20:20:108:503:331:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:without a preexisting diagnosis of the underlying condition.23These results pass a falsifica-
18:564:44800:20:34:108:492:311:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:tion test, and they are accompanied by some interesting effects of spouses’ notifications.

18:569:45188:20:20:107:503:191:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:are on condition diagnoses and related pharmaceutical use by the 2008 wave, particularly
18:570:45276:20:20:107:503:171:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:among respondents who did not previously report having the condition. The second-largest
18:571:45364:20:15:107:503:151:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:coefficient in the table is the 42.8 percentage point increase in diabetes diagnosis among those
18:572:45460:15:12:115:504:136:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:23For brevity, I skip over the results of estimating equation (4), without condition interactions. Those
18:573:45564:12:9:108:504:124:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:results are close to the weighted averages of the effects shown in Table5 and are thus often less clear and
18:574:45671:9:0:108:350:115:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:less interesting, They are available from the author upon request.
19:575:45739:0:20:108:503:674:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:who screened positive for high A1c and who did not report having diabetes, followedby the
19:576:45828:20:20:108:504:654:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:39.7 percent increase in the rate of diabetes medication usage among that group. Among
19:577:45914:20:20:108:504:634:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:those who received the high BP card without a previous diagnosis of high BP, diagnoses
19:578:46000:20:20:108:504:614:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:increase 17 percent and drug usage increase 16.1 percent. Respondents with high BP but
19:579:46086:20:20:108:504:594:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:below the card threshold were 5.9 percentage points more likely to have a high BP diagnosis
19:580:46177:20:20:108:504:574:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and 3.9 percent more likely to be on BP medication by 2008, increases that roughly double
19:581:46266:20:20:108:503:554:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the usual rates shown in Table1. Patterns in other diagnoses and medication usage are less
19:582:46356:20:20:108:504:534:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:clear probably due in part to the lack of alignment between high cholesterol and a condition
19:583:46448:20:20:108:504:514:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the HRS asks. Noteworthy is the elevated risk of diagnosis of heart problems or stroke, by
19:584:46538:20:20:108:504:494:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:4.7 and 4.6 percent, among those who received the high BP card and who already knew
19:585:46621:20:20:108:238:474:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:they had high blood pressure.
19:586:46650:20:20:122:503:454:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Notifications are correlated with some measures of health and disability, but many of
19:587:46735:20:20:108:504:434:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:these patterns seem to reflect preexisting characteristics rather than plausible effects of the
19:588:46830:20:19:108:504:414:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:notification.  This is revealed by the falsification tests in Table6 where I have modeled
19:589:46919:19:20:108:503:395:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:outcomes in 2006 rather than 2008 as functions of biomarker notifications from the 2006
19:590:47006:20:20:107:503:375:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:wave. The marginal effects on contemporaneous diagnoses and medication usage here are
19:591:47091:20:20:107:503:355:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:as they should be: positive for the group that had them and negative for the group that
19:592:47178:20:20:107:503:335:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:did not. But coefficients on the disability indexes for those with high BP but no card are
19:593:47268:20:20:107:504:315:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:similar in Tables5 and6, suggesting that those are not effects of notification.  Positive
19:594:47357:20:20:107:503:295:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and significant coefficients on 2008 disability measures among those with high A1c and a
19:595:47445:20:20:107:504:275:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:diabetes diagnosis in Table5 are not present in 2006, however, nor is the protective effect
19:596:47536:20:20:107:503:255:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:against IADL disability for respondents with high A1c but without a diabetes diagnosis,
19:597:47623:20:20:108:260:235:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:implying those effects may be real.
19:598:47658:20:20:122:503:215:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:There appear to be relatively few significant effects for the groups with high BP but no
19:599:47746:20:20:108:504:195:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:card or for those with cholesterol screens out of normal range that can pass the falsifica-
19:600:47837:20:20:108:503:175:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:tion tests shown in Table6. Obvious effects are the 14–15 percent increases in cholesterol
19:601:47927:20:20:108:504:155:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:medication usage rates among those with such screens who had not already been taking
19:602:48011:20:14:108:504:135:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:it.24Another effect that passes the falsification test is the 4.9 percent additional increase in
19:603:48107:14:13:115:504:121:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:24The large and significant negative coefficients here on abnormal cholesterol screens among those who
19:604:48209:13:0:108:504:108:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:were already taking those medications are real. These subgroups report less than 100 percent usage in 2008
20:605:48317:0:20:108:503:674:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:diabetes diagnosis among those with low HDL cholesterol who were already taking choles-
20:606:48404:20:20:108:503:654:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:terol medication. This is roughly a doubling of the usual incidence reported by Table1 and
20:607:48494:20:20:108:503:634:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:is striking in light of concerns that using statins to treat cholesterol may raise the risk of
20:608:48588:20:20:107:503:614:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:diabetes onset (Sattar et al., 2010). Statins are thought to be more effective at lowering
20:609:48678:20:20:108:504:594:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:high cholesterol rather than raising HDL cholesterol, which makes this result and the lack
20:610:48768:20:20:108:504:574:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of an association with high screens on total cholesterol somewhat puzzling. But as shown
20:611:48856:20:20:108:503:554:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:by Table1, the subsample in 2006 with low HDL cholesterol was more likely to be taking
20:612:48942:20:20:108:375:534:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:cholesterol medication than those with high total cholesterol.
20:613:49004:20:20:122:503:514:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Probably the most interesting results in Table5 concern weight, drinking, and exercise
20:614:49090:20:20:107:503:494:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:among undiagnosed diabetics, those respondents with high A1c but without a diagnosis.
20:615:49175:20:20:107:504:474:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:The coefficient on log weight for this subgroup in 2008 is−0.022 and is significant at the
20:616:49265:20:20:107:504:454:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:4.9 percent level (t-stat of−1.97). There is no sign of any contemporaneous association
20:617:49352:20:20:107:504:434:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:from the falsification test in Table6. In addition to large increases in diabetes diagnosis
20:618:49443:20:19:107:503:414:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and medication usage, this group also reports 0.306 fewer drinking days per week, the other
20:619:49534:19:20:108:504:395:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:insignificant coefficients on their drinking behavior are all negative, and while they may
20:620:49624:20:20:108:504:375:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:report less frequent vigorous physical activity, the frequencies of moderate and especially
20:621:49715:20:20:108:504:355:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:light activity appear to rise. These outcomes are fully consistent with practitioners’ common
20:622:49808:20:20:108:504:335:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:recommendations for diabetes control and appear to be the clearest evidence of behavioral
20:623:49897:20:20:108:173:315:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:responses here.
20:624:49912:20:20:122:503:295:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:The other behavioral changes of note that we see in Table5 are concentrated among
20:625:49993:20:20:108:503:275:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the “noncompliers” who received the high BP card and already knew they had high BP.
20:626:50076:20:20:108:504:255:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Among this group, and also among those with high BP but no card who did not already have
20:627:50164:20:20:108:504:235:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the diagnosis, the coefficient on smoking is negative and significant, here−0.023 (t-stat of
20:628:50256:20:20:108:504:215:10:g_d0_f13:10:g_d0_f3:−2.06). Coefficients on drinking are also negative but insignificant among the noncompliers
20:629:50347:20:20:108:504:195:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:with the high BP card, with the largest coefficient of any significance in the table,−0.523
20:630:50438:20:20:108:504:175:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:(t-stat of−1.91), appearing here on the number of binge drinking days (4+ drinks on one
20:631:50525:20:20:108:504:155:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:occasion) in the past 90 days, fully one third of the average response. Frequency of light
20:632:50615:20:17:108:504:135:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:exercise also falls among this group, which may reflect the redistribution of household chores,
20:633:50710:17:10:108:503:118:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:for unknown reasons. Given that the notification thresholds in question are not extreme, one interpretation
20:634:50817:10:0:108:426:108:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:is that the notification is not a good indicator of a persistent condition in these cases.
21:635:50909:0:20:108:504:674:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the primary examples of light exercise given in the question, away from the respondent with
21:636:51000:20:34:108:414:654:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:a history of high blood pressure following receipt of the high BP card.
21:637:51071:34:27:108:250:620:10:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f14:3.5.2  Spouses’ notifications
21:638:51100:27:20:108:504:593:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Although doing so will require dropping the third of the biomarker sample who are not
21:639:51185:20:19:108:504:573:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:coupled, I can also examine the effects on respondents’ outcomes and behaviors of their
21:640:51272:19:20:108:504:554:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:spouses’ receiving notification of screens outside normal ranges using a similar methodology.
21:641:51365:20:20:108:504:534:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Adding spouses’ notifications and their interactions with spouses’ preexisting conditions to
21:642:51457:20:20:108:504:514:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:equation5 and reestimating produces a set of coefficients on own-notifications that are
21:643:51544:20:20:108:504:494:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:similar to those in Table5, because own and spousal notifications are largely independent
21:644:51633:20:20:107:503:474:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:per Table2. It also produces a new set of coefficients on spousal notifications, which appear
21:645:51726:20:20:108:155:454:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:in Table7.
21:646:51736:20:20:122:504:434:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:As one might expect, there are far fewer significant results here, especially among diag-
21:647:51825:20:20:108:504:414:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:noses and other variables that measure own status. When effects on diagnoses and disability
21:648:51916:20:20:108:504:394:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:are significant here, they are often also similarly signed and significant in the falsification
21:649:52011:20:20:108:376:374:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:regression (not shown) and thus are probably not real effects.
21:650:52073:20:20:122:503:354:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:One of the results that passes the falsification test is the marginal effect of a known
21:651:52160:20:20:108:504:334:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:diabetic spouse’s high A1c screen on the respondent’s own log weight of−0.015, significant
21:652:52250:20:20:108:503:314:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:at the 1.2 percent level (t-stat of−2.52). This result is not mirrored by any reaction in own
21:653:52343:20:19:108:504:294:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:physical activity, suggesting that this weight loss may have been obtained through shifts in
21:654:52435:19:20:108:504:275:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:diet, which the HRS does not measure. For respondents whose spouses screened high on
21:655:52519:20:20:108:504:255:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A1c but did not have a preexisting diabetes diagnosis, there was no response of own weight,
21:656:52610:20:20:108:504:235:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:while the frequency of light exercise increased significantly, roughly as much as reported by
21:657:52703:20:20:108:503:215:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the spouse in question, with a coefficient here of−0.425 (t-stat of−3.13) compared with
21:658:52790:20:20:108:293:195:10:g_d0_f13:10:g_d0_f3:−0.372 (t-stat of−2.01) shown in Table5.
21:659:52830:20:20:122:504:175:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:The other behavioral responses of note by spouses in Table7 concern drinking behavior.
21:660:52916:20:20:107:504:155:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Relatively strong evidence suggests a spouse’s high blood pressure causes reductions in own
21:661:53007:20:20:108:504:135:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:binge drinking. The coefficient of−0.962 (t-stat of−2.71) in the first column, for spouses
21:662:53097:20:0:108:504:115:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of respondents who received the high BP card and had already had a diagnosis of high
22:663:53183:0:20:108:504:674:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:blood pressure, is greater in size and significance than the own-coefficient of−0.523 (t-stat
22:664:53276:20:20:108:504:654:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of−1.91) in Table5. If binge drinking is a shared activity between spouses, it stands to
22:665:53364:20:34:108:419:634:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:reason that behaviors might shift together in response to a notification.
22:666:53437:34:27:107:280:600:10:g_d0_f14:10:g_d0_f14:3.5.3  Robustness and persistence
22:667:53470:27:19:107:503:573:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Several other estimation strategies produced results similar to those shown here.25Simple
22:668:53559:19:20:108:504:554:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:differences in differences (DID) are unbiased within the 2006 biomarker group because mode
22:669:53649:20:20:108:504:534:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of interview is changing uniformly. Those estimates mirrored the results of linear panel FE
22:670:53740:20:20:108:504:514:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:regression, which is a generalization of DID. I also explored balancing the panel by selecting
22:671:53834:20:20:108:504:494:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:only treated respondents and choosing controls from individuals in the 2008 biomarker group
22:672:53925:20:20:108:504:474:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:using nearest neighbors matching from a propensity score algorithm. That technique, along
22:673:54014:20:20:108:504:454:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:with restricting the panel regression sample to just the 2006 biomarker group, also produced
22:674:54106:20:20:108:504:434:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:panel FE estimates that were very similar to those presented here. The broad conformity
22:675:54193:20:20:108:504:414:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:of results suggests that much of the identification stems from changes among the treated
22:676:54281:20:20:108:164:394:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:observations.
22:677:54294:20:20:122:503:374:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Testing for the persistence of results is hampered by the fact that while the other half of
22:678:54385:20:20:108:504:354:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the sample submitted biomarkers in 2008, most of their notifications are currently omitted
22:679:54475:20:20:108:504:334:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:variables because the data have been unavailable.26This motivated me to simply drop
22:680:54558:20:20:108:504:314:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the 2010 wave in my analysis thus far, although including it does not appreciably alter
22:681:54645:20:19:108:504:294:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:results. Testing for twice-lagged effects of biomarker notification requires including the 2010
22:682:54740:19:20:108:504:275:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:wave, and results of that analysis suggest that the effects on diagnoses and medication
22:683:54827:20:20:108:504:255:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:usage appeared to persist and possibly strengthen. But those results did not support the
22:684:54915:20:15:108:455:235:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:hypothesis that effects on self-reported weight, drinking, and exercise persisted.
22:685:54997:15:12:115:503:220:6:g_d0_f5:8:g_d0_f6:25An exception was an approach based on regression discontinuities, and the likely reason is that the
22:686:55098:12:10:107:503:208:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:HRS is too small for the approach to work well in this context. In the case of A1c readings and weight,
22:687:55201:10:9:107:503:198:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:for example, there was too much noise in the relationship between the two among the sample above the
22:688:55301:9:10:107:503:189:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:reading of 7.0 percent to generate a clear discontinuity in behavior as one would expect there to be. Graphs
22:689:55409:10:9:107:503:179:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:of diabetes diagnosis against A1c similarly did not depict sharp cutpoints around the threshold.  Panel
22:690:55512:9:10:107:503:170:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:FE results suggest that conditioning on preexisting diagnosis appears to be important for revealing many
22:691:55616:10:9:107:503:160:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:effects, but doing so unfortunately reduces sample size even further and increases noise enough so that
22:692:55719:9:10:107:503:151:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:clear regression discontinuities remain elusive. Multivariate regression seems better suited to understanding
22:693:55828:10:9:107:122:141:8:g_d0_f6:6:g_d0_f5:behavior when sample size is limited and many characteristics affect outcomes.26
22:694:55908:9:10:123:504:132:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:Email correspondence with the HRS team revealed that the 2008 biomarker group was also notified in
22:695:56006:10:0:107:493:122:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:a staggered fashion because of laboratory issues and legal constraints in New York State and California.
23:696:56112:0:20:122:503:674:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Another interesting and feasible test of the persistence of behavioral effects is whether
23:697:56201:20:20:108:503:654:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:objective weight had fallen between 2006 and 2010, the second round of biomarker collection
23:698:56292:20:20:108:504:634:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:for the group that went first, among the undiagnosed subgroup with high A1c. As shown in
23:699:56380:20:20:108:503:614:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Table8, objective weight fell rather uniformly among respondents who submitted biomarkers
23:700:56469:20:20:108:504:594:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:in both waves. Although weight fell between 1.6 and 1.7 percent faster among those with
23:701:56556:20:20:108:504:574:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:high A1c in 2006, the difference was not statistically significant mostly because of small
23:702:56646:20:20:108:504:554:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:subsample size and the strength of the background trend, the latter of which presumably
23:703:56733:20:45:108:246:534:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:reflected the aging of the panel.
23:704:56766:45:30:108:206:489:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:4  Discussion
23:705:56779:30:20:108:504:459:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:The evidence suggests that notifications of biomarker screens outside normal range in the
23:706:56868:20:20:108:504:439:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:2006 wave of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) triggered significant changes in out-
23:707:56956:20:19:108:504:419:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:comes and behavior two years later among select subgroups of respondents under certain
23:708:57042:19:20:108:504:400:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:circumstances. After biomarker collection, HRS interviewers immediately notified respon-
23:709:57130:20:20:108:504:380:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:dents of very high blood pressure by leaving behind a high BP card, and HRS later mailed
23:710:57218:20:20:108:504:360:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:out to respondents the full results of their blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol,
23:711:57313:20:20:108:504:340:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and HDL cholesterol readings, as well as indications of whether those readings were outside
23:712:57404:20:20:108:504:320:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:normal range. Three types of the five possible notifications were “rare and dangerous”: the
23:713:57495:20:20:108:504:300:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:high BP card received by 5.8 percent of respondents, high A1c registered by 5.4 percent,
23:714:57583:20:20:108:504:280:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and low HDL cholesterol registered by 5.4 percent. Two of these notifications, very high
23:715:57671:20:20:108:504:260:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:blood pressure above 160/110 and A1c above 7.0, each produced the most extensive and
23:716:57755:20:20:108:428:240:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:interesting effects on outcomes and behavior two years later in the panel.
23:717:57829:20:20:122:503:220:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:By far the largest and most statistically significant impacts of these screens were on
23:718:57915:20:20:108:504:200:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:rates of new disease diagnosis, which by definition affected the previously undiagnosed.
23:719:58003:20:20:108:504:180:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Respondents who already knew they had the disease and either were unable or unwilling
23:720:58088:20:20:108:504:160:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:to control the biomarker, who can be termed “noncompliers” for simplicity, also responded
23:721:58177:20:19:108:504:140:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:but in different ways.  Rates of diagnosis among the previously undiagnosed jumped 17
23:722:58262:19:0:108:504:121:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:percent for recipients of the high BP card and almost 40 percent for high A1c screens.
24:723:58350:0:20:108:504:674:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Connected with these were similarly large increases in usage rates of associated medications.
24:724:58443:20:20:108:504:654:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:The prevalence of such undiagnosed cases among the 2006 biomarker group was small, only
24:725:58530:20:20:108:504:634:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:about 1.5 percent in the case of the high BP card and 0.7 percent with high A1c. Subsequent
24:726:58621:20:20:108:504:614:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:patterns in self-reported doctor’s diagnosis suggest either that significant shares were false
24:727:58715:20:20:108:504:594:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:positives or that respondents or their doctors did not find the information salient. Applying
24:728:58808:20:20:108:504:574:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the observed increases in diagnosis rates by 2008 to the prevalence of abnormal screens
24:729:58895:20:20:108:504:554:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:among those without a diagnosis produces estimates of the lower bound of undiagnosed
24:730:58979:20:20:108:476:534:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:disease prevalence in the 2006 sample overall of only 0.3 percent for each of the two.
24:731:59065:20:20:122:503:514:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Behavioral adjustment was apparent and arguably strongest among undiagnosed diabet-
24:732:59148:20:20:108:504:494:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:ics with high A1c, and it also appeared among spouses of these and other respondents. The
24:733:59237:20:20:108:504:474:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:0.7 percent of respondents with high A1c and without a diabetes diagnosis reported losing
24:734:59326:20:20:108:504:454:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:an average of 2.2 percent of their body weight by the following wave, and they also reported
24:735:59418:20:20:108:504:434:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:less drinking and more frequent exercise. Trends in objective measures of weight, collected
24:736:59509:20:19:108:504:414:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:in 2006 and again in 2010, lend support to this finding but are not definitive. Spouses of
24:737:59599:19:20:108:504:395:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:undiagnosed respondents with high A1c also reported increased frequency of light exercise,
24:738:59689:20:20:108:504:375:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:roughly in line with what their partners reported. These patterns were not found among
24:739:59775:20:20:108:504:355:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the 4.7 percent with high A1c who were already known diabetics, who instead suffered dete-
24:740:59865:20:20:108:504:335:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:riorations in self-reported disability rates and health status. Interestingly, spouses of these
24:741:59960:20:20:108:504:315:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:diabetics reported reductions in their own weight of 1.5 percent, even while spouses of the
24:742:60051:20:20:108:504:295:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:undiagnosed with high A1c reported effectively no weight loss. Exercise and drinking among
24:743:60141:20:20:108:504:275:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:these spouses of noncompliers was unaffected, which could indicate that their weight loss
24:744:60230:20:20:108:504:255:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:came through a change in diet, which the HRS does not measure. Were that the case, it
24:745:60315:20:20:108:504:235:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:would suggest households may take a multi-staged approach to diabetes management, fo-
24:746:60400:20:20:108:504:215:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:cusing at first on exercise and then later on diet. Signs of rising disability among those with
24:747:60495:20:20:108:504:195:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:uncontrolled diabetes imply that such a strategy may become more feasible than exercise
24:748:60582:20:20:108:266:175:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:promotion as the disease progresses.
24:749:60618:20:20:122:503:155:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:In contrast, changes in behavior were more visible among noncompliers who received
24:750:60700:20:19:108:504:135:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the high BP card than among the undiagnosed who received it. This might be expected
24:751:60783:19:0:108:504:116:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:if high blood pressure is viewed as less serious at onset than is type 2 diabetes, which
25:752:60873:0:20:108:504:674:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:seems plausible. Respondents already diagnosed with high blood pressure who received the
25:753:60961:20:20:108:504:654:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:high BP card appeared to significantly reduce their smoking, by 2.3 percentage points or
25:754:61049:20:20:108:504:634:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:about one fifth of the baseline prevalence, and also reduced their drinking intensity. Their
25:755:61141:20:20:108:504:614:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:frequency of light exercise actually fell, possibly reflecting a reallocation of household chores
25:756:61238:20:20:108:504:594:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:away from the respondent. Although they did not report picking up the slack, spouses of
25:757:61325:20:20:108:504:574:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:these respondents did report less binge drinking, mirroring the effects of the screen on own
25:758:61417:20:20:108:423:554:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:behavior and suggesting that binge drinking tends to be a joint activity.
25:759:61490:20:20:122:503:534:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Exactly why uncontrolled high blood pressure appears to trigger changes in own behavior
25:760:61577:20:20:108:504:514:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:while uncontrolled diabetes apparently does not remains somewhat of an open question.
25:761:61662:20:20:108:504:494:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Only a very small share of respondents with high A1c are likely to be type 1 or lifelong
25:762:61750:20:20:108:504:474:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:diabetics, probably less than 1 percent. It is conceivable that diabetic HRS respondents
25:763:61838:20:20:108:504:454:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and their doctors may have set A1c targets above 7.0. The reason for the asymmetry may
25:764:61924:20:20:108:504:434:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:well be rising disability among those with uncontrolled diabetes, which presumably impedes
25:765:62014:20:19:108:504:414:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:exercise. Smoking is addictive, which may explain why it does not appear to respond even
25:766:62102:19:20:108:504:395:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:though it probably should be a part of diabetes control (Gunton et al., 2002). Drinking
25:767:62189:20:20:108:504:375:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:is already reduced among this subsample, per Table1, and may not be easy to lower any
25:768:62274:20:20:108:141:355:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:further.
25:769:62282:20:20:122:504:335:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:As Tables1 and 3 reveal, the characteristics of respondents with high A1c suggest that
25:770:62368:20:20:107:504:315:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:uncontrolled diabetes is a condition associated with minority identity and lower socioe-
25:771:62456:20:20:107:503:295:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:conomic status.  Whether these characteristics are important for behavior because they
25:772:62542:20:20:107:503:275:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:constrain choices or because they alter preferences is a perennial question in health eco-
25:773:62632:20:20:107:503:255:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:nomics, and the present study offers no new insights. With added detail from the restricted
25:774:62723:20:20:107:503:235:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:HRS geocodes file, perhaps elucidating neighborhood characteristics, some headway might
25:775:62810:20:20:107:503:215:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:be made in understanding the determinants of response and nonresponse to notifications.
25:776:62897:20:20:107:503:195:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:More work could also be done to examine psychological covariates of these behaviors, since
25:777:62987:20:20:107:503:175:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the EFTF interviews during biomarker waves ended with the interviewers’ leaving behind
25:778:63073:20:20:107:338:155:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:new “lifestyle” questionnaires on psychosocial topics.
25:779:63127:20:19:122:503:135:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Ultimately, these data may thus provide insights about preventable hospitalizations
25:780:63210:19:0:107:503:116:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:among older Americans, some of which are attributable to uncontrolled hypertension or
26:781:63297:0:20:108:504:674:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:diabetes, especially among poor communities, and to access to care (Bindman et al., 1995;
26:782:63386:20:20:108:504:654:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Jiang, Russo and Barrett, 2009). Although it does not ask separately about emergency room
26:783:63475:20:20:108:504:634:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:visits, the HRS does ask about the frequency of overnight hospitalization between waves,
26:784:63563:20:20:108:504:614:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:which was highest in 2006 among subsets of “noncompliers” with very high BP or high
26:785:63646:20:20:108:504:594:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:A1c and a preexisting diagnosis. Known diabetics with high A1c in 2006 were significantly
26:786:63735:20:20:108:504:574:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:more likely to report overnight hospitalization (panel FE coefficient of 0.096,t-stat of 3.58)
26:787:63829:20:20:108:504:554:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and more stays (0.170,t-stat of 2.11) in 2008. But it is unclear what to draw from this,
26:788:63917:20:20:108:504:534:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:besides motivation for a fuller assessment of their characteristics and what drives them to
26:789:64008:20:20:108:477:514:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:hospitalization compared with other diabetics. I leave such efforts for future inquiry.
26:790:64095:20:20:122:504:494:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:One coefficient in Table5 suggests that low HDL cholesterol screens may trigger a
26:791:64176:20:20:108:504:474:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:doubling of the typical 2-year increase in new diabetes prevalence. It seems wise not to
26:792:64264:20:20:108:504:454:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:place much emphasis on a single result like this, especially when there appears to be no
26:793:64352:20:20:108:504:434:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:connection between high cholesterol screens and subsequent diabetes. But it is interesting
26:794:64442:20:19:108:500:414:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:in light of concerns about statins (Sattar et al., 2010) and is probably worth future study.
26:795:64534:19:20:122:504:395:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Stepping back, important questions are whether these behavioral responses to biomarker
26:796:64620:20:20:108:504:375:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:notification are empirically important on average and thus potentially policy relevant. The
26:797:64711:20:20:108:504:355:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:intent-to-treat estimates of the average impacts of biomarker collection in the sample are
26:798:64801:20:20:108:504:335:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:effectively zero, except insofar as they may reduce doctor visits and medication usage by 1 or
26:799:64895:20:20:108:504:315:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:2 percent, and this must be because screening does not generate much salient information on
26:800:64986:20:20:108:504:295:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:average. Undiagnosed “rare and dangerous” conditions are uncommon in the sample, and
26:801:65070:20:20:108:504:275:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:while uncontrolled conditions are less rare, it appears that notification of their uncontrolled
26:802:65165:20:20:108:504:255:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:nature does not change behavior by a lot.  Averaged across all respondents, a policy of
26:803:65252:20:20:108:504:235:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:collecting biomarkers and informing about results and normal ranges will have few tangible
26:804:65342:20:20:108:504:215:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:effects because those treated by salient information are a small subset, and while their
26:805:65430:20:20:108:504:195:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:conditions change, they do not change drastically. A more targeted intervention would have
26:806:65520:20:20:108:504:175:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:larger average effects. A question I leave for future study is whether a policy of screening
26:807:65612:20:20:108:503:155:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:based on observable characteristics like those in Table3 could produce average treatment
26:808:65700:20:19:108:504:135:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:effects that would be worth the costs.  Certainly these findings suggest there are unmet
26:809:65788:19:0:107:503:116:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:surveillance and care needs among Americans aged 50 and over, but they appear to be
27:810:65873:0:20:108:315:674:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:concentrated among relatively small subgroups.
27:811:65919:20:20:122:504:654:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Akey methodological question is whether these effects on those treated by the notifi-
27:812:66004:20:20:108:504:634:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:cations are in fact attributable to notification and thus to the intervention as defined by
27:813:66095:20:20:108:504:614:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:collecting biomarkers and notifying abnormal screens, or whether they instead simply reflect
27:814:66187:20:20:108:504:594:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the impacts of the biomarker levels themselves and thus would have happened regardless.
27:815:66274:20:20:108:504:574:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Because all respondents who screen abnormally were also notified, there is no way to an-
27:816:66362:20:20:108:504:554:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:swer this question to the standards of a randomized controlled trial. But my reading of the
27:817:66453:20:20:108:504:534:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:evidence is that these effects are indeed associated with the arrival of information and not
27:818:66545:20:20:108:504:514:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the biomarker level. Key results pass the falsification test of contemporaneous association,
27:819:66637:20:20:108:504:494:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and the robustness of results across specifications and samples lends further credence to the
27:820:66730:20:20:108:504:474:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:view that the effects are causal. Further examination of this question with the 2008 results
27:821:66822:20:20:108:256:454:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:may shed more light on the topic.
27:822:66855:20:20:122:503:434:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:The impacts of biomarker notification on economic outcomes presumably via their inter-
27:823:66941:20:19:108:504:414:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:mediate effects on health may be interesting to explore. Labor supply and spending might
27:824:67029:19:20:108:504:395:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:respond to screens out of normal range if they produce new health conditions, and the HRS
27:825:67118:20:20:108:504:375:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:panel includes respondents who are not yet retired. Labor force participation among HRS
27:826:67205:20:20:108:504:355:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:respondents with high A1c screens was about the sample average of 54 percent, while it was
27:827:67295:20:20:108:504:335:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:about 62 percent among those who received the high BP card. For those under age 65 in
27:828:67380:20:20:108:504:315:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:the U.S., of course, the onset of a new health condition might actually increase participa-
27:829:67471:20:20:108:504:295:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:tion for insurance purposes, as long as disability permits working. New disease onset before
27:830:67563:20:20:108:464:275:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:retirement seems likely either to generate precautionary saving or financial stress.
27:831:67647:20:20:122:503:255:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:Implications of these results range from practical insights to new understanding of be-
27:832:67734:20:20:108:504:235:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:havior and unmet health services needs in the U.S. population around the age at retirement,
27:833:67825:20:20:108:504:215:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:and ultimately to informing policy. Methodologically, this research contributes the insight
27:834:67916:20:20:108:504:195:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:that the strong correlation between biomarker collection and mode of interview will proba-
27:835:68006:20:20:108:504:175:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:bly affect self-reported measures. Collecting biomarkers in a cross-sectional survey like the
27:836:68099:20:20:108:504:155:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:core NHANES will affect self reports relative to a telephone survey but not relative to itself,
27:837:68194:20:19:108:504:135:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:if all respondents are interviewed in person. Panel studies like HRS, Add Health, and others
27:838:68286:19:0:108:467:116:10:g_d0_f3:10:g_d0_f3:that include biomarking in some but not all waves are more likely to be impacted.

36:1052:80983:10:9:108:504:225:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:HRS file version L. The universe is all individuals randomly selected to submit biomarkers in 2006, including
36:1053:81092:9:10:108:504:216:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:blood pressure (BP), blood sugar (A1c), total and HDL or “good” cholesterol, and other measures, who were
36:1054:81197:10:9:108:504:206:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:also present in the 2008 wave. The second column shows respondents who submitted any biomarkers at all,
36:1055:81300:9:9:108:504:197:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:including the physical measures such as grip, breath, and balance. Respondents in the third column received
36:1056:81407:9:10:108:504:188:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:the High BP card if the minimum blood pressure out of three measures exceeded 160 mmHg systolic or 110
36:1057:81509:10:9:108:504:178:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:diastolic. Those in the fourth column had minimum blood pressure outside the recommended ranges of 120

36:1059:81714:10:9:108:504:159:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:A1c readings of 7.0 percent or higher. Respondents in the sixth column had total cholesterol readings of
36:1060:81818:9:10:108:504:150:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:200 mg/dL or higher. Those in the seventh column had HDL cholesterol readings below 40 mg/dL. For the
36:1061:81919:10:9:108:504:140:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:2006 prevalence of high BP, diabetes, and heart problems, I report the raw responses, in which respondents
36:1062:82025:9:10:108:504:131:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:can dispute reports from previous waves. New incidence is calculated using respondents’ current statements
36:1063:82131:10:9:108:504:121:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:about present and past conditions, which they may have updated. Average intensive measures of smoking
36:1064:82232:9:0:108:336:112:8:g_d0_f6:8:g_d0_f6:and drinking are calculated by assigning zeros to abstentions.
