2:28:1380:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:Human  capital,  including  health  and  nutrition,  has  played  a  key  role  in  the  literature  on  poverty 
2:29:1493:14:14:72:545:574:12:Times:12:Times:traps. Economic  shocks  that  affect  human  capital  during  early  life  are  thought  to  translate  into 
2:30:1602:14:14:72:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:permanently reduced  levels  of  human  capital  and,  thereby,  push  individuals  into  poverty.  Three 
2:31:1707:14:14:72:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:potential  concerns in  this  literature  are  explored  with  empirical  evidence  drawn  from  primary 
2:32:1811:14:14:72:546:532:12:Times:12:Times:longitudinal  survey  data collected  before  and  after  two  major  shocks  in  Indonesia:  the  1998 
2:33:1914:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:financial crisis and the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. First, it is very hard to identify shocks that are 
2:34:2016:14:14:72:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:unanticipated  and  uncorrelated  with other  factors  that  affect  human  capital  outcomes.  Second, 
2:35:2119:14:14:72:545:490:12:Times:12:Times:and  related,  there  is  abundant  evidence  that individuals,  families  and  communities  invest  in 
2:36:2222:14:14:72:546:476:12:Times:12:Times:strategies that are designed to mitigate the impact of such shocks. The nature and effectiveness of 
2:37:2321:14:14:72:545:462:12:Times:12:Times:the myriad array of these behaviors vary with the context in ways that are not straightforward to 
2:38:2418:14:14:72:546:448:12:Times:12:Times:measure  or  model.  Third,  the  impacts  of  shocks  on  human  capital outcomes  in  the  short  and 
2:39:2521:14:14:72:545:434:12:Times:12:Times:longer-term  may  differ  precisely  because  of  the  behavioral  changes  of  individuals and  their 
2:40:2623:14:14:72:545:420:12:Times:12:Times:families  so  that  drawing  inferences  about  the  longer-term  impacts  based  on  negative  impacts in 
2:41:2729:14:14:72:546:406:12:Times:12:Times:the  short  term  can  be  very  misleading.  The  picture  of  remarkable  resilience  that  emerges  from 
2:42:2837:14:14:72:546:392:12:Times:12:Times:investigating the  impacts  of  major  shocks  on  child  health  and  human  capital  in  Indonesia  is 
2:43:2941:14:42:72:196:378:12:Times:12:Times:nothing short of stunning.

3:58:3207:0:22:72:159:714:195:Times:195:Times:1. Introduction 
3:59:3223:22:21:108:523:692:144:Times:144:Times: Nutrition, health and human capital have played a key role in the literature on poverty 
3:60:3311:21:21:71:534:671:144:Times:144:Times:traps. The nutrition wage hypothesis posits that agricultural workers could earn a wage that was 
3:61:3408:21:21:72:531:650:144:Times:144:Times:so low they would be trapped in a recurring cycle of poverty in which they were unable to feed 
3:62:3503:21:20:72:528:629:144:Times:144:Times:themselves sufficiently well to sustain the productivity necessary to be able to climb out of the 
3:63:3601:20:21:72:517:609:144:Times:144:Times:poverty trap. The model was among the early descriptions of poverty traps and underlies the 
3:64:3693:21:21:72:540:588:144:Times:144:Times:larger literature on the efficiency wage hypothesis (Liebenstein, 1957; Mazumdar, 1959; Shapiro 
3:65:3789:21:20:72:525:567:144:Times:144:Times:and Stiglitz, 1984). Investments in human capital, broadly defined to include nutrition, health, 
3:66:3886:20:21:72:490:547:144:Times:144:Times:education and cognition, have been shown to be central mechanisms through which an 
3:67:3969:21:21:72:540:526:144:Times:144:Times:individual, family, community and state may be lifted out of poverty and out of enduring poverty 
3:68:4066:21:20:72:104:505:144:Times:144:Times:traps.  
3:69:4074:20:21:108:540:485:144:Times:144:Times: A large theoretical and empirical literature links shocks to poverty and poverty traps. The 
3:70:4166:21:21:72:525:464:144:Times:144:Times:loss of resources because of an unanticipated negative shock results in a spiral down into ever 
3:71:4262:21:21:72:522:443:144:Times:144:Times:greater poverty because of a loss of earnings capacity (due to, for example, a health shock), a 
3:72:4358:21:20:72:524:422:144:Times:144:Times:greater debt burden (to cover the costs of the losses associated with the shock) or the loss of a 
3:73:4456:20:21:72:537:402:144:Times:144:Times:productive asset that an individual simply cannot replace (because of a lack of liquidity or credit 
3:74:4556:21:21:72:383:381:144:Times:144:Times:markets or because the asset is not worth the replacement cost).  
3:75:4622:21:20:108:541:360:144:Times:144:Times: The goal of this research is to evaluate some of the evidence on the links between shocks, 
3:76:4713:20:21:72:538:340:144:Times:144:Times:on one hand, and health and human capital outcomes, on the other hand. We focus on the impact 
3:77:4807:21:21:72:533:319:144:Times:144:Times:of shocks on human capital during early life and examine the extent to which the human capital 
3:78:4902:21:20:72:531:298:144:Times:144:Times:of populations and population sub-groups display resilience in the face of an adverse economic 
3:79:4997:20:21:72:106:278:144:Times:144:Times:shock. 
3:80:5004:21:21:108:532:257:144:Times:144:Times: Three main points emerge. First, it is very hard to identify shocks that are unanticipated 
3:81:5095:21:21:72:520:236:144:Times:144:Times:and uncorrelated with other factors that affect human capital investments and outcomes. One 
3:82:5187:21:20:72:501:215:144:Times:144:Times:reason is that investing in child human capital is universally recognized as important and 
3:83:5278:20:21:72:515:195:144:Times:144:Times:individuals and families are likely to attempt to mitigate the impact of shocks on the human 
3:84:5371:21:21:72:527:174:144:Times:144:Times:capital of the next generation. This is our second point: establishing generalizable evidence on 
3:85:5468:21:20:72:505:153:144:Times:144:Times:the impact of a shock is complicated by the fact that there may be behavioral responses to 
3:86:5559:20:21:72:523:133:144:Times:144:Times:mitigate the impact of the shock and the nature and effectiveness of those behaviors will vary 
3:87:5654:21:21:72:523:112:144:Times:144:Times:with the context in ways that are not straightforward to predict or model. Third, even in cases 
3:88:5750:21:20:72:513:91:144:Times:144:Times:that seem relatively straightforward to model, the impacts of shocks on child human capital 
3:89:5842:20:0:72:537:71:144:Times:144:Times:outcomes in the short and longer-term may differ precisely because of the behavioral changes of 
4:90:5940:0:21:72:529:716:144:Times:144:Times:individuals, families and communities it response to the shock. As a result, drawing inferences 
4:91:6036:21:21:72:489:695:144:Times:144:Times:about the longer-term impacts based on negative impacts in the short term can be very 
4:92:6122:21:20:72:134:674:144:Times:144:Times:misleading.  
4:93:6135:20:23:72:75:654:144:Times:144:Times: 
4:94:6135:23:22:72:355:631:195:Times:195:Times:2. Early life shocks and human capital in later life 
4:95:6188:22:21:108:529:609:144:Times:144:Times: Many studies have investigated impacts of early life shocks on later life outcomes. The 
4:96:6276:21:21:72:541:588:144:Times:144:Times:earliest shocks an individual will experience, those that occur in utero, have been linked to health 
4:97:6377:21:20:71:521:567:144:Times:144:Times:in adulthood. Building on a foundation in biology, and drawing on evidence from animal and 
4:98:6468:20:21:71:528:547:144:Times:144:Times:human models, in a very creative body of research, Barker describes the impact on the fetus of 
4:99:6563:21:21:72:531:526:144:Times:144:Times:nutrition insults at specific times during the pregnancy. As an example, he elucidates pathways 
4:100:6659:21:20:72:516:505:144:Times:144:Times:from a shock at the time when arteries are being developed in utero to hardened arteries and 
4:101:6752:20:21:72:528:485:144:Times:144:Times:coronary heart disease in mid- life (Barker, 1995). Links between in utero shocks, birthweight, 
4:102:6848:21:21:72:420:464:144:Times:144:Times:adult health and premature mortality have all been widely documented.  
4:103:6919:21:21:108:542:443:144:Times:144:Times: For example, influential research has exploited the timing of ration restrictions because of 
4:104:7012:21:20:71:532:422:144:Times:144:Times:the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands during the second World War to establish the impact of 
4:105:7106:20:21:72:534:402:144:Times:144:Times:nutrition shocks on health and well-being in adulthood. Critically important for this research on 
4:106:7204:21:21:71:514:381:144:Times:144:Times:the Dutch Hunger is that rations were restricted in areas where the resistance was active but 
4:107:7298:21:20:71:515:360:144:Times:144:Times:rations were not changed in other areas, so that women who were pregnant and living in the 
4:108:7389:20:21:72:518:340:144:Times:144:Times:resistance areas experienced a negative nutrition shock while pregnant women in other areas 
4:109:7481:21:21:72:538:319:144:Times:144:Times:served as controls. The restriction of rations in the resistance areas was not anticipated and short-
4:110:7582:21:20:72:532:298:144:Times:144:Times:lived; there was very limited scope for moving to avoid the restrictions. Assuming women who 
4:111:7675:20:21:72:511:278:144:Times:144:Times:were pregnant at the time and living in the resistance areas are exchangeable with pregnant 
4:112:7767:21:21:72:515:257:144:Times:144:Times:women living in other areas in the Netherlands, it is possible to identify a casual effect of in 
4:113:7864:21:21:72:539:236:144:Times:144:Times:utero nutrition shocks through comparisons of birth and later health outcomes of those who were 
4:114:7960:21:20:72:172:215:144:Times:144:Times:in utero at the time.  
4:115:7983:20:21:108:530:195:144:Times:144:Times: Moreover, as predicted by Barker, the precise timing of the nutrition insults plays a key 
4:116:8073:21:21:72:509:174:144:Times:144:Times:role. Research on the impact of the Dutch Hunger finds that those who were exposed early 
4:117:8162:21:20:72:515:153:144:Times:144:Times:during the fetal period were at elevated risks of obesity, lipid dysregulation, cardio-vascular 
4:118:8258:20:21:72:541:133:144:Times:144:Times:disease and premature mortality. They were also less likely to be working in their fifties although 
4:119:8358:21:21:72:505:112:144:Times:144:Times:there does not appear to have been any impact on earnings of those who were working. In 
4:120:8446:21:20:72:534:91:144:Times:144:Times:contrast, those who were exposed only towards the end of the gestation period were more likely 
4:121:8541:20:0:72:543:71:144:Times:144:Times:to be born small but there is little evidence that adult health or economic outcomes were affected, 
5:122:8643:0:21:72:526:716:144:Times:144:Times:(Ravelli et al, 1998; Ravelli et al, 1999; Roseboom et al, 2001; Rooij et al, 2010, Scholte et al, 
5:123:8742:21:21:72:109:695:144:Times:144:Times:2015).  
5:124:8750:21:20:108:531:674:144:Times:144:Times: This evidence is consistent with programming in utero to develop a “thrifty phenotype” 
5:125:8837:20:21:71:514:654:144:Times:144:Times:as an adaptive response to nutrition insults (Hales and Barker, 1992). Specifically, nutrition 
5:126:8932:21:21:72:535:633:144:Times:144:Times:deprivation early during gestation programs the fetus to adapt to the environment and extract all 
5:127:9030:21:21:72:530:612:144:Times:144:Times:the nutrients possible from the placenta. Having been programmed to do this in utero, the body 
5:128:9125:21:20:72:525:591:144:Times:144:Times:continues to maximize nutrient absorption after birth which results in poor health outcomes in 
5:129:9220:20:21:72:529:571:144:Times:144:Times:later life. Nutrition deprivation towards the end of gestation does not cause the same type of re-
5:130:9318:21:21:72:143:550:144:Times:144:Times:programming. 
5:131:9331:21:20:108:528:529:144:Times:144:Times: Many studies have investigated the longer-term consequences of in utero insults using, 
5:132:9418:20:21:72:524:509:144:Times:144:Times:for example, variation in rainfall, famines, infectious disease prevalence or virulence (such as 
5:133:9515:21:21:72:528:488:144:Times:144:Times:zika, ebola or influenza), terrorist attacks, civil conflicts and, weather-related and other natural 
5:134:9616:21:20:71:476:467:144:Times:144:Times:disasters. The key issue with any natural experiment is that the variation underlying 
5:135:9702:20:21:71:509:447:144:Times:144:Times:identification of the causal effect must be outside the control of the mother, her family and 
5:136:9796:21:21:71:415:426:144:Times:144:Times:society more broadly. In some cases, this calls for strong assumptions.  
5:137:9869:21:21:108:541:405:144:Times:144:Times: As an example, studies have exploited the timing of Ramadan, the month of fasting in the 
5:138:9958:21:20:71:504:384:144:Times:144:Times:Muslim calendar, to identify a causal effect of nutrition deprivation in utero (Almond and 
5:139:10049:20:21:72:540:364:144:Times:144:Times:Mazumder, 2011; Almond, Mazumder and van Ewijk, 2015; van Ewijk, 2011). There are at least 
5:140:10140:21:21:72:527:343:144:Times:144:Times:three concerns with this line of inquiry. First, Ramadan occurs on an established calendar and, 
5:141:10236:21:20:72:536:322:144:Times:144:Times:give or take a day or two, its timing is known years in advance. In societies where contraception 
5:142:10334:20:21:72:501:302:144:Times:144:Times:is widespread, pregnancy timing is, at least in part, a choice. Second, it is permissible for 
5:143:10428:21:21:72:516:281:144:Times:144:Times:pregnant women not to fast if their own health or that of their baby is at risk. It is, therefore, 
5:144:10527:21:20:72:538:260:144:Times:144:Times:difficult to test whether the assumptions underlying the identification strategy of a causal impact 
5:145:10627:20:21:72:513:240:144:Times:144:Times:of in utero calorie restriction are met in the study populations. This is important because, in 
5:146:10723:21:21:72:534:219:144:Times:144:Times:general, studies in this literature report intent to treat estimates and if adherence to fasting is not 
5:147:10827:21:20:72:541:198:144:Times:144:Times:universal, it is not clear how to generalize the results. Moreover, the majority of these studies use 
5:148:10929:20:21:72:536:178:144:Times:144:Times:census or register data and thus examine very large samples in which case it is not clear that it is 
5:149:11030:21:21:72:524:157:144:Times:144:Times:appropriate to rely on a classical testing strategy that fixes the probability of rejecting the null 
5:150:11131:21:21:72:522:136:144:Times:144:Times:when it is correct at, say, 5 percent, so that the probability of rejecting the alternate when it is 
5:151:11232:21:20:72:509:115:144:Times:144:Times:correct becomes infinitesimally small.  If these studies were to adopt an information-based 
5:152:11324:20:21:72:508:95:144:Times:144:Times:criterion for model selection that trades off Type I and Type II errors, such as the Schwarz 
5:153:11417:21:21:72:525:74:144:Times:144:Times:criterion (Schwarz, 1978), then the estimated effects of Ramadan are typically not statistically 
5:154:11514:21:0:72:536:53:144:Times:144:Times:significant. Taking this and the fact that estimated effects are typically modest in magnitude, the 
6:155:11616:0:21:72:540:716:144:Times:144:Times:evidence that Ramadan affects later life cognition or education seems weaker than claimed in the 
6:156:11713:21:21:72:121:695:144:Times:144:Times:literature. 
6:157:11725:21:20:108:526:674:144:Times:144:Times: In a widely-cited and very influential study, Almond (2006) examines the impact of in 
6:158:11811:20:21:72:517:654:144:Times:144:Times:utero exposure to the 1918 influenza pandemic on education, work and income in adulthood 
6:159:11900:21:21:72:507:633:144:Times:144:Times:among those born in the U.S. This creative study combines the unanticipated nature of the 
6:160:11990:21:21:72:535:612:144:Times:144:Times:influenza pandemic in the fall of 1918 with census data and compares outcomes of birth cohorts 
6:161:12085:21:20:72:531:591:144:Times:144:Times:exposed to the pandemic in utero with surrounding birth cohorts. Almond concludes that males 
6:162:12178:20:21:72:537:571:144:Times:144:Times:who were exposed in utero completed fewer years of education, had lower income, poorer socio-
6:163:12271:21:21:72:501:550:144:Times:144:Times:economic status, received more in public transfers and were more likely to have physical 
6:164:12360:21:20:72:468:529:144:Times:144:Times:disabilities. Studies conducted in other countries have drawn similar conclusions.  
6:165:12444:20:21:108:506:509:144:Times:144:Times: A difficulty with this identification strategy is that there may be other, unobserved 
6:166:12530:21:21:72:535:488:144:Times:144:Times:differences between the affected cohort and the surrounding cohorts. This would seem plausible 
6:167:12625:21:20:72:521:467:144:Times:144:Times:given that the fall of 1918 was also the end of World War I. This point is made in Brown and 
6:168:12718:20:21:72:523:447:144:Times:144:Times:Thomas (2016) who demonstrate that the fathers of those who were in utero in the U.S. at the 
6:169:12811:21:21:72:522:426:144:Times:144:Times:time of the influenza pandemic tend to be lower SES than the fathers of the surrounding birth 
6:170:12905:21:21:72:532:405:144:Times:144:Times:cohorts. They also show that the same pattern is observed in other countries and likely explains 
6:171:13002:21:20:72:216:384:144:Times:144:Times:at least some of those results. 
6:172:13034:20:21:108:536:364:144:Times:144:Times: These examples are not intended to imply that there are no long-term consequences of in 
6:173:13122:21:21:72:530:343:144:Times:144:Times:utero shocks. Clearly, there are. Rather, the point is that even seemingly well-identified studies 
6:174:13221:21:20:72:541:322:144:Times:144:Times:may not be as well identified as they seem. Importantly, whereas several studies have established 
6:175:13319:20:21:72:526:302:144:Times:144:Times:that early life shocks have long term consequences on health, establishing that in utero shocks 
6:176:13415:21:21:72:508:281:144:Times:144:Times:have long-term impacts on education and socio-economic status, and, thus on poverty, has 
6:177:13504:21:20:72:316:260:144:Times:144:Times:proven to be somewhat more difficult to establish. 
6:178:13555:20:23:72:75:240:144:Times:144:Times: 
6:179:13555:23:22:72:413:217:195:Times:195:Times:3. Financial shocks, human capital and behavioral responses 
6:180:13615:22:21:108:530:195:144:Times:144:Times: A second concern that arises with interpreting results of studies of the impact of shocks 
6:181:13705:21:21:72:518:174:144:Times:144:Times:on human capital outcomes is that even if a shock is truly unanticipated and did not coincide 
6:182:13799:21:20:72:510:153:144:Times:144:Times:with other events that affected human capital, the impact of the shock may be mitigated by 
6:183:13890:20:21:72:540:133:144:Times:144:Times:behavioral responses of individuals, their families and their communities. This is important since 
6:184:13989:21:21:72:528:112:144:Times:144:Times:there is considerable evidence that children who are born into disadvantaged environments are 
6:185:14083:21:20:72:529:91:144:Times:144:Times:not necessarily destined to have poor human capital outcomes in adulthood. (See, for example, 
6:186:14177:20:0:72:161:71:144:Times:144:Times:Heckman, 2006.)  
7:187:14196:0:21:108:540:716:144:Times:144:Times: There are at least two concerns with inferences drawn under the assumption that there are 
7:188:14286:21:21:72:541:695:144:Times:144:Times:no behavioral responses to a shock. First, if individuals and their families invest in behaviors that 
7:189:14388:21:20:72:538:674:144:Times:144:Times:mitigate the impact of the shock on, say, human capital, the finding that the shock had no impact 
7:190:14486:20:21:72:539:654:144:Times:144:Times:on human capital outcomes in the immediate term may be misleading if the mitigating behaviors 
7:191:14580:21:21:71:541:633:144:Times:144:Times:affect future investments. For example, if a household liquidates assets when prices are relatively 
7:192:14680:21:21:71:526:612:144:Times:144:Times:low in order to keep a child in school, it is possible that the reduced long-run wealth will have 
7:193:14778:21:20:71:509:591:144:Times:144:Times:negative impacts on future well-being. Moreover, it is important to trace out these types of 
7:194:14871:20:21:71:534:571:144:Times:144:Times:responses in order to develop a fuller understanding of the impacts of shocks on human capital.  
7:195:14968:21:21:107:530:550:144:Times:144:Times: Second, if some individuals and families are more able to smooth the impact of a shock 
7:196:15055:21:20:71:542:529:144:Times:144:Times:than others, distributional impacts of the shock on human capital outcomes at a point in time may 
7:197:15153:20:21:71:538:509:144:Times:144:Times:not be informative about the incidence of the initial impact of the shock or about the longer-term 
7:198:15252:21:21:71:205:488:144:Times:144:Times:consequences of the shock. 
7:199:15279:21:20:107:531:467:144:Times:144:Times: These concerns are illustrated using empirical evidence from one example of the global 
7:200:15366:20:21:71:531:447:144:Times:144:Times:financial crisis that occurred at the end of the 20th century. Specifically, we focus on Indonesia, 
7:201:15466:21:21:71:536:426:144:Times:144:Times:the country that experienced the most disruption as a result of the East Asian financial crisis and 
7:202:15566:21:21:72:522:405:144:Times:144:Times:draw on longitudinal data that we collected specifically to measure the impact of the crisis on 
7:203:15662:21:20:72:537:384:144:Times:144:Times:individual, household and family behavior as well as trace out behavioral responses to the crisis. 
7:204:15761:20:21:72:509:364:144:Times:144:Times:For a discussion of other external shocks see, for example, Darnto-Hill and Cogill ( 2010). 
7:205:15853:21:22:72:75:343:144:Times:144:Times: 
7:206:15853:22:21:72:266:321:170:Times:170:Times:The 1998 Indonesian financial crisis 
7:207:15890:21:21:108:528:300:144:Times:144:Times:  After almost three decades of sustained economic growth, of all the East Asian countries 
7:208:15979:21:20:72:528:279:144:Times:144:Times:Indonesia was hit the hardest by the 1997 financial crisis. As shown in Figure 1a, the Indonesian 
7:209:16077:20:21:72:541:259:144:Times:144:Times:rupiah came under pressure in the last half of 1997 when the exchange rate began showing signs of 
7:210:16175:21:21:72:534:238:144:Times:144:Times:weakness. The rupiah fell from around 2,400 per US$ in the middle of the year to about 4,800 per 
7:211:16272:21:21:72:535:217:144:Times:144:Times:US$ by the end of 1997. In January 1998, the rupiah collapsed. Over the course of a few days, the 
7:212:16370:21:20:72:525:196:144:Times:144:Times:exchange rate fell by a factor of three to Rp 15,000 per US$. Although it soon recovered, by the 
7:213:16467:20:21:72:533:176:144:Times:144:Times:middle of the year the rupiah had slumped back to the lows of January, 1998. By the end of 1998, 
7:214:16564:21:21:72:540:155:144:Times:144:Times:the rupiah had strengthened to around Rp 8,000 per US$. No other East Asian country experienced 
7:215:16660:21:20:71:330:134:144:Times:144:Times:as deep or as prolonged a decline in the exchange rate. 
7:216:16716:20:21:107:518:114:144:Times:144:Times: Interest rates in Indonesia behaved much like the exchange rate: they spiked in August 
7:217:16803:21:21:71:534:93:144:Times:144:Times:1997 -- when they quadrupled -- and they remained extremely volatile through all of 1998. Chaos 
7:218:16899:21:0:71:520:72:144:Times:144:Times:reigned in the banking sector and several major banks were taken over by the Indonesian Bank 
8:219:16994:0:21:72:538:716:144:Times:144:Times:Restructuring Agency. All of this turmoil has wreaked havoc with both the confidence of investors 
8:220:17092:21:21:72:509:695:144:Times:144:Times:and the availability of credit. Asset prices collapsed – both in the stock market and real asset 
8:221:17189:21:20:72:148:674:144:Times:144:Times:including land.  
8:222:17206:20:21:108:528:654:144:Times:144:Times: Simultaneously, there was dramatic transformation in the political sector. Protests across 
8:223:17297:21:21:72:526:633:144:Times:144:Times:the country that began in January 1998 culminated in May 1998 with Suharto’s resignation after 
8:224:17392:21:21:72:503:612:144:Times:144:Times:three decades in power. Uncertainty in the country was widespread and while the incoming 
8:225:17481:21:20:72:542:591:144:Times:144:Times:president, Habibie, declared that multi-party elections would be held, it was very difficult to predict 
8:226:17585:20:21:72:532:571:144:Times:144:Times:whether the elections would, in fact, be held, whether the outcome would result in further turmoil 
8:227:17684:21:21:72:512:550:144:Times:144:Times:and whether there would be any fundamental change in the political sphere. It turned out that 
8:228:17778:21:20:72:527:529:144:Times:144:Times:Suharto’s resignation presaged the ushering in of democracy in Indonesia – an outcome that few 
8:229:17873:20:21:71:248:509:144:Times:144:Times:predicted at the time (Fisman, 2001). 
8:230:17911:21:21:107:536:488:144:Times:144:Times: The 1998 financial and political crisis was a major shock. Overall, GDP per capita in 1998 
8:231:18002:21:20:71:539:467:144:Times:144:Times:was about 15% below its level in 1997 (Figure 1b). This downturn is about the same  magnitude as 
8:232:18099:20:21:71:534:447:144:Times:144:Times:the Great Depression in the U.S.; by contrast, GDP per capita declined by less than 5% during the 
8:233:18197:21:21:71:530:426:144:Times:144:Times:2008 Great Recession. The Indonesian crisis was not only large; it was also largely unanticipated 
8:234:18295:21:21:71:426:405:144:Times:144:Times:and, certainly, its severity was a shock both inside and outside the country. 
8:235:18373:21:20:107:535:384:144:Times:144:Times: In January 1998, the IMF described Indonesia’s economic situation as “worrisome” (IMF, 
8:236:18460:20:21:71:521:364:144:Times:144:Times:1998) and, at the same, the Indonesian government announced policies to address the situation, 
8:237:18555:21:21:71:515:343:144:Times:144:Times:predicting economic growth for 1998 would be zero. Indeed, the president of the World Bank 
8:238:18646:21:20:71:540:322:144:Times:144:Times:summed up the situation in July 1998 saying “we were caught up in the enthusiasm of Indonesia.  I 
8:239:18744:20:21:71:465:302:144:Times:144:Times:am not alone in thinking that 12 months ago, Indonesia was on a very good path.”   
8:240:18827:21:21:107:522:281:144:Times:144:Times: One way to summarize the impact of the crisis on the lives of Indonesians is through its 
8:241:18916:21:20:71:528:260:144:Times:144:Times:impact on prices. Prices of many commodities spiraled upwards during the first three quarters of 
8:242:19013:20:21:71:535:240:144:Times:144:Times:1998. As shown in Figure 2, according to Statistics Indonesia, annual inflation was between 5 and 
8:243:19111:21:21:71:538:219:144:Times:144:Times:10% from the early 1980s to 1997. In 1998 inflation rocketed to an unprecedented 80% in a matter 
8:244:19208:21:20:71:523:198:144:Times:144:Times:of months. Subsidies were removed from several key goods, most notably rice, oil and fuel, the 
8:245:19303:20:21:71:505:178:144:Times:144:Times:prices of which were pegged by the government at levels below world prices. As the rupiah 
8:246:19393:21:21:71:516:157:144:Times:144:Times:collapsed, those subsidies became unsustainable and were scaled back along with other public 
8:247:19486:21:21:71:509:136:144:Times:144:Times:expenditures. Food prices, driven primarily by the rise in the price of the staple, rice, rose by 
8:248:19584:21:20:71:367:115:144:Times:144:Times:120%, which is about 50% more than the general price index.  
8:249:19645:20:21:108:541:95:144:Times:144:Times: Net food consumers were severely impacted by the crisis whereas net food producers either 
8:250:19735:21:0:71:528:74:144:Times:144:Times:received some protection or possibly benefited from the crisis. The financial crisis provided new 
9:251:19835:0:21:72:541:716:144:Times:144:Times:opportunities in the export sector, but it was a major negative shock for those on fixed incomes and 
9:252:19936:21:21:72:237:695:144:Times:144:Times:those outside the tradeable sector.  
9:253:19973:21:21:72:75:674:144:Times:144:Times: 
9:254:19973:21:22:72:332:653:170:Times:170:Times:Immediate impacts on child health and education 
9:255:20020:22:21:108:523:631:144:Times:144:Times: To provide empirical evidence on the immediate impacts of the shock on human capital 
9:256:20105:21:20:72:528:610:144:Times:144:Times:outcomes, we draw on data from the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS) that were specifically 
9:257:20199:20:21:72:515:590:144:Times:144:Times:designed to provide evidence on this question. The second wave, IFLS2, was fielded between 
9:258:20290:21:21:72:542:569:144:Times:144:Times:August 1997 and February 1998. The main fieldwork was completed by mid-December 1997 and a 
9:259:20381:21:20:72:512:548:144:Times:144:Times:small number of very difficult tracking cases were completed in January and February, 1998. 
9:260:20473:20:21:72:541:528:144:Times:144:Times:Because of the political and financial crisis, we decided to conduct a special rapid-response survey, 
9:261:20575:21:21:72:521:507:144:Times:144:Times:IFLS2+, between August and December 1998 in order to provide a snap-shot of the immediate 
9:262:20665:21:20:72:331:486:144:Times:144:Times:impact of the shock (Frankenberg and Thomas, 2000). 
9:263:20717:20:21:108:541:466:144:Times:144:Times: It was imperative to put IFLS2+ in the field without delay in order to measure the impact of 
9:264:20810:21:21:72:523:445:144:Times:144:Times:the onset of the crisis. Since it was not possible to mount an entire wave of IFLS in a short time-
9:265:20909:21:21:72:538:424:144:Times:144:Times:frame, for IFLS2+ we selected a sample of one in four enumeration areas that were included in the 
9:266:21007:21:20:72:521:403:144:Times:144:Times:1993 IFLS baseline. IFLS2+ collected information from all the respondents who were living in 
9:267:21100:20:21:72:529:383:144:Times:144:Times:those enumeration areas at the baseline, including those who had moved away. This is important 
9:268:21195:21:21:72:341:362:144:Times:144:Times:because migration was a potential response to the crisis.  
9:269:21254:21:20:107:517:341:144:Times:144:Times: IFLS2 returned to the baseline enumeration area and interviewed every member of the 
9:270:21338:20:21:72:521:321:144:Times:144:Times:baseline households in the community. Baseline respondents who had moved were tracked and 
9:271:21428:21:21:72:495:300:144:Times:144:Times:interviewed in the new location, along with the members of their new household. IFS2 re-
9:272:21516:21:20:72:522:279:144:Times:144:Times:interviewed at least one member of 94% of the baseline households (Thomas, Frankenberg and 
9:273:21607:20:21:72:145:259:144:Times:144:Times:Smith, 2001).   
9:274:21623:21:21:108:490:238:144:Times:144:Times: IFLS2+ followed the same protocols, returning to the location of each household 
9:275:21703:21:21:72:508:217:144:Times:144:Times:interviewed in IFLS2, interviewing all members and tracking movers to their new locations. 
9:276:21794:21:20:72:537:196:144:Times:144:Times:IFLS2+ interviewed at least one member of over 99% of the households interviewed in IFLS2 and 
9:277:21888:20:21:72:450:176:144:Times:144:Times:over 96% of all baseline households. (Frankenberg, Thomas and Beegle, 1999). 
9:278:21965:21:21:107:528:155:144:Times:144:Times: Data from IFLS2 and IFLS2+ provide a useful description of the magnitude of the shock 
9:279:22051:21:20:72:492:134:144:Times:144:Times:that households experienced. The ILO predicted that millions would join the ranks of the 
9:280:22140:20:21:72:523:114:144:Times:144:Times:unemployed because of the crisis and called for public works programs. Wage employment did 
9:281:22231:21:21:72:519:93:144:Times:144:Times:decline – but only by 2% -- and it was more than offset by an increase in the number of people 
9:282:22326:21:0:72:540:72:144:Times:144:Times:working in self-employment, particularly females who joined family businesses. With the dramatic 
10:283:22425:0:21:72:536:716:144:Times:144:Times:increase in the price of rice, the number of people working in the agricultural sector rose and there 
10:284:22527:21:21:71:505:695:144:Times:144:Times:was considerable migration from urban to rural areas. While the drama of the crisis was not 
10:285:22619:21:20:71:361:674:144:Times:144:Times:reflected in employment, it was reflected in hourly earnings.  
10:286:22682:20:21:107:517:654:144:Times:144:Times: Between 1986 and 1997, in the market sector, real hourly wages grew by over 40% on 
10:287:22765:21:21:71:534:633:144:Times:144:Times:average. In 1998, all of those gains were wiped out: real wages declined by 40% because nominal 
10:288:22861:21:21:71:535:612:144:Times:144:Times:wages did not keep up with rising prices. In the self-employed sector, hourly earnings declined by 
10:289:22960:21:20:71:535:591:144:Times:144:Times:40% in urban areas. In rural areas, hourly earnings of females declined by 40% but those of males 
10:290:23058:20:21:71:537:571:144:Times:144:Times:were little changed. To some extent, this reflects the impact of the price of rice (and food) and also 
10:291:23161:21:21:71:524:550:144:Times:144:Times:the contributions of unpaid family workers (who contributed more work on the farm in 1998 on 
10:292:23254:21:20:71:518:529:144:Times:144:Times:average than in 1997). Overall, household income declined by 30% between 1997 and 1998, a 
10:293:23344:20:21:71:448:509:144:Times:144:Times:substantively very large and statistically significant change. (Smith et al, 2002). 
10:294:23428:21:21:107:506:488:144:Times:144:Times: There is some evidence that households smoothed these real income declines as real 
10:295:23511:21:20:71:535:467:144:Times:144:Times:household per capita expenditure (PCE) declined 23%, with the biggest declines occurring among 
10:296:23606:20:21:71:542:447:144:Times:144:Times:those who were best off prior to the crisis. Using the PCE distribution from 1993, the households at 
10:297:23707:21:21:71:526:426:144:Times:144:Times:the 75th percentile reduced PCE by 30%, whereas the decline was 15% for the households at the 
10:298:23801:21:21:72:537:405:144:Times:144:Times:25th percentile of the 1993 PCE distribution. The crisis appears to have hit PCE of those who were 
10:299:23900:21:20:72:514:384:144:Times:144:Times:better off the most although, to be sure, the declines are very large and statistically significant 
10:300:24000:20:21:72:485:364:144:Times:144:Times:throughout the pre-crisis distribution of PCE. (Frankenberg, Smith and Thomas, 2003). 
10:301:24086:21:21:108:529:343:144:Times:144:Times: What was the impact on human capital of children over the short term? We first examine 
10:302:24173:21:20:72:540:322:144:Times:144:Times:anthropometric outcomes and then turn to education. Anthropometry is measured for all household 
10:303:24269:20:21:72:541:302:144:Times:144:Times:respondents in IFLS. Figure 3 displays the z score of height for age (in the upper panel) and weight 
10:304:24370:21:21:72:536:281:144:Times:144:Times:for height (in the lower panel) of all children age 9 and under measured in IFLS2, before the onset 
10:305:24470:21:20:72:514:260:144:Times:144:Times:of the financial crisis, and in IFLS2+, after the onset of the financial crisis. Height for age is a 
10:306:24571:20:21:72:513:240:144:Times:144:Times:longer-run indicator of nutritional status and an important marker of health in and of itself. In 
10:307:24669:21:21:72:510:219:144:Times:144:Times:addition, length during the first few years of life has been shown to be affected by health and 
10:308:24765:21:20:72:510:198:144:Times:144:Times:disease-related shocks and it is thought that length by around 24 or 30 months is a very good 
10:309:24859:20:21:72:506:178:144:Times:144:Times:predictor of attained adult height which, in turn, is predictive of longevity, improved health, 
10:310:24955:21:21:72:537:157:144:Times:144:Times:educational attainment and socio-economic success. Weight-for-height is a measure of shorter-run 
10:311:25052:21:21:72:541:136:144:Times:144:Times:nutritional status and is likely to reflect the impact of recent health inputs including food intake and 
10:312:25157:21:20:71:532:115:144:Times:144:Times:disease insults. (Martorell and Habicht, 1986; Alderman, Hoddinott and Kinsey, 2006; Hoddinott 
10:313:25252:20:21:72:348:95:144:Times:144:Times:et al., 2008; Maluccio et al., 2009; Hoddinott et al., 2013). 
10:314:25314:21:21:107:530:74:144:Times:144:Times: There is no evidence that child height for age was deleteriously impacted by the financial 
10:315:25405:21:0:72:531:53:144:Times:144:Times:crisis. Specifically, there are no significant differences in height for age for any of the age groups 
11:316:25510:0:21:72:542:716:144:Times:144:Times:although the sample size for the very youngest, and arguably the most vulnerable, is too small to be 
11:317:25611:21:21:72:537:695:144:Times:144:Times:informative. The evidence on weight for height is less clear for children age under 36 months with 
11:318:25710:21:20:72:528:674:144:Times:144:Times:these children having lower weight, given height, in the 1998 survey relative to the 1997 survey. 
11:319:25808:20:21:72:532:654:144:Times:144:Times:The difference, however, is not statistically significant and, importantly, the deficits in weight for 
11:320:25911:21:21:72:381:633:144:Times:144:Times:height for the youngest children are not evident in height for age. 
11:321:25979:21:21:108:513:612:144:Times:144:Times: Figure 3 is based on all children in both surveys, including new entrants into the 1998 
11:322:26067:21:20:72:518:591:144:Times:144:Times:survey in order to capture new births and mitigate the costs of the relatively small sample size. 
11:323:26165:20:21:72:533:571:144:Times:144:Times:There were few new entrants and with 99% recontact, attrition is ignorable. The figures restricted 
11:324:26264:21:21:72:540:550:144:Times:144:Times:to panel children are essentially the same. While the samples are small, separating rural from urban 
11:325:26365:21:20:72:530:529:144:Times:144:Times:households does not suggest differential effects across these sectors in anthropometric outcomes. 
11:326:26463:20:21:108:541:509:144:Times:144:Times: Results for school enrollment are displayed in Table 1. Among children who, in 1997, were 
11:327:26553:21:21:72:542:488:144:Times:144:Times:aged 13 to 16 years old, 25.6% were not enrolled in school in 1997, whereas  in 1998, 25.1% of the 
11:328:26652:21:20:72:533:467:144:Times:144:Times:children in that age group were not enrolled: with the onset of the crisis, the fraction not in school 
11:329:26755:20:21:72:537:447:144:Times:144:Times:decreased by 2%. However, among children age 7 to 12, 3.1% were not enrolled in school in 1997 
11:330:26850:21:21:72:526:426:144:Times:144:Times:and 5.9% were not enrolled in 1998: a 90% increase in non-enrollment. This gap was largest for 
11:331:26945:21:21:72:523:405:144:Times:144:Times:the poorest households: for the households in the bottom quartile of PCE (in 1997), 4.9% of the 
11:332:27041:21:20:72:541:384:144:Times:144:Times:children were not enrolled in school in 1997 and 10.7% were not enrolled in 1997: an almost 120% 
11:333:27138:20:21:72:521:364:144:Times:144:Times:increase in non-enrollment. Further, for poor children in this age group, having an older sibling 
11:334:27236:21:21:72:508:343:144:Times:144:Times:who was enrolled in school was associated with a greater chance of not being enrolled. And, 
11:335:27328:21:20:72:512:322:144:Times:144:Times:conversely, older poor children whose younger siblings who were not in school in 1998 were 
11:336:27419:20:21:72:520:302:144:Times:144:Times:themselves more likely to be enrolled in 1998. We find no differences between urban and rural 
11:337:27513:21:21:72:397:281:144:Times:144:Times:children or between male and female children (Thomas et al, 2004).  
11:338:27581:21:20:108:519:260:144:Times:144:Times: Why would older children in the poorest households stay in school when their younger 
11:339:27666:20:21:72:520:240:144:Times:144:Times:siblings were not enrolled? There are at least two plausible reasons. First, if a 13 to 16 year old 
11:340:27766:21:21:72:542:219:144:Times:144:Times:does not enroll in school in a year, that child is not likely to return to school in the future. However, 
11:341:27872:21:20:72:487:198:144:Times:144:Times:for younger children, being out of school for a year, say, is less likely to have long-term 
11:342:27964:20:21:72:509:178:144:Times:144:Times:consequences because dispersion in the ages of children in each grade is enormous and so re-
11:343:28056:21:21:72:536:157:144:Times:144:Times:entering when the child is a year older is not difficult. This reflects the combination of a great deal 
11:344:28160:21:21:72:523:136:144:Times:144:Times:of variation in the age at which children start school and the high rates of repetition of grades in 
11:345:28261:21:20:72:512:115:144:Times:144:Times:primary school. Second, the labor market returns to primary school education are very low in 
11:346:28354:20:21:72:523:95:144:Times:144:Times:Indonesia whereas the returns to secondary school and college are substantial and thus the long-
11:347:28450:21:21:72:506:74:144:Times:144:Times:term economic costs of not completing secondary school likely weighed on family decision-
11:348:28539:21:0:72:494:53:144:Times:144:Times:making. It turned out that keeping older children in school was a good choice: by 1999, a 
12:349:28632:0:21:72:503:716:144:Times:144:Times:scholarship program had been implemented so that the costs of enrollment were forgiven if 
12:350:28722:21:21:72:540:695:144:Times:144:Times:families were unable to afford them. These included the costs of fees, uniforms, transport costs and 
12:351:28823:21:20:72:535:674:144:Times:144:Times:examination charges. By 2000, enrollment rates and disparities across the income distribution had 
12:352:28921:20:21:72:412:654:144:Times:144:Times:all returned to their pre-crisis levels (and disparities had been reduced).  
12:353:28998:21:21:108:519:633:144:Times:144:Times: Intra-household substitution favoring school enrollment of older children over younger 
12:354:29085:21:21:72:539:612:144:Times:144:Times:children is one mechanism that families used to mitigate the impact of the shock on human capital. 
12:355:29184:21:20:71:524:591:144:Times:144:Times:There is evidence that adults literally tightened their belts to assure that the growth of the young 
12:356:29285:20:21:71:539:571:144:Times:144:Times:children did not falter in the face of the crisis. Figure 4 displays the body mass index (BMI), which 
12:357:29387:21:21:71:535:550:144:Times:144:Times:is weight (in kgs) divided by the square of height (in m) of males (in the upper panel) and females 
12:358:29487:21:20:71:534:529:144:Times:144:Times:(in the lower panel) by age in 1997 and 1998. BMI rises with age until around the mid-forties and 
12:359:29585:20:21:71:531:509:144:Times:144:Times:then declines. Height does not change for prime age adults and so this reflects changes in weight. 
12:360:29684:21:21:71:526:488:144:Times:144:Times:The remarkable result is the dramatic decline in BMI across the entire age distribution for males 
12:361:29782:21:20:71:526:467:144:Times:144:Times:and females between 1997 and 1998. On average, the declines are slightly smaller among adults 
12:362:29876:20:21:71:529:447:144:Times:144:Times:who were living in rural areas prior to the crisis. However, overall, it is the oldest females whose 
12:363:29977:21:21:71:541:426:144:Times:144:Times:weight declined the most: among females age 60 and older in 1997, weight declined by 15% in one 
12:364:30073:21:21:71:520:405:144:Times:144:Times:year. This is unlikely to reflect the impact of energy expenditure and so we conclude that these 
12:365:30170:21:20:71:529:384:144:Times:144:Times:women reduced their food intake of favor of their grandchildren. Block et al (2004) draw similar 
12:366:30267:20:21:71:520:364:144:Times:144:Times:conclusions that child nutritional status was protected at the expense of the nutritional status of 
12:367:30367:21:21:71:338:343:144:Times:144:Times:female adults using data collected in rural Central Java.  
12:368:30426:21:20:107:533:322:144:Times:144:Times: How did households smooth consumption? There are three key mechanisms. First, people 
12:369:30511:20:21:71:540:302:144:Times:144:Times:moved. Urban dwellers moved to the rural sector. As the rupiah collapsed, the non-tradeable sector 
12:370:30610:21:21:71:520:281:144:Times:144:Times:took the greatest toll with construction and other services being especially hard hit. Workers in 
12:371:30708:21:20:71:532:260:144:Times:144:Times:these sectors were more likely to be in urban areas. In contrast, the tradeable sector was a relative 
12:372:30810:20:21:71:521:240:144:Times:144:Times:beneficiary with the farming sector benefitting from the very large increase in the price of food 
12:373:30908:21:21:71:532:219:144:Times:144:Times:(particularly rice). Thus, relative to the urban sector, the rural sector was to some extent protected 
12:374:31011:21:20:71:541:198:144:Times:144:Times:from the impact of the crisis and so urban workers moved to the rural sector where there were there 
12:375:31111:20:21:72:531:178:144:Times:144:Times:were opportunities to earn income from working on a farm. In addition, since the cost of living is 
12:376:31210:21:21:72:538:157:144:Times:144:Times:lower in the rural sector, family members who were not working also moved from the urban to the 
12:377:31306:21:21:72:521:136:144:Times:144:Times:rural sector. Furthermore, household members moved in together to benefit from economies of 
12:378:31398:21:20:72:533:115:144:Times:144:Times:scale of living arrangements. As shown in Table 2, overall, household size increased significantly 
12:379:31497:20:21:72:535:95:144:Times:144:Times:from 4.33 to 4.53 members, with the increase being slightly (and not significantly) greater in rural 
12:380:31598:21:0:72:281:74:144:Times:144:Times:areas (because of urban to rural migration).  
13:381:31647:0:21:108:491:716:144:Times:144:Times: Second, whereas, on average, the percentage decline in real household per capita 
13:382:31728:21:21:72:532:695:144:Times:144:Times:expenditures was 23%, food expenditures were protected and the average percentage decline was 
13:383:31822:21:20:71:535:674:144:Times:144:Times:9%. This reflects the combination of reduced food intake and increased price of food. Households 
13:384:31919:20:21:71:525:654:144:Times:144:Times:cut spending on two classes of goods. First, spending on clothing, furniture and ceremonies was 
13:385:32015:21:21:71:536:633:144:Times:144:Times:reduced by 35% ; we call these items ‘deferable’ because delaying spending on these items for the 
13:386:32113:21:21:71:522:612:144:Times:144:Times:short term is unlikely to have the same impact on welfare as reduced spending on, for example, 
13:387:32208:21:20:71:498:591:144:Times:144:Times:staples. (See Browning and Crossly, 1997, for a discussion of deferred spending.) Second, 
13:388:32298:20:21:71:522:571:144:Times:144:Times:spending on health and education fell by 37%. The reduction in education spending reflects the 
13:389:32393:21:21:71:484:550:144:Times:144:Times:combination of young children not attending school and parents cutting back on school 
13:390:32479:21:20:71:541:529:144:Times:144:Times:expenditures (including paying fees). The reduction in spending on health is reflected in a dramatic 
13:391:32580:20:21:71:511:509:144:Times:144:Times:reduction in use of health care during the year after the onset of the financial crisis relative to 
13:392:32680:21:21:71:508:488:144:Times:144:Times:before the crisis. Whether these cuts in spending have longer-term consequences for welfare 
13:393:32772:21:20:71:518:467:144:Times:144:Times:depends on the longevity of the cut, whether delayed care will have result in poor health in the 
13:394:32869:20:21:71:527:447:144:Times:144:Times:future and whether the child’s schooling is affected over the longer term. All of these changes in 
13:395:32968:21:21:71:245:426:144:Times:144:Times:spending are statistically significant. 
13:396:33008:21:21:107:533:405:144:Times:144:Times: Third, households are likely to draw down savings or sell off assets to mitigate the impact 
13:397:33100:21:20:71:528:384:144:Times:144:Times:of the crisis (Deaton, 1992; Browning and Lusardi, 1996). The value of that strategy was limited 
13:398:33197:20:21:71:541:364:144:Times:144:Times:by the fact that many assets collapsed in value. Savings in cash lost value as inflation rocketed. The 
13:399:33300:21:21:71:506:343:144:Times:144:Times:Jakarta stock exchange had lost 75% of its pre-crisis value by the middle of 1998. Land and 
13:400:33392:21:20:71:531:322:144:Times:144:Times:housing markets dried up along with credit markets. One important asset rose in value: gold. The 
13:401:33489:20:21:71:519:302:144:Times:144:Times:price of gold is set in world terms and so as the rupiah fell to below half its pre-crisis level, the 
13:402:33591:21:21:71:528:281:144:Times:144:Times:value of gold more than doubled. There is an active market for gold which is sold by weight and 
13:403:33687:21:20:71:527:260:144:Times:144:Times:according to the IFLS community survey, there is a gold seller within half an hour travel time of 
13:404:33785:20:21:71:540:240:144:Times:144:Times:every IFLS community. In 1997, over half the households owned gold and the vast majority of this 
13:405:33882:21:21:71:513:219:144:Times:144:Times:gold was in the hands of women. By 1998, a substantial fraction of the gold had been sold. In 
13:406:33976:21:20:71:531:198:144:Times:144:Times:regression models of that link changes in budget shares to pre-crisis assets, we find that spending 
13:407:34076:20:21:71:504:178:144:Times:144:Times:on health and education are protected the most by gold ownership, an effect that is not only 
13:408:34169:21:21:71:528:157:144:Times:144:Times:statistically significant but also substantively important(Frankenberg, Smith and Thomas, 2003). 
13:409:34266:21:21:107:529:136:144:Times:144:Times: We conclude that even in the face of a very large financial shock, Indonesian households 
13:410:34355:21:20:71:508:115:144:Times:144:Times:and families sought to protect the human capital of the next generation through every means 
13:411:34447:20:21:71:523:95:144:Times:144:Times:possible: they migrated, moved in together, took up work, particularly in family businesses, cut 
13:412:34544:21:0:71:524:74:144:Times:144:Times:spending, especially on deferrable items, reduced spending on some members in favor of others 
14:413:34641:0:21:72:528:716:144:Times:144:Times:and spent down savings, primarily gold. In so doing, the immediate impact of the financial crisis 
14:414:34739:21:21:72:355:695:144:Times:144:Times:on the nutrition and schooling of children were minimized.  
14:415:34799:21:21:72:75:674:144:Times:144:Times: 
14:416:34799:21:22:72:342:653:170:Times:170:Times:Longer-term impacts on child health and education 
14:417:34848:22:21:108:528:631:144:Times:144:Times: While there is little evidence of large, negative impacts of the financial crisis in the short-
14:418:34943:21:20:72:535:610:144:Times:144:Times:term, the fact that households sold assets, particularly gold, and shifted spending to sustain human 
14:419:35044:20:21:72:536:590:144:Times:144:Times:capital investments suggests that over the longer-term the crisis may have resulted in worse health 
14:420:35144:21:21:72:513:569:144:Times:144:Times:and education outcomes for those that were affected. IFLS is a long-term panel study that has 
14:421:35238:21:20:72:540:548:144:Times:144:Times:followed the same respondents since the financial crisis with the third wave conducted in 2000, the 
14:422:35338:20:21:72:479:528:144:Times:144:Times:fourth wave in 2007/8 and the fifth wave in 2014/15 (Strauss et al, 2004, 2009, 2016). 
14:423:35425:21:21:108:498:507:144:Times:144:Times: Using data from the 2000 and 2007/8 waves, it is possible to trace the evolution of 
14:424:35509:21:20:72:527:486:144:Times:144:Times:nutritional status of children exposed to the financial crisis. The relationships between height for 
14:425:35610:20:21:72:536:466:144:Times:144:Times:age and age of the child at the time of the survey are displayed in Figure 5 for all children in panel 
14:426:35713:21:21:72:516:445:144:Times:144:Times:A, and separated by whether the child was living in an urban or rural area in 1997, prior to the 
14:427:35810:21:21:72:519:424:144:Times:144:Times:crisis, in panel B. Sector of residence is a proxy for the magnitude of the negative shock which 
14:428:35907:21:20:72:261:403:144:Times:144:Times:took a greater toll on urban households. 
14:429:35948:20:21:108:516:383:144:Times:144:Times: Height for age of children prior to the crisis in 1997 is displayed by the solid blue line. 
14:430:36040:21:21:72:517:362:144:Times:144:Times:Children at greatest risk of being stunted in the long-run are those who were age 30 months or 
14:431:36135:21:20:72:532:341:144:Times:144:Times:younger at the time of the crisis (the red dashed line) and would be age 2 through 4.5 years old in 
14:432:36235:20:21:72:530:321:144:Times:144:Times:the 2000 wave (the black dashed line). Children in this age group are not only taller than those of 
14:433:36335:21:21:72:535:300:144:Times:144:Times:the same age in 1998 but even those of the same age in 1997, prior to the crisis. This is true for all 
14:434:36438:21:20:72:526:279:144:Times:144:Times:children in the age group (in the upper panel) and for urban and rural children, separately (in the 
14:435:36538:20:21:72:512:259:144:Times:144:Times:lower panel), indicating that the crisis did not have a negative impact on linear growth of this 
14:436:36635:21:21:72:528:238:144:Times:144:Times:cohort. Height for age eight years later in 2008 (in the green broken line) is greater for every age 
14:437:36736:21:21:72:536:217:144:Times:144:Times:than in any other year. For the cohort that was exposed to the financial crisis in the first 30 months 
14:438:36839:21:20:72:525:196:144:Times:144:Times:of life (age 9 through 11.5 years at the time of the 2008 survey), height for age is the same as its 
14:439:36940:20:21:72:519:176:144:Times:144:Times:level in 2000 as would be expected if height for age is largely determined by 30 months. Since 
14:440:37035:21:21:72:543:155:144:Times:144:Times:height in 2008 is likely to be a very good predictor of attained height as an adult, we conclude there 
14:441:37138:21:20:72:521:134:144:Times:144:Times:is no evidence that height of children was deleteriously impacted by the financial crisis and the 
14:442:37236:20:21:72:542:114:144:Times:144:Times:short-run evidence indicating that child height was protected by family responses carries through to 
14:443:37337:21:0:72:153:93:144:Times:144:Times:the longer-term.  
15:444:37358:0:21:108:519:716:144:Times:144:Times: Figure 6 displays results for BMI for the same cohorts of children. In this case, it is not 
15:445:37450:21:21:72:542:695:144:Times:144:Times:only those children age less than 30 months who are at risk of being impacted by reduced resources 
15:446:37549:21:20:72:540:674:144:Times:144:Times:because of the crisis since, unlike height, weight does vary over the entire life course depending on 
15:447:37651:20:21:72:503:654:144:Times:144:Times:current net energy intake and nutrient absorption. The relationship between BMI and age is 
15:448:37742:21:21:71:530:633:144:Times:144:Times:remarkably similar for all children in the 1997, 1998 and 2000 waves of IFLS. By 2008, children 
15:449:37838:21:21:71:496:612:144:Times:144:Times:in every age are heavier, given height. We conclude that nutrition outcomes were also not 
15:450:37928:21:20:71:499:591:144:Times:144:Times:deleteriously affected by the financial crisis over the longer term; see also Strauss, Beegle, 
15:451:38023:20:21:71:350:571:144:Times:144:Times:Dwiyanto  et al. (2004); Thomas and Frankenberg (2007).  
15:452:38080:21:21:107:513:550:144:Times:144:Times: Exploiting the long-term panel dimension of IFLS, we investigate completed years of 
15:453:38164:21:20:71:521:529:144:Times:144:Times:education in 2014, sixteen years after the onset of the financial crisis, of respondents who were 
15:454:38262:20:21:71:535:509:144:Times:144:Times:interviewed in IFLS2 in 1997, before the crisis. We focus on respondents who were age 5 through 
15:455:38358:21:21:71:527:488:144:Times:144:Times:21 in 1997 and thus age 22 through 38 in 2014. The vast majority of these respondents will have 
15:456:38454:21:20:71:537:467:144:Times:144:Times:completed their schooling by 2014 and so the number of completed years of education at that time 
15:457:38551:20:21:71:527:447:144:Times:144:Times:is indicative of the human capital the respondents will carry with them for the rest of their lives.  
15:458:38653:21:21:107:533:426:144:Times:144:Times: As discussed above, and shown in Table 1, children age 13 through 16 were no less likely 
15:459:38742:21:21:71:496:405:144:Times:144:Times:to be enrolled in school in 1998 relative to 1997 but young children, age 7 through 12 and 
15:460:38833:21:20:71:531:384:144:Times:144:Times:especially those from poor households (from the bottom quartile of the distribution of PCE) were 
15:461:38930:20:21:71:520:364:144:Times:144:Times:significantly less likely to be in school. What were the longer-run consequences for education? 
15:462:39026:21:21:107:537:343:144:Times:144:Times: Figure 7 displays mean years of completed schooling in 2014 for each age cohort stratified 
15:463:39117:21:20:71:539:322:144:Times:144:Times:by sector of residence and level of household resources, all measured in 1997. The respondents are 
15:464:39216:20:21:71:534:302:144:Times:144:Times:separated into those who were living in households in the bottom quartile of PCE and those living 
15:465:39314:21:21:71:538:281:144:Times:144:Times:in other households. As shown by the linear trends in age, estimated separately for each of the four 
15:466:39415:21:20:71:519:260:144:Times:144:Times:groups, completed years of schooling has risen for each successive birth cohort included in the 
15:467:39511:20:21:71:536:240:144:Times:144:Times:figure. While children from the poorest households complete less schooling than those from better 
15:468:39609:21:21:71:536:219:144:Times:144:Times:off households, the gap has remained approximately constant for rural dwellers but in urban areas, 
15:469:39708:21:20:71:539:198:144:Times:144:Times:the rate of growth is faster among the poorest children and so those children in the youngest cohort 
15:470:39809:20:21:71:451:178:144:Times:144:Times:have almost caught up with their same age peers in better off urban households.  
15:471:39890:21:21:107:523:157:144:Times:144:Times: There is no evidence that educational attainment of children who were age 7 through 12 
15:472:39977:21:21:71:535:136:144:Times:144:Times:years and living in the poorest households in 1997 was lower than predicted by the linear trend; in 
15:473:40077:21:28:71:532:115:144:Times:144:Times:fact they completed slightly more education than predicted.1 Nor is there evidence that protection 
15:474:40176:28:7:72:219:87:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
15:475:40225:7:16:72:518:80:42:Times:100:Times:1 On average, 7 to 12 year olds in the poorest households completed 0.002 years of education more than predicted 
15:476:40338:16:12:72:523:64:100:Times:100:Times:(standard error=0.17) and the same age children in better off households completed 0.04 years more education than 
15:477:40452:12:0:72:199:52:100:Times:100:Times:predicted (standard error=0.14). 
16:478:40488:0:21:72:514:716:144:Times:144:Times:of 13 to 16 year olds at the time of the financial crisis resulted in significantly higher levels of 
16:479:40589:21:21:72:306:695:144:Times:144:Times:completed education on average for that cohort.2  
16:480:40639:21:20:108:514:674:144:Times:144:Times: It is clear from the figure, however, that there is one birth cohort for whom completed 
16:481:40727:20:21:72:522:654:144:Times:144:Times:schooling deviates from its predicted level: those age 8 years living in households in the lowest 
16:482:40825:21:21:72:510:633:144:Times:144:Times:quartile of PCE in urban areas in 1997. The gap, almost 2 years of education, is both large in 
16:483:40920:21:21:72:539:612:144:Times:144:Times:magnitude and statistically significant (the standard error is 0.6 years of education) and pushes this 
16:484:41023:21:20:72:453:591:144:Times:144:Times:cohort back to the same level of education as the cohort born eight years earlier.  
16:485:41107:20:21:108:532:571:144:Times:144:Times: This evidence is summarized in panel 1 of Table 3 which reports the relationship between 
16:486:41196:21:21:72:521:550:144:Times:144:Times:completed years of schooling and age, with indicator variables for the cohort age 8 years old in 
16:487:41293:21:20:72:508:529:144:Times:144:Times:1997 and gender of the child. The rate of growth in educational attainment by birth cohort is 
16:488:41387:20:21:72:541:509:144:Times:144:Times:displayed in the first row of panel 1 of the table and the difference from the expected education and 
16:489:41489:21:21:72:534:488:144:Times:144:Times:actual education for the eight year old cohort is in the second row. In contrast with eight year olds 
16:490:41591:21:20:72:534:467:144:Times:144:Times:in poor urban households, those in better off urban households and those in rural households were 
16:491:41689:20:21:72:532:447:144:Times:144:Times:not disadvantaged by the financial crisis. Since there is no evidence that the education of children 
16:492:41790:21:21:72:513:426:144:Times:144:Times:from urban households in the top three quartiles of PCE at the time of the financial crisis was 
16:493:41886:21:21:72:532:405:144:Times:144:Times:disrupted by the financial crisis, those children provide a useful comparison group for the poorest 
16:494:41986:21:20:71:524:384:144:Times:144:Times:urban children. The gap in educational attainment between the poorest and better off children in 
16:495:42083:20:21:71:521:364:144:Times:144:Times:urban areas is displayed in column 3 of the table: it is also significant. An additional contrast is 
16:496:42184:21:21:71:521:343:144:Times:144:Times:drawn between the poorest and better off eight year olds in rural areas: there is no difference in 
16:497:42283:21:20:71:538:322:144:Times:144:Times:their educational attainment. (The difference in difference between poorer and better off eight year 
16:498:42384:20:21:71:522:302:144:Times:144:Times:olds in urban and rural areas is large and statistically significant; it is 1.97 years with a standard 
16:499:42487:21:21:71:170:281:144:Times:144:Times:error of 0.87 years.)  
16:500:42510:21:20:107:524:260:144:Times:144:Times: Household composition and resources mattered for schooling at the time of the crisis. In 
16:501:42599:20:21:71:539:240:144:Times:144:Times:panel 2 of the table, the models include ln(PCE) and detailed controls for the number of household 
16:502:42698:21:21:71:503:219:144:Times:144:Times:members in fine age groups (for children) and larger age groups (for adults). The estimated 
16:503:42790:21:20:71:398:198:144:Times:144:Times:differences between 8 year olds and other children are little changed. 
16:504:42861:20:21:107:510:178:144:Times:144:Times: It is possible that there are other household characteristics that are not included in the 
16:505:42952:21:21:72:536:157:144:Times:144:Times:model that drive this difference and so, in panel 3 of the table, the models include household fixed 
16:506:43053:21:21:72:521:136:144:Times:144:Times:effects. The gap for eight year olds is reduced by 40% and significant at only a 10% size of test 
16:507:43151:21:28:72:530:115:144:Times:144:Times:(which is also the case for the difference between the better off and poorest urban children). This

16:509:43300:7:16:72:536:80:42:Times:100:Times:2 Children age 13 to 16 years in 1997 in the poorest households completed 0.06 (se=0.18) more years of schooling and 
16:510:43417:16:12:72:532:64:100:Times:100:Times:those in better of households completed 0.16 (se=0.12) more years of schooling. Neither effect is large or statistically 
16:511:43538:12:0:72:118:52:100:Times:100:Times:significant. 
17:512:43554:0:21:72:520:716:144:Times:144:Times:suggests that there are time-varying household-level characteristics that enabled the families to 
17:513:43652:21:21:72:458:695:144:Times:144:Times:smooth the educational attainment of 8 year olds in the poorest urban households. 
17:514:43734:21:20:108:531:674:144:Times:144:Times: These results suggest that among the children who were most likely to be out of school at 
17:515:43824:20:21:71:526:654:144:Times:144:Times:the time of the financial crisis, specifically those children who were age 7-12 years and living in 
17:516:43924:21:21:71:532:633:144:Times:144:Times:the poorest households in 1997, the vast majority have not been deleteriously affected in terms of 
17:517:44023:21:21:71:529:612:144:Times:144:Times:their educational attainment in 2014. The only exception is 8 year olds in poor, rural households, 
17:518:44122:21:20:71:517:591:144:Times:144:Times:who account for one in six of  children age 7 through 12 in poor households and, even, among 
17:519:44215:20:21:71:531:571:144:Times:144:Times:these children, the evidence suggests that the deleterious impact on their education was mitigated 
17:520:44314:21:21:71:528:550:144:Times:144:Times:by time-varying household-level characteristics or behaviors related to those characteristics. The 
17:521:44413:21:20:71:531:529:144:Times:144:Times:modest impact of the financial crisis on educational attainment of poor children in Indonesia may 
17:522:44511:20:21:71:521:509:144:Times:144:Times:be a reflection of the temporary scholarship program that was instituted soon after the financial 
17:523:44609:21:21:71:104:488:144:Times:144:Times:crisis.  
17:524:44618:21:20:107:536:467:144:Times:144:Times: The extent of resilience of child human capital outcomes after a shock that rivals the Great 
17:525:44711:20:21:71:540:447:144:Times:144:Times:Depression in the United States in magnitude and occurred in a low income setting is nothing short 
17:526:44810:21:21:71:523:426:144:Times:144:Times:of remarkable. This is not to argue that the shock had no welfare consequences for children and 
17:527:44906:21:21:71:531:405:144:Times:144:Times:their families: it did. Poverty rates rose, wealth declined, the physical and psycho-social health of 
17:528:45008:21:20:71:532:384:144:Times:144:Times:adults worsened, and it took several years for Indonesia to regain the lost ground. The impacts on 
17:529:45107:20:21:71:360:364:144:Times:144:Times:human capital of children, however, are at most, very muted.

17:532:45207:23:20:108:523:298:144:Times:144:Times: In some cases, shocks are so devastating that mitigating their impact in the short-term is 
17:533:45298:20:21:72:529:278:144:Times:144:Times:beyond the reach of even the most resourceful families. It is useful to contrast the immediate and 
17:534:45397:21:21:72:532:257:144:Times:144:Times:longer-term impact on health and human capital of children of such shocks relative to shocks like 
17:535:45495:21:21:72:523:236:144:Times:144:Times:the financial crisis. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami provides a platform for this 
17:536:45591:21:20:72:144:215:144:Times:144:Times:investigation.   
17:537:45608:20:22:72:75:195:144:Times:144:Times: 
17:538:45608:22:21:72:304:173:170:Times:170:Times:2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami 
17:539:45648:21:21:108:540:152:144:Times:144:Times: The 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake occurred at 8am on Sunday December 26, 2004, 
17:540:45729:21:21:72:527:131:144:Times:144:Times:and registered 9.3 on the Richter scale. One of the strongest earthquakes in recorded history, it 
17:541:45827:21:20:72:525:110:144:Times:144:Times:shifted the North Pole by several centimeters, caused a 1200 km rupture along the floor of the 
17:542:45922:20:21:72:537:90:144:Times:144:Times:Indian Ocean and results in a tsunami that was felt across the entire Indian Ocean. The epicenter 
17:543:46020:21:0:72:534:69:144:Times:144:Times:of the earthquake was about 150 kms off the west coast of the province of Aceh on the northern 
18:544:46118:0:21:72:542:716:144:Times:144:Times:tip of the island of Sumatra, Indonesia. Since the tsunami surge was greater than 800 km/hour, its 
18:545:46217:21:21:71:451:695:144:Times:144:Times:impact was felt along the Acehnese coast within 15 minutes of the earthquake. 
18:546:46295:21:20:107:535:674:144:Times:144:Times: At the time, the Indian Ocean was not thought to be prone to tsunamis and there were no 
18:547:46383:20:21:71:521:654:144:Times:144:Times:warning buoys or an early warning system (in contrast with the Pacific Ocean). According to 
18:548:46475:21:21:71:509:633:144:Times:144:Times:archaeological data, there had not been a tsunami on the coast of Aceh for over 600 years.  
18:549:46567:21:21:107:539:612:144:Times:144:Times: The impact of the tsunami depended on a combination of the wave height, which reached 
18:550:46653:21:20:71:516:591:144:Times:144:Times:up to 15 meters in some areas, the wave direction and the topography of the land. Areas that 
18:551:46746:20:21:71:529:571:144:Times:144:Times:were low-lying (such as river basins) that faced the wave were devastated: in some areas water 
18:552:46841:21:21:71:522:550:144:Times:144:Times:and mud reached up to 6 kms inland. Nearby areas that were higher up (because of a cliff, for 
18:553:46935:21:20:71:490:529:144:Times:144:Times:example) or were protected from the wave by a promontory were not directly affected. 
18:554:47020:20:21:107:516:509:144:Times:144:Times: In the SUSENAS survey conducted by Statistics Indonesia in February/March 2004, 
18:555:47100:21:21:71:522:488:144:Times:144:Times:about 10 months before the tsunami, fewer than 3% of all respondents in Aceh thought that it 
18:556:47193:21:20:71:528:467:144:Times:144:Times:was likely they would experience a natural disaster such as an earthquake, tsunami or volcanic 
18:557:47288:20:21:71:510:447:144:Times:144:Times:eruption and that fraction did not differ depending on whether their community was in fact 
18:558:47379:21:21:71:518:426:144:Times:144:Times:directly affected by the tsunami. In sum, the tsunami was unanticipated; it was impossible to 
18:559:47473:21:21:71:528:405:144:Times:144:Times:predict where it would hit along the Acehnese coast, and few people living in Aceh expected a 
18:560:47567:21:20:71:208:384:144:Times:144:Times:large-scale natural disaster.  
18:561:47598:20:21:107:533:364:144:Times:144:Times: The tsunami was not only unanticipated; it was also a major shock. It is estimated that in 
18:562:47689:21:21:71:512:343:144:Times:144:Times:Aceh, the earthquake and tsunami killed about 170,000 people which is about 5% of the total 
18:563:47781:21:20:71:539:322:144:Times:144:Times:population of the province. About three-quarters of a million people (about 20% of the population) 
18:564:47880:20:21:71:528:302:144:Times:144:Times:were displaced because their homes were destroyed or damaged. In addition to the loss of home, 
18:565:47975:21:21:71:520:281:144:Times:144:Times:there was massive physical destruction. Roads and infrastructure were severely damaged and 
18:566:48066:21:20:71:511:260:144:Times:144:Times:over 40,000 hectares of agricultural land were affected,  with crop destruction and death of 
18:567:48159:20:21:71:537:240:144:Times:144:Times:livestock. The World Bank estimated there was about $4.5 billion in property damage (Doocy et 
18:568:48253:21:21:71:510:219:144:Times:144:Times:al, 2007; Frankenberg et at, 2008; Gray et al, 2012; Cossee, Hermes, and Mezhoud 2006).  
18:569:48342:21:20:107:503:198:144:Times:144:Times: There are at least three important dimensions to the shock from the perspective of 
18:570:48425:20:21:71:533:178:144:Times:144:Times:examining the impact on child human capital. First, many lost assets, livelihoods, and members 
18:571:48520:21:21:71:531:157:144:Times:144:Times:of their networks as their income-earning opportunities were wiped out and as family members 
18:572:48613:21:21:71:504:136:144:Times:144:Times:were killed in the tsunami. Second, the destruction to roads and bridges reduced access to 
18:573:48704:21:20:71:513:115:144:Times:144:Times:markets, which resulted in increases in the price of food, and the loss of housing resulted in 
18:574:48799:20:21:71:542:95:144:Times:144:Times:increased rents. On both counts, those who were net sellers of food or housing benefited from the 
18:575:48897:21:21:71:502:74:144:Times:144:Times:shock. Third, the loss of family and friends in the tsunami and the destruction and loss of 
18:576:48989:21:0:71:542:53:144:Times:144:Times:livelihoods affected the psycho-social health and well-being of the population (Frankenberg et al, 
19:577:49091:0:21:72:503:716:144:Times:144:Times:2008). It is difficult to credibly disentangle the income (and asset) shock, price shock and 
19:578:49184:21:21:72:213:695:144:Times:144:Times:psycho-social (stress) shock. 
19:579:49214:21:20:108:509:674:144:Times:144:Times: The tsunami was followed by the largest influx of aid after a natural disaster in any 
19:580:49300:20:21:72:498:654:144:Times:144:Times:developing country up to that point. It is estimated that the combination of domestic and 
19:581:49390:21:21:72:516:633:144:Times:144:Times:international aid from government and non-government sources totaled some $7.2 billion in 
19:582:49480:21:21:72:532:612:144:Times:144:Times:assistance that was directed to recovery efforts in Aceh and North Sumatra. Initially, aid efforts 
19:583:49579:21:20:72:541:591:144:Times:144:Times:focused on providing food and temporary shelter and it took several months for regular provision 
19:584:49676:20:21:72:528:571:144:Times:144:Times:systems to be put in place. Food had to be transported by air or ship to reach many of the most 
19:585:49772:21:21:72:515:550:144:Times:144:Times:devastated communities as the roads were impassable. Camps were constructed and a small 
19:586:49860:21:20:72:538:529:144:Times:144:Times:number of displaced moved into camps within three months of the disaster, but the vast majority 
19:587:49956:20:21:72:542:509:144:Times:144:Times:of camps were not constructed until later in 2005. After these needs were met, aid efforts focused 
19:588:50055:21:21:72:516:488:144:Times:144:Times:on infrastructure investments – roads, bridges, public building and housing. The goal was to 
19:589:50148:21:20:72:169:467:144:Times:144:Times:“build back better”. 
19:590:50169:20:21:108:542:447:144:Times:144:Times: In short, in December 2004, there was a major shock that affected the lives of those living 
19:591:50261:21:21:72:512:426:144:Times:144:Times:along the coast of Aceh at the time. It was followed by one of the most successful recovery 
19:592:50353:21:21:72:461:405:144:Times:144:Times:programs conducted in a developing country. How did child human capital fare? 
19:593:50431:21:20:108:533:384:144:Times:144:Times: To answer this question, we draw on data from the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and 
19:594:50516:20:21:72:505:364:144:Times:144:Times:Recovery (STAR). The baseline sample is drawn from the 2004 SUSENAS conducted 10 
19:595:50597:21:21:72:496:343:144:Times:144:Times:months before the tsunami and includes all respondents who were living at the time in a 
19:596:50685:21:20:72:483:322:144:Times:144:Times:kabupaten (district) along the coast of Aceh. SUSENAS is designed to be population-
19:597:50768:20:21:72:516:302:144:Times:144:Times:representative at the kabupaten level and so the baseline is representative of the pre-tsunami 
19:598:50863:21:21:72:493:281:144:Times:144:Times:population that was affected, to varying degrees, by the tsunami. There are over 25,000 
19:599:50951:21:20:72:416:260:144:Times:144:Times:respondents in more than 6,000 households in some 400 communities.  
19:600:51019:20:21:108:532:240:144:Times:144:Times: We conducted the first follow-up of the SUSENAS respondents between May 2005 and 
19:601:51100:21:21:72:512:219:144:Times:144:Times:June 2006 and we refer to that survey as STARB. Thereafter, we conducted four additional 
19:602:51189:21:20:72:535:198:144:Times:144:Times:annual follow-ups (STAR C, D E and F) and have completed a 10 year follow-up (STAR G). In 
19:603:51279:20:21:72:497:178:144:Times:144:Times:the first follow-up, finding and interviewing every survivor was critically important and 
19:604:51369:21:21:72:495:157:144:Times:144:Times:extremely difficult. We have determined the survival status of over 98% of the baseline 
19:605:51457:21:21:72:513:136:144:Times:144:Times:respondents. In most cases, we have found one or more of the surviving baseline household 
19:606:51547:21:20:71:540:115:144:Times:144:Times:members and obtained survival status from those respondents. In some cases, however, no one in 
19:607:51642:20:21:71:534:95:144:Times:144:Times:the household survived and in those cases we used multiple reports from neighbors, community 
19:608:51735:21:21:71:539:74:144:Times:144:Times:leaders and service providers (in the health and education sectors) to assure that our designations 
19:609:51835:21:0:71:131:53:144:Times:144:Times:are correct.  
20:610:51852:0:21:108:540:716:144:Times:144:Times: Post-tsunami follow-up of survivors has been very challenging. On the one hand, in areas 
20:611:51941:21:21:72:531:695:144:Times:144:Times:that were severely damaged, all (or in some cases almost all) the survivors were displaced with 
20:612:52037:21:20:72:529:674:144:Times:144:Times:about half moving to camps and the other half moving to private homes. Lack of infrastructure 
20:613:52131:20:21:72:538:654:144:Times:144:Times:and damage to roads compounded the difficulty of tracking and interviewing the survivors. Over 
20:614:52226:21:21:72:478:633:144:Times:144:Times:96% of the survivors have been interviewed in at least one of the STAR follow-ups. 
20:615:52309:21:21:108:527:612:144:Times:144:Times: SUSENAS does not collect data on height of respondents. Given the complexity of the 
20:616:52393:21:20:72:535:591:144:Times:144:Times:fieldwork, identifying, finding and interviewing surviving respondents in the first follow-up, we 
20:617:52491:20:21:72:525:571:144:Times:144:Times:chose to not also burden the enumerators with the equipment necessary to measure height and 
20:618:52583:21:21:72:531:550:144:Times:144:Times:weight and conduct other health assessments in that follow-up. Measurement of anthropometry 
20:619:52675:21:20:72:541:529:144:Times:144:Times:along with the collection of other biomarkers was added in the second follow-up, STARC, which 
20:620:52769:20:21:72:491:509:144:Times:144:Times:was in the field between July 2006 and June 2007. Anthropometry was measured in all 
20:621:52853:21:21:72:495:488:144:Times:144:Times:subsequent waves. Those data are used in our analyses of child nutrition. (Frankenberg, 
20:622:52941:21:21:72:276:467:144:Times:144:Times:Friedman, Ingwersen and Thomas, 2016). 
20:623:52980:21:21:72:75:446:144:Times:144:Times: 
20:624:52980:21:22:72:331:425:170:Times:170:Times:In utero exposure to the tsunami and child height 
20:625:53029:22:20:108:529:403:144:Times:144:Times: We focus on the height for age of children who were in utero at the time of the tsunami 
20:626:53117:20:21:72:537:383:144:Times:144:Times:and exclude all children born in areas that were very heavily damaged by the tsunami and where 
20:627:53212:21:21:72:520:362:144:Times:144:Times:there were very high death tolls because of the tsunami. There are very few births in the nine 
20:628:53307:21:20:72:542:341:144:Times:144:Times:months following the tsunami among women who were living in those areas and so the exclusion 
20:629:53400:20:21:72:511:321:144:Times:144:Times:of those births has no perceptible impact on the estimates discussed below. Their exclusion 
20:630:53492:21:21:72:527:300:144:Times:144:Times:assures that none of the results are contaminated by selective survival of the strongest mothers 
20:631:53589:21:20:72:518:279:144:Times:144:Times:since women who were pregnant were much more likely to have died when they were swept 
20:632:53675:20:21:72:367:259:144:Times:144:Times:away by the water than were women who were not pregnant. 
20:633:53732:21:21:108:536:238:144:Times:144:Times: The average height given age of this cohort at the time of the second follow up when the 
20:634:53821:21:21:72:540:217:144:Times:144:Times:child was, on average about 15 months old is 1.76 standard deviations below the CDC norm. We 
20:635:53914:21:20:72:522:196:144:Times:144:Times:compare the height for age of this cohort with the cohort born in 2002 since, according to the 
20:636:54009:20:21:72:530:176:144:Times:144:Times:nutrition literature, the growth trajectory of the height of those children is thought to be largely 
20:637:54110:21:21:72:532:155:144:Times:144:Times:determined by the time of the tsunami. Conception date is not known for children in STAR and 
20:638:54203:21:20:72:541:134:144:Times:144:Times:so we examine children by quarter of birth and assume that those born in the first quarter of 2005 
20:639:54302:20:21:72:540:114:144:Times:144:Times:were in the third trimester at the time of the tsunami, those born in the second quarter were in the 
20:640:54403:21:0:72:533:93:144:Times:144:Times:second trimester and those born in the third quarter were in the first trimester. Each birth cohort 
21:641:54506:0:21:72:540:716:144:Times:144:Times:is compared with the same quarter of birth cohort in the reference cohort.3 The gap in the z-score 
21:642:54605:21:21:72:515:695:144:Times:144:Times:of height for age of those exposed to the tsunami in utero in the second STAR follow-up (in 
21:643:54697:21:20:72:531:674:144:Times:144:Times:2006-7) is displayed in the first column of Table 4. All models also control gender of the child, 
21:644:54795:20:21:72:540:654:144:Times:144:Times:month of interview and birth order. Children in the second or third trimesters of the pregnancy at 
21:645:54894:21:21:72:536:633:144:Times:144:Times:the time of the tsunami are shorter than the reference cohort and the gap is large and statistically 
21:646:54995:21:21:72:476:612:144:Times:144:Times:significant for those born in the second quarter of 2005. Based on this evidence, the 
21:647:55081:21:20:72:539:591:144:Times:144:Times:unanticipated shock of the tsunami resulted in reduced linear growth of the children who were in 
21:648:55178:20:21:72:522:571:144:Times:144:Times:utero at the time of the tsunami by the time they were, on average, 18 months old. This likely 
21:649:55273:21:21:72:542:550:144:Times:144:Times:reflects the combination of the nutrition shock (because of the rise in the price of food and access 
21:650:55374:21:20:72:488:529:144:Times:144:Times:to markets), the income shock (because of the loss of livelihoods) and the stress shock 
21:651:55462:20:21:72:343:509:144:Times:144:Times:(associated with exposure to the horror of the tsunami).  
21:652:55520:21:21:108:528:488:144:Times:144:Times: One year later, however, the estimated gaps are smaller and after two years none of the 
21:653:55608:21:20:72:535:467:144:Times:144:Times:gaps between the exposed and reference cohort is significantly different from zero. As shown in 
21:654:55704:20:21:72:526:447:144:Times:144:Times:column 4, five years after the tsunami, the cohort exposed to the tsunami in utero is taller than 
21:655:55802:21:21:72:541:426:144:Times:144:Times:the 2002 cohort and the differences are statistically significant for those born in the first and third 
21:656:55906:21:21:72:506:405:144:Times:144:Times:quarters of the year. Growth in height for age between 2006/7 and 2009/10, relative to the 
21:657:55997:21:20:72:505:384:144:Times:144:Times:reference cohort, is displayed in the fifth column of the table, restricting attention to those 
21:658:56093:20:21:72:540:364:144:Times:144:Times:children measured in both waves: all of the exposed children have grown much faster, relative to 
21:659:56190:21:21:72:541:343:144:Times:144:Times:the CDC norms than the reference cohort and the growth is greatest for those who had the largest 
21:660:56287:21:20:72:536:322:144:Times:144:Times:disadvantage in 2006/7, those born in the second quarter. That group of children has grown over 
21:661:56383:20:21:72:329:302:144:Times:144:Times:1 standard deviation more than the reference cohort.4 
21:662:56436:21:21:108:504:281:144:Times:144:Times: It is possible that the growth trajectory of the reference cohort was affected by the 
21:663:56522:21:20:72:517:260:144:Times:144:Times:tsunami; children in the reference cohort were born in 2002 and so were, on average, age 30 
21:664:56614:20:21:72:523:240:144:Times:144:Times:months at the time of the tsunami. The 2001 birth cohort was potentially affected by the 1998 
21:665:56708:21:21:72:514:219:144:Times:144:Times:financial crisis and so comparison with that cohort may be compromised. Results using this 
21:666:56799:21:20:72:539:198:144:Times:144:Times:cohort as the reference are displayed in column 6 of the table and the results are not substantially 
21:667:56900:20:21:72:529:178:144:Times:144:Times:affected. The cohort that was in utero at the time of the tsunami was born with very substantial 
21:668:56997:21:21:72:411:157:144:Times:144:Times:deficits in length but have more than made up those deficits by age 4.  
21:669:57069:21:21:108:512:136:144:Times:144:Times: Nutrition and stress insults in utero are likely to have resulted in some fetuses being 
21:670:57157:21:16:72:499:115:144:Times:144:Times:miscarried. It is possible to investigate this issue by comparing the impact of the in utero 
21:671:57250:16:8:72:219:99:144:Times:144:Times:                                                 
21:672:57299:8:16:72:530:91:42:Times:100:Times:3 It is important to note that it is likely that more of the children who were in utero at the time of the tsunami were 
21:673:57419:16:7:71:519:75:100:Times:100:Times:born prematurely relative to the reference cohort and this effect is captured in the comparison of height for age. 
21:674:57534:7:16:72:527:68:42:Times:100:Times:4 Results using the WHO norms are essentially identical. Recall that comparisons are made between standardized 
21:675:57645:16:0:72:446:52:100:Times:100:Times:height for age of the exposed cohort with standardized height for age of the reference cohort. 
22:676:57743:0:21:72:542:716:144:Times:144:Times:exposure to the tsunami on males and females. Overall, miscarriages are more common for males 
22:677:57837:21:21:72:504:695:144:Times:144:Times:largely because males are far more likely to be miscarried early in the pregnancy whereas 
22:678:57927:21:20:72:541:674:144:Times:144:Times:females are more likely to be miscarried later in the pregnancy. Thus, males who were in the first 
22:679:58026:20:21:72:515:654:144:Times:144:Times:or second trimester of the pregnancy at the time of the tsunami are more likely to have been 
22:680:58119:21:21:72:535:633:144:Times:144:Times:miscarried, relative to males in the third trimester and so we expect the impact of the tsunami to 
22:681:58218:21:21:72:526:612:144:Times:144:Times:be greatest on third trimester males who are most likely to be born in the first quarter of 2005. 
22:682:58316:21:20:72:520:591:144:Times:144:Times:For females, those in the third trimester are more likely to be miscarried and so, among these 
22:683:58411:20:21:72:520:571:144:Times:144:Times:fetuses, only the strongest are likely to have survived. Impacts of the tsunami are likely to be 
22:684:58508:21:21:72:541:550:144:Times:144:Times:greatest on the fetuses exposed earlier in the pregnancy. These predictions are consistent with the 
22:685:58608:21:20:72:539:529:144:Times:144:Times:data. The impact of in utero exposure is greatest for males in the third trimester of the pregnancy 
22:686:58708:20:21:72:517:509:144:Times:144:Times:and females in the first and second trimesters at the time of the tsunami. There are two main 
22:687:58802:21:21:72:518:488:144:Times:144:Times:conclusions. First, this establishes that miscarriage plays an important role and the estimated 
22:688:58898:21:20:72:526:467:144:Times:144:Times:effects of the tsunami on child height should be interpreted with this in mind. Second, the fact 
22:689:58995:20:21:72:538:447:144:Times:144:Times:that the evidence is consistent with the predictions of a biological model of miscarriage suggests 
22:690:59094:21:21:72:521:426:144:Times:144:Times:that the results are unlikely to be driven by unobserved differences between the cohorts. It is, 
22:691:59191:21:21:72:526:405:144:Times:144:Times:however, possible to test that hypothesis by estimating dose-response effects that compare the 
22:692:59286:21:20:72:433:384:144:Times:144:Times:heights of children whose mothers had different exposures to the tsunami.  
22:693:59361:20:21:108:513:364:144:Times:144:Times: In the first post-tsunami survey, adults were asked a battery of questions about their 
22:694:59448:21:21:72:518:343:144:Times:144:Times:exposure to the tsunami including, for example, whether they saw people die in the tsunami, 
22:695:59540:21:20:72:541:322:144:Times:144:Times:whether they were swept away by the water, and whether they saw or heard the water: two-thirds 
22:696:59635:20:21:72:517:302:144:Times:144:Times:of mothers who survived the tsunami saw or heard the water and one-third who did not. The 
22:697:59725:21:21:72:536:281:144:Times:144:Times:children of mothers who saw or heard the water and were born in the second quarter of 2005 are 
22:698:59820:21:20:72:532:260:144:Times:144:Times:about a standard deviation shorter than the reference cohort two to three years after the tsunami 
22:699:59918:20:21:72:529:240:144:Times:144:Times:and are the same height as the reference cohort three to four years later. Among children in the 
22:700:60015:21:21:72:539:219:144:Times:144:Times:second trimester whose mother did not see or hear the water, two to three years after the tsunami 
22:701:60113:21:20:72:534:198:144:Times:144:Times:they are slightly but not significantly shorter than the reference cohort and three years later they 
22:702:60214:20:21:72:521:178:144:Times:144:Times:are taller than the reference cohort. They are also taller than children in the same birth cohort 
22:703:60312:21:21:72:514:157:144:Times:144:Times:whose mothers were exposed to the water. This evidence is consistent with a dose-response 
22:704:60402:21:21:72:526:136:144:Times:144:Times:impact of exposure to the tsunami on length at birth and that the children whose mothers were 
22:705:60496:21:20:72:345:115:144:Times:144:Times:most exposed have an enduring deficit in height for age. 
22:706:60553:20:21:108:509:95:144:Times:144:Times: In many contexts, those families with more resources at the time of a shock tend to 
22:707:60637:21:21:72:529:74:144:Times:144:Times:mitigate the deleterious impact of the shock. We find no evidence that pre-tsunami resources – 
22:708:60732:21:0:72:519:53:144:Times:144:Times:measured by household per capita expenditure, paternal education or maternal education – is 
23:709:60827:0:21:72:539:716:144:Times:144:Times:predictive of the magnitude of the height deficit two to three years after the tsunami or growth in 
23:710:60927:21:21:72:209:695:144:Times:144:Times:height in the ensuing years.  
23:711:60957:21:20:108:517:674:144:Times:144:Times: There are several factors that potentially contribute to the fact that cohort that was in 
23:712:61047:20:21:72:526:654:144:Times:144:Times:utero at the time of the tsunami grew faster than the reference cohorts. First, the success of the 
23:713:61146:21:21:72:531:633:144:Times:144:Times:post-tsunami recovery effort resulted in rapid economic growth across all Aceh, providing new 
23:714:61240:21:21:72:524:612:144:Times:144:Times:earnings opportunities for many families. These opportunities included reconstruction-related 
23:715:61334:21:20:72:512:591:144:Times:144:Times:work such as construction and repair of roads, bridges and buildings; the opportunities also 
23:716:61427:20:21:72:536:571:144:Times:144:Times:include the provision of services to the workers and firms involved in the reconstruction such as 
23:717:61525:21:21:72:505:550:144:Times:144:Times:food preparation, logistics, housing and transportation. The fact that growth rates were no 
23:718:61617:21:20:72:533:529:144:Times:144:Times:different for children whose mothers saw or heard the water and those who did not is consistent 
23:719:61713:20:21:72:533:509:144:Times:144:Times:with the observation that the reconstruction effort benefited all the communities along the coast 
23:720:61811:21:21:72:541:488:144:Times:144:Times:of Aceh rather than only those communities that were hardest hit. This reflects two forces: on the 
23:721:61910:21:20:72:538:467:144:Times:144:Times:one hand, road and bridge reconstruction was spread across most of the coast of the province; on 
23:722:62007:20:21:72:490:447:144:Times:144:Times:the other hand, there was substantial migration in response to the reconstruction effort. 
23:723:62097:21:21:108:520:426:144:Times:144:Times: The second factor that potentially contributed to the rapid post-tsunami growth of the 
23:724:62184:21:21:72:538:405:144:Times:144:Times:affected cohort is that as parents rebuilt their livelihoods, they invested heavily in their surviving 
23:725:62287:21:20:72:528:384:144:Times:144:Times:children. This would be consistent with evidence on investments by Indonesian families in the 
23:726:62381:20:21:72:504:364:144:Times:144:Times:face of the 1998 financial crisis. Third, it is possible that some of the faster growth can be 
23:727:62476:21:21:72:529:343:144:Times:144:Times:attributed to post-uterine growth of premature births, although much of that catch-up growth is 
23:728:62572:21:20:72:332:322:144:Times:144:Times:likely to have occurred in the first few months of life. 
23:729:62629:20:21:108:502:302:144:Times:144:Times: We have investigated whether there are differences in the weight for height of the 
23:730:62712:21:21:72:492:281:144:Times:144:Times:exposed cohort and the reference cohort and find none. Nor do we find any differences 
23:731:62798:21:20:72:542:260:144:Times:144:Times:depending on the magnitude of exposure. These results are not surprising: the tsunami is likely to 
23:732:62897:20:21:72:513:240:144:Times:144:Times:have affected the weight of all cohorts. In fact it is precisely because we are drawing on the 
23:733:62992:21:21:72:540:219:144:Times:144:Times:biology of human growth and assume that the height of the reference cohort is not much affected 
23:734:63088:21:20:72:528:198:144:Times:144:Times:by exposure to the tsunami, at least relative to the cohort exposed in utero, that it is possible to 
23:735:63189:20:21:72:532:178:144:Times:144:Times:identify the causal impact of the tsunami on longer-term child nutrition. We have not examined 
23:736:63284:21:21:72:539:157:144:Times:144:Times:the growth of children born after the tsunami because there was a very large fertility boom in the 
23:737:63383:21:21:72:534:136:144:Times:144:Times:months of the tsunami and the mothers of those children tend to be younger and better educated 
23:738:63478:21:20:72:499:115:144:Times:144:Times:than the mothers of the children conceived before the tsunami (Nobles, Frankenberg and 
23:739:63565:20:21:72:154:95:144:Times:144:Times:Thomas, 2015).  
23:740:63581:21:21:108:487:74:144:Times:144:Times: In sum, the Indian Ocean tsunami was a large, unanticipated shock that caused 
23:741:63659:21:0:72:525:53:144:Times:144:Times:unprecedented disruption in the lives of people living along the coast of Aceh at the time. The 
24:742:63758:0:21:72:503:716:144:Times:144:Times:shock took a substantial toll on the height of children who were in utero at the time of the 
24:743:63851:21:21:72:530:695:144:Times:144:Times:tsunami. Had we not followed these children, we would have concluded that the tsunami likely 
24:744:63944:21:20:72:527:674:144:Times:144:Times:had a significant longer-term impact on the health and well-being of the population. However, 
24:745:64038:20:21:72:537:654:144:Times:144:Times:the deleterious impacts were for most of the children short-lived and the cohort that was in utero 
24:746:64137:21:21:71:530:633:144:Times:144:Times:at the time of the tsunami appear to have substantially benefited from the reconstruction effort. 
24:747:64235:21:21:71:527:612:144:Times:144:Times:Evidence from STAR documents that large scale, unanticipated shocks have consequences for 
24:748:64325:21:20:71:501:591:144:Times:144:Times:child growth, there is scope for catch-up growth and the evidence suggests that increased 
24:749:64415:20:21:72:498:571:144:Times:144:Times:resource availability because of the reconstruction efforts played a role in mitigating the 
24:750:64507:21:21:72:220:550:144:Times:144:Times:consequences of these shocks. 
24:751:64537:21:22:72:75:529:144:Times:144:Times: 
24:752:64537:22:22:72:159:507:195:Times:195:Times:5. Conclusions 
24:753:64552:22:21:108:524:485:144:Times:144:Times: Measurement of the casual impact of shocks on health and human capital is extremely 
24:754:64636:21:21:72:526:464:144:Times:144:Times:difficult. This is not a novel insight. The goal of this research has been to provide examples of 
24:755:64734:21:21:72:531:443:144:Times:144:Times:the impact of shocks on health and human capital that turn out to be much more complicated to 
24:756:64828:21:20:71:397:422:144:Times:144:Times:interpret than a prime facie description of the shock would suggest. 
24:757:64897:20:21:107:515:402:144:Times:144:Times: First, it is not straightforward to identify shocks that are, in fact shocks. Many of the 
24:758:64987:21:21:72:541:381:144:Times:144:Times:events that are treated as shocks in the literature are anticipated or at least potentially anticipated. 
24:759:65092:21:20:72:538:360:144:Times:144:Times:Even if the exact timing may be hard to predict, the expectation that there will be, for example, a 
24:760:65192:20:21:72:536:340:144:Times:144:Times:poor agricultural season periodically complicates interpretation of a poor season as a shock. It is 
24:761:65292:21:21:72:532:319:144:Times:144:Times:likely that those people who are affected by a poor season will invest in behaviors that mitigate 
24:762:65390:21:20:72:516:298:144:Times:144:Times:the impact of the poor season. In some cases, a shock is correlated with other changes in the 
24:763:65484:20:21:72:519:278:144:Times:144:Times:environment or possibly behaviors that contaminate interpretation of estimated effects of the 
24:764:65578:21:21:72:542:257:144:Times:144:Times:shock. This arises, for example, in the analysis of the 1918 influenza pandemic which occurred at 
24:765:65676:21:21:72:222:236:144:Times:144:Times:the same time as WWI ended.  
24:766:65705:21:20:108:523:215:144:Times:144:Times: Second, the assumption that as shocks unfold, individuals and those in their networks, 
24:767:65792:20:21:72:536:195:144:Times:144:Times:broadly defined, do not respond to the shock is not consistent with the core tenets of economics. 
24:768:65890:21:21:72:534:174:144:Times:144:Times:We have shown that in the face of a large financial and political crisis in Indonesia that resulted 
24:769:65990:21:20:72:538:153:144:Times:144:Times:in huge declines in resources, individuals, families and communities demonstrated extraordinary 
24:770:66086:20:21:72:529:133:144:Times:144:Times:resilience and adaptability and sought to mitigate the longer-term impacts of the crisis, even as 
24:771:66184:21:21:72:533:112:144:Times:144:Times:the magnitude and longevity of the crisis was being revealed. Indonesians are not unique in this 
24:772:66281:21:20:72:525:91:144:Times:144:Times:regard. Stillman and Thomas (2010) establish that in the face of the collapse of oil prices and, 
24:773:66378:20:0:72:536:71:144:Times:144:Times:therefore, a massive income shock in Russia, households substantially cut into food spending by 
25:774:66477:0:21:72:541:716:144:Times:144:Times:switching from more expensive calories and protein to less expensive calories and protein. While 
25:775:66574:21:21:72:534:695:144:Times:144:Times:spending on food declined by about 25%, calorie and protein intake hardly changed and there is 
25:776:66669:21:20:72:235:674:144:Times:144:Times:no evidence of a change in BMI.  
25:777:66702:20:21:108:504:654:144:Times:144:Times: Third, some shocks are so devastating that responses in the short-term are limited. 
25:778:66786:21:21:72:524:633:144:Times:144:Times:However, as the example from the Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami establishes, drawing 
25:779:66876:21:21:72:531:612:144:Times:144:Times:conclusions from short-term impacts can be substantially misleading. Over and above evidence 
25:780:66969:21:20:72:510:591:144:Times:144:Times:on the impacts on child height, we have investigated the impact of the death of one or both 
25:781:67061:20:21:72:536:571:144:Times:144:Times:parents on the human capital of children who were not killed by the tsunami. Studies of parental 
25:782:67158:21:21:72:497:550:144:Times:144:Times:death have established that the children of those parents tend to complete fewer years of 
25:783:67248:21:20:72:525:529:144:Times:144:Times:education (Case, Paxson and Ableidinger, 2004; Beegle, De Weerdt and Dercon, 2010; Evans 
25:784:67337:20:21:72:535:509:144:Times:144:Times:and Miguel, 2007). The majority of those studies are conducted in settings where parental death 
25:785:67433:21:21:72:535:488:144:Times:144:Times:is due to HIV/AIDS and is treated as if it were a shock. It is not clear that assumption is correct: 
25:786:67534:21:20:71:508:467:144:Times:144:Times:neither is the death likely to be a shock if there was an illness prior to the death nor are the 
25:787:67631:20:21:71:528:447:144:Times:144:Times:parents who contract HIV necessarily exchangeable with those who do not. We investigate the 
25:788:67723:21:21:71:535:426:144:Times:144:Times:impact of an arguably exogenous parental death (from the tsunami) on the education of children 
25:789:67818:21:21:71:540:405:144:Times:144:Times:age 9 to 14 and, separately, on outcomes of children age 15 to 17 at the time of the tsunami (Cas, 
25:790:67917:21:20:71:540:384:144:Times:144:Times:Frankenberg, Suriastini and Thomas, 2011). For young children (age 9-14), we find no impact of 
25:791:68012:20:21:71:536:364:144:Times:144:Times:parental death of education outcomes: the evidence suggests that other family members and also 
25:792:68107:21:21:71:532:343:144:Times:144:Times:members of the community rallied to the aid of these children. For older children, however, the 
25:793:68203:21:20:71:527:322:144:Times:144:Times:story is completely different. Males who lost one or both parents left school earlier and started 
25:794:68301:20:21:71:537:302:144:Times:144:Times:working earlier than males in the same communities who did not lose a parent. Females also left 
25:795:68397:21:21:72:477:281:144:Times:144:Times:school earlier and married earlier if one or both parents died. With the new earnings 
25:796:68483:21:20:72:526:260:144:Times:144:Times:opportunities that accompanied reconstruction, the longer-term consequences of these choices 
25:797:68576:20:21:72:523:240:144:Times:144:Times:are not obvious; they can only be investigated with data from further follow-ups of the STAR 
25:798:68669:21:21:72:138:219:144:Times:144:Times:respondents.  
25:799:68683:21:20:108:533:198:144:Times:144:Times: In sum, the picture of remarkable resilience that emerges from investigating the impacts 
25:800:68772:20:21:72:538:178:144:Times:144:Times:of major shocks on child health and human capital in Indonesia is nothing short of stunning. The 
25:801:68869:21:21:72:533:157:144:Times:144:Times:evidence clearly indicates that individuals, families and communities respond in manifold ways 
25:802:68964:21:21:72:510:136:144:Times:144:Times:to mitigate the short and the longer-term impacts of the shocks on the next generation. The 
25:803:69056:21:20:72:536:115:144:Times:144:Times:evidence suggests that individual, households, families and communities do everything they can 
25:804:69151:20:21:72:536:95:144:Times:144:Times:to avoid falling into poverty traps or pulling themselves out of poverty, even in the face of large-
25:805:69251:21:21:72:237:74:144:Times:144:Times:scale and unanticipated adversity.
