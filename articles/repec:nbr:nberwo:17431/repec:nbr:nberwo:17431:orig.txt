2:24:1020:28:14:72:540:588:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This paper investigates, in a simplified macro context, the joint determination of the (incorrect) perceived
2:25:1128:14:14:72:540:574:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:model and the equilibrium. I assume that the model is designed by a self-interested economist who
2:26:1225:14:14:72:540:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:knows the true structural model, but reports a distorted one so as to influence outcomes. This model
2:27:1325:14:14:72:540:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:influences both the people and the government; the latter tries to stabilize an unobserved demand shock
2:28:1428:14:14:72:540:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and will make different inferences about that shock depending on the model it uses. The model's choice
2:29:1530:14:14:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:is constrained by a set of autocoherence conditions that state that, in equilibrium, if everybody uses
2:30:1632:14:14:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the model then it must correctly predict the moments of the observables. I then study, in particular,
2:31:1733:14:28:72:537:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:how the models devised by the economists vary depending on whether they are "progressive" vs. "conservative".
2:32:1842:28:14:72:540:462:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The predictions depend greatly on the specifics of the economy being considered. But in many cases,
2:33:1941:14:14:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:they are plausible. For example, conservative economists will tend to report a lower keynesian multiplier,
2:34:2047:14:14:72:540:434:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and a greater long-term inflationary impact of output expansions. On the other hand, the economists'
2:35:2147:14:14:72:540:420:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:margin of manoeuver is constrained by the autocoherence conditions. Here, a "progressive" economist
2:36:2246:14:14:72:540:406:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:who promotes a Keynesian multiplier larger than it really is, must, to remain consistent, also claim
2:37:2346:14:14:72:540:392:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that demand shocks are more volatile than they really are. Otherwise, people will be disappointed by
2:38:2446:14:14:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the stabilization performance of fiscal policy and reject the hypothesized value of the multiplier. In
2:39:2548:14:14:72:540:364:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:some cases, autocoherence induces the experts to make, loosely speaking, ideological concessions
2:40:2644:14:14:72:540:350:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:on some parameter values. The analysis is illustrated by empirical evidence from the Survey of Professional

3:54:3000:52:30:102:238:444:301:g_d0_f3:301:g_d0_f3:1  Introduction
3:55:3015:30:19:102:491:414:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:The formation of expectations plays a key role in our understanding of the
3:56:3089:19:19:102:491:395:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:macroeconomy. Historically, economists have moved from a naive, mechani-
3:57:3161:19:19:102:490:376:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:cal representation of expectations to a more sophisticated one, where rational
3:58:3239:19:19:102:414:357:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:agents optimally use their information to forecast the future.
3:59:3301:19:19:120:491:338:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:To be able to do so, agents need to use a model, which allows them to
3:60:3370:19:19:102:491:319:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:compute the expectations of the relevant variables that they need in order
3:61:3444:19:19:102:491:300:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:to make their decisions. Typically, in the rational expectations literature, it
3:62:3523:19:19:102:326:281:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:is assumed that one uses the correct model.
3:63:3566:19:19:120:491:262:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:In practice, though, the "correct model" is unknown, and, to the extent
3:64:3637:19:19:102:491:243:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:that it is inevitably an abstraction, the concept of "correct model" is probably
3:65:3717:19:19:102:491:224:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:meaningless.  Instead, we observed different models produced by different
3:66:3790:19:18:102:480:205:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:economists. Depending on the model one is using, one will act differently.
3:67:3864:18:19:120:491:187:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:This issue has been recognized by the recent literature, which studies what
3:68:3939:19:19:102:490:168:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:happens if , instead of being in rational expectations equilibrium (REE), the
3:69:4016:19:19:102:491:149:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:economy settles at a self-confirming equilibrium (SCE), where people use an
3:70:4091:19:19:102:490:130:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:incorrect model to formulate their policies and expectations (Essential here is
3:71:4170:19:19:102:490:111:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Sargent (2008)). In an SCE, the model is compatible with the available data;
3:72:4246:19:19:102:491:92:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:but if people were to deviate from their optimal policies and experiment with
3:73:4323:19:0:102:389:73:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:off-equilibrium paths, their beliefs would be invalidated.
4:74:4382:0:19:120:491:651:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:In such a world, economists have substantial influence over macroeco-
4:75:4451:19:19:102:490:632:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:nomic outcomes: they can manipulate them by designing their theory ap-
4:76:4521:19:19:102:491:613:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:propriately.  This influence comes from two ingredients.  First, unlike the
4:77:4596:19:19:102:490:594:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:physical world, in the economy the equilibrium outcome depends on the the-
4:78:4670:19:19:102:490:575:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:ory, because the theory is used by the agents to decide on their actions.
4:79:4743:19:19:102:490:556:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Second, the data do not allow to distinguish between alternative models, de-
4:80:4819:19:19:102:491:537:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:spite that these alternative models have important and contradictory policy
4:81:4894:19:19:102:171:518:145:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:implications.1
4:82:4908:19:19:120:491:499:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Of course, no economist will ever concede that he or she is motivated
4:83:4977:19:19:102:490:480:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:by a political or personal agenda. Instead, they would argue that they are
4:84:5051:19:18:102:491:461:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:pursuing truth in a disinterested fashion.  Yet it is not difficult tofind a
4:85:5127:18:19:102:490:443:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:correlation between an economist’s personal and political background and the
4:86:5203:19:19:102:490:424:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:nature of his vision. For example, the respective visions of the working of the
4:87:5282:19:19:102:491:405:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:macroeconomy by Keynes and Hayekfit well with their political preferences.
4:88:5356:19:19:120:491:386:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:This does not mean that the expert can say anything he wants.  The
4:89:5422:19:19:102:495:367:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:models been produced must be "credible", in that their predictionsfitthe
4:90:5494:19:19:102:491:348:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:data. But, if the expert is influential, the data will themselves reflect the
4:91:5571:19:19:102:491:329:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:fact that people use his model to make their decisions.  I define a model
4:92:5644:19:19:102:490:310:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:as "autocoherent" if, conditional on people using it to form expectations, it
4:93:5721:19:19:102:490:291:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:replicates the joint distribution of the observables. In other words, use of
4:94:5797:19:19:102:490:272:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the model by all agents support a self-confirming equilibrium (but the same
4:95:5872:19:19:102:491:253:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:model could be defeated if, say, only a fraction of the people use it. Hence
4:96:5948:19:19:102:491:234:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:it is of some use to distinguish between autocoherence, a property of the
4:97:6021:19:18:102:491:215:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:model, and self-confirming-ness, a property of the equilibrium). A natural
4:98:6095:18:19:102:491:197:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:restriction to impose on a model is to be autocoherence. Otherwise, people
4:99:6169:19:19:102:238:178:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:will eventually abandon it.
4:100:6196:19:18:120:491:159:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:This paper investigates, in a simplified macro context, the joint deter-
4:101:6268:18:16:116:491:141:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:1King and Watson (1994) show how the same time series on inflation and unemployment
4:102:6351:16:12:102:490:125:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:can be credibly interpreted in either a "keynesian" or a "monetarist" light.  Friedman
4:103:6437:12:12:102:491:113:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:(1966) points out that a model is only identified within a given specification, and therefore
4:104:6530:12:12:102:491:101:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:that no amount of data will suffice to identify the true model, as the dimension of the
4:105:6617:12:0:102:281:89:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:space of possible specificationsisinfinite.
5:106:6661:0:19:102:491:651:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:mination of the prevailing model and the equilibrium.  I assume that the
5:107:6733:19:19:102:490:632:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:model is designed by an economist who has his own preferences and knows
5:108:6804:19:19:102:491:613:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the true structural model. This model influences both the people and the
5:109:6876:19:19:102:490:594:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:government; while the people need to know future prices and can just use
5:110:6948:19:19:102:491:575:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the distribution of these prices to form expectations, the government tries
5:111:7023:19:19:102:491:556:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:to stabilize an unobserved demand shock and will make different inferences
5:112:7097:19:19:102:491:537:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:about that shock depending on the model it uses. People care about output
5:113:7170:19:19:102:491:518:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:stability but also the stability of government spending. The greater the loss
5:114:7247:19:19:102:490:499:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:from government spending volatility, the more "conservative" the individual.
5:115:7323:19:19:102:490:480:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:I then study how the models devised by the economists varies depending on
5:116:7396:19:18:102:361:461:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:whether they are "progressive" vs. "conservative".
5:117:7446:18:19:120:491:443:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:In the present paper, there is a single expert who sets the theory (intellec-
5:118:7523:19:19:102:490:424:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:tual monopoly). In related work (2011b), I also study the case of intellectual
5:119:7601:19:19:102:491:405:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:competition, when several schools design different models, and each of them
5:120:7676:19:19:102:326:386:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:influences only a fraction of the population.
5:121:7721:19:19:120:491:367:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:The predictions depend greatly on the specifics of the economy being con-
5:122:7794:19:19:102:490:348:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:sidered. But in many cases, they are plausible. For example, conservative
5:123:7867:19:19:102:490:329:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:economists will tend to report a lower Keynesian multiplier, and a greater
5:124:7941:19:19:102:491:310:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:long-term inflationary impact of output expansions. On then other hand, the
5:125:8016:19:19:102:491:291:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:economists’ margin of maneuver is constrained by the autocoherence condi-
5:126:8089:19:19:102:491:272:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:tions. Here, a "progressive" economist who promotes a Keynesian multiplier
5:127:8163:19:19:102:491:253:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:larger than it really is, must, to remain consistent, also claim that demand
5:128:8239:19:19:102:490:234:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:shocks are more volatile than they really are.  Otherwise, people will be
5:129:8312:19:18:102:491:215:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:disappointed by the stabilization performance offiscal policy and reject the
5:130:8388:18:19:102:491:197:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:hypothesized value of the multiplier. In some cases, autocoherence induces
5:131:8462:19:19:102:491:178:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the experts to make, loosely speaking, ideological concessions on some para-
5:132:8538:19:19:102:491:159:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:meter values. In Saint-Paul (2011c), I consider a richer example where one
5:133:8612:19:19:102:491:140:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:can show that the price to be paid for reporting a too high inflationary cost
5:134:8689:19:19:102:491:121:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:of output is that one should report a too low relative variance of aggregate
5:135:8765:19:19:102:171:102:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:supply shock.
5:136:8778:19:0:120:491:83:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:I then illustrate the analysis using the Survey of Professional Forecasters.
6:137:8855:0:19:102:490:651:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:The idea is that different forecasters will use different models, but that these
6:138:8935:19:19:102:490:632:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:models are constrained by autocoherence conditions. For each forecaster I
6:139:9008:19:19:102:491:613:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:estimate a pseudo-model whose coefficients capture the response of GDP fore-
6:140:9084:19:19:102:491:594:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:casts on inflation forecasts and government expenditure forecasts. A tight
6:141:9158:19:19:102:491:575:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:trade-offappears among those coefficients, which captures the fact that the
6:142:9233:19:19:102:490:556:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:pseudo-models must match the average growth rates of those variables. The
6:143:9306:19:19:102:491:537:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:evidence also suggests that forecasters who believe that expansions are less
6:144:9382:19:19:102:491:518:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:inflationary, also tend to believe that public spending is more expansionary.
6:145:9459:19:19:102:491:499:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Rather than an autocoherence condition, this seems to indicate that models
6:146:9533:19:19:102:490:480:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:more favorable to expansionary policies tend to act on both margins — they
6:147:9607:19:18:102:491:461:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:downplay the inflationary costs of output (i.e. they believe in aflat aggre-
6:148:9683:18:19:102:491:443:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:gate supply curve) and overemphasize the expansionary effects government
6:149:9755:19:19:102:241:424:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:spending at the same time.
6:150:9781:19:19:120:386:405:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:The paper is related to several strands of literature.
6:151:9835:19:19:120:491:386:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:In the Political Economy literature, an important paper by Piketty (1995)
6:152:9908:19:19:102:491:367:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:considers a redistributive problem where people may form different beliefs
6:153:9982:19:19:102:491:348:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:about the effort elasticity of income. Because of the feedback effects of these
6:154:10061:19:19:102:490:329:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:beliefs on taxation, they are self reinforcing and multiple equilibria may arise.
6:155:10142:19:19:102:490:310:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:This idea has been further pursued by Bénabou and Ok (2001) and Alesina
6:156:10213:19:19:102:214:291:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:and Angeletos (2005).
6:157:10234:19:19:120:491:272:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:The idea of self-confirming equilibrium was proposed by Fudenberg and
6:158:10303:19:19:102:490:253:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Levine (1993), who apply it to a discussion of the Lucas critique (2007),
6:159:10376:19:19:102:490:234:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:arguing that wrong policies may persist as long as no experimentation takes
6:160:10451:19:18:102:490:215:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:place to elicit the correct model, a point about identification I discuss below.
6:161:10531:18:19:120:491:197:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Sargent (2008) contains a thorough discussion of the role of incorrect
6:162:10601:19:19:102:491:178:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:perceived models and how they may have shaped policies in the past, and
6:163:10672:19:19:102:491:159:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:he provides a simple example of a policy maker who believes in a systematic
6:164:10747:19:19:102:491:140:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:trade-offbetween expected inflation and unemployment, while the actual ob-
6:165:10821:19:19:102:491:121:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:served trade-offis entirely driven by inflationary surprises. In equilibrium,
6:166:10898:19:19:102:490:102:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the systematic component of monetary policy is held constant because that
6:167:10971:19:0:102:491:83:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:is the optimal policy, and this makes it impossible to sort out the effects of
7:168:11050:0:19:102:491:651:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:expected versus unexpected inflation. This brings about the issue of identi-
7:169:11126:19:19:102:491:632:145:g_d0_f5:145:g_d0_f2:fication which is also discussed below in Sections 2.2 and 4.1. Along similar
7:170:11203:19:19:102:491:613:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:lines, Sargent et al. (2006) reverse-engineer a time series for the perceived
7:171:11280:19:19:102:490:594:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:model used by the Fed in setting its policy based on actual data and policy
7:172:11355:19:19:102:491:575:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:actions. How beliefs affect policies and how they evolve is also discussed by
7:173:11432:19:19:102:315:556:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Buera et al (2011) and Saint-Paul (2010).
7:174:11473:19:19:120:491:537:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:The concept of autocoherence (or self-confirming equilibrium) is also
7:175:11542:19:19:102:490:518:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:present in the literature on learning and indeterminacy. Some sunspot equi-
7:176:11617:19:19:102:491:499:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:libria may be consistent with autocoherent models that may be such that
7:177:11688:19:19:102:490:480:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the Lucas critique does not hold (Farmer, 1991). In the learning literature
7:178:11763:19:18:102:490:461:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:(Evans and Honkapohja, 2003), people postulate a law of motion and grad-
7:179:11835:18:19:102:491:443:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:ually learn the parameters of this law of motion over time, by running least
7:180:11911:19:19:102:491:424:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:squares regressions. Asymptotically, the equilibrium can by construction be
7:181:11986:19:19:102:491:405:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:supported by an autocoherent model as defined by the postulated law of
7:182:12056:19:19:102:141:386:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:motion.
7:183:12063:19:19:120:491:367:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Finally the paper is also related to the literature on cheap talk (Crawford
7:184:12138:19:19:102:490:348:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:and Sobel, 1982). Here, however, a totally different route is taken. In the
7:185:12213:19:19:102:490:329:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:cheap talk literature, the preferences of the expert are known and any signal
7:186:12290:19:19:102:491:310:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:can be reverse engineered into the true value of the parameter. However for
7:187:12365:19:19:102:490:291:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:such reverse engineering to take place, one needs to know the relevant proba-
7:188:12442:19:19:102:491:272:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:bility distributions in addition to the expert’s preferences, that is, one needs
7:189:12522:19:19:102:491:253:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:amodel.Since this model can only be obtained by an expert, some expert
7:190:12592:19:19:102:490:234:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:must be trusted. Here, the expert is trusted, and his preferences are not
7:191:12665:19:18:102:491:215:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:known. While in the cheap talk literature the expert can only send unbiased
7:192:12740:18:19:102:491:197:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:signals, here what is constraining him instead is the set of autocoherence
7:193:12814:19:19:102:491:178:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:conditions: while the signals (i.e. the models’ parameters reported by the
7:194:12888:19:0:102:491:159:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:expert) can be biased, the model’s predictions are not falsified in equilibrium.
8:195:12969:0:22:102:491:651:301:g_d0_f3:301:g_d0_f3:2  Autocoherence and the scope for influenc-
8:196:13013:22:31:131:242:629:301:g_d0_f3:301:g_d0_f3:ing outcomes
8:197:13025:31:19:102:491:598:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:The central idea of my approach is that, in order to make choices and form
8:198:13099:19:19:102:490:579:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:their expectations, people need a model, but that model may not be the cor-
8:199:13174:19:19:102:490:560:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:rect model of the economy. I then want to develop a theory of how the model
8:200:13249:19:19:102:491:541:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:used by the people is determined and how it affects the equilibrium outcome.
8:201:13325:19:19:102:490:522:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:There exists a class of people whose job is to produce social representations.
8:202:13403:19:19:102:491:503:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:These people are called the intellectuals. Among intellectuals, some people
8:203:13478:19:18:102:491:484:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:produce a specific kind of representations: the macroeconomic models that
8:204:13551:18:19:102:496:466:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:agents (households,firms, and the government) use. This specificcategory
8:205:13623:19:19:102:323:447:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:of intellectuals are called macroeconomists.
8:206:13667:19:19:120:491:428:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:In the model, or meta-model, developed below, it will be assumed that
8:207:13736:19:19:102:496:409:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:macroeconomists know the correct model and knowingly report another model.
8:208:13810:19:19:102:490:390:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:This is a convenient (meta) modelling choice but is to be taken as a simpli-
8:209:13886:19:19:102:490:371:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:fying assumption and a metaphor for the much more subtle ways in which
8:210:13956:19:19:102:491:352:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:ideological biases affect the design of theories in practice. These mechanisms
8:211:14034:19:35:102:361:333:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:are indeed an important topic for further research.
8:212:14085:35:26:102:244:298:209:g_d0_f3:209:g_d0_f3:2.1  Autocoherence
8:213:14103:26:19:102:490:272:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Intellectuals cannot force people to believe anything they want. A model
8:214:14175:19:19:102:490:253:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:which predicts that 2+2=5 will soon be discredited and abandoned. I will
8:215:14247:19:19:102:491:234:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:impose the strongest discipline on the set of models that macroeconomists
8:216:14320:19:19:102:491:215:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:may pick, by assuming that they must beautocoherent.A model is autoco-
8:217:14390:19:19:102:320:196:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:herent if it satisfies the following property:
8:218:14436:19:19:120:491:177:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Assume all agents use that model in order to compute the probability
8:219:14504:19:19:102:491:158:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:distribution of the variables of interest to them, and then implement their
8:220:14579:19:19:102:490:139:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:corresponding optimal policy. This delivers an equilibrium, which is char-
8:221:14653:19:19:102:491:120:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:acterized by the joint probability distribution of the endogenous variables
8:222:14728:19:19:102:491:101:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:conditional on the exogenous variables. A subset of the variables are observ-
8:223:14805:19:0:102:491:82:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:able. Then, the equilibrium joint distribution of the observables is equal to
9:224:14883:0:19:102:317:651:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the one predicted by the perceived model.
9:225:14924:19:19:120:491:632:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:This essentially means that if everybody believes in the model, then it
9:226:14995:19:19:102:490:613:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:is not defeated by the observation. This concept is akin to that of a self-
9:227:15070:19:19:102:490:594:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:confirming equilibrium in game theory (See Fudenberg and Levine (2003)),
9:228:15142:19:19:102:490:575:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:but autocoherence is a property of a model in addition to that of an equi-
9:229:15216:19:19:102:491:556:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:librium. In Saint-Paul (2011a), I provide some formal definitions and some
9:230:15290:19:29:102:402:537:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:results. It is important to remember the following aspects:
9:231:15349:29:19:120:491:508:145:g_d0_f8:145:g_d0_f2:•People use the perceived model in the standard rational expectations
9:232:15418:19:19:132:491:489:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:way. That is, they assume that model is correct, that it is common
9:233:15484:19:19:132:491:470:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:knowledge, and that all agents use it to form their expectations. They
9:234:15554:19:19:132:491:451:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:do so both when using the model to form their own expectations and
9:235:15620:19:19:132:491:432:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:when deriving the predicted observable moments to confront them with

9:238:15784:19:19:132:491:366:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:rather than a sample distribution, means that, for simplicity, the model
9:239:15856:19:19:132:491:347:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:has to be valid against any arbitrarily large number of observations.

9:242:16055:19:18:132:491:290:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:have to remain within the confidence intervals implied by the observed

9:245:16210:19:19:132:491:224:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:is indeed the case, i.e. the economist is in a situation of intellectual

9:247:16343:18:19:132:491:187:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:different models, then the equilibrium would depend on all the models
9:248:16412:19:19:132:491:168:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:in use. A model might be autocoherent, i.e. consistent with the equi-
9:249:16481:19:19:132:491:149:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:librium data if everybody were using it, and yet in contradiction with
9:250:16551:19:19:132:491:130:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the data in an equilibrium where only a fraction of the population is
9:251:16620:19:19:132:491:111:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:using it. In such a case, instead of autocoherence one would impose a
9:252:16689:19:19:132:491:92:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:restriction that all models in use simultaneously predict the distribu-
9:253:16760:19:0:132:491:73:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:tion of the observables in equilibrium. In what follows, though, I only
10:254:16832:0:19:132:491:651:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:consider the case of intellectual monopoly (intellectual competition is

10:256:16936:32:19:120:491:600:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:A relevant question is: Why would the government believe the economists
10:257:17007:19:19:102:490:581:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:and not treat their predictions as cheap talk? The answer is that the gov-
10:258:17081:19:19:102:491:562:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:ernmenthasto do something and has to usesomemodel in order to design
10:259:17149:19:19:102:491:543:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:its policy. It cannot escape the necessity of trusting an expert and using
10:260:17223:19:19:102:490:524:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:his model. It is the production of such models by a trusted expert that the

10:263:17359:27:19:102:491:444:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:The scope for exerting intellectual influence through the choice of a model
10:264:17434:19:19:102:491:425:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:and its parameters, while meeting the constraint that the model matches the
10:265:17509:19:19:102:490:406:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:observables, clearly has to do with identification. If all the parameters of the
10:266:17589:19:19:102:491:387:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:correct model are identified uniquely from the moments of the observables,
10:267:17663:19:19:102:491:368:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:then this means that matching those moments reveals the correct model, and
10:268:17737:19:19:102:491:349:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:it will then typically be the case that the autocoherence constraints will force
10:269:17817:19:18:102:491:330:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the economist to reveal the correct model. If the perceived model has the
10:270:17890:18:19:102:491:312:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:same parameters as the correct model, and only differs from it, potentially, by
10:271:17969:19:19:102:491:293:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the actual values of that parameters, then the number of equations involved
10:272:18044:19:19:102:491:274:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:in the identification of the structural parameters is the same as the number
10:273:18120:19:19:102:252:255:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:of autocoherence restrictions.
10:274:18150:19:19:120:490:236:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:If some parameters are identified (in the econometric sense), then it is
10:275:18222:19:19:102:490:217:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:easy to prove that the autocoherence conditions compel the economist to
10:276:18293:19:19:102:491:198:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:reveal their true value (this is not completely straightforward because the set

10:278:18453:15:12:102:491:164:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:message to an uninformed one. The uninformed one knows the true distribution of the
10:279:18536:12:12:102:495:152:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:signal as well as the preferences of the informedparty.Insuchasetting,anyattemptto

10:281:18711:12:12:102:491:128:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:or partially revealing in an unbiased way (that is, the same message is being sent for a
10:282:18799:12:12:102:490:116:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:cluster of signals, and the recipient makes an unbiased inference conditional on the signal
10:283:18890:12:12:102:490:104:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:being in that cluster). Here the government does now know the right model nor does it
10:284:18975:12:12:102:490:92:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:know the experts’ preferences. It needs to rely on some expert to be able to use a model
10:285:19063:12:0:102:193:80:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:and make a decision.
11:286:19084:0:19:102:491:651:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:of identified parameters is dependent on the equilibrium, while two different
11:287:19161:19:19:102:485:632:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:autocoherent models are typically associated with two different equilibria).
11:288:19237:19:19:120:491:613:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Under-identification matters to the extent that the optimal decision rule
11:289:19310:19:19:102:490:594:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:of the agents depend on the true structural parameters of the economy, not
11:290:19384:19:19:102:490:575:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:just on the reduced form parameters. In turn, the equilibrium depends on the
11:291:19460:19:19:102:490:556:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:beliefs regarding these true structural parameters. In other words, underi-
11:292:19535:19:19:102:491:537:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:dentification is "instrumentalized" by the intellectuals in order to manipulate
11:293:19614:19:34:102:153:518:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:outcomes.
11:294:19623:34:27:102:426:484:209:g_d0_f3:209:g_d0_f3:2.3  When does the perceived model matter?

11:296:19734:19:19:102:491:438:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:his model is autocoherent? Here we have to distinguish between three cases.
11:297:19809:19:19:120:495:419:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:First,itmaybethatallthevariableswhoseexpectationsmatterforpri-
11:298:19871:19:19:102:491:400:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:vate decisions are observable. This means that people do not really need a
11:299:19945:19:19:102:491:381:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:structural model. All they need to know is the joint distribution between the
11:300:20022:19:19:102:491:362:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:forecasted variables and the variables in their information set when they form
11:301:20100:19:19:102:490:343:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:their expectations. One can then solve for a rational expectations equilib-
11:302:20175:19:18:102:490:324:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:rium in a standard way, replacing forecasts by expectations using the actual
11:303:20251:18:19:102:491:306:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:equilibrium distribution of the variable. If this procedure yields a unique
11:304:20326:19:19:102:491:287:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:equilibrium, then the economy must be at this equilibrium. This does not
11:305:20398:19:19:102:491:268:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:mean that one could not use several alternative models. But all those models
11:306:20474:19:19:102:490:249:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:must be autocoherent, and therefore replicate the equilibrium distribution of
11:307:20551:19:19:102:490:230:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the observables, implying that one must be at an REE. Since that REE is
11:308:20622:19:19:102:491:211:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:unique, all autocoherent models are equivalent in that they deliver the same
11:309:20698:19:19:102:490:192:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:REE. To put it another way, in such a configuration, the conditional ex-
11:310:20770:19:19:102:491:173:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:pectations involved in the model’s equations are one of the moments of the
11:311:20844:19:19:102:491:154:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:observables. Consequently, all autocoherent models must be such that those
11:312:20918:19:19:102:491:135:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:expectations must be equal to their equivalent sample conditional average.
11:313:20992:19:19:102:491:116:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:If this restriction is enough to yield a unique outcome, then the use of any
11:314:21068:19:19:102:491:97:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:autocoherent model can only deliver that outcome.  A simple example is
11:315:21138:19:0:102:224:78:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:discussed in section 4.2.
12:316:21164:0:19:120:491:651:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Second, it may be that the variables that need to be forecast are ob-
12:317:21233:19:19:102:491:632:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:servable, but that the REE is not unique. This typically arises in dynamic
12:318:21307:19:19:102:491:613:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:settings such as=++1where the relevant eigenvalues are such
12:319:21375:19:19:102:491:594:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:that ruling out explosive solutions is not enough to deliver a unique REE
12:320:21448:19:19:102:490:575:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:equilibrium. This case has been studied at length by the literature on in-
12:321:21522:19:19:102:490:556:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:determinacy and learning (see especially Evans and Honkapohja (2003) and
12:322:21594:19:19:102:490:537:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Farmer (1991)), which studies learning by postulating a perceived law of
12:323:21666:19:19:102:490:518:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:motion and looks at the stability of the actual law of motion as a function
12:324:21741:19:19:102:491:499:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:of the perceived one. Hence in this literature autocoherence is imposed in
12:325:21815:19:19:102:490:480:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:that the perceived law of motion must match the observed one, and further
12:326:21888:19:18:102:491:461:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:restrictions on stability of this mapping often rule out the sunspots (this is
12:327:21966:18:19:102:490:443:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:because the perceived law of motion leads to a backward looking formation
12:328:22039:19:19:102:491:424:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:of expectations, so that the dynamics become truly unstable if1). In
12:329:22109:19:19:102:491:405:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f9:Evans and Honkapohja (2003), stability rules out sunspots regardless of
12:330:22181:19:19:102:491:386:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:and therefore there is no scope for an expert to coordinate the economy on
12:331:22255:19:19:102:491:367:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:a sunspot, as long as his model is reducible to a perceived law of motion in
12:332:22331:19:19:102:491:348:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the class considered by Evans and Honkapohja, although the fundamental is
12:333:22404:19:19:102:491:329:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:also unstable if1so that the theory is silent about what happens in this
12:334:22478:19:19:102:491:310:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:case. If one imposes autocoherence but not stability, the scope for picking
12:335:22553:19:19:102:490:291:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:a sunspot is larger but it depends on the class of models being considered.
12:336:22628:19:19:102:495:272:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:If the model’s specification rules out the specificdynamicsthatcharacterize
12:337:22703:19:19:102:490:253:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the sunspot, an autocoherent model will only yield the fundamental solution.
12:338:22779:19:19:120:491:234:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Another case in which multiplicity (of a very different kind) arises is
12:339:22850:19:18:102:491:215:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:when the correct model is nonlinear. It is then easy to coordinate agents
12:340:22923:18:19:102:490:197:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:on one’s preferred equilibrium by picking a model with a single equilibrium,
12:341:22999:19:19:102:491:178:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:which happens to have a unique equilibrium which is the one preferred by
12:342:23071:19:19:102:490:159:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the expert.  A natural candidate for such an equilibrium is then the lin-
12:343:23144:19:19:102:491:140:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:earized correct model around the preferred equilibrium. Here, and contrary
12:344:23218:19:19:102:491:121:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:to the examples worked out below, the parameters of the perceived model are
12:345:23293:19:19:102:491:102:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:"locally correct", but its functional form is misspecified. If the economy is
12:346:23370:19:0:102:491:83:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:locked at this equilibrium and has never visited a zone remote from it, there
13:347:23449:0:19:102:490:651:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:is a sense in which the perceived model is correct; in particular, any exper-

13:351:23699:19:19:120:491:575:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Finally, it may be that the variables of interest are not observed. Differ-
13:352:23774:19:19:102:491:556:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:ent models will relate them differently to the observables, and thus lead to
13:353:23850:19:19:102:491:537:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:different inferences about those observables. But the models have the con-
13:354:23924:19:19:102:491:518:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:sistency requirements that they explain the observables. In such a case, the
13:355:24000:19:19:102:491:499:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:’true’ structural model is underidentified but which structural model is used
13:356:24077:19:19:102:491:480:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:affects expectations and thus the behavior of the economy. Economists can
13:357:24150:19:18:102:491:461:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:influence those outcomes by proposing alternative structural models; these
13:358:24224:18:19:102:490:443:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:alternative models are equally good in that they are all autocoherent, but,
13:359:24299:19:19:102:491:424:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:contrary to thefirst case, which model is used matters because it will change
13:360:24376:19:40:102:485:405:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the expectations of the relevant variables. This is the case in what follows.

13:369:24803:19:19:102:491:175:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:is observed prior to the government deciding on the expenditure levelIt

14:393:26224:19:19:102:305:280:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:how the perceived model is determined.

14:398:26561:19:19:102:491:185:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:parameters must be positive (for the variances this is actually a feasibility
14:399:26638:19:19:102:490:166:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:constraint rather than a plausibility one). More generally there is a set of
14:400:26714:19:19:102:491:147:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:admissible values for the perceived model’s parameters. I will refer to the

20:652:34964:19:19:102:491:176:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:clear solution to that would be (as pointed out in the self-confirming equilib-

21:661:35654:19:19:102:491:594:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:it could introduce an arbitrarily small noise and estimate the correctat an

26:870:43485:27:19:102:491:384:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Given its relevance, it is important to discuss the empiricalfindings of Fuchs
26:871:43563:19:19:102:491:365:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:et al. (1998). These authors develop a systematic investigation of labor and
26:872:43639:19:19:102:491:346:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:public economists’ policy views. They document substantial disparities in
26:873:43712:19:19:102:491:327:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:those views and they want to understand whether these difference are driven
26:874:43787:19:19:102:491:308:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:by different values ("tastes") versus disagreement on the actual parameters
26:875:43862:19:19:102:405:289:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:that drive the effect of policies on outcomes ("the model").
26:876:43922:19:18:120:491:270:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:In the above model, economists have no interest in revealing their pref-
26:877:43994:18:19:102:491:252:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:erences (if compelled to do so, they would report the same preferences as
26:878:44067:19:19:102:491:233:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the government, regardless of their true preferences). Therefore we would
26:879:44140:19:19:102:490:214:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:expect all policy views to be entirely driven by beliefs about parameters,
26:880:44214:19:19:102:491:195:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:while in reality they are driven by different tastes and the economists pick
26:881:44290:19:19:102:316:176:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the parameters that suit their tastes best.
26:882:44333:19:19:120:491:157:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Fuchs et al. have run a survey of attitudes among economists and ask them
26:883:44406:19:19:102:490:138:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:to position themselves on a left/right axis, as well as their opinions about the
26:884:44486:19:19:102:491:119:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:value of key economic parameters (such as, say, labor supply elasticity) and
26:885:44562:19:19:102:490:100:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:their support for a number of policy measures. They then regress the support
26:886:44638:19:0:102:491:81:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:for policy measures on both the ideological positioning of the respondent
27:887:44713:0:19:102:491:651:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:and his/her answers regarding parameter values. Overall, they claim that
27:888:44785:19:19:102:494:632:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:ideology matters much more than parameters, although this is chieflydueto
27:889:44858:19:19:102:491:613:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the lack of statistical significance of the latter, not to the magnitude of the
27:890:44937:19:19:102:214:594:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:estimated coefficients.
27:891:44960:19:19:120:491:575:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Of key interest to us here, however, is the extent to which ideological
27:892:45031:19:19:102:491:556:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:positioning may affect one’s perceived parameter values.The authors look at

27:895:45261:19:19:102:491:499:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:policy positions, it is nevertheless significant, as one would expect from the
27:896:45339:19:34:102:236:480:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:logic of the present paper.

27:900:45502:19:19:102:491:382:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the ideas developed above with the data. As the preceding analysis makes
27:901:45574:19:19:102:491:363:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:clear, the models that will arise depend on the ideological stance of the expert
27:902:45654:19:19:102:491:344:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:as well as on the autocoherence conditions and on the correct model. We
27:903:45725:19:18:102:490:325:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:have found that the outcome is highly sensitive to the parameters of the
27:904:45797:18:19:102:491:307:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:correct model and to the set of parameters that are known. This makes it
27:905:45869:19:19:102:490:288:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:hard to come up with a tight prediction about, say, the value of a parameter.

27:908:46076:19:19:102:491:231:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:dictions across experts is driven by their ideological differences. The SPF is
27:909:46154:19:19:102:491:212:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:a panel of macroeconomic predictions by a large number of forecasters. It
27:910:46227:19:19:102:491:193:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:can be used in a cross section to analyze the dispersion in forecasts, and its
27:911:46305:19:19:102:491:174:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:longitudinal dimension can be used tounderstand how models evolve over
27:912:46375:19:19:102:490:155:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:time. In what follows I will use those data to answer the following questions:
27:913:46453:19:19:120:491:136:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:1. What kind of autocoherence conditions are imposed on those forecasts?
27:914:46525:19:19:120:491:117:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:2. Can we point to a correlation between the forecasts and some measure
27:915:46596:19:19:102:377:98:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:of the forecaster’s ideological position or self-interest?
27:916:46654:19:0:120:491:79:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:3. How do the models evolve over time, under the influence of new em-

28:919:46807:27:19:102:490:581:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Each observation in the SPF is a year x quarter x individual forecasters.
28:920:46880:19:19:102:491:562:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:The available variables include forecasts for GDP, inflation, unemployment,

28:926:47323:19:18:102:491:448:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:aggregate these fourfiles into two samples, one corresponding to 1968:4-

28:928:47468:19:19:102:491:411:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:that the public expenditure variable which plays a key role in the analysis is

28:930:47616:19:19:120:491:373:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:The data set only contains forecasts, not the actual models used by the

28:932:47762:19:19:102:491:335:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:forecasts. Even if a forecaster uses apublic macroeconometric model, such

28:935:47982:19:19:102:491:278:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:remains implicit. Despite these caveats, it is possible to estimate for each

28:943:48521:19:19:102:491:103:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:for a given forecaster. Thus, I have only kept forecasters with at least 10

30:993:51469:19:19:102:491:318:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:driven by both the autocoherence constraints and the optimal choices of the

30:995:51617:19:19:102:491:280:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:unexpected disturbances enter the perceived model, and the (second order)
30:996:51690:19:18:102:490:261:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:autocoherence conditions involve those variances. But these disturbances do

32:1051:54935:30:19:120:491:392:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Overall, this suggests that forecasters who believe in a larger Keynesian
32:1052:55008:19:19:102:490:373:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:multiplier also believe in a larger (more positive, less negative) response of
32:1053:55086:19:19:102:491:354:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:output to inflation; under the AD interpretation of the pseudo-model, this
32:1054:55160:19:19:102:491:335:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:could mean, for example, that they think the real exchange rate affects out-

32:1056:55315:19:19:102:490:297:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Keynesian multiplier and also that activity is less sensitive to "competitive-
32:1057:55393:19:19:102:491:278:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:ness". The price to pay for this, in terms of autocoherence, is that they must
32:1058:55471:19:19:102:491:259:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:also be more pessimistic, i.e. have a lower value of the intercept0Because

32:1062:55773:19:19:102:491:183:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:about the GDP growth rates that would prevail if prices and government
32:1063:55843:19:19:102:268:164:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:expenditures remained constant.
32:1064:55874:19:18:120:491:145:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Therefore, this positive correlation seems chiefly driven by the preferences
32:1065:55950:18:19:102:491:127:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:of the forecaster, who act on both margins in order to promote their preferred

33:1086:57086:27:19:102:490:270:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Do pseudo-models evolve over time or is their distribution stationary? We
33:1087:57159:19:19:102:491:251:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:can answer that question by correlating the pseudo-models coefficients with

34:1102:57927:19:19:120:491:529:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:We see that over time, as captured by their pseudo-models, forecasters

34:1104:58073:19:19:102:491:491:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:margin"7, i.e. forecasters who were more active recently tend to use a model
34:1105:58149:19:19:102:495:472:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:more favorable to government aggregate intervention. This effectisstronger,

34:1108:58283:31:19:102:491:371:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:This paper has hopefully provided some insights about the interaction be-
34:1109:58356:19:19:102:494:352:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:tween the ideological stance of economistsandthenatureofthemodelsthey

34:1111:58499:19:19:102:486:314:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:comings, that also constitute two important directions for further research.
34:1112:58575:19:19:120:491:295:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:First, as already pointed out, the assumption that experts know the true
34:1113:58647:19:19:102:491:276:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:model yet report an incorrect one on purpose is too stark. What is needed
34:1114:58720:19:18:102:491:257:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:instead is a theory of how intellectuals frame their discourse (and research
34:1115:58796:18:19:102:491:239:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:strategy) in a self-serving fashion, inorder to produce theories they prefer,
34:1116:58873:19:19:102:490:220:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:in a world where there is no hidden true model but all there is instead is the
34:1117:58951:19:19:102:491:201:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:perceived model. One obvious difficulty is how one couldfigure out the effect
34:1118:59028:19:19:102:491:182:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:of the perceived model on one’s welfare if one ignores the correct model, but
34:1119:59105:19:19:102:490:163:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:a potential solution would involve importing ideas from the robust control
34:1120:59179:19:19:102:287:144:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:literature (See Hansen et al (2006)).
34:1121:59216:19:19:120:491:125:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:Second, we need a theory of how a given model comes out to be adopted
34:1122:59285:19:18:102:490:106:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:instead of an equally good model. In the work by Sargent, history depen-
34:1123:59357:18:15:116:491:88:49:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:7Regression results are virtually unchanged if the minimum year is substituted for the
34:1124:59443:15:0:102:274:73:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:average year as the dependent variable.
35:1125:59484:0:19:102:490:651:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:dence plays a key role, and his view is that the currently accepted model
35:1126:59557:19:19:102:490:632:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:holds until a natural experiment brings the economy into a zone which was
35:1127:59630:19:19:102:490:613:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:not previously part of the equilibrium path, which in turn reduces the scope
35:1128:59706:19:19:102:490:594:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:of autocoherent models and prompts the adoption of an alternative one (See
35:1129:59780:19:19:102:490:575:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:the discussion of the progressive abandonment of metallic monetary stan-
35:1130:59852:19:19:102:491:556:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:dards in Sargent (2008)). One might believe that the new model has to be
35:1131:59924:19:19:102:491:537:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:consistent with the pre-natural experiment data as well as with the new data.
35:1132:60001:19:19:102:490:518:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:In terms of the above discussion, this means that the number of autocoher-
35:1133:60075:19:19:102:491:499:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:ence restrictions should be equal to the number of moments to be matched
35:1134:60147:19:19:102:490:480:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:multiplied by the number of "regimes" over which the moments are invari-
35:1135:60219:19:18:102:491:461:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:ants. Over time, as new regimes appear, the correct model will be identified
35:1136:60295:18:19:102:491:443:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:as the set of autocoherent ones will be reduced to the correct model. Unfor-
35:1137:60371:19:19:102:491:424:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:tunately, in practice things do not happen that way, in particular because
35:1138:60445:19:19:102:490:405:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:it is impossible to distinguish a regime change due to a change in the dis-
35:1139:60520:19:19:102:490:386:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:tribution of an exogenous variable (the most favorable case being when that
35:1140:60595:19:19:102:491:367:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:distribution is known, as in the case of the "policy regimes" studied by the
35:1141:60671:19:19:102:490:348:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:literature) from a shift in the underlying parameters of the structural model,
35:1142:60749:19:19:102:490:329:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:in which case the old data must be discarded. This is why Marcet and Nicol-
35:1143:60824:19:19:102:491:310:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:ini (2003), for example, assume that if the prevailing model is at odds with
35:1144:60900:19:19:102:490:291:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:recent observations, agents switch to a "tracking" learning mode where more
35:1145:60975:19:19:102:490:272:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:weight is given to recent observations as compared to least squares learning.
35:1146:61052:19:19:102:490:253:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:If that is so, then the natural experiment need not restrict the set of au-
35:1147:61127:19:19:102:490:234:145:g_d0_f2:145:g_d0_f2:tocoherent models because people eventually forget about old data. Recent
