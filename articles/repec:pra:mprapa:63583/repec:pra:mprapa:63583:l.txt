2:13:336:18:14:114:481:559:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:From the policy mix theory to the related empirical works, the quantification of the
2:14:420:14:14:114:481:545:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:coordination of monetary and fiscal policies seems to be missing. In this paper, we propose
2:15:511:14:13:114:481:531:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:an index (PMCI) which measures the coherent nature of the policy mix rather than it
2:16:594:13:14:114:481:518:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:restrictive or expansive character.  It is defined as the average number of periods that
2:17:682:14:14:114:481:504:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:monetary and fiscal policies have been in phase in a Keynesian perspective. After calculating
2:18:775:14:13:114:481:490:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:the index for thirty (30) countries over the period 1990 to 2013, we explore the relationship
2:19:868:13:14:114:481:477:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:between the policy mix coherence and the stabilization of the activity. The econometric
2:20:955:14:14:114:481:463:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:analysis provides empirical evidence that good coordination of monetary and fiscal policies
2:21:1046:14:27:114:231:449:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:F:reduces the output volatility.

3:26:1304:0:24:89:183:730:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f14:C:1  Introduction
3:27:1319:24:15:88:505:706:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:The economic literature has stressed on the crucial role of the coordination of monetary and fiscal
3:28:1418:15:15:89:506:691:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:policies (policy mix) since the works of Tinbergen [1952] and Mundell [1962]. The recent global
3:29:1513:15:15:89:506:676:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:financial crisis has shown the limits of neoliberal ideology. As a consequence, inflation and fiscal
3:30:1613:15:15:89:506:661:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:balance are no more the chief concern of policy makers. The priority is the economic recovery and
3:31:1710:15:15:89:506:646:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:the countercyclical economic policies are mobilized with special emphasis on their coordination.
3:32:1806:15:15:89:506:631:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:Intrinsically related to the stabilization policies, the policy mix is defined in the literature as the
3:33:1909:15:15:89:506:616:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:joint orientation of monetary and fiscal policies at some point in the economic cycle. The policy
3:34:2006:15:15:89:506:601:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:mix is said to be countercyclical when there is an upswing in economic activity, its orientation is
3:35:2105:15:15:89:506:586:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:rather restrictive to prevent overheating, or in the case of economic downturn, it is accommodating
3:36:2204:15:15:89:506:571:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:to limit the recessionary impact [L’Angevin and Montagne, 2006]. Empirically, several studies
3:37:2297:15:15:89:506:556:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:have demonstrated outside the context of monetary areas, the issues and the importance of policy
3:38:2393:15:15:89:506:541:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:coordination in macroeconomic stabilization (Alesina and Tabellini [1987] Villieu et al. [1998]
3:39:2488:15:15:89:506:526:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:Beetsma and Bovenberg [2001]). In the context of monetary union where monetary policy is
3:40:2576:15:15:89:506:511:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:conducted by a common central bank, the issue of the policy mix also includes the coordination
3:41:2670:15:15:89:506:496:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:of fiscal policies of member countries (Klein and Marion [1997] Fatas and Mihov [2002] Gali and
3:42:2765:15:15:89:155:481:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:Perotti [2003]).
3:43:2781:15:14:89:506:466:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:In a comparative analysis of the policy mix in the United States and the Euro zone, L’Angevin
3:44:2874:14:15:89:506:452:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:and Montagne [2006] have developed a policy mix indicator which summarizes into a single
3:45:2962:15:15:89:506:437:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:indicator, the interactions of the decisions of the monetary and fiscal authorities on monetary
3:46:3057:15:15:89:506:422:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:and economic conditions. The indicator measures the restrictive or expansive nature of the policy
3:47:3154:15:15:89:506:407:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:mix. By construction, the indicator proposed by L’Angevin and Montagne [2006] does not take
3:48:3245:15:15:89:506:392:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:into account the coherence of the policy mix. Indeed, in the coherence perspective, the two hands
3:49:3342:15:15:89:506:377:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:of the policy mix must be oriented in the same direction. Thus, similarly to an expansive policy
3:50:3438:15:15:89:506:362:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:mix, a restrictive policy mix can be consistent according to the position of the economy in the
3:51:3533:15:15:89:152:347:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:business cycle.
3:52:3548:15:15:89:506:332:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:Despite the abundance of theoretical works related to the coordination of economic policies (EP
3:53:3643:15:15:89:506:317:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:thereafter), the quantification of the policy mix coherence is still missing. This study fills this
3:54:3742:15:15:89:506:302:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:gap. It enriches the literature by providing an index that measures the degree of the policy mix
3:55:3838:15:15:89:336:287:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:coherence rather than its expansive or restrictive nature.
3:56:3896:15:15:89:506:272:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:Evaluating the degree of coordination of monetary and fiscal policies can be useful for many
3:57:3988:15:15:89:506:257:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:reasons. On the first hand, a better coordination of EP leads to a better quality of macroeconomic
3:58:4086:15:15:89:506:242:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:stabilization (Vickers [2000]; Muscatelli and Tirelli [2005]). In monetary union, coordination
3:59:4180:15:15:89:507:227:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:of EP avoids conflicts of interest between monetary and fiscal authorities. Using game theory,
3:60:4274:15:15:89:508:212:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:Loewy [1988] and Nordhaus [1994] show that lack of coordination result in suboptimal equilibria.
3:61:4370:15:14:89:506:197:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:In this context, an index that measures the degree of EP coordination can be useful for policy
3:62:4464:14:15:89:506:183:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:makers and academic professionals. On the other hand, knowing the degree of EP coordination is
3:63:4558:15:0:89:492:168:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:a critical step in the dynamics of institutional convergence that ensure the optimality of EP.
4:64:4653:0:15:88:505:730:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:The main objective of this study is to develop the policy mix coherence index (PMCI) or the
4:65:4744:15:14:89:506:715:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:economic policies coordination index (EPCI). The proposed index measures the mean number
4:66:4832:14:15:89:506:701:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:of periods that monetary and fiscal policies have been in phase in Keynesian perspective. After
4:67:4927:15:15:89:506:686:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:the construction of the index for a sample of 30 countries over the period 1990 to 2013, the
4:68:5019:15:15:89:506:671:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:study explores the relationship between the policy mix coherence and the stabilization of the
4:69:5112:15:15:89:506:656:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:activity. The results of the econometric estimation support the idea that good coordination of EP
4:70:5209:15:15:89:506:641:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:reduces the volatility of the production. These results highlight the importance of coordination of
4:71:5308:15:15:89:508:626:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:economic policies and the need for coordination mechanisms of EP especially in monetary union.
4:72:5402:15:15:88:505:611:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the data and the different steps in
4:73:5505:15:15:89:506:596:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:the construction of the proposed index. Section 3 sets, implements the methodology and presents
4:74:5600:15:15:89:506:581:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:the main results: the calculation of the PMCI and the econometric estimation of the relationship
4:75:5696:15:39:89:505:566:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:between the coordination of EP and the stabilization of economic activity. Section 4 concludes.
4:76:5791:39:25:89:243:527:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f14:C:2  Methodology and data
4:77:5814:25:15:89:506:502:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:In this section, we describe the main steps of the construction of PMCI. Then, we present the data
4:78:5912:15:15:89:506:487:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:used and their sources. We initially identify the two regimes of the monetary policy evaluated by
4:79:6009:15:15:89:506:472:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:the monetary conditions index (MCI). Then we do the same exercise for fiscal policy with the
4:80:6101:15:28:89:476:457:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:structural fiscal balance (SFB). In the last step, we present the calculation of the PMCI.
4:81:6191:28:22:89:198:429:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:C:2.1  Monetary policy
4:82:6211:22:15:88:505:407:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:The orientation of monetary policy (MP thereafter) is captured in this paper by the Monetary
4:83:6303:15:15:89:506:392:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:Conditions Index (MCI). Indeed, from the 1990s, the monetary conditions index (MCI) is used to
4:84:6397:15:15:89:505:377:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:assess the orientation of the MP1due to the fact that in an open economy the interest rate is not
4:85:6494:15:15:89:506:362:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:the only instrument of MP. Its principle is to synthesize into a single indicator monetary variables
4:86:6594:15:14:88:506:347:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:(and financial), giving each a weight proportional to its influence on a reference variable interesting
4:87:6697:14:15:89:506:333:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:the economic policy, for example the activity or inflation [Aubert, 2003]. In the literature, the
4:88:6794:15:15:89:506:318:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:MCI is defined as the weighted sum of the difference between the logarithm of the real interest
4:89:6889:15:15:89:506:303:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:rate and its base value, and the difference between the logarithm of the real effective exchange
4:90:6985:15:23:89:418:288:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:rate (REER) and its base value. Formally the MCI is calculated as follows:
4:91:7059:23:23:114:506:265:10:g_d0_f16:10:g_d0_f7:A:MCIt=α(it−ibase) +β(et−ebase)(1)
4:92:7091:23:15:88:506:242:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:whereiis the logarithm of the real interest rate2ande, the logarithm of the real effective exchange
4:93:7190:15:15:89:506:227:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:rate. By its construction, an increase (decrease) in MCI from its baseline expresses the restrictive
4:94:7290:15:15:89:220:212:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:nature (expansive) of the MP.

5:100:7643:39:15:88:505:730:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:The calculation of the MCI requires determining the weights (αandβ) and the choice of a
5:101:7730:15:14:89:506:715:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:base year. Regarding the choice of the base year, the average values over the analysis period is
5:102:7826:14:15:89:507:701:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:conventionally retained for lack of an objective reference or equilibrium values (Ary etal.[2012]).
5:103:7925:15:15:89:506:686:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:In determining the weights, two methods are adopted in the literature. On the one hand, the
5:104:8016:15:15:88:505:671:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:weights of the exchange rate and the interest rate can be estimated by the degree of openness of
5:105:8112:15:15:89:506:656:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:the economy. This approach relies on the assumption that the exchange rate only impacts foreign
5:106:8207:15:15:89:506:641:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:trade and interest rates impact domestic demand [Dembo Toe, 2012]. The second approach that
5:107:8298:15:15:88:505:626:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:we choose in this paper is an econometric estimation. We follow the approach of central banks
5:108:8391:15:15:88:506:611:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:(Canada, France, WAEMU zone) by deducting the parametersαandβfrom the estimation of

5:115:8901:15:15:89:506:493:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:stationary, allowing us to estimate the equation by ordinary least squares (OLS). The estimated

5:126:9153:23:15:88:505:389:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:With the MCI, we determine the different regimes of the MP as follows: MP is restrictive if the

5:128:9342:15:15:89:506:359:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:the mean is justified by the fact that it is less sensitive to outliers. We build the variableSm,tas

5:136:9672:29:21:89:178:249:10:g_d0_f15:10:g_d0_f15:C:2.2  Fiscal policy
5:137:9690:21:15:88:505:228:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:The indicator generally used to describe the direction of the fiscal policy (FP thereafter) is the
5:138:9788:15:15:89:506:213:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:change in the cyclically adjusted fiscal balance (L’Angevin and Montagne [2006]). Indeed, the
5:139:9881:15:15:89:506:198:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:change in the actual public finance balance depends on the policy choices but also of economic

5:141:10074:15:14:89:506:168:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:is thus traditionally divided into two components, the structural deficit on the first hand3, which

6:145:10407:15:14:89:486:715:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:related to the position of the economy in the business cycle (Garcia and Verdelhan [2001]).
6:146:10498:14:15:89:506:701:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:Other indicators are also used in the literature, such as the primary fiscal balance. In this paper
6:147:10597:15:15:89:506:686:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:the orientation of FP is captured by the structural fiscal balance (SFB). It is calculated as the
6:148:10694:15:15:89:506:671:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:estimated residual of the equation that links the fiscal balance (FB) to the cyclical component of
6:149:10792:15:15:89:506:656:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:real GDP. The cyclical component of real GDP (output gap) is obtained using the well-known
6:150:10882:15:15:89:506:641:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:Hodrick-Prescott filter with a smoothing parameter equal to 100. We estimate the following
6:151:10972:15:23:89:129:626:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:equation:
6:152:10981:23:23:114:506:603:10:g_d0_f16:10:g_d0_f7:A:FBt=λOGt+μt(5)
6:153:10995:23:15:88:505:580:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:whereOGtrepresents the output gap andμtan error term that represents the component of the
6:154:11084:15:15:89:506:565:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:fiscal balance that is not affected by the economic cycle (SFBt=μt). However this approach of
6:155:11177:15:15:89:506:550:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:determining the structural fiscal balance (SFB) suffers as shown by Cette and Jaillet [1998] of
6:156:11272:15:15:89:506:535:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:the uncertainty on the calculation of the output gap and the non-consideration of the influence
6:157:11367:15:15:89:506:520:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:of the deficit on the activity. Therefore we estimate the equation 5 using the Two Stage Least
6:158:11461:15:15:89:506:505:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:Squares (TSLS) method to eliminate the influence of the fiscal balance (SB) on the economic

6:171:12183:14:15:89:506:308:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:generally the activity or inflation. For example, in a Keynesian perspective the MP should be
6:172:12276:15:15:89:506:293:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:expansive when the FP is also expansive. Similarly, if the activity is overheating the policy mix

9:261:16167:15:14:89:506:715:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:fiscal policies have been relatively good (PMCI greater than or equal to 0.75) in six (6) countries

9:263:16356:15:15:89:506:686:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:0.5. We summarize the following statistics in Figure 1. This is the estimated kernel density

9:267:16617:22:15:88:505:605:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:After the construction of the PMCI, we try to analyze the relationship between the policy mix
9:268:16710:15:14:89:506:590:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:coherence and stabilization of economic activity. Since the works of Tinbergen [1952] and Mundell
9:269:16807:14:15:89:506:576:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:[1962], particular importance is given to the coordination of economic policies. The IS-LM
9:270:16897:15:15:89:506:561:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:model is the theoretical framework that illustrates the impact of the monetary and fiscal policy
9:271:16993:15:15:89:506:546:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:coordination on short-term economic activity. According to the literature, if a country has low
9:272:17088:15:15:89:506:531:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:growth and inflation, the policy mix should be broadly expansive. If a country is experiencing a
9:273:17184:15:15:89:506:516:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:strong economic growth, his policy mix must become progressively more restrictive [Artus, 2014]
9:274:17279:15:15:89:506:501:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:and in this context, the policy mix coherence is crucial for better effectiveness of the stabilization
9:275:17381:15:15:89:152:486:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:of the activity.
9:276:17397:15:15:89:506:471:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:Our objective in this section is to evaluate empirically the impact of the coherence of the policy

9:282:17872:15:15:89:506:365:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:can influence the production volatility and which are not explicitly taken into account in the

9:284:18056:15:15:89:506:335:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:coefficient of variation of real GDP, it means its relative variability. This is justified by the fact
9:285:18158:15:14:89:506:320:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:that the treated sample is composed of economies with relatively different sizes. It is calculated
9:286:18256:14:21:89:133:306:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:as follows:

9:291:18465:15:15:89:505:226:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:the volatility of the real effective exchange rate (V REER), the volatility of real interest rates
9:292:18563:15:15:88:506:211:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:(V RIR) and the volatility of fiscal balance (V FB). Control variables are also transformed into
9:293:18659:15:15:89:506:196:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:coefficients of variation using the same Formula 8. The variable of interest in this analysis is the
9:294:18759:15:15:89:505:181:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:PMCI. We expect a negative sign of it coefficientγfollowing the idea that good coordination of
9:295:18853:15:15:89:506:166:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:EP reduces output fluctuations. We implicitly assume that (1) the policy mix is restrictive in
9:296:18947:15:0:89:506:151:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:case of overheating and expansive in case of activity slowdown and (2) the transmission channels

10:298:19106:39:15:89:506:730:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:of monetary and fiscal policies are operational. Before presenting the estimation results, we

10:300:19291:14:15:89:506:701:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:sample. Figure 2 suggests a negative relationship between the PMCI and the volatility of real
10:301:19384:15:320:89:435:686:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:GDP. This first result is confronted to the results of the econometric estimates.

10:310:20232:15:15:89:506:232:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:here is not to analyze the determinants of the volatility of production. It is simply an exploratory

10:312:20426:15:15:89:506:202:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:variables are not statistically significant. The results suggest that a coherent policy mix seems to

11:356:22802:15:14:89:506:168:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:economic policies tend to have low output volatility. The coefficient of real interest rate volatility

12:361:23243:39:25:89:174:662:12:g_d0_f14:12:g_d0_f14:C:4  Conclusion
12:362:23256:25:15:88:505:637:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:The policy mix, a concept originally drawn from the Keynesian theory, still have today practical
12:363:23352:15:15:89:506:622:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:applications even in monetary unions.  The coexistence of fiscal and monetary supports to
12:364:23441:15:15:89:508:607:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:economic activity raises the question of the coordination of these two policies for optimal impacts.
12:365:23541:15:15:89:506:592:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:In the extensive literature of the coordination of monetary and fiscal policies, the quantification
12:366:23640:15:15:89:506:577:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:of the policy mix coherence is still missing. The indicator proposed by L’Angevin and Montagne
12:367:23734:15:15:89:506:562:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:[2006] measures only the expansive or restrictive nature of the policy mix. In this study, we were
12:368:23832:15:15:89:508:547:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:interested to the evaluation of the degree of the policy mix coherence in a Keynesian perspective.
12:369:23930:15:15:88:505:532:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:The proposed index, denoted PMCI, is defined as the average number of periods that monetary
12:370:24021:15:15:89:506:517:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:and fiscal policies have been in phase.  The index can be used as a benchmark and at the
12:371:24109:15:15:89:506:502:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:same time guide the economic policy makers in the coordination process of their actions. In
12:372:24200:15:15:89:508:487:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:the academic domain, it can be mobilized in empirical work on economic policy coordination.
12:373:24291:15:15:88:505:472:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:After calculating the index for a sample of thirty (30) countries and using the ordinary least
12:374:24385:15:14:89:506:457:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:squares (OLS) and robust least squares (RLS) methods, the study have analyzed empirically the
12:375:24478:14:15:89:506:443:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:relationship between the policy mix coherence and the stabilization of the economic activity. The
12:376:24575:15:15:89:506:428:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:results of the different estimates suggest that in countries where the economic policies regimes
12:377:24671:15:15:89:506:413:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:have been more synchronous, production have been relatively less volatile. A coherent policy mix
12:378:24767:15:15:89:506:398:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:seems to promote economic stabilization in line with the economic stabilization theories. This
12:379:24861:15:0:89:507:383:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:B:result is an argument in favor of institutional mechanisms of the economic policies coordination.
