3:46:2138:14:13:89:508:598:144:Times:144:Times:In this essay, I first define the nature of the problem and then present a few facts about 
3:47:2229:13:14:89:522:585:144:Times:144:Times:the ongoing risk. The bulk of the essay describes how the U.S. market copes with the risk 
3:48:2318:14:14:89:509:571:144:Times:144:Times:in current policy environment. It concludes with key challenges facing researchers and 
3:49:2405:14:14:89:163:557:144:Times:144:Times:policy makers.

3:51:2419:14:13:107:234:529:144:Times:144:Times:1. Nature of the problem 
3:52:2443:13:14:89:92:516:144:Times:144:Times: 
3:53:2443:14:14:90:485:502:144:Times:144:Times:In early 1980s, economists tended to think of consumer privacy as an information 
3:54:2524:14:14:90:478:488:144:Times:144:Times:asymmetry within a focal transaction: for example, consumers want to hide their 
3:55:2604:14:14:90:522:474:144:Times:144:Times:willingness to pay just as firms want to hide their real marginal cost; and buyers with less 
3:56:2697:14:13:90:517:460:144:Times:144:Times:favorable information (say a low credit score) prefer to withhold it just as sellers want to 
3:57:2790:13:14:90:484:447:144:Times:144:Times:conceal poor product quality (Posner 1981; Stigler 1980). Information economics 
3:58:2870:14:14:90:472:433:144:Times:144:Times:suggests that both buyers and sellers have an incentive to hide or reveal private 
3:59:2952:14:14:90:502:419:144:Times:144:Times:information, and these incentives are crucial for market efficiency. In the context of a 
3:60:3041:14:14:90:492:405:144:Times:144:Times:single transaction, less privacy is not necessarily bad for economic efficiency. Data 
3:61:3127:14:13:90:505:391:144:Times:144:Times:technology that reveals consumer type could facilitate a better match between product 
3:62:3213:13:14:90:521:378:144:Times:144:Times:and consumer type; and data technology that helps buyers to assess product quality could 
3:63:3302:14:14:90:267:364:144:Times:144:Times:encourage high quality production.   
3:64:3339:14:14:90:93:350:144:Times:144:Times: 
3:65:3339:14:14:90:517:336:144:Times:144:Times:New concerns arise because technological advances, which have enabled radical decline 
3:66:3425:14:13:90:501:322:144:Times:144:Times:in the cost of collecting, storing, processing and using data in mass quantities, extend 
3:67:3513:13:14:90:483:309:144:Times:144:Times:information asymmetry far beyond a single transaction. These advances are often 
3:68:3592:14:14:90:492:295:144:Times:144:Times:summarized by the terms “big data” and “AI”. By big data, I mean large volume of 
3:69:3673:14:14:90:523:281:144:Times:144:Times:transaction-level data that could identify individual consumers by itself or in combination 
3:70:3765:14:14:90:515:267:144:Times:144:Times:with other datasets. The most popular AI algorithms take big data as an input in order to 
3:71:3855:14:13:90:501:253:144:Times:144:Times:understand, predict and influence consumer behavior. Modern AI, used by legitimate 
3:72:3938:13:14:90:496:240:144:Times:144:Times:companies, could improve management efficiency, motivate innovations, and better 
3:73:4019:14:14:90:522:226:144:Times:144:Times:match demand and supply. But AI in the wrong hands also allows the mass production of 
3:74:4105:14:14:90:197:212:144:Times:144:Times:fraud and deception.   
3:75:4128:14:14:90:93:198:144:Times:144:Times: 
3:76:4128:14:13:90:500:184:144:Times:144:Times:Since data can be stored, traded and used long after the transaction, future data use is 
3:77:4217:13:14:90:520:171:144:Times:144:Times:likely to grow with data processing technology such as AI. More importantly, future data 
3:78:4306:14:14:90:504:157:144:Times:144:Times:use is obscure to both sides of the transaction when the buyer decides whether to give 
3:79:4392:14:14:90:515:143:144:Times:144:Times:away personal data in a focal transaction. The seller may be reluctant to restrict data use 
3:80:4484:14:14:90:515:129:144:Times:144:Times:to a particular purpose, a particular data processing method or a particular time horizon, 
3:81:4575:14:13:90:500:115:144:Times:144:Times:in light of future data technology. Even if it does not plan to use any data technology 
3:82:4663:13:14:90:519:102:144:Times:144:Times:itself, it can always sell the data to those that will use it. These data markets motivate the 
3:83:4758:14:0:90:429:88:144:Times:144:Times:seller to collect as much information as consumers are willing to give. 
4:84:4830:0:14:90:93:709:144:Times:144:Times: 
4:85:4830:14:14:90:483:695:144:Times:144:Times:Sophisticated consumers may anticipate the uncertainty and hesitate to give away 
4:86:4911:14:14:90:521:681:144:Times:144:Times:personal data. However, in many situations, identity and payment information are crucial 
4:87:5000:14:13:90:512:667:144:Times:144:Times:(or made crucial) to complete the focal transaction, leaving even the most sophisticated 
4:88:5089:13:14:90:517:654:144:Times:144:Times:consumers to trade off between immediate gains from the focal transaction and potential 
4:89:5177:14:14:90:519:640:144:Times:144:Times:loss from future data use. One may argue that future data use is simply a new attribute of 
4:90:5268:14:14:90:502:626:144:Times:144:Times:the product traded in the focal transaction; as long as the attribute is clearly conveyed 
4:91:5358:14:14:90:516:612:144:Times:144:Times:between buyer and seller (say via a well-written privacy policy), sellers in a competitive 
4:92:5449:14:13:90:516:598:144:Times:144:Times:market will respect buyer preference for limited data use. Unfortunately, this attribute is 
4:93:5541:13:14:90:520:585:144:Times:144:Times:not currently well defined at the time of the focal transaction, and it can evolve over time 
4:94:5634:14:14:90:525:571:144:Times:144:Times:in ways that depend on the seller’s data policy but are completely out of the buyer’s view, 
4:95:5726:14:14:90:517:557:144:Times:144:Times:control, ability to predict or ability to value. This ongoing information asymmetry, if not 
4:96:5818:14:14:90:455:543:144:Times:144:Times:addressed, could lead to a lemon’s market (with respect to future data use).  
4:97:5896:14:13:90:93:529:144:Times:144:Times: 
4:98:5896:13:14:90:492:516:144:Times:144:Times:Incomplete information about future data use is not the only problem lurking in the 
4:99:5980:14:14:90:496:502:144:Times:144:Times:interaction between AI and consumer privacy. There are at least two other problems 
4:100:6062:14:14:90:523:488:144:Times:144:Times:related to the uncertainty about future data use and value: one is externality, and the other 
4:101:6156:14:14:90:170:474:144:Times:144:Times:is commitment.  
4:102:6171:14:13:90:93:460:144:Times:144:Times: 
4:103:6171:13:14:90:511:447:144:Times:144:Times:To be clear, future data use can be beneficial or detrimental to consumers, thus rational 
4:104:6261:14:14:90:503:433:144:Times:144:Times:consumers may prefer to share personal data to some extent (Varian 1997). However, 
4:105:6344:14:14:90:483:419:144:Times:144:Times:benefits from future data use – e.g., better consumer classification, better demand 
4:106:6428:14:14:90:507:405:144:Times:144:Times:prediction or better product design – can usually be internalized by the collector of the 
4:107:6518:14:13:90:510:391:144:Times:144:Times:information via internal data use or through the sale of data to third parties. In contrast, 
4:108:6611:13:14:90:522:378:144:Times:144:Times:damages from future misuse – e.g., identity theft, blackmail or fraud – often accrue not to 
4:109:6703:14:14:90:522:364:144:Times:144:Times:the collector but to the consumer. Because it is often hard to trace back consumer harm to 
4:110:6794:14:14:90:492:350:144:Times:144:Times:a particular data collector, these damages may not be internalized by either the data 
4:111:6880:14:14:90:516:336:144:Times:144:Times:collector, or by consumers in their choices about how to interact with the collector. This 
4:112:6971:14:13:90:487:322:144:Times:144:Times:is partly because the victim consumer may have shared the same information with 
4:113:7051:13:14:90:509:309:144:Times:144:Times:hundreds of sellers, and she has no control how each piece of information may get into 
4:114:7137:14:14:90:488:295:144:Times:144:Times:the wrong hands. The asymmetry between accruable benefits and non-accountable 
4:115:7215:14:14:90:498:281:144:Times:144:Times:damages amounts to negative externality from sellers to buyers. If there is no way to 
4:116:7301:14:14:90:505:267:144:Times:144:Times:track back to the origin, sellers have an incentive to over-collect buyer information.1 2  
4:117:7392:14:13:90:93:253:144:Times:144:Times: 
4:118:7392:13:14:90:500:240:144:Times:144:Times:This difficulty in tracing damages back to actions by the data collector, together with 
4:119:7480:14:14:90:480:226:144:Times:144:Times:uncertainty about future use and ongoing information asymmetry about collector 
4:120:7559:14:14:90:522:212:144:Times:144:Times:practices, also triggers a commitment problem. Assuming consumers care about data use, 
4:121:7646:14:14:90:493:198:144:Times:144:Times:every seller has an incentive to boast about having the most consumer-friendly data 
4:122:7730:14:13:90:478:184:144:Times:144:Times:policy in the focal transaction, but will also retain the option to renege after data 
4:123:7816:13:16:90:476:171:144:Times:144:Times:collection. There might be some room to enforce a declared data policy specific 
4:124:7896:16:7:90:237:155:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                        
4:125:7952:7:17:90:508:148:42:Times:99:Times:1 The argument of negative externality has been discussed in multiple papers, including Swire and Litan 
4:126:8056:17:11:90:93:131:99:Times:42:Times:(1998) and Odlyzko (2003). See Acquisti et al. (2016) for a more comprehensive summary.  2
4:127:8146:11:12:93:500:120:99:Times:99:Times: There could be positive externality from one player to another. For example, a data set that tracks an 
4:128:8250:12:11:90:514:108:99:Times:99:Times:infectious disease nationwide can generate enormous public health benefits for everyone. But if each data 
4:129:8356:11:11:90:515:97:99:Times:99:Times:collector accesses only part of the data and there is no way for him to benefit from the final product based 
4:130:8465:11:12:89:508:86:99:Times:99:Times:on nationwide data, he may have an incentive to under-collect and under-share the data. Here I focus on 
4:131:8569:12:0:89:437:74:99:Times:99:Times:negative externality, in order to highlight the risk of over-collecting and over-sharing.  
5:132:8661:0:14:90:524:709:144:Times:144:Times:promises, if the seller’s actual practice is revealed to the public and found to contradict its 
5:133:8757:14:14:90:510:695:144:Times:144:Times:promise. However, it is often difficult to discover the real data practice. It is even more 
5:134:8849:14:14:90:514:681:144:Times:144:Times:difficult to rectify consumer damage from a misrepresented data policy, as a court often 
5:135:8938:14:13:90:516:667:144:Times:144:Times:requires a “body on the ground” – i.e., evidence of a harmful outcome – as well as some 
5:136:9026:13:14:90:491:654:144:Times:144:Times:confidence that there is a causal link between that outcome and the data collector’s 
5:137:9111:14:14:90:146:640:144:Times:144:Times:practices.3  
5:138:9124:14:14:90:93:626:144:Times:144:Times: 
5:139:9124:14:14:90:517:612:144:Times:144:Times:Information asymmetry, externality and commitment concerns can all be exacerbated by 
5:140:9208:14:13:90:503:598:144:Times:144:Times:AI. More specifically, by potentially increasing the scope and value of consumer data 
5:141:9294:13:14:90:522:585:144:Times:144:Times:use, AI can increase the expected benefits and costs of big data. But since the benefits are

5:143:9467:14:14:90:510:557:144:Times:144:Times:encourage intrusive use of data despite higher risks to consumers. For the same reason, 
5:144:9555:14:14:90:498:543:144:Times:144:Times:new benefits enabled by AI – say cost savings or better sales – could entice a firm to 
5:145:9642:14:13:90:372:529:144:Times:144:Times:(secretly) abandon its promise in privacy or data security.

5:147:9703:14:14:90:495:502:144:Times:144:Times:In short, big data introduces three “new” problems for consumer privacy: (1) sellers 
5:148:9788:14:14:90:475:488:144:Times:144:Times:initially have more information about future data use than buyers after the focal 
5:149:9870:14:14:90:521:474:144:Times:144:Times:transaction; (2) sellers need not fully internalize potential harms to consumers because of 
5:150:9962:14:13:90:521:460:144:Times:144:Times:the inability to trace harm back to a data collector; and (3) sellers may promise consumer-
5:151:10053:13:14:90:524:447:144:Times:144:Times:friendly data policy at the time of data collection but renege afterwards, as it is difficult to 
5:152:10150:14:14:90:501:433:144:Times:144:Times:detect and penalize it ex post.4 All three encourage irresponsible data collection, data 
5:153:10239:14:14:90:193:419:144:Times:144:Times:storage and data use.

5:155:10261:14:13:90:508:391:144:Times:144:Times:All three problems could be aggravated by AI and other data technologies. Later in the 
5:156:10348:13:14:90:487:378:144:Times:144:Times:essay, I will describe a few AI-powered techniques that aim to alleviate the risk to 
5:157:10432:14:14:90:522:364:144:Times:144:Times:consumer privacy and data security. Hence, the net impact of AI on privacy needs to take 
5:158:10521:14:14:90:209:350:144:Times:144:Times:both sides into account.

5:163:10655:7:16:90:517:274:42:Times:99:Times:3 The Court’s emphasis on tangible harm is best illustrated in an ongoing battle between the Federal Trade 
5:164:10762:16:12:89:522:258:99:Times:99:Times:Commission (FTC) and LabMD. LabMD is a medical testing laboratory that collects sensitive personal and 
5:165:10865:12:11:90:504:246:99:Times:99:Times:medical information from consumers. The FTC alleged that LabMD violated the FTC Act by failing to 
5:166:10963:11:11:90:493:235:99:Times:99:Times:employ reasonable and appropriate measures to prevent unauthorized access to consumers’ personal 
5:167:11060:11:12:90:494:224:99:Times:99:Times:information. In November 2015, the Administrative Judge of the FTC dismissed the FTC complaint, 
5:168:11156:12:11:90:517:212:99:Times:99:Times:arguing that complaint counsel failed to prove that LabMD’s data security conduct caused or was likely to 
5:169:11262:11:12:90:403:201:99:Times:99:Times:cause substantial injury to consumers (https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-

5:171:11439:12:11:90:426:177:99:Times:99:Times:reversed in July 2016, by an Opinion and Final Order from the FTC commissioners

5:174:11722:12:12:90:520:143:99:Times:99:Times:temporarily stop enforcing the FTC order (while the appeals court considers the case), on the grounds   that 
5:175:11831:12:11:90:515:131:99:Times:99:Times:mere emotional harm and actions causing only a low likelihood of consumer harm may not meet the legal 
5:176:11933:11:12:90:500:120:99:Times:99:Times:definition of unfair practice, even when the exposed data is highly sensitive. The court opinion can be 
5:177:12037:12:11:90:515:108:99:Times:99:Times:found at http://f.datasrvr.com/fr1/016/73315/2016_1111.pdf. What type of consumer harm is needed for a 
5:178:12140:11:7:90:376:97:99:Times:99:Times:data security practice to be unfair and illegal remains an open question. 
5:179:12213:7:16:90:492:90:42:Times:99:Times:4 Jin and Stivers (2017) elaborate on the three information problems in more details, but they do not 
5:180:12315:16:0:90:288:74:99:Times:99:Times:associate them with AI or other data technology.  
6:181:12365:0:14:90:519:709:144:Times:144:Times:The risk associated with privacy and data security is real. Fundamentally data driven, the 
6:182:12456:14:14:90:514:695:144:Times:144:Times:risk can be directly or indirectly related to AI and other data technologies. For example, 
6:183:12547:14:14:90:512:681:144:Times:144:Times:since AI enhances the expected value of data, firms are encouraged to collect, store and 
6:184:12636:14:13:90:508:667:144:Times:144:Times:accumulate data, regardless of whether they will use AI themselves. The ever-growing 
6:185:12721:13:14:90:429:654:144:Times:144:Times:big data storehouses become a prime target to hackers and scammers.

6:187:12790:14:14:90:166:626:144:Times:144:Times:2.1 Data at risk 
6:188:12806:14:14:89:92:612:144:Times:144:Times: 
6:189:12806:14:13:89:501:598:144:Times:144:Times:According to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, 7,859 data breaches have been made 
6:190:12888:13:14:90:502:585:144:Times:144:Times:public since 2005, exposing billions of records with personal identifiable information 
6:191:12975:14:14:90:518:571:144:Times:144:Times:(PII) to potential abuse.5 A closer look at the data is even more alarming: not only do we 
6:192:13066:14:14:90:496:557:144:Times:144:Times:observe mega breaches that affect millions at once, but also the information lost in a 
6:193:13153:14:14:90:475:543:144:Times:144:Times:single breach spreads to all kinds of PII. When Target lost 40 million records in 
6:194:13235:14:13:90:485:529:144:Times:144:Times:December 2013, hackers got mostly debit and credit card numbers. But the recent 
6:195:13315:13:14:90:490:516:144:Times:144:Times:Equifax breach (September 2017) affected 145 million people, with social security 
6:196:13397:14:14:90:517:502:144:Times:144:Times:number, whole credit history, and even driver license and transaction dispute data stolen 
6:197:13487:14:14:90:462:488:144:Times:144:Times:from the same database. More concerning is the fact that data breaches occur 
6:198:13564:14:14:90:512:474:144:Times:144:Times:disproportionally to organizations that accumulate massive PII data, including retailers, 
6:199:13654:14:13:90:494:460:144:Times:144:Times:information aggregators, financial institutions, and non-profit organizations such as 
6:200:13740:13:14:90:272:447:144:Times:144:Times:governments, schools, and hospitals.  
6:201:13778:14:14:90:93:433:144:Times:144:Times: 
6:202:13778:14:14:90:492:419:144:Times:144:Times:Causes of data breaches have evolved as well. A decade ago, most data losses were 
6:203:13860:14:14:90:516:405:144:Times:144:Times:driven by human errors such as unshredded records left in the trash, lost laptops without 
6:204:13950:14:13:90:521:391:144:Times:144:Times:encrypted data or data inadvertently uploaded to the open web. Recent breaches are often 
6:205:14038:13:14:90:518:378:144:Times:144:Times:the result of targeted hacking and ransomware attack. If we view a malicious hacker as a 
6:206:14127:14:14:90:521:364:144:Times:144:Times:thief sneaking in to steal, a ransomware attacker is a kidnapper who takes control of your 
6:207:14218:14:14:90:507:350:144:Times:144:Times:data system and demands ransom immediately. For instance, the ransomware attack in 
6:208:14301:14:14:90:504:336:144:Times:144:Times:May 2017 has infected computers in 99 countries (including the U.S.), bringing down 
6:209:14385:14:13:90:433:322:144:Times:144:Times:transportation, banking, nuclear and hospital systems in many places.6

6:212:14539:14:14:90:505:281:144:Times:144:Times:monitoring forums that trade credential leaks exposed via data breaches, phishing kits 
6:213:14626:14:14:90:514:267:144:Times:144:Times:that deceive users into submitting their credentials to fake login pages, and off-the-shelf 
6:214:14718:14:14:89:523:253:144:Times:144:Times:keyloggers that harvest passwords from infected machines. They identify large number of 
6:215:14806:14:13:89:520:239:144:Times:144:Times:potential victims, including 788,000 of off-the-shelf keyloggers, 12.4 million of phishing 
6:216:14897:13:14:89:519:226:144:Times:144:Times:kits, and 1.9 billion usernames and passwords exposed via data breaches. After matching 
6:217:14985:14:14:89:515:212:144:Times:144:Times:these exposed credentials to Google’s internal database, they find that 7 to 25 percent of 
6:218:15076:14:14:89:514:198:144:Times:144:Times:exposed passwords match a victim’s Google account. More alarmingly, they observe “a 
6:219:15160:14:14:89:494:184:144:Times:144:Times:remarkable lack of external pressure on bad actors, with phishing kit playbooks and 
6:220:15244:14:13:89:449:170:144:Times:144:Times:keylogger capabilities remaining largely unchanged since the mid-2000s.”

7:228:15641:0:14:90:518:709:144:Times:144:Times:the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), identity theft affects 17.6 million (7 percent) of all 
7:229:15736:14:14:90:510:695:144:Times:144:Times:U.S. residents age 16 and older (Harrell 2014). Consistently, identity theft is one of the 
7:230:15827:14:14:90:515:681:144:Times:144:Times:biggest consumer-complaint categories – first in 2014, second in 2015 and third in 2016 
7:231:15915:14:13:89:505:667:144:Times:144:Times:(FTC 2014, 2015, 2016). In 2016, identity theft accounted for 13 percent of consumer 
7:232:16000:13:14:89:514:654:144:Times:144:Times:complaints, trailing behind debt collection (28 percent) and imposter scam (13 percent),

7:235:16148:14:14:90:471:612:144:Times:144:Times:Of course, not all identity thefts are driven by inadequate privacy protection or 
7:236:16230:14:13:90:516:598:144:Times:144:Times:insufficient data security. Scammers practiced their creative art long before big data and 
7:237:16321:13:14:90:492:585:144:Times:144:Times:AI existed. However, loss from identity theft is likely a function of data misuse. As 
7:238:16407:14:14:90:475:571:144:Times:144:Times:reported by BJS (Harrell 2014), 86 percent of identity theft victims experienced 
7:239:16488:14:14:90:515:557:144:Times:144:Times:fraudulent use of existing account information and 64 percent reported a direct financial 
7:240:16578:14:14:89:498:543:144:Times:144:Times:loss from the identity theft incident. Among those who reported direct financial loss, 
7:241:16665:14:13:89:524:529:144:Times:144:Times:victims of personal information fraud lost an average of $7,761 (with a median of $2,000) 
7:242:16755:13:14:89:501:516:144:Times:144:Times:and victims of existing bank fraud lost an average of $780 (with a median of $200).7

7:244:16841:14:14:89:516:488:144:Times:144:Times:Researchers have attempted to draw a statistical link between data misuse and consumer 
7:245:16928:14:14:89:497:474:144:Times:144:Times:harm. Romanosky, Acquisti and Telang (2011) explore differences among state data 
7:246:17009:14:14:89:503:460:144:Times:144:Times:breach notification laws and find that adoption of data breach disclosure laws reduces 
7:247:17096:14:13:89:511:446:144:Times:144:Times:identity theft caused by data breaches by an average 6.1 percent. Romanosky, Hoffman 
7:248:17181:13:14:89:520:433:144:Times:144:Times:and Telang (2014) further examine federal data breach lawsuits from 2000 to 2010. They 
7:249:17268:14:14:89:498:419:144:Times:144:Times:show that the odds of a firm being sued are 3.5 times greater when individuals suffer 
7:250:17354:14:14:89:511:405:144:Times:144:Times:financial harm but 6 times lower when the firm provides free credit monitoring. Telang 
7:251:17441:14:14:89:519:391:144:Times:144:Times:and Somanchi (2017) look at a more indirect consequence of data misuse. Using detailed 
7:252:17528:14:13:89:504:377:144:Times:144:Times:transaction data from a US bank, they find that consumers are three percentage points 
7:253:17614:13:14:89:485:364:144:Times:144:Times:more likely to leave the bank if they have experienced an unauthorized fraudulent 
7:254:17696:14:14:89:503:350:144:Times:144:Times:transaction within six months. While the unauthorized transaction could be a result of 
7:255:17783:14:14:89:512:336:144:Times:144:Times:previous data breaches, it is difficult to attribute the fraud to a particular data breach. In 
7:256:17878:14:14:89:494:322:144:Times:144:Times:other words, the bank and the consumer may both suffer from a data breach, but the 
7:257:17961:14:13:89:363:308:144:Times:144:Times:breached firm has virtually zero shares in this suffering.

7:259:18021:14:14:90:507:281:144:Times:144:Times:Tax fraud offers another peek into the harm of data misuse. Through GAO (2015), the 
7:260:18105:14:14:90:518:267:144:Times:144:Times:U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reported a point estimate of attempted identity theft 
7:261:18195:14:13:90:516:253:144:Times:144:Times:refund fraud (as of 2013). Although the IRS was able to prevent or recover $24.2 billion 
7:262:18284:13:14:90:499:240:144:Times:144:Times:in fraudulent refunds, it paid out $5.8 billion in tax refunds that were later flagged as 
7:263:18374:14:14:90:486:226:144:Times:144:Times:identity theft frauds. In May 2015, the IRS disclosed a data breach where 100,000 
7:264:18456:14:14:90:519:212:144:Times:144:Times:taxpayer accounts were compromised through its Get Transcript application. This breach 
7:265:18543:14:14:90:521:198:144:Times:144:Times:exposes sensitive information such as taxpayers' prior-year tax filings. More important, it 
7:266:18635:14:13:90:502:184:144:Times:144:Times:is compromised not because hackers broke a digital backdoor of the IRS, but because 
7:267:18719:13:14:90:521:171:144:Times:144:Times:hackers were able to clear a multi-step authentication process that required prior personal 
7:268:18811:14:14:90:505:157:144:Times:144:Times:knowledge of the taxpayer’s social security number, date of birth, tax filing status and 
7:269:18900:14:23:90:525:143:144:Times:144:Times:street address.8 In other words, hackers got in the front door of the IRS, using information 
7:270:18993:23:7:90:237:120:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:

8:276:19397:14:14:90:505:695:144:Times:144:Times:breaches or data available on the black market. This suggests that data breaches could 
8:277:19484:14:14:90:515:681:144:Times:144:Times:have a ripple effect: a small vulnerability in one database could undermine data security 
8:278:19574:14:28:90:284:667:144:Times:144:Times:in a completely unrelated organization.  
8:279:19615:28:13:90:487:639:144:Times:144:Times:In some situations, data in the wrong hands could cause damage much bigger than 
8:280:19695:13:14:90:521:626:144:Times:144:Times:fraudulent charges. For instance, the breach of AshleyMadison.com was said to be linked 
8:281:19783:14:14:90:499:612:144:Times:144:Times:to multiple suicides.9 The ransomware attack in May 2017 was reported to have shut 
8:282:19866:14:14:90:503:598:144:Times:144:Times:down work in 16 UK hospitals10, crippled medical devices11, and delayed at least one 
8:283:19951:14:14:89:493:584:144:Times:144:Times:surgery in a U.S. hospital.12 As more medical devices get connected to the Internet, 
8:284:20036:14:13:90:508:570:144:Times:144:Times:compromised data security could generate disruption in surgeries and life support. It is 
8:285:20125:13:28:90:492:557:144:Times:144:Times:not difficult to imagine similar risks in connected cars and the “i nternet of things.” 
8:286:20213:28:14:90:524:529:144:Times:144:Times:One may argue that the ongoing wave of data breaches is more driven by data availability 
8:287:20302:14:14:90:512:515:144:Times:144:Times:than by data processing technology. This could be true at the moment, but recent trends 
8:288:20390:14:13:90:519:501:144:Times:144:Times:suggest that criminals are getting sophisticated and are ready to exploit data technology.  
8:289:20482:13:14:90:93:488:144:Times:144:Times: 
8:290:20482:14:14:90:519:474:144:Times:144:Times:For instance, robocalls – the practice of using a computerized auto-dialer to deliver a pre-
8:291:20574:14:14:90:482:460:144:Times:144:Times:recorded message to many telephones at once – has become prevalent because of 
8:292:20652:14:14:90:522:446:144:Times:144:Times:relatively standard advances in information technology. But improved methods of pattern 
8:293:20740:14:13:90:508:432:144:Times:144:Times:recognition and delivery appear to have increased the efficacy, and thus prevalence, of 
8:294:20828:13:14:90:522:419:144:Times:144:Times:these calls. For example, by pretending the call is from a local number that looks familiar 
8:295:20920:14:14:90:516:405:144:Times:144:Times:to the receiver, it tricks the receiver into listening to unwanted telemarketing.  Similarly, 
8:296:21014:14:14:90:490:391:144:Times:144:Times:phishing emails have long strived to target people vulnerable to financial and other 
8:297:21099:14:14:90:507:377:144:Times:144:Times:frauds. Because the phishing attempt can be much more effective if it appears to come 
8:298:21185:14:13:90:514:363:144:Times:144:Times:from a familiar email address and contains personal information that is supposedly only 
8:299:21273:13:14:90:513:350:144:Times:144:Times:known to family and friends, effective phishing attempts have been limited by the labor 
8:300:21361:14:14:90:505:336:144:Times:144:Times:needed to customize each email. This danger can be easily magnified when scammers 
8:301:21443:14:14:90:518:322:144:Times:144:Times:mass produce PII-customized phishing emails with individualized targeting, appeals and 
8:302:21530:14:14:90:165:308:144:Times:144:Times:mass delivery.

8:305:21636:14:14:90:493:267:144:Times:144:Times:be converted into a tool for data misuse. AI is no exception. On September 6, 2017, 
8:306:21720:14:14:90:513:253:144:Times:144:Times:Facebook admitted that it received approximately $100,000 in ad revenue from roughly

9:322:22888:14:14:90:490:695:144:Times:144:Times:The ongoing investigation suggests that these Russian-backed accounts chose their 
9:323:22970:14:14:90:518:681:144:Times:144:Times:content strategically so that the algorithms embedded in the platforms – including search 
9:324:23060:14:13:90:523:667:144:Times:144:Times:rank, ad targeting and post recommendation – helped to broadcast the message to specific

9:327:23164:14:14:90:521:626:144:Times:144:Times:It is not going to be long before the same algorithms get exploited for stalking, blackmail 
9:328:23256:14:14:90:518:612:144:Times:144:Times:and other shady use. According to Vines et al. (2017), one can spend as low as $1,000 to 
9:329:23345:14:13:90:517:598:144:Times:144:Times:track someone’s location with mobile ads. This is achieved by exploiting the ad tracking 
9:330:23434:13:14:90:521:585:144:Times:144:Times:and ad targeting algorithms widely used in mobile platforms and mobile apps. We do not 
9:331:23521:14:14:90:480:571:144:Times:144:Times:know whether this trick has been used in the real world, but it sends two chilling 
9:332:23604:14:14:90:512:557:144:Times:144:Times:messages. First, personal data is not only available to giant consumer-facing companies 
9:333:23692:14:14:90:516:543:144:Times:144:Times:that can use AI for mass, individualized but impersonal, marketing but is also within the 
9:334:23782:14:13:90:521:529:144:Times:144:Times:reach of small, non-market parties who can exploit that data for personalized targeting of 
9:335:23873:13:14:90:507:516:144:Times:144:Times:the consumer. Arguably, the latter is more dangerous to a targeted individual, as small 
9:336:23961:14:14:90:508:502:144:Times:144:Times:non-market parties face less reputation constraint, they are invisible to consumers, and 
9:337:24050:14:14:90:520:488:144:Times:144:Times:they may be interested in causing more harm than simply getting a consumer to purchase 
9:338:24137:14:14:90:516:474:144:Times:144:Times:an unwanted product. Second, these bad actors may be able to take advantage of the key 
9:339:24224:14:13:90:513:460:144:Times:144:Times:algorithms that are designed to reap the benefits of AI for legitimate purposes. As these 
9:340:24314:13:14:90:441:447:144:Times:144:Times:algorithms are further developed, they could also empower data misuse.  
9:341:24386:14:14:90:93:433:144:Times:144:Times: 
9:342:24386:14:14:90:509:419:144:Times:144:Times:Even if we can keep all data tightly secured and limit AI to its intended use, there is no 
9:343:24477:14:14:90:505:405:144:Times:144:Times:guarantee that the intended use is harm free to consumers. Predictive algorithms often 
9:344:24564:14:13:90:510:391:144:Times:144:Times:assume there is a hidden truth to learn, which could be the consumer’s gender, income, 
9:345:24651:13:14:90:478:378:144:Times:144:Times:location, sexual orientation, political preference or willingness to pay. However, 
9:346:24734:14:14:90:511:364:144:Times:144:Times:sometimes the to-be-learned “truth” evolves and is subject to external influence. In that 
9:347:24824:14:14:90:512:350:144:Times:144:Times:sense, the algorithm may intend to discover the truth but end up defining the truth. This 
9:348:24913:14:14:90:499:336:144:Times:144:Times:could be harmful, as algorithm developers may use the algorithms to serve their own 
9:349:24997:14:13:90:493:322:144:Times:144:Times:interest, and their interests – say earning profits, seeking political power, or leading 
9:350:25086:13:14:90:399:309:144:Times:144:Times:cultural change – could conflict with the interest of consumers.  
9:351:25152:14:14:90:93:295:144:Times:144:Times: 
9:352:25152:14:14:90:487:281:144:Times:144:Times:The danger of misleading algorithms is already seen in the controversy about how 
9:353:25233:14:14:90:473:267:144:Times:144:Times:Russia-sponsored posts got disseminated in social medias during the 2016 U.S. 
9:354:25311:14:13:90:520:253:144:Times:144:Times:presidential election. In the Congressional hearings held on October 31 and November 1, 
9:355:25399:13:14:90:523:240:144:Times:144:Times:2017, lawmakers expressed the concern that the business model of Facebook, Twitter and 
9:356:25486:14:14:90:517:226:144:Times:144:Times:Google, which depends on advertising revenue from a large user base, may hamper their 
9:357:25572:14:14:90:495:212:144:Times:144:Times:willingness to identify or restrict misinformation from problematic users.16 Because 
9:358:25657:14:20:90:519:198:144:Times:144:Times:social media users are more likely to consume information that platform algorithms push

10:370:26530:14:14:90:93:695:144:Times:144:Times: 
10:371:26530:14:14:90:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:The same conflict of interest has sparked concerns in price discrimination. This argument 
10:372:26620:14:13:90:507:667:144:Times:144:Times:is that if AI enables a firm to predict a consumer’s willingness to pay, it could use that 
10:373:26711:13:14:90:516:654:144:Times:144:Times:information to squeeze out every penny in consumer surplus. This argument is plausible 
10:374:26798:14:14:90:513:640:144:Times:144:Times:in theory, but needs to be evaluated with at least three considerations: first, if more than 
10:375:26891:14:14:90:498:626:144:Times:144:Times:one firms can use AI to discover the same consumer willingness to pay, competition 
10:376:26974:14:14:90:520:612:144:Times:144:Times:among them will ease the concern of perfect price discrimination; second, the economics 
10:377:27062:14:13:90:521:598:144:Times:144:Times:literature has long demonstrated the ambiguous welfare effect of price discrimination. As 
10:378:27152:13:14:90:497:585:144:Times:144:Times:long as price discrimination is imperfect (i.e., firms cannot charge every consumer’s 
10:379:27238:14:14:90:498:571:144:Times:144:Times:willingness to pay), some consumers may benefit from the practice (via lower price) 
10:380:27322:14:14:90:475:557:144:Times:144:Times:while other consumers suffer. From a social planner’s point of view, whether to 
10:381:27402:14:14:90:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:encourage or punish AI-enabled price discrimination depends on the weights it assigns to 
10:382:27491:14:13:90:498:529:144:Times:144:Times:different parts of society. Third, in the long run, AI may reduce the operational costs 
10:383:27579:13:14:90:518:516:144:Times:144:Times:within the firm (e.g., via a more cost-effective inventory management system) and foster 
10:384:27668:14:14:90:515:502:144:Times:144:Times:product innovations that better fit consumer demand. These changes could be beneficial 
10:385:27755:14:14:90:263:488:144:Times:144:Times:to both the firm and its consumers.  
10:386:27792:14:14:90:93:474:144:Times:144:Times: 
10:387:27792:14:13:90:497:460:144:Times:144:Times:A somewhat opposite concern is that AI and other predictive technology are not 100 
10:388:27875:13:14:90:521:447:144:Times:144:Times:percent accurate in their intended use. It may not introduce much inefficiency or wasteful 
10:389:27966:14:14:90:511:433:144:Times:144:Times:effort if Netflix cannot precisely predict the next movie I want to watch, but it could be 
10:390:28057:14:14:90:496:419:144:Times:144:Times:much more consequential if the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) flags me as a 
10:391:28138:14:14:90:505:405:144:Times:144:Times:future terrorist based on some AI algorithm. As Solove (2013) has argued, it is almost 
10:392:28225:14:13:90:513:391:144:Times:144:Times:impossible for someone to prove that they will not be a terrorist in the future. But at the 
10:393:28317:13:14:90:509:378:144:Times:144:Times:same time, they may be barred from air travel, have personal conversation with friends 
10:394:28403:14:14:90:512:364:144:Times:144:Times:monitored, and be restricted from work, trade and leisure activities. If this AI algorithm 
10:395:28494:14:14:90:510:350:144:Times:144:Times:applies to a large population, it could do a lot of harm even if the probability of error is 
10:396:28587:14:14:90:159:336:144:Times:144:Times:close to zero.  
10:397:28603:14:13:90:93:322:144:Times:144:Times: 
10:398:28603:13:14:90:521:309:144:Times:144:Times:To summarize, there is a real risk in privacy and data security. The magnitude of the risk, 
10:399:28695:14:14:90:527:295:144:Times:144:Times:and its potential harm to consumers, will likely depend on AI and other data technologies.

10:401:28787:14:14:108:485:267:144:Times:144:Times:3. How does the U.S. market cope with the risk in privacy and data security? 
10:402:28863:14:13:108:111:253:144:Times:144:Times: 
10:403:28863:13:14:90:523:240:144:Times:144:Times:Before we jump into a regulatory conclusion, we must ask how the market copes with the 
10:404:28950:14:14:90:517:226:144:Times:144:Times:risk in privacy and data security. Unfortunately, the short answer is that we do not know 
10:405:29040:14:14:90:501:212:144:Times:144:Times:much. Below I describe what we know on the demand and supply sides, along with a 
10:406:29121:14:14:90:513:198:144:Times:144:Times:summary of existing public policies in the U.S. Admittedly, the literature cited below is 
10:407:29211:14:14:90:517:184:144:Times:144:Times:more about privacy and data security than about AI. This is not surprising, as AI has just 
10:408:29302:14:13:90:523:170:144:Times:144:Times:started to find its way into e-commerce, social media, national security and the internet of 
10:409:29395:13:14:90:517:157:144:Times:144:Times:things. However, given the ongoing risk and the potential interaction of AI and that risk, 
10:410:29485:14:23:90:313:143:144:Times:144:Times:it is important to keep in mind the big picture. 
10:411:29534:23:7:90:237:120:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                        
10:412:29590:7:16:90:503:113:42:Times:99:Times:17 Note that a predicative algorithm is not necessarily more biased than human judgment. For example, 
10:413:29692:16:11:90:501:97:99:Times:99:Times:Hoffman, Kahn and Li (2017) study job-testing technologies in 15 firms. They find that hires made by 
10:414:29793:11:12:90:515:86:99:Times:99:Times:managers against test recommendations are worse on average. This suggests that managers often overrule 
10:415:29896:12:0:90:328:74:99:Times:99:Times:test recommendations because they are biased or mistaken.

11:418:29976:14:14:90:93:681:144:Times:144:Times: 
11:419:29976:14:13:90:510:667:144:Times:144:Times:On the demand side, consumer attitude is heterogeneous, evolving, and sometimes self-
11:420:30061:13:14:90:150:654:144:Times:144:Times:conflicting.  
11:421:30075:14:14:90:93:640:144:Times:144:Times: 
11:422:30075:14:14:90:512:626:144:Times:144:Times:When surveyed, consumers often express serious concerns about privacy, although self-
11:423:30160:14:14:90:496:612:144:Times:144:Times:reported value of privacy covers a wild range (see summary in Acquisti et al. 2016). 
11:424:30245:14:13:90:515:598:144:Times:144:Times:However in real transactions, many consumers are willing to give away personal data in 
11:425:30332:13:14:90:516:585:144:Times:144:Times:exchange for a small discount, free services, or a small incentive such as a pizza (Athey, 
11:426:30423:14:14:90:518:571:144:Times:144:Times:Catalini and Tucker 2017). This conflict, which some referred to as a “privacy paradox,” 
11:427:30512:14:14:90:481:557:144:Times:144:Times:suggests that we have yet to comprehend the link between consumer attitude and 
11:428:30591:14:14:90:512:543:144:Times:144:Times:consumer behavior. Furthermore, researchers have found that privacy preference varies 
11:429:30677:14:13:90:510:529:144:Times:144:Times:by age (Goldfarb and Tucker 2012), by time (Stutzman, Gross and Acquisti 2013), and 
11:430:30761:13:14:90:517:516:144:Times:144:Times:by context (Acquisti, Brandimarte and Loewenstein 2015). Although old data are shown 
11:431:30846:14:14:90:494:502:144:Times:144:Times:to add little value to search results (Chiou and Tucker 2014), biometric data such as 
11:432:30932:14:14:90:503:488:144:Times:144:Times:fingerprint, facial profiles and genetic profiles can be much longer lasting (Miller and 
11:433:31021:14:14:90:517:474:144:Times:144:Times:Tucker 2017). Hence, consumers may have a different preference on biometric data than 
11:434:31106:14:13:90:508:460:144:Times:144:Times:on the data that gets obsolete fast. These heterogeneities make it even harder to paint a 
11:435:31196:13:14:90:464:447:144:Times:144:Times:complete picture of consumer attitude and consumer behavior about privacy.  
11:436:31272:14:14:90:93:433:144:Times:144:Times: 
11:437:31272:14:14:90:506:419:144:Times:144:Times:A similar puzzle exists for attitudes towards data security. A recent survey by the Pew 
11:438:31360:14:14:90:524:405:144:Times:144:Times:Research Center suggests that many people are concerned about the safety and security of 
11:439:31449:14:13:90:522:391:144:Times:144:Times:their personal data in light of numerous high-profile data breaches (Pew 2016). However, 
11:440:31538:13:14:90:502:378:144:Times:144:Times:according to Ablon, Heaton, Lavery and Romanosky (2016), only 11 percent stopped 
11:441:31619:14:14:90:477:364:144:Times:144:Times:dealing with the affected company and 77 percent were highly satisfied with the 
11:442:31699:14:14:90:252:350:144:Times:144:Times:company’s post-breach response. 
11:443:31730:14:14:90:93:336:144:Times:144:Times: 
11:444:31730:14:13:90:505:322:144:Times:144:Times:It is hard to tell why consumers are willing to give away data in real transactions. One 
11:445:31819:13:14:90:505:309:144:Times:144:Times:possibility is that consumers have a large or even hyperbolical discount for the future, 
11:446:31908:14:14:90:517:295:144:Times:144:Times:which motivates them to value the immediate gains from the focal transaction more than 
11:447:31995:14:14:90:510:281:144:Times:144:Times:the potential risk of data misuse in the distant future. Other behavioral factors can be at 
11:448:32087:14:14:90:475:267:144:Times:144:Times:play as well. Small incentives, small navigation costs and irrelevant but privacy-
11:449:32169:14:13:90:521:253:144:Times:144:Times:reassuring information can all persuade people to relinquish personal data, according to a 
11:450:32260:13:14:90:382:240:144:Times:144:Times:recent field experiment (Athey, Catalini and Tucker 2017).   
11:451:32321:14:14:90:93:226:144:Times:144:Times: 
11:452:32321:14:14:90:509:212:144:Times:144:Times:It is also possible that news coverage – on data breaches and privacy problems – raises 
11:453:32409:14:14:90:511:198:144:Times:144:Times:consumer concern about the overall risk, but they do not know how to evaluate the risk 
11:454:32496:14:13:90:516:184:144:Times:144:Times:specific to a transaction. Despite heavy news coverage, people may have an illusion that 
11:455:32585:13:14:90:517:171:144:Times:144:Times:hacking will not happen to them. This illusion could explain why John Kelly, the former 
11:456:32673:14:14:90:507:157:144:Times:144:Times:Department of Homeland Security head and current White House chief of staff, used a 
11:457:32757:14:14:90:304:143:144:Times:144:Times:compromised personal phone for months.18  
11:458:32799:14:14:90:93:129:144:Times:144:Times: 
11:459:32799:14:13:90:520:115:144:Times:144:Times:The third explanation is that consumers are fully aware of the risk, but given the fact that 
11:460:32892:13:16:90:522:102:144:Times:144:Times:their personal data has been shared with many firms and has likely already been breached

12:463:33124:0:14:90:515:709:144:Times:144:Times:somewhere, they believe the extra risk of sharing the data with one more organization is 
12:464:33213:14:14:90:518:695:144:Times:144:Times:small. Survey evidence seems to lend some support to this conjecture. According to Pew 
12:465:33300:14:14:90:486:681:144:Times:144:Times:(2016), few are confident that the records of their activities maintained by various 
12:466:33385:14:13:90:522:667:144:Times:144:Times:companies and organizations will remain private and secure. A vast majority (91 percent) 
12:467:33474:13:14:90:494:654:144:Times:144:Times:of adults agree that consumers have lost control of how PII is collected and used by 
12:468:33559:14:14:90:501:640:144:Times:144:Times:companies, though most think personal control is important. Moreover, 86 percent of 
12:469:33643:14:14:90:513:626:144:Times:144:Times:Internet users have taken steps to remove or mask their digital footprints, and many say 
12:470:33732:14:14:90:423:612:144:Times:144:Times:they would like to do more or are unaware of tools they could use.19

12:472:33802:13:14:90:502:585:144:Times:144:Times:Consumer anxiety may explain why identity theft protection service has become a $3 
12:473:33885:14:14:90:514:571:144:Times:144:Times:billion industry (according to IBISWorld20). However, a market review by GAO (2017) 
12:474:33969:14:14:90:524:557:144:Times:144:Times:shows that identity theft services offer some benefits but generally do not prevent identity 
12:475:34062:14:14:90:514:543:144:Times:144:Times:theft or address all of its variations. For instance, these services typically do not address 
12:476:34156:14:13:90:501:529:144:Times:144:Times:medical identity theft or identity theft refund fraud. In fact, a number of identity theft 
12:477:34247:13:14:90:504:516:144:Times:144:Times:service providers were caught making deceptive marketing claims,21 casting doubt on

12:489:34859:14:14:89:504:340:144:Times:144:Times:while 26 percent experienced one last year. Both numbers rose from 2016 (61 percent

13:512:36693:14:14:90:522:695:144:Times:144:Times:breached in the past (the global average is 56 percent). Consistently, both U.S. and global 
13:513:36785:14:14:90:501:681:144:Times:144:Times:financials rank data security at the bottom of their spending plans, citing institutional

13:521:37391:14:14:90:499:571:144:Times:144:Times:Firms’ willingness to invest in data security is partially driven by the cost they suffer 
13:522:37481:14:14:90:523:557:144:Times:144:Times:directly from data breaches. A strand of literature has studied the stock market’s response 
13:523:37573:14:14:90:520:543:144:Times:144:Times:to data breach. While results differ across studies, the general finding is that the financial 
13:524:37667:14:13:90:478:529:144:Times:144:Times:market response is small and temporary, if negative at all (Campbell et al. 2003;

13:528:38001:14:14:89:487:474:144:Times:144:Times:total cost of a data breach is $3.62 million. Ponemon (2017) further finds that data 
13:529:38086:14:13:89:512:460:144:Times:144:Times:breaches are most expensive in the U.S., with the average per capita cost of data breach 
13:530:38175:13:14:89:494:447:144:Times:144:Times:as high as $225. In contrast, Romanosky (2016) examines a sample of 12,000 cyber 
13:531:38256:14:14:89:522:433:144:Times:144:Times:events, including but not limited to data breaches. He finds that the cost of a typical cyber 
13:532:38350:14:14:89:486:419:144:Times:144:Times:incident (to the affected firm) is less than $200k, roughly 0.4 percent of the firm’s 
13:533:38436:14:14:89:225:405:144:Times:144:Times:estimated annual revenues.  
13:534:38464:14:13:89:92:391:144:Times:144:Times: 
13:535:38464:13:14:89:508:378:144:Times:144:Times:Thousands or millions, these estimates only reflect the direct cost of the cyber event to 
13:536:38553:14:14:89:517:364:144:Times:144:Times:the firm, not all the consequential harm to consumers. For example, most breached firms 
13:537:38641:14:14:89:520:350:144:Times:144:Times:offer one-year free credit monitoring service for affected consumers, but data misuse can 
13:538:38731:14:14:89:509:336:144:Times:144:Times:occur after a year. Either way, consumers have to spend time, effort and money to deal 
13:539:38818:14:13:89:521:322:144:Times:144:Times:with identity theft, reputation setback, fraud, blackmail or even unemployment as a result 
13:540:38909:13:14:89:493:309:144:Times:144:Times:of a data breach. The lawsuit between FTC and Wyndham Hotel and Resort gives a 
13:541:38988:14:14:89:507:295:144:Times:144:Times:concrete example. Wyndham was breached multiple times in 2008 and 2009, affecting 
13:542:39070:14:14:89:485:281:144:Times:144:Times:more than 619,000 consumers. Before reaching a settlement, the FTC alleged that 
13:543:39150:14:14:89:494:267:144:Times:144:Times:fraudulent charges attributable to the Wyndham breaches exceeded $10.6 million.22 
13:544:39231:14:13:90:479:253:144:Times:144:Times:Although the final settlement involves no money, this case suggests that harm to 
13:545:39312:13:14:90:518:240:144:Times:144:Times:consumers – via an increased risk of identity theft and the costs to mediate the risk – can 
13:546:39404:14:14:90:517:226:144:Times:144:Times:be much more substantial than the direct loss suffered by the breached firm. Arguably, it 
13:547:39494:14:14:90:521:212:144:Times:144:Times:is this difference that motivates firms to over-collect data or use lax data security, despite 
13:548:39589:14:14:89:226:198:144:Times:144:Times:the real risk of data breach.

15:612:44340:14:14:90:518:612:144:Times:144:Times:Dina Florêncio and Cormac Herley (2010) examined the password policy of 75 websites

15:614:44512:13:14:90:489:585:144:Times:144:Times:that should have greater incentives to protect their valuable database. Compared to 
15:615:44596:14:14:90:501:571:144:Times:144:Times:security demand, it seems that competition is more likely to drive websites to adopt a

15:618:44862:14:13:90:524:529:144:Times:144:Times:is concerning: consumer demand in privacy and data security may compete with the same 
15:619:44948:13:14:90:522:516:144:Times:144:Times:consumers’ demand for convenience, usability, and other attributes (such as lower price).

15:621:45122:14:14:90:499:488:144:Times:144:Times:accommodate the attributes that are more visible and easier to evaluate. Probably the 
15:622:45208:14:14:90:451:474:144:Times:144:Times:same reason explains why only a small fraction of firms adopt multi-factor

15:625:45345:14:14:90:512:433:144:Times:144:Times:So far, we have considered AI as an external factor that potentially increases the risk of 
15:626:45436:14:14:90:518:419:144:Times:144:Times:privacy violation and data breach. It is important to recognize that AI could also serve as 
15:627:45528:14:14:90:501:405:144:Times:144:Times:a tool to mitigate the risk. Recently, AI has demonstrated super intelligence in games

15:629:45702:13:14:90:487:378:144:Times:144:Times:what data risk would look like if the same AI power is used to grant data access to 
15:630:45786:14:14:90:510:364:144:Times:144:Times:authorized personnel, to detect data attack when (or even before) it materializes, and to 
15:631:45876:14:14:90:486:350:144:Times:144:Times:precisely predict whether a user-generated posting is authentic or fake. In fact, the 
15:632:45962:14:14:90:507:336:144:Times:144:Times:technology frontier is moving this direction, though its net benefits remain to be seen.

15:634:46051:13:14:90:517:309:144:Times:144:Times:Take differential privacy as an example. It was invented more than 10 years ago (Dwork 
15:635:46138:14:14:90:512:295:144:Times:144:Times:et al. 2006) and claimed by Apple as a key feature to protect consumer identity in some 
15:636:46226:14:14:90:519:281:144:Times:144:Times:of its data collection since 2016. The basic logic goes as follows: the data collecting firm 
15:637:46319:14:14:90:508:267:144:Times:144:Times:adds random noise to an individual user's information before uploading it to the cloud. 
15:638:46407:14:13:90:485:253:144:Times:144:Times:That way, the firm can still use the collected data for meaningful analysis without 
15:639:46491:13:14:90:513:240:144:Times:144:Times:knowing each user’s secret. The effectiveness of this technology depends on how much 
15:640:46576:14:14:90:435:226:144:Times:144:Times:noise to add, a parameter under the control of the data-collecting firm.

15:642:46651:14:14:90:505:198:144:Times:144:Times:To evaluate how Apple implements differential privacy in practice, Tang et al. (2017) 
15:643:46737:14:13:90:513:184:144:Times:144:Times:reverse-engineered Apple's MacOS and iOS operating systems. They find that the daily 
15:644:46822:13:14:90:475:171:144:Times:144:Times:privacy loss permitted by Apple’s differential privacy algorithm exceeds values 
15:645:46902:14:14:90:508:157:144:Times:144:Times:acceptable by the theoretical community (Hsu et al. 2014), and the overall privacy loss 
15:646:46990:14:14:90:513:143:144:Times:144:Times:per device may be unbounded. Apple disputes the results and argues that its differential 
15:647:47079:14:20:90:519:129:144:Times:144:Times:privacy feature is subject to user opt-in. Google is another user of differential privacy (in

16:653:47593:14:14:90:518:695:144:Times:144:Times:Erlingsson, Pihur and Kolonova (2014) – seems to be more privacy-protective than what 
16:654:47679:14:14:90:516:681:144:Times:144:Times:is claimed to be used in Apple, but still falls short of the most-acceptable range.31 These 
16:655:47771:14:13:90:487:667:144:Times:144:Times:debates cast doubt on the promise of differential privacy, especially on its real use 
16:656:47857:13:14:90:260:654:144:Times:144:Times:relative to its theoretical potential.

16:658:47897:14:14:90:498:626:144:Times:144:Times:Another promising technology is blockchain. In plain English, blockchain is an ever-

16:660:48067:14:13:90:485:598:144:Times:144:Times:Secured by cryptography, blockchain is designed to be verifiable, permanent, and 
16:661:48148:13:14:90:512:585:144:Times:144:Times:resistant to data modification.  Its successful application in bitcoin suggests that similar 
16:662:48241:14:14:90:496:571:144:Times:144:Times:technology could trace identities in data trade and data use, thus reducing the risk in 
16:663:48329:14:14:90:516:557:144:Times:144:Times:privacy and data security (Catalini and Gans 2017). Ironically, a ransomware attacker in 
16:664:48418:14:14:90:520:543:144:Times:144:Times:May 2017 demanded bitcoin instead of traditional money, probably for a similar security

16:669:48534:14:14:90:509:474:144:Times:144:Times:Any market description is incomplete without a summary of the policy background. In 
16:670:48618:14:13:90:519:460:144:Times:144:Times:the U.S., there is no overarching legislation on consumer privacy or data security. So far, 
16:671:48710:13:14:90:422:447:144:Times:144:Times:the policy landscape is a patchwork of federal and local regulations.  
16:672:48781:14:14:90:93:433:144:Times:144:Times: 
16:673:48781:14:14:90:521:419:144:Times:144:Times:Only a few federal laws are explicit on privacy protection and they all tend to be industry 
16:674:48873:14:14:90:495:405:144:Times:144:Times:specific. For example, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) controls the ways that 
16:675:48953:14:13:90:485:391:144:Times:144:Times:financial institutions deal with personal data; the Health Insurance Portability and 
16:676:49038:13:14:90:508:378:144:Times:144:Times:Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPPA) provides data privacy and security provisions for 
16:677:49123:14:14:90:502:364:144:Times:144:Times:medical records; and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) 
16:678:49205:14:14:90:486:350:144:Times:144:Times:disciplines online services directed to children under the age of 13. In accordance, 
16:679:49290:14:14:90:508:336:144:Times:144:Times:privacy is subject to federal regulation by sectors: the Department of Health & Human 
16:680:49376:14:13:90:474:322:144:Times:144:Times:Resources (DHHS) enforces HIPPA in health care, the Federal Communication 
16:681:49450:13:14:90:506:309:144:Times:144:Times:Commission (FCC) regulates telecommunication services, the federal reserve systems 
16:682:49533:14:14:90:514:295:144:Times:144:Times:monitors the financial sector, the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) focuses on 
16:683:49618:14:14:90:514:281:144:Times:144:Times:public firms and financial exchanges, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) 
16:684:49702:14:28:90:407:267:144:Times:144:Times:deals with terrorism and cybercrimes related to national security.  
16:685:49769:28:13:90:510:239:144:Times:144:Times:Two exceptions are worth mentioning. First, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) can 
16:686:49852:13:14:90:515:226:144:Times:144:Times:address privacy violations and inadequate data security as deceptive and unfair practice, 
16:687:49942:14:14:90:507:212:144:Times:144:Times:following the 1914 FTC Act. This enforcement authority covers almost every industry 
16:688:50026:14:28:90:337:198:144:Times:144:Times:and overlaps with many sector-specific regulators.  
16:689:50078:28:14:90:503:170:144:Times:144:Times:More specifically, FTC’s privacy enforcement focuses on “notice and choice”, which 
16:690:50161:14:13:90:523:156:144:Times:144:Times:emphasizes how firms’ actual data practice deviates from the privacy notice they disclose 
16:691:50251:13:14:90:480:143:144:Times:144:Times:to the public. For industries not subject to GLBA, HIPPA or COPPA, there is no 
16:692:50330:14:14:90:512:129:144:Times:144:Times:legislation that mandates privacy notice, but many firms provide it voluntarily and seek 
16:693:50419:14:29:90:496:115:144:Times:144:Times:consumer consent before purchase or consumption.  Some industries also adopt self-

17:696:50661:0:14:90:512:709:144:Times:144:Times:regulatory programs to encourage certain privacy practices.32 This background allows 
17:697:50746:14:14:90:511:695:144:Times:144:Times:the FTC to obtain privacy notice of the targeted firm and enforce it under the FTC 
17:698:50829:14:14:90:117:681:144:Times:144:Times:Act.  
17:699:50834:14:13:90:93:667:144:Times:144:Times: 
17:700:50834:13:14:90:501:654:144:Times:144:Times:The FTC has published a number of guidelines on privacy,33 but the best way to 
17:701:50913:14:14:90:495:640:144:Times:144:Times:understand its enforcement is through cases.  For example, the FTC alleged that 
17:702:50993:14:14:90:506:626:144:Times:144:Times:Practice Fusion misled consumers by first soliciting reviews for their doctors and then 
17:703:51081:14:14:90:502:612:144:Times:144:Times:publicly posting these reviews on the internet without adequate consumer notice. The 
17:704:51166:14:13:90:514:598:144:Times:144:Times:case eventually settled in June 2016.34 In another case against Vizio, FTC alleged Vizio 
17:705:51255:13:14:89:521:585:144:Times:144:Times:captured second-by-second information about video displayed on its smart TV, appended 
17:706:51341:14:14:89:514:571:144:Times:144:Times:specific demographic information to the viewing data, and sold this information to third 
17:707:51430:14:14:89:519:557:144:Times:144:Times:parties for targeted ads and other purposes. According to the complaint, VIZIO touted its 
17:708:51520:14:14:89:515:543:144:Times:144:Times:“Smart Interactivity” feature that “enables program offers and suggestions” but failed to 
17:709:51610:14:13:89:501:529:144:Times:144:Times:inform consumers that the settings also enabled the collection of consumers’ viewing 
17:710:51695:13:14:89:521:516:144:Times:144:Times:data.35 The case is joint with New Jersey Attorney General and settled for $2.2 million in 
17:711:51786:14:14:90:512:502:144:Times:144:Times:February 2017. The third case is against Turn, a digital advertising company that tracks 
17:712:51875:14:14:90:497:488:144:Times:144:Times:consumers in online browser and mobile devices, and uses that information to target 
17:713:51959:14:14:90:484:474:144:Times:144:Times:digital advertisements. The FTC alleged that Turn used unique identifiers to track 
17:714:52042:14:13:90:504:460:144:Times:144:Times:millions of Verizon consumers even after they choose to block or delete cookies from 
17:715:52127:13:14:90:497:447:144:Times:144:Times:websites, which is inconsistent with Turn’s privacy policy. Turn settled with FTC in 
17:716:52212:14:14:90:183:433:144:Times:144:Times:December 2016.36  
17:717:52230:14:14:90:93:419:144:Times:144:Times: 
17:718:52230:14:14:90:505:405:144:Times:144:Times:While privacy notice is something that consumers can access, read (whether they read 
17:719:52315:14:13:90:522:391:144:Times:144:Times:them is another question) and consent to, most data security practices are not visible until 
17:720:52408:13:14:90:481:378:144:Times:144:Times:someone exposes the data vulnerability (via data breach or white-hat discovery).  
17:721:52490:14:14:90:514:364:144:Times:144:Times:Accordingly, FTC enforcement on data security focuses on whether a firm has adequate 
17:722:52575:14:14:90:501:350:144:Times:144:Times:data security, not whether the firm has provided sufficient information to consumers. 
17:723:52661:14:14:90:510:336:144:Times:144:Times:Following this logic, the FTC has settled with Ashley Madison, Uber, Wyndham Hotel 
17:724:52744:14:13:90:497:322:144:Times:144:Times:and Resorts, Lenovo and TaxSlayer, but is engaged in litigation with LabMD and D-

17:727:52834:14:14:90:513:281:144:Times:144:Times:The second exception relates to government access to personal data. Arguably, the U.S. 
17:728:52921:14:14:90:482:267:144:Times:144:Times:Constitution, in particular the First and Fourth Amendments, has already covered 
17:729:53001:14:29:90:496:253:144:Times:144:Times:individual rights in free speech and limited government ability to access and acquire 
17:730:53087:29:7:90:237:224:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                        
17:731:53143:7:16:90:497:217:42:Times:99:Times:32 For example, Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), a non-profit organization led by advertising and 
17:732:53244:16:7:90:489:201:99:Times:99:Times:marketing trade associations, establishes and enforces privacy practices for digital advertising. 
17:733:53341:7:17:90:515:194:42:Times:99:Times:33 The most comprehensive FTC guideline is its 2012 privacy report (FTC 2012). A list of privacy-related

18:745:54228:14:14:90:277:695:144:Times:144:Times:subject to legal debate (Solove 2013).  
18:746:54267:14:14:90:93:681:144:Times:144:Times: 
18:747:54267:14:13:90:489:667:144:Times:144:Times:Beyond the Constitution, a series of federal laws – the Electronic Communications 
18:748:54349:13:14:90:511:654:144:Times:144:Times:Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA), the Stored Communications Act (1986), the Pen Register 
18:749:54432:14:14:90:519:640:144:Times:144:Times:Act (1986), and the 2001 USA Patriot Act – stipulate when and how the government can 
18:750:54517:14:14:90:508:626:144:Times:144:Times:collect and process electronic information of individuals. But many of these laws were 
18:751:54604:14:14:90:514:612:144:Times:144:Times:enacted in the wake of the Watergate scandal, long before the use of the Internet, email, 
18:752:54694:14:13:90:506:598:144:Times:144:Times:search engines, and social medias. It is  unclear how they apply to real cases. The legal 
18:753:54784:13:14:90:517:585:144:Times:144:Times:ambiguity is highlighted in three events: first, as exposed by Edward Snowden, the NSA 
18:754:54871:14:14:90:514:571:144:Times:144:Times:has secretly harvested tons of personal information for its global surveillance programs. 
18:755:54961:14:14:90:504:557:144:Times:144:Times:The exposure generates an outcry for privacy and a hot debate in the balance between 
18:756:55046:14:14:90:521:543:144:Times:144:Times:individual privacy and national security. Second, the U.S. Supreme Court has yet to hear  
18:757:55136:14:13:90:515:529:144:Times:144:Times:the Microsoft email case, regarding whether the U.S. government has the right to access 
18:758:55224:13:14:90:516:516:144:Times:144:Times:emails stored by Microsoft overseas.38 Third, Apple refused to unlock the iPhone of one 
18:759:55312:14:14:90:500:502:144:Times:144:Times:of the shooters in the 2015 San Bernardino terrorist attack. Since the FBI was able to 
18:760:55399:14:14:90:505:488:144:Times:144:Times:unlock the phone before the court hearing, it remains unknown whether Apple has the 
18:761:55483:14:14:90:258:474:144:Times:144:Times:legal obligation to help the FBI.39

18:764:55611:14:14:90:499:433:144:Times:144:Times:federal law has been passed on this topic.40 According to the National Conference of 
18:765:55696:14:14:90:509:419:144:Times:144:Times:State Legislatures, at least 17 states have also passed some law on privacy. These local 
18:766:55785:14:14:90:512:405:144:Times:144:Times:laws tend to vary greatly in content, coverage and remedy.41 From the research point of

18:774:56432:7:16:90:504:297:42:Times:99:Times:40 There have been multiple efforts towards a federal data breach notification law. In 2012, Senator Jay 
18:775:56537:16:12:89:471:281:99:Times:99:Times:Rockefeller advocated for a cybersecurity legislation that strengthens the requirement to report 
18:776:56634:12:11:89:494:269:99:Times:99:Times:cybercrimes. In January 2014, the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee (led by 
18:777:56730:11:12:89:515:258:99:Times:99:Times:Senator Rockefeller) introduced a bill to create a federal requirement for data breach notification (S. 1976 
18:778:56839:12:11:89:498:246:99:Times:99:Times:Data Security and Breach Notification Act of 2014). In his 2015 State of the Union Speech, President

18:780:57040:11:12:89:516:224:99:Times:99:Times:requirement for data breach. A related bill was later introduced by the US House of Representatives (H.R. 
18:781:57146:12:12:89:505:212:99:Times:99:Times:1770L Data Security and Breach Notification Act of 2015). All of them failed. In the wake of the mega 
18:782:57248:12:11:89:507:200:99:Times:99:Times:breaches in 2017, Congress has introduced Personal Data Notification and Protection Act of 2017 (H.R.

19:805:58884:14:14:90:515:557:144:Times:144:Times:To summarize, there are pressing issues in consumer privacy and data security, many of 
19:806:58971:14:14:90:413:543:144:Times:144:Times:which are likely to be reshaped by AI and other data technologies.  
19:807:59039:14:13:90:93:529:144:Times:144:Times: 
19:808:59039:13:14:90:501:516:144:Times:144:Times:A number of big questions arise: shall we continue to let the market evolve under the 
19:809:59125:14:14:90:505:502:144:Times:144:Times:current laws, or shall we be more aggressive in government regulation? How do firms 
19:810:59209:14:14:90:495:488:144:Times:144:Times:choose data technology and data policy if consumers demand both convenience and 
19:811:59289:14:14:90:501:474:144:Times:144:Times:privacy? How to balance AI-powered innovations against the extra risk that the same 
19:812:59373:14:13:89:511:460:144:Times:144:Times:technology brings to privacy and data security? If action is needed from policy makers, 
19:813:59461:13:14:89:521:447:144:Times:144:Times:shall we let local governments use trial and error, or shall we push for federal legislations 
19:814:59555:14:14:90:521:433:144:Times:144:Times:nationwide? Shall we wait for new legislations to address standing loopholes, or shall we 
19:815:59645:14:14:90:507:419:144:Times:144:Times:rely on the court system to clarify existing laws case by case? These questions deserve 
19:816:59733:14:14:90:513:405:144:Times:144:Times:attention from researchers in many disciplines, including economics, computer science, 
19:817:59820:14:13:90:343:391:144:Times:144:Times:information science, statistics, marketing, and law.   
19:818:59875:13:14:90:93:378:144:Times:144:Times: 
19:819:59875:14:14:90:522:364:144:Times:144:Times:In my opinion, the leading concern is that firms are not fully accountable for the risk they 
19:820:59967:14:14:90:524:350:144:Times:144:Times:bring to consumer privacy and data security.44 To restore full accountability, one needs to 
19:821:60059:14:14:90:522:336:144:Times:144:Times:overcome three obstacles, namely (1) the difficulty to observe firms’ actual action in data 
19:822:60151:14:14:90:502:322:144:Times:144:Times:collection, data storage and data use; (2) the difficulty to quantify the consequence of 
19:823:60240:14:13:90:524:308:144:Times:144:Times:data practice, especially before low-probability adverse events realize themselves; and (3) 
19:824:60332:13:14:90:510:295:144:Times:144:Times:the difficulty to draw a causal link between a firm’s data practice and its consequence.  
19:825:60421:14:14:90:93:281:144:Times:144:Times: 
19:826:60421:14:14:90:476:267:144:Times:144:Times:These difficulties exist, not only because of technical limits, but also because of 
19:827:60505:14:14:90:490:253:144:Times:144:Times:misaligned incentives. Even if blockchain can track every piece of data and AI can 
19:828:60588:14:13:90:480:239:144:Times:144:Times:predict the likelihood of every adverse event, whether to develop and adopt such 
19:829:60669:13:14:90:507:226:144:Times:144:Times:technology is up to firms. In the current setting, firms may still have incentives to hide 
19:830:60760:14:14:90:518:212:144:Times:144:Times:real data practice from the public, to obfuscate information disclosed to consumers, or to 
19:831:60850:14:14:90:325:198:144:Times:144:Times:blame other random factors for consumer harm.  
19:832:60897:14:14:90:93:184:144:Times:144:Times: 
19:833:60897:14:13:90:486:170:144:Times:144:Times:Changes must be made to instill more transparency into the progression from data 
19:834:60978:13:14:90:508:157:144:Times:144:Times:practice to harmful outcomes, and to translate outcomes (realized or probabilistic) into 
19:835:61067:14:14:90:506:143:144:Times:144:Times:incentives that directly affect firms’ choice of data practice. These changes should not 
19:836:61156:14:14:90:516:129:144:Times:144:Times:aim to slow down data technology or to break up big firms just because they are big and 
19:837:61244:14:18:90:512:115:144:Times:144:Times:on the verge of an AI breakthrough. Rather, the incentive correction should aim to help

19:840:61452:11:0:90:392:79:42:Times:99:Times:44 The same problem applies to non-profit organizations and governments.  
20:841:61528:0:14:90:520:709:144:Times:144:Times:consumer-friendly data practice stand out from lemons, which in turn fosters innovations 
20:842:61617:14:14:90:384:695:144:Times:144:Times:that respect consumer demand for privacy and data security.  
20:843:61677:14:14:90:93:681:144:Times:144:Times: 
20:844:61677:14:13:90:470:667:144:Times:144:Times:There might be multiple ways to address misaligned incentives, including new 
20:845:61754:13:14:90:492:654:144:Times:144:Times:legislation, industry self-regulation, court ruling, and consumer protection. Below I 
20:846:61840:14:14:90:312:640:144:Times:144:Times:comment on the challenges of a few of them.  
20:847:61884:14:14:90:93:626:144:Times:144:Times: 
20:848:61884:14:14:90:497:612:144:Times:144:Times:First, it is tempting to follow the steps in safety regulation. After all, the information 
20:849:61975:14:13:90:507:598:144:Times:144:Times:problems we encounter in privacy and data security – as highlighted in Section 1 – are 
20:850:62062:13:14:90:524:585:144:Times:144:Times:similar to those in food, drug, air, car or nuclear safety. In those areas, the consequence of 
20:851:62157:14:14:90:511:571:144:Times:144:Times:inadequate quality control is random and noisy, just as identity thefts and refund frauds 
20:852:62247:14:14:90:524:557:144:Times:144:Times:are. In addition, firm input and process choices – like ingredients and plant maintenance – 
20:853:62339:14:14:90:521:543:144:Times:144:Times:are often unobservable to final consumers. A common solution is direct regulation on the 
20:854:62428:14:13:90:510:529:144:Times:144:Times:firm’s action: for example, restaurants must keep food at a certain temperature; nuclear 
20:855:62517:13:14:90:471:516:144:Times:144:Times:plants must pass periodical inspections, etc. These regulations are based on the 
20:856:62598:14:14:90:520:502:144:Times:144:Times:assumption that we know what actions are good and what actions are bad. Unfortunately, 
20:857:62685:14:14:90:509:488:144:Times:144:Times:this assumption is not easy to come by in data practice. With fast evolving technology, 
20:858:62773:14:14:90:513:474:144:Times:144:Times:are we sure that politicians in Washington, DC are the best ones to judge whether multi-
20:859:62861:14:13:90:513:460:144:Times:144:Times:factor authentication is better than a 20-character password? How do we ensure that the 
20:860:62949:13:14:90:407:447:144:Times:144:Times:regulation is updated with every round of technological advance? 
20:861:63014:14:14:90:93:433:144:Times:144:Times: 
20:862:63014:14:14:90:522:419:144:Times:144:Times:The second approach relies on firm disclosure and consumer choice. “Notice and choice” 
20:863:63101:14:14:90:506:405:144:Times:144:Times:is already the backbone of FTC enforcement (in privacy), and data breach notification 
20:864:63187:14:13:90:513:391:144:Times:144:Times:laws follow a similar principle. For this approach to be effective, we assume consumers 
20:865:63275:13:14:90:503:378:144:Times:144:Times:can make the best choice for themselves as long as they have adequate information at 
20:866:63360:14:14:90:497:364:144:Times:144:Times:hand. This assumption is unlikely to hold in privacy and data security, because most 
20:867:63445:14:14:90:480:350:144:Times:144:Times:consumers do not read privacy notices (McDonald and Cranor 2008), many data-
20:868:63521:14:14:90:471:336:144:Times:144:Times:intensive firms may not have a consumer interface, and it could be difficult for 
20:869:63602:14:13:90:508:322:144:Times:144:Times:consumers to choose as they do not have the ability to evaluate different data practices 
20:870:63690:13:14:90:516:309:144:Times:144:Times:and do not know what choices are available to mitigate the potential harm. Furthermore, 
20:871:63778:14:14:90:486:295:144:Times:144:Times:firms’ data practice may change frequently in light of technological advance, thus 
20:872:63861:14:14:90:473:281:144:Times:144:Times:delivering updated notices to consumers may be infeasible and overwhelming.  
20:873:63938:14:14:90:93:267:144:Times:144:Times: 
20:874:63938:14:13:90:510:253:144:Times:144:Times:The third approach is industry self-regulation. Firms know more about data technology 
20:875:64024:13:14:90:517:240:144:Times:144:Times:and data practice, and therefore are better positioned to identify best practices. However, 
20:876:64116:14:14:90:504:226:144:Times:144:Times:can we trust firms to impose and enforce regulations on themselves? History suggests 
20:877:64201:14:14:90:510:212:144:Times:144:Times:that industry self-regulation may not occur without the threat of government regulation 
20:878:64289:14:14:90:494:198:144:Times:144:Times:(Fung et al. 2007). This suggests that efforts pushing for government action may be 
20:879:64373:14:13:90:504:184:144:Times:144:Times:complementary rather than substitutable to industry attempts to self-regulate. Another 
20:880:64460:13:14:90:513:171:144:Times:144:Times:challenge is technical: many organizations are trying to develop a rating system on data 
20:881:64549:14:14:90:502:157:144:Times:144:Times:practice, but it is challenging to find comprehensive and updated information firm by 
20:882:64635:14:14:90:479:143:144:Times:144:Times:firm. This is not surprising, given the information asymmetry between firms and 
20:883:64715:14:14:90:451:129:144:Times:144:Times:consumers. Solving this problem is crucial for any rating system to work.   
20:884:64791:14:13:90:93:115:144:Times:144:Times: 
20:885:64791:13:14:90:496:102:144:Times:144:Times:The fourth approach is defining and enforcing privacy and data use as “rights.” Law 
20:886:64874:14:0:90:503:88:144:Times:144:Times:scholars have long considered privacy as a right to be left alone, and debated whether 
21:887:64963:0:14:90:499:709:144:Times:144:Times:privacy rights and property rights should be treated separately (Warren and Brandeis 
21:888:65048:14:14:90:511:695:144:Times:144:Times:1890). As summarized in Acquisti et al. (2016), when economists consider privacy and 
21:889:65133:14:14:90:506:681:144:Times:144:Times:data use as rights, they tend to associate them with property rights. In practice, the EU 
21:890:65223:14:13:90:516:667:144:Times:144:Times:has followed the “human rights” approach, which curtails transfer and contracting rights 
21:891:65312:13:14:90:525:654:144:Times:144:Times:that are often assumed under a “property rights” approach.  The EU recognized individual 
21:892:65401:14:14:90:490:640:144:Times:144:Times:rights of data access, data processing, data rectification and data erasure in the new 
21:893:65488:14:14:90:521:626:144:Times:144:Times:legislation (GDPR, to be effective in 2018). The impact of GDPR remains to be seen, but 
21:894:65576:14:14:90:505:612:144:Times:144:Times:two challenges are worth mentioning: first, for many data-intensive products (say self-
21:895:65663:14:13:90:518:598:144:Times:144:Times:driving cars), data do not exist until the user interacts with the product, often under third-
21:896:65757:13:14:90:522:585:144:Times:144:Times:party support (say GPS service and car insurance). Should the data belong to the user, the 
21:897:65848:14:14:90:486:571:144:Times:144:Times:producer, or third parties? Second, even if property rights over data can be clearly 
21:898:65933:14:14:90:498:557:144:Times:144:Times:defined, it does not imply perfect compliance. Music piracy is a good example. Both 
21:899:66017:14:14:90:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:challenges could deter data-driven innovations, if the innovator has to obtain the rights to 
21:900:66110:14:13:90:299:529:144:Times:144:Times:use data from multiple parties beforehand.  
21:901:66154:13:14:90:93:516:144:Times:144:Times: 
21:902:66154:14:14:90:508:502:144:Times:144:Times:Apparently, no approach is challenge free. Given the enormous impact that AI and big 
21:903:66239:14:14:90:516:488:144:Times:144:Times:data may have on the economy, it is important to get the market environment right. This 
21:904:66327:14:14:90:512:474:144:Times:144:Times:environment should respect consumer demand for privacy and data security, encourage 
21:905:66411:14:13:90:420:460:144:Times:144:Times:responsible data practices and foster consumer-friendly innovations.
