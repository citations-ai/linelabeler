2:43:2856:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:F:We study the effect of decentralization on the access to some poverty-related public services in Benin.
2:44:2959:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:Compiling panel data from local governments' accounts and from surveys on 18,000 Beninese households
2:45:3059:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:performed in 2006 and 2007, our study suggests that decentralization has a positive overall effect on
2:46:3160:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:F:access to basic services. However, this effect appears to be nonmonotone following an inverted U-shaped
2:47:3263:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:F:curve. It varies according to local jurisdictions' wealth and to the nature of basic services. Decentralization
2:48:3374:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:in Benin contributes positively to the reduction of poverty by improving the average access to poverty-related
2:49:3484:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:services. However, the devil is in the details, as decentralization seems to increase inequality among
2:50:3586:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:F:local governments in terms of access. Another result relying on the success of decentralization in Benin
2:51:3690:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:F:is the prioritization of basic services, which differs among local governments according to their wealth.
2:52:3795:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:F:While the poorest jurisdictions neglect primary education, focusing more on access to drinking water,
2:53:3896:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:F:the richest ones get less attention to sewage services, since these are already provided at a sufficiently
2:54:4002:14:42:72:123:434:12:Times:12:Times:F:high level.

3:75:4453:0:33:72:201:745:209:g_d0_f1:209:g_d0_f1:C:1Introduction
3:76:4466:33:22:72:523:712:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Over the past two decades, decentralization has been implemented by many developing coun-
3:77:4555:22:22:72:522:690:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:tries, becoming a key element of the public sector reform. By bringing decision makers closer
3:78:4648:22:22:72:523:668:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:to citizens, decentralization should alleviate information asymmetries, improve accountability,
3:79:4743:22:22:72:523:646:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:and increase the efficiency of public goods provision. In developing countries, decentralization
3:80:4839:22:22:72:523:624:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:is one of the main institutional reforms on international organizations’ and donors’ agendas to
3:81:4934:22:22:72:523:602:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:enhance public governance and ultimately reduce poverty. This strategy has been in place for
3:82:5026:22:22:72:523:580:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:a number of years, but has not undergone a systematic evaluation of its impact on well-being
3:83:5118:22:22:72:522:558:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:and local governance. Therefore, now that several years have elapsed, it seems an appropriate
3:84:5211:22:21:72:523:536:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:time to examine the success of decentralization in the struggle against poverty in sub-Saharan
3:85:5305:21:22:72:104:515:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Africa.
3:86:5312:22:22:88:523:493:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:With this objective in mind, we analyze the effect of decentralization in Benin on access to
3:87:5404:22:22:71:523:471:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:some poverty-related services, namely water, sanitation, refuse and sewage disposal, and pri-
3:88:5497:22:22:71:523:449:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:mary education. Poverty is a multidimensionalissue and basic health and education services
3:89:5587:22:22:71:523:427:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:are fundamental human rights.1Decentralization is, by definition, a transfer of competencies
3:90:5679:22:22:72:523:405:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:to local governments, especially in the education and health sectors.  These services do not
3:91:5771:22:22:72:523:383:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:exactly correspond to the Samuelsonian definition of pure public good (nonexcludability and
3:92:5862:22:22:71:522:361:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:nonrivalry). However, local and central governments share the responsibility for meeting funda-
3:93:5957:22:22:71:523:339:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:mental rights in education and health. Whateverthe means of producing such basic services, or
3:94:6050:22:22:71:523:317:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:nature of relationships with providers, local decision-makers remain, in the last analysis, polit-
3:95:6148:22:22:71:522:295:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:ically responsible (World-Bank, 2004) for achieving improvements in access to drinking water,
3:96:6241:22:22:71:522:273:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:sanitation, and primary education.  In a sense, our argument rests on how decentralization
3:97:6331:22:21:71:522:251:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:facilitates access to high-quality services rather than on an investigation of how well publicly
3:98:6427:21:22:71:236:230:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:provided local goods are delivered.
3:99:6462:22:22:88:522:208:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:In regard to its democratization and decentralization processes, Benin is representative
3:100:6550:22:22:71:522:186:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of the African French-speaking countries.  An ethnically fragmented country that has been
3:101:6639:22:22:71:522:164:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:politically stable only since 2001, Benin began a transfer of competencies or authority to 77
3:102:6732:22:22:71:522:142:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f3:B:local governments, calledcommunes, in 1998. The decentralization process definitively took off
3:103:6826:22:22:72:523:120:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:with local elections in 2002. Our analysis focuses on the 2006—2007 period, which corresponds
3:104:6919:22:16:72:523:98:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:to a crucial time for democracy in Benin, with the 2006 national elections bringing Yayi Boni

4:107:7155:22:22:88:522:723:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:By analyzing panel data from 77 Beninese communes for 2006 and 2007, we aim to shed
4:108:7238:22:22:71:522:701:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:light on the following issues: (1) To what extent does decentralization, measured as the share
4:109:7332:22:22:71:522:679:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of local own-revenue in total local revenue for each commune modify access to basic public
4:110:7422:22:22:71:523:657:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:services? Is this effect monotone with the degree of decentralization? (2) Does the decentral-
4:111:7516:22:22:71:523:635:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:ization effect vary between communes according to their wealth? To answer these questions,
4:112:7606:22:22:71:523:613:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:we compiled several databases: original publicfinance panel data, which concerns all Beninese
4:113:7699:22:22:71:522:591:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:local governments, and the 2006 and 2007 Integrated Modular Survey on Household Living
4:114:7785:22:22:71:523:569:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Conditions (EMICoV), which covers a sample of18,000 Beninese households throughout the
4:115:7871:22:22:71:522:547:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:entire national territory and is representative at the commune level. We develop a consistent
4:116:7964:22:22:71:522:525:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:econometric method, taking into account the potential endogeneity in the degree of decentral-
4:117:8057:22:21:71:523:503:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:ization, heterogeneity of local governments, and inefficiency in estimating the effects of variables
4:118:8157:21:22:71:208:482:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:having little within variance.
4:119:8187:22:22:88:523:460:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Our analysis suggests that, on average, decentralization increases access to basic public ser-
4:120:8281:22:22:71:523:438:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:vices. However, this effect is not only nonmonotone, following an inverted U-shaped curve, but
4:121:8375:22:22:71:523:416:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:its impact is also heterogeneous between poor and nonpoor communes. Decentralization’s effect
4:122:8468:22:22:71:522:394:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:on access to poverty-related services is positive for sufficiently wealthy communes (measured
4:123:8561:22:22:71:522:372:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:by higher quintiles of an asset-based measure of wealth), and becomes negative for the poorest
4:124:8655:22:22:71:523:350:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:ones. Therefore, although decentralization succeeds in reducing nonmonetary poverty in Benin
4:125:8747:22:22:71:522:328:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:by improving access to some basic services, the danger of higher inequalities between communes
4:126:8841:22:22:71:111:306:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:remains.
4:127:8849:22:22:88:522:284:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:A second important result is that communes seem to prioritize basic services. Distinguishing

4:129:9036:22:22:71:523:240:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:governments’ behaviors. While the poorest jurisdictions neglect primary education, focusing
4:130:9127:22:21:71:522:218:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:more on access to drinking water, the richest ones get less attention to sewage services, since
4:131:9222:21:22:71:523:197:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:they are already provided at a sufficiently high level. If the latter is not an issue, the former
4:132:9319:22:22:71:522:175:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:casts some doubt on the efficiency of decentralization. A policy recommendation would be either
4:133:9414:22:22:71:522:153:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:to recentralize primary education, or to provide additional conditional grants dedicated to this

5:142:10083:33:21:72:523:615:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:A huge portion of economic literature focuses on decentralization in developing countries. A
5:143:10175:21:22:72:522:594:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:brief review of this literature addresses the strengths and weaknesses of decentralization to
5:144:10268:22:22:71:523:572:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:reduce poverty, or at least to increase the efficiency of public goods provision. Many benefits of
5:145:10366:22:22:71:523:550:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:decentralization are claimed in thefiscal federalism literature, most of them related to the fact
5:146:10463:22:22:71:523:528:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:that decentralization brings decisions closer to citizens, alleviating information asymmetries, and
5:147:10562:22:22:71:523:506:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:improving local governments’ accountability. Thefiscal federalism literature has largely stressed
5:148:10659:22:22:71:523:484:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:the economic efficiency of intergovernmental competition in providing local public goods. If
5:149:10751:22:22:71:523:462:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:such a normative prescription seems tofit well with developed countries, this issue remains
5:150:10842:22:22:71:522:440:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:more complex for developing countries where the “voting by feet” mechanism is not so relevant.
5:151:10936:22:22:71:523:418:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Thus, the logic of decentralization raises some intriguing issues in developing countries that we
5:152:11033:22:22:71:522:396:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:can summarize around two perspectives: (a) Why does decentralization entail a better provision
5:153:11127:22:22:71:523:374:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of local public goods? (b) What are the limits of decentralization in such countries, given their
5:154:11224:22:22:71:279:352:121:g_d0_f2:65:g_d0_f2:B:institutional and geographical constraints?3
5:155:11268:22:21:88:522:330:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:A demand-side argument in favor of decentralization is derived from the existence of infor-
5:156:11359:21:22:71:522:309:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:mation asymmetries. Indeed, the seminal idea that decentralization may improve the provision
5:157:11451:22:22:71:522:287:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of public services when local governments have an informational advantage goes back at least
5:158:11543:22:22:71:522:265:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:as far as Hayek (1948) and Oates (1972). Since local decision-makers have a better knowledge
5:159:11635:22:22:71:523:243:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of local preferences, decentralization is expected to improve the level and quality of public ser-
5:160:11733:22:22:71:523:221:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:vices. This informational gain may induce a better targeting of the poorest populations in a
5:161:11825:22:22:71:522:199:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:country, as indicated by the research conducted by Alderman (2002) in Albania, Bardhan and

5:163:11996:22:22:88:523:155:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:On the supply side, decentralization should enhance the accountability of policymakers. De-
5:164:12087:22:22:71:522:133:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:centralization allows for a better provision of public goods and a better matching between public
5:165:12184:22:16:71:522:111:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:policies and local needs. Several authors haveestablished such a link: Bird and Rodriguez (1999)

6:176:13235:22:22:72:523:613:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:For instance, Azfar and Livingston (2010)find little evidence of better provisions in govern-
6:177:13328:22:22:72:523:591:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:ment services by local governments in Uganda; For Winkler and Rounds (1996), the transfer of
6:178:13420:22:22:72:404:569:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:education competencies in Chile reduced the scores of cognitive tests.
6:179:13490:22:22:88:522:547:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Beyond improving the matching of public policies with local preferences, decentralization
6:180:13579:22:22:72:523:525:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:is also considered as an essential support of democratization. Thus, the governance of local
6:181:13671:22:21:72:523:503:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:public goods is expected to strengthen accountability under the strong assumption of well-
6:182:13761:21:22:72:522:482:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:informed voters, mobility of citizens, and participation into the political market.  Seabright
6:183:13855:22:22:72:523:460:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:(1996) considers allocations of power within local and central governments as alternative means
6:184:13950:22:22:72:523:438:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of motivating governments to act in the interests of citizens. This author shows that although
6:185:14044:22:22:72:523:416:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:centralization entails benefits from policy coordination, it also induces some costs in terms of
6:186:14140:22:22:72:523:394:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:diminishing accountability. Moreover, interjurisdictional competition may enhance accountabil-
6:187:14234:22:22:72:522:372:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:ity: local citizens encourage incumbents to increase the efficiency of public spending through a
6:188:14330:22:22:72:523:350:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:“vote with feet” (Tiebout, 1956) or a “yardstick competition” (Salmon, 1987, Besley and Case,
6:189:14423:22:22:72:523:328:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:1995).5Few studies have examined the relevance of this phenomenon in developing countries:
6:190:14513:22:22:72:523:306:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Arze, Martinez-Vasquez, and Puwanti (2008) suggest a process of yardstick competition be-
6:191:14602:22:22:72:523:284:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:tween local governments in Indonesia; Caldeira, Foucault, and Rota-Graziosi (2008) establish
6:192:14694:22:22:72:519:262:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:the existence of strategic complementarities of local public goods among Beninese communes.
6:193:14785:22:22:88:522:240:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:However, by expanding the decision space of local governments, decentralization may in-
6:194:14872:22:21:72:523:218:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:crease corruption. Bardhan and Mookherjee (2000) point out the theoretical ambiguity of the
6:195:14963:21:22:72:523:197:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:importance of relative capture at the local and national levels. Huther and Shah (1998), Baren-

6:198:15183:11:15:84:522:147:36:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:5Citizens can “vote with their feet,” that is, move to a nearby jurisdiction to obtain the public service-tax
6:199:15292:15:11:72:523:132:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:package they prefer so that local governments compete to attract people and increase their tax bases. Even in the
6:200:15405:11:11:72:523:121:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:absence of population mobility, in the context of informational asymmetries between voters and politicians, voters
6:201:15519:11:11:72:523:110:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:can use the performance cues of other governments as benchmarks for judging whether or not their representative
6:202:15630:11:11:72:523:99:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:wastes resources and, consequently, whether or not he/she deserves to remain in office. Thus, an action chosen by
6:203:15743:11:10:72:523:88:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:a politician in one jurisdiction affects the informational set of imperfectly informed voters in other jurisdictions,
6:204:15860:10:11:72:523:78:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:forcing neighboring politicians to compete in order to avoid being signaled as bad incumbents, so that they might

7:207:16084:22:22:72:523:723:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:and Svensson (2004) highlight the capture of school grants by local officials in Uganda.  At
7:208:16176:22:22:72:523:701:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:the macroeconomic level, Treisman (2000) and Fan, Lin, and Treisman (2009) conclude that
7:209:16264:22:22:72:523:679:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:federal states are more corrupt. Using data on 154 countries, Treisman (2000) also suggests
7:210:16355:22:22:72:523:657:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:that more tiers of government induce higher perceived corruption, less effective provision of
7:211:16448:22:22:72:523:635:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:public health services, and lower adult literacy,especially in developing countries. Prud’homme
7:212:16543:22:22:72:523:613:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:(1995) stresses several additional pitfalls of decentralization in developing countries, namely
7:213:16638:22:22:72:523:591:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:the increase in interjurisdictional disparities, the jeopardizing of macroeconomic stability, the
7:214:16735:22:22:72:409:569:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:ethnic bias of local elections, and low capacities of local bureaucracies.
7:215:16809:22:22:88:522:547:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Another supply-side argument against decentralization concerns the risk of diseconomies
7:216:16896:22:22:72:523:525:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of scale, or at least a loss of scale economies.  However, many of the public goods in ques-
7:217:16988:22:21:72:523:503:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:tion are community- and site-specific, and it is often possible to exclude nonresidents. Rural
7:218:17082:21:22:72:523:482:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:communities of poor countries, in particular, areoften face-to-face, and social norms sharply
7:219:17175:22:22:72:523:460:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:distinguish “outsiders” from ”insiders,” especially with respect to entitlement to community
7:220:17267:22:22:72:193:438:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:services (Bardhan, 2002).
7:221:17292:22:22:88:540:416:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, decentralization is generally viewed as a trade-offbetween autonomy and ac-countability,
7:222:17389:22:22:72:523:394:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:between costs of coordination and better provision of public goods, and be-tween preference
7:223:17480:22:22:72:523:372:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:matching and externalities.  Besley and Coate (2003) and Lockwood (2002) confirm Oates’
7:224:17567:22:22:72:523:350:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:insights by showing that the relative performance of centralized and decentralized provisions

7:227:17768:22:22:88:522:284:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:To our knowledge, no attention has been paid to the consequences of decentralization on

7:229:17950:22:22:71:523:240:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:on Benin where microdata (household survey) and macrodata (local publicfinance) have been

7:232:18146:11:15:84:523:194:36:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:7Competition among jurisdictions to attract mobile capital is a way to discipline governments, motivating

9:272:21497:22:22:72:523:591:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:government to the 77 communes. Their scope was large, ranging from elementary schooling to
9:273:21587:22:22:72:522:569:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:economic development, and including transport infrastructure, environmental programs, health

9:275:21779:22:22:72:523:525:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:competencies: exclusive local competencies, shared competencies, delegated competencies, and
9:276:21871:22:21:72:523:503:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:specific competencies. For delegated competencies, local jurisdictions act as representatives of
9:277:21967:21:22:72:523:482:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:the central state. Specific competencies concern some communes that have particular statuses

10:297:23105:22:22:72:523:723:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:transfer of competencies is obviously progressive and may take some time. For instance, the
10:298:23196:22:22:72:523:701:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:effective role of communes in water and sanitation is limited. The SONEB (Societé Nationale

10:300:23380:22:22:72:523:657:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:disposal in urban areas. A deconcentrated service, the General Direction of Water, remains
10:301:23470:22:22:72:523:635:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:essential in rural areas. Secondly, some competencies, such as primary education, require some

10:303:23623:22:22:88:523:591:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Usually, a transfer of competencies implies a transfer offinancial resources. Table 2 presents
10:304:23717:22:22:72:523:569:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Beninese communes’ revenues, distinguishing local own-revenue (tax and nontax) and other local
10:305:23811:22:22:72:523:547:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:revenue (central conditional and unconditional grants, external transfers, loans, and advances),

10:313:24556:22:22:72:523:372:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:revenue.  It corresponds to a retroceded tax, the road tax, collected by customs on exports

12:559:27306:29:22:72:523:275:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Since 1999, Benin is involved in a national strategy aimed at reducing poverty for a human sus-
12:560:27401:22:22:72:523:253:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:tainable development through its successive Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS).
12:561:27490:22:22:72:523:231:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:The main objective of the latest GPRS for the 2011—2015 period is the improvement of the
12:562:27578:22:22:72:523:209:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:living conditions of the population with specific attention to water, basic sanitation, primary
12:563:27673:22:22:72:523:187:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:education, and primary health care sectors in line with the Millennium Development Goals
12:564:27761:22:22:72:523:165:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:(MDGs). Poverty, which is a general state of deprivation, is multidimensional. It is usually
12:565:27853:22:22:72:523:143:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:associated with conditions under which people live. Poverty may be viewed in either absolute
12:566:27945:22:21:72:523:121:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:or relative terms.  Absolute poverty is a situation in which a person or group of persons is
12:567:28037:21:22:72:523:100:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:unable to satisfy the most basic and elementary requirements of human survival in terms of
12:568:28127:22:0:72:413:78:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:good nutrition, sanitation, transport, health, education, and recreation.
13:569:28202:0:22:88:522:745:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Several approaches exist which enable us to appreciate the level of poverty in Benin. Based
13:570:28293:22:22:71:522:723:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:on the monetary approach, the proportion of poor people in Benin in 2009 is estimated at 35.21
13:571:28387:22:22:71:522:701:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:percent, which means that more than one of everythree persons is living below the subsistence
13:572:28480:22:22:71:522:679:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:level (2011—2015 GPRS). An alternative approach involves looking at the nonmonetary poverty,
13:573:28572:22:22:71:523:657:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:based on a composite index including variables of household living conditions and property or
13:574:28665:22:22:71:522:635:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:assets. This measure stated that 30.84 percent of the Beninese population is poor in terms of
13:575:28758:22:22:71:522:613:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:subsistence and property in 2009. A geographical cleavage between rural and urban communes
13:576:28848:22:22:71:522:591:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:seems to matter. Indeed, urban communes located in the Littoral, Collines, and Oueme de-
13:577:28936:22:22:71:522:569:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:partments display a rate of poverty of 13, 17, and 19 percent respectively, namely two times
13:578:29028:22:22:71:523:547:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:less that the Beninese average. Afinal and crucial dimension of poverty in developing countries
13:579:29123:22:22:71:522:525:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:concerns the dynamic trend of poverty mobility. Availability of data does not allow for a robust
13:580:29219:22:21:71:523:503:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:discussion regarding the extent to which the implementation of national and local public policies
13:581:29316:21:22:71:523:482:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:has positively affected the reduction of poverty. The current situation remains ambiguous. For
13:582:29410:22:22:71:522:460:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:instance, between 2006 and 2007, income poverty fell by roughly 4 percentage points, versus
13:583:29501:22:22:71:522:438:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:2.4 points in the case of nonincome poverty. On the other hand, between 2007 and 2009, in-
13:584:29591:22:22:71:522:416:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:come poverty rose by 1.9 percentage points. This increase in income poverty between 2007 and
13:585:29683:22:22:71:523:394:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:2009 is the result of the effects of the economic andfinancial crises, which caused household
13:586:29776:22:22:72:523:372:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:consumer spending to fall. Nonincome poverty registered a substantial decline of 9 percentage
13:587:29869:22:22:72:523:350:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:points, falling from 39.6 percent in 2007 to 30.85 percent in 2009. This decline is the result of
13:588:29966:22:22:72:523:328:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:various actions taken by the government, during the period 2007–2009, to improve access to
13:589:30056:22:22:72:523:306:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:basic social services. In particular, these actions involved the construction of water points and
13:590:30153:22:22:72:523:284:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:school infrastructure. Such policies have not only been implemented at the central level, but
13:591:30246:22:22:72:523:262:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:are also the responsibility of local governments when they have legal competencies for providing
13:592:30342:22:22:72:204:240:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:local poverty-related goods.
13:593:30370:22:21:88:523:218:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:In order to tackle the methodological problems resulting from an overly broad definition
13:594:30458:21:22:72:522:197:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of poverty, we have chosen an approach that confines poverty-related issues tofive main basic
13:595:30551:22:22:72:523:175:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:services: toilet facilities, drinking water, sewage, garbage, and primary education. In this way,
13:596:30648:22:0:72:505:153:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:we are able to assess the impact of decentralization on major dimensions of poverty issues.

14:606:31387:22:21:71:522:513:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:sample of 18,000 Beninese households across the entire national territory. The sample includes

14:608:31571:22:22:71:523:470:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:lies in their representative character at the commune level, allowing us to measure aggregated

15:645:34019:37:22:88:522:321:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:These indicators are all measured at the household level except for education indicators,
15:646:34108:22:22:71:522:299:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:which require individual data (level of education of the respondent). To assess public services
15:647:34203:22:22:71:523:277:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:access we use two indicators: thefirst measures the share of households or individuals having
15:648:34296:22:22:71:523:255:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:access to the service (quantity) and the second reflects the qualitative scale of the provided
15:649:34390:22:22:71:523:233:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:service (quality). By using these two measures, we are able to capture, in a comprehensive way,
15:650:34485:22:22:71:522:211:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:how the decentralization has or has not facilitated access to poverty-related services. Reasoning
15:651:34582:22:22:71:522:189:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:only on the quantity will be fallacious, as such a measure does not reveal to what extent local
15:652:34677:22:22:71:458:167:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:citizens have benefited from an improvement of the quality of local public goods.
15:653:34758:22:22:88:522:145:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:To better understand how quantitative and qualitative variables have been computed, let us
15:654:34848:22:22:71:523:123:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:describe thefirst indicator, namely toilet facilities. The EMICoV survey provides the share of
15:655:34942:22:21:71:522:101:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:households having access to a toilet. On average, 23.7 percent of Beninese households claim to
15:656:35036:21:22:71:523:80:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:have a toilet facility (Table4). The quality of the toilet measured by the scale in Table 3 takes
15:657:35133:22:0:71:523:58:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:the value 1 for no facility to 9 for aflush toilet. Using responses from EMICoV respondents, we
16:658:35230:0:22:72:523:745:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:compute an average index at the commune level which indicates that households in only one
16:659:35319:22:22:72:523:723:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:commune (Toucountouna) have no toilet facilities, and 10 percent of the population has at least
16:660:35414:22:22:72:523:701:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:nonflagged pit latrines. As depicted on Map2, only 6 communes out of 77 converge towards the
16:661:35506:22:22:71:522:679:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:best quality of toilets with a score superior to 6, i.e., those including either nonventilated pit

16:663:35704:22:22:71:522:635:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:facilities, decentralization should produce more efficient and equitable service delivery by making
16:664:35803:22:22:71:522:613:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:better use of knowledge of local needs. The same coding procedure applies for the four other
16:665:35895:22:22:71:522:591:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:indicators. Sewage and garbage facilities are respectively depicted on Maps 3 and 4. We observe
16:666:35990:22:22:71:522:569:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:a small variance for every basic service among jurisdictions, with the exception of Segbana,
16:667:36082:22:22:71:522:547:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:which displays the highest level of sewage and garbage disposal and drinking water in the
16:668:36171:22:22:71:523:525:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:region (Alibori). One explanation for this discrepancy is linked to the development of hydraulic
16:669:36267:22:21:71:522:503:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:plans (DED and PADEAR-DANIDA projects). There exist 67 drillings and 54 modern shafts
16:670:36352:21:22:71:522:482:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:that allow the center to be served by the water supply network (SONEB). Map 5 illustrates
16:671:36441:22:22:71:522:460:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:the diversity of quality for sources of drinking water. Surprisingly, communes located on the
16:672:36534:22:22:71:527:438:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:littoral with easy access to seawater are not necessarily those which benefitfromhigh-quality

16:679:36926:29:21:72:523:213:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:The degree of decentralization, denoted by, is the share of local own-revenue in a given
16:680:37017:21:22:72:523:192:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:commune’s total revenue. This measure is used in the literature as an indicator offinancial
16:681:37108:22:22:72:523:170:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:autonomy, and also allows us to approximate theaccountability of local governments. Indeed,
16:682:37199:22:22:72:522:148:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:while central transfers are often opaque to taxpayers, who are then unable to judge the efficiency
16:683:37297:22:22:72:523:126:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of local policies, the link between local taxes and local public services provided is more immediate
16:684:37397:22:22:72:424:104:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:and may provide an incentive for local officials to improve their efficiency.
16:685:37474:22:22:88:523:82:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:We add several control variables. Time dummies, denoted by, serve as controls for omitted
16:686:37565:22:0:71:522:60:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:explanatory variables that vary over time, but remain constant between communes, and can
17:687:37655:0:22:72:523:745:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:influence the share of local governments’ own-revenue. We also control for explanatory variables
17:688:37751:22:22:71:522:723:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:that may be correlated with the degree of decentralization, and that vary across both communes
17:689:37845:22:22:71:523:701:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:and time. Since we consider the effect of local revenues’ composition, and not the impact of
17:690:37937:22:22:72:523:679:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:local public spending itself, we introduce communes’ per capita public spending, denoted by
17:691:38028:22:22:72:522:657:121:g_d0_f8:121:g_d0_f2:B:.  We then are able to see if a higher degree of decentralization affects the efficiency of
17:692:38122:22:22:72:523:635:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:local policies, given the level of local public spending. This control variable is essential because

17:695:38408:22:22:72:523:569:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:consumption, (measured by an index of about 1,200 commodities and services).14Studying

17:698:38689:22:22:71:523:503:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:public goods. We also consider urbanization rate, denoted by, since urban areas generally
17:699:38781:22:21:72:523:481:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:offer better access to basic services and have higherfiscal capacities, especially in terms of

17:703:39088:22:22:88:523:394:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Table4provides some descriptive statistics.  The main independent variable (degree of

17:705:39264:22:22:72:522:350:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Nevertheless, the mode of the distribution indicates that most communes (around 22 percent)
17:706:39355:22:22:72:523:328:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:have collected about 15 to 22 percent of own-revenue. Conversely, only eight communes located
17:707:39448:22:22:72:523:306:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:in the southern part of the country perform very well in taxes, having raised more than 85
17:708:39538:22:22:72:523:284:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:percent of own-revenue. Among control variables, the average value ofis 142,598 CFCA;

17:710:39719:22:22:71:522:240:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:in perspective, note that in strongly urbanized communes, the average per capita consumption

18:752:42582:15:7:72:393:106:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:specific approach used in the DHS is described in Rutstein and Johnson (2004).

19:755:42849:22:22:71:523:723:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:DHS index underestimates the wealth of rural areas since urban populations own many valuable
19:756:42941:22:22:71:522:701:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:assets. Following Rutstein (2008), we compute anational-level composite index from wealth
19:757:43030:22:22:71:523:679:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:indexes that have been separately constructed for urban and rural areas. We then consider the

19:759:43215:22:22:71:522:635:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:the nonpoor. The same procedure applies for thefirst quintile of wealthier communes in order

19:771:44192:22:22:88:522:350:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:This estimate may be biased by unobserved heterogeneity between communes. Our panel

19:780:45040:11:11:71:522:176:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:based measure of wealth. Filmer and Pritchett (2001) conclude that the DHS wealth index actually performed
19:781:45146:11:11:71:522:165:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:better than the traditional consumption or expenditure index in explaining differences in economic statuses. From
19:782:45259:11:11:71:523:154:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:the EMICoV, we built such a DHS measure based on a myriad of assets (cars, canoes, hi-fisystems, refrigerators,

19:786:45668:7:15:80:522:114:36:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:19Based on Monte Carlo simulations, Plümper and Troeger (2007) compare the vector decomposition model

19:788:45871:11:11:71:522:88:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:that, while the FE model does not compute coefficients for the time-invariant variables, the vector decomposition

20:808:47464:22:22:72:523:293:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:associated with easier access to basic public services (Table6). This confirms the important

20:816:48175:15:11:71:522:130:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:is split into its two parts by regressing it on the time-invariant variables of the model. The unexplained part
20:817:48286:11:11:71:522:119:82:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:corresponds to the residuals of this equation,.  Third, the estimation of the full model is implemented by

21:824:48868:22:22:72:522:679:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Tables8to11, we highlight the fact that a higher degree of decentralization is consistently
21:825:48959:22:22:72:523:657:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:associated with improved access to water sources and sanitation systems.  Table8indicates
21:826:49048:22:22:72:523:635:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:that the coefficient associated with the degree of decentralization is significantly different from

21:829:49339:22:22:72:523:569:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:other words, the standard deviation of the degreeof decentralization (23.5 percent) implies an

21:831:49525:22:22:72:523:525:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:to the quality of basic services, for instance, wefind, that once controlled for endogeneity bias,
21:832:49623:22:21:72:523:503:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:such services undergo a 10 percent point increasein the share of own-revenue, entailing an extra

21:834:49809:22:22:72:523:460:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:effect of decentralization on access to refuse disposal facilities is less robust (Tables12and13),
21:835:49907:22:22:72:523:438:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:decentralization is not found to have a significant average effect on access to sewage disposal

21:837:50068:22:22:88:523:394:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:In Table17, we consider the nonmonotone effect of the degree of decentralization by intro-

21:846:50915:22:21:72:522:196:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:and a lower value for sewage disposal facilities(49 percent) and primary school enrollment
21:847:51005:21:22:72:523:175:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:(52 percent, columns4and5). We observe that the effect of decentralization is monotone for
21:848:51095:22:17:71:442:153:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:drinking water access since the optimal level is above 1 (exactly 103 percent).
21:849:51174:17:15:80:523:136:36:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:22As in most empirical studies, political considerationsoutweigh those of equity: wealthier, smaller, or ethni-

21:851:51381:7:15:80:523:114:36:g_d0_f2:82:g_d0_f2:F:23We use the dummy variable indicating whether a commune has the same dominant ethnic affiliation as the

22:854:51619:29:22:72:523:716:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:We now consider the heterogeneous effects of decentralization across communes according to
22:855:51709:22:22:71:523:694:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:their wealth (equation 3). Table18reports that this effect is generally lower for 20 percent
22:856:51801:22:22:71:522:672:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of the poorest communes. While toilet, garbage, and drinking water facilities are increasing
22:857:51893:22:22:71:522:650:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:in quality with decentralization, there is no impact on average on sewage and primary school
22:858:51985:22:22:71:523:628:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:enrollment. For the latter, it actually has a positive effect on wealthier communes and a negative
22:859:52083:22:22:71:522:606:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:one on the poorest communes.24As a robustness check, we interact a continuous variable, the
22:860:52174:22:22:71:523:584:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:DHS wealth index scores(), with the degree of decentralization (see Table19). Estimated
22:861:52264:22:22:72:523:562:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:results confirm that the positive effect of decentralization is contingent on a minimum wealth
22:862:52358:22:22:72:523:540:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:in communes. Only the effect of decentralization on access to drinking water does not seem
22:863:52448:22:22:71:523:518:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:to depend on wealth. The coefficient associated with the degree of decentralization measures
22:864:52540:22:22:71:522:496:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:the impact of decentralization in the absence of any wealth. Its negative sign indicates that a
22:865:52635:22:21:71:369:474:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:commune with zero wealth would suffer from decentralization.
22:866:52695:21:22:88:522:453:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, we highlight the point that communes may prioritize basic services despite a uni-
22:867:52785:22:22:71:522:431:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:form decentralization process. Such a hierarchy results from their autonomy, and should also
22:868:52877:22:22:71:522:409:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:be considered by the central government and donors in the struggle against poverty. The ab-
22:869:52968:22:22:71:523:387:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:sence of a normalized scale for every basic service prevents to conclude immediately on such
22:870:53060:22:22:71:523:365:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:a prioritization. However, through Tables18and19,wepinpointsomesignificant differences
22:871:53146:22:22:71:522:343:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:among local governments’ behaviors in relation to their wealth. The poorest communes are
22:872:53234:22:22:71:522:321:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:characterized by the negative impact of decentralization on access to primary education. This
22:873:53327:22:22:71:522:299:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:suggests that these governments pay less attention to education than they do to both drinking
22:874:53420:22:22:71:523:277:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:water access and toilet facilities (Table18). Table20focuses on the top 20 percent wealthier
22:875:53512:22:22:71:523:255:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:communes. For these communes the effect of decentralization on sewage access is negative and
22:876:53604:22:22:71:522:233:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:significant. In accordance with the reading of the 77 detailed communes’ monographs,25we
22:877:53692:22:22:72:523:211:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:may deduce that the richest local governments, having already reached a certain level of quality
22:878:53788:22:21:72:459:189:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:in sanitation, choose to redirect theirfinancial resources to other public facilities.

23:895:54791:32:22:72:523:472:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:Benin is a young democracy that has experienced a decentralization process since the end of
23:896:54882:22:22:72:523:450:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:the 1990s. The main objective of this institutional reform was to improve public policy gov-
23:897:54974:22:22:71:523:428:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:ernance and reduce poverty.  Our analysis focuses on the average and distributional effects
23:898:55065:22:22:72:523:406:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:of decentralization on access to poverty-related services. An original compilation of datasets
23:899:55159:22:22:72:523:384:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:concerning the well-being of households and local publicfinance allows us to study the ultimate
23:900:55254:22:22:72:523:362:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:effects of decentralization on Beninese population. This study suggests that decentralization
23:901:55347:22:22:72:523:340:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:has an unambiguous positive overall effect on access to drinking water and sanitation systems.
23:902:55441:22:22:88:522:318:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:Beyond this average pattern, however, decentralization yields some distributional out-comes:
23:903:55533:22:22:72:523:296:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:its impact is nonlinear and heterogeneous. First, the effect of decentralization on access to basic
23:904:55632:22:21:72:523:274:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:services follows an inverted U-shaped curve with an optimal degree of decentralization (at 67
23:905:55725:21:22:72:522:253:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:percent on average), showing that a minimum level of central transfers is still beneficial. Second,
23:906:55824:22:22:72:523:231:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:decentralization affects service access differently according to the communes’ individual wealth,
23:907:55921:22:22:72:522:209:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:having a positive effect on any nonmonetary poverty indicators, and a negative effect on the
23:908:56013:22:22:71:522:187:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:poorest communes. These results are consistent with those of Galiani, Gertler, and Schargrodsky
23:909:56108:22:22:71:522:165:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:(2008), who conclude that decentralization improves public services only in wealthier areas
23:910:56199:22:22:71:522:143:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:that have the ability to voice their preferences.  Hence, if decentralization is a valid policy
23:911:56294:22:22:71:522:121:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:for improving overall access to basic services, it is essential the central State to maintain a
23:912:56389:22:22:71:522:99:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:minimum level of central transfers, in particular for the poorest communes, to avoid an increase
23:913:56485:22:0:71:228:77:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:in interjurisdictional inequalities.
24:914:56523:0:22:88:522:745:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:A:The decentralization process in Benin was successful in reducing poverty by improving ac-
24:915:56612:22:22:71:522:723:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:cess to some basic services. But this success remains threatened by an increase in inequalities
24:916:56707:22:22:71:522:701:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:between communes. Decentralization gives control over decisions and resources to local govern-
24:917:56801:22:22:71:522:679:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:ments, whose aim is to target the poorest households better. In so doing, the central government
24:918:56897:22:22:71:522:657:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:treats the poor and local democratic institutions as assets and partners in the development
24:919:56988:22:22:71:522:635:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:process. Our results suggest that the patterns of decentralization in Benin describe a better
24:920:57081:22:22:71:523:613:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:access to primary services, but raise some issues about the design of transfers in bothfinancial
24:921:57177:22:22:71:522:591:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:resources and competences. Indeed, certain basic services, mostly in education, have not been
24:922:57270:22:22:71:523:569:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:delivered to the expected degree. Controlling for different geographical and socioeconomic vari-
24:923:57366:22:22:71:522:547:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:ables, poor communes do not succeed in improving primary education. A potential explanation
24:924:57457:22:22:71:522:525:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:rests on the idea that these local governments allocate available resources for other basic services
24:925:57557:22:21:71:522:503:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:rather than education, which are considered more urgent, such as drinking water access and, to
24:926:57651:21:22:71:522:482:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:a lesser extent, toilet facilities. If the promotion of primary education is a priority national goal,
24:927:57753:22:22:71:522:460:121:g_d0_f2:121:g_d0_f2:B:then a re-centralization of this competence may be necessary to internalize inter-jurisdictions’
