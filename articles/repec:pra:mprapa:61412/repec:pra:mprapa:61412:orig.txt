3:58:1380:27:28:89:498:571:144:Times:144:Times:This article examines employee agency in psychological contracts by exploring how 
3:59:1462:28:28:89:484:543:144:Times:144:Times:young scientists proactively shape their careers in response to unmet expectations 
3:60:1544:28:27:89:515:515:144:Times:144:Times:induced by academic entrepreneurialism.  It uses the lens of social exchange to examine 
3:61:1632:27:28:89:506:488:144:Times:144:Times:their relationships with the professors engaged in two types of activities: collaborative 
3:62:1722:28:27:89:495:460:144:Times:144:Times:research characterized by diffuse/reciprocal exchange, and commercial ventures, by 
3:63:1805:27:28:89:514:433:144:Times:144:Times:restricted/negotiated exchange.  These two categories show how career agency varies in 
3:64:1892:28:28:89:504:405:144:Times:144:Times:orientation, form and behavioural outcome depending on the relational context within 
3:65:1977:28:27:89:499:377:144:Times:144:Times:which their psychological contracts evolve. Those involved in collaborative research 
3:66:2062:27:28:89:489:350:144:Times:144:Times:experienced a relational psychological contract and responded to unfulfilled career 
3:67:2145:28:27:89:499:322:144:Times:144:Times:promises by ‘extended investment’ in their current jobs. They use ‘proxy agency’ by 
3:68:2229:27:28:89:509:295:144:Times:144:Times:enlisting the support of their professors. However, some become ‘trapped’ in perennial 
3:69:2316:28:28:89:488:267:144:Times:144:Times:temporary employment and are ‘content to be sad’.  By contrast, those involved in 
3:70:2398:28:27:89:498:239:144:Times:144:Times:research commercialization experienced a transactional contract and assert ‘personal 
3:71:2483:27:28:89:501:212:144:Times:144:Times:agency’ by crafting their own entrepreneurial careers. They are ‘runaways’ who seek 
3:72:2567:28:27:89:521:184:144:Times:144:Times:autonomy. The evidence is based on interviews with 24 doctoral/postdoctoral researchers 
3:73:2654:27:28:89:511:157:144:Times:144:Times:and 16 professors from three leading UK universities. The study extends psychological 
3:74:2740:28:28:89:476:129:144:Times:144:Times:contract theory by incorporating career agency and sheds new light on changing 
3:75:2819:28:0:89:178:101:144:Times:144:Times:academic careers.

4:82:2960:27:28:89:157:543:144:Times:144:Times:Introduction 
4:83:2973:28:27:89:494:515:144:Times:144:Times:In a period of rapid organizational change, career expectations are often unfulfilled. 
4:84:3060:27:28:89:486:488:144:Times:144:Times:Psychological contract theory has much to say about employee reactions to unmet 
4:85:3140:28:27:89:518:460:144:Times:144:Times:expectations  or psychological contract breach (Morrison and Robinson, 1997; Robinson 
4:86:3226:27:28:89:520:433:144:Times:144:Times:and Rousseau, 1994), however, most research has focused on the withdrawal of goodwill 
4:87:3312:28:28:89:484:405:144:Times:144:Times:and disengagement (Zhao et al., 2007). The image of an employee depicted in the 
4:88:3391:28:27:89:523:377:144:Times:144:Times:literature is one of passivity and organizational dependency, with limited scope for choice 
4:89:3483:27:28:89:513:350:144:Times:144:Times:or career agency. Whereas this pattern may be associated with jobs that give employees 
4:90:3569:28:27:89:509:322:144:Times:144:Times:relatively little autonomy, the same cannot be said for those in professional knowledge 
4:91:3657:27:28:89:493:295:144:Times:144:Times:work who often enjoy a high degree of work autonomy and dispose of considerable 
4:92:3737:28:28:89:518:267:144:Times:144:Times:resources for more proactive responses. Employee agency has been widely researched in 
4:93:3823:28:27:89:464:239:144:Times:144:Times:career studies (Tams and Arthur, 2010) but largely overlooked in mainstream 
4:94:3899:27:28:89:237:212:144:Times:144:Times:psychological contract theory. 
4:95:3929:28:27:109:473:184:144:Times:144:Times:This article seeks to contribute to our understanding of employee agency in 
4:96:4005:27:28:89:509:157:144:Times:144:Times:psychological contracts and its manifestation in career adaptive behaviours. It explores 
4:97:4094:28:28:89:519:129:144:Times:144:Times:how young scientists have sought to craft their careers in response to unmet expectations 
4:98:4183:28:0:89:515:101:144:Times:144:Times:caused by the transformation of academic careers. Academics are archetypal knowledge 
5:99:4269:0:28:89:507:709:144:Times:144:Times:workers operating in a sector where pressures for greater organizational flexibility and 
5:100:4358:28:27:89:507:681:144:Times:144:Times:growth of contingent work have profound implications for early career progression. In 
5:101:4444:27:28:89:486:654:144:Times:144:Times:recent years, early career researchers have been squeezed by increased supply and 
5:102:4526:28:28:89:517:626:144:Times:144:Times:declining job opportunities ( Harney et al., 2014; Dany and Mangematin, 2004). This has 
5:103:4614:28:27:89:478:598:144:Times:144:Times:been exacerbated by the rise of the entrepreneurial university  which encourages 
5:104:4694:27:28:89:479:571:144:Times:144:Times:industrial engagement (Etzkowitz, 2003) and uses large numbers of doctoral and 
5:105:4773:28:28:89:497:543:144:Times:144:Times:postdoctoral researchers in temporary positions  to support their professors’ external 
5:106:4860:28:27:89:511:515:144:Times:144:Times:funding and commercial activities ( Lam, 2007; Slaughter et al., 2002; Thune, 2010). In 
5:107:4948:27:28:89:507:488:144:Times:144:Times:the past, the majority of those who progressed to postdoctoral research could expect to 
5:108:5036:28:27:89:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:obtain permanent posts after a few temporary contracts. However, the shortage of tenured 
5:109:5125:27:28:89:508:433:144:Times:144:Times:posts due to  ‘steady state science’ ( Ziman, 1994) has made it increasingly difficult for 
5:110:5216:28:28:89:503:405:144:Times:144:Times:professors to reward the cooperative efforts of young scientists by offering them long-
5:111:5303:28:27:89:492:377:144:Times:144:Times:term academic posts. These trends are likely to affect profoundly the psychological 
5:112:5387:27:28:89:485:350:144:Times:144:Times:contracts of young scientists with many experiencing the frustration of unfulfilled 
5:113:5470:28:27:89:155:322:144:Times:144:Times:expectations. 
5:114:5484:27:28:109:482:295:144:Times:144:Times:This study uses the lens of social exchange (Blau, 1964; Uehara, 1990)  a  nd 
5:115:5562:28:28:89:470:267:144:Times:144:Times:psychological contract ( Robinson et al., 1994; Rousseau, 1995) to examine the 
5:116:5641:28:27:89:486:239:144:Times:144:Times:relationship between young scientists and professors, comparing those engaged in 
5:117:5721:27:28:89:517:212:144:Times:144:Times:collaborative research with those in commercial ventures.  The former represents diffuse 
5:118:5810:28:27:89:523:184:144:Times:144:Times:exchange governed by reciprocity; and the latter represents restricted  exchange governed 
5:119:5900:27:28:89:481:157:144:Times:144:Times:by negotiated rules (Uehara, 1990). Drawing on agency theories (Bandura, 2001; 
5:120:5979:28:28:89:507:129:144:Times:144:Times:Emirbayer and Mische, 1998; Sewell Jr, 1992), the study postulates that career agency 
5:121:6065:28:0:89:477:101:144:Times:144:Times:varies in extent and form, and individuals may respond differently to unfulfilled 
6:122:6149:0:28:89:505:709:144:Times:144:Times:expectations according to the relational context in which their psychological contracts 
6:123:6237:28:27:89:507:681:144:Times:144:Times:evolve. It examines the psychological contracts of young scientists engaged in the two 
6:124:6324:27:28:89:480:654:144:Times:144:Times:types of activities and explores how the varied relational and cognitive resources 
6:125:6407:28:28:89:474:626:144:Times:144:Times:associated with them influence their agentic orientations and career behaviours. 
6:126:6487:28:27:109:508:598:144:Times:144:Times:The data are based on individual interviews with academics in the natural sciences 
6:127:6569:27:28:89:489:571:144:Times:144:Times:from t hree leading U.K. research universities. The interview sample of 40 includes 
6:128:6652:28:28:89:492:543:144:Times:144:Times:doctoral students/post-docs (24) and their professors (16) of whom four-fifths were 
6:129:6736:28:27:89:508:515:144:Times:144:Times:matched pairs. A novel finding concerns the divergent responses of young scientists to 
6:130:6823:27:28:89:491:488:144:Times:144:Times:unmet career expectations.  Those involved in collaborative research experienced a 
6:131:6906:28:27:89:521:460:144:Times:144:Times:relational psychological contract and responded by ‘extended investment’ in their current 
6:132:6996:27:28:89:496:433:144:Times:144:Times:jobs. They use ‘proxy agency’ (Bandura, 2001) by engaging in a form of gift-giving 
6:133:7079:28:28:89:517:405:144:Times:144:Times:exchange behaviour, investing heavily in their work in order to oblige their professors to 
6:134:7170:28:27:89:521:377:144:Times:144:Times:reciprocate. We find that some become ‘trapped’ in perennial temporary employment but 
6:135:7256:27:28:89:438:350:144:Times:144:Times:are ‘content to be sad’ (interview quote).  By contrast, those involved in 
6:136:7331:28:27:89:514:322:144:Times:144:Times:commercialization experienced a transactional shift in their psychological contracts and 
6:137:7420:27:28:89:519:295:144:Times:144:Times:sought independence by crafting their own entrepreneurial careers. They assert ‘personal 
6:138:7509:28:28:89:501:267:144:Times:144:Times:agency’ (Bandura, 2001), using the relationships with their professors to build up the 
6:139:7596:28:27:89:507:239:144:Times:144:Times:necessary resources in order to breakaway. They are ‘runaways’ who seek autonomy.1 
6:140:7678:27:28:109:524:212:144:Times:144:Times:The study extends the psychological contract framework to incorporate career agency 
6:141:7762:28:27:89:518:184:144:Times:144:Times:and account for the varied ways in which individuals react to unfulfilled expectations.  It 
6:142:7854:27:28:89:514:157:144:Times:144:Times:also sheds new light on the contemporary debate about the changing nature of academic 
6:143:7940:28:27:89:494:129:144:Times:144:Times:careers. The entrepreneurial university may have strengthened the two-tiered career 
6:144:8024:27:0:89:519:102:144:Times:144:Times:structure a nd restricted opportunities for upward mobility for many. However, it has also 
7:145:8117:0:28:89:523:709:144:Times:144:Times:expanded the institutional context in which scientific careers develop and offers scope for

7:147:8248:27:28:109:492:654:144:Times:144:Times:The next section presents the conceptual framework, followed by the empirical 
7:148:8326:28:28:89:521:626:144:Times:144:Times:context, and the research methods and data. The article then presents the findings on how 
7:149:8416:28:27:89:499:598:144:Times:144:Times:young scientists’ psychological contracts evolve over time and their divergent career 
7:150:8501:27:28:89:477:571:144:Times:144:Times:behaviours. It concludes by discussing the theoretical and practical significance.

7:152:8583:28:27:89:231:515:144:Times:144:Times:The conceptual framework 
7:153:8607:27:28:89:339:488:144:Times:144:Times:The psychological contract and unmet expectations 
7:154:8656:28:27:89:524:460:144:Times:144:Times:Rousseau (1995) defines the psychological contract as an individual’s belief regarding the 
7:155:8747:27:28:89:524:433:144:Times:144:Times:terms and conditions of exchange between themselves and the employer. It emerges when 
7:156:8833:28:28:89:498:405:144:Times:144:Times:individuals believe their employer has promised future benefits in exchange for their 
7:157:8918:28:27:89:497:377:144:Times:144:Times:contribution. Social exchange theory posits that balance in exchange relationships is 
7:158:9004:27:28:89:482:350:144:Times:144:Times:expected (Blau, 1964) and therefore unfulfilled promises made by employers can 
7:159:9082:28:27:89:512:322:144:Times:144:Times:adversely affect employees’ attitudes and behaviours (Robinson et al., 1994).  The term 
7:160:9169:27:28:89:520:295:144:Times:144:Times:psychological contract breach is commonly used to describe both employees’ beliefs that 
7:161:9257:28:28:89:496:267:144:Times:144:Times:their employer has failed to fulfil its promised obligations and the resulting negative 
7:162:9344:28:27:89:519:239:144:Times:144:Times:reactions ( Morrison and Robinson, 1997). A large body of research has shown that when 
7:163:9431:27:28:89:497:212:144:Times:144:Times:promissory expectations are unfulfilled, employees are likely to experience negative 
7:164:9516:28:27:89:480:184:144:Times:144:Times:attitudes (e.g. mistrust and reduced commitment) and work behaviours (e.g. poor 
7:165:9596:27:28:89:502:157:144:Times:144:Times:performance, absenteeism and turnover) (Conway et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2007).    It 
7:166:9683:28:28:89:523:129:144:Times:144:Times:stresses employee disengagement and focuses predominantly on organizationally relevant 
7:167:9769:28:0:89:484:101:144:Times:144:Times:outcomes, leading to a relative neglect of research on individuals’ career adaptive 
8:168:9855:0:28:89:523:709:144:Times:144:Times:behaviour. One exception is the work of Sturges et al. (2005; 2010), which examines how 
8:169:9943:28:27:89:515:681:144:Times:144:Times:psychological contract fulfilment or breach in terms of perceived organizational support 
8:170:10032:27:28:89:498:654:144:Times:144:Times:and leader-member exchange affects employees’ career self-management behaviour. 
8:171:10112:28:28:89:496:626:144:Times:144:Times:According to the authors, high levels of perceived organizational support and leader-
8:172:10197:28:27:89:509:598:144:Times:144:Times:member exchange encourage employees to engage in internal career self-management, 
8:173:10279:27:28:89:506:571:144:Times:144:Times:whereas its absence is associated with external career self-management. Although this 
8:174:10365:28:28:89:513:543:144:Times:144:Times:work shows the link between the psychological contract and career self-management, it 
8:175:10451:28:27:89:497:515:144:Times:144:Times:stresses organizational commitment as a mediating factor. As such, employee career 
8:176:10534:27:28:89:521:488:144:Times:144:Times:behaviour is  viewed as reciprocation to the employer’s action rather than as self-directed. 
8:177:10627:28:27:109:493:460:144:Times:144:Times:The psychological contract literature often portrays employees as victims when 
8:178:10706:27:28:89:516:433:144:Times:144:Times:career promises are broken. It overlooks individual proactivity in career shaping ( Seeck 
8:179:10796:28:28:89:513:405:144:Times:144:Times:and Parzefall, 2008). This is  somewhat surprising given that the psychological contract 
8:180:10885:28:27:89:504:377:144:Times:144:Times:has been regarded as one of the most useful concepts for understanding contemporary 
8:181:10968:27:28:89:479:350:144:Times:144:Times:employment relationships where the breakdown of the ‘old deal’ based on stable 
8:182:11046:28:27:89:495:322:144:Times:144:Times:organizational careers is seen as giving way to a ‘new deal’ characterised by greater 
8:183:11132:27:28:89:477:295:144:Times:144:Times:reliance on individual initiative ( Briscoe et al., 2012; De Vos and Soens, 2008).  
8:184:11216:28:28:89:477:267:144:Times:144:Times:Rousseau et al. (  2006) draw attention to the growth of idiosyncratic deals where 
8:185:11299:28:27:89:503:239:144:Times:144:Times:individual employees negotiate with an employer to adapt work arrangements to their 
8:186:11383:27:28:89:523:212:144:Times:144:Times:needs and work preferences. The notion of ‘boundaryless careers’ ( Arthur and Rousseau, 
8:187:11471:28:27:89:508:184:144:Times:144:Times:1996) highlights a wider range of career forms beyond a single organization, the scope 
8:188:11558:27:28:89:492:157:144:Times:144:Times:for choice and proactive role of individuals in managing their own careers. Further, 
8:189:11643:28:28:89:511:129:144:Times:144:Times:Briscoe et al (2012) argue that employees’ self-directed protean attitudes may motivate 
8:190:11731:28:0:89:512:101:144:Times:144:Times:them to engage in active coping strategies in uncertain contexts. One can expect greater 
9:191:11822:0:28:89:502:709:144:Times:144:Times:use of career agency in professional knowledge work wherein employees have a high 
9:192:11904:28:27:89:520:681:144:Times:144:Times:degree of work autonomy and are more likely to assert their preferences and professional 
9:193:11993:27:28:89:250:654:144:Times:144:Times:goals ( Hall and Chandler, 2005). 
9:194:12027:28:28:109:475:626:144:Times:144:Times:  Although some scholars have argued that individual agency has been over-
9:195:12101:28:27:89:524:598:144:Times:144:Times:emphasized in the contemporary career literature (Inkson et al., 2012), it h as deep roots in 
9:196:12195:27:28:89:514:571:144:Times:144:Times:career studies. In vocational psychology, Super’s (1981) career development theory and 
9:197:12282:28:28:89:505:543:144:Times:144:Times:Lent and colleagues’ ( Lent et al., 1994; Lent and Brown, 2013) socio-cognitive career 
9:198:12369:28:27:89:501:515:144:Times:144:Times:theory emphasize individual proactivity in career development. Scholars who adopt a 
9:199:12453:27:28:89:503:488:144:Times:144:Times:sociological perspective suggest the possibility for individuals to draw on interpretive 
9:200:12542:28:27:89:502:460:144:Times:144:Times:schemes, resources and institutional norms for enacting careers in novel ways despite 
9:201:12628:27:28:89:496:433:144:Times:144:Times:institutional constraints ( Barley, 1989; Duberley et al., 2006).  The neglect of career 
9:202:12717:28:28:89:467:405:144:Times:144:Times:agency in psychological contract theory has limited our understanding of how 
9:203:12794:28:27:89:514:377:144:Times:144:Times:individuals’ work situations and preferences influence their psychological contracts and 
9:204:12883:27:28:89:508:350:144:Times:144:Times:responses to unfulfilled expectations. It also restricts the scope of the theory to explain 
9:205:12974:28:27:89:486:322:144:Times:144:Times:the differential effects of unmet expectations and the possibility of more proactive 
9:206:13059:27:28:89:145:295:144:Times:144:Times:responses.

9:209:13144:27:28:89:495:212:144:Times:144:Times:A central question in career studies is whether careers are the outcome of individual 
9:210:13230:28:27:89:496:184:144:Times:144:Times:action or social structures. Career scholars have called for a balanced perspective by 
9:211:13317:27:28:89:512:157:144:Times:144:Times:incorporating both.  For example, Dany et al ( 2011: 972) note that the contrast between 
9:212:13406:28:28:89:509:129:144:Times:144:Times:the bounded and boundaryless career is simplistic in its viewpoint regarding individual 
9:213:13494:28:0:89:516:101:144:Times:144:Times:agency and structures, and they propose ‘an alternative approach that accounts better for 
10:214:13586:0:28:89:516:709:144:Times:144:Times:the simultaneous influences of both individual choices and environmental constraints on 
10:215:13674:28:27:89:520:681:144:Times:144:Times:careers’. Tams and Arthur (2010) suggest an ‘interdependent’ perspective for reconciling 
10:216:13763:27:28:89:471:654:144:Times:144:Times:the independent (individual agency) with the dependent (structural constraints) 
10:217:13843:28:28:89:493:626:144:Times:144:Times:conceptualization of career agency. This study goes beyond the duality argument to 
10:218:13926:28:27:89:497:598:144:Times:144:Times:explain how and why individual a gency varies in extent and form.  It conceptualizes 
10:219:14010:27:28:89:492:571:144:Times:144:Times:career agency as comprising three elements: objective (socio-relational), subjective 
10:220:14094:28:28:89:491:543:144:Times:144:Times:(socio-cognitive) and projective (temporal orientation). It postulates that individual 
10:221:14180:28:27:89:512:515:144:Times:144:Times:agency is relationally and temporally embedded,  and that socially patterned selves (e.g. 
10:222:14270:27:28:89:503:488:144:Times:144:Times:motivations and preferences) and their temporal orientations interact within relational 
10:223:14358:28:27:89:357:460:144:Times:144:Times:contexts to shape agentic orientations and behaviours.   
10:224:14415:27:28:109:516:433:144:Times:144:Times:From an ‘objective’ perspective, agency concerns the capacity to exert some control 
10:225:14499:28:28:89:520:405:144:Times:144:Times:over social relations in which one is enmeshed. It arises from actors’ control of resources 
10:226:14590:28:27:89:527:377:144:Times:144:Times:and knowledge of schemas which endow them with the capacity and power to act ( Sewell 
10:227:14676:27:28:89:486:350:144:Times:144:Times:Jr, 1992). In career terms, it refers to individuals’ ability to mobilise the necessary 
10:228:14764:28:27:89:471:322:144:Times:144:Times:resources for career development and actions taken to eliminate environmental 
10:229:14842:27:28:89:524:295:144:Times:144:Times:constraints to realise their career goals. T he notion of career self-management emphasises 
10:230:14934:28:28:89:515:267:144:Times:144:Times:the control-producing responses of employees to career threats ( King, 2004). It involves 
10:231:15024:28:27:89:516:239:144:Times:144:Times:the execution of various types of control behaviours including: influencing the decisions 
10:232:15114:27:28:89:489:212:144:Times:144:Times:of key gatekeepers ( Judge and Bretz Jr, 1994), positioning oneself for job mobility 
10:233:15198:28:27:89:495:184:144:Times:144:Times:through investment in human capital and developing networks ( Fugate et al., 2004). 
10:234:15282:27:28:89:494:157:144:Times:144:Times:Similarly, the concepts of ‘job crafting’ (Wrzesniewski and Dutton, 2001) and ‘role 
10:235:15366:28:0:89:522:129:144:Times:144:Times:innovation’ (Nicholson, 1984) emphasise the proactive role of employees in changing the 
11:236:15456:0:28:89:464:709:144:Times:144:Times:task and relational boundaries of their work that, in turn, shape their own role 
11:237:15537:28:27:89:270:681:144:Times:144:Times:requirements and career trajectories.  
11:238:15575:27:28:109:503:654:144:Times:144:Times:Agency also entails a ‘subjective’ component because cognition, motivations and 
11:239:15655:28:28:89:511:626:144:Times:144:Times:preferences influence action and outcomes. Bandura’s (2001) socio-cognitive theory of 
11:240:15741:28:27:89:492:598:144:Times:144:Times:agency emphasises the self-directedness of action driven by agents’ motivation and 
11:241:15824:27:28:89:498:571:144:Times:144:Times:efficacy beliefs.  Research which informs our understanding of career agency from a 
11:242:15908:28:28:89:498:543:144:Times:144:Times:subjective perspective points to the role of self-efficacy and outcome expectations in 
11:243:15995:28:27:89:500:515:144:Times:144:Times:career development (Lent et al., 1994), and the influence of self-defined goals ( Hall, 
11:244:16083:27:28:89:516:488:144:Times:144:Times:2002) and work identities (Ibarra 2003) on how individuals enact careers and respond to 
11:245:16171:28:27:89:513:460:144:Times:144:Times:barriers. Schein’s (1996) notion of ‘career anchor’ suggests that higher order goals (e.g. 
11:246:16262:27:28:89:495:433:144:Times:144:Times:possession of a vocational ‘calling’) drive and constrain individuals’ career choices. 
11:247:16349:28:28:89:503:405:144:Times:144:Times:Arguably, professional knowledge workers are more likely to exhibit a ‘calling’ work 
11:248:16434:28:27:89:523:377:144:Times:144:Times:orientation and attach greater importance to subjective career success (Hall and Chandler, 
11:249:16525:27:28:89:515:350:144:Times:144:Times:2005). By linking agency to identity and self-actualization, the subjective perspective of 
11:250:16616:28:27:89:519:322:144:Times:144:Times:career agency accords individuals a much higher degree of psychological autonomy than 
11:251:16702:27:28:89:336:295:144:Times:144:Times:is often assumed in psychological contract theory.  
11:252:16754:28:28:109:483:267:144:Times:144:Times:Agency is also temporally embedded and has a ‘projective’ dimension in that 
11:253:16829:28:27:89:506:239:144:Times:144:Times:imagining possibilities for future action may regulate and motivate current behaviour.  
11:254:16917:27:28:89:524:212:144:Times:144:Times:Bandura’s (2001) notion of ‘forethought’ highlights the temporal extension of agency and 
11:255:17006:28:27:89:462:184:144:Times:144:Times:suggests that goals operate principally through people’s capacity to represent 
11:256:17085:27:28:89:519:157:144:Times:144:Times:symbolically desired future outcomes.  Emirbayer and Mische (1998: 963) conceptualize 
11:257:17170:28:28:89:511:129:144:Times:144:Times:agency ‘as a temporally embedded process of social engagement, informed by the past, 
11:258:17255:28:0:89:501:101:144:Times:144:Times:but also oriented toward the future and toward the present’. Although they assert that 
12:259:17344:0:28:89:505:709:144:Times:144:Times:actors are always living simultaneously in the past, future and present, it is possible to 
12:260:17435:28:27:89:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:speak of one element being predominant. For example, Tomlinson et al. ( 2013) show that 
12:261:17523:27:28:89:507:654:144:Times:144:Times:the career strategies developed by legal professionals were distinctive in terms of their 
12:262:17613:28:28:89:491:626:144:Times:144:Times:temporality: whereas recently qualified lawyers engaged in more projective, future-
12:263:17696:28:27:89:472:598:144:Times:144:Times:focused strategies, older lawyers adopted a compromise strategy. The temporal 
12:264:17774:27:28:89:506:571:144:Times:144:Times:perspective highlights t he projective capacity of human agency,  which can powerfully 
12:265:17861:28:28:89:498:543:144:Times:144:Times:influence individuals’ ability to make choices at  t urning points. Sullivian and Arthur 
12:266:17949:28:27:89:496:515:144:Times:144:Times:(2006) contend that individuals’ ‘psychological mobility’, defined as the capacity to 
12:267:18035:27:28:89:499:488:144:Times:144:Times:move on, may influence their response to career interruptions.  Further, the notion of 
12:268:18121:28:27:89:488:460:144:Times:144:Times:‘future work selves’ (Strauss et al., 2012) suggests that actors’ beliefs about future 
12:269:18208:27:28:89:512:433:144:Times:144:Times:possibilities or cognitive representations of who they would like to become can provide 
12:270:18296:28:28:89:338:405:144:Times:144:Times:motivational resources for current agentic choices.  
12:271:18349:28:27:109:492:377:144:Times:144:Times:Individuals exercise different degrees and forms of agency which may result in 
12:272:18428:27:28:89:507:350:144:Times:144:Times:different behavioural outcome.  Agency can be more, or less, socially mediated or self-
12:273:18515:28:27:89:501:322:144:Times:144:Times:referenced and it may have a stronger focus on the present or future.  Bandura (2001) 
12:274:18601:27:28:89:493:295:144:Times:144:Times:distinguishes ‘   personal’ from ‘ proxy’ agency: the former is rooted more strongly in 
12:275:18689:28:28:89:509:267:144:Times:144:Times:people’s efficacy beliefs and aspirational pursuits, whereas the latter relies on others to 
12:276:18781:28:27:89:474:239:144:Times:144:Times:act on one’s behest to secure desired outcomes. These two modes differ in their

12:278:18948:28:27:89:521:184:144:Times:144:Times:who display personal agency regard structural conditions as resources and seek to exploit 
12:279:19038:27:28:89:494:157:144:Times:144:Times:them for self-development and the creation of new possibilities. It enables temporal 
12:280:19123:28:28:89:485:129:144:Times:144:Times:extension of agency through intention and forethought.    In contrast, proxy agency 
12:281:19207:28:0:89:519:101:144:Times:144:Times:involves the strategy of influencing those who control the structures to secure the needed 
13:282:19301:0:28:89:512:709:144:Times:144:Times:resources. It relies on social efficacy for enlisting the mediative efforts of others, which 
13:283:19394:28:27:89:504:681:144:Times:144:Times:may result in increased dependency and diminish self-efficacy and capacity to engage 
13:284:19478:27:28:89:284:654:144:Times:144:Times:imaginatively with future opportunities.

13:287:19581:27:28:89:519:571:144:Times:144:Times:This study extends the psychological contract framework by incorporating career agency 
13:288:19668:28:28:89:520:543:144:Times:144:Times:for understanding variation in employee responses to unmet expectations. At present, the 
13:289:19757:28:27:89:520:515:144:Times:144:Times:main sources of variation are seen as contingent on the quality of exchange relationships. 
13:290:19848:27:28:89:493:488:144:Times:144:Times:Typically, psychological contract theory concerns breach in relation to relational or 
13:291:19933:28:27:89:513:460:144:Times:144:Times:transactional exchange. It is commonly argued that relational exchange allows actors to 
13:292:20021:27:28:89:524:433:144:Times:144:Times:be more trusting of one another whereas transactional exchange tends to be more quid pro 
13:293:20110:28:28:89:519:405:144:Times:144:Times:quo; therefore, when the exchange is transactional employees are more likely to perceive 
13:294:20199:28:27:89:504:377:144:Times:144:Times:unmet expectations as psychological c ontract breach and respond more intensely and 
13:295:20283:27:28:89:303:350:144:Times:144:Times:negatively (Morrison and Robinson, 1997).  
13:296:20326:28:27:109:521:322:144:Times:144:Times:The agentic perspective argues that types of exchange not only influence individuals’ 
13:297:20412:27:28:89:508:295:144:Times:144:Times:perception of unmet expectations, but may also endow t hem with varied relational and 
13:298:20498:28:28:89:512:267:144:Times:144:Times:cognitive resources for the enactment of agency. Uehara’s (1990) dual exchange theory 
13:299:20584:28:27:89:494:239:144:Times:144:Times:links forms of social exchange with the dynamics of social support and exchangers’ 
13:300:20667:27:28:89:520:212:144:Times:144:Times:resource mobilization strategies.  It distinguishes two types of social exchange - ‘diffuse’ 
13:301:20760:28:27:89:519:184:144:Times:144:Times:and ‘restricted’ -  that vary in their norms and degree of relational embeddedness. Diffuse 
13:302:20852:27:28:89:486:157:144:Times:144:Times:exchange is governed by reciprocity  and is embedded in dense networks of social 
13:303:20933:28:28:89:518:129:144:Times:144:Times:relationships in which particularistic and symbolic resources (e.g. emotional support and 
13:304:21023:28:0:89:484:101:144:Times:144:Times:status) are exchanged in addition to tangible resources (e.g. money and labour). It 
14:305:21110:0:28:89:480:709:144:Times:144:Times:engenders a high degree of solidarity and individuals are more likely to mobilize 
14:306:21192:28:27:89:483:681:144:Times:144:Times:relational resources for problem solving. By contrast, restricted exchange is more 
14:307:21275:27:28:89:495:654:144:Times:144:Times:dyadically-based and involves specific relationships in which tangible resources are 
14:308:21360:28:28:89:523:626:144:Times:144:Times:exchanged in a negotiated fashion. It is characterized by a higher degree of accountability 
14:309:21452:28:27:89:501:598:144:Times:144:Times:in each partner’s behaviour and partners tend to be more guarded in their transaction. 
14:310:21539:27:28:89:495:571:144:Times:144:Times:Individuals in restricted exchange do not enjoy the same kind of social support as in 
14:311:21625:28:28:89:516:543:144:Times:144:Times:diffuse exchange. They tend to be more self-reliant and may draw on personal resources 
14:312:21712:28:27:89:483:515:144:Times:144:Times:for problem adaptation.  Accordingly, we expect individuals involved in different 
14:313:21794:27:28:89:514:488:144:Times:144:Times:exchange relationships to develop different agentic orientations and resource capacities. 
14:314:21884:28:27:109:520:460:144:Times:144:Times: F orms of exchange, notably supervisory and mentoring relationships, can also affect 
14:315:21969:27:28:89:478:433:144:Times:144:Times:career agency through socialization and learning which provide individuals with 
14:316:22049:28:28:89:521:405:144:Times:144:Times:cognitive resources and competences for career development. The psychological contract 
14:317:22135:28:27:89:508:377:144:Times:144:Times:literature stresses the  influence of supervisory support on organizational commitment, 
14:318:22223:27:28:89:505:350:144:Times:144:Times:which mediates the effects of psychological contract breach on individuals’ responses 
14:319:22309:28:27:89:483:322:144:Times:144:Times:(Sturges et al., 2010; Zagenczyk et al., 2009). The agentic perspective argues that 
14:320:22393:27:28:89:523:295:144:Times:144:Times:individuals’ career goals and professional self-identity can also powerfully influence t heir 
14:321:22486:28:28:89:505:267:144:Times:144:Times:career behaviours.  Mentoring exchange can influence individuals’ career orientations 
14:322:22571:28:27:89:486:239:144:Times:144:Times:and identity construction through role-modelling and socialization. Gibson (2004) 
14:323:22652:27:28:89:510:212:144:Times:144:Times:distinguishes ‘global’ and ‘specific’ role modelling, which differ in the extent to which 
14:324:22742:28:27:89:489:184:144:Times:144:Times:individuals acquire a wide or narrow set of traits associated with a role model. The 
14:325:22826:27:28:89:504:157:144:Times:144:Times:former may result in fuller socialization and individuals may develop a custodian role 
14:326:22913:28:28:89:520:129:144:Times:144:Times:orientation and job commitment, whereas the latter may result in partial socialization and 
14:327:23004:28:0:89:497:101:144:Times:144:Times:individuals may develop more varied career orientations.  Thus, whether individuals 
15:328:23091:0:28:89:499:709:144:Times:144:Times:engage in internally- or externally-oriented career self-management may reflect their 
15:329:23177:28:27:89:399:681:144:Times:144:Times:career preferences and not simply organizational commitment.   
15:330:23240:27:28:109:518:654:144:Times:144:Times:The psychological contract literature has focused predominantly on how employees’ 
15:331:23322:28:28:89:503:626:144:Times:144:Times:perception of breaches of past promises made by employers affects their attitudes and 
15:332:23408:28:27:89:498:598:144:Times:144:Times:behaviours. The agentic perspective directs attention to how individuals’ future time 
15:333:23494:27:28:89:493:571:144:Times:144:Times:horizons and projective capacities affect their career behaviours. The psychological 
15:334:23579:28:28:89:472:543:144:Times:144:Times:contract evolves over time. Its direction of change and how individuals react to 
15:335:23660:28:27:89:485:515:144:Times:144:Times:unfulfilled promises are influenced not only by their assessment of past or present 
15:336:23744:27:28:89:518:488:144:Times:144:Times:experience but also by the anticipation of future benefits ( Ng and Feldman, 2012). Some 
15:337:23833:28:27:89:504:460:144:Times:144:Times:employer obligations (e.g. career development and job security) may be on-going and 
15:338:23917:27:28:89:503:433:144:Times:144:Times:may not be perceived by employees as fully discharged at any particular point in time 
15:339:24003:28:28:89:520:405:144:Times:144:Times:(Coyle-Shapiro and Kessler, 2002).  Individuals may reciprocate future benefits as a way 
15:340:24092:28:27:89:487:377:144:Times:144:Times:of creating a positive imbalance in the exchange to ensure the realization of future 
15:341:24177:27:28:89:515:350:144:Times:144:Times:benefits (Blau, 1964).  Individuals at early or transitional career stages are more likely to 
15:342:24271:28:27:89:521:322:144:Times:144:Times:reciprocate anticipated future fulfilment of promises than those in late careers. Moreover, 
15:343:24363:27:28:89:493:295:144:Times:144:Times:their capacity to envision alternative options may also influence career behaviours.  
15:344:24449:28:28:109:518:267:144:Times:144:Times:The conceptual framework situates individuals’ psychological contracts within types 
15:345:24533:28:27:89:490:239:144:Times:144:Times:of exchange that create variability in agentic orientations and capacities, and hence 
15:346:24619:27:28:89:298:212:144:Times:144:Times:different responses to unmet expectations.

16:350:24735:0:28:89:512:709:144:Times:144:Times:University scientists provide an ‘extreme case’ (Eisenhardt, 1989) for examining career 
16:351:24823:28:27:89:491:681:144:Times:144:Times:agency in its three constituent forms.  Compared to other workers, they enjoy great 
16:352:24906:27:28:89:515:654:144:Times:144:Times:autonomy in their work and possess considerable knowledge resources which give them 
16:353:24990:28:28:89:519:626:144:Times:144:Times:much control over their work relationships and environments.  ‘Objective’ career agency 
16:354:25077:28:27:89:513:598:144:Times:144:Times:should be quite visible in their work. Moreover, scientific researchers are often strongly 
16:355:25168:27:28:89:516:571:144:Times:144:Times:committed to their work and anchor their self-identity in their profession (Henkel 2005). 
16:356:25258:28:28:89:483:543:144:Times:144:Times:For many, science is a ‘vocation’ (Weber, 1958) imbued with personal and social 
16:357:25338:28:27:89:497:515:144:Times:144:Times:meaning.   Hence, ‘subjective’ agency can also be central to their career actions.  We 
16:358:25425:27:28:89:511:488:144:Times:144:Times:focus on early career scientists in order to examine the ‘projective’ dimension of career 
16:359:25515:28:27:89:504:460:144:Times:144:Times:agency.  Academic careers in natural sciences are marked by distinct stages and place 
16:360:25601:27:28:89:524:433:144:Times:144:Times:great emphasis on the attainment of benchmarks at each stage. A conventional career path 
16:361:25690:28:28:89:495:405:144:Times:144:Times:involves a doctoral qualification followed by a postdoctoral phase which serves as a 
16:362:25775:28:27:89:519:377:144:Times:144:Times:critical transition to standard academic employment. Actors at these transitions generally 
16:363:25865:27:28:89:439:350:144:Times:144:Times:exert greater agentic effort than at other times ( Hitlin and Elder, 2007).   
16:364:25943:28:27:109:484:322:144:Times:144:Times:The entrepreneurial university provides an excellent context for exploring the 
16:365:26022:27:28:89:518:295:144:Times:144:Times:changing dynamics of psychological contracts and career behaviours of young scientists. 
16:366:26110:28:28:89:486:267:144:Times:144:Times:In traditional scientific careers, training follows a ‘master-apprentice’ relationship 
16:367:26197:28:27:89:505:239:144:Times:144:Times:between professors and young scientists which is governed by the norm of reciprocity 
16:368:26281:27:28:89:517:212:144:Times:144:Times:embedded in the scientific community ( Long and McGinnis, 1985). Young scientists are 
16:369:26367:28:27:89:516:184:144:Times:144:Times:‘apprentice-learners’ who provide research assistance in return for mentoring and career 
16:370:26456:27:28:89:505:157:144:Times:144:Times:support. The rise of academic entrepreneurialism with its emphasis on the dual role of 
16:371:26543:28:28:89:505:129:144:Times:144:Times:professors as scientist-entrepreneurs  is altering these relationships ( Etzkowitz, 2003). 
16:372:26634:28:0:89:496:101:144:Times:144:Times:Professors who are heavily engaged in industrial projects often need a large army of 
17:373:26722:0:28:89:509:709:144:Times:144:Times:doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers. These young scientists, with their short-
17:374:26811:28:27:89:472:681:144:Times:144:Times:tenure and complementary research skills, provide a flexible and highly trained 
17:375:26891:27:28:89:508:654:144:Times:144:Times:workforce for the academic laboratories. The entrepreneurial university may transform 
17:376:26977:28:28:89:498:626:144:Times:144:Times:young scientists from ‘apprentice learners’ into ‘research workers’ or even ‘business 
17:377:27063:28:27:89:508:598:144:Times:144:Times:partners’ in commercial ventures. Intense industrial engagement may also restrict their 
17:378:27150:27:28:89:497:571:144:Times:144:Times:scientific development and diminish their chances of permanent academic positions. 
17:379:27233:28:28:89:519:543:144:Times:144:Times:Many are likely to find their academic career expectations unfulfilled and may seek to re-
17:380:27323:28:27:89:182:515:144:Times:144:Times:craft their careers.

17:383:27431:27:28:89:244:433:144:Times:144:Times:versus commercial engagement 
17:384:27459:28:28:89:512:405:144:Times:144:Times:This study distinguishes two types of industrial engagement: collaborative research and 
17:385:27547:28:27:89:506:377:144:Times:144:Times:commercial ventures. They entail different exchange relationships between professors 
17:386:27632:27:28:89:493:350:144:Times:144:Times:and young scientists, and provide different socialization and learning opportunities. 
17:387:27718:28:27:89:517:322:144:Times:144:Times:Collaborative research is an open-science channel of industrial engagement governed by 
17:388:27805:27:28:89:510:295:144:Times:144:Times:an established academic framework and scientific norms of exchange.  It is a relational-
17:389:27893:28:28:89:495:267:144:Times:144:Times:based, diffuse exchange relationship that builds on the flow of knowledge resources 
17:390:27977:28:27:89:505:239:144:Times:144:Times:between the parties involved. Involvement of young scientists need not undermine the 
17:391:28062:27:28:89:523:212:144:Times:144:Times:professors’ teaching/mentoring role (Bozeman and Corley 2004). Indeed, the provision of 
17:392:28150:28:27:89:483:184:144:Times:144:Times:funding resources may reinforce mentoring and generate a cooperative exchange. 
17:393:28229:27:28:89:508:157:144:Times:144:Times:Commercial research, by contrast, is governed by the norm of proprietary science with 
17:394:28315:28:28:89:501:129:144:Times:144:Times:the aim of generating specific outputs that can be appropriated for financial gain (e.g. 
17:395:28404:28:0:89:486:101:144:Times:144:Times:patenting and spin-off company formation).  Industrial sponsors may restrict open 
18:396:28489:0:28:89:503:709:144:Times:144:Times:dissemination and publication. The relationship is governed by negotiated rules and it 
18:397:28576:28:27:89:518:681:144:Times:144:Times:involves flows of financial resources in addition to knowledge. Commercial engagement 
18:398:28662:27:28:89:515:654:144:Times:144:Times:adds a transactional element to the master-apprentice relationship. The interface is more 
18:399:28752:28:28:89:479:626:144:Times:144:Times:dyadic and occurs at the boundary between science and business. The role of the 
18:400:28832:28:27:89:524:598:144:Times:144:Times:professor as business person/entrepreneur may conflict with that of teacher/mentor ( Mars 
18:401:28922:27:28:89:493:571:144:Times:144:Times:et al., 2008). Commercial engagement exposes young scientists to greater scientific 
18:402:29006:28:28:89:509:543:144:Times:144:Times:career risks while also providing opportunities for entrepreneurial learning (Azoulay et 
18:403:29095:28:27:89:141:515:144:Times:144:Times:al., 2009). 
18:404:29107:27:28:109:521:488:144:Times:144:Times:These two types of activities display the different norms and structures governing the 
18:405:29194:28:27:89:499:460:144:Times:144:Times:exchange between young scientists and professors. Collaborative research represents 
18:406:29278:27:28:89:473:433:144:Times:144:Times:diffuse exchange whereas commercial engagement entails restricted exchange.

18:410:29520:28:27:89:524:322:144:Times:144:Times:young scientists and professors where research collaboration builds on an exchange based

18:413:29781:28:27:89:523:239:144:Times:144:Times:scientists regarding training and career development. It adopts the widely used distinction 
18:414:29873:27:28:89:513:212:144:Times:144:Times:between ‘relational’ and ‘transactional’ contracts ( Rousseau, 1995).  The former entails 
18:415:29963:28:27:89:522:184:144:Times:144:Times:broad relationships in which obligations are both economic and socio-emotional, whereas 
18:416:30051:27:28:89:519:157:144:Times:144:Times:the latter is composed of obligations that are more specific and economic in nature based 
18:417:30141:28:0:89:273:129:144:Times:144:Times:on limited involvement of the parties. 
19:418:30182:0:28:109:507:709:144:Times:144:Times:We examine young scientists at different stages of their careers: doctoral students, 
19:419:30267:28:27:89:498:681:144:Times:144:Times:and junior and senior postdoctoral researchers. The first two categories are primarily 
19:420:30354:27:28:89:479:654:144:Times:144:Times:student/learners in training, whereas the last category refers to more experienced 
19:421:30437:28:28:89:493:626:144:Times:144:Times:researchers in contract employment beyond the initial training period. Although the 
19:422:30521:28:27:89:514:598:144:Times:144:Times:transition from training to employment is gradual, the psychological contract governing 
19:423:30609:27:28:89:494:571:144:Times:144:Times:the two differs. In a training context, the mutual obligations between professors and 
19:424:30695:28:28:89:485:543:144:Times:144:Times:young researchers are loosely specified in an open, mentoring exchange. Doctoral 
19:425:30776:28:27:89:495:515:144:Times:144:Times:students and junior researchers are at the beginning of their research careers and the 
19:426:30863:27:28:89:463:488:144:Times:144:Times:acquisition of knowledge and skills for their future careers are central to their 
19:427:30945:28:27:89:483:460:144:Times:144:Times:psychological contracts. Moreover, given the imbalance of knowledge and power 
19:428:31023:27:28:89:511:433:144:Times:144:Times:between the two parties, the expectations for exchange symmetry may also be low. The 
19:429:31108:28:28:89:472:405:144:Times:144:Times:psychological contract is a nascent one, developing but not fully formed.  In an 
19:430:31189:28:27:89:477:377:144:Times:144:Times:employment relationship, the interface between the two parties builds on a more 
19:431:31269:27:28:89:510:350:144:Times:144:Times:developed psychological contract.  Professors, as principal investigators and laboratory 
19:432:31358:28:27:89:505:322:144:Times:144:Times:managers, are the primary contract makers responsible for the performance and career 
19:433:31443:27:28:89:512:295:144:Times:144:Times:development of postdocs. Postdoctoral researchers usually aspire to an academic career 
19:434:31530:28:28:89:510:267:144:Times:144:Times:and see the position as a bridge towards tenured posts. They depend on their professors 
19:435:31618:28:27:89:503:239:144:Times:144:Times:for career support in return for their cooperative efforts. The academic career promise 
19:436:31706:27:28:89:308:212:144:Times:144:Times:looms large in their psychological contracts.  
19:437:31752:28:27:109:482:184:144:Times:144:Times:The empirical study examines the shift in the young scientists’ psychological 
19:438:31830:27:28:89:499:157:144:Times:144:Times:contracts as they progress from student-learners to postdoctoral researchers and their 
19:439:31917:28:28:89:466:129:144:Times:144:Times:related career behaviours. We expect young scientists engaged respectively in 
19:440:31994:28:0:89:475:101:144:Times:144:Times:collaborative and in commercial research to respond differently to unmet career 
20:441:32076:0:28:89:490:709:144:Times:144:Times:expectations owing to the different relational contexts in which their psychological 
20:442:32161:28:28:89:475:681:144:Times:144:Times:contracts evolve and the corresponding resource opportunities and constraints.   
20:443:32242:28:27:89:92:653:144:Times:144:Times: 
20:444:32242:27:28:89:234:626:144:Times:144:Times:Research methods and data 
20:445:32267:28:27:89:167:598:144:Times:144:Times:Data collection 
20:446:32282:27:28:89:499:571:144:Times:144:Times:Primary data collection involved semi-structured interviews with 40 academics from 
20:447:32365:28:28:89:456:543:144:Times:144:Times:three major UK research universities, covering the disciplines of biological, 
20:448:32443:28:27:89:522:515:144:Times:144:Times:computer/engineering and physical sciences where academic entrepreneurialism has been 
20:449:32529:27:28:89:518:488:144:Times:144:Times:actively pursued. The sample comprises 24 doctoral students/postdocs and 16 professors 
20:450:32616:28:27:89:500:460:144:Times:144:Times:of whom 13 were supervisors of these young scientists. Given our focus on exchange 
20:451:32698:27:28:89:512:433:144:Times:144:Times:relationships, we conducted individual interviews where possible with matched pairs of 
20:452:32785:28:28:89:518:405:144:Times:144:Times:professors-students/researchers. In some cases, we interviewed more than one researcher 
20:453:32873:28:27:89:514:377:144:Times:144:Times:linked to the same professor. Of the 24 students/postdocs, we were able to interview the 
20:454:32962:27:28:89:510:350:144:Times:144:Times:corresponding professors in 20 cases. The sample was purposively selected to examine 
20:455:33047:28:27:89:488:322:144:Times:144:Times:the relationships between professors and young scientists engaged in collaborative 
20:456:33130:27:28:89:463:295:144:Times:144:Times:research and commercial ventures. We searched the webpages of the relevant 
20:457:33205:28:28:89:487:267:144:Times:144:Times:departments and examined closely the CVs of professors and identified those with 
20:458:33286:28:27:89:521:239:144:Times:144:Times:extensive industrial links. The professors interviewed were established academics in their 
20:459:33377:27:28:89:498:212:144:Times:144:Times:fields and had been involved in industrial links for a substantial period. The doctoral 
20:460:33465:28:27:89:498:184:144:Times:144:Times:students and postdocs, who had close involvement in their professors’ projects, were 
20:461:33550:27:28:89:490:157:144:Times:144:Times:identified either from the interviews with the professors or through web searches.2  
20:462:33635:28:27:89:510:129:144:Times:144:Times:Among the 24 young scientists interviewed, 15 were involved in collaborative research 
20:463:33721:27:0:89:494:102:144:Times:144:Times:and 9 were engaged in commercial projects.  These two groups gave us two distinct 
21:464:33806:0:28:89:485:709:144:Times:144:Times:windows through which to observe the different exchange relationships with their 
21:465:33887:28:27:89:148:681:144:Times:144:Times:professors.  
21:466:33899:27:28:89:496:654:144:Times:144:Times: The young scientists comprise 6 doctoral students (mostly in their final years), 7 
21:467:33982:28:28:89:505:626:144:Times:144:Times:junior postdocs (in their first or second employment contracts) and 11 senior postdocs 
21:468:34068:28:27:89:513:598:144:Times:144:Times:(three or more contracts) who had been working as contract researchers for the duration 
21:469:34156:27:28:89:519:571:144:Times:144:Times:ranging from 10 to 23 years. The post-doctoral period provides a transition during which 
21:470:34245:28:28:89:520:543:144:Times:144:Times:recent doctoral graduates invest in further training. In the analysis, we grouped the junior 
21:471:34338:28:27:89:516:515:144:Times:144:Times:postdocs with students into one category to indicate their ‘trainee’ status and distinguish 
21:472:34430:27:28:89:480:488:144:Times:144:Times:them from experienced postdocs. The sample composition introduces a temporal 
21:473:34507:28:27:89:497:460:144:Times:144:Times:dimension to the data needed for understanding how accumulated experience affects 
21:474:34588:27:28:89:469:433:144:Times:144:Times:psychological contracts. The time perspective was also facilitated by using the 
21:475:34668:28:28:89:501:405:144:Times:144:Times:retrospective accounts of the individuals’ career histories, and subsequent tracking of 
21:476:34756:28:27:89:511:377:144:Times:144:Times:their career moves based on web searches. The interviews were conducted during 2006-
21:477:34840:27:28:89:406:350:144:Times:144:Times:07 and we tracked the careers of the young scientists until 2012.   
21:478:34907:28:27:89:518:322:144:Times:144:Times: Although we modified the interview questions during the course of data collection to 
21:479:34992:27:28:89:511:295:144:Times:144:Times:take advantage of emerging themes, each interview covered a set of common questions 
21:480:35075:28:28:89:465:267:144:Times:144:Times:on the following areas: training experience and career history, work roles and 
21:481:35154:28:27:89:516:239:144:Times:144:Times:relationships, involvement in their professors’ research and industrial activities, learning 
21:482:35247:27:28:89:490:212:144:Times:144:Times:experience, work motivation, career expectations and preferences (before and after 
21:483:35330:28:27:89:489:184:144:Times:144:Times:doctoral training, and at the time of the interview), perceived mentoring and career 
21:484:35415:27:28:89:525:157:144:Times:144:Times:support;  perceived future prospects and career development activities.  For the interviews 
21:485:35507:28:28:89:506:129:144:Times:144:Times:with the professors we asked about their industrial activities, funding sponsorships for 
21:486:35596:28:0:89:516:101:144:Times:144:Times:students/ postdocs, the role of these young scientists in their laboratories, and evaluation 
22:487:35692:0:28:89:506:709:144:Times:144:Times:of the influence of industrial engagement on their role as mentors/supervisors.3 T hree-
22:488:35780:28:27:89:498:681:144:Times:144:Times:quarters of the interviews were conducted jointly by the authors, one of whom was a 
22:489:35864:27:28:89:500:654:144:Times:144:Times:professor and the other, a doctoral research assistant at the time. The presence of two 
22:490:35952:28:28:89:496:626:144:Times:144:Times:researchers in different roles should minimize possible bias in data collection.  Each 
22:491:36039:28:27:89:519:598:144:Times:144:Times:interview lasted for about 60-90 minutes and all were recorded and transcribed verbatim. 
22:492:36127:27:28:89:487:571:144:Times:144:Times: Table 1 shows the profiles of the 24 students/postdocs and their corresponding 
22:493:36206:28:28:89:152:543:144:Times:144:Times:professors.

22:496:36238:28:27:89:159:460:144:Times:144:Times:Data analysis 
22:497:36251:27:28:89:510:433:144:Times:144:Times:The analysis was guided by the broad framework derived from the literature but firmly 
22:498:36337:28:28:89:503:405:144:Times:144:Times:rooted in the grounded theory tradition that involves analytic induction and deduction 
22:499:36424:28:27:89:508:377:144:Times:144:Times:(Strauss and Corbin, 1998). We went through three main stages of iteration by moving 
22:500:36509:27:28:89:505:350:144:Times:144:Times:back and forth between the data and concepts ( Eisenhardt, 1989).   First, we used open 
22:501:36597:28:27:89:480:322:144:Times:144:Times:coding to develop first order codes and provisional categories. We used a coding 
22:502:36678:27:28:89:514:295:144:Times:144:Times:summary sheet for each respondent to record their views and responses. It became clear 
22:503:36765:28:28:89:509:267:144:Times:144:Times:early on that there were significant differences between the experiences of t he   young 
22:504:36854:28:27:89:484:239:144:Times:144:Times:scientists engaged in collaborative research and commercial ventures. The former 
22:505:36935:27:28:89:481:212:144:Times:144:Times:generally reported positive relationships with their professors,  whereas the latter 
22:506:37020:28:27:89:503:184:144:Times:144:Times:experienced tension. It was also notable that the differences became more apparent as 
22:507:37106:27:28:89:449:157:144:Times:144:Times:respondents progressed from students/junior postdocs to senior postdocs.   
22:508:37181:28:28:109:523:129:144:Times:144:Times:In the second stage, we conducted more systematic comparisons of the two groups by 
22:509:37264:28:0:89:517:101:144:Times:144:Times:returning to the transcriptions and the literature. When analysing their relationships with 
23:510:37359:0:28:89:496:709:144:Times:144:Times:the professors, where possible we adopted a dyadic perspective by incorporating the 
23:511:37442:28:27:89:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:views of the professors. We extracted all the interview quotes relating to the attitudes and 
23:512:37535:27:28:89:512:654:144:Times:144:Times:feelings of both parties towards each other, and any incidents or events that appeared to 
23:513:37625:28:28:89:510:626:144:Times:144:Times:have influenced their perceptions of the relationships. We inferred the properties of the 
23:514:37715:28:27:89:481:598:144:Times:144:Times:exchange relationships based on the assessments of both parties, and those of the 
23:515:37797:27:28:89:507:571:144:Times:144:Times:psychological contracts based on the perceptions of the young scientists. This analysis 
23:516:37885:28:28:89:505:543:144:Times:144:Times:allowed us to detect the variation in the psychological contracts and career behaviours 
23:517:37973:28:27:89:523:515:144:Times:144:Times:between the young scientists involved in the two types o f exchange. Two distinct patterns 
23:518:38064:27:28:89:463:488:144:Times:144:Times:emerged: those involved in collaborative research continued to invest in their 
23:519:38142:28:27:89:496:460:144:Times:144:Times:relationships with the professors despite the uncertainties, whereas those engaged in 
23:520:38228:27:28:89:495:433:144:Times:144:Times:commercial ventures showed a desire to exit the relationship and proactively sought 
23:521:38312:28:28:89:500:405:144:Times:144:Times:career opportunities outside academia. At this point, we returned to the literature and 
23:522:38400:28:27:89:523:377:144:Times:144:Times:looked for relevant concepts to capture the divergent career behaviours. We used the term 
23:523:38490:27:28:89:494:350:144:Times:144:Times:‘extended investment’ ( van Dam, 2005) to describe the former and ‘career crafting’ 
23:524:38573:28:27:89:487:322:144:Times:144:Times:(Wrzesniewski and Dutton, 2001) to describe the latter. We returned to the data to 
23:525:38656:27:28:89:519:295:144:Times:144:Times:identify the key factors and relational processes that were connected to these two distinct 
23:526:38748:28:28:89:516:267:144:Times:144:Times:patterns of agentic behaviour. We extracted the relevant evidence and quotes illustrating 
23:527:38838:28:27:89:473:239:144:Times:144:Times:career agency and matched them with the three constituent elements: objective, 
23:528:38917:27:28:89:218:212:144:Times:144:Times:subjective and projective.  
23:529:38945:28:27:109:500:184:144:Times:144:Times:  In the final stage, through writing draft versions and revisiting the literature, we 
23:530:39032:27:28:89:494:157:144:Times:144:Times:refined our understanding of the connections between the conceptual categories and 
23:531:39115:28:28:89:524:129:144:Times:144:Times:developed a model to explain the relationships between forms of exchange, psychological 
23:532:39203:28:0:89:494:101:144:Times:144:Times:contracts and career agency. For example, the model suggests that diffuse exchange 
24:533:39288:0:28:89:499:709:144:Times:144:Times:engenders a relational psychological contract and encourages proxy agency, whereas 
24:534:39371:28:27:89:509:681:144:Times:144:Times:restricted exchange creates a transactional psychological contract and induces personal 
24:535:39459:27:28:89:502:654:144:Times:144:Times:agency. Once we had identified this pattern, we re-examined the data to check for the 
24:536:39545:28:28:89:320:626:144:Times:144:Times:accuracy and consistency of our interpretation.  
24:537:39594:28:27:109:505:598:144:Times:144:Times:In what follows, we present the two main findings. First, we discuss the divergent 
24:538:39677:27:28:89:498:571:144:Times:144:Times:patterns of relationships and show how the young scientists’ psychological contracts 
24:539:39762:28:28:89:486:543:144:Times:144:Times:evolve over time. Second, we look at how the two groups enact career agency and 
24:540:39842:28:27:89:490:515:144:Times:144:Times:respond to unmet expectations by taking two different courses of action: ‘extended 
24:541:39925:27:28:89:269:488:144:Times:144:Times:investment’ versus ‘career crafting’.

24:544:40033:27:28:89:405:405:144:Times:144:Times:Relationships with professors and the psychological contract  
24:545:40095:28:27:89:512:377:144:Times:144:Times:For analytical purposes, we classify the young scientists into four categories labelled as 
24:546:40185:27:28:89:513:350:144:Times:144:Times:‘learner’, ‘worker’, ‘extended’ and ‘runaway’ apprentices.4 This categorization is based 
24:547:40274:28:27:89:508:322:144:Times:144:Times:on two dimensions: mode of industrial engagement (collaborative vs. commercial) and 
24:548:40358:27:28:89:498:295:144:Times:144:Times:career stage (students/junior postdocs in training vs. senior postdocs in employment) 
24:549:40443:28:27:89:516:267:144:Times:144:Times:(Figure 1). The terms ‘learner’ and ‘ worker’ are used to indicate the relative dominance, 
24:550:40534:27:28:89:482:240:144:Times:144:Times:respectively, of scientific research and commercial work in the training and early 
24:551:40617:28:28:89:495:212:144:Times:144:Times:socialization of students/junior postdocs.  The ‘learner apprentices’ (8 cases) are the 
24:552:40705:28:27:89:514:184:144:Times:144:Times:students/junior postdocs involved in collaborative research which forms an integral part 
24:553:40794:27:28:89:498:157:144:Times:144:Times:of their scientific training. The ‘worker apprentices’ (5 cases) are those who conduct 
24:554:40880:28:27:89:499:129:144:Times:144:Times:research in their professors’ commercial laboratories that may or may not be directly 
24:555:40966:27:0:89:480:102:144:Times:144:Times:related to their scientific training. The term ‘worker’ denotes the prioritization of 
25:556:41055:0:28:89:501:709:144:Times:144:Times:commercial work over scientific training.5 For the senior postdocs, we use the l abels 
25:557:41142:28:27:89:512:681:144:Times:144:Times:‘extended’ and ‘runaways’ to represent whether they are seeking to remain in academic 
25:558:41228:27:28:89:523:654:144:Times:144:Times:employment or not. The ‘extended apprentices’ (7 cases) are the senior postdocs involved 
25:559:41317:28:28:89:493:626:144:Times:144:Times:in collaborative research well beyond their initial training but who displayed strong 
25:560:41402:28:27:89:516:598:144:Times:144:Times:commitment to their jobs and relationships. The ‘runaway apprentices’ (4 cases) refer to 
25:561:41491:27:28:89:496:571:144:Times:144:Times:those involved in commercial activities who experienced considerable strain in their 
25:562:41576:28:28:89:442:543:144:Times:144:Times:relationships with the professors and subsequently sought to break away. 
25:563:41648:28:27:109:498:515:144:Times:144:Times:The analysis shows that those engaged in collaborative research held a ‘nascent’ 
25:564:41729:27:28:89:515:488:144:Times:144:Times:relational psychological contract while they were ‘learner apprentices’ which developed 
25:565:41817:28:27:89:521:460:144:Times:144:Times:over time into a ‘strong’ one experienced by the ‘extended apprentices’ who continued to 
25:566:41906:27:28:89:522:433:144:Times:144:Times:cooperate with their professors in the face of career uncertainty.  By contrast, the ‘worker 
25:567:41999:28:28:89:476:405:144:Times:144:Times:apprentice’ involved in commercial activities showed an emerging quid pro quo 
25:568:42077:28:27:89:500:377:144:Times:144:Times:mentality; the transactional tone of the psychological contract became more apparent 
25:569:42162:27:28:89:522:350:144:Times:144:Times:among the ‘runaways’ who sought independence by exploring alternative career options.

25:574:42356:27:28:89:132:212:144:Times:144:Times:contract 
25:575:42364:28:27:89:492:184:144:Times:144:Times:The relationship between the learner apprentices and their professors resembles the 
25:576:42448:27:28:89:518:157:144:Times:144:Times:traditional ‘master-apprentice’ model of reciprocal exchange where flows of knowledge, 
25:577:42535:28:28:89:524:129:144:Times:144:Times:provision of funding and socio-emotional support create a social bond between them. The 
25:578:42623:28:0:89:514:101:144:Times:144:Times:interviews suggest that professors with extensive industrial links were often regarded as 
26:579:42716:0:28:89:521:709:144:Times:144:Times:‘strong mentors’. Their laboratories were usually well-funded and they were in a position 
26:580:42806:28:27:89:505:681:144:Times:144:Times:to provide collaborative opportunities to the learner apprentices who reported positive 
26:581:42893:27:28:89:503:654:144:Times:144:Times:learning experiences and mentoring support.  For example, a recent doctoral graduate 
26:582:42978:28:28:89:509:626:144:Times:144:Times:described his professor as ‘very supportive and at the same time honest and guiding... ’ 
26:583:43067:28:27:89:515:598:144:Times:144:Times:(case 5).  Another saw his professor’s reputation and contacts as important assets for his 
26:584:43158:27:28:89:156:571:144:Times:144:Times:future career: 
26:585:43173:28:28:109:112:543:144:Times:144:Times: 
26:586:43173:28:27:109:480:515:144:Times:144:Times:‘I think Prof X is a very effective academic... He has been extremely good at 
26:587:43251:27:28:109:509:488:144:Times:144:Times:producing opportunities for me, first of all he has been very good at getting me the 
26:588:43336:28:27:109:502:460:144:Times:144:Times:money to do this PhD. And he has got me involved with this project work... who 
26:589:43415:27:28:109:521:433:144:Times:144:Times:knows he might create more opportunities for me in the future in terms of helping me 
26:590:43500:28:28:109:448:405:144:Times:144:Times:to secure a permanent position on my PhD’ (case 3; emphasis added). 
26:591:43567:28:27:89:92:377:144:Times:144:Times: 
26:592:43567:27:28:89:487:350:144:Times:144:Times:Although the ‘learner apprentices’ are the dependent partners, they are not passive 
26:593:43651:28:27:89:511:322:144:Times:144:Times:recipients of mentoring support.  They provide research assistance in return and help in 
26:594:43740:27:28:89:484:295:144:Times:144:Times:networking with firms.  One of the professors (D) described the links between his 
26:595:43822:28:28:89:511:267:144:Times:144:Times:doctoral students and industrial networks as a kind of ‘food chain’ because many of his 
26:596:43910:28:27:89:511:239:144:Times:144:Times:industrial contacts were his former students. Another stressed the importance of having 
26:597:43998:27:28:89:522:212:144:Times:144:Times:‘good relations’ with his students/researchers and getting them ‘good jobs’ for the benefit 
26:598:44090:28:27:89:468:184:144:Times:144:Times:of future collaboration (Professor B).  Thus, in the truest sense of an exchange 
26:599:44171:27:28:89:512:157:144:Times:144:Times:relationship, both parties are dependent on each other for valued resources and support. 
26:600:44260:28:28:89:501:129:144:Times:144:Times:This anticipation of future contributions and fulfilment of obligations building on the 
26:601:44348:28:0:89:431:101:144:Times:144:Times:norm of reciprocity is indicative of a relational psychological contract. 
27:602:44424:0:28:109:510:709:144:Times:144:Times:For those who aspired to an academic career and continued as postdocs beyond the 
27:603:44505:28:27:89:477:681:144:Times:144:Times:transitional phase, the relationship with their professors evolved from reciprocal 
27:604:44588:27:28:89:511:654:144:Times:144:Times:dependence to reciprocal inter-dependence as they took on more laboratory duties. The 
27:605:44674:28:28:89:521:626:144:Times:144:Times:seven extended apprentices interviewed had been involved in long-standing collaborative 
27:606:44762:28:27:89:516:598:144:Times:144:Times:research with their professors and reported having trusting relationships. Over the years, 
27:607:44853:27:28:89:523:571:144:Times:144:Times:the scope of their responsibility expanded from scientific laboratory work to cover a wide 
27:608:44944:28:28:89:490:543:144:Times:144:Times:range of technical (e.g. grant writing and supervision of doctoral students) and non-
27:609:45029:28:27:89:520:515:144:Times:144:Times:technical support tasks (e.g. laboratory administration). They were compliant and willing 
27:610:45119:27:28:89:515:488:144:Times:144:Times:to go an extra-mile to help their professors and worked flexibly across different projects 
27:611:45210:28:27:89:514:460:144:Times:144:Times:in return for collaborative opportunities and career support. For example, two who were 
27:612:45298:27:28:89:479:433:144:Times:144:Times:publicly funded quite happily provided ‘free labour’ to work on their professors’ 
27:613:45380:28:28:89:474:405:144:Times:144:Times:industrial projects. One stressed the ‘symbiotic relationship’ with his professor: 
27:614:45462:28:27:109:112:377:144:Times:144:Times: 
27:615:45462:27:28:112:510:350:144:Times:144:Times:‘I realised that, you know, he would be instrumental in allowing me that chance to 
27:616:45545:28:27:109:522:322:144:Times:144:Times:develop so I’ve never felt restricted in any of my research whilst I’ve been doing it... 
27:617:45634:27:28:109:513:295:144:Times:144:Times:I have a commitment to make sure I deliver on what we need to do, you know. And 
27:618:45714:28:28:109:507:267:144:Times:144:Times:to be absolutely honest you often, hopefully, deliver far more than you’re asked to 
27:619:45798:28:27:109:190:239:144:Times:144:Times:do...’ (case 15). 
27:620:45815:27:28:109:112:212:144:Times:144:Times: 
27:621:45815:28:27:89:520:184:144:Times:144:Times:Another described himself as the ‘pseudo principal investigator’. He wrote the proposals, 
27:622:45905:27:28:89:524:157:144:Times:144:Times:supervised the doctoral students and wrote the reports while the professor remained as the 
27:623:45996:28:28:89:481:129:144:Times:144:Times:formal principal investigator.  He reckoned this was ‘quite good training because 
27:624:46078:28:0:89:484:101:144:Times:144:Times:hopefully in the not too distant future I’ll be in a position of my own...’ (case 14). 
28:625:46167:0:28:109:494:709:144:Times:144:Times:The professors also recognised the value of these experienced postdocs and had 
28:626:46246:28:27:89:502:681:144:Times:144:Times:strong incentives to retain them. The following remark is illustrative: ‘They know the 
28:627:46333:27:28:89:519:654:144:Times:144:Times:work and they know the system. They are experts. And the temptation is to try and retain 
28:628:46422:28:28:89:496:626:144:Times:144:Times:them’ (Professor H).  Although some expressed concern about the lack of long-term 
28:629:46504:28:27:89:511:598:144:Times:144:Times:career prospects for the postdocs, many also felt obliged to get more grants to maintain 
28:630:46593:27:28:89:501:571:144:Times:144:Times:the staff in their labs. In line with Blau’s (1964) social exchange theory, the evidence 
28:631:46682:28:28:89:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:suggests that both parties strived to create a positive balance in the exchange by engaging 
28:632:46774:28:27:89:471:515:144:Times:144:Times:in a cycle of conferring benefits on each other. This leads   to increased mutual 
28:633:46856:27:28:89:508:488:144:Times:144:Times:dependency and further strengthens the extended apprentices’ psychological contracts. 
28:634:46942:28:27:89:513:460:144:Times:144:Times:One, for example, commented on the mutuality of the relationship: ‘I was happy to stay 
28:635:47029:27:28:89:522:433:144:Times:144:Times:and they were keen to keep me so...’ (case 15).  Another said, ‘He wouldn’t look after me 
28:636:47119:28:28:89:506:405:144:Times:144:Times:if I wasn’t worth being looked after. So it is a mutual thing...’ (case 20). The professor 
28:637:47210:28:27:89:456:377:144:Times:144:Times:(A) who employed this researcher described him as ‘absolutely invaluable’. 
28:638:47284:27:28:109:498:350:144:Times:144:Times:However, the extended apprentices expressed pessimism about the possibility of 
28:639:47363:28:27:89:516:322:144:Times:144:Times:securing a permanent position, unlike the optimistic learner apprentices. Several pointed 
28:640:47453:27:28:89:506:295:144:Times:144:Times:out that the short-duration of employment contracts and fragmented nature of research 
28:641:47539:28:28:89:493:267:144:Times:144:Times:had made it difficult for them to build up their own research profiles. Some felt that 
28:642:47626:28:27:89:513:239:144:Times:144:Times:prolonged postdoctoral employment had significantly reduced their chance of obtaining 
28:643:47712:27:28:89:463:212:144:Times:144:Times:permanent positions and closed alternative options. A sense of insecurity and 
28:644:47790:28:27:89:524:184:144:Times:144:Times:disappointment permeated the interviews. One lamented: ‘... there are no guarantees, each 
28:645:47880:27:28:89:520:157:144:Times:144:Times:time you keep wondering why you’re doing it because of that uncertainty, so I think I am 
28:646:47969:28:28:89:500:129:144:Times:144:Times:getting too old to carry on being somebody else’s research postdoc...’ (case 15). This 
28:647:48056:28:0:89:506:101:144:Times:144:Times:sentiment is echoed by another: ‘I am not exactly sure how the future is going to go...’ 
29:648:48148:0:28:89:502:709:144:Times:144:Times:(case 14). Some in their late careers concluded that they were unlikely to realize their 
29:649:48237:28:27:89:516:681:144:Times:144:Times:intended career goals but took comfort from being able to remain in academia (cases 16, 
29:650:48324:27:28:89:150:654:144:Times:144:Times:17 and 19).  
29:651:48337:28:28:109:499:626:144:Times:144:Times:The extended apprentices appear to have become trapped in perennial temporary 
29:652:48415:28:27:89:483:598:144:Times:144:Times:employment. However, they remained committed to an academic career and their 
29:653:48492:27:28:89:510:571:144:Times:144:Times:intrinsic interest in research did not seem to have diminished over time. Many reported 
29:654:48580:28:28:89:521:543:144:Times:144:Times:high job satisfaction.  Case 14 quoted above said, ‘I love my job. I enjoy being here and I 
29:655:48672:28:27:89:516:515:144:Times:144:Times:think it is a good lab’. Case 15 expressed his commitment to the university and affective 
29:656:48762:27:28:89:513:488:144:Times:144:Times:regard for his professor: ‘I’d be happy to commit my sort of medium term to University 
29:657:48849:28:27:89:523:460:144:Times:144:Times:X ...because I’m excited by the work that I do, you know professor H is a great colleague, 
29:658:48940:27:28:89:510:433:144:Times:144:Times:a great collaborator...’.   These postdocs have clearly developed strong commitment to 
29:659:49027:28:28:89:503:405:144:Times:144:Times:their jobs and socio-emotional ties with their professors. Their work commitment and 
29:660:49112:28:27:89:456:377:144:Times:144:Times:perceived continuity of the relationships are indicative of a strong relational 
29:661:49192:27:28:89:210:350:144:Times:144:Times:psychological contract.

29:665:49317:28:27:89:523:239:144:Times:144:Times:Those engaged in commercial activities reported greater te nsions. Among the five worker 
29:666:49405:27:28:89:521:212:144:Times:144:Times:apprentices interviewed, two were doctoral students part-funded by their professors’ spin-
29:667:49495:28:27:89:524:184:144:Times:144:Times:off companies (cases 9 and 10). Others were paid wages as contract researchers (cases 12, 
29:668:49585:27:28:89:516:157:144:Times:144:Times:13) to conduct relevant research for their professors’ commercial projects.  One publicly 
29:669:49675:28:28:89:517:129:144:Times:144:Times:funded junior postdoc (case 11) worked alongside other privately funded researchers but 
29:670:49763:28:0:89:513:101:144:Times:144:Times:without any additional compensation. In all but one of the cases, the industrial sponsors 
30:671:49856:0:28:89:454:709:144:Times:144:Times:were the professors themselves who had dual roles as teachers/mentors and 
30:672:49930:28:27:89:254:681:144:Times:144:Times:managers/business entrepreneurs. 
30:673:49962:27:28:109:515:654:144:Times:144:Times:The ambiguous boundary between ‘academic’ and ‘commercial’ research generated 
30:674:50040:28:28:89:510:626:144:Times:144:Times:various conflicting obligations for the professors.   One commented on the complex role 
30:675:50127:28:27:89:506:598:144:Times:144:Times:relationships with his student with whom he had co-founded a company: ‘There was a 
30:676:50210:27:28:89:501:571:144:Times:144:Times:time in which he was both my Co-Director and an employee and a student, so I had a 
30:677:50293:28:28:89:518:543:144:Times:144:Times:relationship with him at all of those levels and had to be very careful about making quite 
30:678:50384:28:27:89:491:515:144:Times:144:Times:sure that that was dealt with appropriately...’ (Professor C). Others felt the overlap 
30:679:50471:27:28:89:502:488:144:Times:144:Times:between academic and commercial research was convenient for flexible utilization of 
30:680:50555:28:27:89:516:460:144:Times:144:Times:student researchers. For example, one professor who had employed a doctoral student to 
30:681:50642:27:28:89:517:433:144:Times:144:Times:provide part-time technical support in his company, joked about the fact that the amount 
30:682:50731:28:28:89:516:405:144:Times:144:Times:of time the student could be expected to spend on company activities could be ‘anything 
30:683:50819:28:27:89:410:377:144:Times:144:Times:between 0-100%’ because of the co-location of the two activities.  
30:684:50886:27:28:109:508:350:144:Times:144:Times:The interviews reveal ample evidence of what might be considered as ‘labour’ and 
30:685:50967:28:27:89:490:322:144:Times:144:Times:‘intellectual’ exploitation of junior researchers ( Slaughter et al., 2002). The worker 
30:686:51055:27:28:89:474:295:144:Times:144:Times:apprentices reported long working hours and having to perform a wide range of 
30:687:51133:28:28:89:514:267:144:Times:144:Times:additional support tasks (e.g. patent search, testing prototypes and IT support) related to 
30:688:51225:28:27:89:473:239:144:Times:144:Times:their professors’ commercial projects.  One expressed his discontent: ‘I worked 
30:689:51305:27:28:89:510:212:144:Times:144:Times:incredibly long hours and I used to run all the computers for them... I wasn’t paid to do 
30:690:51395:28:27:89:533:184:144:Times:144:Times:that at all’ (case 13). The classic problem of publication restriction was reported by all    the 
30:691:51493:27:28:89:524:157:144:Times:144:Times:interviewees who could not freely disseminate their research results until the patents were 
30:692:51585:28:28:89:489:129:144:Times:144:Times:issued. None of them had a share of patent ownership generated from the research. 
30:693:51667:28:0:89:516:101:144:Times:144:Times:Although patent ownership did not appear to be a major issue for them, they were aware 
31:694:51757:0:28:89:498:709:144:Times:144:Times:of the potential financial returns based on the collective research outputs. One junior 
31:695:51845:28:27:89:519:681:144:Times:144:Times:postdoc (case 11), for example, talked about the ‘dollars’ that the professors were getting 
31:696:51937:27:28:89:510:654:144:Times:144:Times:and was adamant that she was not offered any company shares despite the ‘extra work’ 
31:697:52022:28:28:89:505:626:144:Times:144:Times:that she had to do for the company. One doctoral student, who co-founded a company 
31:698:52105:28:27:89:523:598:144:Times:144:Times:with his doctoral supervisor and another professor, complained that the distribution of the 
31:699:52197:27:28:89:351:571:144:Times:144:Times:company shares did not fairly reflect his contribution: 
31:700:52252:28:28:109:112:543:144:Times:144:Times: 
31:701:52252:28:27:112:507:515:144:Times:144:Times:‘Now, as it turns out for years this equity style does not reflect equal involvement 
31:702:52337:27:28:109:515:488:144:Times:144:Times:with the company. Me, I am doing almost all of the work. Professor C contributed a 
31:703:52420:28:27:109:493:460:144:Times:144:Times:little bit but Professor Y was so busy with his other interests that he had time to 
31:704:52504:27:28:109:481:433:144:Times:144:Times:contribute with nothing. So I wouldn’t say that the structure is very equitable 
31:705:52584:28:28:109:211:405:144:Times:144:Times:anymore...’ (case 9). 
31:706:52606:28:27:109:112:377:144:Times:144:Times: 
31:707:52606:27:28:89:489:350:144:Times:144:Times:Perceived unequal exchange may prompt a more vigilant and transactional attitude 
31:708:52687:28:27:89:469:322:144:Times:144:Times:(Morrison and Robinson, 1997). There is evidence of a quid pro quo mentality 
31:709:52764:27:28:89:520:295:144:Times:144:Times:developing among the worker apprentices. The aforementioned doctoral student (case 9), 
31:710:52851:28:28:89:524:267:144:Times:144:Times:for example, negotiated for the position of ‘technical director’ in the co-founded company 
31:711:52942:28:27:89:518:239:144:Times:144:Times:in return for overseeing technological matters.  The junior postdoc (case 11), also quoted 
31:712:53033:27:28:89:491:212:144:Times:144:Times:above, subtly voiced her discontent by pointing out to the professors that it was not 
31:713:53119:28:27:89:510:184:144:Times:144:Times:within her contractual terms to work for the spin-off company. These incidents suggest 
31:714:53205:27:28:89:473:157:144:Times:144:Times:the tension lurking within the cooperative relationship. However, in an unequal 
31:715:53285:28:28:89:493:129:144:Times:144:Times:dependent relationship, the weaker actors cannot afford to adopt too tough a stance. 
31:716:53370:28:0:89:503:101:144:Times:144:Times:These young scientists may have displayed occasional discontent but were mindful to 
32:717:53457:0:28:89:504:709:144:Times:144:Times:avoid overt conflict. Moreover, it also appears that the perceived unfair exchange was 
32:718:53544:28:27:89:513:681:144:Times:144:Times:offset by the commercial learning opportunities. For example, the same student (case 9) 
32:719:53632:27:28:89:502:654:144:Times:144:Times:who complained about inequity in share distribution emphasised his positive learning 
32:720:53717:28:28:89:507:626:144:Times:144:Times:experience and believed that the commercial expertise and contacts acquired would be 
32:721:53802:28:27:89:507:598:144:Times:144:Times:instrumental for his future career:  ‘The experience and contacts are worth more in the 
32:722:53890:27:28:89:511:571:144:Times:144:Times:long term... You know as soon as you’re introduced to contacts, they are your contacts, 
32:723:53978:28:28:89:469:543:144:Times:144:Times:you can then use them to your own career’ (case 9). Thus, what may seem like 
32:724:54054:28:27:89:508:515:144:Times:144:Times:‘exploitation’ to an outsider could be seen as ‘investment’ for one’s own career future. 
32:725:54142:27:28:109:523:488:144:Times:144:Times:However, the senior postdocs in this category were far less upbeat, reporting growing 
32:726:54228:28:27:89:508:460:144:Times:144:Times:tensions in the relationships with the professors.  The perceived unequal exchange and 
32:727:54315:27:28:89:508:433:144:Times:144:Times:psychological contract breach ultimately triggered their desire to break away. The four 
32:728:54402:28:28:89:466:405:144:Times:144:Times:cases of ‘runaways’ interviewed had been closely engaged in their professors’ 
32:729:54480:28:27:89:517:377:144:Times:144:Times:commercial activities for a substantial period and emphasized the strong influence of the 
32:730:54570:27:28:89:505:350:144:Times:144:Times:professors on their research and career trajectories. For example, one recalled how his 
32:731:54658:28:27:89:513:322:144:Times:144:Times:doctoral proposal was ‘written up as a paragraph’ by his supervisor which subsequently 
32:732:54745:27:28:89:522:295:144:Times:144:Times:became a component of the research leading to a spin-off company (case 23). He went on 
32:733:54832:28:28:89:502:267:144:Times:144:Times:to explain, with a sense of resentment, how his supervisor ‘ persuaded’ him to take on 
32:734:54919:28:27:89:496:239:144:Times:144:Times:three successive postdoctoral contracts with a view that ‘I could make it through the 
32:735:55005:27:28:89:515:212:144:Times:144:Times:academic career path because I would be recognized for my input there’. Similar stories 
32:736:55093:28:27:89:503:184:144:Times:144:Times:were told by two other postdocs about how their careers had become intertwined with 
32:737:55177:27:28:89:503:157:144:Times:144:Times:their professors’ research and commercialization activities. Cases 21 and 22 followed 
32:738:55263:28:28:89:486:129:144:Times:144:Times:their professors’ job moves to the present universities for project and employment 
32:739:55346:28:0:89:147:101:144:Times:144:Times:continuity.  
33:740:55362:0:28:109:502:709:144:Times:144:Times: The interviews suggest that professors who were heavily engaged in commercial 
33:741:55441:28:27:89:510:681:144:Times:144:Times:activities relied on the experienced postdocs not only for resolving their ‘time squeeze’ 
33:742:55531:27:28:89:511:654:144:Times:144:Times:problem but also for risk sharing. Involvement in commercial ventures means less time 
33:743:55617:28:28:89:517:626:144:Times:144:Times:for academic research. Moreover, company formation is a high risk activity and some of 
33:744:55704:28:27:89:476:598:144:Times:144:Times:the professors sought to reduce personal risks by delegating the key commercial 
33:745:55784:27:28:89:508:571:144:Times:144:Times:responsibilities.  One of the professors, for instance, stated in the interview that he was 
33:746:55876:28:28:89:506:543:144:Times:144:Times:‘fighting not to be a director’ at the time when the company was set up because he felt 
33:747:55964:28:27:89:509:515:144:Times:144:Times:that he was ‘wearing two hats at all stages’ and ‘had too many responsibilities’ already 
33:748:56053:27:28:89:511:488:144:Times:144:Times:(Professor F).  In the end, the main coordinating role was taken up by the postdoc (case 
33:749:56142:28:27:89:500:460:144:Times:144:Times:23). The same applies to another postdoc (case 21) who was initially Chief Scientific 
33:750:56228:27:28:89:484:433:144:Times:144:Times:Officer and later took over as CEO of the company which he co-founded with his 
33:751:56307:28:28:89:509:405:144:Times:144:Times:professor. As these postdocs assumed more responsibilities and the interface with their 
33:752:56395:28:27:89:483:377:144:Times:144:Times:professors became dominated by commercial projects, the relationships took on a 
33:753:56475:27:28:89:224:350:144:Times:144:Times:stronger instrumental tone.  
33:754:56504:28:27:109:521:322:144:Times:144:Times:There is evidence of strengthening of the transactional elements among the postdocs’ 
33:755:56589:27:28:89:503:295:144:Times:144:Times:psychological contracts. This is manifest in growing vigilance about unfairness in the 
33:756:56676:28:28:89:516:267:144:Times:144:Times:exchange, equity sensitivity and greater outcome concerns with a sense of entitlement to 
33:757:56765:28:27:89:517:239:144:Times:144:Times:more benefits and repayment for their contributions (Morrison and Robinson 1997). The 
33:758:56851:27:28:89:490:212:144:Times:144:Times:interviews reveal three factors underlying these developments.  The first is that the 
33:759:56937:28:27:89:522:184:144:Times:144:Times:postdocs had become more ‘powerful’ employees and sought greater recognition for their 
33:760:57024:27:28:89:517:157:144:Times:144:Times:contributions as they acquired technical expertise and entrepreneurial acumen. The three 
33:761:57113:28:28:89:505:129:144:Times:144:Times:postdocs who remained in the relationships at the time of interview believed that their 
33:762:57201:28:0:89:503:101:144:Times:144:Times:contributions to the work of their professors far outweighed the benefits that they had 
34:763:57292:0:28:89:517:709:144:Times:144:Times:received. One expressed his acute awareness of the unequal exchange and the need to be 
34:764:57379:28:27:89:133:681:144:Times:144:Times:vigilant: 
34:765:57389:27:28:89:92:654:144:Times:144:Times: 
34:766:57389:28:28:112:516:626:144:Times:144:Times:‘You know he has benefited more from me than I have from him, Definitely...Well 
34:767:57469:28:27:109:521:598:144:Times:144:Times:he has got two strands to his research group, bio-responsive polymers and everything 
34:768:57554:27:28:109:518:571:144:Times:144:Times:else, and the bio-responsive polymers count for over half of his research but done by 
34:769:57640:28:28:109:522:543:144:Times:144:Times:me. And one of the reasons that I was looking to get out of university...I mean this is 
34:770:57728:28:27:109:464:515:144:Times:144:Times:true I would say of every postdoc that they have been undervalued, under 
34:771:57801:27:28:109:510:488:144:Times:144:Times:appreciated, certainly underpaid... if you are not very careful about it then you end 
34:772:57887:28:27:109:240:460:144:Times:144:Times:up losing out...’ (case 21). 
34:773:57915:27:28:112:115:433:144:Times:144:Times: 
34:774:57915:28:28:89:517:405:144:Times:144:Times: Another talked about the competitive tension in the relationship with his professor as he 
34:775:58006:28:27:89:253:377:144:Times:144:Times:sought a more equal partnership:  
34:776:58040:27:28:89:92:350:144:Times:144:Times: 
34:777:58040:28:27:109:524:322:144:Times:144:Times:‘I think he had a vision of me as being somebody whose role was to provide him with 
34:778:58124:27:28:109:524:295:144:Times:144:Times:support... But I got to the point where I wanted to stand on my own two feet...to have 
34:779:58211:28:28:109:496:267:144:Times:144:Times:my own networks and grant writing, and he found that very, very difficult... He 
34:780:58291:28:27:109:508:239:144:Times:144:Times:wanted to keep me as a support and I wanted to build myself up and build my own 
34:781:58371:27:28:109:206:212:144:Times:144:Times:pyramid’ (case 22). 
34:782:58390:28:27:89:92:184:144:Times:144:Times: 
34:783:58390:27:28:89:505:157:144:Times:144:Times:A second factor underlying an instrumental turn in the relationship is the frequency of 
34:784:58478:28:28:89:502:129:144:Times:144:Times:disputes over the share of financial rewards. For example, case 21 whose relationship 
34:785:58564:28:0:89:515:101:144:Times:144:Times:with his professors was clearly under great strain, described an incident which led to the 
35:786:58658:0:28:89:300:709:144:Times:144:Times:dramatic deterioration of their relationship: 
35:787:58703:28:27:89:92:681:144:Times:144:Times: 
35:788:58703:27:28:89:525:654:144:Times:144:Times: ‘He is a user basically ... Well yes, and he thinks he is doing you favours... But 
35:789:58786:28:28:125:527:626:144:Times:144:Times:on  the  other  side  on  the  consultancy  work  that  we  do  with  Company  X  for  
35:790:58873:28:27:125:525:598:144:Times:144:Times:example,  you  know  the  amount  of  money  that  he  actually  pays  me  compared  to 
35:791:58960:27:28:125:527:571:144:Times:144:Times:what  we  are  actually  getting  for  the  contract  it  just  –  you  know  it  is  totally  
35:792:59055:28:28:125:525:543:144:Times:144:Times:opposite to that...It was a good relationship up until the Company X situation and 
35:793:59138:28:27:125:525:515:144:Times:144:Times:then he basically ripped me off big time and that really probably destroyed eight 
35:794:59220:27:28:125:361:488:144:Times:144:Times:years of a good relationship’ (emphasis added).  
35:795:59269:28:27:89:92:460:144:Times:144:Times: 
35:796:59269:27:28:89:523:433:144:Times:144:Times:Finally, the realisation that the academic career path might be closed to them further fuels 
35:797:59362:28:28:89:519:405:144:Times:144:Times:the tension. Commercial engagement can easily jeopardize the academic career of young 
35:798:59448:28:27:89:498:377:144:Times:144:Times:scientists by diverting their time away from scientific research and also dampen peer 
35:799:59534:27:28:89:521:350:144:Times:144:Times:learning. Overtime, these postdocs perceived continued association with their professors’ 
35:800:59624:28:27:89:492:322:144:Times:144:Times:commercial activities to incur high opportunity and investment costs, and sought to 
35:801:59708:27:28:89:514:295:144:Times:144:Times:redefine their roles. Having worked hard on their professors’ projects and compromised 
35:802:59795:28:28:89:522:267:144:Times:144:Times:their own research, the realisation that their contributions might not be rewarded in career 
35:803:59888:28:27:89:522:239:144:Times:144:Times:terms aroused feelings of injustice and betrayal: ‘There has been very little interest in this 
35:804:59983:27:28:89:503:212:144:Times:144:Times:department in terms of advancing my career. In fact there is none. They have actively 
35:805:60069:28:27:89:495:184:144:Times:144:Times:blocked it...’ (case 21). This quote is indicative of the emotion of anger and outrage 
35:806:60156:27:28:89:484:157:144:Times:144:Times:associated with psychological contract violation ( Morrison and Robinson 1997).  
35:807:60237:28:28:109:474:129:144:Times:144:Times:Psychological contract theory suggests that individuals within transactional 
35:808:60314:28:0:89:505:101:144:Times:144:Times:relationships are more likely to perceive unmet expectations as psychological contract 
36:809:60404:0:28:89:501:709:144:Times:144:Times:violation, which involves not only attitudinal reactions but also a readiness for action 
36:810:60492:28:27:89:521:681:144:Times:144:Times:(Morrison and Robinson 1997).  Postdocs who believed that their professors had failed to 
36:811:60581:27:28:89:521:654:144:Times:144:Times:meet their obligations and found the option of an academic career closed sought remedial 
36:812:60670:28:28:89:501:626:144:Times:144:Times:action. At the time of the study, one postdoc had gained independence by obtaining a 
36:813:60755:28:27:89:513:598:144:Times:144:Times:five-year personal fellowship (case 24), and the three who remained in the relationships 
36:814:60844:27:28:89:514:571:144:Times:144:Times:were planning their ‘escape routes’. One declared that he no longer wanted an academic 
36:815:60931:28:28:89:484:543:144:Times:144:Times:career and channelled his effort into the spin-off company as an avenue for future 
36:816:61014:28:27:89:497:515:144:Times:144:Times:employment (case 21). Another actively pursued consultancy to build his ‘portfolio’ 
36:817:61097:27:28:89:479:488:144:Times:144:Times:career (case 22).  The third postdoc (case 23) negotiated a ‘special deal’ with his 
36:818:61181:28:27:89:509:460:144:Times:144:Times:department enabling him to be on half-time secondment to the spin-off company while 
36:819:61265:27:28:89:515:433:144:Times:144:Times:retaining his research position. These examples illustrate the active role of the runaways 
36:820:61356:28:28:89:289:405:144:Times:144:Times:in career-shaping and gaining autonomy.

36:822:61395:27:28:89:488:350:144:Times:144:Times:Unmet expectations and career agency: ‘Extended investment’ versus ‘career 
36:823:61470:28:27:89:137:322:144:Times:144:Times:crafting’ 
36:824:61479:27:28:89:500:295:144:Times:144:Times:The contrast between young scientists engaged in collaborative research and those in 
36:825:61564:28:28:89:471:267:144:Times:144:Times:commercial ventures is striking. Both experienced the frustration of unfulfilled 
36:826:61645:28:27:89:478:239:144:Times:144:Times:expectations but each responded differently. The extended apprentices remained 
36:827:61724:27:28:89:487:212:144:Times:144:Times:committed to an academic career and continued to invest in their existing jobs and 
36:828:61807:28:27:89:512:184:144:Times:144:Times:relationships.  We adapt Van Dam’s (2005) concept of ‘extended investment’ to denote 
36:829:61892:27:28:89:515:157:144:Times:144:Times:their affective and continuance commitment to present jobs and heavy investment in the 
36:830:61979:28:28:89:522:129:144:Times:144:Times:relationships with their professors in order to oblige them to reciprocate.  By contrast, the 
36:831:62073:28:0:89:500:101:144:Times:144:Times:runaways’ desire to pursue an academic career diminished over time and they sought 
37:832:62159:0:28:89:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:independence by exploring alternative options.  We use the concept of ‘career crafting’ to 
37:833:62250:28:27:89:514:681:144:Times:144:Times:emphasize their proactive stance in redefining their work and preparing for eventual job 
37:834:62339:27:28:89:514:654:144:Times:144:Times:mobility. It builds on job crafting (Wrzesniewski and Dutton, 2001) and role innovation 
37:835:62427:28:28:89:472:626:144:Times:144:Times:(Nicholson, 1984) theories which view employees as active agents who initiate 
37:836:62504:28:27:89:456:598:144:Times:144:Times:improvements in their work situations to create new career opportunities.     
37:837:62582:27:28:109:524:571:144:Times:144:Times:Both courses of action entail career agency albeit in different ways. We argue that the 
37:838:62670:28:28:89:512:543:144:Times:144:Times:divergent exchange relationships with their professors and the associated psychological 
37:839:62758:28:27:89:514:515:144:Times:144:Times:contracts influence the young scientists’ agentic orientations and career actions. Diffuse 
37:840:62849:27:28:89:498:488:144:Times:144:Times:exchange in collaborative research engenders a relational psychological contract and 
37:841:62934:28:27:89:512:460:144:Times:144:Times:encourages ‘proxy’ agency,  whereas restricted exchange in commercialization fosters a 
37:842:63021:27:28:89:509:433:144:Times:144:Times:transactional contract and induces ‘personal’ agency. Whereas the former is associated 
37:843:63108:28:28:89:497:405:144:Times:144:Times:with internally-oriented career self-management, the latter is related to an externally-
37:844:63196:28:27:89:514:377:144:Times:144:Times:oriented one. The actions of the two groups also display different temporal orientations: 
37:845:63286:27:28:89:519:350:144:Times:144:Times:the extended apprentices focused on the continuity of the present,  whereas the runaways 
37:846:63375:28:27:89:483:322:144:Times:144:Times:sought to create future opportunities. The two distinct patterns are manifest in the 
37:847:63460:27:28:89:472:295:144:Times:144:Times:objective, subjective and projective dimensions of the young scientists’ agentic 
37:848:63540:28:28:89:228:267:144:Times:144:Times:orientations and behaviours.

37:851:63631:28:27:89:514:184:144:Times:144:Times:The extent to which individuals are embedded in networks of social relations influences 
37:852:63719:27:28:89:501:157:144:Times:144:Times:their strategies for mobilizing relational or personal resources for problem adaptation 
37:853:63807:28:28:89:503:129:144:Times:144:Times:(Uehara, 1990). Young scientists engaged in collaborative research were more deeply 
37:854:63891:28:0:89:490:101:144:Times:144:Times:embedded in reciprocal exchange with their professors than were those involved in 
38:855:63976:0:28:89:506:709:144:Times:144:Times:commercialization, and thus the two categories drew on different types of resources to 
38:856:64063:28:27:89:224:681:144:Times:144:Times:ameliorate career barriers.   
38:857:64093:27:28:109:477:654:144:Times:144:Times:The extended apprentices used an influencing strategy in order to garner the 
38:858:64170:28:28:89:513:626:144:Times:144:Times:relational resources for ensuring career security. They stressed the importance of ‘being 
38:859:64260:28:27:89:512:598:144:Times:144:Times:cooperative’, having a ‘symbiotic relationship’ with their professors and the ‘support of 
38:860:64350:27:28:89:475:571:144:Times:144:Times:peers’ in order to advance their academic careers.  Influence behaviours such as 
38:861:64431:28:28:89:509:543:144:Times:144:Times:ingratiation or organizational citizenship behaviour are proactive tactics used by career 
38:862:64521:28:27:89:497:515:144:Times:144:Times:aspirants to influence a particular other in order to gain approbation and enhance the 
38:863:64608:27:28:89:505:488:144:Times:144:Times:probability of receiving desired rewards (Judge and Bretz Jr, 1994). Evidence of these 
38:864:64695:28:27:89:477:460:144:Times:144:Times:includes performing extra-duties and doing favours by taking over some of their 
38:865:64775:27:28:89:497:433:144:Times:144:Times:professors’ teaching and administrative duties. One commented in the interview that 
38:866:64859:28:28:89:523:405:144:Times:144:Times:these were considered ‘any other duties’ which was ‘not an obligation and you don’t have 
38:867:64948:28:27:89:492:377:144:Times:144:Times:to do it all’ but his professor ‘is a busy chap and so we’re contributing...’ (case 15). 
38:868:65037:27:28:89:476:350:144:Times:144:Times:Another said, ‘there are things I don’t want to do but I consider it within my job 
38:869:65120:28:27:89:505:322:144:Times:144:Times:description to do them so I get on and do it to the best of my ability as always...’ (case 
38:870:65211:27:28:89:511:295:144:Times:144:Times:14).  He also quickly pointed out, ‘  you know, it is promoting my career as well’. These 
38:871:65301:28:28:89:523:267:144:Times:144:Times:postdocs were willing to go the extra-mile and in some cases operated like ‘helpers’: ‘you 
38:872:65392:28:27:89:511:239:144:Times:144:Times:know, professor A says to me you sort that out and I will sort that out.... I’ll do bits and 
38:873:65485:27:28:89:521:212:144:Times:144:Times:pieces...’ (case 20).  By being exceptionally cooperative, they sought to induce a sense of 
38:874:65577:28:27:89:515:184:144:Times:144:Times:indebtedness on the part of the professors and also make themselves indispensable. This 
38:875:65664:27:28:89:519:157:144:Times:144:Times:supervisor-focused influence strategy is a form of ‘proxy’ agency whereby actors rely on 
38:876:65752:28:0:89:471:129:144:Times:144:Times:the reward power of significant others to secure their desired career outcomes.  
39:877:65836:0:28:109:504:709:144:Times:144:Times:In contrast, the runaways relied on personal resources by actively engaging in job 
39:878:65919:28:27:89:509:681:144:Times:144:Times:crafting and self-directed learning for enhancing their employability outside academia. 
39:879:66007:27:28:89:485:654:144:Times:144:Times:Although commercial engagement had constrained their scientific training, it also 
39:880:66089:28:28:89:522:626:144:Times:144:Times:provided them with opportunities to redefine their job boundaries  which can be used as a 
39:881:66179:28:27:89:505:598:144:Times:144:Times:means of acquiring new skills (Wrzesniewski and Dutton, 2001). Postdocs engaged in 
39:882:66262:27:28:89:521:571:144:Times:144:Times:commercial ventures experienced greater freedom in their day-to-day work and had more 
39:883:66348:28:28:89:466:543:144:Times:144:Times:opportunities for job crafting because they often worked outside the academic 
39:884:66426:28:27:89:478:515:144:Times:144:Times:laboratories. Some initiated role transitions by gradually reducing the amount of 
39:885:66508:27:28:89:515:488:144:Times:144:Times:laboratory research and allocating more time to supervisory tasks in order to acquire the 
39:886:66598:28:27:89:521:460:144:Times:144:Times:managerial expertise needed for commercial careers. Others negotiated for special hybrid 
39:887:66687:27:28:89:522:433:144:Times:144:Times:roles by combining research with commercial activities so as to keep future options open. 
39:888:66777:28:28:89:506:405:144:Times:144:Times:One, for example, recounted how he went about crafting his own job by establishing a 
39:889:66862:28:27:89:494:377:144:Times:144:Times:translational research unit linked to the start-up companies that he set up in parallel: 
39:890:66951:27:28:89:509:350:144:Times:144:Times:‘...you just write your own job description, just write exactly what you’d like to do and 
39:891:67041:28:27:89:519:322:144:Times:144:Times:then take it to somebody and convince them that they really want somebody like that ...’ 
39:892:67130:27:28:89:512:295:144:Times:144:Times:(case 24). Forming start-ups, which was i nitially used to offset employment insecurity,  
39:893:67220:28:28:89:487:267:144:Times:144:Times:had subsequently become the focus of sustained learning and career building. One 
39:894:67301:28:27:89:523:239:144:Times:144:Times:pointed out that he attended more business meetings than anyone else in the team because 
39:895:67390:27:28:89:510:212:144:Times:144:Times:it was his goal ‘to learn as much as possible during this very lucky period...’ (case 23).  
39:896:67482:28:27:89:489:184:144:Times:144:Times:Another exploited the ‘freedom’ of his commercial role to build extensive external 
39:897:67565:27:28:89:513:157:144:Times:144:Times:contacts and acquired an MBA qualification to enhance his mobility preparedness (case 
39:898:67651:28:28:89:517:129:144:Times:144:Times:21). These are examples of career positioning and mobility-oriented behaviours ( Fugate 
39:899:67739:28:0:89:497:101:144:Times:144:Times:et al., 2004), preparing the individuals to act on alternative career opportunities. The 
40:900:67831:0:28:89:463:709:144:Times:144:Times:runaways are ‘career crafters’ who displayed ‘personal agency’ and took self-
40:901:67908:28:27:89:307:681:144:Times:144:Times:responsibility to open up new opportunities.  
40:902:67954:27:28:89:92:654:144:Times:144:Times: 
40:903:67954:28:28:89:399:626:144:Times:144:Times:Subjective career agency: Internal versus external orientations  
40:904:68018:28:27:89:511:598:144:Times:144:Times:Individuals in both categories engaged in career self-management but the focus of their 
40:905:68106:27:28:89:510:571:144:Times:144:Times:actions differed.  The extended apprentices’ action was internally-focused,  whereas the 
40:906:68195:28:28:89:507:543:144:Times:144:Times:runaways’ was externally-oriented. Our analysis suggests that the divergent mentoring 
40:907:68281:28:27:89:493:515:144:Times:144:Times:relationships and socialization influence their career preferences and actions taken.  
40:908:68368:27:28:89:495:488:144:Times:144:Times:Young scientists’ academic career aspirations can be strengthened or weakened as a 
40:909:68451:28:27:89:497:460:144:Times:144:Times:result of early socialization.  Professors, as mentors and supervisors, are the primary 
40:910:68539:27:28:89:517:433:144:Times:144:Times:socialization agents who transmit scientific knowledge and professional values to young 
40:911:68627:28:28:89:501:405:144:Times:144:Times:scientists through role-modelling and integrating them into the academic community. 
40:912:68711:28:27:89:521:377:144:Times:144:Times:Young scientists involved in collaborative research developed strong scientific and social 
40:913:68802:27:28:89:514:350:144:Times:144:Times:bonds with their professors and academic peers,  and were exposed more fully to ‘global 
40:914:68890:28:27:89:498:322:144:Times:144:Times:role modelling’ (Gibson, 2004) and academic socialization.   In addition to scientific 
40:915:68977:27:28:89:500:295:144:Times:144:Times:knowledge, they acquired role expectations and academic ways of life which defined 
40:916:69060:28:28:89:503:267:144:Times:144:Times:their professional selves.  For example, one doctoral student commented: ‘I definitely 
40:917:69147:28:27:89:490:239:144:Times:144:Times:learned an awful lot about the way academics work and what you are expected and 
40:918:69227:27:28:89:488:212:144:Times:144:Times:required to do, to be a successful academic’ (case 3).  For those who progressed to 
40:919:69310:28:27:89:518:184:144:Times:144:Times:postdocs, their academic career orientation was strengthened. With the exception of case 
40:920:69399:27:28:89:497:157:144:Times:144:Times:20 who was a former industrial scientist, all the others aspired to an academic career 
40:921:69486:28:28:89:521:129:144:Times:144:Times:when they embarked on their doctoral studies and this remained unchanged at the time of 
40:922:69574:28:0:89:498:101:144:Times:144:Times:the interview. Despite career uncertainty, their intrinsic interest in scientific research 
41:923:69668:0:28:89:506:709:144:Times:144:Times:remained strong. For example, one said, ‘I have never seemed to have lost my interest 
41:924:69754:28:27:89:512:681:144:Times:144:Times:and motivation to do research’ (case 15).  Others stressed the ‘intellectual challenge’ of 
41:925:69844:27:28:89:502:654:144:Times:144:Times:research (case 17) and ‘the excitement that you are going to discover something new’ 
41:926:69929:28:28:89:517:626:144:Times:144:Times:(case 19) as the main motivational drivers sustaining them over the years.  The extended 
41:927:70018:28:27:89:502:598:144:Times:144:Times:apprentices sought to maintain their preferred jobs by engaging in internal career self-
41:928:70106:27:28:89:521:571:144:Times:144:Times:management. They risked becoming ‘trapped postdocs’ but their career actions were also 
41:929:70193:28:28:89:221:543:144:Times:144:Times:guided by personal goals.   
41:930:70221:28:27:109:523:515:144:Times:144:Times:Those involved in commercialization were exposed to the kind of socialization which 
41:931:70305:27:28:89:516:488:144:Times:144:Times:enabled them to develop more varied self-identities and career orientations that deviated 
41:932:70395:28:27:89:510:460:144:Times:144:Times:from established norms. Commercial activities usually took place outside the academic 
41:933:70481:27:28:89:508:433:144:Times:144:Times:laboratories which meant less opportunity for academic acculturation.  However, these 
41:934:70567:28:28:89:503:405:144:Times:144:Times:young scientists were exposed to the ‘specific role modelling’ (Gibson, 2004) of their 
41:935:70654:28:27:89:482:377:144:Times:144:Times:entrepreneurial professors and had contacts with many non-academic agents (e.g. 
41:936:70734:27:28:89:471:350:144:Times:144:Times:business partners and industrial researchers). The early imprinting of academic 
41:937:70814:28:27:89:517:322:144:Times:144:Times:entrepreneurialism appears to have re-oriented their career aspirations from employment 
41:938:70902:27:28:89:520:295:144:Times:144:Times:in academia towards start-ups or industry. Many pointed out that an academic career was 
41:939:70990:28:28:89:514:267:144:Times:144:Times:what they had initially expected but having worked on commercial projects, they would 
41:940:71076:28:27:89:513:239:144:Times:144:Times:now consider an industrial or hybrid career bridging science and business. One doctoral 
41:941:71164:27:28:89:501:212:144:Times:144:Times:student said: ‘...the work that I did in the [spin-off] company might have changed my 
41:942:71250:28:27:89:505:184:144:Times:144:Times:career expectations more than the PhD itself’ (case 9). Previous research suggests that 
41:943:71338:27:28:89:508:157:144:Times:144:Times:conducting commercial research during the formative years can significantly influence 
41:944:71424:28:28:89:517:129:144:Times:144:Times:young scientists’ motivation and academic identity (Hakala, 2009). The narratives in the 
41:945:71513:28:0:89:524:101:144:Times:144:Times:interviews show the formation of an entrepreneurial role identity, most notably among the 
42:946:71606:0:28:89:519:709:144:Times:144:Times:postdocs. One declared, ‘I am very comfortable with the entrepreneurial side of things...’ 
42:947:71697:28:27:89:526:681:144:Times:144:Times:(case 21).  Another envisaged his future hybrid career: ‘ ...the way I am seeing my future I 
42:948:71789:27:28:89:478:654:144:Times:144:Times:am going to say I’ve got these patents, I’ve got these publications, I’ve got these 
42:949:71873:28:28:89:504:626:144:Times:144:Times:consultancies...’ (case 22).  Entrepreneurial career imprinting encourages t hese young 
42:950:71961:28:27:89:505:598:144:Times:144:Times:scientists to explore new options by engaging in externally-oriented career activities.   
42:951:72051:27:28:109:112:571:144:Times:144:Times: 
42:952:72051:28:28:89:328:543:144:Times:144:Times:Projective career agency: P resent versus future  
42:953:72101:28:27:89:518:515:144:Times:144:Times:The career actions of the two categories also differ in their temporal focus and projective 
42:954:72193:27:28:89:468:488:144:Times:144:Times:capacity. The accumulation of past experience and direction of change in their 
42:955:72272:28:27:89:507:460:144:Times:144:Times:psychological contracts influence their future expectations and motivations for current 
42:956:72360:27:28:89:515:433:144:Times:144:Times:agentic choices. The extended apprentices experienced a strong relational psychological 
42:957:72448:28:28:89:523:405:144:Times:144:Times:contract and continued to invest in their work in anticipation of possible future benefits in 
42:958:72542:28:27:89:504:377:144:Times:144:Times:the face of uncertainty. T hey did not regard employment outside academia as a viable 
42:959:72628:27:28:89:504:350:144:Times:144:Times:option.  For example, one said: ‘There’s none ... well there’s nothing else that I could 
42:960:72717:28:27:89:506:322:144:Times:144:Times:probably apply my skills directly to...’ (case 15).  Another echoed a similar sentiment: 
42:961:72806:27:28:89:507:295:144:Times:144:Times:‘...the expertise I have got isn’t sellable. I can’t go round ...’ (case 20). The perceived 
42:962:72898:28:28:89:488:267:144:Times:144:Times:inefficacy in pursuing alternative career options coupled with their commitment to 
42:963:72981:28:27:89:519:239:144:Times:144:Times:academic research prompted them to act agentically with regard to temporally proximate 
42:964:73068:27:28:89:518:212:144:Times:144:Times:goals in maintaining their current jobs. In doing so, they also increased their dependency 
42:965:73158:28:27:89:495:184:144:Times:144:Times:on their professors and their encapsulation within the established system.  Although 
42:966:73243:27:28:89:509:157:144:Times:144:Times:happy to remain in their preferred jobs, the extended apprentices were saddened by the 
42:967:73330:28:28:89:505:129:144:Times:144:Times:poor prospect for attaining their desired career outcomes. The following quote vividly 
42:968:73417:28:0:89:518:101:144:Times:144:Times:illustrates this sentiment: ‘...I am happy, you know, I wouldn’t recommend it to anybody 
43:969:73509:0:28:89:484:709:144:Times:144:Times:but I’m content to be sad’ (case 15; emphasis added).  The ability of the extended 
43:970:73592:28:27:89:525:681:144:Times:144:Times:apprentices to distance themselves from the present and engage with future possibilities is 
43:971:73684:27:28:89:487:654:144:Times:144:Times:constrained by their desire to maintain current jobs and reliance on proxy agency.  
43:972:73767:28:28:89:503:626:144:Times:144:Times: The runaways were less constrained by relational obligations and established role 
43:973:73849:28:27:89:470:598:144:Times:144:Times:expectations and displayed a more projective, future-focused orientation. They 
43:974:73927:27:28:89:498:571:144:Times:144:Times:experienced a transactional pattern of change in their psychological contracts and no 
43:975:74013:28:28:89:523:543:144:Times:144:Times:longer anticipated   future benefits from the relationships with their professors. The shift in 
43:976:74109:28:27:89:507:515:144:Times:144:Times:their career preferences away from academia towards private industry enabled them to 
43:977:74194:27:28:89:506:488:144:Times:144:Times:see alternatives. Moreover, active engagement in self-directed learning enhanced their 
43:978:74280:28:27:89:506:460:144:Times:144:Times:self-efficacy beliefs and motivations for exploring new possibilities. For example, one 
43:979:74368:27:28:89:523:433:144:Times:144:Times:expressed his confidence in managing a career transition: ‘I know I could leave tomorrow 
43:980:74457:28:28:89:471:405:144:Times:144:Times:and do something else completely. I have, you know, a great knowledge of my 
43:981:74533:28:27:89:497:377:144:Times:144:Times:transferrable skills...’ (case 23).  Their psychological mobility ( Sullivan and Arthur, 
43:982:74622:27:28:89:505:350:144:Times:144:Times:2006) and imaginative engagement with future work selves ( Strauss et al., 2012) gave 
43:983:74707:28:27:89:524:322:144:Times:144:Times:them a sense of renewed optimism. This quote is illustrative, ‘So I don’t have any worries 
43:984:74798:27:28:89:523:295:144:Times:144:Times:about jobs now because I will be able to do something...’ (case 21; emphasis added).  The 
43:985:74888:28:28:89:512:267:144:Times:144:Times:anticipation of future possibilities and assertion of personal agency drive the runaways’ 
43:986:74977:28:27:89:500:239:144:Times:144:Times:proactive career behaviours. Table 3 summarizes the main findings, showing the two 
43:987:75060:27:28:89:511:212:144:Times:144:Times:responses to unmet expectations and their links to types of exchange and psychological 
43:988:75147:28:27:89:424:184:144:Times:144:Times:contracts that create variability in agentic orientations and capacities. 
43:989:75220:27:28:109:508:157:144:Times:144:Times:The divergent patterns are also reflected in the young scientists’ subsequent career 
43:990:75305:28:28:89:479:129:144:Times:144:Times:trajectories which we tracked over time.  The great majority of those involved in 
43:991:75387:28:0:89:516:101:144:Times:144:Times:collaborative research (13 out of 15 cases) remained in academia, whereas all but two of 
44:992:75479:0:28:89:524:709:144:Times:144:Times:the nine cases engaged in commercialization sought employment outside academia (six in 
44:993:75566:28:27:89:522:681:144:Times:144:Times:start-ups and one in a private firm). Although career outcomes are influenced by a variety 
44:994:75657:27:28:89:515:654:144:Times:144:Times:of personal and environmental factors, individuals’ agentic effort plays a  crucial role in 
44:995:75749:28:28:89:495:626:144:Times:144:Times:shaping them. This by no means implies that individuals have full control over their 
44:996:75834:28:27:89:494:598:144:Times:144:Times:careers and are able to escape organizational dependency. Agency is situated within 
44:997:75918:27:28:89:498:571:144:Times:144:Times:multilayered contexts that can enable and constrain careers (Tams and Arthur 2010). 
44:998:76001:28:28:89:502:543:144:Times:144:Times:Proxy agency is socially mediated, which may result in actors’ over-reliance on those 
44:999:76087:28:27:89:518:515:144:Times:144:Times:who are in positions of control and the restriction of one’s own efficacy,  as illustrated by 
44:1000:76180:27:28:89:492:488:144:Times:144:Times:the extended apprentices. Personal agency, by contrast, is effectuated more directly 
44:1001:76265:28:27:89:490:460:144:Times:144:Times:through actors’ personal choice processes, which enable the assertion of individual 
44:1002:76349:27:28:89:501:433:144:Times:144:Times:autonomy in creating new opportunities, as in the case of the runaways.  However, in 
44:1003:76434:28:28:89:508:405:144:Times:144:Times:crafting their own careers, the runaways also drew on established resources to enhance 
44:1004:76521:28:27:89:224:377:144:Times:144:Times:the possibility of success.    
44:1005:76552:27:28:271:363:350:144:Times:144:Times:Table 3 about here 
44:1006:76570:28:27:89:155:322:144:Times:144:Times:Conclusions 
44:1007:76582:27:28:89:506:295:144:Times:144:Times:This study has illustrated how the enactment of particular types of agency is related to 
44:1008:76671:28:28:89:521:267:144:Times:144:Times:forms of exchange underlying individuals’ psychological contracts, which influence their 
44:1009:76760:28:27:89:517:239:144:Times:144:Times:agentic orientations and capacities, and reactions to unmet expectations.  It contributes to 
44:1010:76853:27:28:89:481:212:144:Times:144:Times:the psychological contract and career literature in three ways. First, in contrast to 
44:1011:76939:28:27:89:522:184:144:Times:144:Times:mainstream psychological contract theory,  which stresses employee disengagement when 
44:1012:77025:27:28:89:513:157:144:Times:144:Times:career promises are unfulfilled, our findings present a more varied picture and highlight 
44:1013:77115:28:28:89:512:129:144:Times:144:Times:the scope for proactive career shaping. The extended apprentices responded by ‘scaling 
44:1014:77202:28:0:89:516:101:144:Times:144:Times:up’ their contributions; the runaways did not just exit the relationship but sought to craft 
45:1015:77298:0:28:89:510:709:144:Times:144:Times:new careers by drawing value from existing relationships. Both categories assert career 
45:1016:77386:28:27:89:504:681:144:Times:144:Times:agency, albeit in different ways.  Our analysis suggests that individuals are capable of 
45:1017:77475:27:28:89:517:654:144:Times:144:Times:exercising agency even when they apparently lack power and resources, as illustrated by 
45:1018:77562:28:28:89:473:626:144:Times:144:Times:the young scientists in unequal dependency relationships with their professors.  
45:1019:77643:28:27:109:523:598:144:Times:144:Times:Second, the framework developed in this article integrates psychological contract and 
45:1020:77729:27:28:89:487:571:144:Times:144:Times:career agency theories to account for the varied ways in which individuals react to 
45:1021:77813:28:28:89:490:543:144:Times:144:Times:unfulfilled expectations.  Although the psychological contract literature recognizes 
45:1022:77898:28:27:89:505:515:144:Times:144:Times:variation in employee responses, it stresses the influence of exchange relationships on 
45:1023:77986:27:28:89:482:488:144:Times:144:Times:organizational commitment, which mediates the effects of unmet expectations on 
45:1024:78065:28:27:89:513:460:144:Times:144:Times:employee attitudes and behaviours.  This study stresses employee agency as a source of 
45:1025:78152:27:28:89:508:433:144:Times:144:Times:variation and explains how different forms of exchange endow individuals with varied 
45:1026:78237:28:28:89:523:405:144:Times:144:Times:relational and cognitive resources for career agency.  The distinction between ‘proxy’ and 
45:1027:78328:28:27:89:507:377:144:Times:144:Times:‘personal’ agency adds a new dimension to the debate in career studies, which focuses 
45:1028:78414:27:28:89:516:350:144:Times:144:Times:exclusively on personal agency and the conditions that enable (or deter) it.  Our analysis 
45:1029:78505:28:27:89:522:322:144:Times:144:Times:goes beyond this by showing how the enactment of a  particular type of agency influences 
45:1030:78593:27:28:89:346:295:144:Times:144:Times:choice of specific career self-management strategies. 
45:1031:78647:28:28:109:523:267:144:Times:144:Times:Third, our conceptualization of career agency as comprising three elements integrates 
45:1032:78733:28:27:89:491:239:144:Times:144:Times:the sociological and socio-cognitive perspectives, and demonstrates the value of an 
45:1033:78817:27:28:89:498:212:144:Times:144:Times:interdisciplinary approach urged by career scholars (Arthur, 2008; Tams and Arthur, 
45:1034:78901:28:27:89:508:184:144:Times:144:Times:2010). Although it has been long recognized that careers have objective and subjective 
45:1035:78988:27:28:89:473:157:144:Times:144:Times:aspects (Barley, 1989), we extend this to include the projective dimension. The 
45:1036:79068:28:28:89:518:129:144:Times:144:Times:psychological contract is a temporally embedded concept but extant research stresses the 
45:1037:79157:28:0:89:502:101:144:Times:144:Times:influence of past experience on employees’ current behaviours and deals mainly with 
46:1038:79243:0:28:89:505:709:144:Times:144:Times:objective time. Our study highlights the importance of the future-oriented (projective) 
46:1039:79331:28:27:89:521:681:144:Times:144:Times:dimension and subjective time by examining how individuals’ perceived future prospects 
46:1040:79418:27:28:89:523:654:144:Times:144:Times:and salient time horizons influence their current agentic behaviours. Some career scholars 
46:1041:79509:28:28:89:524:626:144:Times:144:Times:highlight the time perspective as a determinant of career behaviour ( Marko and Savickas, 
46:1042:79599:28:27:89:469:598:144:Times:144:Times:1998), but they have not explicitly linked it to career agency. A more adequate 
46:1043:79679:27:28:89:468:571:144:Times:144:Times:theorization of the temporal embeddedness of agency will greatly enhance our 
46:1044:79756:28:28:89:265:543:144:Times:144:Times:understanding of career behaviours. 
46:1045:79792:28:27:109:524:515:144:Times:144:Times:The study also sheds new light on the contemporary debate about the changing nature 
46:1046:79876:27:28:89:476:488:144:Times:144:Times:of academic careers and its implications for early career scientists. A significant 
46:1047:79960:28:27:89:522:460:144:Times:144:Times:development in academic employment in the past two decades has been the increased use 
46:1048:80046:27:28:89:481:433:144:Times:144:Times:of contract researchers within a tightly squeezed academic job market, which has 
46:1049:80127:28:28:89:520:405:144:Times:144:Times:restricted opportunities for career progression. The existing literature often highlights the 
46:1050:80221:28:27:89:468:377:144:Times:144:Times:plight of the ‘trapped postdocs’ and portrays young scientists as victims of the 
46:1051:80302:27:28:89:522:350:144:Times:144:Times:entrepreneurial university.  The experience of the ‘extended apprentice’ clearly illustrates 
46:1052:80395:28:27:89:499:322:144:Times:144:Times:their vulnerability. However, our analysis also suggests that the career trajectories of 
46:1053:80484:27:28:89:519:295:144:Times:144:Times:young scientists have become more diverse and fluid. Moreover, young scientists are not 
46:1054:80572:28:28:89:503:267:144:Times:144:Times:just resources for the entrepreneurial efforts of their professors or universities, but are 
46:1055:80664:28:27:89:507:239:144:Times:144:Times:active agents in promoting the new knowledge regime. The transition of the ‘runways’ 
46:1056:80749:27:28:89:504:212:144:Times:144:Times:towards entrepreneurial start-ups is a case in point. The entrepreneurial university has 
46:1057:80838:28:27:89:523:184:144:Times:144:Times:expanded the institutional context in which scientific careers develop and offers scope for 
46:1058:80930:27:28:89:494:157:144:Times:144:Times:some to re-craft their careers at the intersection of science and business. Beyond the 
46:1059:81017:28:28:89:492:129:144:Times:144:Times:dichotomous options of employment in either academia or industry, the blurring of 
46:1060:81099:28:0:89:521:101:144:Times:144:Times:boundaries between the two sectors has led to hybrid options. Recent evidence elsewhere 
47:1061:81190:0:28:89:516:709:144:Times:144:Times:shows a growing trend of young scientists pursuing careers in knowledge-intensive start-
47:1062:81278:28:27:89:517:681:144:Times:144:Times:ups (Roach and Sauermann, 2010). This suggests that one way to ameliorate the crisis in 
47:1063:81366:27:28:89:512:654:144:Times:144:Times:career expectations would be to broaden the career promises by including opportunities 
47:1064:81452:28:28:89:499:626:144:Times:144:Times:outside academia. Provision of realistic job previews and more balanced information 
47:1065:81536:28:27:89:500:598:144:Times:144:Times:about career options would also help young scientists make better informed choices.  
47:1066:81620:27:28:89:494:571:144:Times:144:Times:Another practical implication is to make research training more relevant for a wider 
47:1067:81704:28:28:89:499:543:144:Times:144:Times:variety of careers beyond the traditional boundaries of scientific and academic work. 
47:1068:81789:28:27:109:511:515:144:Times:144:Times:Beyond academia, similar growth of contingent work can also be observed in other 
47:1069:81870:27:28:89:479:488:144:Times:144:Times:knowledge-intensive sectors where intensive competition for entry to high status 
47:1070:81951:28:27:89:487:460:144:Times:144:Times:positions has given rise to extended entry tournaments, with some career aspirants 
47:1071:82034:27:28:89:523:433:144:Times:144:Times:becoming trapped in low status positions ( Marsden, 2010). This paper has highlighted the 
47:1072:82124:28:28:89:506:405:144:Times:144:Times:value of studying academic careers for understanding the impact of these employment 
47:1073:82208:28:27:89:516:377:144:Times:144:Times:trends on the psychological contract and career behaviour of individuals. The theoretical 
47:1074:82298:27:28:89:523:350:144:Times:144:Times:and practical insights gained from this study, therefore, have wider relevance. However, a 
47:1075:82389:28:27:89:495:322:144:Times:144:Times:number of qualifications should be noted. First, we examined academic scientists in 
47:1076:82473:27:28:89:522:295:144:Times:144:Times:major research universities who enjoy considerable freedom in their work and hence their 
47:1077:82562:28:28:89:468:267:144:Times:144:Times:scope for individual agency is great. Findings based on those working in more 
47:1078:82640:28:27:89:511:239:144:Times:144:Times:constraining environments may differ. Second, the study was conducted in the research 
47:1079:82726:27:28:89:507:212:144:Times:144:Times:disciplines where the boundaries between academia and industry increasingly overlap, 
47:1080:82811:28:27:89:502:184:144:Times:144:Times:giving rise to new career options across organizational fields. The same opportunities 
47:1081:82897:27:28:89:497:157:144:Times:144:Times:may not exist in other areas. Third, the analysis was based on a small sample of ‘pre-
47:1082:82983:28:28:89:488:129:144:Times:144:Times:tenured’ researchers still in academia at the time of the study whose psychological 
47:1083:83067:28:0:89:521:101:144:Times:144:Times:contracts included an expectation of academic careers.   Individuals who do not have fixed 
48:1084:83160:0:28:89:522:709:144:Times:144:Times:or strong initial career expectations may not exhibit the same kind of agentic behaviours.  
48:1085:83252:28:27:89:462:681:144:Times:144:Times:Future research could include knowledge workers from less permissive work 
48:1086:83326:27:28:89:516:654:144:Times:144:Times:environments and individuals at different stages of the whole career spectrum to explore 
48:1087:83415:28:28:89:515:626:144:Times:144:Times:more fully the relational and temporal contexts that influence the psychological contract 
48:1088:83504:28:27:89:202:598:144:Times:144:Times:and career behaviour.

48:1096:83762:28:27:89:204:377:144:Times:144:Times:Grant No. 160250018).

48:1098:83783:28:23:89:121:322:144:Times:144:Times:Notes 
48:1099:83788:23:32:89:504:299:65:Times:144:Times:1 This term has been used by Hamilton (1995)  to refer to trainees who ran away from 
48:1100:83873:32:28:89:477:267:144:Times:144:Times:their masters in late 18th century North America,  which subsequently led to the 
48:1101:83954:28:23:89:262:239:144:Times:144:Times:breakdown of apprenticeship there. 
48:1102:83988:23:32:89:476:216:65:Times:144:Times:2 In most cases, professors had their own research groups and the names of their 
48:1103:84069:32:27:89:522:184:144:Times:144:Times:students/postdocs were listed on the websites, thus making it possible to identify matched 
48:1104:84160:27:28:89:518:157:144:Times:144:Times:pairs. We also examined their joint publications to determine the extent of collaboration, 
48:1105:84251:28:0:89:260:129:144:Times:144:Times:which helped the sample selection. 
49:1106:84288:0:32:89:506:713:65:Times:144:Times:3 The interviews with the professors were part of a study on entrepreneurial professors 
49:1107:84376:32:23:89:514:681:144:Times:144:Times:(Lam, 2011), which included questions about their relationships with students/postdocs. 
49:1108:84464:23:32:89:518:658:65:Times:144:Times:4 The term ‘apprentice’ refers to those who learn to conduct research or conduct research 
49:1109:84554:32:28:89:505:626:144:Times:144:Times:while working under the direction of their professors/supervisors. It includes the more 
49:1110:84642:28:27:89:516:598:144:Times:144:Times:experienced postdocs who have not yet made a full transition to become a ‘colleague’ or 
49:1111:84730:27:23:89:295:571:144:Times:144:Times:‘master’ (Laudel and Gläser, 2008: 390).   
49:1112:84773:23:32:89:494:548:65:Times:144:Times:5 Apprenticeship always involves elements of training and productive work, and the 
49:1113:84856:32:28:89:509:516:144:Times:144:Times:balance between the two has been controversial. Ryan (2004), for example, argues that 
49:1114:84942:28:28:89:497:488:144:Times:144:Times:the substitution of productive work for learning during the apprenticeship could be a 
49:1115:85028:28:28:89:179:460:144:Times:144:Times:source of conflict.
