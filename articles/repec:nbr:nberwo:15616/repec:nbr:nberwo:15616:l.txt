2:34:2013:14:14:71:539:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:costs or inattention? I derive bounds on structural price elasticities that are a function of the observed
2:35:2119:14:14:71:539:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:effect of a price change on demand, the size of the price change, and the degree of frictions. The degree
2:36:2224:14:14:71:539:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:of frictions is measured by the utility losses agents tolerate to deviate from the frictionless optimum.
2:37:2328:14:14:71:539:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:The bounds imply that frictions affect intensive margin elasticities much more than extensive margin
2:38:2428:14:14:71:539:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:elasticities. I apply these bounds to the literature on labor supply. The utility costs of ignoring the tax
2:39:2535:14:14:71:539:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:changes used to identify intensive margin labor supply elasticities are typically less than 1% of earnings.
2:40:2642:14:14:71:539:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:As a result, small frictions can explain the differences between micro and macro elasticities, extensive
2:41:2746:14:14:71:539:462:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:and intensive margin elasticities, and other disparate findings. Pooling estimates from existing studies,

3:51:3110:0:31:74:187:700:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:C:1  Introduction
3:52:3125:31:20:74:519:669:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The identiÖcation of structural parameters of stylized models is one of the central tasks of
3:53:3217:20:21:74:519:649:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:applied economics.   Unfortunately, most models omit various frictions that make agents
3:54:3304:21:20:74:519:628:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:deviate systematically from their theoretical predictions.  For instance, canonical models of
3:55:3397:20:20:74:519:608:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:labor supply or consumption behavior do not permit adjustment costs, inattentive agents,
3:56:3485:20:21:74:519:588:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:or status quo biases.  How can structural parameters be identiÖed when agents face such
3:57:3572:21:20:74:181:567:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:optimization frictions?
3:58:3595:20:20:91:519:547:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:One natural solution is to estimate the structural parameters of a model that incorporates
3:59:3685:20:21:74:519:527:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the frictions. This approach has two limitations in practice. First, it is di¢ cult to incorporate
3:60:3783:21:20:74:519:506:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:all frictions in a tractable model.  Second, estimating even simple dynamic models with fric-
3:61:3876:20:20:74:519:486:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tions, such as Ss adjustment, requires strong assumptions and is computationally challenging
3:62:3968:20:21:74:519:466:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(Attanasio 2000). Motivated by these limitations, I propose an alternative solution: bounding
3:63:4061:21:20:74:466:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:structural preference parameters without identifying how frictions a§ect behavior.
3:64:4143:20:20:91:519:425:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:I analyze a standard dynamic lifecycle model in which the e§ect of income-compensated
3:65:4228:20:21:74:520:405:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(Hicksian) price changes on demand is determined by a structural parameter of utility".  I
3:66:4318:21:20:74:519:384:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:introduce optimization frictions into this nominal model through an error term in the demand
3:67:4410:20:20:74:519:364:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:function whose conditional expectation is unknown.  These optimization errors generate dif-
3:68:4501:20:21:74:519:344:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ferences between mean observed demand and the mean optimal demand predicted by the
3:69:4583:21:20:74:519:323:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:frictionless model.  Because the optimization errors need not be orthogonal to the price, the
3:70:4676:20:20:74:519:303:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:observed Hicksian elasticityb"estimated from demand responses to a price change di§ers from
3:71:4767:20:21:74:520:283:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the structural elasticity parameter". The observed elasticityb"confounds preferences (") with
3:72:4860:21:20:74:519:262:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the e§ect of the frictions.  For example, agents may under-react to a price increase in the
3:73:4951:20:20:74:258:242:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:short-run because of adjustment costs.
3:74:4989:20:21:91:519:222:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:This paper seeks to identify"from estimates ofb".  I focus on identifying"because it is
3:75:5076:21:20:74:519:201:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:important for both positive and normative analysis. The impacts of prices in steady-state are
3:76:5169:20:20:74:519:181:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:determined purely by"in many models.  Moreover, the recovery of preference parameters is
3:77:5257:20:21:74:212:161:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:essential for welfare analysis.
3:78:5288:21:20:91:520:140:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:I bound"from observations ofb"by assuming that agents choose points near the friction-
3:79:5374:20:20:74:519:120:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:less optimum.  SpeciÖcally, I allow agents to deviate arbitrarily from the nominal modelís
3:80:5464:20:0:74:520:100:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:prediction as long as the expected lifetime utility cost of doing so is less than-percent of
4:81:5557:0:20:74:519:700:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:expenditure.  This property is satisÖed by standard dynamic adjustment cost models, where
4:82:5646:20:21:74:519:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:agents remain on average within some utility threshold of their optimum. In the case of other
4:83:5739:21:20:74:519:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:frictions such as inattention or status quo biases, this restriction requires that agents respond
4:84:5836:20:20:74:285:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to incentives that are su¢ ciently important.
4:85:5881:20:21:91:519:619:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:I derive a closed-form representation for bounds on the structural Hicksian elasticity"as a
4:86:5972:21:20:74:519:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:function of the observed Hicksian elasticityb", the size of the price change used for identiÖcation
4:87:6071:20:20:74:520:578:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f4:B:- logp, and the degree of frictions-.1The bounds shed light on what can be learned from
4:88:6158:20:21:74:519:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:reduced-form elasticity estimates in an environment with frictions.  The bounds shrink at a
4:89:6249:21:20:74:519:537:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:quadratic rate with- logp. As a result, pooling several small price changes ñalthough useful
4:90:6341:20:20:74:519:517:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in improving statistical precision ñyields less information about the structural elasticity than
4:91:6437:20:21:74:519:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:studying a few large price changes.  Ifb" >0, the lower bound on the structural elasticity"is
4:92:6530:21:20:74:519:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:strictly positive, showing that frictions do not a§ect tests of a null hypothesis of zero response.
4:93:6629:20:20:74:519:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:If the observed elasticityb"= 0, the upper bound on"can be expressed in terms of the utility
4:94:6721:20:21:74:519:436:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:cost of ignoring the price change.  This permits straightforward calculations of the range of
4:95:6814:21:20:74:519:415:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:elasticities consistent with zero behavioral response, analogous to power calculations used to
4:96:6908:20:20:74:211:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:evaluate statistical precision.
4:97:6939:20:20:91:519:375:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The preceding results apply to an intensive margin model in which consumption is perfectly
4:98:7029:20:21:74:519:355:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:divisible.  I also derive bounds on extensive margin elasticities by analyzing a model in which
4:99:7124:21:20:74:519:334:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:agents choose whether to buy an indivisible good.  The bounds on the structural extensive
4:100:7213:20:20:74:520:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:margin elasticity (-) shrink linearly with-and are therefore an order of magnitude tighter
4:101:7303:20:21:74:519:294:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:than those on the Hicksian intensive margin elasticity ("). The bounds are tighter because the
4:102:7397:21:20:74:519:273:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:utility costs of ignoring price changes are Örst-order on the extensive margin, in contrast with
4:103:7493:20:20:74:519:253:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the second-order costs on the intensive margin.  Hence, frictions such as adjustment costs or
4:104:7586:20:21:74:519:233:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:inattention have smaller e§ects on aggregate demand when microeconomic choices are discrete
4:105:7677:21:20:74:186:212:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rather than continuous.
4:106:7700:20:20:91:520:192:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:One can obtain tighter bounds on"or-by calculating the least upper bound and the largest
4:107:7788:20:21:74:519:172:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:lower bound implied by multiple observed elasticities.  The sensitivity of structural elasticity
4:108:7884:21:20:74:519:151:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimates to frictions can be evaluated by computing these uniÖed bounds as a function of
4:109:7973:20:16:74:520:131:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:B:-.  The smallest level of frictions-minthat reconciles a group of observed elasticities provides

4:111:8172:15:0:74:470:100:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:that aggregate welfare would be 1% higher absent frictions (-= 1%) to be a plausible benchmark.

5:115:8538:20:20:74:519:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:observed elasticities grows large, providing a point estimate of the structural elasticity adjusted
5:116:8637:20:21:74:132:619:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for frictions.
5:117:8651:21:20:91:519:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:I apply these methods to investigate what can be learned about structural labor supply

5:122:9101:20:21:74:519:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:evidence, ìthe profession has settled on a value for this elasticity close to zeroî(Saez, Slemrod,
5:123:9199:21:20:74:519:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and Giertz 2011).  I show that small frictions could explain why observed elasticities are
5:124:9289:20:20:74:519:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:often near zero by calculating the utility costs of ignoring tax reforms.  For instance, the
5:125:9381:20:21:74:519:436:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:utility costs of ignoring the widely studied Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA86) ñand instead

5:127:9558:20:20:74:519:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for all except top income earners.  Accordingly, empirical studies Önd that TRA86 induced
5:128:9647:20:20:74:519:375:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:behavioral responses in the short run only for top income earners.  To assess what can be
5:129:9736:20:21:74:519:355:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:learned about"from existing estimates of intensive margin labor supply elasticities, I calculate
5:130:9832:21:20:74:520:334:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:bounds on"using estimates from studies of hours elasticities, taxable income elasticities,
5:131:9922:20:20:74:519:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:elasticities for top income earners, and macroeconomic cross-country estimates. Even though
5:132:10013:20:21:74:519:294:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the observed elasticity estimates vary widely, all the estimates are consistent with a single
5:133:10106:21:20:74:519:273:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:structural elasticity"if one permits frictions of1%of post-tax earnings in choosing labor
5:134:10195:20:20:74:519:253:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:B:supply.  Pooling the Öfteen hours and taxable income elasticity estimates yields bounds on"
5:135:10286:20:21:74:520:233:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of(0:28;0:54)when-= 1%, with a 95% conÖdence interval of(0:23;0:61).  The minimum
5:136:10367:21:20:74:519:212:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:level of frictions required to reconcile these Öfteen estimates is-min= 0:5%of net earnings
5:137:10458:20:20:74:503:192:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and the corresponding point estimate of the structural Hicksian elasticity is"--min= 0:33.
5:138:10548:20:21:91:519:172:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Second, I analyze how frictions a§ect extensive margin elasticities ñ the e§ects of tax
5:139:10635:21:20:74:519:151:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:changes on employment rates.  The utility costs of ignoring tax changes on the extensive
5:140:10723:20:20:74:519:131:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:margin are between 5 to 10% of income for many tax policy changes in the U.S.  These
5:141:10807:20:21:74:519:111:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:large costs could explain why microeconometric studies uniformly detect signiÖcant impacts
5:142:10897:21:0:74:519:90:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of tax changes on employment rates despite Önding negligible intensive margin responses.
6:143:10986:0:20:74:519:700:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:This result challenges the prevailing consensus that extensive margin elasticities are much
6:144:11077:20:21:74:519:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:larger than intensive margin elasticities.  Instead, current empirical methods may simply be
6:145:11169:21:20:74:519:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:better suited to detecting responses on the extensive margin than the intensive margin in the
6:146:11262:20:20:74:519:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:presence of frictions.  I calculate bounds on the structural extensive margin elasticity-using
6:147:11356:20:21:74:519:619:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimates from existing studies.  The bounds on the extensive margin elasticities implied by
6:148:11448:21:20:74:519:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:each study are very tight, conÖrming that observed elasticities provide accurate estimates of
6:149:11541:20:20:74:519:578:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:structural elasticities on the extensive margin.  The mean extensive margin elasticity among
6:150:11633:20:21:74:301:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the microeconometric studies I consider is0:25.
6:151:11680:21:20:91:519:537:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Third, I turn to the literature on non-linear budget set estimation, which analyzes the
6:152:11767:20:20:74:519:517:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:impacts of progressive income taxation on labor supply.  One well known issue in Ötting such
6:153:11859:20:21:74:519:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:models is that much fewer individuals bunch at kink points of the tax system than one would
6:154:11950:21:20:74:519:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:predict in a frictionless model (Saez 2010). I show that the utility gains from bunching at kinks
6:155:12047:20:20:74:519:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are very small, typically less than 1% of consumption.  Allowing for optimization frictions in
6:156:12141:20:21:74:519:436:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:NLBS models can explain the lack of bunching at most kinks and provide a more disciplined
6:157:12230:21:20:74:225:415:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:error structure for such models.
6:158:12262:20:20:91:519:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Finally, I assess whether frictions can explain the discrepancy between micro and macro es-
6:159:12353:20:20:74:519:375:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:timates of Hicksian (steady-state) and Frisch (intertemporal substitution) elasticities.  Macro
6:160:12448:20:21:74:519:355:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimates of the Hicksian elasticity, which are based on cross-country comparisons, are larger
6:161:12542:21:20:74:519:334:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:than micro estimates.  Frictions and indivisible labor (Rogerson 1988, Rogerson and Walle-
6:162:12632:20:20:74:519:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f7:B:nius 2009) fully account for this gap. On the intensive margin, the micro estimate of"= 0:33
6:163:12724:20:21:74:519:294:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:after accounting for frictions matches cross-country evidence.  On the extensive margin, mi-
6:164:12816:21:20:74:519:273:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:cro estimates match macro cross-country estimates even without accounting for frictions, as
6:165:12907:20:20:74:519:253:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:expected given the results above. Macro estimates of the Frisch elasticity, which are based on
6:166:13001:20:21:74:519:233:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:áuctuations in labor supply over the business cycle, are also larger than micro estimates of the
6:167:13097:21:20:74:519:212:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Frisch elasticity. To assess whether this discrepancy can be explained by frictions, I bound the
6:168:13193:20:20:74:519:192:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:structural intensive margin Frisch elasticity using the estimated structural Hicksian elasticity.
6:169:13290:20:21:74:519:172:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The bound on the intensive Frisch elasticity is consistent with macro evidence on áuctuations
6:170:13383:21:20:74:519:151:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in hours conditional on employment over the business cycle. However, micro estimates are not
6:171:13475:20:20:74:519:131:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:consistent with macro evidence on the extensive margin intertemporal subsitution elasticity, as
6:172:13570:20:21:74:519:111:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:shown in Chetty et al. (2011b).  I conclude that frictions explain the gap between micro and
6:173:13662:21:0:74:519:90:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:macro estimates of steady-state elasticities relevant for cross-country comparisons, but can-
7:174:13756:0:20:74:519:700:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:not reconcile the di§erences between micro and macro estimates of intertemporal substitution
7:175:13848:20:21:74:258:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:elasticities relevant for business cycles.
7:176:13890:21:20:91:519:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The analysis here should be viewed as one step toward characterizing how frictions a§ect
7:177:13978:20:20:74:519:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:labor supply elasticities.  The results are based on a standard lifecycle model of labor supply
7:178:14073:20:21:74:519:619:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:as in MaCurdy (1981) and do not account for factors incorporated into more recent models,
7:179:14162:21:20:74:519:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:such as human capital accumulation, credit constraints, or uncertainty.   One would have
7:180:14250:20:20:74:519:578:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:to specify a nominal model that incorporates all of these structural features to bound labor
7:181:14342:20:21:74:519:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:supply elasticities in such an environment.  This point illustrates a more general caveat: the
7:182:14436:21:20:74:519:537:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ability to account for frictions using bounds does not provide an excuse for failing to build an
7:183:14532:20:20:74:519:517:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:accurate model. The bounds are valid only if the nominal model is correct up to optimization
7:184:14624:20:21:74:116:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:frictions.
7:185:14634:21:20:91:519:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:This paper builds upon and relates to the partial identiÖcation, near rationality, robust
7:186:14723:20:20:74:519:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:control, and durable goods literatures.  The econometric literature on partial or set identiÖ-

7:188:14907:21:20:74:519:415:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and Rosen 2008). The present paper uses set identiÖcation to estimate structural parameters
7:189:14998:20:20:74:519:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with model mis-speciÖcation. I derive bounds by assuming that agents are ìnear rational,îas
7:190:15089:20:20:74:519:375:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in the menu cost and near rationality literature in macroeconomics (Akerlof and Yellen 1985,

7:192:15270:21:20:74:519:334:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:model parallels the robust control literature (Hansen and Sargent 2007).  The robust control

7:194:15452:20:21:74:519:294:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:I consider identiÖcation of the nominal modelís parameters in the same setting.   Finally,
7:195:15542:21:20:74:519:273:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the bounds provide an alternative method of estimating preferences or production functions
7:196:15632:20:20:74:519:253:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in models with adjustment costs.  This approach requires fewer assumptions than existing
7:197:15720:20:21:74:519:233:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:methods of identifying such models (e.g. Eberly 1994, Attanasio 2000) because it uses inputs
7:198:15812:21:20:74:519:212:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that can be estimated using quasi-experimental techniques.  However, it does not permit as

14:461:30058:20:20:74:519:574:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:results for the intensive margin case, I replicate the analysis for an extensive margin model

14:463:30242:21:20:74:422:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:combined to obtain more informative bounds on the structural elasticity.

15:511:32461:32:20:91:519:372:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f8:A:Lemma 1 captures three intuitions. First, the width of the choice set, which is2[2"\u000e]1=2

15:515:32824:20:21:74:520:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:as illustrated in Figure 1. The root--shrinkage of the choice set is driven by the second-order
15:516:32919:21:20:74:519:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:losses of deviating from the maximum of a smooth function (Akerlof and Yellen 1985, Mankiw
15:517:33009:20:20:74:103:250:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:1985).
15:518:33015:20:21:91:519:230:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Second, equation (10) shows that the width of the choice set is inversely related to the

15:523:33481:20:20:74:519:128:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:at a levelx-i;t.  The price elasticity of demand approaches zero as the curvature of the utility

17:587:36648:21:20:74:519:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:much more informative about"because the bounds shrink at a quadratic rate with- logp.
17:588:36733:20:20:74:519:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:With a price change of20%, an observed elasticity ofb"=  0:2is consistent with structural

17:590:36906:21:20:74:520:415:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rapid shrinkage is that the movement in the choice sets for a given value of"is larger when

17:593:37092:20:21:91:519:355:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Second, the bounds are asymmetric around the observed elasticity:"U-b" >b"-"L. This
17:594:37175:21:20:74:519:334:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:asymmetry is driven by the proportional relationship between the width of the choice sets
17:595:37264:20:20:74:519:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and", as shown in Lemma 1.  Large structural elasticities generate wide choice sets and are

17:597:37447:21:20:74:520:273:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:implication is that if"is small, there will be little dispersion in observed elasticities across

18:612:38788:20:20:91:519:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Finally, consider the converse case of a study that detects zero observed behavioral response

19:682:42941:20:25:74:258:139:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:parallel those for the intensive margin.

20:689:43454:20:21:74:247:619:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:This leads to greater variation in-t.
20:690:43491:21:20:91:519:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The critical di§erence between Lemma 2 and its intensive margin analog, Lemma 1, is that

20:692:43672:20:21:74:519:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:makes the choice set much narrower on the extensive margin than the intensive margin. With

20:695:43936:20:21:74:520:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:much narrower because individuals incur Örst-order utility losses from choosingxsuboptimally

23:789:50590:31:20:74:519:669:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The wage elasticity of labor supply is a parameter of central interest for tax policy analysis and
23:790:50688:20:21:74:519:649:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:macroeconomic models.  A large literature in labor economics, macroeconomics, and public

23:794:51049:21:20:74:519:567:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:few studies that estimate labor supply elasticities account for such frictions.  The methods
23:795:51141:20:20:74:519:547:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:developed above are therefore well suited to extracting the information these studies contain

23:797:51279:21:20:91:519:506:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:I analyze the e§ects of frictions on four strands of the labor supply literature: (1) inten-

25:896:58393:15:11:74:519:125:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:year.  However, because the áow utility gains are relatively small, many agents may delay adjustment until a
25:897:58501:11:11:74:519:114:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:period where frictions (e.g. job switching costs) are lower.  Thus, micro studies might not detect much change
25:898:58611:11:0:74:497:103:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:in labor supply between 1985 and 1988 even if TRA86 induced individuals to reoptimize in the long run.
26:899:58715:0:20:91:519:700:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The costs of ignoring TRA86 are considerably larger for high income earners. An individual

26:901:58896:21:20:74:519:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the tax reform.  High income individuals gain a lot more from reoptimizing both because
26:902:58983:20:20:74:519:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the dollars at stake rise with income and because the change in tax rates was larger for high

26:909:59547:20:21:74:519:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:net earnings for the median taxpayer. The utility costs of ignoring tax reforms are substantial
26:910:59642:21:20:74:519:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:only for the top 1% of income earners around TRA86.  Correspondingly, the largest observed
26:911:59732:20:20:74:519:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:elasticities in historical time series are for top income earners around TRA86; for lower income
26:912:59828:20:21:74:519:436:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:groups and other time periods, observed intensive margin elasticities are near zero (Saez 2004).
26:913:59924:21:20:91:519:415:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:While there is little gain from adjusting behavior to optimally react to taxchangeson the
26:914:60013:20:20:74:519:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:intensive margin over any three year interval, it is not the case that ignoring taxes completely
26:915:60109:20:20:74:519:375:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:imposes little cost.  For example, using equation (15), the utility cost of ignoring a tax rate

26:921:60603:21:20:74:519:237:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:elasticity estimates? To answer this question, I apply Proposition A1 to calculate the bounds
26:922:60696:20:20:74:519:217:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on"implied by a set of well-known studies of intensive margin labor supply. One should keep
26:923:60787:20:21:74:519:197:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:two caveats in mind when interpreting the results of the exercise.  First, I assume a constant
26:924:60881:21:20:74:520:176:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:structural elasticity"across all the studies, ignoring potential variation in local preferences
26:925:60976:20:20:74:519:156:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:across tax regimes, income levels, demographic groups, or countries.  Second, I assume that
26:926:61067:20:21:74:519:136:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:each study provides an unbiased estimate of the observed elasticityb".  Econometric issues
26:927:61157:21:20:74:519:115:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:such as omitted variables and mean reversion may bias some of the estimates (Saez, Slemrod,
26:928:61248:20:0:74:412:95:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and Giertz 2011).  Any such biases would pass through to the bounds.
27:929:61318:0:20:91:519:700:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Table I divides the studies of intensive margin labor supply into four groups: (A) studies
27:930:61408:20:21:74:519:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that measure labor supply using hours of work; (B) studies that measure labor supply using
27:931:61498:21:20:74:519:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:taxable income; (C) studies that use taxable income but focus exclusively on top income earn-
27:932:61591:20:20:74:519:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:ers; and (D) studies that rely on cross-sectional comparisons (across countries with di§erent

27:941:62411:20:20:74:519:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that would generate the same statistical precision as the variation in- log(1-MTR)used for

27:948:62962:20:20:91:519:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The largest observed elasticities in Panels A and B are obtained from the studies that
27:949:63048:20:21:74:519:294:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:focus on the largest changes in tax policy: the abolition of the income tax for a year in Iceland

27:952:63325:20:21:74:519:233:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are less likely to attenuate short-run responses to very large price changes.  Excluding the

27:954:63505:20:20:74:519:192:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:B is below all of the point estimates in Panels C and D.  Moreover, many of the conÖdence

27:956:63685:21:16:74:519:151:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:C and D. Hence, the systematic di§erences in point estimates of observed elasticities across
27:957:63777:16:14:83:519:135:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:21In the model in (19), the hours and taxable income elasticities are the same.  I therefore pool estimates
27:958:63884:14:11:74:519:121:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:from both types of studies to bound the structural labor supply elasticity in this model.  In more general
27:959:63990:11:11:74:519:110:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:models, taxable income elasticities may be larger than hours elasticities because they incorporate changes in

30:1043:70534:21:20:74:268:392:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:this pattern could be driven by frictions.
30:1044:70576:20:20:91:519:372:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Panel A shows tax changes and utility costs on the intensive margin.  The dashed blue
30:1045:70661:20:21:74:519:352:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:line shows that between 1993 and 1996, net-of-tax wage rates rose by 20% for single tax Ölers

30:1048:70931:20:21:74:519:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:because of the increase in the phase-out tax rate.  The solid red curve, constructed as in
30:1049:71021:21:20:74:519:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Figure 5c, shows that most individuals lose less than 1% of net earnings per year by ignoring
30:1050:71114:20:20:74:519:250:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f7:B:these changes on the intensive margin. Corollary 1 implies that an observed response ofb"= 0

30:1054:71479:20:21:74:519:169:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:On the extensive margin, the relevant tax rates are average rather than marginal. The dashed

30:1056:71668:20:20:74:519:128:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of this reform.  The solid red curve shows the utility cost of ignoring the EITC expansion for
30:1057:71762:20:21:74:519:108:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:individuals on the margin of entering the labor force at various income levels in 1993, which
30:1058:71855:21:0:74:519:87:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:coincides with the log change in the net of tax rate as shown in (17).  Consider an individual
31:1059:71951:0:20:74:519:700:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:who would earn $5,000 when working and is indi§erent between working and not working
31:1060:72035:20:21:74:519:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in 1993, i.e. has disutility of workbi= 5000-T1993(5000).  Figure 9b shows that for this
31:1061:72123:21:20:74:519:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:marginal individual, the gain from entering the labor force in response to the Clinton EITC
31:1062:72214:20:20:74:519:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:expansion is 18% of net income when working, roughly $1,000.  In contrast, the gain from
31:1063:72302:20:21:74:519:619:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:reoptimizing hours on the intensive margin for a worker earning $5,000 prior to the reform is
31:1064:72395:21:20:74:519:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:0.7% of income, roughly $50.  On the extensive margin, the agent would have lost the extra
31:1065:72485:20:20:74:519:578:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:$1,000 EITC refund if he had ignored the tax reform and stayed out of the labor force.  But
31:1066:72576:20:21:74:519:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on the intensive margin, a worker gets the $1,000 tax reduction even if he does not change his
31:1067:72670:21:20:74:519:537:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:hours.  This could explain why individuals respond to the EITC expansion in the short run
31:1068:72759:20:20:74:519:517:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on the extensive margin despite frictions.  Indeed, Corollary 2 implies that one could observe
31:1069:72853:20:21:74:520:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:an elasticity ofb-= 0on the extensive margin only if frictions in adjusting labor supply exceed

31:1071:72989:20:20:91:519:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Figure 6b extends this analysis to cover all tax changes from 1970-2006. In contrast to the
31:1072:73080:20:21:74:519:436:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:intensive margin results shown in Figure 6a, there are several tax changes that would generate
31:1073:73174:21:20:74:520:415:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:large utility losses (5-10% of net earnings) if ignored on the extensive margin.23The utility
31:1074:73267:20:20:74:519:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:costs are particularly large for individuals who earn low incomes when working, consistent

31:1077:73495:27:21:74:519:319:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Chetty et al. (2011b, Table 1) present a meta analysis of extensive margin elasticity estimates.
31:1078:73591:21:20:74:519:298:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:In Table II, I apply Proposition 2 to calculate the bounds implied by the studies they consider
31:1079:73686:20:20:74:520:278:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:with-= 1%frictions.24Panel A considers estimates from quasi-experimental studies, while
31:1080:73773:20:21:74:519:258:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Panel B considers steady-state estimates from studies that exploit cross-sectional variation
31:1081:73865:21:20:74:409:237:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:across countries or individuals. Two results emerge from this analysis.
31:1082:73936:20:20:91:519:217:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:First, the bounds on extensive margin elasticities are much tighter than those on the
31:1083:74021:20:17:74:519:197:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:intensive margin, as shown in Figure 10.  For instance, Eissa and Liebmanís (1996) analysis
31:1084:74112:17:15:83:519:180:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:23In these calculations, I assume that the marginal worker is in the labor force in cases where the average tax
31:1085:74223:15:11:74:519:165:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:rates rises over the three years and out of the labor force for cases where it falls. This is the relevant calculation
31:1086:74341:11:11:74:519:154:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:to determine when one would observe zero response on the extensive margin, as shown above.  I exclude the
31:1087:74446:11:10:74:519:143:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:99.5 percentile from Figure 6b for scaling reasons and because few individuals enter the labor force at the 99.5
31:1088:74558:10:8:74:223:133:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:percentile of the income distribution.
31:1089:74596:8:14:83:519:125:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:24Among the studies considered by Chetty et al.  (2011), I include only those that estimate steady-state
31:1090:74700:14:0:74:466:111:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:elasticities and for which I was able to compute the size of the tax change used for identiÖcation.

32:1092:74882:20:21:74:519:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Observed labor supply elasticities appear to provide reasonably accurate estimates of structural

32:1094:75015:20:20:91:519:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Second, the heterogeneity in extensive margin elasticities across groups cannot be at-
32:1095:75101:20:21:74:519:619:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:tributed purely to frictions. The minimum level of frictions required to reconcile the extensive

32:1098:75386:20:21:74:519:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that participation elasticities are especially large for low-income single mothers (Meyer and
32:1099:75479:21:20:74:519:537:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Rosenbaum 2001).  There may be similar heterogeneity in structural elasticities on the inten-
32:1100:75572:20:20:74:519:517:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sive margin, but existing evidence is inadequate to detect such heterogeneity in the presence
32:1101:75665:20:21:74:157:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of small frictions.
32:1102:75684:21:20:91:519:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The results in Tables I and II challenge the commonly held view that extensive margin
32:1103:75769:20:20:74:519:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:elasticities are larger than intensive margin elasticities.  This view underpins some important
32:1104:75864:20:21:74:519:436:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:results in modern optimal tax theory, such as providing a rationale for programs such as the

32:1106:76046:20:20:74:519:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:margin elasticities may be smaller than extensive elasticities simply because of frictions.  In
32:1107:76141:20:20:74:519:375:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:steady state, the intensive elasticity may actually be larger than extensive elasticities, reducing
32:1108:76240:20:30:74:318:355:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the welfare gains from programs such as the EITC.

32:1110:76344:27:20:74:519:298:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The preceding two sections have considered studies that analyze local changes in marginal tax

32:1112:76527:21:20:74:519:257:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:important strand of the literature on labor supply accounts for the entire tax system by
32:1113:76615:20:20:74:519:237:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimating non-linear budget set (NLBS) models of labor supply.  Frictions can also explain
32:1114:76706:20:21:74:338:217:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:various patterns in the non-linear budget set literature.
32:1115:76763:21:20:91:519:196:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:(i) Bunching at Kinks.  Frictionless NLBS models are rejected by the data because they
32:1116:76849:20:20:74:519:176:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:predict much more bunching at kinks than observed in practice.  This is illustrated in Figure
32:1117:76942:20:21:74:519:156:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:11, which plots the income tax schedule in 2006 (dashed blue line) for a single Öler with two

32:1120:77234:14:0:74:514:105:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:be 10 times larger on the extensive margin in order to generate the same impacts as on the intensive margin.

33:1122:77430:20:21:74:519:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:predicts sharp spikes (mass points) at each kink in a kernel density plot of the income distri-
33:1123:77525:21:20:74:519:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:bution.  However, empirical income distributions for wage earners exhibit no such bunching
33:1124:77615:20:20:74:519:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:at kinks (Saez 2010).  Small frictions in choosing labor supply can explain why bunching is
33:1125:77706:20:21:74:519:619:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:not more prevalent.  The number next to each convex kink in Figure 11 shows the utility
33:1126:77793:21:20:74:519:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:gain as a percentage of consumption (calculated using the utility in (21) from locating at that

33:1128:77982:20:21:74:520:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:bracket continues into the next bracket.26The utility losses are less than 1% of net earnings
33:1129:78075:21:20:74:173:537:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:at most of the kinks.

33:1131:78186:20:21:74:519:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:models are to introduce optimization errors that smooth the income distribution around the
33:1132:78276:21:20:74:519:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:kink (e.g. Hausman 1981, Blomquist and Hansson-Brusewitz 1990) or to smooth the budget
33:1133:78362:20:20:74:519:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:set itself (MaCurdy, Green, and Paarsche 1990).  The approach proposed here ñpermitting
33:1134:78449:20:21:74:519:436:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:agents to deviate systematically from their frictionless optima provided that the utility losses
33:1135:78545:21:20:74:519:415:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:fall below some threshold ñplaces more structure on the nature of these optimization errors
33:1136:78636:20:20:74:270:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:and could thereby improve identiÖcation.
33:1137:78676:20:20:91:519:375:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:(ii) Bunching among the Self-Employed. Saez (2010) documents that unlike wage earners,
33:1138:78762:20:21:74:519:355:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:self-employed individuals bunch at the Örst kink of the EITC schedule, where tax refunds
33:1139:78850:21:20:74:519:334:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are maximized.  Audit studies show that self employment income is frequently misreported
33:1140:78938:20:20:74:519:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:on tax returns because of the lack of double reporting.   Unlike changing actual hours of
33:1141:79027:20:21:74:519:294:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:work, misreporting generates a Örst-order utility gain because it transfers resources from the
33:1142:79121:21:20:74:519:273:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:government to the taxpayer.  The large utility gains from misreporting taxable income could
33:1143:79212:20:20:74:431:253:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:B:explain why the self-employed overcome frictions and bunch at this kink.27
33:1144:79286:20:21:91:519:233:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:(iii) Notches. Unlike kinks, notches in budget sets, where a $1 change in earnings leads to a
33:1145:79379:21:20:74:519:212:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:discontinuous jump in consumption, generate substantial behavioral responses. For example,
33:1146:79469:20:20:74:519:192:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:income cuto§s to qualify for Medicaid (Yelowitz 1995) and social security beneÖts in some
33:1147:79558:20:17:74:519:172:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:pension systems (Gruber and Wise 1999) induce sharp reductions in labor supply. To calculate
33:1148:79650:17:15:83:519:155:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:26There are many values ofaithat can induce individuals to locate at each kink.  The numbers in the Ögure
33:1149:79755:15:7:74:445:140:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:are (unweighted) mean percentage losses for agents who would optimally locate at the kink.
33:1150:79845:7:15:83:519:133:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:27Even the self-employed do not bunch at the second kink of the EITC schedule (where the phase-out region
33:1151:79950:15:11:74:519:118:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:begins).  The Örst kink in the EITC schedule maximizes the size of the EITC refund while minimizing payroll
33:1152:80057:11:11:74:519:107:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:tax liabilities.  There is no reason to locate at the second kink if oneís goal is to reap Örst-order gains from
33:1153:80169:11:0:74:161:96:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:income manipulation.

34:1155:80278:20:21:74:520:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Then the utility cost of settinglt> K=wfor an individual withl-t-K=wexceedsP. Because
34:1156:80363:21:20:74:519:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the utility cost of ignoring a notch increases at a Örst-order rate with the size of the penalty

34:1158:80552:20:29:74:413:619:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:promising source of variation for identiÖcation of structural elasticities.

34:1160:80660:28:20:74:519:562:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:The Önal strand of the literature I consider is the debate on micro vs. macro labor supply
34:1161:80750:20:20:74:519:542:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:elasticities. Macroeconomic models calibrate labor supply elasticities to match the variation in
34:1162:80846:20:21:74:519:522:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:aggregate hours of work across countries with di§erent tax systems or over the business cycle.

34:1169:81500:21:20:74:519:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:two reasons.  First, both intensive and extensive margin responses are determined by micro-
34:1170:81591:20:20:74:519:359:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:economic household-level choices.  Second, the Frisch (marginal utility constant) elasticity is
34:1171:81686:20:21:74:519:339:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:important for understanding business cycle áuctuations, but does not control the steady-state

34:1181:82538:14:7:74:310:145:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:across studies arise simply from di§erences in terminology.
34:1182:82597:7:15:83:519:138:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:29The well known elasticity of 3 reported by Prescott (2004) is a Frisch elasticity.  Regressing log hours on

34:1184:82817:11:11:74:519:112:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:elasticity of 0.46.  Prescott translates the Hicksian elasticity of 0.7 into a Frisch elasticity of 3 based on speciÖc

35:1190:83282:20:21:74:519:619:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:for optimization frictions.  On the intensive margin, even the smallest estimates in Table I
35:1191:83374:21:20:74:519:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:B:are consistent with a structural elasticity of 0.33 with-=  1%frictions.  The minimum--

35:1193:83553:20:21:74:519:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:macroeconomic comparisons are more likely to overcome frictions because they analyze steady-
35:1194:83645:21:20:74:519:537:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:state behavior and because they induce coordinated changes in work patterns (Altonji and

36:1257:87438:31:21:74:519:174:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:There are many frictions that induce agents to deviate from the optimal choices predicted

36:1259:87614:16:15:83:519:137:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:30An interesting question left for future work is whether the structural or observed elasticity is more relevant
36:1260:87726:15:10:74:519:122:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:for business cycle áuctuations. If there are small áuctuations in wage rates over the business cycle, the observed
36:1261:87840:10:11:74:519:112:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:elasticity (attenuated by frictions) may be the better predictor of behavioral responses.  But if a small group
36:1262:87951:11:11:74:519:101:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:of individuals face very large wage shocks, then frictions may be overcome and the structural elasticity may be
36:1263:88062:11:0:74:131:90:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:more relevant.
37:1264:88078:0:20:74:519:700:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:arises from the omission of these frictions can be handled using the tools of set identiÖcation.
37:1265:88174:20:21:74:519:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Abstractly, I exchange the standard orthogonality condition on the error term for a bounded

37:1270:88629:20:20:74:519:578:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of this literature.  The critique is that many microeconometric studies of labor supply are
37:1271:88720:20:21:74:519:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:B:uninformative about intensive margin elasticities because they cannot reject large values of"

37:1273:88905:20:20:74:519:517:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:patterns in this literature can be reconciled by allowing for such small frictions.  Combining
37:1274:88999:20:21:74:519:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:estimates from several studies, my preferred point estimates of structural Hicksian elasticities
37:1275:89095:21:20:74:519:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:are 0.33 on the intensive margin, 0.25 on the extensive margin, and roughly 0.5 for aggregate
37:1276:89188:20:20:74:519:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:hours. I also Önd that Frisch elasticities cannot be much larger than Hicksian elasticities given

37:1279:89397:20:20:74:519:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:in future work. Methodologically, it is important to extend the bounds to settings beyond the

37:1281:89581:20:21:74:519:355:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:di§erence estimates and regression models that allow for continuous price variation. It would
37:1282:89674:21:20:74:519:334:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:also be interesting to explore whether the bounds can be sharpened by imposing additional
37:1283:89763:20:20:74:519:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:restrictions from theory, such as a requirement that agents converge to unconstrained optima
37:1284:89855:20:21:74:519:294:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:over time.  In the labor supply application, it would be useful to calculate bounds in modern
37:1285:89948:21:20:74:519:273:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:structural models of labor supply that incorporate factors such as human capital accumulation,
37:1286:90042:20:20:74:519:253:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:credit constraints, and uncertainty.  Because full identiÖcation of these models is challenging,
37:1287:90138:20:21:74:492:233:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:bounding the structural elasticity may be a particularly fruitful approach in such cases.
37:1288:90227:21:20:91:519:212:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:Finally, the bounding methodology developed here can be applied to estimate a variety
37:1289:90312:20:20:74:519:192:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:of other critical parameters such as the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, the marginal

37:1291:90492:21:20:74:519:151:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Such analyses would shed light on which disagreements are economically signiÖcant and which

42:1446:101375:26:14:91:519:649:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:This section establishes two results.   First, the bounds in Proposition 1 apply to the

46:1665:109566:14:13:91:519:686:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:This appendix describes how the values in columns 3-5 Table I are calculated. The papers

46:1667:109748:14:13:74:419:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:at http://obs.rc.fas.harvard.edu/chetty/bounds_opt_meta_analysis.zip
46:1668:109816:13:14:91:519:646:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:I use compensated intensive margin estimates reported in each paper when available and
46:1669:109902:14:13:74:519:632:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:use the Slutsky equation to calculate compensated elasticities in cases where uncompensated
46:1670:109993:13:14:74:188:619:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:elasticities are reported.
46:1671:110019:14:13:91:519:605:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:The studies do not always directly report the relevant inputs, especially the net-of-tax

46:1673:110197:14:13:74:520:578:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(e.g. Feldstein 1995), I deÖne- log(1--)as the change in the marginal NTR for the group
46:1674:110284:13:14:74:519:565:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that the authorsídeÖne as the ìtreatedîgroup.  For studies that pool multiple tax or wage
46:1675:110373:14:14:74:519:551:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:changes of di§erent sizes and do not explicitly isolate a treatment group (e.g. Gruber and
46:1676:110463:14:13:74:519:537:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Saez 2002), I deÖne- log(1--)as twice the standard deviation of- log (1-MTR)in the
46:1677:110545:13:14:74:519:524:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:sample.  The logic for this approach is as follows. In a linear regressionYi=-+\f1Xi+ui,
46:1678:110633:14:13:74:519:510:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:the standard error of^\f1is the square root of(var(u)=var(X))=NwhereNis the sample
46:1679:110715:13:14:74:519:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:size.  Consider a second regressionYi=-+\f2Zi+ui, whereZi= 0for half the observations
46:1680:110800:14:13:74:519:483:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:(the ìcontrol groupî) andZi=  2-SD(X)for the remaining observations (the ìtreatment
46:1681:110883:13:14:74:519:470:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:groupî).  Setting the size of the single treatment to2-SD(X)yieldsvar(Z)  =var(X).
46:1682:110965:14:13:74:519:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:Hence, the standard error of^\f2equals the standard error of^\f1.   A single tax change of
46:1683:111055:13:14:74:520:443:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f4:B:2-SD(- log(1-MTR))therefore produces an estimate ofb"with the same precision as the
46:1684:111138:14:14:74:370:429:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:original variation in marginal tax rates used for identiÖcation.
46:1685:111202:14:13:91:519:415:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A:I calculate the bounds by assuming that agents face a linear budget set whose slope is
46:1686:111288:13:14:74:519:402:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:given by their marginal tax rate (MTR) and apply Proposition A1 using- log(1-MTR)in
46:1687:111371:14:13:74:519:388:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:place of- logp. This yields valid bounds on"for agents who remain in the interior of budget
46:1688:111462:13:14:74:519:375:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:segments in a progressive tax system.  However, the bounds cannot be applied to agents who
46:1689:111552:14:13:74:519:361:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:locate at kinks.  Given that most of the studies in Table I estimate elasticities from changes
46:1690:111646:13:14:74:435:348:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:B:in the behavior of agents away from kinks, this is not a serious limitation.32

46:1697:112141:13:14:74:520:241:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:not reported in the paper, so I use2-SD= 2-(0:1522+ 2-0:0862)1=2from Table 1, column

46:1699:112317:13:14:74:519:214:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:wages. Note that this is likely an overestimate of the size of- log(1--), resulting in bounds
46:1700:112410:14:13:74:519:200:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:that are too tight, because MaCurdy uses family background characteristics, age, and year

46:1703:112600:14:14:83:519:159:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:32Recent studies that identify observed elasticities from bunching at kinks (e.g. Saez 2009, Chetty et al. 2011)
46:1704:112712:14:11:74:519:145:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:are an exception.  I incorporate these studies into the linear-demand framework by exploiting the fact that
46:1705:112819:11:11:74:520:134:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:they also studymovementsin the kinks over time, which create reductions in marginal rates for the subgroup
46:1706:112925:11:11:74:519:123:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:of individuals located between the old and new bracket cuto§s. These studies imply that these individuals do
46:1707:113033:11:11:74:519:112:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:not increase labor supply signiÖcantly when their marginal tax rates are lowered.  This constitutes an observed
46:1708:113144:11:0:74:458:101:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:F:elasticity estimate based on choices at interior optima, permitting application of Proposition 1.

47:1712:113507:14:13:74:519:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:rebate, which raised theaveragenet of tax rate by 0.042 for a couple earning $15,000 with
47:1713:113596:13:14:74:519:646:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B:two children (for whom the average net-of-tax rate changed from 107.5% in 1993 to 112.1%
