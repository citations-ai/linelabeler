2:34:2013:14:14:71:539:560:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:costs or inattention? I derive bounds on structural price elasticities that are a function of the observed
2:35:2119:14:14:71:539:546:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:effect of a price change on demand, the size of the price change, and the degree of frictions. The degree
2:36:2224:14:14:71:539:532:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of frictions is measured by the utility losses agents tolerate to deviate from the frictionless optimum.
2:37:2328:14:14:71:539:518:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The bounds imply that frictions affect intensive margin elasticities much more than extensive margin
2:38:2428:14:14:71:539:504:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:elasticities. I apply these bounds to the literature on labor supply. The utility costs of ignoring the tax
2:39:2535:14:14:71:539:490:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:changes used to identify intensive margin labor supply elasticities are typically less than 1% of earnings.
2:40:2642:14:14:71:539:476:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:As a result, small frictions can explain the differences between micro and macro elasticities, extensive

3:51:3110:0:31:74:187:700:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:1  Introduction
3:52:3125:31:20:74:519:669:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The identiÖcation of structural parameters of stylized models is one of the central tasks of
3:53:3217:20:21:74:519:649:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:applied economics.   Unfortunately, most models omit various frictions that make agents
3:54:3304:21:20:74:519:628:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:deviate systematically from their theoretical predictions.  For instance, canonical models of
3:55:3397:20:20:74:519:608:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:labor supply or consumption behavior do not permit adjustment costs, inattentive agents,
3:56:3485:20:21:74:519:588:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:or status quo biases.  How can structural parameters be identiÖed when agents face such
3:57:3572:21:20:74:181:567:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:optimization frictions?
3:58:3595:20:20:91:519:547:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:One natural solution is to estimate the structural parameters of a model that incorporates
3:59:3685:20:21:74:519:527:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the frictions. This approach has two limitations in practice. First, it is di¢ cult to incorporate
3:60:3783:21:20:74:519:506:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:all frictions in a tractable model.  Second, estimating even simple dynamic models with fric-
3:61:3876:20:20:74:519:486:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:tions, such as Ss adjustment, requires strong assumptions and is computationally challenging
3:62:3968:20:21:74:519:466:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(Attanasio 2000). Motivated by these limitations, I propose an alternative solution: bounding
3:63:4061:21:20:74:466:445:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:structural preference parameters without identifying how frictions a§ect behavior.
3:64:4143:20:20:91:519:425:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:I analyze a standard dynamic lifecycle model in which the e§ect of income-compensated
3:65:4228:20:21:74:520:405:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(Hicksian) price changes on demand is determined by a structural parameter of utility".  I
3:66:4318:21:20:74:519:384:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:introduce optimization frictions into this nominal model through an error term in the demand
3:67:4410:20:20:74:519:364:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:function whose conditional expectation is unknown.  These optimization errors generate dif-
3:68:4501:20:21:74:519:344:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:ferences between mean observed demand and the mean optimal demand predicted by the
3:69:4583:21:20:74:519:323:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:frictionless model.  Because the optimization errors need not be orthogonal to the price, the
3:70:4676:20:20:74:519:303:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:observed Hicksian elasticityb"estimated from demand responses to a price change di§ers from
3:71:4767:20:21:74:520:283:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the structural elasticity parameter". The observed elasticityb"confounds preferences (") with
3:72:4860:21:20:74:519:262:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the e§ect of the frictions.  For example, agents may under-react to a price increase in the
3:73:4951:20:20:74:258:242:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:short-run because of adjustment costs.
3:74:4989:20:21:91:519:222:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:This paper seeks to identify"from estimates ofb".  I focus on identifying"because it is
3:75:5076:21:20:74:519:201:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:important for both positive and normative analysis. The impacts of prices in steady-state are
3:76:5169:20:20:74:519:181:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:determined purely by"in many models.  Moreover, the recovery of preference parameters is
3:77:5257:20:21:74:212:161:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:essential for welfare analysis.
3:78:5288:21:20:91:520:140:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:I bound"from observations ofb"by assuming that agents choose points near the friction-
3:79:5374:20:20:74:519:120:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:less optimum.  SpeciÖcally, I allow agents to deviate arbitrarily from the nominal modelís
3:80:5464:20:0:74:520:100:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:prediction as long as the expected lifetime utility cost of doing so is less than-percent of
4:81:5557:0:20:74:519:700:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:expenditure.  This property is satisÖed by standard dynamic adjustment cost models, where
4:82:5646:20:21:74:519:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:agents remain on average within some utility threshold of their optimum. In the case of other
4:83:5739:21:20:74:519:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:frictions such as inattention or status quo biases, this restriction requires that agents respond
4:84:5836:20:20:74:285:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to incentives that are su¢ ciently important.
4:85:5881:20:21:91:519:619:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:I derive a closed-form representation for bounds on the structural Hicksian elasticity"as a
4:86:5972:21:20:74:519:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:function of the observed Hicksian elasticityb", the size of the price change used for identiÖcation
4:87:6071:20:20:74:520:578:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f4:- logp, and the degree of frictions-.1The bounds shed light on what can be learned from
4:88:6158:20:21:74:519:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:reduced-form elasticity estimates in an environment with frictions.  The bounds shrink at a
4:89:6249:21:20:74:519:537:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:quadratic rate with- logp. As a result, pooling several small price changes ñalthough useful
4:90:6341:20:20:74:519:517:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:in improving statistical precision ñyields less information about the structural elasticity than
4:91:6437:20:21:74:519:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:studying a few large price changes.  Ifb" >0, the lower bound on the structural elasticity"is
4:92:6530:21:20:74:519:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:strictly positive, showing that frictions do not a§ect tests of a null hypothesis of zero response.
4:93:6629:20:20:74:519:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:If the observed elasticityb"= 0, the upper bound on"can be expressed in terms of the utility
4:94:6721:20:21:74:519:436:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:cost of ignoring the price change.  This permits straightforward calculations of the range of
4:95:6814:21:20:74:519:415:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:elasticities consistent with zero behavioral response, analogous to power calculations used to
4:96:6908:20:20:74:211:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:evaluate statistical precision.
4:97:6939:20:20:91:519:375:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The preceding results apply to an intensive margin model in which consumption is perfectly
4:98:7029:20:21:74:519:355:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:divisible.  I also derive bounds on extensive margin elasticities by analyzing a model in which
4:99:7124:21:20:74:519:334:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:agents choose whether to buy an indivisible good.  The bounds on the structural extensive
4:100:7213:20:20:74:520:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:margin elasticity (-) shrink linearly with-and are therefore an order of magnitude tighter
4:101:7303:20:21:74:519:294:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:than those on the Hicksian intensive margin elasticity ("). The bounds are tighter because the
4:102:7397:21:20:74:519:273:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:utility costs of ignoring price changes are Örst-order on the extensive margin, in contrast with
4:103:7493:20:20:74:519:253:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the second-order costs on the intensive margin.  Hence, frictions such as adjustment costs or
4:104:7586:20:21:74:519:233:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:inattention have smaller e§ects on aggregate demand when microeconomic choices are discrete
4:105:7677:21:20:74:186:212:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:rather than continuous.
4:106:7700:20:20:91:520:192:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:One can obtain tighter bounds on"or-by calculating the least upper bound and the largest
4:107:7788:20:21:74:519:172:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:lower bound implied by multiple observed elasticities.  The sensitivity of structural elasticity
4:108:7884:21:20:74:519:151:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:estimates to frictions can be evaluated by computing these uniÖed bounds as a function of
4:109:7973:20:16:74:520:131:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:-.  The smallest level of frictions-minthat reconciles a group of observed elasticities provides

4:111:8172:15:0:74:470:100:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:that aggregate welfare would be 1% higher absent frictions (-= 1%) to be a plausible benchmark.
5:112:8268:0:20:74:519:700:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:measures the ìeconomic signiÖcanceî of the di§erences in estimates.  If-minis small, the
5:113:8356:20:21:74:519:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:di§erences are not economically signiÖcant in that they can be explained simply by allowing for
5:114:8451:21:20:74:519:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:small frictions. The value of"or-when-=-minconverges to the true value as the number of
5:115:8538:20:20:74:519:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:observed elasticities grows large, providing a point estimate of the structural elasticity adjusted
5:116:8637:20:21:74:132:619:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:for frictions.
5:117:8651:21:20:91:519:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:I apply these methods to investigate what can be learned about structural labor supply
5:118:8737:20:20:74:519:578:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:elasticities from the empirical literature on labor supply.  The application consists of four
5:119:8830:20:21:74:481:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:components, each of which addresses a di§erent strand of the labor supply literature.
5:120:8915:21:20:91:519:537:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:First, I analyze the impact of frictions on the intensive margin elasticity ñthe e§ects of tax
5:121:9009:20:20:74:519:517:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:changes on hours of work for employed individuals. Based on a large body of microeconometric
5:122:9101:20:21:74:519:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:evidence, ìthe profession has settled on a value for this elasticity close to zeroî(Saez, Slemrod,
5:123:9199:21:20:74:519:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and Giertz 2011).  I show that small frictions could explain why observed elasticities are
5:124:9289:20:20:74:519:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:often near zero by calculating the utility costs of ignoring tax reforms.  For instance, the
5:125:9381:20:21:74:519:436:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:utility costs of ignoring the widely studied Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA86) ñand instead

5:127:9558:20:20:74:519:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:for all except top income earners.  Accordingly, empirical studies Önd that TRA86 induced
5:128:9647:20:20:74:519:375:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:behavioral responses in the short run only for top income earners.  To assess what can be
5:129:9736:20:21:74:519:355:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:learned about"from existing estimates of intensive margin labor supply elasticities, I calculate
5:130:9832:21:20:74:520:334:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:bounds on"using estimates from studies of hours elasticities, taxable income elasticities,
5:131:9922:20:20:74:519:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:elasticities for top income earners, and macroeconomic cross-country estimates. Even though
5:132:10013:20:21:74:519:294:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the observed elasticity estimates vary widely, all the estimates are consistent with a single

5:135:10286:20:21:74:520:233:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of(0:28;0:54)when-= 1%, with a 95% conÖdence interval of(0:23;0:61).  The minimum
5:136:10367:21:20:74:519:212:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:level of frictions required to reconcile these Öfteen estimates is-min= 0:5%of net earnings
5:137:10458:20:20:74:503:192:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and the corresponding point estimate of the structural Hicksian elasticity is"--min= 0:33.
5:138:10548:20:21:91:519:172:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Second, I analyze how frictions a§ect extensive margin elasticities ñ the e§ects of tax
5:139:10635:21:20:74:519:151:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:changes on employment rates.  The utility costs of ignoring tax changes on the extensive
5:140:10723:20:20:74:519:131:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:margin are between 5 to 10% of income for many tax policy changes in the U.S.  These
5:141:10807:20:21:74:519:111:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:large costs could explain why microeconometric studies uniformly detect signiÖcant impacts
5:142:10897:21:0:74:519:90:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of tax changes on employment rates despite Önding negligible intensive margin responses.
6:143:10986:0:20:74:519:700:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:This result challenges the prevailing consensus that extensive margin elasticities are much
6:144:11077:20:21:74:519:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:larger than intensive margin elasticities.  Instead, current empirical methods may simply be
6:145:11169:21:20:74:519:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:better suited to detecting responses on the extensive margin than the intensive margin in the
6:146:11262:20:20:74:519:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:presence of frictions.  I calculate bounds on the structural extensive margin elasticity-using
6:147:11356:20:21:74:519:619:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:estimates from existing studies.  The bounds on the extensive margin elasticities implied by
6:148:11448:21:20:74:519:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:each study are very tight, conÖrming that observed elasticities provide accurate estimates of
6:149:11541:20:20:74:519:578:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:structural elasticities on the extensive margin.  The mean extensive margin elasticity among
6:150:11633:20:21:74:301:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the microeconometric studies I consider is0:25.
6:151:11680:21:20:91:519:537:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Third, I turn to the literature on non-linear budget set estimation, which analyzes the
6:152:11767:20:20:74:519:517:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:impacts of progressive income taxation on labor supply.  One well known issue in Ötting such
6:153:11859:20:21:74:519:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:models is that much fewer individuals bunch at kink points of the tax system than one would
6:154:11950:21:20:74:519:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:predict in a frictionless model (Saez 2010). I show that the utility gains from bunching at kinks
6:155:12047:20:20:74:519:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:are very small, typically less than 1% of consumption.  Allowing for optimization frictions in
6:156:12141:20:21:74:519:436:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:NLBS models can explain the lack of bunching at most kinks and provide a more disciplined
6:157:12230:21:20:74:225:415:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:error structure for such models.
6:158:12262:20:20:91:519:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Finally, I assess whether frictions can explain the discrepancy between micro and macro es-
6:159:12353:20:20:74:519:375:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:timates of Hicksian (steady-state) and Frisch (intertemporal substitution) elasticities.  Macro
6:160:12448:20:21:74:519:355:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:estimates of the Hicksian elasticity, which are based on cross-country comparisons, are larger
6:161:12542:21:20:74:519:334:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:than micro estimates.  Frictions and indivisible labor (Rogerson 1988, Rogerson and Walle-
6:162:12632:20:20:74:519:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f7:nius 2009) fully account for this gap. On the intensive margin, the micro estimate of"= 0:33
6:163:12724:20:21:74:519:294:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:after accounting for frictions matches cross-country evidence.  On the extensive margin, mi-
6:164:12816:21:20:74:519:273:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:cro estimates match macro cross-country estimates even without accounting for frictions, as
6:165:12907:20:20:74:519:253:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:expected given the results above. Macro estimates of the Frisch elasticity, which are based on
6:166:13001:20:21:74:519:233:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:áuctuations in labor supply over the business cycle, are also larger than micro estimates of the
6:167:13097:21:20:74:519:212:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Frisch elasticity. To assess whether this discrepancy can be explained by frictions, I bound the
6:168:13193:20:20:74:519:192:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:structural intensive margin Frisch elasticity using the estimated structural Hicksian elasticity.
6:169:13290:20:21:74:519:172:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The bound on the intensive Frisch elasticity is consistent with macro evidence on áuctuations
6:170:13383:21:20:74:519:151:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:in hours conditional on employment over the business cycle. However, micro estimates are not
6:171:13475:20:20:74:519:131:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:consistent with macro evidence on the extensive margin intertemporal subsitution elasticity, as
6:172:13570:20:21:74:519:111:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:shown in Chetty et al. (2011b).  I conclude that frictions explain the gap between micro and
6:173:13662:21:0:74:519:90:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:macro estimates of steady-state elasticities relevant for cross-country comparisons, but can-
7:174:13756:0:20:74:519:700:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:not reconcile the di§erences between micro and macro estimates of intertemporal substitution
7:175:13848:20:21:74:258:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:elasticities relevant for business cycles.
7:176:13890:21:20:91:519:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The analysis here should be viewed as one step toward characterizing how frictions a§ect
7:177:13978:20:20:74:519:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:labor supply elasticities.  The results are based on a standard lifecycle model of labor supply
7:178:14073:20:21:74:519:619:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:as in MaCurdy (1981) and do not account for factors incorporated into more recent models,
7:179:14162:21:20:74:519:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:such as human capital accumulation, credit constraints, or uncertainty.   One would have
7:180:14250:20:20:74:519:578:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to specify a nominal model that incorporates all of these structural features to bound labor
7:181:14342:20:21:74:519:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:supply elasticities in such an environment.  This point illustrates a more general caveat: the
7:182:14436:21:20:74:519:537:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:ability to account for frictions using bounds does not provide an excuse for failing to build an
7:183:14532:20:20:74:519:517:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:accurate model. The bounds are valid only if the nominal model is correct up to optimization
7:184:14624:20:21:74:116:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:frictions.
7:185:14634:21:20:91:519:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:This paper builds upon and relates to the partial identiÖcation, near rationality, robust
7:186:14723:20:20:74:519:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:control, and durable goods literatures.  The econometric literature on partial or set identiÖ-
7:187:14817:20:21:74:519:436:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:cation addresses problems such as missing data or imperfect instruments (Manski 2007, Nevo
7:188:14907:21:20:74:519:415:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and Rosen 2008). The present paper uses set identiÖcation to estimate structural parameters
7:189:14998:20:20:74:519:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:with model mis-speciÖcation. I derive bounds by assuming that agents are ìnear rational,îas
7:190:15089:20:20:74:519:375:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:in the menu cost and near rationality literature in macroeconomics (Akerlof and Yellen 1985,
7:191:15181:20:21:74:519:355:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Mankiw 1985, Cochrane 1989). The focus on a class of models around a pre-speciÖed nominal
7:192:15270:21:20:74:519:334:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:model parallels the robust control literature (Hansen and Sargent 2007).  The robust control
7:193:15362:20:20:74:519:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:literature analyzes optimal policy with a minimax criterion and model uncertainty, whereas
7:194:15452:20:21:74:519:294:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:I consider identiÖcation of the nominal modelís parameters in the same setting.   Finally,
7:195:15542:21:20:74:519:273:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the bounds provide an alternative method of estimating preferences or production functions
7:196:15632:20:20:74:519:253:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:in models with adjustment costs.  This approach requires fewer assumptions than existing
7:197:15720:20:21:74:519:233:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:methods of identifying such models (e.g. Eberly 1994, Attanasio 2000) because it uses inputs
7:198:15812:21:20:74:519:212:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:that can be estimated using quasi-experimental techniques.  However, it does not permit as
7:199:15902:20:20:74:519:192:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:rich an analysis of short-run counterfactuals because it only partially identiÖes the modelís

15:511:32461:32:20:91:519:372:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f8:Lemma 1 captures three intuitions. First, the width of the choice set, which is2[2"\u000e]1=2
15:512:32554:20:21:74:519:352:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:log units, shrinks at a square-root rate as-goes to zero.  This result implies that even small

15:515:32824:20:21:74:520:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:as illustrated in Figure 1. The root--shrinkage of the choice set is driven by the second-order
15:516:32919:21:20:74:519:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:losses of deviating from the maximum of a smooth function (Akerlof and Yellen 1985, Mankiw
15:517:33009:20:20:74:103:250:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:1985).
15:518:33015:20:21:91:519:230:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Second, equation (10) shows that the width of the choice set is inversely related to the

15:520:33197:20:20:74:519:189:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f4:u00i;t(x-i;t)is pinned down by", the structural parameter of interest.  Highly curved utilities
15:521:33292:20:21:74:519:169:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:generate small structural elasticities because the agent has a strong preference to locate near

15:523:33481:20:20:74:519:128:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:at a levelx-i;t.  The price elasticity of demand approaches zero as the curvature of the utility

15:525:33671:21:0:74:519:87:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:utility by not having it.  Because the utility costs of deviating fromx-i;tare inÖnitely large,

17:586:36550:20:21:74:519:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:elasticities from reduced-form estimates of observed elasticities. First, larger price changes are
17:587:36648:21:20:74:519:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:much more informative about"because the bounds shrink at a quadratic rate with- logp.

17:590:36906:21:20:74:520:415:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:rapid shrinkage is that the movement in the choice sets for a given value of"is larger when

17:593:37092:20:21:91:519:355:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Second, the bounds are asymmetric around the observed elasticity:"U-b" >b"-"L. This
17:594:37175:21:20:74:519:334:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:asymmetry is driven by the proportional relationship between the width of the choice sets
17:595:37264:20:20:74:519:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and", as shown in Lemma 1.  Large structural elasticities generate wide choice sets and are
17:596:37355:20:21:74:520:294:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:therefore consistent with a broader range ofb"than small structural elasticities.  A related
17:597:37447:21:20:74:520:273:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:implication is that if"is small, there will be little dispersion in observed elasticities across
17:598:37543:20:20:74:471:253:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:studies, whereas a large"may lead to substantial variation in observed elasticities.
17:599:37627:20:21:91:520:233:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Third, the lower bound is strictly positive ("L>0) wheneverb" >0regardless of-.  If

17:605:38151:7:15:83:519:143:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:10These bounds are computed using (14), which relies on a quadratic approximation to utility.  To evaluate

18:612:38788:20:20:91:519:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Finally, consider the converse case of a study that detects zero observed behavioral response

23:818:52431:20:21:74:519:177:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:wage elasticity of labor supply, Proposition A1 can be used to bound the structural labor supply

24:826:53006:20:21:74:519:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:might substantially attenuate observed elasticities (Corollary 1).  I then calculate bounds on

25:866:55803:21:20:74:519:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:costs of ignoring this tax reform. Panel A shows the marginal tax rate schedules in 1985 (thick
25:867:55898:20:20:74:519:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:red line) and 1988 (thin blue line).  The dashed blue line, which is replicated in all the panels

25:869:56083:21:20:74:519:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:TRA86 increased the NTR by 15-20% for those with incomes below $100,000 and by nearly
25:870:56168:20:20:74:293:578:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:40% for those with incomes close to $200,000.

25:874:56474:20:21:74:519:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:by failing to reoptimize labor supply in response to the change in the tax code.   Panel

25:878:56833:21:20:74:519:415:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:1, this result implies that frictions of-= 1%could lead to an observed elasticity ofb"= 0from
25:879:56926:20:20:74:519:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:TRA86 for an individual earning less than $100,000 even if his underlying structural elasticity

25:881:57034:20:21:91:519:355:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Finally, Panel D plots the change in taxable income (wl-i;1988-wl-i;1985) required to reop-

25:883:57211:20:20:74:519:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:would have to increase his pre-tax earnings by $13,000 in order to reach his new optimum.
25:884:57300:20:21:74:519:294:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:This substantial change would yield a utility gain (net of the disutility of added labor) of only
25:885:57397:21:20:74:519:273:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:$1,000. Given that the search costs of immediately Önding additional work that pays an extra
25:886:57489:20:20:74:519:253:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:$13,000 could well exceed $1,000, it is plausible that many individuals would not respond to
25:887:57581:20:16:74:254:233:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:TRA86 within a three-year horizon.20
25:888:57617:16:15:83:519:217:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:18Values at non-convex kinks in the base year are interpolated to obtain a continuous curve.   Since no
25:889:57720:15:7:74:478:202:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:individual would optimally locate at a non-convex kink, the utility cost is undeÖned at these points.
25:890:57821:7:15:83:519:195:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:19Corollary 1 applies to individuals who are at an interior optimum both before and after the tax change.  In
25:891:57930:15:11:74:519:180:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:particular, a tax change could produce an observed elasticityb"= 0if the level of frictions- >-ui;t;%(")=4for
25:892:58039:11:11:74:519:169:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:such individuals.  For individuals who optimally locate at kinks between tax brackets, the tangency conditions
25:893:58149:11:11:74:519:158:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:used to derive Corollary 1 do not hold.  However, even for these agents, it is clear that a tax change could
25:894:58257:11:7:74:202:147:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:produceb"= 0if- >-ui;t;%(").
25:895:58285:7:15:83:519:140:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:20The total lifetime gain from reoptimizing labor supply is much larger because the agent gains $1,000 every
25:896:58393:15:11:74:519:125:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:year.  However, because the áow utility gains are relatively small, many agents may delay adjustment until a
25:897:58501:11:11:74:519:114:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:period where frictions (e.g. job switching costs) are lower.  Thus, micro studies might not detect much change
25:898:58611:11:0:74:497:103:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:in labor supply between 1985 and 1988 even if TRA86 induced individuals to reoptimize in the long run.
26:899:58715:0:20:91:519:700:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The costs of ignoring TRA86 are considerably larger for high income earners. An individual
26:900:58805:20:21:74:519:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:earning $200,000 in 1985 would lose $4,500 per year (nearly 3% of net earnings) by ignoring
26:901:58896:21:20:74:519:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the tax reform.  High income individuals gain a lot more from reoptimizing both because
26:902:58983:20:20:74:519:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the dollars at stake rise with income and because the change in tax rates was larger for high
26:903:59076:20:21:74:115:619:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:incomes.
26:904:59084:21:20:91:519:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Figure 6a extends the analysis of tax reforms to cover all tax changes from 1970-2006.  I

26:909:59547:20:21:74:519:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:net earnings for the median taxpayer. The utility costs of ignoring tax reforms are substantial
26:910:59642:21:20:74:519:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:only for the top 1% of income earners around TRA86.  Correspondingly, the largest observed
26:911:59732:20:20:74:519:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:elasticities in historical time series are for top income earners around TRA86; for lower income
26:912:59828:20:21:74:519:436:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:groups and other time periods, observed intensive margin elasticities are near zero (Saez 2004).

26:915:60109:20:20:74:519:375:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:imposes little cost.  For example, using equation (15), the utility cost of ignoring a tax rate

26:921:60603:21:20:74:519:237:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:elasticity estimates? To answer this question, I apply Proposition A1 to calculate the bounds

26:923:60787:20:21:74:519:197:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:two caveats in mind when interpreting the results of the exercise.  First, I assume a constant
26:924:60881:21:20:74:520:176:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:structural elasticity"across all the studies, ignoring potential variation in local preferences
26:925:60976:20:20:74:519:156:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:across tax regimes, income levels, demographic groups, or countries.  Second, I assume that
26:926:61067:20:21:74:519:136:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:each study provides an unbiased estimate of the observed elasticityb".  Econometric issues
26:927:61157:21:20:74:519:115:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:such as omitted variables and mean reversion may bias some of the estimates (Saez, Slemrod,
26:928:61248:20:0:74:412:95:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and Giertz 2011).  Any such biases would pass through to the bounds.
27:929:61318:0:20:91:519:700:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Table I divides the studies of intensive margin labor supply into four groups: (A) studies
27:930:61408:20:21:74:519:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:that measure labor supply using hours of work; (B) studies that measure labor supply using
27:931:61498:21:20:74:519:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:taxable income; (C) studies that use taxable income but focus exclusively on top income earn-
27:932:61591:20:20:74:519:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:ers; and (D) studies that rely on cross-sectional comparisons (across countries with di§erent

27:935:61873:20:20:74:519:578:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and the change in the net-of-tax rate used for identiÖcation.  Details on the calculations and
27:936:61967:20:21:74:519:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:sources for each study are given in Appendix B. For quasi-experimental studies that analyze

27:939:62234:20:21:74:520:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:changes of di§erent sizes (e.g. Gruber and Saez 2002), I deÖne- log(1-MTR)as twice the

27:941:62411:20:20:74:519:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:that would generate the same statistical precision as the variation in- log(1-MTR)used for
27:942:62501:20:21:74:263:436:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:identiÖcation, as shown in Appendix B.
27:943:62539:21:20:91:519:415:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The observed elasticity estimates vary substantially across studies.   Microeconometric

27:946:62814:20:21:74:519:355:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:income earners Önd much larger elasticities, with a mean of 0.84.  The mean elasticity among
27:947:62906:21:20:74:342:334:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:macroeconomic studies of steady-state responses is 0.32.
27:948:62962:20:20:91:519:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The largest observed elasticities in Panels A and B are obtained from the studies that
27:949:63048:20:21:74:519:294:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:focus on the largest changes in tax policy: the abolition of the income tax for a year in Iceland

27:952:63325:20:21:74:519:233:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:are less likely to attenuate short-run responses to very large price changes.  Excluding the

27:954:63505:20:20:74:519:192:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:B is below all of the point estimates in Panels C and D.  Moreover, many of the conÖdence

27:956:63685:21:16:74:519:151:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:C and D. Hence, the systematic di§erences in point estimates of observed elasticities across
27:957:63777:16:14:83:519:135:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:21In the model in (19), the hours and taxable income elasticities are the same.  I therefore pool estimates
27:958:63884:14:11:74:519:121:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:from both types of studies to bound the structural labor supply elasticity in this model.  In more general
27:959:63990:11:11:74:519:110:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:models, taxable income elasticities may be larger than hours elasticities because they incorporate changes in
27:960:64099:11:0:74:409:99:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:reporting and avoidance behavior as well as changes in work e§ort (Slemrod 1995).
28:961:64182:0:20:74:460:700:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the studies in the di§erent groups cannot be explained by statistical imprecision.

28:964:64438:20:20:74:519:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:studies that use small tax changes are consistent with structural elasticities above 1 despite

28:966:64623:21:20:74:519:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:6-7.  For scaling purposes, I exclude studies that use variation in net-of-tax rates of less than
28:967:64720:20:20:74:519:578:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:20% for identiÖcation.  None of the intervals plotted in the Ögure are disjoint ñthat is, all

28:969:64903:21:20:74:519:537:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:frictions.  Hence, the di§erences in estimates across high and low income earners as well as
28:970:64995:20:20:74:519:517:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the di§erences in estimates across macroeconomic and microeconometric studies can be fully

30:1043:70534:21:20:74:268:392:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:this pattern could be driven by frictions.
30:1044:70576:20:20:91:519:372:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Panel A shows tax changes and utility costs on the intensive margin.  The dashed blue
30:1045:70661:20:21:74:519:352:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:line shows that between 1993 and 1996, net-of-tax wage rates rose by 20% for single tax Ölers
30:1046:70754:21:20:74:519:331:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:with two children earning below $10,000 as the phase-in subsidy was increased.  Meanwhile,
30:1047:70844:20:20:74:519:311:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:net-of-tax wages fell by roughly 15% for those with incomes between $15,000 and $30,000
30:1048:70931:20:21:74:519:291:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:because of the increase in the phase-out tax rate.  The solid red curve, constructed as in
30:1049:71021:21:20:74:519:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Figure 5c, shows that most individuals lose less than 1% of net earnings per year by ignoring
30:1050:71114:20:20:74:519:250:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f7:these changes on the intensive margin. Corollary 1 implies that an observed response ofb"= 0
30:1051:71206:20:21:74:519:230:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:would be consistent with"= 0:5if one permits-= 1%frictions in reoptimizing labor supply.

30:1053:71385:20:20:74:520:189:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:is the income that the individual would earn (wi) were he to work prior to the EITC expansion.
30:1054:71479:20:21:74:519:169:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:On the extensive margin, the relevant tax rates are average rather than marginal. The dashed
30:1055:71571:21:20:74:519:148:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:blue curve shows the change in net-of-average-tax rates (i.e., the return to working) as a result
30:1056:71668:20:20:74:519:128:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of this reform.  The solid red curve shows the utility cost of ignoring the EITC expansion for
30:1057:71762:20:21:74:519:108:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:individuals on the margin of entering the labor force at various income levels in 1993, which
30:1058:71855:21:0:74:519:87:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:coincides with the log change in the net of tax rate as shown in (17).  Consider an individual
31:1059:71951:0:20:74:519:700:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:who would earn $5,000 when working and is indi§erent between working and not working
31:1060:72035:20:21:74:519:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:in 1993, i.e. has disutility of workbi= 5000-T1993(5000).  Figure 9b shows that for this
31:1061:72123:21:20:74:519:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:marginal individual, the gain from entering the labor force in response to the Clinton EITC
31:1062:72214:20:20:74:519:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:expansion is 18% of net income when working, roughly $1,000.  In contrast, the gain from
31:1063:72302:20:21:74:519:619:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:reoptimizing hours on the intensive margin for a worker earning $5,000 prior to the reform is
31:1064:72395:21:20:74:519:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:0.7% of income, roughly $50.  On the extensive margin, the agent would have lost the extra
31:1065:72485:20:20:74:519:578:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:$1,000 EITC refund if he had ignored the tax reform and stayed out of the labor force.  But
31:1066:72576:20:21:74:519:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:on the intensive margin, a worker gets the $1,000 tax reduction even if he does not change his
31:1067:72670:21:20:74:519:537:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:hours.  This could explain why individuals respond to the EITC expansion in the short run
31:1068:72759:20:20:74:519:517:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:on the extensive margin despite frictions.  Indeed, Corollary 2 implies that one could observe
31:1069:72853:20:21:74:520:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:an elasticity ofb-= 0on the extensive margin only if frictions in adjusting labor supply exceed

31:1071:72989:20:20:91:519:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Figure 6b extends this analysis to cover all tax changes from 1970-2006. In contrast to the
31:1072:73080:20:21:74:519:436:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:intensive margin results shown in Figure 6a, there are several tax changes that would generate
31:1073:73174:21:20:74:520:415:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:large utility losses (5-10% of net earnings) if ignored on the extensive margin.23The utility
31:1074:73267:20:20:74:519:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:costs are particularly large for individuals who earn low incomes when working, consistent
31:1075:73357:20:29:74:457:375:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:with the literature Önding the largest extensive margin responses for this group.
31:1076:73438:29:27:74:400:346:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:4.2.2  Bounds on the Extensive Margin Hicksian Elasticity
31:1077:73495:27:21:74:519:319:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Chetty et al. (2011b, Table 1) present a meta analysis of extensive margin elasticity estimates.
31:1078:73591:21:20:74:519:298:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:In Table II, I apply Proposition 2 to calculate the bounds implied by the studies they consider
31:1079:73686:20:20:74:520:278:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:with-= 1%frictions.24Panel A considers estimates from quasi-experimental studies, while
31:1080:73773:20:21:74:519:258:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Panel B considers steady-state estimates from studies that exploit cross-sectional variation
31:1081:73865:21:20:74:409:237:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:across countries or individuals. Two results emerge from this analysis.
31:1082:73936:20:20:91:519:217:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:First, the bounds on extensive margin elasticities are much tighter than those on the
31:1083:74021:20:17:74:519:197:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:intensive margin, as shown in Figure 10.  For instance, Eissa and Liebmanís (1996) analysis
31:1084:74112:17:15:83:519:180:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:23In these calculations, I assume that the marginal worker is in the labor force in cases where the average tax
31:1085:74223:15:11:74:519:165:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:rates rises over the three years and out of the labor force for cases where it falls. This is the relevant calculation
31:1086:74341:11:11:74:519:154:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:to determine when one would observe zero response on the extensive margin, as shown above.  I exclude the
31:1087:74446:11:10:74:519:143:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:99.5 percentile from Figure 6b for scaling reasons and because few individuals enter the labor force at the 99.5
31:1088:74558:10:8:74:223:133:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:percentile of the income distribution.
31:1089:74596:8:14:83:519:125:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:24Among the studies considered by Chetty et al.  (2011), I include only those that estimate steady-state
31:1090:74700:14:0:74:466:111:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:elasticities and for which I was able to compute the size of the tax change used for identiÖcation.
32:1091:74801:0:20:74:518:700:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:of EITC expansions yieldsb-= 0:30and bounds on-of(0:26;0:36)with-= 1%frictions.25
32:1092:74882:20:21:74:519:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Observed labor supply elasticities appear to provide reasonably accurate estimates of structural
32:1093:74978:21:20:74:244:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:elasticities on the extensive margin.
32:1094:75015:20:20:91:519:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Second, the heterogeneity in extensive margin elasticities across groups cannot be at-
32:1095:75101:20:21:74:519:619:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:tributed purely to frictions. The minimum level of frictions required to reconcile the extensive
32:1096:75197:21:20:74:519:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:margin elasticities in Table II is-min= 18%.  Hence, there are economically signiÖcant dif-
32:1097:75288:20:20:74:519:578:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:ferences in structural extensive margin elasticities across groups.  For instance, it is plausible
32:1098:75386:20:21:74:519:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:that participation elasticities are especially large for low-income single mothers (Meyer and
32:1099:75479:21:20:74:519:537:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Rosenbaum 2001).  There may be similar heterogeneity in structural elasticities on the inten-
32:1100:75572:20:20:74:519:517:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:sive margin, but existing evidence is inadequate to detect such heterogeneity in the presence
32:1101:75665:20:21:74:157:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of small frictions.
32:1102:75684:21:20:91:519:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The results in Tables I and II challenge the commonly held view that extensive margin
32:1103:75769:20:20:74:519:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:elasticities are larger than intensive margin elasticities.  This view underpins some important
32:1104:75864:20:21:74:519:436:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:results in modern optimal tax theory, such as providing a rationale for programs such as the
32:1105:75956:21:20:74:519:415:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Earned Income Tax Credit (Saez 2002).  The analysis here suggests that estimated intensive
32:1106:76046:20:20:74:519:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:margin elasticities may be smaller than extensive elasticities simply because of frictions.  In
32:1107:76141:20:20:74:519:375:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:steady state, the intensive elasticity may actually be larger than extensive elasticities, reducing
32:1108:76240:20:30:74:318:355:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the welfare gains from programs such as the EITC.

32:1110:76344:27:20:74:519:298:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The preceding two sections have considered studies that analyze local changes in marginal tax
32:1111:76437:20:21:74:519:278:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:rates without fully modelling each agentís budget set in a progressive tax system. Another

32:1114:76706:20:21:74:338:217:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:various patterns in the non-linear budget set literature.

32:1116:76849:20:20:74:519:176:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:predict much more bunching at kinks than observed in practice.  This is illustrated in Figure
32:1117:76942:20:21:74:519:156:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:11, which plots the income tax schedule in 2006 (dashed blue line) for a single Öler with two

32:1120:77234:14:0:74:514:105:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:be 10 times larger on the extensive margin in order to generate the same impacts as on the intensive margin.

33:1126:77793:21:20:74:519:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:gain as a percentage of consumption (calculated using the utility in (21) from locating at that
33:1127:77888:20:20:74:519:578:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:kink point relative to optimizing under the incorrect assumption that the rate in the previous
33:1128:77982:20:21:74:520:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:bracket continues into the next bracket.26The utility losses are less than 1% of net earnings
33:1129:78075:21:20:74:173:537:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:at most of the kinks.

33:1131:78186:20:21:74:519:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:models are to introduce optimization errors that smooth the income distribution around the
33:1132:78276:21:20:74:519:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:kink (e.g. Hausman 1981, Blomquist and Hansson-Brusewitz 1990) or to smooth the budget
33:1133:78362:20:20:74:519:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:set itself (MaCurdy, Green, and Paarsche 1990).  The approach proposed here ñpermitting
33:1134:78449:20:21:74:519:436:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:agents to deviate systematically from their frictionless optima provided that the utility losses
33:1135:78545:21:20:74:519:415:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:fall below some threshold ñplaces more structure on the nature of these optimization errors
33:1136:78636:20:20:74:270:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and could thereby improve identiÖcation.
33:1137:78676:20:20:91:519:375:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(ii) Bunching among the Self-Employed. Saez (2010) documents that unlike wage earners,
33:1138:78762:20:21:74:519:355:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:self-employed individuals bunch at the Örst kink of the EITC schedule, where tax refunds
33:1139:78850:21:20:74:519:334:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:are maximized.  Audit studies show that self employment income is frequently misreported
33:1140:78938:20:20:74:519:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:on tax returns because of the lack of double reporting.   Unlike changing actual hours of
33:1141:79027:20:21:74:519:294:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:work, misreporting generates a Örst-order utility gain because it transfers resources from the
33:1142:79121:21:20:74:519:273:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:government to the taxpayer.  The large utility gains from misreporting taxable income could
33:1143:79212:20:20:74:431:253:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f4:explain why the self-employed overcome frictions and bunch at this kink.27
33:1144:79286:20:21:91:519:233:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(iii) Notches. Unlike kinks, notches in budget sets, where a $1 change in earnings leads to a
33:1145:79379:21:20:74:519:212:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:discontinuous jump in consumption, generate substantial behavioral responses. For example,
33:1146:79469:20:20:74:519:192:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:income cuto§s to qualify for Medicaid (Yelowitz 1995) and social security beneÖts in some
33:1147:79558:20:17:74:519:172:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:pension systems (Gruber and Wise 1999) induce sharp reductions in labor supply. To calculate
33:1148:79650:17:15:83:519:155:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:26There are many values ofaithat can induce individuals to locate at each kink.  The numbers in the Ögure
33:1149:79755:15:7:74:445:140:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:are (unweighted) mean percentage losses for agents who would optimally locate at the kink.
33:1150:79845:7:15:83:519:133:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:27Even the self-employed do not bunch at the second kink of the EITC schedule (where the phase-out region
33:1151:79950:15:11:74:519:118:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:begins).  The Örst kink in the EITC schedule maximizes the size of the EITC refund while minimizing payroll
33:1152:80057:11:11:74:519:107:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:tax liabilities.  There is no reason to locate at the second kink if oneís goal is to reap Örst-order gains from
33:1153:80169:11:0:74:161:96:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:income manipulation.

34:1156:80363:21:20:74:519:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the utility cost of ignoring a notch increases at a Örst-order rate with the size of the penalty

34:1158:80552:20:29:74:413:619:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:promising source of variation for identiÖcation of structural elasticities.

34:1160:80660:28:20:74:519:562:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The Önal strand of the literature I consider is the debate on micro vs. macro labor supply
34:1161:80750:20:20:74:519:542:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:elasticities. Macroeconomic models calibrate labor supply elasticities to match the variation in
34:1162:80846:20:21:74:519:522:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:aggregate hours of work across countries with di§erent tax systems or over the business cycle.
34:1163:80940:21:20:74:519:501:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:In both cases, macro calibrations of representative agent models imply larger elasticities than
34:1164:81035:20:20:74:511:481:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:microeconometric estimates of intensive margin elasticities.  Can frictions explain this gap?
34:1165:81128:20:21:91:519:461:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The macro literature uses the term ìmacro elasticityî to refer to the Frisch elasticity of

34:1167:81313:20:20:74:519:420:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:ditional on employment (e.g. Prescott 2004, Rogerson and Wallenius 2009). I instead use the
34:1168:81404:20:21:74:519:400:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:terms ìmicroîand ìmacroîto refer to the source of variation used to estimate the elasticity, for
34:1169:81500:21:20:74:519:379:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:two reasons.  First, both intensive and extensive margin responses are determined by micro-
34:1170:81591:20:20:74:519:359:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:economic household-level choices.  Second, the Frisch (marginal utility constant) elasticity is
34:1171:81686:20:21:74:519:339:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:important for understanding business cycle áuctuations, but does not control the steady-state
34:1172:81779:21:20:74:519:318:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:impacts of di§erences in taxes across countries. The Frisch elasticity determines intertemporal
34:1173:81874:20:20:74:519:298:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:substitution responses to temporary wage áuctuations, while the Hicksian (wealth constant)
34:1174:81964:20:21:74:519:278:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:elasticity controls steady-state responses and the e¢ ciency costs of taxes (MaCurdy 1981,
34:1175:82054:21:20:74:519:257:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Auerbach 1985).28I Örst compare micro and macro estimates of Hicksian elasticities and
34:1176:82140:20:20:74:221:237:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:then turn to Frisch elasticities.

34:1180:82430:17:14:83:519:159:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:28Chetty et al. (2011b) discuss these elasticity concepts in greater detail and show that some discrepancies
34:1181:82538:14:7:74:310:145:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:across studies arise simply from di§erences in terminology.
34:1182:82597:7:15:83:519:138:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:29The well known elasticity of 3 reported by Prescott (2004) is a Frisch elasticity.  Regressing log hours on
34:1183:82706:15:11:74:519:123:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:log net-of-tax rates using Prescottís data yields a Hicksian aggregate hours elasticity of 0.7 and an intensive
34:1184:82817:11:11:74:519:112:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:elasticity of 0.46.  Prescott translates the Hicksian elasticity of 0.7 into a Frisch elasticity of 3 based on speciÖc
34:1185:82935:11:0:74:244:101:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:functional form assumptions about utility.
35:1186:82979:0:20:74:519:700:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:elasticity from the three macroeconomic studies in Table II (Nickell 2003, Prescott 2004, Davis
35:1187:83074:20:21:74:519:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and Henrekson 2005) is 0.17. Hence, macro cross-country evidence implies an aggregate hours

35:1189:83196:20:20:91:519:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:These macro elasticity estimates are consistent with micro estimates once one accounts
35:1190:83282:20:21:74:519:619:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:for optimization frictions.  On the intensive margin, even the smallest estimates in Table I
35:1191:83374:21:20:74:519:598:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:are consistent with a structural elasticity of 0.33 with-=  1%frictions.  The minimum--

35:1193:83553:20:21:74:519:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:macroeconomic comparisons are more likely to overcome frictions because they analyze steady-
35:1194:83645:21:20:74:519:537:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:state behavior and because they induce coordinated changes in work patterns (Altonji and
35:1195:83733:20:20:74:244:517:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Oldham 2003, Chetty et al. 2011a).

35:1199:84034:20:21:74:519:436:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:extensive margin elasticities is consistent with the prediction that frictions have little impact
35:1200:84131:21:20:74:221:415:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:on extensive margin responses.
35:1201:84161:20:20:91:519:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:I conclude that both micro and macro evidence imply steady-state aggregate hours elas-

35:1203:84342:20:21:74:519:355:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:labor models show that both intensive and extensive margins are important in accounting for

35:1206:84618:20:21:74:462:294:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:macro estimates on the intensive margin but are similar on the extensive margin.

36:1246:86586:20:20:74:519:422:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:largest Frisch elasticity consistent with these parameters is"F= 0:47.  Intuitively, the Frisch
36:1247:86681:20:21:74:519:402:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:elasticity cannot be much larger than the Hicksian elasticity for plausible values of the income

36:1249:86864:20:20:74:346:361:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:earnings is not very high for most households in the U.S.

36:1257:87438:31:21:74:519:174:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:There are many frictions that induce agents to deviate from the optimal choices predicted
36:1258:87527:21:16:74:519:153:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:by standard economic models.  This paper has shown that the model mis-speciÖcation that
36:1259:87614:16:15:83:519:137:6:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:30An interesting question left for future work is whether the structural or observed elasticity is more relevant
36:1260:87726:15:10:74:519:122:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:for business cycle áuctuations. If there are small áuctuations in wage rates over the business cycle, the observed
36:1261:87840:10:11:74:519:112:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:elasticity (attenuated by frictions) may be the better predictor of behavioral responses.  But if a small group
36:1262:87951:11:11:74:519:101:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:of individuals face very large wage shocks, then frictions may be overcome and the structural elasticity may be
36:1263:88062:11:0:74:131:90:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:more relevant.
37:1264:88078:0:20:74:519:700:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:arises from the omission of these frictions can be handled using the tools of set identiÖcation.
37:1265:88174:20:21:74:519:680:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Abstractly, I exchange the standard orthogonality condition on the error term for a bounded
37:1266:88265:21:20:74:519:659:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:support condition based on the utility costs of errors.  I derive an analytical representation
37:1267:88359:20:20:74:519:639:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:for bounds on structural price elasticities that is a function of the observed elasticity, size of
37:1268:88457:20:21:74:457:619:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the price change used for identiÖcation, and the degree of optimization frictions.

37:1270:88629:20:20:74:519:578:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of this literature.  The critique is that many microeconometric studies of labor supply are
37:1271:88720:20:21:74:519:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f5:uninformative about intensive margin elasticities because they cannot reject large values of"

37:1273:88905:20:20:74:519:517:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:patterns in this literature can be reconciled by allowing for such small frictions.  Combining
37:1274:88999:20:21:74:519:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:estimates from several studies, my preferred point estimates of structural Hicksian elasticities
37:1275:89095:21:20:74:519:476:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:are 0.33 on the intensive margin, 0.25 on the extensive margin, and roughly 0.5 for aggregate
37:1276:89188:20:20:74:519:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:hours. I also Önd that Frisch elasticities cannot be much larger than Hicksian elasticities given
37:1277:89285:20:21:74:189:436:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:plausible income e§ects.
37:1278:89309:21:20:91:519:415:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Both the methodology and application in this paper could be improved in several respects
37:1279:89397:20:20:74:519:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:in future work. Methodologically, it is important to extend the bounds to settings beyond the
37:1280:89490:20:20:74:519:375:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:binary treatment e§ect estimator considered here.  Natural extensions include di§erence-in-
37:1281:89581:20:21:74:519:355:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:di§erence estimates and regression models that allow for continuous price variation. It would
37:1282:89674:21:20:74:519:334:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:also be interesting to explore whether the bounds can be sharpened by imposing additional
37:1283:89763:20:20:74:519:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:restrictions from theory, such as a requirement that agents converge to unconstrained optima
37:1284:89855:20:21:74:519:294:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:over time.  In the labor supply application, it would be useful to calculate bounds in modern
37:1285:89948:21:20:74:519:273:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:structural models of labor supply that incorporate factors such as human capital accumulation,
37:1286:90042:20:20:74:519:253:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:credit constraints, and uncertainty.  Because full identiÖcation of these models is challenging,
37:1287:90138:20:21:74:492:233:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:bounding the structural elasticity may be a particularly fruitful approach in such cases.
37:1288:90227:21:20:91:519:212:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Finally, the bounding methodology developed here can be applied to estimate a variety
37:1289:90312:20:20:74:519:192:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of other critical parameters such as the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, the marginal
37:1290:90407:20:21:74:519:172:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:propensity to consume out of income, or the e§ects of the minimum wage on employment.
37:1291:90492:21:20:74:519:151:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Such analyses would shed light on which disagreements are economically signiÖcant and which

42:1446:101375:26:14:91:519:649:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:This section establishes two results.   First, the bounds in Proposition 1 apply to the
42:1447:101462:14:13:74:519:635:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Hicksian elasticity when the quasilinearity assumption in (2) is relaxed.  Second, allowing for

46:1680:110800:14:13:74:519:483:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(the ìcontrol groupî) andZi=  2-SD(X)for the remaining observations (the ìtreatment
46:1681:110883:13:14:74:519:470:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:groupî).  Setting the size of the single treatment to2-SD(X)yieldsvar(Z)  =var(X).
46:1682:110965:14:13:74:519:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Hence, the standard error of^\f2equals the standard error of^\f1.   A single tax change of

46:1685:111202:14:13:91:519:415:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:I calculate the bounds by assuming that agents face a linear budget set whose slope is

46:1688:111462:13:14:74:519:375:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:segments in a progressive tax system.  However, the bounds cannot be applied to agents who
46:1689:111552:14:13:74:519:361:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:locate at kinks.  Given that most of the studies in Table I estimate elasticities from changes

46:1700:112410:14:13:74:519:200:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:that are too tight, because MaCurdy uses family background characteristics, age, and year

46:1704:112712:14:11:74:519:145:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:are an exception.  I incorporate these studies into the linear-demand framework by exploiting the fact that
46:1705:112819:11:11:74:520:134:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:they also studymovementsin the kinks over time, which create reductions in marginal rates for the subgroup

46:1707:113033:11:11:74:519:112:9:g_d0_f4:9:g_d0_f4:not increase labor supply signiÖcantly when their marginal tax rates are lowered.  This constitutes an observed
