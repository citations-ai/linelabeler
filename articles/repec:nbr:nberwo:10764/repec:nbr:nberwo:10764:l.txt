2:27:1255:31:20:71:539:592:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:We use a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate a model that allows temporary
2:28:1349:20:20:71:539:572:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:gaps between a true expectational Phillips curve and the monetary authority's approximating non-
2:29:1445:20:21:71:539:552:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:expectational Phillips curve. A dynamic programming problem implies that the monetary authority's
2:30:1542:21:20:71:539:531:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:inflation target evolves as its estimated Phillips curve moves. Our estimates attribute the rise and fall
2:31:1647:20:20:71:539:511:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:of post WWII inflation in the US to an intricate interaction between the monetary authority's beliefs
2:32:1748:20:21:71:539:491:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:and economic shocks. Shocks in the 1970s altered the monetary authority's estimates and made it
2:33:1843:21:20:71:539:470:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:misperceive the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. That caused a sharp rise in inflation
2:34:1941:20:20:71:539:450:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:in the 1970s. Our estimates say that policymakers updated their beliefs continuously. By the 1980s,
2:35:2040:20:21:71:539:430:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:their beliefs about the Phillips curve had changed enough to account for Volcker's conquest of US
2:36:2137:21:27:71:203:409:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:C:inflation in the early 1980s.

3:57:2575:0:28:259:352:673:12:Times:10:Times:A:I.INTRODUCTION
3:58:2589:28:21:101:521:645:12:Times:12:Times:A:Today, many statesmen and macroeconomists believe that inflation can largely be de-
3:59:2672:21:21:90:522:624:12:Times:12:Times:B:termined by a government monetary authority.  Then why did the Federal Reserve Board
3:60:2756:21:20:90:522:603:12:Times:12:Times:B:preside over high US inflation during the late 1960s and the 1970s?  And why, under Paul
3:61:2844:20:21:90:522:583:12:Times:12:Times:B:Volcker, did it rapidly bring inflation down during the early 1980s?  This paper answers
3:62:2932:21:21:90:522:562:12:Times:12:Times:B:these questions by estimating a model that features a particular process that makes a pro-
3:63:3022:21:21:90:522:541:12:Times:12:Times:B:cession of economic shocks induce the monetary authority to alter its model of inflation-
3:64:3111:21:21:90:521:520:12:Times:12:Times:B:unemployment dynamics, the Phillips curve. At each datet, the monetary authority updates
3:65:3199:21:21:90:522:499:12:Times:12:Times:B:its beliefs about the Phillips curve and then recomputes a first-period action recommended
3:66:3289:21:21:90:522:478:12:Times:12:Times:B:by a “Phelps problem”, a discounted dynamic programming problem that minimizes the
3:67:3371:21:21:90:521:457:12:Times:9:Times:B:expected value of a discounted quadratic loss function of inflation and unemployment.1
3:68:3457:21:21:90:522:436:12:Times:12:Times:B:The monetary authority pursues the same objectives at each date, using the same structural
3:69:3547:21:21:90:521:415:12:Times:12:Times:B:model, with only its estimates of that model changing over time.2This model of the sys-
3:70:3634:21:21:90:522:394:12:Times:12:Times:B:tematic part of inflation puts the monetary authority’s beliefs about the Phillips curve front
3:71:3728:21:21:90:145:373:12:Times:9:Times:B:and center.3
3:72:3740:21:20:101:521:352:12:Times:12:Times:A:We assume that the monetary authority’s model of the Phillips curve deviates in two
3:73:3823:20:21:90:522:332:12:Times:12:Times:B:subtle but important ways from what it would be in a rational expectations model (e.g.,
3:74:3910:21:21:90:521:311:12:Times:12:Times:B:Kydland and Prescott (1977)).  The first deviation is that, while the true Phillips curve is
3:75:4002:21:21:90:522:290:12:Times:12:Times:B:like Kydland and Prescott’s, we assume that the monetary authority omits the public’s ex-
3:76:4091:21:21:90:522:269:12:Times:12:Times:B:pected rate of inflation from its Phillips curve.  By itself, this omission need not prevent
3:77:4183:21:21:90:522:248:12:Times:12:Times:B:the outcomes of our model from coinciding with those of Kydland and Prescott’s, nor need
3:78:4271:21:54:90:522:227:12:Times:12:Times:B:it imply that the government’s model is wrong in a way that could be detected from even
3:79:4358:54:16:101:352:173:9:Times:10:Times:F:1Sargent (1999) contributed the nomenclature Phelps problem.
3:80:4418:16:22:101:522:157:9:Times:10:Times:F:2There is some debate about whether policy objectives or the structural models used by policymakers have
3:81:4522:22:18:90:522:135:10:Times:10:Times:F:evolved over time.  However introducing such an evolution of understanding into formal models is difficult
3:82:4628:18:14:90:427:117:10:Times:10:Times:F:without arbitrarily imposing exogenous changes. We need no such exogenous shifts.
3:83:4709:14:0:101:448:103:9:Times:10:Times:F:3As does Kydland and Prescott’s (1977) model of time-consistent suboptimal inflation.
4:84:4824:0:21:90:522:673:12:Times:12:Times:B:an infinite sample.  Whether the monetary authority’s model is wrong in a statistically de-
4:85:4915:21:21:90:522:652:12:Times:12:Times:B:tectable way depends on how we allow the monetary authority to reestimate the parameters
4:86:5003:21:21:90:522:631:12:Times:12:Times:B:of its model. In particular, if the monetary authority were to believe that the coefficients of
4:87:5098:21:20:90:522:610:12:Times:12:Times:B:its Phillips curve are constant over time, then its estimates would converge to ones that sup-
4:88:5192:20:21:90:522:590:12:Times:12:Times:B:port a self-confirming equilibrium (SCE). After convergence, its estimated Phillips curve
4:89:5281:21:21:90:522:569:12:Times:12:Times:B:would correctly describe occurrences along the SCE path for inflation and unemployment.
4:90:5368:21:21:90:522:548:12:Times:12:Times:B:Such an after-convergence version of our model has little hope of explaining the rise and
4:91:5457:21:21:90:522:527:12:Times:12:Times:B:fall of US inflation:  that model would have inflation fluctuating randomly around a con-
4:92:5546:21:21:90:522:506:12:Times:12:Times:B:stant SCE level that coincides with Kydland and Prescott’s time consistent suboptimal (i.e.,
4:93:5638:21:21:90:171:485:12:Times:9:Times:B:excessive) level.4
4:94:5656:21:21:101:521:464:12:Times:12:Times:A:This outcome motivates our second subtle deviation from a rational expectations equi-
4:95:5741:21:21:90:522:443:12:Times:12:Times:B:librium.  Instead of thinking that the regression coefficients in its Phillips curve are time
4:96:5834:21:21:90:522:422:12:Times:12:Times:B:invariant  (which  they  indeedarein  an  SCE),  our  monetary  authority  believes  that  they
4:97:5929:21:21:90:522:401:12:Times:12:Times:B:form a vector random walk with innovation covariance matrixV.  Given that model, the
4:98:6013:21:21:90:521:380:12:Times:12:Times:B:monetary authority updates its beliefs using Bayes’ rule. The covariance matrixVand the
4:99:6100:21:21:90:522:359:12:Times:12:Times:B:initial condition for the regression parameters in the monetary authority’s Phillips curve
4:100:6190:21:20:90:522:338:12:Times:12:Times:B:become the hyperparameters of a model that shapes evolution of the monetary authority’s
4:101:6277:20:21:90:522:318:12:Times:12:Times:B:beliefs.5After calibrating the initial condition and imposing that the systematic part of
4:102:6366:21:21:90:522:297:12:Times:12:Times:B:inflation is determined by the timetsolution of the Phelps problem, we estimateValong
4:103:6451:21:21:90:521:276:12:Times:12:Times:B:with parameters of thetrueexpectational Phillips curve that, unbeknownst to the monetary
4:104:6539:21:21:90:522:255:12:Times:12:Times:B:authority,  truly  describes  inflation-unemployment  dynamics.   Using  a  Bayesian  Markov
4:105:6631:21:21:90:522:234:12:Times:12:Times:B:Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, we report statistics that describe the posterior dis-
4:106:6720:21:22:90:522:213:12:Times:12:Times:B:tribution of these parameters of our model.  We obtain a much better explanation of the
4:107:6807:22:22:101:522:191:9:Times:10:Times:F:4Michael Parkin (1993) and Peter Ireland (1999) advocate the hypothesis that the post WWII US inflation
4:108:6910:22:18:90:522:169:10:Times:10:Times:F:data can be accounted for by well understood medium term movements in the natural rate of unemploy-
4:109:7009:18:18:90:522:151:10:Times:10:Times:F:ment, stable government preferences, and a steady adherence to the time-consistent suboptimal equilibrium
4:110:7114:18:12:90:218:133:10:Times:10:Times:F:of Kydland and Prescott (1977).
4:111:7145:12:22:101:522:121:9:Times:10:Times:F:5As would be true in a rational expectations model, the monetary authority’s beliefs are outcomes, not free

5:113:7293:0:21:90:522:673:12:Times:12:Times:B:monetary authority’s inflation choices than earlier efforts to estimate similar models had
5:114:7383:21:21:90:135:652:12:Times:12:Times:B:achieved.
5:115:7392:21:21:101:522:631:12:Times:12:Times:A:With very particular a priori settings of the parameter innovation covariance matrixV,
5:116:7478:21:20:90:521:610:12:Times:12:Times:B:Sims (1988), Chung (1990), Sargent (1999), and Cho, Williams, and Sargent (2002) all
5:117:7562:20:21:90:522:590:12:Times:12:Times:B:studied versions of our model.6When Chung and Sargent estimated their a-priori-fixed-
5:118:7647:21:21:89:521:569:12:Times:12:Times:B:Vversions of our model, they obtained discouraging results.  They did not come close to
5:119:7734:21:21:90:522:548:12:Times:12:Times:B:explaining the rise and fall of US inflation in terms of a process of the monetary authority’s
5:120:7828:21:21:90:248:527:12:Times:9:Times:B:learning about its Phillips curve.7
5:121:7863:21:21:101:521:506:12:Times:12:Times:A:This paper estimates settings forVthat attain substantial improvements in the model’s
5:122:7948:21:21:90:522:485:12:Times:12:Times:B:ability to rationalize the choices made by the US monetary authority.  The MCMC algo-
5:123:8033:21:21:90:521:464:12:Times:12:Times:B:rithm finds values forVthat allow the model to reverse engineer from the data a sequence of
5:124:8124:21:21:90:522:443:12:Times:12:Times:B:government beliefs about the Phillips curve that, through the intermediation of the Phelps
5:125:8214:21:21:90:522:422:12:Times:12:Times:B:problem, capture both the acceleration of US inflation in the 1970s and its rapid decline in
5:126:8306:21:21:90:522:401:12:Times:12:Times:B:the early 1980s. Our MCMC method estimates aVthat accommodates an avenue by which
5:127:8387:21:21:90:522:380:12:Times:12:Times:B:economic shocks impinge on the monetary authority’s beliefs, via its use of Bayes’ rule,
5:128:8475:21:21:90:522:359:12:Times:12:Times:B:and its decisions, via successive solutions of its Phelps problem. The monetary authority’s
5:129:8566:21:20:90:522:338:12:Times:12:Times:B:views about parameter drift and its application of Bayes’ rule add a source of history de-
5:130:8656:20:21:90:522:318:12:Times:12:Times:B:pendence to its procession of decisions that is absent, for example, in either Sargent’s SCE

6:149:10213:28:20:101:521:457:12:Times:12:Times:A:The  model  is  an  extension  of  Sargent  and  Williams  (2003),  which  is  composed  of  a
6:150:10307:20:34:90:489:437:12:Times:12:Times:B:Lucas-Sargent natural-rate version of the Phillips curve and a true inflation process:

6:155:10643:21:21:90:522:301:12:Times:12:Times:B:standard  normal  random  variables.   Equation  (1)  is  an  expectations-augmented  Phillips
6:156:10737:21:21:90:521:280:12:Times:12:Times:B:curve.   Ifabs(θ0)>abs(θ1),  (1) becomes a version of a natural-rate Phillips curve that
6:157:10825:21:21:90:522:259:12:Times:12:Times:B:allows a serially correlated disturbance (Sargent1999). Equation (2) states that the govern-
6:158:10917:21:21:90:522:238:12:Times:12:Times:B:ment sets policy to influence inflation up to a random shock. The government’s policy is to

7:174:11571:20:21:90:521:590:12:Times:12:Times:B:(1), we see that the government fails to account explicitly for the role of expectations in
7:175:11662:21:21:90:522:569:12:Times:12:Times:B:determining the unemployment rate.  HereˆErepresents expectations with respect to the

7:199:12803:21:21:101:521:205:12:Times:12:Times:A:A self-confirming equilibrium is a population concept that restricts beliefs to be time-
7:200:12891:21:21:90:522:184:12:Times:12:Times:B:invariant and that is a benchmark – and as it sometimes turns out, a limit point – for our
7:201:12981:21:21:90:522:163:12:Times:12:Times:B:model.  In our model, unlike an SCE, at any point in history the government updates its
7:202:13068:21:22:90:521:142:12:Times:12:Times:B:beliefs as it learns.   In particular,  the government basesˆαt|t−1,  its mean estimate of the
7:203:13162:22:22:101:522:120:9:Times:10:Times:F:8As explained by Sargent (1999, chapter 3), the gap between the Ramsey and Nash or SCE outcomes for

8:210:13618:21:21:90:521:542:12:Times:12:Times:B:variance matrixV.  Thus, the government believes that the true economy drifts over time.
8:211:13706:21:21:90:522:521:12:Times:12:Times:B:That is why it continually adapts its parameter estimates. The innovation covariance matrix
8:212:13797:21:21:89:522:500:12:Times:12:Times:B:Vgoverns the perceived volatility of increments to the parameters, and is a key component
8:213:13886:21:30:90:449:479:12:Times:12:Times:B:of the model. The mean estimate ofαtfor the econometric model (7)-(8) is

8:218:14023:28:21:90:522:338:12:Times:12:Times:B:Given the government’s model, the mean estimates are optimally updated via the special

8:229:14365:34:21:90:522:182:12:Times:12:Times:B:Instead of using the Kalman filter, many models of adaptation assume a learning rule known
8:230:14455:21:21:90:460:161:12:Times:12:Times:B:as recursive least squares (RLS), which is closely related to the Kalman filter.
8:231:14535:21:21:101:521:140:12:Times:12:Times:A:An important issue about any learning rule is whether the learning process will converge
8:232:14623:21:21:90:522:119:12:Times:12:Times:B:to a self-confirming equilibrium. To summarize what we known about this, we scale the in-

9:237:15007:21:21:126:521:603:12:Times:12:Times:A:learning than under RLS. In effect,  the Kalman filter learning rule with drifting
9:238:15089:21:21:126:521:582:12:Times:12:Times:A:coefficients seems to discount the past data more rapidly than the constant gain

10:265:16941:21:21:90:521:548:12:Times:12:Times:B:same. There would exist a continuum of maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) ifζwere
10:266:17023:21:21:90:522:527:12:Times:12:Times:B:not restricted (i.e., the model is unidentified). Some normalization is necessary. Following
10:267:17115:21:21:90:522:506:12:Times:12:Times:B:Sargent and Williams, we impose the restrictionζ=ζ1.  This normalization implies that
10:268:17200:21:21:89:521:485:12:Times:12:Times:B:the variation that policymakers observe in the unemployment rate is correctly decomposed
10:269:17288:21:21:89:521:464:12:Times:12:Times:B:into variation in the regressors and variation due to exogenous shocks. This assumption has
10:270:17379:21:21:89:393:443:12:Times:9:Times:B:an advantage because it makes limiting results easier to derive.9
10:271:17444:21:21:101:521:422:12:Times:12:Times:A:As we’ve noted, Sargent and Williams (2003) show that whether monetary policy stays
10:272:17527:21:21:90:522:401:12:Times:12:Times:B:close to a path associated with a self-confirming equilibrium, and if not, how it evolves over
10:273:17621:21:21:90:522:380:12:Times:12:Times:B:time are both sensitive to the model’s parameters (especially the government’s belief about
10:274:17712:21:21:90:522:359:12:Times:12:Times:B:the covariance matrix for the drifting coefficients). No doubt this sensitivity contributes to
10:275:17806:21:20:90:464:338:12:Times:12:Times:B:the outcome that we are able to estimate the key structural parameters sharply.

13:408:20996:21:21:89:521:366:12:Times:12:Times:B:January 1948 to December 1959.13We tried to fixP1|0at the value that scales up and down
13:409:21083:21:21:90:521:345:12:Times:12:Times:B:the presample regression estimateˆσ2(Φ′Φ)−1, but the fit was extremely poor.  Similarly,

13:413:21361:15:11:89:522:270:10:Times:10:Times:F:This normalization is consistent with Wald normalization discussed in Hamilton, Waggoner, and Zha (2003).
13:414:21466:11:22:101:522:259:9:Times:10:Times:F:11Alan Blinder (1998) emphasizes that the source of time inconsistency in Kydland and Prescott’s (1977)
13:415:21569:22:18:90:522:237:10:Times:10:Times:F:Phillips curve example is their settingu∗∗6=u∗in the monetary authority’s preferences (3).  Citing his ex-
13:416:21675:18:18:90:522:219:10:Times:10:Times:F:perience as Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Blinder questions whether there was ever much of a gap
13:417:21779:18:10:90:169:201:10:Times:10:Times:F:betweenu∗∗andu∗.
13:418:21795:10:22:101:521:191:7:Times:10:Times:F:12Narrowing the gap betweenu∗andu∗∗slightly increases the magnitude of the estimated Phillips curve
13:419:21894:22:18:90:521:169:10:Times:10:Times:F:slope parametersθ0andθ1.  But this change is small enough as to be essentially inconsequential for our
13:420:21996:18:12:89:118:151:10:Times:10:Times:F:results.
13:421:22004:12:22:101:521:139:9:Times:10:Times:F:13In an earlier draft, we followed Chung (1990) to let this belief be estimated using the sample data. Since
13:422:22112:22:18:90:522:117:10:Times:10:Times:F:it is influenced by the updated beliefs in the sample, the value estimated this way is as difficult to interpret as
13:423:22227:18:0:90:147:99:10:Times:10:Times:F:that in Chung.
14:424:22272:0:21:90:521:672:12:Times:12:Times:B:not improve the poor fit.14Departing from Sargent (1999), therefore, we estimate the gov-
14:425:22361:21:21:90:522:651:12:Times:12:Times:B:ernment’s prior beliefsP1|0andVwithin the sample. Our MCMC or maximum likelihood
14:426:22441:21:21:90:522:630:12:Times:12:Times:B:algorithm is “reverse engineering” the empirical Phillips curve at each date that, in con-
14:427:22531:21:20:90:522:609:12:Times:12:Times:B:junction with the Phelps problem, is needed to rationalize that date’s inflation rate.  Such
14:428:22623:20:21:90:522:589:12:Times:12:Times:B:flexibility is crucial to allow this reverse engineering to back out correct correlations in
14:429:22715:21:21:90:522:568:12:Times:12:Times:B:P1|0andV.  Moreover, this flexibility is arguably reasonable.  The presample data may be
14:430:22803:21:21:90:522:547:12:Times:12:Times:B:informative of the government’s subjective point estimates (which we fix), but less so of its
14:431:22896:21:21:90:522:526:12:Times:12:Times:B:subjective uncertainty (which we estimate).  Thus, we use the presample data to pin down
14:432:22984:21:21:90:521:505:12:Times:12:Times:B:the mean of the government’s estimate of the empirical Phillips curve, butnotto estimate

14:442:23388:31:21:101:521:349:12:Times:12:Times:A:As mentioned,  among the parameters that we estimate are those of the expectational
14:443:23471:21:21:90:522:328:12:Times:12:Times:B:Phillips curve (1) that we assume truly governs the data.  As can be seen in Table1, the
14:444:23559:21:20:90:522:307:12:Times:12:Times:B:natural rate of unemploymentu∗in equation (1) is estimated to be 6.1 and its probability
14:445:23647:20:21:90:522:287:12:Times:12:Times:B:intervals are wide, consistent with the confidence interval in the statistical model of Staiger,
14:446:23743:21:21:90:522:266:12:Times:12:Times:B:Stock, and Watson (1997).  Responses of unemployment to inflation surprises (θ0andθ1)
14:447:23828:21:21:89:521:245:12:Times:12:Times:B:are extremely weak and are statistically insignificant by the probability intervals.  This is
14:448:23921:21:21:89:522:224:12:Times:12:Times:B:an important finding for us, partly because it implies from (6) that Nash inflation is close
14:449:24013:21:21:90:522:203:12:Times:12:Times:B:toπ∗despite the large difference betweenu∗andu∗∗. In the long run, therefore, the mean
14:450:24099:21:21:90:522:182:12:Times:12:Times:B:dynamics of inflation are always close to the Ramsey outcomes. Unemployment is by itself
14:451:24187:21:24:90:365:161:12:Times:12:Times:B:a persistent series and the persistence is tightly estimated.
14:452:24248:24:16:101:293:137:9:Times:10:Times:F:14This point is illustrated further in SectionV.2.
14:453:24298:16:22:101:521:121:9:Times:10:Times:F:15All probability intervals are derived from the empirical joint posterior distribution generated from a
14:454:24402:22:0:90:229:99:10:Times:10:Times:F:sequence of 50,000 MCMC draws.
15:455:24463:0:21:101:521:673:12:Times:12:Times:A:It can be seen from the estimates and probability intervals ofζ1andζ2that their posterior
15:456:24552:21:21:89:521:652:12:Times:12:Times:B:distribution is tight but skewed downward, especially forζ1whose posterior estimate is
15:457:24638:21:21:89:208:631:12:Times:12:Times:B:outside the 90% interval.
15:458:24663:21:20:101:522:610:12:Times:12:Times:A:The estimatedP1|0shows strong correlations (at least above0.95) among all the ele-
15:459:24745:20:21:90:522:590:12:Times:12:Times:B:ments.  The relatively large variance for the drifting coefficient onπt−2(the4th element)
15:460:24834:21:21:89:521:569:12:Times:12:Times:B:implies that the government is quite uncertain about this coefficient, which affects the un-
15:461:24926:21:21:89:521:548:12:Times:12:Times:B:certainty about other coefficients even though their marginal variances are relatively small.
15:462:25019:21:21:101:522:527:12:Times:12:Times:A:The estimatedVshows strong correlations among the coefficients on current and lagged
15:463:25103:21:21:90:522:506:12:Times:12:Times:B:inflation variables.  The variances on the inflation variables are large in the sense of Sar-
15:464:25196:21:21:90:521:485:12:Times:12:Times:B:gent and Williams (2003).   The constant term has a very large variance and affects the
15:465:25283:21:21:90:522:464:12:Times:12:Times:B:coefficients on the lagged unemployment variables because of high correlations, but it has
15:466:25373:21:21:90:522:443:12:Times:12:Times:B:a small influence on the inflation coefficients in the government’s model.  BecauseVis
15:467:25459:21:21:90:522:422:12:Times:12:Times:B:not small, the government’s beliefs are likely to drift significantly and inflation is likely to
15:468:25555:21:21:90:522:401:12:Times:12:Times:B:escape to the near-Ramsey region.  Our estimates of the true expectational Phillips curve
15:469:25644:21:21:90:522:380:12:Times:12:Times:B:(1) imply that there is a negligible difference between the SCE andπ∗.  But as we show
15:470:25730:21:21:89:521:359:12:Times:12:Times:B:later, even when we artificially alter the parameters of (1) to allow the SCE inflation rate to
15:471:25825:21:20:90:521:338:12:Times:12:Times:B:be considerably higher than the Ramsey rate, this largeVpermits frequent escapes to low
15:472:25912:20:21:90:158:318:12:Times:12:Times:B:inflation rates.
15:473:25928:21:21:101:522:297:12:Times:12:Times:A:The one-step forecasts of inflation are plotted against the actual path in Figure1, and
15:474:26015:21:21:90:521:276:12:Times:12:Times:B:one-step forecasts of unemployment are plotted against the actual path in Figure2. It is ev-
15:475:26107:21:21:90:522:255:12:Times:12:Times:B:ident from these figures that the model fits the data well; so well, in fact, that it is difficult to
15:476:26208:21:21:90:522:234:12:Times:12:Times:B:discern the difference between the series.  By this fit criterion, our reverse engineering ex-
15:477:26302:21:21:90:522:213:12:Times:12:Times:B:ercise is a success, especially compared to those carried out by Chung (1990) and Sargent
15:478:26391:21:21:90:522:192:12:Times:12:Times:B:(1999).  Figures3and4plot the one-step forecast errors for inflation and unemployment,
15:479:26477:21:21:90:522:171:12:Times:12:Times:B:showing that for most of the sample, the forecasts are within one half a percentage point
15:480:26566:21:29:90:522:150:12:Times:12:Times:B:of the realized value.16In AppendixEwe provide a more formal comparison of our model
15:481:26650:29:22:101:521:121:9:Times:10:Times:F:16These forecast errors are comparable to those from the random walk model or an AR(1) model.  These
15:482:26750:22:0:90:329:99:10:Times:10:Times:F:statistical models treat an inflation process to be exogenous.

19:555:29054:20:21:90:522:590:12:Times:12:Times:B:of the persistence of inflation, the government’s inflation policy explains, almost entirely,

19:559:29402:21:20:90:522:474:12:Times:12:Times:B:model is driven by the Phelps problem in conjunction with government’s belief in an ex-
19:560:29489:20:21:90:522:454:12:Times:12:Times:B:ploitable tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, which leads to a high inflation rate
19:561:29580:21:21:90:522:433:12:Times:12:Times:B:in the early 70s.  But then occasional sequences of stochastic shocks lead the government
19:562:29669:21:21:90:522:412:12:Times:12:Times:B:temporarily to believe that it can cut inflation with no rise in unemployment, which leads
19:563:29759:21:21:90:522:391:12:Times:12:Times:B:to  rapid  disinflations  in  the  early  80s.   During  these  episodes,  the  government  learns  a
19:564:29860:21:21:90:522:370:12:Times:12:Times:B:version of the natural rate theory in which the sum of the coefficients on inflation in the
19:565:29951:21:21:90:469:349:12:Times:12:Times:B:government’s model is nearly zero, reflecting a vertical long-run Phillips curve.
19:566:30032:21:21:101:522:328:12:Times:12:Times:A:Such an evolution of the government’s updated beliefs are displayed in Figure5.  The
19:567:30116:21:21:90:522:307:12:Times:12:Times:B:sum of the coefficients on inflation becomes very negative in the early 70s and stay quite
19:568:30206:21:21:90:522:286:12:Times:12:Times:B:negative until the late 70s. In the 1980s, although the sum of the inflation coefficients is still
19:569:30304:21:21:90:522:265:12:Times:12:Times:B:negative, it is small enough for policymakers to decide cutting inflation without worrying
19:570:30394:21:21:90:263:244:12:Times:12:Times:B:much about costs in unemployment.

19:573:30603:20:21:90:522:182:12:Times:12:Times:B:key parameters are the sum of the coefficients on current and lagged inflation variables
19:574:30691:21:21:90:522:161:12:Times:12:Times:B:(α1+α2+α4), the sum of the coefficients on current and lagged unemployment variables
19:575:30775:21:21:89:521:140:12:Times:12:Times:B:(1−α3−α5),  and  the  coefficient  on  the  constant  term  (α6).   As  shown  by  the  symbol

20:591:31418:21:21:90:522:307:12:Times:12:Times:B:second row of Figure6),  the estimated constant coefficient is small and the sum of the
20:592:31505:21:21:90:522:286:12:Times:12:Times:B:inflation coefficients is near zero, giving the government no incentive to inflate in pursuit

23:691:34955:21:21:90:522:652:12:Times:12:Times:B:throughout the 1970s, the government’s model implied that substantial increases in unem-
23:692:35043:21:21:90:521:631:12:Times:12:Times:B:ployment would result from a low inflation policy.18It wasn’t until the early 1980s that
23:693:35131:21:20:90:522:610:12:Times:12:Times:B:this ratio fell to near zero, at which time the disinflation commenced.  This point will be
23:694:35222:20:44:90:451:590:12:Times:12:Times:B:reinforced below when we present medium term forecasts around that time.
23:695:35294:44:21:90:522:546:12:Times:12:Times:B:IV.3.Two Peaks and an Enduring Decline.We now analyze how the model forecasts
23:696:35371:21:21:90:522:525:12:Times:12:Times:B:the two peaks of inflation in the 1970s and the sharp decline in the early 1980s.  We use
23:697:35460:21:21:90:522:504:12:Times:12:Times:B:Monte Carlo simulations to assess the distribution of forecasts going forward over four
23:698:35547:21:21:90:522:483:12:Times:12:Times:B:year horizons from different initial conditions.  In each case, we take the estimated beliefs
23:699:35640:21:21:90:521:462:12:Times:12:Times:B:at the starting date and draw 5000 simulations of 50 periods each.19The figures then plot
23:700:35729:21:21:90:522:441:12:Times:12:Times:B:the actual experienced inflation and the estimated government controlled inflation (xt−1),
23:701:35819:21:21:90:522:420:12:Times:12:Times:B:along with 68% and 90% probability bands. In each plot, the initial condition is shown as
23:702:35908:21:21:90:333:399:12:Times:12:Times:B:date zero, from which we look forward 50 periods.
23:703:35957:21:21:101:521:378:12:Times:12:Times:A:Figure8reports the forecasts. The upper left panel starts in January 1973 when inflation
23:704:36045:21:21:90:522:357:12:Times:12:Times:B:was at a very low level (3.3%). This is also near the time that the government most overes-
23:705:36136:21:20:90:521:336:12:Times:12:Times:B:timated the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment (see Figure5). According to the
23:706:36223:20:21:90:522:316:12:Times:12:Times:B:model, the government exploited the tradeoff and pushed up inflation to lower unemploy-
23:707:36310:21:21:90:522:295:12:Times:12:Times:B:ment.  The model predicts a steadily rising inflation path as high as10%towards the end
23:708:36397:21:21:90:522:274:12:Times:12:Times:B:of the 4-year horizon (the upper90%band), and gives little probability to a lower inflation
23:709:36488:21:21:90:202:253:12:Times:12:Times:B:rate in the medium run.
23:710:36511:21:21:101:521:232:12:Times:12:Times:A:Due to a sequence of shocks,  the inflation path actually experienced reached its peak
23:711:36597:21:36:90:522:211:12:Times:12:Times:B:earlier than the model predicts.  But this is a treacherous period in which to predict, and
23:712:36688:36:22:101:521:175:9:Times:10:Times:F:18A temporary drop in this sacrifice ratio around 1976 led to a temporary decline in inflation around that
23:713:36794:22:18:90:522:153:10:Times:10:Times:F:time.  See Cogley and Sargent (2004) for a story in which the government was deterred from stabilizing in
23:714:36899:18:18:90:522:135:10:Times:10:Times:F:the mid 1970s because it attached a small positive probability to a model that assigned high unemployment
23:715:37004:18:14:90:190:117:10:Times:10:Times:F:costs to a rapid deflation.
23:716:37031:14:0:101:428:103:9:Times:10:Times:F:19Adding uncertainty in the parameters would certainly widen our forecast bands.

24:746:37606:21:54:125:461:298:12:Times:12:Times:A:using as initial estimated conditions at 73:01, 74:01, 77:01, and 80:04.
24:747:37678:54:21:90:522:244:12:Times:12:Times:B:the prediction of rising inflation by the model compares favorably to alternative statistical
24:748:37771:21:21:90:214:223:12:Times:12:Times:B:models (see AppendixE).
24:749:37794:21:20:101:521:202:12:Times:12:Times:A:A year later in January 1974, which is shown in the upper right panel of Figure8, in-
24:750:37879:20:21:90:522:182:12:Times:12:Times:B:flation had continued upward, now reaching 8.4%.  Here we see that the model tracks the
24:751:37966:21:21:90:522:161:12:Times:12:Times:B:actual inflation path quite well, predicting a further increase in inflation prior to a return to
24:752:38063:21:21:90:150:140:12:Times:12:Times:B:lower levels.
24:753:38076:21:21:101:521:119:12:Times:12:Times:A:January 1977 was another difficult time to predict inflation because inflation was at its
24:754:38165:21:0:90:522:98:12:Times:12:Times:B:trough and a second run-up was about to begin. Although actual inflation reached its peak
25:755:38285:0:21:90:522:673:12:Times:12:Times:B:at the later date, the model assigns an overwhelming probability to higher inflation and the
25:756:38377:21:21:90:361:652:12:Times:12:Times:B:upper90%reaches as high as10%(the lower left panel).
25:757:38429:21:21:101:521:631:12:Times:12:Times:A:The disinflation episode in the early 1980s is often interpreted as reflecting the intellec-
25:758:38521:21:20:90:522:610:12:Times:12:Times:B:tual triumph of the rational expectations version of the natural rate theory.  What does our
25:759:38613:20:21:90:522:590:12:Times:12:Times:B:learning model say about this period?  Would the government continue to pursue a higher
25:760:38700:21:21:90:522:569:12:Times:12:Times:B:inflation policy?  After all, from the vantage point of April 1980 when inflation reached
25:761:38789:21:21:90:522:548:12:Times:12:Times:B:its second peak, most forecasting models either predict that inflation was very likely to go
25:762:38881:21:21:90:522:527:12:Times:12:Times:B:higher than it actually did, or they fail to predict the fall of inflation. The lower right panel
25:763:38978:21:21:90:522:506:12:Times:12:Times:B:of Figure8displays the forecast from our learning model.  While actual inflation declines
25:764:39067:21:21:90:522:485:12:Times:12:Times:B:at somewhat a slower speed than what the model predicts in 1980 and 1981, the forecast of
25:765:39156:21:21:90:522:464:12:Times:12:Times:B:a fast decline in inflation is remarkable.  The model’s prediction is especially good further
25:766:39249:21:21:90:522:443:12:Times:12:Times:B:out in the forecasting period. Unlike many forecasting models, our model gives almost no
25:767:39337:21:21:90:522:422:12:Times:12:Times:B:probability to rising inflation in the medium horizon, because the tradeoff between infla-
25:768:39427:21:21:90:522:401:12:Times:12:Times:B:tion and unemployment by then is not high enough for the government to pursue higher
25:769:39511:21:47:90:133:380:12:Times:12:Times:B:inflation.
25:770:39521:47:21:90:522:333:12:Times:12:Times:B:IV.4.Long-Run Dynamics.So far we have shown that our model is able to explain and
25:771:39602:21:21:90:522:312:12:Times:12:Times:B:predict the rise and fall of US inflation experienced. It is equally important to examine the
25:772:39695:21:21:90:522:291:12:Times:12:Times:B:long run properties of the model to see if the government’s adapting beliefs will eventually
25:773:39787:21:20:90:522:270:12:Times:12:Times:B:lead to good inflation outcomes. We first discuss the convergence of our baseline model to
25:774:39877:20:21:90:522:250:12:Times:12:Times:B:a limit distribution. Then we analyze the small variation limits as in Sargent and Williams
25:775:39968:21:47:90:124:229:12:Times:12:Times:B:(2003).
25:776:39975:47:21:90:522:182:12:Times:12:Times:B:IV.4.1.Long-Run Convergence.Figure9shows the inflation dynamics over 30,000 months
25:777:40057:21:21:90:522:161:12:Times:12:Times:B:starting at our estimated initial conditions: 1960:03 (the beginning of the sample), 1973:12
25:778:40149:21:21:90:521:140:12:Times:12:Times:B:(the date where the sum of theπcoefficients is most negative in the sample), and 2003:12
25:779:40237:21:21:89:521:119:12:Times:12:Times:B:(the end of the sample).  Clearly,  they all converge to a limiting distribution around the
25:780:40328:21:0:89:521:98:12:Times:12:Times:B:Ramsey outcomes.  This convergence occurs from the estimated initial conditions at any
26:781:40445:0:21:90:522:673:12:Times:12:Times:B:date.  The fluctuations at the beginning of the simulation reflect the rise and fall of Amer-
26:782:40538:21:21:90:522:652:12:Times:12:Times:B:ican inflation that was temporarily off the equilibrium.  As shown in the lower left panel,
26:783:40629:21:21:90:522:631:12:Times:12:Times:B:we are likely to see some high inflation in the near future but such high inflation is caused
26:784:40722:21:20:90:522:610:12:Times:12:Times:B:purely by exogenous random shocks to inflation, as the government will continue to see
26:785:40808:20:21:90:522:590:12:Times:12:Times:B:no tradeoff between inflation and unemployment (see the lower right panel of Figure9).
26:786:40894:21:21:90:522:569:12:Times:12:Times:B:The government’s beliefs are volatile for a while but eventually the sum of coefficients on
26:787:40985:21:21:90:521:548:12:Times:12:Times:B:inflation converges to near zero.20Consequently, the mean dynamics suggest that inflation
26:788:41074:21:21:90:522:527:12:Times:12:Times:B:converges to around2%.   These long run properties foster a view of US monetary his-
26:789:41158:21:21:90:522:506:12:Times:12:Times:B:tory as a process of continual learning before inflation becomes stable around the Ramsey
26:790:41247:21:39:90:139:485:12:Times:12:Times:B:outcomes.
26:791:41256:39:21:90:522:446:12:Times:12:Times:B:IV.4.2.Small Variation Limits.In the previous section, we saw evidence from simulations
26:792:41343:21:21:90:522:425:12:Times:12:Times:B:that the economy converges to a limit distribution. In order to obtain more explicit analytic
26:793:41436:21:21:90:522:404:12:Times:12:Times:B:results, we consider small variation limits. While it is difficult to obtain explicit results for
26:794:41533:21:21:90:521:383:12:Times:12:Times:B:any arbitrary setting ofV, for smallerVthe beliefs drift at a slower rate, allowing us to
26:795:41622:21:21:90:522:362:12:Times:12:Times:B:approximate their evolution with a differential equation.  In particular, as in Sargent and
26:796:41713:21:21:90:521:341:12:Times:12:Times:B:Williams (2003), we letV=ε2ˆVand study limits asε→0. However,Pt|t→0asε→0, so
26:797:41789:21:21:90:521:320:12:Times:12:Times:B:we define a scaled matrixˆPt|t=Pt|t/εthat does not vanish. Sargent and Williams show that
26:798:41878:21:34:90:521:299:12:Times:12:Times:B:asε→0, the sequence{αt|t,ˆPt|t}generated by (9)-(10) converges weakly to the solution
26:799:41963:34:22:101:521:265:9:Times:10:Times:F:20In those volatile periods, the constant coefficient in the government’s estimated Phillips curve is often
26:800:42070:22:18:90:522:243:10:Times:10:Times:F:very large (on the order of 100) and the sum of the unemployment coefficients tends to be negative.  Thus,
26:801:42176:18:18:90:522:225:10:Times:10:Times:F:these two government Phillips curve parameters fall in the north-west quadrant of the graph discussed in
26:802:42280:18:18:90:521:207:10:Times:10:Times:F:SectionIV.2. If the sum of the inflation coefficients is negative, one can see from (16) that the government’s
26:803:42390:18:18:90:522:189:10:Times:10:Times:F:dynamic programming problem implies a large increase in inflation to restrain adverse fluctuations in unem-
26:804:42497:18:18:90:522:171:10:Times:10:Times:F:ployment.  Similarly, if this sum is positive, the government tends to generate a large rate of deflation.  Such
26:805:42609:18:18:90:522:153:10:Times:10:Times:F:values for the government parameters in our simulations are far outside of the range attained by the historical
26:806:42720:18:18:90:522:135:10:Times:10:Times:F:estimates, as shown in the third row of graphs in Figure6.  When by chance we draw a sequence of shocks
26:807:42823:18:18:90:522:117:10:Times:10:Times:F:that keeps these government Phillips curve parameters within their historical range, convergence to a stable
26:808:42931:18:0:90:306:99:10:Times:10:Times:F:inflation path occurs without large swings of inflation.

28:890:44033:21:21:89:522:319:12:Times:12:Times:B:then the government’s beliefs will converge to it asε→0andt→∞.   Note from (17)
28:891:44112:21:21:90:521:298:12:Times:12:Times:B:that the limiting beliefs satisfy the key least squares orthogonality condition (5) and hence
28:892:44205:21:21:90:522:277:12:Times:12:Times:B:comprise a self-confirming equilibrium. This orthogonality condition is the key identifying
28:893:44296:21:21:90:522:256:12:Times:12:Times:B:assumption in the government’s subjective model, and in the limit it is satisfied by the true
28:894:44389:21:21:90:123:235:12:Times:12:Times:B:model.
28:895:44395:21:21:101:521:214:12:Times:12:Times:A:In  Figure10we  plot  trajectories  of  the  mean  dynamics  for  the  government’s  beliefs
28:896:44487:21:21:90:522:193:12:Times:12:Times:B:starting from the initial conditions at the beginning of the sample.  Here we see that the
28:897:44577:21:21:90:522:172:12:Times:12:Times:B:mean dynamics converge to a stable self-confirming equilibrium in the long run. The self-
28:898:44666:21:49:90:257:151:12:Times:12:Times:B:confirming equilibrium beliefs are:
28:899:44701:49:0:152:460:102:12:Times:12:g_d0_f5:A: ̄α= [−0.0008−0.0000   0.9725   0.0000   0.0165   0.0688].
29:900:44790:0:21:90:521:673:12:Times:12:Times:B:Thus,  we  see  that  in  the  SCE  the  government  learns  the  true  value  ofθ0,  the  effect  of
29:901:44891:21:21:89:521:652:12:Times:12:Times:B:current inflation on unemployment. In the SCE, the government believes in a small tradeoff
29:902:44981:21:21:89:521:631:12:Times:12:Times:B:between inflation and unemployment, and so sets inflation slightly above the Ramsey level.
29:903:45071:21:20:89:521:610:12:Times:12:Times:B:In particular, the mean inflation rate in the SCE is2.24%instead of the Ramsey level of
29:904:45158:20:21:90:109:590:12:Times:12:Times:B:2%.
29:905:45161:21:21:101:521:569:12:Times:12:Times:A:However, the mean dynamics and the self-confirming equilibrium govern the dynamics
29:906:45243:21:21:90:522:548:12:Times:12:Times:B:of our model only for smallε. In practice,εmust be quite small, on the order of10−4, for
29:907:45331:21:21:90:521:527:12:Times:12:Times:B:the asymptotic approximations to be accurate. Thus, for our baseline estimatedVthe mean
29:908:45418:21:21:90:520:506:12:Times:12:Times:B:dynamics do not fully characterize the evolution of beliefs.  Loosely speaking, for anyV
29:909:45506:21:21:90:522:485:12:Times:12:Times:B:we get convergence to a limit distribution.  Asε→0this limit distribution converges to a
29:910:45594:21:42:89:224:464:12:Times:12:Times:B:self-confirming equilibrium.
29:911:45622:42:21:90:521:422:12:Times:12:Times:B:IV.5.Keynesian Direction of Fit.King and Watson (1994) discuss the importance of the
29:912:45706:21:21:90:522:401:12:Times:12:Times:B:direction in which a statistical Phillips curve is fit to the data.   They use the adjectives
29:913:45799:21:21:90:522:380:12:Times:12:Times:B:Keynesian and Classical to denote Phillips curves with unemployment on the right and left
29:914:45888:21:21:90:521:359:12:Times:12:Times:B:sides, respectively.21Unlike the version we consider above, the typical Samuelson-Solow
29:915:45975:21:21:90:522:338:12:Times:12:Times:B:Keynesian type of Phillips curve puts inflation on the left hand side of the regression.  In
29:916:46067:21:39:90:342:317:12:Times:12:Times:B:this case, the government’s Phelps problem becomes

30:943:46899:28:21:101:521:364:12:Times:12:Times:A:For comparison with our results above, we re-estimate the model using the Keynesian
30:944:46982:21:29:90:425:343:12:Times:12:Times:B:direction of fit. The estimated values for the structural parameters are:
30:945:47055:29:28:104:507:314:12:Times:12:g_d0_f5:A:u∗=5.7467,θ0=−0.0287,θ1=−0.0136,τ1=0.9881,ζ1=29.4602,ζ2=4.3244,
30:946:47118:28:21:90:522:286:12:Times:12:Times:B:and the log value of the posterior kernel at its peak is -271.6802, which is much smaller
30:947:47207:21:21:90:522:265:12:Times:12:Times:B:than that in the classical model. These estimates are somewhat different from those for the
30:948:47298:21:21:90:522:244:12:Times:12:Times:B:classical model reported in Table1. The biggest difference shows up in the estimate ofζ2.
30:949:47387:21:21:90:521:223:12:Times:12:Times:B:The significantly smaller value ofζ2in the Keynesian model implies large inflation shocks
30:950:47476:21:21:90:281:202:12:Times:9:Times:B:that tend to make the system unstable.22
30:951:47516:21:21:101:522:181:12:Times:12:Times:A:Figure11shows that even with the help of large inflation shocks, the fit is not nearly
30:952:47602:21:21:90:522:160:12:Times:12:Times:B:as good as the classical model, consistent with the findings of Cogley and Sargent (2004),
30:953:47692:21:18:90:522:139:12:Times:12:Times:B:who computed a sequence of Bayesian posterior odds for three models of the Phillips curve.
30:954:47782:18:7:101:324:121:9:Times:10:Symbol:F:22The results do not change much when we normalizeσ

30:956:47882:15:0:90:502:99:10:Times:10:Times:F:onσKdirectly, we letσt=σ1. This normalization implies thatσKis time-varying andσKt=ˆβ0,t|t−1σ1.

32:992:48594:29:21:90:522:374:12:Times:12:Times:B:The forecast errors reported in Figure12reinforce this point. The persistent over-prediction
32:993:48686:21:21:90:522:353:12:Times:12:Times:B:of inflation in the early 60s is caused by the misperceived tradeoff between inflation and
32:994:48776:21:21:90:522:332:12:Times:12:Times:B:unemployment under the estimated Keynesian Phillips curve,  as is shown in Figure13.
32:995:48860:21:21:90:522:311:12:Times:12:Times:B:We see there that, throughout the 1960s, the government’s Keynesian model implied an
32:996:48944:21:21:90:522:290:12:Times:12:Times:B:exploitable tradeoff.  However this tradeoff dwindles in the early 70s and the sum of the
32:997:49033:21:21:90:522:269:12:Times:12:Times:B:coefficients on inflation reversed its sign sharply in the mid-to-late 70s. In particular, from
32:998:49128:21:20:90:521:248:12:Times:12:Times:B:1975 to 1980 the government’s model shows no sign of a tradeoff (Figure13), and hence
32:999:49213:20:21:90:521:228:12:Times:12:Times:B:the model predicts lower inflation than actually occurred over this period (Figure12). It is
32:1000:49305:21:21:90:522:207:12:Times:12:Times:B:difficult to explain why the government did not cut inflation in the late 70s within the Key-
32:1001:49398:21:21:90:522:186:12:Times:12:Times:B:nesian story. One possibility is that because of large shocks in the government’s Keynesian
32:1002:49489:21:21:90:522:165:12:Times:12:Times:B:Phillips curve, policymakers decided to ignore the evidence that there was no tradeoff in the
32:1003:49582:21:21:90:522:144:12:Times:12:Times:B:later part of 1970s.  Instead, they produced high inflation based on an inherited Keynesian
32:1004:49673:21:20:90:273:123:12:Times:7:Times:B:belief that the tradeoff must be there.23
32:1005:49714:20:0:101:503:103:7:Times:10:Times:F:23This interpretation was provided by James Nason, based on oral descriptions by Fed policymakers.

33:1019:50251:21:21:90:522:283:12:Times:12:Times:B:if the government’s beliefs had differed from our estimates.  First, we will look at belief

34:1037:51105:41:21:90:522:365:12:Times:12:Times:B:the inflation coefficients is most negative.24Such continual adaptation of beliefs towards
34:1038:51195:21:21:90:522:344:12:Times:12:Times:B:a bigger inflation-unemployment tradeoff gives the government an incentive, through the
34:1039:51282:21:20:90:522:323:12:Times:12:Times:B:Phelps problem,  to run a high inflation policy.   This can be seen indirectly in Figure7
34:1040:51371:20:21:90:522:303:12:Times:12:Times:B:as the perceived costs of low inflation rise dramatically in the early 1970s.  To obtain a
34:1041:51461:21:21:90:522:282:12:Times:12:Times:B:more direct comparison,  suppose the government’s beliefs had been frozen at the 64:01
34:1042:51547:21:21:90:521:261:12:Times:12:Times:B:initial condition. As shown in Figure14, the inflation path would have been smoother and
34:1043:51635:21:21:90:522:240:12:Times:12:Times:B:avoided much of the two large run-ups of actual inflation in the 70s.  To take an opposite
34:1044:51725:21:21:90:522:219:12:Times:12:Times:B:example, we replace the government’s 64:01 beliefs with the 73:12 beliefs and fix them
34:1045:51811:21:21:90:521:198:12:Times:12:Times:B:throughout the history.  In this case, Figure14shows that inflation would have been much
34:1046:51899:21:21:90:522:177:12:Times:12:Times:B:higher than was actually experienced throughout the sample and would have continued to
34:1047:51985:21:35:90:173:156:12:Times:12:Times:B:stay around10%.
34:1048:52000:35:22:101:521:121:9:Times:10:Times:F:24See Sargent (1999, chapter 5) for how the sum of coefficients onπaffects the advice rendered by the
34:1049:52101:22:0:90:155:99:10:Times:10:Times:F:Phelps problem.
35:1050:52147:0:21:101:522:673:12:Times:12:Times:A:Figure15displays the second episode beginning with 1979:10, when Volcker’s disin-
35:1051:52228:21:21:90:522:652:12:Times:12:Times:B:flation policy took place.  As we’ve seen, if the government had held fixed to its 1973:12
35:1052:52318:21:21:90:522:631:12:Times:12:Times:B:perceived tradeoff,  inflation would have stayed much higher.   On the other hand,  if the
35:1053:52408:21:20:90:522:610:12:Times:12:Times:B:government’s belief at 1979:10 had been fixed throughout the rest of the history, inflation
35:1054:52499:20:21:90:522:590:12:Times:12:Times:B:would have come down to5%by 1986 due to the sequence of historical shocks, but there
35:1055:52583:21:21:90:522:569:12:Times:12:Times:B:would have been a tendency to return to a higher inflation level. These outcomes show the
35:1056:52672:21:21:90:522:548:12:Times:12:Times:B:importance of the adaptation of the government’s beliefs to achieve low inflation. With the
35:1057:52763:21:21:90:522:527:12:Times:12:Times:B:same sequence of historical shocks, actual inflation came down and remained low as shown
35:1058:52851:21:21:90:522:506:12:Times:12:Times:B:by the inflation path in Figure15.  Although the government’s beliefs at the end of 1979
35:1059:52939:21:21:90:521:485:12:Times:12:Times:B:favored a disinflation, Figure5shows how the government’s views continued to evolve to
35:1060:53025:21:21:90:522:464:12:Times:12:Times:B:favor a low inflation policy. The experience of disinflation and continued low inflation led
35:1061:53117:21:21:90:461:443:12:Times:12:Times:B:the government away from believing in an exploitable Phillips curve tradeoff.
35:1062:53194:21:21:101:521:422:12:Times:12:Times:A:These  exercises  suggest  that  while  the  rise  of  inflation  in  the  70s  was  caused  by  the
35:1063:53294:21:21:90:522:401:12:Times:12:Times:B:government’s misperceptions about the Phillips-curve relationship, the fall of inflation in
35:1064:53385:21:21:90:522:380:12:Times:12:Times:B:the 1980s can be rationalized by an econometric policy evaluation procedure that embodies

35:1067:53575:21:20:90:522:304:12:Times:12:Times:B:flexibility of our model in fitting the government’s beliefs.  In particular,  previous work
35:1068:53667:20:21:90:522:284:12:Times:12:Times:B:of Sims, Chung, Sargent, and Cho, Williams, and Sargent (but not Sargent and Williams)
35:1069:53753:21:21:90:521:263:12:Times:12:Times:B:had assumed a particular form for the key matrixVin (8) that governs the innovations to
35:1070:53840:21:21:90:522:242:12:Times:12:Times:B:the parameters in the government’s model.  We have already discussed theoretical reasons
35:1071:53928:21:21:90:521:221:12:Times:12:Times:B:why theVmatrix is so important and how different specifications of it greatly affect the
35:1072:54016:21:25:90:522:200:12:Times:12:Times:B:speed, direction, and stability of the learning dynamics. Previous work fixedVin ways that

36:1096:55305:21:21:90:520:244:12:Times:12:Times:B:gent and Williams (2003) show that RLS can be approximated by a Kalman filter withV
36:1097:55388:21:21:90:522:223:12:Times:12:Times:B:proportional toσ2E(ΦΦ′)−1.  In the figure, therefore, we use the sample estimate of the
36:1098:55475:21:20:89:521:202:12:Times:12:Times:B:second moment matrix and we choose the proportionality factor so that the newVmatrix
36:1099:55559:20:21:90:522:182:12:Times:12:Times:B:has the same norm as our estimate.  This choice ofVevidently leads to a substantial de-
36:1100:55646:21:21:90:522:161:12:Times:12:Times:B:terioration in fit. The government’s optimal policy suggests very low inflation (with a few
36:1101:55737:21:21:90:522:140:12:Times:12:Times:B:outliers) for almost the entire sample, which is what Sargent (1999) found. In particular, it
36:1102:55830:21:21:90:522:119:12:Times:12:Times:B:completely misses the two peaks in inflation in the 1970s. This illustrates a point made by
36:1103:55921:21:0:90:522:98:12:Times:12:Times:B:Chung (1990) and Sargent (1999), both of whom noted that their models implied that the

37:1118:56249:32:21:90:522:370:12:Times:12:Times:B:government should have cut inflation much earlier than actually occurred in the data. How-
37:1119:56339:21:21:90:522:349:12:Times:12:Times:B:ever, that outcome relied on attributing to the government very particular beliefs about how
37:1120:56431:21:21:90:522:328:12:Times:12:Times:B:its model changes over time. By allowing the data to inform our choice of these beliefs, we
37:1121:56522:21:21:90:373:307:12:Times:12:Times:B:are able much better to explain the rise and fall of inflation.
37:1122:56585:21:21:101:522:286:12:Times:12:Times:A:As discussed in SectionIV.4.2, the self-confirming equilibrium (SCE) governs the infla-
37:1123:56672:21:21:90:521:265:12:Times:12:Times:B:tion dynamics of our model only for a scaled-down value ofV.  Figure17shows another
37:1124:56755:21:21:90:522:244:12:Times:12:Times:B:example of the importance of theVmatrix where the originally estimatedVis scaled down
37:1125:56840:21:21:90:522:223:12:Times:12:Times:B:by0.01. Again, this inflation policy completely misses the rise and fall of actual inflation.
37:1126:56933:21:20:90:522:202:12:Times:12:Times:B:In this case,  the model remains close to the self-confirming equilibrium throughout the
37:1127:57021:20:21:90:356:182:12:Times:12:Times:B:sample, and we’ve seen that inflation is low in the SCE.
37:1128:57077:21:21:101:522:161:12:Times:12:Times:A:What are the long-run implications of the estimatedV?  The large value ofVsuggests
37:1129:57159:21:21:90:522:140:12:Times:12:Times:B:that  one  expect  escapes  from  SCE  to  be  frequent  even  if  the  inflation  rate  at  the  Nash
37:1130:57261:21:21:90:521:119:12:Times:12:Times:B:equilibrium is much higher. To illustrate this point, we changeθ0from its estimated value
37:1131:57350:21:0:90:522:98:12:Times:12:Times:B:of−0.0008to−1.0while keeping all the other estimates fixed. This implies that the Nash

38:1142:57606:40:21:89:521:347:12:Times:12:Times:B:inflation rate is around10%, while the socially optimal Ramsey level remains at 2%.  As
38:1143:57693:21:21:90:521:326:12:Times:12:Times:B:can be seen from Figure18, inflation tends to be high, but the large time-variation of the
38:1144:57783:21:21:90:522:305:12:Times:12:Times:B:drifting beliefs implied byVallows the dynamics to escape to low inflation repeatedly, and
38:1145:57873:21:21:90:521:284:12:Times:12:Times:B:there is no tendency for inflation to stay very long at the high level.  Thus, ourVmatrix is
38:1146:57965:21:21:90:522:263:12:Times:12:Times:B:consistent with repeated escapes in the long run, but they are difficult to detect under our
38:1147:58057:21:53:90:341:242:12:Times:12:Times:B:estimates because we estimated a low sacrifice ratio.

38:1149:58139:28:21:101:521:161:12:Times:12:Times:A:Sargent (1999) fashions two competing stories about the acceleration of US inflation
38:1150:58223:21:21:90:522:140:12:Times:12:Times:B:during the 1970s and Volcker’s conquest of inflation during the early 1980s. The first story,
38:1151:58316:21:21:90:522:119:12:Times:12:Times:B:called the ‘triumph of the natural rate theory’, explains the run up of inflation as reflecting
38:1152:58411:21:0:90:522:98:12:Times:12:Times:B:the monetary authority’s yielding to the temptation to exploit a non-expectational Phillips
39:1153:58533:0:21:90:522:673:12:Times:12:Times:B:curve, while Volcker’s conquest of inflation comes from the monetary authority first learn-
39:1154:58624:21:21:90:522:652:12:Times:12:Times:B:ing a correct rational expectations version of the natural unemployment rate hypothesis,
39:1155:58712:21:21:90:522:631:12:Times:12:Times:B:then  somehow  managing  to  commit  itself  to  the  Ramsey  policy.   The  competing  story,
39:1156:58806:21:20:90:522:610:12:Times:12:Times:B:called the ‘vindication of econometric policy evaluation’, shares the ‘triumph’ story’s ac-
39:1157:58897:20:21:90:522:590:12:Times:12:Times:B:count of the run up of inflation but differs about Volcker’s stabilization.  According to the
39:1158:58990:21:21:90:522:569:12:Times:12:Times:B:vindication story, the Fed never learned a sharp rational expectations version of the natural
39:1159:59083:21:21:90:522:548:12:Times:12:Times:B:rate hypothesis.  Instead, sequentially refitting themisspecifiednon-expectational Phillips
39:1160:59174:21:21:90:522:527:12:Times:12:Times:B:curve led the Fed to discover inflation-unemployment dynamics that prompted it, through
39:1161:59261:21:21:90:522:506:12:Times:12:Times:B:a Phelps problem, to stabilize inflation by the early 1980s. According to the vindication ar-
39:1162:59354:21:21:90:522:485:12:Times:12:Times:B:gument, allowing the data to speak continuously, even through estimates of a misspecified
39:1163:59443:21:21:90:457:464:12:Times:9:Times:B:Phillips curve model, did a good enough job to prompt the Fed to stabilize.26
39:1164:59520:21:21:101:522:443:12:Times:12:Times:A:Sargent (1999), Cho, Williams, and Sargent (2002), and Sargent and Williams (2003)
39:1165:59602:21:21:90:522:422:12:Times:12:Times:B:added structure and further features to the vindication story by analyzing versions of the
39:1166:59692:21:21:90:522:401:12:Times:12:Times:B:model in this paper. They a priori adopted parameter specifications that opened a substantial
39:1167:59785:21:21:90:522:380:12:Times:12:Times:B:gap between the Ramsey and Nash inflation outcomes, and their work discovered both the
39:1168:59871:21:21:90:522:359:12:Times:12:Times:B:mean  dynamics  that  on  average  push  outcomes  toward  the  Nash  inflation  level  and  the
39:1169:59967:21:20:90:424:338:12:Times:12:Times:B:escape dynamics that recurrently push it toward the Ramsey outcome.
39:1170:60034:20:21:101:521:318:12:Times:12:Times:A:The present paper produces estimates of the key parameters that ignite the mean dynam-
39:1171:60120:21:21:90:522:297:12:Times:12:Times:B:ics and escape dynamics.  As we have stressed, our empirical estimates deemphasize the
39:1172:60206:21:21:90:521:276:12:Times:12:Times:B:roles ofboththe mean dynamics and the escape dynamics and instead emphasize the short-
39:1173:60292:21:21:90:522:255:12:Times:12:Times:B:term impacts of shocks on government beliefs.  In addition, our estimate of a small gap
39:1174:60379:21:21:90:521:234:12:Times:12:Times:B:between the Nash and Ramsey inflation levels supports Blinder’s (1998) skepticism about
39:1175:60466:21:21:90:505:213:12:Times:12:Times:B:whether that gap is central quantitatively to the monetary authority’s decision problem.
39:1176:60554:21:21:101:522:192:12:Times:12:Times:A:Cogley and Sargent (2004) provides an alternative econometric explanation of US post
39:1177:60638:21:21:90:522:171:12:Times:12:Times:B:WWII inflation that also features the interaction of a government learning process and a
39:1178:60726:21:29:90:522:150:12:Times:12:Times:B:sequence of Phelps problems.  Cogley and Sargent’s learning process has the government
39:1179:60812:29:22:101:521:121:9:Times:10:Times:F:26The oral tradition in which the vindication story originates, which Sargent heard from Albert Ando, saw
39:1180:60917:22:0:90:301:99:10:Times:10:Times:F:it as a puzzle that Volcker waited so long to stabilize.

40:1182:61094:21:21:90:291:652:12:Times:12:Times:B:pectations version of a natural rate model.
40:1183:61137:21:21:101:522:631:12:Times:12:Times:A:Primiceri (2003b) also develops a learning model to explain the rise and fall of US infla-
40:1184:61227:21:20:90:522:610:12:Times:12:Times:B:tion. He estimates his model on US data and finds that its fit is comparable to an atheoretical
40:1185:61322:20:21:90:522:590:12:Times:12:Times:B:VAR as a description of the data.  Like us, he emphasizes that inflation remained high in
40:1186:61411:21:21:90:522:569:12:Times:12:Times:B:the 1970s due to the government’s perception that disinflation was too costly. Unlike us, a
40:1187:61502:21:21:90:522:548:12:Times:12:Times:B:key component of his model is the mismeasurement of the natural rate of unemployment,
40:1188:61587:21:21:90:522:527:12:Times:12:Times:B:which caused policy to be looser than policymakers thought. Our paper differ substantially
40:1189:61677:21:21:90:522:506:12:Times:12:Times:B:from his in its theoretical structure. Our true economy is a rational expectations natural rate
40:1190:61772:21:21:90:522:485:12:Times:12:Times:B:model, and policymakers can eventually converge to a self-confirming equilibrium, a type
40:1191:61860:21:21:90:522:464:12:Times:12:Times:B:of rational expectations equilibrium. Primiceri’s main focus is on a backward-looking Key-
40:1192:61950:21:21:90:522:443:12:Times:12:Times:B:nesian model, with no role for expectations.27We view the rational expectations natural
40:1193:62037:21:39:90:444:422:12:Times:12:Times:B:rate theory as a useful starting point in analyzing the behavior of inflation.
40:1194:62115:39:28:258:353:383:12:Times:10:Times:A:VII.CONCLUSION
40:1195:62129:28:21:101:528:355:12:Times:12:Times:A:Our estimates attribute the differing inflation outcomes over the post-war period to changes
40:1196:62221:21:21:90:522:334:12:Times:12:Times:B:over time in the monetary authority’s beliefs. According to our estimated model, that learn-
40:1197:62313:21:21:90:441:313:12:Times:12:Times:B:ing process explains the delayed reaction to rising inflation in that period.
40:1198:62390:21:21:101:521:292:12:Times:12:Times:A:Our empirical results suggest an interpretation that differs from the work we build on.
40:1199:62477:21:20:90:521:271:12:Times:12:Times:B:Sargent (1999) and Cho, Williams, and Sargent (2002) suggested that US experience could
40:1200:62564:20:21:90:522:251:12:Times:12:Times:B:be explained by convergence to a high Nash inflation level coupled with occasional escapes
40:1201:62654:21:21:90:522:230:12:Times:12:Times:B:to a lower Ramsey level. As discussed by Sargent and Williams (2003), these outcomes also
40:1202:62743:21:21:90:522:209:12:Times:12:Times:B:occur in our model when we set parameters of the true Phillips curve to allow a larger gap
40:1203:62833:21:21:90:522:188:12:Times:12:Times:B:between the Nash and Ramsey levels of inflation, and when we also impose what, relative
40:1204:62920:21:21:90:521:167:12:Times:12:Times:B:to our estimates, is a scaled-down innovation volatility matrixVin the government’s belief-
40:1205:63011:21:25:90:521:146:12:Times:12:Times:B:drift dynamics (8).  However, with our estimates, it appears that oscillations between the
40:1206:63101:25:22:101:521:121:9:Times:10:Times:F:27Primiceri also considers a New Keynesian rational expectations model, but it fits substantially worse
40:1207:63204:22:0:90:251:99:10:Times:10:Times:F:than his backward-looking specification.
41:1208:63275:0:21:90:522:673:12:Times:12:Times:B:Nash and Ramsey levels of inflation, driven alternately by the mean dynamics and then the
41:1209:63364:21:21:90:521:652:12:Times:12:Times:B:escape dynamics of, say, the Sargent-Williams (2003) model, were not the main forces that
41:1210:63453:21:21:90:522:631:12:Times:12:Times:B:accounted for the inflation process that the monetary authorities in the US chose to preside
41:1211:63545:21:20:90:522:610:12:Times:12:Times:B:over during the post WWII years. For one thing, our estimates of the Nash level of inflation
41:1212:63637:20:21:90:521:590:12:Times:12:Times:B:turned out to be near the Ramsey level.28Instead, the rise in inflation was driven by the
41:1213:63726:21:21:90:522:569:12:Times:12:Times:B:interaction of shocks and government beliefs, and the fall in inflation was due to changes in
41:1214:63819:21:21:90:522:548:12:Times:12:Times:B:those beliefs.  If the US monetary authority remembers the lessons that prompted Volcker
41:1215:63907:21:52:90:522:527:12:Times:12:Times:B:to disinflate in the early 1980s, then maybe Volcker’s conquest of US inflation will endure.

44:1364:68283:21:21:90:522:412:12:Times:12:Times:B:models of unemployment and inflation. With the standard prior settings proposed by Sims
44:1365:68370:21:21:90:521:391:12:Times:12:Times:B:and Zha (1998), the log MDD value is 172.05 for the BVAR with one lag and 244.65 for
44:1366:68454:21:21:90:522:370:12:Times:12:Times:B:the BVAR with 13 lags. By the measure of Bayes factors, the BVARs (including the BVAR
44:1367:68539:21:21:90:522:349:12:Times:12:Times:B:with only one lag) dominate our learning model.  Note that this result may be sensitive to
44:1368:68629:21:21:90:522:328:12:Times:12:Times:B:the priors used in estimating the models.  The prior for our model was loose along several
44:1369:68719:21:21:90:522:307:12:Times:12:Times:B:dimensions, which means that the MDD may be penalizing our model more heavily than
44:1370:68801:21:21:90:134:286:12:Times:12:Times:B:the VAR.
44:1371:68809:21:21:101:521:265:12:Times:12:Times:A:Higher  Bayes  factors  do  not  necessarily  imply  that  BVARs  outperform  our  learning
44:1372:68900:21:21:90:521:244:12:Times:12:Times:B:model in explaining the rise and fall of inflation.   FigureE1displays the forecast from
44:1373:68988:21:21:90:522:223:12:Times:12:Times:B:the BVAR(1). The68%and90%error bands are produced by simulating the VAR shocks
44:1374:69066:21:20:90:522:202:12:Times:12:Times:B:while holding the parameter estimates fixed at those obtained using the 60:01-03:12 sam-
44:1375:69154:20:21:90:522:182:12:Times:12:Times:B:ple, the same procedure as we did for our learning model. As can be seen, this BVAR fails
44:1376:69243:21:21:90:522:161:12:Times:12:Times:B:to predict any rise of inflation with a significant probability.  And the upper90%band is
44:1377:69332:21:21:90:170:140:12:Times:12:Times:B:well below10%.

46:1432:71046:28:21:101:521:223:12:Times:12:Times:A:In this appendix, we report probability bands on key government policy variables.  We
46:1433:71131:21:20:90:521:202:12:Times:12:Times:B:first assess how sharply inflation set by the government’s policy (xt−1) is estimated. Figure

46:1435:71311:21:21:90:522:161:12:Times:12:Times:B:ogenous random inflation shocks.  Clearly, the bands themselves track the rise and fall of
46:1436:71401:21:21:90:212:140:12:Times:12:Times:B:actual inflation very well.
46:1437:71428:21:21:101:521:119:12:Times:12:Times:A:The key insight into the intricate interactions between shocks and government beliefs is
