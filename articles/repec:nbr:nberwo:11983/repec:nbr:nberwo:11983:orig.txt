2:28:1300:28:14:71:539:581:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This paper shows that securitization reduces the influence of bank financial condition on loan supply.
2:29:1402:14:15:71:539:567:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Low-cost funding and increased balance-sheet liquidity raise bank willingness to approve mortgages

2:31:1610:14:14:71:539:538:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:mortgages easy to sell (non-jumbos).  Thus, the increasing depth of the mortgage secondary market
2:32:1707:14:14:71:539:524:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:fostered  by  securitization  has  reduced  the  impact  of  local  funding  shocks  on  credit  supply.    By
2:33:1817:14:14:71:539:510:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:extension, securitization has weakened the link from bank funding conditions to credit supply in

3:46:2145:0:30:72:169:690:144:Times:144:Times:I. INTRODUCTION 
3:47:2159:30:28:107:533:660:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Liquidity transformation – funding illiquid loans with liquid deposits – has been viewed 
3:48:2248:28:27:72:537:632:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:as a fundamental role for banks.  Diamond and Dybvig (1983) argue that banks improve welfare 
3:49:2341:27:28:72:540:605:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:by allowing depositors to diversify liquidity risk while investing in high-return, illiquid projects.  
3:50:2444:28:28:72:528:577:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Securitization has changed the way banks provide liquidity.  Today, while real projects remain 
3:51:2539:28:27:72:530:549:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:illiquid, loans have become more liquid because banks often securitize them, thereby replacing 
3:52:2634:27:28:72:501:522:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:deposits with bonds as the primary source of finance.  Securitization has grown fastest in 
3:53:2725:28:27:72:523:494:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mortgage markets because the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs, i.e. Fannie Mae and 
3:54:2814:27:28:72:520:467:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Freddie Mac) enhance mortgage-loan liquidity.1  By regulation, however, the GSEs only buy 
3:55:2904:28:28:72:541:439:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mortgages below a given size threshold (the jumbo-loan cutoff).  Mortgages below this threshold 
3:56:3000:28:27:72:534:411:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:are more liquid than those above the threshold.  This paper shows that bank financial condition, 
3:57:3097:27:28:72:516:384:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:while continuing to affect bank acceptance rates on illiquid loans (jumbos), has no effect on 
3:58:3191:28:27:72:526:356:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:acceptance rates on liquid loans (non-jumbos).  Thus, securitization has reduced the impact of 
3:59:3286:27:28:72:275:329:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:bank financial condition on credit supply. 
3:60:3329:28:27:108:531:301:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:We study mortgages because their liquidity falls sharply around the jumbo-loan cutoff.  
3:61:3417:27:28:72:524:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Such a discrete and exogenous drop in liquidity is difficult to find elsewhere.2  To exploit this 
3:62:3515:28:28:72:526:246:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:special feature of the U.S. mortgage market, we first regress the difference in acceptance rates 
3:63:3612:28:27:72:496:218:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:for non-jumbo and jumbo mortgages on bank financial variables and other controls.  By 
3:64:3698:27:28:72:521:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:comparing relative acceptance rates in our regressions, we ‘difference out’ unobservable but 
3:65:3791:28:27:72:510:163:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:potentially confounding demand-side factors.  The results suggest that this acceptance-rate 
3:66:3883:27:89:72:318:136:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:difference widens at financially constrained banks. 
4:67:3935:89:0:303:309:47:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:2
4:68:3936:0:27:108:520:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:We further show that while acceptance rates depend on financial condition for jumbo 
4:69:4020:27:28:72:521:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mortgages, acceptance rates for non-jumbos do not vary with the originating bank’s financial 
4:70:4113:28:27:72:533:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:position because these loans can be easily sold.  Thus, loan liquidity seems to eliminate the link 
4:71:4212:27:28:72:514:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:from a bank’s financial condition to its willingness to supply credit.  Mortgage liquidity has 
4:72:4307:28:28:72:535:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:increased rapidly over the past 30 years, in part through GSE subsidies.  Private-sector financial 
4:73:4406:28:27:72:542:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:institutions, however, have also increased loan liquidity in other sectors by securitizing consumer 
4:74:4506:27:28:71:465:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and business loans.  Our results therefore extend into these other markets as well. 
4:75:4590:28:27:107:521:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Figure 1 illustrates our main findings.  Panel A compares the aggregate probability of 
4:76:4677:27:28:71:536:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:accepting mortgages originated by banks in the top quartile of the funding-cost distribution with 
4:77:4775:28:28:71:529:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:those in the bottom quartile of this distribution, where funding costs equal the ratio of a bank’s 
4:78:4874:28:27:71:520:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:total interest expenses on deposits to total deposits.  The figure suggests that banks with high 
4:79:4971:27:28:71:527:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:funding costs are reluctant to approve jumbo mortgages, relative to competing banks with low 
4:80:5064:28:27:71:534:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:funding costs.  On average, the acceptance rate for jumbo mortgages rises from 88.4 percent for 
4:81:5160:27:28:71:513:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:high-cost banks to 91.1 percent for low-cost banks.  In contrast, the acceptance rate for non-
4:82:5254:28:27:71:518:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:jumbo mortgages barely reflects the originating bank’s funding costs at all.3  This difference 
4:83:5349:27:28:72:530:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:makes sense because banks usually fund accepted jumbo mortgages with deposits.  In contrast, 
4:84:5442:28:28:72:507:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:banks have the option to sell non-jumbo mortgages to the GSEs, thus avoiding the need to 
4:85:5531:28:27:72:516:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:finance them.  Panel B reports a similar set of results but focuses on balance-sheet liquidity, 
4:86:5627:27:28:71:537:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:defined as the ratio of marketable securities and federal funds sold to assets.  Like funding costs, 
4:87:5728:28:27:72:536:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:bank liquidity seems to matter less for non-jumbo mortgages (because the bank holds the option 
4:88:5823:27:28:72:416:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:to sell the loan) than for jumbos (because the bank must hold the loan). 
4:89:5896:28:28:108:501:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Funding costs and liquidity may also affect the characteristics of a bank’s flow of 
4:90:5980:28:59:71:506:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mortgage applications.  For example, loan-application size may be endogenous if funding-
5:91:6068:59:0:304:310:42:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:3
5:92:6069:0:27:72:526:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:constrained banks encourage some customers to reduce their borrowing below the jumbo-loan 
5:93:6159:27:28:72:510:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:cutoff, either by offering pricing incentives or by threatening to reject the loan.  Panel C of 
5:94:6255:28:27:72:539:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Figure 1 tests this idea using marginal loan applications, defined as those within 5 percent of the 
5:95:6355:27:28:72:519:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:jumbo-loan cutoff (i.e. between 95 percent and 105 percent of the cutoff).  The flow of these 
5:96:6449:28:28:72:541:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:marginal applications is related both to bank cost of funds and liquidity.  We find that banks with 
5:97:6549:28:27:72:507:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:high funding costs or low levels of liquidity receive a larger share of non-jumbo mortgage 
5:98:6640:27:28:72:537:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:applications, relative to other banks.  Thus, banks better positioned to originate and hold illiquid 
5:99:6741:28:27:72:524:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:loans – banks with low cost of deposits and/or a large buffer of liquid assets – supply more of 
5:100:6837:27:28:72:524:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:these loans.  These banks are more willing to approve jumbo loans, and they receive a greater 
5:101:6931:28:28:72:232:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:flow of jumbo-loan applications. 
5:102:6964:28:27:108:520:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:This paper contributes to several strands of research at the intersection of finance and 
5:103:7053:27:28:72:511:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:macroeconomics.  First, the results suggest that propagation of local business cycles across 
5:104:7146:28:27:72:511:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:regions is less pronounced today than in the past, due in part to the developing depth of the 
5:105:7240:27:28:72:528:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mortgage secondary markets.  In contrast to the jumbo-loan market, we find no link between a 
5:106:7333:28:27:71:528:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:bank’s funding or liquidity and its propensity to supply non-jumbo mortgages.  Hence, there is 
5:107:7428:27:28:71:495:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:no reason to expect that a reduction in local banking capacity will affect most mortgage 
5:108:7517:28:28:71:497:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:borrowers.  This result matters quantitatively because more than 90 percent of mortgage 
5:109:7605:28:27:71:529:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:applications fall below the jumbo-loan cutoff, and because shocks to the local financial system 
5:110:7701:27:28:71:533:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:can potentially worsen business downturns.4  Integration of the banking system has reduced the 
5:111:7796:28:27:72:531:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:effect of these local shocks by allowing capital to flow more freely through the banking system

6:119:8359:27:28:72:508:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:market in mortgages has likely dampened the effects of monetary policy on real economic 
6:120:8447:28:28:72:523:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:activity.  According to the ‘bank lending’ channel of monetary policy, central banks can slow 
6:121:8541:28:27:72:523:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:real activity by raising bank funding costs (e.g. the cost of deposits) and thereby constrain the 
6:122:8639:27:28:72:534:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:supply of credit.  Our results suggest that there is no link between bank funding costs and credit 
6:123:8738:28:27:72:522:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:supplied to the non-jumbo mortgage market.  Hence, the lending channel to borrowers in this 
6:124:8830:27:28:72:501:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:market has been mitigated by the growth of securitization.5  Together with studies on the 
6:125:8920:28:28:72:540:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:increasing size and geographical scope of banks, our results thus suggest that the overall potency 
6:126:9019:28:27:72:526:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of monetary policy ought to be reduced relative to earlier times when banks were smaller, less 
6:127:9114:27:28:72:503:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:well integrated with other banks, and less able to sell their loans into secondary markets.6 
6:128:9206:28:27:107:529:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Finally, our results shed more light on how non-financial firms’ cost of capital depends 
6:129:9295:27:28:71:498:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:on their bank’s financial condition.7  Most of the extant research has tested for effects of 
6:130:9388:28:27:71:524:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:monetary policy or bank solvency (capital) shocks on credit supply to bank-dependent firms.8 
6:131:9480:27:28:72:531:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Our results indicate that securitization increases banks’ willingness to supply credit to all (even 
6:132:9580:28:28:72:533:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:illiquid) sectors, but that high costs of deposits or limited balance-sheet liquidity only affect the 
6:133:9682:28:27:72:523:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:supply of illiquid loans (jumbo mortgages here, although the result likely generalizes to other 
6:134:9778:27:28:71:514:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:illiquid lending such as small business credit).  Like the earlier literature, we also find some 
6:135:9875:28:27:71:540:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:evidence that bank solvency affects credit supply -- better capitalized banks receive a larger flow 
6:136:9975:27:28:71:519:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of jumbo applications than less capitalized ones.  However, we find no direct link from bank 
6:137:10068:28:87:71:251:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:capital to mortgage acceptance rates.

7:140:10156:36:31:72:229:672:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:A. The Growth of Securitization 
7:141:10187:31:27:108:542:641:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Credit markets have been reshaped by the growth of trading in secondary markets.  Banks 
7:142:10275:27:28:72:503:614:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:traditionally originated and held loans on their balance sheets, and thus credit availability 
7:143:10369:28:28:72:525:586:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:depended in part on the cost and availability of funds to banks.  Over the past quarter century, 
7:144:10466:28:27:72:519:558:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:however, loan securitization has reshaped lending markets.  Securitization typically involves 
7:145:10560:27:28:72:530:531:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pooling the cash flows from a number of similar assets (e.g. mortgages or credit card accounts) 
7:146:10656:28:27:72:521:503:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and selling the pool to a separate legal entity known as a special purpose vehicle (SPV).  The 
7:147:10751:27:28:72:500:476:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pooling process results in a diversified portfolio of cash flows, which are used to support 
7:148:10843:28:28:72:542:448:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:payments on debt securities issued by the SPV.  Often, the cash flows come with some additional 
7:149:10939:28:27:72:535:420:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:implicit or explicit guarantees from the originating financial institution (or the originator retains 
7:150:11041:27:28:72:518:393:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the residual or equity tranche in the SPV).  Creating this separate SPV isolates the cash-flow 
7:151:11136:28:27:72:523:365:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:generating assets and/or collateral so that securities issued by the SPV are not a general claim 
7:152:11233:27:28:72:524:338:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:against the issuer, just against those assets.  Cash flows from the original pool of loans can be 
7:153:11331:28:27:72:531:310:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:further stripped and repackaged based on various characteristics (e.g., the prepayment behavior 
7:154:11427:27:28:72:302:283:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:or payment priority) to enhance their liquidity.9 
7:155:11476:28:28:116:508:255:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Table 1 illustrates the growing quantitative significance of loan securitization for 
7:156:11561:28:27:72:515:227:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:different types of loans over time.  The Table presents the amount of loans outstanding and  
7:157:11654:27:28:72:502:200:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:securitized for six loan categories between 1976 and 2003.  Consider, for example, home 
7:158:11742:28:27:72:527:172:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mortgages:  In 1976, the amount of securitized home mortgages was $28 billion; by the end of 
7:159:11835:27:28:72:517:145:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:2003 the total amount of securitized home mortgages had grown almost 150 times, reaching 
7:160:11924:28:70:72:534:117:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:$4.2 trillion.  Over the same period, the amount of home mortgages outstanding grew almost 15 
8:161:12018:70:0:303:309:47:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:6
8:162:12019:0:27:72:529:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:times, from $489 billion to $7.3 trillion.  Mortgage securitization has grown 10 times as fast as 
8:163:12117:27:28:72:157:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the market itself! 
8:164:12136:28:27:117:538:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Securitization has also made inroads in the financing of other kinds of loans, albeit less 
8:165:12227:27:28:72:513:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:dramatically.  In 1976 there was no securitization of commercial mortgages, business loans 
8:166:12318:28:28:71:536:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(commercial and industrial, or C&I, loans) or consumer loans.  By the end of 2003, $294 billion 
8:167:12414:28:27:71:523:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of commercial mortgages were securitized, $104 billion worth of C&I loans were securitized, 
8:168:12506:27:28:71:528:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:along with $658 billion worth of consumer loans.  Figure 2 illustrates these trends graphically. 
8:169:12603:28:27:107:532:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:To understand why securitization of mortgages has taken off so dramatically, one needs 
8:170:12690:27:28:71:509:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:to appreciate the role of The Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the 
8:171:12779:28:28:71:522:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac).  These two so-called Government-
8:172:12865:28:27:71:503:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) were created by the U.S. Congress to provide stability and 
8:173:12953:27:28:71:528:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:liquidity to the market for residential mortgages, and to promote access to mortgage credit and 
8:174:13049:28:27:71:535:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:home ownership.  Together, they have played the dominant role in fostering the development of 
8:175:13143:27:28:71:540:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the secondary market.  Starting in the 1970s, the GSEs began to purchase mortgages from banks, 
8:176:13238:28:27:71:532:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:savings institutions and other mortgage originators.  As shown by Frame and White (2005), the 
8:177:13332:27:28:71:541:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:GSEs have played an increasingly important part in mortgage markets since the early 1980s.  For 
8:178:13428:28:28:71:514:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:example, by 1990 about 25 percent of the $2.9 trillion in outstanding mortgages were either 
8:179:13520:28:27:71:531:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:purchased and held or purchased and securitized by the two major GSEs.  By 2003, this market 
8:180:13613:27:28:71:521:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:share had increased to 47 percent.  In other words, today approximately half of all mortgages 
8:181:13707:28:27:71:527:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:outstanding were sold to the GSEs after origination (neither Fannie nor Freddie is permitted to 
8:182:13803:27:28:71:233:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:originate mortgages themselves). 
8:183:13836:28:28:107:517:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The GSEs enhance mortgage liquidity either by buying and holding mortgages or by 
8:184:13917:28:59:71:528:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:securitizing them.  When the GSEs buy mortgages, they bear both credit and interest rate risk.  
9:185:14013:59:0:304:310:42:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:7
9:186:14014:0:27:72:522:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:When GSEs securitize mortgages, they either buy them and issue mortgage-backed securities 
9:187:14104:27:28:72:532:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(MBS), or they just sell credit protection to the original lender.  In the first case, the originating 
9:188:14207:28:27:72:501:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:bank retains no stake in the mortgage.  In the second case, the bank continues to fund the 
9:189:14298:27:28:72:520:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mortgage and bear the interest rate risk, but obtains the option to sell it off as an MBS.  In all 
9:190:14397:28:28:72:248:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:cases, the GSEs enhance liquidity.10 
9:191:14433:28:27:108:530:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Most important, the GSE charters limit the size of mortgages that they may purchase or 
9:192:14520:27:28:72:527:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:securitize.  For example, in 2005 the GSEs could only purchase ‘non-jumbo’ mortgages, those 
9:193:14612:28:27:72:527:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:below $359,650.11  This cutoff is set annually based on a housing price index.  Thus, there is a 
9:194:14709:27:28:72:528:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:discrete drop in mortgage liquidity around the jumbo-loan cutoff that is exogenous to financial 
9:195:14805:28:34:72:187:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:intermediary decisions. 
9:196:14829:34:30:72:242:426:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B. Mortgage Market Segmentation 
9:197:14860:30:28:108:518:396:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The GSE charter limitation conveniently splits the market into a liquid segment (non-
9:198:14945:28:27:72:531:368:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:jumbo mortgages) and an illiquid segment (jumbo mortgages).  How do we know that liquidity 
9:199:15036:27:28:72:534:341:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:really falls at the cutoff?  Perhaps the private sector steps in and seamlessly facilitates mortgage 
9:200:15137:28:27:71:535:313:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:securitization in the jumbo market.  First, in contrast to jumbos, most non-jumbo mortgages can 
9:201:15233:27:28:71:530:286:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:be sold by the original lender.  Second, the GSEs are the only financial institution that will buy 
9:202:15332:28:28:71:523:258:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:individual mortgage loans.  Thus, securitization of non-jumbos would be especially costly for 
9:203:15426:28:27:71:524:230:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:small banks without the GSEs.  Third, mortgage-backed securities issued by GSEs come with 
9:204:15516:27:28:71:536:203:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:required capital only one-fourth as large as required capital for similar securities (such as jumbo-
9:205:15616:28:27:71:541:175:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mortgage securitizations) issued by private financial institutions under the Basel Capital Accord.  
9:206:15716:27:28:71:535:148:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Fourth, there is a sharp increase in the frequency of mortgage applications just below the jumbo-
9:207:15813:28:28:71:519:120:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:loan cutoff, suggesting that the GSE withdrawal from the jumbo market increases the cost of 
9:208:15905:28:45:71:540:92:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:borrowing.  And, more directly, the pricing of mortgages changes around the jumbo-loan cutoff.  
10:209:16001:45:0:303:309:47:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:8
10:210:16002:0:27:72:528:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Yields on non-jumbo loans are on the order of 20 basis points lower than the yields on jumbos 
10:211:16096:27:28:71:504:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(e.g. Mckenzie (2002) provides a survey of this literature).  If liquidity fell gradually with 
10:212:16191:28:27:71:533:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mortgage size, yields would rise smoothly with size.  Instead, yields jump discretely around the 
10:213:16288:27:28:72:535:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:jumbo-loan cutoff.  Moreover, this yield differential has been relatively stable over time (Figure 
10:214:16387:28:28:72:96:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:3).12 
10:215:16392:28:27:108:513:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The jumbo/non-jumbo spread would seem to offer a natural measure of the value of 
10:216:16473:27:28:72:535:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:liquidity from the GSEs.  Passmore, Sherlund and Burgess (2005) present a model in which this 
10:217:16567:28:27:72:504:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:spread rises with bank funding costs, and they use aggregate data to show that this spread 
10:218:16658:27:28:72:540:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:increases as the availability of core deposits declines.  There are no empirical studies testing how 
10:219:16759:28:28:72:530:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the jumbo/non-jumbo spread varies across lenders because pricing information by lender is not 
10:220:16853:28:27:72:541:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:available.  Our approach differs from the extant studies of pricing.  We focus on the quantity side 
10:221:16953:27:28:72:504:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of the market, where loan applications can be linked to the originating bank, and test how 
10:222:17044:28:27:72:235:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:approval rates vary across banks. 
10:223:17078:27:28:108:522:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:We test whether a lender’s willingness to approve a jumbo mortgage is affected by its 
10:224:17164:28:27:72:539:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:financing conditions.  Funding costs should not affect a bank’s willingness to make a non-jumbo 
10:225:17260:27:28:72:531:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:loan – the loan can be sold to one of the GSEs.  Funding costs, however, should affect a bank’s 
10:226:17356:28:28:72:539:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:willingness to approve jumbo mortgages, since the bank has to hold and hence fund these loans.  
10:227:17452:28:27:72:541:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Similarly, banks with relatively low holdings of liquid assets may be reluctant to approve illiquid 
10:228:17552:27:28:72:540:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:jumbo loans because they are difficult to sell, while liquidity concerns should not affect approval 
10:229:17652:28:27:72:522:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:rates for non-jumbo mortgages that banks can choose either to sell or to hold.  Our main tests 
10:230:17747:27:28:72:541:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:focus on the willingness of banks to approve jumbo mortgages, relative to non-jumbo mortgages, 
10:231:17842:28:87:72:404:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:as a function of the bank’s funding costs and balance-sheet liquidity.

11:234:17940:36:31:72:251:672:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:A. Sample of Mortgage Applications 
11:235:17974:31:27:108:538:641:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:To build our dataset, we start with a comprehensive sample of mortgage applications and 
11:236:18062:27:28:72:532:614:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:originations that have been collected by the Federal Reserve since 1992 under provisions of the 
11:237:18158:28:28:72:525:586:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA).  The sample covers loan applications from 1992 to 
11:238:18245:28:27:72:540:558:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:2003.  HMDA was passed into law by Congress in 1975 and expanded in 1988, with the purpose 
11:239:18336:27:28:72:542:531:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of informing the public (and the regulators) about whether or not financial institutions adequately 
11:240:18436:28:27:72:477:503:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:serve local credit needs.  In addition, regulators use the HMDA data to help identify 
11:241:18522:27:28:72:542:476:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:discriminatory lending.  These data are collected by the Federal Reserve under Regulation C, and 
11:242:18619:28:28:72:540:448:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:all regulated financial institutions (e.g. commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions, and 
11:243:18721:28:27:72:385:420:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mortgage companies) with assets above $30 million must report. 
11:244:18784:27:28:108:528:393:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The HMDA data include information on the year of the application (although we know 
11:245:18867:28:27:72:537:365:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:nothing about exactly when during a given year a loan application was made), the dollar amount 
11:246:18962:27:28:72:527:338:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of the loan, and whether or not the loan was accepted.  The dataset also has information on the 
11:247:19058:28:27:72:519:310:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:identity of the lender, which we use to measure the funding and liquidity variables described 
11:248:19152:27:28:72:534:283:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:below.  To control for loan risk, we can observe the location of the property, the sex and race of 
11:249:19251:28:28:72:541:255:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the applicant, and the level of the applicant’s income as well as the income-to-loan-size ratio.  To 
11:250:19352:28:27:72:508:227:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:control for economic conditions near the property, we know whether or not the property is 
11:251:19442:27:28:72:532:200:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:located within an urban Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), the share of the population that is 
11:252:19539:28:27:72:529:172:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:minority in the property’s Census Tract, and the median income in that Census Tract.  We will 
11:253:19633:27:28:72:538:145:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:control for all of these factors in our models to absorb variation in the risk characteristics of loan 
11:254:19736:28:28:72:515:117:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:applicants.  There is unfortunately no information on the market value of the property in the 
11:255:19830:28:42:72:138:89:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:HMDA data.

12:257:19843:0:27:108:525:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Figure 4 plots a histogram of the frequency distribution of mortgage applications from 
12:258:19930:27:28:72:515:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:HMDA data over the 1992-2003 period (on the order of 106 million loan applications), as a 
12:259:20020:28:27:72:542:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:function of the ratio of loan size to the jumbo-loan cutoff (Panel A).13  The figure shows first that 
12:260:20122:27:28:72:517:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:most mortgage applications come in below the cutoff value (i.e. most mortgages can be sold 
12:261:20213:28:28:72:487:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:easily into the secondary market).  Also, we see a sharp spike in the frequency of loan 
12:262:20301:28:27:72:485:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:applications just below the cutoff.  This spike suggests that the applicant pool itself is 
12:263:20392:27:28:72:539:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:endogenously determined, at least in part, by financial conditions.  That is, we know that interest 
12:264:20492:28:27:72:533:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:rates are higher for jumbo loans, thus some applicants with loan demand “near” the jumbo-loan 
12:265:20586:27:28:72:490:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:cutoff may borrow less than they otherwise would to take advantage of the lower rate.  
12:266:20673:28:28:108:542:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Panel B of Figure 4 reports the average acceptance rate for mortgages, again as a function 
12:267:20764:28:27:72:532:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of the ratio of the loan amount to the jumbo-loan cutoff.  As in Panel A, we see a sharp upward 
12:268:20860:27:28:72:535:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:spike in the acceptance rate for loans just below the cutoff.  The high acceptance rate just below 
12:269:20959:28:27:72:535:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the cutoff suggests that some of the most creditworthy clients borrow less than the cutoff, either 
12:270:21058:27:28:72:535:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:to take advantage of lower rates or because the lender would not approve a jumbo loan for these 
12:271:21154:28:27:72:525:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:clients.  (We address this loan-application size endogeneity in Sections V.B-V.D.)  The figure 
12:272:21249:27:28:72:491:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:also shows that acceptance rates appear to fall off sharply for very small loans, and the 
12:273:21339:28:28:72:539:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:acceptance rate also falls off gradually as loan size increases beyond the jumbo-loan cutoff.  The 
12:274:21438:28:27:72:522:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:very small loans may be riskier due to the low income and wealth of the applicants, while the 
12:275:21532:27:28:72:515:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:very large loans may be riskier due to unusually high demand for credit (Stiglitz and Weiss, 
12:276:21625:28:34:72:106:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:1982). 
12:277:21632:34:30:72:213:150:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B. Bank Financial Variables 
12:278:21659:30:28:108:529:120:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:To understand how funding costs and liquidity affect the supply of mortgage credit, we 
12:279:21746:28:50:72:522:92:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f6:collect bank-level data by merging the HMDA loan application data to the Reports of Income 
13:280:21837:50:0:304:316:42:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:11
13:281:21839:0:27:72:537:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f3:and Condition for commercial banks (the ‘Call Report’).  We merge each application to the Call 
13:282:21934:27:28:72:522:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Report from the fourth quarter of the year of the mortgage application using the HMDA bank 
13:283:22025:28:27:72:525:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:identification number with call report identification number (RSSD ID) for banks reporting to 
13:284:22119:27:28:72:509:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Federal Reserve Bank, with FDIC certificate ID (item RSSD9050 in Call report) for banks 
13:285:22207:28:28:72:516:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:reporting to FDIC, and with OCC ID (item RSSD9055 in Call report) for banks reporting to 
13:286:22296:28:27:72:512:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:OCC.  The unmatched institutions from HMDA dataset are then matched manually using a 
13:287:22381:27:28:72:289:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:bank’s name and the zip code of its location. 
13:288:22427:28:27:108:507:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Using Call Report data, we focus our attention on the cost of deposits to the lender 
13:289:22512:27:28:72:542:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(measured by the ratio of total interest expenses on deposits to total deposits), and on the lender’s 
13:290:22614:28:28:72:512:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:balance sheet liquidity (the ratio of cash plus securities to total assets).  We also control for 
13:291:22712:28:27:72:511:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:lender size (log of total assets), leverage (the ratio of capital to assets) and profitability (net 
13:292:22812:27:28:72:526:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:income to total assets).  Last, we supplement the traditional measure of balance sheet liquidity 
13:293:22909:28:51:72:517:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:with an additional measure of loan liquidity, defined following Loutskina (2005) as follows:

13:319:23354:27:28:72:530:222:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:a weighted average of the potential to securitize loans of a given type (based on economy-wide 
13:320:23449:28:28:72:528:194:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:averages – the first term in parentheses), where the weights reflect each bank’s individual loan 
13:321:23546:28:27:72:523:166:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:portfolio (the second term in parentheses).  Thus, market trends generate time variation in the 
13:322:23642:27:28:71:518:139:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:index (recall Figure 2), whereas differences in bank loan portfolios generate variation across 
13:323:23737:28:64:71:534:111:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:institutions.  To construct this measure, we break the loan portfolio into six categories: (i) home 
14:324:23837:64:0:300:312:47:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:12
14:325:23839:0:27:72:521:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mortgages; (ii) multifamily residential mortgages, (iii) commercial mortgages, (iv) consumer 
14:326:23932:27:28:72:526:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:credit, (v) business loans not secured by real estate (commercial and industrial loans), and (vi) 
14:327:24030:28:27:72:154:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:farm mortgages. 
14:328:24046:27:28:108:523:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The raw HMDA data contain almost 250 million mortgage applications.  Of these, we 
14:329:24128:28:28:72:539:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:first drop those originated by savings institutions, mortgage bankers, credit unions and other non-
14:330:24227:28:27:72:535:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:bank lenders, leaving about 120 million mortgage applications to financial institutions reporting 
14:331:24325:27:28:72:540:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:to FDIC, FRB, and OCC (mostly commercial banks).  We then drop mortgages where borrowers 
14:332:24414:28:27:72:490:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:are subsidized by the Federal Housing Authority, the Veterans Administration or other 
14:333:24500:27:28:72:527:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:government programs, leaving us with about 106 million loan applications.  Of these, we keep 
14:334:24593:28:28:72:537:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:loans for home purchase only, which reduces the sample to around 35 million (more than half of 
14:335:24688:28:27:72:539:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the loan applications are for mortgage refinancing).  We drop cases where a loan application was 
14:336:24785:27:28:72:511:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:incomplete or withdrawn – that is, we only keep loan applications where we can determine 
14:337:24874:28:27:72:540:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:whether or not the lender approved or denied the application.  To be sure our sample is relatively 
14:338:24973:27:28:72:517:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:homogeneous (recall Figure 4 above), we keep only those loans between 50 percent and 250 
14:339:25062:28:27:72:483:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:percent of the jumbo-mortgage cutoff, which reduces the sample to about 8.6 million 
14:340:25146:27:28:72:515:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:applications.  We then take this sample of loans and merge the observation to the Bank Call 
14:341:25238:28:28:72:464:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Report.  This merge leaves us with a final sample of 6,143,057 loan applications. 
14:342:25320:28:27:108:512:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Since we are only using about three percent of all mortgage applications, one might 
14:343:25404:27:28:72:501:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:legitimately question the generality of the results.  To address this concern, we report the 
14:344:25497:28:27:72:542:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:frequency distribution and acceptance rates for mortgages between 50 percent and 250 percent of 
14:345:25593:27:28:72:540:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the jumbo-loan cutoff for both our sample, and for the full sample of applications in HMDA.  As 
14:346:25689:28:28:72:500:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:shown in Figure 5, both the frequency and acceptance rates look very similar for the two 
14:347:25778:28:59:72:500:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:samples, suggesting that our data filters have not created a biased or unusual selection of 
15:348:25870:59:0:304:316:42:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:13
15:349:25872:0:27:72:536:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mortgage applications.  For example, we see in both samples a similar large upward spike in the 
15:350:25968:27:28:72:534:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:number of applications and a jump in the acceptance rate just below the jumbo-loan cutoff.  We 
15:351:26063:28:27:72:496:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:also see the same fall off in the acceptance rate as the size of the mortgages falls, and as 
15:352:26156:27:28:72:280:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mortgage size increases beyond the cutoff. 
15:353:26199:28:28:108:536:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Table 2 contains simple summary statistics for the mortgage application data that we use 
15:354:26288:28:27:72:495:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in our regression sample, and for selected years between 1992 and 2003.  We report the 
15:355:26375:27:28:72:528:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:acceptance rate, loan size, applicant income, and the share of loans made in urban areas (i.e. in 
15:356:26473:28:27:72:538:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:MSAs).  Of the six million applications, about 91 percent are accepted.  The average loan size is 
15:357:26571:27:28:72:530:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:$209 thousand, and the mean ratio of loan size to applicant income is 2.4.  About 14 percent of 
15:358:26667:28:28:72:533:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the loan applicants are to minority borrowers, and about 15 percent are to female borrowers.  In 
15:359:26764:28:27:72:538:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:terms of neighborhood attributes, 92 percent of the loan applications are for properties located in 
15:360:26864:27:28:72:519:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:MSAs.  The median census tract income (averaged across tracts) is $51 thousand per year.14  
15:361:26956:28:27:72:515:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Table 2 also shows that most of these characteristics are quite stable over time, although the 
15:362:27051:27:28:72:459:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:jumbo-loan cutoff increases as housing prices have risen throughout the sample. 
15:363:27131:28:27:108:539:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Table 3 reports summary statistics for the potential-lender (bank) characteristics included 
15:364:27223:27:28:72:529:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in our sample (Panel A).  We also report these characteristics for those banks that are excluded 
15:365:27320:28:28:72:517:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:from our tests, either because they did not appear in the HMDA dataset, or because we were 
15:366:27411:28:27:72:514:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:unable to match their identifier to HMDA (Panel B).  The median bank in our sample holds 
15:367:27500:27:28:72:496:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:about $85 million in assets, and the median bank received 16 mortgage applications (15 
15:368:27587:28:27:72:521:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:accepted) in a typical year in the sample.  This number of applications may appear small, but 
15:369:27681:27:28:72:534:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:note that the median bank is small, and that we only consider loans near the jumbo-loan cutoff.  
15:370:27778:28:28:72:541:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:In fact, 88 percent of loan applications are smaller than 50 percent of the jumbo-loan cutoff.  The 
15:371:27878:28:54:72:524:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:median deposit cost, defined as interest expenses on deposits divided by total deposits, equals 
16:372:27974:54:0:300:312:47:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:14
16:373:27976:0:27:72:535:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:about 3.3 percent, and the median bank held about 28 percent of its assets in either cash or other 
16:374:28075:27:28:72:540:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:marketable securities.  Our measure of loan liquidity, which again takes account of both a bank’s 
16:375:28173:28:27:72:506:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:portfolio choices and the depth of the market for securitization in aggregate, was about 23 
16:376:28265:27:28:72:533:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:percent.  This variable trends upward throughout our sample period as the securitization market 
16:377:28361:28:28:72:528:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:has expanded.  In contrast, the banks excluded tend to be smaller, less focused on lending, and 
16:378:28457:28:27:72:538:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:less focused on mortgage lending in particular, although no less profitable.  This is reasonable to 
16:379:28557:27:46:71:531:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:expect since the HMDA data cover mortgage lenders with total assets in excess of $30 million.

16:381:28672:36:31:72:154:461:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:A. Identification 
16:382:28689:31:28:108:529:430:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The fundamental question that we ask here is:  how do funding conditions and liquidity 
16:383:28776:28:27:72:529:402:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:affect an individual bank’s willingness to supply credit?  Answering the question convincingly 
16:384:28871:27:28:72:518:375:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:creates the challenge of separating the effects of loan demand from those of loan supply.  To 
16:385:28965:28:27:72:509:347:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:understand this identification problem, consider the correlation between loan growth and a 
16:386:29056:27:28:72:510:320:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:bank’s cost of raising deposits.  If availability of local deposits affects loan supply, then an 
16:387:29153:28:27:72:541:292:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:increase in a bank’s cost of deposits ought to be associated with a decline in loan growth.  Strong 
16:388:29253:27:28:72:533:265:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:loan demand, however, will tend to increase a bank’s appetite for deposits to fund that demand, 
16:389:29349:28:28:72:517:237:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:thus potentially leading to higher yields on deposits (and thus a positive correlation between 
16:390:29444:28:27:72:508:209:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:deposit yields and loan growth).  Similarly, a bank’s willingness to hold liquid assets – for 
16:391:29538:27:28:72:536:182:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:example, cash or other marketable securities – may be directly affected by loan demand.  Where 
16:392:29633:28:27:72:539:154:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:loan demand is weak, we would expect banks to hold more securities.  Thus, demand-side forces 
16:393:29727:27:85:72:538:127:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:will tend to generate a negative correlation between measures of bank liquidity and loan growth. 
17:394:29824:85:0:304:316:42:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:15
17:395:29826:0:27:108:526:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Our research method is designed specifically to address these identification problems.  
17:396:29914:27:28:72:539:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The first advantage of our approach is that we focus on the acceptance rate for mortgages, rather 
17:397:30012:28:27:72:486:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:than originations.  Demand conditions will have first-order effects on the flow of loan 
17:398:30100:27:28:72:529:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:applications, but will not directly influence a bank’s decision to accept a loan.  Thus, we link a 
17:399:30199:28:28:72:519:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:bank’s funding cost (the yield on deposits) and balance-sheet liquidity (the ratio of cash plus 
17:400:30295:28:27:72:504:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:securities to assets) to its willingness to approve mortgages, conditional on all observable 
17:401:30388:27:28:72:190:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:dimensions of loan risk. 
17:402:30413:28:27:108:527:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Modeling the acceptance rate helps but does necessarily fully resolve the identification 
17:403:30502:27:28:72:520:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:problem.  Loan demand may have indirect effects on a bank’s acceptance rate by altering the 
17:404:30594:28:28:72:527:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:credit quality of the pool of applicants.  For example, when demand is very strong, the loan-to-
17:405:30690:28:27:72:513:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:value ratio for the typical mortgage application may be above average (due to high housing 
17:406:30781:27:28:72:532:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:prices relative to buyers’ access to equity).  Because we are not able to observe property values 
17:407:30879:28:27:72:520:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in our data set, this demand-driven change in the applicant pool could bias our results toward 
17:408:30974:27:28:72:518:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:finding a negative (positive) link from deposit yields (liquidity) to a bank’s acceptance rate.  
17:409:31071:28:27:72:495:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Rather than model the overall acceptance rate, we instead focus initially on whether the 
17:410:31160:27:28:72:525:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:acceptance rate of jumbo mortgages – mortgages that the bank must hold and therefore fund – 
17:411:31252:28:28:72:511:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:reflects funding conditions and liquidity relative to a bank’s acceptance rate for non-jumbo 
17:412:31345:28:27:72:542:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mortgages – those that the bank can readily sell into the secondary market.  So, in our benchmark 
17:413:31443:27:28:72:535:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:tests, we regress the differential acceptance rate, defined as a bank’s average acceptance rate for 
17:414:31543:28:27:72:499:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:non-jumbo mortgages minus its acceptance rate for jumbos, on the bank’s funding costs, 
17:415:31630:27:28:72:507:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:traditional bank balance-sheet liquidity, and bank loan liquidity measure.  We assume that 
17:416:31721:28:28:72:493:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:unobserved demand-side variables affect the acceptance rates of jumbo and non-jumbo 
17:417:31805:28:54:72:515:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mortgages at a given bank in the same way.  The identification strategy requires a relatively 
18:418:31899:54:0:300:312:47:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:16
18:419:31901:0:27:72:533:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:homogenous pool of loans around jumbo-loan cutoff, so we drop all loan applications below 50 
18:420:31994:27:34:72:415:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:percent of the jumbo-loan cutoff and above 250 percent of the cutoff.15

18:422:32078:30:28:108:493:617:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:To understand our estimation, consider two reduced form equations relating the 
18:423:32157:28:28:72:537:589:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:acceptance rates to market-level demand-side variables and to bank-level funding characteristics 
18:424:32254:28:45:72:243:561:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(supply-side variables), as follows: 
18:425:32291:45:28:81:501:516:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f3:ARNJi,t   = γNJ1Balance-sheet liquidityi,t-1 + γNJ2Deposit costi,t-1 + γNJ3Loan liquidityi,t-1 +

18:429:32641:46:27:71:527:363:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:where the unit of observation in these regressions is the bank-year.  Subscript i indicates bank, 
18:430:32739:27:28:71:537:336:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and subscript t indicates year.  For each bank-year, the dependent variable equals the acceptance 
18:431:32837:28:27:71:521:308:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:rate for non-jumbo mortgages (ARNJi,t  = the share of mortgage applications below the jumbo-

18:433:33024:28:27:71:530:253:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:defined similarly to ARNJi,t for jumbos).  Each equation contains demand-side variables that are 
18:434:33121:27:28:72:526:226:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:unobservable, as well as variables reflecting the funding and liquidity position of the potential 
18:435:33219:28:28:72:528:198:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:lender.  We expect that banks with more balance-sheet liquidity will be more willing to supply 
18:436:33314:28:27:72:498:170:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:illiquid jumbo mortgages than banks that are liquidity constrained.  In contrast, liquidity 
18:437:33406:27:28:71:536:143:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:constraints should not affect a bank’s willingness to supply non-jumbo mortgages because these 
18:438:33501:28:73:71:537:115:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:can be converted to mortgage-backed securities (which are liquid), or they can be sold off easily

19:440:33601:0:27:72:536:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(to one of the GSEs).  For funding costs, we expect banks with high deposit costs to reduce loan 
19:441:33698:27:28:72:524:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:supply more for illiquid jumbo mortgages than for liquid non-jumbos, again because the bank 
19:442:33790:28:27:72:530:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:must hold and thus fund the illiquid ones (Kashyap and Stein, 2000; Campello, 2002).  That is, 
19:443:33885:27:40:72:295:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:we expect the following relationships to hold: 
19:444:33932:40:40:108:337:586:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:0 <= γNJ1 <   γJ1  and    0 >= γNJ2 >   γJ2. 
19:445:33977:40:27:72:530:546:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:If demand-side effects are common across equations (1a) and (1b), then they can be eliminated 
19:446:34071:27:40:72:202:519:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:by subtraction, as follows: 
19:447:34099:40:27:90:517:479:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f3:ARNJi,t - ARJi,t  = β1Balance-sheet liquidityi,t-1 + β2Deposit costi,t-1 + β3Loan liquidityi,t-1 +  
19:448:34199:27:40:107:528:452:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:+ βNJBorrower RiskNJi,t - βJBorrower RiskJi,t + ηi,t,       (1c) 
19:449:34261:40:28:71:534:412:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:where β1 =  γNJ1 - γJ1, etc.  Thus, we can remove the potentially biasing demand-side effects, but 
19:450:34359:28:27:72:497:384:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:we are only able to identify the difference in the coefficients in equations (1a) and (1b).  
19:451:34452:27:28:72:323:357:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Equation (1c) represents our benchmark regression. 
19:452:34503:28:27:108:525:329:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Balance sheet liquidity and the cost of holding deposits, our main variables of interest, 
19:453:34593:27:28:72:508:302:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:are defined above.  We also include loan liquidity in the regressions, which may affect the 
19:454:34685:28:27:71:540:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:differential acceptance rate either positively or negatively.  On the one hand, loan liquidity per se 
19:455:34787:27:28:71:527:247:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ought to increase a bank’s willingness to make illiquid loans for the same reason that the more 
19:456:34883:28:28:71:525:219:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:standard measure of balance sheet liquidity does.  On the other hand, banks holding very high 
19:457:34977:28:27:71:524:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:levels of mortgages (and hence having a relatively liquid loan portfolio), may be motivated to 
19:458:35072:27:28:71:504:164:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:originate non-jumbo mortgages that can easily be removed from the balance sheet.16  The 
19:459:35160:28:27:72:541:136:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:increasing depth of the securitization market (illustrated in Figure 2), which tends to increase our 
19:460:35261:27:62:72:532:109:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:measure of loan liquidity over time, may also encourage banks to set a lower acceptance hurdle 
20:461:35356:62:0:300:312:47:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:18
20:462:35358:0:27:72:499:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:for non-jumbo relative to jumbo mortgages.  Thus, we include loan liquidity as a control 
20:463:35447:27:28:72:499:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:variable, although as it turns out the main results are not sensitive to the inclusion of this 
20:464:35542:28:27:72:117:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:variable. 
20:465:35552:27:28:108:502:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:To control for risk characteristics of the pool of loans used to build the dependent 
20:466:35637:28:28:72:511:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:variable, we include the following: the ratio of the loan size to applicant income; the log of 
20:467:35732:28:27:72:542:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:applicant income; the share of properties located in MSAs; the percent minority in the population 
20:468:35830:27:28:72:523:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:around the property; the median income in the area around the property; and shares of female 
20:469:35923:28:27:72:527:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and minority loan applicants.  We construct these characteristics by averaging across all of the 
20:470:36020:27:28:72:530:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:non-jumbo loans (Borrower RiskNJi,t) and across all of the jumbo loans (Borrower RiskJi,t).  We 
20:471:36116:28:28:71:522:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:allow the coefficients on these risk characteristics to differ by loan type.17  In addition to loan 
20:472:36216:28:27:72:539:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:pool characteristics, we include bank size (log of assets), a measure of leverage (the capital-asset 
20:473:36317:27:28:72:486:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ratio), and accounting profits (net income to assets).  Because there may be additional 
20:474:36405:28:27:72:513:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:unobserved bank effects, we cluster the error in the model by bank in constructing standard 
20:475:36497:27:28:72:114:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:errors.18 
20:476:36506:28:27:108:532:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Changes in the stance of monetary policy could in principle be included in our model to 
20:477:36594:27:28:72:526:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:test how aggregate funding shocks (e.g. an increase in the Fed Funds rate) affect the supply of 
20:478:36690:28:28:72:514:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:liquid v. illiquid loans.  Loutskina (2005) finds, for example, that banks with balance sheets 
20:479:36785:28:27:72:539:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:dominated by liquid mortgages tend to be less affected by changes in monetary policy than other 
20:480:36881:27:28:72:514:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:banks.  Unfortunately, the HMDA loan application data are not ‘time stamped’.  All we can 
20:481:36971:28:27:72:512:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:observe is the year in which a given application is made.  Since Federal Reserve policy can 
20:482:37063:27:28:72:511:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:change sharply over the course of a single year, we simply absorb year effects with a set of 
20:483:37156:28:28:71:488:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:indicator variables.  We also incorporate state indicator variables in all of our models.  
20:484:37247:28:59:71:502:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:According to Passmore, et al (2005), removing state effects is important, both because of 
21:485:37337:59:0:304:316:42:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:19
21:486:37339:0:27:72:527:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:differences in foreclosure laws across states, and because the jumbo-mortgage market is much 
21:487:37432:27:28:72:512:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:better developed in states with relatively high housing costs, compared to states with lower-
21:488:37525:28:45:72:144:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:priced houses.

21:490:37549:37:31:72:205:571:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:A. Benchmark Regressions 
21:491:37573:31:27:108:529:540:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Table 4 reports the benchmark results. We estimate the regression specification (1c) on 
21:492:37661:27:28:72:532:513:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the sample of bank-years in which the total number of applicants for each type (non-jumbo and 
21:493:37755:28:27:72:522:485:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:jumbo) is at least three to assure that we have a reasonable estimate of the acceptance rate for 
21:494:37852:27:28:72:525:458:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:each observation.  Balance sheet liquidity, loan liquidity, and the cost of holding deposits, our 
21:495:37950:28:28:72:518:430:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:main variables of interest, are defined above.  Each of these variables comes from the fourth-
21:496:38044:28:27:72:514:402:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:quarter Call Report for the year before the loan application.  We use prior-year bank data to 
21:497:38138:27:28:72:539:375:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:reduce any mechanical relationship between our dependent variable and the bank characteristics. 
21:498:38234:28:27:108:542:347:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The first three specifications of Table 4 focus on balance-sheet liquidity, deposit cost, and 
21:499:38328:27:28:72:507:320:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:loan liquidity individually (columns 1-3).  Then, we report one specification with all three 
21:500:38421:28:27:72:515:292:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:variables together (column 4).  Last, we report a full specification with all three variables of 
21:501:38518:27:28:72:513:265:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:interest plus the full set of control variables (column 5).  All five specifications suggest that 
21:502:38616:28:28:72:542:237:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:banks with more balance sheet liquidity and banks with lower cost of deposits supply more credit 
21:503:38713:28:27:72:531:209:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:to the illiquid sector (non-jumbos) relative to the liquid sector (jumbos).  The effects are robust 
21:504:38813:27:28:72:515:182:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:across specifications.  This robustness suggests that omitted risk factors, such as the loan-to-
21:505:38909:28:27:72:293:154:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:value ratio, are not biasing our key findings.   
21:506:38958:27:28:108:524:127:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The coefficients are not only statistically significant but also economically important.  
21:507:39048:28:52:72:541:99:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:For example, if we raise the balance sheet liquidity variable from the 25th to the 75th percentile of 
22:508:39150:52:0:300:312:47:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:20
22:509:39152:0:27:72:538:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:its distribution (an increase of 17.5 percent of assets), the difference between the acceptance rate 
22:510:39253:27:28:72:511:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of non-jumbo mortgages and jumbo mortgages falls by 0.4 percentage points.  This change 
22:511:39341:28:27:72:533:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:represents about 6 percent of the variation in the dependent variable (based on the inter-quartile 
22:512:39440:27:28:72:511:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:range of 6.9 percentage points).  For deposits, a move from the 25th to 75th percentile in the 
22:513:39535:28:28:71:541:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:distribution of yields (and increase of 1.1 percentage points) is associated with a relative increase 
22:514:39637:28:27:71:504:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in the acceptance rate for non-jumbo mortgages of about 0.5 percentage points.  So, if we 
22:515:39727:27:28:71:510:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:compare two banks, one with low liquidity and expensive deposits and the other flush with 
22:516:39817:28:27:71:515:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:liquidity and cheap deposits, the first bank’s acceptance rate for jumbo mortgages would be 
22:517:39909:27:28:71:315:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:about one percentage point lower than the second. 
22:518:39959:28:28:107:503:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The effect of bank size in Table 4 is also notable, and further confirms our overall 
22:519:40044:28:27:71:522:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:findings.  Log of bank assets enters the regression with a negative and statistically significant 
22:520:40142:27:28:71:529:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:coefficient.  An increase in assets from the 25th to the 75th percentile comes with an increase in 
22:521:40241:28:27:72:518:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the relative acceptance rate for jumbo mortgages of 0.6 percentage points, comparable to the 
22:522:40334:27:28:72:535:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:magnitude of the effects of both the cost of deposits and the balance-sheet liquidity ratio.  Thus, 
22:523:40434:28:27:72:515:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:larger banks are, all else equal, more likely than smaller banks to approve jumbo mortgages 
22:524:40526:27:28:72:510:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:relative to non-jumbo mortgages.  Because there are many differences in the operating and 
22:525:40616:28:28:72:540:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:financial policies of large and small banks, we include size mainly as a control variable.  But this 
22:526:40717:28:27:72:519:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:result may reflect in part large banks’ better access to alternative sources of funds, as well as 
22:527:40815:27:28:72:531:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:their greater ability to manage liquidity risk.  For example, large banks have a greater ability to 
22:528:40915:28:27:72:537:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:borrow in the Fed Funds market than smaller banks.19  Similarly, with better ability to borrow in 
22:529:41013:27:28:72:521:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:capital markets, large banks are also less reliant on deposits as a marginal source of funds for 
22:530:41110:28:87:71:138:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:their lending.

23:532:41127:0:30:72:258:708:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:B. Endogenous Loan-Application Size 
23:533:41162:30:28:108:543:678:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:As we noted above, loan-application size itself may be determined (or affected) by banks’ 
23:534:41252:28:27:72:497:650:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:ability to securitize or sell off mortgages near the jumbo-loan cutoff.  This notion seems 
23:535:41343:27:28:72:530:623:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:consistent with the flow of applications that spikes upward for loans just below the cutoff.  We 
23:536:41440:28:28:72:527:595:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:do not observe exactly how a bank might influence its applicants, although it seems likely that 
23:537:41536:28:27:72:539:567:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:influence could be accomplished with carrots (‘lower interest rates below the cutoff...’) or sticks 
23:538:41636:27:28:72:397:540:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(‘the loan will only be accepted if it comes in below the cutoff...’). 
23:539:41707:28:27:108:523:512:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:To test whether the pool of loans around the jumbo-loan cutoff is endogenous to bank 
23:540:41792:27:28:72:535:485:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:financial condition, we construct the share of non-jumbo loans (95 percent to 100 percent of the 
23:541:41889:28:28:72:539:457:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:cutoff) in all applications near the cutoff (95 percent to 105 percent of the cutoff), irrespective of 
23:542:41992:28:27:72:537:429:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:whether or not the loan is accepted.  We then relate this measure to bank financial conditions, as 
23:543:42091:27:40:72:114:402:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:follows:

23:548:42394:28:28:72:520:240:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:marginal applicants to apply for a mortgage just below the cutoff, as a function of the bank’s 
23:549:42489:28:27:71:503:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:funding and liquidity.  If more constrained banks create more high-powered incentive for 
23:550:42578:27:28:71:538:185:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:applicants to reduce their demand (e.g. with a larger jumbo/non-jumbo pricing differential), then 
23:551:42676:28:27:71:528:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:we would expect constrained banks to receive a larger share of non-jumbo applications.  Thus, 
23:552:42770:27:28:71:504:130:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:we expect β1 < 0 and β2 > 0.  We use the same set of bank and loan-pool control variables 
23:553:42860:28:55:72:522:102:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:included in our model of the differential probability.  As before, the unit of observation is the 
24:554:42958:55:0:300:312:47:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:22
24:555:42960:0:27:72:533:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:bank-year, but we now include all banks with at least one loan applications of each type around 
24:556:43056:27:28:72:500:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the jumbo-loan cutoff (i.e. within 5 percent).  And, we continue to include state and year 
24:557:43147:28:27:72:485:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:indicators, and to cluster the residual at the bank level in constructing standard errors. 
24:558:43238:27:28:108:527:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Table 5 reports the results, with the same set of five specifications reported earlier.  As 
24:559:43330:28:28:71:515:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:before, balance sheet liquidity and funding costs are significantly related to the flow of loan 
24:560:43426:28:27:72:533:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:applications.  The applicant flow is skewed toward the relatively liquid mortgages (those below 
24:561:43522:27:28:72:513:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the cutoff) for banks with lower levels of balance sheet liquidity or higher cost of deposits.  
24:562:43618:28:27:72:535:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Banks that have less liquidity or higher deposit costs seem more likely to push applicants below 
24:563:43715:27:28:71:534:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the jumbo-loan cutoff.  This is consistent with the notion that more liquid banks and banks with 
24:564:43812:28:28:71:523:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:cheaper deposits are better financially positioned to originate illiquid loans and hence are less 
24:565:43910:28:27:71:535:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:likely to affect the flow of mortgage applications.  These effects across specifications are robust 
24:566:44010:27:28:71:536:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:in the statistical sense, although the coefficient on deposit cost declines when we add the full set 
24:567:44111:28:27:71:535:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of control variables (column 5).  In terms of the coefficient magnitudes, the effect of liquidity is 
24:568:44212:27:28:71:538:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:notable.  A move from the 25th to the 75th percentile in the liquid-assets distribution is associated 
24:569:44314:28:27:71:537:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:with an increase of 1.8 percentage points in the share of jumbo loans.  This increase represents a 
24:570:44413:27:28:71:516:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:10 percent rise relative to the mean share of jumbo-loan applications (only 18 percent of the 
24:571:44507:28:28:71:360:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mortgages near the jumbo-loan cutoff fall above that level). 
24:572:44568:28:27:107:539:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:In addition, we find that both bank size and the capital-asset ratio strongly affect the flow 
24:573:44662:27:28:71:536:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of applications.  Larger banks receive a larger share of non-jumbo loans.  And, in contrast to the 
24:574:44761:28:27:71:523:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:relative acceptance rates, where bank capital was not significant, the share of non-jumbo loan 
24:575:44856:27:28:71:496:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:applications declines with bank capital.  Well-capitalized banks seem less likely to push 
24:576:44946:28:28:71:535:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:borrowers below the jumbo-loan threshold, perhaps indicating their willingness to originate and 
24:577:45042:28:59:71:193:101:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:hold (jumbo) mortgages.

25:580:45118:30:28:108:520:678:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The strong link between the applicant flows around the jumbo-loan cutoff and bank’s 
25:581:45202:28:27:72:500:650:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:funding and liquidity suggests that the effects of financial conditions on acceptance rates 
25:582:45294:27:28:72:528:623:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:estimated in Table 4 may be understated.  As shown earlier in Figure 4, the overall differential 
25:583:45391:28:28:72:537:595:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:acceptance rate is biased upward (the acceptance rate spikes up just below the cutoff).  The high 
25:584:45489:28:27:71:531:567:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:acceptance rate just below the cutoff probably reflects high-wealth applicants’ ability to reduce 
25:585:45587:27:28:71:510:540:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:their borrowing relative to applicants with less wealth.  The better the quality of applicants 
25:586:45682:28:27:71:540:512:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:shifting below the cutoff, the larger is the bias.  The financially unconstrained banks are likely to 
25:587:45784:27:28:71:538:485:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:provide the weakest pricing incentive for applicants to borrow below the cutoff, leading only the 
25:588:45882:28:28:71:502:457:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:highest wealth applicants to shift.  In contrast, the constrained banks are likely to provide 
25:589:45976:28:27:71:524:429:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:stronger incentives, leading lower quality applicants to shift as well.  Thus, the bias should be 
25:590:46074:27:28:71:259:402:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:largest for the unconstrained banks.20   
25:591:46115:28:27:108:531:374:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:To test this notion, we re-estimate the differential acceptance rate regressions, dropping 
25:592:46206:27:28:72:502:347:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:loan applications within 5 percent of the jumbo-loan cutoff.  These results are reported in 
25:593:46298:28:27:72:518:319:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Table 6.  As expected, the coefficients on the financial variables are larger in magnitude and 
25:594:46393:27:34:72:442:292:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:have higher levels of statistical significance than those reported in Table 4.21 
25:595:46473:34:31:72:261:258:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:D.  Sorting of Borrowers across Banks 
25:596:46510:31:27:108:517:227:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Beyond the endogeneity of applicant size, the whole distribution of loan applications 
25:597:46596:27:28:72:529:200:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:across banks may shift in response to the relative pricing of non-jumbos.  Funding-constrained 
25:598:46691:28:27:71:538:172:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:banks presumably price jumbos at higher relative rates than unconstrained banks (remember that 
25:599:46786:27:28:71:503:145:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:we are unable to observe loan prices).  Sorting of borrowers across banks is facilitated by 
25:600:46878:28:28:71:507:117:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mortgage brokers and internet companies that lower the cost of search relative to potential 
25:601:46970:28:42:71:510:89:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:savings from small changes in prices.  To the extent that most jumbo-loan borrowers avoid 
26:602:47060:42:0:300:312:47:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:24
26:603:47062:0:27:72:488:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:applying to funding constrained banks at all, it will be harder to observe differences in 
26:604:47152:27:28:72:517:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:acceptance rates because the most constrained banks may price themselves out of the jumbo 
26:605:47242:28:27:72:503:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:market entirely.  Or, said slightly differently, the most constrained banks with the highest 
26:606:47335:27:28:72:498:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:rejection rates for jumbo loans will not be observed in our data (because they receive no 
26:607:47425:28:28:72:140:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:applications). 
26:608:47440:28:27:108:501:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:To test for sorting effects, we regress the overall share of non-jumbo applications 
26:609:47524:27:28:72:515:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:(between 50 and 250 percent of the cutoff) on the same set of financing variables, loan-pool 
26:610:47617:28:27:72:531:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:characteristics and bank characteristics (Table 7).  Since we are interested in borrower’s choice 
26:611:47715:27:28:72:519:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:of bank, we drop the marginal loan applications (those within five percent of the jumbo-loan 
26:612:47808:28:28:71:533:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:cutoff), where the size of loan itself may be endogenous.  In these specifications, we include all 
26:613:47907:28:27:71:528:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:banks that receive at least 3 applications in the 50 to 250 percent interval.  We find, again, that 
26:614:48007:27:28:71:518:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:financially constrained banks receive a significantly lower share of jumbo-loan applications, 
26:615:48101:28:27:71:528:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:although the coefficients are smaller in magnitude than those that we estimate for the marginal 
26:616:48197:27:28:71:518:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:loan applicants (i.e. those near the cutoff).  A move from the 25th to the 75th percentile in the 
26:617:48295:28:27:72:519:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:liquid-assets distribution, for example, is associated with an increase of about 1.2 percentage 
26:618:48391:27:28:72:530:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:points in the share of jumbo loans.  So, the pool of applications shifts toward more liquid loans 
26:619:48489:28:34:72:372:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:as the originating banks become more financially constrained. 
26:620:48551:34:30:72:428:233:144:g_d0_f6:144:g_d0_f6:E. Separating the Financial Effects on Non-jumbo and Jumbo Mortgages 
26:621:48619:30:28:108:537:203:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The results so far are limited in that we have estimated how a bank’s liquidity or funding 
26:622:48710:28:27:72:514:175:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:costs affect its supply of jumbo mortgages relative to non-jumbo mortgages.  As noted, this 
26:623:48802:27:28:72:523:148:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:approach is conservative because it allows us to difference out demand-side forces that might 
26:624:48896:28:28:72:536:120:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:bias the relationship between bank characteristics and loan supply.  However, the cost is that we 
26:625:48994:28:50:72:539:92:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:are not able to identify the direct effects of the financial variables on mortgage acceptance rates.  
27:626:49096:50:0:304:316:42:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:25
27:627:49098:0:27:72:534:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:To estimate a model that separates the effects of funding and liquidity on non-jumbo mortgages 
27:628:49193:27:28:72:537:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:from its effect on jumbos, we separate the acceptance rate for jumbos and non-jumbo mortgages 
27:629:49287:28:27:72:519:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:and relate each to the balance sheet liquidity, loan liquidity and the cost of holding deposits.  
27:630:49385:27:28:108:522:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:This approach essentially boils down to estimating equations (1a) and (1b) above as a 
27:631:49471:28:28:72:491:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:system of seemingly unrelated regressions (Zellner, 1962).  Thus, we now analyze two 
27:632:49556:28:27:72:535:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:acceptance rates for each bank-year: one for the non-jumbo mortgages, and one for the jumbos.  
27:633:49651:27:28:72:485:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:We include a jumbo-loan indicator and its interaction with bank funding and liquidity 
27:634:49737:28:27:72:482:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:characteristics (as well as every other variable), allowing us to disentangle how bank 
27:635:49824:27:28:72:526:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:characteristics affect the acceptance rates for both types of loans.  In this expanded model, the 
27:636:49922:28:28:72:521:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:unobservable demand-side variables are no longer differenced out, but will only (potentially) 
27:637:50016:28:27:72:516:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:bias the direct effects of liquidity and funding costs on the acceptance rate.  The approach is 
27:638:50112:27:28:72:507:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:more comprehensive because it allows us to consider significantly more bank-years in our 
27:639:50201:28:27:72:489:377:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:analysis since we do not impose a condition that a bank should have at least three loan 
27:640:50289:27:28:72:358:350:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:applications in both confirming and jumbo-loan categories. 
27:641:50348:28:27:107:542:322:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Table 8 reports these results.  As before, we estimate simple specifications that focus only 
27:642:50441:27:28:71:533:295:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:on the variables of greatest interest, and then we report multi-variate specifications with the full 
27:643:50542:28:28:72:516:267:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:set of control variables.  In Panel A, we report the results for the full sample of loans, and in 
27:644:50640:28:27:72:538:239:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Panel B we again drop applications in which loan-application size is potentially endogenous (i.e. 
27:645:50738:27:28:72:504:212:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:observations that are within 5 percent of the jumbo-loan cutoff).  The interaction terms of 
27:646:50830:28:27:72:491:184:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:balance sheet liquidity and cost of deposits with the jumbo-loan dummy have the same 
27:647:50915:27:28:72:515:157:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:interpretation as the coefficients in Table 4 and Table 6.  Even though we have dramatically 
27:648:51008:28:82:72:528:129:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:increased the sample, the magnitudes of these coefficients are similar to those reported earlier. 
28:649:51106:82:0:300:312:47:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:26
28:650:51108:0:27:108:501:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:The coefficients suggest that neither balance sheet liquidity nor deposit yields are 
28:651:51193:27:28:72:524:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:correlated with the acceptance rate for non-jumbo mortgages.  Since banks don’t need to hold 
28:652:51286:28:27:72:506:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:these loans on their balance sheet, the acceptance rate is not affected by the bank’s cost of 
28:653:51380:27:28:72:532:626:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:deposits or liquidity.  If a bank chooses to hold a non-jumbo mortgage, then its overall liquidity 
28:654:51479:28:28:71:538:598:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:does not affect this decision because it could, at relatively low cost, remove the loan by selling it 
28:655:51581:28:27:71:538:570:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:into the secondary market.  In contrast, the loan liquidity measure, which again is driven in large 
28:656:51681:27:28:71:490:543:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:part by the depth of the securitization market as a whole, is very strongly related to the 
28:657:51772:28:27:71:526:515:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:acceptance rate for both kinds of mortgages.  Moreover, its effect is greater for the non-jumbo 
28:658:51868:27:28:71:536:488:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:loans.  This result seems sensible because it reflects the increasing relative advantage of holding 
28:659:51968:28:28:71:517:460:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:the non-jumbo loans as the depth of this market has increased over time.  Finally, the results 
28:660:52063:28:27:71:522:432:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:once again confirm that higher liquidity and lower costs of deposits positively affect a bank’s 
28:661:52159:27:46:71:245:405:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:willingness to supply illiquid loans. 
28:662:52197:46:30:71:164:359:144:Times:144:Times:VI. CONCLUSIONS 
28:663:52211:30:28:108:524:329:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:Traditional banks originated illiquid loans and funded them with liquid deposits.  As a 
28:664:52299:28:27:72:534:301:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:result, a decline in deposit supply (such as one following a monetary policy tightening) reduced 
28:665:52396:27:28:72:521:274:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:loan supply.  Banks also needed to hold enough cash to satisfy random demands for liquidity 
28:666:52488:28:28:72:519:246:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:from depositors.  Securitization is changing the model of banking from one of ‘originate and 
28:667:52581:28:27:72:517:218:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:hold’ to one of ‘originate and sell’, thereby mitigating the effects of both deposit supply and 
28:668:52677:27:28:72:507:191:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:balance sheet liquidity on loan supply.  As evidence, we show that a bank’s willingness to 
28:669:52768:28:27:72:539:163:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:approve jumbo mortgages (an example of illiquid loans) depends on both its cost of deposits and 
28:670:52864:27:28:72:539:136:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:its holdings of liquid assets.  In contrast, financial condition has no effect on acceptance rates for 
28:671:52967:28:66:72:540:108:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:non-jumbo loans.  Given the rapid expansion of loan securitization (as well as the growth of loan 
29:672:53065:66:0:304:316:42:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:27
29:673:53067:0:27:72:538:708:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:sales and syndication), the results suggest that access to capital is less subject to variations in the 
29:674:53171:27:28:72:518:681:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:supply of local deposits to banks than in the past.  The expansion of the secondary market in 
29:675:53265:28:27:72:535:653:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:mortgages has also likely dampened the effects of monetary policy on real economic activity by

47:1183:73854:20:16:72:523:675:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:1 In recent years, the GSEs have opted to hold rather than securitize many of the mortgages that they buy to take 
47:1184:73968:16:11:72:528:659:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:advantage of subsidized borrowing rates.  Policymakers have become concerned about the resulting expansion of 
47:1185:74078:11:12:72:533:648:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:interest rate risk at the GSEs (Greenspan, 2004).  As of 2003, for example, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac held over 
47:1186:74191:12:11:72:530:636:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:$1.5 trillion in mortgages (Frame and White, 2005).  Passmore, Sherlund and Burgess (2005) argue that most (but 
47:1187:74303:11:12:72:528:625:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:not all) of the benefits of GSE subsidized borrowing benefits their shareholders rather than mortgage borrowers.   
47:1188:74418:12:11:72:530:613:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:Vickery (2005) shows that  GSE subsidies are concentrated in the fixed-rate mortgage (FRM) segment rather than 
47:1189:74529:11:12:72:527:602:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:the adjustable-rate mortgage segment, explaining why FRMs dominate in the U.S. relative to the U.K.  While the 
47:1190:74640:12:19:72:451:590:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:effects of this government subsidy are important for public policy, they are not the focus here. 
47:1191:74737:19:16:72:508:571:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:2 Benmelech, Germaise and Moskowitz (2005) use a similar identification strategy to analyze how real-asset 
47:1192:74844:16:11:72:539:555:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:liquidity (as opposed to financial-asset liquidity here) affects debt capacity.  In their case, they exploit differences in 
47:1193:74968:11:19:72:418:544:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:the liquidity of commercial properties stemming from variation in zoning restrictions. 
47:1194:75055:19:16:72:531:525:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:3 We are only able to identify which mortgages are jumbo in our data, and hence can not be sold to the GSEs.  For 
47:1195:75169:16:12:71:539:509:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:loans below the jumbo-loan cutoff, most can be sold to the GSEs (i.e. most are ‘conforming’ mortgages).  However, 
47:1196:75283:12:11:71:531:497:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:some non-jumbo loans do not meet the other criteria used to determine whether a mortgage is conforming, such as 
47:1197:75395:11:12:71:505:486:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:the loan-to-value ratio.  Thus, there is some measurement error in our classification of loans as conforming. 
47:1198:75505:12:7:71:74:474:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3: 
47:1199:75505:7:16:72:513:467:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:4  Holmstrom and Tirole (1997) present a theoretical analysis showing how real shocks can be exacerbated by 
47:1200:75613:16:11:72:528:451:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:reductions in credit supply.  Bernanke (1983) first showed that shocks to finance can have empirically significant 
47:1201:75728:11:12:72:532:440:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:effects on the magnitude of business downturns, focusing on the U.S. Great Depression.  More recent research has 
47:1202:75841:12:11:72:535:428:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:focused on regional downturns, and most studies find that such shocks are amplified by their effects on local banks 
47:1203:75957:11:19:72:342:417:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:(e.g. Bernanke and Lown (1991), Ashcraft (2005), Becker (2005)). 
47:1204:76022:19:16:72:535:398:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:5  Kashyap and Stein (2000) show that banks flush with balance-sheet liquidity respond less to monetary tightening 
47:1205:76137:16:12:71:519:382:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:because such banks can continue originating loans in the face of increased funding costs by running down their 
47:1206:76248:12:11:71:521:370:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:stock of liquid assets.  Their findings complement ours, because we find that the supply of liquid loans does not 
47:1207:76362:11:19:71:201:359:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:respond to banks’ cost of funds. 
47:1208:76395:19:16:72:479:340:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:6 For evidence that bank size and scope reduces the potency of monetary policy, see Ashcraft (2003), 
47:1209:76496:16:19:71:467:324:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:Campello (2002), Jayaratne and Morgan (2000), Kashyap and Stein (2000), and Loutskina (2005). 
47:1210:76590:19:16:72:532:305:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:7 Petersen and Rajan (1994) show that small firms benefit by concentrating their business with a single lender, and 
47:1211:76706:16:12:71:517:289:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:their results suggest that such borrowers face high costs of switching banks.  Thus, many small firms are ‘bank 
47:1212:76818:12:11:71:519:277:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:dependent’.  The geographical scope of loan markets, particularly for bank dependent firms, tends to be limited 
47:1213:76930:11:12:71:539:266:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:geographically because local lenders have better information than competing lenders.  Technology has increased the 
47:1214:77045:12:11:71:522:254:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:average distance between small-business borrowers and lenders, but physical proximity continues to affect bank 
47:1215:77156:11:12:71:529:243:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:lending supply and pricing (Petersen and Rajan, 2002; Degryse and Ongena, 2005).  Our results suggest that bank 
47:1216:77268:12:19:71:535:231:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:dependent firms’ cost of capital depends on the financial condition (cost of deposits and liquidity) of local lenders.  
47:1217:77388:19:16:72:528:212:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:8 Bernanke (1983) focused on credit effects of bank failures during the Depression.  More recently, Bernanke and 
47:1218:77501:16:11:71:516:196:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:Lown (1991) show that credit in regions with many poorly capitalized banks suffered most during the 1991-92 
47:1219:77609:11:12:71:531:185:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:recession.   Peek and Rosengren (2000) show that distressed Japanese banks reduced credit supply to borrowers in 
47:1220:77722:12:11:71:532:173:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:California (relative to California banks).  Ashcraft (2005) shows that local output falls when the FDIC closes even 
47:1221:77838:11:12:71:521:162:100:g_d0_f6:100:g_d0_f3:healthy banks.  Slovin, Sushka and Polonchek (1993) provide evidence that borrowers from Continental Illinois 
47:1222:77948:12:11:71:541:150:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:were potentially harmed by that bank’s failure.  Hubbard, Kuttner and Palia (2002) show that low capital banks price 
47:1223:78065:11:12:71:502:139:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:business loans at higher yields than better-capitalized banks.  Like our paper, Mian and Khwaja (2005) and 
47:1224:78172:12:11:71:501:127:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:Paravisini (2004) focus on how liquidity shifts loan supply.  Mian and Khwaja exploit bank runs following 
47:1225:78278:11:12:71:541:116:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:Pakistan’s unexpected nuclear test in 1998; they show that firms borrowed less from banks experiencing greater runs 
47:1226:78394:12:11:71:515:104:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:and more from banks experiencing smaller runs.  Paravisini finds that profitable lending expands following an 
47:1227:78504:11:0:71:323:93:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:infusion of liquidity by the Argentine government into banks.

48:1229:78723:7:23:72:441:701:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:9 Gorton and Souleles (2005) argue that this process reduces financial distress costs of debt. 
48:1230:78818:23:16:72:537:678:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:10 We have also disaggregated our liquidity measure by separating out mortgage-backed securities from other liquid 
48:1231:78933:16:12:72:519:662:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:assets.  In these robustness tests, there is no additional effect of mortgage-backed securities, suggesting that our 
48:1232:79050:12:11:72:504:650:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:coefficient represent shifts in bank behavior in response to variation in liquidity.  We thank Scott Frame for 
48:1233:79161:11:12:72:175:639:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:suggesting this test to us.

48:1237:79222:7:16:72:526:597:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:12  The extent to which the yield differentials reflects liquidity, rather than differences in credit risk, between non-
48:1238:79342:16:11:72:519:581:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:jumbo mortgages and jumbos remains somewhat controversial.  A recent study by Ambrose, LaCour-Little and 
48:1239:79447:11:12:72:537:570:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:Sanders (2004) controls carefully for credit risk and concludes that the yield differential is only about 5 basis points 
48:1240:79568:12:11:72:529:558:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:between non-jumbo and jumbo mortgages.  Nevertheless, there seems to be little doubt that there is an increase in 
48:1241:79682:11:12:72:396:547:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:yields for jumbos, and that some of that increase reflects differences in liquidity. 
48:1242:79767:12:7:72:75:535:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3: 
48:1243:79767:7:16:72:495:528:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:13 Here we consider only single-family home purchase mortgage applications across the lending financial 
48:1244:79871:16:19:72:203:512:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:institutions in the United States. 
48:1245:79906:19:16:72:528:493:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:14 Note that the difference between average census tract income ($51 thousand) and the average applicant income 
48:1246:80018:16:11:71:512:477:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:($208 thousand) in our sample is due to the fact that we only consider mortgages between 50 percent and 250 
48:1247:80126:11:19:71:206:466:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:percent of the jumbo-loan cutoff. 
48:1248:80160:19:16:72:510:447:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:15 Our results are not sensitive to this assumption.  For example, we have also estimated our models for loans 
48:1249:80271:16:12:72:521:431:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:between 75 percent and 150 percent of the jumbo-loan threshold and find similar results to those reported here.  
48:1250:80384:12:19:72:295:419:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:These results are available on request from the authors. 
48:1251:80441:19:23:72:514:400:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:16 We are not able to observe the fraction of on-balance sheet mortgages that are below the jumbo-loan cutoff. 
48:1252:80552:23:16:72:535:377:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:17  We have also estimated a more parsimonious approach, in which we control for average bank-specific loan pool 
48:1253:80665:16:19:72:382:361:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:characteristics, and obtain results that are very similar to those reported here. 
48:1254:80747:19:16:72:507:342:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:18 We have also estimated standard errors clustered by state and clustered by year.  We find similar levels of 
48:1255:80858:16:12:72:411:326:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:statistical significance in each of these alternative approaches to those reported here.

48:1257:80947:7:16:72:515:307:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:19 Large banks typically borrow in this market, whereas smaller banks typically supply funds to the Fed Funds 
48:1258:81057:16:19:72:105:291:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:market. 
48:1259:81065:19:16:72:517:272:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:20 Note that some borrowers may split their borrowing into a non-jumbo loan plus a small subordinated second 
48:1260:81174:16:11:71:535:256:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:mortgage to take advantage of the jumbo/non-jumbo pricing differential.  Wealthier applicants will be more able to 
48:1261:81289:11:12:71:165:245:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:exploit this possibility.

48:1263:81315:7:16:72:539:226:42:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:21 The statistical significance of these results increases when we estimate the model on the logistic transformation of 
48:1264:81435:16:0:72:159:210:100:g_d0_f3:100:g_d0_f3:the non-jumbo share.
