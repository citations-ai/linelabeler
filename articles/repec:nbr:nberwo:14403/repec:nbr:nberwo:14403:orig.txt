2:28:1342:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:This paper characterizes the welfare gains from redistributive taxation and social insurance in an environment
2:29:1452:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:where the private sector provides partial insurance.  We analyze stylized models in which adverse
2:30:1549:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:selection, pre-existing information, or imperfect optimization in private insurance markets create a
2:31:1649:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:role for government intervention. We derive simple formulas that map reduced-form empirical estimates
2:32:1750:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:into quantitative predictions for optimal tax and social insurance policy. Applications to unemployment
2:33:1853:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:and health insurance show that taking private market insurance into account matters significantly for
2:34:1954:14:42:72:452:504:12:Times:12:Times:optimal benefit levels given existing empirical estimates of the key parameters.

3:49:2310:0:31:74:187:700:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:1  Introduction
3:50:2325:31:20:74:519:669:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:A recent literature in public economics has begun to integrate the theory of optimal taxation
3:51:2418:20:21:74:519:649:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and social insurance with empirical evidence on behavioral responses to these policies. Several
3:52:2513:21:20:74:519:628:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:studies have proposed ìsu¢ cient statisticîformulas to map elasticities estimated in the mod-
3:53:2606:20:20:74:519:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ern program evaluation literature into predictions about the welfare consequences of policies
3:54:2699:20:21:74:519:588:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(e.g., Diamond 1998, Saez 2001, Shimer and Werning 2008, Chetty 2008a-b). One important
3:55:2786:21:20:74:519:567:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:limitation of existing su¢ cient statistic formulas is that they do not allow for private market
3:56:2882:20:20:74:519:547:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:insurance, implicitly assuming that the government is the sole provider of insurance. Previous
3:57:2976:20:21:74:519:527:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:theoretical and empirical studies have emphasized that the existence of private insurance can
3:58:3069:21:20:74:519:506:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:lower the optimal level of social insurance.1However, there is no method of mapping empir-
3:59:3159:20:20:74:519:486:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ical evidence such as that of Cutler and Gruber (1996a) into quantitative statements about
3:60:3249:20:21:74:519:466:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the optimal level of government intervention in models such as that analyzed by Golosov and
3:61:3340:21:20:74:157:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Tsyvinski (2007).
3:62:3357:20:20:91:519:425:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The paper takes a step toward bridging this gap. We develop formulas for optimal taxation
3:63:3446:20:21:74:519:405:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and social insurance in stylized models that allow for partial private insurance. The formulas
3:64:3540:21:20:74:519:384:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are functions of reduced-form parameters that are frequently estimated in empirical studies,
3:65:3632:20:20:74:519:364:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and can therefore be easily adapted to analyze policies ranging from optimal tax and transfer
3:66:3725:20:21:74:296:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:policy to unemployment and health insurance.
3:67:3769:21:20:91:519:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The starting point for our analysis is the speciÖcation of the limits of private market insur-
3:68:3863:20:20:74:519:303:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ance and the potential role for government intervention.  There are at least Öve reasons that
3:69:3956:20:21:74:519:283:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:government intervention could improve upon private insurance markets. First, private markets
3:70:4048:21:20:74:520:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:can only insure against shocks that occurafteragents purchase private insurance. Only the
3:71:4137:20:20:74:519:242:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:government can provide redistribution across types revealed before private insurance contracts
3:72:4231:20:21:74:519:222:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are signed. Second, informational asymmetries can lead to market unravelling through adverse
3:73:4323:21:20:74:519:201:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:selection (Akerlof 1970). Third, even when private markets function perfectly, individuals may
3:74:4417:20:20:74:519:181:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:su§er from behavioral biases such as myopia or overconÖdence that lead them to underinsure
3:75:4507:20:21:74:519:161:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:relative to the optimum (Kaplow 1991, DellaVigna 2008, Spinnewijn 2008).  Fourth, private
3:76:4596:21:20:74:519:140:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Örms generally cannot sign exclusive contracts, leading to ine¢ cient outcomes because of mul-
3:77:4690:20:16:74:519:120:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tiple dealing (Pauly 1974).  Finally, some studies have argued that the administrative and
3:78:4780:16:15:87:519:104:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:1For example, Golosov and Tsyvinski (2007) make this point theoretically.  Cutler and Gruber (1996a-b)
3:79:4882:15:0:74:400:89:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:present evidence that crowdout of private insurance is substantial in health care.
4:80:4965:0:20:74:519:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:marketing costs of private insurance exceed those of public insurance (Woolhandler, Campbell,
4:81:5058:20:21:74:519:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and Himmelstein 2003; Reinhardt, Hussey, and Anderson 2004) because of increasing returns
4:82:5147:21:20:74:245:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and zero-sum strategic competition.
4:83:5182:20:20:91:519:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In this paper, we characterize the welfare gains from government intervention under the
4:84:5269:20:21:74:519:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Örst three private market limitations.2We analyze models in which the agentís earnings vary
4:85:5360:21:20:74:519:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:across states.  This variation can be interpreted as uncertainty due to shocks, as in a social
4:86:5454:20:20:74:519:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:insurance problem, or as variation in earnings ability behind the veil of ignorance, as in an
4:87:5547:20:21:74:519:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:optimal taxation problem.  The model permits suboptimal choice of private insurance as well
4:88:5638:21:20:74:519:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as market limitations due to pre-existing information or adverse selection. We derive a formula
4:89:5733:20:20:74:519:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for the welfare gain from increasing the government tax rate (or social insurance beneÖt) that
4:90:5827:20:21:74:519:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:depends on Öve parameters: (1) the variation in consumption across states and risk types,
4:91:5916:21:20:74:519:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(2) the curvature of the utility function, (3) the elasticity of e§ort with respect to the tax
4:92:6010:20:20:74:519:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:or beneÖt rate, (4) the size of the private insurance market, and (5) the crowdout of private
4:93:6103:20:21:74:519:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:insurance by public insurance.  The Örst three parameters are standard elements of su¢ cient
4:94:6195:21:20:74:519:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:statistic formulas for optimal taxation and social insurance without private insurance; the last
4:95:6291:20:20:74:519:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:two are the new elements. In addition to o§ering a method of making quantitative predictions
4:96:6383:20:20:74:382:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:about welfare gains, our analysis yields three qualitative lessons.
4:97:6450:20:21:91:519:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:First, and most importantly, standard optimal tax and social insurance formulas overstate
4:98:6539:21:20:74:519:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the optimal degree of redistribution in the presence of private insurance that generates moral
4:99:6633:20:20:74:519:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:hazard.  A planner may observe substantial income inequality and conclude based on classic
4:100:6723:20:21:74:519:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:optimal tax results that redistributive taxation would improve welfare.  However, if the ob-
4:101:6815:21:20:74:519:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:served earnings distribution already reáects implicit insurance provided by the private sector
4:102:6909:20:20:74:519:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ñe.g. through wage compression by Örms ñthen making the redistribution through taxation
4:103:6996:20:21:74:519:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:could reduce welfare via its e§ects on the private insurerís budget. In the extreme case where
4:104:7090:21:20:74:519:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:private insurance markets function optimally, the planner would end up strictly reducing wel-
4:105:7183:20:20:74:519:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:fare by implementing such redistributive taxes (Kaplow 1991).  Intuitively, the government
4:106:7273:20:21:74:519:172:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:exacerbates the moral hazard distortion created by private-sector insurance, and must there-
4:107:7365:21:20:74:519:151:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:fore take into account the amount of private insurance and degree of crowdout to calculate the
4:108:7459:20:16:74:519:131:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:optimal policy. Taking the observed earnings distribution as a reáection of marginal products
4:109:7552:16:15:87:519:115:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:2We do not consider multiple dealing as it is treated in detail by Pauly (1974). We also do not consider
4:110:7656:15:11:74:519:100:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:administrative costs, but conjecture that it would be straightforward to extend the formulas we develop to
4:111:7762:11:0:74:435:89:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:incorporate such costs using estimates of loading factors for public and private insurance.
5:112:7854:0:20:74:519:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ñas is standard practice both in the theory of optimal taxation and in policy debates ñmay
5:113:7944:20:21:74:388:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:therefore lead to misleading conclusions about optimal tax policy.
5:114:8010:21:20:91:519:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The second lesson is that it is important to distinguish private insurance mechanisms that
5:115:8100:20:20:74:519:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:generate moral hazard from those that do not.  While ìformalî arms-length insurance con-
5:116:8188:20:21:74:519:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tracts are likely to generate as much moral hazard as public insurance, ìinformalîrisk sharing
5:117:8282:21:20:74:519:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:arrangements ñsuch as borrowing from close relatives or relying on spousal labor supply to
5:118:8372:20:20:74:519:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:bu§er shocks ñmay involve much less moral hazard. When private insurance does not gener-
5:119:8460:20:21:74:519:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ate moral hazard, the formula for optimal government beneÖts coincides exactly with existing
5:120:8552:21:20:74:519:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:formulas that ignore private insurance completely.   This is because the e§ect of informal
5:121:8642:20:20:74:519:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:private insurance is already captured in the smaller consumption-smoothing e§ect of public
5:122:8732:20:21:74:519:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:insurance. This point is of practical importance because existing empirical studies estimate
5:123:8824:21:20:74:519:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the extent of formal and informal insurance without distinguishing their policy implications
5:124:8916:20:20:74:518:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(e.g. Townsend 1994, Cullen and Gruber 2000, Attanasio and Rios-Rull 2000, Schoeni 2002).
5:125:9005:20:21:91:519:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The third lesson is that even when the level of private insurance enters the formula for
5:126:9093:21:20:74:519:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:optimal beneÖts, it matters for a very di§erent reason than what is traditionally emphasized
5:127:9185:20:20:74:519:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the literature (e.g. Cutler and Gruber 1996a). The conventional wisdom is based on Okunís
5:128:9277:20:20:74:519:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:proverbial ìleaky bucket:îmore government expenditure is required to achieve a given increase
5:129:9370:20:21:74:519:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in insurance coverage when there is crowdout of private insurance.  Since the marginal cost
5:130:9461:21:20:74:519:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of public funds exceeds one, this leakage lowers the welfare gain from public insurance. In our
5:131:9556:20:20:74:519:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:model, this channel does not operate because a formal private insurance contract generates
5:132:9646:20:21:74:519:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:exactly the same moral hazard distortion in e§ort as public insurance. The added deadweight
5:133:9737:21:20:74:519:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:burden generated by higher taxes to fund public insurance is exactly o§set by the reduction
5:134:9828:20:20:74:520:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in deadweight burden because of lower formal private insurance premiums.3The reason that
5:135:9916:20:21:74:519:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the level of formal private insurance actually matters is that it imposes a Öscal externality on
5:136:10012:21:20:74:519:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the public sector, as in Pauly (1974), where non-exclusive insurance contracts lead to over-
5:137:10104:20:20:74:181:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:provision of insurance.
5:138:10127:20:21:91:519:172:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To illustrate how our formula can be applied to obtain quantitative predictions about
5:139:10212:21:20:74:519:151:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:optimal policy, we present applications to unemployment insurance (UI) and health insurance.
5:140:10304:20:16:74:519:131:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In the unemployment application, we focus on severance pay provided by private employers
5:141:10392:16:15:87:519:115:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:3In practice, government insurance programs may be funded using more distortionary tools than private
5:142:10493:15:11:74:519:100:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:insurance programs.  In this case, the deadweight burden o§set is less than 100% and the bucket becomes
5:143:10596:11:0:74:97:89:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:leaky.
6:144:10603:0:20:74:519:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as a form of private insurance.  Severance pay generates moral hazard because it can induce
6:145:10694:20:21:74:519:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:workers to shirk on the job, since they do not fully internalize the costs of being laid o§.
6:146:10786:21:20:74:519:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Using variation in UI beneÖt laws across states in the U.S., we estimate that a 10% increase in
6:147:10881:20:20:74:519:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:UI beneÖt levels reduces private insurance against job loss (severance pay) by approximately
6:148:10973:20:21:74:519:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:7%.  Plugging this estimate into our formula along with other parameter estimates from the
6:149:11063:21:20:74:519:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:existing literature, we Önd that there is a fairly wide range of parameters for which standard
6:150:11157:20:20:74:519:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:formulas that ignore private insurance and crowdout imply that raising the beneÖt level would
6:151:11250:20:21:74:307:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:raise welfare when in fact it would lower welfare.
6:152:11300:21:20:91:519:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Our second application explores the welfare gains from expanding public health insurance
6:153:11388:20:20:74:519:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(e.g. Medicare and Medicaid) using existing estimates of behavioral responses to health insur-
6:154:11482:20:21:74:519:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ance. Calibrations of our formula suggest that the aggregate level of public health insurance is
6:155:11578:21:20:74:519:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:near the optimum given the amount of private insurance and its response to public insurance.
6:156:11670:20:20:74:519:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Accounting for private insurance is very important: the standard formula that ignores the
6:157:11759:20:21:74:519:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:private insurance provision overstates the welfare gain from an aggregate expansion of public
6:158:11852:21:20:74:519:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:health insurance by a factor of more than 100 with existing elasticity estimates. Note that
6:159:11943:20:20:74:519:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:these calibration results are based on a representative-agent model with elasticity estimates
6:160:12036:20:20:74:519:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for the aggregate population.  There are likely to be subgroups of the population that are
6:161:12126:20:21:74:519:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:underinsured, such as low income individuals, and others that are overinsured.  Our analysis
6:162:12218:21:20:74:519:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:should therefore be interpreted not as a policy recommendation but rather as a call for further
6:163:12313:20:20:74:519:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:work estimating the key elasticities by subgroup to identify how public health insurance should
6:164:12408:20:21:74:134:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:be reformed.
6:165:12420:21:20:91:519:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This paper builds on and relates to several strands of the literature on optimal insurance.
6:166:12511:20:20:74:519:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:One theoretical literature has considered optimal insurance and government redistribution
6:167:12600:20:21:74:519:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:problems jointly (e.g., Blomqvist and Horn, 1984, Rochet, 1991, Cremer and Pestieau, 1996).
6:168:12691:21:20:74:519:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:These papers analyze models with heterogeneity in ability to earn (as in Mirrlees 1971) coupled
6:169:12786:20:20:74:519:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with ex-post shocks to income (such as a health shock).  In these models, the government is
6:170:12877:20:21:74:519:172:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the sole provider of insurance, and chooses both an optimal income tax schedule and a social
6:171:12969:21:20:74:519:151:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:insurance program.4In contrast, our paper considers a simpler model with a single source of
6:172:13060:20:16:74:519:131:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:earnings heterogeneity, which does not distinguish between risk and ability but allows public
6:173:13153:16:15:87:519:115:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:4An exception is Boadway et al. (2006), who allow for private insurance. However, they assume that private
6:174:13259:15:11:74:519:100:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:insurers observe ability while the government does not.  In our model, private and public insurers have the
6:175:13366:11:0:74:201:89:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:same informational constraints.
7:176:13398:0:20:74:230:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and private insurance to coexist.
7:177:13431:20:21:91:519:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Models with private and public insurance have been considered in the literature on optimal
7:178:13521:21:20:74:519:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:health insurance (e.g., Besley 1989, Selden 1993, Blomqvist and Johansson 1997, Petretto
7:179:13609:20:20:74:519:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:1999, Encinosa 2003, Barrigozzi 2006).  We develop empirically implementable formulas for
7:180:13698:20:21:74:519:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the welfare gains from public insurance in such models.  Our formulas help to connect the
7:181:13787:21:20:74:519:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:theoretical work to the corresponding empirical literature on the interaction between private
7:182:13880:20:20:74:519:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and public health insurance (e.g., Ginsburg 1988, Taylor et al. 1988, Wolfe and Godderis 1991,
7:183:13974:20:21:74:519:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Cutler and Gruber 1996a-b, Finkelstein 2004).  The formulas we derive are in the same spirit
7:184:14066:21:20:74:519:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as recent su¢ cient statistic formulas in that they shed light on the essential features of the
7:185:14161:20:20:74:519:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:models that matter for welfare analysis.  However, unlike typical su¢ cient statistic results,
7:186:14255:20:21:74:519:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the formulas we derive here are based on stylized models and therefore may not be fully robust
7:187:14349:21:20:74:519:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to modiÖcations of the primitive structure, an issue that we discuss in greater detail in the
7:188:14442:20:20:74:126:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:conclusion.
7:189:14453:20:21:91:519:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The most closely related paper to our study is that of Einav, Finkelstein, and Cullen (2008),
7:190:14546:21:20:74:519:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:who develop a di§erent method of characterizing welfare in a model with adverse selection in
7:191:14638:20:20:74:519:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the private insurance market.  Einav et al. show that the slopes of the demand and cost
7:192:14725:20:20:74:519:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:curves for private insurance are together su¢ cient statistics for welfare. Our formula depends
7:193:14820:20:21:74:519:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:instead on ex-post behavioral responses to change in government beneÖt levels.  The two
7:194:14907:21:20:74:519:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:formulas are complements.  Einav et al.ís method is easier to implement when exogenous
7:195:14993:20:20:74:519:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:price variation in insurance markets and demand and cost data are available; our formulas
7:196:15082:20:21:74:519:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:may be easier to implement when there is variation in government beneÖt levels that permits
7:197:15173:21:20:74:519:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimation of ex-post behavioral responses.  Likewise, Einav et al.ís method will yield reliable
7:198:15269:20:20:74:519:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:results in markets where ex-ante insurance purchase decisions reveal true preferences, while
7:199:15361:20:21:74:472:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:our formulas rely on optimization of choices such as consumption and labor supply.
7:200:15443:21:20:91:519:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.  We begin in section 2 by analyzing
7:201:15530:20:20:74:519:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a model without private insurance as a benchmark.  In Section 3, we introduce endogenous
7:202:15618:20:21:74:519:172:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:private insurance by studying a model in which the government and private sector have the
7:203:15707:21:20:74:519:151:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:same tools, but the level of private insurance is not necessarily set optimally.   Section 4
7:204:15799:20:20:74:519:131:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:considers a model with market limitations due to the inability of the private sector to insure
7:205:15893:20:21:74:519:111:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:pre-existing risks and adverse selection. The applications are presented in section 5.  Section
7:206:15988:21:0:74:132:90:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:6 concludes.
8:207:16001:0:31:74:342:700:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:2  Benchmark: Second-Best Contract
8:208:16035:31:20:74:519:669:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We analyze models where the government uses tax or social insurance policies to redistribute
8:209:16127:20:21:74:519:649:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:income across individuals with di§erent levels of earnings.   Risk averse individuals would
8:210:16218:21:20:74:519:628:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:like to insure themselves against the risk of having low output realizations.  If e§ort were
8:211:16310:20:20:74:519:608:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:observable, the ìÖrst-bestî contract would provide full insurance and the agents would be
8:212:16399:20:21:74:519:588:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:required to exert the Örst best optimal level of e§ort. If e§ort is unobservable, the Örst-best
8:213:16494:21:20:74:519:567:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:contract is not incentive compatible. The optimal contract when e§ort is unobservable speciÖes
8:214:16588:20:20:74:519:547:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:consumption levels contingent on output realization that reduce the variance of consumption.
8:215:16680:20:21:74:519:527:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In this section, we characterize this ìsecond-bestîcontract, which reáects the optimal policy
8:216:16773:21:20:74:519:506:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for a single insurer (government or private). This is the problem considered in previous studies
8:217:16869:20:20:74:519:486:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that developed su¢ cient statistic formulas for taxation and social insurance (e.g. Saez 2001,
8:218:16963:20:21:74:145:466:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Chetty 2006a).
8:219:16977:21:20:91:519:445:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We analyze this problem using two canonical models in the optimal tax and social insurance
8:220:17067:20:20:74:519:425:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:literatures.  The Örst is a ìmoral hazardîmodel, in which the level of output is a stochastic
8:221:17160:20:21:74:519:405:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:function of the individualís e§ort choice.  This model, which is equivalent to Varianís (1980)
8:222:17254:21:20:74:519:384:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:model of taxation, can be interpreted as a model of optimal social insurance against shocks
8:223:17345:20:20:74:519:364:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:such as unemployment or illness.5The second model is a ìhidden skillî model, in which
8:224:17430:20:21:74:519:344:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the uncertainty about output (skill) levels is resolvedbeforeindividuals choose e§ort.  This
8:225:17522:21:20:74:519:323:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:model is the same as that studied by Mirrlees (1971), and is more naturally suited to studying
8:226:17616:20:20:74:519:303:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:optimal redistribution across individuals with di§erent skills.  To simplify the analysis, we
8:227:17709:20:21:74:519:283:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:restrict attention to optimal linear contracts throughout, and show that the two models yield
8:228:17802:21:29:74:243:262:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the same results for such contracts.

8:235:18311:14:11:74:519:114:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:in the social insurance literature.  In the theoretical analysis, we use the tax notation to highlight similarities
8:236:18426:11:0:74:237:103:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:between the formulas in the two models.

10:313:21174:21:20:91:520:417:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Three aspects of this formula deserve mention  First, the elasticity"-z;1-mmeasures the

12:434:25997:27:20:74:519:231:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:Moral Hazard Model.We begin by introducing notation to distinguish the private and
12:435:26079:20:21:74:519:211:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:government insurance contracts.  Let-denote the tax rate chosen by the government and
12:436:26164:21:20:74:519:190:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:tthe tax rate in the private insurance contract.  Private insurance applies to raw output
12:437:26253:20:20:74:519:170:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f3:(zH;zL). We denote bywi= (1-t)zi+t-zthe net-of-private insurance incomes in each state.
12:438:26340:20:21:74:519:150:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f5:Government taxation applies to the net wage incomeswi, and we denote byci= (1--)wi+--w
12:439:26426:21:20:74:519:129:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Önal disposable income.  Concretely, the private insurer can be thought of as a Örm that
12:440:26514:20:17:74:519:109:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:compresses its wage structure (wH-wL) relative to true marginal products (zH-zL) to

13:442:26686:0:20:74:519:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:provide insurance.  The government can only observe earnings, not true underlying marginal
13:443:26776:20:21:74:316:680:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:products, and hence sets taxes as a function ofw.9

13:446:26984:20:21:74:519:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:social welfare, the resulting contract would be identical to that described in the single insurer
13:447:27081:21:20:74:519:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:setting above.  However, in practice private insurers take the government contract-as given
13:448:27172:20:20:74:520:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:when they chooset.  As a result, they fail to internalize the e§ects of their choice ofton

14:508:29603:32:20:91:519:463:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Proposition 1 shows that private insurance a§ects the formula for the optimal tax rate in
14:509:29692:20:21:74:519:443:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:two ways.  First, the added-tterm on the right side of (9) reáects the mechanical reduction
14:510:29783:21:20:74:519:422:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the optimal level of government taxation given the presence of private insurance.  Formula
14:511:29876:20:20:74:520:402:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(9) shows that thesumof private and public insurance should be set according to the standard
14:512:29968:20:21:74:519:382:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:formula, and hence the optimal-is reduced in proportion tot.  The second e§ect is that the
14:513:30058:21:20:74:519:361:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:inverse elasticity term is multiplied by1-r.  Sincer >0, this e§ect also makes the optimal
14:514:30148:20:20:74:519:341:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:government tax rate smaller.  Intuitively, the elasticity relevant for optimal taxation is the
14:515:30242:20:21:74:519:321:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:fundamental elasticity of output with respect to total taxes"-z;1-m="-w;1-m, which measures
14:516:30333:21:20:74:519:300:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the total moral hazard cost (to both the private and public insurers) of redistributing one dollar
14:517:30431:20:20:74:519:280:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of tax revenue. To recover the fundamental output elasticity in the presence of crowdout, one
14:518:30524:20:21:74:520:260:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:must rescale the observed elasticity"-w;1--by11-r. Therefore, the crowdout rateronly matters
14:519:30616:21:20:74:519:239:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for rescaling the observed elasticity, and plays no fundamental economic role in the formula. If
14:520:30712:20:20:74:519:219:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:one could measure the fundamental elasticity"-w;1-mdirectly, an estimate of crowdout would
14:521:30802:20:21:74:148:199:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:be unnecessary.
14:522:30817:21:20:91:519:178:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This intuition about the relevance of crowdout di§ers from the conventional wisdom (see
14:523:30904:20:20:74:519:158:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:e.g., Cutler and Gruber 1996a-b). The conventional wisdom is that crowdout makes govern-
14:524:30992:20:21:74:519:138:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ment intervention less desirable because it requires more government expenditure to achieve a
14:525:31085:21:20:74:519:117:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:given insurance level, and raising revenue to Önance government expenditure is costly because
14:526:31178:20:0:74:519:97:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the deadweight burden of taxation.  This intuition does not apply in our model because
15:527:31269:0:20:74:519:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the tax levied by the private insurer generates exactly the same deadweight burden as govern-
15:528:31362:20:21:74:519:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ment taxation.  A natural counterargument is that private insurance may not generate moral
15:529:31452:21:20:74:519:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:hazard because private insurers can monitor e§ort more closely. However, we show in section
15:530:31543:20:20:74:519:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:3.3 that in this case, crowdout is actually irrelevant because the optimal private contract does
15:531:31639:20:21:74:198:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:not generate externalities.
15:532:31666:21:20:91:519:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:An important implication of (9) is that if the wage structure already reáects implicit
15:533:31752:20:20:74:519:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:insurance provided by the private sector, then standard optimal tax formulas that are functions
15:534:31847:20:21:74:519:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the observed wage distributions and wage earnings elasticities are invalid.  Intuitively, the
15:535:31943:21:20:74:519:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:private sector already bears a moral hazard cost for the insurance it provides. The government
15:536:32037:20:20:74:519:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:exacerbates this pre-existing distortion by introducing additional insurance. Therefore, one
15:537:32129:20:21:74:499:497:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:must take into account the amount of private insurance to back out the optimal policy.10
15:538:32217:21:20:91:519:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In the simple model considered here, the planner can replicate the second-best optimal

15:554:33516:16:15:83:520:128:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:10In redistributive taxation applications, it is challenging to measure the private insurance ratetbecause the

17:676:36211:29:20:91:519:453:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This proposition shows that the standard lessons of the theory of excess burden apply in
17:677:36299:20:20:74:519:433:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:our model: the welfare cost of taxation is proportional to the size of the behavioral response
17:678:36393:20:21:74:519:413:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to taxation and the marginal cost of taxation increases linearly with the tax rate.  However,
17:679:36486:21:20:74:519:392:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:there is one important di§erence relative to the traditional analysis.  In standard models of
17:680:36579:20:20:74:519:372:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:taxation and social insurance without endogenous private insurance, the deadweight burden
17:681:36668:20:21:74:519:352:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of taxation is an e¢ ciency cost that the government would be willing to trade-o§ against the
17:682:36761:21:20:74:519:331:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:beneÖts of more insurance. In the present model, the level of redistribution through market
17:683:36852:20:20:74:519:311:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f4:insurance is already optimal given incentive constraints, and thus the net welfare gainequals
17:684:36945:20:21:74:519:291:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the deadweight burden of taxation.   Hence, a benevolent government should do precisely
17:685:37032:21:20:74:113:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:nothing.
17:686:37040:20:20:91:519:250:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:When private insurance markets function optimally, government insurance via taxation or
17:687:37127:20:20:74:519:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:social insurancestrictlyreduces welfare because crowdout of private insurance is imperfect. To
17:688:37221:20:21:74:519:210:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:understand the intuition, it is helpful to consider an example. Suppose the government naively
17:689:37315:21:20:74:518:189:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f6:thinks it can achieve the second-best optimum by setting-andRsuch that(1--)zH+R=c-H
17:690:37398:20:20:74:519:169:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and(1--)zL+R=c-Lwhere(c-L;c-H)denotes the optimal second-best insurance contract
17:691:37478:20:21:74:519:149:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:for a single insurer.  This tax system would achieve the optimum described in Section 2 if
17:692:37568:21:20:74:519:128:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the private insurance market chose not to provide any insurance.  However, zero insurance
17:693:37657:20:20:74:519:108:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is not the contract that will emerge in an economy with a private insurance market.  Since
17:694:37747:20:0:74:519:88:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:zL(1--)+R < zH(1--)+R, individuals will Önd it worthwhile to purchase further insurance
18:695:37836:0:20:74:519:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:from private providers. This additional insurance would increase the expected utility of the
18:696:37928:20:21:74:519:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:agent and the insurance companies would break even.  But the individual and private insurer
18:697:38019:21:20:74:519:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:do not internalize the e§ect of their choices on the governmentís budget.  The added private
18:698:38111:20:20:74:519:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:insurance reduces e§ort below the second-best optimum and hence leads to a lower average
18:699:38199:20:21:74:519:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:output than the government was expecting. As a result, the government goes into deÖcit and
18:700:38289:21:20:74:284:598:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:its lumpsum grantRneeds to be reduced.11
18:701:38329:20:20:91:519:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We are not the Örst to make the point that government intervention is undesirable when
18:702:38415:20:21:74:519:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:private insurance markets function e¢ ciently.  When private insurance is set optimally, the
18:703:38507:21:20:74:519:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:market equilibrium with no government intervention is information-constrained Pareto e¢ -
18:704:38596:20:20:74:519:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:cient.  Abstractly, it is well known that when the private market equilibrium is constrained
18:705:38688:20:21:74:519:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:e¢ cient, government price distortions lead to ine¢ ciency (Prescott and Townsend 1984a-b).
18:706:38779:21:20:74:519:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Kaplow (1991) makes a similar point about the welfare losses from government intervention in
18:707:38871:20:20:74:519:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a simple social insurance model, and Blomqvist and Johannson (1997) and Barrigozzi (2006)
18:708:38960:20:21:74:519:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:obtain similar results in a model with public and private health insurance.  The main con-
18:709:39050:21:20:74:519:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:tribution of the present paper is to develop formulas for the welfare gains from government
18:710:39141:20:20:74:451:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:intervention when the private market does not reach the second-best optimum.
18:711:39217:20:20:91:519:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Two additional remarks on Proposition 2 deserve mention.  First, we expect that the
18:712:39300:20:21:74:519:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:relationship between the degree of crowdoutrand risk aversion will generally have an inverted
18:713:39393:21:20:74:519:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:U-shape.  When individuals are risk neutral (u(c) =c), there is no private insurance (t= 0)
18:714:39484:20:20:74:520:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:so there is by deÖnition no crowdout (r= 0). At the other extreme, with inÖnite risk aversion
18:715:39577:20:21:74:519:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:andzL= 0,cov(z;u0) =--z--u0and (13) combined with (14) implies thatt=(1-t) = 1="u-z;1-m.
18:716:39665:21:20:74:520:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:If the uncompensated elasticity does not vary with the net-of-tax rate1-m, the private
18:717:39751:20:20:74:520:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:insurance ratetis independent of-.  Therefore, in the case of inÖnite risk aversion, there
18:718:39841:20:21:74:519:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is also no crowdout.  For any interior case with non-zero, Önite risk aversion, crowdout will
18:719:39934:21:20:74:519:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:be positive and incomplete.  Hence, government intervention is likely to induce the greatest

18:722:40197:21:16:91:519:151:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Second, a corollary of Proposition 2 is that in the absence of private market failures, public
18:723:40291:16:14:83:519:135:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:11These results contrast with the analysis of Golosov and Tsyvinski (2007), who argue that government
18:724:40392:14:11:74:519:121:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:insurance has no e§ect on social welfare in static models because of 100% crowdout.   The reason for the
18:725:40496:11:11:74:519:110:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:di§erence is that Golosov and Tsyvinski study government intervention where the government controls directly
18:726:40604:11:11:74:519:99:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:the Önal consumption outcomes whereas we consider the e§ects of distortionary taxation, which is typically the
18:727:40714:11:0:74:212:88:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:nature of policies used in practice.
19:728:40752:0:20:74:519:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:goods should be Önanced via a uniform lump-sum tax that generates the desired amount of
19:729:40839:20:21:74:519:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:revenue, even if agents have di§erent marginal utilities of income in each state. The private
19:730:40932:21:20:74:519:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:insurance market will then set redistribution to the optimal level. A distortionary tax to Önance
19:731:41029:20:20:74:519:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the public good would lead to lower expected utility than a lump-sum tax that generated an
19:732:41119:20:21:74:519:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:equivalent amount of revenue.  This point underscores the substantial e§ect that endogenous
19:733:41210:21:20:74:519:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:private insurance arrangements can have on standard intuitions in the literatures on optimal

19:735:41332:29:27:74:350:549:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:3.3  Private Insurance Without Moral Hazard
19:736:41375:27:21:74:519:522:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Thus far, we have considered private insurance contracts that generate the same amount of
19:737:41464:21:20:74:519:501:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:moral hazard as public insurance.  However, ìinformalîprivate risk-sharing mechanisms may
19:738:41553:20:20:74:519:481:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:involve less moral hazard.  Examples include self insurance through spousal labor supply or
19:739:41644:20:21:74:519:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:insurance through relatives who can monitor e§ort.12In this section, we explore how the
19:740:41731:21:20:74:382:440:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:degree of moral hazard in private insurance a§ects our formulas.
19:741:41795:20:20:91:519:420:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:Moral Hazard Model.Consider a model where government insurance generates moral haz-
19:742:41878:20:21:74:519:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ard but private insurance does not.  When private insurance does not generate moral hazard,
19:743:41969:21:20:74:519:379:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:reaching the Örst-best of full insurance would be feasible in principle, completely eliminating
19:744:42064:20:20:74:519:359:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the role for government intervention. In practice, there are costs of informal insurance ñsuch
19:745:42158:20:21:74:522:339:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as limits to liquidity, costs of borrowing from relatives, or relying on spousal labor supply ñ
19:746:42253:21:20:74:519:318:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that prevent full insurance.  We model such costs by a loading factor on informal insurance
19:747:42344:20:20:74:519:298:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:transfers: transferringTto the low state requires a payment ofT+s(T)in the high state
19:748:42429:20:21:74:519:278:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:wheres(:)is an increasing and convex loading factor cost withs(0) = 0.  The informal insur-
19:749:42520:21:20:74:519:257:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ance contract involves no moral hazard, in the sense that the agent internalizes the e§ect of
19:750:42613:20:20:74:518:237:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f5:his e§ort choice on the insurerís budget.  Hence,eandTare chosen simultaneously (taking-

21:847:45533:20:20:74:519:498:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:must therefore be taken into account directly in the formula.  If private insurance does not

21:850:45730:20:20:91:519:437:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The irrelevance of informal insurance again challenges the existing literature, which views

21:852:45914:21:20:74:519:396:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In the context of informal insurance, the conventional wisdom would posit that if distortionary
21:853:46009:20:20:74:519:376:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:government insurance partly displaces non-distortionary private insurance, then government
21:854:46099:20:20:74:519:356:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:intervention increases moral hazard e¢ ciency costs and is less desirable. This reasoning misses
21:855:46195:20:21:74:519:336:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the point that informal insurance itself must have costs if individuals are not fully insured in
21:856:46291:21:20:74:519:315:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:equilibrium. If informal private insurance is optimized, the marginal welfare loss from having
21:857:46385:20:20:74:519:295:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:less informal insurance must be exactly o§set by the marginal gain from paying less for that

21:859:46568:21:20:74:521:254:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the displacement of informal insurance by public insurance does not lead to a ìleaky bucketî

22:870:47339:27:20:74:518:623:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f5:We model pre-existing public information as follows. The population is partitioned intoK

22:872:47517:21:20:74:519:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:graphic region of birth. Groupkcontains a fractionpkof the population and has (conditional)

22:875:47647:11:17:275:519:559:8:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f3:kpkfk(n). Group identity is known by both private
22:876:47696:17:20:74:520:542:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:insurers and individuals before signing insurance contracts, but the realization ofnwithin a
22:877:47788:20:21:74:519:522:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:group is unknown to both insurers and individuals when signing the contract.  As a result,
22:878:47878:21:20:74:519:501:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:private insurance is o§eredwithineach groupk.  The private insurer o§ers an insurance rate

22:880:48056:20:21:74:519:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Section 3.  At the other extreme, when the number of groups is as large as the number of
22:881:48144:21:20:74:519:440:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:individuals, all information is revealed before contracts can be signed and there is no scope for
22:882:48241:20:20:74:519:420:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:private insurance contracts. In contrast, the government can impose redistributive taxation
22:883:48332:20:21:74:193:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on the entire population.
22:884:48357:21:20:91:519:379:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We assume that the government is restricted to using a uniform tax rate-on earnings.
22:885:48441:20:20:74:519:359:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This is a strong assumption in the present model because the government could potentially

24:1111:52633:31:21:91:519:108:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Equation (17) shows that the welfare gain from government intervention in this more gen-
24:1112:52721:21:0:74:519:87:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:eral model consists of two elements: (1) increased insurance within groups, which is captured
25:1113:52816:0:20:74:519:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:by parameters analogous to those analyzed in the baseline case, and (2) increased insurance
25:1114:52907:20:21:74:519:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:across groups, which reáects the gains from pooling risk across types.  In the present model,
25:1115:53000:21:20:74:519:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(1) only is operative if private insurance is not optimized; if it was, this term would be zero
25:1116:53095:20:20:74:257:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:and only the second term is operative.
25:1117:53133:20:21:91:519:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:When private insurance is optimized, the optimal tax rate follows a modiÖed formula where

25:1119:53310:20:20:74:520:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:equal to the average in groupk.  Intuitively, private insurance takes care of within group
25:1120:53400:20:21:74:519:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:insurance as well as the government could.  Therefore, the government should focus solely on
25:1121:53492:21:20:74:519:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:redistributionacrossgroups, which cannot be insured by the private sector because of pre-
25:1122:53581:20:20:74:521:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:existing information.   Finally, (19) shows that the government can again ignore ìinformalî

26:1182:55031:20:29:74:518:639:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:information, provided that the tax rate and crowdout parameter are measured appropriately.16
26:1183:55123:29:28:74:209:610:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:4.2  Adverse Selection
26:1184:55145:28:20:74:519:582:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Now suppose that each individual knows which group he belongs to before signing insurance
26:1185:55234:20:20:74:519:562:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:contracts, but insurers do not have this information. This model is an extension of the classic
26:1186:55329:20:20:74:519:542:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:adverse selection models proposed by Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976) and Wilson (1977). If
26:1187:55418:20:21:74:519:522:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:private insurers were to o§er a menu of competitive insurance contracts with insurance rates
26:1188:55510:21:20:74:519:501:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f3:(t1;::;tM), individuals in groupkwould self-select the insurance rate that yields the highest
26:1189:55603:20:20:74:519:481:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:expected utility and private insurers would make negative proÖts. Hence, private insurers are
26:1190:55696:20:21:74:519:461:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:forced to adjust contracts to respect incentive compatibility constraints. A strong equilibrium
26:1191:55791:21:20:74:519:440:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is deÖned as a set of contracts such that no Örm can make positive proÖts by o§ering a new
26:1192:55881:20:20:74:519:420:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:insurance contract. When such strong equilibria exist, they are always separating in the sense
26:1193:55975:20:21:74:519:400:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that each groupkselects a single and speciÖc insurance ratetk(Rothschild and Stiglitz 1976).
26:1194:56067:21:20:74:519:379:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:When such strong equilibria do not exist, it is necessary to weaken the concept of equilibrium
26:1195:56161:20:20:74:323:359:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:to obtain existence of an equilibrium (Wilson 1977).
26:1196:56213:20:21:91:519:339:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Here, we restrict attention to the region of the parameter space where an equilibrium exists.
26:1197:56306:21:20:74:520:318:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In this equilibrium, each groupkis o§ered private insurance at tax ratetk.  Thetkcan be
26:1198:56393:20:20:74:519:298:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:common across some groups if there is partial pooling. Furthermore thetkdepend on the
26:1199:56478:20:21:74:519:278:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:government tax rate-.  Assume that thetkare smooth functions of-so that crowdout rates
26:1200:56564:21:20:74:519:257:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:rkare well deÖned and welfare gains are smooth.17The revelation principle implies that in
26:1201:56653:20:20:74:519:237:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:equilibrium each individual will truthfully reveal his typek.  Hence, the equilibrium in this
26:1202:56746:20:21:74:519:217:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:model can be viewed as a special case of the pre-existing information model analyzed above,
26:1203:56837:21:20:74:519:196:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:where private insurance contracts were set arbitrarily. It follows that the general formula (17)
26:1204:56933:20:17:74:485:176:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in Proposition 3.1 and the alternative representation in (20) hold in this environment.
26:1205:57020:17:14:83:519:159:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:16Implementing (20) exactly would require knowledge about the structure of the groups and private insurance
26:1206:57127:14:11:74:519:145:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:contracts to measure^tand^r. The measurement of the amount of private insurance is complicated in tax models
26:1207:57235:11:11:74:519:134:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:because it requires knowledge of marginal products.  In social insurance applications, the amount of private
26:1208:57343:11:7:74:362:123:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:insurance can be measured directly because there are explicit transfers.
26:1209:57415:7:15:83:519:116:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:17In cases with multiple equilibria, this assumption requires that the allocation never jumps across equilibria
26:1210:57526:15:0:74:193:101:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:following a small change in-.
27:1211:57557:0:20:91:519:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Adverse selection does, however, a§ect the formula with optimized private insurance (18)
27:1212:57645:20:21:74:519:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:because it distorts the provision of private insurance within groups.  This leads to a violation
27:1213:57741:21:20:74:519:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of the within-group private insurance optimality conditiont-k=-covk(w=-wk;u0=-u0k)="k.  To

27:1234:58053:21:20:74:519:553:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:There are two components in (21). The Örst term reáects the value of redistribution across
27:1235:58143:20:20:74:519:533:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the groups, as in (18).  The second term reáects the value of Öxing the distortions created by

27:1238:58422:20:20:74:519:472:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:within-group redistribution even if private contracts are optimized in the presence of adverse
27:1239:58516:20:21:74:118:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:selection.
27:1240:58526:21:20:91:519:431:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:More generally, (21) implies that the government tax rate-should behigherthan in

27:1242:58698:20:21:74:519:391:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This e§ect is captured in the general formula in (20) with non-optimized private insurance
27:1243:58788:21:20:74:519:370:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:contracts, because one would observe a higher absolute value ofcov(w;u0)if adverse selection

27:1247:59161:20:20:74:519:289:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:class of models we have analyzed.  Since (20) has the same form as (9) up to the weighting of
27:1248:59254:20:20:74:520:269:11:g_d0_f5:11:g_d0_f3:tandr, we conclude that (9) and (8) can be used to obtain simple approximate measures of

28:1258:59989:20:20:74:520:632:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:or illness. In the social insurance literature, contracts are characterized by a beneÖtBpaid to

28:1260:60176:21:20:74:519:591:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:high state.  Since the insurerís break-even constraint isT= (1-e)-B=e, the consumption

29:1355:63712:27:21:74:519:112:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The existing literature on optimal unemployment insurance essentially ignores the existence
29:1356:63803:21:0:74:519:91:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of private insurance.  Much of private insurance against unemployment is provided through
30:1357:63894:0:20:74:519:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:informal risk sharing that is unlikely to generate much moral hazard, and hence can be ignored
30:1358:63988:20:21:74:519:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in the calculation of optimal beneÖts according to the results in section 3.3.  However, many
30:1359:64081:21:20:74:519:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:private Örms provide unemployment insurance in the form of severance payments ñ lump

30:1361:64249:20:21:74:519:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:unemployment beneÖts, severance pay does not distort job search behavior after job loss
30:1362:64336:21:20:74:519:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:because it does not a§ect marginal incentives to search.  Severance pay can, however, distort
30:1363:64429:20:20:74:519:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:e§ort choices while working by changing the relative price of being unemployed relative to
30:1364:64519:20:21:74:136:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:having a job.
30:1365:64532:21:20:91:519:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In this section, we calibrate the welfare gain from raising the UI beneÖt level when the
30:1366:64620:20:20:74:519:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:response of severance pay to UI beneÖts is taken into account.  To adapt the optimal UI
30:1367:64707:20:21:74:519:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:problem to our static framework above, we ignore the job search decision, treating search
30:1368:64796:21:20:74:519:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:e§ort after job loss as invariant to the UI beneÖt level.  Instead, we focus on the distortion in
30:1369:64893:20:20:74:519:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the probability of job loss (e.g. due to shirking) caused by UI beneÖts and severance pay.  In
30:1370:64987:20:21:74:519:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:our static model, both UI beneÖts and severance pay act as transfers to the unemployed state,
30:1371:65080:21:20:74:314:415:11:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f3:and are Önanced by taxes in the employed state.18

30:1373:65216:20:20:74:519:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:needed to implement our formula with endogenous private insurance, we begin by estimating

30:1376:65483:20:20:74:519:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on behalf of the Department of Labor.   The dataset (publicly available from the Upjohn
30:1377:65570:20:21:74:519:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Institute) is a sample of unemployment durations in 25 states in 1998 that oversamples UI
30:1378:65659:21:20:74:519:273:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:exhaustees.   We reweight the data using the sampling weights to obtain estimates for a
30:1379:65746:20:20:74:519:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:representative sample of job losers.   The dataset contains information on unemployment
30:1380:65833:20:21:74:519:233:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:durations, demographic characteristics, and an indicator for receipt of severance pay.  There
30:1381:65926:21:20:74:519:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:are 3,395 individuals in the sample, of whom 508 report receiving a severance payment.  See
30:1382:66017:20:20:74:519:192:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Chetty (2008a) for further details on the dataset and sample construction.  We obtain data
30:1383:66107:20:21:74:461:172:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on mean unemployment beneÖts by state in 1998 from the Department of Labor.
30:1384:66182:21:20:91:520:151:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:To calculatebp=b, Örst note that 15% of job losers report receiving severance pay in our
30:1385:66270:20:17:74:519:131:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:data.  According to calculations reported in Chetty (2008a), the mean severance payment
30:1386:66357:17:14:83:519:114:6:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:18A more precise calibration would take account of the fact that UI beneÖts are conditioned on duration, and
30:1387:66465:14:11:74:519:100:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:thus are larger when a worse ìstateîis realized.  This calibration would require separate estimates of the e§ect
30:1388:66577:11:0:74:327:89:9:g_d0_f3:9:g_d0_f3:of UI beneÖts and severance pay on the probability of job loss.
31:1389:66642:0:20:74:519:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:conditional on receipt of severance pay is equal to 10.7 weeks of wages, the mean UI beneÖt

31:1391:66821:21:21:74:478:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:aggregate population, the ratio of total private insurance to total public insurance is

31:1399:67019:20:21:74:519:581:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:exploit variation in UI beneÖt levels across states.  Most states pay a Öxed wage replacement
31:1400:67112:21:20:74:519:560:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:rate up to a maximum, which varies considerably across states and thereby creates variation in
31:1401:67206:20:20:74:519:540:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:UI beneÖt levels. The maximum beneÖt can be viewed as an instrument for individual beneÖt
31:1402:67295:20:21:74:519:520:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:levels (Meyer 1990). We do not exploit the variation in beneÖt levels across individuals within
31:1403:67390:21:20:74:519:499:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a state because of endogeneity concerns.  Although state beneÖt maximums are exogenous to
31:1404:67479:20:20:74:519:479:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:individual characteristics, they are not orthogonal to all aspects of the economic environment.
31:1405:67574:20:21:74:519:459:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:In particular, richer states (or those with a higher cost of living) provide both more public and
31:1406:67671:21:20:74:519:438:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:private insurance.  As a result, both state unemployment beneÖt maximums and the fraction
31:1407:67760:20:20:74:519:418:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:of individuals receiving severance pay are positively correlated with mean wage rates in each
31:1408:67853:20:21:74:519:398:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:state.  To account for this confounding factor, we control for wages throughout our analysis
31:1409:67945:21:20:74:352:377:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:using a áexible 10 piece spline for the individual log wage.
31:1410:68005:20:20:91:519:357:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We begin with a simple graphical analysis to illustrate our estimation of the crowdout e§ect.
31:1411:68098:20:21:74:519:337:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Figure 1 plots the relationship between average severance pay receipt and the maximum UI
31:1412:68186:21:20:74:519:316:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:beneÖt level, conditioning on wages.  To construct this Ögure, we Örst regress the severance
31:1413:68278:20:20:74:519:296:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:pay dummy on the wage spline and the maximum UI beneÖt level on the wage spline and
31:1414:68361:20:21:74:519:276:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:compute residuals.  We then compute mean residuals of both variables by state.  The Ögure
31:1415:68450:21:20:74:519:255:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is a scatter plot of the mean residuals. We exclude states that have fewer than 50 individuals

31:1417:68641:20:21:74:519:215:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the regression analysis below. The Ögure shows that states with higher UI beneÖt levels have
31:1418:68733:21:20:74:519:194:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:fewer severance payments, indicating that private insurance is crowded out to some extent by

32:1430:69538:20:20:74:519:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:UI beneÖt maximum would reduce the fraction of individuals receiving severance pay by 7

32:1435:69913:21:20:91:519:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:SpeciÖcations 1 and 2 can be interpreted as ìreduced formî regressions which show the

32:1438:70180:21:20:74:519:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:we estimate a two-stage least squares regression, instrumenting the log individual beneÖt level
32:1439:70275:20:20:74:519:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:with the log state maximum.  The estimate on the log individual beneÖt, reported in column

32:1441:70455:20:21:74:520:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:10.5 percentage points, relative to a mean value of 15%, implying"bp;b=-0:7.  We conclude

32:1443:70583:20:20:91:519:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:The identiÖcation assumption underlying these regressions is that the cross-state variation
32:1444:70674:20:21:74:519:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in UI beneÖt maximums is orthogonal to other determinants of severance pay receipt condi-

32:1446:70855:20:20:74:519:253:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:estimate of the crowdout e§ect.  For example, suppose states with higher UI beneÖt maxi-

32:1448:71034:21:20:74:519:212:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:on insurance.  Such states would also have higher private insurance, biasing the correlation

35:1617:75881:20:21:74:519:291:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:that a $100 million expansion in public health insurance programs would, loosely speaking,
35:1618:75971:21:20:74:519:270:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:generate $28 million in surplus net of the requisite tax increases.  This analyst would mistak-
35:1619:76066:20:20:74:519:250:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:enly conclude that substantial expansions in the overall level of public health insurance are
35:1620:76159:20:21:74:519:230:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:desirable.  Taking crowdout into account implies that we are near the optimum in terms of
35:1621:76248:21:20:74:520:209:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f3:aggregatepublic health insurance levels, as a $100 million across-the-board expansion would
35:1622:76339:20:20:74:305:189:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:generate only $0.17 million in net social surplus.
35:1623:76389:20:21:91:519:169:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:There are several important caveats to this calibration that should be kept in mind when
35:1624:76477:21:20:74:519:148:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:evaluating the policy implications of this simple calibration. First, this calculation does not
35:1625:76572:20:20:74:519:128:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:fully account for adverse selection, as it neglects the beneÖts of redistributing across pre-
35:1626:76665:20:21:74:519:108:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:existing risk types via government insurance reáected in the Örst term of (21).   Second,
35:1627:76754:21:0:74:519:87:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the calibration ignores the correlation between health shocks and income inequality, which
36:1628:76846:0:20:74:519:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:could potentially increase the welfare gains from health insurance (Cremer and Pestieau 1996).
36:1629:76940:20:21:74:519:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Third, private health insurance beneÖts are already tax subsidized in the United States, an
36:1630:77031:21:20:74:519:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:issue that we have neglected in the calculation above. Finally, and perhaps most importantly,
36:1631:77124:20:20:74:519:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:our aggregate welfare gain calculation ignores substantial heterogeneity across types of people,
36:1632:77220:20:21:74:519:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:conditions, Medicare vs. Medicaid, etc.  For some subgroups, such as the uninsured, there
36:1633:77309:21:20:74:519:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:could clearly be substantial welfare gains from increasing public insurance beneÖts whereas for
36:1634:77404:20:20:74:519:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:others there could be substantial welfare gains from cutting beneÖts. Equation (28) should be
36:1635:77497:20:21:74:519:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:applied with group-speciÖc estimates of the inputs to identify how government health insurance
36:1636:77591:21:34:74:348:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:expenditures should be restructured to maximize welfare.
36:1637:77647:34:31:74:176:503:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:6  Conclusion
36:1638:77660:31:20:74:519:472:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:This paper has characterized the welfare gain from public insurance in the presence of endoge-
36:1639:77754:20:21:74:519:452:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:nous private insurance. The formulas for optimal tax and social insurance policies derived here
36:1640:77849:21:20:74:519:431:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:highlight two general parameters as the determinants of how private insurance impacts the
36:1641:77938:20:20:74:519:411:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:welfare gains from social insurance: (1) the size of the formal private insurance market and (2)
36:1642:78034:20:21:74:521:391:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the crowdout of formal private insurance by public insurance. Like recent ìsu¢ cient statisticî
36:1643:78129:21:20:74:519:370:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:formulas for welfare analysis, the formulas we have derived can be implemented using reduced-
36:1644:78222:20:20:74:519:350:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:form empirical evidence without full identiÖcation of the modelís primitives. However, unlike
36:1645:78315:20:21:74:519:330:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:existing su¢ cient statistic formulas, we cannot make strong claims about the robustness of our
36:1646:78410:21:20:74:519:309:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:formulas because they have been derived in stylized models. While experience with earlier suf-
36:1647:78504:20:20:74:519:289:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Öcient statistic formulas suggests that the results may generalize (Chetty 2008b), an important
36:1648:78599:20:21:74:519:269:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:di§erence in models with endogenous private insurance is that the envelope conditions that
36:1649:78689:21:20:74:519:248:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:underlie the robustness of previous formulas may not hold when the private sector outcome
36:1650:78778:20:20:74:519:228:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:is constrained ine¢ cient.  Thus, the source of the deviation from constrained e¢ ciency ñe.g.
36:1651:78872:20:21:74:519:208:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:asymmetric information, imperfect optimization, or administrative costs ñ could potentially
36:1652:78963:21:20:74:519:187:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:a§ect the formula. We believe that the parameters we have identiÖed are likely to be relevant
36:1653:79056:20:20:74:406:167:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:in more general models, but other factors may also prove be relevant.
36:1654:79125:20:21:91:519:147:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:We see three major directions for generalization of our analysis. First, one should charac-
36:1655:79216:21:20:74:519:126:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:terize the e§ects of government intervention on the equilibria in the adverse selection model,
36:1656:79310:20:0:74:519:106:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:as in Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976) and Wilson (1977).  We have implicitly assumed that
37:1657:79400:0:20:74:519:700:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:contracts and behavior will respond smoothly to changes in government policies, but in a
37:1658:79488:20:21:74:519:680:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:setting with multiple equilibria, there could be jumps between equilibria that would invali-
37:1659:79580:21:20:74:519:659:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:date our formula.  Second, it would be useful to extend the analysis to allow for di§erent
37:1660:79670:20:20:74:519:639:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:loading factors for private and public insurance, microfounded via increasing returns or waste-
37:1661:79765:20:21:74:519:619:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:ful marketing costs.  Conversely, one could allow for di§erent levels of e¢ ciency, reáecting
37:1662:79858:21:20:74:519:598:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:the possibility that private insurers could be more e¢ cient because of competitive pressure.
37:1663:79951:20:20:74:519:578:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:Finally, in the simple model we analyzed here, the best policy is simply to rule out formal
37:1664:80042:20:21:74:519:558:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:private insurance and have the government provide all insurance.  However, there are some
37:1665:80131:21:20:74:519:537:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:areas in which private insurers have an informational advantage relative to the government.
37:1666:80222:20:20:74:519:517:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:For instance, employers have more information on e§ort on the job, making the moral hazard
37:1667:80312:20:21:74:519:497:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:problem smaller for the employer. Characterizing the optimal mix of government and private
37:1668:80402:21:20:74:247:476:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:insurance is an important next step.
37:1669:80438:20:20:91:519:456:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:If government and private insurers optimize along the lines described by our analysis, our
37:1670:80528:20:21:74:519:436:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:model makes testable predictions about the pattern of insurance contracts we should observe.
37:1671:80620:21:20:74:519:415:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:For instance, private insurance should be more prevalent in economies with low job mobility
37:1672:80711:20:20:74:519:395:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:(such as Japan), where Örms have the ability to insure shocks through a compressed wage
37:1673:80798:20:20:74:519:375:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:structure without facing as much adverse selection.  Another prediction is that government
37:1674:80888:20:21:74:519:355:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:insurance should be more prevalent for shocks that occur prior to the point at which insurance
37:1675:80982:21:20:74:519:334:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:contracts can be purchased, such as disability at birth, or for shocks where optimization of
37:1676:81074:20:20:74:519:314:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:insurance purchases is unlikely.  It would be valuable to test empirically whether observed
37:1677:81165:20:0:74:401:294:11:g_d0_f3:11:g_d0_f3:contracts deviate systematically from these theoretical prescriptions.
