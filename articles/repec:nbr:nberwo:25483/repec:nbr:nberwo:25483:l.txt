2:25:1214:28:28:274:339:602:12:Times:12:Times:F:ABSTRACT
2:26:1222:28:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:F:We analyze the role that the launch of new drugs has played in reducing the number of years of 
2:27:1317:14:28:72:500:560:12:Times:12:Times:F:life lost (YLL) before 3 different ages (85, 70, and 55) due to 66 diseases in 27 countries.
2:28:1408:28:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:g_d0_f1:F:We estimate 2-way fixed-effects models of the rate of decline of the disease- and country-specific 
2:29:1506:14:14:72:546:518:12:Times:12:Times:F:age-standardized YLL rate.   The models control for the average decline in the YLL rate in each 
2:30:1602:14:28:72:220:504:12:Times:12:Times:F:country and from each disease.
2:31:1631:28:14:72:546:476:12:Times:12:Times:F:One additional drug launch 0-11 years before year t is estimated to have reduced the pre-age-85 
2:32:1727:14:14:72:545:462:12:Times:12:Times:F:YLL rate  (YLL85)  in  year  t  by  3.0%,  and  one  additional  drug  launch  12  or  more  years  before 
2:33:1833:14:14:72:545:448:12:Times:12:Times:F:year t is estimated to have reduced YLL85 by 5.5%.  (A drug’s utilization peaks 8-10 years after 
2:34:1929:14:14:72:545:434:12:Times:12:Times:F:it  was  launched.)    Controlling for  the  number  of  drugs  previously  launched,  YLL  rates  are 
2:35:2031:14:28:72:363:420:12:Times:12:Times:F:unrelated to the number of drug classes previously launched.
2:36:2090:28:14:72:546:392:12:Times:12:Times:F:The estimates imply that, if no new drugs had been launched after 1981, YLL85 in 2013 would 
2:37:2182:14:14:72:545:378:12:Times:12:Times:F:have been 2.16 times as high as it actually was.  We estimate that pharmaceutical expenditure per 
2:38:2279:14:14:72:545:364:12:Times:12:Times:F:life-year saved before age 85 in 2013 by post-1981 drugs was $2837.  This amount is about 8% of 
2:39:2374:14:14:72:546:350:12:Times:12:Times:F:per capita GDP, indicating that post-1981 drugs launched were very cost–effective, overall.  But 
2:40:2470:14:42:72:519:336:12:Times:12:Times:F:the fact that an intervention is cost-effective does not necessarily mean that it is “affordable.”

3:52:2809:14:13:107:518:653:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:We perform an econometric analysis of the role that pharmaceutical innovation—the 
3:53:2891:13:14:71:510:640:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:introduction and use of new drugs—has played in reducing the number of years of life lost 
3:54:2981:14:14:71:540:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:(YLL) before 3 different ages (85, 70, and 55) due to 66 diseases in 27 countries.  We estimate 2-
3:55:3079:14:14:71:492:612:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:way fixed-effects models of the rate of decline of the disease- and country-specific age-
3:56:3168:14:14:71:518:598:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:standardized premature mortality rate.   The models control for the average (across diseases) 
3:57:3262:14:13:71:505:584:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:decline in the premature mortality rate in each country, and the average (across countries) 
3:58:3354:13:14:71:535:571:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:decline in the premature mortality rate from each disease.  This approach is feasible because the 
3:59:3452:14:14:71:492:557:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:B:relative number of drugs launched for different diseases has varied considerably across 
3:60:3540:14:14:71:128:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:countries.   
3:61:3552:14:14:107:534:529:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:One additional drug launch 0-11 years before year t is estimated to have reduced the pre-
3:62:3641:14:13:72:525:515:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:age-85 YLL rate (YLL85) in year t by 3.0%, and one additional drug launch 12 or more years 
3:63:3732:13:14:72:536:502:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:before year t is estimated to have reduced YLL85 by 5.5%.  The larger estimated effect of drugs 
3:64:3828:14:14:72:524:488:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:launched 12 or more years before year t is not surprising, considering the gradual diffusion of 
3:65:3924:14:14:71:532:474:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:new drugs and the likelihood of a lag from utilization to mortality reduction.  When lower YLL 
3:66:4019:14:14:71:528:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:age thresholds are used, the estimates are qualitatively similar to, but larger in magnitude than, 
3:67:4118:14:13:71:529:446:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the YLL85 estimates.  Controlling for the number of drugs previously launched, YLL rates are 
3:68:4211:13:14:71:376:433:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:unrelated to the number of drug classes previously launched.    
3:69:4274:14:14:108:535:419:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:The estimates imply that, if no new drugs had been launched after 1981, YLL85 in 2013 
3:70:4360:14:14:72:523:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:would have been 2.16 times as high as it actually was.  For a subset of 22 countries for which 
3:71:4455:14:14:72:523:391:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:complete 2013 pharmaceutical expenditure data are available, we estimate that the number of 
3:72:4547:14:13:72:532:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:life-years before age 85 gained in 2013 from drugs launched after 1981 was 148.7 million.  We 
3:73:4641:13:14:72:538:364:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:also estimate that drugs launched after 1981 saved 82.6 million life years before age 70 and 44.9 
3:74:4739:14:14:72:541:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:million life-years before age 55 in 22 countries in 2013.  The fraction of life-years saved by more 
3:75:4839:14:14:71:519:336:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:recent drugs is slightly larger than their fraction of drug volume, which is consistent with the 
3:76:4936:14:14:71:540:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:hypothesis that the average quality of new drugs is superior to the average quality of older drugs. 
3:77:5035:14:13:107:542:308:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:We estimate that pharmaceutical expenditure per life-year saved before age 85 in 2013 by 
3:78:5124:13:14:71:518:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:post-1981 drugs was $2837.  This amount is about 8% of per capita GDP, so these estimates 
3:79:5214:14:14:71:465:281:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:indicate that the new drugs launched after 1981 were very cost–effective, overall. 
3:80:5296:14:14:71:537:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Post-1981 drug launches are estimated to have reduced YLL85 by 34% between 2000 and 2013, 
3:81:5386:14:14:71:525:253:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:which is larger than the actual 2000-2013 reduction in YLL85: 23%.  Similarly, the estimated 
3:82:5479:14:13:71:521:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:2000-2013 reductions in YLL70 and YLL55 (39% and 42%, respectively) are larger than the 
3:83:5567:13:14:71:524:226:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:actual (24% and 28%) reductions.  One possible explanation for the finding that the estimated 
3:84:5661:14:14:71:511:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:drug-launch-induced YLL declines are larger than the actual declines is that trends in other 
3:85:5754:14:14:71:507:198:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:factors (e.g. diabetes and obesity prevalence) were increasing mortality.  Another possible 
3:86:5846:14:14:71:522:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:explanation is that mortality-increasing between-disease spillover effects (e.g. cardiovascular 
3:87:5942:14:13:71:521:170:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:drug launches might increase cancer mortality) outweigh mortality-reducing spillover effects 
3:88:6035:13:14:71:504:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:(e.g. mental health drug launches might reduce cardiovascular mortality).  But even if the 
3:89:6126:14:14:71:511:143:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:number of life-years saved in 2013 was 33% or 50% lower than the amount implied by our 
3:90:6213:14:14:71:523:129:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:estimates (which do not account for between-disease spillover effects), the evidence indicates 
3:91:6308:14:14:71:516:115:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:that drugs launched since 1982 have been highly cost-effective, overall.  But the fact that an 
3:92:6403:14:13:71:454:101:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:intervention is cost-effective does not necessarily mean that it is “affordable.”

4:96:6503:21:20:108:526:667:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Global health has improved during the 21st century.  Life expectancy at birth increased 
4:97:6591:20:21:72:538:647:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f5:B:from 66.5 years in 2000 to 72.0 years in 2016 [1].  Also, according to the WHO’s Global Health 
4:98:6686:21:21:72:521:626:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:B:Estimates, the number of years of life lost1 per 100,000 population declined by 29% between 
4:99:6778:21:21:71:518:605:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:2000 and 2016 [2].  Longevity has increased, despite the fact that the global prevalence (age-
4:100:6872:21:20:72:528:584:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:standardized) of diabetes has nearly doubled since 1980, rising from 4.7% to 8.5% in the adult 
4:101:6967:20:21:72:521:564:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:population [3], and the global prevalence of obesity (BMI > 30) among adults increased 39% 
4:102:7058:21:21:72:403:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:(from 8.7% to 12.1% of the population) between 2000 and 2013 [4]. 
4:103:7124:21:20:108:539:522:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Some researchers have argued that biomedical innovation has been the principal cause of 
4:104:7212:20:21:72:484:502:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:recent improvements in health.  Fuchs [5] said that “since World War II...biomedical 
4:105:7297:21:21:72:529:481:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:innovations (new drugs, devices, and procedures) have been the primary source of increases in 
4:106:7391:21:20:72:511:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:longevity,” although he did not provide evidence to support this claim.  Cutler, Deaton and 
4:107:7483:20:21:71:519:440:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Lleras-Muney [6] performed a survey of a large and diverse literature on the determinants of 
4:108:7576:21:21:72:501:419:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:mortality, and “tentatively identif[ied] the application of scientific advance and technical 
4:109:7669:21:21:72:512:398:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:progress (some of which is induced by income and facilitated by education) as the ultimate 
4:110:7760:21:20:72:532:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:determinant of health.”  They concluded that “knowledge, science, and technology are the keys 
4:111:7854:20:21:72:521:357:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:to any coherent explanation” of mortality.  Other research has shown that most technological 
4:112:7947:21:21:72:528:336:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:progress is “embodied”: to benefit from technological progress, people must use new products 
4:113:8040:21:20:72:147:315:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and services.2   
4:114:8057:20:21:108:528:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Most scholars agree with Jones’ [9] statement that “technological progress is driven by

4:116:8235:21:20:72:532:253:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:substances and devices sector was the most R&D-intensive3 major industrial sector in the U.S.: 
4:117:8330:20:21:71:516:233:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:almost twice as R&D-intensive as the next-highest sector (information and electronics), and 
4:118:8422:21:34:71:537:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:three times as R&D-intensive as the average for all major sectors.  [10].  According to Dorsey et 
4:119:8520:34:9:72:217:178:122:g_d0_f7:122:g_d0_f7:F:                                                           
4:120:8578:9:15:72:521:169:42:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:1 Years of life lost (YLL) is an estimate of the average years a person would have lived if he or she had not died 
4:121:8693:15:11:72:526:154:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:prematurely. It is, therefore, a measure of premature mortality.  One can calculate the number of years of life lost 
4:122:8810:11:8:72:535:143:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:before different ages.  If a person died at age 60, he or she lost 10 years before age 70 and 25 years before age 85.   
4:123:8930:8:15:72:518:135:42:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:2 Solow [7] argued that “many if not most innovations need to be embodied in new kinds of durable equipment 
4:124:9038:15:12:72:540:120:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:before they can be made effective.  Improvements in technology affect output only to the extent that they are carried 
4:125:9156:12:11:72:500:108:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:into practice either by net capital formation or by the replacement of old-fashioned equipment by the latest 
4:126:9265:11:12:72:517:97:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:models...”  Hercowitz [8] concluded that “‘embodiment’ is the main transmission mechanism of technological 
4:127:9372:12:8:72:232:85:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:progress to economic growth” (p. 223). 
4:128:9411:8:0:72:261:77:42:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:3 R&D intensity is the ratio of R&D to sales.    
5:129:9462:0:21:72:529:709:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:al [11], in 2008, 88% of privately-funded U.S. biomedical research expenditure was funded by 
5:130:9555:21:21:71:513:688:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms; the remaining 11% was funded by medical device 
5:131:9642:21:20:71:103:667:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:firms. 
5:132:9648:20:21:107:505:647:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:The purpose of this study is to assess econometrically the role that pharmaceutical 
5:133:9732:21:21:71:538:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:innovation—the introduction and use of new drugs—has played in reducing the number of years 
5:134:9824:21:21:71:530:605:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:of life lost before 3 different ages (age 85, 70, and 55) in 27 countries.  During the period 1982-
5:135:9923:21:20:71:529:584:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:2015,4 1300 new chemical entities (NCEs)5 were launched6 in one or more of those countries.  
5:136:10016:20:21:72:530:564:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:For reasons discussed below, there is likely to be a substantial lag between the launch of a new 
5:137:10113:21:21:72:539:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:drug and its maximum impact on the burden of disease, so we will allow for considerable lags in 
5:138:10209:21:20:72:413:522:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the relationship between new drug launches and the burden of disease. 
5:139:10278:20:21:108:540:502:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Figure 1 shows the number of NCE launches during 1982-2015, by country.  The number 
5:140:10362:21:21:72:491:481:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:of NCE launches in the two countries with the smallest number of launches (Israel and 
5:141:10448:21:20:72:538:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Venezuela) was about half as large as the number of NCE launches in the two countries with the 
5:142:10543:20:21:72:523:440:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:highest number of launches (the USA and Germany).  The number of new drug launches also 
5:143:10631:21:21:72:521:419:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:varied considerably across diseases.  Figure 2 shows the number of new chemical substances 
5:144:10722:21:21:72:491:398:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:used to treat 30 diseases that were launched in at least one country during 1982-2015.   
5:145:10811:21:20:108:522:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:We have (“three-dimensional”) data on both the number of drug launches and the age-
5:146:10894:20:21:72:541:357:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:standardized premature mortality rate by country, disease, and year, so our analysis will be based 
5:147:10993:21:21:72:526:336:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:on a three-way fixed effects model of the premature mortality rate.   From that model, we will 
5:148:11088:21:20:72:514:315:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:derive a 2-way fixed-effects model (which is easier to estimate) of the rate of decline of the 
5:149:11182:20:21:72:533:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:premature mortality rate.   That model will include both country fixed effects, which control for 
5:150:11280:21:21:72:538:274:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the average (across diseases) decline in the premature mortality rate in each country, and disease 
5:151:11379:21:20:72:536:253:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:fixed effects, which control for the average (across countries) decline in the premature mortality 
5:152:11477:20:21:72:537:233:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:rate from each disease.  This approach is feasible because the relative number of drugs launched 
5:153:11574:21:21:72:525:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:for different diseases has varied considerably across countries.  This is illustrated by Figure 3, 
5:154:11673:21:21:72:540:191:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:which shows the number of drugs launched during 2006-2015 in Japan and Portugal for 19 types 
5:155:11766:21:50:72:515:170:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:of cancer.  The mean (across cancer sites) number of drugs launched during 2006-2015 was

5:157:11913:8:12:72:358:112:42:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:4 Our drug launch data cover the period January 1982-November 2015. 
5:158:11980:12:15:72:522:100:42:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:5 The FDA defines a new chemical entity as a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the 
5:159:12091:15:8:72:504:85:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:FDA in any other application submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. 
5:160:12196:8:0:72:365:77:42:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:6 The launch of a drug is defined as the first commercial sale of the drug. 
6:161:12274:0:21:72:520:709:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:almost identical in Japan and Portugal (3.3 and 3.2, respectively), but Japan launched 4 more 
6:162:12368:21:21:72:345:688:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:drugs for leukemia and 4 fewer drugs for ovary cancer.   
6:163:12424:21:20:108:536:667:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Different organizations use different age thresholds to compute YLL.  The age threshold 
6:164:12512:20:21:72:535:647:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:used in the OECD Health Statistics database [12] is age 70.  A U.S. Centers for Disease Control 
6:165:12608:21:21:72:541:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and Prevention website [13] allows one to calculate YLL before ages 65, 70, 75, 80, and 85.  The 
6:166:12705:21:21:72:518:605:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f5:B:Global Burden of Disease 2010 reference life table used an age threshold of 86 years.  WHO 
6:167:12796:21:20:72:499:584:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:B:Global Health Estimates uses an age threshold of 91.93 years.7  We will analyze the age-
6:168:12884:20:21:72:423:564:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:standardized rate of years of life lost before three ages (85, 70, and 55).   
6:169:12961:21:21:72:538:543:122:g_d0_f7:144:g_d0_f4:B: In the next section, we will describe the econometric model that we will use to assess the 
6:170:13052:21:20:72:538:522:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:role that pharmaceutical innovation has played in reducing premature mortality from 66 diseases 
6:171:13147:20:21:72:528:502:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:in 28 countries during the period 2000-2013.  The data sources used to estimate this model are 
6:172:13242:21:21:71:525:481:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:discussed on Section III.  Empirical results are presented in Section IV.  Some implications of

6:180:13693:21:21:72:287:312:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:where Ydc  t is one of the following variables:

6:188:14112:9:15:72:537:192:42:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:7 Some of the experts consulted by WHO argued that it was not appropriate to set the normative loss of years of life 
6:189:14229:15:11:72:529:177:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:in terms of currently observed death rates, since even for the lowest observed death rates there are a proportion of 
6:190:14346:11:12:72:529:166:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:deaths that are preventable or avertable. In fact, Japanese females have already exceeded the GBD 2010 reference 
6:191:14459:12:11:72:530:154:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:life expectancy at birth, with a life expectancy at birth in 2013 of 87.1 years. Since the loss function is intended to 
6:192:14579:11:12:72:526:143:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:represent the maximum life span of an individual in good health, who is not exposed to avoidable health risks, or 
6:193:14693:12:11:72:530:131:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:severe injuries, and receives appropriate health services, the WHO chose to base its Global Health Estimates YLL 
6:194:14806:11:12:72:538:120:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:age threshold on the frontier national life expectancy projected for the year 2050 by the World Population Prospects 
6:195:14923:12:11:71:540:108:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:2012.  The highest projected life expectancies for the year 2050 are projected to be achieved by women in Japan and 
6:196:15039:11:12:71:529:97:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:the Republic of Korea, with a life expectancy at birth of 91.9 years. While this may still not represent the ultimate 
6:197:15157:12:11:71:509:85:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:achievable human life spans, it does represent a set of life spans which are thought likely to be achieved by a

7:217:15984:21:20:72:537:446:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:drugs launched may be considered a measure of the stock of pharmaceutical “ideas.”  Jones [17] 
7:218:16078:20:21:72:526:426:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:argued that “long-run growth is driven by the discovery of new ideas throughout the world.”8  
7:219:16172:21:21:72:512:405:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Nordhaus [18] argued that “improvements in health status have been a major contributor to 
7:220:16262:21:20:72:524:384:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:economic welfare over the twentieth century. To a first approximation, the economic value of 
7:221:16355:20:21:72:538:364:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:increases in longevity in the last hundred years is about as large as the value of measured growth 
7:222:16454:21:21:72:527:343:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:in non-health goods and services.”  The specification of eq. (1) incorporates the assumption of 
7:223:16550:21:20:71:524:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:diminishing marginal productivity of drug launches: each additional drug launch for a disease 
7:224:16644:20:21:71:346:302:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:results in a diminishing absolute reduction in mortality.   
7:225:16704:21:21:108:535:281:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Estimates based on eq. (1) will provide evidence about the impact of the launch of drugs 
7:226:16793:21:21:72:534:260:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:for a disease on the burden of that disease, but they will not capture possible spillover effects of 
7:227:16894:21:20:72:531:239:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the drugs on the burden of other diseases.  These spillovers may be either positive or negative.  
7:228:16991:20:21:72:517:219:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:For example, the launch of cardiovascular drugs could reduce mortality from cardiovascular 
7:229:17082:21:21:72:513:198:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:disease, but increase mortality from the “competing risk” of cancer.  On the other hand, the 
7:230:17175:21:20:72:515:177:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:launch of drugs for mental disorders could reduce mortality from other medical conditions.  
7:231:17267:20:37:72:493:157:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Prince et al [19] argued that “mental disorders increase risk for communicable and non-

7:233:17412:8:15:72:531:112:42:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:8 The discovery of new ideas could increase economic output for two different reasons.  First, output could simply 
7:234:17527:15:12:72:515:97:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:be positively related to the quantity (and variety) of ideas ever discovered.  Second, output could be positively 
7:235:17641:12:11:72:538:85:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:related to the (mean or maximum) quality of ideas ever discovered, and new ideas may be better (of higher quality), 
7:236:17757:11:0:71:180:74:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f7:F:on average, than old ideas. 
8:237:17786:0:21:72:541:709:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:communicable diseases, and contribute to unintentional and intentional injury. Conversely, many 
8:238:17882:21:21:72:503:688:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:health conditions increase the risk for mental disorder, and comorbidity complicates help-
8:239:17972:21:20:72:368:667:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:seeking, diagnosis, and treatment, and influences prognosis.” 
8:240:18033:20:21:108:539:647:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:The launch of a drug in a country indicates that patients could have been treated with that 
8:241:18125:21:21:72:514:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:drug, not necessarily that patients were treated with that drug.  We would prefer to estimate 
8:242:18219:21:21:72:535:605:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:models in which the explanatory variables measured the drugs actually used to treat patients, by 
8:243:18316:21:20:72:540:584:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:disease, country, and year.  We have annual data for 2007-2017 on the utilization of each drug in 
8:244:18414:20:21:72:528:564:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:each country.  However, many drugs have multiple indications—50% of drugs have 2 or more 
8:245:18503:21:21:72:530:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:indications (causes of disease in the WHO Global Health Estimates disease classification), and 
8:246:18598:21:20:72:531:522:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:7% of drugs have 5 or more indications—and our data do not enable us to determine how often 
8:247:18690:20:21:72:297:502:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:each drug was used for each of its indications. 
8:248:18738:21:21:108:525:481:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Since our drug launch variables are imperfect measures of exposure to pharmaceutical 
8:249:18823:21:20:72:541:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:innovation, the estimated coefficients on those variables are likely to be biased towards zero, and 
8:250:18923:20:21:72:538:440:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:our estimates of the number of life-years saved by new drugs are likely to be conservative.  Here 
8:251:19021:21:21:71:479:419:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:is the first paragraph of the eminent MIT econometrician Jerry Hausman’s article on 
8:252:19105:21:21:71:356:398:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:mismeasured variables in econometric analysis [20, p. 57]: 
8:253:19164:21:13:107:532:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:The effect of mismeasured variables in statistical and econometric analysis is one of the 
8:254:19254:13:14:107:481:364:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:oldest known problems, dating from the 1870s in Adcock (1878). In the most 
8:255:19329:14:14:107:516:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:straightforward regression analysis with a single regressor variable, the least squares 
8:256:19417:14:14:107:537:336:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:estimate is downward biased in magnitude toward zero. While a mismeasured right-hand 
8:257:19502:14:14:107:533:322:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:side variable creates this problem, a mismeasured left-hand side variable under classical 
8:258:19592:14:13:107:507:308:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:assumptions does not lead to bias. The only result is less precision in the estimated 
8:259:19678:13:14:107:271:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:coefficient and a lower t -statistic.

8:262:19802:21:20:71:523:246:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:2000 and 2013.9  We will also estimate models based on more general versions of eq. (1) that 
8:263:19895:20:21:72:534:226:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:will allow either (1) the effect of drugs launched 0-5 years before year t to differ from the effect 
8:264:19996:21:21:71:523:205:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:of drugs launched 6-11 years before year t, and (2) mortality to depend on the number of new 
8:265:20089:21:20:71:442:184:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:B:classes of drugs launched in addition to the number of new drugs launched.   
8:266:20166:20:21:107:527:164:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:In eq. (1), drugs launched in two periods (11 or fewer years before year t vs. more than 
8:267:20255:21:22:71:509:143:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:11 years before year t) are allowed to have different effects on mortality in year t.  We will 
8:268:20350:22:35:71:540:121:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:perform tests of the null hypothesis β0-11 = β12+, but we expect |β0-11| < |β12+|, i.e. we expect drugs

9:271:20610:0:21:72:534:709:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:launched more than 11 years before year t to have a more negative impact on mortality in year t 
9:272:20706:21:21:72:507:688:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:than drugs launched 11 or fewer years before year t.  There is likely to be a substantial lag 
9:273:20800:21:20:72:538:667:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:between the launch of a new drug and its maximum impact on the burden of disease.  Utilization 
9:274:20895:20:21:72:540:647:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:of recently-launched drugs tends to be much lower than utilization of drugs launched many years 
9:275:20991:21:21:72:542:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:earlier.  Evidence about the shape of the drug-age (number of years since launch) drug-utilization 
9:276:21090:21:22:72:368:605:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:profile can be obtained by estimating the following equation:

9:280:21270:14:14:186:420:528:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:years after it was first launched (n = 0, 1,..., 18)

9:288:21686:21:21:72:517:387:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:2017 on 721 molecules.  Estimates of the “relative utilization index” are shown in Figure 4.  
9:289:21780:21:20:72:522:366:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:These estimates indicate that utilization of a drug reaches a peak about 8-10 years after it was 
9:290:21877:20:21:72:458:346:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:launched.  It is used about twice as much then as it was two years after launch.   
9:291:21960:21:21:108:537:325:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Due to gradual diffusion of new drugs, the maximum impact of a drug on disease burden 
9:292:22046:21:20:72:531:304:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:is likely to occur a number of years after it was launched, but the peak effect could occur either 
9:293:22145:20:21:72:531:284:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:more than or less than 8-10 years after launch. The lag might be longer because some drugs for 
9:294:22240:21:21:72:497:263:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:chronic diseases (e.g. statins) may have to be consumed for several years to achieve full 
9:295:22330:21:20:72:522:242:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:effectiveness.  But the lag might be shorter because the impact of a drug on disease burden is 
9:296:22425:20:21:72:539:222:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:likely to depend on its quality (or effectiveness) as well as on its quantity (utilization), and drugs 
9:297:22528:21:22:72:497:201:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:launched more recently are likely to be of higher quality than earlier-vintage drugs.  10, 11

9:299:22679:9:16:72:523:170:42:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f4:F:10 Grossman and Helpman [21] argued that “innovative goods are better than older products simply because they 
9:300:22786:16:11:72:529:154:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:provide more ‘product services’ in relation to their cost of production.”  Bresnahan and Gordon [22] stated simply 
9:301:22899:11:12:72:526:143:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:that “new goods are at the heart of economic progress,” and Bils [23] said that “much of economic growth occurs 
9:302:23010:12:11:71:532:131:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:through growth in quality as new models of consumer goods replace older, sometimes inferior, models.”  As noted 
9:303:23122:11:12:71:542:120:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:by Jovanovic and Yatsenko [24], in “the Spence–Dixit–Stiglitz tradition...new goods [are] of higher quality than old 
9:304:23239:12:8:71:104:108:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f7:F:goods.” 
9:305:23246:8:15:72:528:100:42:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:11 The impact on mortality may depend on the interaction (quantity * quality) of the two variables.  The mortality 
9:306:23361:15:11:72:527:85:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:impact will increase with respect to drug age (time since launch) if the rate of increase of quantity with respect to 
9:307:23479:11:0:72:519:74:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:age is greater than the rate of decline of quality with respect to age; otherwise the mortality impact will decline.

10:313:24038:21:21:72:526:605:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:world after 1981; data on pre-1982 launches are not available.  Consequently, our drug launch

10:317:24418:22:21:72:519:521:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:random, it is likely to bias estimates of the drug launch coefficients (especially β12+) towards 
10:318:24515:21:20:72:98:500:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:zero.

10:322:24783:21:21:72:533:417:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:mortality, e.g. they control for the possibility that the severity of ischemic heart disease tends to 
10:323:24885:21:21:72:531:396:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:be greater in Brazil than it is in the United States.  The country-year fixed effects (γct’s) control 
10:324:24987:21:21:72:535:375:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:for changes in a country’s attributes (e.g. its average income, educational attainment, and health

10:328:25280:21:21:72:508:292:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:(1) disease incidence, and (2) the number of non-pharmaceutical medical innovations (e.g. 
10:329:25370:21:22:72:541:271:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:medical device innovations) for disease d that had been launched in country c.  However, there is

10:331:25526:8:15:72:497:241:42:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:12 The ATC Classification System is used for the classification of active ingredients of drugs according to 
10:332:25634:15:12:72:505:226:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:the organ or system on which they act and their therapeutic, pharmacological and chemical properties [25].  
10:333:25742:12:11:72:529:214:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which 
10:334:25854:11:12:72:530:203:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:they act, their therapeutic intent or nature, and the drug's chemical characteristics. Different brands share the same 
10:335:25973:12:11:72:483:191:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:code if they have the same active substance and indications. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a 
10:336:26074:11:12:72:541:180:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one 
10:337:26192:12:11:72:493:168:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:drug can have more than one code, for example acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) has A01AD05 as a drug for 
10:338:26295:11:12:72:533:157:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic; as well as one 
10:339:26410:12:11:72:527:145:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:code can represent more than one active ingredient, for example C09BB04 is the combination of perindopril with 
10:340:26521:11:12:72:499:134:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:amlodipine, two active ingredients that have their own codes (C09AA04 and C08CA01respectively) when 
10:341:26621:12:9:72:142:122:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:prescribed alone. 
10:342:26638:9:11:72:378:113:42:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:13 There are 1782 (= 66 × 27) fixed effects for disease d in country c (αdc’s). 
10:343:26717:11:16:72:539:102:42:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:14 For example, suppose that ln(Ydct) depends on EDUct (where EDUct = average educational attainment in country c 
10:344:26831:16:12:72:533:86:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:in year t), and that γd—the marginal effect of EDUct on ln(Ydct)—does not vary across diseases (γd = γ, all d).  Then 
10:345:26949:12:0:71:263:74:99:g_d0_f8:99:g_d0_f4:F:γd EDUct = γ EDUct, which can be written as γct. 
11:346:26999:0:22:72:487:709:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:good reason to believe that failure to control for those variables is unlikely to result in 
11:347:27091:22:21:72:534:687:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:overestimation of the magnitudes of β0-11 and β12+; exclusion of those variables may even result 
11:348:27188:21:21:72:534:666:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:in underestimation of the magnitudes of those parameters.  Higher disease incidence is likely to 
11:349:27285:21:21:72:434:645:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:result in both higher disease burden and a larger number of drug launches:

11:355:27545:21:21:72:518:521:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:found “economically significant and relatively robust effects of market size on innovation.”  
11:356:27639:21:20:72:527:500:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f5:B:Danzon et al [27] found that “countries with lower expected prices or smaller expected market 
11:357:27733:20:21:72:522:480:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:B:size experience longer delays in new drug access, controlling for per capita income and other

11:359:27881:21:21:72:523:438:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B: Although incidence data are not available for most diseases, annual incidence data for 
11:360:27968:21:20:72:518:417:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Canada during the period 1992-2010 are available for 31 cancer sites (breast, lung, etc.).  As 
11:361:28063:20:21:72:513:397:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:expected, there is a significant positive correlation across cancer sites between ln(CASESst) 
11:362:28157:21:21:72:542:376:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:(where CASESst = the number of Canadian patients diagnosed with cancer at cancer site s in year

11:364:28338:20:22:71:537:335:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:cancer at site s that had ever been launched in Canada by the end of year t).  But estimates of the 
11:365:28438:22:21:71:514:313:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:equation ln(CUM_DRUGst) = π ln(CASESst) + αs + δst + εst indicate that the growth rate of

11:367:28614:22:21:72:523:270:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:suggests that estimates of β0-11 and β12+ in eq. (1) are unlikely to be biased by the omission of 
11:368:28712:21:21:72:202:249:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:incidence in that equation.

11:371:28918:21:21:72:522:187:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:of the effect of pharmaceutical innovation on the burden of disease, for two reasons.  First, as 
11:372:29015:21:20:72:495:166:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:noted earlier, 88% of privately-funded U.S. funding for biomedical research came from 
11:373:29101:20:36:72:527:146:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms [11].15  Second, previous research based on U.S. data

11:375:29251:9:16:72:507:101:42:g_d0_f7:99:g_d0_f4:F:15 Much of the rest came from the federal government (i.e. the NIH), and new drugs often build on upstream 
11:376:29357:16:11:71:522:85:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:government research [28].  The National Cancer Institute [29] says that it “has played a vital role in cancer drug

14:464:35338:21:21:71:522:374:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:inversely related to the number of drugs for that disease that were previously launched in that

14:466:35524:22:21:71:511:331:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:than the magnitude of the ∆LAUNCHES_0_11 coefficient.  The chi-square statistic and its

14:468:35712:21:21:71:523:289:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:of equality of the two coefficients is strongly rejected (p-value = 0.012).  One additional drug

15:499:38479:21:20:72:531:307:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:several different ways.  It may signify that patients benefit from having multiple drugs within a

16:514:39574:22:21:108:514:666:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Now we will use the estimates of β0-11 and β12+ in models 1-3 in Table 2 to calculate 
16:515:39660:21:21:72:538:645:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:several important measures: (1) the number of life-years saved (i.e., the reduction in years of life 
16:516:39761:21:20:71:527:624:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:lost) before ages 85, 70, and 55 in 2013 by new drugs launched after 1981; (2) pharmaceutical 
16:517:39855:20:21:71:538:604:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:expenditure per life-year saved before age 85 in 2013 by new drugs launched after 1981; and (3) 
16:518:39951:21:21:71:418:583:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the 2000-2013 decline in YLL rates attributable to new drug launches.   
16:519:40022:21:21:107:537:562:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A: The first set of calculations is shown in Table 3.  Calculation of the number of life-years 
16:520:40115:21:22:71:510:541:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:saved before age 85 is shown in rows 1-3.  The mean reduction (which we denote by Φ) in 
16:521:40203:22:22:71:431:519:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:ln(YLL85) in 2013 attributable to drugs launched after 1981 is Φ = β0-11 * 
16:522:40276:22:22:72:541:497:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:mean(LAUNCHES_0_11dc,2013) + β12+ * mean (LAUNCHES_GE_12dc,2013).  The estimated ratio 
16:523:40363:22:22:72:533:475:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:of YLL85 in the absence of new drugs to actual YLL = 1 / exp(Φ).  The estimates imply that, if 
16:524:40458:22:20:72:539:453:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:no new drugs had been launched after 1981, YLL85 in 2013 would have been 2.16 times as high 
16:525:40550:20:21:72:528:433:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:as it actually was.  Actual total YLL85 in a subset of 22 countries (listed in Table 4) for which 
16:526:40648:21:21:72:525:412:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:complete 2013 pharmaceutical expenditure data are available was 128.1 million.23  Therefore, 
16:527:40741:21:20:72:528:391:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the estimates imply that, if no new drugs had been launched after 1981, YLL85 in 2013 would 
16:528:40833:20:21:72:522:371:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:have been 276.8 million, and that the number of life-years before age 85 gained in 2013 from 
16:529:40926:21:21:72:298:350:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:drugs launched after 1981 was 148.7 million.   
16:530:40973:21:20:108:532:329:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Calculations of the number of life-years saved before ages 70 and 55 are shown in rows 
16:531:41060:20:21:72:532:309:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:4-  6 and 7-9, respectively, of Table 3.  The estimated ratios of YLL in the absence of new drugs 
16:532:41158:21:21:72:523:288:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:to actual YLL are higher (2.45 and 2.83, respectively) for the lower YLL age thresholds.  We 
16:533:41251:21:21:72:516:267:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:estimate that drugs launched after 1981 saved 82.6 million life years before age 70 and 44.9 
16:534:41344:21:20:72:349:246:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:million life-years before age 55 in 22 countries in 2013.   
16:535:41404:20:21:108:528:226:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:The figures in Table 3 indicate that 79% of the life-years saved before ages 85, 70, and 
16:536:41493:21:21:72:543:205:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:55 in 2013 by new drugs launched after 1981 were saved by drugs that were launched 12 or more 
16:537:41587:21:20:72:530:184:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:years before (i.e. during 1982-2001).  Most of those drugs probably faced generic competition: 
16:538:41682:20:21:72:536:164:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Danzon and Furukawa [35, Figure 2] showed that, in 10 countries, (unweighted) mean molecule 
16:539:41774:21:45:72:525:143:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:age at generic entry was 10.2 years.  Duflos and Lichtenberg [36]   showed that in the US, the 
16:540:41869:45:9:72:217:98:122:g_d0_f7:122:g_d0_f7:F:                                                           
16:541:41927:9:15:72:541:89:42:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:23 For the year 2000, the WHO Global Health Estimates figure for YLL (based on an age threshold of 91.93 years) is 
16:542:42042:15:0:72:174:74:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:63% higher than YLL85. 
17:543:42067:0:21:72:537:709:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:average price of a drug 17 years after it was launched is 61% lower than the average price of the 
17:544:42165:21:21:72:246:688:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:drug 12 years after it was launched. 
17:545:42201:21:20:108:519:667:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:For all three YLL age thresholds, the share of the 2013 YLL reduction attributable to 
17:546:42287:20:21:72:541:647:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:drugs launched fewer than 12 years before (i.e., during 2002-2013) is 21%.  This share is slightly 
17:547:42386:21:21:71:521:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:(17%) higher than the ratio (18%) of the number of standard units (“number of pills”) sold in 
17:548:42480:21:21:71:535:605:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:2013 of drugs launched during 2002-2013 to the number of standard units sold in 2013 of drugs 
17:549:42574:21:20:71:542:584:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:launched during 1982-2013.  The fact that the fraction of life-years saved by more recent drugs is 
17:550:42673:20:21:71:528:564:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:larger than their fraction of drug volume is consistent with the hypothesis discussed above that 
17:551:42770:21:21:71:516:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the average quality of new drugs is superior to the average quality of older drugs, especially 
17:552:42865:21:20:71:462:522:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:when we consider the likelihood of a lag from drug utilization to YLL reduction. 
17:553:42946:20:21:107:517:502:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Now we will calculate an estimate of pharmaceutical expenditure per life-year saved 
17:554:43030:21:21:71:531:481:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:before age 85 in 2013 by new drugs launched after 1981.  Data on pharmaceutical expenditure, 
17:555:43123:21:20:71:535:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:by country, are shown in Table 4.  The first column of figures shows 2013 expenditure on drugs 
17:556:43218:20:21:71:542:440:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:launched after 1981, derived from the IQVIA MIDAS database.  The second column shows 2013 
17:557:43308:21:21:71:533:419:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:expenditure on all drugs, derived from the same source.  Post-1981 drugs accounted for 54% (= 
17:558:43402:21:21:71:525:398:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:$346 b. / $638 b.) of total drug expenditure.  An estimate of total expenditure in 2014 from an 
17:559:43498:21:20:71:539:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:alternative source [37] is 22% (= ($778 b. / $638 b.) – 1) higher than the IQVIA estimate of total 
17:560:43597:20:21:71:537:357:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:expenditure in 2013.  We will use the higher (IFPMA) estimate of total expenditure, and assume 
17:561:43692:21:21:71:522:336:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:that 54% of that expenditure was on post-1981 drugs, so our estimate of 2013 expenditure on 
17:562:43784:21:20:71:539:315:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:post-1981 drugs was $421.8 billion (= 54% * $778 billion).  As shown in Table 3, the number of 
17:563:43879:20:21:71:536:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:life-years before age 85 gained in 2013 from post-1981 drugs was 148.7 million, so we estimate 
17:564:43974:21:21:71:524:274:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:that pharmaceutical expenditure per life-year saved before age 85 in 2013 by post-1981 drugs 
17:565:44067:21:20:71:291:253:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:was $2837 (= $421.8 billion / 148.7 million). 
17:566:44113:20:21:107:504:233:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f5:A:As noted by Bertram et al [38  ], authors writing on behalf of the WHO’s Choosing 
17:567:44195:21:21:71:486:212:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:B:Interventions that are Cost–Effective project (WHO-CHOICE) suggested in 2005 that 
17:568:44277:21:21:71:531:191:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:“interventions that avert one DALY for less than average per capita income for a given country 
17:569:44372:21:20:71:538:170:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:or region are considered very cost–effective; interventions that cost less than three times average 
17:570:44472:20:30:71:506:150:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:per capita income per DALY averted are still considered cost–effective.”24  Weighted (by 
17:571:44561:30:8:72:217:120:122:g_d0_f7:122:g_d0_f7:F:                                                           
17:572:44619:8:15:72:537:112:42:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:24 Other authorities use reasonably similar cost-effectiveness thresholds.  The U.K. National Institute for Health and 
17:573:44738:15:12:71:529:97:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:Care Excellence [39] says that, "in general, interventions with an ICER [Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio] of 
17:574:44852:12:11:71:534:85:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:less than £20,000 per QALY gained are considered to be cost effective."  The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs 
17:575:44965:11:0:71:536:74:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:Health Economics Resource Center [40] says that “a cost-effectiveness analysis may indicate that Drug A is a good

18:577:45176:21:21:72:363:688:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:drugs launched after 1981 were very cost–effective, overall. 
18:578:45236:21:20:108:533:667:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Several considerations suggest that $2837 may be an overestimate of the true net cost in 
18:579:45325:20:24:72:538:647:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:2013 per life-year saved of post-1981 drugs.  First, that estimate is  based on drug cost measured 
18:580:45424:24:23:72:537:623:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:at invoice price levels; rebates and discounts are not reflected.25  Second, a previous study based 
18:581:45524:23:21:71:488:600:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:on U.S. data [42] showed that about 25% of the cost of new drugs is offset by reduced 
18:582:45610:21:20:71:212:579:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:expenditure on old drugs.26   
18:583:45640:20:21:108:508:559:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:The last calculation we will perform will be of the 2000-2013 decline in YLL rates 
18:584:45723:21:21:71:532:538:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:attributable to new drug launches.  This calculation is similar to the ones in Table 3, but instead 
18:585:45823:21:20:71:508:517:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:of the 2013 levels of LAUNCHES_0_11 and LAUNCHES_GE_12, we use the 2000-2013 
18:586:45900:20:22:72:540:497:144:g_d0_f5:144:g_d0_f4:B:changes in those variables.  The estimated drug-launch-induced 2000-2013 log change in YLL is 
18:587:45994:22:22:71:517:475:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:(β0-11 * mean(∆LAUNCHES_0_11) + β12+ * mean (∆LAUNCHES_GE_12)).  The weighted 
18:588:46072:22:21:72:514:453:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:mean values of ∆LAUNCHES_0_11 and ∆LAUNCHES_GE_12 were about -3.627 and 9.4, 
18:589:46149:21:21:72:536:432:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:respectively.  Consequently, the estimated log change in YLL85 was -0.417, i.e. post-1981 drug 
18:590:46244:21:21:72:525:411:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:launches are estimated to have reduced YLL85 by 34% (= 1 – exp(-0.417)) between 2000 and 
18:591:46333:21:20:72:501:390:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:2013.  This is larger than the actual 2000-2013 reduction in YLL85: 23%.  Similarly, the 
18:592:46422:20:21:71:528:370:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:estimated 2000-2013 reductions in YLL70 and YLL55 (39% and 42%, respectively) are larger 
18:593:46511:21:21:71:278:349:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:than the actual (24% and 28%) reductions. 
18:594:46553:21:20:107:521:328:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:One possible explanation for the finding that the estimated drug-launch-induced YLL 
18:595:46637:20:21:71:504:308:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:declines were larger than the actual declines is that trends in other factors were increasing 
18:596:46731:21:21:71:497:287:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:mortality.  As noted above, the global prevalence of diabetes and obesity have increased 
18:597:46820:21:20:71:527:266:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:sharply.28  Another possible explanation is that mortality-increasing between-disease spillover 
18:598:46916:20:21:72:528:246:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:effects (e.g. cardiovascular drug launches might increase cancer mortality) outweigh mortality-
18:599:47011:21:21:72:501:225:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:reducing spillover effects (e.g. mental health drug launches might reduce c ardiovascular 
18:600:47101:21:37:72:529:204:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:mortality).  But even if the number of life-years saved in 2013 was 33% or 50% lower than the 
18:601:47195:37:12:72:217:167:122:g_d0_f7:122:g_d0_f7:F:                                                           
18:602:47253:12:11:72:514:155:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:value relative to Drug B, because it has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $40,000 per Quality-
18:603:47364:11:8:72:159:144:99:g_d0_f4:122:g_d0_f4:F:Adjusted Life Year.” 
18:604:47384:8:13:72:398:136:42:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:25 In the U.S. in 2014, rebates reduced total brand name drug cost by 17.5% [41]. 
18:605:47465:13:11:72:506:123:42:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:26 That study also demonstrated that pharmaceutical innovation has reduced work-loss and school-loss days. 
18:606:47571:11:12:72:406:112:42:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:27 There were fewer launches during 2002-2013 than there were during 1989-2000. 
18:607:47650:12:15:72:515:100:42:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:28 However, another behavioral risk factor—smoking—has been declining.  For example, smoking prevalence 
18:608:47754:15:11:71:314:85:99:g_d0_f4:99:g_d0_f4:F:among men declined from 44.2% in 2000 to 36.1% in 2013.

19:610:47863:0:21:72:539:709:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:calculations in Table 3 (which do not account for between-disease spillover effects) indicate, our 
19:611:47962:21:21:72:498:688:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:estimates imply that drugs launched since 1982 have been highly cost-effective, overall.

19:613:48050:21:20:72:161:646:144:g_d0_f3:144:g_d0_f3:C:VI. Summary 
19:614:48060:20:21:71:74:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B: 
19:615:48060:21:21:107:537:605:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:We have performed an econometric analysis of the role that pharmaceutical innovation—
19:616:48145:21:20:72:527:584:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the introduction and use of new drugs—has played in reducing the number of years of life lost 
19:617:48239:20:21:72:512:564:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:(YLL) before 3 different ages (85, 70, and 55) due to 66 diseases in 27 countries.  We used 
19:618:48331:21:21:72:532:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:“three-dimensional” data on both the number of drug launches and the premature mortality rate 
19:619:48424:21:20:72:540:522:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:by country, disease, and year, to estimate 2-way fixed-effects models of the rate of decline of the 
19:620:48524:20:21:72:538:502:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:disease- and country-specific age-standardized premature mortality rate.   The models controlled 
19:621:48620:21:21:72:535:481:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:for the average (across diseases) decline in the premature mortality rate in each country, and the 
19:622:48719:21:20:72:506:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:average (across countries) decline in the premature mortality rate from each disease.  This 
19:623:48811:20:21:72:530:440:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:approach was feasible because the relative number of drugs launched for different diseases has 
19:624:48906:21:21:72:258:419:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:varied considerably across countries.   
19:625:48945:21:21:108:502:398:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:This study is subject to a number of limitations.  Our measures of pharmaceutical 
19:626:49027:21:20:72:542:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:innovation (the number of drugs and drug classes launched in a country) are imperfect.  Our drug 
19:627:49124:20:21:72:496:357:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:launch data are left-censored: only drugs launched anywhere in the world after 1981 are 
19:628:49212:21:21:72:531:336:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:captured.  Off-label use of drugs is not accounted for.  Our drug indications data were obtained 
19:629:49309:21:20:72:530:315:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:from a French database, and some drugs launched in other countries have not been launched in 
19:630:49402:20:21:72:537:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:France.  Our estimates provide evidence about the impact of the launch of drugs for a disease on 
19:631:49499:21:21:72:529:274:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the burden of that disease, but they do not capture possible spillover effects of the drugs on the 
19:632:49598:21:20:72:516:253:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:burden of other diseases.  Also, our estimates control for the effects on YLL of changes in a 
19:633:49692:20:21:72:520:233:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:country’s health system and macroeconomic conditions, to the extent that those effects don’t 
19:634:49785:21:21:72:390:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:vary across diseases, but those effects might vary across diseases. 
19:635:49852:21:21:108:540:191:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Premature (before age 85) mortality from a disease in a country is inversely related to the 
19:636:49944:21:20:72:534:170:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:number of drugs for that disease that were previously launched in that country, ceteris paribus.  
19:637:50042:20:21:72:534:150:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:One additional drug launch 0-11 years before year t is estimated to have reduced the pre-age-85 
19:638:50138:21:21:72:523:129:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:YLL rate (YLL85) in year t by 3.0%, and one additional drug launch 12 or more years before 
19:639:50229:21:0:72:503:108:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:year t is estimated to have reduced YLL85 by 5.5%.  The larger estimated effect of drugs 
20:640:50321:0:21:72:524:709:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:launched 12 or more years before year t is not surprising, considering the gradual diffusion of 
20:641:50417:21:21:72:442:688:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:new drugs and the likelihood of a lag from utilization to mortality reduction. 
20:642:50496:21:20:108:530:667:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:When lower YLL age thresholds are used, the estimates are qualitatively similar to, but 
20:643:50584:20:21:72:526:647:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:larger in magnitude than, the YLL85 estimates.  One additional drug launch 0-11 years before 
20:644:50677:21:21:72:536:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:year t is estimated to have reduced the pre-age-55 YLL rate (YLL55) in year t by 4.3%, and one 
20:645:50772:21:21:71:522:605:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:additional drug launch 12 or more years before year t is estimated to have reduced YLL55 by 
20:646:50864:21:20:71:108:584:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:7.3%.   
20:647:50872:20:21:107:533:564:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Controlling for the number of drugs previously launched, YLL rates are unrelated to the 
20:648:50960:21:21:71:298:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:number of drug classes previously launched.    
20:649:51006:21:20:107:520:522:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:We used the estimates to calculate several important measures: (1) the number of life-
20:650:51092:20:21:71:524:502:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:years saved (i.e., the reduction in years of life lost) before ages 85, 70, and 55 in 2013 by new 
20:651:51190:21:21:71:529:481:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:drugs launched after 1981; (2) pharmaceutical expenditure per life-year saved before age 85 in 
20:652:51285:21:20:71:537:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:2013 by new drugs launched after 1981; and (3) the 2000-2013 decline in YLL rates attributable 
20:653:51380:20:21:71:186:440:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:to new drug launches.   
20:654:51403:21:21:107:516:419:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:The estimates implied that, if no new drugs had been launched after 1981, YLL85 in 
20:655:51486:21:21:71:517:398:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:2013 would have been 2.16 times as high as it actually was.  For a subset of 22 countries for 
20:656:51580:21:20:71:509:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:which complete 2013 pharmaceutical expenditure data are available, we estimated that the 
20:657:51669:20:21:71:521:357:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:number of life-years before age 85 gained in 2013 from drugs launched after 1981 was 148.7 
20:658:51760:21:21:71:528:336:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:million.  We also estimated that drugs launched after 1981 saved 82.6 million life years before 
20:659:51856:21:20:71:427:315:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:age 70 and 44.9 million life-years before age 55 in 22 countries in 2013.   
20:660:51932:20:21:107:535:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:The fraction of life-years saved by more recent drugs is slightly larger than their fraction 
20:661:52025:21:21:71:534:274:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:of drug volume, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the average quality of new drugs is 
20:662:52122:21:20:71:294:253:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:superior to the average quality of older drugs. 
20:663:52169:20:21:107:532:233:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:We estimated that pharmaceutical expenditure per life-year saved before age 85 in 2013 
20:664:52256:21:21:71:533:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:by post-1981 drugs was $2837.  This amount is about 8% of per capita GDP, so these estimates 
20:665:52349:21:21:71:465:191:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:indicate that the new drugs launched after 1981 were very cost–effective, overall. 
20:666:52431:21:20:107:532:170:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:Post-1981 drug launches were estimated to have reduced YLL85 by 34% between 2000 
20:667:52512:20:21:71:525:150:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:and 2013, which is larger than the actual 2000-2013 reduction in YLL85: 23%.  Similarly, the 
20:668:52605:21:21:71:537:129:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:estimated 2000-2013 reductions in YLL70 and YLL55 (39% and 42%, respectively) were larger 
20:669:52695:21:20:72:517:108:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:than the actual (24% and 28%) reductions.  One possible explanation for the finding that the 
20:670:52788:20:0:72:541:88:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:estimated drug-launch-induced YLL declines were larger than the actual declines is that trends in 
21:671:52889:0:21:72:534:709:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:other factors (e.g. diabetes and obesity prevalence) were increasing mortality.  Another possible 
21:672:52987:21:21:72:522:688:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:explanation is that mortality-increasing between-disease spillover effects (e.g. cardiovascular 
21:673:53083:21:20:72:521:667:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:drug launches might increase cancer mortality) outweigh mortality-reducing spillover effects 
21:674:53176:20:21:72:504:647:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:(e.g. mental health drug launches might reduce cardiovascular mortality).  But even if the 
21:675:53267:21:21:72:511:626:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:number of life-years saved in 2013 was 33% or 50% lower than the amount implied by our 
21:676:53354:21:21:72:523:605:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:estimates (which do not account for between-disease spillover effects), the evidence indicates 
21:677:53449:21:20:72:419:584:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:that drugs launched since 1982 have been highly cost-effective, overall. 
21:678:53521:20:21:108:528:564:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:As several scholars have pointed out, the fact that an intervention is cost-effective does 
21:679:53612:21:21:72:538:543:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:not necessarily mean that it is “affordable.”  Sendi and Briggs [43]   argued that “decision-makers 
21:680:53712:21:20:71:476:522:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:are constrained by a fixed-budget and may not be able to fund new, more expensive 
21:681:53794:20:21:71:535:502:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:interventions, even if they have been shown to represent good value for money.”  In response to 
21:682:53890:21:21:71:523:481:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:this limitation, those authors introduced the 'affordability curve' which reflects the probability 
21:683:53989:21:20:71:520:460:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:that a program is affordable for a wide range of threshold budgets. They argued that the joint 
21:684:54084:20:21:71:507:440:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:probability that an intervention is affordable and cost-effective is more useful for decision-
21:685:54178:21:21:71:536:419:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:making since it captures both dimensions of the decision problem faced by those responsible for 
21:686:54274:21:21:71:503:398:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:health service budgets.  In a similar vein, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Health 
21:687:54365:21:20:71:513:377:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:Economics Resource Center argues that in addition to a cost-effectiveness analysis—which 
21:688:54454:20:21:71:534:357:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:evaluates whether an intervention provides value relative to an existing intervention (with value 
21:689:54552:21:21:71:517:336:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:defined as cost relative to health outcome)—it may be necessary to conduct a budget impact 
21:690:54643:21:20:71:538:315:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:analysis.  That analysis estimates the financial consequences of adopting a new intervention, and 
21:691:54741:20:21:71:366:295:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:evaluates whether the high-value intervention is affordable.   
21:692:54803:21:21:107:539:274:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:A:We estimated the impact on the 2013 pharmaceutical budget—$421.8 billion—as well as 
21:693:54887:21:20:71:496:253:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:the average cost-effectiveness of the drugs that were launched since 1982.  Presumably, 
21:694:54975:20:21:71:517:233:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:decision-makers considered those drugs to be “affordable.”  However, as shown in Figure 1, 
21:695:55066:21:21:71:528:212:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:many potential drug launches did not occur, perhaps because decision-makers did not consider 
21:696:55159:21:29:71:324:191:144:g_d0_f4:144:g_d0_f4:B:those drugs to be both cost-effective and affordable.
