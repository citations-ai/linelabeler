3:38:1823:0:27:127:487:708:144:Times:144:Times:The Nixon Shock after Forty Years:  The Import Surcharge Revisited 
3:39:1890:27:28:306:309:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: 
3:40:1890:28:27:72:158:653:144:Times:144:g_d0_f2:1. Introduction 
3:41:1904:27:28:108:515:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: Forty years ago, on August 15, 1971, President Richard Nixon stunned the world by 
3:42:1986:28:28:72:508:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:closing the gold window (ending the ability of foreign central banks to convert their dollar 
3:43:2079:28:27:72:538:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:holdings into gold) and slapping a 10 percent surcharge on imported goods.  These policies were 
3:44:2175:27:28:72:536:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:designed to prevent a run on U.S. gold reserves and reverse the deterioration in the U.S. balance 
3:45:2273:28:27:72:483:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of payments by getting other countries to revalue their currencies, as well as head off 
3:46:2361:27:28:72:530:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:protectionist pressures in Congress.  Together with wage and price controls to reduce inflation, 
3:47:2458:28:28:72:367:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:these surprise actions became known as the “Nixon shock.”   
3:48:2518:28:27:108:523:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: The closing of the gold window is notable for ending a defining feature of the Bretton 
3:49:2605:27:28:72:540:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Woods system of fixed exchange rates (Bordo and Eichengreen 1993).  However, relatively little 
3:50:2700:28:27:72:512:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:attention has been paid to the 10 percent import surcharge, despite the fact that it was a key 
3:51:2795:27:28:72:522:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:element of the package.  The purpose of the surcharge was to force other countries to revalue 
3:52:2889:28:27:72:523:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:their currencies against the dollar, which was widely thought to have been overvalued against 
3:53:2983:27:28:72:528:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:other major currencies.  Administration officials believed that simply closing the gold window 
3:54:3078:28:28:72:512:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:alone would not have induced other countries to agree to a revaluation.  As it turned out, in 
3:55:3172:28:27:72:534:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:December 1971, four months after the surcharge was imposed, the Smithsonian Agreement was 
3:56:3262:27:28:72:503:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:reached, which revalued major currencies and allowed the import surcharge to be lifted.   
3:57:3352:28:27:108:503:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: While short-lived, the import surcharge constituted a unique, unanticipated policy 
3:58:3435:27:28:72:540:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:experiment in which the United States imposed an immediate, across-the-board tariff on dutiable 
3:59:3531:28:0:72:516:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:imports – the first general tariff increase since the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930.  This paper 
4:60:3628:0:27:72:537:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:reviews the decision-making process behind the surcharge, its impact on U.S. imports, its role in 
4:61:3726:27:28:72:546:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:bringing about the revaluation of foreign currencies, and the legal issues raised by its imposition.   
4:62:3829:28:27:108:536:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: This episode is not just of historical interest, but also has some contemporary relevance.  
4:63:3921:27:28:72:485:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In recent years, many observers have complained about China’s efforts to prevent the 
4:64:4006:28:28:72:533:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:appreciation of the foreign exchange value of the renminbi, the evidence for which includes the 
4:65:4102:28:27:72:541:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:country’s accumulation of more than a trillion dollars worth of dollar-denominated reserve assets 
4:66:4200:27:28:72:496:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:(Goldstein and Lardy 2008).  Like the early 1970s, the failure to allow an exchange rate 
4:67:4289:28:27:72:517:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:adjustment in the face of a large bilateral imbalance has led to calls in Congress for punitive 
4:68:4385:27:28:72:524:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:trade sanctions against China, including proposals for an import surcharge of as much as 27.5 
4:69:4479:28:28:71:520:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:percent, unless the renminbi is revalued.  The 1971 episode may offer some useful lessons in 
4:70:4572:28:27:71:521:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:understanding the interaction between exchange rate adjustments and protectionist pressures.

4:72:4665:28:27:71:290:377:144:Times:144:Times:2.  The Decision to Impose the Surcharge 
4:73:4705:27:28:107:513:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: The decision to close the gold window, and thereby end a key feature of the Bretton 
4:74:4789:28:27:71:540:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Woods system, was made over a weekend at Camp David by President Nixon and his advisers in 
4:75:4880:27:28:71:525:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:August 1971.  However, the deterioration of the U.S. balance of payments position during the 
4:76:4973:28:28:71:523:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:1960s meant that pressure to take such a step had been building for many years.  The surprise 
4:77:5067:28:27:71:528:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:imposition of the import surcharge was a tactical measure designed to force America’s trading 
4:78:5161:27:28:71:490:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:partners to revalue their currencies, something that many of them were reluctant to do. 
4:79:5249:28:27:71:133:184:144:Times:144:Times:Background 
4:80:5259:27:28:107:537:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: Under the Bretton Woods system of fixed (but adjustable) exchange rates, the dollar was 
4:81:5347:28:28:71:505:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the world’s key reserve currency, backed by American gold reserves.  The U.S. payments 
4:82:5434:28:0:71:529:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:deficits of the 1950s were welcomed as a way of relieving the dollar shortage that existed after 
5:83:5533:0:27:72:528:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:World War II.  By the 1960s, however, the dollar shortage had given way to a dollar glut.  The 
5:84:5628:27:28:72:537:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:growing overhang of dollars meant that by the late 1960s foreign holdings of dollars (nearly $50 
5:85:5725:28:27:72:518:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:billion) far outstripped U.S. gold reserves (about $10 billion).  There was simply no way the 
5:86:5819:27:28:72:536:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:United States could ever meet its obligation to exchange gold for dollars if foreign central banks 
5:87:5918:28:28:72:526:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:started demanded gold for all their dollar reserves, a realization of the Triffin dilemma (Bordo 
5:88:6015:28:27:72:288:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and Eichengreen 1993, Eichengreen 2000).   
5:89:6058:27:28:108:493:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: The United States had limited policy options to address the situation.  The most 
5:90:6139:28:27:72:510:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:straightforward way of addressing the payments imbalance was through a tighter monetary 
5:91:6227:27:28:72:524:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:policy and higher interest rates.  This would reduce the price of U.S. goods compared to other 
5:92:6322:28:28:72:521:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:countries and slow the export of capital from the United States.  Yet the Federal Reserve was 
5:93:6416:28:27:72:529:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:reluctant to do this for fear of starting a recession (Meltzer 2009).1   Instead, some half-hearted 
5:94:6516:27:28:72:540:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:measures were taken to reduce capital outflows in the 1960s, such as the interest equalization tax 
5:95:6615:28:27:72:512:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:on foreign bonds sold in the United States, but these were far from sufficient to address the 
5:96:6709:27:28:72:288:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:fundamental problem (Eichengreen 2000).    
5:97:6752:28:27:108:535:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Another potential solution to the growing concerns over the balance of payments was an 
5:98:6839:27:28:71:522:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:exchange rate adjustment.  This was not an option that the United States could exercise on its 
5:99:6934:28:28:71:522:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:own.  Because the dollar was the world’s reserve currency and the anchor of the international 
5:100:7028:28:27:71:539:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:monetary system, other countries could revalue or devalue their currencies against the dollar, but 
5:101:7127:27:28:71:529:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the United States could not devalue the dollar against other currencies.  Yet other countries did 
5:102:7225:28:27:71:531:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:not want to jeopardize the competitive position of their export industries, and therefore most of 
5:103:7323:27:28:71:504:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:them were very reluctant to revalue their currencies.  The United States could unilaterally 
5:104:7415:28:20:71:521:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:devalue the dollar in terms of gold (i.e., raise the dollar price of gold), but American officials 
5:105:7514:20:8:216:219:109:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                 
5:106:7562:8:16:72:521:101:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:1 In the early 1970s, Nixon made it even more difficult to maintain the value of the dollar by pressuring Federal 
5:107:7676:16:11:71:529:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Reserve chairman Arthur Burns to adopt an easier monetary policy, hoping that this would stimulate the economy 
5:108:7787:11:0:71:208:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:and ensure his reelection in 1972. 
6:109:7824:0:27:72:486:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:were opposed to doing this because of the perceived loss of prestige associated with a 
6:110:7911:27:28:72:523:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:“devaluation” of the dollar.  In addition, it was thought that other countries would respond by 
6:111:8007:28:27:72:527:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:simply devaluing their currencies against gold by the same amount, leaving bilateral exchange 
6:112:8101:27:28:72:162:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:rates unchanged.   
6:113:8120:28:28:108:530:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: The rekindling of long dormant protectionist pressures was also closely associated with 
6:114:8208:28:27:72:526:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the balance of payments difficulties besetting the United States in the late 1960s.  The gradual 
6:115:8305:27:28:72:517:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:erosion of the U.S. merchandise trade surplus in the late 1960s created problems for specific 
6:116:8399:28:27:71:525:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:industries and was widely viewed as evidence that the dollar had become overvalued.  By this 
6:117:8492:27:28:71:527:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:time European and Japanese manufacturers had also largely recovered from the devastation of 
6:118:8584:28:28:71:538:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:World War II and began to pose a serious competitive threat to some major U.S. industries.  The 
6:119:8680:28:27:71:541:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:intensification of foreign competition led to growing protectionist pressures in the United States.  
6:120:8781:27:28:71:533:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In 1962, the United States limited imports of cotton textiles from Japan through the Long-Term 
6:121:8876:28:27:71:500:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Arrangement on Cotton Textiles.  In 1969, the United States negotiated voluntary export 
6:122:8964:27:28:71:474:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:restraints with European countries to limit their exports of iron and steel products.   
6:123:9052:28:27:107:530:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: Congress was soon awash with proposals to limit imports even further.  In 1970, House 
6:124:9138:27:28:71:517:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Ways and Means Committee chairman Wilbur Mills proposed imposing quotas on imported 
6:125:9222:28:28:72:538:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:clothing and footwear from Japan.  The measure proved so popular that the Committee amended 
6:126:9314:28:27:72:529:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:this proposal to add mandatory quotas on every imported good whose share of the U.S. market 
6:127:9406:27:28:72:518:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:exceeded 15 percent.  The House eventually reverted back to the original Mills proposal and 
6:128:9498:28:27:72:454:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:passed it, but Congress recessed before the Senate could take up the proposal.   
6:129:9579:27:28:108:509:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: In 1971, an even more controversial piece of legislation was considered, the Burke-
6:130:9662:28:28:72:542:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Hartke bill, named for its legislative sponsors, Rep. James Burke (D-MA) and Sen. Vance Hartke 
6:131:9757:28:0:72:537:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:(D-IL), and strongly supported by organized labor.  The key provision of Burke-Hartke was that 
7:132:9854:0:27:72:541:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the quantity of imports in 1972, by product category and by country, was mandated not to exceed 
7:133:9950:27:28:72:507:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the average quantity of imports during 1965 to 1969.  This would effectively roll-back the 
7:134:10041:28:27:72:514:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:volume of imports by about 32 percent and be equivalent to increasing the average tariff on 
7:135:10133:27:28:72:530:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:dutiable imports from 6.8 percent to 19.6 percent (Magee 1972, 692).  Once trade had been cut 
7:136:10227:28:28:72:540:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:back to 1965-69 levels, the ratio of imports to domestic production would not have been allowed 
7:137:10323:28:27:72:520:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to exceed the 1965-69 ratio, effectively freezing import penetration on a product and country 
7:138:10417:27:28:72:536:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:basis. Although the bill was never brought to the House or Senate floor, it sparked a tremendous 
7:139:10514:28:27:72:512:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:debate and was an unmistakable signal of the building domestic pressures to limit imports.  
7:140:10606:27:28:108:506:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: Thus, when the Nixon administration came into office in 1969, the Bretton Woods 
7:141:10686:28:28:72:533:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:exchange rate system and the postwar liberal U.S. trade policy were already under considerable 
7:142:10781:28:27:72:529:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:stress.  The Nixon administration took a mercantilist stance on trade issues for overtly political 
7:143:10880:27:28:72:488:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:reasons.  Their goal was to generate domestic political support and stimulate domestic 
7:144:10967:28:27:72:498:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:employment growth by expanding exports and restricting imports (Matusow 1998).  For 
7:145:11051:27:28:72:524:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:example, as part of the “Southern strategy” in the 1968 presidential election campaign, Nixon 
7:146:11145:28:27:72:534:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:courted South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond.  To win Thurmond’s political support, Nixon 
7:147:11236:27:28:72:508:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:promised further limits on imports of textiles from Japan that competed with domestically-
7:148:11326:28:28:72:260:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:produced cotton textiles in the South.   
7:149:11367:28:27:108:530:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: In addition, the administration focused on export promotion.  Peter Peterson, an adviser 
7:150:11456:27:28:72:537:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:on international economic policy in the White House, focused attention on U.S. competitiveness 
7:151:11551:28:27:72:534:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and the number of jobs created by additional exports.  The notion that a lower foreign exchange 
7:152:11647:27:28:72:516:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:value of the dollar could create jobs in traded goods industries, to the political benefit of the 
7:153:11745:28:0:72:386:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:administration, was widely discussed within the administration.   
8:154:11813:0:27:108:536:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: With this trade policy backdrop, and with U.S. gold reserves at increasing risk due to the 
8:155:11904:27:28:72:532:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:growing accumulation of dollars abroad, the Nixon administration began preparing for changes 
8:156:11997:28:27:72:494:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:in the international monetary system.  Paul Volcker, the Undersecretary of Treasury for 
8:157:12085:27:28:72:527:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Monetary Affairs, headed an interagency planning group to prepare for the possible closure of 
8:158:12179:28:28:72:532:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the gold window and other actions to persuade foreign countries to adjust their exchange rates.  
8:159:12276:28:27:72:515:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Although it would constitute a big change in policy, closing the gold window was relatively 
8:160:12368:27:28:72:528:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:straightforward to implement and would immediately end concerns about the loss of U.S. gold 
8:161:12460:28:27:72:532:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:reserves.  However, getting other countries to revalue their currencies to address the underlying 
8:162:12558:27:28:72:519:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:balance of payments problem and ameliorate the growing trade pressures was expected to be 
8:163:12648:28:28:72:536:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:more difficult.  Some officials, such as George Shultz, the director of the Office of Management 
8:164:12745:28:27:72:536:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and Budget, even wanted to abandon the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates entirely 
8:165:12838:27:28:72:301:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and move to a floating exchange rate regime.2   
8:166:12886:28:27:108:496:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: With regard to exchange rates, the United States did not have a problem with all 
8:167:12967:27:28:72:535:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:countries.  Some foreign currencies were chronically weak.  The dollar was not viewed as being 
8:168:13062:28:27:72:542:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:overvalued against the British pound, which had been devalued in November 1967, or the French 
8:169:13156:27:28:72:508:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:franc, which had been devalued in August 1969.  The United States continued to run trade 
8:170:13245:28:28:72:496:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:surpluses with those countries and imports from them did not contribute significantly to 
8:171:13334:28:27:72:536:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:protectionist pressures at home.  Although the United States had a trade deficit with Canada, the 
8:172:13432:27:28:72:535:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Canadian dollar was already floating against the U.S. dollar, making it difficult to complain that 
8:173:13531:28:27:72:276:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the Canadian currency was undervalued.   
8:174:13572:27:28:108:508:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: Instead, the United States focused on Japan and West Germany as countries whose 
8:175:13652:28:32:72:531:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:currencies should be revalued.  Not only did the United States have growing trade deficits with 
8:176:13748:32:7:216:219:97:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                 
8:177:13796:7:16:72:539:90:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:2 Shultz’s support for floating exchange rates originated from his time at the University of Chicago as a colleague of 
8:178:13915:16:0:71:210:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Milton Friedman (Leeson 2002).   
9:179:13950:0:27:72:522:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:both countries, but their exports harmed politically powerful domestic constituencies, textiles 
9:180:14046:27:28:72:519:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and electronics in the case of Japan and iron and steel in the case of Germany.  Because they 
9:181:14140:28:27:71:530:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:feared importing inflation from the United States, West German officials had shown flexibility 
9:182:14235:27:28:71:532:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:with regard to their exchange rate.  In October 1969, they revalued the mark against the dollar.  
9:183:14333:28:28:71:530:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In May 1971, to accommodate the growing demand for the mark on foreign exchange markets, 
9:184:14422:28:27:71:518:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Germany allowed the mark to float against the dollar (James 1996, 214-216).  As it began to 
9:185:14514:27:28:72:525:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:appreciate, other currencies tied to the mark followed.  The Dutch guilder was also allowed to 
9:186:14609:28:27:72:525:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:float against the dollar, and the Swiss franc and the Austrian schilling were revalued as well.   
9:187:14707:27:28:108:518:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: However, Japan adamantly opposed any change in its exchange rate, which had been 
9:188:14788:28:28:72:505:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:established at 360 yen to the dollar in 1949 and had remained there ever since.  Japan was 
9:189:14879:28:27:72:541:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:pursuing an export-led growth model and the government was extremely reluctant to do anything 
9:190:14973:27:28:72:537:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:that might impede the country’s ability to export to the United States.  In mid-1971, as exchange 
9:191:15071:28:27:72:539:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:rate pressures were coming to a head, the government undertook an extensive campaign to avoid 
9:192:15165:27:28:72:521:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:any revaluation of the yen.  The measures included liberalizing its import policy, eliminating 
9:193:15260:28:27:72:539:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:government support for exports, and removing restrictions on foreign investment, all actions that 
9:194:15358:27:28:72:507:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:would depress the yen and increase the chances that the existing parity could be preserved 
9:195:15449:28:28:72:508:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:(Angel 1991, 81ff).  While these steps were welcome, U.S. officials believed they were an 
9:196:15539:28:27:72:497:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:inadequate substitute for a substantial appreciation of the yen.  Therefore, from the U.S. 
9:197:15630:27:28:72:502:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:perspective, Japan was considered to be the major obstacle to achieving an exchange rate 
9:198:15719:28:27:72:198:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:adjustment of the dollar.   
9:199:15747:27:28:108:531:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Several events in the summer of 1971 led to the U.S. decision to close the gold window 
9:200:15834:28:28:72:527:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and impose the import surcharge.  First, the new Treasury Secretary, John Connally, who took 
9:201:15927:28:0:72:539:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:office in February 1971, wanted to end the “benign neglect” of the balance of payments situation 
10:202:16026:0:27:72:533:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and take a more proactive approach.  Connally sought to avoid the embarrassment of facing run 
10:203:16120:27:28:72:518:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:on U.S. gold reserves or being put in the position of having to deny foreign requests for U.S. 
10:204:16215:28:27:72:525:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:gold.  Instead, he wanted the United States to seize the initiative to preempt such an event and 
10:205:16312:27:28:72:536:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:put the burden of adjustment on other countries.  As he famously quipped, “foreigners are out to 
10:206:16409:28:28:72:367:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:screw us, our job is to screw them first” (Odell 1982, 263).3   
10:207:16473:28:27:108:497:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In May 1971, a study completed by staff economists at the Treasury Department 
10:208:16551:27:28:72:532:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:concluded that the dollar was overvalued by 10 to 15 percent and that a foreign-exchange crisis 
10:209:16647:28:27:72:534:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:was inevitable (Odell 1982, 252).  The Treasury staff argued that the United States should “take 
10:210:16744:27:28:72:530:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:advantage of the present crisis to achieve (i) a lasting improvement in the balance-of-payments 
10:211:16840:28:28:72:508:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:position of the United States, (ii) a more equitable sharing of the responsibilities for world 
10:212:16935:28:27:72:523:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:security and economic progress and (iii) a basic reform of the international monetary system” 
10:213:17029:27:28:72:524:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:(FRUS 1969-76, 3: 423).  The memo advocated using “the following measures as negotiating 
10:214:17118:28:27:72:493:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:leverage:  (i) suspension of gold convertibility; (ii) imposition of trade restrictions; (iii) 
10:215:17213:27:28:72:510:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:diplomatic and financial intervention to frustrate foreign activities which interfere with the 
10:216:17308:28:27:72:513:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:attainment of our objectives; and (iv) reduction of the U.S. military presence in Europe and 
10:217:17401:27:28:72:247:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Japan” (FRUS 1969-76, 3: 424-25). 
10:218:17435:28:28:108:529:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:In July 1971, the Williams Commission, which had been appointed by President Nixon 
10:219:17518:28:27:72:535:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the previous year to study the international economic problems facing United States, also issued 
10:220:17615:27:28:72:524:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:a report. Among its recommendations, the report suggested that “[i]f our balance of payments 
10:221:17708:28:27:72:533:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:problem persists, and if other countries find a further accumulation of dollars objectionable, the 
10:222:17807:27:28:72:528:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:United States should indicate its readiness to adopt a temporary uniform import tax and export 
10:223:17902:28:32:72:500:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:subsidy” to promote an exchange rate change.  This statement resurrected the idea (often 
10:224:17991:32:7:216:219:97:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                 
10:225:18039:7:16:72:518:90:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:3 Connally also made the classic remark: “the dollar may be our currency, but it is your problem” (Volcker and 
10:226:18150:16:0:72:152:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Gyohten 1992, 81). 
11:227:18171:0:27:72:496:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:attributed to John Maynard Keynes) that a uniform import tariff and export subsidy was 
11:228:18258:27:28:72:537:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:equivalent to a currency devaluation.  Although a revaluation of foreign currencies was the goal, 
11:229:18356:28:27:72:528:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:if that was not feasible then the subsidy and tariff program “could improve the U.S. balance of 
11:230:18452:27:28:72:528:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:payments with minimum distortion to the United States and the world economy,” according to 
11:231:18543:28:28:71:460:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the report (Committee on International Trade and Investment Policy 1971, 37).   
11:232:18623:28:27:108:531:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Also in July, new data was released showing that the United States ran an unexpectedly 
11:233:18710:27:28:72:542:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:large merchandise trade deficit in June and was on track to have its first annual trade deficit since 
11:234:18812:28:27:72:511:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the nineteenth century.  These data convinced Volcker and other Treasury officials that the 
11:235:18904:27:28:72:530:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:existing dollar parities could not be maintained for much longer.  In line with Connally’s view, 
11:236:19001:28:28:72:537:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:they worked to be prepared to close the gold window at a time of their own choosing rather than 
11:237:19097:28:27:72:430:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:when they would be forced to do so by foreign official requests for gold.   
11:238:19173:27:28:108:511:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:After being briefed on these developments, Connally instructed Volcker to draw up 
11:239:19255:28:27:72:534:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:contingency plans for the closing of the gold window.  In addition, he asked him to look into an 
11:240:19352:27:28:72:526:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:import surcharge as one possible policy action.  Volcker was reluctant to do so and hoped that 
11:241:19447:28:27:72:533:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Connally’s request for higher duties on imports would be forgotten, but it was not (Volcker and 
11:242:19543:27:28:72:505:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Gyohten 1992, 76).  Connally appears to have been the key figure who wanted the import 
11:243:19630:28:28:72:515:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:surcharge as a way of gaining “leverage” against countries that were reluctant to allow their 
11:244:19724:28:27:72:498:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:currencies to appreciate, but the Treasury staff was probably responsible for drawing his 
11:245:19814:27:28:72:148:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:attention to it.   
11:246:19833:28:27:108:528:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:On Monday, August 2, Connally met with President Nixon and agreed on a package of 
11:247:19915:27:28:72:524:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:measures to deal with the international situation, reduce inflation, and shore up the economy.  
11:248:20011:28:28:72:537:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The package included closing the gold window, wage and price controls, and tax cuts.  Connally 
11:249:20106:28:0:72:543:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:proposed coupling the suspension of convertibility with a 10 percent import surcharge that would 
12:250:20206:0:27:72:531:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:remain in effect until new exchange rate parities were negotiated.  From the Oval Office taping 
12:251:20302:27:28:72:525:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:system we know that Nixon liked this idea:  “the import duty delights me,” he said, because it 
12:252:20397:28:27:72:499:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:was a way of striking back against other countries and extracting concessions from them 
12:253:20485:27:28:72:532:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:(Ohlmacher 2009, 9).  However, no formal decision was made at this meeting about whether to 
12:254:20577:28:28:72:519:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:include the surcharge in the final package.  They also discussed when the program should be 
12:255:20669:28:27:71:508:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:unveiled: Nixon proposed holding off until the end of the year, Connally argued for acting 
12:256:20760:27:28:71:540:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:sooner rather than later, and they settled on early September after Congress had returned from its 
12:257:20859:28:27:71:264:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:summer recess (Matusow 1998, 147).    
12:258:20897:27:28:107:534:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Events conspired to accelerate this timetable.  On Friday, August 6, a report by the Joint 
12:259:20988:28:28:71:542:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Economic Committee’s Subcommittee on International Exchange and Payments, chaired by Rep. 
12:260:21078:28:27:71:515:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Henry Reuss (D-WI), reached the “inescapable conclusion” that “the dollar is overvalued.”  
12:261:21169:27:28:71:517:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:(Ironically, the report was entitled “Action Now to Strengthen the U.S. Dollar.”)  The Reuss 
12:262:21262:28:27:71:535:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:report stated that “dollar overvaluation leads to the perpetuation of U.S. [trade] deficits and thus 
12:263:21363:27:28:71:531:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:increases the risk of an international monetary crisis that would break the system apart” (James 
12:264:21460:28:27:71:542:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:1996, 217-18).  However, the report fell short of making specific policy recommendations.4  That 
12:265:21557:27:28:72:524:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:same day, the Treasury announced that it would sell about $200 million in gold to France and 
12:266:21650:28:28:72:541:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:nearly $800 million of foreign exchange to buy back dollars from Belgium and the Netherlands.   
12:267:21746:28:27:108:527:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The Reuss report, along with the other news, contributed the strong selling pressure on 
12:268:21834:27:28:72:534:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the dollar beginning on Monday, August 9.  Over the course of that week, foreign central banks 
12:269:21929:28:27:72:532:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:intervened massively to support the dollar, buying about $3.7 billion to prevent their currencies 
12:270:22027:27:60:72:533:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:from appreciating.  On Tuesday, August 10, Volcker and Shultz met and agreed that the United 
12:271:22120:60:7:216:219:97:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                 
12:272:22168:7:16:72:535:90:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:4 In June 1971, Reuss had introduced a “Sense of the Congress” resolution calling for a closing of the gold window 
12:273:22283:16:0:71:299:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:and a move to floating exchange rates (Angel 1991, 81). 
13:274:22342:0:27:72:536:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:States had to act soon or else foreign central banks might begin demanding gold in exchange for 
13:275:22438:27:28:72:245:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the dollars that they were holding.   
13:276:22476:28:27:108:506:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:On Wednesday, August 11, Connally was called back to Washington from Texas.  
13:277:22553:27:28:72:541:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Meeting with Nixon that day, Shultz endorsed an import surcharge.  He told the president that “if 
13:278:22651:28:28:72:531:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:he were to close the gold window and took no other action, he might not get the needed change 
13:279:22745:28:27:72:538:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:in the exchange rate if others intervened to maintain the value of their currencies.”  Therefore he 
13:280:22845:27:28:72:542:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:“advised that it was better to get the desired change through a devaluation than through an import 
13:281:22944:28:27:72:528:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:tax and suggested an immediate closing of the gold window and a temporary import tax, i.e., a 
13:282:23038:27:28:72:534:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:devaluation, followed by negotiations” (FRUS 1969-76, 3:457).  On Thursday, President Nixon 
13:283:23130:28:28:72:526:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:decided to bring his chief economic advisers to Camp David on Friday afternoon for weekend 
13:284:23221:28:27:72:228:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:meetings to decide what to do.   
13:285:23254:27:28:108:537:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Adding to the growing tension of that week, on Friday morning, Britain requested partial 
13:286:23343:28:27:72:519:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:cover for its dollar holdings in the event that the dollar was devalued.  The exact request was 
13:287:23439:27:28:72:534:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:garbled somewhere along the way and it was reported to administration officials that the British 
13:288:23536:28:27:72:542:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:were seeking to exchange $3 billion for American gold.  This inaccurate interpretation reinforced 
13:289:23634:27:28:72:526:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:fears that there was about to be a run on the U.S. gold stock.  However, the British request did 
13:290:23731:28:28:72:523:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:not trigger the closing of the gold window; the meeting to formalize that decision had already 
13:291:23826:28:27:72:346:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:been set up the day before.  As Paul Volcker has noted:   
13:292:23884:27:28:108:515:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:“One story circulated later that the British request precipitated our decision to go off 
13:293:23973:28:27:108:500:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:gold.  That was not true.  Demand for gold had been building from other, smaller 
13:294:24054:27:28:108:504:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:countries.  The momentum toward the decision was by that time, in my judgment, 
13:295:24133:28:0:108:512:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:unstoppable.  There was, however, a sense in which those last requests for gold and 
14:296:24220:0:27:108:504:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:guarantees were helpful; no one could argue that the United States had reached its 
14:297:24303:27:28:108:381:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:decision frivolously” (Volcker and Gyohten 1992, 77).5  
14:298:24359:28:27:72:136:653:144:Times:144:Times:Camp David 
14:299:24370:27:28:108:501:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: The decision to close the gold window and impose the surcharge was made when 
14:300:24447:28:28:72:534:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:President Nixon spirited his key economic advisers away from Washington for a secret meeting 
14:301:24540:28:27:72:524:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:at Camp David on Friday, August 13, and continuing through that weekend.  The participants 
14:302:24631:27:28:72:523:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:included Treasury Secretary John Connally and Undersecretary Paul Volcker; George Shultz, 
14:303:24721:28:27:72:514:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:director of the Office of Management and Budget, and his colleague Kenneth Dam; Federal 
14:304:24809:27:28:72:533:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Reserve chairman Arthur Burns; Council of Economic Advisers chairman Paul McCracken and 
14:305:24897:28:28:72:515:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:CEA member Herbert Stein; Peter Peterson, head of the Council on International Economic 
14:306:24985:28:27:72:527:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Policy; speechwriter William Safire, and others, including Caspar Weinberger.  Not only were 
14:307:25078:27:28:72:540:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:officials from the State Department and the National Security Council not invited to the meeting, 
14:308:25176:28:27:72:308:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:they were unaware that it was even taking place. 
14:309:25225:27:28:108:520:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: On Friday afternoon at Camp David, the president and his advisers met to discuss the 
14:310:25310:28:27:72:537:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:proposed Treasury package.  Federal Reserve chairman Burns strongly opposed closing the gold 
14:311:25403:27:28:72:406:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:window, but this position received no support.  Volcker recalled that  
14:312:25474:28:28:108:519:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:“the only really active debate about the program was over the import surcharge.  As I 
14:313:25560:28:27:108:540:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:remember it, the discussion largely was a matter of the economists against the politicians, 
14:314:25652:27:28:108:539:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and the outcome wasn’t really close.  I think the president had been convinced that it was 
14:315:25743:28:27:108:517:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:both an essential negotiating tactic and a way to attract public support” (Volcker and 
14:316:25830:27:48:108:214:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Gyohten 1992, 78).6

14:319:25957:11:16:72:536:90:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:6 Similarly, Gowa (1983, 150n) writes:  “Most, although not all, of the administration’s economic officials believed 
14:320:26074:16:0:72:538:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:that the surcharge coupled with the suspension constituted overkill, dangerous because it invited retaliation by other 
15:321:26196:0:27:108:521:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: Connally was the principal proponent of the import surcharge.  He argued that simply 
15:322:26281:27:28:72:536:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:closing the gold window would be insufficient to get other countries to revalue their currencies.  
15:323:26380:28:27:72:538:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The surcharge would be temporary, but without an explicit time limit, so that it could achieve its 
15:324:26479:27:28:72:539:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:goal of eliciting foreign concessions.  He argued that the measure would be politically popular at 
15:325:26578:28:28:72:546:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:home and would shock foreign countries into agreeing to America’s demands (Safire 1975, 513).   
15:326:26674:28:27:108:535:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: McCracken responded by noting that the import surcharge might strengthen the dollar at 
15:327:26761:27:28:72:514:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:a time when they wanted it to fall against other currencies.  Connally countered:  “It’s more 
15:328:26855:28:27:72:532:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:understandable to the American people to put on a border tax.  I know it’s inconsistent; you are 
15:329:26952:27:28:72:500:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:right.  But the tax may make a change in the exchange rate possible” (Safire 1975, 513).  
15:330:27042:28:28:72:528:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:President Nixon was clearly attracted to the idea, saying that “the border tax is not too damned 
15:331:27139:28:27:72:542:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:aggressive, just aggressive enough” (Safire 1975, 513).  Implying that an effective administration 
15:332:27238:27:28:72:525:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:response could also forestall protectionism on the part of Congress, Nixon added that “we can 
15:333:27332:28:27:72:520:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:screw around with an exchange rate but Mills is coming in with an import surcharge” (James 
15:334:27423:27:28:72:523:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:1996, 233).  When the president asked if other countries could retaliate against the surcharge, 
15:335:27519:28:27:72:525:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Peter Peterson replied that, under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), other 
15:336:27611:27:28:72:539:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:countries could not retaliate if it was imposed for balance of payments purposes.  This seemed to 
15:337:27709:28:28:72:233:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:clinch the case for the surcharge. 
15:338:27744:28:27:108:536:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:George Shultz and Kenneth Dam (1977, 115), both of whom participated at the meeting, 
15:339:27829:27:28:72:503:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:later justified the surcharge on the grounds that “we wanted to get their [other countries’] 
15:340:27922:28:27:72:514:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:attention, to make them realize how serious we were, and to equip our negotiator, Secretary 
15:341:28014:27:28:72:536:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Connally, with more tools for bargaining.”  They said that it was “an implicit devaluation on the 
15:342:28112:28:32:72:521:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:import side, an attention getter, and a bargaining chip . . . Although we knew that economists 
15:343:28207:32:12:539:542:97:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                                                                                                                             
15:344:28363:12:11:72:539:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:nations.  Camp David participants generally adhere to the view that the surcharge would not have been imposed had 
15:345:28477:11:0:72:193:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Connally not been secretary.” 
16:346:28510:0:27:72:529:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:could and would show that the import surcharge had a perverse market effect by reducing U.S. 
16:347:28603:27:28:72:506:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:imports and thereby offsetting the tendency for the U.S. dollar to weaken on the exchange 
16:348:28693:28:27:72:484:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:markets, we regarded the surcharge as a temporary part of our negotiating strategy.”   
16:349:28780:27:28:108:509:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: President Nixon announced the new policies in a nationally televised speech on the 
16:350:28863:28:28:72:540:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:evening of Sunday, August 15.  Most of the address focused on the domestic economic situation, 
16:351:28958:28:27:72:510:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:particularly the decision to impose wage and price controls.  The decision to close the gold 
16:352:29051:27:28:72:493:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:window was not portrayed as a devaluation of the dollar, but as a way of promoting the 
16:353:29138:28:27:72:531:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:competitive position of U.S. manufacturing industries in the global market.  The surcharge was 
16:354:29233:27:28:72:390:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:not the main focus of the speech, but it was discussed in this way: 
16:355:29301:28:28:108:528:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:“I am taking one further step to protect the dollar, to improve our balance of payments, 
16:356:29390:28:27:108:520:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and to increase jobs for Americans. As a temporary measure, I am today imposing an 
16:357:29473:27:28:108:522:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:additional tax of 10 percent on goods imported into the United States.  This is a better 
16:358:29562:28:27:108:542:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:solution for international trade than direct controls on the amount of imports.  This import 
16:359:29655:27:28:108:516:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:tax is a temporary action. It isn’t directed against any other country. It is an action to 
16:360:29746:28:27:108:514:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:make certain that American products will not be at a disadvantage because of unfair 
16:361:29830:27:28:108:537:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:exchange rates. When the unfair treatment is ended, the import tax will end as well. As a 
16:362:29920:28:28:108:530:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:result of these actions, the product of American labor will be more competitive, and the 
16:363:30009:28:27:108:522:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:unfair edge that some of our foreign competition has will be removed. This is a major 
16:364:30095:27:28:108:429:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:reason why our trade balance has eroded over the past 15 years.”7  
16:365:30162:28:27:108:509:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: Nixon and Connally were correct in their belief that the import surcharge would be 
16:366:30245:27:28:72:497:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:popular.  A Harris poll indicated that 71 percent of Americans surveyed approved of the 
16:367:30333:28:28:72:542:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:surcharge, while 14 percent disapproved and 15 percent were unsure (Harris Survey 1975, 184).

17:371:30562:0:27:108:506:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: Nixon’s Sunday night announcement came as a complete surprise; diplomats from 
17:372:30640:27:28:72:522:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:America’s leading trading partners had not been given advance warning.  Having stunned the 
17:373:30731:28:27:72:507:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:world with its decision, the Nixon administration now had to come up with its negotiating 
17:374:30821:27:28:72:518:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:position on the foreign actions required for the removal of the surcharge.  The principal U.S. 
17:375:30916:28:28:72:527:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:objective was to bring about a $13 billion improvement in U.S. balance of payments position.  
17:376:31010:28:27:72:519:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:To achieve this objective, American officials demanded a substantial appreciation of foreign 
17:377:31103:27:28:72:507:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:currencies against the dollar, an end to unfair trade practices and a liberalization of import 
17:378:31198:28:27:72:497:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:policies, and greater burden-sharing in defense expenditures among the Western allies.   
17:379:31287:27:28:108:532:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: After Nixon’s announcement, Connally and Volcker were dispatched to foreign capitals 
17:380:31372:28:28:72:523:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to seek these changes in foreign economic policies.  Connally’s opening demand was for a 24 
17:381:31464:28:27:72:534:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:percent revaluation of the yen and an 18 percent revaluation of the mark.  Volcker assumed that 
17:382:31560:27:28:72:347:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:countries would willingly accommodate U.S. demands:   
17:383:31614:28:27:108:508:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:“In my naïveté, I thought we could wrap up an exchange rate realignment and start 
17:384:31696:27:28:108:512:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:talking about reform in a month or two. . . . Instead, I got a fast lesson in big-league 
17:385:31785:28:27:108:494:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:negotiations. . . What we found, even after we shut the gold window, was fierce 
17:386:31865:27:28:108:500:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:resistance by key countries to their currencies floating upward against the dollar” 
17:387:31949:28:28:108:276:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:(Volcker and Gyohten 1992, 80).   
17:388:31983:28:27:108:526:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: For several months, American officials were unable to get other countries to agree to a 
17:389:32071:27:28:72:532:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:formal revaluation of their currencies.  This was not a problem with respect to Germany, which 
17:390:32166:28:27:72:514:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:allowed the mark to appreciate after having allowed it to float in May (Figure 1).  But other 
17:391:32260:27:28:72:538:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:European countries objected to Germany’s proposal that their currencies also be allowed to float 
17:392:32357:28:28:71:538:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:against the dollar.  In particular, France insisted that exchange controls, dual exchange rates, and 
17:393:32458:28:0:71:348:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:other measures be used to preserve the existing parities.

18:399:32613:28:28:108:508:382:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: Yet it was clear that the existing parities could not be maintained, particularly with 
18:400:32700:28:27:72:531:354:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:respect to the Japanese yen.  More than any other country, Japan resisted the appreciation of its 
18:401:32798:27:28:72:533:327:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:currency.  The Nixon shock unleashed enormous speculation against the dollar, forcing Japan’s 
18:402:32892:28:27:72:499:299:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:central bank to intervene massively in foreign exchange markets to prevent the yen from 
18:403:32980:27:28:72:533:272:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:appreciating.  On Monday and Tuesday, August 16-17, Japan bought $1.3 billion to support the 
18:404:33073:28:28:72:522:244:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:dollar and keep the yen at the old rate of ¥360 (Angel 1991, 128).  Though the Bank of Japan 
18:405:33166:28:27:72:526:216:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:tried to restrict foreign exchange transactions, it failed to stem the flight to the yen.  One week 
18:406:33266:27:28:72:535:189:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:after the Nixon shock, Japan’s foreign exchange reserves had increased $2.7 billion, an increase 
18:407:33363:28:27:72:526:161:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of 30 percent (Angel 1991, 139).  After two weeks it had accumulated an additional $4 billion 
18:408:33457:27:28:72:510:134:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:(Figure 2).  Yet this large-scale intervention could not prevent the dollar from depreciating 
18:409:33551:28:28:72:207:106:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:against the yen (Figure 3).

20:448:34300:27:28:108:536:384:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: Although foreign exchange markets were forcing at least some exchange rates to deviate 
20:449:34387:28:27:72:530:356:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:from their official parities, foreign governments were still reluctant to agree to a formal change 
20:450:34486:27:28:72:542:329:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:in parities.  By September, there was growing internal dissention within the Nixon administration 
20:451:34584:28:28:72:505:301:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:about the value of continuing the surcharge.  The opposition was led by National Security 
20:452:34674:28:27:72:525:273:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:adviser Henry Kissinger.  Initially “agnostic” about the August 15 measures, Kissinger (1979, 
20:453:34768:27:28:72:502:246:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:955, 957) recognized that the administration “would have to tread a narrow path between 
20:454:34856:28:27:72:528:218:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:maintaining enough pressure to provide an incentive for the adjustments we were seeking, and 
20:455:34949:27:28:72:506:191:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:evoking a trade war as well as jeopardizing political relationships built up over decades.”

20:458:35222:27:0:72:512:108:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:adjustments, the trade concessions, and the increased burden sharing that Connally desired,

21:473:35404:0:27:72:486:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Kissinger (1979, 955-56) “grew concerned about the unsettling impact of a prolonged 
21:474:35488:27:28:72:263:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:confrontation on allied relationships.”   
21:475:35530:28:27:108:529:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: Contrary to Connally’s view that the impact of the surcharge would increase over time, 
21:476:35617:27:28:72:531:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the NSC believed that the bargaining value of the surcharge would deteriorate the longer it was 
21:477:35713:28:28:72:530:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:in place.  Not only did it risk leading to foreign countermeasures and reprisals that would harm 
21:478:35810:28:27:72:537:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:U.S. exports, but Kissinger was warned that domestic interests might demand that it be kept as a 
21:479:35907:27:28:72:518:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:permanent fixture of U.S. trade policy (FRUS 1969-76, 512-515).  This view was reinforced 
21:480:35997:28:27:72:512:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:“when Arthur Burns showed me a list of retaliatory measures planned by our major trading 
21:481:36086:27:28:72:534:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:partners which would produce an outcome on balance highly disadvantageous to us” (Kissinger 
21:482:36178:28:28:72:508:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:1979, 957).  Thus, Kissinger came to the view that the surcharge was contributing to trans-
21:483:36269:28:27:72:427:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Atlantic diplomatic tensions and should be removed as soon as possible.   
21:484:36343:27:28:108:517:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: On September 20, Kissinger pressed this foreign policy argument with the president, 
21:485:36427:28:27:72:492:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:suggesting that the surcharge be dropped in exchange for no immediate return to dollar 
21:486:36514:27:28:72:520:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:convertibility into gold (as if that was even an option).  Nixon shot down Kissinger’s appeal: 
21:487:36609:28:27:108:524:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:“The difficulty is the surcharge, Henry, it so popular domestically, we just can’t end it 
21:488:36699:27:28:108:542:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:until we get something for it.  That’s the, hell, the surcharge is supported by 85 percent of 
21:489:36793:28:28:108:476:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the people.  Good God, you just can’t give it away” (Ohlmacher 2009, 23).   
21:490:36869:28:27:108:521:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: The surcharge was certainly becoming a source of international tension.  While it had 
21:491:36955:27:28:72:520:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:been aimed principally at Japan, the surcharge applied to dutiable imports from all countries, 
21:492:37050:28:27:72:540:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:including those running trade deficits with the United States.  Latin American countries, many of 
21:493:37148:27:28:72:525:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:which had trade deficits, complained that their exports were unfairly subject to the surcharge.  
21:494:37245:28:28:72:522:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Because its currency was already floating against the dollar, Canada demanded an exemption 
21:495:37336:28:0:72:539:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:from the surcharge.  The European Economic Community filed a complaint in the GATT.  Other 
22:496:37430:0:27:72:535:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:countries hinted that they might retaliate.  In October, Denmark announced that it was imposing 
22:497:37526:27:28:71:526:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:a 10 percent surcharge on imports to address its balance of payments problems.  Yet Connally 
22:498:37619:28:27:71:542:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:insisted that the surcharge “is going to stay on for awhile because it frankly is to our advantage to 
22:499:37721:27:28:71:524:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:keep it on for awhile” (Solomon 1977, 199-200).  Yet he also hinted that countries complying 
22:500:37814:28:28:72:526:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:with U.S. demands, such as Germany whose currency had appreciated significantly, would be 
22:501:37904:28:27:72:311:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:awarded with an exemption from the surcharge.   
22:502:37952:27:28:108:527:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: To speed the negotiations, Connally reduced the requested amount of revaluation to 20 
22:503:38038:28:27:72:533:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:percent for the yen and 15 percent for the mark.  Germany was not a problem because the mark 
22:504:38131:27:28:72:506:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:had already appreciated significantly against the dollar.  The problem was other European 
22:505:38221:28:28:72:532:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:countries and the concern about cross-rates:  Germany did not want to lose competitiveness vis-
22:506:38316:28:27:72:527:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:à-vis its European trade partners and therefore did not want to agree to a formal revaluation of 
22:507:38413:27:28:72:509:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the mark unless other European currencies were revalued as well.  At various international 
22:508:38504:28:27:72:531:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:meetings, other European countries continued to resist the U.S. demands.  For example, France 
22:509:38598:27:28:72:495:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:was willing to allow the dollar to depreciate against the franc, but not allow the franc to 
22:510:38690:28:27:72:527:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:appreciate against gold.  That is, France insisted that the franc remained fixed in terms of gold 
22:511:38788:27:28:72:289:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and the dollar be devalued in terms of gold.   
22:512:38835:28:28:107:536:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: Connally resisted raising the dollar price of gold because he did not want to be known as 
22:513:38925:28:27:72:535:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the Treasury Secretary who devalued the dollar against gold.  Nixon affirmed this position: “I’ll 
22:514:39023:27:28:72:528:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:be damned if we raise the price of gold like Arthur [Burns] wants” (FRUS 1969-76, 522).  But 
22:515:39116:28:27:72:536:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:without a revaluation of the franc, Germany would not agree to a formal revaluation of the mark 
22:516:39212:27:0:72:538:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:because they wanted to ensure that the mark-franc rate did not significantly alter the competitive 
23:517:39314:0:27:72:516:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:position of each country’s goods.  So now France became a key player in the negotiations, a 
23:518:39406:27:28:72:522:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:country with which the United States had little leverage – even with the surcharge in place.8   
23:519:39502:28:27:107:502:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:By late November, with Kissinger constantly reminding him of the foreign policy 
23:520:39582:27:28:71:506:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:difficulties caused by the unresolved exchange rate issue, Nixon began to worry about the 
23:521:39672:28:28:71:521:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:political costs of the continued stalemate.9  The president signaled to Connally that he should 
23:522:39768:28:27:72:541:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:settle the impasse as soon as possible.  Shultz and Dam (1977, 116) later concluded that “without 
23:523:39866:27:28:72:505:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the intervention of Kissinger, the devaluation of the dollar would almost surely have been 
23:524:39957:28:27:72:542:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:greater, thereby obviating any need for a further devaluation in February 1973.”  A G-10 meeting 
23:525:40054:27:28:72:541:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:in Rome in late November-early December was inconclusive.  Japan was still reluctant to change 
23:526:40149:28:28:72:533:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the official parity, despite the fact that the dollar had fallen against the yen on foreign exchange 
23:527:40250:28:27:72:519:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:markets.  France still refused to revalue its currency against gold and insisted that the United 
23:528:40347:27:28:72:536:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:States had to devalue the dollar against gold.  And Germany rejected a formal revaluation of the 
23:529:40444:28:27:72:465:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:mark against the dollar unless there was a similar change in the franc-dollar rate.  
23:530:40529:27:28:108:529:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:A key meeting between President Nixon and President Georges Pompidou of France in 
23:531:40611:28:27:72:505:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:mid-December finally broke the impasse (Kissinger 1979, 959-962).  France opposed any 
23:532:40697:27:28:72:489:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:general move to floating exchange rates, something that had been debated among U.S. 
23:533:40781:28:32:72:526:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:officials.10  But France agreed to keep its gold parity unchanged if the dollar price of gold was 
23:534:40879:32:7:216:219:235:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                 
23:535:40927:7:16:72:525:228:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:8  An October 26, 1971 memo from Peter Peterson to Secretary Connally on administration strategy noted:  “The 
23:536:41036:16:12:71:515:212:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:surcharge provides little leverage against France, and France does not abhor the trade wars and bloc formation 
23:537:41147:12:11:71:539:200:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:which could develop. We can therefore achieve an effective French revaluation only by devaluing the dollar... . The 
23:538:41263:11:12:71:535:189:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:United States should agree to devalue the dollar against gold by 5% to 8% if the following monetary conditions are 
23:539:41378:12:11:71:535:177:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:met: 1. Simultaneous revaluations of at least 10% by Japan and 5% by Germany, leading to effective exchange rate 
23:540:41491:11:12:72:533:166:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:changes of at least 15%-18% for Japan; 10%-13% for Germany; and 5%-8% for France, Italy, Britain (hopefully)”

23:542:41671:7:16:72:513:147:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:9 Fred Bergsten informs me that European countries were reluctant to agree to summit meetings over Nixon’s 
23:543:41778:16:7:71:395:131:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:détente policy, which the president viewed as important to his reelection efforts. 
23:544:41861:7:16:72:538:124:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:10 Shultz and Dam (1977, 119) note that the U.S. government was divided over whether to continue to support fixed 
23:545:41975:16:11:72:534:108:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:exchange rates or whether to push for floating exchange rates.  The Federal Reserve, the State Department, and the 
23:546:42090:11:12:72:537:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:National Security Council wanted to maintain fixed rates, while the Treasury Department, the Council of Economic 
23:547:42203:12:11:72:525:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Advisers, and the Office of Management and Budget wanted to move to floating exchange rates so that domestic 
23:548:42312:11:0:72:342:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:policies would not be constrained by international considerations.   
24:549:42384:0:27:72:534:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:increased.  This would allow the dollar to fall against the franc, as long as the revaluation of the 
24:550:42485:27:28:72:531:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:franc was less than the mark’s revaluation.  Nixon agreed to devalue the dollar in terms of gold 
24:551:42582:28:27:72:330:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and lift the surcharge (FRUS 1969-76, 3:597-601).     
24:552:42636:27:28:108:500:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The agreement with France set the stage for the G-10 meeting at the Smithsonian 
24:553:42716:28:28:72:529:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Institution in Washington, D.C. on December 17-18 to finalize new exchange rate parities.  On 
24:554:42810:28:27:72:542:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the first day of the Smithsonian negotiations, the United States asked for 19.2 percent revaluation 
24:555:42910:27:28:72:524:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of the yen and 14 percent for the mark.  Germany agreed to a 13.57 percent revaluation of the 
24:556:43004:28:27:72:542:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:mark.  The United States agreed to devalue the dollar by raising the dollar price of gold from $35 
24:557:43103:27:28:72:536:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:per ounce to $38 per ounce, an increase of 8.57 percent.  Britain and France did not change their 
24:558:43201:28:28:72:540:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:gold parity, so their currencies rose 8.57 percent against the dollar.  Italy and Sweden devalued 1 
24:559:43301:28:27:72:536:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:percent against gold so that their currencies rose 7.5 percent against the dollar (James 1996, 236-
24:560:43400:27:28:72:100:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:38).   
24:561:43407:28:27:108:504:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:All of this put pressure on Japan because German officials insisted that the yen be 
24:562:43491:27:28:72:509:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:revalued by at least 4 percentage points more than the mark, or at least 17.57 percent.  The 
24:563:43584:28:27:72:542:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Japanese finance minister insisted that the number had to be less than 17 percent, telling the story 
24:564:43685:27:28:72:529:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of the finance minister who was assassinated when he revalued the yen by that amount in 1930 
24:565:43778:28:28:72:539:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:after Japan went back on the gold standard (Angel 1991, 257).11  Connally agreed and settled for 
24:566:43875:28:61:72:500:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:a 16.9 percent revaluation of the yen.  Japan’s finance minister later revealed that he had 
24:567:43967:61:8:216:219:178:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                 
24:568:44015:8:16:72:540:170:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:11  This story is partially accurate.  In the late 1920s, Inoue Junnosuke (Japan’s minister of finance and a governor of 
24:569:44136:16:11:72:520:154:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:the Bank of Japan during the decade) desperately wanted to put Japan back on the gold standard at the old 1897 
24:570:44247:11:12:72:534:143:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:parity, which would significantly overvalue the yen.  (This decision was similar to Winston Churchill’s decision to 
24:571:44363:12:11:72:520:131:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:return to the gold standard in 1925 at the prewar sterling parity, which overvalued the pound and contributed to 
24:572:44476:11:12:72:519:120:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Britain’s economic difficulties.)  Deflationary policies were needed to accomplish this, and the yen appreciated 
24:573:44589:12:11:72:499:108:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:roughly 17 percent between 1925 and 1926 in anticipation of a return to the gold standard.  This monetary 
24:574:44695:11:12:72:531:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:retrenchment contributed to a financial crisis in 1927 and heightened economic distress.  The deflationary policies 
24:575:44811:12:11:72:518:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:discredited liberal internationalists and helped radicalize Japanese politics.  Inoue was assassinated in February 
24:576:44926:11:0:72:187:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:1932.  See Metzler (2006).

25:579:45078:28:27:107:514:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: The Smithsonian agreement was completed on December 18, 1971, and heralded by 
25:580:45156:27:28:71:533:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:President Nixon as “the most significant monetary agreement in the history of the world.”  Two 
25:581:45251:28:28:71:533:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:days later he signed an executive order removing the 10 percent surcharge.  The trade-weighted 
25:582:45346:28:27:72:542:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:depreciation of the dollar against OECD currencies was slightly less than 8 percent, or 12 percent 
25:583:45445:27:28:72:288:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:excluding Canada.  Volcker later wrote that  
25:584:45490:28:27:108:539:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:“it was well short of what we felt we needed to restore a solid equilibrium in our external 
25:585:45582:27:28:108:534:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:payments, even if we had succeeded in opening Japanese and European markets in trade 
25:586:45667:28:28:108:532:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:talks.  But the stonewalling of the Common Market and Japan had been effective.  With 
25:587:45753:28:27:108:522:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the exchange rate realignment settled and the import surcharge removed, we had little 
25:588:45839:27:28:108:401:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:negotiating leverage.” (Volcker and Gyohten 1992, 89-90).   
25:589:45899:28:27:108:517:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: Furthermore, the new parities merely formalized what foreign exchange markets had 
25:590:45981:27:28:72:529:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:already in large part delivered.  As Figures 1 and 3 showed, the mark and the yen were already 
25:591:46076:28:27:72:521:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:trading at the exchange rates agreed to at the conference.  Foreign central banks also adopted 
25:592:46171:27:28:72:511:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:wider bands around the parities, so exchange rates could depart from the parities to a much 
25:593:46263:28:28:72:530:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:greater extent that before.  Still, the Smithsonian agreement only bought a little time before the 
25:594:46362:28:27:72:511:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:ultimate demise of the Bretton Woods system with the advent of floating exchange rates in 
25:595:46452:27:28:72:136:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:March 1973. 
25:596:46464:28:27:108:520:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: The other U.S. objectives – a reduction of foreign trade barriers and increased burden 
25:597:46551:27:28:72:532:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:sharing of defense expenditures – were generally neglected in the aftermath of the Smithsonian 
25:598:46646:28:32:72:508:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:agreement.12  However, the exchange rate adjustment succeeded in alleviating some of the 
25:599:46735:32:7:216:219:97:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                 
25:600:46783:7:16:72:509:90:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:12   As Solomon (1977, 191) points out: “Somewhere along the way between August 15 and the Smithsonian 
25:601:46886:16:0:72:529:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:meeting of December 17-18, the defense-sharing objective was dropped and the request for reduced trade barriers 
26:602:47001:0:27:72:532:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:protectionist pressures that had been building up in Congress.  In retrospect, Volcker (1978-79, 
26:603:47098:27:28:72:117:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:7) said:   
26:604:47109:28:27:108:536:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:“The conclusion reached by some that the United States shrugged off responsibilities for 
26:605:47198:27:28:108:503:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the dollar and for leadership in preserving an open world order does seem to me a 
26:606:47280:28:28:108:529:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:misinterpretation of the facts. . . . The devaluation itself was the strongest argument we 
26:607:47371:28:27:107:509:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:had to repel protectionism.  The operating premise throughout was that a necessary 
26:608:47454:27:28:107:527:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:realignment of exchange rates and other measures consistent with more open trade and 
26:609:47539:28:27:108:532:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:open capital markets could accomplish the necessary balance-of-payments adjustment.” 
26:610:47624:27:28:72:542:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Indeed, after the devaluation of the dollar, the Burke-Hartke legislation faded away and Congress 
26:611:47722:28:28:72:516:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:even began supporting new legislation to reduce trade barriers.  There was strong support in 
26:612:47815:28:27:72:503:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:1972-73 for legislation that eventually became the Trade Act of 1974, which gave formal 
26:613:47903:27:28:72:525:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:permission for the United States to participate in the Tokyo Round of GATT negotiations that 
26:614:47996:28:27:72:170:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:had begun in 1973.  
26:615:48016:27:28:108:531:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: In terms of academic opinion, while many economists supported the closing of the gold 
26:616:48102:28:27:72:542:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:window, the surcharge was more controversial.  At Yale University, James Tobin, Robert Triffin, 
26:617:48198:27:28:72:535:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:and Richard Cooper were critical of the surcharge, fearing that it would be counterproductive or 
26:618:48295:28:28:72:522:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:difficult to remove, while Henry Wallich supported it as a bargaining tool (Hartford Courant, 
26:619:48389:28:27:72:524:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:October 4, 1971, 7).  Harvard’s Francis Bator warned that Connally’s tactics were “recklessly 
26:620:48483:27:28:72:514:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:dangerous” and were bringing the world to the “brink of economic war” (New York Times, 
26:621:48570:28:27:72:507:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:November 30, 1971).  While Milton Friedman did not explicitly endorse the surcharge, he 
26:622:48658:27:28:72:512:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:argued that it “succeeded beyond expectation in shaking exchange rates loose,” adding that 
26:623:48749:28:32:72:540:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:“once it did that, it should have been abolished promptly” (Newsweek, December 20, 1971, 83).  
26:624:48844:32:12:539:542:97:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                                                                                                                             
26:625:49000:12:11:72:537:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:was watered down to a few trivial demands.”  However, some have claimed that the events of 1971 helped pave the 
26:626:49112:11:0:72:474:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:way for the start of the Tokyo Round of trade negotiations, which commenced in September 1973.

27:628:49305:27:28:71:502:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:negotiate an exchange rate change with Japan prior to the shock, arguing that “the import 
27:629:49395:28:27:71:536:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:surcharge, the other trade moves, and the rhetoric accompanying the whole effort actually foster

27:633:49576:27:28:107:504:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: The 10 percent import surcharge, in effect from August 16 to December 20, 1971, 
27:634:49656:28:27:71:522:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:constitutes a unique policy experiment in postwar U.S. trade policy.  To determine whether it 
27:635:49750:27:28:71:531:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:played a role in bringing about the revaluation of other currencies, it is important to assess how 
27:636:49849:28:28:71:201:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:much it affected imports.   
27:637:49877:28:27:107:529:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: The surcharge applied to only about 52 percent of U.S. imports.  There are two reasons 
27:638:49964:27:28:71:528:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:for its limited impact.  First, the surcharge was only imposed on dutiable imports, which at the 
27:639:50061:28:27:71:521:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:time constituted about two thirds of all U.S. imports (Statistical Abstract of the United States 
27:640:50158:27:28:71:523:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:1972, 788).  The remaining one-third of imports was duty-free and therefore exempt from the 
27:641:50250:28:27:71:542:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:levy.  Second, all imports subject to quantitative restrictions (QRs) – about 17 percent of dutiable 
27:642:50351:27:28:71:515:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:imports - were exempt from the surcharge.  These included such goods as petroleum, sugar, 
27:643:50441:28:28:71:516:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:meat, dairy products, other agricultural imports, and cotton textiles that were covered by the 
27:644:50536:28:27:71:256:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Long-Term Agreement on textiles.13   
27:645:50573:27:28:108:502:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: Furthermore, the 10 percent surcharge could not be fully applied to the applicable 
27:646:50656:28:27:71:530:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:dutiable imports; the weighted average surcharge was 9.3 percent on dutiable imports, or about 
27:647:50751:27:28:71:536:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:4.8 percent on total imports (GATT 1971, 19; Economic Report of the President 1972, 70).  The 
27:648:50845:28:20:71:524:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:U.S. tariff code consisted of two columns of duties, the column 1 most-favored nation (MFN) 
27:649:50937:20:8:216:219:109:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                 
27:650:50985:8:16:72:515:101:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:13 Based on 1970 trade data, the surcharge applied to $20.8 billion out of $39.8 billion in total imports.  Of the 
27:651:51100:16:11:72:533:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:balance, about $14.2 billion were duty free, $4.4 billion were exempt because they were subject to QRs, and about 
27:652:51214:11:0:72:466:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:$500 million were not affected because the column 1 and 2 rates were identical (GATT 1972, 19). 
28:653:51313:0:27:72:510:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:rates which were the tariffs that had been reached in executive trade agreements (under the 
28:654:51405:27:28:72:540:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:authority of the Reciprocal Trade Agreement act) and the column 2 statutory rates established by 
28:655:51502:28:27:72:518:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Congress in the Tariff Act of 1930.  The president only had the legal authority to impose the 
28:656:51596:27:28:72:498:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:surcharge on goods whose tariff had been reduced in previous trade agreements, and the 
28:657:51683:28:28:72:539:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:surcharge could not increase the applied tariff beyond the statutory rate.  If the statutory rate was 
28:658:51785:28:27:72:527:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:less than 10 percent, the surcharge could not be fully applied.  For example, the MFN tariff on 
28:659:51881:27:28:72:538:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:automobiles was 3.2 percent, whereas the column 2 statutory rate was 10 percent.  In such cases, 
28:660:51978:28:27:72:525:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the surcharge was simply half the gap between the MFN and the statutory tariff; in the case of 
28:661:52073:27:28:71:541:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:automobiles, the surcharge-inclusive tariff was 6.5 percent (Council of Economic Advisers 1972, 
28:662:52169:28:28:71:523:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:148).  In a limited number of cases, the column 1 and column 2 rates were the same, in which 
28:663:52262:28:27:71:271:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:case the surcharge could not be imposed. 
28:664:52303:27:28:107:513:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: Other adjustments were made to the surcharge when it took effect.  Shortly after the 
28:665:52388:28:27:71:535:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:surcharge was announced, the Treasury decided to exempt goods in transit before August 15, as 
28:666:52482:27:28:71:525:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:well as those held up by dock strikes or being withdrawn from bonded warehouses, so long as 
28:667:52574:28:27:71:540:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:they cleared customs by October 1.  As a result, imports for consumption surged in September in 
28:668:52670:27:28:71:207:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:part to beat the deadline.14   
28:669:52701:28:28:108:509:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: What was the impact of the surcharge on U.S. imports?  One way of estimating the 
28:670:52782:28:27:72:537:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:impact is to use the Houthakker and Magee (1969) estimate of the price elasticity of U.S. import 
28:671:52879:27:28:72:504:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:demand.  The existing average tariff on dutiable imports was 9.2 percent in 1971, and the 
28:672:52969:28:27:72:527:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:surcharge was an additional 9.3 percentage points on top of that.  This implies that the relative 
28:673:53067:27:28:72:521:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:price of dutiable imports would increase by about 8.5 percent.  Using the Houthakker-Magee 
28:674:53158:28:20:72:535:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:price elasticity of import demand of -0.54, this translates into a 4.6 percent reduction in affected 
28:675:53259:20:8:216:219:109:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                 
28:676:53307:8:16:72:519:101:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:14 The surcharge conflicted with the wage and price controls that were announced at the same time.  The Nixon 
28:677:53417:16:11:72:522:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:administration ruled that firms whose costs went up as a result of the surcharge would be allowed to pass on the 
28:678:53530:11:0:72:243:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:costs of the surcharge to their customers.   
29:679:53578:0:27:72:538:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:imports, or a 2.2 percent fall in total imports.  If the price elasticity was -1, then affected imports 
29:680:53682:27:28:72:541:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:would fall by 8.5 percent and total imports by 4.3 percent.  These figures are roughly comparable 
29:681:53780:28:27:72:533:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to a U.S. estimate at the time.  The U.S. representative at the GATT stated that, if the surcharge 
29:682:53879:27:28:72:508:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:was in effect for a year, imports would be approximately $1.5-$2.0 billion lower than they 
29:683:53970:28:28:72:521:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:otherwise would have been (GATT 1971, 9).  This amounts to about 5.8 to 7.7 percent of the 
29:684:54061:28:27:72:539:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:1970 value of dutiable imports, which somewhat overstates the percentage reduction because the 
29:685:54156:27:28:72:293:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:value of those imports was higher in 1971.15   
29:686:54203:28:27:108:522:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: The impact of the surcharge on imports might be revealed by studying the differential 
29:687:54289:27:28:72:525:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:movements in dutiable and duty free imports.  Figure 4 presents monthly data on dutiable and 
29:688:54382:28:28:71:514:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:duty free imports.  This gives us a nice comparison between dutiable imports (the treatment 
29:689:54474:28:27:72:524:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:group) that were exposed to the surcharge and duty-free imports (the control group) that were 
29:690:54568:27:28:72:543:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:unaffected by the surcharge.  Although these imports tend to be different types of goods (dutiable 
29:691:54667:28:27:71:527:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:imports are largely manufactured goods, whereas duty-free imports are largely raw materials), 
29:692:54761:27:28:71:529:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the month-to-month variation in the two series is very similar.  Any major shock to one, due to 
29:693:54857:28:27:71:403:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:changes in income or other factors, is usually reflected in the other.

29:697:54980:8:16:72:515:124:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:15 A related question is the revenue effects of the surcharge.  At Camp David, Volcker stated that the Treasury 
29:698:55092:16:11:72:536:108:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:expected the surcharge to yield $1.5-2.0 billion, but no time horizon was given for this estimate (Safire 1975, 515).  
29:699:55211:11:12:72:522:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:The actual value of dutiable imports three months (October-December 1971) was $7.452 billion; therefore a 9.3 
29:700:55321:12:11:72:542:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:percent surcharge would have raised approximately $700 million.  In fact, the surcharge raised about $485 million in 
29:701:55438:11:0:72:114:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:revenue.

30:706:55599:27:28:90:527:340:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:This suggests that a simple difference-in-difference specification is one way of identifying 
30:707:55692:28:28:71:530:312:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the impact of the surcharge on dutiable imports (relative to duty-free imports).  Thus, we could 
30:708:55789:28:27:71:236:284:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:consider a regression of the form: 
30:709:55824:27:28:119:514:257:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Log of imports = α + β1 · Dutiable + β2 · Surcharge + δ (Dutiable · Surcharge) + ε, 
30:710:55908:28:27:72:537:229:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:where Dutiable is a dummy variable for dutiable imports, Surcharge is a dummy variable for the 
30:711:56003:27:28:72:540:202:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:period that the surcharge was in effect (October-December 1971).  The parameter of interest is δ, 
30:712:56101:28:28:72:517:174:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:which is the impact of the surcharge on dutiable imports in comparison to duty-free imports.

31:728:56616:27:28:72:537:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:hours of dockworkers during this period and the collapses in early 1969 and late 1971.  The East 
31:729:56713:28:27:72:536:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:coast was affected by a dock strike from October 1 to November 28, 1971.  Thus, import surged 
31:730:56807:27:28:72:514:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:in September in anticipation of the strike as well as the surcharge.  In December 1971, even 
31:731:56900:28:28:72:532:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:though the surcharge remained in effect, imports in East coast ports rebounded sharply because 
31:732:56995:28:27:72:540:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the strike ended.  Meanwhile, West coast ports were hit by dock strikes from July 1 to October 8, 
31:733:57093:27:28:72:528:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:1971, and again from January 17 to February 20, 1972.  For the West coast, the strike does not 
31:734:57188:28:27:72:538:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:overlap with the surcharge period, but - despite the surcharge - imports were significantly higher 
31:735:57287:27:28:72:497:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:than average in October in order to make up for the imports lost over previous months.

32:814:59222:27:28:108:496:181:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: The results confirm the difficulties of disentangling the effects of the strikes and 
32:815:59307:28:28:72:533:153:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:surcharge on imports.  The coefficient for total imports is of the wrong sign and not statistically 
32:816:59407:28:27:72:531:125:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:significant.  The coefficient indicates that dutiable imports were 10 percent higher compared to 
32:817:59504:27:0:72:493:98:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:duty free imports during the period that the surcharge was in effect, but this reflects the 
33:818:59599:0:27:72:506:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:differential rebound in imports as a result of the ending of the dock strike and the surge of 
33:819:59693:27:28:72:520:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:imports in December 1971.  For Germany, the coefficient is the wrong sign (again due to the 
33:820:59785:28:27:72:535:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:December surge) and is statistically significant.  Although the dock strikes affected dutiable and 
33:821:59884:27:28:72:520:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:duty-free imports alike, most European countries exported very few duty-free goods, making 
33:822:59975:28:28:72:393:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:inference from the difference-in-differences specification tenuous. 
33:823:60043:28:27:108:525:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: The most plausible country estimates are for Canada and Japan.  Imports from Canada 
33:824:60127:27:28:72:527:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:were largely unaffected by the dock strikes because about 92 percent of the imports arrived by 
33:825:60222:28:27:72:527:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:land or air.  The point estimate indicates that imports of dutiable goods were about 2.5 percent 
33:826:60319:27:28:72:539:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:lower than imports of duty-free goods during the period the surcharge was in effect, although the 
33:827:60417:28:28:71:531:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:estimate is not statistically significant.  Imports from Japan were somewhat less affected by the 
33:828:60515:28:27:71:530:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:strikes because the West coast strikes occurred before and after the period the surcharge was in 
33:829:60612:27:28:71:536:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:effect.  Although it is also not statistically significant, the coefficient suggests that the surcharge 
33:830:60716:28:27:71:532:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:reduced Japanese imports by about 2 percent, a plausible magnitude.  This might understate the 
33:831:60811:27:28:71:518:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:impact of Japan’s trade because it includes higher than normal imports in October due to the 
33:832:60904:28:27:71:208:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:lifting of the dock strike.17   
33:833:60936:27:28:108:510:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: To conclude, the coincidence of dock strikes at the time the surcharge was in effect 
33:834:61021:28:28:72:502:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:confounds any effort to estimate the impact of the surcharge on imports.  However, weak 
33:835:61109:28:27:72:505:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:evidence from Canada (whose imports were relatively unaffected by the strike) and Japan 
33:836:61197:27:28:72:416:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:suggest that the surcharge reduced dutiable imports by about 2 percent.

33:841:61319:7:16:72:541:90:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:17 Japanese authorities estimated that 10 percent surcharge was roughly equivalent to a 2.2 percent revaluation of the 
33:842:61438:16:0:72:342:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:yen in terms of its effect on trade (Volcker and Gyohten 1992, 95).

34:844:61540:27:28:108:534:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: The incidence of the surcharge was unequal across countries because countries exported 
34:845:61627:28:27:71:542:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:different types of products to the United States that were differentially affected by the surcharge.

34:847:61826:28:28:72:538:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:import duties, and hence the surcharge.  By this measure, Canada and most developing countries 
34:848:61921:28:27:72:524:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:were the least vulnerable to the surcharge because a larger share of their exports to the United 
34:849:62018:27:28:72:509:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:States was duty free.  European countries and Japan were most vulnerable to the surcharge 
34:850:62108:28:27:72:542:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:because more than 90 percent of their exports to the United States were subject to import duties.

35:874:63155:0:27:108:497:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: This measure of vulnerability yields an interesting pattern.  Figure 5 displays the 
35:875:63239:27:28:72:527:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:relationship between the share of a country’s exports to the United States subject to duties and 
35:876:63336:28:27:72:521:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the appreciation of its currency in 1971.  The positive association suggests that countries that 
35:877:63433:27:28:72:507:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:were more vulnerable to the surcharge revalued their currencies more than less vulnerable 
35:878:63523:28:28:72:527:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:countries.  Yet the relationship in Figure 5 may be spurious:  it uses an imperfect measure of a 
35:879:63620:28:27:72:518:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:country’s vulnerability to the surcharge because countries differed in the importance of their 
35:880:63715:27:28:72:472:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:exports to the United States in terms of their overall dependence on foreign trade.

36:908:64697:28:27:72:524:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of its exports were affected by the surcharge.  On the other hand, while most of the exports of 
36:909:64793:27:28:72:523:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:other European countries to the United States were affected by the surcharge, a much smaller 
36:910:64886:28:28:72:540:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:proportion of their exports were destined to the United States.  In particular, only about 4 percent 
36:911:64987:28:27:72:525:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of French exports were affected by the surcharge.  Thus, the United States may have had little

36:933:65970:27:28:72:514:235:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:reveals that there is no relationship between the potential trade impact of the surcharge on a 
36:934:66065:28:27:72:519:207:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:country’s exports and the revaluation of its currency.  Most European countries are clustered 
36:935:66159:27:28:72:507:180:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:around 5-10 percent in terms of the share of their exports affected by the U.S. action, with 
36:936:66252:28:28:72:522:152:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Canada and Japan being the two outliers.  Canada was largely an innocent bystander that was 
36:937:66344:28:27:72:529:124:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:adversely affected by the surcharge; its currency was already floating against the dollar, and in 
36:938:66442:27:0:72:487:97:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:fact had appreciated against the dollar in the months before the August 1971 decision.

37:945:66749:28:27:72:523:273:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:also quite vulnerable to the surcharge.  In fact, there is suggestive evidence that the surcharge 
37:946:66847:27:28:71:531:246:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:was effective in altering views in Japan.  Just three days after the Nixon shock, the chairman of 
37:947:66945:28:28:72:498:218:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Japan’s Chamber of Commerce stated that a revaluation of the yen was preferable to the 
37:948:67032:28:27:72:543:190:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:continuation of the ten percent surcharge (Angel 1991, 129).  As other business interests weighed 
37:949:67130:27:28:72:522:163:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:in with similar views, the Japanese government began to reconsider its adherence to the 1949 
37:950:67223:28:27:72:525:135:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:parity.  Without the pressure from those groups, Japanese officials might have been willing to 
37:951:67318:27:28:72:538:108:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:accumulate more dollar reserves or restrict foreign exchange transactions in an effort to keep the 
37:952:67417:28:0:72:152:80:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:yen at its parity.

38:973:67623:0:27:108:532:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: Thus, at least in the case of Japan, the import surcharge appears to have played a role in 
38:974:67714:27:28:72:536:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:persuading government officials, in the Ministry of Finance and Bank of Japan, to allow the yen 
38:975:67810:28:27:72:518:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to appreciate.  They were very reluctant to do so, but were pressured by business groups and 
38:976:67903:27:28:72:535:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:export associations who had an interest in removing the surcharge, even though they would also 
38:977:67998:28:28:72:532:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:have to contend with a stronger yen.18  Even National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger (1979, 
38:978:68092:28:27:72:530:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:956), who worked to resolve the exchange rate dispute and remove the surcharge, “came to the 
38:979:68185:27:28:72:490:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:view that some shock had probably been needed to bring about serious negotiations.”   
38:980:68271:28:27:108:514:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: At the same time, the exact role of the surcharge in bringing about the revaluation is 
38:981:68358:27:28:72:505:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:difficult to know.  Closing the gold window alone may have triggered enough speculative 
38:982:68446:28:28:72:518:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:activity against the dollar to have brought about the exchange rate changes formalized in the 
38:983:68540:28:27:71:539:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Smithsonian Agreement.  Yet the surcharge, applied to all countries, was a very blunt instrument 
38:984:68637:27:28:71:383:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:with which to bring one country (Japan) to the negotiating table.

38:987:68746:28:27:107:509:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: The decision to impose the surcharge led to foreign complaints that it violated U.S. 
38:988:68831:27:28:71:509:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:commitments under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and to domestic 
38:989:68915:28:28:71:463:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:complaints that the president lacked the legal authority to impose the surcharge.   
38:990:68999:28:27:71:177:239:144:Times:144:Times:The GATT Challenge 
38:991:69018:27:28:107:506:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: The GATT permits a country to restrict imports when it is experiencing balance of 
38:992:69100:28:27:71:536:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:payments difficulties.  According to Article XII, “any contracting party, in order to safeguard its 
38:993:69200:27:37:71:514:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:external financial position and its balance of payments, may restrict the quantity or value of 
38:994:69295:37:7:216:219:120:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                 
38:995:69343:7:16:72:533:113:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:18 Japanese officials were perhaps justified in their reluctance to allow the change.  Eichengreen and Hatase (2007) 
38:996:69460:16:12:72:524:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:find that the ending of the peg marked the end of Japan’s era of rapid export and investment led growth.  In fact, 
38:997:69575:12:11:72:540:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Japan suffered a recession after ending its currency peg due to the falloff in exports and investment, but its economy 
38:998:69694:11:0:72:346:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:quickly recovered because of favorable growth in the world market. 
39:999:69764:0:27:72:485:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:merchandise permitted to be imported.”  This provision suggests that an import quota 
39:1000:69849:27:28:72:538:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:(quantitative restriction) or a limit on the value of imports is the appropriate policy instrument to 
39:1001:69951:28:27:72:522:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:support a balance of payments objective, rather than a higher tariff or import surcharge.  This 
39:1002:70047:27:28:72:505:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:preference conflicts with other principles of the GATT, notably the general prohibition of 
39:1003:70138:28:28:72:521:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:quantitative restrictions in Article XI and the goal of non-discrimination, which is difficult to 
39:1004:70236:28:27:72:251:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:achieve with non-auctioned quotas.   
39:1005:70273:27:28:108:528:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: In practice, parties to the GATT had used both import quotas and import surcharges on 
39:1006:70359:28:27:72:532:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:balance of payments grounds.  While some countries requested and had received a waiver from 
39:1007:70451:27:28:72:527:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the GATT for their surcharges on these justifications, many countries had not.  As a result, the 
39:1008:70548:28:28:72:508:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:practice had been established that the GATT would “tolerate” surcharges when there were 
39:1009:70636:28:27:72:381:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:balance of payments difficulties (Jackson 1972, Vincke 1972).   
39:1010:70700:27:28:108:527:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: Shortly after the imposition of the surcharge, the GATT established a working party to 
39:1011:70787:28:27:72:536:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:examine it.  Under Article XV, the GATT is required to consult with the International Monetary 
39:1012:70882:27:28:72:529:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Fund (IMF) on all matters involving exchange arrangements and to defer to the IMF’s view on 
39:1013:70974:28:27:72:513:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:such matters.19  The GATT requested and quickly received a report from the IMF about the 
39:1014:71063:27:28:72:541:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:surcharge.  In its report, the IMF stated that “in the absence of other appropriate action and in the 
39:1015:71165:28:28:72:536:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:present circumstances, the import surcharge can be regarded as being within the bounds of what 
39:1016:71260:28:27:72:539:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:is necessary to stop a serious deterioration in the United States balance of payments position. . . . 
39:1017:71362:27:57:72:518:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The import surcharge can be justified as a means of improving the U.S. balance of payments 
39:1018:71453:57:8:216:219:155:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                 
39:1019:71501:8:16:72:538:147:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:19 As Article IV reads, in part:  “In all cases in which the contracting parties are called upon to consider or deal with 
39:1020:71623:16:11:72:539:131:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:problems concerning monetary reserves, balances of payments or foreign exchange arrangements, they shall consult 
39:1021:71736:11:12:72:536:120:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:fully with the International Monetary Fund [and] shall accept the determination of the Fund as to whether action by 
39:1022:71852:12:11:72:504:108:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:a contracting party in exchange matters is in accordance with the Articles of Agreement of the International 
39:1023:71961:11:12:72:538:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Monetary Fund” as well as “the determination of the Fund as to what constitutes a serious decline in the contracting 
39:1024:72078:12:11:72:534:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:party’s monetary reserves, a very low level of its monetary reserves or a reasonable rate of increase in its monetary 
39:1025:72196:11:0:72:173:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:reserves,” and so forth.   
40:1026:72225:0:27:72:540:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:only until it is possible to supplant it by effective action in the exchange rate field” (GATT 1971, 
40:1027:72326:27:28:72:94:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:2).   
40:1028:72332:28:27:108:537:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: Despite the IMF’s finding, the GATT Working Party reached the following conclusion:   
40:1029:72418:27:28:108:535:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:“The Working Party took note of the findings of the IMF and recognized that the United 
40:1030:72505:28:28:108:532:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:States had found itself in a serious balance-of-payments situation which required urgent 
40:1031:72594:28:27:107:525:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:action. While noting the contrary views of the United States, the other members of the 
40:1032:72681:27:28:107:494:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Working Party considered that the surcharge, as a trade restrictive measure, was 
40:1033:72762:28:27:107:539:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:inappropriate given the nature of the United States balance-of-payments situation and the 
40:1034:72852:27:28:107:518:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:undue burden of adjustment placed upon the import account with consequent serious 
40:1035:72934:28:28:107:437:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:effects on the trade of other contracting parties” (GATT 1971, 11).   
40:1036:73004:28:27:71:515:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:The GATT Working Party offered no justification for the conclusion that the surcharge was 
40:1037:73094:27:28:71:536:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:“inappropriate” in light of the IMF’s view that it “can be regarded as being within the bounds of 
40:1038:73192:28:27:71:172:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:what is necessary.”   
40:1039:73214:27:28:107:543:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: The GATT took no further action and the surcharge was lifted just a few months after this 
40:1040:73304:28:28:71:166:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:report was issued.   
40:1041:73325:28:27:71:223:294:144:Times:144:Times:The Domestic Legal Challenge 
40:1042:73354:27:28:107:525:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: The surcharge was also challenged in U.S. courts on the grounds that the president did 
40:1043:73441:28:27:71:461:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:not have the authority under U.S. law to increase import duties (Jackson 1972).   
40:1044:73523:27:28:107:507:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: In February 1972, Yoshida International, a New Jersey based importer of Japanese 
40:1045:73604:28:27:71:540:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:zippers, filed a legal challenge against the surcharge.  The Yoshida suit claimed the president did 
40:1046:73704:27:28:71:533:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:not have the power to impose the import duties and asked for compensation for the duties paid.  
40:1047:73800:28:28:71:542:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Government lawyers argued that the president had such authority on the basis of the Tariff Act of 
40:1048:73898:28:0:71:527:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:1930, the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, and section 5(b) of the Trading with the Enemy Act.   
41:1049:73994:0:27:108:539:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: The problem for the courts was that there was no precedent for the president’s action and 
41:1050:74084:27:28:72:523:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the statutes offered no explicit language about the president’s authority to impose a surcharge 
41:1051:74180:28:27:72:533:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:without Congress’s consent.  The statutory basis for the surcharge in the Tariff Act of 1930 and 
41:1052:74277:27:28:72:527:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 was weak, while the authority granted to the president in the 
41:1053:74371:28:28:71:537:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 was much more general.  This act gave the president broad 
41:1054:74464:28:27:71:484:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:powers, during any period of national emergency, to regulate, prevent, or prohibit the 
41:1055:74551:27:28:71:520:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:importation of any foreign good.  In his official proclamation of the import surcharge, Nixon 
41:1056:74645:28:27:71:542:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:specifically declared the existence of a “national emergency” so that he could invoke section 5(b) 
41:1057:74744:27:28:71:251:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of the Trading with the Enemy Act.   
41:1058:74781:28:28:107:529:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: In July 1974, a three judge panel at the U.S. Customs Court unanimously ruled in favor 
41:1059:74868:28:27:71:540:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of Yoshida (378 F.Supp. 115).  The court issued a summary judgment that nothing in the statutes 
41:1060:74964:27:28:71:526:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:explicitly allowed the president to impose a surcharge and that therefore the revenue collected 
41:1061:75060:28:27:71:521:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:should be returned.  In November 1975, after the government appealed the decision, the U.S. 
41:1062:75152:27:28:71:517:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Court of Customs and Patent Appeals reversed the earlier verdict (526 F.2d 560).  The court 
41:1063:75244:28:27:72:525:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:observed that there was no precedent to rely on because there was nothing in the Trading with 
41:1064:75338:27:28:72:541:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the Enemy Act or its history which authorizes or prohibits the imposition of a surcharge.  Yet the 
41:1065:75437:28:28:72:489:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:court concluded that the power to impose a surcharge as a “regulation” of imports was 
41:1066:75523:28:27:72:207:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:authorized under the act.20   
41:1067:75553:27:28:108:537:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: Before the outcome of the government’s appeal was known, Congress gave the president 
41:1068:75638:28:18:72:536:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the explicit authority to impose an import surcharge in the future.   Section 122 of the Trade Act 
41:1069:75737:18:7:216:219:166:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                 
41:1070:75785:7:16:72:512:159:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:20 In the aftermath of these decisions, the plaintiffs sued in federal district court for the recovery of the import 
41:1071:75902:16:12:72:533:143:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:surcharges that they had paid, arguing that the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals did not have jurisdiction over 
41:1072:76017:12:11:72:520:131:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:the recovery of the surcharge.  However, the district court held that the matter was within the jurisdiction of the 
41:1073:76133:11:12:72:513:120:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Customs Court, holding that while the language of the Trading with the Enemy Act could be construed, “with 
41:1074:76240:12:11:72:510:108:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:difficulty,” to grant district courts the jurisdiction to hear cases concerning the recovery of import duties, that 
41:1075:76356:11:12:72:523:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:interpretation would conflict with other provisions giving the customs courts the sole exclusive jurisdiction over 
41:1076:76471:12:11:72:537:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:such matters.  In 1980, this decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals (Cornet Stores v. Morton, 632 F.2d 96).  
41:1077:76587:11:0:72:532:74:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:The Supreme Court denied a writ of certiorari in April 1981, ending the domestic legal dispute over the surcharge. 
42:1078:76705:0:27:72:515:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:of 1974 granted the president broad authority to impose duties (not to exceed 15 percent) or 
42:1079:76798:27:28:72:535:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:quantitative restrictions, or a combination of the two, for a period of up to 150 days, after which 
42:1080:76898:28:27:72:502:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Congressional authorization would be needed.  The surcharge had to be applied on a non-
42:1081:76985:27:28:72:538:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:discriminatory basis, although the president was also given the authority to impose it on just one 
42:1082:77084:28:28:72:509:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:or two large countries with which the United States had large and persistent trade deficits.  
42:1083:77178:28:27:72:527:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Although this statute has never been invoked, it presumably would prevent any domestic legal 
42:1084:77271:27:28:71:270:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:wrangling over a surcharge in the future. 
42:1085:77313:28:27:71:74:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: 
42:1086:77313:27:28:71:152:488:144:Times:144:Times:6. Conclusion  
42:1087:77327:28:28:107:507:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: President Nixon’s 10 percent import surcharge was a unique event in postwar U.S. 
42:1088:77408:28:27:71:526:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:international economic policy.  The purpose of the surcharge was to get other key countries to 
42:1089:77503:27:28:72:527:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:revalue their currencies, which eventually occurred as a result of the Smithsonian Agreement.  
42:1090:77598:28:27:72:541:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Yet this does not mean that the surcharge was responsible for bringing about the agreement.  The 
42:1091:77695:27:28:72:526:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:closing of the gold window and surcharge set off massive speculation against the dollar which 
42:1092:77789:28:27:72:532:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:dislodged currencies from their official parities; perhaps that was enough without the surcharge 
42:1093:77886:27:28:72:492:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to have brought about the hoped for revaluation.  Furthermore, much of the subsequent 
42:1094:77972:28:28:72:518:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:diplomatic effort was designed at managing the cross exchange rates of European currencies 
42:1095:78063:28:27:72:518:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:relative to the German mark.  France played a key role in these negotiations even though the 
42:1096:78156:27:28:72:541:212:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:dollar-franc rate was not much of an issue and the surcharge was not aimed at France, which was 
42:1097:78252:28:27:72:520:184:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:in fact not very vulnerable to the surcharge anyway.  Therefore, the precise lessons from this 
42:1098:78347:27:28:72:433:157:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:period about the value of the surcharge are likely to remain controversial.   
42:1099:78425:28:28:108:518:129:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: Since 1971, proposals for import surcharges have been resurrected whenever there is 
42:1100:78509:28:0:72:530:101:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:controversy over exchange rates and trade imbalances.  When the U.S. dollar rose dramatically 
43:1101:78606:0:27:72:531:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:on foreign exchange markets in the early 1980s, the idea of an import surcharge was dusted off 
43:1102:78701:27:28:72:508:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:as a way of dealing with the trade deficits and protectionist pressures that the strong dollar 
43:1103:78796:28:27:72:514:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:contributed to.  (Of course, the major difference between 1971 and 1985 was the dollar was 
43:1104:78887:27:28:72:529:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:floating against other currencies and had appreciated due to the policy mix between the United 
43:1105:78982:28:28:72:535:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:States and other countries rather than being stuck in a fixed exchange rate system that no longer 
43:1106:79080:28:27:72:523:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:represented market fundamentals.)  The pressures of the early 1980s led to many proposals in 
43:1107:79173:27:28:72:518:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:Congress to impose import duties on countries running large trade surpluses with the United 
43:1108:79265:28:27:72:120:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:States.21   
43:1109:79277:27:28:108:519:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: This pressure led another Treasury Secretary from Texas, James A. Baker III, to seek 
43:1110:79362:28:28:72:538:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:exchange rate adjustments as a way of defusing domestic pressures for import restrictions.  “The 
43:1111:79459:28:27:72:529:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:disparity between the strong dollar and weak foreign currencies gave foreign competitors a big 
43:1112:79554:27:28:72:539:405:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:advantage over companies in the United States,” Baker (2006, 427) wrote in his memoirs.  “This 
43:1113:79649:28:27:72:539:377:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:contributed to our growing trade deficit and sparked demands for high tariffs, import quotas, and 
43:1114:79747:27:28:72:534:350:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:other protectionist measures.”22  After convincing President Reagan and Federal Reserve Board 
43:1115:79841:28:27:72:491:322:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:chairman Paul Volcker of the merits of a new dollar policy, Baker sought international 
43:1116:79928:27:28:72:504:295:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:cooperation to bring about an orderly decline in the value of the dollar.  As in 1971, other 
43:1117:80021:28:28:72:522:267:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:countries resisted.  But Baker (2006, 429-30) reports, “Our leverage with them was that if we 
43:1118:80115:28:24:72:528:239:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:didn’t act first, the protectionists in Congress would throw up trade barriers.  Auto makers and 
43:1119:80212:24:8:216:219:215:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:                                                 
43:1120:80260:8:16:72:515:207:42:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:21 Because the threat to impose an import surcharge was quite real, a number of studies examined the potential 
43:1121:80371:16:11:71:533:191:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:economic effects of such a move, including Rouslang and Suomela (1985), Abraham, Deardorff, and Stern (1987), 
43:1122:80481:11:12:71:536:180:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:and Eichengreen and Goulder (1991). For example, Abraham, Deardorff, and Stern (1987) used a simulation model 
43:1123:80591:12:11:71:530:168:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:to calculate the effects of a 20 percent surcharge on all imports.  They found that the surcharge would improve the 
43:1124:80707:11:12:71:531:157:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:trade balance, but also lead to an appreciation of the dollar by about 4 percent and generate a welfare loss of about 
43:1125:80825:12:11:71:501:145:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:0.14 percent of GDP.  If focused on Japan, Brazil, South Korea, and Taiwan, the surcharge would lead to a 
43:1126:80931:11:8:71:353:134:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:significant amount of trade diversion and have much smaller effects.   
43:1127:81002:8:18:72:521:126:64:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:22 As Baker (2006, 427) noted:  “We confronted an overvalued dollar, measured against other currencies, and a 
43:1128:81111:18:11:71:540:108:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:trade imbalance that favored the Japanese, Germans, and other trading partners at the expense of U.S. manufacturers 
43:1129:81227:11:12:71:534:97:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:and exporters.  These two economic problems, in turn, had created a big political problem – a protectionist fever in 
43:1130:81344:12:11:71:531:85:100:g_d0_f2:100:g_d0_f2:Congress that grew hotter each time Honda or Mercedes won another customer from the Big Three or another pop

44:1132:81518:0:27:72:488:708:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:other industries were pounding the desks at the White House, Treasury, and Congress, 
44:1133:81603:27:28:72:524:681:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:demanding that something be done to save them from foreign competition, and Congress was 
44:1134:81692:28:27:72:499:653:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:listening.  By late summer, top foreign economic officials had begun to see that we were 
44:1135:81781:27:28:72:537:626:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:serious.”  The result was the Plaza Accord of September 1985 in which foreign countries agreed 
44:1136:81876:28:28:72:527:598:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:to undertake measures that would lift the value of their currencies against the dollar, including 
44:1137:81974:28:27:71:415:570:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:intervening in foreign exchange markets (Henning and Destler 1988).   
44:1138:82044:27:28:107:529:543:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2: More recently, China’s exchange rate policy of allowing only a gradual appreciation of 
44:1139:82131:28:27:71:522:515:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the renminbi against the dollar has sparked controversy.  The degree to which the renminbi is 
44:1140:82225:27:28:72:519:488:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:undervalued remains contested, as well as the appropriateness of trade sanctions in changing 
44:1141:82318:28:28:72:531:460:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:China’s exchange rate policy.  Whether the events of 1971 will be replayed with China playing 
44:1142:82412:28:27:72:250:432:144:g_d0_f2:144:g_d0_f2:the part of Japan remains to be seen.
