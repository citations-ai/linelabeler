2:27:1448:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:Using a matched employer-employee data set of manufacturing plants in three sub-Saharan countries,
2:28:1546:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:I compare the marginal productivity of different categories of workers with the wages they earn. A
2:29:1644:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:methodological contribution is to estimate the firm level production function jointly with the individual
2:30:1749:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:level wage equation using a feasible GLS estimator. The additional information of individual workers
2:31:1849:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:leads to more precise estimates, especially of the wage premiums, and to a more accurate test. The
2:32:1947:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:results indicate that equality holds strongly for the most developed country in the sample (Zimbabwe),
2:33:2049:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:but not at all for the least developed country (Tanzania). Moreover, the breakdown in correct remuneration
2:34:2155:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:in the two least developed countries follows a distinct pattern. On the one hand, wage premiums exceed
2:35:2257:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:productivity premiums for general human capital characteristics (experience and schooling). On the
2:36:2355:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:C:other hand, salaries hardly increase for more firm-specific human capital characteristics (tenure and
2:37:2456:14:28:72:361:448:12:Times:12:Times:C:training), even though these have a clear productivity effect.

3:47:2716:0:37:72:208:707:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:C:1  Introduction
3:48:2731:37:22:72:540:670:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In the textbook economics world, markets are the most efficient institution to allocate scarce
3:49:2825:22:22:72:540:648:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:resources. They clear all the time, equalizing demand and supply, and profit opportunities
3:50:2915:22:21:72:540:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are arbitraged away. In particular, production factors are predicted to be paid the marginal
3:51:3007:21:22:72:540:605:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:productivity of the market clearing factor. In the real world there are frictions, unobservable
3:52:3102:22:22:72:540:583:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:characteristics, adjustment costs, erroneous expectations, and maybe discrimination; all of
3:53:3193:22:21:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:which can distort the market equilibrium away from efficient allocation. This should not nec-
3:54:3286:21:22:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:essarily worry us, economists, as the theory is only intended to be a stylized version of reality.
3:55:3384:22:22:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:However, a systematic gap between costs (wages in our case) and benefits (productivity) can
3:56:3475:22:25:72:383:496:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:provide information about crucial omissions from the theory.
3:57:3535:25:22:86:540:471:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:A well-functioning labor market should perform at least two tasks: matching workers
3:58:3618:22:21:72:540:449:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with firms and setting wages. The ability of the labor market to allocate workers to firms
3:59:3708:21:22:72:540:428:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:or industries with the highest productivity or the best future prospects is of particular
3:60:3797:22:22:72:540:406:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:importance for the likely effect of trade reforms, and this has been studied extensively – see
3:61:3891:22:21:72:540:384:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Pavcnik (2002), Eslava et al. (2004), and Filhoz and Muendler (2006) for studies on Latin
3:62:3980:21:22:72:540:363:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:American countries. Van Biesebroeck (2005) investigates the effectiveness of labor markets
3:63:4070:22:22:72:540:341:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in several African countries, including the three countries studied here, in performing this
3:64:4162:22:25:72:530:319:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:task and finds that the reallocation mechanism is less effective than in the United States.
3:65:4253:25:22:86:540:294:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:A second aspect of labor market efficiency is to determine a wage rate. If labor markets
3:66:4341:22:21:72:540:272:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:function as spot markets with minimal frictions and informational asymmetries, we would
3:67:4428:21:22:72:540:251:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:expect arbitrage to set the remuneration of characteristics at their productivity contribution.
3:68:4523:22:22:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Otherwise, workers are not provided with the proper incentives to invest in human capital
3:69:4612:22:21:72:540:207:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:characteristics, such as schooling or tenure.  While an important issue, it has not been
3:70:4700:21:22:72:540:186:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:studied extensively, largely because of lack of suitable data. Employee surveys do not contain
3:71:4794:22:22:72:540:164:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:information on firm level output and factor inputs necessary to calculate productivity. Data
3:72:4886:22:21:72:540:142:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sets on firms or plants generally lack information on all but a few basic characteristics of the
3:73:4982:21:26:72:124:121:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:workforce.
3:74:4992:26:21:86:540:95:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The contribution of this paper is foremost to provide evidence for three sub-Saharan coun-
3:75:5082:21:0:72:540:74:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tries on the extent to which observed wage premiums for a number of worker characteristics
4:76:5173:0:22:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are equal to the productivity premiums associated with those same characteristics. First, I
4:77:5264:22:22:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:follow the methodology in Hellerstein, Neumark, and Troske (1999) and compare the two
4:78:5349:22:21:72:540:663:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:premiums at the firm level. Here, the nature of the comparison is implicitly between the
4:79:5437:21:22:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:wage bills and output levels of two firms which are identical, except that one firm has a
4:80:5526:22:22:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:workforce with on average one more year of schooling, or a higher fraction of male workers,
4:81:5617:22:21:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:etc. We consider five characteristics: gender, labor market experience, eduction, tenure with
4:82:5710:21:22:72:540:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the current employer, and whether a worker has followed a formal training program. As
4:83:5795:22:22:72:540:555:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:some of the human capital characteristics are influenced by the workers, such as tenure or
4:84:5885:22:25:72:462:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:training, providing workers with the correct investment incentives is crucial.
4:85:5963:25:22:86:540:508:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Labor market frictions are likely to be at least as important in developing countries as in
4:86:6054:22:21:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the more developed countries where most previous studies were conducted. As stressed by
4:87:6141:21:22:72:540:465:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Fafchamps (1997) in the introduction to a symposium on “Markets in Sub-Saharan Africa”,
4:88:6228:22:22:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:one should be careful not to assume outright that markets are efficient, regardless of the
4:89:6318:22:21:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:institutions required to perform their function. I estimate the model for Tanzania, Kenya,
4:90:6408:21:22:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and Zimbabwe. While all three countries are relatively poor, GDP per capita for Zimbabwe
4:91:6496:22:22:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:exceeded that for Tanzania by a factor of five (during the sample period), while Kenya was
4:92:6586:22:25:72:203:356:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:intermediately developed.
4:93:6611:25:22:86:540:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:A second contribution of the paper is to estimate the firm level production function jointly
4:94:6703:22:21:72:540:309:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with the individual level wage equation.  Using the additional information of individual
4:95:6791:21:22:72:540:288:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:workers leads to more precise estimates, especially of the wage premiums, and to a more
4:96:6878:22:22:72:540:266:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:accurate test. We show how to test for equality between wage and productivity premiums
4:97:6964:22:21:72:540:244:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in this context and implement a feasible GLS estimator. While still allowing for correlation
4:98:7056:21:22:72:540:223:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:between the error terms in the wage equation and production function, we additionally
4:99:7141:22:22:72:540:201:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:introduce a random effect in the wage equation that is shared by all workers with a common
4:100:7231:22:25:72:121:179:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:employer.
4:101:7240:25:22:86:540:154:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The main empirical finding is that in Tanzania, the poorest country we consider, the
4:102:7324:22:21:72:540:132:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:wage premiums deviate substantially from the corresponding productivity premiums. The
4:103:7409:21:22:72:540:111:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:gaps between wage and productivity premiums are much smaller, and all are insignificant, in
4:104:7500:22:0:72:540:89:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Zimbabwe. Results for Kenya, an intermediate country in terms of level of development, are
5:105:7591:0:22:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:intermediate: equal remuneration can be rejected for some characteristics (e.g. experience),
5:106:7683:22:22:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:but not for others (e.g. schooling). A test for equality of all wage and productivity premiums
5:107:7777:22:21:72:540:663:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on the firm level estimates yields a p-value of 1% in Tanzania, 18% in Kenya, and 64% in
5:108:7865:21:22:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Zimbabwe. Using the individual level estimates, the corresponding p-values are 0%, 1%, and
5:109:7955:22:25:72:97:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:38%.
5:110:7959:25:22:86:540:595:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Moreover, the breakdown in correct remuneration in the two least developed countries
5:111:8043:22:22:72:540:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:follows a distinct patterns. On the one hand, wage premiums exceed productivity premi-
5:112:8129:22:21:72:540:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ums for general human capital characteristics (experience and schooling).  On the other
5:113:8216:21:22:72:540:530:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:hand, salaries hardly increase for more firm-specific human capital characteristics (tenure
5:114:8307:22:22:72:540:508:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and training), even though these have a clear productivity effect. Equality of the returns
5:115:8397:22:21:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:fails most pronouncedly for the two indicators that capture how a worker’s salary rises over
5:116:8489:21:22:72:539:465:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:his career. Even though productivity rises more with tenure than with experience,1salaries
5:117:8579:22:22:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rise only with experience in Tanzania and much more with experience than with tenure in
5:118:8666:22:21:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Kenya. In contrast, in Zimbabwe workers are predominantly rewarded for tenure, consistent
5:119:8755:21:26:72:274:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with the estimated productivity effects.
5:120:8795:26:21:86:540:374:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Finally, we estimate the gaps between wage and productivity premiums separately for
5:121:8878:21:22:72:540:353:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:firms that report facing international competition and those that do not. While the results
5:122:8969:22:22:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are somewhat noisy, equality of the two returns is always less likely to be rejected for firms
5:123:9063:22:21:72:540:309:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:facing international competition. The difference is most pronounced for labor market expe-
5:124:9153:21:22:72:540:288:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rience: excessive salary increases over workers’ careers, compared to productivity growth,
5:125:9243:22:22:72:540:266:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are more moderate. It points to an additional channel through which international trade

5:127:9362:25:21:86:540:219:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:There are a number of important debates in development economics that would benefit
5:128:9445:21:22:72:540:198:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from a better understanding of the relationship between wages and productivity. First, it
5:129:9534:22:22:72:540:176:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is often argued that more education is a prerequisite for economic growth – see for example
5:130:9625:22:22:72:540:154:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Knight and Sabot (1987). However, the Tanzanian firms in this sample have, on average,
5:131:9711:22:27:72:540:132:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a more educated workforce, but the productivity effects of schooling fall far short of the
5:132:9801:27:15:85:539:105:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:1In some cases, productivity declines less with tenure than with experience, or productivity declines with
5:133:9907:15:12:72:540:90:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:experience, but rises with tenure. Crucial is that, in relative terms, tenure has a more positive effect on
5:134:10014:12:0:72:297:78:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:productivity than experience, in all three countries.
6:135:10068:0:22:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:wage effects.  At the very least, higher education does not translate automatically into
6:136:10156:22:22:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:higher output.  Second, the measurement of productivity growth relies explicitly on the
6:137:10243:22:21:72:540:663:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:equality of relative wages and relative productivity. When labor growth is subtracted from
6:138:10333:21:22:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:output growth, categories of workers are weighed by their wage shares – see for example
6:139:10420:22:22:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Jorgenson and Griliches (1967). If the equality between wages and productivity fails to hold
6:140:10512:22:25:72:503:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:systematically in developing countries, productivity growth measures will be biased.

6:150:11229:22:21:72:540:326:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to Hellerstein et al. (1999). If labor markets are efficient, operate as a spot market, and
6:151:11320:21:22:72:540:305:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:firms minimize costs, the wage premium of a worker should equal its productivity premium.
6:152:11409:22:22:72:540:283:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Barring imperfect information, any difference will be arbitraged away. Both premiums can be
6:153:11500:22:21:72:540:261:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:identified by jointly estimating a wage equation and production function, which characterize

7:179:12344:21:22:72:539:361:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:level. The wage premiums associated with worker characteristics (λ) can be estimated using
7:180:12434:22:22:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a standard wage equation derived from the Mincer (1974) model of human capital. The most
7:181:12522:22:21:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:straightforward estimation strategy is to aggregate the wage equation to the firm level and
7:182:12613:21:25:72:537:296:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:estimate it jointly with the production function – see for example Hellerstein et al. (1999).
7:183:12706:25:22:86:540:271:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Labor researchers have been concerned with a potential bias introduced by unobserved
7:184:12790:22:22:72:540:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:worker ability in the wage equation.  Productivity researchers have estimated production
7:185:12878:22:21:72:540:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:functions controlling explicitly for unobserved productivity differences.  Joint estimation
7:186:12969:21:22:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:should to a large extent alleviate such concerns as the bias works in the same direction in
7:187:13060:22:22:72:540:184:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:both equations. A large component of the unobservables in both equations are expected to
7:188:13148:22:27:72:539:162:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:represent the same factors.3Results in Hellerstein and Neumark (2004) demonstrate that
7:189:13234:27:16:85:539:135:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:2Given sufficiently detailed information on the labor force composition, this assumption can be relaxed.
7:190:13338:16:12:72:540:119:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:In the robustness checks at the end, we allowed for imperfect substitutability between experienced and
7:191:13440:12:8:72:173:107:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:unexperienced workers.
7:192:13462:8:16:85:539:99:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:3See for example Frazer (2001) where this assumption is exploited to control for unobserved ability in the
7:193:13568:16:0:72:137:83:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:wage equation.
8:194:13583:0:22:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the results tend to be relatively unaffected if more sophisticated estimation strategies are
8:195:13675:22:25:72:123:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:employed.
8:196:13684:25:22:86:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Sticking with the earlier example, we now show how one can aggregate an individual wage

8:227:14750:16:12:72:540:108:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:(2004) demonstrate that the qualitative results are very robust to alternative specifications of the production

9:240:15380:22:22:71:539:491:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:worker characteristics into account is limited by the data.  For example, differentiating
9:241:15469:22:21:71:539:469:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:workers by gender (MorF), experience (YorX– young versus high experience) and

9:243:15634:22:22:71:539:426:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:inexperienced, educated males, etc.  Given that we observe a maximum of ten workers
9:244:15717:22:21:71:539:404:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in each firm, the proportion of each category in the firm’s workforce would be estimated

9:247:15972:25:22:86:540:336:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Making three assumptions for each characteristic, or rather three sets of assumptions,
9:248:16058:22:22:71:539:314:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:avoids this type of dimensional problem. For example, if we assume that the relative number
9:249:16149:22:21:71:539:292:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of male to female workers, the relative productivity, and the relative wage by gender are all
9:250:16242:21:22:71:539:271:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:invariant to changes in other characteristics, we can use the full workforce to estimate the
9:251:16334:22:22:71:539:249:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:gender premiums. In effect, this is an independence of irrelevant alternatives assumption on
9:252:16426:22:21:71:539:227:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the relative number of workers and the wage and productivity returns for each characteristic.
9:253:16519:21:40:71:430:206:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In the previous example with three characteristics, this boils down to:

11:346:18945:21:22:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the production function. Estimating with a much larger number of observations, e.g. for
11:347:19032:22:22:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Tanzania with 520 individuals instead of 113 firms, is likely to yield more precise estimates

12:376:20377:0:22:86:540:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The individual wage equation is now estimated jointly with the firm level production
12:377:20461:22:22:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:function.  As in the previous set-up, we still allow the errors in the two equations to be
12:378:20551:22:21:72:540:663:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:correlated.  In addition, we allow for a random effect in the wage equation to take into
12:379:20639:21:22:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:account that errors for employees at the same firm are likely to be correlated. We implement

12:381:20820:22:21:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:transformed wage equation with the production function. Because not all firms have the
12:382:20906:21:22:72:540:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:same number of employees sampled, we have to correct for the unbalancedness of our panel.
12:383:20995:22:22:72:540:555:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:As long as we assume that the reason for unbalancedness is random, not too unlikely for
12:384:21082:22:21:72:540:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:our application, the adjustments are straightforward. All variables in the wage equation are

12:398:21786:21:22:72:540:226:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:characteristics for each employer. Hellerstein et al. (1999) pioneered the approach, jointly

13:408:22578:21:22:72:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ity returns for various worker characteristics. Using more recent 1990 U.S. data, Hellerstein
13:409:22671:22:22:72:540:638:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and Neumark (2004) confirms that the wage gap between males and females exceeds the pro-
13:410:22759:22:21:72:540:616:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ductivity gap. In contrast, the lower wages for blacks is in line with productivity estimates
13:411:22852:21:22:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and even though attaining ‘some college’ education only attracts a 43% wage premium while
13:412:22941:22:22:72:540:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:productivity is 67% higher, the difference is not statistically significant. Similar work for

13:415:23208:22:22:72:540:508:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(1999) also finds that wage premiums for gender and eduction are in line with productivity

13:419:23488:21:22:72:540:418:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are underpaid in Israel. For Norwegian workers with 8 to 15 years of experience, the pro-
13:420:23577:22:22:72:540:396:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ductivity premium exceeds the wage premium, while the opposite is true for workers with
13:421:23664:22:25:72:244:374:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:more than 15 years of experience.
13:422:23697:25:21:86:540:349:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Dearden, Reed, and Van Reenen (2006) focus on the effects of training using an indus-
13:423:23782:21:22:72:540:328:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:try level data set covering the U.K. manufacturing sector. They separately estimate wage
13:424:23870:22:22:72:540:306:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:equations and production functions and find that the productivity effect of training sub-
13:425:23959:22:21:72:540:284:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:stantially exceeds the wage effect, but no formal test is presented. They conclude that the
13:426:24050:21:22:72:540:263:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:usual approach in the literature of quantifying the benefits of training by looking at wages
13:427:24142:22:22:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:underestimates the impact. Another finding is that aggregation to the industry magnifies
13:428:24230:22:25:72:345:219:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the effect of training, potentially due to externalities.

13:431:24470:21:22:72:540:151:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are given regarding the assumptions on the variance-covariance matrix when the individual
13:432:24559:22:22:72:540:129:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and firm level data is combined.8She finds that women are 42% to 62% less productive,
13:433:24644:22:27:72:540:107:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:depending on the specification, and paid 12% to 15% less. No formal test is reported, but
13:434:24733:27:0:85:468:80:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:8We contacted the author to obtain further information, but did not receive a response.
14:435:24822:0:22:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the standard errors are fairly large. Her focus is on the premiums associated with an extra
14:436:24913:22:22:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:year of schooling, which are estimated similarly in the production function and the wage
14:437:25001:22:21:72:540:663:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:equation: both are around 7%. When discrete levels of education attainment are used, the
14:438:25089:21:22:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:results are ambiguous. The differences in point estimates are large, but the education co-
14:439:25179:22:22:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:efficients in the production function are estimated imprecisely and none of the formal tests
14:440:25271:22:25:72:284:598:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:finds a statistically significant difference.9
14:441:25317:25:22:86:540:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Bigsten et al. (2000) gauge the link between wages and productivity indirectly, similar to
14:442:25407:22:21:72:540:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the U.K. analysis. First, they estimate the returns to education in five sub-Saharan countries
14:443:25501:21:22:72:540:530:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:using a wage equation. Then, they separately estimate the production function, including
14:444:25589:22:22:72:540:508:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:lagged levels of education as a proxy for human capital. They find that the implied rate
14:445:25677:22:21:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of return to human capital is very low, in particular it is only a fraction of the return to
14:446:25769:21:55:72:155:465:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:physical capital.

14:449:25802:25:22:72:540:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The three countries included in the sample are middle-sized former British colonies in East
14:450:25893:22:21:72:540:326:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Africa that obtained independence in the early 1960s.10The World Bank classifies all three
14:451:25983:21:22:72:540:305:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:as low income, even though they differ substantially by level of development. One way to
14:452:26071:22:22:72:540:283:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:see this is from GDP per capita, which stood at $477 (in PPP) in Tanzania, less than half of
14:453:26163:22:21:72:540:261:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the $1092 attained in Kenya, and only slightly more than one fifth of the GDP per capita of
14:454:26254:21:22:72:540:240:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Zimbabwe—all figures are for 1991 and reported in Table 1. The differences are smaller on the
14:455:26347:22:22:72:540:218:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:United Nations’ human development index, which also takes education and life expectancy
14:456:26434:22:26:72:540:196:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:into account, but the order is the same. In the most recent ranking, Tanzania occupies the

14:458:26626:16:8:72:311:154:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:the direction of the difference varies by schooling level.
14:459:26684:8:16:81:539:146:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:10Unfortunately, only three countries could be included in the analysis due to data constraints. A partial
14:460:26790:16:12:72:540:130:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:analysis was possible with data from Cameroon (almost as developed as Zimbabwe) and Burundi (even
14:461:26887:12:11:72:540:118:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:less developed than Tanzania), but the sample size is smaller, some variables (e.g. capital) are measured
14:462:26992:11:12:72:540:107:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:less accurately, and other variables (e.g. training in Burundi) are missing. Results for these countries are in
14:463:27103:12:12:72:540:95:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:between the extremes of Tanzania and Zimbabwe. The failure of the equality between wage and productivity
14:464:27207:12:12:72:540:83:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:premiums to hold is much more pronounced in Burundi than in Cameroon: the p-values for the joint test,
14:465:27309:12:0:72:417:71:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:corresponding to the first joint test in Table 3, were respectively 0.03 and 0.22.
15:466:27393:0:22:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:151st (or 22nd last) place with 0.440, putting it in the ”low development” category. Kenya
15:467:27483:22:22:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and Zimbabwe rank rather closely at places 134 and 128, with a score of 0.513 and 0.551,
15:468:27571:22:38:72:358:663:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:near the bottom of the ”medium development” group.11

15:470:27651:38:21:86:540:587:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The different development levels of the countries is also reflected in the share of workers
15:471:27742:21:22:72:540:566:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:employed in industry.12Only 4.7% of all employment in Tanzania is in industry, while it is
15:472:27832:22:22:72:540:544:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:almost twice as high in Zimbabwe (8.6%) and intermediate in Kenya (7.3%). In Tanzania,
15:473:27918:22:21:72:540:522:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the transition from agriculture to other sectors had only just begun: agriculture comprised
15:474:28009:21:22:72:540:501:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:almost half the workforce at the end of the 1990s.  In Kenya, the transformation was in
15:475:28096:22:22:72:540:479:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:full swing: the employment share of agriculture declined from 42% in 1975 to 27.5% by
15:476:28181:22:21:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the sample period. Zimbabwe, on the other hand, has seen a stable 18.5% of its workforce
15:477:28269:21:26:72:302:436:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:employed in agriculture for the last 25 years.
15:478:28315:26:21:86:540:410:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Given that Zimbabwe is much more advanced in its industrial transformation, it is not
15:479:28400:21:22:72:540:389:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:surprising that it far surpasses the other two countries in GDP per capita. The difference in
15:480:28493:22:22:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:labor productivity in industry is even more stark. While industry workers in Kenya produce
15:481:28583:22:21:72:540:345:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:twice as much as Tanzanian workers, Zimbabwe’s output per worker outstrips Tanzania by a
15:482:28671:21:22:72:540:324:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:factor of 7 and Kenya by a factor of 4. It underscores the importance of developing a strong
15:483:28763:22:22:72:540:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:manufacturing sector. World Bank (2000) statistics also show that manufacturing workers
15:484:28850:22:21:72:540:280:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in Tanzania earn 3.5 times more on average than agricultural workers, while the ratio stands
15:485:28942:21:26:72:292:259:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:at 5.7 in Kenya and even 9.9 in Zimbabwe.
15:486:28983:26:21:86:540:233:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Infrastructure statistics confirm the different levels of development of the three countries.
15:487:29076:21:22:72:539:212:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Zimbabwe had 22km of paved highways per 1000 km2of land, while the corresponding
15:488:29156:22:22:72:540:190:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:numbers for Kenya and Tanzania were 15km and 4km. The same ranking is preserved in
15:489:29238:22:21:72:540:168:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:kilometers of railroad by area, at respectively eight, five, and four kilometers, or airports per
15:490:29335:21:22:72:540:147:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:million inhabitants, 1.4 in Zimbabwe, 0.6 in Kenya and 0.3 in Tanzania. In fact, almost any
15:491:29426:22:27:72:540:125:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:conceivable statistic that one expects to be correlated with development produces the same
15:492:29516:27:12:81:384:98:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:11Norway tops the human development ranking with a score of 0.942.
15:493:29582:12:15:81:539:86:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:12Manufacturing employment that corresponds to manufacturing value added was not available for Tan-
15:494:29681:15:0:72:132:71:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:zania in 1991.
16:495:29697:0:22:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ranking: access to clean water, telephone penetration, school enrollments, infant mortality,
16:496:29789:22:25:72:98:685:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:etc.13
16:497:29795:25:22:86:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The three countries also differ substantially in their exposure to international trade. Man-
16:498:29887:22:22:72:540:638:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ufacturing exports as a fraction of domestic production is almost three times higher in
16:499:29974:22:21:72:540:616:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Zimbabwe than in Tanzania, 23.6% versus 8.8%, but almost as high in Kenya. On the im-
16:500:30059:21:22:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:port side, we see that only in Zimbabwe domestic production accounts for half of the total
16:501:30149:22:22:72:540:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:domestic consumption. In the other two countries, approximately three quarters of all man-
16:502:30239:22:21:72:540:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ufacturers consumed are imported. This aggregate trade exposure is reflected in the export
16:503:30329:21:22:72:540:530:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:participation rate for the firms in the sample. The differences are even more pronounced,
16:504:30418:22:22:72:540:508:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:with firms in Zimbabwe more than five times as likely to export than Tanzanian firms. The
16:505:30507:22:21:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:importance of the manufacturing sector in the three countries is well illustrated by the share
16:506:30601:21:22:72:540:465:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of total export earnings accounted for by the manufacturing sector. This rises from a mere
16:507:30691:22:40:72:426:443:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:6.1% in Tanzania, to 20.9% in Kenya, and a full 40.5% in Zimbabwe.
16:508:30757:40:25:72:169:403:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:Firms and workers
16:509:30774:25:22:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In 1991, Tanzania and Kenya each counted approximately 25 million inhabitants, while
16:510:30858:22:21:72:540:356:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Zimbabwe only had 10 million.  The manufacturing sector, which we focus on, is more
16:511:30941:21:22:72:540:335:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:evenly sized because of its greater importance in Zimbabwe. All countries count between
16:512:31028:22:22:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:126,000 and 188,000 manufacturing workers. A stratified sample of manufacturing firms in
16:513:31116:22:21:72:540:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:three consecutive years, provides the micro data used in the analysis.14Approximately 200
16:514:31205:21:22:72:540:270:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:firms were surveyed each year in each country, covering four broadly defined manufacturing
16:515:31295:22:22:72:540:248:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sectors: food, textile and clothing, wood and furniture, metal and equipment. A maximum
16:516:31382:22:21:72:540:226:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of 10 employees per firm were interviewed each year. While firms could be linked over time
16:517:31472:21:22:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:as a panel, this was not possible for the workers. Because questions on training were not
16:518:31561:22:27:72:432:183:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:asked in the third year, we only use the first two years in the analysis.
16:519:31634:27:15:81:539:156:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:13Only life expectancy at birth gives a reverse ranking, but this is due to the staggering HIV infection
16:520:31738:15:9:72:478:141:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:rate, affecting one third of the adult population in Zimbabwe and almost one sixth in Kenya.
16:521:31830:9:15:81:539:132:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:14The data was collected between 1991 and 1995 by three different research teams, coordinated by the
16:522:31930:15:12:72:540:117:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:Regional Program of Enterprise Development at the World Bank. Firms were sampled to give (the firm
16:523:32028:12:12:72:540:105:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:of) each manufacturing worker equal probability to be included in the sample—an implicit stratification by
16:524:32134:12:0:72:147:93:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:employment size.
17:525:32152:0:22:86:540:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The resulting sample is an unbalanced panel of firms with, on average, 110 to 183 ob-
17:526:32237:22:22:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:servations per year in each country. In the first year, the firms employed 19,383 to 58,108
17:527:32328:22:21:72:540:663:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:workers and 619 to 1206 of them were interviewed. A large part of the manufacturing sector
17:528:32418:21:22:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is covered by this sample. The value added produced by the sample firms makes up 31% of
17:529:32505:22:22:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:manufacturing GDP in Tanzania, 17% in Kenya, and 26% in Zimbabwe. The share of all
17:530:32587:22:21:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:manufacturing workers that are employed by firms included in the sample is substantially
17:531:32675:21:22:72:540:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:lower in the first two countries; a result of the higher productivity levels achieved by larger
17:532:32770:22:25:72:101:555:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:firms.
17:533:32776:25:22:86:540:530:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The differences between the countries described earlier are equally apparent when we
17:534:32860:22:22:72:540:508:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:compare the firms in the sample. The median firm in Tanzania achieves only 38% of the
17:535:32945:22:21:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:labor productivity level of the median firm in Kenya, while labor productivity in Zimbabwe is
17:536:33038:21:22:72:540:465:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:42% higher than in Kenya. Total factor productivity numbers, taken from Van Biesebroeck
17:537:33125:22:22:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(2005), show similar differences when capital intensity is taken into account. The median
17:538:33214:22:21:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:firm in Kenya is twice as productive as in Tanzania, but achieves only two thirds of the
17:539:33302:21:22:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:productivity level of the median firm in Zimbabwe.  The salary differences between the
17:540:33388:22:22:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:countries match the labor productivity differences rather well. Workers in Tanzania earn
17:541:33476:22:21:72:540:356:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:27.4% of the average salary in Zimbabwe, while the median labor productivity of their
17:542:33561:21:22:72:540:335:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:employers stands at 26.8%. Salaries in Kenya, on average $120 (in 1991 USD), are slightly
17:543:33650:22:22:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:lower than one would predict from the relative labor productivity, which would imply a
17:544:33736:22:21:72:540:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:salary of approximately $140. The statistics for the sample confirm that Zimbabwe is by far
17:545:33827:21:26:72:474:270:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the most developed country of the three, while Tanzania is lagging far behind.
17:546:33905:26:21:86:540:244:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The remainder of Table 1 provides averages and standard errors for the variables used
17:547:33990:21:22:72:540:223:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the analysis. Workers in Zimbabwe work on average in larger firms, are slightly older,
17:548:34079:22:22:72:540:201:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:stay longer with the same firm and are more likely to receive (or choose to enroll in) formal
17:549:34172:22:21:72:540:179:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:training once they are employed. The sample of workers in Kenya is even more dominated
17:550:34258:21:22:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by males than in the other countries.  In Tanzania, workers receive the lowest salaries,
17:551:34346:22:22:72:540:136:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:but paradoxically they have the highest years of schooling. How these characteristics are
17:552:34435:22:0:72:281:114:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rewarded is analyzed in the next section.
18:553:34478:0:37:72:163:707:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:C:5  Results
18:554:34488:37:22:72:540:670:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The discussion of the estimation results is organized in the same three subsections as the
18:555:34578:22:22:72:540:648:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:earlier discussion of the measurement framework. This is followed by a discussion of a some
18:556:34669:22:32:72:436:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:robustness checks and an analysis of the importance of trade exposure.
18:557:34739:32:26:72:240:594:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:Wage and productivity premiums
18:558:34769:26:21:72:540:568:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Information on productivity is only available at the firm level and, hence, the identification of
18:559:34866:21:22:72:540:547:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the productivity premiums necessarily exploits between-firm variation. For wages, we have
18:560:34955:22:22:72:540:525:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the option to exploit only between-firm variation as well, in which case individual wages
18:561:35044:22:21:72:540:503:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:have to be aggregated to the firm level. Alternatively we can incorporate the information
18:562:35133:21:22:72:540:482:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:contained in the individual wages in the estimation. We will employ both strategies, but first
18:563:35227:22:22:72:540:460:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we look at the wage equation in isolation to verify whether the estimated wage premiums for
18:564:35318:22:21:72:540:438:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:worker characteristics differ in important ways when we limit identification to between-firm
18:565:35410:21:25:72:203:417:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:or within-firm variation.15
18:566:35437:25:22:86:540:392:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Individual wage regressions with least squares capture both variation within and between
18:567:35525:22:22:72:540:370:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:firms; results for the three countries are in the columns labeled “total” in Table 2.  For
18:568:35615:22:21:72:540:348:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:example, the positive salary premium for male workers can be the result of men receiving
18:569:35703:21:22:72:540:327:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on average higher salaries than women within a given firm or men can be disproportionately
18:570:35793:22:22:72:540:305:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:employed in firms that pay higher salaries, a between effect, even without differential pay
18:571:35884:22:21:72:540:283:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:by gender. In the columns labeled “within” and “between”, we separate the two effects.
18:572:35970:21:22:72:540:262:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Within estimates are obtained using the standard fixed effects estimator (including firm-
18:573:36059:22:22:72:540:240:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:year fixed effects) and between estimates are obtain by averaging all variables by firm-year
18:574:36151:22:25:72:247:218:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and estimating with least squares.
18:575:36185:25:22:86:540:193:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:All five characteristics are measured as dummy variables. Experience is coded as one if a
18:576:36274:22:21:72:540:171:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:worker attained more labor market experience than the median (interviewed) worker for the
18:577:36363:21:22:72:540:150:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:country, and tenure is defined similarly. The schooling dummy takes on a value of one if the
18:578:36455:22:27:72:540:128:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:worker has at least attended secondary school, but not necessarily finished it. The training

19:582:36816:0:22:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dummy is switched on for workers who completed a formal training program (excluding
19:583:36899:22:36:72:483:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on-the-job training) after they finished their formal education or apprenticeship.
19:584:36981:36:35:232:379:649:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:[Table 2 approximately here]
19:585:37009:35:22:86:540:614:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The main message from Table 2 is that in all but two cases the between estimates are of
19:586:37096:22:22:72:540:592:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the same sign as the total estimates and in most cases even the magnitudes are very similar.
19:587:37188:22:21:72:540:570:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The only two instances where the signs do not correspond, tenure in Tanzania and gender in
19:588:37278:21:22:72:540:549:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Zimbabwe, the between coefficient is estimated extremely imprecisely and not significantly
19:589:37368:22:22:72:540:527:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:different from zero (the t-values are 0.46 and 0.78). One pattern to note is that for Zimbabwe
19:590:37462:22:21:72:540:505:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:four of the five between estimates exceed the total estimates, with the reverse being true for
19:591:37556:21:22:72:540:484:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the within estimates. At least for Zimbabwe, identifying wage premiums from between-firm
19:592:37644:22:25:72:500:462:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:variation tends to overestimate the unconditional premiums in a sample of workers.
19:593:37726:25:22:86:540:437:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The magnitudes of the wage premiums for different characteristics seem reasonable. Male
19:594:37813:22:22:72:540:415:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:workers earn substantially more, but a gender wage premium of 10.5% to 28.6% is not
19:595:37896:22:21:72:540:393:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:unreasonably large. In the first two countries, the pay differential by gender is larger between
19:596:37992:21:22:72:540:372:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:firms than within, while in Zimbabwe the between estimate surprisingly turns negative. Only
19:597:38083:22:22:72:540:350:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in Zimbabwe are female workers concentrated in higher paying, larger firms. Experience and
19:598:38173:22:21:72:540:328:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:schooling premiums are estimated surprisingly similar in the three countries, especially the
19:599:38265:21:22:72:540:307:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:wage gradient within firms. Differences are more pronounced for tenure and training: for
19:600:38353:22:22:72:540:285:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:both variables, workers in Zimbabwe are rewarded more generously than in the other two
19:601:38439:22:21:72:540:263:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:countries.  The tenure premium in Zimbabwe is exclusively driven by the between effect,
19:602:38526:21:22:72:540:242:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:indicating that salaries do not really increase with tenure, but firms that pay higher salaries
19:603:38621:22:25:72:214:220:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:have lower worker attrition.
19:604:38649:25:22:86:540:195:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:While we could have included occupation controls, we follow the convention in the litera-
19:605:38738:22:22:72:540:173:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ture not to do so. A substantial fraction of the return to human capital characteristics will
19:606:38831:22:39:72:525:151:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:materialize through occupation changes, e.g. promotions, which are surely endogenous.16
19:607:38918:39:26:72:181:112:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:Firm level estimation
19:608:38939:26:15:81:539:86:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:16Results in Van Biesebroeck (2003) illustrate that 28% to 55% of the return to schooling and education
19:609:39042:15:0:72:239:71:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:is associated with occupation changes.
20:610:39082:0:22:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The SUR estimation results for equations (6) and (7) by country, with discretely measured
20:611:39171:22:22:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:worker characteristics, are in Table 3. In this and all following specifications, hours worked
20:612:39265:22:21:72:540:663:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and time, industry, and location dummies are added as controls in both the wage equation
20:613:39353:21:22:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and production function. The production function always has to be estimated at the firm
20:614:39440:22:22:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:level and here we aggregate the wage equation to the same level. Results in the following
20:615:39529:22:21:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:section are for the individual wage equation jointly estimated with the firm production
20:616:39616:21:26:72:339:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:function, which severely complicates the estimation.
20:617:39668:26:21:86:540:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Larger firms tend to pay higher salaries, in line with evidence for many African countries
20:618:39758:21:22:72:540:530:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in Mazumdar and Mazaheri (2002), although the effect is small in Tanzania. The capital
20:619:39844:22:22:72:540:508:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and labor elasticities in the Cobb-Douglas production function are estimated similarly in the
20:620:39937:22:21:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:three countries, with labor somewhat more important in Zimbabwe and the capital coefficient
20:621:40028:21:22:72:540:465:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:highest in Kenya. Returns to scale are moderately increasing in each country. The sum of the
20:622:40120:22:22:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:two input coefficients ranges from 1.041 to 1.141, in line with results for the manufacturing
20:623:40213:22:38:72:415:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sector in other developing countries, as surveyed in Tybout (2000).
20:624:40280:38:38:232:379:383:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:[Table 3 approximately here]
20:625:40308:38:22:86:540:345:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Consistent with the results for the individual wage data in Table 2, we find the highest
20:626:40396:22:21:72:540:323:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:wage premium for males in Tanzania and the estimate in Kenya is approximately 10% lower.
20:627:40484:21:22:72:540:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:However, these salary gaps fall far short of the higher productivity realized by firms that
20:628:40575:22:22:72:540:280:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:employ a high percentage of male workers. The extremely high point estimates on the male
20:629:40663:22:21:72:540:258:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dummy in the production function imply that raising the fraction of males by one standard
20:630:40752:21:22:72:540:237:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:deviation would raise output by 32% in Tanzania, by 40% in Kenya, but only by 2% in
20:631:40835:22:22:72:540:215:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Zimbabwe. Given that wage premiums for males are below the corresponding productivity
20:632:40920:22:21:72:540:193:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:premiums, it suggests that men are underpaid, although none of the differences is statistically
20:633:41015:21:22:72:540:172:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:significant. These estimates are somewhat misleading though, because the majority of firms
20:634:41105:22:22:72:540:150:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the sample employ only male workers. The choice not to employ any female workers is
20:635:41191:22:21:72:540:128:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:undoubtedly related to the line of work a firm carries out. The productivity premium by
20:636:41278:21:22:72:540:107:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:gender is also estimated extremely imprecisely and in the following we will mostly disregard
20:637:41370:22:0:72:173:85:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the gender variable.
21:638:41392:0:22:86:540:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The wage premiums associated with experience are not estimated very precisely either,
21:639:41477:22:22:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:except in Tanzania, but the point estimates again correspond well to the between results
21:640:41565:22:21:72:540:663:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in Table 2; only the return to experience in Zimbabwe is estimated rather low.  Salaries
21:641:41653:21:22:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rise substantially with experience in Tanzania and Kenya, but not in Zimbabwe, where
21:642:41737:22:22:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:education is rewarded higher than in the other two countries.  The impact of experience
21:643:41824:22:21:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the production function follows a peculiar pattern: the relative size of the productivity
21:644:41916:21:22:72:540:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:premiums in the three countries is exactly the opposite of the wage premiums ranking. In the
21:645:42008:22:22:72:540:555:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:country where salaries are most responsive to experience, Tanzania, the productivity of firms
21:646:42101:22:21:72:540:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:drop with the experience/age of the workforce. The country that rewards experience the
21:647:42187:21:22:72:540:512:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:least, Zimbabwe, is the only one where experience is associated with a positive productivity
21:648:42279:22:22:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:effect.  The gap between the wage and productivity premium associated with experience
21:649:42364:22:21:72:540:468:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is more than 50% larger in Kenya than in Zimbabwe, and the gap in Tanzania is almost
21:650:42448:21:22:72:540:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:three times as large as in Zimbabwe. For Tanzania we can reject equality between the two
21:651:42536:22:25:72:431:425:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:premiums at the 1% significance level and for Kenya at the 10% level.
21:652:42605:25:22:86:540:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:For schooling, the size of the productivity premiums follows the same pattern between
21:653:42690:22:22:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:countries as the wage premiums: highest in Zimbabwe, lowest in Kenya, and intermediate in
21:654:42779:22:21:72:540:356:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Tanzania. Still, in the two least developed economies, educated workers are able to secure a
21:655:42871:21:22:72:540:335:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:wage premium that far outstrips the productivity contribution of education. In Zimbabwe,
21:656:42959:22:22:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on the other hand, the difference goes the other way. Similarly as for experience, the gap
21:657:43049:22:21:72:540:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:between the wage and productivity premium associated with schooling is by far the largest
21:658:43138:21:26:72:194:270:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in Tanzania and Kenya.
21:659:43160:26:21:86:540:244:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The tenure variable, which measures whether an employee has stayed more than the
21:660:43240:21:22:72:540:223:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:median number of years with his current employer, is associated with particularly large
21:661:43327:22:22:72:540:201:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:salary increases in Zimbabwe (47%). In the other two countries, salaries do not rise with
21:662:43416:22:21:72:540:179:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tenure, only with experience. Strikingly, in each country the productivity effect of tenure
21:663:43507:21:22:72:540:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:largely exceeds that of experience. The same is true for the training dummy. In the two
21:664:43594:22:22:72:540:136:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:least developed countries, workers that receive training are not paid a higher salary, even
21:665:43685:22:21:72:540:114:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:though training has a large (but imprecisely estimated) effect on productivity. In Zimbabwe,
21:666:43777:21:0:72:449:93:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the wage premium for workers marginally exceeds the productivity effect.
22:667:43851:0:22:86:540:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Combined with the higher wage premium for tenure than for experience, the compensation
22:668:43937:22:22:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:pattern in Zimbabwe is likely to help reduce worker turnover, especially of those valuable
22:669:44027:22:21:72:540:663:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:employees that received training.  This is borne out by a cursory look at the correlation
22:670:44116:21:22:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:between training and tenure at the individual level. Controlling for experience, workers with
22:671:44209:22:22:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a longer tenure are more likely to have completed a training program. On average, workers
22:672:44298:22:21:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that have completed training were employed for half a year longer at their current employer.
22:673:44390:21:26:72:506:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The relationship is particularly strong in Zimbabwe, but hardly noticeable in Kenya.
22:674:44474:26:21:86:540:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:A joint test for the hypothesis that for the four variables that determine the level of
22:675:44561:21:22:72:540:530:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:human capital in a firm (experience, schooling, tenure, and training) wage premiums equal
22:676:44650:22:22:72:540:508:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:productivity premiums is rejected for Tanzania at the 1% significance level. For Kenya, it
22:677:44740:22:21:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:can only be rejected if we are willing to tolerate a 23% significance level. The hypothesis
22:678:44831:21:22:72:540:465:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:can never be rejected for Zimbabwe as the p-value is 73%. The tests follow the same pattern
22:679:44922:22:22:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:if we include the male dummy, with the p-value somewhat lower for Kenya and even higher
22:680:45009:22:25:72:145:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for Zimbabwe.
22:681:45022:25:22:86:540:396:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Performing separate tests for the firm-specific aspects of human capital (tenure and train-
22:682:45113:22:21:72:540:374:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ing) and general human capital (experience and schooling) points to the general characteris-
22:683:45205:21:22:72:540:353:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tics driving the correlation between equality of returns and development level of the country.
22:684:45299:22:22:72:540:331:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Firms in all three countries are rewarding firm-specific characteristics more closely in pro-
22:685:45392:22:21:72:540:309:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:portion to the productivity gains they bring. The p-values on these joint tests are always
22:686:45482:21:22:72:540:288:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:high, although it should be noted that the effects are estimated especially imprecisely for
22:687:45573:22:25:72:181:266:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Tanzania and Kenya.
22:688:45592:25:22:86:540:241:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:In contrast, the differences between countries are especially stark for general human capital
22:689:45685:22:21:72:540:219:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:characteristics. The p-value is 0.00 for Tanzania, 0.15 for Kenya, and 0.72 for Zimbabwe.
22:690:45774:21:22:72:540:198:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Grouping characteristics differently—schooling and training (learning), on the one hand,
22:691:45862:22:22:72:540:176:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and experience and tenure (over time), on the other—points again to the importance of
22:692:45947:22:22:72:540:154:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:experience. The underlying tendency is for salaries to increase over time with experience
22:693:46036:22:21:72:540:132:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in Tanzania and Kenya and with tenure in Zimbabwe, while productivity is more closely
22:694:46121:21:25:72:342:111:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:related to tenure than to experience in each country.
22:695:46174:25:0:86:540:86:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Even at the firm level, coefficients on the worker characteristics are estimated more pre-
23:696:46266:0:22:72:539:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:cisely in the wage equation than in the production function, although the R2tends to be
23:697:46353:22:22:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:higher in the latter. Comparing the different countries, standard errors are somewhat larger
23:698:46445:22:21:72:540:663:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for Zimbabwe than for Kenya or Tanzania. However, the coefficient estimates also tend to
23:699:46533:21:22:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:be larger (in absolute value) for Zimbabwe, with the exception of the male and training
23:700:46620:22:22:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:dummies even uniformly so. While the average t-statistic in the wage equation is somewhat
23:701:46709:22:21:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:higher in Tanzania (1.93) and Kenya (1.56) than in Zimbabwe (1.48), the average t-statistic
23:702:46800:21:22:72:540:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the production function is highest in Zimbabwe (1.26) than in Tanzania (1.00) or Kenya
23:703:46889:22:22:72:540:555:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:(0.92). Only for the male dummy is the t-statistic in Zimbabwe below those in the other two
23:704:46980:22:21:72:540:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:countries. There is thus no evidence that the higher p-values for Zimbabwe are simply due
23:705:47069:21:40:72:288:512:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to more imprecisely estimated coefficients.
23:706:47112:40:25:72:207:472:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:Individual level estimation
23:707:47139:25:22:72:540:447:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:While the joint tests at the bottom of Table 3 for the results at the firm level showed a clear
23:708:47234:22:22:72:540:425:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:pattern, many of the wage and productivity premiums were estimated imprecisely. Incor-
23:709:47320:22:21:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:porating the information on individual employees avoids aggregation of the wage equation
23:710:47408:21:22:72:540:382:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and is likely to improve precision, especially for the wage premiums. The estimation results
23:711:47500:22:22:72:540:360:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:using the wage equation at the individual level with the methodology outlined previously,
23:712:47589:22:21:72:540:338:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are in Table 4. The increase in precision is very large for all coefficients in the wage equation:
23:713:47687:21:22:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:on average, standard errors have decreased by a factor of three. The production function
23:714:47775:22:22:72:540:295:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:coefficients are estimated more precisely as well, especially in Tanzania. While all firms were
23:715:47870:22:21:72:540:273:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:treated identically in the firm level estimation, the current results implicitly weigh firms by
23:716:47965:21:22:72:540:252:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the number of employees that are sampled, which partly explains the nonnegligible changes
23:717:48054:22:36:72:281:230:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the point estimates of both equations.
23:718:48095:36:37:232:379:194:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:[Table 4 approximately here]
23:719:48123:37:21:86:540:157:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The labor and capital coefficients have changed the least; only the results for Tanzania
23:720:48211:21:22:72:540:136:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are somewhat closer to those for Kenya and Zimbabwe. In the wage equation, all premiums
23:721:48298:22:22:72:540:114:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are now estimated positively, in line with our priors.  While most of the point estimates
23:722:48387:22:21:72:540:92:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for Tanzania and Zimbabwe are slightly lower in absolute value than before, the estimates
23:723:48476:21:0:72:540:71:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for Kenya are slightly higher for most coefficients. With only a couple of exceptions the
24:724:48567:0:22:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:returns to worker characteristics in the production function are estimated lower than before
24:725:48659:22:25:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in absolute value. The relative position of the countries, however, is by and large unchanged.
24:726:48753:25:22:86:540:660:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The average size of (the absolute value of) the gap between wage and productivity premi-
24:727:48841:22:22:72:540:638:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ums in Tanzania went from 61.2% for the firm level results to 49.3% for the individual results,
24:728:48936:22:21:72:540:616:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:from 67.6% to 22.7% in Kenya, and from 26.0% to 24.1% in Zimbabwe. Even though the
24:729:49018:21:22:72:540:595:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:absolute value of the differences declined, the standard errors declined even more, resulting
24:730:49111:22:22:72:540:573:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in more of the gaps being significantly different from zero. The same joint tests as before
24:731:49202:22:25:72:477:551:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:yield almost uniformly lower p-values, see the results at the bottom of Table 4.
24:732:49282:25:22:86:540:526:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The rejection of equality of the wage and productivity premiums for Tanzania is as strong
24:733:49371:22:21:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:as before, but not solely due to experience anymore.  The t-statistic associated with the
24:734:49460:21:22:72:540:483:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:‘excess return’ to experience is now 10.5, but the ‘excess return’ to schooling now also
24:735:49548:22:22:72:540:461:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:yields a t-statistic of 6.1. Moreover, the direction of the differences are the same as before:
24:736:49643:22:21:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:experience and schooling are over-rewarded, while tenure and training are under-rewarded,
24:737:49732:21:22:72:540:418:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:although not significantly so. The same is true for Kenya, but less pronouncedly. Only one
24:738:49822:22:22:72:540:396:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:general human capital characteristic is clearly over-rewarded, experience, and only training
24:739:49914:22:21:72:540:374:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:receives a salary premium below the productivity effect, although the gap is not statistically
24:740:50008:21:25:72:127:353:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:significant.
24:741:50020:25:22:86:540:328:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Results for Zimbabwe are by and large similar as before, although the standard errors in
24:742:50108:22:22:72:540:306:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the wage equation are somewhat higher than in the other two countries. The average size of
24:743:50198:22:21:72:540:284:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the gap between wage and productivity premiums is still the lowest of the three countries, at
24:744:50291:21:22:72:540:263:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:least if we exclude gender, but the lower precision makes the tests less powerful in Zimbabwe.
24:745:50385:22:22:72:540:241:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In contrast with the other two countries, the only two characteristics for which the gap is
24:746:50476:22:21:72:540:219:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:more than 10% are schooling and tenure, and both are rewarded below their contribution to
24:747:50565:21:40:72:137:198:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:productivity.
24:748:50578:40:25:72:164:158:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:Robustness checks
24:749:50595:25:22:72:540:133:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The working paper version of the paper contains a number of sensitivity analyses that demon-
24:750:50687:22:22:72:540:111:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:strate the robustness of the results—see Van Biesebroeck (2003) for details. First, the find-
24:751:50780:22:0:72:540:89:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:ings are very similar using continuous measures (years) of experience, tenure, and schooling.
25:752:50875:0:22:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In the two least developed countries, workers are still estimated to secure substantial pay
25:753:50966:22:22:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:increases over their career, which are not matched by any discernible productivity effect.
25:754:51056:22:21:72:540:663:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:The wage return to schooling also exceeds its effect on productivity in each country, but
25:755:51145:21:22:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the extent differs widely. As before, the ‘excess returns’ (the gap between the salary and
25:756:51235:22:22:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:productivity premiums) for experience and schooling are highest in Tanzania, at respectively
25:757:51327:22:21:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:4.8% per year of labor market experience and 6.0% per year of education; and the gaps are
25:758:51416:21:22:72:540:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sizeable in Kenya as well, at 2.8% and 3.3%. In Zimbabwe, the gaps are only 0.3% and 1.2%,
25:759:51506:22:22:72:540:555:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and formal statistical tests do not reject equality of the returns (p-values are 0.81 and 0.75).
25:760:51602:22:21:72:540:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In the two least developed countries, equality of the returns to experience can be firmly
25:761:51691:21:22:72:540:512:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:rejected, even at a 1% significance level. The same holds for schooling in Tanzania (albeit
25:762:51782:22:25:72:335:490:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:only at a 10% significance level), but not in Kenya.
25:763:51834:25:22:86:540:465:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Second, given that the rejection of equality between wage and productivity premiums in
25:764:51920:22:22:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Tanzania and Kenya is to a large extent driven by the experience premiums, we have re-
25:765:52006:22:21:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:estimated the model relaxing the assumption that workers with high and low experience are
25:766:52095:21:22:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:perfect substitutes. We introduce two separate labor aggregates ( ̃LXand ̃LY) in the model;
25:767:52186:22:22:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:each is adjusted by multiplicative factors to control for the other worker characteristics—
25:768:52277:22:21:72:539:356:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:as in equation (5).17To be as flexible as possible on the production side, we adopted a
25:769:52364:21:22:72:540:335:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:C.E.S. specification, which allows not only the weight on each labor aggregate, but also the
25:770:52456:22:22:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:elasticity of substitution between the two aggregates to be determined by the data. This
25:771:52544:22:21:72:540:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:requires a modification in the test for equality between the two premiums, but we refer to
25:772:52634:21:22:72:540:270:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Van Biesebroeck (2003) (Section 7.2) for details. The results are qualitatively similar to the
25:773:52728:22:22:72:540:248:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:results in Table 3, which assume perfect substitutability. This is not surprising given that
25:774:52820:22:21:72:540:226:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the estimates for the elasticity of substitution between young and experienced workers are
25:775:52910:21:22:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:relatively high: 3.0 for Kenya, 6.3 for Tanzania, and infinity for Zimbabwe. The p-value on
25:776:53001:22:25:72:348:183:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the joint test for Kenya is even lower than in Table 3.
25:777:53056:25:22:86:540:158:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Third, even though we did not observe the entire workforce for most firms, we could
25:778:53139:22:27:72:540:136:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:proceed with the estimation by using the sample of observed employees to estimate the
25:779:53224:27:15:81:539:109:7:g_d0_f4:10:g_d0_f5:F:17Data limitations force us to still use the entire workforce to estimate the fraction of male workers, highly
25:780:53334:15:12:72:540:94:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:educated workers, etc. In principle, it is possible to let the ratio of male workers as well as the wage and
25:781:53442:12:0:72:401:82:10:g_d0_f5:10:g_d0_f5:F:productivity premiums associated with gender vary by experience category.
26:782:53517:0:22:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:fraction of male, educated, etc. workers at each firm. While these are estimated quantities,
26:783:53609:22:22:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:we have treated them as the true means.  Van Biesebroeck (2003) reports results from
26:784:53693:22:21:72:540:663:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:two Monte Carlo exercises that investigate how sensitive the findings are to the noise that
26:785:53784:21:22:72:540:642:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:enters the estimation procedure in this way. A first exercise repeatedly samples for each
26:786:53873:22:22:72:540:620:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:firm a different sample of employees from the hypothetical workforce (as implied by the
26:787:53960:22:21:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:estimated means) and proceeds with the estimation as before. A second exercise uses Bayes’
26:788:54050:21:22:72:540:577:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:law (based on the estimated means) to assign probabilities to randomly generated values
26:789:54137:22:22:72:540:555:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for each characteristic. These probabilities are then used as weights in the SUR regression
26:790:54228:22:25:72:438:533:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:where each firm is assigned randomly generated average characteristics.
26:791:54299:25:22:86:540:508:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:For both exercises, the average p-values are slightly below the p-values for Tanzania
26:792:54384:22:21:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:and Kenya in Table 3, rejecting equality strongly. In the second exercise, the p-value for
26:793:54474:21:22:72:540:465:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Zimbabwe is much reduced, although it remains more than twice as high as the one for Kenya.
26:794:54565:22:22:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:Given that on average a smaller fraction of each firm’s workforce is sampled in Zimbabwe,
26:795:54654:22:21:72:540:421:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:it was expected that sampling would introduce greater variation for Zimbabwe. Still, the
26:796:54742:21:22:72:540:400:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:qualitative finding that ‘the likelihood of rejecting equality between wage and productivity
26:797:54834:22:40:72:414:378:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:premiums is decreasing with the level of development’ still applies.
26:798:54902:40:25:72:148:338:12:g_d0_f6:12:g_d0_f6:C:Trade exposure
26:799:54916:25:22:72:540:313:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:In addition to the differences between countries, there are bound to be differences between
26:800:55007:22:21:72:540:291:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:individual firms within each country. One crucial distinction between firms is to what ex-
26:801:55097:21:22:72:540:270:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:tent they are exposed to competition from foreign firms. Firms that operate in a highly
26:802:55184:22:22:72:540:248:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:competitive product environment might also have to compete harder on the labor market to
26:803:55272:22:21:72:540:226:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:attract good employees. To export successfully, firms need a high quality product, possibly
26:804:55363:21:22:72:540:205:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:requiring more highly skilled workers. To survive in an industry facing a lot of import com-
26:805:55455:22:22:72:540:183:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:petition, producing efficiently is crucial and investments in human capital might be one way
26:806:55547:22:21:72:540:161:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to achieve process innovations. In any case, strong competition in the output market will
26:807:55636:21:22:72:540:140:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:make it harder to offer wage premiums for worker characteristics that do not contribute to
26:808:55726:22:25:72:137:118:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:productivity.
26:809:55739:25:22:86:540:93:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Results in Table 5 are for two sub-samples that pool firms from all countries, but separate
26:810:55830:22:0:72:540:71:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:firms that face international competition from those that do not. Firms ‘exposed to trade’
27:811:55922:0:22:72:540:707:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are those that exported, or that indicated that the main source of competition they faced
27:812:56011:22:22:72:540:685:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:was from (i) imported goods, from (ii) local production by foreign or multinational firms, or
27:813:56104:22:38:72:295:663:12:g_d0_f2:8:g_d0_f3:B:from (iii) foreign firms on export markets.18
27:814:56149:38:38:232:379:625:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:[Table 5 approximately here]
27:815:56177:38:22:86:540:587:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Results using the firm level estimator are reported in the first two columns of Table 5.
27:816:56265:22:21:72:540:565:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:To conserve space, the ‘excess returns’, the difference between the wage and productivity
27:817:56354:21:22:72:540:544:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:premiums, are reported directly.  The pattern is clearcut.  Firms that face international
27:818:56443:22:22:72:540:522:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:competition reward characteristics more in line with the productivity contributions they
27:819:56531:22:21:72:540:500:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:make. The average gap between wage and productivity premiums, even excluding the male
27:820:56616:21:22:72:540:479:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:premium, is 58.2% for firms that do not face international competition and 45.4% for firms
27:821:56706:22:22:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:that do. Even though the standard errors are somewhat smaller for the latter firms, the tests
27:822:56799:22:25:72:540:435:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:indicate that rejection of equality is more likely for firms not facing international competition.
27:823:56897:25:22:86:540:410:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:The comparable average gap for the results with the individual level estimator, reported
27:824:56985:22:21:72:540:388:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:in the last two columns of Table 5, is 39.5% for domestically oriented firms and 25.1% for
27:825:57075:21:22:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:firms competing with foreigners. The tests for equality are not very different for the two
27:826:57165:22:22:72:540:345:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:samples, although p-values are always lower for the domestically oriented firms.  This is
27:827:57254:22:21:72:540:323:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:mostly due to the much smaller gap for experience for firms exposed to trade. Using either
27:828:57344:21:22:72:540:302:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:estimation method, firms competing with foreigners are especially likely to equate wage to
27:829:57434:22:22:72:540:280:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:productivity premiums for the firm-specific characteristics, tenure and training. Given that
27:830:57526:22:21:72:540:258:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:these are controlled by the employee and can be adjusted over one’s career, incentives will
27:831:57617:21:22:72:540:237:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:be more appropriate for employees of these firms. While the results in Table 5 are somewhat
27:832:57708:22:22:72:540:215:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:sensitive to the controls included and to the way the samples are divided, it does provide
27:833:57798:22:27:72:325:193:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:some evidence for the importance of competition.

28:836:57985:0:37:72:201:707:17:g_d0_f1:17:g_d0_f1:C:6  Conclusions
28:837:57999:37:22:72:540:670:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:A couple of findings are worth reiterating. First, wage premiums for a number of character-
28:838:58090:22:22:72:540:648:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:istics do not always match productivity contributions and this failure is more pronounced
28:839:58179:22:21:72:540:626:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:for some countries than for other. Second, a lot of attention in the development literature
28:840:58270:21:22:72:540:605:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:is devoted to education.  Rightfully so, because the returns in higher salary and output
28:841:58358:22:22:72:540:583:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:are important and we only capture a fraction of them in this analysis. It is nevertheless
28:842:58447:22:21:72:540:561:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:of concern that the wage increases associated with more education significantly exceed the
28:843:58537:21:22:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:productivity gains they bring in the least developed countries. On the other hand, it should
28:844:58629:22:22:72:540:518:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:be stressed that the returns to education—privately and to the employers—are highest in
28:845:58716:22:21:72:540:496:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:the most developed country. Third, a crucial aspect of remuneration is the trade-off between
28:846:58808:21:22:72:540:475:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:paying workers for general experience versus firm-specific tenure.  This mirrors a similar
28:847:58898:22:22:72:540:453:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:trade-off between pre-employment education and subsequent training. In Tanzania, and to
28:848:58985:22:21:72:540:431:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:a lesser extent in Kenya, general skills (experience and schooling) are rewarded relatively
28:849:59076:21:22:72:540:410:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:more than firm-specific skills (tenure and training). In Zimbabwe, wage premiums match the
28:850:59166:22:22:72:540:388:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:productivity gains that are associated with them more closely, and interestingly, the returns
28:851:59259:22:21:72:540:366:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:to firm-specific investments are higher than in the other countries. Fourth, we offer some
28:852:59349:21:22:72:540:345:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:suggestive evidence that firms facing higher product market competition are more likely to
28:853:59439:22:25:72:411:323:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:reward characteristics in line with their productivity contribution.
28:854:59507:25:22:86:540:298:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:A:Data quality is often a concern when working with surveys from developing countries.
28:855:59591:22:22:72:540:276:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:As mentioned earlier, data issues have limited us to look at only three countries and at a
28:856:59681:22:21:72:540:254:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:limited set of human capital characteristics. It is our hope that these findings are sufficiently
28:857:59778:21:22:72:540:233:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:interesting to spur other researchers to check their robustness with other data sources and
28:858:59869:22:0:72:295:211:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f2:B:qualify and refine the results where needed.
