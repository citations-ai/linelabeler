2:35:2010:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:Measures  of  economic  uncertainty  are  countercyclical,  but  economic  theory  does  not  provide 
2:36:2112:14:14:72:545:574:12:Times:12:Times:definite guidance on the direction of causation between uncertainty and the business cycle. This 
2:37:2208:14:14:72:545:560:12:Times:12:Times:paper  proposes a  new  multi-country  approach  to  the  analysis  of  the  interaction  between 
2:38:2305:14:14:72:545:546:12:Times:12:Times:uncertainty  and  economic activity,  without  a  priori  restricting  the  direction  of  causality.  We 
2:39:2410:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:develop  a  multi-country  version of  the  Lucas  tree  model  with  time-varying  volatility  and  show 
2:40:2515:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:that in addition to common technology shocks that affect output growth, higher-order moments of 
2:41:2610:14:14:72:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:technology  shocks  are  also  required  to  explain the  cross  country  variations  of  the  realized 
2:42:2713:14:14:71:545:490:12:Times:12:Times:volatility  of  equity returns.  Using  this  theoretical  insight, two  common  factors,  a  ‘real’  and  a 
2:43:2821:14:14:71:542:476:12:Times:12:Times:‘financial’  one,  are  identified  in  the  empirical  analysis  assuming different  patterns  of  cross-
2:44:2926:14:14:71:546:462:12:Times:12:Times:country  correlations  of  country-specific  innovations  to  real  GDP  growth and  realized  stock 
2:45:3026:14:14:71:545:448:12:Times:12:Times:market volatility. We then quantify the absolute and the relative importance of the common factor 
2:46:3123:14:14:71:546:434:12:Times:12:Times:shocks as well as country-specific volatility and GDP growth shocks. The paper highlights three 
2:47:3218:14:14:72:545:420:12:Times:12:g_d0_f1:main  empirical  findings.  First,  it  is  shown  that  most  of  the  unconditional  correlation  between 
2:48:3325:14:14:72:546:406:12:Times:12:Times:volatility  and  growth  can  be  accounted  for  by  the  real  common  factor,  which  is  proportional  to 
2:49:3435:14:14:72:545:392:12:Times:12:Times:world growth  in  our  empirical  model  and  linked  to  the  risk-free  rate.  Second,  the  share  of 
2:50:3539:14:14:72:545:378:12:Times:12:Times:volatility  forecast error  variance  explained  by  the  real  common  factor  and  by  country-specific 
2:51:3644:14:14:71:545:364:12:Times:12:Times:growth  shocks  amounts to  less  than  5  percent.  Third,  shocks  to  the  common  financial  factor 
2:52:3747:14:14:71:546:350:12:Times:12:Times:explain about 10 percent of the growth forecast error variance, but when such shocks occur, their 
2:53:3844:14:14:71:545:336:12:Times:12:Times:negative  impact  on  growth  is  large and  persistent.  In  contrast,  country-specific  volatility  shocks 
2:54:3953:14:28:71:409:322:12:Times:12:Times:account for less than 1-2 percent of the growth forecast error variance.

3:70:4318:0:34:79:192:709:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:1    Introduction
3:71:4335:34:21:79:533:675:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:It is well-established that empirical measures of uncertainty behave countercyclically in the US
3:72:4431:21:20:79:532:654:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and  most  other  countries.1This  negative  correlation  can  be  seen  in  Figure  1  which  shows
3:73:4531:20:20:79:533:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the country-specific contemporaneous correlations between stock market realized volatility and
3:74:4625:20:21:79:533:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:real GDP growth for all countries in our panel together with their 95-percent error band.  As
3:75:4718:21:20:79:533:593:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:can  be  seen,  for  most  countries,  there  is  a  strong  negative  association  between  volatility  and
3:76:4826:20:20:79:532:573:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:GDP growth.  On average, this correlation is about−0.3, ranging from a maximum of slightly
3:77:4916:20:21:79:532:553:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:more than−0.5 for Argentina to a minimum of just above zero for Peru.  These correlations
3:78:5005:21:20:79:533:532:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:are statistically significant in the case of most countries, with the exception of Austria, China,
3:79:5103:20:47:79:245:512:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Indonesia, Peru, and South Africa.

3:86:5686:11:11:84:526:254:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:(64) in Section 5 for a definition of realized volatility at quarterly frequency and Section 6 for a description of
3:87:5801:11:32:84:260:243:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:the data.  Sample period:  1993:Q1-2011:Q2.
3:88:5844:32:20:96:533:211:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Interpreting  correlations  in  economic  terms  is  difficult  because  causation  can  run  in  both
3:89:5946:20:20:79:533:191:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:directions.  From a theoretical standpoint, uncertainty can cause economic activity to slowdown
3:90:6041:20:21:79:533:171:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and even contract through a variety of mechanisms, both on the household side via precaution-
3:91:6134:21:16:79:533:150:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:ary savings (Kimball, 1990) and on the firm side via investment delays or other forms of frictions
3:92:6232:16:15:91:532:134:6:g_d0_f12:9:g_d0_f11:1For the evidence on the US see,  for example,  Schwert (1989a) and Schwert (1989b) using the volatility of
3:93:6339:15:11:79:533:119:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:aggregate stock market returns; Campbell et al. (2001), Bloom et al. (2007), and Gilchrist et al. (2013) using the
3:94:6453:11:11:79:533:108:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:volatility of firm-level stock returns;  Bloom et al. (2012) and Bachmann and Bayer (2013) using the volatility
3:95:6564:11:11:79:533:97:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:of plant, firm, industry and aggregate output and productivity; Popescu and Smets (2010) and Bachmann et al.
3:96:6672:11:11:79:533:86:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:(2013) using the behavior of expectations’ disagreement.  For the evidence on other countries see, for instance,
3:97:6784:11:0:79:458:75:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:Baker and Bloom (2013), Carriere-Swallow and Cespedes (2013), and Nakamura et al. (2017).
4:98:6874:0:21:79:533:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(see for instance Bernanke (1983), Dixit and Pindyck (1994) and, more recently, Bloom (2009)),
4:99:6968:21:20:79:532:688:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:or financial frictions (Christiano et al., 2014, Gilchrist et al., 2013, Arellano et al., 2012).2But
4:100:7068:20:20:79:533:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:it is also possible that uncertainty responds to fluctuations in economic activity.  For instance,
4:101:7166:20:21:79:533:648:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Bansal et al. (2005) show that fluctuations in expected growth directly affect asset valuations,
4:102:7262:21:20:79:533:627:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and information regarding future expected growth is encoded in current asset valuations.  In-
4:103:7355:20:20:79:533:607:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:deed, the theoretical literature highlights mechanisms through which spikes in uncertainty may
4:104:7449:20:21:79:533:587:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:be  the  result  of  adverse  economic  conditions.   Examples  based  on  information  and  financial
4:105:7551:21:20:79:533:566:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:frictions include Van Nieuwerburgh and Veldkamp (2006), Fostel and Geanakoplos (2012), and
4:106:7641:20:20:79:532:546:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Ilut  et  al.  (2017).3Theory,  therefore,  does  not  provide  a  definite  guidance  as  how  to  inter-
4:107:7747:20:21:79:533:526:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:pret the countercyclical nature of empirical measures of uncertainty.  In this paper, we employ a
4:108:7844:21:20:79:533:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:multi-country approach to the analysis of interaction between uncertainty and economic activity,
4:109:7940:20:23:79:383:485:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:without restricting the direction of economic causation apriori.
4:110:8004:23:21:96:533:462:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We first develop a simple multi-country version of the Lucas (1978) tree model with time-
4:111:8093:21:20:79:533:441:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:varying volatility in which output or dividend growth rates are determined by a global technology
4:112:8190:20:20:79:533:421:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(or global growth) factor.  We show that country-specific equity returns are driven by two shocks,
4:113:8288:20:20:79:533:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the first being the innovation to the global technology factor and the second being the innovation
4:114:8386:20:21:79:533:381:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to  its  volatility.   In  effect,  we  develop  a  consumption-based  international  asset  pricing  model
4:115:8493:21:20:79:533:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:where at least two factors are needed to explain the cross country differences of equity returns,
4:116:8590:20:23:79:529:340:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:even though only one factor is sufficient to explain cross country differences in output growth.
4:117:8686:23:21:96:533:317:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:This theoretical insight forms the basis of our econometric identification strategy.  We mea-
4:118:8779:21:20:79:533:296:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:sure uncertainty and activity with realized equity market volatility and real GDP growth, and
4:119:8872:20:20:79:533:276:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:assume that volatility and growth can be driven by two common factors,  as well as country-
4:120:8963:20:21:79:533:256:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:specific volatility and growth shocks.  We identify the two common factors by assuming that
4:121:9054:21:20:79:533:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:innovations  to  volatility  and  growth  have  different  patterns  of  correlations  across  countries.
4:122:9159:20:20:79:533:215:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Specifically, we suppose that one of the factors, which we label as “real”, is sufficient to model
4:123:9257:20:21:79:532:195:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:cross-countrycorrelationsof  output  growth  innovations,  but  a  second  factor,  which  we  label
4:124:9357:21:15:79:533:174:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:as “financial”, is also needed to model the cross-countrycorrelationsof volatility innovations.
4:125:9452:15:15:91:532:159:6:g_d0_f12:9:g_d0_f11:2Pricing frictions and the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates can also amplify the impact of a volatility
4:126:9565:15:7:79:461:144:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:shock (Fernandez-Villaverde et al. (2011), Basu and Bundick (2017), Born and Pfeifer (2014)).
4:127:9658:7:15:91:532:137:6:g_d0_f12:9:g_d0_f11:3Theoretically, the impact of uncertainty on activity could even be positive.  For example Mirman (1971) shows
4:128:9768:15:11:79:533:122:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:that, if there is a precautionary motive for savings, then higher volatility would lead to higher investments.  Oi
4:129:9882:11:11:79:533:111:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:(1961), Hartman (1976) and Abel (1983) show that if labor can be freely adjusted, the marginal revenue product
4:130:9992:11:11:79:533:100:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:of capital is convex in price; in this case, uncertainty may increase the level of the capital stock and, therefore,
4:131:10108:11:0:79:529:89:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:investment.  However, these theories are not consistent with the countercyclical nature of uncertainty measures.
5:132:10221:0:21:79:532:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Specifically, we assumeweakcross-country dependence of growth innovations andstrongcross-
5:133:10310:21:20:79:533:688:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:country  dependence  of  volatility  innovations  (in  the  sense  of  Chudik  et  al.,  2011).   This  is
5:134:10416:20:20:79:533:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:equivalent to assuming that volatility innovations share at least one more strong common factor
5:135:10511:20:21:79:533:648:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:than growth innovations.  As the paper shows, under this condition, the real common factor is
5:136:10604:21:20:79:533:627:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:proportional to world GDP growth, measured as the weighted average of country-specific growth
5:137:10697:20:20:79:533:607:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:rates.4Also, if it is further assumed that the volatility series shareonly  oneadditional strong
5:138:10793:20:21:79:533:587:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:factor as compared to the growth innovations, the loading matrix on the global factors becomes
5:139:10887:21:20:79:533:566:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:triangular,  with  country-specific  volatilities  loading  contemporaneously  on  both  the  real  and
5:140:10990:20:20:79:533:546:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:financial factor, and country growth rates loading only on the real factor.  Under this condition,
5:141:11088:20:21:79:533:526:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the  second  factor,  common  only  to  the  volatility  series,  can  then  be  identified  in  our  model
5:142:11195:21:20:79:533:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and measured in the data as the residual of a OLS regression of world volatility on world GDP
5:143:11288:20:23:79:115:485:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:growth.
5:144:11295:23:21:96:533:462:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Our identification assumptions are in accordance with patterns of cross-country correlation
5:145:11386:21:20:79:533:441:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:that  we  document  in  the  data,  as  well  as  statistical  tests  of  the  cross-country  dependence  of
5:146:11494:20:20:79:533:421:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the estimated country-specific volatility and growth innovations.  For instance, for each country
5:147:11591:20:20:79:533:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:in our sample, Figure 2 plots the average pair-wise correlation of volatility and output growth
5:148:11686:20:21:79:533:381:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:series, together with the average across all countries.5It can be seen that the average pair-wise
5:149:11783:21:20:79:533:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:correlation across all countries for the volatility series is more than twice the average for the
5:150:11880:20:20:79:532:340:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:growth series, at 0.58 and 0.27, respectively (the two dotted lines).  This evidence suggests that,
5:151:11979:20:21:79:532:320:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:indeed, the volatility series are much more correlated across countries than the growth series.6
5:152:12075:21:20:79:533:299:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We also find even more striking differences when we consider the cross-country dependence of
5:153:12167:20:23:79:342:279:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the volatility and growth innovations (See Section 7.2).
5:154:12223:23:21:96:533:256:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:To measure economic uncertainty, we build on the contributions of Andersen et al. (2001,
5:155:12311:21:20:79:533:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:2003)  and  Barndorff-Nielsen  and  Shephard  (2002,  2004)  and  compute  realized  equity  price
5:156:12409:20:20:79:533:215:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:volatility for a given quarter by using daily returns for 32 advanced and emerging economies
5:157:12501:20:21:79:533:195:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:representing more than 90 percent of the world economy.  We also consider several other proxies
5:158:12596:21:15:79:533:174:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:for uncertainty and argue that they are either not suitable for the purpose of our analysis, or
5:159:12691:15:15:91:532:159:6:g_d0_f12:9:g_d0_f11:4Our  identification  assumption  is  compatible  with  the  view  that  the  global  financial  cycle  (e.g.  Rey,  2013)
5:160:12813:15:11:79:533:144:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:is stronger than the international business cycle (e.g., Kose et al. (2003)), with realized equity market volatility
5:161:12929:11:7:79:356:133:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:co-moving more closely across countries than real GDP growth does.

5:164:13218:7:15:91:532:104:6:g_d0_f12:9:g_d0_f11:6We  note  here  that  these  patterns  of  cross-country  correlations  are  consistent  with  those  documented  by

6:181:14652:23:21:96:533:381:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The empirical analysis yields a rich set of findings.  Here we highlight three main results.
6:182:14744:21:20:79:533:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:First, and most importantly, we find that the bulk of the negative correlations between volatility
6:183:14842:20:20:79:533:340:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and  output  growth  observed  in  the  data  can  be  accounted  for  by  the  real  common  factor.
6:184:14943:20:21:79:533:320:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:While  unconditionally  volatility  behaves  countercyclically  for  all  but  one  of  the  32  countries
6:185:15049:21:20:79:533:299:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:in  our  sample,  when  we  condition  on  the  real  factor,  the  correlations  between  volatility  and
6:186:15155:20:20:79:533:279:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:growth  innovations  become  statistically  insignificant  in  all  but  two  emerging  economies,  and
6:187:15258:20:21:79:533:259:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:quantitatively much smaller in all countries (changing sign in more than half of the cases).  This
6:188:15356:21:20:79:533:238:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:result does not depend on any auxiliary assumptions made, including that volatility series share
6:189:15452:20:20:79:533:218:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:only one additional strong factor, and suggests that part of the explanatory power attributed
6:190:15545:20:21:79:533:198:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to uncertainty shocks in empirical studies of individual countries, considered in isolation from
6:191:15641:21:20:79:533:177:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the rest of the world economy, might be due to omitting such a real common factor from the
6:192:15731:20:23:79:119:157:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:analysis.
6:193:15740:23:21:96:533:134:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Second,  the  paper  shows  that  the  time-variation  of  country-specific  volatility  is  explained
6:194:15842:21:20:79:533:113:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:largely by shocks to the financial factor (with a share of forecast error variance larger than 60%)
6:195:15941:20:20:79:533:93:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and innovations to country-specific volatility series themselves (with a share of forecast error
6:196:16037:20:0:79:533:73:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:variance of about 35 percent).  Shocks to the real common factor and to country-specific growth
7:197:16133:0:21:79:533:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:innovations explain less than 5 percent of volatility forecast error variance.  We interpret this
7:198:16230:21:20:79:533:688:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:evidence as suggesting that the endogenous component of country-specific volatility is small, or,
7:199:16327:20:23:79:521:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:equivalently, that volatility measured at quarterly frequency is largely an exogenous process.
7:200:16421:23:21:96:533:645:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Third  and  finally,  we  find  that  shocks  to  the  common  financial  factor  explain  about  10%
7:201:16522:21:20:79:533:624:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of the forecast error variance of output growth,  even though they have strong and persistent
7:202:16615:20:20:79:532:604:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:contractionary  effects.   In  contrast,  country-specific  volatility  shocks  explain  only  1−2  per-
7:203:16719:20:21:79:533:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:cent of country-specific forecast error growth variance.  These results illustrate the quantitative
7:204:16818:21:20:79:533:563:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:importance  of  distinguishing  between  common  and  country-specific  volatility  shocks.   In  our
7:205:16919:20:20:79:533:543:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:empirical model, the forecast error variance of output growth is explained mainly by innovations
7:206:17015:20:21:79:533:523:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to country-specific growth rates themselves (with a share of at least 60% percent) and the real
7:207:17110:21:23:79:346:502:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:common factor (with another 25% percent of the total).
7:208:17164:23:20:96:532:479:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:The paper is closely related to three strands of empirical literature on volatility and growth.7
7:209:17260:20:20:79:533:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The first strand acknowledges that uncertainty may be endogenous and could be driven by the
7:210:17351:20:21:79:533:439:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:business cycle (See, for instance, Ludvigson et al. (2015), Clark et al. (2016), and Berger et al.
7:211:17449:21:20:79:532:418:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(2017)).8A key difference relative to these contributions, is that our identification assumptions
7:212:17546:20:20:79:533:398:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:apply to a cross-section of countries, as opposed to a single country considered in isolation from
7:213:17644:20:21:79:533:378:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the rest of the world,  or the global economy analyzed as a single,  closed economy.  Also,  our
7:214:17740:21:20:79:533:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:identification strategy is simpler and consistent with observable cross-country correlation prop-
7:215:17837:20:20:79:533:337:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:erties  of  the  data  and  the  estimated  country-specific  innovations  as  opposed  to  unobservable
7:216:17941:20:21:79:533:317:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:theoretical conditions.  Interestingly, despite the different approaches taken to proxy for uncer-
7:217:18039:21:20:79:533:296:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:tainty and to separate endogenous responses to the business cycle from exogenous changes, we
7:218:18131:20:20:79:533:276:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:reach similar conclusions that the endogenous component of country-specific volatility is small,
7:219:18227:20:21:79:533:256:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and exogenous shifts in uncertainty can be quite harmful for output growth.  According to our
7:220:18320:21:20:79:533:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:analysis, however, the latter applies only to the global component of uncertainty that cannot
7:221:18413:20:20:79:533:215:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:be identified separately in the empirical frameworks that focus on individual countries, taken in
7:222:18510:20:23:79:293:195:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:isolation from the rest of the world economy.
7:223:18555:23:21:96:533:172:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A second strand of the literature has an international focus as in our paper.  For instance,

7:225:18736:20:16:79:533:131:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:advanced and emerging economies in which the US VIX index is assumed to be exogenous and
7:226:18824:16:15:91:532:115:6:g_d0_f12:9:g_d0_f11:7The literature is voluminous.  See Bloom (2014) for a recent survey.  Here we focus only on studies directly
7:227:18933:15:7:79:163:100:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:related to our paper.

8:230:19091:0:21:79:533:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:identification  is  achieved  imposing  country-by-country  restrictions.   Baker  and  Bloom  (2013)

8:234:19490:21:20:79:533:627:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Hirata et al. (2012) estimate a factor-augmented VAR (FAVAR), with factors computed based
8:235:19579:20:20:79:533:607:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:on  data  for  18  advanced  economies,  and  use  a  recursive  identification  scheme  in  which  the
8:236:19682:20:21:79:533:587:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:volatility variable is ordered first in the VAR. Carriero et al. (2017) estimate a large Bayesian

8:240:20071:21:20:79:533:505:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:analysis assuming that the uncertainty proxy used is exogenous.  In addition, in our framework,
8:241:20166:20:20:79:533:485:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:countries interact with each other not only via the common factors, but also via an unrestricted
8:242:20262:20:21:79:533:465:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:variance-covariance matrix of the country-specific volatility and growth innovations.  In contrast,
8:243:20361:21:20:79:533:444:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:in the above studies, economies can interact only via common factors or variables like the VIX
8:244:20455:20:23:79:417:424:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:index, but do not interact with each other via other spillover channels.
8:245:20527:23:20:96:533:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Our  paper  also  relates  to  contributions  in  the  finance  literature.   The  closest  analogous
8:246:20628:20:21:79:533:381:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to  the  framework  we  propose  are  mean-variance  frontier  models—discussed,  for  example,  by
8:247:20727:21:20:79:533:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Black (1976) and French et al. (1987).  In those models, however, the focus is on possible causal
8:248:20824:20:20:79:533:340:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:relations between the stock market return and its volatility, via leverage effect or other channels.
8:249:20924:20:21:79:533:320:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We model the contemporaneous relation between country-specific GDP growth and stock market
8:250:21014:21:20:79:533:299:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:volatility.  We argue that one can think of GDP as the ‘dividend’ or the ‘cash flow’ associated
8:251:21109:20:20:79:533:279:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:with the country stock market index.  In this sense,  the novelty of our modeling approach is
8:252:21202:20:21:79:533:259:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to  work  in  the  dividend-volatility  (or  cash  flow-volatility)  space  rather  than  return-volatility
8:253:21309:21:20:79:533:238:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:space.  Indeed, our identification strategy exploits the fact that country-specific dividend growth
8:254:21408:20:20:79:533:218:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:processes (the country GDP growth rates) are less correlated across countries as compared to
8:255:21500:20:24:79:314:198:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the cross-market correlation of equity volatilities.
8:256:21552:24:20:96:533:174:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The rest of the paper is organized as follows.  Section 2 sets out the theoretical multi-country
8:257:21648:20:20:79:533:154:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:model and derives country-specific equity returns and volatilities and shows how they are re-
8:258:21741:20:21:79:533:134:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:lated to the underlying world technology factor and its higher moments.  Section 3 considers
8:259:21833:21:20:79:533:113:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the econometric issues involved in identification of the real and financial factors using a static
8:260:21931:20:20:79:533:93:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:version of our econometric multi-country model.  Section 4 extends the analysis to a dynamic
8:261:22023:20:0:79:533:73:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:setting.  Section 5 considers the use of realized volatility as a proxy measure for uncertainty in
9:262:22122:0:21:79:533:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:a multi-country setting.  Section 6 reports key stylized facts of the data, including evidence on
9:263:22219:21:20:79:533:688:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the cross-country correlation structure of volatilities and output growth.  Section 7 reports the
9:264:22316:20:20:79:533:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:main empirical results of the paper on the comparison between unconditional and conditional
9:265:22407:20:21:79:533:648:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:correlations between volatility and growth.  Section 8 reports forecast error variance decompo-
9:266:22502:21:20:79:533:627:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:sitions and discusses the corresponding empirical results.  Section 9 presents impulse responses,
9:267:22599:20:20:79:533:607:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and Section 10 concludes.  Some of the technical proofs and details of the data and their sources
9:268:22696:20:21:79:533:587:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:are provided in the Appendix.  Derivation of impulse responses and variance decompositions,

9:286:23801:34:20:79:533:233:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:In  this  section  we  set  up  a  simple  theoretical  model  of  the  business  cycle  with  time-varying
9:287:23908:20:21:79:533:213:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:volatility that will help to guide the empirical analysis.  To this end we consider a multi-country
9:288:24007:21:20:79:533:192:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:version of the Lucas (1978) tree model augmented with time-varying volatility that establishes a
9:289:24103:20:20:79:533:172:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:link between changes in volatility and business cycle fluctuations via a common (global) risk-free
9:290:24201:20:21:79:532:152:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:rate. Specifically, consider a world consisting ofNeconomies (countries) indexed byi= 1,2,...N,
9:291:24296:21:20:79:533:131:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of similar but not necessarily identical relative sizes,wit=O(N−1),  where ΣNi=1wit= 1.  We
9:292:24387:20:20:79:533:111:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:shall also assume that these economies have the same preferences, but are exposed differently
9:293:24480:20:0:79:533:91:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to a world growth factor, assumed to be exogenously given.  The world growth factor is largely,
10:294:24576:0:24:79:324:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:but not exclusively, driven by technological factors.
10:295:24629:24:20:96:532:685:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Each  economyiis  inhabited  by  an  infinitely-lived  representative  agent  endowed  with  a

10:297:24812:20:21:79:532:645:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:measure of real output or GDP. It is assumed that the country’s output growth rate, ∆yit=
10:298:24901:21:20:79:532:624:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:ln (Yit/Yi,t−1) fluctuates around a deterministic steady state,gi, driven by country-specific,εit,

10:301:25048:30:21:79:533:554:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Despite its simplicity, the assumed growth process is consistent with multi-country versions of
10:302:25143:21:20:79:533:533:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the  international  real  business  cycle  models  of  Backus  et  al.  (1992)  and  Baxter  and  Crucini
10:303:25248:20:23:79:430:513:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:(1995), and it is at the core of typical new open-economy DSGE models.9
10:304:25319:23:20:96:532:490:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:To simplify the exposition we assume thatεitfori= 1,2,...,Nare serially uncorrelated and
10:305:25407:20:21:79:532:470:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f19:independently distributed acrossi.  Also, without loss of generality, we assume thatftandεit
10:306:25499:21:20:79:533:449:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:are uncorrelated.  However, richer time series dynamics, as well as weak forms of cross-country
10:307:25594:20:20:79:533:429:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:dependence, could be allowed for. Indeed, empirically, we model the dynamics of country-specific
10:308:25690:20:21:79:533:409:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:equity market volatility and the business cycle jointly as factor augmented vector autoregressive

17:799:38506:20:0:79:533:72:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:begin with a static specification, omitting dynamics and deterministic components to simplify

18:808:39115:21:20:79:533:507:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:duction, realized equity price volatility and output growth share a large and negative contempo-

18:810:39309:20:21:79:533:467:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:robust stylized fact of the data documented also by Baker and Bloom (2013), Carriere-Swallow
18:811:39401:21:20:79:533:446:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and Cespedes (2013), and Nakamura et al. (2017).  From a theoretical perspective, as shown in
18:812:39494:20:20:79:533:426:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the previous section, one can think offtas a common world growth factor (e.g., technology),
18:813:39585:20:21:79:533:406:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:which affects all countries GDP growth rates and equity price volatilities contemporaneously,
18:814:39678:21:20:79:533:385:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:which we will call ‘real’ factor in the rest of the paper.  In view of our theoretical derivations in
18:815:39779:20:20:79:532:365:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the previous section,ftcould be viewed as a pure ‘level’ or ‘first moment’ factor in the sense of

18:817:39904:23:21:96:533:322:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:It is worth noting that without further restrictions on the cross section correlations ofuitand
18:818:39999:21:20:79:532:301:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f4:εit, it is not possible to be sure about the number of common factors affecting output growth and
18:819:40096:20:20:79:532:281:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:volatility.  In our theoretical derivations, we assumeεitto be cross sectionally weakly dependent
18:820:40193:20:21:79:533:261:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and deriveuitin terms of level and higher-order moments offt.  It follows that most likelyεitand
18:821:40289:21:20:79:532:240:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f4:uitwill be correlated, and due to the remaining common component affectinguit, it is also likely
18:822:40385:20:20:79:532:220:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:thatuitwill be cross sectionally strongly correlated.  This interpretation is also in the spirit of

18:824:40576:21:20:79:532:179:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:second moments.19In our empirical application we will find that whileftis sufficient to render

18:826:40767:20:21:79:532:139:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:at least one more common factor to span the cross-country correlations of theuit, which we saw
18:827:40861:21:16:79:532:118:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:in the previous section can be affected by higher order moments of ∆yit.  In the paper, we will

19:833:41379:20:21:79:533:645:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:country-specific loadings on the common factors.  There are also dynamic features that need to
19:834:41473:21:20:79:533:624:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:be taken into account that vary across countries due to geographical location, institutions, and
19:835:41569:20:39:79:458:604:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:history.  We will consider heterogeneous dynamics across countries in Section 4.

19:837:41683:30:20:79:533:535:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The main idea is to achieve identification offtand its loadings,λiandγi, by placing restrictions

20:893:43824:39:21:96:533:365:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Assumption 1 is standard in the factor literature (see, for instance, Assumption B in Bai and
20:894:43917:21:20:79:533:344:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Ng (2002)).  It ensures thatftis a strong (or pervasive) factor for both volatility and growth
20:895:44011:20:20:79:533:324:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:so that it can be estimated consistently either using principal components or by cross-section
20:896:44105:20:24:79:395:304:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:averages of country-specific observations (see Chudik et al., 2011).
20:897:44173:24:20:96:533:280:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Assumption  2  requires  that  individual  countries’  contribution  to  world  growth  or  world
20:898:44270:20:20:79:532:260:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:volatility is of order 1/N.  This is consistent with the notion that,  since the 1990s,  when our
20:899:44367:20:21:79:533:240:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:sample period starts, world growth and world capital markets have become progressively more
20:900:44458:21:23:79:389:219:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:diversified and integrated as a result of the globalization process.
20:901:44526:23:20:96:533:196:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The first part of Assumption 3 is also standard and leaves the causal relation between the

20:903:44709:20:21:79:532:156:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f4:εitcaptures any contemporaneous causal relation between country-specific volatility and growth,

20:905:44898:23:20:96:532:112:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The second part of Assumption 3 is crucial to identifyftas the following proposition demon-
20:906:44989:20:20:79:533:92:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:strates.   The  assumption  states  that  the  volatility  innovations  are  strongly  correlated  across
20:907:45094:20:0:79:533:72:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:countries, while growth innovations are weakly correlated across countries.  Weak cross-country
21:908:45191:0:21:79:532:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:correlation in turn means that, asymptotically, asNbecomes large, the average pair-wise cor-
21:909:45283:21:20:79:533:688:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:relations  across  countries  of  growth  innovations  tends  to  zero,  since  the  largest  eigenvalue  of
21:910:45391:20:20:79:533:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:their variance-covariance matrix is bounded inN.20On the other hand, strong cross-country
21:911:45480:20:21:79:533:648:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:correlation means that the average pair-wise correlation of volatility innovations does not tend
21:912:45576:21:20:79:533:627:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to zero because the largest eigenvalue ofΣugrows with the size of the cross-section,N.  As we
21:913:45669:20:20:79:533:607:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:shall see, this key assumption is in accordance not only with the empirical properties of the data

22:958:47039:36:35:79:394:673:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:This is a key result in our paper and several remarks are in order:
22:959:47106:35:20:79:532:638:11:g_d0_f18:11:g_d0_f13:Remark 1(Estimation  offt)  Asftis  pervasive  or  strong,  we  can  estimate  it  with  either  as

22:961:47296:20:35:79:431:598:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f13:cross-section averages of∆yit, obtaining asymptotically equivalent results.
22:962:47371:35:21:96:533:563:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Indeed, Figure S.2 in the online supplement shows that the first (static) principal component
22:963:47464:21:20:79:532:542:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and the cross section average of ∆yitprovide estimates offtthat are very close, with a correlation
22:964:47562:20:20:79:532:522:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of 0.9.  In the present context the use  of the cross-section-average (CSA) estimator offthas
22:965:47655:20:21:79:533:502:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:two  advantages.   First,  it  can  be  directly  interpreted  as  global  GDP  growth.   Second,  under

22:971:48132:35:20:96:533:350:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:This is because the volatility innovations,uit, are assumed to be strongly correlated across
22:972:48224:20:21:79:532:330:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:countries, which in turn means that the largest eigenvalue ofΣuwill grow with the size of the

22:975:48503:20:35:79:240:269:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:growth can be used to identifyft.

22:977:48627:21:20:79:533:213:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f13:same reason,  applying principal component analysis to the panel of volatility and growth series
22:978:48723:20:35:79:208:193:11:g_d0_f13:11:g_d0_f13:does not identifyft, either.
22:979:48751:35:20:96:533:158:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Indeed,  Figure  S.3  in  the  online  supplement  shows  that  the  first  principal  component  of

22:983:49139:20:0:79:411:77:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:additional common factors that exclusively affect the volatility series.
23:984:49213:0:21:96:532:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f6:Before concluding this discussion, it is worth noting that, whilst theoretically we needN→
23:985:49303:21:20:79:532:688:11:g_d0_f6:11:g_d0_f4:∞, in practiceNneed not be too large for the theory to work reasonably well.  The notion of
23:986:49394:20:20:79:533:668:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f4:N→∞, is best viewed as a counterfactual that considers the extent to which the strength of the
23:987:49488:20:21:79:533:648:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:connections among units declines withN.  In our experience, working with many cross-country
23:988:49579:21:39:79:300:627:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:panels,Naround 30 is often sufficiently large.

23:990:49664:30:20:79:533:558:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The main empirical result of the paper does not require explicit identification of the additional
23:991:49761:20:21:79:532:538:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:strong factors assumed to be exclusive to the volatilities,vit.  But doing so permits exploring
23:992:49856:21:20:79:533:517:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:other  properties  of  the  data  that  underpin  the  second  and  the  third  main  empirical  results
23:993:49960:20:20:79:533:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:summarized above.  With this in mind, recall that, under condition (35) of Assumption 3, the
23:994:50052:20:21:79:532:477:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:cross-section  of  volatility  innovations,uit,  must  at  least  share  one  additional  strong  common
23:995:50156:21:20:79:533:456:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:factor that is not shared by the growth innovations.  By assuming, without loss of generality,
23:996:50250:20:20:79:532:436:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:that theuitshareonlyone additional strong factor, we can identify it from the data, up to an

23:998:50437:21:20:79:533:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A formal statement of this result is provided in Proposition 2 below and established under the

27:1170:57429:0:21:96:533:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:To summarize, the key feature of our identification strategy lies in the fact that no restric-
27:1171:57523:21:20:79:533:688:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:tion  is  imposed  at  the  individual  country  level.   Restrictions  apply  only  to  the  cross-section

27:1174:57835:21:20:79:533:627:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:series of innovations.  The growth innovations are assumed to be cross-sectionally weakly cor-
27:1175:57929:20:20:79:533:607:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:related, while the volatility innovations are assumed cross-sectionally strongly correlated.  As a
27:1176:58027:20:21:79:532:587:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:result,  the effect of country-specific growth innovations on the global variable ∆ ̄yω,tvanish if

31:1370:66479:46:34:79:269:423:14:g_d0_f3:14:g_d0_f3:5    Volatility Measurement
31:1371:66506:34:21:79:533:389:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:As a proxy for uncertainty we use realized equity price volatility.  Realized volatility has been
31:1372:66603:21:20:79:533:368:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:used extensively in the theoretical and empirical finance literature and implicitly assumes that
31:1373:66699:20:20:79:532:348:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:uncertainty and risk can be characterized in terms of probability distributions.26Specifically,
31:1374:66794:20:21:79:533:328:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:we use a measure of quarterly realized volatility based on the summation of daily squared stock
31:1375:66889:21:20:79:533:307:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:price returns.  This is a natural application of within-day measures of volatility based on high

32:1396:68251:21:20:79:533:627:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:skewed distributions, but logarithmic variances tend to have near Gaussian distributions, in our

32:1398:68444:20:24:79:144:587:11:g_d0_f7:11:g_d0_f7:vit= log(σit).
32:1399:68458:24:20:96:533:563:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The realized volatility of asset prices is not the only way of measuring ‘risk’ or ‘uncertainty’.

32:1401:68653:20:21:79:533:523:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:measure of uncertainty can be computed as the cross-sectional dispersion of equity prices within
32:1402:68749:21:20:79:533:502:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:each  country.   In  Section  S1  of  the  online  supplement  we  show  that,  under  fairly  general  as-

32:1405:69052:21:23:79:504:441:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:So, in our application, we will focus on the realized volatility of country equity indexes.29

32:1414:69886:23:20:96:533:253:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:In the finance literature, the focus of the volatility measurement has now shifted to implied
32:1415:69979:20:21:79:533:233:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:volatility measures obtained from option prices, like the US VIX Index (see for example Berger
32:1416:70073:21:20:79:533:212:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:et  al.,  2017).   However,  a  key  input  for  the  implementation  of  our  identification  strategy  is
32:1417:70180:20:20:79:533:192:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the availability of country-specific measures of uncertainty for a large number of countries over
32:1418:70277:20:21:79:533:172:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:a  long  period  of  time,  and  implied  volatility  measures  are  not  yet  available  for  a  meaningful
32:1419:70385:21:16:79:533:151:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:number of countries.30The literature has also used uncertainty measures based on expectations
32:1420:70478:16:14:87:532:135:6:g_d0_f12:9:g_d0_f11:28In the case of intra-day observations, for example, prices are usually sampled at 10-minutes intervals which
32:1421:70588:14:8:79:323:121:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:yield around 48 intra-daily returns in an 8-hour trading day.
32:1422:70649:8:11:87:532:113:6:g_d0_f12:9:g_d0_f11:29Daily returns are computed abstracting from dividends, which are negligible by comparison to price changes.

32:1424:70870:14:11:79:533:88:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:the period over which they overlap and shows that the two measures co-move very closely with a correlation of
32:1425:70979:11:0:79:119:77:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:about 0.9.
33:1426:70991:0:21:79:532:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:dispersion.31While the measure proposed by Rossi and Sekhposyan (2015) is available for a
33:1427:71080:21:20:79:533:688:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:large number of countries, the time series dimension is unbalanced and often not long enough
33:1428:71172:20:20:79:533:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:for  our  purposes.   Finally,  model  based  measures,  such  as  those  in  Jurado  et  al.  (2015)  and
33:1429:71278:20:21:79:533:648:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Ludvigson et al. (2015) could in principle be computed for all countries in our sample, but the
33:1430:71373:21:20:79:533:627:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:data requirements to construct such measures for many countries over a sufficiently long time

33:1433:71552:34:20:79:533:527:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:This  section  briefly  describes  the  data  set  we  use  in  the  empirical  analysis  and  reports  some
33:1434:71660:20:20:79:533:507:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:stylized  facts  based  on  the  unconditional  moments  of  the  data.   Specifically,  we  consider  the
33:1435:71766:20:21:79:533:487:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:degree of persistence in the growth and volatility series, that is relevant for our model specifi-
33:1436:71864:21:20:79:533:466:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:cation; and examine the patterns of cross-country correlations, which play an important role in
33:1437:71959:20:23:79:205:446:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:our identification strategy.
33:1438:71987:23:20:96:533:423:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The  sources  of  the  data  and  their  sampling  information  are  reported  in  Appendix  B.  To
33:1439:72086:20:21:79:533:403:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:construct a balanced panel for the largest number of countries for which we have sufficiently
33:1440:72179:21:20:79:533:382:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:long time series, we first collect daily stock prices for 32 advanced and emerging economies from
33:1441:72276:20:20:79:533:362:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:1979 to 2011.  We then cut the beginning of the sample in 1993, as daily equity price data are
33:1442:72370:20:21:79:533:342:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:not available earlier for two large emerging economies (Brazil and China) and for Peru.  Better
33:1443:72465:21:20:79:533:321:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:quality quarterly GDP data for China also became available from 1993.  Our results seem to be
33:1444:72558:20:20:79:533:301:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:robust to excluding these three countries and starting the sample in 1988.  Moreover, some steps
33:1445:72654:20:21:79:532:281:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of the empirical analysis, like the estimator of factor innovations (ˆζtandˆξt), can be implemented
33:1446:72753:21:38:79:533:260:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:with the unbalanced panel from 1979 without any significant consequence for our main findings.

33:1448:72865:30:21:79:533:192:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:A  battery  of  summary  statistics  on  the  realized  volatility  series  and  the  real  GDP  series  (in
33:1449:72973:21:20:79:533:171:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:levels) supports our model specification in terms of the log-level of realized volatility and the
33:1450:73070:20:20:79:533:151:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:log-differences of real GDP. As Table S.1 in the online supplement shows, the levels of realized
33:1451:73166:20:21:79:533:131:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:volatility, even though persistent, tend to be mean-reverting.  Table S.2 in the supplement shows
33:1452:73263:21:20:79:532:110:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:that the first order auto-correlation coefficient for realized volatility is on average about 0.6. Also
33:1453:73366:20:15:79:533:90:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:standard ADF tests reject the null hypothesis of unit roots in the volatility series.  In contrast,
33:1454:73465:15:0:87:507:75:6:g_d0_f12:9:g_d0_f11:31See, for instance, Zarnowitz and Lambros (1987), Popescu and Smets (2010), Bachmann et al. (2013).
34:1455:73567:0:21:79:532:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the persistence of real GDP levels is very high (on average around 0.99).  Moreover, the null of
34:1456:73663:21:20:79:533:688:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:a unit root for the level of log-GDP cannot be rejected by standard ADF tests for any of the 32
34:1457:73758:20:39:79:193:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:countries in our sample.

34:1460:73909:21:20:79:532:578:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f13:is crucial for our identification strategy.  Here we consider the properties of the observedtime

34:1462:74112:20:21:79:533:538:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:series co-move across countries, we use two techniques:  standard principal component analysis
34:1463:74206:21:23:79:320:517:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and pair-wise correlation analysis across countries.

34:1467:74545:21:20:79:532:433:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:by  ̄ρN, is defined as the cross-country average of  ̄ρioveri= 1,2,...,N.  This statistics relates
34:1468:74643:20:20:79:533:413:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to the degree of pervasiveness of the factors, as measured by the factor loadings.  To see this,
34:1469:74739:20:21:79:532:393:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:consider equation (29) of our model, ∆yit=γift+εit,whereV ar(ft) = 1, andV ar(εit) =σ2εi.

35:1529:75220:0:21:96:532:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The  attraction  of  the  average  pair-wise  correlation,   ̄ρN,  lies  in  the  fact  that  it  applies  to
35:1530:75329:21:20:79:533:688:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:multi-factor processes, and unlike factor analysis does not require the factors to be strong.  In
35:1531:75426:20:20:79:532:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:fact, the average pair-wise correlation,  ̄ρN, tends to be a strictly positive number if ∆yitcontains

35:1533:75619:21:20:79:533:627:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of  ̄ρNare suggestive of strong cross-sectional dependence.32For completeness, and to show that
35:1534:75714:20:20:79:533:607:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:our analysis is robust to using an alternative methodology, in what follows, we also use standard

35:1536:75842:24:20:96:533:563:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Country-specific average pair-wise correlations of volatility and GDP growth are reported
35:1537:75931:20:20:79:533:543:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:in Figure 2.  Recall that the average pair-wise correlation across all countries for the realized
35:1538:76028:20:21:79:533:523:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:volatility series is 0.56.  In contrast, the average pair-wise correlation across all countries for the
35:1539:76131:21:20:79:533:502:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:growth series at 0.27 is much smaller.  As we can see, the pair-wise correlations of volatility and
35:1540:76230:20:20:79:533:482:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:growth have a similar values for different countries, but there is a clear difference between the
35:1541:76327:20:21:79:533:462:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:two variables.  This suggests that both variables may share at least one strong common factor,
35:1542:76421:21:23:79:517:441:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:even though volatilities seem to co-move more across countries than the GDP growth rates.
35:1543:76510:23:20:96:533:418:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Principal  component  analysis  yields  similar  results.   The  first  principal  component  in  our

35:1545:76724:20:21:79:533:378:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:volatility, whilst the first principal component of the growth series accounts for only around 30
35:1546:76821:21:20:79:533:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:percent  of  total  cross-country  variations.   Thus,  both  in  the  case  of  the  pair-wise  correlation
35:1547:76929:20:20:79:533:337:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and principal component analysis, the results point to a much higher degree of cross-country co-
35:1548:77025:20:21:79:533:317:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:movements for the volatility series than for the growth series. As we will see, these differences are
35:1549:77126:21:20:79:533:296:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:even more pronounced in the case of the estimated innovations series obtained using equations

35:1552:77286:34:20:79:533:196:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The preliminary analysis above is compatible with the common factor model proposed in the pa-

35:1554:77476:21:20:79:533:155:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to the growth series.  The summary statistics reported also support the model specification in

36:1577:79426:20:21:79:533:332:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the shocks are standardized and have zero means and unit in-sample variances.  They are also
36:1578:79518:21:23:79:321:311:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:serially uncorrelated and orthogonal to each other.
36:1579:79569:23:20:96:533:288:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The figure shows that the largest common real shock was after the second oil shock in 1979,
36:1580:79660:20:21:79:533:268:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and during the fourth quarter of 2008 after the Lehman’s collapse.  Also note that, after a very
36:1581:79756:21:20:79:533:247:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:large positive shock in the second quarter of 2009, the size of the subsequent impulses declines
36:1582:79852:20:20:79:533:227:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:persistently, which is consistent with the anemic global recovery experienced in the aftermath
36:1583:79946:20:18:79:533:207:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of the global financial crisis.  The sizes of largest absolute values of common financial shocks,

38:1628:82595:20:21:79:533:538:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:multi-country  approach  permits  us  to  investigate  the  extent  to  which  the  implications  of  the
38:1629:82700:21:20:79:532:517:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:identified model are in line with the identification restrictions made.35To this end, we explore
38:1630:82796:20:20:79:533:497:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the cross-country correlations of the estimated residuals from the dynamic regressions (62) and

38:1632:82964:23:21:96:533:454:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Panel A of Figure 4 plots, for each country in our sample, the average pair-wise correlation
38:1633:83056:21:17:79:533:433:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of the volatility innovations (ˆuit) and the growth innovations (ˆεit), when we condition only on
38:1634:83153:17:21:79:533:416:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:ˆζtin model (62)-(63).  Panel B reports the same statistics when we condition on bothˆζtand
38:1635:83244:21:23:79:532:395:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:ˆξtin model (62)-(63).37The statistics reported are the same as in Figure 2.  The blue (darker)
38:1636:83339:23:20:79:532:372:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:bars are the average pair-wise correlations of the country-specific growth innovations (ˆεit).  The
38:1637:83438:20:23:79:532:352:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:yellow (lighter) bars are for the country-specific volatility innovations (ˆuitand ˆηit, respectively).
38:1638:83541:23:21:96:532:329:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Panel A of Figure 4 shows that, if we condition only onˆζtin (62)-(63), the volatility inno-
38:1639:83633:21:20:79:533:308:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:vations display average pair-wise correlations comparable to those of the data reported for all
38:1640:83728:20:20:79:533:288:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:countries in Figure 2.  In contrast, the pair-wise correlations of the growth innovations are neg-
38:1641:83826:20:21:79:532:268:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:ligible, with an average across all countries of 0.03.38Panel B of Figure 4 also shows that, if we
38:1642:83924:21:20:79:533:247:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:condition on bothˆζtandˆξt, the cross-country correlations of the volatility innovations are now
38:1643:84020:20:20:79:533:227:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:negligible, as in the case of the growth innovations, with an average pair-wise correlation across
38:1644:84118:20:20:79:533:207:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:all countries equal to 0.02.  For instance, in the specific case of the US, the average pair-wise
38:1645:84215:20:21:79:532:187:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:correlation of the volatility innovations is equal to 0.6 conditioning onˆζtalone.  But it drops
38:1646:84311:21:16:79:532:166:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to−0.05 if we condition on both factor innovations.  By comparison, the US average pair-wise
38:1647:84403:16:15:87:532:150:6:g_d0_f12:9:g_d0_f11:35Note that we can estimateζtandξtconsistently by means of the OLS regressions (60) and (61) only under the
38:1648:84510:15:10:79:533:135:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:identification assumptions made.  As a result, whilst we can directly estimate pair-wise correlations of volatility
38:1649:84625:10:11:79:533:125:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:and growth series, we can not examine cross-country pair-wise correlations of their innovations without imposing
38:1650:84737:11:9:79:202:114:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:these identification conditions.
38:1651:84769:9:10:87:460:105:6:g_d0_f12:9:g_d0_f11:36Recall that, in this case, we run OLS on (62) without conditioning onˆξtin the regression.
38:1652:84861:10:11:87:351:95:6:g_d0_f12:9:g_d0_f11:37The same growth innovations are obtained in the two exercises.
38:1653:84925:11:0:87:258:84:6:g_d0_f12:9:g_d0_f11:38Notable exceptions are China and India.

39:1670:85873:11:11:84:527:301:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:are based on (64).  The dotted lines are the averages across all countries, equal to 0.52 and 0.03 for volatility
39:1671:85986:11:11:84:527:290:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:and growth in Panel A; and equal to 0.02 and 0.03 for volatility and GDP growth in Panel B, respectively.
39:1672:86091:11:33:84:220:279:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:Sample period:  1993:Q1-2011:Q2.
39:1673:86123:33:23:79:301:246:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:correlation of the growth innovations is−0.02.
39:1674:86169:23:20:96:532:223:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Figure 4, therefore, illustrates that after conditioning onˆζt—which is common to both growth
39:1675:86262:20:21:79:533:203:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and volatility series—not much commonality is left in the case of growth innovations, but the
39:1676:86355:21:20:79:532:182:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f19:volatility innovations share additional strong factors.  Moreover, after conditioning on bothˆζt
39:1677:86451:20:20:79:532:162:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:andˆξt, the volatility innovations also appear weakly correlated because of the near-zero average
39:1678:86548:20:20:79:533:142:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:pair-wise  correlation  across  all  countries,  thus  suggesting  thatonlytwo  common  shocks  are
39:1679:86647:20:21:79:533:122:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:necessary to span their correlations across-countries as we assume.  It is, therefore, interesting
39:1680:86745:21:20:79:532:101:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f13:to test whether the two sets of innovations also satisfy a formal definition ofweakandstrong
39:1681:86837:20:0:79:283:81:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:dependence, as we assumed deriving them.
40:1682:86879:0:21:96:533:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:To test for  weak  and  strong cross-section dependence,  we  estimate  the  cross-sectional  de-
40:1683:86976:21:20:79:533:688:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:pendence (CD) test statistic of Pesaran (2015) and the exponent of cross sectional dependence
40:1684:87069:20:20:79:532:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:(α) proposed in Bailey et al. (2016).  The CD statistic is normally distributed with zero-mean
40:1685:87163:20:21:79:533:648:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and unit-variance under the null of zero average pair-wise correlations.  So,  the critical value
40:1686:87260:21:20:79:533:627:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:is  around  2.   When  the  null  is  rejected,  Bailey  et  al.  (2016)  suggest  estimating  the  strength
40:1687:87368:20:20:79:532:607:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of the cross-section dependence with an exponent, denotedαin the range (1/2,1], with unity
40:1688:87458:20:21:79:532:587:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:giving the maximum degree of cross dependence. Any value above 1/2 and below 1, but signifi-
40:1689:87550:21:20:79:533:566:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:cantly different from 1, suggests weak dependence.39So, in what follows, we present estimates
40:1690:87643:20:20:79:532:546:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:ofαfor the volatility and the growth innovations, together with their confidence intervals.  For

40:1706:88339:34:20:96:533:235:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The results are summarized in Table 1 and are in accordance with the identification assump-

41:1723:89924:21:20:79:533:566:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the assumptions made that the volatility innovation share at least one more (Assumption 3),

41:1734:90837:23:21:96:533:311:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Figure 5 shows thatˆζtcan account for most of the unconditional association between volatil-
41:1735:90929:21:20:79:532:290:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:ity and growth at quarterly frequency reported in Panel A.40Conditioning onˆζt, the correlation
41:1736:91024:20:20:79:533:270:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:between volatility and growth innovations weakens substantially for all countries and it is no
41:1737:91118:20:21:79:533:250:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:longer statistically significant in all but two cases, which happen to be very volatile emerging
41:1738:91214:21:20:79:533:229:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:economies.  In the case of the US, for instance, the conditional correlation does not vanish, but
41:1739:91311:20:20:79:533:209:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:drops to less than half its unconditional value and is not statistically significant.  Panel C of
41:1740:91408:20:21:79:532:189:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Figure 5 shows that conditioning explicitly onˆξtdoes not alter these results.  This is intuitive,
41:1741:91506:21:23:79:290:168:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:asˆξtis common only to the volatility series.
41:1742:91551:23:20:96:533:145:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:These results suggest that volatility and growth share an important common component at
41:1743:91638:20:20:79:533:125:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:quarterly frequency, and that conditioning onˆζtcaptures most of this dependence.  This implies
41:1744:91733:20:16:79:533:105:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:that  some  of  the  explanatory  power  attributed  to  uncertainty  shocks  in  empirical  studies  of

43:1766:93435:0:21:79:533:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:individual countries, considered in isolation from the rest of the world, might be due to omitting
43:1767:93533:21:23:79:273:688:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:such a common factor from the analysis.
43:1768:93572:23:20:96:533:665:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:How  can  we  interpret  this  evidence?   While  we  are  agnostic  on  which  specific  structural
43:1769:93672:20:21:79:533:645:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:model may or may not generate the pattern of cross-country correlations that we have assumed
43:1770:93764:21:20:79:533:624:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:in our identification strategy and documented above, given our theoretical model, it is reasonable
43:1771:93862:20:20:79:532:604:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to interpret the common growth innovations,ˆζt, as reflecting variations in the global risk free
43:1772:93958:20:21:79:533:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:rate.  Specifically, in Section 2.1 and 2.2, using a simple multi-country model, we showed that
43:1773:94053:21:20:79:533:563:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:expected world growth is tied to the world risk-free rate, and changes in expected world growth
43:1774:94148:20:20:79:533:543:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:can affect both country volatilities and country growth rates at the same time.  Lower expected
43:1775:94243:20:21:79:533:523:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:world growth means a lower world risk-free rate, and hence higher country risk premium and
43:1776:94333:21:20:79:533:502:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:country  volatility,  but  also  lower  country  growth.   Our  real  common  factor,  therefore,  drives
43:1777:94438:20:23:79:149:482:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:both variables.
43:1778:94453:23:20:96:533:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Note, however, that the evidence reported above does not imply that changes in volatility
43:1779:94542:20:21:79:532:439:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:over  time  are  mostly  driven  byˆζt.   That  is,  while  these  shocks  can  account  for  most  of  the
43:1780:94649:21:20:79:533:418:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:contemporaneous co-movement between volatility and growth, they do not necessarily explain
43:1781:94739:20:20:79:533:398:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:a significant share of the observed time variations in global innovations to volatility.  Indeed, as
43:1782:94839:20:21:79:533:378:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:we will see in the next section,ˆζtexplains a relatively small share of the variation of volatility
43:1783:94938:21:46:79:328:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:over time, with a much larger share explained byˆξt.

43:1786:95062:34:20:79:533:250:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Forecast error variance decompositions are routinely used to quantify the importance of a given
43:1787:95157:20:20:79:533:230:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:shock for the time-variation of the endogenous variables at different time horizons, relative to
43:1788:95253:20:21:79:533:210:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:other shocks in the model.  Our factor augmented multi-country VAR model can be readily used
43:1789:95345:21:20:79:533:189:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to decompose the forecast error variance of country volatility and growth in terms of the common
43:1790:95441:20:20:79:532:169:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:shocks,ˆζtandˆξt, as well as the 64 vector of country-specific shocks, ˆηitand ˆεitfori= 1,2,....,32.
43:1791:95542:20:21:79:532:149:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:While the global real and financial shocks,ˆζtandˆξt, are orthogonal to the country-specific shocks
43:1792:95641:21:20:79:532:128:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and to each other by construction, the country-specific shocks ˆηitand ˆεitare left unrestricted,
43:1793:95738:20:20:79:532:108:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and can be correlated,  both within and between countries,  even conditional onˆζtandˆξt.  In
43:1794:95831:20:0:79:533:88:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:order to compute and interpret forecast error variance decompositions, we therefore have to deal
44:1795:95929:0:24:79:325:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:with this source of within country interdependence.
44:1796:95980:24:20:96:533:685:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Consider first the correlation between volatility and growth innovations within each country.
44:1797:96073:20:20:79:532:665:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f19:We saw in Figure 5 that the contemporaneous within-country correlation between  ˆηitand ˆεit
44:1798:96165:20:21:79:533:645:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:is very small and not statistically significant for all but two emerging market economies, once
44:1799:96260:21:20:79:533:624:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:we condition on the global shocksˆζtandˆξt.  Nonetheless, even assuming the estimated reduced
44:1800:96353:20:20:79:532:604:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f19:form covariance matrix were truly diagonal, this would not imply that innovations ˆηitand ˆεit
44:1801:96447:20:21:79:533:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:can  be  interpreted  as  ‘structural’  country-specific  volatility  and  growth  shocks.   As  it  is  well
44:1802:96556:21:20:79:532:563:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:known there always exists an orthonormal transformation of ˆηitand ˆεitthat lead to the same
44:1803:96648:20:23:79:260:543:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:forecast error variance decomposition.
44:1804:96686:23:20:96:532:520:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:It is, therefore, important that the 64×64 matrix of correlations among all 32 countries and
44:1805:96778:20:21:79:533:500:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:both variables is considered in a full multi-country set up.  Our results show that, conditional
44:1806:96874:21:20:79:532:479:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f19:on both real and financial common shocks,ˆζtandˆξt, the country-specific innovations ˆεitand ˆηit
44:1807:96971:20:20:79:533:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:are weakly correlated across countries (Figure 4).  The average pair-wise correlations of volatility
44:1808:97071:20:21:79:532:439:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and growth is negligible, and even in the case of China and India they were well below 0.2.  As we
44:1809:97169:21:20:79:532:418:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:discussed above, weak cross-sectional dependence means that, asNgrows, the overall average
44:1810:97259:20:20:79:533:398:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:pair-wise  correlation  tends  to  zero.  This  further  means  that,  while  some  pairs  of  correlations
44:1811:97366:20:21:79:533:378:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:can be different from zero, not all pairs can be so.  In practice, this means that most correlation
44:1812:97465:21:23:79:431:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:pairs will be very small and the overall covariance matrix must be sparse.
44:1813:97539:23:20:96:533:334:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We exploit the sparsity of the correlation matrix of country-specific shocks by making al-
44:1814:97629:20:20:79:533:314:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:ternative  assumptions regarding  the causal  relations  between the  country-specific  innovations
44:1815:97728:20:21:79:532:294:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:ˆηitand ˆεit, and show that the inference we draw is reasonably robust to different estimates of
44:1816:97824:21:20:79:533:273:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the country-specific error correlation matrix.  As a first approximation, we assume that the only
44:1817:97921:20:20:79:533:253:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:source of interdependence among all growth and volatility series are the global real and financial
44:1818:98019:20:21:79:532:233:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:shocksˆζtandˆξt.  This implies assuming that country-specific volatility and growth shocks have
44:1819:98114:21:20:79:533:212:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:no contemporaneous impact on growth or volatility series within and across countries.  Despite
44:1820:98208:20:20:79:533:192:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:its  apparent  severity,  this  assumption  seems  justified  by  our  empirical  finding  that  there  ex-
44:1821:98315:20:21:79:533:172:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:ist very limited conditional within-country correlations and weak cross-country correlations as
44:1822:98410:21:23:79:170:151:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:summarized above.
44:1823:98427:23:20:96:533:128:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We then check the robustness of the results from this ‘benchmark’ scenario, by comparing
44:1824:98515:20:21:79:533:108:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:them with those obtained under weaker assumptions.  While maintaining the assumption of zero
44:1825:98607:21:0:79:533:87:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:conditional correlations between countries, we assume that country-specific volatility shocks can
45:1826:98706:0:21:79:533:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:have a contemporaneous causal impact on growth variables but notvice-versa, in line with much
45:1827:98799:21:20:79:533:688:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of the existing empirical literature as reviewed in the Introduction.  This is done by allowing for
45:1828:98898:20:20:79:533:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:a block-diagonal error covariance matrix in the full multi-country model, in which the only non-
45:1829:98994:20:21:79:533:648:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:zero off-diagonal elements are the estimated covariances between volatility and growth errors of
45:1830:99090:21:20:79:533:627:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:each country block.  These within-country blocks are factorized with a Cholesky decomposition,
45:1831:99184:20:23:79:237:607:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:ordering volatility before growth.
45:1832:99218:23:21:96:533:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Finally, as a third possibility we refrain altogether from interpreting country-specific volatil-
45:1833:99315:21:20:79:533:563:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:ity  and  growth  shocks  as  structural,  and  make  use  of  a  general  unrestricted  error  covariance
45:1834:99421:20:20:79:533:543:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:matrix  subject  to  the  sparsity  condition,  both  within  and  across  countries  and  compute  the
45:1835:99524:20:21:79:533:523:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:generalized forecast error variance decompositions (GFEVD) of Pesaran and Shin (1998), rather
45:1836:99617:21:20:79:533:502:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:than orthogonal forecast error variance decompositions that require Cholesky ordering of the
45:1837:99709:20:20:79:533:482:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:shocks.  However, before computing GFEVDs, we use the regularized multiple testing threshold
45:1838:99801:20:21:79:533:462:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:estimator of the error covariance matrix proposed by Bailey et al. (2017) and described in more
45:1839:99896:21:20:79:533:441:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:detail below, to obtain a consistent estimator of the 64×64 error covariance matrix for the full
45:1840:99992:20:20:79:533:421:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:multi-country model.  This regularized estimator exploits the sparsity of the underlying error

45:1846:100489:24:20:79:533:296:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:assuming the 64×64 error covariance matrix is diagonal; Figure 7 reports the results obtained for

45:1851:100962:20:39:79:500:195:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the error variance decompositions that result from these three alternative specifications.

46:1856:101430:0:21:79:533:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:figure shows that country volatility is driven largely by common financial shocks (blue area with
46:1857:101527:21:20:79:533:688:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:vertical lines) and country-specific volatility shocks (red area with crosses).  Combined together,
46:1858:101626:20:20:79:533:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:these two shocks explain about 95 percent of the total variance of realized volatility over time.
46:1859:101723:20:21:79:533:648:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Real common shocks (purple area with diagonal lines) explain less than 5 percent of the total
46:1860:101816:21:20:79:533:627:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:volatility forecast error variance.  Country growth shocks, as well as all other 31 country-specific
46:1861:101916:20:20:79:533:607:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:foreign growth shocks in the full model, play essentially no role.  These results, therefore, suggest
46:1862:102017:20:21:79:533:587:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:that country volatility is largely driven by global financial shocks and its own country-specific
46:1863:102114:21:20:79:533:566:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:innovations.  In other words, according to these results, the component of volatility driven by
46:1864:102209:20:20:79:533:546:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:common or country-specific output shocks, and hence the ‘endogenous’ component of country-
46:1865:102299:20:36:79:412:526:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:specific volatility in the sense of Ludvigson et al. (2015) is very small.

46:1894:103109:31:20:96:533:173:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:It  is  worth  noting  that  these  estimated  shares  of  the  forecast  error  variance  of  volatility
46:1895:103214:20:21:79:533:153:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:are similar to the central estimates of Ludvigson et al. (2015) for the US. In that study,  the
46:1896:103309:21:20:79:533:132:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:share of macroeconomic shocks in the forecast error variance of financial volatility is estimated
46:1897:103406:20:20:79:533:112:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:at just above 5 percent in the long run.  However, while Ludvigson et al. (2015) attribute this
46:1898:103501:20:20:79:533:92:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to the US business cycle (as proxied by a shock to US industrial production),  we attribute a
46:1899:103594:20:0:79:533:72:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:similar outcome to the global real shock, which can be interpreted as an international business
47:1900:103691:0:21:79:533:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:cycle factor, and find that country-specific growth shocks have little or no explanatory power
47:1901:103785:21:23:79:226:688:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:for country-specific volatility.42
47:1902:103819:23:20:96:533:665:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Consider now the forecast error variance decomposition of GDP growth reported on the right
47:1903:103909:20:21:79:533:645:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:hand side of Figure 6.  The figure shows that, on average, the forecast error variance of country
47:1904:104006:21:20:79:533:624:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:specific GDP growth is driven mostly by country-specific growth shocks and global real shocks,
47:1905:104100:20:20:79:533:604:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:with a combined share approaching 90 percent of the total in the long run (green areas with
47:1906:104191:20:21:79:533:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:squares and purple area with diagonal lines, respectively).  The country-specific growth shock
47:1907:104285:21:20:79:533:563:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:explains more than 60 percent of the total forecast error variance in the long-run, while the real
47:1908:104383:20:20:79:533:543:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:global shock on average explains around 30 percent of the total growth forecast error variance.
47:1909:104478:20:21:79:533:523:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:This is in line with existing results in the international business cycle literature (see, for instance,
47:1910:104582:21:23:79:179:502:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:Kose et al. (2003)).43
47:1911:104604:23:20:96:533:479:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Global financial shocks explain about 8-10 percent of country-specific growth forecast error
47:1912:104696:20:20:79:533:459:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:variance, on average, in our sample.  The importance of these shocks picks up gradually over the
47:1913:104792:20:21:79:533:439:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:forecast horizon and stabilizes within two years.  In contrast, the own country-specific volatility
47:1914:104891:21:20:79:533:418:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:shock, explains only a small share of the total forecast error variance of GDP growth, with a
47:1915:104984:20:20:79:532:398:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:weight of about 1−2 percent, while the combination of all other 31 country-specific volatility
47:1916:105078:20:21:79:533:378:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:shocks in the model explain only a small share of country growth variance.  These results clearly
47:1917:105175:21:20:79:533:357:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:illustrate the quantitative importance of distinguishing between common and country-specific

47:1920:105353:30:21:79:533:268:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:We  now  maintain  the  assumption  of  zero  correlations  of  country-specific  shocks  (after  condi-

47:1922:105550:20:20:79:533:227:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:between volatility and growth within each country.  Specifically, we assume that, at the coun-
47:1923:105644:20:20:79:533:207:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:try level, a volatility shock can affect growth within a quarter but notvice  versa.  This is the
47:1924:105741:20:16:79:533:187:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:assumption typically made in the empirical literature on volatility and the business cycle.  So,

47:1926:105961:15:11:79:533:156:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:be seen from Figures S.6 to S.9 also in the online Supplement, countries behave pretty similarly, with some but
47:1927:106072:11:11:79:533:145:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:limited heterogeneity.  The results for the United States, in particular, are similar to those for the average economy
47:1928:106190:11:7:79:136:134:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:reported here.
47:1929:106204:7:15:87:532:127:6:g_d0_f12:9:g_d0_f11:43Notice that these results imply that countries’ business cycles remain largely unexplained within our econo-
47:1930:106314:15:11:79:533:112:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:metric model.  Indeed, in the data, there are many shocks at work, and this is captured in our relatively simple
47:1931:106426:11:11:79:533:101:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:empirical framework by the large share of growth forecast error variance accounted for by the own country specific

48:1966:107791:20:21:79:533:274:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:is perhaps not surprising given that the correlations between the country-specific innovations,

48:1972:108242:20:21:79:533:123:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:it by computing a threshold estimator following Bailey et al. (2017), who developed a procedure
48:1973:108337:21:20:79:533:102:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:based on results from the multiple testing literature.  Specifically, we first test for the statistical
48:1974:108440:20:0:79:533:82:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:significance of each of the 2016 distinct off-diagonal elements of the (64×64) matrix.  We then
49:1975:108537:0:21:79:533:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:set to zero all those elements that are not statistically significant, using suitably adjusted critical
49:1976:108640:21:20:79:533:688:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:values to allow for the large number of tests that are being carried out.  We then finally compute
49:1977:108738:20:23:79:533:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:the GVEDs by using the regularized estimates as derived in the online supplement to the paper.
49:1978:108832:23:21:96:533:645:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Table 2 below lists all the non-zero correlation pairs.  As can be seen, only 50 out of 2016
49:1979:108924:21:20:79:533:624:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:total off-diagonal elements are statistically different from zero. Of these, about half are positively
49:1980:109026:20:20:79:533:604:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:correlated and the other half are negatively correlated, with an average value that is close to
49:1981:109121:20:21:79:533:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:zero.  Most notably, there is no surviving within-country contemporaneous correlation between
49:1982:109214:21:20:79:533:563:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:volatility and growth, except for India.  There are also very few significant GDP-GDP correlation

49:1984:109419:20:21:79:532:523:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:significant pairs of volatility-volatility correlations (i.e., ˆηitwith ˆηjt), but involving only a handful
49:1985:109526:21:20:79:533:502:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of countries, with no evidence of a dominant role for the United States.  Finally, there are a few
49:1986:109624:20:20:79:533:482:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:significant GDP-volatility correlation pairs (i.e., ˆεjtwith ˆηit) for a few countries, like Belgium,
49:1987:109725:20:23:79:453:462:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:China, France, Italy and the Netherlands, again revealing no specific patterns.

49:1998:110399:20:21:79:533:317:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:financial shocks and domestic country-specific volatility shocks continue to explain the bulk of

49:2000:110594:20:201:79:458:276:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:growth shocks remain the main drivers of the forecast error variance of growth.

52:2135:115538:32:20:96:533:273:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Panels  (A)  and  (B)  of  Figure  9  display  the  average  across  countries  of  the  volatility  and
52:2136:115642:20:20:79:533:253:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:growth responses to a real global shock.  These figures show that a positive real global shock
52:2137:115736:20:21:79:533:233:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:increases output growth and lowers volatility.  This reflects an endogenous volatility response
52:2138:115831:21:20:79:533:212:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:to the fundamental improvements in the world economy.  Note that the error bands around the
52:2139:115922:20:20:79:533:192:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:average responses are very tight, reflecting relatively homogeneous country responses.  In fact, as
52:2140:116021:20:21:79:533:172:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:can be seen from Figure S.12, provided in the online supplement, the impulse responses have a
52:2141:116114:21:20:79:533:151:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:similar shape for most countries.  The average impact of this shock on country volatilities is one
52:2142:116212:20:16:79:533:131:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:order of magnitude smaller than its impact on country output growth, but it is quite persistent,
52:2143:116308:16:15:87:532:115:6:g_d0_f12:9:g_d0_f11:45The derivation of the average impulse response functions to common factor shocks and their error bands is

52:2145:116525:11:7:79:458:89:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:to the two common shocks are reported in Figure S.12 in the online Supplement to the paper.
52:2146:116616:7:0:87:527:82:6:g_d0_f12:9:g_d0_f11:46Recall that these shocks are orthogonal to all other shocks in the model and to each other by construction.
53:2147:116727:0:21:79:533:709:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:taking more than three years for the effects of the shocks to vanish completely.  Panel (B) also
53:2148:116823:21:20:79:532:688:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:shows that, on average, country growth loads positively onˆζt, with persistent effects up to 8-10
53:2149:116920:20:20:79:533:668:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:quarters, as one would expect.  Country output growth increase by about half a percentage point
53:2150:117015:20:21:79:532:648:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:following a one-standard error change inˆζt.  This is consistent with the existing evidence on the
53:2151:117113:21:20:79:533:627:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:international business cycle,  which attributes an important role to a world factor, along with
53:2152:117208:20:23:79:516:607:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:regional and country-specific factors, in driving the business cycle (e.g., Kose et al. (2003)).
53:2153:117304:23:21:96:533:584:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Panels (C) and (D) of Figure 9 report the responses of volatility and growth to a positive
53:2154:117394:21:20:79:532:563:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:global financial shock,ˆξt.  These average responses suggest that a positive shock toˆξtis ‘bad
53:2155:117489:20:20:79:533:543:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:news’ for the world economy,  as volatility increases and growth declines.  For a one-standard
53:2156:117583:20:21:79:533:523:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:deviation  shock  to  the  common  financial  factor,  volatility  increases  by  25  basis  points,  while
53:2157:117690:21:20:79:533:502:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:growth  declines  by  about  15  basis  points  within  two  quarters  after  the  shock.47Although
53:2158:117789:20:20:79:533:482:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:smaller  than  the  growth  response  to  the  real  common  factor  shock  in  panel  B,  the  average
53:2159:117892:20:21:79:533:462:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:growth response to the global financial shock in panel D is of the same order of magnitude, and
53:2160:117987:21:20:79:533:441:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:hence quantitatively sizable.  The average responses to the common financial shock are also very
53:2161:118083:20:20:79:533:421:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:persistent, but there is much more heterogeneity in the country growth responses, as can be seen
53:2162:118179:20:20:79:533:401:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:from Figure S.12 provided in the online supplement.  Therefore, these impulse responses suggest
53:2163:118274:20:21:79:533:381:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:that, even though common financial shocks may not explain a very large share of the forecast
53:2164:118366:21:23:79:533:360:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:error variance of output growth over time, they can cause large and persistent global recessions.
53:2165:118463:23:20:96:533:337:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Impulse responses to country-specific shocks have qualitatively similar pattern of transmis-
53:2166:118555:20:21:79:533:317:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:sion but, as one would expect given the forecast error variance results, are quantitatively much
53:2167:118651:21:23:79:289:296:11:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f5:smaller than responses to common shocks.48
53:2168:118693:23:20:96:533:273:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:The pattern of shock transmissions in Figure 9 is consistent with country volatility increasing
53:2169:118788:20:20:79:533:253:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:in response to the large declines in the world output in the second part of 2008, and the world

53:2171:118980:21:20:79:533:212:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:of 2008, and the first quarter of 2009.  The transmission in Figure 9 can also help in explaining

53:2176:119442:14:8:79:310:121:9:g_d0_f11:9:g_d0_f11:but it is not imposed directly on country-specific models.

54:2179:119590:34:21:79:533:675:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Empirical measures of uncertainty behave countercyclically in most countries of the world, but
54:2180:119684:21:20:79:533:654:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:economic theory suggests that causation can run both ways.  In this paper,  we study the in-
54:2181:119776:20:20:79:533:634:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f13:terrelation between realized equity price volatility and GDP growth without imposinga priori
54:2182:119868:20:21:79:533:614:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:restrictions on the direction of economic causation.  We develop a multi-country version of the
54:2183:119963:21:20:79:533:593:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Lucas tree model with time-varying volatility and derive expressions for country-specific output
54:2184:120059:20:20:79:533:573:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:growth, equity returns and their realized volatilities in terms of innovations to a global technol-
54:2185:120158:20:21:79:533:553:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:ogy or growth factor and its higher–order moments.  We show that both a level (or first-order)
54:2186:120252:21:20:79:533:532:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:common  component  and  higher-order  common  components  are  required  to  explain  the  cross
54:2187:120348:20:20:79:533:512:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:country variations of realized volatility, but only the level common component is required for
54:2188:120442:20:21:79:533:492:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:explaining cross-country differences in output growth.  Using this theoretical insight, we estimate
54:2189:120541:21:20:79:533:471:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:a multi-country econometric model in output growth and realized volatilities for 32 countries
54:2190:120634:20:20:79:533:451:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:over the period 1993Q1-2011Q2.  Common real and financial shocks are identified assuming that
54:2191:120727:20:21:79:533:431:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:volatility and growth are driven by two common factors.  By taking a multi-country approach,
54:2192:120819:21:20:79:533:410:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:as opposed to studying a single economy in isolation, we can identify and estimate these two
54:2193:120911:20:20:79:533:390:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:factors.  Our identification strategy exploits different patterns in the correlations of volatility
54:2194:121010:20:21:79:533:370:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:and output growth innovations across countries.  Evidence based on the cross-country correla-
54:2195:121103:21:20:79:533:349:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:tions of the raw data and estimated innovations accords with the assumptions made to achieve
54:2196:121195:20:23:79:144:329:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:identification.
54:2197:121210:23:20:96:533:306:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Empirically, we report three main sets of findings.  First, shocks to the real common factor
54:2198:121302:20:21:79:533:286:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:account for most of the unconditional correlation between volatility and growth in all but few
54:2199:121396:21:20:79:533:265:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:emerging market economies.  Second, the share of forecast error variance of volatility explained
54:2200:121492:20:20:79:533:245:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:by the real common factor shock and by country-specific growth shocks is less than 5 percent.
54:2201:121585:20:21:79:533:225:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:Third, shocks to the financial common factor explain about 10 percent of the growth forecast
54:2202:121677:21:20:79:533:204:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:error variance, while country-specific volatility shocks explain only about 1-2 percent of country-
54:2203:121776:20:20:79:533:184:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:specific growth forecast error variance.  Moreover, when a shock to the financial common factor
54:2204:121871:20:21:79:533:164:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:is  realized,  its  negative  impact  on  country-specific  growth  is  large  and  persistent  as  typically
54:2205:121980:21:23:79:248:143:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:estimated in the existing literature.
54:2206:122017:23:20:96:533:120:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:These results imply that the endogenous component of country volatility is small and that
54:2207:122106:20:0:79:510:100:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:uncertainty is more important for the business cycle when the shocks are global in nature.

68:2832:141168:30:15:79:533:679:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:As noted in the paper, if we consider a panel of country equities (e.g., of firms or sectors within a
68:2833:141269:15:16:79:533:664:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:country), a different measure of uncertainty can be computed as the cross-sectional dispersion of
68:2834:141366:16:15:79:533:648:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:equity prices.  In this section we show that this concept is closely related to the realized volatility
68:2835:141469:15:16:79:533:633:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:measures we consider.  To illustrate the point with the data that we use in our application, we
68:2836:141564:16:16:79:533:617:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:derive results at the ‘country-specific versus world level’ rather than ‘firm-specific versus country
68:2837:141665:16:15:79:533:601:11:g_d0_f4:11:g_d0_f4:level’.50Specifically, we compare the cross-sectional dispersion of equity returns across countries
