2:32:1869:28:28:273:338:616:12:Times:12:Times:C:ABSTRACT
2:33:1877:28:14:72:546:588:12:Times:12:Times:C:Economists  have  developed  empirically  tractable  demand  systems  for  fixed  price  markets.  In 
2:34:1979:14:14:72:546:574:12:Times:12:Times:C:contrast, empirical   auction   techniques   treat   each   auction   in   isolation,   ignoring   market 
2:35:2084:14:14:72:546:560:12:Times:12:Times:C:interactions.  We  provide a  framework  for  estimating  demand  in  a  large  auction  market  with  a 
2:36:2188:14:14:71:546:546:12:Times:12:Times:C:dynamic  population  of  buyers with  unit  demand  and  heterogeneous  preferences  over  a  finite  set 
2:37:2293:14:14:72:545:532:12:Times:12:Times:C:of  differentiated  products.  We  offer an  empirically  tractable  equilibrium  concept  under  which 
2:38:2396:14:14:72:545:518:12:Times:12:Times:C:bidders behave as though they are in a steady-state, characterize bidding, and prove existence of 
2:39:2493:14:14:71:545:504:12:Times:12:Times:C:equilibrium. Having developed a demand system, we show that it is non-parametrically identified 
2:40:2588:14:14:71:546:490:12:Times:12:Times:C:from  panel  data,  and  that  this  result  is  robust  to  typical data  limitations,  reserve  prices,  random 
2:41:2701:14:14:72:545:476:12:Times:12:Times:C:coefficient  demand,  public  signals  that  refine  beliefs  about market  conditions,  unobserved 
2:42:2800:14:14:72:545:462:12:Times:12:Times:C:heterogeneity, idiosyncratic preferences, and random latent outside options. We apply the model 
2:43:2895:14:14:72:545:448:12:Times:12:Times:C:to estimate demand and measure consumer surplus in the market for compact cameras on eBay. 
2:44:2985:14:14:72:546:434:12:Times:12:Times:C:Our analysis highlights the importance of both dynamic bidding strategies and panel data sample 
2:45:3080:14:42:72:297:420:12:Times:12:Times:C:selection issues when analyzing these markets.

3:59:3373:0:36:72:208:671:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:1    Introduction
3:60:3390:36:18:72:540:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Most  goods  and  services  are  sold  at  fixed  prices.   Yet  auctions  are  used  as  the  allocation
3:61:3495:18:18:72:540:617:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mechanism in a wide variety of contexts, including procurement contracts, treasury bills and
3:62:3587:18:18:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the granting of oil drilling and spectrum rights.  Technology companies such as Facebook,
3:63:3676:18:18:72:540:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Google and Microsoft sell advertisers access to online consumers through display and search
3:64:3767:18:18:72:540:563:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:advertising auctions.  And though the majority of eBay’s revenue now comes from fixed price
3:65:3858:18:18:72:540:545:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:listings of new goods,  they still sell a large number of goods (both in absolute and dollar
3:66:3950:18:24:72:166:527:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:terms) by auction.
3:67:3968:24:18:72:540:503:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:These markets share many common features.  Buyers get multiple purchase opportunities
3:68:4053:18:18:72:540:485:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:over time, either for exactly the same product (e.g.  in search advertising where a product
3:69:4144:18:18:72:540:467:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is a keyword), or for close substitutes (e.g.  in treasury bill auctions).  This allows bidders to
3:70:4242:18:18:72:540:449:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:intertemporally substitute, making participation and bidding decisions in light of the option
3:71:4335:18:18:72:540:431:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:value  of  waiting  for  future  purchasing  opportunities.   Both  bids  and  participation  choices
3:72:4436:18:18:72:540:413:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:will  reflect  individual-specific  preferences  over  the  heterogeneous  products  available.   For
3:73:4537:18:18:72:540:395:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:example,  in  highway  procurement,  Lewis  and  Bajari  (2011)  document  matching  between
3:74:4629:18:18:72:540:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:contractors and contract based primarily on distance and contract size, while in online labor
3:75:4722:18:18:72:540:359:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:markets,  employers are more likely to award contracts to workers from their own country
3:76:4810:18:24:72:226:341:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(Krasnokutskaya et al., 2016).
3:77:4840:24:18:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In  the  fixed  price  context,  an  influential  discrete  choice  demand  estimation  approach  has
3:78:4941:18:18:72:540:299:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:been developed that models how buyers with unit demand and heterogeneous preferences
3:79:5025:18:18:72:540:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:decide which goods to purchase (e.g.  Berry (1994), Berry et al. (1995), Gowrisankaran and
3:80:5115:18:18:72:540:263:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Rysman (2009)).  However, until recently, there has been no analogous work in the empirical
3:81:5206:18:18:72:540:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:auctions literature, which has generally focused on the analysis of a repeated cross-section
3:82:5298:18:24:72:487:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of static auctions for identical products.  The goal of this paper is to fill this gap.
3:83:5385:24:18:72:540:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:A “whole-market” approach that incorporates dynamics and product differentiation can be
3:84:5472:18:18:72:540:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:important  for  policy  counterfactuals.   For  example,  in  setting  optimal  reserves,  a  static
3:85:5572:18:18:72:540:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model of second-price sealed bid auctions would suggest that when a monopolist changes her
3:86:5662:18:18:72:540:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reserve price policy, she should expect no change in buyer behavior (it is weakly dominant
3:87:5752:18:18:72:540:131:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for a buyer to bid their valuation regardless).  By contrast, in our dynamic setting, a new
3:88:5843:18:19:72:540:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reserve  price  policy  will  affect  buyer’s  continuation  values,  and  therefore  bids  throughout
3:89:5945:19:18:72:540:94:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the marketplace.  Reserve prices will also have an effect on the endogenous set of incumbent
3:90:6037:18:0:72:540:76:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bidders.  And without taking product differentiation seriously, we cannot use auction data to
4:91:6131:0:18:72:540:671:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:say much about cross-price elasticities, or how an increase in the supply of one good would
4:92:6222:18:18:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:affect the transaction prices of other goods (see Newberry (2015) for evidence that increased
4:93:6315:18:24:72:243:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:supply depresses prices on eBay).
4:94:6348:24:18:72:540:611:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The present paper analyzes a model that is very closely related to the above work on fixed
4:95:6438:18:18:72:540:593:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price  markets,  but  with  a  data-generating  process  that  is  given  by  equilibrium  play  in  a
4:96:6540:18:18:72:540:575:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dynamic auction market.  Vis-`a-vis that literature, our approach is analogous to the second-
4:97:6633:18:18:72:540:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:choice  demand  estimation  approach  of  Berry  et  al.  (2004)  because  we  use  bids  placed  by
4:98:6733:18:18:72:540:539:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the same bidder on different products.  This is informative about thejointdistribution of
4:99:6822:18:19:72:540:521:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:valuations  or,  in  the  parlance  of  the  fixed-price  market  literature,  cross-elasticities.   The
4:100:6926:19:18:72:540:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:auction format also allows us to credibly identify a region of the distribution of valuations
4:101:7019:18:18:72:540:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that  we  often  struggle  with:  the  right  tail.   This  region  can  be  hard  to  identify  in  fixed–
4:102:7126:18:18:72:540:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price markets because of limited variation in characteristics (in particular, prices);  for the
4:103:7221:18:18:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:subset of buyers whose choice behavior doesn’t change over the support of observed prices,
4:104:7311:18:18:72:540:430:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:identification is entirely parametric.  To put it more succinctly, we can’t invert an inequality,
4:105:7408:18:24:72:190:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:but we can invert bids.
4:106:7431:24:18:72:540:388:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Here  we  offer  what  we  hope  is  a  comprehensive  analysis  of  our  model:   we  characterize
4:107:7530:18:18:72:540:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:participation and bidding decisions, prove existence of equilibrium, offer a number of non-
4:108:7621:18:18:72:540:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parametric identification results, and apply the model to measure consumer surplus in the
4:109:7710:18:18:72:540:334:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:market for compact cameras on eBay.  Along the way, we deal with many of the method-
4:110:7794:18:23:72:455:316:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ological issues that are likely to arise in similar models of auction markets.
4:111:7872:23:19:72:540:293:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Specifically, we consider a model of repeated second-price auctions of differentiated products,
4:112:7967:19:18:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in  which  buyers  with  unit  demand  and  heterogeneous,  perfectly  persistent  and  privately
4:113:8064:18:18:72:540:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:known multidimensional valuations for a finite set of types of good must work out when to
4:114:8153:18:18:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:participate and how much to bid.  Persistence of preferences is a realistic feature of many
4:115:8244:18:18:72:540:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:auction markets, but causes game theoretic problems that do not arise in fixed price markets.
4:116:8337:18:18:72:540:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:So-called “leakage effects” are a particular concern, whereby a bidder’s bid today may reveal
4:117:8430:18:18:72:540:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their valuation to other bidders, affecting the evolution of future play (this remains true even
4:118:8526:18:18:72:540:166:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:when other bidders cannot observe rival bids; less information just implies a harder filtration
4:119:8621:18:24:72:325:148:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:problem for the bidders and the outside analyst).
4:120:8670:24:18:72:540:124:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:When markets are “small” (in the sense that there are few bidders in the market), the ap-
4:121:8759:18:18:72:540:106:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:proach of the dynamic games literature has been to simply assume that everything persistent
4:122:8850:18:0:72:540:88:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is commonly known, and that all private shocks are iid (see e.g.  Jofre-Bonet and Pesendorfer

5:124:9036:18:18:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  Pakes  (2012)  is  a  recent  exception).   But  in  “large”  markets  (i.e.   many  anonymous
5:125:9135:18:18:72:540:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bidders), it is attractive to instead assume that players form beliefs about their rivals in a
5:126:9229:18:19:72:540:617:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:simpler way.  Here we assume that bidders simply take the distribution of rival bids for each
5:127:9322:19:18:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:product as given and optimize against this, forming neither more refined beliefs (by condi-
5:128:9413:18:18:72:540:580:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tioning on other information available to them) nor considering the possibility of trying to
5:129:9505:18:18:72:540:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:manipulate the evolution of this distribution with their bid.  An equilibrium is a fixed point
5:130:9599:18:18:72:540:544:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in which bidders optimize given their beliefs about rival bids, and those beliefs are consistent
5:131:9695:18:18:72:540:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with the long run time-averages of equilibrium play, i.e.  the stationary distribution.  This is
5:132:9791:18:18:72:540:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:similar to ideas elsewhere in the literature, such as the model of belief formation in Krusell
5:133:9885:18:18:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  Smith  (1998)  and  the  oblivious  /  mean-field  equilibrium  concept  of  Weintraub  et  al.
5:134:9985:18:24:72:221:472:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(2008) and Iyer et al. (2014).
5:135:10015:24:18:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In equilibrium, losing bidders “win” the opportunity to play the game again tomorrow.  The
5:136:10105:18:18:72:540:430:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:optimal strategy requires that bidders bid their valuation less their continuation value when-
5:137:10199:18:18:72:540:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ever this is positive, and otherwise not participate.  A bidder’s valuation is thus identified
5:138:10293:18:18:72:540:394:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by adding their bid to their continuation value.  In other words, to estimate demand, one
5:139:10382:18:18:72:540:376:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:must  estimate  continuation  values.   We  show  that  these  can  be  learned  from  observing  a
5:140:10481:18:18:72:540:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bidder’s “pseudo-type” — their optimal bid on each product — as well as the distributions
5:141:10570:18:24:72:347:340:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:of competing bids and the exit and supply processes.1
5:142:10623:24:18:72:540:316:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The  existence  of  an  inversion  from  bids  to  types  is  often  sufficient  to  prove  identification
5:143:10729:18:18:72:540:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in  static  auctions  (e.g.   Guerre  et  al.  (2000),  Athey  and  Haile  (2007)):  when  each  bidder
5:144:10832:18:18:72:540:280:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bids  exactly  once,  the  distribution  of  pseudo-types  is  just  the  distribution  of  bids,  which
5:145:10936:18:18:72:540:262:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is observed.  But when bidders bid multiple times, they may win (an therefore exit) before
5:146:11026:18:18:72:540:244:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:recording a “complete,” or invertible, history consisting of a bid on every product (i.e.  before
5:147:11123:18:18:72:540:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their  pseudo-type  is  known).   The  probability  of  reaching  a  complete  history  varies  with
5:148:11223:18:18:72:540:208:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:type, so we need to correct for selection in measuring the distribution of pseudo-types.  By
5:149:11315:18:18:72:540:190:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:combining  this  new  selection  correction  idea  with  the  familiar  inversion  approach,  we  are
5:150:11416:18:18:72:540:172:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:able to bound demand.  Our identification result is pointwise up to the set of bidders who
5:151:11506:18:24:72:288:154:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prefer not to participate in some auctions.
5:152:11549:24:18:72:540:130:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In  subsequent  sections,  we  extend  the  model  to  cases  with  limited  data,  reserve  prices,
5:153:11649:18:15:85:539:112:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:1A common refrain in the empirical auctions literature is that losers’ payoffs are “normalized to zero.”
5:154:11753:15:12:72:540:97:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:We view this as a strong assumption, rather than a normalization.  In our model the continuation value that
5:155:11860:12:0:72:540:85:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:bidders anticipate when they lose is not constant across bidders, but instead depends on their private type.

6:157:12061:18:18:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:served heterogeneity, idiosyncratic preferences and random latent outside options.  Most of
6:158:12152:18:18:72:540:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:these extensions are reasonably straightforward given the tools developed earlier, as well as
6:159:12245:18:19:72:540:617:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:results on deconvolution used in Li and Vuong (1998) and Krasnokutskaya (2011).  The main
6:160:12334:19:18:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:exception is the case with outside options and endogenous exit, which is harder.  There we
6:161:12424:18:18:72:540:580:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:show that observable differences in the exit rate across bidders imply a first order separable
6:162:12518:18:23:72:504:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:differential equation that can be used to identify differences in their outside options.
6:163:12606:23:18:72:540:539:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The final section of the paper applies this framework to data from eBay’s compact camera
6:164:12694:18:19:72:540:521:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:market.  We document that substitution over time and across cameras with different levels of
6:165:12786:19:18:72:540:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:resolution occurs in this market, and that there is both observable and unobservable hetero-
6:166:12878:18:18:72:540:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:geneity within cameras of a given resolution.  We model preferences as a linear combination
6:167:12969:18:18:72:540:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of a random taste for a camera and a random taste for camera resolution, and estimate the
6:168:13058:18:18:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:distribution of these random coefficients.  We show that our estimated model is able to match
6:169:13151:18:18:72:540:430:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the data well, and then use it to calculate consumer surplus.  We find that consumer surplus
6:170:13243:18:18:72:540:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is twice as large as we would have estimated had we ignored continuation values, $6.04 per
6:171:13333:18:18:72:540:394:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bidder rather than $2.73.  We chose the application for its expositional value rather than any
6:172:13427:18:18:72:540:376:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:policy implications:  it gives us the opportunity to show how our methodology can be im-
6:173:13515:18:18:72:540:358:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:plemented with limited data; how it fares under unobserved heterogeneity, and to illustrate
6:174:13606:18:40:72:492:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that dynamics and substitution are important for understanding auction markets.
6:175:13685:40:19:72:539:300:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:B:Literature  Review.The  paper  is  related  to  various  strands  of  literature.   Jofre-Bonet
6:176:13780:19:18:72:540:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and Pesendorfer (2003) was the first paper to attack estimation in a dynamic auction game.
6:177:13870:18:18:72:540:263:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Subsequent to this, a number of papers have looked at dynamics on the eBay platform specif-
6:178:13961:18:18:72:540:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ically.  Budish (2008) examines the optimality of eBay’s market design with respect to the
6:179:14051:18:18:72:540:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sequencing of sales and information revelation.  In Said (2009), the author investigates effi-
6:180:14145:18:18:72:540:209:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ciency and revenue maximization in a similar setup through the lens of dynamic mechanism
6:181:14233:18:18:72:540:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:design.   Zeithammer  (2006)  developed  a  model  with  forward-looking  bidders,  and  showed
6:182:14328:18:18:72:540:173:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:both theoretically and empirically that bidders shade down current bids in response to the
6:183:14418:18:18:72:540:155:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:presence of upcoming auctions of similar objects.  Ingster (2009) develops a dynamic model
6:184:14508:18:18:72:540:137:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of auctions of identical objects, and provides equilibrium characterization and identification
6:185:14602:18:18:72:540:119:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:results.   Sailer  (2006)  estimates  participation  costs  for  bidders  facing  an  infinite  sequence
6:186:14706:18:18:72:540:101:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of identical auctions.  Nekipelov (2007) analyzes a model where bidders attempt to prevent
6:187:14796:18:0:72:540:83:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:learning by late bidding, while Hopenhayn and Saeedi (2016) develop and estimate a model
7:188:14885:0:18:72:540:671:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in which bidder’s bidding opportunities and valuations evolve dynamically within an auc-
7:189:14973:18:18:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tion according to a Markov process.  Bodoh-Creed et al. (2013) employ our methodology in
7:190:15061:18:18:72:540:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:analyzing the optimal fee structure for the eBay platform.  Hendricks and Sorensen (2014)
7:191:15150:18:19:72:540:617:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:offer a model, similar to our own but in continuous time and with a single product type, and
7:192:15242:19:23:72:348:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:analyze the efficiency of the eBay trading mechanism.
7:193:15295:23:18:72:540:575:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Relative  to  this  literature,  our  main  contribution  is  the  focus  on  sequential  auctions  of
7:194:15397:18:18:72:540:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:heterogeneous  objects,  where  bidders  have  multidimensional persistent  private  valuations.
7:195:15493:18:18:72:540:539:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In short, we are focused on developing a demand system.  This is also a topic of interest in
7:196:15585:18:19:72:540:521:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:other recent papers.  Adams (2009) examines the problem of nonparametric identification
7:197:15672:19:18:72:540:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:when differentiated products are sold by simultaneous auction,  and Krasnokutskaya et al.
7:198:15761:18:18:72:540:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(2014) develop a model of participation and bidding in an online labor market.  Our paper
7:199:15850:18:18:72:540:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:differs from these papers in allowing buyers to participate repeatedly and dealing with the
7:200:15941:18:18:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dynamic  issues  this  creates.   One  of  the  advantages  of  using  a  dynamic  model  is  that  we
7:201:16043:18:18:72:540:430:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are  able  to  make  use  of  panel  data  in  estimation,  rather  than  treating  it  as  a  repeated
7:202:16146:18:40:72:446:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cross-section, which allows identification of individual bidder preferences.
7:203:16222:40:18:72:539:372:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:B:Paper Structure.The paper proceeds as follows.  In the next section we introduce the
7:204:16306:18:18:72:540:354:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:basic model, and prove existence of and characterize equilibrium.  Sections 3 and 4 discuss
7:205:16397:18:18:72:540:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:non-parametric identification of the basic model and a series of extensions. Section 5 presents
7:206:16492:18:51:72:290:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:our application, while Section 6 concludes.
7:207:16535:51:36:72:377:267:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:2    Model and Equilibrium Analysis
7:208:16570:36:18:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We  consider  a  market  in  which  competing  products  are  sold  by  second-price  sealed  bid
7:209:16667:18:18:72:540:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:auctions.  These auctions are held in discrete time, with either zero or one good auctioned
7:210:16758:18:18:72:540:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:per period over an infinite horizon.  Since our focus is on demand, we assume for simplicity
7:211:16850:18:18:72:540:177:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that supply is random and exogenous.  Bidders have unit demand, and enter the market with
7:212:16939:18:18:72:540:159:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:private and perfectly persistent valuations for each of the objects.  They are inattentive, and
7:213:17034:18:18:72:540:141:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are  active  in  any  particular  period  with  constant  probability.   When  active,  they  choose
7:214:17134:18:18:72:540:123:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:whether or not to participate in the current auction, and how much to bid.  We show that
7:215:17222:18:19:72:540:105:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:they bid their valuation less their continuation value, and assume they assess the latter based
7:216:17317:19:0:72:540:86:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on the steady-state distribution of supply and competing bids, rather than on current market
8:217:17410:0:18:72:540:671:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:conditions (e.g.  the number of competing bidders in the current auction).  Winning bidders
8:218:17501:18:24:72:493:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:exit the market with certainty, while losing bidders exit with constant probability.
8:219:17585:24:18:72:540:629:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We  have  chosen  this  set  of  assumptions  to  match  some  features  of  the  market  for  digital
8:220:17687:18:18:72:540:611:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cameras on eBay, which is our empirical application.  In any eBay category (such as digital
8:221:17778:18:18:72:540:593:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cameras), there are many different products sold by auction to a large number of anonymous
8:222:17868:18:18:72:540:575:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:buyers.2Although these auctions typically last for many days, and thus overlap — so that
8:223:17956:18:18:72:540:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at any given point in time there are many auctions occurring simultaneously — they finish
8:224:18045:18:18:72:540:539:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:at different ending times, in sequence.  As Bajari and Horta ̧csu (2004) and Hendricks and
8:225:18135:18:19:72:540:521:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Porter  (2007)  have  noted,  this  timing,  combined  with  the  way  the  proxy  bidding  system
8:226:18233:19:44:72:540:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:works, imply that eBay is well approximated as sequence of second-price sealed bid auctions.
8:227:18325:44:32:72:200:458:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:2.1    Environment
8:228:18343:32:40:72:437:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We formalize the above description of the environment in what follows:
8:229:18413:40:18:72:540:386:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:B:Supply.There areJdistinct kinds of goods sold in a market, indexed byj= 1...J.  We
8:230:18495:18:18:71:539:368:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:denote the set of products byJ.  In each periodt, a good may be available for purchase.
8:231:18582:18:18:71:539:350:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Supply  is  exogenous  and  Markov,  with  the  current  productjtdrawn  from  a  stationary
8:232:18674:18:18:71:539:332:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:multinomial distribution conditional on the lagged productjt−1.  We allow for the possibility
8:233:18767:18:19:71:539:314:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that no product is available in a given period, and so supply can be summarized by a square
8:234:18858:19:18:71:540:295:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:transition matrixQof sizeJ+ 1×J+ 1, where the entryQj,kgives the probability product
8:235:18942:18:18:71:539:277:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:B:kwill be supplied next whenjis currently offered (and the last row and column give the
8:236:19028:18:18:71:539:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cases where no product is offered now and will be offered later, respectively).  We assume
8:237:19118:18:18:71:539:241:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:moreover that the multinomials have full support, so that regardless of what was supplied
8:238:19207:18:18:71:539:223:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:att−1, it is possible that any of theJproducts (or nothing) is supplied att.  When a good
8:239:19296:18:40:71:360:205:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is available, it is sold by second-price sealed-bid auction.
8:240:19356:40:18:71:539:165:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:B:Demand.At the beginning of each period,Etbuyers enter the market, whereEtis sampled
8:241:19439:18:18:71:539:147:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:independently over time from a distributionFEwith support{0,1,2...E}.  Each buyer has
8:242:19524:18:18:72:540:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unit demand,  and has aperfectly  persistentvalue for each of the goods summarized by a
8:243:19611:18:18:72:539:111:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:privately known vector of valuationsx= (x1,x2···xJ)∈RJ.  This value is drawn iid across
8:244:19698:18:18:72:539:93:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:buyers on entry according to a distributionFwith strictly positive density over its support
8:245:19789:18:0:85:474:75:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:A:2eBay hides the identity of the bidders by replacing parts of the username with asterisks.
9:246:19880:0:18:72:540:671:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:B:X= [0,x]J.  The new entrants combine with the population of buyers from previous periods
9:247:19968:18:18:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to form a cohort of bidders of sizeNt.  To ensure that the maximum number of buyersNis
9:248:20054:18:24:72:401:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bounded, we assume that whenNt=N, no-one enters (Et= 0).
9:249:20110:24:18:72:540:611:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:New entrants are always active; the remaining incumbent members of the cohort are active
9:250:20198:18:18:72:540:593:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in each period with iid chanceτ.  Active buyers participate in the current auction (if one
9:251:20288:18:18:72:540:575:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is held), observing the product currently under auction, and placing a weakly positive bid
9:252:20378:18:18:72:540:557:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:B:b∈R+.   We  assume  that  the  good  sells  only  if  the  highest  bid  isstrictlypositive,  so  a
9:253:20477:18:18:71:539:539:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:buyer can always opt-out of an auction by bidding zero.  Agents are risk-neutral and have
9:254:20566:18:19:71:539:521:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quasi-linear utility, receiving a total payoff ofxj−pfor buying a goodjat pricep, and zero
9:255:20656:19:18:71:539:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:otherwise.  If an auction is held and a bidder wins the auction, they exit the market.  All
9:256:20747:18:18:71:540:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:other active bidders exit with probability (1−r) (i.e.r∈(0,1) is the survival rate).  Inactive
9:257:20841:18:18:71:539:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bidders do not exit.  We assume that agents do not discount future payoffs,  although the
9:258:20930:18:18:71:539:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:exogenous  exit  probability  effectively  leads  to  discounting.   We  discuss  bidder  beliefs  and
9:259:21032:18:45:71:222:430:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:strategies in the next section.
9:260:21063:45:31:71:167:385:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:2.2    Analysis
9:261:21078:31:18:71:539:354:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We begin our analysis by looking at the buyer’s incentives.  In our application to the compact
9:262:21172:18:18:71:539:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:camera market on eBay, it seems reasonable to assume that buyers have simple models of
9:263:21258:18:18:71:539:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the competition they face.  We formalize this idea by assuming that bidders believe that the
9:264:21350:18:18:71:539:300:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:distribution of the highest competing bid is equal to the historical average and best respond
9:265:21443:18:18:71:539:282:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:accordingly  (this  assumption  or  some  variant  is  implicitly  used  in  the  existing  literature
9:266:21545:18:18:71:539:264:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(Ingster, 2009; Hendricks and Sorensen, 2014)).  LetB1jbe a random variable denoting the
9:267:21633:18:28:71:521:246:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:highest bid in an auction for goodj, and letG1jbe its cumulative distribution function.
9:268:21720:28:18:71:540:218:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:F:Assumption 1(Beliefs about competing bids).Following any history of play, bidders
9:269:21801:18:34:71:466:200:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:believe that the highest rival bid in an auction for goodjhas distributionG1j.
9:270:21879:34:18:71:539:166:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This is a sensible way for bidders to form beliefs, though it is non-standard.  Agents in games
9:271:21974:18:18:71:539:148:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are usually modeled as Bayesian, and so would condition on the recent bidding history and
9:272:22063:18:18:71:539:130:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:any other observables in their information set (e.g.  the number of competing bidders in the
9:273:22155:18:18:71:539:112:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:current auction) to update their prior and form a posterior over the current distribution of
9:274:22247:18:18:71:539:94:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:types  in  the  market.3We  have  elected  to  model  bidder  beliefs  in  this  way  both  because
9:275:22346:18:0:85:539:76:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:3Even if this data was hidden a bidder could learn from their own experience over time (e.g.  a bidder
10:276:22449:0:18:72:540:671:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:it  substantively  simplifies  the  game  theory,  and  because  the  gap  between  the  behavior  of
10:277:22550:18:24:72:502:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sophisticated Bayesian bidders and those that obey assumption 1 is probably small.
10:278:22632:24:18:72:540:629:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Just as information about competitor valuations has no effect on the optimal bid in a static
10:279:22724:18:18:72:540:611:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:second-price auction, knowing the current distribution of types in the market is useful only
10:280:22816:18:18:72:540:593:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to  the  extent  that  it  predictsfuturecompetition,  which  determines  continuation  values.
10:281:22911:18:18:71:539:575:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Since bidders participate only intermittently and eBay is a large market with high turnover
10:282:23002:18:18:71:539:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  market  participants,  current  market  conditions  have  little  predictive  power  for  future
10:283:23102:18:18:71:539:539:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:competition.  Assumption 1 is thus a good approximation to the behavior of Bayesian bidders
10:284:23193:18:19:71:539:521:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in this marketplace, though the model can be extended to weaken this assumption and allow
10:285:23282:19:23:71:396:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bidders to condition on other state variables (see section 4.3.2).
10:286:23348:23:18:71:539:479:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Under this assumption, the only payoff relevant-information in each period is the bidder’s
10:287:23438:18:18:71:539:461:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:type and the current object under auction (we show this below).  So without loss of generality
10:288:23532:18:18:71:539:443:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a pure strategy is just a vectorβ:X →RJ, a bid on each product as a function of type, with
10:289:23622:18:18:72:539:425:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:B:jth coordinateβj.  Moreover, letμβj(·) denote the ergodic measure of the first-order statistic
10:290:23716:18:19:72:540:407:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of bids, which depends onβ.4We can think of this measure as capturing the time-average
10:291:23802:19:18:72:540:388:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we would compute if we picked aβand simulated the market for an arbitrarily long time.
10:292:23888:18:18:72:540:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We are now in a position to define what it means for the market to be in equilibrium (subject
10:293:23981:18:28:72:219:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to our restriction on beliefs):
10:294:24012:28:33:72:529:324:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:C:Definition 1(Equilibrium).A pure strategy equilibrium is a tuple(βe,{G1j})such that
10:295:24095:33:28:82:488:291:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:A:(Optimality)βe(x)is a best response for typexgiven beliefs{G1j(b)}j∈J, and
10:296:24169:28:0:73:279:263:12:g_d0_f4:8:g_d0_f10:C:(Consistency)  for everyj,G1j(b) =μβ

10:298:24206:11:31:274:320:260:8:g_d0_f10:12:g_d0_f4:?:j([0,b]).
10:299:24215:31:18:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The definition mirrors the requirements for a Bayes–Nash equilibrium: play must be optimal
10:300:24305:18:18:72:540:211:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:given beliefs, and beliefs must be consistent with play. The consistency requirement explicitly
10:301:24400:18:18:72:540:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:connects beliefs, as specified by Assumption 1, to the distribution of the highest bid on each
10:302:24494:18:22:72:259:175:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:product implied by rivals’ strategies.
10:303:24532:22:12:72:540:153:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:who lost yesterday might reason that competition was fierce yesterday,  and may still be so today).  This
10:304:24637:12:12:72:540:141:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:gives rise to a winner’s curse effect (Budish, 2008).  There is some evidence that this kind of learning occurs
10:305:24748:12:12:72:540:129:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:on eBay:  Coey et al. (2015) show that bidders tend to (modestly) increase their bids in subsequent auctions
10:306:24856:12:8:72:441:117:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:for the same product, although they attribute this to deadlines rather than learning.
10:307:24941:8:15:85:540:109:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:4In an earlier version of this paper, we proved that for anyβ, such an ergodic measure exists, is unique
10:308:25045:15:12:71:539:94:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:and converged to at geometric rate - details available on request.  The speed of convergence makes us more
10:309:25151:12:0:71:357:82:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:confident that the data is drawn from the recurrent ergodic class.
11:310:25218:0:18:72:540:671:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We can now specify the buyer’s decision problem.  It is dynamic, since losers may have an
11:311:25307:18:18:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:opportunity to bid at a later date.  The relevant state variables are just the buyer’s type
11:312:25398:18:18:72:540:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  the  product–type  currently  being  auctioned,  since  Assumption  1  implies  that  this  is
11:313:25497:18:19:72:540:617:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sufficient for beliefs about the highest competing bid (which together with the bid determines
11:314:25591:19:18:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:allocations  and  payments).   These  state  variables  are  Markov,  and  so  the  buyer  faces  a
11:315:25690:18:23:72:204:580:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Markov decision problem.

11:321:25897:18:19:71:539:521:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that asτ→0 (so that bidders are infrequently active), each row of ̃Qwill converge to the

11:337:26448:18:18:71:539:321:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:given  by  the  second-highest  bid  (potentially  zero).   The  second  term  represents  the  case
11:338:26548:18:18:71:539:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:where the bidder loses and survives to bid another day, obtaining their continuation value
11:339:26638:18:18:71:539:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for the next period in which they will be active.  These events determined by the realization
11:340:26731:18:19:71:539:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the highest competing bid, which by Assumption 1 the bidder believes to be distributed
11:341:26820:19:28:71:413:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:according toG1j.  Solving the above maximization problem, we get:
11:342:26885:28:18:71:540:220:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:F:Lemma 1(Best Responses).Suppose that beliefs satisfy Assumption 1.  Then a bidder’s
11:343:26968:18:18:71:539:202:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:F:expected  payoff  is  maximized  by  bidding  their  valuation  less  continuation  value  if  this  is
11:344:27071:18:33:71:256:184:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:positive, and otherwise bidding zero:

12:353:27394:27:15:72:540:471:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Figure 1:  These figures offer an illustration of the bidding strategies described by Lemma
12:354:27485:15:14:72:540:456:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1 in a two-dimensional example.  In panel 1(a) the two functions represent optimal bids on
12:355:27575:14:15:72:540:442:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:product 1 as a function of bidders’ valuations for good 1, fixing their valuation for good 2.
12:356:27668:15:14:72:540:427:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Panel 1(b) represents three exemplary bidders:  their types{x,x′,x′′}and their associated
12:357:27757:14:36:72:288:413:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bids{b,b′,b′′}.  See the text for discussion.
12:358:27802:36:18:72:540:377:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In static second price auctions, bidders bid their values so that they are indifferent between
12:359:27896:18:19:72:540:359:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:marginally winning (paying their bid, earning zero surplus) and marginally losing (earning
12:360:27986:19:18:72:540:340:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:zero surplus).  The same logic applies here:  bidders must be indifferent between marginally
12:361:28078:18:18:72:540:322:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:winning and losing, and since losers receive their continuation value, bids must be equal to
12:362:28170:18:18:72:540:304:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:value less continuation value.  It is possible that a bidder prefers to wait for a product they
12:363:28265:18:18:72:540:286:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:value more highly rather than win the current object at a price of zero, in which case opting
12:364:28358:18:23:72:305:268:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:out of the auction by bidding zero is optimal.
12:365:28404:23:19:72:540:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The assumption that bids are either zero or interior to the support of{G1j}j∈Jis necessary
12:366:28494:19:18:72:539:226:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for uniqueness,  since if there is an interval [b,b′] on which rival bids are unsupported and
12:367:28587:18:18:72:540:208:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the putatively unique best response falls in this range, any other bid in the range will also
12:368:28680:18:18:72:540:190:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be a best response.  Note that the characterization in (2) is implicit — i.e.,vj(x) is defined
12:369:28774:18:18:72:540:172:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:recursively  according  to  the  Bellman  equation  in  (1)  —  but  since  the  value  functions  in
12:370:28875:18:18:72:540:154:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Markov Decision Problems are unique (Stokey et al., 1989), the characterization of optimal
12:371:28965:18:18:72:540:136:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bids as valuations less continuation values immediately delivers uniqueness of{βj(x)}(i.e.
12:372:29055:18:18:72:540:118:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that they are functions).  Continuity follows from the continuity of payoffs in types.  Mono-
12:373:29148:18:18:72:540:100:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tonicity is natural:  if a bidder values objectjmore, they optimally increase their bid for it,
12:374:29243:18:0:72:406:82:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and correspondingly shade their bids on substitute objects down.
13:375:29309:0:18:72:540:671:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We offer some graphical intuition for the bidding strategies of Lemma 1 in Figure 1 with a
13:376:29399:18:18:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:two-dimensional example.  Panel 1(a) depicts the monotonicity properties of optimal bids.
13:377:29488:18:18:72:540:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The more a bidder values product 1 the more she bids on it.  However, bidders with higher
13:378:29577:18:19:72:540:617:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:valuations also shade more; a bidder’s continuation value is monotone increasing in her value
13:379:29670:19:18:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for product 1,  which induces the concavity of the function.  Increases in her valuation for
13:380:29762:18:18:72:540:580:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:product 2 cause a level shift, and may even drive non–participation ifx1is small — orx2is
13:381:29851:18:18:72:540:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:large — enough.  Panel 1(b) depicts three conjectured bidder types (x, x’, and x”) and their
13:382:29943:18:18:72:540:544:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:corresponding bids (b, b’, and b” respectively).  The bidder of typexhas a high valuation
13:383:30032:18:18:72:540:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for both products and therefore shades both of her bids substantially.  The bidder of type
13:384:30122:18:18:72:540:508:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:B:x′gets the same high utility from product 1, but zero utility from product 2.  Therefore she
13:385:30214:18:18:72:540:490:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:does not participate in auctions of product 2; she prefers to wait for auctions of product 1.
13:386:30307:18:18:72:540:472:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Finally, the bidder of typex′′is unlikely to win in either state of the world, and therefore
13:387:30399:18:28:72:379:454:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:shades her bid very little, but participates in both auctions.
13:388:30461:28:18:72:539:426:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:F:Theorem 1(Existence).A pure strategy equilibrium exists in which strategies are charac-
13:389:30548:18:18:72:540:408:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:F:terized by Lemma 1.  WhenJ= 1, there is a unique equilibrium within the class of strategies
13:390:30639:18:34:72:209:390:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:characterized by Lemma 1.
13:391:30664:34:18:72:540:356:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The  proof  is  non-trivial.   We  must  find  a  fixed  point  in  strategy-space:   the  equilibrium
13:392:30766:18:18:72:540:338:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:strategiesβemust be a best response to the distributions{G1j}, i.e.  the ergodic distributions
13:393:30860:18:18:72:539:320:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the highest competing bid on each product generated byβeand the entry, supply and exit
13:394:30949:18:18:72:540:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:processes.  To show that such a strategyβeexists, we apply Schauder’s fixed point theorem
13:395:31038:18:18:72:539:284:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on the space of continuous functions on the type spaceX.  Doing so requires some functional
13:396:31129:18:18:72:540:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:analysis.  In the appendix we show that the set of best responses to any continuous bidding
13:397:31220:18:18:72:540:248:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:function is uniformly equicontinuous and bounded (a compactness condition), and that the
13:398:31308:18:24:72:488:230:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:best response varies smoothly with the bidding function (a continuity condition).
13:399:31389:24:18:72:540:206:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The case with a single product (J= 1) is easier, and we can prove uniqueness of equilibrium.
13:400:31481:18:18:72:540:188:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This is because the types are totally ordered and monotone bidding preserves that ordering,
13:401:31572:18:18:72:540:170:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:so that the chance of winning an auction is entirely pinned down by a bidder’s type.  As a
13:402:31662:18:18:72:540:152:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:result who wins and who loses can be determined without knowing the equilibrium bidding
13:403:31749:18:18:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:function, so that the economy admits a unique ergodic distribution of types.  Uniqueness of
13:404:31840:18:18:72:380:116:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:optimal bids follows from a contraction mapping argument.5
13:405:31898:18:16:85:539:98:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:5That uniqueness result for the single product case is only within the class of strategies characterized by
13:406:32005:16:0:72:540:82:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:Lemma 1:  somewhat trivially, it is possible to construct an equilibrium in which a point mass of bidders for

14:408:32135:36:18:72:540:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In this section we state and prove the main theoretical result of the paper, which is that the
14:409:32229:18:18:72:540:617:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:demand  system  outlined  above  is  non-parametrically  identified  up  to  constraints  imposed
14:410:32326:18:18:72:540:599:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by non-participation (a limitation we make precise below).  We think this is useful because
14:411:32417:18:18:72:540:581:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:it makes explicit the assumptions that are needed to identify the primitives of the dynamic
14:412:32508:18:18:72:540:563:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:game.  Our result is constructive, so it also provides some guidance as to a sensible estimation
14:413:32604:18:24:72:116:545:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:strategy.
14:414:32613:24:18:72:540:521:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We  begin  with  a  scenario  in  which  the  econometrician  has  excellent  data  and  wishes  to
14:415:32712:18:18:72:540:503:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:estimate the baseline model of Section 2 (we investigate cases with limited data and more
14:416:32801:18:28:72:303:485:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:complex demand models in Section 4 below).
14:417:32843:28:18:72:539:457:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:F:Assumption  2(Observable  Data).In  every  auction,  the  econometrician  observes  the
14:418:32930:18:34:72:528:439:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:product-type being sold, all positive bids and the identities of the bidders that made them.
14:419:33022:34:18:72:540:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Even  in  this  case  we  assume  that  the  econometrician  does  not  observe  zero  bids,  since
14:420:33121:18:18:72:540:387:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:those stand in for non-participation in our model (i.e.  non-participation is non-observable).
14:421:33215:18:18:72:540:369:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Despite this, identification of a number of components of the model follows directly.  First,

14:426:33598:18:18:71:539:273:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:analogs because some types will optimally choose to not participate even when active.  To
14:427:33687:18:18:71:540:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:deal  with  this,  we  measureτandrfrom  a  sample  consisting  of  bidders  who  have  been
14:428:33779:18:18:71:539:237:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:observed bidding on every product.  Such bidders have revealed themselves to be types that
14:429:33869:18:18:71:539:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:will participate whenever active.  Define for each of these bidders a qualifying timet1i, the
14:430:33962:18:18:71:539:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:time at which they qualified to be in this subset (i.e.  the time at which they bid on the last
14:431:34057:18:42:71:502:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:remaining product they had not previously bid on).  Then for bidders in this sample

15:447:34709:32:18:72:539:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In view of the above analysis showing thatr, ̃Qand{G1j}j∈Jare identified,ξis also identified.
15:448:34802:18:18:72:539:493:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Notice thatξ(b) is equal to the vector of of a buyer’s bids plus a second term that is equal
15:449:34894:18:18:72:540:475:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to their vector of continuation values.6There is a clear intuition for the second term:  when
15:450:34987:18:18:72:540:457:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a buyer wins with a bidbj, he gets a payoff equal to his value less the expected payment,
15:451:35076:18:18:72:540:439:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which we can decompose as (bj−E[B1j|B1j< bj]) + (xj−bj).  The latter component is equal
15:452:35163:18:18:72:539:421:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to his continuation value (Lemma 1 again, as he only wins ifbj>0), and so the payoff can
15:453:35251:18:18:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be written as (bj−E[B1j|B1j< bj]) plus an opportunity to play the game again.  The buyer’s
15:454:35341:18:18:72:539:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:continuation value is thus equal in value to the stream of payments from a set ofJannuities,
15:455:35433:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:where thejth paysG1(bj)(bj−E[B1j|B1j< bj]) in expectation wheneverjis auctioned.  The

15:457:35602:24:18:72:540:325:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In view of Lemma 1, this sum in (5) equal to the bidder’s value whenever the bid is positive,
15:458:35695:18:18:72:540:307:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:soξis an inverse bidding function on the regionb>0.  When components of the bid vector
15:459:35781:18:18:72:539:289:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:B:bare zero, however, we still obtain an upper bound on the bidder’s valuation.  Combining
15:460:35869:18:28:72:124:271:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this yields
15:461:35880:28:18:72:539:243:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:F:Lemma 2(Bidder–wise Inversion).Letb=β(x).  Thenx≤ξ(b)with equality on every

15:463:36005:34:18:72:539:191:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This result characterizes thebidder–wisecontent of data from an auction market.  Should
15:464:36092:18:18:72:540:173:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we observe a complete, strictly positive bid vector, it implies that we can exactly identify
15:465:36184:18:18:72:540:155:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the bidder’s type.  In the particular case whereJ= 1, the inverse bidding function takes the
15:466:36276:18:18:72:135:137:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:simple form:
15:467:36288:18:0:201:253:119:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:A:ξ(b) =b+

15:471:36320:25:16:85:539:94:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:6The diligent reader can derive this expression by stacking the Bellman equations from (1) in vector form
15:472:36425:16:0:72:382:78:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:and then substituting in the optimal bidding strategies from Lemma 1.
16:473:36496:0:24:72:540:671:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the discrete-time analogue to the inverse bidding function in Hendricks and Sorensen (2014).
16:474:36588:24:18:72:540:647:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Given this inversion result, it will be helpful from now on to refer to the bid-vectorb≡β(x)
16:475:36680:18:18:71:540:629:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as  typex’s  “pseudo–type”.   Let  the  distribution  of  pseudo–types  be ̃F.   It  will  suffice  to
16:476:36782:18:18:71:539:611:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:identify ̃Fto bound demandF. To see this, define a vector-valued indicator function 1(b>0)
16:477:36872:18:18:71:539:593:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with 1j(b>0) = 1 ifbj>0 and 1j(b>0) = 0 otherwise.  Then by Lemma 2,  we have
16:478:36949:18:33:71:474:575:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1(b)ξ(b)≤x≤ξ(b).  These pointwise inequalities translate into bounds onF:
16:479:37022:33:39:162:540:542:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f3:A:P({b:ξ(b)≤x})≤F(x)≤P({b: 1(b>0)ξ(b)≤x}).(6)
16:480:37065:39:18:71:539:503:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The missing part of our identification proof is a way of identifying the distribution of pseudo–
16:481:37161:18:18:71:539:485:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:types (and thus the probabilities on each side of the inequality in (6)).  With a single product,
16:482:37258:18:18:71:540:467:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this is a simple counting exercise: how many bidders are there who make each bidb(i.e. what
16:483:37349:18:18:71:540:449:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is the bid distributionG(b))?  With multiple products this counting exercise is complicated
16:484:37440:18:24:71:539:431:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by selection, because most bidders will exit before placing a bid on every available product.
16:485:37533:24:18:71:539:407:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We deal with sample selection by choosing subsets of the data for which selection can be
16:486:37621:18:18:71:539:389:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:explicitly modeled and accounted for.  There are many such subsets one could construct in
16:487:37710:18:18:71:539:371:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:order to prove identification.  For example, one possible subset is the set of all complete bid
16:488:37805:18:18:71:539:353:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:vectors.  The (joint) distribution of complete bids is observable, but selected:  pseudo–types
16:489:37899:18:18:71:540:335:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with highb1(e.g.)  will typically bid on product 1 and then win and exit, and therefore have
16:490:37991:18:24:71:371:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:low density in the selected sample of complete bid vectors.
16:491:38050:24:18:71:539:293:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:One problem with this conditioning set is that there are many paths a bidder can take to make
16:492:38143:18:18:71:539:275:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a complete bid vector, and so calculating the probability of this event requires enumerating
16:493:38235:18:18:71:539:257:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and computing the probability of many paths.  So instead we work with the set of bidders
16:494:38323:18:18:71:540:239:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:whose history falls into the following setH:  they enter when good 1 is available, bid, lose
16:495:38415:18:18:71:540:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  survive,  then  next  period  good  2  is  available,  and  the  bid,  lose  and  survive... Jis
16:496:38516:18:18:72:540:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:available, they bid, lose and survive.  Such bidders can be identified given the data available
16:497:38611:18:18:72:540:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:under Assumption 2.  Every pseudo–type who participates on every product is almost surely
16:498:38700:18:18:72:540:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:represented in this set, as every type on the interior of ̃Xcan lose an auction and survive to
16:499:38794:18:18:72:540:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bid on a different product.  We re-weight the observed frequency of pseudo–types observed
16:500:38883:18:18:72:540:131:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in this subset by the inverse probability of inclusion– a selection correction that will allow us
16:501:38980:18:19:72:540:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to learn about the distribution of pseudo–types and, from (6), the distribution of types.  To
16:502:39073:19:18:72:540:94:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:compute the weights, we need to identify the probabilitysH(b) that a pseudo–typebends
16:503:39158:18:0:72:437:76:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:up in the setH, which is relatively straightforward for our choice ofH:
17:504:39231:0:34:72:516:671:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:C:Lemma 3(Selection correction).Let Assumption 2 hold.  ThensH(b)is identified.
17:505:39308:34:18:72:540:637:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Let the joint density of their bids begH(b).  Lemma 3 allows us to re-weight the density
17:506:39396:18:33:72:344:619:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:B:gH(b) to get the density of pseudo–types withb>0:
17:507:39445:33:11:255:357:586:12:g_d0_f16:12:g_d0_f3:?: ̃f(b|b>0)∝gH(b)
17:508:39461:11:0:326:357:575:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:A:sH(b)
17:509:39466:0:42:525:540:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:(7)
17:510:39469:42:18:72:540:541:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:But  this  only  characterizes  bidders  withb>0.   Revisiting  our  example  in  Figure  1(b),
17:511:39564:18:18:72:540:523:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bidders of typesxandx′′are represented inH, but notx′, who never participates in auctions
17:512:39653:18:18:72:539:505:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f8:B:for  product  1.   Pseudo–types  that  don’t  participate  on  some  products  will  never  enterH
17:513:39751:18:18:72:540:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(i.e.sH(b)  =  0),  and  so  to  move  from  the  conditional  distribution  to  the  unconditional
17:514:39850:18:18:72:539:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f8:B:distribution  takes  a  little  more  work.   The  idea  is  to  define  less  restrictive  setsH′⊃H
17:515:39950:18:18:72:540:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(e.g.  sets of bidders who are observed bidding on product 1) and look for “extra mass” in
17:516:40040:18:18:72:540:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:those  sets  generated  by  these  non-participating  pseudo–types.   In  the  appendix,  we  make
17:517:40138:18:18:72:540:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this argument formal, applying induction on the cardinality of the set of products each type
17:518:40230:18:28:72:540:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:participates in, starting from types who bid on every product.  Combining these arguments:

17:521:40457:34:18:72:540:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This  result  combines  the  bidder–wise  inversion  of  Lemma  2  with  the  selection  correction
17:522:40556:18:18:72:540:299:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:result of Lemma 3.  The dynamics of the auction market are important in both steps:  in the
17:523:40647:18:18:72:540:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:first, the inverse bidding functionξ(·) captures bidders shading their bids by the option value
17:524:40742:18:18:72:540:263:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of losing and participating in future auctions;  in the second,sH(b) accounts for selection
17:525:40833:18:24:72:369:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:into our sample, which is inherently dynamic whenJ >1.
17:526:40887:24:18:72:540:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The  reason  that  Theorem  2  yields  partial  rather  than  complete  identification  is  that  we
17:527:40987:18:18:72:540:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:allow  for  bidder  non-participation.   If  bidders  were  required  to  participate  (e.g.   primary
17:528:41089:18:18:72:540:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dealers  in  US  Treasury  auctions),  then  identification  would  be  exact.   Moreover,  we  note
17:529:41189:18:18:72:540:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that identification of our model is only incomplete in the left tail of the type distribution,
17:530:41283:18:18:72:540:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:precisely because it is driven by non-participation.  Our identification result is exact in the
17:531:41378:18:18:72:540:131:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:right tail, which is typically the relevant region for computing policy-relevant statistics, e.g.
17:532:41475:18:24:72:217:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:welfare or expected revenue.
17:533:41503:24:18:72:540:89:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Finally, the proof and our exposition above hinged on a specially selected subset of bidders
17:534:41595:18:0:72:540:71:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with historyH.  We chose this subset for expositional clarity alone: though our identification
18:535:41691:0:18:72:540:671:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:argument is constructive, in practice we expect that the econometrician will be thoughtful
18:536:41781:18:18:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:about which subsets — and therefore which variation in the data — to exploit in light of
18:537:41869:18:18:72:539:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their particular application.7In the same spirit, since the choice ofHwas expositional, so
18:538:41959:18:52:72:485:617:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:too is Lemma 3.  One could construct a similar argument for alternative subsets.

18:540:42054:35:18:72:540:530:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In this we provide characterization and identification results for variations on the basic model.
18:541:42151:18:18:72:540:512:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We begin by showing that the model remains identified with data on only the winning and
18:542:42238:18:18:72:540:494:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:second  highest  bid  in  each  auction,  as  well  as  in  the  presence  of  reserve  prices.   We  also
18:543:42344:18:18:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:show,  parallel  to  the  the  demand  estimation  literature  for  fixed  price  markets,  that  the
18:544:42445:18:18:72:540:458:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model is amendable to projection onto product characteristics, as in the random coefficient
18:545:42536:18:18:72:540:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:utility models of Berry et al. (1995).  We then generalize the model to a setting in which
18:546:42626:18:19:72:540:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:there are additional state variables — beyond the product-type — that may affect bidder
18:547:42713:19:18:72:540:403:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:valuations and beliefs.  After characterizing bidding behavior in this case, we are also able to
18:548:42809:18:18:72:540:385:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:show that the model remains non-parametrically identified in cases with unobserved product
18:549:42899:18:18:72:540:367:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:heterogeneity and idiosyncratic payoff shocks.  Lastly, we consider a version of the model in
18:550:42992:18:18:72:540:349:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the presence of an unobserved, external fixed price market that agents may purchase from
18:551:43080:18:45:72:366:331:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:instead of buying at auction, generating endogenous exit.

18:553:43156:31:18:72:540:255:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In many real world applications, the data does not contain all bids and identities.  Or even
18:554:43248:18:18:72:540:237:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:if it does — as in our eBay application here — one may be concerned that not all bids are
18:555:43337:18:18:72:540:219:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:serious (in the sense that they are equal toβj(x)), and want to identify the model using data
18:556:43430:18:18:72:540:201:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:only on the winning and second highest bid. Haile and Tamer (2003) offer a behavioral model
18:557:43521:18:18:72:540:183:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of ascending price auctions to motivate this concern,  and a number of  papers have taken
18:558:43610:18:18:72:540:165:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:identification under this or similar data limitations seriously (Athey and Haile, 2002; Song,
18:559:43703:18:18:72:540:147:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2004; Menzel and Morganti, 2013; Platt, 2015) We consider the case where the econometrician
18:560:43794:18:18:72:507:129:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:observes the two highest order statistics and show that the model remains identified.
18:561:43879:18:16:85:539:111:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:7This argument anticipates the illustrative empirical application of Section 5, where we choose to use only
18:562:43986:16:12:72:540:95:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:data for bidders who are observed bidding multiple times.  See in particular the discussion of the empirical
18:563:44094:12:0:72:164:83:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:design in Section 5.2.
19:564:44118:0:18:72:540:671:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:F:Assumption 3(Limited Data).In each auction, the econometrician observes the product
19:565:44201:18:34:72:448:653:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:auctioned, the top two bids and the identities of the bidders placing them.
19:566:44276:34:18:72:539:619:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Lemma  2  still  applies,  so  identifying  ( ̃F,{G1j}j∈J,Q,r,τ)  is  sufficient  to  identifyξ(·)  and
19:567:44379:18:18:71:539:601:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:boundFaccording to (6).  The primitives{G1j}j∈JandQare still directly observable in the
19:568:44466:18:18:71:540:583:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:data.  But now the difficulties in identifyingrandτwe had earlier are exacerbated by the
19:569:44554:18:18:71:539:565:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fact that a bidder will have (unobserved) gaps in their history whenever they were active but
19:570:44647:18:18:71:539:547:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:did not place one of the top two bids.  Our data is thus censored.  But since the probability
19:571:44740:18:18:71:539:529:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of being censored depends on the distribution of the second highest bids, which is observed,
19:572:44832:18:24:71:476:511:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the parametersτandrremain point identified (see the Appendix for a proof).
19:573:44906:24:18:71:540:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Thus the remaining problem is identifying the distribution of pseudo-types ̃Ffrom the ob-
19:574:44995:18:18:71:539:469:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:served  bidding  data.   Once  again,  we  can  think  of  this  as  a  selection  problem.   Consider
19:575:45097:18:18:71:540:451:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the  subset  of  bidders  whose  history  falls  into  the  setH′(a  modified  version  ofH):  they
19:576:45196:18:18:71:539:433:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:enter  when  good  1  is  available,make  the  second  highest  bid  (and  are  thus  observed),  then
19:577:45298:18:18:71:540:415:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:next period good 2 is available, theymake the second highest bid. . . goodJis available and
19:578:45389:18:18:72:539:397:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:theymake the second highest bid.  Since the event “make the second highest bid bidding on
19:579:45478:18:19:72:540:379:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:productj” is measurable with the data promised by Assumption 3,  these bidders can be
19:580:45563:19:18:72:540:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:identified in the data.  And by similar arguments to those offered before, we can identify the
19:581:45657:18:28:72:433:342:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:probabilitysH′(b) that we need for selection correction.  This gives us:
19:582:45729:28:18:72:539:314:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:F:Theorem 3(Identification under Limited Data).Let  Assumption  3  hold.  ThenFis
19:583:45808:18:33:72:257:296:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:partially identified, according to (6).
19:584:45847:33:18:72:539:263:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:For further intuition on this result, recall the discussion of our selection of the historyHat
19:585:45941:18:18:71:539:245:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the end of Section 3.  There are a number of possible histories on which we could have built
19:586:46033:18:19:71:539:227:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:our identification result —Hwas an expository choice, butH′is also feasible.  As long as
19:587:46121:19:18:71:539:208:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the process by which bidders are selected into the sample can be recovered from observables,
19:588:46213:18:44:71:516:190:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:our identification result is robust subject to the emendation of the selection correction.
19:589:46303:44:32:71:254:146:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:4.2    Random Coefficients
19:590:46329:32:18:71:539:114:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Let us suppose that the products have fixed (non-time-varying) characteristics, observable
19:591:46419:18:18:71:539:96:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to the econometrician.  These are summarized in aJ×KmatrixZ, where the number of
19:592:46499:18:0:71:539:78:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:characteristicsKis less than the number of productsJ.  We make two assumptions onZ:
20:593:46584:0:18:72:540:671:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that it is of full rank (this is necessary for identification), and that all entries are positive
20:594:46681:18:24:72:519:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(this is unnecessary but simplifies the analysis by allowing the inequality in (8) below).
20:595:46771:24:18:72:540:629:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Let bidderihave valuations of the formxi=Zαi, so that their preferences are summarized
20:596:46857:18:18:71:540:611:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by a random coefficientαi(aK×1 column vector).  Instead of sampling valuationsxupon
20:597:46940:18:18:72:540:593:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:entry fromF, we assume that bidders sample their random coefficientαfromFαinstead.
20:598:47022:18:24:72:306:575:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We would like to identify the distributionFα.
20:599:47067:24:18:72:540:551:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This demand structure is a special case of the model in which valuationsxcome from some
20:600:47154:18:18:72:539:533:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:higher-dimensional distributionF, and as a result optimal bidding and the inversion result
20:601:47244:18:33:72:519:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in Lemma 2 remain unchanged.  We can boundFαusing the more general result in (6):
20:602:47325:33:33:149:540:482:12:g_d0_f12:12:g_d0_f3:A:P({b:ξ(b)≤Zα})≤Fα(α)≤P({b: 1(b>0)ξ(b)≤Zα})(8)
20:603:47370:33:18:72:539:449:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:where we have simply replacedxin (6) byZα.  Intuitively, the probability that a random
20:604:47456:18:18:72:540:431:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:coefficient is lower than some levelαis the same as the probability that the valuations are
20:605:47547:18:28:72:469:413:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:lower than the corresponding levelZα, and can be bounded in the same way.
20:606:47620:28:18:72:539:385:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:F:Corollary 1(Identification under random coefficients).Suppose Assumption 3 holds.
20:607:47701:18:34:72:319:367:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:ThenFαis partially identified, according to (8).
20:608:47749:34:18:72:540:333:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Though the result is straightforward,  it highlights the generality of the type space of our
20:609:47841:18:18:72:540:315:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model from Section 2.  As in demand systems for fixed-price markets,  projection down to
20:610:47929:18:18:72:540:297:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:preferences over characteristic space yields dimension reduction.  Since we can partially iden-
20:611:48024:18:18:72:540:279:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tify a high-dimensional model with random preferences over products, we can also partially
20:612:48114:18:45:72:485:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:identify a lower-dimensional model of random preferences for characteristics too.

20:614:48228:31:18:72:540:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We now analyze a more substantial variation of the basic model in which we allow for both
20:615:48317:18:18:72:540:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:public  and  private  signals  that  affect  both  beliefs  and  valuations.   This  framework  is  the
20:616:48420:18:19:72:540:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:basis for two extensions:  public signals that affect beliefs about the state of the market and
20:617:48515:19:23:72:316:130:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unobserved heterogeneity in product attributes.
20:618:48562:23:18:72:540:107:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:To accommodate this,  we need a richer state space.  Assume that in each period,  a state
20:619:48651:18:18:72:540:89:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variables∈ Sis publicly observed.  This state variable may affect bidder valuations, so we
20:620:48741:18:0:72:540:71:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model a bidder’s valuation as a random functionxi(s).  Exactly howxi(s) is sampled will
21:621:48830:0:18:72:540:671:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:depend on the specifics of the model.  For example, in the original model, the state variable
21:622:48923:18:18:72:539:653:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f10:B:was the product-type under auction (i.e.s∈ J), so valuations werexi(j)≡xi,jwherexi,j
21:623:49007:18:18:71:540:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:was thejth element ofxi, andxiwas sampled iid across biddersifromF.  The state variable
21:624:49094:18:28:71:513:617:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:may also affect beliefs about competing bids, so we modify Assumption 1 accordingly:
21:625:49178:28:18:71:540:589:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f4:F:Assumption 4(Beliefs with Public States).When the public state iss, bidders believe
21:626:49261:18:33:71:439:571:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f4:C:that the highest rival bid in the current auction has distributionG1(·|s).
21:627:49335:33:18:71:539:538:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:For example, bidders may believe that when there is a lot of supply of a given good on the
21:628:49425:18:18:71:539:520:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:market, the highest competing bid will be lower.  Assume also that bidders believe the state
21:629:49517:18:18:71:539:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:transitions according to an exogenous Markov transition kernelP(s′|s) (exogenous in that
21:630:49605:18:27:71:347:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:it is unaffected by the actions in the current auction).

21:635:49885:33:18:71:539:345:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Then by the same logic that we offered for Lemma 1, it is optimal for bidders to bid their

22:654:50814:18:18:72:539:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:countably sophisticated information into the public state spaceS, including histories, chang-
22:655:50907:18:24:72:219:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ing primitives, and foresight.
22:656:50937:24:18:72:540:611:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:For instance,  suppose that bidders know not only what is being auctioned today,  but the
22:657:51026:18:18:72:539:593:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sequence  of  products  that  are  being  auctionedk−1  periods  into  the  future.   Then,S=
22:658:51119:18:18:72:540:575:12:g_d0_f9:12:g_d0_f3:B:Jk,  and  bidders’  continuation  values  will  now  depend  upon  realizations  of  future  supply.
22:659:51219:18:18:72:540:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Alternatively, suppose thatτ, the re-arrival rate of bidders, evolves over{τL,τH}in a public
22:660:51311:18:18:72:539:539:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and Markov process.  Now,S=J×{τL,τH}.  In theτHworld bidders face more competition
22:661:51393:18:24:71:436:521:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:from more bidders, and so it is useful to let this be reflected inG1(·|s).
22:662:51467:24:18:71:539:497:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:It is straightforward to see that this presents no theoretical difficulty for identification.  The
22:663:51565:18:18:71:539:479:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:simplest approach is by brute force application of Theorem 2:  simply define ̃Jto contain

22:665:51741:18:18:71:540:443:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:using a contraction mapping argument, that the fullJ×|S|bid vector is identified from any

22:671:52225:18:33:72:348:299:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:private and transient.  We assume that valuations are:
22:672:52279:33:33:235:540:266:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:A:xi(j,ξt,εi,t) =xi,j+ξt+εi,t(11)

23:686:53489:18:41:72:327:611:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that the distribution of pseudo-types is identified.

23:698:53977:15:18:72:540:420:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We use the check notation to distinguish the pseudo-types from the bids.  The pseudo-type
23:699:54066:18:18:72:540:402:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:is the permanent part of the bid vector; positive bids can be written as pseudo-type plus the
23:700:54159:18:18:72:540:384:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:two transitory shocks.  In contrast to bids, pseudo-types can be negative.  We can then write
23:701:54252:18:18:72:131:366:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the bids as:

23:717:54788:37:18:72:540:146:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:As in the basic model, each pseudo-type can be mapped back to an underlying type.  But
23:718:54874:18:18:72:540:128:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:there are a number of important differences between this result and the earlier one.  First,
23:719:54966:18:19:72:540:110:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:since pseudo-types can now be negative, this mapping is exact (rather than holding only for
23:720:55057:19:15:85:539:91:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:9Sinceεi,tis private rather than public information, strictly speaking this is not implied by Lemma 4.
23:721:55159:15:0:72:530:76:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:But sinceεi,tonly affects the bidder’s current valuation and nothing else, adding it to the bid is optimal.
24:722:55268:0:18:72:540:671:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:strictly positive pseudo-types, as in the basic model).  Second, the expected utility from the
24:723:55362:18:18:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:optimal  bid  in  any  period  now  includes  the  idiosyncratic  shock,  both  in  the  continuation
24:724:55463:18:18:72:540:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:value  and  in  adjusting  the  bids.   The  unobserved  heterogeneity  does  not  enter  expected
24:725:55561:18:19:72:540:617:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:utility, as it shifts all bids in an auction up byξt, and thus the extra valuation ofξtis exactly
24:726:55658:19:18:72:539:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:canceled out by an additional payment ofξtconditional on winning.  Finally, this inversion
24:727:55748:18:18:72:540:580:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cannot be applied bidder-wise to bid vectors, since bid vectors are not pseudo-types (they
24:728:55838:18:18:72:540:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:now include unobserved heterogeneity and idiosyncratic shocks).  Instead, we will apply the
24:729:55929:18:23:72:381:544:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:inversionξ(·) to the distribution of pseudo-types as a whole.
24:730:55990:23:19:72:539:521:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:But  first  we  need  to  identify  bothFεand{ˇG1j}j∈J,  as  these  are  required  by  Lemma  5.
24:731:56086:19:18:72:540:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Identifying these objects will require making some deconvolution arguments (Li and Vuong,
24:732:56175:18:18:72:540:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:1998;  Krasnokutskaya,  2011).   Let  us  start  with  identifying{ˇG1j}j∈J.   Take  pairs  of  bids
24:733:56275:18:18:72:540:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:placed in the same auction,  by bidders that have just entered the data.  The pair can be
24:734:56364:18:18:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:written as a common partξtplus a vector of independent shocks (sums of the pseudo-type
24:735:56450:18:18:72:540:430:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the idiosyncratic shocks).  Since all the terms are mutually independent, andE[ξ] = 0,
24:736:56540:18:18:72:539:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:by Kotlarski’s lemma, the distributionFξis identified (Kotlarski, 1967).  Then, since each

24:738:56715:18:24:72:289:376:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:again apply deconvolution to get{ˇG1j}j∈J.
24:739:56757:24:18:72:539:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Next consider identification ofFε.  Take a very specific sample:  the pair of bids of bidders

24:743:56984:29:18:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with the following statistical structure:  all the distinct variables are mutually independent;

24:747:57337:24:18:72:539:175:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This can be written in the formY1=M+U1andY2=M+U2forM=ˇbi,1,U1=ξt1+εi,t1,

24:750:57575:18:18:72:539:121:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(2012)).   This  is  itself  a  convolution  of  the  identifiedFξand  the  unknownFε,  and  so  by
24:751:57674:18:0:72:303:103:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:applying deconvolution again, we identifyFε.

25:782:59411:18:28:72:384:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:deconvolution suffices to identify ̃Fseparately.  Summarizing:

25:788:59855:18:18:72:540:138:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the data set is very large indeed.  In our application, where we use a similar demand system,
25:789:59948:18:0:72:398:120:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we impose a number of parametric assumptions to be practical.
26:790:60011:0:32:72:212:671:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:4.4    Reserve Prices
26:791:60032:32:18:72:540:639:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In  many  markets,  sellers  set  reserve  prices  on  their  items.   They  do  this  to  avoid  selling
26:792:60137:18:18:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:them at a price below their best outside use (either retained by the seller, sold in a different
26:793:60233:18:18:72:540:603:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:market,  or  sold  in  this  market  at  a  later  date),  and  to  extract  more  money  from  buyers.
26:794:60336:18:18:72:540:585:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Sellers may set reserves non-strategically (e.g.  at cost, or the $1 starting bid recommended
26:795:60429:18:18:72:540:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for many products on eBay), or to maximize expected revenue.  They will generally know
26:796:60515:18:18:72:540:549:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:everything commonly known by the bidders, which may include characteristics latent to the
26:797:60604:18:18:72:540:531:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:econometrician.10Reserves  are  sometimes  implemented  as  minimum  bids,  which  restrict
26:798:60695:18:18:71:539:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:participations to types with sufficiently high values (e.g.  on eBay).  In other settings (e.g.
26:799:60790:18:18:71:539:495:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:online advertising), the reserve may only be applied after the bids have been recorded (“secret
26:800:60885:18:24:71:346:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:reserves”), in order to adjust allocation and payment.
26:801:60939:24:18:71:539:453:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Reserve prices can be easily accounted for in the model.  Suppose that sellers charge reserve
26:802:61032:18:18:71:539:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:prices on each item sold, drawn iid from distributions{GRj}. We assume that buyers know the
26:803:61123:18:18:72:539:417:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:distributions of reserve prices.  Re-defineG1jas the conditional distribution of the maximum
26:804:61215:18:18:71:540:399:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  the  highest  competing  bid  and  the  reserve  price  on  productj,  and  let  assumption  1
26:805:61313:18:18:72:540:381:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:hold as before.  Bids are equal to valuation less continuation value, where the continuation
26:806:61405:18:18:72:540:363:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:value is dependent on the distribution of reserve prices.  High reserve prices directly depress
26:807:61500:18:18:72:540:345:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:continuation values by lowering the likelihood that a bidder is successful in future auctions.
26:808:61594:18:24:72:455:327:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:They also mean fewer bidders exiting the market, toughening competition.
26:809:61666:24:18:72:540:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f9:B:For identification, the functionξ(·) still offers a valid inversion, though the distributions{G1j}
26:810:61764:18:15:72:540:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are now amended to reflect the reserves.  So if we can identify the pseudo-type distribution
26:811:61856:15:27:72:507:270:12:g_d0_f16:12:g_d0_f3:B: ̃F, we can boundF.  With secret reserves, we can pointwise identify ̃Fjust as before.
26:812:61942:27:18:72:540:243:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:On the other hand, with minimum bids, we again face a selection problem:  only bids that
26:813:62030:18:18:72:540:225:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:clear  the  minimum  bid  will  be  observed.   So  in  the  selection  correction  step,  we  need  to
26:814:62133:18:18:72:540:207:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:take into account the reserves in calculatingsH(b).  Moreover — in contrast to all the prior
26:815:62225:18:18:72:540:189:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:analysis — some types might never be observed.11For example, suppose there is only one
26:816:62311:18:18:72:540:171:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:product, and it always gets a $100 reserve.  Then types with values below $100 will never
26:817:62400:18:18:72:540:153:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bid.  The mass of such types cannot be inferred from the data.  This implies that we can only
26:818:62493:18:16:81:540:135:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:10For example, Roberts (2013) explores a model in which an unobserved heterogeneity termξis observed
26:819:62593:16:12:72:540:119:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:by sellers and used to set reserve prices.  He shows that the reserve prices can then be used as controls in
26:820:62701:12:8:72:158:107:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:estimating demand.
26:821:62719:8:16:81:539:99:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:11In the baseline model, every type bids on at least one product with positive probability.  This remains
26:822:62824:16:11:72:540:83:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:true in the limited data case,  since there is always some chance of being one of the top two bidders (e.g.
26:823:62931:11:0:72:274:72:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:when no other bidders are active that period).
27:824:62979:0:18:72:539:671:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:identify ̃Ffor the subset of types who bid on at least one product with positive probability.
27:825:63072:18:18:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:And  even  conditioning  on  types  that  bid  with  positive  probability,  we  can  only  partially
27:826:63173:18:18:72:540:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:identify ̃F.  This translates into weaker bounds onF, though the right tail of valuations will
27:827:63267:18:45:72:489:617:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:still be well-identified, and this is often what is needed for policy counterfactuals.
27:828:63353:45:32:72:224:572:14:g_d0_f2:14:g_d0_f2:C:4.5    Outside Options
27:829:63375:32:18:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We conclude our extensions with a variation of the model in which there are latent outside
27:830:63465:18:18:72:539:522:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f4:B:options. We introduce outside options by describing a more general environment withpassive
27:831:63555:18:18:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:B:search.  In each periodt, both new entrants and active incumbents are presented with either
27:832:63646:18:18:72:539:486:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an auction of one of the goods inJ(as in the basic model), or an opportunity to buy one of
27:833:63736:18:18:72:539:468:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the goods inJat a fixed price in another market (observed by the bidder, unobserved to the
27:834:63826:18:18:72:540:450:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:econometrician).  Beliefs about opposing bids in the auction market follow Assumption 1,
27:835:63914:18:18:72:540:432:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and  are  captured  by  the  distributionsGAj(we  switch  superscript  to  indicate  “auction”).
27:836:64010:18:18:71:539:414:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Prices in the outside market are stochastic, sampled independently and identically over time
27:837:64102:18:18:71:539:396:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:according to product-specific continuous distributionsGOj(where the “O” stands for outside)
27:838:64193:18:18:72:540:378:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:with strictly positive density over their support.  We make a support inclusion assumption:
27:839:64284:18:18:72:539:360:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:supp(GOj)⊆supp(GAj), so that the highest bid in the auction market would always suffice
27:840:64371:18:18:72:540:342:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to buy the corresponding good in the fixed price market.  This assumption seems weak given
27:841:64461:18:18:72:540:324:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:our intuitions about the size of price fluctuations in auction versus fixed price markets.  We
27:842:64555:18:24:72:272:306:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:make use of it in our arguments below.
27:843:64593:24:18:72:540:282:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Search in this environment is “passive” in the sense that active bidders do not actively choose
27:844:64688:18:18:72:540:264:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which product to bid on,  nor whether to go to the fixed price or auction market.  This is
27:845:64778:18:18:72:540:246:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:consistent  with  our  initial  model.12But  bidders  are  sophisticated  and  take  into  account

28:883:66326:48:18:71:539:420:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Here we take advantage of the iid multinomial state transitions to work instead with an “ex-
28:884:66418:18:18:71:540:402:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ante” Bellman equation, wherev(x) is the value of an active bidder prior to the realization of

28:886:66608:18:18:71:539:366:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:continuation value (if positive), where that continuation value is a scalar function of type.
28:887:66701:18:18:71:539:348:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:An immediate implication of (12) is that the buyer’s bid in the auction market and their

28:890:66981:18:41:71:452:294:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:markets.  This insight will help in the identification argument that follows.

28:894:67337:18:18:71:539:199:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:arguments  are  based  on  an  analysis  of  how  exit  rates  vary  across  pseudo-types,  which  is

30:997:70974:51:35:71:286:312:17:g_d0_f2:17:g_d0_f2:C:5    Empirical Application
30:998:71000:35:18:71:539:277:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We  present  an  application  of  our  identification  result  to  the  auction  market  for  compact
30:999:71101:18:19:71:539:259:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cameras on eBay.com.  We selected this market as an illustration for several reasons.  First,
30:1000:71194:19:18:71:539:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as noted earlier, the eBay auction design is strategically similar to a sequence of second-price
30:1001:71290:18:18:71:539:222:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sealed bid auctions.  Second, most consumers only purchase a single camera, so the unit de-
30:1002:71381:18:18:71:539:204:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:mand assumption seems reasonable.  Third, compact cameras are measurably differentiated
30:1003:71468:18:18:71:539:186:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in a salient characteristic — namely resolution — which consumers may value differently,
30:1004:71556:18:18:71:539:168:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:affording us an opportunity to highlight a random coefficients variation of our model.  The
30:1005:71647:18:18:71:539:150:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:demand  model  we  estimate  allows  for  random  consumer  preferences  for  resolution  in  the
30:1006:71744:18:18:71:539:132:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:spirit  of  Berry  et  al.  (1995),  but  in  the  “pure  characteristics”  setting  of  Berry  and  Pakes
30:1007:71850:18:18:71:539:114:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(2007).  We estimate the parameters of this model using a maximum likelihood approach
30:1008:71935:18:0:71:527:96:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and use those estimates to characterize consumer surplus and optimal bidding strategies.

31:1010:72056:32:18:72:540:639:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:B:The  eBay  Marketplace.eBay  is  widely  considered  to  be  the  world  leader  in  online
31:1011:72147:18:18:72:540:621:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:auctions.  Various elements of its platform design, such as the use of proxy bidding agents,
31:1012:72239:18:18:72:540:603:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:feedback scores and “buy-it-now” offers have been widely copied.  At any time, eBay hosts a
31:1013:72330:18:18:72:540:585:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:large number of object listings from a variety of sellers.  Buyers can browse these, either by
31:1014:72424:18:18:72:540:567:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:navigating through categories delineated by the site, or by directly searching for key phrases.
31:1015:72519:18:18:72:540:549:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:For  example,  a  search  for  “digital  compact  camera”  will  typically  bring  up  thousands  of
31:1016:72619:18:18:72:540:531:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:listings.  Some of these are offered at “buy-it-now,” i.e.  fixed, prices.  As Einav et al. (2016)
31:1017:72717:18:18:72:540:513:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have documented, over 60% of listings on eBay are now at fixed prices (though auctions were
31:1018:72808:18:18:72:540:495:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:more common at the time our data was collected).  We will ignore the presence of a fixed
31:1019:72896:18:18:72:540:477:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price market in what follows, effectively ignoring substitution opportunities between the two
31:1020:72989:18:24:72:437:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:markets in favor of focusing on substitution within the auction market.
31:1021:73060:24:18:72:540:435:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Restricting  to  auctions  yields  a  list  of  items,  ordered  by  time  until  auction  end.   These
31:1022:73163:18:18:72:540:417:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:auctions all end at different times, so bidders face a set ofsequentialauctions. Unsurprisingly,
31:1023:73259:18:18:72:540:399:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:there is substantial heterogeneity in the cameras offered, in terms of brand, resolution, zoom
31:1024:73353:18:18:72:540:381:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and accessories (to name some of the most salient features).  Bidders can research past prices
31:1025:73447:18:24:72:350:363:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for different items by searching the completed listings.
31:1026:73503:24:18:72:540:339:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Bids  are  placed  through  eBay’s  proprietary  “proxy  bidding”  system.   Bidders  enter  the
31:1027:73599:18:18:72:540:321:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:maximum they are willing to pay for the item, and then eBay’s proxy bidding system will
31:1028:73686:18:18:72:540:303:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bid  up  from  the  current  standing  price  in  standardized  increments  on  their  behalf  until
31:1029:73786:18:18:72:540:285:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:either their bid is the highest yet entered in the system, or an additional increment would
31:1030:73877:18:18:72:540:267:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:take them over their maximum.  For example, if bidder A enters a bid of $8000 on a camera
31:1031:73966:18:18:72:540:249:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:where  the  standing  price  is  $6000  and  the  highest  bid  placed  in  the  system  by  a  rival  is
31:1032:74071:18:18:72:540:231:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:$7000, then the system will update the standing price to $7100 ($7000 + $100 increment),
31:1033:74159:18:18:72:540:213:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and will record this bidder as the currently high bidder.  Under unit demand high bidders
31:1034:74248:18:19:72:540:195:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:become  “committed”  to  the  auctions  they  enter,  in  the  sense  that  if  they  bid  in  another
31:1035:74350:19:23:72:415:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:auction, there is a risk of winning a second object they don’t need.
31:1036:74418:23:18:72:540:153:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Fear of premature commitment is perhaps one reason why bidders tend to bid late in auctions.
31:1037:74510:18:18:72:540:135:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:For example, on eBay Motors, 75% of bids are placed in the last day of the auction (Lewis,
31:1038:74600:18:18:72:540:117:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:2007).  Similar results have been found elsewhere on eBay and in other auction markets, and
31:1039:74691:18:18:72:540:99:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a wide range of alternative explanations for late bidding have been offered (see e.g.  Roth and
31:1040:74786:18:0:72:540:81:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Ockenfels (2002)).  The combination of late and proxy bidding suggest that eBay’s auction
32:1041:74877:0:18:72:540:671:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:market is well approximated as a sequence of second-price sealed bid auctions, so that our
32:1042:74967:18:41:72:260:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:model can be applied to this setting.
32:1043:75004:41:18:72:540:612:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:B:Data.We purchased a dataset concerning all sales of digital compact cameras over a 2-year
32:1044:75093:18:18:72:540:594:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:period from TeraPeak, a data analytics company The data includes attributes of the camera
32:1045:75182:18:18:72:540:576:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:auctioned (resolution, zoom, brand, product name, bundling of a tripod, extra battery etc),
32:1046:75273:18:18:72:540:558:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:attributes of the listing (starting price, secret reserve, listing title), and the outcome of the
32:1047:75370:18:18:72:540:540:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:auction. Each listing may be associated with several bids, all of which we observe — including
32:1048:75464:18:18:72:540:522:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the highest bid, which is not visible on the website and typically unavailable in “scraped”
32:1049:75555:18:18:72:540:504:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:auction datasets from the platform.  Market participants are persistent in our dataset — as
32:1050:75646:18:18:72:540:486:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in our model — and we observe their attributes (feedback, location) and construct measures
32:1051:75736:18:24:72:331:468:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of experience and activity from observed behavior.
32:1052:75786:24:18:72:539:444:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We  work  with  a  subset  of  the  data,  consisting  only  ofnewcompact  cameras,  sold  in  the
32:1053:75884:18:18:72:540:426:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:3-month period between February 5th and May 6th of 2007.  We restrict attention to new
32:1054:75970:18:18:72:540:408:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cameras to limit the influence of unobserved heterogeneity, though as we will see, this is still
32:1055:76066:18:18:72:540:390:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a substantial problem.  We analyze this particular time period because supply was relatively
32:1056:76158:18:18:72:540:372:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:stable over those 3 months, so the stationarity assumptions implicit in our calculations of
32:1057:76249:18:18:72:540:354:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the continuation values are reasonable.  We pick cameras with the most common resolution
32:1058:76337:18:18:72:540:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:levels:  those with (rounded) resolution between 5 megapixels and 10 megapixels (MP). We
32:1059:76425:18:18:72:540:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:clean the data by excluding auctions with missing data, potential shill bidding, outlying bids
32:1060:76519:18:19:72:540:300:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and auctions that are terminated by the first bidder exercising a buy-it-now option (this is
32:1061:76611:19:23:72:459:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:unusual).  See the data appendix for further details on sample construction.
32:1062:76687:23:18:72:540:258:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:This  leaves  us  with  a  dataset  of  19160  auctions,  4387  sellers  and  74375  unique  bidders.
32:1063:76788:18:18:72:540:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Summary statistics are presented in Table 1.  In the top panel, we summarize the data at an
32:1064:76879:18:18:72:540:222:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:auction level (i.e.  an observation is an auction).  The average gap between the winning bid
32:1065:76971:18:18:72:540:204:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:and the closing price is $10.60.  This is a direct estimate of the average consumer surplus
32:1066:77062:18:19:72:540:186:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of  winning  bidders  in  a  static  auction  model,  but  we  will  show  that  it  is  a  substantial
32:1067:77165:19:18:72:540:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:underestimate once continuation value is taken into account.  The probability of sale is quite
32:1068:77259:18:18:72:540:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:high, at 0.95.  Those products that do not sell tend to be among the small handful which
32:1069:77347:18:18:72:540:131:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:employ “secret reserve prices”, whereby the item only sells if the highest bid meets a reserve
32:1070:77441:18:18:72:540:113:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:price set by the seller but hidden from bidders.  On average an auction attracts 7 – 8 unique
32:1071:77534:18:23:72:394:95:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bidders, and 16 – 17 bids, though there is substantial variance.
32:1072:77598:23:0:72:540:72:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Table 1 also summarizes the data at the seller and bidder level.  There are just over four
33:1073:77690:0:18:72:540:671:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:listings for every seller in our marketplace.  The distribution of seller shares is skewed, with
33:1074:77786:18:18:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:large, experienced sellers making up the bulk of listings.  However there are many such large
33:1075:77879:18:18:72:539:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:sellers and the seller concentration measure (HHI) remains low at 0.04.  On the bidders’ side
33:1076:77972:18:19:72:540:617:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we find some motivation for the assumptions of our model Most bidders are unsuccessful in
33:1077:78061:19:18:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:acquiring an item (the purchase rate is 24.3%), but they are active in the market for nearly a
33:1078:78155:18:18:72:540:580:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:week and on average are observed bidding in two different auctions, with some participating
33:1079:78246:18:18:72:539:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in many more than that.13This repeated participation is not driven by multi-unit demand—
33:1080:78334:18:45:72:409:544:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:99% of our bidders make one or fewer compact camera purchases.

33:1084:78581:40:19:72:539:410:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:B:Do bidders substitute across products?If bidders generally bid on the same products
33:1085:78664:19:18:72:540:391:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:repeatedly (or have identical preferences over product characteristics), one might think that
33:1086:78757:18:18:72:540:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the single-good models familiar from the existing empirical auctions literature may suffice.
33:1087:78849:18:18:72:540:355:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:So to get some evidence on this, we look for evidence of substitution across products.  There
33:1088:78942:18:18:72:540:337:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:are many distinct products sold in our dataset, but in the demand system below we allow
33:1089:79029:18:18:72:540:319:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:random coefficients over camera resolution, and so this is the relevant definition of a product
33:1090:79124:18:18:72:540:301:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for the purposes of our analysis.  We therefore calculate a transition matrix across cameras of
33:1091:79219:18:18:72:540:283:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:different resolution, shown in Table 2.  Each entry in the matrix is the probability (expressed
33:1092:79314:18:18:72:540:265:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:as a percentage) that a bidder who bids on a camera of the resolution in a given row subse-
33:1093:79405:18:18:72:540:247:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quently bids on a camera with the column resolution.  We find that most buyers that bid on
33:1094:79495:18:18:72:540:229:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:multiple cameras tend to bid on a product with the same resolution next, but the probability
33:1095:79587:18:18:72:540:211:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of this is far away from 100%, ranging from 45.5% to 80.5%.  When they substitute, they
33:1096:79674:18:18:72:540:193:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:tend to pick a product of similar resolution (the biggest off-diagonal elements are generally
33:1097:79767:18:41:72:185:175:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:close to the diagonal).
33:1098:79790:41:18:72:540:134:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:B:Do bidders have option value?Another focus of our approach has been to emphasize
33:1099:79870:18:18:72:540:116:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dynamic bidding and option values.  Option values arise from price fluctuations — a bid that
33:1100:79962:18:18:72:540:98:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:loses today may win tomorrow.  Many economists have the intuition that in large markets
33:1101:80049:18:0:81:539:80:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:13We say a bidder is “active” from the start of the first auction they bid in to the end of the last auction.

35:1151:82303:18:18:72:540:476:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:here.  The top left panel of Figure 2 shows the median daily transaction prices (including

35:1153:82497:18:18:72:540:440:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:variability — an typical change is 10% — and since it is a median price, this is not driven
35:1154:82588:18:24:72:172:422:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:entirely by outliers.
35:1155:82609:24:18:72:540:398:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:To rule out variation based on compositional effects, we drilled down to look at the highest
35:1156:82701:18:18:72:540:380:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:volume seller’s most popular product (a Kodak Easyshare Z710), and plotted the price series
35:1157:82792:18:18:72:540:362:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:against time (fluctuations could be within a day), shown in the top right panel of Figure 2.
35:1158:82884:18:18:72:540:344:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Prices vary from below $200 to over $250 dollars.  Doing some rough back of the envelope

35:1161:83159:18:18:72:540:290:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:their bid down to $238 (green dashed line), because of the option value (and should expect
35:1162:83249:18:19:72:540:272:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to  pay  closer  to  $225,  yellow  dashed  line).   Indeed  this  option  value  should  be  present  in
35:1163:83354:19:18:72:540:253:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:many online markets:  Einav et al. (2011) have found the standard deviation in price to be
35:1164:83444:18:23:72:426:235:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:on the order of 10% of the transaction price in most eBay categories.
35:1165:83513:23:18:72:540:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We also observe that the average time between bids is just over four days, with many auctions
35:1166:83606:18:18:72:540:194:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:closing in the meantime.  This suggests that bidders are inattentive (i.e.τclose to zero).  In
35:1167:83700:18:19:72:540:176:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:view of this, Assumption 1 seems quite reasonable:  information from the current auction is

36:1186:84931:18:18:72:540:381:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:exercise.  We take bids that have been “normalized” to account for observable heterogeneity
36:1187:85022:18:18:72:540:363:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(we explain this process below), and look at bidders who have bid exactly twice on cameras

38:1235:88487:18:18:72:540:381:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:first step in working with the bids is to normalize out the contribution of observables for
38:1236:88578:18:18:72:540:363:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:which bidders have common preferences (Haile et al., 2006).  Applying our earlier theory to
38:1237:88669:18:34:72:377:345:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the valuations in (14), the bidding equation takes the form:

38:1239:88786:33:18:72:540:278:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:i.e.  valuation less continuation value.  Restricting attention to positive bids, and adding and
38:1240:88882:18:18:72:539:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:subtractingψj≡EFα[αi,c+ resjαi,r−v(αi,c,αi,r)], we get an estimating equation in reduced
38:1241:88970:18:18:72:99:242:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:form:

38:1243:88997:26:18:72:539:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:where the error termei,j,tcombines an individual-specific deviation in bid from that of the
38:1244:89088:18:18:72:540:180:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:average type and the common unobserved heterogeneity.  Since these are both independent
38:1245:89175:18:19:72:451:162:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:ofZj,t), we can estimateγconsistently by OLS with product fixed effects.
38:1246:89247:19:15:81:539:143:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:14We maintain the assumption of exogenous exit on the part of bidders, though it could be weakened using
38:1247:89351:15:12:72:540:128:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:the methods of Section 4.5.  While the assumption might seem somewhat unrealistic, we found no evidence
38:1248:89454:12:12:72:540:116:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:in reduced–form regressions of a systematic correlation between exit of losing bidders and the level of their
38:1249:89563:12:12:72:540:104:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:bid.  In the end, we chose to highlight the extensions that were most necessary to fit the basic features of
38:1250:89671:12:0:72:183:92:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:the data discussed above.
39:1251:89698:0:18:72:540:671:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We only run this regression on a subsample of our data, consisting of the two highest bids
39:1252:89788:18:18:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in every auction.  This is motivated by the behavioral intuition of Haile and Tamer (2003).
39:1253:89879:18:18:72:540:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Because eBay’s proxy bidding system is formally an ascending auction, the bid of the third,
39:1254:89970:18:19:72:539:617:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:fourth,  orn-th  highest  bidder  may  not  reflect  their  intended  final  bid  (what  they  would
39:1255:90070:19:18:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have bid in a sealed-bid auction i.e.  valuation less continuation value).  It is common for
39:1256:90162:18:18:72:540:580:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bidders to “test out” a sequence of ascending bids to see if they can become the standing
39:1257:90251:18:18:72:540:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:high bidder, but if in this process the price comes to exceed their intended final bid then it
39:1258:90345:18:18:72:540:544:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:will be censored from the dataset.  For this reason we restrict attention to the two highest
39:1259:90437:18:24:72:363:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bids in each auction, who are never censored in this way.

39:1265:90978:18:18:71:539:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:costs,  and particularly high for listings with free shipping,  consistent with the findings of

39:1270:91379:18:18:72:539:316:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:These should differ only byξj,t1−ξj,t2, and since these random variables are independent of
39:1271:91470:18:18:72:539:298:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:each other, we can estimate the variance ofξj,tasσ2ξ,j=V ar(bi,j,t−bi,j,t′)/2 where the RHS

39:1276:91908:18:19:72:540:186:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:So we need to estimate{ˇG1j}.  Also, for the reasons outlined above, we only want to use the

39:1278:92091:18:23:72:539:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:will require correcting for selection into the top two bids.  So we also need to estimate{ˇG2j}.

40:1304:93684:24:18:71:539:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We summarize the results of all these preliminary estimation steps in Table 4.  We find that

40:1311:94322:18:24:71:539:140:12:g_d0_f3:8:g_d0_f5:B:shade their bids substantially.  This shading will bias static estimates of consumer surplus.16

42:1387:97193:18:18:71:539:128:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:highest bids in auctions, and therefore plausibly equal to valuation less continuation value.
42:1388:97286:18:15:81:540:110:7:g_d0_f6:10:g_d0_f7:F:17This relies on an assumption thatτis sufficiently small that each time a bidder participates, sufficient

42:1391:97607:12:0:71:462:71:10:g_d0_f7:10:g_d0_f7:F:correction argument — but as we argued when discussing Table 1,τappears to be small.

43:1395:97962:18:19:72:540:617:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:suffices for identification).  But there are less than 300 such bidders in our dataset, and this
43:1396:98058:19:18:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:makes  the  necessary  deconvolution  analysis  unattractive  in  view  of  the  slow  convergence

43:1402:98575:18:18:72:540:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:up the set of parameters of the demand system we ultimately hope to recover.  Following

43:1404:98754:18:18:72:540:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:times in order to identify demand.  So we estimate the model using a sample of bidders who
43:1405:98844:18:18:72:540:430:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:submit either the first or second–highest bid in auctions on exactly two distinct resolution

46:1509:104302:18:18:72:539:544:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:exercise for the case whereαr= 20.  They now bid differently on each product, with the five
46:1510:104393:18:18:72:540:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dotted lines showing their bids on the lowest resolution camera (bottom line) up to the top
46:1511:104484:18:18:72:539:508:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:resolution camera (top line), asαcvaries.  The shape is largely preserved, except that now
46:1512:104574:18:24:72:467:490:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:there is a positive intercept because valuations are positive even withαc= 0.
46:1513:104651:24:18:72:539:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:In panels (c) and (d) we show the selection probabilities for these two types of bidders (αr= 0
46:1514:104746:18:18:72:539:448:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in (c) andαr= 20 in (d)) asαcvaries.  The “hump-shape” arises because the probability
46:1515:104831:18:18:72:539:430:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of|B|= 2 is increasing at first as the likelihood that the bidder is ever first or second rises,
46:1516:104927:18:18:72:540:412:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:but later declines as the probability that they win their first auction and exit before bidding
46:1517:105022:18:40:72:164:394:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:again goes to one.
46:1518:105040:40:18:72:539:354:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f3:B:Optimization.We now proceed to the problem of optimizing the likelihood.  Usually one
46:1519:105125:18:18:72:540:336:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:would proceed by applying some optimization routine in an outer loop to the likelihood (16),
46:1520:105217:18:18:72:539:318:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:evaluating it by Monte Carlo integration, holding the randomness in the draws ofαfixed
46:1521:105303:18:19:72:540:300:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:across evaluationsk(Pakes and Pollard, 1989).  But this is computationally costly,  as for
46:1522:105393:19:23:72:504:281:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:many differentαdraws we will have to evaluate the bidding and selection functions.
46:1523:105475:23:18:72:540:258:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Notice that the parameter vectorθenters the likelihood (16) only through the distribution
46:1524:105564:18:18:72:540:240:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of random coefficientsF(α|θ).  This allows us to employ an alternative approach based on
46:1525:105652:18:40:72:223:222:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:re-weighting.  Fixingα, define

47:1551:106399:18:18:71:539:580:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:for two reasons: first, for efficiency — we would like to sample more points from the center of
47:1552:106494:18:18:71:539:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the true distribution if possible, since this is where the gradient of the likelihood is sharpest.
47:1553:106592:18:18:71:539:544:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Second, we would like the sampled distribution to have unbounded support, mirroring our
47:1554:106679:18:24:71:247:526:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:parametric assumption onF(α|θ).

47:1571:107089:18:18:71:539:363:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of our estimator, as the second sample should be more centered and thus provide a better

47:1575:107311:19:18:71:539:250:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:resolution is the main determinant of consumer utility, but that there is substantial hetero-
47:1576:107404:18:18:71:539:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:geneity in how consumers value this attribute.  They predict a mean taste for cameras of
47:1577:107492:18:18:71:539:214:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:22.26  with  a  standard  deviation  of  51.06,  and  a  mean  taste  for  resolution  of  22.75  and  a

48:1604:109247:24:18:72:540:302:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The results in Table 6 suggests that our results fit the data reasonably well, though there

48:1606:109430:18:18:72:540:266:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to be largely a function of the parametric compromises we made in order to focus on the

48:1609:109695:18:18:72:540:212:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:quite closely.  Note that the moments are out-of-sample in that they incorporate bidders who

49:1616:110276:18:18:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:independent,  isolated  draws  from  a  distribution,  in  an  auction  marketplace  we  also  need
49:1617:110375:18:18:72:540:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to account for the selection of bidders into the observed and identified set.  Subject to the
49:1618:110468:18:19:72:540:617:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:constraints of non-participation, we are able to partially identify the distribution of types by
49:1619:110564:19:18:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:explicitly modeling this selection as a function of observable equilibrium objects.  We show
49:1620:110656:18:18:72:540:580:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that this result extends to accommodate familiar features of auction data and demand models
49:1621:110747:18:18:72:540:562:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in fixed-price markets,  including data limitations,  random coefficient demand,  unobserved
49:1622:110839:18:23:72:283:544:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:heterogeneity, and latent outside options.
49:1623:110881:23:19:72:540:521:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The selection correction turns out to be an important source of flexibility in the model.  It
49:1624:110974:19:18:72:540:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:allows us to accommodate standard limitations of auction data.  It also gives the econome-
49:1625:111064:18:18:72:540:484:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:trician flexibility to pick and choose sources of variation in the data — in this case particular
49:1626:111161:18:23:72:302:466:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:histories — that they trust for identification.
49:1627:111208:23:18:72:540:443:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:A second important source of flexibility in the model is that we have made all the substitution
49:1628:111303:18:18:72:539:425:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:between products occurinter-temporally.  High-dimensional preferences are thus projected
49:1629:111391:18:19:72:540:407:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:down  to  a  valuation  for  the  current  product  and  a  continuation  value  which  ,  thanks  to
49:1630:111492:19:18:72:540:388:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the Markov dynamics of the game, we can model in a straightforward way.  These Markov
49:1631:111577:18:18:72:540:370:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:dynamics also give us the flexibility to extend the state space of the game to incorporate
49:1632:111667:18:23:72:539:352:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:arbitrarypublicsignals about the state of the market on which bidder behavior may depend.
49:1633:111756:23:18:72:540:329:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:We illustrated much of this flexibility in an application to the auction market for compact
49:1634:111847:18:18:72:540:311:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:cameras on eBay.  There we estimated the distribution of types for a utility function that
49:1635:111937:18:19:72:540:293:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:looked a lot like the kind you might estimate in a fixed-price market using standard methods
49:1636:112029:19:18:72:540:274:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:in industrial organization. While we were able to document a substantial bias in the estimates
49:1637:112123:18:18:72:540:256:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of consumer surplus that would come out of an alternative, static model, as well as match
49:1638:112212:18:18:72:540:238:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:out-of sample moments of the bid distribution, the main objective was to illustrate the kinds
49:1639:112305:18:18:72:540:220:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of judgment calls faced by an econometrician applying our method, which can accommodate
49:1640:112392:18:18:72:540:202:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:a wide array of data limitations, utility functions, information structures, and assumptions
49:1641:112484:18:24:72:186:184:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:about outside options.
49:1642:112506:24:18:72:540:160:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Our contribution — the development of a demand system for auction markets — is meant
49:1643:112590:18:18:72:540:142:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:to mirror similar work in fixed-price markets, and to a similar end:  the structural estimation
49:1644:112685:18:18:72:540:124:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of demand allows us to do counterfactuals of both private and public interest.  Though we
49:1645:112774:18:18:72:540:106:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:have developed a flexible framework, there remain several open directions for future work:
49:1646:112864:18:0:72:540:88:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:we believe that our framework would generalize naturally to multi-unit demand, in which
50:1647:112953:0:18:72:540:671:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:bidders may shade against the opportunity cost of moving further down their marginal utility
50:1648:113045:18:18:72:540:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:curve.  This is an important direction for the modeling of ad auctions and treasury auctions.
50:1649:113138:18:18:72:540:635:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:There are also unmet challenges in the modeling of substitution across auctions within-period
50:1650:113231:18:19:72:540:617:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:rather than inter-temporally.  Auction markets are a pervasive mechanism for the allocation
50:1651:113322:19:18:72:540:598:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of goods and services, and beyond our contribution there remains much work to be done to
50:1652:113410:18:51:72:398:580:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:understand competition between and substitution among them.

55:1819:123311:18:18:72:540:330:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:everyβ∈Γ(C(X)) admits a modulus of continuity of 1, since by the argument of Lemma 1,
55:1820:123396:18:18:72:539:312:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:types that areε-close makeε-close best responses to any opposing bid distribution.  This
55:1821:123484:18:19:72:539:294:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:establishes that the set of functions Γ(C(X)) is uniformly equicontinuous, and it follows by

55:1823:123631:23:18:72:540:252:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:Next, we need to show that Γ is continuous inβwhenβ∈C(X). The first step is to show that
55:1824:123719:18:18:71:540:234:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the distribution of highest bidsμjis continuous inβin the weak-* topology, because payoffs
55:1825:123809:18:18:72:540:216:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:depend on rivals strategies only through the distribution of the highest competing bid.  Now,
55:1826:123902:18:18:72:540:198:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:this distribution arises from the composition of a sequence of functions:μj=g(κj(β(μF))),
55:1827:123991:18:19:72:539:180:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:whereμFis the underlying type distribution andβis the bidding function, so thatβ(μF) is
55:1828:124078:19:18:71:539:161:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:the distribution of pseudo-types ̃μj.  The functionκjmaps the pseudo-type distribution into
55:1829:124169:18:18:72:539:143:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:an ergodic distribution over the vector of bids in a auction for goodj(a vector of bids of
55:1830:124259:18:18:72:539:125:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:random length).  In earlier working papers we have shown thatκjis a continuous function
55:1831:124346:18:0:71:539:107:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:(i.e.  the ergodic distribution is well defined, unique, and smoothly varies with the bids of

56:1837:124823:23:18:71:539:575:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:The second step is to show that if the highest bid distributions are close in the sense of weak
56:1838:124918:18:18:71:539:557:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:convergence, then so are the best responses.  We first argue that the value functions must
56:1839:125008:18:18:71:539:539:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:be close.  Letvj(x,μ) be the value of the game forxstarting from an auction for productj,
56:1840:125097:18:19:71:539:521:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:when the bid distributions are given byμ={μj}.  Since the player can only win once and
56:1841:125183:19:18:71:540:502:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:exits exogenously at rate (1−r), this value is upper bounded for everyjby the maximum

58:2000:129116:30:18:72:539:239:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:B:Proof.We will prove that ̃Fis point identified; the partial identification ofFvia (6) follows
58:2001:129209:18:18:72:540:221:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:immediately.   To  do  this,  we  must  find  the  unconditional  density ̃f(b).   We  will  do  this
58:2002:129310:18:18:71:540:203:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:iteratively,  starting  with  pseudo-types  who  participate  on  all  products  (i.e.b>0),  and
58:2003:129406:18:18:71:539:185:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:proceeding with pseudo-types who participate on all but one product etc.  Formally, we will
58:2004:129497:18:18:71:540:167:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:show that ̃f(b) is identified by induction on the number of zero elements ofb, first showing
58:2005:129589:18:19:71:539:149:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:that  with  no  zero  elements  the  density  is  identified  (the  base  step),  and  then  that  if  the

58:2007:129788:18:23:71:249:112:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:zero elements (the induction step).
58:2008:129823:23:18:71:539:89:12:g_d0_f4:12:g_d0_f3:B:Base  step.In  the main  text  we show  that ̃f(b|b>0)  is  identified.  We  also observe  the

59:2013:130083:28:24:71:508:597:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:where the second expression is the probability that a random pseudo-type hasb>0.

59:2025:130966:18:18:72:539:405:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:arguments similar to those in Lemma 3, the probability of ending up in that set for anybn,

59:2027:131148:18:18:72:539:369:12:g_d0_f8:12:g_d0_f3:B:J-vector of bids).  And proceeding as in the base step, we can get the unconditional density
59:2028:131240:18:24:72:313:351:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B:of the (J−n)-dimensional bid vectors,fn(bn).

63:2255:138257:37:18:86:540:109:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:1.  We were somewhat concerned that we may have been observing some “shill” bidding
63:2256:138340:18:18:101:540:91:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:by sellers intent on raising revenues.  We used the following rather coarse procedure to
63:2257:138428:18:0:101:540:73:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:detect such bidding behavior:  for any given bidder, if they won at least five auctions
64:2258:138517:0:18:101:540:671:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:and at 80% of them were from the same seller, then we flagged them as a shill bidder.
64:2259:138602:18:18:101:540:653:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:We excluded all auctions in which a so-designated shill bidder was among the set of

64:2261:138702:28:19:86:540:607:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:2.  There are many senses in which a bid may be an “outlier”.  We excluded all winning
64:2262:138788:19:18:101:540:588:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:bids that were more than twice the sale price of the listing (either the second-highest

64:2264:138923:28:18:86:540:542:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:3.  Though  we  did  not  exclude  auctions  that  used  the  Auction-Buy-it-Now  feature,  we
64:2265:139017:18:18:101:540:524:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:A:did exclude auctions that ended with the execution of the BIN option.  This option
