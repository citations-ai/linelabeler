2:19:651:13:11:56:541:685:11:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:Abstract: In the modern society of today, consuming natural products is not a hobby anymore and it is a necessity for 
2:20:769:11:12:56:540:674:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:us regarding health. The first factors of disease are owed to unhealthy food and we cannot have a healthy food and a 
2:21:886:12:12:56:540:662:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:healthy organism if we do not remove from our food system the negative effects possessed by unhealthy food, even if it 
2:22:1005:12:11:56:540:650:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:is not the cheapest option. From the products consumed by people, a very important role for producing the necessary 
2:23:1121:11:12:56:540:639:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:energy  for  the  organism  is  given  to  vegetables. Thus,  we  aimed  the  study  of  using  decoctions  obtained  from  the 
2:24:1248:12:11:56:540:627:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:Aristolochia  Clematitis  plants  which  can  be  found  in  the  spontaneous  flora  of  Romania,  unpretentious  regarding  the 
2:25:1378:11:11:56:540:616:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:soil  and  which  can  combat  one  of  the  most  frequent  pests  met  in  cabbage  cultures:  cabbage  aphis  (Brevicoryne 
2:26:1504:11:12:56:541:605:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:brassicae  L.),  cabbage  fly  (Delia  brassicae),  cabbage  butterfly  (Pieris  brassicae).  The  elimination  of  contact 
2:27:1628:12:12:56:542:593:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:insecticides  and  chemical  substances  and  obtaining  healthier  products  are  several  purposes  by  using  these  methods.  
2:28:1758:12:11:56:541:581:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:The obtained decoctions were made by combining three types of plant mixes in order to identify which component part 
2:29:1874:11:12:56:540:570:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:is  richer  in  aristolochic  acid  and  which  decoction  gives  better  results  for  the  combat  of  insects  and  to  make  a  better 
2:30:2013:12:11:56:540:558:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:comparison  between  them  related  to  obtained  results.  There  were  taken  soil  samples  from  the  six  cultivars  between 
2:31:2143:11:12:56:541:547:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:planting  cabbage  seedlings  for  a  better  documentation.  After  the  observations  made  on  the  whole  period,  the  best 
2:32:2272:12:11:56:540:535:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:results were obtained at cultivars 1, 3, 5, 6 where cabbage plants were treated with decoction obtained from the roots 
2:33:2391:11:12:56:540:524:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:and where the  whole  plant combined with soap solution was used, followed by  cultivars  2 and 4 where there was not 
2:34:2509:12:11:56:540:512:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:used  Aristolochia  Clematitis  plants.  Because  the  results  obtained  were  satisfied  without  using  contact  insecticides,  a 
2:35:2642:11:12:56:541:501:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:larger investigation of these decoctions follows using only Aristolochia Clematitis plants or in combinations with other 
2:36:2763:12:13:56:477:489:10:Times New Roman:10:Times New Roman:F:plants which have very good results for ecological control of diseases and pests from vegetable cultures.

2:41:2961:14:14:56:59:422:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B: 
2:42:2961:14:14:99:541:408:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:There  are  cultivated  approximately  250.000  species  of  vegetables  worldwide  and  over  60 
2:43:3059:14:13:56:541:394:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:species  in  Romania.  Even  if  these  cultures  cover  relatively  limited  areas  (approximately  2%  from 
2:44:3169:13:14:56:541:381:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:the  arable  land)  and  the  made  production  workflow  exceeds  10%  from  the  vegetable  production, 
2:45:3275:14:14:56:541:367:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:vegetable  growing  represents  an  important  segment  of  national  wealth  which  must  be  kept  and 
2:46:3380:14:14:56:541:353:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:continually  extended.  The  cultivated  range  shows  that,  in  2000,  the  first  places  in  matter  of 
2:47:3488:14:14:56:541:339:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:production  are  occupied  by  tomatoes  (100,  8  mil.  t),  cabbage  (52,3  mil.  t),  followed  by  onion  and 
2:48:3602:14:13:56:245:325:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:carrots (information from FAO) [6, 7]. 
2:49:3640:13:14:99:541:312:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:By  vegetable  protection  we  can  understand  the  attainment  of  healthy  superior-quality 
2:50:3735:14:14:56:541:298:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:products using more and more ecological technologies. All the plants whose physiological balance 
2:51:3832:14:14:56:541:284:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:is  disturbed  are  affected  by  various  modifications  when  biological  phenomena  develop,  producing 
2:52:3939:14:14:56:277:270:12:g_d0_f10:12:Times New Roman:B:various changes, so we have an “ill” cultures. 
2:53:3985:14:13:99:541:256:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Every  plant  disease  has  a  determined  aspect  with  pathogen  clear  symptoms  which  can 
2:54:4079:13:14:56:350:243:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:manifest different related to the soil, weather, water and age. 
2:55:4142:14:14:99:541:229:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The  qualitative  and  quantitative  increase  of  vegetable  production  is  conditioned  by 
2:56:4236:14:14:56:246:215:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:phytosanitary protection measurement. 
2:57:4273:14:14:99:541:201:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The  insufficient  knowledge  of  vegetables  lifestyle,  especially  those from  the  cabbage 
2:58:4368:14:13:56:541:187:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:group, of pathogen agents, of diseases and pests which can provoke considerable damages, leads to 
2:59:4466:13:14:56:541:174:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:damages in production. It is very important to mention that every plant in this class has a different 
2:60:4568:14:14:56:244:160:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:sensibility which is treated differently.

4:146:9592:14:14:56:525:434:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:hot water for 30 minutes. After cooling, this preparation was pulverized on the infested cultivars. 
4:147:9691:14:13:99:541:420:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The  second  preparation  was  made  from  Aristolochia  Clematitis  stems  which  were  boiled

6:313:11920:13:14:322:325:583:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A: 
6:314:11920:14:14:99:453:569:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:We can affirm that the decoction 3 had the best results on the three pests. 
6:315:11995:14:14:99:541:555:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The  cabbage  cultivars  behaved  different,  thus  the  cultivars  1,  3,  5  and  6  which  were 
6:316:12094:14:14:56:541:541:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:enclosed with  Aristolochia Clematitis plants too behaved very  well, obtaining very  good  results at 
6:317:12197:14:13:56:541:527:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:infestation with Pieris brassicae, which avoided these cultivars because of the strong odour released 
6:318:12299:13:14:56:221:514:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:by Aristolochia Clematitis plants. 
6:319:12333:14:14:99:541:500:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The cultivars 2 and 4 were the most hard to be maintained healthy because the pest attack 
6:320:12423:14:14:56:293:486:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:was not eliminated totally with these decoctions. 
6:321:12472:14:14:99:541:472:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The  manual  maintain  work  was  important  because  we  obtained  cultures  with  good 
6:322:12561:14:13:56:288:458:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:productivity and good results regarding quality. 
6:323:12609:13:14:99:541:445:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Each  plant  disease  has  a  determined  aspect  with  pathogen  clear  symptoms  which  can 
6:324:12703:14:14:56:350:431:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:manifest different related to the soil, weather, water and age. 
6:325:12766:14:14:99:473:417:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:Each plant from this class has a different sensibility and is treated differently. 
6:326:12848:14:14:99:541:403:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:A:The decoctions 1 and 3  gave the best results  after the  researches  and they are in view  for 
6:327:12944:14:13:56:372:389:12:Times New Roman:12:Times New Roman:B:recommendation for usage in production for vegetable obtaining.
