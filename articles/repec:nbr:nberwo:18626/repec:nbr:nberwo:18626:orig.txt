2:32:1913:28:14:72:540:588:12:Times:12:Times:I propose a positive model of the university that generates many apparently peculiar features of universities
2:33:2022:14:14:72:540:574:12:Times:12:Times:such as endowments and tuition subsidies.  The model proposes a specific objective function:  a university
2:34:2128:14:14:72:540:560:12:Times:12:Times:maximizes its contribution to the intellectual capital of society, valued at social returns.  The objective
2:35:2235:14:14:72:540:546:12:Times:12:Times:function is enforced within the model–that is, it leads to actions that reinforce the initial selection of
2:36:2341:14:14:72:540:532:12:Times:12:Times:the objective function.  Endowments also arise naturally within the model:  they are a necessary feature
2:37:2445:14:14:72:540:518:12:Times:12:Times:of certain universities, not an accident.  The model has important implications for the decisions that
2:38:2547:14:14:72:540:504:12:Times:12:Times:universities should make on many fronts, but I focus on the implications for financial decisions, especially
2:39:2655:14:14:72:540:490:12:Times:12:Times:universities' endowment spending rules and portfolio allocations.  The model is designed to explain
2:40:2754:14:14:72:540:476:12:Times:12:Times:America's great private research universities and very selective liberal arts colleges and–with modest
2:41:2856:14:14:72:540:462:12:Times:12:Times:adaptations–institutions like America's and Britain's great public research universities.  Indeed, a ancillary
2:42:2966:14:14:72:540:448:12:Times:12:Times:benefit of the model is that it provides a justification for existence of the aforementioned institutions
2:43:3071:14:42:72:459:434:12:Times:12:Times:by assigning them a unique role in the creation of the world's intellectual capital.

3:51:3327:0:28:263:348:684:12:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:I.  INTRODUCTION
3:52:3343:28:28:108:509:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:In this paper, I propose a positive model of the university in which many apparently
3:53:3427:28:28:72:535:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:peculiar features of universities--such as endowments and tuition subsidies--are generated by the
3:54:3524:28:29:72:539:600:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:internal logic of the model.  The model proposes a specific objective function for universities and
3:55:3623:29:28:72:538:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:demonstrates how it is enforced.  That is, the objective function leads to actions that reinforce the
3:56:3724:28:28:72:539:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:initial selection of the objective function.  The model has important implications for the decisions
3:57:3824:28:29:72:506:515:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that universities should make on many fronts.  In this paper, I focus on the implications for
3:58:3917:29:28:72:528:486:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:financial decisions, especially universities' endowment spending rules and portfolio allocation. 
3:59:4014:28:28:72:534:458:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The model is designed to explain America's great private research universities and very selective
3:60:4111:28:29:72:524:430:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:liberal arts colleges and--with modest adaptations--institutions that are partly controlled by the
3:61:4209:29:28:72:533:401:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:state such as America's and Britain's great public research universities. The model is designed to
3:62:4307:28:28:72:507:373:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:explain them precisely because many people find them hardest to explain, even enigmatic. 
3:63:4396:28:29:72:530:345:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Indeed, an ancillary benefit of the model is that it provides a justification for the existence of all
3:64:4498:29:28:72:539:316:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of the aforesaid institutions by assigning them a unique role in the creation of intellectual capital. 
3:65:4601:28:28:72:527:288:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A simpler version of the model could explain most other colleges and universities, and this is a
3:66:4697:28:29:72:216:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:topic to which I return briefly.
3:67:4729:29:28:108:539:231:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A very brief intuition into the model, laid out in Section III, is as follows.  Each university
3:68:4824:28:28:72:529:203:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:maximizes its contribution to society's intellectual capital by making two types of investments: 
3:69:4921:28:29:72:506:175:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:(i) investments in advanced human capital embodied in people and (ii) investments in new
3:70:5009:29:28:72:522:146:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:knowledge embodied in research.  These investments have peculiar properties that make them
3:71:5099:28:28:72:533:118:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:unlikely to be financed by conventional means.  In making these investments, universities play a
3:72:5195:28:0:72:505:90:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:role that closely parallels that of a venture capitalist.  They invest not only money, but also
4:73:5327:0:28:72:495:684:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:expertise and infrastructure.  The university gets what is essentially an equity stake in its
4:74:5420:28:28:72:511:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:intellectual capital investments.  Collecting these (equity-type) returns is a key difficulty for
4:75:5517:28:28:72:524:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:universities, and it is in overcoming this difficulty that universities (i) generate an endowment,
4:76:5615:28:29:72:524:600:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:not merely gifts and grants for current use and (ii) reinforce the initial choice of their objective
4:77:5715:29:28:72:341:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:function so that the model is, as a logical matter, closed.
4:78:5774:28:28:108:537:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This paper draws heavily upon Hoxby (forthcoming) in that the model of the university is
4:79:5862:28:29:72:508:515:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the same.  However, those chapters present empirical evidence that justifies how the model
4:80:5952:29:28:72:513:486:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:characterizes universities.  They also explain how universities evolved over decades into the
4:81:6045:28:28:72:509:458:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:institutions that they are modeled as being.  In this paper, I present the model without much
4:82:6138:28:29:72:536:430:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:empirical justification and without history.  Hoxby (forthcoming) also examines the implications
4:83:6234:29:28:72:534:401:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of the model for universities' policies on tuition, admissions, and a variety of other outcomes.  In
4:84:6334:28:28:72:493:373:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:this paper, I touch on these policies glancingly at most and focus on the implications for
4:85:6424:28:29:72:194:345:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:endowment management.
4:86:6445:29:28:108:529:316:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:       The papers to which this study is most closely related are Hansmann (1990) and Merton
4:87:6537:28:28:72:518:288:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:(1993).  The Hansmann paper is a masterful review of many explanations of why universities
4:88:6627:28:29:72:536:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:have endowments and what each justification implies for endowment management.  He carefully
4:89:6718:29:28:72:525:231:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:analyzes and rejects both the intergenerational equity model of Tobin (1974) and extensions of
4:90:6812:28:28:72:535:203:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the intergenerational equity model that presume that there will be an increasing cost of education
4:91:6910:28:29:72:531:175:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:for succeeding generations.   The latter type of model produces spending rules along the lines of
4:92:7007:29:28:72:521:146:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the Stanford Rule (Merhling, Goldman, and Sedlacek 2005).  Hansmann also analyzes several
4:93:7096:28:28:72:517:118:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:partial explanations for endowments and their management rules--for instance, programming
4:94:7185:28:0:72:511:90:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:models--such as Grinold, Hopkins, and Massy (1978)--which do not maximize an objective
5:95:7308:0:28:72:528:684:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:function that values education and research but merely assess whether a rule can attain a metric
5:96:7404:28:28:72:539:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:such as maintaining a certain ratio of expenses to endowment.  Hansmann even carefully assesses
5:97:7499:28:28:72:532:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:casual explanations for endowments such as the character and incentives of people who serve as
5:98:7593:28:29:72:162:600:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:university trustees.
5:99:7613:29:28:108:536:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Following his review--which I do not imitate in this paper, partly because his review is so
5:100:7704:28:28:72:383:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:masterful and partly for reasons of length--Hansmann concludes:
5:101:7767:28:29:108:496:515:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The argument that has been offered most frequently in recent years to explain the
5:102:7848:29:28:108:494:486:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:accumulation of endowments-that they are a means to intergenerational equity-is
5:103:7927:28:28:108:497:458:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:unpersuasive.  More compelling reasons to accumulate endowments are that they
5:104:8004:28:29:108:494:430:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:serve as a financial buffer against periods of financial adversity, that they help to
5:105:8089:29:28:108:472:401:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:insure the long-run survival of the institution's reputational capital, that they
5:106:8170:28:28:108:479:373:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:protect the institution's intellectual freedom, and that they assist in passing on
5:107:8252:28:29:108:482:345:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:values prized by the present generation.  It is not clear, however, that these are
5:108:8334:29:28:108:498:316:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:today the reasons why endowments are accumulated.  Nor is it clear that the sizes
5:109:8415:28:28:108:502:288:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of existing endowments, and the ways in which they are managed, are well chosen
5:110:8494:28:29:108:481:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to serve these goals.  In particular, prevailing endowment spending rules seem
5:111:8572:29:28:108:484:231:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:inconsistent with most of these objectives. We cannot say, from the arguments
5:112:8649:28:28:108:501:203:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and evidence surveyed here, that the endowments of the major private universities
5:113:8730:28:29:108:485:175:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:today are either too big or too small.  It does appear, however, that surprisingly
5:114:8812:29:28:108:461:146:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:little thought has been devoted to the purposes for which endowments are
5:115:8884:28:28:108:494:118:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:maintained and that, as a consequence, their rate of accumulation and the pattern
5:116:8965:28:0:108:495:90:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of spending from their income have been managed without much attention to the
6:117:9079:0:28:108:361:684:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ultimate objectives of the institutions that hold them.
6:118:9134:28:28:72:533:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:In other words, Hansmann concludes that there is not a satisfying, positive model of universities
6:119:9231:28:28:72:504:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:in which endowments play a logical and necessary role.  He does not himself propose one.
6:120:9319:28:29:108:520:600:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:In many ways, Merton takes off where Hansmann ends.  Indeed, his paper begins with
6:121:9401:29:28:72:537:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:part of the above quotation from Hansmann.  Merton's key contributions are (i) to focus attention
6:122:9498:28:29:72:533:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:on the non-endowment sources of cash flow for universities (tuition, gifts, and so on), and (ii) to
6:123:9597:29:28:72:535:514:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:solve the problem of how to manage an endowment given these non-endowment sources of cash
6:124:9686:28:29:72:518:486:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:flow and flows of expenses.  Merton treats the cash flow and expenses as exogenous because
6:125:9776:29:28:72:537:457:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:"that abstraction does not significantly alter the optimal portfolio allocations."  Merton's article is
6:126:9879:28:28:72:486:429:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:a great contribution that is not only useful to the broad scholarly community but that is
6:127:9968:28:29:72:500:401:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:specifically helpful to this study because it allows me to focus on questions that he leaves

6:129:10072:28:28:108:539:344:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:I focus on:  what the university's objective is; why that objective generates sources of cash
6:130:10165:28:28:72:516:316:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:flow like gifts, tuition, and grants; why endowments exist; and how the endowment and cash
6:131:10255:28:29:72:534:288:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:flows are interdependent.  Essentially, my model sets up the structural version of the university's
6:132:10354:29:28:72:515:259:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:investment problem.  For each such problem, there exists a reduced-form version that can be
6:133:10445:28:28:72:532:231:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:written strictly in terms of cash flows.  This reduced-form problem is solved in Merton's paper--
6:134:10542:28:29:72:273:203:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:except for some issues that I take up later.
6:135:10586:29:28:108:533:174:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:In addition to the closely related papers by Hansmann and Merton, there is a rich but less
6:136:10676:28:37:72:524:146:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:related literature on the management of endowment portfolios (the types of securities in which
6:137:10770:37:12:121:110:109:10:g_d0_f1:6:g_d0_f1:    I believe that this is a fair characterization of Merton's paper because he writes:  The course taken here is1
6:138:10884:12:11:72:537:97:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:to address this question in the middle range:  it does not attempt to specify... the objective function for the university,
6:139:11007:11:12:72:513:86:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:but it does derive optimal investment and expenditure for [the] endowment in a context which takes account of
6:140:11116:12:0:72:457:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:overall university objectives and the availability of other sources of revenue besides endowment.
7:141:11250:0:28:72:519:684:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:they should invest) and on spending rules (the amount of the annual return on the endowment
7:142:11341:28:28:72:351:656:12:g_d0_f1:7:g_d0_f1:that should be spent rather than saved in the endowment).  Many of these papers provide2
7:143:11429:28:28:72:508:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:important estimates of elasticities or other parameters--for instance, the sacrifice in average
7:144:11524:28:29:72:531:600:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:returns and decrease in risk that universities experience when they invest more of their portfolio
7:145:11622:29:28:72:527:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:in bonds.  Or, to take another example, Brown, Dimmock, and Weisbenner (2012) estimate the
7:146:11712:28:28:72:500:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:response of donations to the rate of return on the endowment.  However, as noted by both
7:147:11800:28:29:72:530:515:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Hansmann and Merton, this rich array of papers tend to take no stand on why endowments exist
7:148:11892:29:28:72:520:486:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:or the purpose they serve and instead rely--explicitly or implicitly--on a rule of thumb such as
7:149:11988:28:29:72:519:458:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:needing to maintain a perpetual level flow of expected real income.  Thus, the body of papers
7:150:12081:29:28:72:523:429:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:referenced in this paragraph, although terribly useful given an objective function and reduced-
7:151:12176:28:29:72:352:401:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:form rules based on it, are logically posterior to this paper.
7:152:12238:29:28:108:496:372:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This paper contrasts with the small existing literature that does propose objective
7:153:12321:28:28:72:308:344:12:g_d0_f1:7:g_d0_f1:functions for universities--most notably prestige.  These papers strike me as unsatisfactory in3
7:154:12417:28:28:72:517:316:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that prestige is a fundamentally incomplete explanation.  The authors never demonstrate why
7:155:12508:28:29:72:522:288:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:institutions should compete on the particular metrics of prestige--endowments and admissions
7:156:12600:29:28:72:496:259:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:thresholds--that the authors choose.  They never explain why endowments or admissions
7:157:12685:28:63:72:539:231:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:thresholds exist in the first place so that they could be grounds for prestige competitions.  Indeed,

7:165:13410:12:0:72:419:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:explanation is ever-increasing demand for elite higher education--see Clotfelter (1996).
8:166:13535:0:28:72:504:684:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:saying that universities compete for prestige seems merely to be conceding that there is no
8:167:13626:28:28:72:534:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:positive model of universities, with the result that universities must necessarily be said to pursue
8:168:13726:28:28:72:387:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:essentially superficial goals that happen to have predictive power.
8:169:13793:28:29:108:505:600:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The structure of the remainder of the paper is as follows.  In section II, I review the
8:170:13880:29:28:72:511:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:venture capital problem because it clarifies important features of the university's investment
8:171:13974:28:28:72:522:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:problem.  In section III, I lay out a positive model of the university.  Section IV presents a less
8:172:14073:28:29:72:537:515:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:abstract, more down-to-earth portrait of a university that is described by the model.  In section V,
8:173:14173:29:28:72:530:486:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:I describe the implications of the model for endowment spending and portfolio allocation.  This
8:174:14268:28:28:72:533:458:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:is where Merton (1993) plays an important role.  Finally, in section VI, I conclude by explaining
8:175:14365:28:57:72:406:430:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:what the model has to say about some questions that commonly arise.
8:176:14432:57:28:216:395:373:12:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:II.  THE VENTURE CAPITAL PROBLEM
8:177:14461:28:29:108:507:345:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:It may appear to be a digression to review the venture capital problem and how it is
8:178:14545:29:28:72:537:316:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:solved before moving to universities.  However, it is efficient to conduct this review because it is
8:179:14645:28:28:72:528:288:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:easier to see the structure of the problem when it is presented in its more abstract form, without
8:180:14743:28:29:72:535:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:all of the details that often confound analysis of universities.  Although economists who work on
8:181:14840:29:28:72:533:231:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the venture capital problem usually lay it out in a fairly different way from the presentation here,
8:182:14940:28:106:72:531:203:12:g_d0_f1:7:g_d0_f1:the fundamental problem and aspects of the solution I present draw heavily upon this literature.4
8:183:15037:106:11:111:110:97:10:g_d0_f1:6:g_d0_f1:  I rely particularly on Repullo and Suarez's (2004) elegant exposition.  Other helpful papers include:4
8:184:15141:11:12:72:522:86:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:Bergemann and Hege (1998), Berglof (1994), Casamatta (2003), Gompers (1995), Gorman and Sahlman (1989),
8:185:15244:12:0:72:367:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:Kaplan and Strömberg (2001, 2003), Sahlman (1990), and Trester (1998).
9:186:15351:0:28:72:254:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:II.A.  Problematic investment projects
9:187:15389:28:28:108:466:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:There exists a set of investment projects with the following characteristics:
9:188:15466:28:28:72:526:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:•  They are brought forward by a person (or persons) whose unique capacities are necessary for
9:189:15560:28:29:72:521:600:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the success of the project.  For instance, this person could be someone who has the idea for an
9:190:15655:29:28:72:318:571:12:g_d0_f1:7:g_d0_f1:invention.  Hereafter, I call this person the "agent."5
9:191:15710:28:28:72:534:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:• To be successful, the project requires assets--usually described as expertise and infrastructure--
9:192:15810:28:29:72:510:515:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:whose building or adjustment costs are convex in the per-period increase in their amount or
9:193:15901:29:28:72:494:486:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:diversity.  This is just to say that it is expensive to build the relevant assets very quickly,
9:194:15996:28:28:72:534:458:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:especially if one does not already a foundation of closely related assets.  For instance, the project
9:195:16097:28:29:72:530:430:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:may require expertise in finance, marketing, the law, certain engineering, or some other body of
9:196:16193:29:28:72:526:401:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:knowledge.  The infrastructure required may be the plant and equipment necessary to construct
9:197:16286:28:28:72:519:373:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and test a prototype of the invention.  What is important is that the project requires assets that
9:198:16384:28:29:72:531:345:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:have costs that are convex in the way described.  Hereafter, I use the phrase "convex adjustment
9:199:16480:29:28:72:205:316:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:costs" to refer to such costs.
9:200:16510:28:28:72:533:288:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:• Unless an assessor has expertise in areas related to the agent's unique capacity, his estimates of
9:201:16610:28:29:72:398:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the potential profitability of the project will be extremely imprecise.
9:202:16681:29:28:72:522:231:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:• The project is risky.  This almost goes without saying since (i) it depends on the existence of
9:203:16778:28:28:72:522:203:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the agent who could, say, be killed in an accident and (ii) something about the project must be
9:204:16873:28:29:72:372:175:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:advanced if only an expert can assess its potential profitability.
9:205:16939:29:60:108:537:146:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:These conditions generate a problem.  The agent cannot get financing for the project from
9:206:17028:60:12:111:110:86:10:g_d0_f1:6:g_d0_f1:  He is typically called the entrepreneur in the venture capital literature, but this conveys a false sense that5
9:207:17141:12:0:72:239:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:the project is routinely a start-up business.
10:208:17223:0:28:72:537:684:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:a bank or raise money in some other conventional way because (i) the bank or other conventional
10:209:17318:28:28:72:525:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:financier has insufficient expertise to assess the project and cannot build this expertise without
10:210:17416:28:28:72:524:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:incurring prohibitive costs and (ii) the agent's costs of building the expertise and infrastructure
10:211:17515:28:29:72:507:600:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:himself are prohibitive.  Even if the agent were able to get financing from a bank, he might
10:212:17607:29:28:72:532:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:substantially under-finance the project because he is risk-averse and his investment would entail
10:213:17704:28:28:72:230:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:a great deal of undiversified risk.
10:214:17739:28:29:72:309:515:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:II.B.  The potential for a venture capital solution 
10:215:17791:29:28:108:529:486:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Venture capitalists are a potential solution to this problem.  They are modeled as people
10:216:17880:28:28:72:486:458:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:who have a pool of financial capital to invest and who have already built expertise and
10:217:17967:28:29:72:529:430:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:infrastructure in areas relevant to certain types of projects.  A venture capitalist invests not only
10:218:18068:29:28:72:507:401:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:money but also expertise and infrastructure.  Using his expertise, he selects projects whose
10:219:18160:28:28:72:527:373:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:expected rate of return exceeds a threshold based the opportunity costs for his financial capital,
10:220:18258:28:29:72:536:345:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:expertise, and infrastructure.  In return for making an investment, the venture capitalist gets what
10:221:18358:29:28:72:394:316:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:is essentially an equity position in the project (more on this below).
10:222:18428:28:28:108:527:288:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The venture capital problem exists precisely because the costs of building expertise and
10:223:18516:28:29:72:528:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:infrastructure are convex as described.  This has a few implications.  First, a venture capitalist's
10:224:18616:29:28:72:520:231:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:portfolio is necessarily limited in its breadth and size by the cost of building diverse expertise
10:225:18714:28:28:72:528:203:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and infrastructure.  His portfolio may contain many projects and be much more diversified than
10:226:18808:28:29:72:527:175:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:any one of these projects, but it will be far less diverse than, say, a market index fund.  Second,
10:227:18907:29:28:72:503:146:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the venture capitalist will want to finance a stream of projects over a number of years--not
10:228:18999:28:28:72:535:118:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:finance a single generation of projects and then get out of the business.  This is because the costs
10:229:19099:28:0:72:519:90:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of building expertise and infrastructure are convex in the speed of doing it.  Thus, the venture
11:230:19233:0:28:72:536:684:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:capitalist's investments in expertise and infrastructure are more likely to pay off if he builds them
11:231:19334:28:28:72:533:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:gradually and employs them for several generations of projects.  Third, the venture capitalist has
11:232:19432:28:28:72:493:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:strong incentives to maintain his expertise and infrastructure, as opposed to letting them
11:233:19522:28:29:72:527:600:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:depreciate.  He will fear situations in which his returns from projects are insufficient to support
11:234:19621:29:28:72:498:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:maintenance-type investments in his expertise and infrastructure.  For instance, a venture
11:235:19711:28:28:72:537:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:capitalist who was short on current income might lose his experts to other employers.  If much of
11:236:19808:28:29:72:527:515:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:this were to occur, his ability to continue his venture capital business would be in doubt.  Thus,
11:237:19906:29:28:72:502:486:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:venture capitalists may wish to have a smoother stream of investments than an investor in
11:238:19995:28:28:72:528:458:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:financial markets.  Fourth, the cost structure implies that projects will crowd one another out at
11:239:20093:28:29:72:537:430:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the margin.  That is, two projects may have similar potential profitability and might each pass the
11:240:20192:29:28:72:532:401:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:venture capitalist's threshold if each could use his existing stock of expertise and infrastructure. 
11:241:20293:28:28:72:507:373:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:However, neither project might justify the venture capitalist's quickly building enough new
11:242:20384:28:29:72:505:345:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:expertise and infrastructure to accommodate it.  The potential for crowding out means that
11:243:20474:29:28:72:535:316:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:venture capitalists will acquire a good deal of information about an agent before making an offer
11:244:20571:28:28:72:106:288:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to him.
11:245:20578:28:29:108:536:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The venture capital solution to the investment problem contains two-sided moral hazard: 
11:246:20666:29:28:72:537:231:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the agent must make effort and contribute his unique capacity but the venture capitalist must also
11:247:20764:28:28:72:526:203:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:contribute his expertise and infrastructure.  This moral hazard has two important implications. 
11:248:20860:28:29:72:531:175:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:First, the problems caused by moral hazard decrease as the project's potential profitability rises: 
11:249:20960:29:28:72:521:146:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Both parties will be glad to make effort when they realize that they are in a situation with vast
11:250:21057:28:28:72:530:118:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:potential profits.   Thus, the optimal contract concentrates the returns to the venture capitalist in
11:251:21158:28:0:72:512:90:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the best states of the world.  For instance, a contract might specify that the venture capitalist
12:252:21293:0:28:72:511:684:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:receives no share of the returns if the profits are below some threshold, a certain share if the
12:253:21389:28:28:72:531:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:profits are in some intermediate range, and a higher share if profits are in a high range.  Second,
12:254:21488:28:28:72:538:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:owing to moral hazard, the optimal contract will make the agent fund some share of the project if
12:255:21585:28:29:72:536:600:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:he can.  This is because the agent's moral hazard shrinks as he himself invests more:  he will lose
12:256:21684:29:28:72:505:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:his own stake if he makes no effort.  Thus, within a relevant range, the venture capitalist is
12:257:21778:28:28:72:535:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:willing to invest more when the agent invests more, and the entire project can be more optimally
12:258:21874:28:29:72:182:515:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:financed and managed.
12:259:21895:29:28:108:522:486:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A final thing worth mentioning is that venture capitalists can bring "outside money" to
12:260:21982:28:28:72:526:458:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:projects to improve their solution.  That is, the venture capitalist may find himself in situations
12:261:22081:28:29:72:527:430:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:where he has sufficient expertise and infrastructure for a project but insufficient funds.  In such
12:262:22180:29:28:72:524:401:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:cases, he may be able to get external financing for the project that the agent could never get on
12:263:22277:28:28:72:535:373:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:his own because (i) the venture capitalist is known to have the expertise to assess the project and
12:264:22376:28:29:72:526:345:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:(ii) the credibility of venture capitalist's announced assessment is increased by his investing his
12:265:22475:29:28:72:270:316:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:own expertise, infrastructure, and money.
12:266:22516:28:28:108:526:288:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Summing up, an investment project of the type described is more likely to be optimally
12:267:22602:28:29:72:304:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:funded--that is, solved by venture capital--when:
12:268:22651:29:28:72:537:231:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:• the expertise and infrastructure required are such that a venture capitalist can pay for the cost of
12:269:22753:28:28:72:532:203:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:building and maintaining them by earning returns on a sufficiently large and diverse portfolio of
12:270:22850:28:29:72:207:175:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:(somewhat related) projects;
12:271:22878:29:28:72:538:146:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:• the venture capitalist does not so discount the future that he is unwilling to use his expertise and
12:272:22980:28:28:72:319:118:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:infrastructure over multiple generations of projects;
12:273:23033:28:0:72:489:90:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:• the expected returns to the project are sufficient to clear the threshold set by a venture
13:274:23163:0:28:72:443:684:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:capitalist's opportunity costs of financial capital, expertise, and infrastructure;
13:275:23246:28:28:72:515:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:• reasonably optimal contracts are possible.  These will entail the venture capitalist's taking a
13:276:23343:28:28:72:531:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:sufficiently small equity share that the agent's moral hazard problem is not crippling.  The agent
13:277:23441:28:29:72:513:600:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:will typically make some contribution (even if it is only his time and effort), and the venture
13:278:23536:29:56:72:409:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:capitalist will typically hold a non-linear equity position in the project.
13:279:23611:56:29:227:384:515:12:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:III.  THE UNIVERSITY'S PROBLEM
13:280:23639:29:28:108:527:486:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:In this section, I create a convenient fiction, the "founder," to embody the people whose
13:281:23728:28:28:72:522:458:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:assets and actions have shaped what universities have become.  While actual universities have
13:282:23821:28:29:72:513:430:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:often developed what they do and how they finance it through a combination of vision, trial,
13:283:23913:29:28:72:527:401:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:muddle, competition, and imitation, the founder is blessed with extremely clear vision, rational
13:284:24009:28:28:72:507:373:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:expectations, and well-defined objectives.  Obviously, the founder is not meant to be taken
13:285:24100:28:29:72:514:345:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:literally, but he makes it easier to lay out a positive model of the university because he is the
13:286:24197:29:28:72:525:316:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:prime mover and has an abstract understanding of the problem he is trying to solve.  It is by no
13:287:24293:28:28:72:532:288:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:means necessary for actual university leaders to have been so concerted or to articulate similarly
13:288:24391:28:29:72:515:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:abstract models of their universities--just as it is not necessary for actual corporate leaders to
13:289:24489:29:39:72:354:231:12:g_d0_f1:7:g_d0_f1:manage or speak about their firms in highly abstract ways.6
13:290:24548:39:12:111:110:192:10:g_d0_f1:6:g_d0_f1:  Although the founder is probably best thought of as an abstract person or persons, there are people who6
13:291:24654:12:12:72:517:180:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:have founded universities recently enough for us to observe their motives and action:  Leland and Jane Stanford
13:292:24765:12:12:72:530:168:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:(founders of Stanford University), Andrew Carnegie and Richard and Andrew Mellon (founders of the two parts of
13:293:24875:12:12:72:522:156:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:what is now Carnegie-Mellon University), Peter and Hannah Widener (founders of Widener University), John D.
13:294:24982:12:11:72:526:144:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:Rockefeller (founder of Rockefeller University), and so on.  All of these people took funds that they had earned in
13:295:25097:11:12:72:528:133:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:enterprises that were privately profitable--railroads, steel, chemicals, shipping, oil--and dedicated them to society's
13:296:25216:12:12:72:534:121:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:good by founding a university.  Their first moves were hiring faculty from other universities, accumulating libraries,
13:297:25334:12:12:72:528:109:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:building laboratories, and otherwise creating expertise and infrastructure.  Of course, great private universities like
13:298:25453:12:11:72:497:97:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:Harvard and Yale also had founders, but they are sufficiently "historical" for their motives to be less easily
13:299:25563:11:12:72:536:86:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:characterized.  This is not to say that these universities do not fit the model, but that explaining them requires a more
13:300:25684:12:0:72:155:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:historical approach.  
14:301:25744:0:28:108:528:684:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The founder's goal is to use his initial capital, acquired through some exogenous means,
14:302:25832:28:28:72:530:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to make the maximum contribution to society's intellectual capital, each unit of which he values
14:303:25928:28:29:72:538:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:at its social (private plus public) return.   It is important that the founder wants to add intellectual
14:304:26032:29:28:72:530:599:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:capital, not merely fund intellectual capital that society would readily create in his absence.  For
14:305:26132:28:29:72:496:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:instance, if a person's optimal education is such that he could finance it on his own using
14:306:26223:29:28:72:519:542:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:conventional means, that person is not of interest to the founder.  In practice, this puts aside a
14:307:26321:28:28:72:524:514:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:good share of human capital investments that earn private returns, are not terribly risky, do not
14:308:26418:28:29:72:533:486:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:require great expertise for a loan officer to assess, and do not require highly expert instructors or
14:309:26519:29:28:72:287:457:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:infrastructure with convex adjustment costs. 
14:310:26564:28:28:108:526:429:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Rather, the founder takes as his problem some part of the market for intellectual capital
14:311:26653:28:29:72:534:401:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that will be missing without his intervention.  This is parallel to the venture capitalist's taking on
14:312:26755:29:28:72:537:372:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:some set of investments that will not occur if they are constrained to use conventional financing. 
14:313:26854:28:28:72:523:344:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Advanced intellectual capital has properties that make investments in it likely to be missing or
14:314:26950:28:28:72:127:316:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:undersized.
14:315:26961:28:29:72:370:288:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:III.A.  The peculiar properties of advanced intellectual capital
14:316:27025:29:28:108:528:259:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:I define intellectual capital as knowledge that generates welfare for society in any way--
14:317:27115:28:28:72:525:231:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:private earnings, private non-monetary benefits, public benefits, and so on.  Intellectual capital
14:318:27213:28:29:72:539:203:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:takes one of two forms:  human capital and research, which I differentiate, for clarity, as follows. 
14:319:27314:29:28:72:535:174:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Human capital is knowledge that is stored in a person's brain and that cannot be used without his
14:320:27411:28:29:72:513:146:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:making complementary effort.  Human capital need not be new knowledge:  a engineer who
14:321:27497:29:28:72:533:117:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:knows how to solve a certain well-understood type of problem has human capital.  Research is a
14:322:27591:28:0:72:533:89:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:contribution to the stock of world knowledge that can be embodied in some form--a publication,
15:323:27723:0:28:72:507:684:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:for instance--that it is independent of any particular person.  This is not to say that research
15:324:27819:28:28:72:534:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:generates returns without some person's effort.  A publication that contains new knowledge does
15:325:27914:28:28:72:369:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:not generate returns unless someone interprets and employs it.
15:326:27976:28:29:108:519:600:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Creating advanced intellectual capital generally requires three factors:  human capital,
15:327:28064:29:28:72:515:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:research, and infrastructure.  It is hard to get to the frontier of knowledge without benefitting
15:328:28161:28:28:72:521:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:from previous knowledge in the form of research and/or the human capital of instructors, who
15:329:28253:28:29:72:519:515:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:help people learn how to interpret research for themselves and who transfer the knowledge in
15:330:28345:29:28:72:513:486:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:their own brains.  It is hard to conduct research without infrastructure such as laboratories in
15:331:28441:28:28:72:525:458:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:which experiments are conducted, libraries in which research is stored, or classrooms in which
15:332:28535:28:29:72:498:430:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:people with human capital instruct others.  Moreover, these three factors--human capital,
15:333:28624:29:28:72:533:401:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:research, and infrastructure--interact in complex ways so that, for instance, there is little point in
15:334:28726:28:28:72:521:373:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:building a laboratory without the right complement of researchers to go in it.  The result of all
15:335:28823:28:29:72:528:345:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:this is that it is hard to build the capacity to create advanced intellectual capital "from scratch." 
15:336:28924:29:28:72:507:316:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Building this capacity has costs that are convex in the per-period increase in amount and in
15:337:29016:28:28:72:116:288:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:diversity.
15:338:29026:28:29:108:528:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Even if they have access to the same human capital, research, and infrastructure, people
15:339:29114:29:28:72:537:231:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:vary in their capacity to store human capital, generate research, and earn returns on knowledge to
15:340:29212:28:28:72:536:203:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:which they have access.  To store, create, or use advanced intellectual capital, a person may need
15:341:29310:28:29:72:503:175:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to be intelligent, have original ideas, or have the will to exercise human capital or develop
15:342:29403:29:0:72:538:146:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:research into useful products.  For convenience, I call this array of capacities "aptitude" and note
16:343:29541:0:28:72:454:684:12:g_d0_f1:7:g_d0_f1:that there is ample evidence that the distribution of it has a long right-hand tail.  Thus, a person7
16:344:29642:28:28:72:538:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:who has 99th percentile aptitude may generate returns that are an order of magnitude greater for a
16:345:29740:28:28:72:468:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:given investment in intellectual capital than a person with 90th percentile aptitude.
16:346:29825:28:29:108:534:600:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Estimating where a person is in the long right-hand tail of aptitude is a costly exercise.  It
16:347:29919:29:28:72:534:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:generally requires the person's own time or effort, the time and effort of an assessor who himself
16:348:30017:28:28:72:534:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:has high aptitude, and the use of infrastructure.  Furthermore, even a good estimate of aptitude is
16:349:30116:28:29:72:507:515:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:only an estimate:  we expect aptitude to be revealed over much of a person's adult life.  For
16:350:30209:29:28:72:520:486:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:instance, whether a person's contributions to knowledge are worthy of a Nobel Prize or only a
16:351:30302:28:28:72:519:458:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:solid academic post is something usually revealed after mid-life.  Similarly, whether a person
16:352:30396:28:29:72:510:430:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:will use his knowledge to create a Fortune 500 company or to conduct a very successful but
16:353:30486:29:28:72:337:401:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:largely unremarkable career is usually revealed slowly. 
16:354:30542:28:28:108:531:373:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Because aptitude varies and is revealed slowly, an individual should be risk averse when
16:355:30630:28:29:72:520:345:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:making human capital investments in himself.  If the person knows that his aptitude is at least
16:356:30725:29:28:72:536:316:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:fairly high, then the risk of such investments is heightened by the long right-hand tail of aptitude,
16:357:30826:28:28:72:520:288:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the fact that his optimal investment may be very large relative to average income, and the fact
16:358:30921:28:29:72:521:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that completely unrelated risks (a debilitating accident, for instance) may destroy his ability to
16:359:31019:29:28:72:394:231:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:exercise the advanced intellectual capital in which he has invested. 
16:360:31088:28:28:108:517:203:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The prohibition of slavery or, more prosaically, forced labor has the consequence that
16:361:31174:28:29:72:509:175:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:people cannot easily take equity positions in one another's advanced intellectual capital and
16:362:31267:29:49:72:491:146:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:thereby share risk.  Similarly, even if a bank wished to invest in a portfolio of advanced
16:363:31357:49:11:111:110:97:10:g_d0_f1:6:g_d0_f1:  "Aptitude" is not the same as IQ or any other narrow definition of ability.  It includes forms of7
16:364:31457:11:12:72:531:86:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:motivation, management and leadership skills, interpersonal skills, linguistic and rhetorical abilities, political skills,
16:365:31579:12:0:72:134:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:luck, and so on.
17:366:31633:0:28:72:532:684:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:intellectual capital (presumably by financing many persons' education and research), its inability
17:367:31731:28:28:72:536:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to take equity positions would cause it to under-invest greatly:  it could not earn more on persons
17:368:31830:28:28:72:523:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:whose returns happened to be very high than it could earn on persons whose returns were only
17:369:31922:28:29:72:506:600:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:moderate.  A bank or person who attempted to hold a diverse, advanced intellectual capital
17:370:32012:29:28:72:526:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:portfolio would also find it challenging to acquire the expertise to assess each person's aptitude
17:371:32110:28:28:72:96:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:well.
17:372:32115:28:29:108:528:515:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Finally, it is hard to keep intellectual capital--especially research--fully private.  It tends
17:373:32210:29:28:72:513:486:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to get revealed in the process of being used.  Thus, a good share of the returns to intellectual
17:374:32306:28:28:72:518:458:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:capital accrue to society, not to the people who produced it.  The returns to human capital are
17:375:32401:28:29:72:535:430:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:typically far more private but still not fully private because colleagues of a person with advanced
17:376:32500:29:28:72:431:401:12:g_d0_f1:7:g_d0_f1:human capital typically acquire some of his knowledge through spillovers.8
17:377:32574:28:28:72:194:373:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:B. The founder's problem
17:378:32598:28:29:108:516:345:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:If he is to maximize his contribution to society's intellectual capital, the founder must
17:379:32687:29:28:72:520:316:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:invest in such a way that he deals with the peculiar properties of advanced intellectual capital,
17:380:32784:28:28:72:540:288:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:described above.  In particular, he cannot add much to society's intellectual capital all by himself. 
17:381:32886:28:29:72:538:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:He needs people who can store and exercise human capital.  He also needs people who can create
17:382:32980:29:28:72:521:231:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:new knowledge.  He needs the expertise to assess which people have the highest aptitude.  He
17:383:33072:28:28:72:526:203:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:needs to combine the people with expertise and infrastructure.  His expertise and infrastructure
17:384:33168:28:29:72:496:175:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:assets must be sufficient in breadth and scale to support a portfolio of intellectual capital
17:385:33261:29:49:72:533:146:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:investments with some diversity in risks and opportunities.  Since the costs of building expertise
17:386:33359:49:11:111:110:97:10:g_d0_f1:6:g_d0_f1:  Of course, some individuals may have human capital that they use mainly for private returns and may also8
17:387:33466:11:12:72:530:86:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:produce research that earns mainly public returns.  A physician who does both clinical and research work would be
17:388:33579:12:0:72:154:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:an obvious example.
18:389:33636:0:28:72:531:684:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and infrastructure are convex in the per-period increase in amount and diversity, he will want to
18:390:33733:28:28:72:527:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:keep his investments going for some time, not make a one-off investment in intellectual capital
18:391:33828:28:28:72:220:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and then get out of the activity.
18:392:33861:28:29:108:521:600:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:In all these ways, the founder is in a position parallel to the venture capitalist.  We can
18:393:33952:29:28:72:531:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:give a name to his two types of projects:  (i) students, people who have the capacity to store and
18:394:34050:28:28:72:500:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:use human capital as alumni; (ii) researchers, people who have the capacity to invent new
18:395:34139:28:29:72:506:515:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:knowledge.  (To be clear, the founder of a university would have hundreds or thousands of
18:396:34228:29:28:72:533:486:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:projects, not two projects called students and researchers.)  High aptitude students are parallel to
18:397:34328:28:28:72:517:458:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:agents with projects because, like them, they have a unique capacity (aptitude) to acquire and
18:398:34422:28:29:72:500:430:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:exercise human capital without which the founder cannot do.  Even the most able student
18:399:34509:29:28:72:540:401:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:requires instruction and infrastructure, and his human capital pays out over a long career in which
18:400:34608:28:28:72:532:373:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:his aptitude to generate social returns with it is slowly revealed.  Even if they are able to capture
18:401:34709:28:29:72:528:345:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:all of the returns to their human capital (none are public), high aptitude students should be risk-
18:402:34808:29:28:72:523:316:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:averse about making very large investments in their own human capital and will find it hard to
18:403:34902:28:28:72:535:288:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:get external financing for such investments without being vetted by an expert.  Research projects
18:404:34999:28:29:72:522:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:are also parallel to agents except that their problem is aggravated by the more public nature of
18:405:35095:29:28:72:537:231:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:research.  A researcher has a unique capacity to invent knowledge.  He typically requires an array
18:406:35193:28:28:72:529:203:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of infrastructure and other experts to do so.  The social benefits of the knowledge he creates are
18:407:35291:28:29:72:533:175:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:likely to be revealed slowly and he will probably find it hard to capture more than small share of
18:408:35389:29:28:72:505:146:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:them.  Thus, he will under-invest and be risk-averse if asked to make large investments by
18:409:35479:28:28:72:526:118:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:himself.  Getting external financing will be stymied by others' lack of ability to assess his ideas
18:410:35578:28:0:72:504:90:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and by their (often justified) conviction that most of the returns will be public, not private.
19:411:35711:0:28:72:196:684:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:C.  The founder's solution
19:412:35737:28:28:108:511:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Since the problem is parallel to the venture capitalist's, the founder's solution should
19:413:35825:28:28:72:454:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:logically also be parallel.  In particular, he would like to be in a situation where:
19:414:35910:28:29:72:503:600:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:• He can build a foundation of experts and infrastructure useful for making investments in
19:415:36000:29:28:72:263:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:intellectual capital.  This is a university.
19:416:36044:28:28:72:511:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:• He can use the experts to assess which students and researchers have the greatest expected
19:417:36136:28:29:72:515:515:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:social returns to investments in their intellectual capital.  His threshold rate of (social) return
19:418:36235:29:28:72:515:486:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:should be based on the opportunity costs associated with his funds and the infrastructure and
19:419:36328:28:28:72:494:458:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:expertise he has built.  His threshold is embodied in a university's admissions and hiring
19:420:36418:28:29:72:123:430:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:standards. 
19:421:36429:29:28:72:517:401:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:• He can invest money, expertise, and infrastructure in researchers and students who meet his
19:422:36522:28:28:72:523:373:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:threshold.  His investment is the "tuition subsidy" or difference between the cost of a student's
19:423:36619:28:29:72:530:345:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:education and what he actually pays for it--as much as 80 percent on average in the case of very
19:424:36715:29:28:72:250:316:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:high aptitude students (Hoxby 2009).
19:425:36751:28:28:72:537:288:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:• He can demand that students who benefit from his investment contribute whatever they are able
19:426:36846:28:29:72:524:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to invest in their own human capital, to reduce the moral hazard problem.  This contribution is
19:427:36941:29:28:72:365:231:12:g_d0_f1:7:g_d0_f1:tuition, which is often need-based for high aptitude students.9
19:428:37004:28:28:72:520:203:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:• He can ensure that his experts and infrastructure will be employed over sufficient cohorts of
19:429:37099:28:29:72:288:175:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:students and researchers to justify their costs.
19:430:37147:29:60:108:539:146:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:It is on the final point that the founder runs into difficulties that the venture capitalist does
19:431:37244:60:12:111:110:86:10:g_d0_f1:6:g_d0_f1:  Because much research earns only public returns, there is no obvious parallel for a researcher's9
19:432:37343:12:0:72:515:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:contribution to reduce moral hazard--unless his research is likely to generate private returns from, say, a patent.
20:433:37496:0:28:72:508:684:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:not have.  The venture capitalist can expect to earn enough on one generation of projects to
20:434:37588:28:28:72:535:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:finance the next, thereby keeping his stock of expertise and infrastructure employed long enough
20:435:37684:28:28:72:524:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to make it worthwhile to have built them.  The founder cannot write explicit contracts with his
20:436:37779:28:29:72:537:600:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:students in which he takes equity stakes in their earnings since such contracts would entail illegal
20:437:37879:29:28:72:524:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:forms of forced labor.  Also, unlike the venture capitalist who is concerned with purely private
20:438:37975:28:28:72:523:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:returns, the founder cannot write contracts in which he gets an equity stake in public returns to
20:439:38072:28:29:72:198:515:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:research or human capital.
20:440:38098:29:28:108:524:486:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This is where the founder's solution is, depending on how one thinks about it, clever or
20:441:38186:28:28:72:356:458:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:fortuitous.  It is also where endowments become necessary.
20:442:38244:28:29:72:113:430:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Students
20:443:38252:29:28:108:532:401:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Consider what the founder would like to do with his students (research comes later).  He
20:444:38340:28:28:72:531:373:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:would like to convince them that it is their social and moral obligation to give the university the
20:445:38439:28:29:72:527:345:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:equivalent of what the venture capitalist would require from them.  This is the amount that will
20:446:38535:29:28:72:528:316:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:maximize the intellectual returns generated by his initial capital.  Because some of the students'
20:447:38633:28:28:72:527:288:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:returns will presumably be social, the obligation on them can be multifaceted.  Those who earn
20:448:38727:28:29:72:531:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:private returns on their human capital can be asked for gifts in the form of money.  Others could
20:449:38824:29:28:72:531:231:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:be asked for gifts in the form of expertise.  Others could be asked to use their political influence
20:450:38924:28:29:72:533:203:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to ensure that the university is treated well by the government.  And so on.  The founder will not
20:451:39022:29:28:72:534:174:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:couch their obligation as an obligation to provide him with returns so as to maximize the impact
20:452:39118:28:28:72:530:146:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of his initial capital.  He will instead couch it as an obligation to provide for the next generation
20:453:39219:28:29:72:308:118:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of students as they were provided for themselves.
20:454:39268:29:0:108:527:89:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:There are a variety of "soft" ways in which the founder could hope to convince students
21:455:39393:0:28:72:504:684:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that this is their obligation.  The university could use exhortation and inculcation.  It could
21:456:39488:28:28:72:536:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:develop loyalty by creating athletic teams, clubs, traditions, songs, events, and special apparel.  It
21:457:39590:28:29:72:522:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:is my belief that many of these soft methods work because the founder himself and the people
21:458:39682:29:28:72:536:599:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:whom he recruits to run the university truly believe in the obligation and take a true interest and
21:459:39780:28:29:72:288:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:pleasure in providing for the next generation.
21:460:39826:29:28:108:534:542:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Nevertheless, it will be easier to convince a student of his obligation if, when he donates,
21:461:39918:28:28:72:538:514:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:he knows that the university has tied its own hands in such a way that the gift will be worth much
21:462:40016:28:29:72:517:486:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:less if it is not actually used to invest in the human capital of future generations.  This is why
21:463:40114:29:28:72:510:457:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:endowments make sense.  Even if it has no restrictions other than that the principal must be
21:464:40206:28:28:72:533:429:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:preserved in perpetuity and spent for university activities (broadly construed), much of the value
21:465:40304:28:29:72:493:401:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of a gift to the endowment is in the future.  Therefore, a university that receives a gift as
21:466:40397:29:28:72:522:372:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:endowment has a greater incentive to exist, as a university, in the future.   It is less likely to so
21:467:40498:28:28:72:538:344:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:exist if it uses its funds in some manner that does not generate solid returns to intellectual capital.
21:468:40601:28:28:108:519:316:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:To see this, consider a university that, starting with some cohort of students, begins to
21:469:40690:28:29:72:502:288:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:instruct students in vacuous material that will not be valued by employers or society more
21:470:40780:29:28:72:499:259:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:generally.  Even if these students and their equally vacuously-educated successors feel an
21:471:40870:28:28:72:509:231:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:obligation to donate a share of their earnings to the university, their donations will be small
21:472:40965:28:29:72:507:203:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:because they do not have valuable human capital.  The university will become increasingly
21:473:41054:29:28:72:526:174:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:unable to maintain its infrastructure and expertise--losing experts to competing institutions, for
21:474:41152:28:28:72:531:146:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:instance.  Eventually, the university will find it hard to attract students because its infrastructure
21:475:41254:28:29:72:519:118:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and expertise are so depreciated, and at this point it will fold.  The larger the share of its (pre-
21:476:41354:29:0:72:537:89:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:vacuity) gifts were in the form of endowment, the faster the university will fold and more value it
22:477:41491:0:28:72:213:684:12:g_d0_f1:7:g_d0_f1:must sacrifice when it folds.  In short, by moving much of the value of a gift into the future, an10
22:478:41591:28:28:72:536:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:endowment gives a university's leaders an immediate incentive to engage in investments that can
22:479:41686:28:29:72:526:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:sustain the university.  These are necessarily investments in intellectual capital that are valued,
22:480:41785:29:28:72:497:599:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:socially if not privately.  (Below, I consider how a university might sustain investment in
22:481:41876:28:29:72:365:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:intellectual capital that earns only public, not social returns.) 
22:482:41942:29:28:108:515:542:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A simple figure illustrates the point that the university will accept gifts in the form of
22:483:42032:28:28:72:523:514:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:endowment up a point.   Line A shows how the usefulness--for the purpose of maximizing the
22:484:42122:28:29:72:533:486:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:contribution to intellectual capital--of a dollar of gift falls the larger the share of it that arrives in
22:485:42228:29:28:72:532:457:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the form of endowment.  This line necessarily slopes down simply because the timing of the use
22:486:42322:28:28:72:502:429:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of the endowment is relatively inflexible.  It will slope more steeply if there are additional
22:487:42416:28:29:72:537:401:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:restrictions on how the endowment is used.  Line B shows how total gifts increase as the share of
22:488:42513:29:28:72:532:372:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:gift dollars going into the endowment rise.  The logic of the shape of this line is described in the
22:489:42613:28:28:72:483:344:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:previous paragraph, but it is not clear whether it merely flattens or actually falls as the
22:490:42704:28:28:72:539:316:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:endowment share gets close to 100 percent.  This is not important for line C, which is the product
22:491:42802:28:29:72:513:288:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of lines A and B:  the usefulness of total gifts for contributing to intellectual capital.  Line C
22:492:42900:29:28:72:529:259:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:peaks at a point like D, and this point determines the share of gifts that the university accepts in
22:493:43000:28:134:72:192:231:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the form of endowments.
22:494:43023:134:11:114:113:97:10:g_d0_f1:6:g_d0_f1:  There are numerous colleges in the United States that have arguably suffered precisely the fate described. 10
22:495:43133:11:12:72:494:86:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:There are examples in which the curriculum truly became vacuous.  However, a more common problem is
22:496:43232:12:0:72:454:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:curriculum not having kept pace with changes in what employers and the rest of society valued. 
23:497:43365:0:28:72:130:373:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Researchers
23:498:43376:28:29:108:530:345:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Now consider researchers, the returns on whose intellectual capital are more likely to be
23:499:43465:29:28:72:517:316:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:public, not private.  Of course, the university can explicitly contract with researchers who are
23:500:43561:28:28:72:498:288:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:likely to generate private returns using university-derived expertise or infrastructure.  For
23:501:43654:28:29:72:503:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:instance, the university can share in patents.  In such cases, the university should solve the
23:502:43748:29:28:72:529:231:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:problem no differently than a venture capitalist would.  In addition, the university can oblige its
23:503:43847:28:28:72:511:203:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:researchers to devote part of their effort to instruction so that they produce human capital in
23:504:43942:28:29:72:502:175:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:students, like any other input at the university.  In this case, we are back to the problem of
23:505:44036:29:28:72:529:146:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:students, with that problem's solution of obligations and implicit contracts.  Indeed, the optimal
23:506:44134:28:28:72:506:118:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ratio of researchers' instructional to research time depends on the next part of the founder's
23:507:44228:28:0:72:114:90:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:solution.
23:508:44237:0:2:163:447:686:10:g_d0_f2:10:g_d0_f1:Figure 1:  Heuristic diagram of university's preferred endowment share
24:509:44345:2:28:108:534:684:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This is the interesting problem of maximizing the university's ability to generate research
24:510:44436:28:28:72:491:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that earns only public returns.  The founder could simply sink his investment into a few
24:511:44524:28:29:72:536:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:generations of research, but these investments would quickly peter out because the purely public
24:512:44620:29:28:72:539:599:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:returns to this research would not generate university funds for new ones.  The solution is a semi-
24:513:44719:28:29:72:539:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:implicit/semi-explicit contract--this time with external funders--that is made more credible by the
24:514:44818:29:28:72:131:542:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:endowment.
24:515:44828:28:28:108:540:514:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The founder is not the only entity interested in knowledge that is a public good.  There are
24:516:44920:28:29:72:537:486:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:other philanthropists who wish similarly to maximize their contribution to intellectual capital but
24:517:45019:29:28:72:524:457:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:who lack the wherewithal (or, perhaps more realistically, the timing) to build the expertise and
24:518:45115:28:28:72:522:429:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:infrastructure that would allow them to invest efficiently in intellectual capital.  There are also
24:519:45214:28:29:72:508:401:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:philanthropists who wish only to contribute to intellectual capital in a narrow area and who
24:520:45306:29:28:72:538:372:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:therefore could not support expertise and infrastructure assets on an efficient scale.  Finally, there
24:521:45408:28:28:72:539:344:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:is the government, which--to the extent that it maximizes social welfare--should internalize many
24:522:45505:28:28:72:362:316:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of the public returns to research as though they were private.
24:523:45567:28:29:108:528:288:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:To maximize his contribution to research that generates only public returns, the founder
24:524:45655:29:28:72:513:259:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:can use his initial funds to build expertise and infrastructure assets and to sponsor some first
24:525:45751:28:28:72:486:231:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:generation of research as a demonstration.  He can then seek outside philanthropic and
24:526:45837:28:29:72:516:203:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:government funds to support research that can use the university's existing infrastructure and
24:527:45931:29:28:72:504:174:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:expertise or that only requires the university to build infrastructure and expertise in a cost-
24:528:46026:28:28:72:530:146:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:efficient way--that is, gradually and in a manner related to existing infrastructure and expertise. 
24:529:46126:28:29:72:513:118:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This is exactly parallel to the venture capitalist's problem.  Recall, however, that the venture
24:530:46222:29:0:72:517:89:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:capitalist could credibly vouch for a project because he would have his own contract with the
25:531:46353:0:28:72:507:684:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:agent and would stand to lose also if his equity share were worthless.  It is not so easy for a
25:532:46448:28:28:72:505:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:university to credibly vouch for research that is projected to earn purely public returns.  Of
25:533:46542:28:28:72:526:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:course, the provisions of a grant can ensure that, as a formal matter, every dollar is spent as the
25:534:46641:28:29:72:535:600:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:funder intends, but an outside funder should have more confidence in the research if the founder,
25:535:46738:29:28:72:358:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:with his expertise, has also put his own investment at stake.
25:536:46799:28:28:108:527:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This is where it will help to encourage some share of gifts for research to be in the form
25:537:46889:28:29:72:536:515:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of endowment.  It will be easier to convince outside funders that their money will be used for the
25:538:46987:29:28:72:512:486:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:intended research if the university has tied its own hands by making some research gifts less
25:539:47080:28:28:72:519:458:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:useful if the university does not, in fact, build and maintain infrastructure and expertise in the
25:540:47178:28:29:72:524:430:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:area in question over a long period.  That is, the benefit of having some gifts for research go to
25:541:47276:29:28:72:507:401:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the endowment--as opposed to current use--is that the university thereby increases the total
25:542:47368:28:28:72:536:373:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:outside funds (including government funds) for research.  This benefit must be traded-off against
25:543:47465:28:29:72:371:345:12:g_d0_f1:7:g_d0_f1:the costs of the restrictions imposed by the endowment rules.11
25:544:47528:29:28:108:538:316:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:In short, maximizing his contribution to intellectual capital through research should cause
25:545:47619:28:28:72:525:288:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the founder to solicit an optimal share of research-related gifts in the form of endowment.  The
25:546:47715:28:29:72:485:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:implied figure would parallel to that for student gifts in form, although--of course--the
25:547:47804:29:28:72:534:231:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:parameters of the relevant curves would differ depending on the inferences outside funders draw
25:548:47899:28:106:72:345:203:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:from the university's restricting itself via the endowment.
25:549:47958:106:11:114:113:97:10:g_d0_f1:6:g_d0_f1:  Interestingly, this is an argument for tenure of researchers that is quite independent of other arguments11
25:550:48067:11:12:72:506:86:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:for and against.  If the university wants to increase the credibility of its commitment to research in some area,
25:551:48180:12:0:72:510:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:tenuring researchers in that area is an effective way to tie its own hands to supporting that area for some time. 
26:552:48332:0:28:217:394:684:12:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:IV.  A PORTRAIT OF THE UNIVERSITY
26:553:48363:28:28:108:535:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The university's problem, as presented in the previous section, is so abstract that it can be
26:554:48456:28:28:72:535:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:hard to see how it matches the universities that we know from our own experience.  What would
26:555:48549:28:29:72:521:600:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:this university, which maximizes its contribution to society's intellectual capital by acting as a
26:556:48647:29:28:72:279:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:social venture capitalist, actually look like?
26:557:48693:28:28:108:519:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The instigating financial capital of the universities' founders--who undoubtedly would
26:558:48779:28:29:72:531:515:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:have been less prescient that the fictional founder--would be unimportant, having long ago been
26:559:48874:29:28:72:510:486:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:dwarfed or replaced by the gifts of former students complying with their implicit contracts. 
26:560:48967:28:28:72:539:458:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Some alumni gifts would go to endowment and some to current use.  The ratio would be a (surely
26:561:49061:28:29:72:534:430:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:not explicit) function of the degree to which the endowment nature of gifts increased the amount
26:562:49157:29:28:72:519:401:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of gifts.  Alumni who earned little (perhaps because they worked in public service) would not
26:563:49250:28:28:72:499:373:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:give or would give in some non-monetary form:  time, expertise, and so on.  Above some
26:564:49336:28:29:72:515:345:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:earnings threshold, alumni would tend to give a share of their lifetime returns that was either
26:565:49431:29:28:72:513:316:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:steady or increasing in the scale of those returns.  Thus, if the distribution of lifetime returns
26:566:49529:28:29:72:534:288:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:among alumni had a long right-hand tail, so would the distribution of donations within a cohort. 
26:567:49626:29:28:72:504:259:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:(Note the word returns, as opposed to earnings or wealth.  A alum who was born rich, for
26:568:49714:28:28:72:538:231:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:instance, might have modest returns on the investment that the university made in him, even if he
26:569:49811:28:29:72:164:203:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:had high earnings.)
26:570:49830:29:28:108:540:174:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Second, research would be supported by a few means.  The university would have venture
26:571:49916:28:28:72:523:146:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:capital-like contracts with its researchers who use its assets to produce patentable or otherwise
26:572:50013:28:29:72:538:118:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:private return-generating research.  Faculty time would often be split between instruction (human
26:573:50110:29:0:72:533:89:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:capital production) and research since the former activity would provide reliable returns through
27:574:50245:0:28:72:494:684:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:students.  Finally, research that generated popular public goods would be supported by a
27:575:50333:28:28:72:524:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:combination of the university's assets (infrastructure and experts) and outside funders' money. 
27:576:50429:28:28:72:527:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Some gifts for research would be in the form of endowment, with the ratio again being dictated
27:577:50523:28:29:72:520:600:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:by the degree to which the endowment nature of funds increased the amount of outside funds.
27:578:50614:29:28:108:532:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The infrastructure and expertise of the university would continually, gradually drift from
27:579:50704:28:28:72:523:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the areas that earned high social returns in the past to areas that were likely to earn them in the
27:580:50803:28:29:72:535:515:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:future.  This would not necessarily be intentional.  Rather, it would be an organic response to the
27:581:50902:29:28:72:499:486:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:project (student and research) opportunities that arose.  For instance, the university might
27:582:50994:28:28:72:534:458:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:routinely accept grants that required it to add incrementally to infrastructure and experts, and the
27:583:51094:28:29:72:516:430:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:gradual piling up of these increments would slowly change the nature of these key university
27:584:51186:29:28:72:103:401:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:assets.
27:585:51193:28:28:108:522:373:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The higher aptitude the students at a university, the greater would be the investment in
27:586:51281:28:29:72:519:345:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:their education.  Students would be asked to pay for part of the investment, according to their
27:587:51376:29:28:72:491:316:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ability to do so, to reduce their moral hazard.  Unless the highest aptitude students were
27:588:51466:28:28:72:540:288:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:systematically much more able to pay than their slightly lower aptitude peers (and so on down the
27:589:51563:28:29:72:498:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:aptitude spectrum), the universities that enrolled the highest aptitude students would also
27:590:51654:29:28:72:518:231:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:subsidize the current cost of their education the most.  These same universities would thus be
27:591:51748:28:28:72:506:203:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:most reliant on inculcating an sense of obligation to the next generation of students and on
27:592:51840:28:29:72:522:175:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:supporting the credibility of their implicit contracts through thoughtful use of the endowment.
27:593:51935:29:28:108:524:146:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A few caveats are in order here.  First, it seems unlikely that a university could create a
27:594:52026:28:28:72:524:118:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:sense of loyalty or obligation if it invested substantially different amounts in different students
27:595:52125:28:0:72:507:90:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:(as a matter of planning, not of accident).  Thus, universities are likely to be fundamentally
28:596:52257:0:28:72:359:684:12:g_d0_f1:7:g_d0_f1:constrained in how heterogeneous their admissions can be.  Second, a alum's sense of12
28:597:52343:28:28:72:524:656:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:obligation may be reduced if the next generation of students looks too dissimilar from his own
28:598:52437:28:28:72:522:628:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:cohort.  Thus, the university may be constrained to alter the character of its student population
28:599:52534:28:29:72:528:600:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:gradually.  Third, it may be easier to instill a sense of obligation in a student if he is surrounded
28:600:52635:29:28:72:512:571:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:by a critical share of students who already have it.  Thus, a university may find it difficult to
28:601:52732:28:28:72:522:543:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:move wholesale into new campuses at which none of the students who enroll already have the
28:602:52822:28:29:72:523:515:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:tradition of obligation.  Fourth, nothing that has been said constrains a university to contribute
28:603:52920:29:29:72:527:486:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:intellectual capital through both human capital and research.  Indeed, very selective liberal arts
28:604:53018:29:28:72:474:457:12:g_d0_f1:7:g_d0_f1:colleges fit the university model except that the research components do not apply.13
28:605:53103:28:28:108:518:429:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:It is important to observe that the university modeled here might make investments in
28:606:53188:28:29:72:506:401:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:intellectual capital that simply do not get made in countries in which no one has solved the
28:607:53280:29:28:72:520:372:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:founder's problem in the founder's way.  That is, there is no reason to think that every country
28:608:53376:28:28:72:520:344:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:will develop very selective private universities that make investments in human capital on the
28:609:53470:28:28:72:531:316:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:same per-person scale as America's top private universities do.  If some mechanism that mimics
28:610:53564:28:29:72:533:288:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the founder's solution does not arise, some intellectual capital investments will probably just not
28:611:53663:29:28:72:509:259:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:be made because conventional financing would not work.  Of course, in theory, it would be
28:612:53752:28:28:72:537:231:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:possible for a government to mimic the founder's solution.  However, governments have political
28:613:53847:28:47:72:276:203:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:constraints that private universities do not.
28:614:53892:47:11:114:113:156:10:g_d0_f1:6:g_d0_f1:  That is, a university might find two students who have the same rate of return on human capital12
28:615:53991:11:12:72:535:145:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:investments but whose optimal size of investments differed substantially.  If the university were constrained to make
28:616:54108:12:12:72:528:133:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:similar investments in all of its students, it could not admit both students even if both students could in fact benefit
28:617:54228:12:24:72:201:121:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:from the same university assets. 
28:618:54261:24:11:114:113:97:10:g_d0_f1:6:g_d0_f1:  A handful of all-research universities appear to be sustainable (Rockefeller University, for instance), but13
28:619:54372:11:12:72:524:86:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:they are narrowly focused.  The fact that many universities combine human capital creation and research suggests
28:620:54484:12:0:72:297:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:that the activities enjoy substantial production synergies.
29:621:54581:0:28:182:429:657:12:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:V.  IMPLICATIONS FOR ENDOWMENT MANAGEMENT
29:622:54621:28:28:108:539:629:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:It will be observed that the model implies that university endowments came into being for
29:623:54710:28:29:72:485:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:fairly simple reasons.  If the object of the university is to maximize its contributions to
29:624:54801:29:28:72:487:572:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:intellectual capital, its social venture capital activities are its reason for existence.  The
29:625:54895:28:28:72:533:544:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:endowment arises simply because returns must enter an investment pool before being reinvested
29:626:54988:28:29:72:519:516:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and the university is able to make greater investments in intellectual capital if it accepts some
29:627:55085:29:28:72:537:487:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:returns (and some gifts to support research) in the form of endowment.  Thus, the main thing that
29:628:55182:28:28:72:514:459:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:is true of the endowment is the obvious thing:  it represents a series of commitments that the
29:629:55276:28:29:72:509:431:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:university has made to invest funds in a set of intellectual capital projects.  Importantly, the
29:630:55372:29:28:72:518:402:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:endowment has no independent purpose or objective of its own.  This is why it should not be
29:631:55463:28:29:72:516:374:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:possible to define an objective for the endowment that is independent of the other side of the
29:632:55557:29:28:72:323:345:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:university's portfolio--the social venture capital side.
29:633:55613:28:28:72:366:317:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:V.A.  The University's Investment Problem, the Basic Version
29:634:55673:28:29:108:535:289:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Consider a university that is deciding what to do with its available investment pool.  This
29:635:55764:29:28:72:532:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:pool consists of all current use funds, all endowment income, and other funds that the university
29:636:55861:28:28:72:506:232:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:could legally use, including various forms of decapitalization and even borrowing.  (In this
29:637:55953:28:29:72:535:204:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:subsection, I ignore specific restrictions on the use of funds but will return to this problem.)  The
29:638:56054:29:28:72:528:175:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:university's problem is fairly straightforward to describe, though not straightforward to solve in
29:639:56152:28:28:72:112:147:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:practice.
29:640:56161:28:29:108:530:119:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The university knows the current set of intellectual capital projects that it could pursue--
29:641:56253:29:0:72:530:90:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that is, all of the students and research in which it could potentially invest in the current period. 
30:642:56393:0:29:72:534:686:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Let us suppose it has rational expectations about the intellectual capital projects that will arise in
30:643:56495:29:28:72:528:657:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:each future period.  For each project, current or future, the university can assign probabilities to
30:644:56595:28:28:72:536:629:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:each possible scenario of expenses and returns.  That is, the university can reduce each project to
30:645:56694:28:29:72:536:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the market value and investment risk characteristics it would have if it were a traded asset:  it has
30:646:56795:29:28:72:512:572:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:a certain expected return, variation around that expected return, and correlations between its
30:647:56889:28:28:72:534:544:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:return and those of other projects owing to exogenous events.  For instance, some projects might
30:648:56985:28:29:72:495:516:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:be sensitive to the price of oil.  Other projects might be sensitive to which party controls
30:649:57077:29:28:72:119:487:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Congress.
30:650:57086:28:28:108:496:459:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Suppose, for a moment, that projects did not need to use the assets specific to the
30:651:57169:28:29:72:505:431:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:university--its infrastructure and expertise--that have the convex adjustment costs we have
30:652:57260:29:28:72:515:402:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:emphasized.  That is, suppose that projects only required inputs (in addition to the student or
30:653:57355:28:28:72:503:374:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:researcher himself) that could bought at a world market price.  Then, the projects could be
30:654:57446:28:29:72:523:346:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:evaluated fairly independently.  The university would compute the properties of each potential
30:655:57540:29:28:72:532:317:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:project as an asset and find the optimal path of current and future portfolios, knowing that funds
30:656:57638:28:28:72:516:289:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:would be available in each future period for projects in one of three ways:  (i) there would be
30:657:57733:28:29:72:535:261:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:returns generated by the endowment principal, (ii) there would be funds if some money currently
30:658:57828:29:28:72:493:232:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:in the investment pool (such as current endowment returns) were not invested in current
30:659:57915:28:28:72:536:204:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:intellectual capital projects but "saved" for future projects by being invested in financial markets,
30:660:58016:28:29:72:507:176:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:(iii) there would be returns from past intellectual capital projects or cash flow from outside
30:661:58110:29:28:72:524:147:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:funders who were committed to research projects.  Then, the procedure for finding the optimal
30:662:58203:28:29:72:522:119:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f1:financial market portfolio would be what Merton outlines--except that his solution is framed
30:663:58295:29:0:72:531:90:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:quite differently because he does not think of projects/assets with expected investments flowing
31:664:58429:0:29:72:530:686:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:in and returns flowing out.  He thinks of cash flows, including expenses, which he models as an
31:665:58524:29:28:72:509:657:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:exogenous, dynamic, stochastic process.  However, for any given path of current and future
31:666:58614:28:28:72:529:629:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:intellectual capital projects, there is a reduced-form that can be expressed purely as cash flows. 
31:667:58713:28:29:72:533:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Thus, Merton's fundamental solution method carries over, although of course the solution would
31:668:58807:29:28:72:497:572:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:look different with cash flows that are more realistic than the processes he actually uses. 
31:669:58899:28:28:72:363:544:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Moreover, the insights he derives carry over as well, namely:
31:670:58960:28:29:72:526:516:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:• The spending rate on the endowment falls out of the optimization process and depends on the
31:671:59053:29:28:72:530:487:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:social venture capital side of the portfolio.  In fact, no rule that is independent of the intellectual
31:672:59156:28:28:72:530:459:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:capital side of the portfolio makes sense.  This excludes simple rules such as "4.5 percent of the
31:673:59254:28:29:72:392:431:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:last three years' rolling average of total endowment market value." 
31:674:59321:29:28:72:527:402:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:• The optimal portfolio allocation for the endowment will be such that the university's financial
31:675:59418:28:28:72:537:374:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:assets have risks and returns that offset those of the university's intellectual capital portfolio.  For
31:676:59522:28:29:72:519:346:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:instance, if the university's intellectual capital is disproportionately in projects that depend on
31:677:59621:29:28:72:537:317:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:demand for computer software, its financial assets ought to diversify its total portfolio away from
31:678:59720:28:28:72:138:289:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that industry. 
31:679:59735:28:29:72:531:261:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:• An important function of endowment investments is to hedge against unanticipated changes in
31:680:59828:29:28:72:516:232:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the costs of university activities.  For instance, a university might invest some of its financial
31:681:59926:28:28:72:433:204:12:g_d0_f1:7:g_d0_f1:portfolio in real estate near campus that could be used for faculty housing.14

31:683:60057:29:28:108:520:147:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:In fact, a university's pool of available investment funds is not unrestricted as to uses. 
31:684:60148:28:45:72:529:119:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Sizeable parts of it are restricted, and returns and cash flows associated with current intellectual
31:685:60248:45:0:114:114:74:10:g_d0_f1:6:g_d0_f1:  This is an example drawn from Merton (1993).14
32:686:60334:0:29:72:497:686:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:capital projects are often restricted as well.   Flows from outside funders are often highly
32:687:60426:29:28:72:390:657:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:restricted, but alumni often place restrictions on their gifts as well.
32:688:60497:28:28:108:526:629:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Thus, instead of solving a single investment problem as described above, the university
32:689:60584:28:29:72:453:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:ought instead to solve a series of investment problems, sequentially, as follows:
32:690:60665:29:28:72:536:572:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:• Begin with the most restricted investment pools and the potential projects that qualify for them.
32:691:60764:28:28:72:535:544:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Solve for the optimal current and future portfolio of these projects.  Remove the projects that get
32:692:60863:28:29:72:538:516:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:funded from consideration.  Remove the funds that are invested in these projects from the pool of
32:693:60960:29:28:72:504:487:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that could be invested in the financial markets instead of the intellectual capital side of the
32:694:61055:28:29:72:117:459:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:portfolio.
32:695:61065:29:28:72:495:430:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f2:• Proceed to the next most restricted investment pools and consider all of the remaining
32:696:61153:28:28:72:529:402:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:potential projects that qualify for them.  Again, solve and then remove the relevant projects and
32:697:61250:28:29:72:230:374:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:funds from further consideration.
32:698:61283:29:28:72:503:345:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:• Continue sequentially until the unrestricted investment pool is reached, at which time all
32:699:61375:28:28:72:527:317:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:remaining potential projects are considered.  Solve the problem as described in the last section,
32:700:61472:28:29:72:507:289:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:noting that all investment pool funds that were not committed (that is, those from all of the
32:701:61565:29:28:72:510:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:restricted pools as well as those from the unrestricted pool, if any) should be invested in the
32:702:61660:28:28:72:498:232:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:financial market side of the portfolio to attain goals like diversification and cost hedging.
32:703:61753:28:29:108:536:204:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Although the sequential process may appear at first to be onerous, in fact it should reduce
32:704:61844:29:28:72:529:175:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the scale of the problem at the final stages greatly because the university will need to consider a
32:705:61943:28:0:72:354:147:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:smaller number of potential projects for unrestricted funds.
33:706:62041:0:29:72:355:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:V.C.  Adding Adjustment Costs to the University's Problem
33:707:62098:29:28:108:516:657:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Unfortunately, if we make the problem more realistic by allowing for convex costs of
33:708:62182:28:28:72:532:629:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:adjusting the university's expertise and infrastructure, the problem could go from being tractable
33:709:62280:28:29:72:532:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:(though certainly demanding) to intractable.  I first describe the problem broadly, at which point
33:710:62378:29:28:72:494:572:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:it should appear intractable, and then discuss why it might be fairly tractable in practice.
33:711:62470:28:28:108:509:544:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Suppose that the university fully understands the costs of adjusting its expertise and
33:712:62556:28:29:72:146:516:12:g_d0_f1:7:g_d0_f1:infrastructure.  Then, when it considers every potential intellectual capital project, it must15
33:713:62652:29:28:72:498:487:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:consider the costs of adjusting its expertise and infrastructure to serve the project.  Those
33:714:62745:28:28:72:480:459:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:adjustment costs will, in turn, depend on which other projects are being implemented
33:715:62829:28:29:72:524:431:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:concurrently and which projects were done in the past.  If we consider all of the ways in which
33:716:62924:29:28:72:507:402:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:projects' use of expertise and infrastructure could interact, the number of portfolios that we
33:717:63018:28:28:72:486:374:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:should consider would grow explosively large.  That is, the state space would explode.
33:718:63104:28:29:108:502:346:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:To make this concrete, suppose that the same faculty member can either engage in
33:719:63184:29:28:72:491:317:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:important instruction (an array of students) or lead an important research project.  If the
33:720:63275:28:28:72:538:289:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:university considers the research project first, it might allocate her to that project and invest in it. 
33:721:63380:28:29:72:497:261:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:It might then find that the instruction was a poor investment because it would require the
33:722:63470:29:28:72:506:232:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:university to hire someone else just like her, and the cost of making this hire might be very
33:723:63563:28:28:72:535:204:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:expensive.  If the university had considered the same projects in the other order (instruction first,
33:724:63664:28:29:72:513:176:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:research second), it might have come to a different conclusion--for instance, investing in the
33:725:63758:29:61:72:532:147:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:instruction but not the research.  Moreover, although the difference in these two decisions might
33:726:63855:61:12:114:113:86:10:g_d0_f1:6:g_d0_f1:  Of course, it might not understand its adjustment costs fully, but allowing for this would merely add a15
33:727:63962:12:0:72:233:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:layer of difficulty without adding clarity.
34:728:64043:0:29:72:526:686:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:seem small, they would not be because whichever project gets done would not only occupy the
34:729:64134:29:28:72:513:657:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:faculty member's time but would also absorb some other infrastructure and expertise--which
34:730:64224:28:28:72:516:629:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:would have domino effects on other projects.   These other affected projects would affect yet
34:731:64317:28:29:72:192:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:more projects, and so on.
34:732:64342:29:28:108:535:572:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:For another example, consider a university that foresees that some area of research that is
34:733:64433:28:28:72:509:544:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:not productive now will possibly be highly productive in twenty years--if the university has
34:734:64525:28:29:72:500:516:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:certain expertise and infrastructure by then.   Then, the university must consider all of the
34:735:64618:29:28:72:143:487:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:possible paths:
34:736:64633:28:28:72:526:459:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:• starting projects now that are unproductive but that build some infrastructure and expertise in
34:737:64730:28:29:72:500:431:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the relevant areas.  This will make related future projects more attractive, leading to more
34:738:64822:29:28:72:260:402:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:infrastructure and expertise being built;
34:739:64863:28:28:72:513:374:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:• starting projects at some intermediate time (10 years, say) and incurring greater adjustment
34:740:64957:28:29:72:539:346:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:costs then, in the hope that the 10-year-out projects are sufficiently productive to justify the costs,
34:741:65060:29:28:72:508:317:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:especially when the 20-year-out projects' dependence on that infrastructure and expertise is
34:742:65152:28:28:72:126:289:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:considered;
34:743:65163:28:29:72:522:261:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:• waiting for twenty years to start the relevant projects and incurring massive adjustment costs
34:744:65259:29:28:72:96:232:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:then.
34:745:65264:28:28:72:532:204:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Each of these paths will have domino effects on other potential projects that overlap in time and
34:746:65361:28:29:72:312:176:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:use of the university's infrastructure and expertise.
34:747:65414:29:28:108:526:147:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Thus, with adjustment costs, the investment portfolios that should be considered would
34:748:65500:28:28:72:541:119:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:appear to be endless in number.  I would argue, however, that the situation is not so dire because: 
34:749:65600:28:0:72:521:91:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:(i) many of tomorrow's projects are extremely similar to today's projects so that the number of
35:750:65733:0:29:72:519:686:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:future contingencies is much smaller than it appears, and (ii) although universities' per-period
35:751:65829:29:28:72:513:657:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:adjustment costs at the extensive margin are large and highly convex, its adjustment costs at
35:752:65922:28:28:72:206:629:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:intensive margins are small.
35:753:65950:28:29:108:535:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The first of these points is easy to see:  next year's cohort of potential students is so much
35:754:66044:29:28:72:504:572:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:like this year's cohort of potential students that they are nearly interchangeable.  Thus, it is
35:755:66140:28:29:72:534:544:12:g_d0_f2:12:g_d0_f1:possible that a biology course developed for this year's cohort of students (because it was a good
35:756:66238:29:28:72:512:515:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:investment in them) might be a bad investment for next year's cohort of students.  However,
35:757:66329:28:28:72:539:487:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:possible is not likely.  Similarly, a good share of the "new" research ideas that arise each year are,
35:758:66431:28:29:72:479:459:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:in fact, very closely related to the "old" research ideas that arose in the previous year.
35:759:66521:29:28:108:527:430:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The second of these points--extensive versus intensive margin adjustment costs--means
35:760:66606:28:28:72:532:402:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that it is costly for universities quickly to acquire expertise and infrastructure that forces them to
35:761:66708:28:29:72:526:374:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:grow (in size or area of expertise) but not costly for universities to transform existing expertise
35:762:66807:29:28:72:504:345:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and infrastructure among uses that are already in their project portfolios.  For instance, if a
35:763:66902:28:28:72:537:317:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:university decided to double the size of its entering class overnight, this would entail tremendous
35:764:67001:28:29:72:515:289:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:adjustment costs owing to the need to build student housing, increase faculty, and so on very
35:765:67094:29:28:72:494:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:quickly.  In contrast, if a university decided to stop admitting classes that were one-third
35:766:67186:28:28:72:526:232:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:humanities majors, one-third sciences, and one-third social sciences and start admitting classes
35:767:67282:28:29:72:518:204:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:that were two-thirds humanities, one-sixth sciences, and one-sixth social sciences, this would
35:768:67376:29:28:72:522:175:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:generate costs but they would not be nearly so dramatic.  Some libraries, classrooms, housing,
35:769:67470:28:28:72:533:147:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:administrators, student support staff, and so on would flow fairly easily from, say, social science
35:770:67569:28:29:72:539:119:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to humanities use.  Thus, the university should treat as similar various project portfolios that have
35:771:67670:29:0:72:501:90:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the same implications for the extensive margins of adjustment, even if they have different
36:772:67798:0:29:72:325:686:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:implications for the intensive margins of adjustment.
36:773:67851:29:28:108:536:657:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:In short, including adjustment costs in the university's investment problem does make the
36:774:67940:28:28:72:519:629:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:problem more difficult, but perhaps not absolutely intractable.  A practical person solving the
36:775:68035:28:29:72:532:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:university's investment problem might do well to focus only on the adjustment cost implications
36:776:68130:29:28:72:519:572:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:of (i) new projects that are very unlike existing projects and (ii) projects that involve building
36:777:68228:28:57:72:367:544:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:substantial expertise or infrastructure at the extensive margin.
36:778:68292:57:28:261:350:487:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:VI. CONCLUSIONS 
36:779:68306:28:28:108:531:459:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:The proposed, positive model of the university has implications for numerous questions,
36:780:68393:28:29:72:524:431:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:and many of the more abstract questions have already been addressed.  For instance, section V
36:781:68486:29:28:72:513:402:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:described how the spending rule--which probably should be called a "function" rather than a
36:782:68577:28:28:72:492:374:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:"rule"--should be derived.  It also described how optimal portfolio allocations should be
36:783:68666:28:29:72:517:346:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:determined--on both the intellectual capital and the financial capital side.  But these answers,
36:784:68762:29:28:72:527:317:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:which include the insights first derived by Merton, are very abstract.  It may therefore be useful
36:785:68860:28:28:72:316:289:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to answer a few, less abstract but related questions.
36:786:68913:28:29:72:516:261:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:VI.A.  What should a university do if, for exogenous reasons, its financial market portfolio is
36:787:69008:29:28:72:299:232:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:temporarily earning a very high rate of return?
36:788:69055:28:28:108:535:204:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This is the circumstance in which a university thinks about keeping funds in the financial
36:789:69145:28:29:72:525:176:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:market portfolio that might, in an ordinary period, be invested in the intellectual capital side of
36:790:69244:29:28:72:525:147:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:the portfolio.  The logic is that the university can make so much money on financial assets that
36:791:69340:28:28:72:521:119:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:reducing its current intellectual capital investments makes sense:  it will be enabled thereby to
36:792:69437:28:0:72:534:91:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:increase future intellectual capital investments by so much that the university's total contribution
37:793:69575:0:29:72:248:686:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to world intellectual capital is larger.
37:794:69615:29:28:108:503:657:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This logic is, indeed, what falls out of the model so the thought is correct.  Current
37:795:69701:28:28:72:503:629:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:intellectual capital projects essentially face a higher hurdle rate.  However, the university's
37:796:69796:28:29:72:499:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:managers should take account of the fact that, if they restrict or reduce intellectual capital
37:797:69890:29:28:72:519:572:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:projects now, they will face even higher adjustment costs of implementing intellectual capital
37:798:69984:28:28:72:522:544:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:projects in the future, when the period of remarkable financial returns is over and they need to
37:799:70080:28:29:72:440:516:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:start making intellectual capital investments at a higher rate than ever before.
37:800:70160:29:28:108:517:487:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A related question that often occurs to potential donors is whether they should donate
37:801:70246:28:29:72:509:459:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:now or later--because they believe that their personal rate of return will be high in the near
37:802:70340:29:28:72:523:430:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:future, relative to the university's.  Of course, potential donors are not always correct that their
37:803:70440:28:28:72:535:402:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:personal rate of return will be higher than the university's.  But, even if they are, potential donors
37:804:70542:28:29:72:511:374:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:almost surely do not take account of how they affect adjustment costs when they give in the
37:805:70633:29:28:72:537:345:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:future instead of now.  This is problematic.  Thus, universities should encourage potential donors
37:806:70731:28:28:72:500:317:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to give soon unless their personal rate of return is much higher than that of the university.
37:807:70824:28:29:72:528:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:VI.A.  What should a university do if, for exogenous reasons, considerable parts of its financial
37:808:70921:29:28:72:472:260:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:market portfolio are underwater and cannot be liquidated except at very high cost?
37:809:71003:28:28:108:511:232:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This is another circumstance in which a university thinks about keeping funds in the
37:810:71087:28:29:72:534:204:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:financial market portfolio that might, in an ordinary period, be invested in the intellectual capital
37:811:71188:29:28:72:484:175:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:side of the portfolio.  The logic is that it is very expensive, in terms of foregone future
37:812:71279:28:28:72:518:147:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:intellectual capital, to invest in intellectual capital now because the cost of funds is the rate at
37:813:71379:28:29:72:230:119:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:which the institution can borrow.
37:814:71412:29:0:108:500:90:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:This logic is, indeed, what falls out of the model so the thought is correct:  current
38:815:71536:0:29:72:514:686:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:intellectual capital projects do face a higher hurdle rate.  However, the university's managers
38:816:71631:29:28:72:530:657:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:should again take account of the fact that, if they shed infrastructure or expertise now, they may
38:817:71729:28:28:72:531:629:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:face high costs of re-acquiring it in the future.  This is an argument for universities developing a
38:818:71829:28:29:72:497:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:clear understanding of their adjustment costs, especially those that occur after downward
38:819:71918:29:28:72:501:572:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:adjustments in infrastructure and expertise (since these are not common).  In addition, the
38:820:72009:28:28:72:500:544:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:university may wish to shed expenses that are not associated with assets that have convex
38:821:72098:28:29:72:425:516:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:adjustment costs--certain staff who have fairly generic skills, for instance.
38:822:72175:29:28:72:533:487:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:VI.C.  What should a university do if its financial market portfolio seems always to be earning a
38:823:72272:28:28:72:418:459:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:substantially higher rate of return than its intellectual capital portfolio?
38:824:72348:28:29:108:533:431:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Because the universities do not actually attempt to compute the value of their intellectual
38:825:72439:29:28:72:537:402:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:capital projects as assets, it is quite possible that this question only appears to be common.  Thus,
38:826:72540:28:28:72:527:374:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:one response to this question is that it should not be answered until the university has made the
38:827:72637:28:29:72:306:346:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:calculations to show that it is, in fact, a question.
38:828:72690:29:28:108:505:317:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:However, assuming that it is a legitimate question, the answer is quite possibly "do
38:829:72774:28:28:72:519:289:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:nothing."  The funds given to universities are there for the purpose of investing in intellectual
38:830:72871:28:29:72:534:261:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:capital, not running a financial business on the side.  Thus, the only legitimate, alternative use of
38:831:72972:29:28:72:525:232:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:current investment funds is later investments in intellectual capital.  It is quite possible that the
38:832:73073:28:28:72:408:204:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:intellectual capital side of the portfolio will always earn lower returns.
38:833:73147:28:29:108:525:176:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:We can be more specific, however.  The university should divide its intellectual capital
38:834:73235:29:28:72:495:147:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:investments into those with and those without related financial assets.  Consider first the
38:835:73326:28:28:72:512:119:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:intellectual capital projects that should be related to financial market assets.  For instance, if
38:836:73424:28:0:72:540:91:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:some firms are making tremendous profits, why are not some of the university's alumni leaders of
39:837:73558:0:29:72:528:686:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:or investors in these firms?  If some inventors/entrepreneurs are making great profits, why does
39:838:73654:29:28:72:521:657:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:not the university have a stake in them, either through a patent or through having educated the
39:839:73749:28:28:72:509:629:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:inventors?  Perhaps the university trains future managers and investors poorly.  Perhaps the
39:840:73841:28:29:72:513:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:university's research in areas that generate private profits is not conducted well.  Perhaps the
39:841:73937:29:28:72:535:572:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:university is not pursuing patents in which it has a legitimate stake.  Perhaps the university is not
39:842:74038:28:28:72:450:544:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:succeeding in convincing its students of their obligation to the next generation.
39:843:74119:28:29:108:496:516:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Now consider the intellectual capital investments that have no or scarcely related
39:844:74201:29:28:72:526:487:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:financial assets.  The lack of related financial assets is prima facie evidence that the returns are
39:845:74301:28:28:72:534:459:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:largely public.  However, even these investments can be subdivided.  For some, external funders
39:846:74396:28:29:72:538:431:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:are in as good a position as university experts to evaluate the social return to the project--curing a
39:847:74498:29:28:72:520:402:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:disease that affects a population of poor people, say.  For other projects, external funders may
39:848:74594:28:28:72:520:374:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:lack the expertise or political backing to evaluate the social return to the project--for instance,
39:849:74693:28:29:72:510:346:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:moving the frontier in an abstruse area of math or deciphering a papyrus that contains a lost
39:850:74786:29:28:72:523:317:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Greek tragedy.  If external funders are not funding a public returns-producing project that they
39:851:74882:28:28:72:519:289:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:can evaluate, the university ought to improve its communications with them or reconsider the
39:852:74974:28:29:72:497:261:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:public value of the project.  However, if the only people expert enough to understand the
39:853:75063:29:28:72:527:232:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:project's public value are experts who dwell in universities, then the university can do no better
39:854:75161:28:118:72:434:204:12:g_d0_f1:7:g_d0_f1:than consulting its own understanding and that experts at peer institutions.16
39:855:75239:118:12:114:113:86:10:g_d0_f1:6:g_d0_f1:  In the long run, the universities should perhaps educate more people to understand the public value of16
39:856:75345:12:0:72:197:74:10:g_d0_f1:10:g_d0_f1:projects of the type in question.
40:857:75416:0:29:72:526:686:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:VI.D.  What should a university do if its financial market portfolio seems always to be growing
40:858:75511:29:28:72:394:657:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:as a share of its total (financial plus intellectual capital) portfolio?
40:859:75583:28:28:108:493:629:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Again, because universities do not actually attempt to compute the value of their
40:860:75664:28:29:72:531:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:intellectual capital projects as assets, it is quite possible that this question is wrongheaded.  This
40:861:75766:29:28:72:432:572:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:is another argument for making the calculations, even if they are imperfect.
40:862:75842:28:28:108:513:544:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Assuming that the question is not wrongheaded, however, the model implies that the
40:863:75924:28:29:72:523:516:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:financial side should only grow persistently as a share of the total portfolio if (i) the returns on
40:864:76024:29:28:72:509:487:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:future intellectual capital projects are substantially higher than those of today's intellectual
40:865:76120:28:29:72:529:459:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:capital projects and (ii) adjustment costs are such that when those future days arrive, the cost of
40:866:76219:29:28:72:490:430:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:suddenly needing to provide infrastructure and expertise to them will not be exorbitant.
40:867:76307:28:28:108:523:402:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:Since circumstances (i) and (ii) probably do not often arise in conjunction, a university
40:868:76396:28:29:72:506:374:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:should examine itself if its financial market portfolio's share of its total portfolio rises very
40:869:76493:29:28:72:502:345:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:persistently.  The likely answer is that the university is not solving its investment problem
40:870:76586:28:28:72:117:317:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:correctly.
40:871:76596:28:29:72:162:289:12:g_d0_f3:12:g_d0_f3:VI.E.  Key Lessons
40:872:76614:29:28:108:525:260:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:A few key lessons should now be evident.  First, universities should actively attempt to
40:873:76702:28:28:72:513:232:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:compute the values in their intellectual capital portfolios.  This may be difficult, but the best
40:874:76799:28:29:72:483:204:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:available estimates are better than none for the purposes of university and endowment
40:875:76884:29:28:72:532:175:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:management.  Second, universities should attempt to calculate their adjustment costs.  Knowing
40:876:76978:28:28:72:514:147:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:these costs is important for making every investment decision, whether on the intellectual or
40:877:77071:28:29:72:526:119:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:financial portfolio side.  Third, a universities' leaders (the president, provost, and so on) should
40:878:77171:29:0:72:526:90:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:be in close communication with its endowment managers, with the specific goal of exchanging
41:879:77300:0:29:72:520:686:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:information on the value of existing intellectual capital investments, on returns to prospective
41:880:77396:29:28:72:517:657:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:investments in intellectual capital, and on adjustment costs.  These exchanges should general
41:881:77489:28:28:72:535:629:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:spending rates on the endowment that depend and routinely adjust to circumstances on the social
41:882:77584:28:29:72:525:601:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:venture capital side of the portfolio.  If highly-endowed universities manage both sides of their
41:883:77681:29:28:72:534:572:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:portfolios in a rigorous and coordinated manner, they should be more able to make contributions
41:884:77776:28:0:72:416:544:12:g_d0_f1:12:g_d0_f1:to world intellectual capital that arguably would not exist without them.
